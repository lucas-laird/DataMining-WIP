Today I bought two Thai teas with boba and I got into the car and tasted the boba it tasted like a ROTTEN , bleached boba. It was not even sweet. I told them they need to taste their boba and they need to change the batch because it is ROTTEN they did not believe me nor did they want to to try their own batch of boba. They tried to reserve me another two drinks with that same batch of boba so I asked for a refund they just gave me a receipt saying VOIDED transaction. Let's just say if this transaction does not void we will have even more problems. I just want them to NOT serve it to anyone else.

It took 3 phone calls and an hour wasted of my time to resolve my issue. We ordered at 5:45, waited for delivery guy at 6:40, only to open our bags to find half the order was in the bag. Called the store, and passed around to 3 people before someone could even talk about the problem constructively. No sense of how to resolve a customer's problem at all!  We asked to speak to manager and were told they have no way to get in touch with them (red flag). Big fat lie! Given the usual excuses of ""we are so busy"" ""only one delivery guy"" ""no manager here"". Told them it's obvious you have no manager because then we wouldn't have this problem of an incomplete order. Officially our order was not delivered complete until 7:25.  

The next time you want to get what you pay for, I suggest any other Chinese restaurant than this one. They clearly don't care if they have happy customers unless you want to spend an hour and a half explaining to them how to do their jobs right. 

Normally I would let a mistake slide and give the benefit of the doubt, but this hasn't been the first time and after speaking with everyone in the joint, I'm certain with the way they view customer service, they don't plan on fixing the issues leading to this common mistake.

i'd much prefer it if they didn't use any breading whatsoever.
the salt and pepper pork chops also.

2244063,2014-10-07,0,UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A,"We like this place better than all the other American-style Chinese restaurants that we have tried in the valley. The people here are generally very kind and put a high priority on customer service. The produce used is fresh and is never over-cooked. Though we usually order for delivery, we have eaten in the restaurant several times and have also stopped by to pick up take-out orders. The restaurant is always clean (including the bathrooms) and the staff always goes out of their way to be helpful and welcoming no matter how busy they are at the time. When I have come in with our kids, we have gotten help to our car with our food. The waitresses always take the time to speak in Mandarin to our children who speak that language and the delivery drivers do the same if the kids are at the door with us when they arrive. The staff remembers customers even if they haven't been in for a while. It's nice. We even had a driver run to our house with our food from our community's gate once when he couldn't get the gate to open and his phone was having a glitch (so he couldn't call). In this arena, I would rate them 4.5 stars if that were possible. 

So, why the 3 star rating? Well, unfortunately, we have had a few issues with the food and, though it is rare,  I feel that with everything taken together, a lower ranking is appropriate. One of the first problems I remember is that we once got a noodle dish that had a big shaving of metal in it. I couldn't tell the origin of this with certainty. It is possible that it came from scraping a pot but from the looks of it, I think it was a piece of a metal to-go container (even though the dish wasn't served in one of those containers). It took a while before we ordered again, but a couple of orders later, we ordered vegetable fried rice with no egg and once I started eating it, I found a couple of chunks of egg and bbq pork in it. As a vegan, this was absolutely disgusting and disappointing. Just a few nights ago, we ordered again and there were stray pieces of meat towards the lower third of the container along with a few little bits of egg. Now, granted, these problems were more the rarity than the norm and they occurred over a range of time (along with several successful experiences) but they are also unacceptable occurrences to me. I tried to give the restaurant chances (after all, no place is perfect) and always politely let them know about the issues (not to seek anything for free but to give them information that could help them as well as other customers). However, after these incidents and a few others, I have decided that I am done with this place. The rest of our family may choose to dine there or order food from this establishment but I will opt for a different restaurant when they do (or simply make something at home). 

A note to China One- We do really enjoy our experiences with your staff but the kitchen workers need a bit more guidance on cross-contamination and proper food handling. I realize that in a kitchen environment, accidental cross-contamination and other similar issues are always possible but every possible step needs to be taken to avoid these issues. With so many people having allergies and intolerances and lots of others following different dietary lifestyles (for a variety of reasons), food workers need to step up and be more cautious. Sure, people with these issues can eat at home most of the time but it is not that hard to be careful in a kitchen and I feel that every attempt should be taken to accommodate reasonable requests and needs expressed by diners. Thanks for reading and best of luck for a successful future.",4qguccLSZEsypfPIsRbEaw,3,0,3,PToTINSPQVa7C7lRDADxsw

My bf ordered Kung pao chicken lunch special comes with delicious egg soup, hot the way soup should be delivered, right? The nice part of it was the wonton strips served with a tasty orange zest sauce. Mmm-m-mmm.. Mm.

So the food is good, definitely better than the usual all you can eat, but of course I've had much better at a seafood house or china town. Not bad at all, I'll be back.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,2,1,4,qo3mLNDcX4D6IyLa-zOq1g

There is no doubt in my mind that all the reviews are either A - Basing their score on quantity not quality or B - Family members of the China One owners.

I admit it. I actually went to China One over ten times when I first moved to Las Vegas over a year ago. So when you read this mini-review, you can rest assured that this often intoxicated man with a really large appetite for Chinese food knows what he is talking about. 

The only good things about China One are the amount of food you get for your money and the somewhat enticing coupons they send in the mail. You can get a FREE magnet and pen in store too, but if the place sucks and the ink in the pen only lasts about three seconds, I can't really consider those ""good things"".

As for the food, the beef and chicken entrees are chewy and the sauces are nothing that make you smack your lips twice to. The chow mein was horrible. I'd rather eat the packaging that it came in than that garbage. 

If you ever want large portions of lackluster Chinese food or an extra bowel movement in the morning, China One is your hole-in-the-wall.

For Americanized Chinese fast food, the bear has nothing on China One.(At least at this location, anyway) everything is made to order, hot off the wok, and the service is very quick, efficient, and they always check up on you if you needed a thousand more grains of rice, to make sure your meal is what you expected, or even refill your drink for you.

Dining in, they give you bigger portions, and they gave us egg drop soup, spring rolls, and wonton chips for the long wait. We shared the Beef Chow Fun and The Garlic Chicken. Looking for a quick hot meal that's filling? This is not a bad choice at all....ALOHA!!!

This place for me was 'Number 2' in terms of my Chinese go-to places here in Las Vegas.

For a long time, the be-all end-all for me with Chinese food was always Ho Ho Ho.  Then in 2011, I tried China One and I am glad I did!  I really enjoyed their options that came with main courses! Their egg drop soup was not too thick or heavy, their service was prompt, and they had delicious General Tso's chicken which is my number one favorite!

A few years ago, they opened up a restaurant just down the road from where I live on Durango and I'm constantly ordering via Eat 24.  Back when I used to work an early shift of 5 AM-2 PM, I'd go here for lunch, it was a perfect feeling to sink my teeth into some Chinese after an exhausting work day!

Their Sesame Chicken is another dish I'm always ordering and they are always good at making it to my specifications (no veggies).

I didn't order Mongolian bell peppers. I ordered Mongolian beef. Finally General's Chicken, which was the final plate, was criminally dry.

I will not give them another try when I'm at the Vegas spot. This was actually a sad experience. One of the worse Chinese I have tried. Twi Stars also because they delivered in 55 min.",2qrGhalrni65mGT12igdYQ,2,0,2,7hWfjgWB_kX0E3an2ho79Q

The food, its good not life changing but good. We normally get 2 or 3 entrees . I really like the chicken fried rice , the wife likes the beef and broccoli. The orange chicken is also quite good. The size for money is ok we normally spend 40 and get enough for 3 people and a bit of leftovers.

5048453,2013-02-14,0,UcIrRf2mWgqqlg-HNoDl0A,"I've been getting takeout for a bit here now and the overall is good. There are some misses too like with any place with a big menu but if you just want fast made to order  takeout this is the best on in the Centennial area. It's Americanized Chinese, Cantonese food. They're pretty accommodating about various requests too if you're trying to eat a certain way. Also, they deliver if you don't want to leave the house.

I figured I'd give a rundown of what I've liked and didn't like. 

First, the lunch specials are a good deal $6.25 meats - $6.95 for seafood (until 4pm daily). They really stuff the box with a entree and fried or steamed rice or chow mein (or half and half) and you get egg drop soup dining in. A la carte items come stuffed as well and pretty reasonable for most $7-10 for a portion one person will usually have trouble finishing. 

Eggplant and tofu - probably my favorite thing. I just like their sauce and if you have leftovers the tofu just absorbs more flavor so reheating could even taste better. I know some people don't like the soft, mildly slime factor of eggplant. Then get the tofu and vegetables and replace the brown sauce with the szechuan sauce that normally comes with eggplant and tofu.

General Tso- sometimes I just want something Americanized and I like the pineapples and veggies mixed in theirs. It does have the typical fried breading though you can see if you like if with just sliced chicken. This is janky guilty pleasure type stuff and not something I order a lot.

Chicken w/ black bean sauce-pretty good, bit more Canto than Americanized out of their offerings. I love black bean anything though. Pork with string beans in black bean sauce. I think I prefer this only slightly, but I love green beans. 

Shrimp in Lobster Sauce- pretty decent and plump shrimp and they tend to cook it right here, never had a shrimp thing be overcooked or gross.

Kung Pao chicken/shrimp - pretty decent here as well, lots of fresh veggies. I order it extra spicy which they add more dried chilies and sliced green peppers in it. 

I'm also a fan of their House fried rice being LOADED with meats and goodies in it. 

My big disappointment was their ma po was rather bland and that's normally one of my favorite take-out dishes.  I thought their Honey Walnut Shrimp was too mayo heavy. I didn't like their mongolian beef but I think its the matter of me not being a fan of that style. Their chow mein is too soft/sticky for my taste so I never get it on my lunch combos.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,1,4,bqjkdfy9EmiTodpOIqTp9g

For people who live in Northwest Las Vegas, finding a Boba spot that's open after 8PM can be extremely challenging. After a Yelp search, China One popped up as an attractive option. Granted, the drink options are limited (I think there's only 5 choices) but we were just happy to get our tea/boba fix. The Thai Tea was super sweet and refreshing and my husband was enamored by the Taro smoothie, which actually came out of a slushie machine. The employee brought the drinks to our table and wished us a good night as we left. Would we come back? If we ever have a late night hankering for Boba, we'll be back.
