I wanted to try something new, so I found the closest NY pizza place to my house. Ordered two large pizzas with garlic balls (12) and was happy with the order. The pizza was made perfect. My only complaint is that I had to wait even when I arrived over thirty minutes past the time given for the food to be ready.",Bet1qVniQY7FX8UFuUCVMw,0,0,4,jX-a9zBvJZjwFnmI47DEsA

I got a kick out of the reviewer who was worried about the saturated fats he may have consumed. Come on, this is suppose to be a NY style pizza joint, there are no worries about saturated fat when you come here. If you are worried about that then stop by the Go Raw Cafe or the Red Velvet Cafe. 
I wanted to get a taste of their freshly made pizzas so we ordered a sausage, green peppers & onions pizza (versus picking slices that get warmed up in the oven after ordering). The ingredients were fresh and were served in ample portions. The crust was one of the best I have had here in Las Vegas. My only complaint is that there was not enough sauce on the pizza. The pizza came quickly, the employees were friendly and helpful. I felt the price was reasonable for the quality. I will be going back for more. I would avoid this place at busy times due to the cramped area the tables are placed in.",xOjtlIjWS0djtoYhjBDgxA,1,1,4,0OXW7rjH3E06lPCE6jy8NQ

Not only is it super close to home, but more importantly, they use some terrific toppings. Their sausage, in particular, is the bomb. The sauce is excellent and exhibits a winning blend of acidity, herbs, and spices. The crust, while very good, is not the best that we've had and does tend to get soggy after awhile from all the delicious toppings.

We usually get a large (18 inch) ""Everything"" pizza to go, but their sausage and peppers sub is mighty tasty as well. The price ($18) is on the higher side, but we don't mind shelling out a little extra for this kind of quality.

They also have a mini market of authentic Italian food items for sale - pasta, canned tomatoes, stuff like that.

530866,2011-03-07,1,Gdv3qhsDeQzZ2Ag-Tzq6vA,"Ahh, a glorious, treasured saturday afternoon off had me craving a slice and a soda. With the top down, beautiful 70 degree weather in March, went to Roccos, mentally tasting what i was gonna order.  When we got there, a line quickly developed, who knew that at 2 pm everyone else in Summerlin had the same idea?  The very friendly 2-person staff was kept quite busy. We each ordered a 2-slice combo with a drink, pepperoni and sausage.  While we waited, I added the cucumber tomato salad with gooey balls of italian mozzarella for myself.  What the heck, i knew i wouldn't be hungry for dinner later.  The salad was luscious, and drenched with a homemade dressing that was just enough tang, but not too much to wilt the crunch of the veggies.  The meal was delivered outside where we sat in the sun.  Perfect, right?  Perfect for me, but my date took one look at it and exclaimed, I can't eat that, it's full of grease and I'll be sick for a week if I do.  Crestfallen, but still hungry, I suggested returning it to be made with less oil (and more ala pizza hut style,  which means yuckky to me). He said no, and sat there, bemoaning the money that I SPENT not him on the meal.  I suggested that he try the Aloha Hawaiian bbq next door.   He said no way.  So...I ate with or without him.  Glory behold, he decided to try the pizza, and remarked, this is actually really good!  Yey, total conversion.  No sickness, and he even said ""I'd like to try this place again!""

I'm told by another casual diner at Roccos that they import their mozzarella, and make their own sausage. I believe it. The pizza crust was slightly crunchy and perfect.  

In summary, when I have a craving for the perfect day out with a simple slice, i'll return to Roccos, and maybe just have a solo experience!",01prx46XR0mMJpNjpGeS6Q,1,1,4,e9Bhvnoub2vwxetWZOZnOQ

Not realizing what I was about to walk into I ordered philly sandwich.  As I pulled up I could already smell the Italian goodness I was about to embark.  Now I have driven by a million times and have read a few of the reviews that pop up but really I HAD NO IDEA what an amazing place this is!  

As I approached the counter I could not believe the selection in front of me....and I ordered a philly.  Silly me.  I love the ""by the slice"" idea so you can sample a couple different styles of pizza.  There was a great selection from pizza to garlic knots...down to the little dessert complimentary by the cashier.  I told the guy I will definitely be back to do some pizza since that is their thang and that is what everyone raves about.

Contrary to the other reviews the main guy was a sweetheart.  I think people just misunderstand the NY edge.  The place was vibrantly decorated-fresh and modern with a New York feel.  Outdoor seating is available but no one was sitting out there. The chairs and table looked metal - OUCH!  They sure are cute but I dont see myself sittin on those in the summer....this is Vegas boys. Lol 

Now for my Philly, first off their bread is baked fresh.  I ordered the regular which is the 6"" but really it looked more than a 10"".  It was huge.  The bread as I said was so good I could eat it alone....so fresh.  The meat with grilled onions was so flavorful.  You could actually taste that it was steak.  There was so much meat I could only eat half the sandwich.  The cheese I believe was american but didnt overpower the sandwich. Soo so yum.  I brought the second half to the BF at the end of the day and the sandwich was just as good warmed up-I know because I had to have another bite.  I have had the turkey/provelone before that someone ordered me and that sandwich was no joke either.  BTW my boss ordered the Staten Island and its his fav out of the sandwiches.  

I will be back and bring the fam...sit and actually enjoy the meal there (pizza for sure this time) and I will update my review but as of now two thumbs up for Rocco's philly steak sandwich, fresh bread and ingredients, ambiance, decor and service!!!  One big happy package!  Can't wait to get back there!",4Ch_27GkNV5p7I7ewlX3DQ,2,1,5,NMppN8VrRGjcRR1dc0wgDA

order a sausage and a peperoni ( only meat for the patrons of my old place )

nice enough place - got the italian/ny pics on the wall, yeah, never seen that before. 

included a free order of the little italian donut puffs ( damn it, my mom is looking down on me know for forgetting the name ! ) zeppole ?!?! 

get the pizza to the bar, the bar fly's start to swarm, i get a slice of each before the boxes are down to crumbs. 

pepperoni - ok - a little to much cheese combined with the peperoni grease makes for a floppy slice ! The sausage - very good !!

The pizza is extremely bland 
Garlic knots not flavorful at all
Spaghetti and meat balls ..oh lawd. The sauce tasted like crushed canned tomatoes with no seasoning...like AT ALL. Meatballs had to be the frozen ones you can buy at any grocery store.

It was solid experience and won me over with both pizza/pasta dishes. It been while since stop by again but after solid day of training my training partner and I decided on pizza by the slice for recovery meal. He was telling me about other location across from Red Rock Casino. I was like pizza by slice. Hell yay!! 

Unlike the rainbow location this one has way WAY more personality. The whole interior set up is much more true to a small pizza joint see in the city. The kitchen is pretty small, they have tiny market section (pasta, can sauces, and little bit of everything), and refrigerator filled with ready to go sauces take home plus few other items. As you walk towards the back of the restaurant to the dining area. It this little hallway that opens up to not very big dining area say less then fifty seats. All the stuff on the way from the photos (ton of family photos, and lot of famous landmark you know in NYC), and some artwork murals again NYC famous landmarks. The table overs with the checkerboard look screams italian. I love the vibe of the restaurant. Just fyi I was telling the guy about the Rainbow location and he told me that the ownership is not the original Rocco owner anymore. Guess he only owns this location and one other location out of three or four believe around town. Fair speaking of the pizza I feel both locations were very good. 

We got three pies all together by the slice. I only got one. The sausage and pepperoni. It was awesome. The dough really feel like was true to new york style pie. The sauce and toppings fresh. Maybe they shipped in some of that NYC water because everything about the dough was spot on and the crust addicting. The size of the pizza by the slice another true sign. It nice size. I had one piece hit the spot if had two that like eating small pizza for me. The way serve it on simple plan white paper plate. The price is super reasonable per slice. Really not many pizza places serve by the slice outside of food court in mall. If looking for legit pizza by the slice Rocco's NY Pizzeria.

The antipasto platter is a great addition to your favorite pie. Dad enjoys fresh smoked mozzarella and I buy it as a treat for him, since while I'll pull fresh mozzarella a couple times a year during holidays, smoked is outside my realm of expertise. 

My family and friends enjoy the regular pie well done and a variety of sandwich specials and dinner items. Stand outs have been chicken Marsala, pasta dishes and many others we've tried in 9 years patronage. We've made a small army of fans out of friends and by word of mouth. 

Some of the items others have referred to as decorative and unnecessary have been great finds for a transplanted NY girl: Ronzoni Pastina to make chicken soup with egg and escarole like Nona made. Cavatelli in the frozen section is my go to pasta for when I make Vongole con cavatelli bianco (white.clam sauce that allows the bivalves to sneak into tubular pasta = mangia) the homemade sausage is a hit with the fam as well. It is by no means a fancy dining room, the star here is the food. 

On several occasions I've ordered custom to go platters for office parties or to show clients what real Italian tastes like from the standpoint of a second generation L'American. They fill cannoli to order and carry a variety of cookies, gelato in pre packed pints and fresh zeppoles (fried pizza dough, in a paper bag with confectioner's sugar) During the holidays, be sure to order cannoli and cookie platters early; they even make honey balls (strufoli)

The Italian ices, sauces to go and NY Daily News to read only add to the authentic vibe. For all of the people who complain about waiting: call ahead. Quality takes time. And quality is what Rocco's through owner changes and many years, has delivered without fail over the years.

On my first venture, I luckily tried Rocco's and it immediately brought back memories of an excellent slice of New York pizza; the kind you can get on every other block in NY, and is barely anywhere to be had in Los Angeles.

Large, cheesy slices that are best eaten folded; the sauce is nicely seasoned and not too sweet; and most importantly, the crust is just the right thickness with an excellent bite.

The shop is not fancy at all, but has a decent seating area in the back. Walking in, the store feels pretty much like a typical NY pizza joint, which I love. I haven't tried anything other than their pizza but I will eventually. I'm looking forward to checking out Grimaldi's at Boca Park for more of a nice, sit-down pizza dinner, but Rocco's is definitely my pizza joint.",QYZG3PbsdSwAXqhrzwZ5JQ,0,0,5,IqCDH4em3fAIoU9Pttb8pg

I was feening for garlic knots all day and found this place on Yelp.  The nice man working let me sample the garlic rolls, they were mediocre.  I ordered a slice of pepperoni & sausage, a slice of cheese, and 6 garlic knots to go.  They packaged the garlic knots in foil, however, they don't wrap the pizza in foil, they simply put it on a paper plate and lay it in a brown bag.  The brown bag became soaked in oil, so I had to drive with one hand on the wheel and one hand holding the bag so the oil wouldn't leak in my car.  The whole drive home, I was paranoid from thinking the oil may start dripping on me/my car/my purse, etc, but it didn't.  Good thing I was wearing shorts because I had to wipe my hand clean (from the oil) on my leg and then take my car keys out of the ignition.  This was the messiest take out order I've ever encountered.  They should really wrap the pizza in foil.  I can just imagine there have been people who left the brown bag on a car seat, only to discover an oil mark on the upholstery or purse or clothing.  

Once I got home, I washed my hands and leg and dove into the pizza.  OMG-delish, this thin pizza packs a lot of flavor!  I usually like thick crust, but boy, this thin crust pizza is the bomb, the best I've ever had!  The marinara sauce for the garlic knots was on the bland side and the garlic knots itself was ok.  The bread was soft, but it lacked flavor.   

The pizzeria was extremely clean and they sold snacks, frozen food, and ice cream.  I liked the pictures they put on the wall.  There's plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors.

It's very small (setup primarily for take out), but it does have some tables in the back.

We waited for our pizza a little longer then I would've expected and on top of that we got our pizza first, before our antipasta dish. We had to ask about our antipasta dish, so I suspect they forgot. I'm sorry to say that we both felt that the pizza was just average, we liked the antipasta better. 

Being from the SF area, we've definitely had our share of good pizza and we were both disappointed. Furthermore, service was not their strength at all, but then again they are set-up more for take-out/delivery.

I've been here twice and I had to wait a while both times.  First time it was 20 minutes.  Second time it was 50 minutes!

First time:
I was grabbing food from L &L next door and my wife wanted pizza.  So she goes in and orders two slices of white pizza and the zappoles fried donut powdered sugar things.

We waited over 20 minutes for her order.  There is no place to wait for your order in the front. It is like trying to smash 20 people into a refrigerator box.  The owners really need to rethink the shelves full of groceries lining the front counter.  There is NO ROOM. Especially when it is crowded. 

The white pizza was good, the zeppoleswere AMAZING!  A whole brown bag full for under $5. Not bad.

Second time:
We ordered a white pizza and a meatball pizza TO GO.  They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.

Well, I arrived 20 minutes later and waited another 50 minutes for my pizza to be made.  Apparently the guy making the pizza mistook it for a meatball sandwich and didn't make it until 30 minutes in.  While my white pizza stood in a box on top the oven for 30 minutes to cool down.  No real apology from the guy at the register either after they realized.

When I finally got my pizza and left, the meatball pizza was UNDERCOOKED / Doughy and the white pizza was COLD.  Big FAIL!

Imagine having to stand in a long, thin corridor with other people waiting for their orders like me and others trying to order and make it to the back of the dining room.  GET RID OF THOSE GROCERY SHELVES PLEASE!  There needs to be more room, it's almost like a fire hazard.  People were tripping over each other and myself and my very patient son.

My impression of Rocco's was that that it was a stand-only-waiting-room-of-semi-organized-chaos-in-crowded-hell.

I do honestly like Rocco's NY Pizzeria, their pizza is good and their pasta is as well, but I must honestly admit that the authentic New York ambiance of Rocco's, with it's decidedly acerbic nature, is the biggest draw for me. Being a native of the Midwest, I will forever remain unaccustomed to rude and impatient New Yorkers - but I love that.

Taking this into account, I am inclined to look favorably on any establishment where I can experience a little east coast attitude. Often times it will play a role in my overall rating of an eatery, as it did in my first review of Rocco's.

Since my initial visit, I have returned a few more times to sample the various wares. It was after these visits that I began to form the theory above, as I realized that the food is not great, but in fact, just good. 

On my most recent visit I ordered the rigatoni with sausage, mushrooms and what was supposed to be hot cherry peppers. What I got was a sloppily presented carton of rigatoni with the sausage, mushrooms and peppers decidedly bunched together in one large clump - oh, and with jalapenos, not cherry peppers. The sauce was okay, but not extraordinary and certainly not enough to distract from the presentation. 

Don't get me wrong, I understand that Rocco's focus is more toward convenience than elegance, but I can never excuse sloppiness in presentation. It doesn't need frills, but a little dried Italian herb sprinkling with some parmesan would at least make the meal look appetizing.

Rocco's offers typical, convenient and good Italian dishes that you would expect from a New York Style deli, but that's only going to get them a 3 star rating.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,1,0,3,FvHCwnmzS_vVb8rxseKIjQ

You will slowly take in all this place has to offer (a freezer filled with gelatio, ice cream, sauces, desserts; stacks of pasta and canned Italian goods; an amazing menu of pizza, pasta and more.

The Sicilian pie was nice - cheesy and crusty and perfectly sauced. 

We also picked up a small order of the garlic knots. Real doughy goodness with plenty of garlic sensibility. The accompanying marinara made them extra tasty. Wasn't so much a fan of seeing them served swimming in a greasy bath. Still very tasty.

We also scored some cannoli. These amazing pastries are VERY recommended. Smooth cream with chocolate chips and a crispy crust and pounded with a powdered sugar storm. Whoa.

I must point out however, I am not a NY Pizza expert by any stretch of the imaginiation.  I would have given Rocco's 3 stars, but it earned an extra star for reasons explained below.

The prices are a touch on the pricey side, I think it was about $3 to $3.50 per slice and a slice is a little over 1/8th of a 18 inch pie.  The crust is thin, a little chewy and very pliable.  In genuine east coast fashion, they reheat the slices of pizza you order so they come to you nice and hot.  I had the pepperoni and sausage and sausage and mozzarella pizza.  The all meat pizza was a bit greasy and nothing special, but the sausage and mozzarella wasless greasy and very tasty.  I also ordered a small order of freshly made caprese salad.  Which brings me to the reasons why I gave an extra star to this restaurant.  Friendliness of service and selection of goods.

The owner (?) was super friendly and let me buy a smaller single serving size of the salad which was greatly apreciated.  There are also rice balls, homemade cannoli and zeppole on their menu.

You might be wondering if I ate all that myself and the answer is of course not! I ended up splitting it with my hubby.

Now let me tell you how pizzawesome this pizza was!!! As soon as I sank my teeth into this light thin crusted saucy cheesy pizza I was instantaneously transported to my childhood when I remember eating pizza just like this. Wow!!!! I was transported by pizza! 

What a miracle to find a place that actually makes pizza the way it's suppose to be made. Freaking frack! Everything about this pizza oozes perfection! Kid you not!

The taste of the crust is flaky, crispy yet tender. The amount of sauce is not overwhelming nor too little, also the amount of cheese is also perfect, smooth in texture and amazingly great taste.

Some of you might think, but this is just pizza! No big deal. What's the difference? Well let me tell you that all pizzas are not created equal and I believe I have found the perfect pizza place in Las Vegas.

I've eaten at so many pizza joints around town and even in CA and I have to say that I have yet to find a pizza that can match Rocco's NY Pizza.

The meatball sub didnt have enough meatballs but tasted pretty good.   The pizza was average and overpriced based on how good it was.   The main problem was the customer service.  They didnt seem to want to answer any questions, especially regarding specials.  Main guy kept answering the phone even though he knew I had a question to ask.  As I was waiting to ask a question, I over hear him talking to a customer ""Sir, The ranch comes in an average size, I'm not going to describe it to you.  Just come in and if you want more ranch, i'll sell you more ranch""  Very unprofessional!

This type of treatment is unexcusable especially since at the time that I ordered and received my pizza slices, it was not busy and there were staff just hanging around.  Although I understand that staff can make mistakes, the fact that they did not apologize but instead said ""So I guess you want your order to go,"" was just unacceptable behavior.  I grew up in the east coast area, and if this had occurred at a pizza joint there, I would have asked for a refund.

Are you telling me if someone put ketchup on the best crust in the world it would be the best pizza? Bullfeathers. 

I digress. Around these Yelp parts, Rocco's is touted as being some of the best NY Style pizza in Las Vegas. NY Styles means thin, large slices that tend to collapse in your hands. I have not been eating too much pizza of late, but we were over at Best Buy getting some new pans (not sure who's going to use them!), so I decided to pop in for a slice.

A large part of the charm here is the atmosphere, as you definitely feel as if you have walked into a Bronx pizza joint. Shelves are crowded with pasta and candy; there is a fridge with Italian ice, coconut gelato and Rocco's marinara sauce to go. The lady behind the counter delivers big smiles and charm with a big accent. It all works together to create the ideal environment for scarfing down a slice. We probably came a little late in the day for the freshest slices. By 4pm the premade pizzas looked a little disappointing, but whaddya expect?

Mondays they have a pizza special: large cheese for $10. Good deal, but we weren't ready to commit to a whole pie. I ordered one slice of the vegetarian. The crust was a nice balance of crispy and chewy, and the sauce had a nice sweetness. I must say, however, that for me, a pizza is all about the toppings. Ha! No, that is not my pizza quip. Seriously, I was a little disappointed in the toppings. They were sparse. I like piles of things on my slice. Yes, I am a glutton who is willing to use a fork. Have you seen my cow picture?

Anyways, that is just one little complaint. Overall, Rocco's has a delicious combination of atmosphere, crust and sauce. Way, way, way better than ketchup on a brilliant crust!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,9,4,azNorKPPu_VK8QmaE8BwFA

Pizza is thin, typical NY pizza, maybe a little too thin though.  It's also insanely greasy, too much for the dreaded napkin dab, you'll need a few. The service is typical NY service, short, not so sweet and far from friendly.  I guess they're really trying to give you the NY experience.

Price is decent, but not far down the street in Boca Park is East Side Pizza. Far better IMO, and the same price.",yMNgkWt2Z2-GhyU9_I5j1w,1,1,3,fDHC-PzFsXfb2a0phkRIIQ

The NY pizza (ie ""floppy pizza"") is very good. They've got the ratio of sauce to cheese down and the crust, although not perfect, offers the right amount of glutenous chewiness. But what I really come here for are the sandwiches. 

I know, the name says pizzeria, but the sandwiches are works of art served on an entire loaf of crusty, wood oven-baked, Italian bread.

Partial brick façade, pictures of old-time Italian New Yorkers strewn on walls, abrupt but not necessarily rude employees, and display plates of each dish laid out behind the plexi-glass counter, all work out to a great facsimile of what you find in the City.  Huge plus for me, even the New York-style service.  I've spent many a months in the city that never sleeps and have eaten my share of New York style pizza, which is one of my favorite dish of all time.  I'd have to say that pizza here is basically the same as what you will get in a ""typical"" pizza joint on any street corner in the City.  And that's a good thing.

I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of pepperoni/sausage, with a fountain drink.  $9.50 for that, which is NOT like NYC.  You can get that for $2-3 cheaper out there, so it's not necessarily a great bargain.  First bite into the pepperoni and the bottom is a bit crunchier than I'd like.  The end crust is a bit crispier than I'd like also.  Pep/Sausage is better on both fronts, but I like the taste of the pep better.  The sauce is typical, not great but not bad either.  It comes piping hot after they reheat in the pizza oven, so be careful you don't burn your mouth.  I did.  They also have stromboli and calzone, both of which I'd like to try one day.

Like I said, it's really not any different than the typical street corner pizza joint with solid pies, awesome setting, and take-it-or-leave-it service.  So does that deserve a 4 or 5-star rating?  Well, the level of pizza is probably a 3.5 based on a 4-star for the actual typical NYC pie, and obviously service is somewhere around 3.  But with the authentic setting and the fact that this ""real"" NYC shop is a mile from my house, I'm upping it to a 4 even with the inflated pricing.  But seriously, $3.50 is too much for a slice, Rocco.

Table-for-1 Pizza:  One big reason I frequented Manhattan pizza joints often is the fact that you could eat there alone, unnoticed (not a loner, was there for work often).  No different here, so it's a perfect spot.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,2,1,4,16-cubIjcWdRd-LmlNGiBw

I hate that there's so many pizzarias in town that claim to be NY pizza (i.e. Joe's New York Pizza) and it's nothing like an east coast pizza at all. Rocco's is the only place I've been to out here that tastes anything like an east coast pizza and trust me, I know.. I've been eating pizza from North NJ and NYC for 23 years.  Anyways, my favorite from Rocco's is the white pizza and pepperoni with sausage. YUM.  I tried one of their sandwiches before but it wasn't that great. Normally places that have good pizza have bad everything else. So I just stick to the pizza when I go there. I also love that they have Wise chips there since they don't carry them in many Vegas grocery stores. They also have a little italian ice stand in the summer which is nice. Their italian ice is super yummy as well!",e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw,0,1,5,KCBbQRqgIb2O8c_HI9xUnQ

My passenger side seat was coated in a light layer of grease by the time I made the 5 min drive home.Uh oh. The bag was soaking in oil. Uh oh. Anyways, I proceeded to eat the pizza. Uh oh. I ate it, but it didn't sit too well in my tummy. I chased it with a coke to settle my stomach a bit but otherwise the pizza was decent. Very greasy, and I think it had been sitting out for a bit too long. And you might wanna ask the guy to leave your slice in there for a bit so it's nice and hot. It looked like a cool place to eat, but I think I'll be sticking to other pizza places.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,3,7EEjIxd24sV-N42FPaI2-g

There was a lack of toppings for claiming ""everything"".  The salad had to have been lunch leftovers. It was soggy and for $6.99 was lacking in quantity. We will not return.  It was huge disappointment.",KNtWjwlVGYBM7S8zSVvbxw,1,0,1,DggTVnjRQ5ac6qTaNFIh-g
