When my now-husband and I found out that we could get married at Denny's we decided that we had to do it.  I received excellent service once I was put in touch with Sheila, the manager.  She explained to me what I options I could choose from and we went from there.  In the beginning, we had chosen the cheapest option, but we were upgraded because we had a special guest musician perform for us.  The upgrades were great!  The flower bouquet and boutonniere was so pretty!!!  The cake pops were delicious and the set up looked great!  We had also wanted an Elvis minister, so they put us in touch with one and he was fantastic!!  I would definitely recommend getting married at Denny's if you are thinking about getting married in Vegas!",WQbJUmnkVpbbOaWMQloHDg,2,1,4,bXpV7gJjmvBNttndovoifQ

Worst of all, I ordered an Irish Coffee. They charged me $4.50 for the Irish Coffee and then $5.00 for Baileys.  A $9.00 Irish Coffee. When I complained , the manager said I had to call the General Manager and the District Manager to get any recourse. Never going there again.

Nous avions débarqué à deux, vers 22h avec une envie de burger pour ma part, et de salade pour la part de ma maman. 
Après avoir attendu 2/3 Minutes, nous avons été installé et les festivités ont pu avoir lieu. 

Personnel très compétent, attentionné, et naturellement gentil. Après avoir dégusté nos limonades en attendant nos plats (environ une dizaine de Minutes), nous nous sommes régalés ! 

J'ai mangé mon meilleur burger aux USA chez eux. 
J'ai pris le SlamBurger et ce fut un réel délice !!! 
Gros burger servi avec des frites maison, un régale !!! 

Quand à la salade qu'à prit ma mère, celle-ci était très imposante et très bonne !

291767,2012-12-05,0,xDvl_i1g1HCJ4EmIRmwfqg,"I'm not exactly sure when this location first opened, but some co-workers and I recently headed over to check out the Denny's at Neonopolis. In reality, I'm not a big fan of Denny's, but thought it'd be fun and kitschy.

The Good

It is the nicest, cleanest Denny's that I have ever been in. They have a full bar, which seems interesting for a Denny's, but then again, it's on Fremont Street and that makes sense. I can't comment on the bar because we went for lunch during the work week.  ('Nuff said.) 

The restaurant has a photo booth that's Vegas-themed (NEAT); the kind where there's an outline for your head, you stand there, take the picture, and you'll come out with Elvis hair or whatnot. But the camera is kinda high, so if you're a scrimp like me (5' 1"" or shorter), the camera is too high. Sadly, my head didn't reach the outline, and there was no stool or anything like that.

We all had the french toast special, which was cheap ($6-7) and decent (or at least the french toast was; the sausage  . . . well, we won't talk about that). Our waitress told us that they're opening a wedding chapel (or already did), and there was a celebrity wedding already lined up for February. (At least we're already in Vegas for betting purposes.)  

The Bad

My group was seated in a booth adjacent to another booth, with some artsy-geometric bars as a separator from the head-up. As we were paying the bill, another co-worker and I turned around in the booth, and noticed a dude's head literally peering over our shoulders through the bars. Apparently, he was looking to see if we were done with our food. Kinda caught us off guard a bit.   

The Ugly

It's still Denny's food. Okay / decent, but not great by any means. The general group consensus was that Denny's is a place to end up.

Overall

So why the four stars? Location, location, location! It's Denny's on Fremont, so it's worth checking out for that reason alone. Also, this restaurant has an outside patio, which will be a fun spot to people watch in the summertime, and offers uncommon Denny's menu items like flatbread.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,2,1,4,L0jsCdagqPqX9l_MDSGTow

She assured me that she would tell the kitchen to put a rush on the order and, sure enough, it was ready in plenty of time. 

As I was looking at the menu, I noticed that the infamous seasoned fries were missing. Instead, there was a choice of regular fries or sweet potato fries.

We put our name on the list for a party of 4, and were told it would be 10-15 minutes... didn't make very much sense considering I was looking around seeing empty tables. My first thought was that they're understaffed.

We stepped just outside because the lobby area was quite crowded with many people waiting. I went back in after a few minutes to make sure I didn't miss our name being called. The hostesses seemed confused trying to figure out what was going on. They're calling several different names and no one is around (and they really wonder why people walk out? HA). Finally the nicer hostess points and says our listed name, ""that's you right?""

And this other RUDE WOMAN (to put it so nicely) has the NERVE to say to paying customers:

""Lets go I was ready for you five minutes ago!"" ...walks us to the table and slams down our silverware and doesn't say another word and walks away.

Like excuse me, are you effing kidding me?! If I hadn't been with friends trying to have a good time I could have had that [explicative]'s job handed to her, because it took a lot of self restraint to not say anything.

Because of the fact that we stepped right outside the door because it was crowded and you called us right away after giving us a wrong time, it's OUR fault that you don't have your s%?# together?!

This is the first impression management and Denny's as a corporation wants me as a customer to see, huh?

I never expect exceptional service at Denny's. But that was just crossing a line, I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm sitting here even contemplating calling someone about that [explicative]. You can't honestly expect to give customers attitude and keep your job... absolutely ridiculous. If you don't like working there, then get the hell out. That's just the way it goes.

That all being said, our server was great. She was kind, attentive, and you could genuinely tell she cared for her job. If I could give zero stars, I'd still give one star for our nice server. Unfortunately I couldn't really enjoy my meal and the experience was doomed from the get-go, and the food was just mediocre. I feel sorry for those who work there and actually care and have to work with such trashy people, who are abound according to many prior reviews.

The red potatos and the squash and zucchini are super delicious! 

We both ordered cokes, I took a sip of mine and it tasted hella nasty, like they done mixed it up with all kinds of soda. I didn't want to ask my waitress for another one because she wasn't exactly friendly either. So I sucked it up and just took couple sips. 

Just a tip if you go after 10pm they stop serving soup.

This last trip has me never wanting to go back and it is a shame. 
We ordered food to go for the family and a meal was forgotten. We did not realize it till we were far away. We were upset but nothing a refund could not change. I called the location and told them what happened. The girl who said she was the manager apologized and said ""Sorry, that chick forgot to put it in the bag."" Very unprofessional attitude and weak communication skills. Surprised she is your manager.
Well we asked for a refund and she said the opening manager could handle it the next day. The next day we went to Denny's for breakfast. After our meal was finished I asked to speak to a manager to speak about the refund. The manager said it would be a few days till the refund hit our account. Understandable. Well the end of this story, the refund never came. 
I understand things can happen, like forgetting to put a meal inside the bag but when you say you are going to refund a person then REFUND them.

However, this Denny's has a full bar- so we went here just for the novelty of it.  In fact, it was a planned destination.  And we were VERY disappointed!  Due to a skiing accident, my daughter is in a wheelchair.  A server 'seated us' by throwing a couple of menus on a table, pointing as she continued walking to the back of the diner.  Since we had just come from a show at the Smith Center Theater- we went to the restroom and returned to OUR table to find other people sitting there! (That is why a Host/hostess should be seating guests- not servers) We gathered our things and from across the room, were told to sit at the next table.  However, that table was not handicap/wheelchair accessible- and again from across the room- we were told to sit at another table.  Needless to say, it was not a great start to our dining experience.  Granted- it's Denny's- and we didn't expect a coat & tie experience, but this was the worst!  We placed our order, and once we received it, no one ever came by to check on our order, refill drinks or see if we needed anything.  I had to flag down two different servers to request mustard.  After we finished eating, our dishes were not removed and the server seemed irritated that we chose to order cocktails after dinner.  We enjoyed our drinks, and I must say- the Cosmo was one of the better ones I have ever had, it was the service or the lack of that I had problems with.  I stood in line to pay and then went back to the table to retrieve my daughter, since the space between the door and the register was tight.  I was stopped at the door by a ""Security"" woman demanding to see my receipt- the very same woman who stood there and watched me pay to begin with.  This was a problem because the receipt was tossed into the bag on the back of my daughter's wheelchair- so I had to dig it out.  And then, she stood at the door, never offering to open or hold the door, and like I said, it was a tight space, so turning around so that I could back us out the door was awkward.  Thankfully- another customer on his way in opened the door for us.  Will this Denny's survive?- probably because of it's location.  Will it thrive? Eh??  I definitely will not be back, and will advise all those I know not to bother.

I got my free birthday breakfast, which was awesome. I was also able to have a fricken Bloody Mary, because they have a full bar!

Whether they be funny, drunken, high, sad, depressed or what not...Denny's is your go to American restaurant anytime of the day. And yes, that does apply, even with the one in Fremont St. in Downtown Vegas. 

Probably one of the few Denny's that has an open bar(duh, its Vegas), this is one of the very few places that will remain open especially after all other places nearby have closed. I came here on a bright Sunday morning with my foodie +1 date after EDC because we was craving breakfast. Denny's was my first choice, not hers. Eventually since nothing else was open, we opted here. Very roomy inside with a very sweet waitress who attended to us...should've gotten her name but due to the fact that I was half asleep, I couldn't do so. I had their fit slam and my +1 had their philly steak omelette. We really did not want to stuff ourselves too much before going to bed! 

Just like any other Denny's, this one does not stand out too much, except for the fact that this one just so happens to be in Sin City.

The other reason why I love this place is because, sometimes, I'd rather having a burger for breakfast, or nachos, maybe even an epic salad. It depends on what I'm in the moods for.

I'm not the typical person stuck on traditional meal genres and what foods are to be eaten at those times.

I like to stop in here and get whatever inspires me!

Not dripping, but enough for my daughter to be very cold when not in the sun.  We told the host that we were going to leave since she was so cold, but asked if they had any seats outside available.  He said that the patio seating was the part of the bar and my daughter couldn't sit there.  Then he told us to hold on a minute and went to ask his manager something.

I needed to make a stop downtown anyway so I quickly decided to head for this Denny's.  I've driven by after a show several times and I wanted to try it. I parked in the city owned garage below Neonopolis and it's a short walk one flight up to get to the store areas and the Denny's.  The entrance is on the side.

I ordered a Start Up omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with a choice of cheese and comes with toast and hash browns or grits.  I got tomato slices instead of the toast and grits.  I had already been brought fresh coffee.

The omelette was a standard one with a fair amount of cheese inside.  The tomato slices were a nice change from the carbs of the breakfast sides.  The plate was one of the hottest plates I've touched in quite awhile and it kept the breakfast warm while I ate.

My server was a young woman who was very pleasant.  She brought me some Cholula as requested.  That's always a bonus.

One criticism--the small booths are really small!!  It would be hard to fit two standard sized adults in the space.  I pushed the table almost to the far side of the booth.  Sit at the counter or outside.

A couple of things.  They advertise that this is the only Denny's in the world with a wedding chapel.  Well, not really.  There's an area with some wedding photos on the wall and if you want to get married at Denny's in downtown Las Vegas, that's where it will be.  They move the tables aside and you exchange your vows there.  I am aware from the news that there has been a wedding here.  Well, the licenses are sold only a few blocks away.  Second thing, the parking in the garage below Neonopolis is so convenient.  Denny's does not validate for this city owned garage but I had no payment due when I left.  perhaps it was the time of day, the day of the week, or merely the fact that I was here for less than an hour.

If your server asks if something is okay, he/she knows the answer!  The fries were pretty good, though some of mine were under-cooked and they don't have malt vinegar. The capper was the bill. You have to write down your tip prior to the waitress processing the card. She became much more officious when she discovered she received a mere 15% tip. I noticed other people sending back food that was missing little things, like the toppings they ordered on their specialty pancakes. I would recommend giving this Denny's time to figure out it's issues. Eat is great and down the street, and Hennessy's is across the street and has a great burger. Both have better food for roughly the same price. This place may be great once Denny's closes and something else opens up in it's place!",jP6DSjkBCn5GGwGF2SRS8Q,1,0,2,r9yTsvgJLTsIYM-p-EbG2A

I'm not a big fan of Denny's but my friends insisted on eating her. 

I ordered a tall glass of water and let them enjoy their food. The food did not look good to me but they loved it. My husband ordered a pancake breakfast with hash browns and sausage.Two other friends ordered burgers and they all enjoyed their meal. 

Our server JB was really nice and on a busy Saturday night he was sure to stop by any chance he got. The other staff is pretty nice as well. Checking out is pretty easy. You literally walk up to the counter and pay and then you're done.

It's filled with plentiful layers of meatballs, pasta, sauce and cheese. Heavy and filling, I finished 1/3 of my plate. No place for a microwave to heat it so I'm sad to admit the rest was wasted.

If you've never been to a Denny's before this chain has an extensive breakfast menu that you can customize at your choosing. They have 'Fit' items that are great for those of you who are healthy consious. One of my favorite's is the Loaded Veggie Omelet which I had today. I substituded the hash browns for fruit which you can do at no extra cost. 

I don't know if any other Denny's has ""Pan Cake Puppies"" but this particular won does. I tried the Red Velvet Pan Cake Puppies and they serve it with a cream chesse syrup dip. It's very, very good. 

The place is fairly clean and location is ideal for the DTLV tourist. It has a full bar, at the end where you can sit in the patio area and get some primo people watching time in! Specially after midnight. Yes, I did say bar, as in you can grab a brew or have a shot of Te-killya with your Denny's meal. 

The three stars were given because of the service. It could definitely have been better. I feel bad saying that since the server was polite and courteous but that's about it. Polite and courteous is only part of your tip. He never came around to check on us once we ordered even though he passed by our table several times.. He had to be flagged down each time. 

The food took about 30 minutes to come out and it wasn't really that busy. Ok, maybe they were short staffed, but who isn't now-a-days. Before the food even came out my son and I ordered coffee. He only bought one creamer. We ask for more creamer and it took him about 10 minutes to get the creamer to us. That is a long time in the restaurant world just to get creamer. For the most part that's understandable if you're rushing and simply forgot. We are all human. When we ordered a coffee refill, we also ordered more sugar packets, he came back with the coffees but this time no creamer. We ask for creamer and again reminded him of the sugar packets. The creamer came but the sugar never made it. 

This is not an isolated incident, I've been here 3-4 times on different days of the week and different times and the service is pretty much the same. You generally have to get the servers attention to be taken care of once you make your initial order. I would actually give this place 2 stars but bumped it up to 3 because, well, they have a bar...come on, tell me that's not worth the extra star.",3MwccEgTNoXgc-en9e7Qzw,2,0,3,yiT55XCAToe6chwTQIfBQA
