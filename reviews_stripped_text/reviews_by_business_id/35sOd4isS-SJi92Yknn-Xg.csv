This place is way-off the strip and not intended for party weekenders.  it is for serious fine food lovers. 
Believe me this is no fake italian-theme garbage joint for tourists on the strip!

My Wife and I requested an item which is normally off the menu but available in authentic high-end Italian Ristorantes: SEPPIA 
(a type of Octopus indigenous to the Mediterranean sea with its own particular, distinctive, great, flavor) 
and boy! was it great.
not only was the Seppia dish great but the Chef really outdid himself!
I found flavors and spices I had never tasted before and in such combinations that gave this experience a new dimension.
it was like listening to mono audio, then moving to Stereo then Dolby surround 5.1 sound coming at you from all directions.

I truly believed that Chefs were the masters of exaggeration
when they spoke of ""incredible flavors and Heavenly  taste""
but now I see what they're talking about.

Even the pastas had incredible sauces and toppings of fresh goat cheese and hints of  Fresh basil and other ""secret spices"" they would not reveal.  to my Amazement even the bartender knew exactly what I wanted when I requested a Sangria with Rioja wine. he even went out of his way to dice-up fresh citrus fruits to give us the REAL Sangria.

Needless to say Bella luna has become our favorite Restaurant in las Vegas.   no wonder it was declared ""Best Italian Restaurant in Las Vegas"" Even Mr. Wolfgang puck rated it ""Best in las Vegas""

When in Vegas I truly recommend checking out this place.
or if you're a ""local"" it will become your ""regular"" Ristorante.
even the Casino owners have made this their private joint and are  ""regulars"" as Bella the owner told us, when we saw the owner of the PALMS Casino, there, on our second visit.
it is a few minutes off the strip but you will agree it was well worth it.

My friends and I came here to eat on a Friday night and we were excited to eat here as it seemed like it would be a nice place and I had read the lone other review here on yelp which raves about this place (edit: which is now strangely missing) .  The first tell tale sign that something was amiss is that there were only two other tables occupied (on a Friday night at 7pm!).  The service was passable but the food was terrible.  We could not believe the price of this place for how bad the food was. Unless they do something serious to improve, I can't imagine this place will be around for much longer because I can't imagine anyone coming back to eat here and I have to guess that that's why it was so dead.",jfOOCZa2YNP0kMbPEqEuCg,0,0,1,rXNsRl-GdBhGS37I92awKg

The bass was one of the better fish dishes I have had in a long time.  The atmosphere was very pleasant and they have recently added some nice artwork.  I definitely like the atmosphere here better than Nora's and the food is better as well.  The only thing I would like to see is a better wine selection.  Most of their wine is Italian and Italy has had some bad vintages from 2001 through 2004.  They are not very good values.  They could really use some good Spanish or Australian wine on there.

We will definitely be back.",mem_x06uQ9glSCKWHltGng,0,0,4,GefnLbl45eA_qJm36wTqLg
