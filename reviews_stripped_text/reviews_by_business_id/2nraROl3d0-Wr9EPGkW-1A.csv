They worker didn't greet me, just stared at me until I told him what I wanted. Then the cashier said he couldn't except my $10 bill that I just received grom the casino and suggested I go to the change machine, another inconvienence. They need some training because their customer service skills are lacking. I will not return this location ever again.",dtPFk9AN9ZAzXUyTrlwqug,0,0,1,F31adoOv7U7FaK9zHzQqLg

It seems like they are always busy being new to the hotel so they are always baking fresh bread. They have a nice seating area also, the only down side is that it's in a casino so they have inflated prices. This would be why they get a four star not five......",n_Vzepb6aEwmPDtz-ISshA,1,0,4,ehhkBGe1q-yY4CzscRTDZA

The food is on par with the rest of the Subway chain restaurants. There is an ample seating area, but it is open air to the casino so the sounds and smells drift in.",ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw,2,2,3,Njin7JLOv8krZJJUDI8DcA

Located inside the Suncoast, next to their 24/7 cafe.  And since the cafe has altered its menu, I tend to venture over to the Subway.",iwQsBQDrpQirBmmCxmzLeQ,0,0,5,wW_ySFtHvx3y64SKO9eVmQ

Second time I ordered from an older woman who proceeded to hover after I paid and was getting a lid and straw for my soda, presumably because she thought I was derelict and going to steal something?  Who knows.  It was annoying and unappreciated.  I got my room card out so that it was visible that I wasn't some hobo patronizing the casino subway, lol",LUQELe311NB7-le5JE0w-w,0,0,3,OVeQlfoYCniIjMLyLSJw-Q
