1162070,2010-09-03,0,slx9qstc2U2Tc4s7dzbbBg,"After reading in the Talk forum recently about where to get the best Thai food in Vegas, my appetite for Thai food was stimulated, so I decided to revisit a couple of my favorite places that received mention in the forum.  At both places I ordered my favorite Thai dish, which is Chicken Panang.

At  Basil 'n Lime, the waitress asked me how hot I wanted the Panang on a scale of 1 to 10, and I opted for 5.  I was satisfied with the spiciness of the dish, and although it was definitely sweet, the sweetness did not detract from my enjoyment.  It came with bell peppers and green peas and only a trace of basil.  

(I was a little surprised that the Panang was served with green peas instead of carrots, because other (Chinese/Thai) restaurants where I had ordered the dish in the past served it with carrots.  I don't pretend to know which way is authentic, but I assume that green peas are the authentic ingredient because that is how it was served at Prommares as well.  Anyway, I have no complaints, as I enjoy it either way.)

My friend got the Laos style Fresh Green Papaya Salad.  She was a little disappointed that she couldn't distinctly see or taste any papaya, and thought it would make a better appetizer than entree.  She has had other dishes at Basil 'n Lime that she enjoyed more.

We ordered no appetizers, beverages (other than water), or dessert, and our bill came to only $20 and some change, which I thought was very reasonable.

Located on the corner end of a strip mall, Basil 'n Lime has a colorful, festive facade and a spacious and airy interior.  Pleasant music played softly, and the service was friendly.  The restrooms were clean and easily accessible.  

I think most people who like Thai food would find Basil 'n Lime enjoyable and satisfying in terms of taste, price, service, and atmosphere.  I'm sure I'll be back.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,1,0,4,cZ80F_AZoCbITE4lwSD7bg

Ordered my food at the maximum amount of spiciness, tasted like it included zero spicy spices. I had to make extremely liberal use of the spice tray the lady brought out for me.

Service was excellent, the waitress was attentive and very nice. Drinks were kept full and empty plates were taken away quickly.

Even though the service was excellent the food was definitely not, and maybe it's because I'm white that they gave me the ""Americanized"" 10/10 hot level, but that's a complete joke. 10/10 should be ghost pepper status or something, not a dash of cayenne and a sprinkle of red pepper flake.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,1,0,2,x8YbYnWYB6pfO75W7-G1zw

Inside, the restaurant was bigger than most Thai restaurants.  We were greeted upon entering and seated quickly.  I had the Pad Thai lunch special for $7.95.  You get to choose between the soup of the day (chicken noodle the day I went) and a salad with peanut sauce.  I chose the salad and it was great (then again, I love anything with peanut sauce).  The Pad Thai was a super large portion.  I ended up splitting it in half right then and there to take the other half home for dinner.  It was also accompanied by an egg roll. 

Again, service was great -- a super quick lunch -- made it back to work within an hour, even though this place was about 5 miles away.

First things first, the lunch specials are amazing. Under $9 for a lot of options is damn nice. 

So, the things I had: Larb chicken with white rice, pad thai with chicken, papaya salad, both chicken and beef satay, and some steamed dumplings. I know, don't judge me.

Larb chicken I ordered decently spicey, and it was. Chicken was done well, and the veggies/salad was fresh enough. I was a little taken back by the fact there was next to no lime flavor in the dish. Considering that should be apart of the flavor profile of the dish, in the description and restaurant name, you'd think it'd be included? Guess not. Still a good dish regardless.

Papaya salad - not bad. Was decently crunchy and fresh with the ingredients not being mushy. Again, my complaint, too sweet of a sauce and not enough sour from some citrus. This may be a personal thing, but, it's worth noting for those that want some sour with Thai dishes that should have a kick of sour and sweet to them.

Pad thai chicken, ordered at a 5 spicy level - not bad. Noodles were cooked well enough and you got some good slabs of chicken in there, which was very nice. Thought the dish was overly lacking in veggies though, and was just noodles tossed with chicken. Which, isn't overly bad, but, I could have swore pad thai was noodles, veggies and a meat tossed together. 

Satays with spicy peanut sauce. Well... they were tough pieces of meat with peanut butter. Very lacking of flavor overall. Very disappointed.

Steamed dumplings were a solid menu item though, especially with the sauce. Was very happy to have gotten these, as it's hard to find steamed dumplings these days with everyone looking to fry or deep fry them. Cabbage on the outside with ground chicken, some spice, and some veggies, good stuff.

Finding the restaurant wasn't difficult, but for first-time visitors, note that it sits back from the road in a store front.  Keep your eyes pealed and you won't miss the bright ""Basil 'n Lime"" sign mounted high on the front.  I've visited for lunch, dinner, and a few times in between and have never seen the placed very busy.  If you see the same thing when you arrive, don't let the lack of a large crowd fool you: go in, take a seat and enjoy.  

For a relatively small restaurant, the menu has quite a bit of variety.  I've sampled something from every part of the menu except the ""Top Secret"" section and nothing failed to satisfy.  The food is authentic Thai cuisine, cooked fresh when ordered, and many of the meat dishes will accommodate your preference for chicken, beef or seafood.  Finally, the customer can specify their preference for heat (spicy) on a 1-10 scale.  Noteworthy about this is across my visits, the spiciness of the dishes I order is consistent: a seven this time is equally hot as a seven the next time.  I've also varied the heat of a dish to see if it makes a difference.  The cooks truly vary the heat as requested.

If you're a fan of authentic Thai food, give Basil 'n Lime a try.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,1,4,kHMtqB26g6LVVyzI11GYxQ

I hate have to edit his review...

I ordered one of their lunch specials which came with an egg roll. When I bit into the egg roll I felt something really hard. At first I thought it was a bone but then realized there shouldn't be any bones in an egg roll. I saw that it was a 3/4 inch bolt. 
   I informed the waitress about it and her reaction was priceless. I won't repeat what she said but it made me chuckle. Unfortunately the management didn't do anything about it. It seemed as though they wanted to ignore the situation. I barely got an apology from the waitress and a scoop of ice cream for free. 
   If it were anywhere else I'm sure I would have at least gotten the meal for free if not somewhat of a discount.
   If I weren't a nice person I could have taken a picture of, if not the actual egg roll and contacted a lawyer. But I figured it was an accident and chalked it up to just that.
   But when I asked if the egg rolls were pre-packaged or hand made they informed me that they are made fresh in the restaurant. I could understand something like that being passed up by inspection from a conveyor belt, but what I don't understand is how a 3/4 inch bolt was overlooked if they were rolled by hand. Hmmm.
   I was afraid of my lunch from that point onward. It could have really done some damage.

The restaurant itself is pretty large with modern-ish decor in comparison to other Thai restaurants. They have strings of Christmas lights up in an artsy fashion. It ain't Christmas, but tis the season - it works with the overall feel of the restaurant. The boyfriend and I walked into an empty restaurant with the exception of a party of 6 finishing up their meal on a Saturday night. We were greeted by one of the waitresses and seated at a table. 

We ordered Thai tea, beef pad see ew, and chicken ginger and mushroom. The thai tea kind of rubbed me the wrong way. It tasted super powdery but this is most likely because I didn't mix well enough. We waited for a while before our dishes were brought out to us. We're very patient people but for us to wonder when our food will be at our table is a tell tale sign that they're taking way too long. Annoying, since we were essentially the only ones in the restaurant. But we gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured they were making our food ultra fresh.

What we didn't realize when ordering was that their portions (at least for dinner) are huge! The two dishes were pretty good. Not the best we've ever had, but we had no major complaints. The chicken ginger and mushroom is quite misleading by name. The dish didn't have that extra bite of ginger I was searching for. Where were the mushrooms? They were hiding and didn't want to come out. There were a lot of other veggies though - carrots, onions, bell peppers. Good portion of chicken, which I appreciated. The beef pad see ew had a good amount of beef as well. They definitely don't shy away from your protein portions! Basil 'n Lime serves their pad see ew with regular broccoli. Perhaps this is consumer's preference but I definitely like my pad see ew with Chinese broccoli, not regular American broccoli. I feel as though Chinese broccoli gives the ample amount of crunch that a chewy dish such as pad see ew really needs. Both dishes were at a heat level of 5/10. I'll tell you what - heat level 5 barely scratched the capsaicin receptors on my tongue! If you like medium-spicy as I do, you should probably bump it up a notch to a 6, maybe a 7 if feeling a little brave. 

I'm not sure if I'll be back for dinner anytime soon. But I hear they have great lunch specials. I'm more than open to take a stab at one of those if given the time and opportunity.",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,0,0,3,CR9TXpQAYLNpaoV1jZi5Pg

It's not in a class with either Archi's or Lotus of Siam, but you will get a good meal, very personable service, and the prices are very affordable. 

Their Papaya Salad is fair, and it's just okay for what I call ""American Favorites"" for Thai food are better than most places in town. I have done well staying with the Chicken Dishes, my friends have tried a variety of other entrees, and seem to be satisfied. 

My son is impressed with the quality of the Thai Iced Tea.

Overall, you won't be raving when you leave, but you will not feel that you made a mistake, and you won't feel that you overspent.

It is very large, so you probably won't wait for a table, so it's good for groups.

The fresh vegetables were sautéed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.

Thai BBQ Chicken, no issues here, flavor is plentiful and dipping sauce was not needed.

First time I came was great- The second time I came here, I found that the food was extremely sweet.. The pad thai and even tom yum was more sweet than sour.

I got a level 3 spicy and that was not hot at all for me, so next time I'll up the ante for sure.",9bs9A6Po48gzCIYwEnWeVw,0,0,5,vOacNfNaXLet2iNDR-VrJw

The price was very reasonable. We came here around 4pm and it was dead, only one other person. I hope that this place gets business it deserves. The sign is so cute, I was just driving and looking for a place to go and quickly just turned in here.... the inside was nice and clean and decorated minimal but elegant. I am going to be going back here.

My sister ordered the green chicken curry and I got the the tom kai gow (chicken soup with lots of coconut flavoring, has mushrooms, lime juice and cilantro- the flavor is amazing!) I always order this soup when I go for thai food now...

I'll post pictures, looks really good...but in this case the food is better then it looks.  ;)",bEhO6RG2rgf-jFAv0th0gA,1,1,4,bxx72hZc1h9oil8pioO9bg

The Thai restaurant's 40-demerit C grade was for continued non-compliance with Health District rules.Inspectors found lots of mold on zucchini and cucumber. There was also expired tomato sauce and curry ranging from two weeks to more than a month old.When Action News asked to speak to the person in charge, an employee gets on the phone to call the boss, then comes back to say, ""I don't know, he said he not want you to, like... show this or something.""Inspectors found a big pot of curry on the floor. The restaurant also thought the floor -- which was dirty and pooled with standing water -- was a good place for eggs and woks.Food stored on a dirty floor is bad enough, but an employee's purse on the prep table is particularly disturbing since several studies show women's purses can be dirtier than toilets. There was also food stored at unsafe temperatures, uncovered food subject to contamination, or dirty conditions.

I ate there today 9/7/16 and they still have the C demerit displayed on the wall 3 months later. I pray I dont get sick.",1PHVlRRHZmGTQQt4_zEBAA,6,0,1,wBcZx9mokip6oQx2JtQbXQ

My pad see ew was delicious and the portion was nice. The salad that comes with the lunch special was merely iceberg lettuce with some satay peanut sauce poured on it. The Thai iced tea was refreshing and not too strong. The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because as friendly as our waitress was, she forgot to give us our check at the end of the meal. Then once we asked for it, she still took so long that we finally walked up to the order counter and asked for it there.

We actually gave this place several tries and ordered different dishes. More than half were barely edible so yeah, pretty bad. 

For instance, ordered a tomato based soup, and instead of tomatoes it was clearly ketchup based! I also ordered a classic Thai dish off their lunch menu, ""ground chicken with basil"". The portion was fair (although they only gave 1 small scoop of rice), but it was quite oily and the color was off, more of a turmeric color.  Anyhow, I did get sick from it (stomach cramps, etc.). 

Bottom line, I won't be eating there again, and can't recommend this place. Plenty of decent and better Thai restaurants in the area.",qy0Ujcv9-t_pnQ1w5QJgcQ,0,1,1,wjTHskXapzcF5l1zHh-lNQ
