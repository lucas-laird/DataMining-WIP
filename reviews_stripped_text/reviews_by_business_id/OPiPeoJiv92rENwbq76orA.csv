They tasted great but later at 3am they were not that great. I woke up with painful stomach cramps, excessive gas and continuous  liquid bowel movements. By 6am the worse was over and I was able to get back to sleep without soiling my bed. Throughout this ordeal the stench of rancid opinions was overwhelming ( New York Dog ) which reminded me of how tart the sauerkraut was that also accompanied the NY Dog. 
Was it the opinions, was it the sauerkraut? Who knows, maybe it was both!!!",zBZsHp1WjHCoZqOD2YrtUA,1,1,1,x2ID0SqLekuxkV2vs6FTQA

When it came, my Honey Mustard and Swiss Chicken Club sandwich was wrong. They had given me a Chicken Club Toaster. Not the same sandwich at all, one has a cibatta roll and swiss cheese AND bacon, the other is on Texas toast with American cheese. The runner went back in to get the manager (not sure why they couldn't just fix it). The manager came out with total attitude saying that she would fix it, but she just wanted to inform us that the chicken clubs are made on toast. Really, because your menu says otherwise dumbass. So, after another hefty waiting period, they brought out the correct sandwich. Best part, they used the exact same  sandwich from the first order, tore off the american cheese and slapped an un melted piece of swiss onto it and tossed it on onto  a cibatta roll. Left out the bacon, which I might add is the most serious offense of the whole freakin' experience. By the time it was actually in my hands, my family had finished eating and my sandwich was ice cold.

But wait, there's more.  To my hubby's dismay, his cherry limeade was missing their signature limes in the cup. Fail. Epic fail.

This Sonic is our go to place when we want a quick and easy dinner or breakfast. It has been somewhat of our tradition having their breakfast burrito, cheese tots, and a java chiller on a lazy Sunday morning. There are evenings when we just pick up a mash up of different offerings for dinner: cheese tots, 5 pc chicken tender, mozza sticks, and a grilled chicken sandwich to share. The prices are reasonable, the food quality above par in the fast food (possibly other Sonics) realm, and the staff is always extremely polite. Our order has never been screwed up, and that is very important to us because my husband has a strong aversion to certain ingredients.

I ordered an All American dog combo but only wanted ketchup and mustard on the dog, nothing else it came with.  As I drove up I heard the employee say, ""If the guy who ordered the ketchup and mustard hot dog ordered this differently, he could have saved money....just saying.""  I heard this and decided to not say anything and complain to corporate.  Whether she was correct or not, talking about customers and loud enough to hear you is unacceptable.  I emailed corporate and all they sent me 3 days later was a survey.  No call from the manager.  No apology.

Since they have this promo weekly during the summer it pays to get there early!!!and just wait it out.  The half price shakes start at 8pm. The slush is a text special.   If you haven't already subscribed  the Sonic Drive In text message now is the time to do so.

2953395,2018-04-02,0,OPiPeoJiv92rENwbq76orA,"Been going here for years, especially during the half price shakes promotions they do every year.  Got large strawberry, caramel, and hot fudge Friday night March 31, 2018 at around 9pm.  It was packed so they were a little slower than usual, and a guy got pulled over by the cops and was even forced to put his hands on the hood of his truck so I'm sure the workers were busy looking at that going down. We froze the shakes for Easter Sunday the next day.  Come to find out there was no caramel in the large caramel shake.  After church went back to Sonic with the receipt and cup to show there was no caramel residue at all at around 4:30pm but the young lady said the manager said it had to be the same day for them to give us a new shake or whatever.  I think that's b.s. because they were really slow in filling out our order because of gawking at the guy with his hands on the hood of his truck because of the cops.  We've been there when it was packed before and it wasn't as slow as it was Friday night, all because the employees were looking at that traffic stop, and we never had an order messed up especially the shakes, so the workers were obviously preoccupied with the cops investigating that pick up truck driver to put caramel in the shake.  So we get stiffed on the caramel shake and now the time and gas to go back to the location because they wouldn't rectify the situation.

It has been 379 days since my last slip.  I tried so hard and it all seemed so innocent...

Oh, you are oh so convenient with your bright, inviting lights & 24 hour drive ""thru"" .  Then that friendly voice welcomes me to Sonic & I request to wait, since I just pulled up.  After a few moments of hesitation between a foot long chili cheese Coney & a breakfast burrito, I do what all addicts do: I order BOTH.  Then, as I pull up, can't help but notice the condescending gaze of the attendant as she looks down into my little toy of a car, while being spotlighted in an even brighter, almost judging, light. 

So, it all goes to plan, I have my stash of breakfast burrito and a tube steak in a boat of bread, meat gravy, & cheese whiz.  All packed with care?  I get home and spread it all out in front of the TV.  Bathed in the otherworldly glow of some Amazon Prime original series, I attack my chili dog with the nearly useless plastic fork.

The traditional method for consuming this ""Coney"" starts with tearing the foil paper & breaking open the front of the paper trough so you can try to bite this cheesy, greasy, chili covered 12 incher. I use the fork to stab & break off a piece so big, I nearly gag.  I think to myself, ""Oh, the price I have to pay will be well worth my time.""  How could I be so wrong?

Since I am on a roll & feeling so good about myself, I tear into the steaming hot breakfast burrito.  I swear the little plastic packets of mustard & salsa mock me from the bottom of the bag.  Now, I finally realize, I have relapsed.  There is no turning back.  I will continue to eat & defile myself and probably wake up behind a Whole Foods wondering how my life came to this...

I wake up a few hours later.  
I feel dirty.
As I belch, it feels like gasoline is issuing forth from my pores...
This morning, I start afresh.
I will try to pull my life together.  
Again.  
And this time, 
maybe,
I will remember my hallowed mantra: 

ONLY GO TO SONIC FOR DRINKS AT HAPPY HOUR",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,1,1,3,w1DdIBR9cZIJ2Qd3qQSw_A

The Arches...The King...The KFC...who will I go to for my greasy lil' treat?  Most times I end up at Sonic!

I like hitting Sonic during their awesome 'Happy Hour' from 2-4 PM for 1/2 off drinks!  And boy do those drinks hit the sweet spot.  I love my Route 44 (gigantor size for you Sonic virgins) in some of my go to flavors:

-Diet. Dr. Pepper or Diet Coke with Low-Cal Diet Cherry
-Low-Cal Diet Cherry Limeade
-Sweet Tea
-Ocean Water (hint of coconut)
-Blue Coconut Slush (mix with tequila and rum anyone??)

And always, ALWAYS with extra ice!  It's your ultimate drink stop!  Besides the drinks the menu has nice choices for snackin'.  I can order off the 'Everyday Value Menu', where I'll get a Jr. Deluxe Burger or a Chicken Strip Sandwich, and a small order of Tots.  Winnah, winnah, cheap A$$ dinnah!  

If I've been really good with my diet during the week, I'll give in a little and gets me a hot dog!  I really like the Footlong Quarter Pound Coney, with extra onions and add mustard please!  God, I am such a glutton.  I recently had Sonic's take on The Chicago Dog and it was pretty good too.  And...I'm back to the treadmill.

Nope...the food ain't gourmet...and yep...it's a chain...but this place stays so busy!  Gotta love the drive-in aspect, the ordering boards right next to your parking space, and the window service.  Very old school and fun for the kids to see.  Service is always fast and friendly so it keeps me coming back.

So after 8pm shakes are half off, this time I opted for a cherry pineapple in medium (2.99 for med) and a jr deluxe burger no onion or tomato. 

So I press the button and the lady comes on. I give her our order and mind you I speak verrryyy clearly and slow so she can understand. She repeats the order ""you want 2 double cheeseburgers no onions?"" AHHH! NOOOO!! 1 jr deluxe burger no onion no tomato. She spits the order out again and it seems to be correct and gives us the total which is like 5$ over. So I sit there in awe and push the button to ask how this came about. Ohh I forgot to give you the discount for the meal. So the total is now 2$less. I ask her to repeat my order and again she includes the double cheeseburgers! I politely tell her no, and repeat what I wanted.

At this point in time Im like wtf? I cant find a job but they hire this yodle to work here?! So out comes our car hop. She repeats our order and what comes out of her mouth? 1 jr deluxe burger... the 1 thing I CANNOT STAND IS TOMATO. It legit makes me puke!! So I look at my burger and low and behold TOMATO AND ONIONS! Im about to go ape shit as we are leaving, like seriously? I have spoke slowly and clearly and told you my order 3 times and you STILL cannot get it right? WTF!? Plus my shake tasted like garbage AND she didnt give me a full discount on it!

Now I wouldnt be a little jerk, but if I tell you an order like 100 times, it should be correct! I didnt call and complain I just ended up tossing the onions and tomato and wiping the tomato remnants off my burger.

My favorite thing to get is the Strawberry or Watermelon Cream slush. I love the cream slush because they use real ice cream and real fruit in your drink!! Not that it makes it any healthier--but it tastes really good!

I like how the order window shows exactly what you order and you can pay right there with your credit card, or you can pay your food server when they skate on out. 

We have ordered the cheeseburgers here and I guess  because we were in the mood for them, they were delicious! Hot and juicy and filled with  lettuce, onion, tomatoes, pickles and condiments. Its a pretty big one, and I always share. we have never been disappointed . Have to get the tater tots with them, and jalapeno poppers.

KUDOS:
- They have two food items on the menu that I used to get all the time, but not so much any more:  root beer floats that you can request to be blended when you order (that's how I like 'em); and, tater tots. You can get the special fry sauce for the tater tots and fries, a combo of mayo and ketchup.  My son and I would come through the drive-thru at least once a week for blended root beer floats back in the day. It's comfort food, for sure, and oh so good!  
- The ice they put in their drinks is crushed, but there's something special, I don't know what it is.  It's so popular that they even sell it by the bag. 
- Sonic still has the old-school park and eat concept.  You can pull up, park, order over the intercom, and your order is brought out by someone on skates.
- Happy Hour for the drinks, of which there are plenty to choose from:  slushes, limeades, sodas, sweet or unsweetened iced teas (regular or green). 2:00-4:00pm

GRIPES:
- Really not healthy for you, but, hey, you don't come to Sonic to eat healthy.
