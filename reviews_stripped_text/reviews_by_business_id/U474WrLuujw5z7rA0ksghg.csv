The most recent time my order was delivered in less Jan 30 minutes! The food is great, especially for the price. The pizza is always fresh and tastes like they use real ingredients.

I spoke to Joe (owner). He assured me that the pizza was definitely better than the main stream pizza you have everywhere else. So, after thinking it over I decided to give it a try. I had the pizza and wings delivered. The delivery was very prompt. So upon opening the box I was mesmerized on the presentation of the pizza. It looked as though it was waiting to be eaten so much so I couldn't wait to grab a slice. The first bite was amazing the first thought that came into my mind was FUCK!! Goddamn delicious (pepperoni and sausage) one the best pizza I've had since moving to Vegas. To use a catch phrase from a burger joint it's quality you can taste. The wings were large not some scrawny sick chicken wings you get from P/H or Dom or that papa place. So worth the money so worth the time so worth the effort I am a customer for life highly recommend to all will be ordering again soon especially since the Stanley cup playoffs are on and what goes with hockey besides Heineken, Marco's Pizza!!!",pk1dbhIF2hnZZH8y9-OK8A,0,0,5,mZNx8vqAct_gR--aUnoVBQ

We were in town visiting friends and they wanted to check out this new pizza place in their neighborhood. Not sure what's up with the negative reviews- not our experience at all!

We had 6 people in our party- we ordered online and it was ready by the time we got there. The online platform was really easy to use and even gave an estimated wait time for the order. We tried the chicken fresco pizza, a garden salad and grabbed cheese and pepperoni pizzas for the kids.

Pros
- garlic butter crust: our picky eater devoured it and he NEVER eats the crust. We were shocked!
- the chicken fresco was TASTY! My only regret was not trying it with ranch as it would have been a perfect compliment to the bacon and chicken. 
- Super clean!
- the pizza was fresh, and they don't cheap out on the toppings. The quality was def much better than the other guys
- Plenty of seating available. They were slammed but most of their business seems to be carry out/ delivery
- We had two toddlers and appreciate that they had high chairs 

Cons:
- Although they had bottled cold soda for sale, I wish they had a soda fountain with ice. Not the end of the world! 

We shall be back soon to try out the magnifico!",OSptul92zlc4UXpKdnRQ4w,1,1,5,nTXGGAQb3_AVUJlM8Y5TkQ

2462783,2018-04-04,1,U474WrLuujw5z7rA0ksghg,"If you are reviewing pizza, seriously, don't ever complain about how greasy it is. That's just silly talk right there. All pizza is greasy, even pizza of the french bread variety. If it's not greasy, you're eating sucky pizza. And no one likes sucky pizza, not even the biggest pizza fans in the world. 

For me, Marco's Pizza passes the greasy test. I think their grease ratio is quite perfect actually. So when we go here we get the same thing every time. Honestly, I'm one of those people that once I find something I like I stick with it - variety is not always the spice of life. So much like everyone else, I agree that the old world pepperoni is amazeballs. I'm so disappointed I didn't know about this garlic butter crust option though. I'm so getting that next time.

Also, I'm a huuuuuge fan of their BBQ wings. I always get them to go and by the time I get home they are a bit soggy - which I LOVE. Chicken always falls off the bone, not stringy like when they get way over cooked. The amount of BBQ sauce is almost always perfect.

In closing, say yes to grease. Say yes to old world pepperoni. Say yes to Marco's Pizza. It's good.",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,3,1,5,MHrD38oP2r_w06EC-vePrQ
