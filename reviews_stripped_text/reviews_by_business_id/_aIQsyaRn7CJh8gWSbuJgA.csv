214319,2014-10-13,0,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"My history with Ichiban dates back 10 years when I first began eating at their original location at Bally's. Their quaint comfortable atmosphere and highly attentive wait staff was what drew me to their establishment each time and every visit was always topped off with great food, particularly their rice bowls and dinner specials which never disappoint.  

What a surprise upon visiting Ichiban West that it was actually their new location, and I must say it even tops the original! The interior is beautiful and easily ranks among the best I've seen for a Japanese restaurant in the city (or any place for that matter). Because they are no longer located in Bally's their prices are not as expensive and you're still receiving the same quality service, if not better. 

One of the kind ladies recognized me as one of the former regulars of the old location, so I really appreciate her for that. I will definitely be returning here as often as I did before. I ordered the shio salmon dinner and it was a wonderful trip down memory lane. The only difference now is that they no longer serve breakfast during mornings, but that is a minor issue that won't be missed. 

Whether you were a fan of the Bally's location or having never tried it, either way you won't be disappointed with Ichiban West. The original Ichiban was a true gem of Las Vegas in a time before the wave of Japanese restaurants began to populate the city. Ichiban West takes what the original had and improved the experience.",kYqYJ7L-JFitKgNpzmd_Tw,2,0,5,JqZdF6D2lizD1Xk76asWlg

250284,2014-10-13,0,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"Tucked away in a corner of the strip mall, this Japanese restaurant is a hidden gem. The location is convenient with plenty of parking. 

Inside of the restaurant, it's very clean and nicely decorated. I felt very comfortable when we were seated. 

I ordered the tonkatsu donburi and it was delicious. The portion was very generous and the taste was fantastic. Also the dish was visually pleasing for me as well. 

They are relatively new to this location, they were previously located at the Bally's casino. The staff and owner of this restaurant were very attentive and friendly. Ichiban West is now one of my go to places for Japanese food and I will most certainly be back in the future.",J-mPpd8pmA2u0vs1zD11Tg,1,0,5,L30uBkBG5tCwnx2hhEOvDQ

This place has it all: great, authentic Japanese food, great service, and all at a great price. I couldn't believe that we ordered a teriyaki chicken, tempura bento box and a 8 Pc sushi roll all for a little more than $22 (the price I paid for a full salad/sandwich at Panera across the street the day before when I saw Ichiban West). Not to mention, the owner is also a very nice Japanese lady and the staff are all really nice Japanese people.  Really enjoyed the place and will be back for more great Japanese dining.",P6xEvy81jCcZou4ptag-BQ,0,0,5,uXvuJe4nAyynZ79E-6P4WQ

My favorite here is Chirashi, and that's what the owner takes pride in - generous portion of fresh sashimi. On your first visit, be sure to order Chirashi, and don't judge before ordering one.

At Bally's they offered traditional Japanese breakfast, but it's no longer available here. :( :(

Anyway, I hope they continue to do well at this location for years to come.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,1,1,4,W75nH6Kp5suugmcccpX16Q
2252038,2014-10-16,0,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"I was elated to discover that the great Ichiban that existed in Bally's did not eternally close, but relocated to Fort Apache and reopened as Ichiban West! Look for it in the corner of a little strip small it shares with Perfect Scoop and Mashisoyo. 

Ichiban West is run by the same owner and chef from the original site, and fortunately the food and service are still great! Their donburi/rice bowls are my favorites. The sushi is quality. Check out the lunch menu. The staff is very attentive and gracious to serve you. If you become a regular, they'll never forget you and make you know it.  

What puts Ichiban West over the original are the now-off-Strip pricing and an interior that is more spacious and exquisite. The old location had a cramped space more suitable for a ramen shop. Ichiban West is a more comfortable place to dine at. It's elegant and relaxing, away from the bustle of the Strip. 

It's only a shame that the new location is in a far less convenient place. Don't let that deter you though! The original Ichiban was a premier Japanese restaurant in Las Vegas for many years and they deserve the continuous recognition.",BQK9UQhwLZFzcIqKrOWL1w,2,0,5,xCvHz8AtfvgB5CQErf9N2A
2409981,2014-09-27,0,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"Recommendation: A must try!! The sushi was very tasty, clean with great flavor, with a nice presentation. We shared 3 apps and 3 rolls. We went in hungry and new it was a lot for the two of us but ended up a great deal and well worth trying them all. Each dish was better than the next. We both agreed that the Hawaiian roll was one of the best rolls we've ever had!! AND we've had a lot. Poke on top of a roll..who wouldn't like that! We also had the Las Vegas and the Ichiban rolls, both highly recommended too. The yellow tail carpaccio was amazing and much thicker, in a good way, than most that we've had around town. The dinner items looked tasty. Can't remember them at the moment (food comma), but I would like to go back and try some day. However, it will be hard not to order those specially sushi rolls again. As for the ambiance, traditional feel and very clean. The service was great. Like I said, a must try!",uJsoXytOKTTNvvSXXFjhrQ,0,0,5,pW3Fmnp7yVq9uSZNfugmtw

2778567,2014-12-10,1,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"Located in the spot previously occupied by Nagoya in the small strip mall in the southwest corner of Tropicana and Fort Apache, Ichiban West was dead inside when we arrived around 6pm on a recent Friday night. It's a nicely decorated, modern interior with a sushi bar and plenty of tables and booths along with a private dining room off to one side.

The food was decent but didn't live up to the stellar service we received. The yellowtail jalapeño had a much lighter color than typical yellowtail -- almost as if it was recently defrosted. The shrimp tempura roll was well crafted with ample spicy tuna and shrimp throughout. Arriving at our table next was the Hawaiian roll. I didn't know what to make of it when placed on the table. It was basically a roll with a salad on top. The menu said a seaweed salad, but it appeared to be regular lettuce along with onions and radishes. The spicy tuna in the roll was unusually hot, enough so that it had me reaching for water with every bite. The noodles and broth in the hot soba were well prepared with good depth in the broth. There was also plenty of dark meet chicken to go with it.

With decent food and great service, Ichiban might become a good neighborhood spot for those living in the immediate area, but they'll need to up their game to stay around for the long haul.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,2,3,ifMersVFqAMiW6DpM7Ri1w

4411658,2015-01-02,1,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"We came on a Sunday night and there was only one other table. The interior looks clean and new, but really we should have turned around and left the moment we stepped inside. I'm particularly sensitive to greasy smoky restaurant smell and well this place smelled like rancid grease. Not sure what is going on with their ventilation system, if they even have a functioning one...

Service wasn't bad. After sitting down, getting water and ordering, our server relayed a message from the kitchen that the wait will be longer than expected due to a large takeout order...We thought about just leaving then and tipping for water service. Usually I don't mind a little wait, but the smell was agonizing. Ultimately, we decided to stay for the food, but I had to go outside in the cold a couple of times for some fresh air. 

The food came within the timeframe given by our server and it was okay, though not nearly good enough for me to sit through another meal inside. If the weather is nice I might be convinced to come back and dine in the outdoor area. Seriously though, the decor looks clean and like someone put some thought into it, so why go cheap with the ventilation?!",ZKwO9lkpAnOnQlBL1fXf1w,1,0,2,UUmJ-tHcxxB7L9VPpjvULA

5250885,2014-12-06,0,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"Went here for lunch on a Friday. The opening time for lunch is 11:30 am (not 11 am as noted on yelp). The business changed the opening time at some point (times clearly edited on door). We needed to be done by 12 pm so we felt a little rushed. BTW, there were two other parties who also showed up around 11 am-so, I think the time changed recently or we were all using yelp.

Restaurant is clean and cozy with nice decor/tables. We all ordered lunch specials (each $8), 1) Salted saba (mackerel), 2) teriyaki salmon, 3) beef teriyaki. All came with miso (IMO could have been hotter/warmer-but likely because just opened), a small bowl of rice, the entree (all and great flavor) with a fresh salad on the plate with homemade honey mustard dressing (not Japanese ginger dressing FYI-but very tasty and fresh). 

Good meal, but I was hungrier than usual because I skipped breakfast, and I found myself hungry about an hour later (I think this partly could have been solved by more rice in the bowl-seemed a bit skimpy). 

Would we return? Yes, I think so.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,0,0,4,k0wd6PQWgQnUE8xOKfM2Yw

5928811,2014-12-28,2,_aIQsyaRn7CJh8gWSbuJgA,"We came here for dinner on a Saturday night about a month ago and this place was dead. No one was in the front when we walked in, but one of the employees quickly ran to greet us. The first thing she told us was that they were a new restaurant, so they didn't have thier alcohol license yet. Then she asked if that was okay with us. We decided to give them a try, plus that didn't apply to me since I don't drink alcohol anyway. As we walked to our table, we noticed that the restaurant was empty. I think my husband even said ""wow, no one is here"" out loud. Our server explained to us that they were real busy during lunch, but not for dinner because ""everyone wants to drink."" Obviously, LOL. The restaurant was very clean, but they had no decor. Even the TV behind the sushi bar was unplugged. 

The food was alright. Nothing outstanding, but it wasn't horrible either. I ordered the Zaru Soba and a Spicy California Roll. They gave a good portion of soba, although I have definitely tasted better. California Rolls are never anything special no matter where you go, but they took the lazy route and put some type of hot sauce on the roll. It wasn't actually mixed with the crab meat. My husband ordered the Katsu Don and a sushi roll (forgot the name) with nice presentation. He said that the food was ok. Service was friendly and attentive (as it should have been since we were the only customers there). 

Apparently this restaurant used to be at Bally's. Thier chopstick wrappers still say Bally's on them as well. Nothing special to say about this place. I think they have good service and a clean restaurant, but they need to maybe step up thier game when it comes to food. They have good potential, but thier restaurant will continue to be empty if they serve mediocre food!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,3,3,Hsf59t4tbSLwg17-wI_gtw
