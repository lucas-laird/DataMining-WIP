Ok a line at 10:30 for breakfast. That makes sense since most in the line probably got to bed after 2am.  Stops serving at 11, unless its a weekend. Do any locals eat at these crappy buffets? I doubt it. So why stop at 11? I'm tired and I want breakfast at noon!
Got in 10 min before 11 scrambling to fill up multiple plates before all the breakfast items disappear. 
syrup gone arrgh! At least the guy cooking the omelets was fast and very nice. If I had cash on my I would have tipped. I wish I could have transferred our tip from our crappy waitress to him. She was horrible. Two tables down those people in that section were having fun because of the cool waitress they had. More to piss me off.
The lunch items that were brought out were foul so that wasn't an option. At least I got 4 plates filled before I missed out on breakfast.

They have a champagne brunch on Sunday for $25 I think we skip that since we don't drink champange.  For lunch if you can wait until 3:30 you can pay for lunch and get some of the dinner foods.

Every July David and I make our trip up to Vegas for a show or two, a little gambling, shopping and of course some food! We came upon this place in 09 after receiving a coupon and decided to try it out. We went for the Champagne brunch, not bad for the price. About $20 pp. (reg brunch no coupon is about $36 for 2) They had everything I personally could ask for. Salad bar, biscuits & gravy, crab, prawns, stainless steel warming trays with poultry, beef and fish with someone to serve you in there little white coats and chef hats on the other side of the buffet table.

The spring rolls and crackers were chewy, while all the sauces were inedible. The cocktail sauce had such a strong horseradish taste that I nearly choked on it, and I'm not sure what was in the Caesar dressing but it was awful and had a weird, gritty texture (almost like sand).

First the good:

The food, it was good.  Nothing spectacular, but exactly what I expected from a buffet at the Flamingo.  Decent variety, food was fresh.  I had eggs about 300 ways (with chorizo, rancheros, breakfast burrito, benedict) and they were all good.  The shrimp cocktail was the bomb, the chocolate fountain was just kitschy enough to be fun.  I wouldn't complain.  I left full and ate nothing that was disappointing.

The blah:
The price.  Right at $50 for 2 Breakfast buffets, food only.  Not worth it.  I can't eat that much for breakfast, and I know how much eggs cost.  Breakfast buffets should never run over $20 bucks unless I can get lobster, and maybe bottomless mimosas.

The bad:
The service!   The women working the cash registers were rude.  Our server was incredibly overwhelmed, which was not the real problem.  The problem was the other servers in other areas refusing to step in and help out.  All we needed to drink were waters.  It took us 20 minutes to get water.  I tried to flag down 3 servers outside of our own who was serving tables as fast as she could and I was shrugged of by each although their areas were obviously slower than ours.  That was a major disappointment.  Our server was incredibly polite and apologetic about the wait and once she caught herself up, was very attentive.  But overall there was a lack of team work to keep things flowing and customers happy.

Overall I was happy with the food, but for 25 bucks a head I feel like I can expect decent customer service as well.  That was lacking and I would not go back or recommend this buffet to others because of this.  Sorry Flamingo, you have to do better.",pTWGTUAX867v_Kxaao5ECA,0,0,2,Ojp-b6gQnHQ1FUaiHuVu_Q

I enjoy coming to Flamingo for brunch. This is the only buffet on the strip with enormous windows, and the interior is very bright and welcoming. Ceilings are high, tables and booths are clean. Service is not fantastic--a bunch of tired old ladies serve you. 

As breakfast goes, Flamingo is mediocre but it'll do the job. Prices here are lower compared to, say, Mandalay Bay or Bellagio.

3 stars. If you want a breakfast buffet in Vegas that tastes okay and has a great view, I recommend Flamingo. I do make a stop here for brunch every year when I come to Vegas. Afterwards you can take a stroll out back to look at the flamingoes and the fish in a very natural and beautiful habitat.

I was in shock!! and then she came to a conclusion that was a vegetable soup which I doubted and there comes another staff member from the kitchen and said oh this has some chicken breast!! at that moment I just walked away from that spot simply because I didn't want to commit a crime.

The brunch itself was pretty good & I liked that we were seated right next to the window by the flamingos.

Service was bad, yet we were charged 21% gratuity regardless. (2) We signed a contract that required us to give a final count a week before our event. I gave the count, but we had a couple last minute cancellations and Linda Brookins denied a credit for those cancellations. I was aware of this as part of the contract so I'm not disputing the charge, but a few cancellations the day before would have had zero impact on Flamingo.

First, the cost - $25 per person.  Fairly standard, until you realize that they have seating for at least 400 people in the restaurant, which is usually half-filled, and only have one person pouring champagne, one person making omelettes, and then only one place to get hot food like eggs and bacon.

So what happens when the place gets full, is that you wait sometimes up to 10 MINUTES IN LINE to get a spoonful of eggs, or a couple pieces of bacon!  Want a refill on champagne? Gotta wait 5 minutes! Clearly the funding for this buffet has been sharply reduced, or it never had much at all.

Additionally, we decided to sit by the window next to what looked like a nice pond from a distance.  But when we sat down, it looked like the pond hadn't been cleaned in a very long time and there was a dead turtle floating in it!!!

We got in for cheap because we had tickets to a comedy/magic show that included the buffet all for $25. They normally charge $22 alone for the buffet at dinner.  
There was crab legs (by the beef, not where I expected to find it), crayfish, shrimp, salad bar, fruit.  The entrees were not so great, but the fried shrimp was pretty good. They were pretty nice about giving me a huge pot of water for my tea bag, better than the Bellagio in that respect.  Desserts were not as good as the Bellagio, but they do have someone making you fresh fruit crepes which hubby says the strawberries in his didn't taste good.  The coconut macaroons were very good.  If you don't mind splurging and waiting an hour in line, the Bellagio is better but if you're on a budget, the Flamingo will suffice just to keep your tummy fed.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,4,3,2,6t8hxKhKKYWRWwtGjhnY7g

Asian section had a small selection of sushi (which I didn't try), various hot items like pot stickers, pork buns, etc., fried and steamed rice, various noodle dishes, typical chinese items like beef w/veggie and Gen'l Chang's chicken. Large section of build-your-own-soup where you select the items you want in your soup and give it to someone (I didn't try this, either) to make the soup for you. A lot of people were getting this, so I'm guessing it's decent. Of the items from this section that I had the pork buns were mostly bun and very little pork .. but the pork that was in there was good. Pan fried dumplings were fine as were samosas. 

In the regular buffet section, the prime rib was a bit disappointing. Not enough flavor. The fried chicken looked pretty good, but I didn't go back for it. Mashed potatoes w/gravy were good as was the mac & cheese (although it needed to have richer flavor, IMO). There were a lot of choices, but I wasn't in the mood for most of them, so I passed. 

See .. I needed to save room for dessert. The dessert section is in the middle, so as I went to check out the Asian section, I saw what was waiting there and I knew I would not want to miss dessert. 

Pineapple upside down cake? Ok. Chocolate fountain with marshmallows, macaroons and fruit for dipping? Certainly! Cotton damn candy .. wrapped? I'll take one to go. thankyouverymuch.

This buffet is huge, but it doesn't look like it.  Make sure to walk around everywhere before making a decision.  There was an omelet station over by the windows that wasn't obvious.  And there are three different dining rooms.  The thrill of the hunt definitely comes into play here.

Also make sure to come after 11am when all the stations are open.  The Asian food stations at the end (with prime rib thrown in the mix for good measure) are amazing.  Great, unique desserts.  They also have a make your own soup station where you fill up a bowl with vegetables, noodles, and meat.  You get a choice of chicken or beef broth.  Very tasty.

The Asian station also has chicken feet, which I have never seen at a buffet.  The buffet also was serving crawfish, another unique buffet item.  A little too much work for me.

Another unique item at this buffet - they have a chocolate fountain.  Complete with custom made sneeze guard.  You have to stick your fruit, marshmallow, or rice krispies treat through a hole in the plastic to get to the chocolate.  A fun addition to a buffet.

The food was pretty good. Good variety. I loved their mountain of seafood though! That was amazing. Crabs, shrimp, crawfish. I gobbled that shiz up. Everyone always talks smack about the shrimp still being in their shell, but I thought it was normal since that's how it goes down in my house. 

Staff was a little slow, but not anything too ridiculous. They were very kind and courteous, too. 

Dessert variety was awesome! So many little delectable items. But of course, I couldn't resist the strawberry crepes with soft-serve on the side and chocolate syrup, mmmm. 

The view of the wildlife is cool, too. I love watching flamingos and ducks while I eat their distant cousins simmered in a fine sauce.

The lighting is a little depressing, tho. It takes mood lighting one step too far.

Who isn't?! I got a BOGO offer from Harrah's to tryout any of their properties buffet. I wanted to try something different. With my mom's birthday at hand, I decided to go to Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet for the breakfast buffet. 

When we arrived at the restaurant area, there was a lot of people lined up. However, it was for the Tropical Breeze Cafe. When we walked a little bit to Paradise Garden Buffet, there was another line, but it was for special guests...lol. I guess Special Guests were treated like normal customers. So, I went to the regular line and in seconds I was at a cashier while the others waited in line for minutes. 

I was greeted by Brenda. I gave her my Total Rewards Card, my coupon, my ID, and my credit card. Wow...that's a lot to give for food. Apparently, we came in during Champagne Brunch. Since it was just my mom and me, the total would have been $52.00. Whoa...$52 for two...Don't forget my coupon. My total would be $27.01. It would be $24.99 per person for Champagne Brunch.

When you do pay, they ask what you would like to drink. Its not extra charge, but its just a way to get servers tips since there is no soda fountain. We were seated by Marilou or Mary Lou and OFF TO GET FOOD!!! OMG, they had shrimp and mussels. I knew I had to fill me up. I got my eggs, sausage, this weird looking egg muffin that had no bread on top, but bread on the bottom, salmon, and hash browns. I got another plate and filled it with shrimp and mussels. YUMMO!!!

Best meal of the day. Unfortunately, my mother and I didn't take advantage of the free champagne since we don't drink. The shrimp and the mussels were the best part of the meal. It was like I was a whale and just ate the whole Pacific Ocean. Meal is a little pricey, but we are nowhere near the ocean and there was life here at a casino that seems like it was falling apart. Plus, the coupon help pay for my Mom's Birthday...lol.

The chief factor recommending it was its location right by the elevator to my hotel room, and no line. I figured at least I could make myself a healthy salad.  Turns out everything in the buffet is so unappealing there is no temptation to overeat.  The quality is comparable to elementary school cafeterias, although the selection is much broader.

At most Vegas buffets, you get more or less what you pay for.  My main area of expertise is the Champagne Brunch, and Vegas has quite the variety.  I've seen everything from the $8.99 Sahara (RIP) that served their champagne in plastic cups from some bizarre powdery mixture, to the Bellagio, which for $25 will get you a good selection of high-quality food and the coldest milk money can buy, to the Wynn, where $45 will get you every bizarre food under the sun (yet somehow omit the one food you crave most at any brunch buffet.....bacon).

Anyways....The Flamingo buffet hits bottom rung in pretty much every category.  Poor selection, poor quality, high price, and to top it off you have to pay $10 extra for champagne (unless you happen to be a diamond Total Rewards member)!  At $25 plus $10 for champagne, you get basically the smallest buffet in Vegas.  They do throw a few crab legs and shrimp in to justify the price, but don't be fooled.  They were well-below-average quality, even for buffet standards.  And the rest of the buffet is no better....I've seen $10 Fremont-strip buffets with twice the selection and better quality!

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, so I have no qualms there.  However, they were balanced off by the surly crepe chef....  I get to the front of the line and ask for my crepe with ""everything"".  She says, ""Everything?""  I say ,""Yes, everything,"" and point to each of the toppings (apple, strawberry, chocolate, whipped cream, and nutella).  She gets angry, throws strawberries and chocolate on my crepe, and yells, ""Next!""  Who does that?  It doesn't cost you anything.  Even if you think the combination is disgusting, just throw the junk on the crepe and the drunk idiot will go away and be happy.  Now you made him sad.

So if you happen to be in the market for a champagne brunch, pass by this one and don't look back.  There are plenty more that are well worth your while....TI, Paris, Aria, Planet Hollywood...just to name a few.",XM7xls_DIocpWVtPg8DM6g,0,0,1,bldx4v_J0pu1vseOv-tb3w

They do have dessert crepes, but they are pre-made and are not fresh like the Paris buffet. The chocolate fountain is great for dipping your fresh fruit, brownie pieces and marshmallows.

On a busy Saturday night, no lines at 7pm might sound tempting, but after experiencing the quality of the food, it's probably in your best interest to search for food elsewhere.  Almost anything else would be a better option for your $30.  

The selection is very limited, and within your choices, even fewer were actually good.   The carving station provided a decent prime rib and my wife said the turkey was not bad.   A korean pork dish over white rice was the only item I considered getting a second serving of. 

The asparagus had no flavor.  I spit out the shrimp tacos.   A lot of the clam shells were missing its contents inside.   Salads looks inedible and probably left out all day since there's no one to eat and replace it from the salad station. 

The biggest draw for this buffet on the weekend is supposed to be its crab legs.   Sorry, but it's smaller and less flavorful than the Asian buffet down the road.  

Finally the dessert section is limited and nothing stood out  to save the meal.   It's a shame. 

Service itself was average at best.   Took a few moments to flag servers for refills.  Tables were dirty when we arrived.

2923995,2011-01-04,0,_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw,"Seriously, out of all the Buffet of Buffet's, only Flamingo & Rio get 5-stars.  Maybe PH (Planet Hollywood), but last time they didn't have a line for Platinum/Diamond members [which means waiting in that extravagant line], so that might keep them at a 4-star rating.

But let's focus on the task at hand.  And keep it simple.  You're probably reading this on your iPhone hoping to find a quick tip before you go out & get trashed & bet a black on zero's.

Location:  back of Flamingo.  Still trying to figure out the parking structure that's right outside the doors of it, but can't navigate it.  Either way, not too far into the casino (unlike Caesar's) that you and you drunk buddies can easily find your way to it.  Ambiance inside is still a little dated, but you can ask for a view next to the windows which circle around the flamingo gardens and koi ponds.  Once watched a turtle couple hook up while sun bathing.  Not too shabby.

Service:  Awesome.  Playing has it perks, and that includes getting upgrade to Platinum/Diamond level.  Those have its perks, like not waiting in line.  Plus the servers tend to treat you better hoping to squeeze out an extra few bucks hoping that you're really rolling like your card 'says' you are.  Luckily for me, ""na aawa ako sa mga kababayan"" so everytime I get a Filipino server, there's always a guaranteed extra few bucks.

Parking:  It's inside the hotel, so valet or self, your choice.  Walk to take the monorail as well.

Food:  Honestly, I love the breakfast here.  The BF loves the Chinese & he and my dad killed it during our most recent New Years trip here, so although I can't say personally, they clearly enjoyed.  They have some basic dimsum items, xio mai & sticky rice, chicken feet (and please, don't get grossed out, our at least not out loud.  To be more clear, don't be the girl this weekend that walked past it and yelled out as loud as she could, ""EWWW GROSSS CHIIIIIICKEN FEEET"" - seriously, have some respect).  Widest variety I've seen where ALL the food tastes good.  Plus, cotton candy!  You can get crepes made and there's a carving station.  Crabs & mussels always taste fresh.  No reason for you to not give this a shot!

Overall:  No complaints.  Members get treated well and at least it's not in a super-overpriced casino so I don't regret playing some money after I get out.  And this one is definitely more kid-friendly than some of the other buffets/hotels.  Also, located in the middle of the strip, so you're definitely not walking the Daytona 500 back to your hotel if you ran out of money for the taxi.

For the price that you are paying ($17.99-$18.99 with a Player's card) per person, you would expect a buffet to have everything? Judging what I saw and couldn't finish, I would say that it did. The standards of pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausage on one table, along with an omelette station that usually has long lines. A large salad bar is evident, as well as an additional station that serves crepes and a TON of dessert assortments such as muffins, mousses, doughnuts, cookies, and even ice cream. I even saw a table that had pizza slices on it, for breakfast! 

An additional station also served mimosas and Bloody Mary cocktails, which are always good in the morning. The waiting staff was pretty attentive on both of my visits, to include one time where an international couple was trying to scam a server into comping their meal by scraping toast crumbs into their milk.

We'd already gotten our money's worth out of the pass, so this buffet was ""free"".

We arrived at an ideal time...only one group in line ahead of us.  When we left the line was rather long.

The food was OK. Not great, but not bad.  Surprisingly they had a very limited selection.  Really just the one counter of items (maybe 10 or 15), and then the dessert counter nearby.  Literally only about 1/3rd the size of the Paris buffet, and not even 1/8 the size of the RIo.  No, I'm not exaggerating.  What they did have was pretty ordinary.  The sushi was cooked, not ""fresh"" (i.e. raw).  When compared to other buffets on ""the Strip"", this was pretty weak.  Were we not pressed for time because of the show I would have left and gone somewhere else.  

One positive thing was that they have Sierra Mist.  That's the only major soda that is made with real sugar only (i.e. they don't have a high fructose corn syrup version anymore).  I avoid HFCS due to the toxic nature of it, so it was really nice that they had Sierra Mist.   They also had cotton candy.  Cotton Candy??  What, is this the state fair??  That was an odd thing to see there.

Happy people taking pictures of food with their cell phones, and talking about how great their food is...  Other people clamoring around the various stations, excited to try something new or eat some of their old time favorites...  My experience at the this buffet however, was quite different.  I think everyone there was just looking around, wide eyed, and thinking to themselves ""that's it?""

This place can't even compete with the comfort foods of a place like Hometown Buffet - and Hometown would charge you $5-$10 less!  My reviews are always relative to the level of service one would expect from a certain level of restaurant, and those that are comparable in the area.  For one of the most famous Las Vegas hotels, in the middle of the strip, a place like this has the cash flow to impress.  But impress they didn't!  Even the service we received was not up-to-par with the other buffets we went to.

I thought their salad area was very fresh (though extremely small), and they also have crab legs, and fresh carved ham.  I went during the brunch, so they also had breakfast items - the waffles were very cute, made of the various suits of playing cards (diamonds, clubs, etc.).  

But other than that, I did not find anything really that appetizing.  Oh yeah and if you are dying from dehydration, make sure to try the scrambled eggs.  There was so much water in those things that I thought I was going to float away after eating them!  

Come on Flamingo - you can do so much better!

SUGGESTIONS:  According to the Flamingo Las Vegas' Website:  ""Watch the playful antics of some of the Flamingo's wildlife while enjoying a fresh feast at the Paradise Garden Buffet.""

What they fail to tell you on the website is that you are going to need binoculars to see those playful antics, as all the tables near the windows are reserved for the ""Platinum Club Members"", so if you are just here for the buffet, then you might as well forget about those playful antics.  Maybe you can make random bird calls in the restaurant, and start some playful antics of your own!",47xz0CWxtPfdbTWjfreyKA,2,0,2,IKJ5wbQBFeiu9zCf_qQ74Q

Just having arrived from our morning flight, we were practically starving when we got to the hotel.  After checking in, we immediately went downstairs to the buffet.  Luckily we used our resort credit of $30 that we got when we booked the room, because for free, the food was fine.  We went here around 11ish am, so they were transitioning between breakfast and lunch.  

PROS:  I have to disagree with the reviewers that said they had no fruit selection or a good dessert area - since they had both!  They had a nice selection of fresh fruit, and the dessert area was nice!  They had little slices of different cakes and tarts (my fav!) - and they even had a crepes station.  Their bread pudding was delicious, although I've had better elsewhere.  I ate two servings!  :)  They also had a nice selection of cheese, and BBQ ribs were good.  This was the prime location to watch the flamingos from inside, too.

CONS:  It was I think $16 per person, which for the quality of the food it should have been closer to $9.99.  I didn't touch anything on the salad bar, it all looked old and unappetizing.  Even the person sitting next to us we overheard saying the same thing.  I did manage to get some mixed corn from there but it had no flavor.  They also had ceviche, which was questionable since I wasn't sure how long it had been sitting out, but tasted ok and I didn't get sick from it!
   
In conclusion, this place was ok for free, and for starving people.  Otherwise, there are way better buffets in Vegas than this just a few minutes walk away!",CgbaeJ7aXSWWhuaJESevLw,1,0,2,iMSDOwZIZLl09Ku6Ff7-rg

This buffet is located inside the Flamingo hotel on the strip and you can park at their parking lot for a fee. 

The greatest thing about this place is definitely the view. You can sit right by the flamingos, ducks, etc... making your dining experience pretty unique on the strip. Also, this buffet comes with alcohol included which is pretty rare. That only makes it worth the price whether you plan on drinking champagne in the morning or wine at night.

The food is good for a buffet without being exceptional but you do have the option of ordering burritos, quesadillas and crepes which is a nice addition.

3293472,2012-12-08,5,_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw,"A buffet with a view, that's the extent of Paradise Garden. That view is strictly a daytime thing, so it seems a majority of the patrons are here for lunch/brunch. It's a run of the mill Vegas buffet, with some interesting items, but is an overall lackluster experience.

First timers here might find the space impressive because it is. There aren't many midstrip lower end properties that will offer a spread like this, let alone with views of a vibrant garden. That's essentially the bread and butter of the experience because the options and quality of the food are subpar enough to have folks second guessing their visit.

During the brunch hour, there is a bottomless mimosa option, which is an attractive option for the weekend warriors looking to continue their Saturday hangover. Another thing I didn't expect was the ""Asian noodle"" station, where one can customize their bowl of noodle soup. I made a killer wonton noodle soup - I'm still shocked. Their crepes station is also a semi-thumbs up, but it really depends on who's making them.

The rest of the buffet is a tough to swallow. Literally. Anything fried is instant fail. The pizza is almost always a sure bet for a no-thank-you, most of the seafood is bland city, and if you're shooting for any of the BBQ or Mexican fare, then bless your appetite.

Prices aren't backbreaking for a strip property at $24 for dinner and brunch. Other than that it's $15-20 for everything else. If you happen to be rockin the 24 hour pass, then consider passing on the Flamingo version of buffetland.",ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ,8,4,2,1vspXsHIerdCLr7GgNz5Fw

There were long line waiting to pay, and long lines waiting to get seated.  The cashier was really nice.  The hostess was less nice, seating my family next to a large table of loud ""frat boys"".  At least all they were was loud since I was expecting them to get rude and vulgar... but they appear to have been well-bred frat boys since that never happened.  They left eventually.

The selection is varied but considerably smaller than most other Vegas buffets.  What was notable, though, was the clear inferiority of the food.  Much of it just didn't look good.  Some didn't look like was being described.  For example, there was a sign for ""chicken and cheese pierogie"" but what I tasted was a previously frozen, breaded chicken stuffed with cheese.  Nothing at all like a pierogie!

Crab legs were not split, making eating them messy.  One interesting item not seen on some of the other budget buffets was crawfish. 

Even the salad bar offerings was sparse.  Oddly, only goopy salad dressings and not an oil/vinegar option.  Wierd.

Best items: the bread rolls (really), and the plain horseradish.

Worst item: the gelatinous brown gravy.

Recommended items: the slightly tough rib roast and baked potato (how can they screw that up... except to mark them as baked SWEET potato).  If you insist on sour cream for the baked potato... I couln't find any so substituted the creamed horseradish instead.  

Weirdest item:  an entire area full of Middle Eastern and Italian ""mezze"", but practically empty.

We didn't really eat much, and enjoyed even less.

Dessert selection didn't dissapoint in quantity.  As expected, some items looked better than others.  The kids just LOVED dipping marshmallows and fruit in the chocolate fountain.

I opted for a fresh-made crepe.  the guy making the crepe did a nice job making it.  then offered a choice of four or five fruit fillings (canned pie filling kids of stuff).  Then, in one amazing motion, folded the crepe into a apple-filled football-like configuration, and flopped it onto the plate.  Could have been more dainty, I suppose, but it never changed the taste... which was just OK.

The waiter, though, almost drove this review into the 1-star category.  He was an nice older man who was tired and seems to have had no aptitude or interest in being a waiter.  He was never there when we needed him, and when he did show up never looked at us and took off so fast we couldn't ask him for anything... like beverage refills.  Throughout our meal he took care of refills of my wife and kids, once, but seemed to avoid me like I had the mark of Satan on my forehead.

Of course, when we were leaving, he cuddled up and made nice-nice  to ""Satan""... presumably  in hopes of a tip.",r-BStHfrLUjGID8m1I2Zog,0,0,2,GzRQ5HeUXVC7xFYbalv1tQ

With the ambience I would actually give it a four but took away 1 star for the bad stuff. We asked for a table near the waterfalls so that the children could see outside. The maitre di did accommodate our request which we appreciated. Also what I did appreciate about our waitress was that when my three year old spilled an entire glass, yes an entire glass, of orange juice on my lap, she did everything in her power to try and help me by getting some warm towels for me to wipe off.

OK now for the bad stuff. Watery scrambled eggs. Slow. Slow. Slow. You get the point. Service. I think I had to ask for Diet Coke two times. I think I asked for coffee a few times.

3456981,2015-09-09,12,_kb6GT4qawjwq47OsQ52xw,"Well, this is a strange buffet located at the oldest casino and hotel in the Las Vegas strip. Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet delivers some nearly average foods at an affordable prices. As my parents and I were nearly concluded the Vegas trip today, we decided to redeemed the last free buffet for 2 coupon offer after we signed two rewards cards a day ago.

As we headed inside, the atmosphere is totally outdated and trippy. The decor, the concept are very 1970s to 1980s feel with the awkward design instead of being contemporary. It's like I'm dining inside Hometown Buffet mixed with Denny's touch.

The service is not that bad as I welcome there. Some good; some not so good which they sometimes can't smiled at all. Otherwise, I believe they done a fine job here for making the customers approachable.

Now onto the buffet entrees for me. My first plate is a simple lunch meal filled with smoked ham, jambalaya, green beans, baked tilapia, and Spanish rice. So far, it's a mediocre meal. The good ones that I enjoyed is the baked tilapia which it does taste ok to me. Also, the Spanish rice does tasted good too! The downside: the ham is nearly dried and bland after baking which it's left out the flavor. The jambalaya tasted too salty for me! I don't know why the jambalaya adds the ingredients too much! I wish it could reduce it and place natural flavors. The green beans is closely fair to me which I did feel eating it like coming from a frozen food which it did bought at the local supermarket.

The second plate, is the BYO omelette. So far, it tasted closely average to me comparing to Hometown Buffet's BYO omelette, yet in a fine way. The omelette toppings that I added are spinach, bacon, and cheese. I wish it needs to make the flavors of the omelette more better, and fresher in my opinion before the doors open.

My possible suggestions to improve Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is to redesign the concept to make it more contemporary feel instead of keeping the outdated old school formation. Secondary, this place needs to clean and sanitized! I've seen some of the dirty spots there near the dirty dishes collector side like wet towels placing down on the floor plus the seats too. Finally, make the foods fresh and new! I'm sure they need to make it something new instead of keeping the old ways like Hometown Buffet does. This is Vegas Strip Flamingo, and I'm sure they need to change their attitude to step it up.

In the end, Flamingo's Paradise Garden buffet is a fairly Vegas buffet that my parents and I were dining this place for the first time. If you're likely and dare to come and dine there, good luck.",3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A,19,11,2,YjbtGHi7a_iuQM-5ov3WFw

What I absolutely forgot about this place is, there is an actual Flamingo sanctuary in the hotel's atrium.  That is a sight to see on it's own.  Who wouldn't want to take pictures with a cute pink flamingo?

We arrive at the counter.  There is no wait at 330pm for our lunch buffet.  Friendly lady in a wheelchair helps check us in.  We ask to be seated next to the Flamingo windows.  And first the hostess said those seats are reserved for Diamond members... but because it's 330pm and it was so empty, she went ahead and seated us there.  That was very nice.  But what I noticed was, instead of cloth napkins, we got cheap paper napkins.  But that's fine, I was able to use my extra's to sneak off 5 cookies from the dessert bar - shhhhhhh...

I would have never made it into Flamingo if it wasn't for this Buffet of Buffets thing I bought.  Since we stayed at Ballys and had no car, our legs were our fastest transportation to the next buffet.  

I scanned the room for food.  I grabbed a foiled wrapped hamburger.  Fresh prime rib slice (the dude cutting the meat looked stoned out his mind and confirmed it when he dropped my slice off the side of my dish),  buttery mash potatoes, mac n cheese, and a bowl of clam chowder.  I ate everything.  It's okay, not bad at all.

I ended up at the dessert section for my 2nd round.  I grabbed 5 tasty cookies ;), a chocolate mousse cake and strawberries.  Then i went to the salad section and grabbed lettuce, black olives and dressing.  That was it.  I was done.

I was full but left room for my next buffet...

Tip: Always ask to be seated next to the Flamingo's.  It doesn't hurt to try to get the best seat in the house... you earned it after walking through Jean Nate's gambling section",bROr0S4_0i62dg4OIZ40TA,1,0,3,bZUbVWb1R-hLBlp0mkrkow

The Flamingo is one of the buffet of buffets (24 hour buffet pass at 7 of the 8 Caesar's buffets) options and I think a very smart choice on weekends because they include the champagne in the pass while others charge you an additional fee to add on the champagne.

The offerings on the weekend are vast and change slightly as the morning progresses with breakfast items being replace by lunchier items.  During the week, they close down the back half of the buffet and the selection pretty much sucks.

They've also really cut back on their staffing levels --- servers are acting as bussers in many cases and this has definitely decreased the total level of once very prompt table service.

Oh and the pizza was bad. I don't even know why I tried that. I had two desserts one was like a chocolate mousse thing with a metric ton of cinnamon on it. Weird. And I think it was a mango mousse thing. I have never actually wanted to spit a dessert out until this monstrosity hit my taste buds. 

One of my dining companions got an omelet it was raw. He took it to the manger and she did right by us she refunded his buffet.  I asked if they were understaffed and she said actually today we are overstaffed.  Well you could have fooled the flamingoes out of me because the amount of time I waited in line at the live cooking stations tells a very different story.

Let's revisit the organization of this buffet.  Salad bar in the center as all buffets do. But from when you walk in this is the way the stations are laid out: bagels, rolls, biscuits, butter, toppings-breakfast meats (bacon, sausage) mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese-made to order breakfast potatoes-made to order omelets-rice, gravy, pancakes, French toast, syrup, biscuits with hollandaise-sandwiches, bread, cold cuts, cheeses-pizza-desserts-cereal and muffins-made to order crepes-Danishes and croissants. There's no rhyme or reason or cohesive flow. 

This is the worst buffet ever. The food is mediocre at best.  The manager did do right by us though.  Oh and my booth seat needed to keep being readjusted. It wasn't in right. 

Just bad. Just don't.",ElUiVmEMoQgyWcnYeR560w,1,1,2,4b1HfC0QW-CmH_6IYGg8gA

We walked from Caesar's Palace to the Flamingo to make it to this stop on the BoB tour.  I was already beginning to feel stuffed from the Caesar's buffet, but charged ahead anyway.  The line here was a little longer than Caesar's, but we were seated promptly and had a nice view of the pool area where the Flamingos & Swans hung out.  I even saw a Black Swan....cool!

The 1st round we all went to the buffet near the entrance, which had standard breakfast offerings....we were a little disappointed that it was so small.  I grabbed a few Pastries, Eggs, Potatoes, and other stuff.  The food was so/so (2.5 Stars for this section)....then another Yelper Holly C said that there was a Crepe station in another room past the 1st buffet section....what?!  How did I miss that?!

I immediately went to investigate.....yes, there was another huge section of Desserts, a Crepe station, Chocolate Fountain, Donuts, and other goodies.  I ordered a Blueberry Crepe from the nice woman working the station.

She was very pleasant and curious about what we were doing with attempting to eat at all 7 Buffets in one day.  She did a good job on the Crepe, which tasted awesome.  The other Desserts in the area were very good (4 Stars for this section).....but it really started to fill me up.

Just when we thought we saw it all, we discovered that there was a 3rd section of the Buffet!!!  There's a Chinese food section that opens at 11 am....I was done, but a few of the Yelpers I was with went to check it out and said it was very very good.

Overall, this was a hidden gem surprise as we had low expectations for this buffet.  I wish I would have paced myself better so I could try the Chinese food....next time.  3 Stars weighted average for the Desserts and 1st section of the Buffet.  Incomplete on the Chinese food for me because I didn't have any.....other Yelpers loved it.

This buffet was GLORIOUS! Part of that is because Gloria is the best waitress ever. She filled my glass of Orange Juice, I chugged it (needing the fluids) and she turned right around and filled it up again! That's great customer service if I ever saw it. 

When we checked in to the Flamingo we got a coupon book that gave two people $5 off of the buffet. That was a sign from above because there were 2 of us! Normally I guess the breakfast buffet is $14.99 but we got it for $10. No champagne in this one, but it being our last day, I could live with that.

Bagels with smoked salmon lox and cream cheese, amazing french toast and waffles, a crepe station (ask for banana, they have it!), an omelet station (that will blow your mind! I'll get to that later) and bacon, sausage, an amazing amount of good fruit and everything else. 

It was all to die for. Literally, the best omelet I've ever had, the ingredient were fresh and perfect. The crepe was huge and with just bananas and sugar the perfect amount of sweet. The fruit was better then any we had had so far and even the toast was so good I was eating it dry while waiting for them to make my omelet. 

We were there during the lunch switch and I saw some people eating ribs, and I would have grabbed some if I thought I could get on a plane with that much food in my stomach.

Then to make matters worse, finally we did get a second round of drinks (about 30-40 minutes after we had been there), and our lovely server said that she was refilling our drinks ""as a courtesy to us"" and that she had other tables to take care of. Given the fact that 3 of my friends are in the service industry, we ensure that we aren't difficult, but I don't think it's too much to ask for a round of refills- in a buffet where that is the only thing that you are doing as a server. we asked for the manager, Linda, who we voiced our complaints to. Meanwhile, a few tables next to us was another group complaining about the terrible service. Linda said that she would ""look into the situation."" Did not say she was sorry, or try to do anything to rectify our terrible experience. All in all, do not go here unless you want to eat sub par food and have terrible service. Not even worth it with the groupon.",8hZgfs1msYCG9IRpq4DebQ,1,0,1,qjwCzrn-GUBzKJAX16lTsQ

There is nothing that truly stands out about the buffet itself outside of sheer volume of choices on the first go around.  Please note that I hate going to a buffet and not having access to filling up my drink myself because I do not like not leaving a tip for the waiter or waitress, but sometimes my cup sits empty for an extended period of time.  Tips should be earned, and not just expected...my personal issue though.

When you are first given the clearance to go inside this eatery, and are escorted to your seat by the hostess, you can't help but to notice the massive amount of food that you pass by on the way to your seat.  Once you are given clearance to eat, and given the information that a waiter will be over to take your drink order later, it is just a good idea to just go around and view everything that is offered.  Depending on the meal, you may have an omelet station or a pasta station or whatever!   Truly, there are a lot of options to choose from that ranges from sushi to sliders to carved this and curried that!  A massive salad bar with many options is located next to boiled shrimp and other seafood stuff.  Move over to the next island and you will see sliders, chicken sandwiches and subway sandwiches cut into palm size.  Move to another island and you have a choice of crepes.  Move to another island and you have a huge variety of sweets that includes cotton candy, fondue machines, many cakes and ice cream just to name some yums.  

Truly, there is not stand out taste when it comes to this buffet.  Don't look for anything that will knock your taste buds socks off because that is not what this establishment is about.  This food-ship is strictly about shoveling massive amounts of items that you care to indulge into your pie hole often!  Find something that is good for that moment, and just go with that.  Try a little of each variety and leave full.  Just give them a try.  Make sure to ask about any discounts that are available with the buffet as well, which includes them being part of the eat at 6 buffets as often as you would like for 24 hours.",5O0ejMUB7XHzyTf1rLu2zQ,12,7,3,pPEncSbSlJSeskKbSHNf5g

We marvel at the Great Pyramids, but they were built over decades; the midnight buffet is built daily. Crushed-ice castles and grottoes chill the shrimp and lobster. Sculptured aspic is scrolled with Paisley arabesques. They are, laid out with reverent artistry: hors d'oeuvres, relish, salads, and sauces; crab, herring oyster, sturgeon, octopus, and salmon; turkey, ham, roast beef, casseroles, fondues, and curries; cheeses, fruits and pastries. How many times you go through the line is a private matter between you and your capacity, and then between your capacity and the chef's evil eye.""
-- William Pearson (in his 1965 novel, The Muses of Ruin, describing a Las Vegas buffet)
 
Whilst discovering the above quotation in Wikipedia, I was surprised to learn that the ""all you can eat"" buffet is said to have been first introduced in 1946 by Herb MacDonald, a Las Vegas hotel manager. I did know that eating at a Vegas buffet is a quintessential experience one must sample if their visit to this town is to be truly memorable. My friends and I didn't want to leave deprived in this regard, so we pre-paid for Flamingo's version for a Sunday morning (our departure day). For days, when I walked by, I monitored the line in front of the buffet room which always seemed to be unappetizingly long. I was a bit worried we were in store for a long wait and a big disappointment.
 
However, when we arrived at 9:00 AM on Sunday, there was not another patron in sight! Over the course of our brunch, a few other folks wandered in, but the place remained essentially empty. Because of this, we were offered a prime table with a great view of the garden, waterfalls and flamingos. Our excellent waitress kept our champagne glasses brimming throughout.

My first foray to the buffet table landed me the ""heart healthy"" portion of my meal--salad and fruit. What I sampled was fresh, crisp and sweet. I particularly liked the prunes (go figure).

During my second, third and fourth forays, I abandoned all intentions of health consciousness and scarfed on a huge omelette, prime rib, more prime rib and just about every other fat-filled, cholesterol-laden, blood pressure-increasing concoction available in their impressive spread.

When it was time for dessert, I realized I was already completely stuffed and just sampled their cheese plate and some wonderfully tasty dried figs. They reminded me of my Grandmother's figs dipped in brown sugar that she dried under glass in the sun back in the 60's.

A dose of nostalgia on a full belly is always good. It was a great way to end our trip to Vegas and I definitely got my money's worth. I didn't even suffer the following day.",3q-JsCIOag6nlZaXRLNa4g,3,4,4,i3TOV3lP4k8-mgSdVcAPKg

My only complaint about this place is that sometimes, they are slow to get your drink orders.

I was also enjoyed by the fact that they have cotton candy as one of their desserts, haha. I didn't get it..but it was fun to see. It was a first for me. I also liked the chocolate fountain they had where you can dip strawberries, marshmallows, etc.

We only have previous visits to the buffets at Bally's and Paris as a comparison, but we were quite pleased.  We actually thought it was comparable to Paris, and a touch cheaper; and much better than Bally's.

The buffet itself was fairly standard I guess, but I did note an omelette chef that was still on duty when we were there in the early afternoon.  Apparently, there was also a made to order burger bar station that we didn't discover until we had started dessert (which was a great disappointment when I saw the results some of the other patrons got).  The dessert selection was better than both Paris and Bally's, including a crepe chef (which I acknowledge Paris has too).

Flamingo's--besides the fact that there are actual flamingos, beautifully pink and spindly-legged, roaming the campus (you can even see them from the Buffet)--isn't my favorite hotel along the Strip.  It's no surprise, then, that their Buffet isn't my favorite either.  I mean, there's nothing really wrong with it, but in comparison to the others with the Buffet of Buffets, Paradise Garden is much smaller, and, in being so, has a smaller selection.

Uhhh you would think that was confirmed once you payed. The waitress proceeded to the other part of our party asking for there receipt and they didn't have there receipt either she started to freak out. It was very confusing due to the fact we were in the restaurant eating for 15 to 20 minutes already. Waitress continue to state that her manager was very strict and needed to find theses receipts. Waitress continue to ask me to check my purse once again for the receipt. So we continued to eat with no problems. However I could tell waitress was stressing over receipt. I offered to talk to manager if there was a problem but she refused.
Shame on management if they stress out the staff to the point that they cannot perform a good job!!!

At $15 per person, the cost seemed reasonable. However, in a city known for buffets, this one falls far short of average in quality and selection of food. 

Nearly everything was cold! Some of the meat at the carving station was weird (kielbasa?) and the sliced ham was cold. The omelet station was decent. Bacon was cold and the waffles were cold and hard as a rock.

There were far more lunch and dinner food items given the morning hours. Some of the food looked like it had been sitting out for days.

This magical pass allows you to enjoy all day access to the buffets at 7 different Harrah's properties. The price is $39.99 for Rewards Club members and $45.99 for non-members. It is seriously easy to sign up for the pass and worth the $5 savings. The best day to buy the pass is Sunday because the brunch buffets include the booze free of charge. Also, remember to check the operating hours at each buffet because they do vary.

Note: We did all seven locations (actually 8 buffets because we hit one twice) back to back in 11 hours.

The buffets included in the deal are: Le Village Buffet inside Paris, Planet Hollywood's Spice Market Buffet, Flamingo's Paradise Garden Buffet, Flavors at Harrah's, Lago Buffet at Caesars, the Emperor's Buffet at Imperial Palace and Rio's Carnival World Buffet!

We started our 24 hour eating adventure at 7:52 Sunday morning at the Flamingo.

Paradise Garden Buffett- Decent breakfast selection including a carving station with prime rib and ham. Warning, don't piss off the man carving the prime rib because he has sharp knives and a short temper...just sayin'. They also have cotton candy and a chocolate fountain in the dessert section which is fun, even at 8 o'clock in the morning. 

We made a second stop here at noon, which is when the Sunday brunch starts and your first bloody mary is free. They give you an airplane bottle of vodka at the cashier and you are able to visit the nicely appointed ""make your own bloody mary bar."" Note, each additional airplane bottle of vodka will cost you $3. My suggestion is to bring a flask. Also, champagne is included with brunch.

Overall, the food is pretty average here. Breakfast service was robotic, and the psychotic man at the carving station has a short temper and sharp knives so beware. Just don't ask for a more rare piece of prime rib and you should be fine. The service at brunch was awesome!",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,2,1,3,iQYLk1W6QzyEV3H--v0dbw

The desserts were actually pretty good. Red velvet cupcakes moist with creamy frosting, and very tasty cream cheese danishes. The whole place had a very open feeling with extra high ceilings, large windows and bright sunlight. The windows offer a good view of the Flamingo wild life including, different types of ducks, coy fish, cat fish, flamingos, and some other birds. They do have a large amount of seats which I can not ever imagine them filling. The food was decent, about a 3 stars. Desserts and pizza were my favorite. Now on to the disappointing part.

We came for breakfast at about 10:30 so there was a good amount of people in line just to get in. The way they have set up the buffet makes it inconvenient to get to the food. They have the carving and omelet stations right in the middle so the lines that form for those block all the other food. Some things I could only get one of because people in line for an omelet were blocking the way. Selection was not that good either, they claimed to have a Mexican food section, but that was simply a joke. A bucket of jalapenos, peppers, sour cream, and onions is not a Mexican station.

The service here was hit and miss at best. Our first server spoke almost no English and gave us half of the drinks we ordered two coffees, two orange juices, and a tomato juice. We asked for some hot sauce and he never came back. He just seamed a little disoriented and not very alert, a complete disconnect from the customers. A lady came up to us and asked us how we were doing and we let her know that we needed some hot sauce and shortly after she came back with some hot sauce. So one did almost nothing for us and the other one was nice and accommodating. The other servers were a bit rude and seamed to expect us to move out of their way when we went to the buffet.

We tested out three buffets during this trip, all associated with Caesar's entertainment group and this one was by far the worst. They seam to not pay attention to the details and tried to cut some corners. With just a few tweaks they could be so much better, but for now if you are in the area seek a cure for your hunger elsewhere.",yzwM0CciecSwsLqWGITXyw,1,0,2,WBZqkx6fIYpw5H1QQF2xrw

Deciding that at least if a buffet isn't that great, you can still really fill up, we found ourselves on line for a couple minutes before entering this buffet at the Flamingo.  Selection was decent, but hardly huge, and even the dessert area, while taking up a lot of space, didn't really have that much variety to offer.  Do we really need 25 feet of ""sugar-free desserts""?

The drink service was annoying to say the least, as the soda hardly tasted right, and the servers rarely paid you any attention.  Why no open area to get your own drinks?

The food itself ranged from marginal at best (lobster bisque, pasta) to forgettable but decent (poultry dishes, other seafood) to fairly good (green beans, fried rice, beef dishes).  The desserts were hit and miss as well.

In the end, for $25 a person, this was right on the edge of tolerable.  One could fill up on pretty decent food, and that was the saving grace.

We switched seats and the table was uncomfortably high for me and I'm 6'3"". The table service was slow to clear plates and they never brought the ordered mimosa. The food was decent enough, but nothing to rave about. The eggs Benedict was dry. The country grave had the consistency of soup. The orange juice was a a disappointing concentrate.

4 Adults

Atmosphere - 2 stars
Food - 2 stars
Service - 2 stars

Background - Visiting family that is staying at the Flamingo and this was the place they picked for breakfast.  Amazing how few places were actually open at this time.

Atmosphere - Outdated.  Plain and simple this place needs an overhaul.  The food was easy to get to, so that was a good thing.
 
Food
  Drinks - The weekend ""brunch"" comes with bottomless mimosas or Bloody Mary's.  I had the Bloody Mary's.  Served in a small cheap plastic cup filled to the top with ice, maybe an 8 ounce cup.  No garnishes.  I could not feel the alcohol in my drink.  My wife did say her mimosas was heavy on the booze.  I also had black coffee.  Both were left empty during most of the meal.

  ""Brunch"" - This was my breakfast for the day, well it later turned into lunch too.  So it was really brunch.  That was not my plan.  Not a single item stood out for me.  As my father in law said the pastries are cold like they just took them out of the freezer, which I agree with.  I was really wanted the pastries to be good.  The French toast was soggy and bland.  The gravy for the biscuits was bland with no sausage in it.  I was able to pull a couple of slices of bacon from the heap of molded bacon slab.  I wish I would have gotten a picture of that heap of a mess.  The sausage links they had were large and in a casings, again bland.  They did have a carving station but nothing caught my eye.  They do a have a cereal station, perhaps that is for the little kids that a picky eaters.  

Service - Slow.  Thanks for the free meal for my father in law on veteran's day.  He served in the US Air Force proudly! 

Future - I hope not.",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,21,12,2,NBHU5nIJ8w2IeMjRBSo2GQ
