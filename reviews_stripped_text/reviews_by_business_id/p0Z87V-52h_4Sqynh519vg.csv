The tamales and nachos were decent, nothing special but I wouldn't mind having again. I wish they gave us some salsa or sauce with the tamale though. The food it self does not look appetizing, I didn't expect much because this place seems like a fast food place but a little more attention to the presentation would make the food more appealing. 

The Guac was terrible... not sure if it is a mistake or what but it was runny and very bland. Maybe they gave us green salsa or whatever else by mistake but it literally tasted like water that is green! Never ordering that again!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,2,0,1,RJd9LtaxXAp64Thldr3v6w

I am not remotely close to being a connesseur of Mexican food, but I can say that the food was tasty and came out to me hot.",xeiZt5iPBzbs_TQ_aKZOXw,0,0,5,Srzcug7kQsKrP5UI1Zi8VQ

 I did a u-turn and thought I would give them a try. I quit Dimas around 3 or 4 years ago after a new owner change a year or two before that. When I started going there 8 yrs ago the food was consistently good. They were the California style Mexican food like Robertos that I enjoy. After new owners came in I would eat there every now and again because it was closer than Robertos, (before the new one) but it wasn't always good. Hit and miss. 
  When I saw the new sign I hoped to find a new good Mexican food place. I looked at the menu a good long time and noticed it looked like the same menu but with higher price changes taped over the old. Probably because Robertos prices went up so they thought they could raise their prices also.  I ordered the plate with hard shell beef taco and enchilada with rice and beans.  When ordering I told the woman I'll take a number 10(?) (or whatever the number was) with a cheese enchilada. She was looking at her handwritten cheat sheet to see what a number 10 plate was and I helped her by saying beef taco and cheese enchilada. She then asked hard shell? and I answered yes.  I used my card to pay and wrote $1 on the tip line. She was ringing it into the card machine as I was writing and she literally asked me ""Did you want to put a tip on it?"" I hadn't handed her the reciept yet but I had written the small tip on there, but I couldn't believe she asked. She was an owner. In my day owners never expect tips in business, let alone ask if you want to leave a tip. I normally tip 20% or more in restaurants with food servers, but this is a order at the counter and go get it when it's ready type of place.
 I got the food and first thing I noticed is the taco shell was not like most places. It didnt look to be a corn tortilla fried hard. It looked like a premade shell put into the deep fryer to make it appear to be a fresh fried hard shell. It was smaller. The 'beef' was seasoned ground beef and too greasy and salty. Meat is always shredded beef when menu says beef hard shell taco, so I didnt know it wouldn't be. I've never even seen ground beef on the menu of these types of Mexican restaurants. It was like a taco bell small taco. Then I cut into my cheese enchilada to find it was also the greasy ground beef!  Who makes ground beef enchiladas besides at home American style? Even I don't.  Every place I have ever ordered enchiladas, the choices is always cheese, chicken or beef, which is shredded chicken or beef. Beans were good, rice was ok but I'm used to Mexican rice with tomatoes blended in the sauce which give it the orange color. This was white (kind of grey)and mushy. It did have a decent seasoning flavor but not what I like. My rice is better. I only ate two bites of each the taco and the enchilada, most of the beans, and some of the rice, all the while comtemplating whether or not to tell her this was not what I asked for or expected. I decided to tell her and brought my food up to the counter. Waited for them to notice me for about 10 seconds then just said forget it, and left my food right there and left. 
 
 If their prices were lower than Robertos or Gerardos, which are closer to me, I would try them again. Especially since they have a sign saying fish tacos .99 on Wednesdays. But I don't want to gamble when I know I can get good food somewhere else for the same price.",0ZSSxlUujHpr76ZrcDKE4g,0,0,2,TkYWjqrViibSaFmKYPhfzw
