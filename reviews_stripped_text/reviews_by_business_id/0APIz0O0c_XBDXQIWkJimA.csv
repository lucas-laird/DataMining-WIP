1940888,2017-12-11,0,0APIz0O0c_XBDXQIWkJimA,"its an okay mediterranean place. couldnt really agree on the (2) dollar sign as a price range since its more expensive than the usual mediterranean restaurants. when i say more, we are not talking about $14-17 plates. haha. the food is pretty good tho. the meats atleast. full of spices and very flavorful. fries were kind of overcooked, but not a big deal. rice was alright. its not the same as the other places where it sort of has a unique flavor. staff are friendly, but the only downfall is that one of them blew their nose while people were dining. some wouldnt mind, but for me, thats just plain disrespectful and disgusting. overall it was an ""alright"" experience.",jBU5xlyWr-yoSAm-b66ZYA,0,0,3,cmCJfOvgEHxMMQ-Ty-s0Lg

Food wasn't bad, We didn't wait long for our food to arrive and the staff was nice and friendly. Place was clean and looked like it was freshly remodeled. They can accommodate large groups.

It took them more than 15 min to get our order ! The menu had not enough details ! Our main dish was supper spicy ! Not the menu nor the waitress mention it !!! 
They didn't even check on us see if we need anything! Very nice people but as they are new in this business the customer service  is not as good yet !",Zz7UmEHXrCvQuvCEori9IQ,0,0,5,vQUr4-F9r3G14W2cUA2NTQ

A little too bright in the dining room, but the bar was perfect for a late dinner. Solomon and Andras the owners were very attentive. We ordered kosher and chinese food, which were fantastic. We sampled many appetizers, loving them all! Close to the strip. I'd go back to try new dishes.",9kMpcwQMxq3CJCJy-1ULiw,1,0,5,ONo_vHRG0voznqFfsHSPxw

We felt really special there and staff were really welcoming. Food was really fresh and well cooked. Everything was really fast and we didn't waited for long. 
I just felt awkward to talk to my husband after they stopped the music and place become so quiet. 
Prices are bit high for Mediterranean food but this place has a concept of traditional kosher food.",WP9NaEgjvpsjTtZESisRLA,0,0,4,PXIL7ehs2DUv_ldMbH1Plg

Food perfectly cooked, tasty, and on time.
Server was very professional, polite and constantly checking to make sure we are OK with the food.
Food came in right timing
Great atmosphere with live jazz piano.  
Thanks to all people in this place we had a wonderful time and enjoyed our food.
I made a short video of the piano playinh",2Q5hN-1CWodR8J50fWdKpQ,1,0,5,5EM82sFFUgWFZ8lm4zFG0Q
