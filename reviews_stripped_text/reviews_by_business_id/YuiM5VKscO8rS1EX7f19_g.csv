This is the second time I have eaten at Fleur de Lys, and it only gets better. (Of course I haven't had to pay the bill which was close to $400 plus tip)

The atmosphere is wonderful and is the perfect escape from the neon lights of Vegas.  Dining at Fleur de Lys makes me feel like a queen.  I love the outstanding service and the surroundings are elegant and relaxing.

During our most recent experience the sommelier offered several suggestions to accompany our tasting menu and each was perfectly paired with the entrees.  I enjoyed a fruity Pinot Noir and had a few sips of a red, but stopped there since I'm not much of a drinker.

The food seemed to just keep coming and the only entree I passed on was the foie gras since I will not touch it for ethical reasons, but my dining companion said it was the best ever.
  
We started with a mixed green salad with polenta and the Truffle Onion Soup, both excellent.  I was almost full by the time I sampled the bread basket which was amazing in itself.  I could have eaten the pretzel bread and focaccia along with the salad and soup and been very satisfied.

The other courses included a sampling of lobster and scallops, braised beef short ribs and pan seared duck breast.  My companion also ordered a sampling of Ahi Tuna Tartare.  Every course had unique flavors that worked together like an orchestra performing in my mouth.  Side dishes included white asparagus and fingerling fries.  Although I was full I couldn't pass up tasting each dish, and my companion lucked out since they scored half my dinner.  Ah, but there was a method to my madness since I was saving room for dessert.

We enjoyed a cheese sampling and fruit along with the chocolate soufflé and some brittle.  

I can't wait to go back this spring, hopefully with my 21 year old in tow. 
Fleur de Lys is definitely on my short list of favorite restaurants.",Kvfqs8KpfVaOCNRiB_hXqQ,2,1,5,wI8_19IKln-HWlgl62XzBA

The atmosphere was upscale without the stuffiness. We all loved the decor.They had a very interesting cocktail list. My friend got an Absinthe Apple Martini and they made me a special drink that wasn't listed (St. Germain, Pear Vodka, sparkling wine). Both drinks were out of this world. Our waitress was super nice and even brought me a special desert that said congratulations for the engagement! The dinners we got and deserts were great. My only complaint is that the menu was kind of small and there wasn't any listed option to add any meat to out salads.

The Ahi Tuna tartare was really good and went surprisingly well with fennel. The beef was delicious too. I wasn't thrilled by the selection of cheeses and would have loved to find a good Munster on the plate. The dessert was unfortunately disappointing and very plain.

All in all, there is room for improvement. Hubert Keller is very nice and certainly talented. I just wished he would be more influenced by his origins: his region and his parents' pastries.",OEb_kGar-vTTlP9_YY_P7g,0,0,3,Gk1cYkfOKa72hX56XRp2eg

We were seated at a round table, which was nice so we could all talk to each other. The restaurant was not very crowded, but possibly only because it was early (730... early for Vegas). All of the food that came out was delicious and not a single plate went uneaten. The plates were also fairly large in size so no one had room for dessert at the end of the meal. The service was also great, and when I walked up (late... after the rest of my group) Hubert Keller was standing at the front podium right next to the sign with his picture.

I was so sick of eating that disgusting cafeteria food and I figured since my company's per diem was $80 a day, I might as well go to Fleur by Hubert Keller. I mean, why the hell not? 

I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended that I ordered 2-3 plates, since they are small European portions or tapas style. I settled for the beef sliders, hummus with pita bread, and the macaroni and cheese.

1. Beef Sliders-bacon and bleu cheese. The presentation was well done. Juicy and had good flavor. 

2. Hummus--The pita bread was seasoned well and baked perfectly. Hummus was better than the grocery store (but I would expect that from Hubert) but in the end, it was still hummus. Nothing out of this world

3. Macaroni and Cheese--I'm a mac and cheese girl, so this was so freaking delicious I wish I ordered 2 of these plates! Cheesy goodness with the right amount of crunch on top. Not too creamy/cheesy which was a huge plus. My favorite dish of the 3.

Total with tip: $44

Staff was nice, service was quick. Good experience, except for the anorexic chick who decided to point out that I was eating a lot for one person. She didn't say it directly to me, but to point to your much older boyfriend and say the word ""a lot"" right when you're sitting next to me--not cool.

75962,2009-12-15,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I had extremely high hopes for Fleur de Lys. I was in Vegas with my BF, surrounded by awesome restaurants, and Fleur de Lys came out as a disappointment.

We did the $140 tasting menu and it was way, way overpriced for rather unexceptional food compared to other outstanding vegas restaurants (le atelier de joel robuchon, picasso, restaurant charlie), which are all at the same price point. 

The decor was very nice, btw. Love the high ceilings. Very modern.

We did the 6 course tasting menus (on a separate note, the wines were great).

high points: the duck and truffled onion soup. Veal ravioli. the sorbet with tapioca.

low points: everything else -- ahi tuna tartare (seriously? i mean come on give me something a little more creative!), a strange ""gently heated"" alaskan king salmon that tasted like it came from a can...

I also took issue with the service. Basically, they made me feel like I was at a P.F. Chang's or some chain restaurant. Normally, I would not be this picky at all but for this kind of pricepoint and competition I can afford to be. We had an issue with our table -- we arrived 15 minutes early for a reservation that was booked a month in advance and the maitre'd was pissy and demanding. She didn't offer coat check until my bf requested it. 

The wine was poured AFTER the course was delivered. The servers weren't great at explaining things/wines. Every thing just seemed unrehearsed. 

Then, the advertised signed cookbook that comes with the tasting menu did not arrive, forcing us to awkwardly ask for it at the door. So uncomfortable. So disappointing. 

I now see why they no longer have that Michelin star. Should have gone to le atelier de joel robuchon",e6jpCUS2234aXtyUr0ASLg,0,0,2,NxLLh3kKYAtUDqe1YL0mVg
77265,2009-10-26,1,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Deliciously good value! I honestly didn't find this restaurant that expensive given the quality of food. This could be that my standards of what counts for expensive are all out of whack after a string of triple digit restaurant bills--but I thought the prices here were spot on for a nice dinner out. Not cheap, but definitely not as expensive as they could be elsewhere!

Onion soup = fantastic. I stole half of my boyfriend's soup as I was jealous that I didn't order it for myself. Not that my ahi tuna tartar was not delicious...but oooh the soup, it causes me to make primordial sounds.

Braised veal ravioli = YUM

Short ribs = excellent! Fall off the bone! Very pretty presentation.

Chocolate souffle = large and chocolatey delicious! I'm convinced they put something in this souffle though that causes intense food coma. Immediately after eating it, I had to lean on my boyfriend to get out of the restaurant and passed out in bed with my shoes on.

The atmosphere of this restaurant is really comfortable--it's not so fancy that it becomes intimidating (see Joel Robuchon, although I would kill to eat there again). Also, I'm in love with all the china at this restaurant. Every piece. Every dish that came resulted in me fawning over the new piece of china. I am crushed to discover that it was designed especially for this Vegas restaurant (it says so on the bottom of the butter plate. If you're going to check, I suggest you remove the butter from the plate before doing so....so that your butter does not roll off your plate and onto the ground--oops).

The ahi tacos were super tasty.  $13 for three itsy bitsy teeny weeny one bite tacos, are you kidding me?  I almost laughed when they came out.

Fries were excellent though. It's a toss up about whether it was worth the price. But here's the thing that makes it a 3 star rather than higher: Soft drink refills are not free. If Fleur is going to charge me 4.50 for a coke without free refills, then it had better be in a gigantic glass. Instead, it's a small tumbler mostly of ice. It is one of my biggest pet peeves that someone charges me a lot of money for a soft drink and doesn't offer free refills. It's irritatingly cheap. I will not be back.

There was a longer gap before the entrees came out, but it didn't stop me from really enjoying the wagyu burger.  The patty itself was delicious and cooked to a perfect medium.

We originally were going to go with the 3 course prix fixed dinner but we each decided on the 4 course elegance menu which gave you more options and was $89 compared to $55 for the 3 course menu.

The bread girl offered us a choice of 4 different breads.  I went with the Focaccia and the Pretzel bread and they were both great.

We also got an amuse bouche of tempura cod over mashed potatoes which really hit the spot.

Here is what I ordered:

Ahi Tuna Tartare - This was a much larger serving that I expected.  The tuna had the right amount of ginger sauce mixed with it and the fennel gave it great texture.  This was the best tuna tartare I've had and was even better than the one I had at Michael Mina.  Everyone else got the Truffled Onion Soup which they loved but I was very happy with my Tuna.

Halibut and ?? - The halibut was cooked nicely and was served over a mixture of clams, mussels and other seafood.  The dish tasted good but it was nothing special.  If I had a do over, I think I would try the veal and potato ravioli.  I also tried a bite of the gently heated salmon.  It had an Asian flavor and was good but wasn't anything special.

Prime Filet Mignon - The piece of meat was on the small side.  Not sure if you get a larger piece if you order the Entrée.  However the meat was so tender and combined with the red wine sauce, it was absolutely divine.  My friend paid extra for the foie gras and truffles on top of his filet and said it was the best steak he's ever had.  

Mixed dessert of peanut butter shake, chocolate banana cake and Bailey's ice cream.  The peanut butter shake was warm and reminded me a little of the peanut butter sauce you get on ice cream sundaes.  The chocolate banana cake was solid and the Bailey's ice cream packed a wallop and was yummy.  I have a sweet tooth and liked all 3 desserts.  The rest of my party paid $6 extra for the souffle.  I had a taste and I'm glad I didn't get it because it wasn't sweet enough for me but they all loved their souffles.",ShC0d1mzKySVp228dF4ClQ,2,1,5,DY25wTpIW9-Cvi1lPuwpxg

I checked in at 7:04pm to let them know we were here and I'm asked to wait ten additional minutes, which was not a problem but it was odd since the place was half empty.  Then we are sat and after explaining that my wife recently had surgery and cannot sit on the high bar tables we were given the least desirable and least intimate table in the entire restaurant. We were on the most outside part of the restaurant where everyone visiting the hotel is walking: they could have flicked ash or sneezed on my food. There were that close.  We were sat and remained neglected without a word from our server for 12 minutes, yes we timed it.  We actually thought about leaving but I thought maybe it's a more laid back and relaxed style of service... But we should've been given water and been said hello to.  It's small plates so I was nervous because I'm a big eater but I had no problem with the portions.  Each app is about $20, we started with 3. A heirloom tomato n duck breast salad.  It was great, the best of the 3 by far.  We also had Peruvian potatoes which were very good but not amazing... Think of Rosemary potatoes with a hint of spice and a unique, thin chipotle nacho cheese sauce. The third app was disappointing, the beef carpaccio.  It had spot on texture but no real flavor.  It needed a soy sauce vinaigrette or something.  My wife barely touched it so I ate it.  There is no complimentary bread but u get 2 pieces for a $1.25 and it was great.  Drinks are pricey at $16 each.  The main courses shined.  We had the skirt steak and the scallops.  The skirt steak was a fancy carne asada with a special red wine sauce.  It was very good.  My scallops were amazing.  I was nervous seeing 3 scallops for $41, but there were surprisingly filling. The had a glob of compound butter on top and a piece of pork belly on the bottom.  Rich, smokey, and incredibly delicious.  We shared a dessert because we were pretty stuffed. We got the chocolate soufflé because it's usually one of my favorites. This one was very good but not the best I have had. It was not super intense and chocolately. They pour a syrup in the middle, you need a double shot of that sauce.  The texture and presentation were spot on. The addition of a tiny scoop of cookies n cream ice cream was a nice touch and offset the heat of the soufflé.  Overall it was a nice experience but not amazing like I would have expected anytime I pay $200 or more.  I liked it, it was a different experience, I felt like a judge on Chopped.  Most of the food was great but the service was lacking. Not being greeted by our server and not being sat when the place is empty and getting the worst table and the whole setup was unorganized from expo's bringing food to the wrong tables and there seemed to be a disconnect from the hosts to the servers.

My boyfriend and I live in Chicago - so when he called ahead, he made sure to tell them how much we miss foie gras - and we really appreciated all of the personalized touches the staff went out of their way to provide - my birthday dessert was divine.

The sommelier was fantastic, our server was so friendly and definitely knew her cuisine.  The food was absolutely phenomenal.  I really appreciate places where the staff is friendly and personable and not too formal, but still very attentive to detail.  Perfect balance of great service without stiffness.

After all day of walking around on the Strip, I was starved. We found Fleur by chance as we explored Mandalay Bay. My BF wasn't very hungry, so he chose something from the ""small plate"" section of the menu, which, as it was explained to us, was similar to Tapas style. Since I was very hungry, I ordered ""slow cooked salmon"" from the ""large plate"" section of the menu. When the orders arrived, I was shocked to see that my ""large"" plate was no more than the ""small"" plate my BF ordered. It turned out to be a thin section of salmon, laid out on top of  6 slices of cucumbers, with sauce. After I devoured the salmon, I was still hungry. So I thought, ""ok, then I will order dessert.  That should fill me up."" So I ordered ""Brownie Lollipop."" When that arrived I couldn't believe it either. Four little lollipops... and nothing to do with Brownie really, mostly mousse. You have to understand, that after all day walking around, I NEEDED CARBS! I looked at the menu again, and saw in SMALL PRINT, that bread is available upon request, but with a charge of $1.25. At this point I didn't care, so I called the waiter over, kind of voiced my complaint that the ""large"" plate was no larger in portion size than the ""small"" plate, and asked him to bring me some bread. He said, the bread is dinner roll with olive oil on the side. When he brought it, he was not kidding, when he said ""dinner ROLL,"" because it was ONE dinner roll, with olive oil on the side. I had to laugh out loud, because it was SO stingy and miserable. The night before we went to another restaurant at another casino resort, and they brought lots of bread, free, and their price was no more expensive. 

So no, I don't recommend this place at all. Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else for better food and treatment. Plenty in Las Vegas!",aZm0p3DgGaxoTXgzpRrtnQ,2,1,1,aiftWDintrCM8syiIZqrAw

When you walk in you'll notice the high rock covered walls and oversized art work of a rose filled petal. The second floor has a glass wall to show the massive wine cellar full of wines from all over the world from different years. For more privacy the restaurant also has rooms draped with curtains. I believe you have to make reservations to dine in these.

The entire staff is pleasant, friendly, and well educated with their restaurant. They answer every question regarding their menu and wine. One of our waiters, whose name I believe was Seth, took good care of our party with his detailed description of the dishes, good humor and dessert recommendations. 

Our party of 4 ordered the 4-course meal paired with red wine. All the dishes were outstanding in taste, flavor, texture, and presentation. But the ones I would order again would be the ahi tuna tartare, escargots with gnocchi and oyster mushrooms, and halibut tempura with potato salad amuse bouche (compliments of the chef  ).

Dropped in after visiting the Sharks at Mandalay.
Should have red flagged the restaurant when only 2 of the dozens of tables were filled.
Arrived with hubby and our two little ones.
Very friendly staff.
Wanted to order a quick bite for my three year old, asked for Mac n cheese, with no lobster. They wanted $10 so I passed.
I ordered the onion soup $7 and the manchego salad $10.
Hubby ordered burger w horseradish mayo. $18
Salad was tiny, overdressed. After a bite, I realized they forgot the manchego! Asked the waiter, he took it away and said he'd return w it. He came back and said manchego was micro shavings in salad dressing. What??!! Ridiculous. 
Soup was nicely served in a tiny silver pot with a shot glasses. It was inedibly rich and bla. My tummy still hurts. And the taste of truffle oil won't escape me. On the check it said ""shooter"" which I think had that been written on the menu itself under description, I wouldn't have ordered it. All cream n butter.
Hubby's burger was under seasoned, boring, near tasteless. The kids loved it, need I say more? I prefer a Fatburger for $4.

The marinated olives for $3 were the equivalent of what I can pick up at Safeway for a buck; nothing special at all, and I'm not sure sitting in a pool of plain olive oil really qualifies as ""marinated"".  For kicks, we also ordered the Parmesan Paprika Popcorn (also $3).  It was a tiny (yes, tiny) bowl of stale popcorn with powdered parm and paprika sprinkled on it. I'm not sure what why we expected anything else, but it was pretty much like low-quality AMC theater popcorn with Harkin's flavored sprinkles on top....at 10 times the price of movie theater popcorn.  The high point of the appetizers was the ceviche, but again....nothing better than you'd expect at any nice restaurant, and again very overpriced for the size of the portion.

For dinner, I had the Manchego Salad. Seriously, I make a better Manchego Salad at home...this was like spring greens mix from a bag with some grated Manchego on top; even the dressing was unexceptional.  My last plate was the meatballs, which were served in a hot pot with some broccoli rabe.  The flavor was nice, and the broccoli rabe steamed nicely...but 5 meatballs the size of ping-pong balls with 3oz. of broccoli rabe and a smattering of sauce that barely covered the bottom of the hot pot was not at all worth $14.   It should have been a $5 small plate.  

Others at the table had the Fleur Burger...again tiny and ordinary, at $35.  Seriously, a $35 burger should be a knock your socks off burger.  Not at all. Slow roasted Alaskan Halibut was the quality of the buffet food we had in our conference earlier in the day.  And two of us had the risotto, which was probably a 2oz. portion.  I mean, teeny-tiny.

If any of this food had been presented on Top Chef, the cook would have been eliminated.  What a huge bummer for us all.  And a final check in the hundreds of dollars was such a waste of hard-earned cash.

Dining room is open to the Mandalay Bay mall and, at dinner, you are overpowered by the Bays ""entertainment."" 

As far as food, some excellent sounding dishes but all seemingly fell flat except for the watermelon gazpacho. We didn't even make it to the large plates after the poor performance on the small plates. Had to send back the most basic dish - Paprika Popcorn - after almost cracking a tooth and realizing at least half the kernels hasn't popped. Tasted pretty stale too ...

468665,2009-04-01,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"This being my third meal at the Hubert Keller franchise, I harbored a slight concern that the food might lose some of its allure. Not only did we enjoy superb food, but the service also exceeded all ex ante expectations. 

The beet and goat cheese amuse was a friendly hello from the kitchen. Concentrated droplets of grapefruit and cranberry woke up the palate, and the sweet beet tamed the tartness.

First course: Ahi tuna tartare, fennel salad, ginger ponzu, sesame seed tuile. Starting with the tuna and continuing through the remaining savory courses, Fleur de Lys' breads became sine qua nons, specifically the rosemary-caramelized onion foccacia and the pretzel roll. The lime and vinegar sauce threatened to overpower the dish, but anise and sesame evened out the flavors, ensuring that the tuna's freshness remained the focal interest.

Second course: Veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli, braised carrots, pea foam. It is a given that veal ravioli, kampachi, and duck are delish. The vegetables, alas, tend to get overlooked at one's peril. Cut carrots into canoe shapes, coat them in veal stock, and you can get anyone to nosh on them ad infinitum.

Third course: Foie gras, raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, Cabernet sauvignon reduction, and brioche. Ok, so maybe I will have to expiate for my two-day foie gras binge, but it is so bloody delicious. Add two butyraceous pieces of brioche and you have a winning - and Lipitor-inducing - combination.

Fourth course: Olive oil poached kampachi, pickled shitakes, tempura scallions, ginger foam. Poaching the kampachi lent a velvety texture. The pickled mushrooms and ginger were piquant. Tempura-coated scallions furtively blended into the ginger foam, detected only by their mountainous batter and the imbricating parlsey.

Fifth course: Duck breast, duck confit, chestnut purée, cipollini onion, duck cracklings, baby bok choy. The bok choy's size relative to the duck is a testament to Keller's reverence for vegetables. In general, an ancillary viand should not detract from the main ingredient. In this case, the bitter crucifer confidently towered over the supine, webbed-footed waddler. The cipollini onion topped with cracklings ought to be available to order by the half-dozen.

Intermezzo: Coconut tapioca soup, kiwi, tempura plantain, strawberry, passion fruit-coconut sorbet. If there is anything I would deem posh boba, this would definitely qualify.

Sixth course: Cappuccino with Bailey's ice cream and a chocolate-banana liquor fondant. I reluctantly passed up the coffee service for fear that caffeine at 8:30 would keep me up too late, yet I could not resist quaffing the iced cappuccino. The warm, lava-like fondant was rich, fit more for a chocolate fiend.

The petite fours and madeleines were as fresh as I remember. With affable service and delicious food, I would not mind dining at Fleur de Lys three more times.",OQjwZuE5xNJvbNoVl3zcgg,3,1,5,rFe878CltmVsO4vzPqqdKA

Thought i would give it a go, but did some research and knew i was going to a tapas style establishment.  friends and i started with the onion soup which was the best soup i have ever had - perhaps a but heavy handed with the truffle for some peoples taste but i loved the richness of the dish.  we also ordered the sliders, chicken wings and lobster mac and cheese.  the sliders were unreal - amazing seer on the burger with a fairly sharp blue cheese.  the lobster mac and cheese left something to be desired as the lobster wasnt all that prevalent.  the chicken wings were perfectly flavored with a sweet flavor that blended into a nice spice.

the wait staff was kind and enthusiastic, the cocktails were stiff and the bill was more then fair, in my opinion.

484623,2011-08-29,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this eponymous restaurant from Hubert Keller. The staff could not have been more friendly, but they failed to manage their ambiance well, and the food lacked consistency.

The biggest problem with the restaurant, in my opinion, is that the main dining room is totally open to the casino, which allows the loud cacophony of casino sounds into the ambiance of the dining experience. The clang and whir of slot machines, different rock and roll songs from multiple other open venues, and the continuous mumble and rumble of the migrating hordes intrude on your dining experience continuously. Do not expect to ""get away from it all"" at this restaurant. You'll be smack dab in the middle of the action while you try to concentrate on your tuna tacos. Music played in the dining room just added to the ruckus and made me wish I had brought earplugs. Overall a very jarring experience.

The food was creative but uneven. Of the five ""tapas"" I ordered, only two really satisfied: tuna tacos and lobster macaroni and cheese. The tiny tuna tacos burst with bright flavors that popped in your mouth. My only criticism: teasingly small. The macaroni showed nice restraint -- too many lobster or truffle dishes nowadays coat the mouth with richness. This one comes off as balanced, with a gentle, soothing effect that lingers. Happy food.

The rest of the dishes were less than stellar. The oyster presentation was a bit ridiculous, served atop a martini glass filled with blue steaming liquid. The earthy brine of the oysters did not marry well with the melon balls that were served atop them. Creative but not great. They also comped me a deep fried chicken nugget on mayonnaise and nuts. Not my thing?

The wine list showed ambition, but lacked commitment. It covers lots of ground, but most of the producers it features are garden variety.

On the other hand the staff was lovely and attentive. Dishes were whisked on and off of the table with impressive efficiency. Every request was greeted with cheerful enthusiasm, which helped make my overall experience a mildly positive one. 

I cannot honestly say I had a great first experience at Fleur, but considering the creativity and friendly attitude, I will definitely try it again.",yNMrtQogwAW9Poa3F8J6Ew,0,0,3,roYDd0VO3eGZnAEveGCdFg

anyway so why am i giving this place 4 stars? well when we got to our table everything changed. our server was great! i wish i remembered his name because i'd def recommend him. we got 4 course meals and as a vegetarian i'm telling you that it was worth it! the truffle soup was amazing!!! the portions were all perfect and by the end i was sooo stuffed that i couldn't finish my dessert but still did because it was so yummy! all the waiters and waitresses we met once we got our table were very nice so we ended up having a great night. at the end they gave us some chocolates to take home and they even looked into places we could go afterwards and their contacts there.  we honestly appreciated every bit of superior service from them.

We stopped to browse the menu and noticed a monitor nearby showing clips of Hubert Keller competing on Top Chef Masters. Being big fans of the show we were instantly sold. The big pull for us was the fact that prix fixe menu came with the ability to order wine pairings. I wish all restaurants did this, seriously. We canceled our reservation at Aquaknox to make room in our foodie itinerary to eat here. 

We both ordered the Elegance prix fixe with wine pairings. Each course came with a half glass of wine. We also received a sparking rose immediately after ordering which was a great way to start off the evening. (I should note that there is a less expensive prix fixe called Top Chef Masters but the menu did not indicate that there was a wine pairing option available.) 

I was extremely happy with the food here as was my husband. I highly recommend ordering the wine pairings with the prix fixe as the sommelier is truly talented at choosing wines that enhance the flavors of the food. For each course there is a choice of 2 to 3 dishes and my husband and I chose a wide variety of dishes. We each drank completely different wines as a result and got to enjoy the flavors of twice as many dishes. It was great!!  

We did notice another couple there sharing a prix fixe so if you are on a budget I am sure its not a problem. There is a small lounge in the front that has a tapas menu. If we didn't eat in the restaurant we probably would have considered a few cocktails and tapas in the lounge. 

This place is not for rowdy groups. Almost every single party was a couple on a date and the place was pretty mellow. There was a group of loud, drunk businessmen at the table next to us and I could tell every party nearby was really annoyed with them for disturbing the rest of us. 

One funny thing I noticed is that they play live music at across the way. It was like a Rock Band tribute band over there starting at about 10pm. We could tell the hosts were trying very hard to make sure the door stayed closed since the sound was very loud. I didn't mind, but others might find the music disturbing.

534575,2011-05-31,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Came here in April 2011 and it was a very disappointing experience! I made a reservation after my friends had raved about Fleur De Lys being the best dining experience they had in Las Vegas. After looking up the menu changes, I decided to give Fleur a try. I didn't think Hubert Keller could disappoint. 

I do have to disclose that I tried to cancel my reservation earlier that day. My group had decided we wanted to do something a lot more casual for dinner. Despite their 24 hour cancellation policy, I was told when I made the reservation that they're not strict about it and that as long as you call before your reservation, you won't be charged the ridiculous no-show fee. When I called, they gave me a lot of trouble, telling me that they had a ridiculously busy night and that cancelling the reservation would absolutely mean I'd be charged $50 per person. She even went as far to tell me that if I tried to pull a loophole on her by changing my reservation then canceling it 24 hours before my reservation, I would still be charged. Thank goodness my group of friends were troopers and decided to give the restaurant a try. 

When we got there, the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The lady on the phone emphasized how busy they were and were going out of their way to accommodate our large party of 9. There was plenty of room in the back in the 'real restaurant area' but we were put in the very front in the mall area. It felt like we were eating in a food court. 

The entire meal was a disappointment. The service was mediocre at best. We had a party of 9 so we were able to order a lot of plates off the menu. There were more than 3 dishes that the wait staff got wrong. We kept getting dishes we didn't order and we got repeats of dishes that were already served. When we pointed them out to the servers, they simply said ""The kitchen hates it when we send food back so just eat it."" 

The food was nothing spectacular. Not only did nothing taste particularly flavorful, nothing came out at the right temperature. Everything we ordered came luke warm. The server kept warning us that the lobster mac and cheese was extremely hot but it wasn't. We could've put our face to the baking dish without our skin turning red. The mussels were bland, the braised hamachi came highly recommended by the wait staff but it came swimming in so much sauce that you couldn't even tell you were eating fish. My friends ordered the Fleur burger but the waiter instructed them to pour the red wine reduction sauce all over the burger that it completely masked the taste of the wagyu, foie and truffle. The worst dish even though its a side dish must've been the Tarte Flambee. It was simply onions on flatbread, both underwhelming and tasteless. 

The only highlight to the meal was dessert. The chocolate souffle and the creme brulee trio were the only dishes that were satisfying.

After food, wine, tip and tax, the bill came out to $78 per person. It was an outrageous amount of money to have spent on a very lackluster meal.",ZHdIT0IQ5UgPHiq2akCw1A,4,0,1,6M-aUuMeqxQNJgaX-E0dwg

We started with a shot of absinthe each. We had never had it before and Fleur has a wide selection, complete with table side service. If you've never tried absinthe or had the experience of them ""making"" your drink next to our table, I highly recommend it. I ended up settling on the grilled octopus small plate and my boyfriend ordered the mac and cheese small plate. My octopus was delicious! It was layered with mushrooms and a delicious pepper aioli. The mac and cheese was creamy on the bottom and crispy and breaded on top, and the shrimp inside were cooked perfectly.

So back to the burger, I've been wanting to come and try the fleur burger since I've first heard of this wonderful creation a couple of years back. You get wygu beef cooked to a perfect medium rare, some foie gras and top it off with black truffles. Your mouth is watering right? Mine was too, the beef was perfect but at this point of my life I've had great burgers this is where the truffles and foie gras needed to shine. The foie was not rich or decadent it was just there, and the truffle seemed to have lost some flavor, perhaps next time shaved truffles instead of cooked ones to get the full earthy pungent flavors they provide. The burger was just ok for $70 I would have needed to agree with my food (shaking head up an down while chewing) and let out a ""Mmmm Mmmm"" maybe it was an off night, but like my wife said for a $70 burger they need to be on all the time.",Q3jDfPGr416JyG35ZbiPtg,1,0,2,JD3m-q-zTCcfsAfD8CPgBg

Now if you have had foie gras before, it is perfect because the sauce was excellent and it was made well. The onion soup had to have been the biggest surprise for me. I usually don't order soups or don't finish them, but this soup I had until the last spoonful. It was extremely good and I highly recommend it as a starter.

We were charged for 1 hanger steak, 26, and 1 Filet 42. I was a bit let down on that point, but the only reason I wasn't too angry was because I was so satisfied. The Filet was sooo freaking good.

I miss Fleur de Lys and have fond memories of the prior restaurant! The remodel made the restaurant more casual. Only the patio portion was available for seating for lunch; there was a football game playing in the bar area and sitting out in front of the restaurant provided a more sports bar feel and led to not so relaxing people watching, and a noise level I was not happy with in light of the busy weekend tourist crowd; the noise came from the surrounding people walking by the restaurant in itself was not busy. I think it would have done them well to open the main part of the restaurant for those patrons who would have preferred it. 

The only restaurant week offering was a short rib sandwich. The rib part was prepared well but the there was too much bread in the sandwich. The presentation was pleasant. Also, I had a Cesar salad, this was typical. Ice tea was brewed, but refills were few and far between. The most expensive ice tea I have found so far at $5. 

Food came out quick, which would have been great for a work lunch but when I wanted to enjoy a nice weekend lunch with my mother - not so much.

649336,2013-10-13,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"The service at Fleur was quite good.  My husband and I arrived on a Friday night just before 7pm.  We did not have reservations and we were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a nice relaxed vibe and the servers were very attentive.  We were presented with a tablet so that we could browse through the list of cocktails and wines, which is something I very much liked as you have the opportunity to search for wines you might like by selecting the flavor profiles you enjoy.

In terms of the food, I would say we were 50% impressed and 50% underwhelmed.  We ordered the following:

*  Ahi Tuna Tacos
*  Fried Mac and Cheese w/ Truffle Oil Peas and Ham
*  Braised Short Ribs
*  Fleur Burger - Wagyu Beef on a Brioche Bun
*  Chocolate Mousse

The Ahi Tuna Tacos were maybe about two and a half inches (3 total) and served on a crunchy shell.  The problem I found with this was that the shells were not crunchy enough.  I'm guessing that they had gotten a bit soggy when the cold tuna was placed in the shell.  As my husband would say, they were ""Meh.""

The Fried Mac and Cheese (3 total) were about three and a half inches in length and were quite good.  (I love Cajun food, so I would have liked a bit more spice, but I think most people would thoroughly enjoy this item as it is.)

Braised Short Ribs - The absolute BEST part of the meal.  The short ribs were extremely tender and were served with mashed fingerling potatoes.  

My husband ordered the Fleur Burger and he was really excited for it, but he ended up describing it as ""Meh.""  He said that it was cooked very well and it was very juicy, but he said it lacked any real flavor.  - It was served with a side of alfalfa sprouts, ketchup, and some sort of other dark sauce.  I took a bit and thought that it was indeed juicy, but it was kind of boring.  

For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Souffle, which was served with a side of cherry sauce/glaze that was poured over/into the souffle as well as a side of pistachio ice cream.  - I was completely overwhelmed with the dessert.  The souffle lacked any real flavor and was somewhat of a sad follow up to the amazing short rib entree that I had just consumed.  

The overall experience was pleasant and if we go back, we know that there are certain items we won't enjoy.  - The service is really what made the experience for us.",KomLUbYR1ApIvPSjCfeOdQ,0,0,3,XdP8R4JRlKwNjtB3WGUezw

That was 2 years ago, so when I got the chance to go again I jumped at it.
Unfortunately it is now Fleur and is pretty much a different restaurant. The ambience was gone thanks to the wall that was removed and the thumping 80's music from 
the bar across the casino floor. The food was mabe a 6 or 7 out of 10 where as before it was a solid 11.
So this time instead of the wonderfull free bread service I had to ask 3 times for bread and when it came it was dry stale and not even tasty, AND I had to pay for it. They had the nerve to charge for crappy bread rolls.
One of my friends dishes was cold in the middle and all the food was over all under seasoned.
The only thing that was the same was the price. I will happily pat 75 to 100 dollars per person for good food but spending $136 for food that was worth maybe worth $45 was very hard to take.

I am a huge fan of Hubert Keller from his appearances on Top Chef and was excited to try his food! 

I purchased a $50 gift certificate from Restaurant.com that only cost me $3! The only stipulation was that we spent at least $100 (not including alcohol) and you must tip on the original bill. This worked out great because we wanted to try a little bit of everything! 

I started off with a trio of martinis for about $18. They had a very reasonable Happy Hour including $3 domestic beers,but I wanted to get something I wouldn't normally order. My favorite martini out of the three was the Flirtini.

The plates here are small, but there was definitely a lot of flavor. We ordered the Croque Monseuir which is pretty much a grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Simple but delicious! The tuna tacos were one of my favorites but didn't impress my fellow diner as much. The braised Hamachi with soy ginger foam was a little overdone and salty. Not to mention that when one of the servers dropped it off he failed to tell me that the plate was extremely hot. Ouch. 

The chicken croquettes were super yummy. Only problem was there just wasn't enough on the plate. Despite all the small plates we ordered we still had room to order a couple of large plates as well. The braised short ribs were delicious, flavorful and tender. They were slightly sweet but well balanced. The Peking duck breast was a little less impressive, the duck was cooked well but I'm not sure it was a $30 dish. Probably could have just ordered a few more small plates for less and have been just as satisfied.

For dessert we ordered the creme brulee trio. The vanilla was by far the best, followed by Pistachio and then raspberry, which was a little too sweet. We ordered coffee (which is pressed at the table) and our server went back and made us fresh whipped cream to go on top. Delish! 

Service was attentive and friendly. We ate earlier in the evening so there weren't many guests there which is why I think we were so well attended to. Atmosphere is great but it is a little dark inside, which can be a good thing I guess. 

Not sure if I would put this restaurant on the top of my to do list on my next trip to Vegas with all the great food that the city has to offer but it was definitely one of my better experiences at a celebrity chef restaurant.",Lu2LOtJ3ugbeKhYpBYgPEw,1,1,4,lmdSYkPJsuJVrpG8a7Hs-g

I cannot recommend the flat iron steak with the chimichuri highly enough. It was perfect in every way. The oysters had by my girlfriend were presented in a great way, and evidently were amazing in the mouth.

828796,2013-05-14,3,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Oh where to start. How about a scenario - I had less than six hours of sleep for the past 36 hours, flying to Vegas, then head straight to a convention floor to assemble an exhibitor's booth, and computer networks, all while solving many other problems that cropped up unexpectedly. I was without a lunch, afternoon snack, or even a fruit smoothie; a frustrating evening was upon me. As I began my walk back to my hotel room for an evening of in-room dining and sleeping, I find myself Fleur restaurant. Exhausted, famished, frustrated, and not feeling dietary disciplined for the evening, I decided to help myself to some cultural exploration and have some steak.

==Enchanted Apple Cocktail==
Starting the evening right, with a drink! I selected this drink because I like to eat apples, and I thought, why not. This drink is light and sweet, and has a hint of licorice. With the salt around the rim of the glass adds the most contrasting of flavors in every sip. Try this drink! 

==Hanger Steak==
Man, talk about deliciousness! Perfectly seared, and cooked to a nice medium rare, easily cut with a fork and knife. Melt in your mouth texture. Perfectly seasoned, enjoyable by itself. The added touches of the shallot sauce and pico de gallo really add a serious amount of flavor to the steak. The shallot sauce, while discernible from the savory steak, does not overpower the steak. Both complement each other and offer a new experience. The pico de gallo also is a nice touch - for me, it seemed to cleanse my taste buds, getting ready for the next bite. 

==Sides==
I also ordered asparagus and polenta to share with my officemates - both were enjoyed with great satisfaction. Actually, that is the first time I had polenta - I think I need to start experimenting more with polenta in my personal pursuits. It was pretty tasty. 

==Service==
Service was top notch, our waiter kept our waters filled, made recommendations of tea for desserts, even told us some of the ingredients in dishes that weren't listed on the menu. Nice touch! Even told us how long it takes to prepare dessert, given certain time constraints. Our waiter was attentive and perceptive, bravo sir. 

==Conclusion==
I wouldn't mind eating here again if I was in the area, in fact, I'll make a point of it to visit this restaurant at least once the next time I'm in the Mandalay Bay. For the experience of great food, great service, and relaxing atmosphere, stop by Fleur and have a meal. 

==Note==
We came here on a Monday evening, when it was hardly busy - I doubt that I could ever walk in here again at a random interval, given all the other times I've passed here, it's always jammed packed.",cnVxeco9iKF0et5YZvKrsg,5,4,5,BExCuBQ2DX8Tf2FTNlNKOg

Ambiance 4

Been wanting to try the notorious master chef's restaurant for a while now; got a discount from using a restaurant.com certificate which made the whole dining experience more affordable. 

Food I've tried:
Ahi tuna taco was light and decent, nothing extraordinary. 
Lobster mac and cheese was yummy but a tad cold and on the heavy side, but Definitely well worth. 
Halibut was cooked right, sauce is light and is somewhat sweet for my liking.
Short rib was succulent and melts in your mouth. 
Garlic fries was not overwhelmingly garlicky and had a touch of butter which made the fries more fragrant and delicious. 
Chocolate souffle was light and not too sweet. Just perfect!

The food came out extremely fast, just only wished the mac and cheese and the entrees were hot instead of warm. 

Service was great, exactly what you would expect from a four star restaurant.  Staff was super attentive; refilled waters and changed our plates and utensils several times. 

Will definitely come back and try the fleur burger. Since California is banning foi gras, I will have to get my fixing in Vegas!",lKYm3FSl_OrODg21SAL5mw,0,0,4,SpYrwS7nm2kYg6cQMEkVtw

The food was excellent, but it couldn't outweigh the bad hosts/hostesses, bad waiting, and DOUBLE CHARGES on my card.  For full disclosure, we had a group of 25 dining, but had booked 2 months in advance, we were all on one check, and the restaurant only had three or four other tables of 2 people each dining at any one point in the night.  We arrived and had a few drinks while they were getting our table ready.  Some simple questions to the host and hostess about how they wanted to handle the large alcohol tab we were running up - did they want to just add it to the table total or not - were met with listless responses and flippant passing remarks.  We sat down and it took about 30 minutes to get half of the tables' drink orders from two waiters - all of which were non-alcoholic because we were confused by the host/hostess about the original drink orders up front.  The other half of the table did not get their drink orders taken at all, we had to get up and catch a waiter to let them know that they missed them.  We ordered the tapas style courses, and although I am fully aware of the concept, there should be enough single-bites for every person to at least get one bite.  Sorry, not the case.  Several people were left without food, and please keep in mind that they knew the size of our party 2 months ahead of time.  I had to tell them to please increase the quantities they were serving to at least feed everyone at the table.  Despite the lack of enough food, what we were able to try was really good.  I signed the $3000 check, filled out the survey letting them know my disappoint, and moved on.  Flash forward to three weeks later, with no calls from Fleur management about anything at all.  I get a call from my bank telling me that it seems Fleur has DOUBLE CHARGED ME with each charge three weeks apart and the bank froze my account for fear of fraud.

we had the 3 small items of the menu, each at $3 
seasoned popcorn, fry chick peas and marinated olives.
all 3 lacked much taste. honestly hubert - you should cut down on the portion in at least 66% and you can give all 3 items complimentary on each table. its like bread or the great french fries they give free at the steak house a cross the hall (stripsteak) and will just show some class!

we had the fish tacos which lacked seasoning and were very very very small (again much better tacos we had at border grill also few restaurants away belonging to very famous chefs). if this was suppose to be mexican - it lacks the salsa. if this was asian - maybe aoily sauce...anything to help the hard taco shell go down and taste of anything

the palenta was very tasty. the meat balls were tasty as well but not very memorable.
the sliders were very very good, juicy and tasty

all in all, very small portions even for tapas style meal. most dishes were very ordinary.
we had much higher expectation from huber and unfortunatly they were not found.
both restaurants i mentions in this review are only few doors down from the location and were both much much better. so was rm seafood.

877350,2010-02-24,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I am giving Fleur de Lys only three stars because I expected so much more -- you can get a more innovative and fantastic meal for the same price elsewhere in Vegas. My mother and I arrived a bit earlier than our reservation, so we had a seat at the bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. While I normally start with a straight gin martini, my eye was caught by the cucumber martini, with house-made cucumber-infused vodka. So I ordered it, and was horrified to watch the bartender pull out a plastic jug from the refrigerator and dump a green liquid directly into a (not chilled) martini glass and hand it to me. To me, this is unacceptable at a high-end restaurant. Drinks should not be pre-mixed, and a martini should be chilled, not refrigerator temperature. On top of that, the drink tasted like juice.

Onto dinner. For the most part, it was perfectly nice. Not spectacular, but very nice. I had a fixed price menu (not the $65 early bird menu, but the regular fixed price menu). The truffled onion soup to start was very nice, though I thought it could have used a bit of salt, which was not provided. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine -- I appreciate that chefs theoretically are making their meal exactly as you should eat it, and so I always try it their way first, but taste buds are different (and, let's be honest, some nights the chef might be off his game). That said, the soup had a braised duck crepe in it that was wonderful. 

My next course was a ravioli (I can't remember exactly what the filling was), which was much tastier and seasoned properly, with a lovely rich sauce. Then i had a steak, which was of really exceptional quality and melted in my mouth. Nothing special about the steak preparation -- sauce wasn't particularly amazing, but the quality was great and it was cooked perfectly. Dessert was good, not great.

To reiterate, the food was really very good, just not worth the price, in my opinion. Service was impeccable, and the manager was incredibly helpful when I had forgotten my restaurant.com gift certificate, in that he was happy to take the number of the certificate off of my iphone in lieu of the hard copy. He wasn't obligated to do that, and I really appreciated it.",PV8Gr9v-4B4nBsMUuc_aRA,0,0,3,l54WFy3mBBjgAX1TzUZOXQ

932943,2011-01-11,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I was hugely disappointed in this place.

But let me explain.  I was very hyped up to eat here having heard how great it was.  We got a little worried when we learned later that this was no longer Fleur de Lys but became just ""Fleur"" and started serving tapas.  No matter though!

The decor and atmosphere were pretty nice though.  It was very pretty and you were able to see the wine storage room from the bottom floor.  I guess there's ONE dining table in the wine storage area (it's a really cool looking area).  But uh, ladies... don't get a table there and wear a skirt.  Everyone on the bottom floor can almost see up your skirt.

The service was good.  Waiters were friendly and attentive.  So far... this place is doing well.  Ok, now on to the more important stuff. 

We each ordered drinks.  Now mixed drinks started at $15, which is pretty pricey and they went up to $35.  I'm talking mixed drinks, not wines and the like (which obviously can go much higher).  I ordered the Absinthe Frappe, which wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing.  My dining partners all thought their drinks were decent but not great (as in wasn't worth $15).  We would have no problems with the drinks at $10, but for $15 or more we would've expected it to make us nod and say ""wow, this is pretty good.""

Now on to the food:

Paprika Popcorn.  It wasn't bad, but it tasted seriously like popcorn with some salt and paprika.  It WAS the cheapest thing on the menu so ok, sure.  We got it because we figured it would be something to munch on while we waited for the other things to come.   But it was really quite small and we easily finished it way too quickly.

Oysters.  I'm not a fan of oysters so I can't talk about the taste.  On the other hand the presentation?  Incredibly cool.  Dry ice and mist rising from a really cool looking contraption.  The oysters themselves were small and you only get 3.  Friends said it tasted pretty good but not great and it they were small oysters.

Chicken Croquette w/ Water Cress salad.  This was actually pretty tasty.  but you got 4 fish stick sized croquettes with some water cress salad on it.  Pretty tasty though.

Risotto.  I thought it was pretty good myself.  Not amazing but pretty good.  My friend who likes risotto though says she has had much better, though it was decent.

Mushroom Ragout.  I actually liked this quite a bit.  The mushrooms were tasty and well seasoned.  Of course I the problem is probably could've eaten the whole thing in 2 or 3 mouthfuls though (but then again you normally don't shove that much food in your mouth at once when you're fine dining).

Hamachi.  This was quite tasty.  The fish was good and the shittake mushrooms underneath were flavorful and tasty.  Definitely not a lot though.

Mac & Cheese.  Mac and Cheese and lobster seems to be a really  popular combination.  I liked it.  I've had mac & cheese + lobster in multiple places though and it wasn't any better than the other places.  My friends also agreed other places had better Mac & Cheese + Lobster.  But personally I thought it was pretty tasty.  Small portions though (see a trend?) .  I'd say you got about as much as two and a half tea cups (the ones you use in a Chinese restaurant).

Onion Soup.  It was pretty tasty.  It comes with 4 shot glasses filled with soup.  Well they're probably the size of 2 shots, but pretty much you get the equivalent of 8 shots of soup.  Fairly tasty.

Sliders.  The sliders themselves were quite tasty.  The meat was tender, juicy and flavorful.  The fries... well you got like 10 fries.  And they're not like steak fries.  Imagine getting 10 McDonalds fries. And they were just ok.

Personally the rating break down goes something like this:

Ambience: Great

So, we mentioned something to our waiter, we told him we had time restraints. He was quick to apologize and the rest of the meal flowed nicely and timely.

Truffled Onion Soup with duck ragout got us started. And Chardonnay was the selected pairing. Both were delicious.

2nd course followed, with gently heated salmon with apple rosemary puree, it was beautifully prepared. It was paired with Pinot Grigio.

Veal and potato ravioli wasn't the most striking dish, but it made up for what it lacked in looks with flavor. It was paired with a lovely Pinot Noir.

Alaskan halibut and mussels. It was fresh and nicely done.

Moving onto the main course, Filet and short rib each were served with a vegetable puree. All were quite good. Wine pairings were Chianti and Cabernet Sauvignon.

Desserts followed, chocolate soufflé ($6 upcharge), carrot cake with pineapple sorbet, and a dessert trio. The cake and sorbet were unmemorable but the peanut butter with baileys milkshake was delicious. I could've drank those all day and night. A Port was served with the soufflé and the other was a dessert wine, I cannot remember it's name; it was similar to, but far less cloying than Moscato.

We were brought the check, petite fours and I was given a pink rose, taken from the piece on the wall. Of all the sweet treats it was the gummy lychee treat that left a lasting impression, The final tab was around $430 before tip (3 elegance menus and two wine pairings).

It was quite enjoyable, but it's not one we'll be repeating. While everything was done well, nothing raised the culinary bar so to speak.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,1,3,lLPxPEKRrd9omH_R3jvFlQ

So, I was really looking forward to an excellent food experience at Fleur.  From the start, I was mildly disappointed.  The hostess wasn't very friendly, and the restaurant itself had an overly  casual bar feel to it.  It was also loud for a while because there was a live band playing just across the way.  The menu of small and large plates is huge with many exciting options, but  unfortunately many fell flat for me.  The lobster mac and cheese was way too mild and not very flavorful.  The duck was really tender but could have used more zing to the flavors.  The accompanying braised veggies ( rhubarb, celery, and chipolini onion) were not appetizing at all - they looked limp and were oily and flavorless.  My favorite was the garlic fries which were incredibly rich due to the truffle oil.  The service was inconsistent.  Drinks were not refilled after the first refill, and it took an unexpectedly long time for extra things that were requested (e.g., lime) to be brought to the table.  The serviced really dropped off toward the end of the meal when we felt a bit overlooked.  There also seemed to be problems with expediting the food in a reasonable time period.  Even though all the dishes don't need to come out at the same time, we had to wait so long for our last plate (the truffle fries) that we thought they had forgotten about them.   While this wasn't a horrible dining experience, it was a bit frustrating because I had such high hopes for Hubert Keller's food, and the flavors just weren't there.  But then again, I fear that Fleur may just be one of those trendy Vegas places where the chef puts his name on it but doesn't leave his mark anywhere else.",25lrlCp87N0jG8XMF75_Rg,0,0,3,yYfjT63MRxsTVJ4Hx99Ucg

FOOD: We started with the parmesan popcorn, which was a fun, tasty dish.  From there, we moved to good, but in the end, forgettable bread, meat and cheese trays.  Other dishes that were good, but again, not special included olives, risotto, skirt steak with chimichuri, lobster mac 'n cheese (inspired by Keller's Top Chef dish prepared in a dorm shower, and steak tartare.    For dessert we had tiramisu, brownie lollipops, panne cotta, PB&J (macaroons), and coconut cake.  Again, they were all good, but not great.

There were two notable dishes:

Crab avocado spheres, which were absolutely beautiful, but the only poor tasting dish (the crab was mushy and got lost in the avocado and the watermelon gazpacho).

The Gnocchi was excellent... Subtle, but with a great balance between the gnocchi, cheese and pesto (and I am not a pesto fan).

SERVICE: Our waitress was very good (friendly, knowledgable about the menu), but the rest of the staff was spotty-- our water was rarely refilled.

ATMOSPHERE: In effect, there are two sections.  The front part of the restaurant seems reserved for casual diners (shorts, hats, etc), with the back room for more business casual diners.  It was relatively quiet, and had a nice relaxed, but hip feel.

IN SUM, Fleur was a nice dining experience, but I expected better.  Everything was good, but out of about 15 or so dishes, only one was memorable or special.  It's not quite four stars (I'd go 3.5 if I could).",xrboR3aar6AoNllo03HAhw,1,1,4,L5I4ABsTPnWvI6Ul2Rd2UQ

I ate here 3 years ago on a business trip and thought that the fish dish I ordered was very well prepared and delicious.  I also tried their tuna taco and was dreaming about it a few weeks later.  

Last weekend, I was back with my family and had a great experience here.

Appetizers:
- Onion soup with truffle for $10: as good as it gets.  The lightness of the soup flavor hits your palette, then you taste the onion flavor and a creamy aftertaste finishes things off.  3 people were able to shared the delight fullness of this dish. 
- Carpaccio: Delicious.  So fresh, light, and elegant.  The Arugula blended so well with the carpaccio.

Main course:
1)  Wagu Burger, Truffler, Faio gras: Delicious.  One of the best and  tastiest burgers I've tried.  The sesame bun is so yummy as well.   One small critique is that the bottom bun got a bit 'soggy' with all juices and sort of crumbled as I inhaled the burger.  Is it worth $70? yes, we need to enjoy life.

2) Lomo Saltado: I might have spelled this incorrectly.  This is a good dish. The rice is uniquely made, with a touch of spiciness.  The steak is wonderful.   

3) Braised short rib: Big piece of butter and tender short rib.  Made with fantastic mashed potato, bits of bacon, pearl onion, and mushrooms on the side.

4) Side order of Lobster: solid.  Nothing special but nothing to complain about.

3 people shared in all of these dishes and we were NOT able to finish everything.

Desserts:
- Shorbet and ice cream: Wonderfuly.  The Peach sorbet is delicious.
- Cream Brulee: Another solid dish.  Nohting to complain about.
- Lollipop sundae: Great for kids.
- French pressed coffee: Fantastic.

The entire family said we would love to return to try the other dishes.  Would like to try the fried octopus, flatbread, and shrimps and grits.

Last but not least, a few weeks ago, I saw Hubert himself walking into work.  I greeted him and asked for a picture.  He obliged, showing great humbleness.  It speaks volume for his quality of his restaurant!!!!",PNWBrddca2TomDWw8n-UJw,1,1,5,Dkh_nLDs-Y4scZuakfGFLw

Earlier in the day, I had seen some people on the patio having some amazing looking desserts, so I asked the host if he would mind if we stopped by for dessert after dinner.  We were pleasantly surprised at how welcoming he was of us stopping in for just dessert on a busy Saturday night.   

After a terrific dinner at StripSteak (Roasted Beet Salad is a fantastic starter), we strolled over to Fleur de Lys at about 10:30P.  Most of the dinner crowd was thinning and the host welcomed us back for dessert.  We sat in the intimate lounge that sits behind the large velvety curtains that lead to the main dining room.

Service was prompt and gracious.  We ordered three desserts to share (I know, we like our sweets): The Coconut Tapioca Soup; the Madeleines with chocolate ganache; and the assorted ice creams.  Of the three, the Coconut Tapioca Soup was the most memorable.  The tapioca and coconut soup had just the right amount of sweetness and rich cocounut flavor that blended perfectly with the passion fruit sorbet that brought traditional south east Asian flavors to new heights.  The assorted ice creams were respectable, but nothing special, while the Madeleines were delicate and light as air.

Our biggest disappointment was that Fleur de Lys was dark on Sunday, so we couldn't come back to experience dinner the next night.  Smaller disappointment was the coffee.  For a restaurant of its calibre, Fleur de Lys needs to do better than thin tasteless coffee from the presse.

A few friends and I came here for dinner before a concert in the Mandalay and while we chose it based on convenience, we were not disappointed. The food here is great and the portions are very generous. For tapas-like appetizers, we had more than enough for everyone to have a good portion (we shared 4) including the beef heart, octopus, chestnut soup and crispy potatoes (papas). All were great but the octopus really stood out - perfectly grilled. 

For the main, my steak with Peruvian fried rice was awesome. The steak was really big (double the size I expected) and was cooked beautifully. The friend rice was great. Overall quite heavy but very good. Others at my table were happy with the quail and scallops. While some dishes don't come with a side, the portions are quite large so unless you're a really voracious eater, it is not necessary to pay for a side (and the sides are definitely large enough to share for 2-3 people).

We had 

Burrata salad, duck terrine and beef carpaccio tacos (for the grown ups)

All were delicious with the burrata salad and duck terrine being the standouts. The staff was friendly and helpful (especially given that we were in a rush to get to our show).

For a fancy French restaurant, I was impressed with the understated elegance of the space.  Gorgeous floor to ceiling curtains add a soft contrast to the rose adorned stone wall.  The wine cellar on the second floor is definitely eye catching, but again, nothing over the top.  I wasn't a huge fan of the narrow, cramped lounge area in the front where we were asked to wait for our table.  The ""patio"" bar seating area outside the restaurant is less than stellar unless you like people walking up to your table to read the menu that's right in front of your table.  Past 10pm, you can hear the live band playing from across the hall, which I imagine can get a little annoying if you're there for an intimate dinner.

The four course tasting menu certainly had its highlights.  The truffled onion soup is the star of the tasting menu.  This is a masterfully executed dish - this is coming from a guy who's not a huge fan of onions either.  Flavors are delicately balanced.  Five stars.  I'm a short ribs fanatic and I have to admit I was not very impressed with my dish. The potato and carrot puree was incredible, but the short ribs was a bit tough and stringy on the outside - not fork tender.  I'd say 3.5 stars.  My friends ordered souffle - top drawer.  The salted fondit chocolate cake and popcorn ice cream was intriguing - if you like salty sweet flavors combined together.  On average, the food was 4 stars,

The execution of the dishes and particularly the service is where Fleur de Lys falls short of its five star reputation.  My friend's bacon wrapped seabass was cold and so she waited while we finished our second course before her replacement dish came out.  I understand these things happen, but this is a JV mistake at a varsity level restaurant.  Some of my fellow yelpers commented on the lackluster service.  We definitely felt that.  Beautifully prepared plates were destroyed due to poor presentation by the servers.  Dishes were nearly dropped.  Service felt too clinical, lacking in any warmth.  The bright star of course was the sommelier who offered a great wine pick from the menu.  Otherwise, I'd rate the service a 3.

For the most accurate gauge, I'd say the original SF outpost for a taste of Fleur de Lys' true potential.  Vegas outpost isn't bad at all, but it's not five star worthy in my book.",bfsX2VxPkZxiA-Hj-RHT4g,1,1,4,9Fi4P4E6JStXNLUXjXUn6A

1265680,2009-12-01,3,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I should learn to be less trusting.

I've already learned the hard way not to trust them when they say, ""Trust me, I'm a lawyer."" And that's coming from an ex-lawyer, so you can trust me.

I am inclined to believe ""Trust me, I'm a doctor,"" and even ""Trust me, I'm a Michelin starred chef.""

But I'm starting to question ""Trust me, I'm the executive chef at a celebrity chef's Las Vegas outpost."" 

You see, the Chef's Tasting menu at Fleur de Lys is not listed. You tell them if you have any allergies or if there's anything you don't eat. Besides that, you're in the chef's hands. In this case, Executive Chef Steve Wolf.

Now, here's the thing. I'm not really sure if the ever changing chef's menu is really Chef Hubert Keller's menu, Chef Wolf's menu, or Chef Wolf channeling Chef Keller's menu. So I'm not really sure where to lay the blame for a meal that was, well, hit and miss. Don't get me wrong, there were some outstanding dishes. But there were also some dishes that missed the mark enough to make me question if they were coming from the same chef.

Let's start with the positives. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. A towering space with walls of stacked stone, heavy floor to ceiling dark curtains, an imposing second floor wine cellar behind glass, and an ""eye"" of orange roses watching over a dining room of white tablecloths and brown leather banquettes and chairs. It's masculine and luxurious and opulent.

The service is also top notch, finding that balance between attentiveness and unobtrusiveness.

And the menu had some high points. Some very high points. But the lows brought it back down to earth.

We started with an amuse of dungeness crab and avocado sphere in a watermelon gazpacho. If the amuse was to capture the essence of the meal, I would have been very happy. It was delicious, tart and refreshing. It held out the promise of a great meal.

We moved on to the 1st course of ahi tuna tartare over a shaved fennel slaw in ginger ponzu, topped with a fennel seed tuile. An ahi tuna tartare seemed like a safe, if uninspired choice, to start the meal. I've had many, as I'm sure you have, and this one was good without being remarkable. The fennel slaw beneath it was a nice touch, giving it some textural difference but the ginger ponzu sauce was overpoweringly sour.

Next up was the truffled onion soup with a braised duck ragout and shaved black truffles. The braised duck ragout was served in a small rolled crepe in the middle of the dish, with the soup poured around it. This dish was the highlight of the meal. The onion soup was sweet and rich, with the taste of the truffles coming on in the end notes. The truffles were more pronounced in the crepe itself.

Third course was veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli with a sunchoke foam and English peas. The potato ravioli were very soft and tender and the veal jus lent a concentrated meaty flavor to the dish. Another good dish.

The next course was hamachi with a ginger aromatic foam and tempura scallions. My first and lasting impression was that the ginger foam was salty. This is one of the dishes that really threw me with the heavy handedness of the seasoning.

The final meat course was the Colorado rack of lamb with charred corn cous cous, mango chutney and a carrot curry sauce. The lamb was on the rare side of medium rare, just how I like it, but again the sauce was a salt lick. Salty to the point of obliterating the other tastes. The addition of curry introduced an odd flavor profile into the meal. It just seemed incongruous with the rest of the tasting menu. If I didn't know better, I'd have wondered if that plate had come from the same kitchen or even restaurant.

The intermezzo was a passion fruit and coconut sorbet on a streusel crust in a coconut soup with tapioca balls, strawberry, kiwi and plantain. I loved the coconut soup with tapioca balls. Just like an upscale boba and a perfect palate cleanser after the two salt bombs. The sorbet was also very good. This course set the meal back on track.

Dessert was sauterne marinated pears on a cinnamon crust and cinnamon ice cream with a walnut sesame crisp. The ice cream was good but the highlight was the cinnamon crust the dessert sat on. Delicious. The kitchen also sent out two glasses of complimentary sauterne to pair with the dessert to make up for the lamb dish. A nice gesture and a nice way to end the meal.

Finally, a small tray of lemony madeleines with a chocolate dipping sauce. 

And an autographed copy of Hubert Keller's book ""Burger Bar"", a rose from the aforementioned ""eye"" and personalized menus of the night's meal. A nice touch even if a couple of the courses on the menu were not what we had received.

So there you have it. A meal, on the one hand, that exercised some restraint in bold flavors and two dishes that exhibited a heavy handedness in their seasoning and discordant flavor profiles.

But who am I to judge?

Just trust me. I'm a food blogger.",Ige3GC0ADiKjbps8FWbsDA,5,6,4,ssAizDirPAyAkLFt-cFexg

The 2 things I actually liked was the caviar and table side ice cream.
-The server made the ice cream right infront of us with nitrogen something.
-The caviar (my first time) was presented really beautiful and was good I think.

braised short ribs - this was a solid dish. I can see why it's loved by so many patrons. Call me a snob but it's a great dish only for the unadventurous. Any good restaurant should be able to produce a dish like this.

Maybe it's a celebrity chef sorta thing, but I've been wanting to try this place out since Top Chef Masters. Yeah... maybe I'm a sucker for these sorta things and hey, Hubert Keller probably doesn't even cook there... but hey, the food was excellent!

I went here with my girlfriend to celebrate five months together. I had found gift certificates on Restaurant.com and I thought, hey, why not?

We arrived on time to our 9:00pm reservation all dressed up and were seated immediately in a swank dining room with some mood music and between black curtains. Upon sitting down, though, we realized we had forgotten our gift certificate. Luckily I still had the email on my phone... but would they accept it? I asked our server the next time she came 'round and she wasn't sure, but she would ask her manager. Sure enough... it looked like they wouldn't take it. =/ Oh well... stuff like this happens.

We decided to both go for the elegance menu as it would mean 8 different dishes between the two of us for $79/person. The entrees were around $50 a la carte and the apps were around $20... so, why not do the prix fixe? 

After some delicious bread (rosemary foccacia and honey wheat rolls), we got our amuse busche - tempura cod and potato salad with cayanne creme fraiche. It was pretty cute - sorta like a play on fish and chips =) 

And remember when the manager came by and said he wouldn't take our coupon off email? Well, he came back and suggested something else - if I could send the confirmation email to him, he would print it out and apply it for us. Really? REALLY. AWESOME! There's another star right there!

The rest of the night just went up from there. Here are the highlights:

1st course:
Truffled Onion  Soup with Braised Duck Ragout- my girlfriend definitely won this one. The soup was amazingly creamy and delicious and the duck inside the crepe was just money. *drool*
Ahi Tuna Tartare - This one was alright. I think I've had better tartares before... the fennel was definitely a little different and was good, but not my favorite flavor, I think.

2nd course:
Citrus glazed halibut - the halibut was alright, but what really blew me away was the broccoli puree. I haven't had purees much... I usually don't eat at such fancy places... but this stuff blew my mind. It tasted so freakin' good... like pure essence of broccoli. How the heck did they do that?!
Braised Veal and Yukon Gold Potato Ravioli - This one came out pretty good, too. The potato inside the ravioli was so flavorful... 

3rd Course:
Filet mignon + foie gras and truffles - This was probably THE BEST cooked piece of meat I've EVER eaten - PERFECTLY medium rare - it practically melted in my mouth... and the foie gras... the first time I've had that and the stuff just MELTED over the meat... so freakin' delicious. I'm usually not a fan of liver, but this stuff was just like butter. Paired with the filet, it was AMAZING. Totally worth the extra $25. The mashed potatoes (which was more like a puree) was equally delicious.
Stout Braised Beef Short Ribs - These were really good, too. I have to say that the mustard was my favorite part about it - but again, some of the most tender and well cooked meat I've ever had.

Dessert - 
Chocolate Souffle - Not too shabby.... not a huge chocolate fan, but my girlfriend loved it.
Carrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich - Carrot cake is great, but this went beyond simple carrot cake. It was simply heavenly. The carrot-pineapple ice cream they served it with was sweet, but not overly so. And I absolutely LOVED the raspberry jam smeared on the side of the ice cream sandwich. *drool* I think if I only had the filet and this for dinner, I would've been completely satisfied.

We were also served a complimentary anniversary dessert - a play on cheesecake with scripted ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate. I'm tellin' yah, service here is tops!

We were also served a Petit four at the end, which came with five little dessert pieces. I think the actual desserts we had were much better... but all the little extras were great =)

All in all, some of the best food we've ever had and excellent service.

I came to the Mandalay Bay which to be honest, I rarely come because I actually had tickets to the MJ One show. After yelping some places to eat around Mandalay Bay, I was super excited to find out that there were two joints opened by HUBERT KELLER!!

I'm a huge fan of Hubert Keller especially after his debut on Top Chef Masters. I was really rooting for him the first season to win! I also have always wanted to eat at his restaurant in SF at Fleur des Lys so when I found out he had Fleur in Mandalay Bay, I quickly made a RSVP before the show.

The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived, given that my RSVP was at 5:30 bc we had the 7:00 tickets to the MJ show, and we got sat down inside very quickly. It was super dark inside that we had to request moving to different tables bc it was too dark for some people to read the menu. Our waiter was nice, attentive, good at recommendations and any questions we had.

Half ordered the MJ prix fixe menu while half ordered a bunch of little dishes to share. Some things ordered was the shrimp ceviche, ahi tacos, beef sliders, skirt steak, Caesar salad, corn soup, and Fleur burger. 

Everything tasted pretty mediocre. I was slightly disappointed especially since I had high expectations of this place and also that I had told my party that dinner would be good. Majority of my party was not satisfied with their meal and was highly disappointed as well. The sliders were okay. Good meat patties but kinda dry and needed some sort of sauce to it to counteract the dryness. The shrimp ceviche should really NOT be called ceviche. Normally, a ceviche is cooked in the juices of some sort of citrus juice like lemon or lime but this ""ceviche"" was basically drowned in a cold cucumber soup. The cucumber dressing was really bland and had no flavor to it and the accompaniments was really minimal. Couldn't find a single tomato or avocado in that small dish. The ahi tacos were good. Good slab of tuna but could have used more sauce in the tiny tiny taco. Salad was mediocre and corn was okay. Nothing too spectacular just ok. We ended the night with some brownie pops which again, kinda misleading. I was expecting kind of like a brownie cake pop but it's more like a chocolate truffle on a stick with some caramel. It was way too sweet even for a sweet tooth lover like me.

Overall, my dinner was fine. But for a highly rated restaurant, I was expecting more especially one that's owned by Hubert Keller. I think I made the mistake of eating at Fleur instead of going to Burger Bar. Maybe next time I'll go back to Mandalay Bay and have better luck at his burger joint instead.",-LhU9PZZKaP_xFa_rjo9jQ,1,1,3,IQlViHrjSrPgYNZ1Jv97RQ

I chose one of their signature cocktails, the ""Up in Smoke"".  This drink was delicious and smoky, along the lines of a Manhattan or Old-Fashioned style cocktail.  The only appetizer I sampled was the beef burger slider; it was rich (high quality meat) and the brioche bun held up well.

For my main meal I chose a bowl of the white onion soup and their 8oz filet.  The soup was subtle in taste and slightly creamy making for a great starter.  The filet mignon was cooked just right (a perfect medium rare) and came served in a moat of brown / burgundy style sauce sauce and creamy potatoes.

1331898,2013-04-20,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"My advice would be to skip it.

We went to Vegas for my sister's 25th birthday and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. Initially I had made reservations at Aureole. We were looking around at menus and found the menu at Fleur to be more appetizing, so we switch at the last minute. BIG mistake.

First of all, Fleur is not a nice restaurant. It has no outer walls so people walking by/being loud can disrupt your meal. They also have this cheesy poster thing outside that made me feel like I was going to a random sushi restaurant in Brooklyn.

Second, our waiter was probably the most awkward person I've ever encountered in a restaurant. The restaurant is tapas-style and the menu is nothing like what they have online. We ordered a bunch of tapas since we had a large lunch and were still a bit stuffed. Some people in our party ordered larger tapas. We assumed they'd bring our tapas out together since well, they're tapas and meant to be shared. That was not the case. They brought out all but two dishes and we waited a really, really long time (about 30 minutes) for those two dishes. Just as we were about to cancel them, our waiter said, ""Oh, they are the second course."" Huh? Why the heck would two people want to eat while everyone else watched? They obviously forgot about those dishes and at the last minute brought them out.

I was about to refuse but my husband doesn't like me to make a scene.

Anyway, then when it came to the dessert portion, I expected them to bring something out for my sister since they asked me what the occasion was when I made the reservation.

But no. Our awkward waiter brings out the dessert menu, asks what everyone wants (no one wanted anything, we just wanted to get out of there) and needed to be reminded by me and another person in our party that its her birthday. Then he got defensive when we reminded him. Awesome. She eventually got the brownie lollipops.

To top it all off, there was no apology or compensation for the huge lag time between our ""first and second courses"". 

This place was empty every night we passed by. In a place like Vegas where fancy and delicious food is a dime a dozen, this place won't last. Do yourself a favor and don't subject yourself to awkward, slow service.",x6Y0UzJsX8AiYlT3Q-BMFQ,0,0,2,EvgPvZSNeY8uyh9hdSy8sQ

We were served our Cesare salad and before we were even half through, our server asked if it would be ok if they brought the entree out since it was ""ready"".  We relunctantly agreed, only to be served the wrong order (they brought the chicken with the cabbage instead of the duck).  Off went both entrees to be remade.  While waiting, I asked the server to please place an order for the souffle so it would be ready when we finished our meal.

The dinners were good, though my duck skin was not as crispy as I'd hoped.  Server cleared our plates, asked if we wanted anything else, and proceeded to bring our check.  We were too aggravated to tell him he had forgotten about our souffle.  Another 15 dollars they threw away to bad service.

Fleur, located inside the Mandalay Bay Casino, was a relatively quick walk from the conference center and looked pleasant enough so I  made a reservation via OpenTable (although it was not busy enough that I needed a reservation).

I had the ""la scala's style chopped"" salad with chicken.  Essentially a romaine salad with soppressata, mozzarella, olives and beans in a vinaigrette.  I added a bit of extra protein by adding an organic chicken breast.  My friend had their field greens salad (which included pear, apple and walnuts) and topped it with shrimp (note that the extra price for the shrimp was a bit outrageous, as the shrimp ""add on"" costs only $1 less than the salad itself).  She enjoyed her salad and shrimp.  I also enjoyed my salad, which was a healthy size, with the exception of the chicken.  Clearly tasting like it was cooked hours in advance (or perhaps even a day in advance), it was refrigerator cold and completely dry.  I could have had chicken that tasted like that at the convention center; I had expected more from a  restaurant bearing Mr. Keller's name. Although bread is not included, if you ask they will bring some pretty yummy rolls.  Should have asked for another batch...they were that good.

One interesting affectation:  while the menu is presented printed on a large sheet of paper, the wine and drink list consists of an iPad that the waiter plopped in the center of the table while we were browsing the menu.  Perhaps the restaurant feels that using an iPad for drinks looks ""cool and hip,"" or perhaps their wine and drink list change by the hour or minute, making a printed list too problematic. Either way, I would suggest that they either give us the menu and drink list in the iPad, or give them to us on paper.  But don't try to hedge your ""coolness"" bets by using both formats.

Chef Hubert Keller does it again in Las Vegas with his name sake Fleur by Hubert Keller located in the Mandalay Bay in the venue previously occupied by his renowned Fleur de Lys.  Chef Hubert Keller is known throughout the world not only as a classically trained French  Chef but an author and TV host has well. 



We had dined at Fleur de Lys in Las  Vegas several times over the years and were always impressed with the classic décor , unique chefs table, immaculate service and of course great French cuisine as only Chef Keller could create.  Fleur's concept of tapas had us wondering how this would work as we walked into Chef Keller's newest creation.  
Walking into Fleur you first notice its "" open air "" casual tables and a lively bar with plasma TVs. As we walked past the tables near the bar guided by our hostess to our table in the main dining room we gazed upward to the Chefs table overlooking the dining room surrounded by hundreds of bottles of wine which brought back fond memories of Fleur de Lys . The décor in the main dining room features earth tones of brown and beige with lighting in the shape of trees which gives guest a warm inviting feeling.
""Fleur is about globally inspired Tapas"" stated GM Owen Deignan as he met us at our table and welcomed us to Fleur.  The word ""global"" inspired us so we put ourselves in the very capable hands of   Chef Keller and his Chef de Cuisine  Steven Wolf.
Our first stop as always,  was  perusing  through the very extensive wine list. The wine list features most of the ""trophy"" wines that you would expect from a venue such as Fleur but also offered a nice variety of wines from $ 60.00 and up. We chose a nice Cote du Rhone that we expected should pair well with whatever Chef Keller and Chef Wolf sent out. 


 tuna tacos jalapeño, lime cilantro
 
  When our very attentive server brought out the AHI  Tuna Tacos , the dish was so pleasing to the eye we just wanted to stare at before we went any further.  The expression "" you eat with your eyes""   could not be more true of this dish. The pepper provided just the right heat and a nice avocado foam to cool things down made this a very balanced dish and one of our favorites of the night.

merguez sausage saffron couscous, harissa
 We waited with anticipation to see where the Chefs would take us for our next stop . A North African dish that is also popular in Northern Europe, The Merguez sausage  with saffron gave our palates at treat of some wonderful exotic flavors that Chef Keller creates better than none other.

angus sliders blue cheese, onion, bacon, pear
What would a Tapas restaurant be with out Sliders ?  Fleur does it as good as anyone with juicy Angus Sliders with creamy blue cheese , onion , crispy bacon and a nice contrast of pear.  We will come back  just to enjoy this dish once again.


crème brulée trio earl grey, orange, cookie dough  &
chocolate soufflé chocolate ganache and tobasco ice cream

After spending most of the night at Fluer dining our way around the world with Chef Keller could we have ""room""for anything else ?  Of course  ! and it was now time for the finale and what a finale it was.  A Crème Brulee  trio featuring Earl Grey , Orange and Cookie was a exquisite introduction into one of the best Chocolate Souffle's we have had.  The lightness of the Earl Grey  was the perfect lead into the Souffle at the end. These dishes were decadant, delicious and should not be missed .


Fluer has a couple great specials to indulge in as well.  For those who enjoy Classic French wines and a one of a kind burger Chef Keller  offers his FleurBurger 5000 wagyu beef, foiruffle  gras, with A bottle of 1995 Château Petrus for $ 5000.00 . 

If the Fleur Burger is a little out of your range. Chef Kellers ""in the shower"" mac & cheese lobster, brunoise vegetable is a dish that he created for Master Chefs that really shows off his creativity in layering flavors.  

Chef Keller has captured what people are looking for in these days and times. His   culinary artistry is now available and approachable for families and many others than m",WbyYvdY3MsM7GQTTyxZPbQ,2,0,4,lduGjS0chMTZ5z7x27iYZw

Third was the filet mignon. I opted to add the black truffle and foie gras with the filet for the additional fee but felt that it was totally worth it.

Dining with a large group (approx. 10) always tests the limits of good service at a restaurant and Fleur gets high marks for meeting the needs of our group.  We were all curious about the ""get everything on the menu"" option for $415 but there were too many of us that were queasy about one menu item or another.

Plates ordered included a cheese plate, skirt steak, kobe sliders, hummus, meatballs and lobster mac n cheese.  While the dishes looked good, I have to say that my unsophisticated palate just found everything to be ""ok.""  Everything was soooooooo tiny.  The sliders I could eat in just one bite.  The skirt steak at $22 gave me about four bites.  $72 later I was still starving and felt compelled to buy Oreos in the hotel gift shop (ok, I admit, that probably would have happened anyway).

We came in yesterday on Valentine's Day, and the service that we received was really disappointing. From the moment I sat down it all started.

I kept repeating my orders, I wasn't sure how the sangria came and I sensed an attitude when I asked, and after saying thank you he walked away silent. What in the world? So I asked the server if he was having a bad day because if so I would rather not eat there. He apologized and said no. But once you have received that apology it just seems that now it's not genuine service. I literally went next door to see if they had availability and they didn't. With that being said I decided to stay.  Service cleaned up but it really put a damper on a special occasion. The food is for the 2 stars, it's still really great food, but I believe food taste better once everything flows unexpectedly better then you would expect.

I challenge any restaurant from coast to coast to be as stunningly beautiful and as romantic as chefs San Francisco spot. Where he started it all. 

I wish his spot at The Mandalay Bay resort could fill those jimmy choo shoes of his but alas, I would have to reckon with reality.  Las Vegas. On this visit 8k people from a convention joined us on a Tuesday nite.  Hubert's spot was crushed as was every other dining spot in the resort. There are drunks everywhere. It's 7:30. 

We sit down and it's just weird. Not like jersey shore guido weird, but more like Orange County jocko homos rolling around. There's a lot of cleavage too. And some serious varicose veins. It's just a Vegas crowd I guess. It doesn't interfere with the food, but if you are a Fleur de Lys fan and you are expecting a modicum of that restaurant here in Vegas, look somewhere else. 

I'm not saying the decor is not nice. The room is very nice with it's elevated wine room and stone work. It's just not Fleur de Lys. I think they should change the name. Again. It's just too painful to be in a space that can trace its' lineage from such fine stock. It's like having an ugly baby from a hot chick. It's unnatural. 

The food is great. Chef Avila is doing a fine job executing this globe hopping menu.  The tripe and beef tongue stew was excellent. The onion velouté was righteously sweet and velvety. My Baccalo was delish though they could have taken the skin off. Small detail but makes a huge difference. We ordered the whole chicken for two and were satisfied with the results. Food is good.

Best bread: Rosemary focaccia (kinda odd that it all comes out so cold though, one would hope/expect it to be warm at a place like this).

Prix Fixe Menu Advice: Pick the truffled onion soup over the ahi tartare, the braised veal & yukon gold potato ravioli over the chorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass and the guinness braised beef short ribs over the prime filet mignon. Both desserts kinda sucked for us, we weren't impressed with either the chocolate plate or the carrot and cream cheese ice cream sandwich.

3 words that sum up the entire experience: Truffled. Onion. Soup. I could drink this by the freaking GALLON. So smooth, so creamy, so flavorful... the most orgasmic soup EVER. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

Total for 2: $89x2 + $8 for coffee and $8 for tea (pass on the tea) - $50 restaurant.com coupon + tip = a 27th birthday-worthy meal for under $200.

We got the global dinner for two. It had some tasty-sounding dishes that my wife couldn't eat because of a shellfish allergy (shrimp and grits!), and they generously subbed those items out for other entrees that were equally delicious.

Just about everything we had was cooked to perfection, delicious, and well presented. Our favorites were the grilled octopus, white onion soup, and ahi tacos. The only thing we had that wasn't absolutely amazing was the quinoa-stiffed peppers, but that's only because I find the texture of quinoa to be strange no matter how you make it.

To top it off, the staff was extremely welcoming and attentive throughout the night.

Partly it was because it was close, but the food really did impress. Reservations were made and I didn't even have to go out into the 110 degree weather to get there.

We were so happy with our meals that we decided to eat here again. Yum!

I ordered almost the same thing the second time around. I was delighted with the steak tartare, the prince edward island mussels with basil cream sauce, and their tuna tacos. O-M-G those tuna tacos are delicious. I wish they were full sized tacos, I would totally have made a meal out of them every day. 

The braised short ribs were delicious. We came back and had it again, and tried the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce as well. 

The service on the first day was better than the second day we came, but on our second visit, we got free dessert. I guess it all evens out. 

I'm kind of sad that the service was not spot-on for our second visit. The server was arguing with what they had on their menu, even though we had ordered it 2 days prior and was still on the menu. 

I was also sad to see that they had a coupon on restaurant.com so I could have saved money on my meal. I was very surprised to see how many great restaurants had coupons on restaurant.com for a great deal. Seriously, wtf.

We had every detail in a tasting menu that we sampled, tabled side Absinthe service, 4 members of wait-staff within arms reach at most any time. The staff was wise enough to seat a few larger party groups away from us (clearly a couple, other couples were seated near us) .

Fine details were the perfection of this place, the wall has a very interesting piece of art on it that after inspection is made of roses. Real ones, live ones, and after your dinner they pluck one and give it to your lady.

1482301,2010-07-25,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"This review of Fleur D Lys is of the lounge and the expanded Tapas menu available there, a great experience in all aspects. The menu is not listed on the website but is listed out front with the other menus, so do look for it. My wife and I ate there on 7-22-10.

 To begin the atmosphere of the Lounge is very relaxing as well as  inviting, with low as best I can describe Mid East style seating, with small tables and low set couches. The couches are very comfortable BTW so you may want to stay for awhile. This is a small intimate area which seats probably around 25 people at most so it can fill up on the weekends. Our hostess was charming, very engaging and an absolute sweetheart of a girl as were all employees we dealt with that evening, as you would expect from Fleur de Lys.

 We began our meal with a couple of drinks, a Doghead IPA for me, not bad but stout for an IPA, my wife had what is called a Fleur Fizz, a signature drink from the Lounge there. I am not much on cocktails as such, but this was a very well made and refreshing cocktail, made similiar to a New Orleans Fizz but made with Champagne instead of club soda. A great replacement IMO.

 We ordered the Charcutrie Tray for two and the Rock Shrimp with Glass Noodles, for what we thought was a beginner to the Tapas meal. Not the whole meal for two as it ended up being to our surprise. The Rock Shrimp and Glass noddles was a slightly spicy little dish, not so much my wife did not love it mind you, but with a taste of the world it was from as it should be. The sauce was a mix of Thai and Viet tastes blended very well, with very fresh, small Rock Shrimp, which were not skrimped on as some Tapas menus will do. The Charcutrie was a very nice mix of smoked meats with a very fresh bread, olives, cornichons, pickled fennel and a wonderful stone ground mustard. The highlight of this for me was the mix of the Pork/Goose pate and the Fennel, a wonderful combination with the sweet, smoothness of the pate and the sharpness of the fennel blending wonderfully to form a new tatse sensation I will try in the future for a recipe of my own.

  Unable to decide what we wanted to do for dessert, which all sounded good I asked about the 'flights"" I saw listed on the menu. Why not finish with a drink instead of more food, always can eat again if need be :) . The flights are signature martinis in a 3 drink serving, and are available as a Tropical or Decadent choice of flights. We decided upon the Decadent flight and were not wrong in our choice as this filled the needs of both libation and dessert in one nice package, The flight consisted of a Dark Chocolate, Mocha Espresso and White Chocolate, the drinks were accompanied by Chocolate Meddalions and fresh Blackberries. The White Chocolate was my personal favorite, like drinking a wonderful White Chocolate bar, with a hint of a Martini behind it. The Espresso was my wifes favorite, she best described as very good Mocha Espresso but with a hint of Gin. This was a great finish to a great meal to say the least. The meddalions and rasberries were wonderful, fresh as out the back door rasberries and excellent chocolate.

 Whether looking for a quick and casual, but classy, meal or just a great way to start the evening with a drink in a relaxed, semi-casual setting, the lounge as Fleur de Lys is a choice you cannot go wrong with. The Tapas menu is extensive and priced very well, with something for everyone, the price is upscale as you would expect for Fleur de Lys but worth every penny. They have available a choice for evrything on the Tapas, 99 for just food or 115 for foods and desserts, and a party of 8-10 could have a great time for this amount. 5 Stars all the way across the board.",Lr3sZrMEiM7uuRA5PN_5Yw,2,1,5,KKetC6GICxjQPmZM7b0RGg

The tuna tacos was meh...  the shell was cold.  We serve our shells hot, which tastes so much better.

The ambiance and decor:
First, it's great that you can always get reservations for Fleur, which is not possible for most of the other top restaurants in Vegas. I'm not sure if this is public response on the food, location or marketing, but it's something to consider. The location definitely leaves something to be desired; it's in the back of the hotel, and you end up with a view to some slots and walkways due to the open floorplan. The decor itself is very nice; supple leather, slate, glass, and some random ""edgy"" art pieces. There's also a beautiful wine cellar behind glass. The big detractor for me was the outfit the cocktail waitresses wear. I'm normally not one to argue with ladies wearing short hoochie dresses, but it's totally out of place in an otherwise classy restaurant.

Food:
For sure, the two stand out dishes are the White Onion Veloute and the Ahi Tuna Tacos. In fact, I urge everyone to just order four orders of the tacos as their meal. My friend got the Fleur Burger (despite the exorbitant price) and really liked it, but I've heard from others that it's quite dry. In general, I hear the menu is hit or miss, but you'll have to read other reviews to see if people can advise you towards some dishes.

Service:
The service is impeccable. Our waitress was very sweet, gave us time to figure out what we wanted and added in recommendations. Her wine pairings were also excellent. The service actually made the meal special, which isn't something you'd normally say in Vegas.

He also gets the Fillet Mignon with Oxtail Tortellini.  You know I was eating off of his plate - everything was excellent. Just absolutely excellent. 

I had the pan-seared halibut with shaved black truffle crust.  It was super good (but not as good as his lobster or fillet mignon).  

And here's the kicker - the chocolate souffle was absolutely awesome.  Is is probably what I was ask the jail wardens to serve me if I were to be executed tomorrow. 

The wine was excellent - and the service is top notch. This was probably one of the top dining experiences in my life.",AjAL1T3oK5kxlDoMT2yvHQ,3,3,5,UbP7lp82YiPKTV9GoVSOSw

My first impression was ""DAMN! $20 FOR SOUP!?"" 

So of course, I had to try to the soup. And boy, it was the best truffle onion soup I've ever had. Delicate, yet loaded with flavor, rich and creamy... OMG. I will dream of this soup! Now THAT was worth $20.

I also tried the lobster salad... yummy but not as stand out as the soup. The lobster was butter poached, served with mango slices and a frisee salad. 

For my entree, I went with the Roast Chicken. Generally, I don't really like chicken because it's hard to do right. This chicken... this chicken... THIS CHICKEN was incredibly delicious. Seared skin, succulent, moist meat, flavorful... wholy crap, I ate the entire thing in about 5 minutes. Ha, there's $40 bucks down my throat hole!!

Oh yeah, and order the Chocolate Souffle for dessert. It was light, and airy but huge! It can easily be shared between 2-4 people!

All in all, wonderful service and delicious food. Good job Fleur de Lys!",KnEqiLMm1poJTmdTv99RpA,2,2,5,hHmlfzBjH1pFhLkCThbIcA

As lovers of tasting menus, we decided to go with the full tasting menu that came with 7 courses. We started off with a dungeness crab wrapped in slices of avocado served with a watermelon gazpacho. This was fantastic. The avocado was the perfect compliment for the crab and the watermelon gazpacho offered a light contrast to the savory avocado. The next dish was a tuna tartare served with a ginger ponzu sauce. This had to be the best tuna tartare I have ever had...hands down. The ponzu sauce was spruced up with a hint of ginger and the tuna was perfectly balanced with cucumber strings. The following dish was the Nantucket Bay scallops served with frisee and a tomato confit. The scallops were so moist and flavorful. Generally, my compliant with scallops are that they are too big and lack the sweet, buttery flavor. These scallops had that wonderful flavor and a lot more. The tomato confit was very unique - the tomatoes were skinned and cooked, while maintaining it's shape and was the perfect consistency. The truffled onion soup was served with duck braised ragout and black truffles. I loved the duck braised ragout, but the soup was a little too creamy for my liking. My boyfriend loved it so it may just be a personal preference. I was more interested in the next dish, the veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli. Wow - this was so wonderful. This dish came with sunchokes and English peas. I loved the consistency of the ravioli, and the veal sauce was mouth watering. The last of the savory dishes as a venison served with huckleberries, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, a potato puree served on a bed of red cabbage. The venison was perfectly cooked - the meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The red cabbage was slightly crunchy and worked perfectly with the meat. I was in heaven. 

For desserts, we had the coconut soup with tapioca, passion fruit sorbet served on a square of banana bread. We also had the chocolate souffle, and poached pears with cinnamon ice cream. The desserts were okay - I feel like I have had better (hence the 4 stars). Overall the service was okay as well. My last comment is that I loved the decor of the restaurant. The vaulted ceilings had drapes going from floor to ceiling which gave the restaurant a very dramatic effect. The huge display of roses at the entrance of the restaurant was breathtaking.",Cn2mmB9wAPiB0COnYpWpIg,2,1,4,_WqsWMrmn7IXTQj5DsIl1g

1618913,2011-02-13,4,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Time to update.  If you read my original review, you will see that I was in love with Fleur de Lys.  Not only for the happy hour, my last visit involved the tasting menu with wine pairings in a private cabana which left me raving until they closed.  And then I cried.  Well not really but I was real sad.  You see, Fleur de Lys was like a sanctuary.  A quiet place with great food and bevs where we could escape.

So you can imagine how excited I was that they were reopening.  I knew they were reconcepting, but I wanted to give it a go anyway.  Last night was my first night in town so I made a reservation and went by asap.  

Well let me tell you.  I'm not that much of a fan.  The menu is a little bit of everything with small plates mostly in the $11 - $15 range but sprinkled with your token ridiculously expensive items.  Like the one for $5000.  Not joking.  There's a $5000 burger on the menu and, oh yeah, it comes with champagne.  I decided it should come with a hooker as well...or some fancy imported dijon hooker, or maybe two hookers.  Or maybe ""burger"" is code word for crack or something.  But we determined that it would have to be about 8 lbs of crack...plus the dijon hookers.

Anyhow, the decisions were difficult, as there was nothing all that interesting there.  Online it looked like they had a few prix fixe options but the only ones last night were ""eat the menu"" for like $485 and the couples Valentine menu.  I asked our server for recommendations and he said that the ravioli, skirt steak and the duck were the most interesting dishes.  Really?  Yeah.  I ordered the peking duck, the scallop goulash...and the veal ravioli when I was done with those because I was still starving.  The ""peking"" duck was really just a few small pieces of roast duck and the horseradish in the goulash was nonexistent.  The veal ravioli was pretty good, though.

I will say that Chef Keller was actually around last night and was very gracious, taking time to greet people and take photos with them.  Nice.

So anyway.  I'm sad again.  It seems like they've pretty much dumbed the place down to appeal to the masses.  The food is alright, but I felt like it was much better before and basically at the same price point.  They do have some cute presentations but a girl's gotta eat!  Three bites is not going to do it.",j_xdpXxPdSVhlwTJ7roKag,1,0,3,o_npWxt0a_aklHOE5CTKFg

And wow, we made the right choice. We decided to go with their prix fixe menu and order different plates, that way we could all get a little taste of every dish. There were a couple dishes that absolutely wowed me. First, they started us off with a delectable amuse-bouche. It was the right way to start off the meal because from that very first bite, I can tell that this will be one of the best meals I'll ever have. To start off, I ordered their onion soup, which was amazing. Best soup I've ever had. It was creamy and yet light enough so that it won't weigh you down for the rest of your meal. Their filet mignon was so tender that they didn't bother giving me an actual steak knife to cut through it. Hahaha, they gave me an un-serrated butter knife. At first I was like ""WTF, how do they expect me to cut into my meat with this thing?"" Well, let me tell you, I was able to slice through that chunk of meat with minimal effort. =P Oh, and yes, it was just as deliciously flavorful as it was tender. I opted to pay the extra money to get the creme brulee for dessert. I remember it cracking ever so nicely when I first dug my spoon into the creamy goodness.

1644419,2013-06-14,3,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I got a comp for a 5-course dinner experience for two with a personalized menu at Fleur, so I was SUPER excited to come here on our most recent Vegas trip.

However, for such an extravagant dinner, I left with a couple disappointments:

Disappointment #1:
By ""personalized menu"", all it really means is that the chef comes to your table before you order and asks if you have any food allergies or distastes.  I said that I didn't like exotic meats such as lamb or deer, and the chef said it wasn't a problem since they don't have those meats in the kitchen anyway.  As a fine dining restaurant, I'd expect them to have a fancier selection.

Disappointment #2: 
Because you don't really get to choose your food, I ended up getting items that I probably wouldn't have ordered normally...aka foods that didn't tickle my fancy.  This included bland, boiled kale and veggies in a liquid soup which got soggy after sitting a while, a HUGE bowl of weird mushrooms that had a funny smell and taste, and a salad with an almost poached, almost raw egg on it.  I probably only ate a few pieces of each, and felt bad wasting the rest :(.  Also, because I didn't know what was coming out next, my stomach wasn't prepared.  I was pretty much full after course #3.

My meal:

Course 0.5: Raw oyster in a ponzu sauce under a bed of dry ice
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q
Refreshing, delicious, and extra presentation points for keeping it on the dry ice!

Course 1: Potato soup, Asian slaw, crab cake
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#qcCyMQR7R2nrb58NFsljeg
Probably my favorite course.  The potato soup was SO rich and creamy and was made with a touch of truffle oil.  The slaw wasn't anything special, but a good refreshing counter to its adjacent rich foods.  The crab cake was also awesome: crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside, with tons of REAL crab meat.  I could have had another couple plates of just the soup and crab cake for the meal and would be so happy!

Course 2: Spinach salad with poached(?) egg
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#3kO-o6Wh-VqFsD27b-Fcsw
The spinach and its dressing was actually very good with a light, sweet, creamy dressing that didn't overpower the hearty greens.  However, I absolutely despise runny egg yolks, so I had to make sure I didn't pop the egg while eating my greens.  When I was almost done with the salad, it broke on its own and I was done with the dish right then.

Course 3: Surf and turf: salmon and steak
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#w9BBWD7c8mABIw_fKFQE0A
Predictable flavors, but still good.  Both the salmon and the steak were very tender and moist.  My only complaint here was there was no starch to pair it with!  I ended up ordering a loaf of bread, since they apparently don't sell rice.

Course 4: Braised beef with espresso foam, side mushrooms and boiled kale/veggies
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#HBd3RqXWlXF4ipHeEmbJ4w

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#oNaHfByaNlevg5X0ANoRWA
This was the ""weird mushrooms"" and ""bland boiled kale/veggies"" that I mentioned above.  I was pretty much full after course #3, so I couldn't really enjoy this dish to its fullest, but the braised beef was one of my favorite things of the night!  Sooo tender, flavorful, and the espresso foam gave it that extra somethin' somethin'!  It sat on a bed of mashed potatoes (FINALLY!!!! STARCH!!!!).  Even though I was full, I ate most of the beef and potatoes...

Course 5: Chocolate cream puffs and pineapple/cream parfait
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fleur-by-hubert-keller-las-vegas-2?select=4HutLYpRMjzohTNZoi9M2Q#WCpWBn9nyeCThEWB34B9Hw

So by now, I was over and beyond STUFFED.  Not really much of a dessert person, I let myself relish one chocolate cream puff, which was actually pretty good.  The chocolate was rich and decadent, poured over the puff dough, and between the two puff halves was vanilla bean gelato!  Yum!

I must admit, it was a very tasty meal.  Some items were not ones I would order again, but that's how it is with a surprise menu I suppose.  I think I enjoyed the meal a lot more because I got it for free, but I don't think I would pay the actual value to eat here again.",KQu94abI3DgXRwWelF_x2w,11,8,3,rXGhXp5_NTD0MvsNPLRdkQ

The remarkable seared foie gras has been replaced with a thin shitake sized portion on top of bread in a butter squash soup.   As an added crowd pleaser, they charge for bread and butter.

All the waitress kept pushing was ordering many plates to share. It almost became annoying. My husband had the cold meat platter that was very good, but my Angus beef sliders were burnt to a crisp (I had ordered them well-done, but they were so small any type of cooking would have charred them). A warning from the waitress when I ordered them would have been appreciated. I would have sent them back but the waitress never returned to check on how our meals were.

1659576,2014-12-27,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"You made our Christmas dinner amazing!

We booked on OpenTable.com for our reservation after narrowing down Restaurants that are wallet and taste bud friendly.

The Restaurant:
+ Lit with a dim but even lighting (so I can see what I was eating), the room had a wide open classy feel to it even though some tables were quite close. 
+ Seating was either provided by plush chairs or bar like chairs at a higher table. My only complaint is with the tall chairs. You can't scoot forward. So once you pull it out to sit and find that you are a bit away from the table, it becomes very hard to scoot a metal chair with your weight across a plush carpet. So leaning awkwardly forward was not my thing...
+Decor was high end and minimal at the same time. but not too much where you are afraid to scratch the table.
+ Music, not too loud and not too soft to hear everyone's conversations. We could not hear the casino area just outside the entrance.

The Food:
+ We started with the: White Onion Soup Veloute: A creamy calm soup. Not too intense on the onion flavor but with a hint of Truffle oil with a breath taking aroma. (This was out favorite and ordered it to split between me and Significant Other).
+Next: Gyros; not listed on the menu link. Made with thick lamb and vinaigrette lettuce/olive mixture. (The lamb was cooked to perfection, not too dry or moist, and seasoned lighly without overpowering the meat).
+Black Angus Sliders: Sadly there were only three. we had to split one and wish we had more. 
+Lastly we ordered the chocolate souffle. This was our first so we can't act like experts and critique it absurdly. However we loved every bit and scrambled to grab the last bite. Served with Oreo Ice Cream to ease your tongue from too much warm souffle.

I do have a food allergy and appreciated it very much when the waitress was able to recall off the top of her head if a dish contained nuts or not.",zJzlHdnpF_nvydNOKFJ9bA,2,2,5,rQXt_p2bb2WHeTH5kQsSgw
1673535,2009-11-11,5,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"From start to finish, this was the best meal of my life.

First off, I love any restaurant that uses OpenTable. When I realized it would take me much longer than expected to check-in to my hotel, I grabbed my phone and went online to change the time of my reservation. There was no need to try to speak to someone and try to yell over the sounds of annoying hotel guests and slot machines, three clicks and it was done.

Upon arrival and quick seating, we opted for the $89 four course Elegance Menu. I won't bore you with a play-by-play of the courses, mostly because I hate reading reviews that are written in that style. Suffice it to say that each course could fend for itself as a stand alone dish. As the meal progressed, the flavor profiles became more complex but played off of each other in a graceful manner. 

The course that really blew my socks off was the prime filet mignon that was served over baby spinach, wild mushrooms, salsify, and a red wine reduction. As if I had to tell you, the filet was accompanied by a creamy and buttery potato puree. It's been days since I've dined here, but I just can't stop thinking about this dish. There was nothing groundbreaking about this play on the classic meat-n-potatoes dish, it was simply executed to total perfection.

To top it all off, the service and general ambiance was top-notch. Word to the wise though, you might want to think twice about being seated in any close proximity to the entrance of the restaurant if there is a country music performance going down at the nearby sushi restaurant because the PBR rodeo tour is in town.",vWriq6V_PAjruqii-iy1nA,6,5,5,NYXxKsrsX1CywGWaUPz4HA

It used to be called Fleur De Lys back when it opened apparently, but I think they still kept the same menu.

What we ordered: Seared Hudson Valley Foie  Gras, the Madrid Style Tripe and Tongue Stew and the Fleur Burger with the Foie Gras. 

I was basically in Foie Gras heaven. Every bite was beautiful. lol. I haven't had foie gras in so long that every time I get the chance to travel outside CA i need to have it. Besides paying $70 for the burger which is probably the most expensive burger I have had, having the foie gras was well worth it.

1688044,2012-02-19,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I went to this place mainly due to the lovely combo of a restaurant.com certificate and  staying at the Mandalay Bay (hooray for cheapness and laziness). At first blush, the menu seemed a little limited, but all I wanted was a steak and beer, so it fit my needs. The decor was nice, but I'm one of those folk who really doesn't care about decor...focus should be on the food...but I digress. I ate at the bar mid-afternoon, since I was travelling solo, and had a pleasant conversation with the bartender. All in all, a decent if not overly impressive experience.

The reason why I give it 5 stars is the service from the management. In the middle of a convo with the bartender, the manager came by with a free appetizer of the onion soup shooter and apologized for the wait for the steak. Apparantly it was cooked well beyond my instructions and he intercepted it before it was served. Honestly, I hadn't noticed the delay in service, but I very much appreciated the offer. That was pretty impressive to me, just a regular schlub in a t-shirt and jeans eating solo at the bar. Maybe my expectations for dining are a bit low, but that was above and beyond to me. The onion soup shooter I ended up liking more than the steak! Not that the steak was bad, but the onion soup app was that much better in my opinion.

Overall, excellent food, great and pleasant service, and an overall easygoing atmosphere. The prices are a little high, but nothing out of the ordinary for the Vegas strip. Definitely will recommend to other folk and will likely visit again.",wbKbMUBmetPs-tpJAtAUkw,1,1,5,fJQtPFlgyJ20jH-YewXKmw

1709282,2012-06-02,14,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"***Mandalay Bay's Fleur is a good option for an upscale lunch in Las Vegas***

Fleur used to be Fleur de Lys, a more traditional fine dining restaurant (based on the original SF location), but Hubert Keller converted it into Fleur, a modern tapas spot (probably to better align with the diverse crowd that Vegas attracts).

I tried Fleur a few years ago and for the most part the food was good (with some just okay dishes here and there).  Despite the quality of the food, the portions were incredibly dainty making Fleur feel quite overpriced.

For lunch, Fleur works better though (at least in terms of value).  There is a mix of small plates so you can get a small taste of what Fleur cooks up at dinner.  There are also more substantial lunch plates--sandwiches and salads but also entrees like steak frites and salmon.

I started with the burrata salad--something I would expect to see on the dinner menu and it was actually a substantial starter.  There was a generous portion of burrata, which was very creamy.  The burrata sat on some good, juicy and sweet heirloom tomatoes.  The burrata was topped with tomato pearls.

There was also olive oil powder and basil powder.  The basil powder had a stronger flavor, but the olive oil powder had a more memorable texture as it turned to almost cream upon tasting it.

Everything was garnished with a really good balsamic--a very deep and rich flavor.  There was also a side of bread, which was just okay--they probably should have toasted it.

For my entree, I went with the steak frites, which included a very generous portion of hanger steak.  There were two pieces of steak.  One was cooked very nicely.  It was incredibly tender and also quite juicy.  The even cooking of the steak (maybe it was sous vide) was very impressive.  There was also a good outside sear.

The other piece of steak was not as good (maybe the unevenness of temperature had to with how the pieces were quite different in size).  The steak was okay, but it was not as tender and a little dry in parts.

The steak had a good flavor; I still would have preferred more seasoning because the sauce was too light in flavor to add much.  With steak frites, I like a richer bordelaise like the one at Lucques (Los Angeles).

The herb garlic frites were nice and crisp.  The frites were a little uneven in seasoning as some frites had more of a garlic flavor, which was nice.

They had several desserts, but I didn't think much sounded exciting.  I ended up opting for the almond panna cotta.  The panna cotta was topped with strawberry citrus soup and then garnished with blackberries, streusel, and kalamansi blackberry sorbet.  The panna cotta had a great consistency.  It was creamy, smooth and light.

There was not much of an almond flavor while there was an overabundance of strawberry citrus soup.  The strawberry soup kind of overpowered the panna cotta.

I liked the streusel, which was buttery and crisp.  The kalamansi blackberry sorbet was also good--not icy and very cool and refreshing.

Service was very good.  My server was personable and polite.  He was also very attentive and intuitive even though he had to service many tables.  The hostess was nice too (and attractive if that is important to you).

As mentioned, prices are not too bad.  Almost everything was priced under $20 and portions were more than generous on a few plates.

For lunch, only the cafe is open.  While the decor is nice and contemporary, it is close to the casino so you have to deal with casino noise; the cigarette smoke also wafts over a little bit, which is unfortunate.

For dinner, the main dining room is much nicer.  The room is very contemporary, but it is also very warm (great use of warm colors) and inviting.  It is also farther back in the restaurant, which makes it feel like a nice and relaxing retreat from Vegas.

The food at Fleur is good for both lunch and dinner, but lunch is much more affordable.  There are not many notable upscale places open for lunch in Vegas so it is nice to have an option like Fleur available.

Fleur is located in Mandalay Bay and like many casinos, Mandalay Bay has its own free parking structure.  The structure leads right to Fleur's entrance.",w-w-k-QXosIKQ8HQVwU6IQ,19,19,4,FPkYbXvX9iP6UX26DHwRTw

Fast forward to the recession, Fleur de Lys wanted to be a little more approachable in a down economy so the concept changed to Fleur. Small plates, some big plates and it was still good. I think they had too many choices, was often overwhelmed by the menu, but there were some really good dishes among some misses.  

At some point in the last year, the menu changed again. With less items to choose from, almost half the menu is now Asian. Which would be ok, but if I wanted any type of Asian food in Las Vegas I wouldn't have to go far. 

""Small Plates"" here is a misnomer, maybe if I was an NFL linebacker they'd be considered small. They say 2-3 per person, but I think it's safer to do 1-2 and keep a menu if you want more later. Out of everything here the only must have is the ahi tacos. 

Most of what we ordered was heavy, it wasn't bad just ok, but after we split two of the dishes I didn't want anything else except a fresh salad to balance it out. Even the beet salad was heavy and oily. There was more cheese than beets, and they were covered in oil. To the restaurant's credit, the waitress said it was the winter menu and they'll lighten it up. But, it's winter in Vegas, not Chicago, don't really have as much of the comfort food craving to keep warm end of March when people are spending the day at the pool. 

Not sure if they're suffering from a loss of identity, but every time we walked by they weren't very busy and between spring break and March Madness, everywhere else seemed to be.",uazzD416Uu2-cJTKVoEiyQ,2,0,3,73lWShAb6u546Z9qtxlsLg

I ended up getting a spoonful of steamed spinach, along with a couple sticks of steamed carrots as my entree.  The head waiter came and asked me if everything was okay.  My guess is that one of the other waiters overheard me saying 'looks like I'm going to have to swing by Taco Bell on the way home.' When I mentioned that the entree was rather 'light' (it was literally a few garden vegetables that were steamed), he offered to see if there was anything else they could do.  He ended up bringing out some potato puree to supplement the very basic dish that was originally brought out. 

In all fairness, they did have an expensive prix fixe menu option for vegetarians.  However, this ended up costing almost twice as much as the smaller meat prix fixe (Lion King) option. Unfortunately they would not substitute a vegetarian entree in their lion king menu.

Here's some deats:

Skirt steak w/chimichurri sauce: The meat was delish but I found the chimichurri sauce just a little overpowering. I would still recommend it for meat loving peeps.

lobster mac n cheese: cheesy and delish...with a hint of lobster that is just right.

fried chick peas: my friend really liked them...I thought they were only ok.
kind of dry and really no reason to get these out at a place like this in my opinion.

tuna tacos- adorable presentation and SO yummy. I could eat about 3 orders myself! Yikes. Maybe that's not a good thing?

gnocchi- really delicious, light and yummy...

DESSERT: 
coconut tapioca with freeze dried fruit... as long as you are into tapioca, this is super yummy and different. I loved the texture of the freeze dried fruit and the passion fruit that was added.

pannecotta? Fresh, delicious, creamy, tart, sweet, amazing!

My pinot noir wine: delicious full bodied wine but it was pretty steep at $11. :(

AMBIANCE:
It's a cool little bar to meet people at and get a drink; they have a happy hour that I think went till 6:30pm, which is cool when you are there for a tradeshow.

The food came out very quickly, but it was gone very quickly. Eight girls sharing 8 tiny plates does not last very long!  And at $12-$16 each plate, we realized this was not the best choice for us.  Another ""clue"" was when one of the girls asked for bread the waitresse said that they do not serve bread (no problem), but that some of the appetizers we ordered come with bread.  She then informed us that the sliders that we ordered have bread with them.  This comment was ridiculous, but made for some great laughs later in the evening!!

I have been to tapas style places before.  I know to expect smaller portions that are meant to be shared.  But, these portions were SO small.  They tasted great, but didn't do a great job of filling us up.  There were 8 of us, so perhaps our group was just too big so if everyone wanted to try something, they just got a bite, maybe two if they were lucky.

Service was excellent and attentive. There's a bit of the overindulgent goofiness that strikes me at any fancy restaurant, but to their credit the descriptions of each dish were succinct and useful (not the litany you sometimes get, where a waiter is explaining to you the name of the farmer's cousin who picked the radicchio).

Something else I noticed is that you can have a sublime meal here for a variety of price points. One of my dinner companions had the three-course Lion King prix fixe, at $45 or $55; I had the four-course at $89; and two others had the four-course with wine pairings for about $150.

So about a half hour permits me to try a quick bite to eat and get a nice glass of champagne to do with it (no wonder I'm still drunk).  Fleur is open, and the lounge/bar setting is far more than I need.  Quite frankly all Michelin star chefs should offer meals in lounge/bar settings.  

I only try and can comment on two items; the diver scallops and kushi oysters.  Yes, the scallops are seared perfectly, except one which looks like it was cut for a temperature test, and give me that wonderful ocean fishy taste attributable to the bonito sauce.  The oysters are ridiculous.  The freshest kusshi placed underneath a great lemon/orange sorbet/ice mixture that gives such a different perspective, it's ridiculous.

They did not offer to take the plates off of our bill and didn't apologize.  They offered another plate on the menu but it was unclear if they would bill us for it and at that point - I was so disenchanted and didn't want to eat any more.

The polenta was nice, buttery and creamy. Food was pricey but the food and portion sizes were good so it was worth it.

Fleur de Lys is beautiful and romantic, the service is excellent, and the food is amazing. I recommend going with a testing menu. I went with a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Please PLEASE get the wine pairing with your meal. The wines and champagnes were excellent !

I started with some fresh raw kumamoto oysters. They kicked ass and were so fresh. The sauces were also excellent. My boyfriend had the lobster salad and I know he loved it because he ate really slowly to try to savor each bite. This is not at all like him, he's a super fast eater and normally would have polished that salad off in 30 seconds or less. For the second course I had the lobster and my boyfriend had the diver scallops. Both were excellent. For the 3rd course I had the duck breast and my boyfriend had the fillet. The final course was dessert. I had the pistacio souffle and my boyfriend had the chocolate souffle. This was the only strange part of our meal. Every course was small but super flavorful and rich. The desserts were HUGE. The souffles were seriously more food than the previous 3 courses put together. I'm having a hard time complaining that the dessert was too large, but it really was in comparison to the other courses. 

This meal was seriously in my top 3 EVER. If you are in Las Vegas celebrating something, or ready to splurge do not miss Fleur de Lys.",H3ZQ7fMOhZPOqgrYERKjww,1,1,5,rEvymaXyDwZcQC9QqV7lKg

China: Gorgeous painted flowers on white ceramic
Decor: 3500 Ecuadorian roses formed in the shape of a leaf
Food: Boring, a bit salty at points & cash.  $120/pp + $80/pp wine pairing.

- Ahi tartare, all I could taste was salt, which overpowered the fish.
- Celery soup, overly creamy, I sucked up the caviar floating atop & pushed it aside.
- Steak tartare, the brioche was nicely toasted & buttered, another piece would have been perfect.  I enjoyed the swirls of yolk on the plate.
- Salmon, nice and rare, very simple in flavor, the bf complained of the blandness, the ingredients were pedestrian & similar to a chain restaurant.
- Braised ribs w/micro greens and a side of applewood smoked bacon polenta.  Hearty, earthy and the BEST of the savory dishes.  
- Cheese course: goat, sheep, cow & blue, w/drunken grapes, fresh jam, dried fruit & nuts.  Came with sliced bread, the bread was a bit chewy.  I need CRUSTINESS.  The best combo was the goat w/jam and drunken grapes.  
- Basil sorbet with a medley of 'sauteed' fruits.  Delicious and innovative.
- Chocolate tasting.  Chocolate tart, pot de creme, sorbet, cake, & layered coconut.  The tart & pot de creme were fabulous.  I was not too keen on the other three.
-Fresh madellines with chocolate sauce.  Wow.  Crunchy edges.
-Petite four platter, one in five were edible: the chocolate cake bite.

My friend works marketing for UFC and offered us some choice seats. We arrived at the beginning during the minor fights, so we decided to have a few cocktails and a small meal. I chose Fleur because I saw they had a decent happy hour menu and lots of bar seating. 

Once we checked in, I asked the hostess if bar seating was available and she said yes. Mind you the bar was literally 2 yards away from them. Once we turned we saw there were absolutely no seats--let alone standing room. 

We wandered back to them and the hostess turned her back to go attend something instead of asking what was wrong or what we needed. We finally were sat after waiting an additional 10 minutes to be sat at one of the 10 tables that were available in the patio area. 

15 minutes later who we thought was our waiter was zooming pass us. An additional 15 minutes later---no waitress, but a nice busboy took our drink orders. 20 minutes later no drinks or waitress. I finally caved and called for the manager who apologized and used the excuse, ""She is serving Absinthe right now"". I rationalized that she did not start serving said Absinthe until 30 minutes after we were seated. The couple behind us had not been attended to as well. 

The waitress finally came over and gave us our drinks without saying her name or greeting us. My dirty martini was watered down. Clearly it had been left on the counter as the little ice flecks had completely melted. Again, no waitress in sight to ask for a fresh one. Eventually called the manager over because it was getting ridiculous and we hadn't even seen our food yet. He tried to reason that the martini was not watered down. After examining the glass he saw the amount of condensation was identical to that of a ""dead"" drink. My replacement was much better.

Now to the food...We ordered the oysters and tacos. The actual food from the appetizers combined was the size of 1 smart phone. The worst part is that the taco tasted like shelf bought tacos, while the oysters were tasteless.

The manager asked how everything was and we were upfront, but polite about the fact that it was far below par. He half apologized and gave us this annoyed look. I was so disappointed in this restaurant. Among my worst 10 dining experiences. That is saying something because one of the things on the list was going to Bertrands and finding GLASS in my drink.",WJtYhMtC279hbQz5rOznug,4,0,2,XnXkk9KCc6kL_A1ZqFM3mQ

AGH!! SO YUMS!

The hostesses were very delightful. I had my reservation set at 6:45pm but my BFF and I were running super late-- especially because we were all the way at Las Vegas Convention Center and we had to monorail it al the way from there to MGM and then TRAM from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay. Oh, the trouble we go through to get to this yummy restaurant on our little, tiny transportation budget, but soooo worth it and so worth my aching feet! They seated us as soon as we got there and didn't mind our late-coming because we called in ahead, just trying to be courteous :)

Servers were all wonderful and so handsome ;)
We did not get any such snobby service after presenting our $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com, which I was scared of. They were all still so wonderful. The impeccable service and the delicious food will have me coming back for more! I will be coming back actually, I purposely bought 2 GC for this place ;). 

1. Bread and Butter
-Bread was still cold, butter wasn't as spreadable but it's fine.. I'm not a bread person anyway.
2. Amuse Bouche
-Same as last time, Tempura Cod & Potato Salad yumsss :)
3. Truffled Onion Soup
-ALL FOR MYSELF MWAHAHAHHAHAH MMMMMMMMM Taste like heaven
4. Chorizo wrapped Suzuki Sea Bass
- The chorizo wrapper was kind of tough and salty, the fish was cooked nicely but wasn't as soft as I hoped but this was still very big and meaty. Delicious
5. BFF had the Braised Veal and Yukon Potato Ravioli
-Had a bite and I thought it was delicious!! Very comforting! I will order next time!
6. Braised Beef Short Ribs
-Soooo tender and sooo flavorful
7. Prime Filet Mignon
- BFF ordered this because I recommended it. I could tell from the look on her face that this was probably the best dish she's ever had in her life, just like how this was THE best filet mignon I've ever had in life.. .... my BFF loves me ;)
8. Passionfruit Sorbet with Tapioca in Coconut Soup with Freeze Dried berries
-Compliments by the chef!! YES, NICE!! This was sooo yummy. Passionfruit Sorbet was SOOOOO TART! It hurt my almost gone canker sore because it was so sour (and I had forgotten I had one until I tasted this), but with the coconut tapioca it was so good.
9. Carrot Cake & Cream Cheese Ice Cream with Pineapple Ice Cream/ Chocolate Souffle with Mocha Ice Cream
- Just as good as last time
10. Petit Fours
- We were too stuffed to try this so this was packed to-go. We tried it the next day and they were still so delicious!!!! Very soft and the flavor was just a hit! The selection of the Petit Fours this time around was so much better than last time because everything still tasted so fresh! Marshmallow just melted in my mouth, the jelly was SOFT (usually I don't like jellies bc it's too chewy) SOO SOO SOFT!

This was all from the Elegance Menu ($89/person)
All together including the $50GC and 18% Gratuity = $182 bucks. 

Definitely coming back.

The wait staff was also fun.

Then they went above and beyond and let us take a peek at the kitchen. I was impressed, especially by the sous-vide bath. I always wondered what the fuss was over sous-vide cooking, but believe the hype. Sous-vide results in tender meat.

Besides that, they couldn't squeeze us in for a 6pm reservation but when we got there for our 6:45 reservation, the place was half empty. I get the ""fake it til you make it"" model, but we had a show to get to, so it was irritating.

Thank god the food was worth it. The Yukon Gold & Veal raviolis were fantastic as were the Onion Soup shots and the BBQ smoked ribs. Thanks Yelper for the recommendations on those!

Chicken wings were good but not great and the sliders were practically raw that even my very carnivorous boyfriend ate around the edges.

Good news, if you're a fan of the Sazerac, they serve it with legit Absinthe. Boyfriend thought it was a little weak, but supposedly it's the bartenders favorite drink to make.

I'd definitely come back, just with a few different selections and more time to eat.

OK, it's a bit pricy for a small plates joint but really, the food is very good.

Food comes out quickly and is very tasty but, as mentioned in another review, isn't all that large.  I think the price/value perception would be better if they added a bit more food on the plate.  There were two of us at the table and one of the dishes order was the tuna tacos.  They're small, no doubt but what really bugs me is that 3 sub-mini tacos were served.  3 would be good for a single diner, what if there's 4 people at the table, someone looses and if there's 2 people, well try cutting a micro hard shell taco.

I love this place. It's beautiful. The bartenders are some of the most welcoming on the strip. Also: easy on the eyes. But, truthfully, they're down-to-earth, love to talk and find out about you, which can be disconcerting if you have had bar experiences elsewhere on the strip. They carry my favorite Belgian beer and it's a really comfortable place to hang out and have a drink.

The last time I was there (unlike the times before, when I sat at the bar), I sat in the seating area looking out to the entry to the casino. The set up is so comfortable, it's made for socializing, definitely. The chairs were comfy and the table was just the right size. I normally don't note things like this unless they really stick out. This did here. 

I ordered oysters and seared foie gras and service was quick and the food was high quality. I was very, very impressed. They serve tapas so you get a little bit of this and that in perfect amounts. I wish I had tried the whole menu. 

I wish I could hang out here every day because it is that inviting. The food is mouthwatering and they serve especially high end beer/liquor. I like that in a restaurant. It's what keeps me coming back anyway.

There is a restaurant associated with this, but I've only sat in the bar/lounge area so that's all I can report on, but I'm fairly sure there isn't much variation on taste and service.

Thanks to Restaurant.com, I had a $25 gift certificate for here. So I figured that was my excuse to finally try Fleur, which had been on my list ""want to eats"" for awhile. We sat at the bar, shared a cocktail and two of the small plates.

The cocktail we ordered ($15) was a Georgia Moon. Tasty, but too sweet and thick. And it was definitely on the small side. Not worth $15. 3 stars.

For the two small plates, we ordered the french onion soup shooter ($7) and lobster mac 'n' cheese ($18). The amount of truffle oil in the shooter glass was overwhelming. And the soup tasted very little like french onion. While a cool concept, the actual taste was a let down. 1 star. The mac 'n' cheese was bleh. The actual lobster pieces were chunky and great - better than most every other lobster I've had in a lobster mac 'n' cheese. However, the mac and the cheese were so bland and undesirable. Despite being hungry, I opted to leave half the dish uneaten. 1.5 stars.

I so wanted to love this place. But alas, the food just didn't deliver. Many options sounded tasty. So maybe there are some good menu items here and we just chose poorly?

- Ahi Tuna Tacos -  imagine paying $13 for three taco-shaped tortilla chips with a little chunk of flavorless tuna and a sprinkle of cole slaw in each chip. Yes, these were tacos portioned for a pescetarian rabbit. Gone in two small bites, or maybe three if you practice some restraint. The lack in flavor and seasoning was disappointing. It basically was just sashimi on some tortilla chips.

- Foie Gras Duo - It was ok. I preferred the seared preparation over the torchon. The red wine ice cream was interesting in a good way. Again, tiny portions.

This was probably the most cellars inside a restaurant that I have seen at the time.  The main dining room has 30-foot ceilings with stone covered walls and embossed wood ceilings.  This was going to be a long and memorable birthday dining experience.  

I ordered the Roasted Organic Beets: fresh goat cheese, poached quail egg, house cured duck from the appetizers.  

And the Pan Seared Duck Breast: duck confit, chestnut puree, cippolini onion, ginger gastrque. At this point, I didn't know half of what I was ordering and my foodie friend didn't really know either.  And the full menu didn't have any prices on any of the items we were ordering, but we knew to expect somewhere around $80-100 per person.   

So apparently my dinner was going to be four courses.  Our other friend who was not really a foodie smugly ordered an 18 OZ Bone in Prime Rib Eye Steak: Creamed Spinach, Marble Potatoes, Red Wine and Shallot Reduction.  

My fine dining foodie friend had decided to order the same items as myself.  The Fleur also offers a ""prix fixe"" menu for a reasonable $55, but only offers a choice of two appetizers and two main courses, and a dessert.  You also have the choice of trying Chef Keller's signature tasting menu ($140) and wine pairing ($80).  

All I can really say about the food served was that it seemed barely warm and ridiculously small.  Most of the food served here is tiny and doesn't have the richness or depth to constitute any major delicious flavors.  My foodie friend was actually disappointed enough about the main course that he had the audacity to tell the server that we food was not up to par.  I could have easily given the food itself 3 stars, not the epic 5 star 200th review I was looking to have.  

And it was at that point that I did realize I may have been better off ordering from the Kobe Beef & Prime steaks menu. Fine dining can be quite the double-edged sword for that fact that you are spending so much money on so little food that is showcasing mainly culinary skill and technique.  But what it all really boils down to is pretentious food and overzealous expectation.  Even if the food tastes great, that moment only lasts for a few seconds on each bite.  The food here is so miniscule that you could eat one plate in 4-5 bites.  

However at the end of our dinner the sommelier came out and poured us some complimentary dessert wine which was pleasing surprise.  He had wished all of us happy birthday and told us to enjoy the rest of our stay in Vegas.  The dinner lasted at least two and a half hours, and we had left looking forward to an even more memorable night on the town.",gUhL_vkTY_zwrzT71a73Bw,0,0,4,rL7fOIbqo9Wt93yz6_eS7w

2058913,2010-01-16,3,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"After spending three days in vegas eating mainly fast food, I decided to treat myself to a lovely meal at Fleur de Lys - it was wonderful!

Fleur de Lys is located in Mandalay Bay.  Since it was a last minute decision, my friend & I did not have reservations and the restaurant was booked for the evening.  There is an open lounge/bar area though with some small seats inside and tables outside the restaurant.  We were able to sit at a table outside the restaurant and our server informed us that we could order off of the regular menu but also off of the tapas menu, which the regular restaurant could not.  Even though we were very tempted by the regular (which has a ""Top Chef"" menu with dishes he made on the show), we opted to do a full tapas menu tasting for $95.  We figured we could return on another occasion and try the menu then.  Here are all the tapas included:

MARINATED OLIVES = different olives; not really a fan of olives so I did not eat this.

GOURMET TRUFFLED POPCORN = Yummy!!   A nice snack to munch on but truffles are dangerous. =)

TRUFFLED ONION SOUP SHOOTERS = Rich & decadent - the soup was so smooth and delicious.  I would definitely get this again. 

AHI TUNA TARTARE = served on small spoons with shaved fennel and ginger ponzu; I found it quite tasty but not mind-blowing as I've had tuna like this elsewhere

HEARTS OF PALM SALAD = not really a fan of this one

ORGANIC MIXED GREEN SALAD = vinaigrette dressing with manchego cheese & golden raisins; this salad was much better than the hearts of palm.

ARTISAN CHEESES WITH BAGUETTE = two soft cheeses & 1 hard cheese came with honey comb, papaya puree and grape salad to accompany each cheese along with white chocolate baguette pieces and cranberry baguette.  It was very good - especially with the honey comb!

CROQUE-MONSIEUR SANDWICH = ham, gruyere and bechamel sauce; much better than I thought it would be - I love me a fancy ham & cheese sandwich!

VEAL & YUKON GOLD POTATO RAVIOLI = Probably my favorite of the night!  Savory & melt-in-your-mouth wonderful!  

CHARCUTRIE BOARD = various cut meats with prosciutto, salami, pate, olives, cornichons, baguette & whole grain mustard; I thought the salamis were the best here.

SLIDERS WITH POTATO SHOESTRINGS = the sliders did not taste like beef - they had a ""gamy"" flavor like venison?; They were stuffed with blue cheese and served with the tiniest shoestring fries I've ever seen.

SEARED SKIRT STEAK = topped with chimichurri sauce and served with fingerling potatoes stuffed with sour cream & chives; steak was cooked very nicely and potatoes were delish!  I did not care much for the chimichurri sauce though.  

====
COCONUT PASSION FRUIT SORBET = Sorbet served atop tapioca pearls with kiwi, strawberries and fried plantains; the sorbet was heavenly!

HOUSE MADE ICE CREAM = three flavors including bailey's, chocolate and vanilla - all three were rich and lovely.

HOUSE MADE SORBET = three flavors included raspberry, green apple and blood orange kalamansi.  Raspberry & green apple were good but the blood orange was very sour - maybe a good palate cleanser.  =)

FRESH BAKED MADELEINES = mini madeleines served with warm chocolate ganache; with or without the chocolate, by far the best madeleines I've ever had.


Although I did not fall in love with every single dish, most of them were very yummy and definitely worth every penny.  The service was wonderful as well - we were checked on frequently & they took time to make sure we were enjoying our meal.  One other thing I loved during our dinner was the coffee and tea served to us before the desserts.  My friend had coffee while I had chrysanthemum green tea.  The tray set out was just lovely - it makes me want to have ""tea time.""  The coffee was served in a French press while my tea was served hot in a small pot with the loveliest tea cup & saucer.  Sugar cubes with tongs and saucers with cream were also set out - just so beautiful.  The only thing missing was a nice plate of petit fours.  =)

It was a wonderful experience & I definitely want to return to try more.  Chef Hubert Keller has my culinary heart!",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,5,4,5,DRHJAMfa1iHhcW-rIt6lPw

To the food: my wife had the Wagyu burger - she very much enjoyed this and also the fries. I ordered from the small plates the steak tatar and the herb crusted snails. The tatar was somewhat lacking in proper seasoning so I give that 3 stars. The snails were lacking in anything that could be called herbs and I would rate them 2 stars.

The wines list was unrealistically expensive - a $10 retail priced wine was listed for $50! The atmosphere reminded me of a sports bar - quite dark and uninviting.

The bottom-line: we do not recommend this one. Our 3 stars were based heavily on my wife's Wagyu burger.",235W87YggWprtBY9jKXQTg,0,0,3,0IRwk1iqyZt_qmhWZiDLjQ

My boyfriend had a little too much to drink during Sunday Afternoon Football at a sportbook and was done going out for the night. So, since we were staying at the Mandalay Bay, I thought I would find us some good food to go for dinner (We had room service for breakfast, and of course it was overpriced & mediocre). We've been wanting to try a Hubert Keller restaurant after seeing him on Top Chef, so this was our chance. 

I went to Fleur on a Sunday night. THEY ONLY DO FOOD TO GO AT THE BAR, and of course, you must be 21 and over to sit at the bar. So yes, I got carded. :) Service at the bar was good. I got... 

Angus sliders: Came with 2 sliders and they were just ehh. Fries were nice and light. 
braised short ribs served with warm potato salad: yummy!! Kind of a small portion, but just right for 1 person 
tiramisu: huge portion. great flavors.

2132042,2012-02-18,14,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"The restaurant is now just ""Fleur"".... no longer Fleur de Lys, located inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel.   Fleur means flower in French, but the decor seems to be reminiscent of rustic modern, something you can find in Colorado or Minnesota.  the only ""flower"" i see at the entire place is the cut orchids placed in a glass container.

Instead of indulging in a huge steak dinner, H and i decided to give this place a try for their sampling menu.  As crazy as it sounds, but they offer a tasting menu called the ""feast"" that's meant to serve min of 6 people for $450, but large parties of 10 people have proclaimed that they cannot finish this on their own.  

MINI BITES:
the AHI TACOS ($14) were amazing!  the jalapeno on top gives it a spicy kick and the ahi was seasoned perfectly.

SHORT RIBS ($26)
ah, the price tag was a bit steep considering the size, but well worth it.  braised for many hours, it was so soft and juicy and oozing with flavor.  my fav dish of the night.

NAMPOL'S WINGS ($9)
not too novel in taste or presentation, but tasty indeed.

CEVICHE ($14)
not your typical shrimp ceviche.  i tasted oysters sitting atop a bed of guacamole.  the chips were fried perfectly and had a crunchy crisp.

MIXED GREEN SALAD ($10)  of course you need to fulfill that recommended serving of veggies for the day.

ALMOND PANNA COTTA dessert ($10)
almond cake with blackberry kalamansi sorbet.  this dish was not too sweet for a dessert.  it actually was a bit tart, which was a perfect complement to my sweet cocktails.

LIBATIONS:
FLEUR RED SANGRIA (carafe is $35)
wow, really one of the best sangria H and I ever had.  made from Malbec and Brandy infused with fresh fruits and spice.   it really creeps up on you, too.

DECADENT FLIGHT ($18 for trio of 3 cocktails)
white chocolate, chocolate coconut, and expresso martini.  
Really tastes like a dessert, a little bit sweet, but the presentation was gorgeous.  my fav of the 3 was the white chocolate.  however, i would order this again just bc i love the diversity of flavors.  after all, this is a ""tasting menu"" type of establishment, isn't it?

SERVICE:
was questionable at first, but when we requested a new server, the night turned out ten times better!

After all the hype over this restaurant, I have to say I was rather underwhelmed. Gary Danko and Bottega were much better. But Javier saved the day at Fleur de Lys. 

Our group of 14 chose to get the 6 course tasting menu after being assured that we would be able to state our allergies if needed. I cannot stand cooked fish and thankfully, did Not need to taste the Salmon (yuck).  Our very attentive (and funny) server was Javier and he ""upgraded"" our 6 course meal to 8 courses, complete with 2 desserts and petit fours (which were more like petit tens)

Summary:
- Amuse Bouche: Mine was a piece of sweet beet on a tower of goat cheese which was flavorful. Everyone else got a small piece of tempura fish (eeeks)

- Ahi Poke: Having lived in Hawaii for more than 10 years, i'm really quite an ahi snob. This dish was ok; the ponzu might have been a little  overpowering. 

- Truffled Duck Soup: YUM. They were very generous with the truffle; the tiny little piece of duck was delicious and the piece of truffle it was sitting on was pretty amazing too

- Veal Ravioli: Very delicious. Probably my fave dish of the night. If it wasn't for the fact that I had THE BEST ravioli the night before at the extremely snobbish Ristorante Il Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica (see my review for that), I would have voted this Ravioil the best i've ever tasted. Alas. This will now be allocated 2nd best ravioli ever. But the veal...OMG

- Seared Scallop on a bed of Crab in tomato and bail reduction: This was probably my 2nd least favorite dish if i had to pick one (after the too-ponzued ahi). But only because it was a little too salty and the tomato base was a little too overpowering. The scallop was done perfectly 

- Prime Rib Filet Mignon: Delicious! Done just the way i liked it, medium-rare

- Passionfruit Canal of ice-cream in tapioca coconut sauce: When they busted out this dessert, we all thought it was a really refreshing and tasty end to the 6 course meal. However, my friend Fifi was really quite disappointed that it wasn't a chocolate dish. I don't know if Javier heard her, or he just wanted to keep us around for another 30 mins...but we ended up with ANOTHER 

- Dessert Trio of Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal of Bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle
Peanut Butter Milkshake: VERY tasty. It was rich and peanut buttery and oh so yummy
Chocolate Fondant Cake: Could have been a little sweeter. It was also a little dry, but perfect with the ice-cream
Bailey's Ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: YUM! Loved it!

- Petit Fours/ Sweets: Generous portion of chocolates, roasted cocoa nuts, caneles, jelly...YUM

Javier saved the day with the extra course of tastings. Overall, a pretty great meal, but not sure that I'll pay $140 for it again. Maybe an ala carte meal of Truffled Duck Soup and Veal Ravioli. MmMMmmM",lCmvpQfFpdxhbWVM59eUCg,0,0,4,QQQta3C0sTkaiuW34jl6dg

My carnivorous friends enjoyed all the meat and seafood dishes.  



Desserts were scrum-dilly-umptious as well!

And if the food wasn't enough, the service is just as stellar.  I swear they had a million servers waiting on you hand and foot.  There was the main gal who took our order, the sommelier, the staff who changed our dishes and silverware, the ones who maintained our beverages.  Not once did we re-pour our glasses of wine, or water.  And check this, an attendant to wipe up in the bathroom after each person who comes in.  

This is dining to the 9.  The place was beautiful!  Shades of browns from light to dark are the color schemes of the joint.  Textured walls that look  like stones surround the restaurant.  We were seated in a separated area where we were secluded from the restaurant.  The curtains blocked off the main dining area, so it felt like we had our own private room.

The burger, which was hidden inside the bun, was overcooked, dry and pretty tasteless. (To be fair, the bun was quite good, though that's not really the point of a burger.) Worse, the lettuce, tomato and onion provided on the burger were wilted. The fries were good, but they were a little on the cold side.

The staff was not particularly well trained, and the ambiance was similar to dining in the middle of a crowded mall.  From my experience, Chef Keller (who was there when I dined) does not attempt wildly creative dishes but attempts to provide the best of simple dishes.  Here, all the dishes are small.  

Fleurtini: red grapefruit vodka cocktail served in a martini glass rimmed with sugar.  Very tasty, I couldn't resist getting 2 for the low price of $30, about what I spent total at Keller's Burger Bar the night before.

Tarte Falmbee: long crispy appetizer cracker with asparagus, onion, bacon, and herbs.  Slight truffle flavor.  Absolutely delicious.  

Salmon: served with horseradish dill sauce.  simple but flavorful.  

Duck Confit: contained a truffle sauce infusion, served in 4 tiny crispy pieces.  Very nice duck flavor, but nothing like the decadence I've had in France.

Wild Mushroom Ragout: not a ragout at all but a pile of a few varying mushrooms covered with black pepper.  As a mushroom fan, I quite liked it.   

fingerling potato puree: very smooth, with a slight truffle flavor and fresh herbs.  Combined well with the mushrooms.  

Affogato: The best affogato I ever had was at Ferrara in Little Italy, NYC.  This may have been better.  They brought out fresh vanilla Bailey's flavored fresh cream and froze it at the table with liquid nitrogen.  Very cool!

I was extremely satisfied with the meal, my last on my Vegas trip, but the price was too much, at about $150 per person, without ordering wine.",uqEPHUnpXhb18sXIAccmhw,0,0,4,57bLxXBynp4bf0W4JckXmA

The Skinny: had the best chicken dish in a long time - it was slightly ridiculous how good it was! but trust me... don't order the duck (4), Service - I think our server was not as good as some of the others (3), Value - pretty good - gave us 2 free dishes (3).

Okay, I know this is my 2nd review update in the space of a month but I gotta get it while it's good and still open. Plus, both my hubby's and my birthdays fall within a month of each other so it's okay to be a little on the splurging side.

Normally, we either go for a nice prix fixe menu - more affordable and more complete experience. However, everytime we see something on the a la carte menu that piques our interests. So this time, we came armed with a $50 restaurant.com coupon and bit the bullet.

We ordered the organic beet salad, the foie gras tasting 3 ways, the organic chicken, the peking duck and finally, an almond panna cotta.

Again, an amuse bouche of fried cod and potato salad which was very good (like our previous visit).

The foie gras was served in three preparations with brioche - a foie gras cappucino, a foie gras seared with a fruit compote and a foie gras terrine. The cappucino was very smooth, lusciously foamy and really accented the true flavour of the foie. The seared preparation with fruite compote was a classic and well prepared. The terrine was wonderful as well. My only complaint about the dish was it could have used more warm brioche to go with the foie gras.

The organic beet salad with poached quail egg and ham was okay. For 6-7 small cubes of beets, each topped with a fleck of microgreen, with 4 quail eggs with a sliver of ham - $19 seemed overpriced. Although the presentation was astounding, I prefer their mixed green salad with polenta. Disappointingly, it was the only salad option on the a la carte appetizer menu.

We both received a free 1/2 sized portion of the halibut entree. The halibut was seared perfectly - wonderful crust - but unfortunately was a little bland in the middle portion of the fish. The accompanying sweet corn/fava bean succotash was delightful.

The peking duck was a rather large disappointment. When you tell an Asian that you're making Peking duck - that skin better be crispy. And crispy it ain't. Although the duck breast was well-cooked, the skin was nothing like Peking duck. The cloyingly saccharine sauce on top really overpowered that dish. Paired with a tough, overcooked foie gras on the bottom, you have a culinary mess on your hands.

That being said, the roast chicken dish was the best chicken dish I have had in a long time. The roasted chicken skin was so wonderfully crisp and seasoned and I savoured each bite (I normally remove the skin entirely). The moisture and texture of the meat was amazing.

I have to admit - I was a little skeptical about when I saw foam covering the chicken breast. With so many restaurants using foam, it's become a bit of a cliche. But I understand why this technique was used in this case - the foam added that wonderful umami flavour of truffle without compromising the wonderful texture of the crisp chicken skin. The accompanying morel mushroom and cabbage completed this wonderfully well envisioned and balanced package of a dish.

The almond panna cotta was good but not astounding. The flavour combinations were wonderful if only the panna cotta had a better texture. To quote Nigella Lawson: [panna cotta should have] ""the quiver of a 17th century courtesan's inner thigh"". It was a little too solid for our tastes and not quite as silky smooth as other preparations we've enjoyed in the past. 

Of note, we were not offered petit fours at the end of our meal this evening unlike our previous prix fixe menu experience.

Overall, a great meal with some highs and lows and the bill came to around $125 tip and tax (discounting the cost of the $50 coupon).",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,3,2,4,NJtl862J0cJj5U7lxt4T8Q

2223032,2011-12-28,1,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Our experience bounced between one and five stars so many times that I'm not sure how to rate.

I didn't know much about Hubert Keller before we went to Fleur for lunch yesterday, other than I'd eaten at Burger Bar (very interesting, not always my thing, but the finesse and creativity elevated the experience) and had seen him on TV once (seems friendly and passionate).

Since lunch, I've been all over Keller's website and Facebook page. In fact, the chef has already very kindly responded to a question I asked. So, I feel awkward being critical but... Yelpers gotta Yelp.

Let's get the downside out of the way.


THE BAD

SOFT DRINKS. Not shown on the menu, but the server told us the choices. No lemonade, but juice, tea, and soda. What we didn't expect was for it to come in a can. There's just something a little tacky about a can of soda sitting on your table in what Mandalay Bay is advertising as ""signature dining.""

Odd, but easy to laugh off... until we saw the bill. That can of Pepsi was five dollars. Five dollars and warm, even.


SERVICE. Our waiter greeted us by asking if we were ready to order. No drink order first, just a rushed vibe. This wasn't a big deal, but it foreshadowed where things were going.

We asked for water. Our stubby glasses were brought out half-full. Or half-empty. Maybe it was supposed to be a philosophical amuse bouche, but it still came down to 2-3 inches of water. (Then later, before we had the first sip, ""refilled."")

Service was slow. After another waiter brought a to-go box, I still had time to change my mind about dessert a half-dozen times.

The real problem was our waiter's attitude. Not unfriendly, but really not interested. Such a contrast to the man who brought out dessert, who proudly described the three elements of the dish. (He also seemed to be a managerial type?) That was more like it. 

But when our regular waiter returned to (finally, if totally perfunctory) ask how it was, I barely had ""extraordinary"" out of my mouth before he threw out a terse ""Yep"" and ""Is there anything else?"" And that was him at his most involved.


SOME PRICES. Cans of soft drink for $5 each aside, the burger is the same price as those at the Burger Bar ($18), but it's a very pedestrian offering compared to those creations. (Taste will be detailed in my husband's review.)


VEGETARIAN VARIETY. The menu on the MB website is out of date. The capellini has since replaced with a Bolognese dish, leaving only one option: the grilled vegetable sandwich. Bummer. Keller is so veg-friendly with the dinner menu (and the Burger Bar menu), that one vegetarian main option at lunch was as surprising as it was disappointing.



THE AVERAGE

ATMOSPHERE. Natural light from the skylight enhances the patio dining. Sit by the rail if you want to people-watch, but stay near the back if big-screen sports from the bar TVs will mar your dining. The more elegant area behind the bar/TVs was closed during our visit.


SOME FOOD. The tomato flambe (made with gruyere, not with fontina like on the website, but I love either) was light but oily/messy, and a little bland after the first piece. My veg sandwich fell apart quickly, and I couldn't really taste the tarragon aioli, but the bread and vegetables were pleasant enough. Not amazing.


DRESS CODE. Some sites say dressy. Some say casual. Some say ""chic casual."" Our fellow diners included people wearing baseball caps and a baby in a high chair. Mike wore jeans and a polo; I wore a simple blouse with black pants and black sneakers. Neither of us felt out of place. This may only fly at lunch or perhaps on the patio, but I'm a big fan of a dress code that allows for the ""clean, nothing ripped, no pit hair showing"" look. (So, don't be intimidated by the Kim Kardashian stylings of the hostess.)



THE OMG-WOOHOO! TERRITORY

MANCHEGO SALAD. One star for naming, as the only manchego in the salad is a sparse dusting on the very top leaves. The salad was big enough to share, we but each only got one bite with a hint of the cheese. Other than that, it was a truly beautiful salad - the mix of semi-bitter lettuces, almonds, plump-but-twee golden raisins, and strips of pepper worked. I'd come back just for this and...


CILANTRO GRANITE. Part of the pineapple carpaccio dish, and while that was delicate and delicious, and - unlike some photos here - served beautifully in the shape of a flower with tiny pink flowers set inside, the granite opened my mouth and mind to a whole new set of flavors. 

My photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=78mWlGCGbQw6wJ_aeVGz_w

This dish is everything I was hoping to encounter at Fleur: imagination, skill, and something special and perhaps unexpected in the taste.


Outstanding dessert and salad, nice appetizer, ho-hum mains, and unwelcoming service with a few uncalled-for prices. I doubt I'll be back, but I'll be first in line to buy the new cookbook with the granite recip",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,6,1,3,pC8zKcxTVD_6nAJhOSTlrA

2244814,2009-10-08,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Again restaurant week did me a big favor and i got to try another famous chefs restaurant, which seems to be my new thing while visiting vegas.  There were 2 restaurant week offerings a $50 and a $30 3 course meal, I chose the $50 one. 

The first course i got to choose between truffled onion soup or braised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli in veal jus.  I was a bit hesitant to get the ravioli because I'm typically disappointed by its thick skin and bland dry cheese inside.  I was very happily surprised!  The ravioli skin was paper thin and delicate and soaked up all the flavor from the veal jus on the plate.  It must take some skill to make them that thin and not have them fall apart.  I can say for the first time, that i like ravioli!  The only problem is that I wish there was more!  I think there was only about 6 of them and i wiped every last drip of the sauce from the plate clean with my bread! 

2nd course was a citrus glazed halibut with muscles, clams and chorizo.  There was a bit of a change from the original restaurant week offerings.  Halibut had replaced monk fish, and broccoli puree had replaced broccoli florets.  I was impressed by the halibut but think monk fish would have been even better and real broccoli florets much better than puree.  None the less it tasted great with the exception of broccoli puree which was the only thing i left on the plate.

3rd course was molten chocolate lava cake, bailies ice cream, and peanut butter cream shake.  The dessert was a let down for me.  Although it was good, it was a bit plain and run of the mill.  No stretch of the imagination.  Chocolate lava cake?  don't you get that almost anywhere?  and my peanut butter cream shake was warm as were other people at my table.  Although the ice cream and shake complemented the lava cake well, it  was still a chocolate lava cake.

Pros:  A great meal, great flavor done with great technique.  But i have to say the best service i've EVER had.  Being a former fine dining waiter, i know, this was a whole step above!  The table was always approached by 2 waiters, dishes and silverware were brought and removed in almost mirror fashion!  I over heard the staff wanting to buss our table but then someone saying, no the other tables food is ready, ""food first"" he said;  which is what you want! You know that your food is not sitting around and it is getting to your table ASAP! 

Cons:  Quiet and hush hush in there, but i guess it's fine dining, and a nice change from the noise and clamor of the casino outside. 

Verdict: awesome food, even better service! maybe in my top 5 best places i've eaten, and BEST service i've ever had!  

Advice: make reservations and always check the website for specials there before you go (they did not offer the restaurant week menu when we sat down).",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,3,1,5,pSEyxGFXkeo7YIr443veQg
2261582,2011-06-11,5,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I'm a sucker for all things tiny. So I love small plates.  I just like to share and try a whole bunch of little things.  So this place wins me over on concept alone. 

We tried the tuna tacos, skirt steak, nampol messa wings, and artichoke barigoule.  The tuna tacos were good, but a little to big to eat in one bite and a little too messy to not eat in one bite.  They need to be smaller or less crunchy.  

The skirt steak was good, but it came with one tiny fingerling potato that wasn't really shareable.  I don't think there is a potato crisis right now so pony up a few more.  It came with a ton of tomatoes.  

The nampol messa wings were extremely tasty.  Right amount of spice, meat came right off the bone, and the salad they came with was very tangy and crunchy.  A good contrast to the wings.

The artichoke barigoule had issues.  The carrots, artichoke hearts, asparagus, and tomatoes were ok but they just tasted like vegetables.  They hadn't soaked up any of the sauce.  The cheese was excellent but we needed more of it.  And we didn't realize that there were spoons on the table in a little box until after they took the dish away.  It may have been better with spoons to get more of the sauce.  I'm not getting the concept of having a box of spoons on the table anyway.  They give you a fork and knife... why are the spoons self-service?

One of the things I really liked is their flight of cocktails.  The tropical flight was delightful with a Sumo, sparkling peach, and cherry limeade.  The cocktails were large enough to get a good buzz on.  And you get to try three different cocktails!  Pretty good for 18 bucks.

They can make any cocktail with liquid nitrogen for $25.  We didn't go for this.  But we did go for the affogato a la LN2 served tableside for $15.  LN2 stands for liquid nitrogen, by the way.  They mix it right at your table and you get all the smoke and the ooos and ahhs from other tables.  It's a nice touch.  And the dessert is delicious.  I couldn't have much because it has espresso in it, but still very tasty.  Also, the PB&J macaroons with tiny rum shakes are to die for.  

The decor pretty much looks like Fleur de Lys did, at least when you get into the inside dining room.  Feels fancy but then you look at the 300-lb tourist spilling out of his shorts and t-shirt eating with a camera around his neck and think, maybe not. But I'm disappointed that they took out the roses on the wall and just put in tile or something.  I heard the roses were gone and I thought it was because of some major remodel.  But the frame is still there, they just took the roses away.  Don't know why because they were charming and everyone raved about them.

Service was very good, except for the spoon issue.  Could have let a sister know!  I definitely recommend coming here for the meat dishes or dessert.  The one vegetarian dish we tried needs some work but it might have just been a fluke... or our inability to find the spoons.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,5,5,4,Hym2ik8x-KSPgAN0pbt9pQ

When our waiter came by, he never introduced himself, smiled or made us feel welcomed.  It felt more like, we interrupted him.

We ordered...
Fleur Pom Mimosa - Delicious!
Black Garlic Escargot - Delicious!
Kimchi Fried Rice - Okay but not great.
Scallops - very sandy, the smoky taste ruins the delicate flavor of the scallops.  No need for all that smoked bacon for this particular dish.  This was the worst dish I've had in over a year.
Rosemary feta bread - trying to figure out where there was a rosemary or feta.  We got a poppy seed bread and a jalapeno corn bread.  

If this was a place that didn't over price the food, I could understand them charging for the bread.  But to be charged so much, then being charged for something that other restaurants offer at no charge is a bit much...especially when all you get is two small rolls.

The menu has changed quite a bit.  It seems all over the place.

2290486,2011-03-28,5,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"To paraphrase the late great Clara Peller: ""Where's the lobster?!""
I am referring to the absence of edible lobster in the Lobster Mac & Cheese ($14) that I ordered as part of our $150+ meal for two. There were exactly 4 tiny pieces of cartilage from the claw-point of the lobster (I always discard this part when I eat lobster) and it seems that they throw that crap in there to trick customers into thinking there's actually lobster in the dish. Even more maddening is flipping through the channels in our room upstairs and stopping on 'MLife TV' to watch Hubert Keller himself describe the 'most comforting American food' being his signature Lobster Mac & Cheese - he then chops up an entire lobster tail and tosses it in his mac & cheese skillet.

The Onion Soup ($6) was oddly thick and tasted really bad-for-you like it was made with lots of butter. The Crab & Avocado Sphere ($9) was pretty good, but it would be pretty hard to mess that up (chilled jumbo lump crab and avocado slices.) 

The Branzino ($29) fish was about a 5-ounce portion and sat atop an inedible mound of salty and sour ""risotto"" barley with some random chorizo sauce that made it worse. The Kushi Oysters ($9) were much smaller than the awesome ones we got at Sensi a week earlier, and the shuckers at Fleur get an F for leaving bits of top shell shavings in with the oyster, ruining two of the oysters.

If you must go to Fleur, do NOT sit on the patio like we did. The dueling piano bar entertainment 50 yards away is really hard on the ears in more ways than one. We endured a 7-minute version of ""Barbie World"" and the electric pianos they use sound like 100 decibel cell phone ringtones. The water fountain around the corner only adds to the chaos.

Anyways, people seem to love this restaurant, but I don't get it. I would be totally down with $50-$70 per person at a tapas-style place if the food was good. Unfortunately it isn't.

My husband and I came here for our anniversary and both had the elegance menu. 

My first course was the tuna tartare with a shaved fennel slaw. Sure, it's not the most creative dish, but it was very, very, tasty. The fennel with the ponzu sauce complimented the tartare cleanly and wonderfully. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.

The second dish was the chorizo wrapped sea bass. All I can say is, oh. my. gawd. I could have had 12 servings of this dish and not be tired of it. This dish was ridiculously good and it is one of THE best dishes I have EVER had, and that's saying a lot. 

The third dish was the filet mignon. The filet melted like butter on the tongue. This dish was extremely well executed but not nearly as creative as the second course. 

For dessert, we had the chocolate cake with popcorn ice cream (which was awesome) and a peanut butter shake, which I did not like so much. The peanut butter shake was way too overpowering and peanut-buttery, it didn't fit in with the rest of the dessert. 

The chef brought out a complementary passion fruit chocolate cake with the words, ""happy anniversary"" on it. That was so sweet and such a nice touch. This dessert actually was my favorite one. The passion fruit gave an acidity and fruitiness that balanced out the dark chocolate perfectly. 

This place is very, very expensive (our meal was over $300), but completely worth it. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and would definitely come back for another special occasion.",JZQmMZYnjQor8xtedkCUXg,0,0,4,F1nKk2-ubL4LRn5stUNAUA

On a recent trip to Las Vegas to celebrate my brother in law's birthday, we booked his birthday dinner at Fleur de Lys. I have always liked Hubert Keller and wanted to try out his restaurant since it's always have had good reviews. We are big fans of his burger joint so we figured that Fleur de Lys would be sensational. Pretty much to sum it up, service was horrendous. We had a reservation for 5 at 9pm and didn't get our table until 10pm. We waited very patiently and had some drinks. When we were seated, the waitress seemed nice enough. 4 out of 5 of us ordered the ""Elegance Menu"" with fois gras that came out to over $114 per person but we wanted the best. Anyhow, by 11pm we still didn't have our main course, by midnight dessert wasn't even served. Half way through, at 11pm we find out that our waitress went home and didn't even tell us. The restaurant didn't notify us of the wait staff change so we had no one waiting on the table for almost an hour. The general manager seemed to visit the table behind us frequently and NEVER came to check on us. We missed our evening engagement since we were so late at dinner. All of us were so tired that we couldn't even eat dessert. My brother in law was so upset that he sent back his birthday dessert. I am appalled at how we were treated. Finally my husband had to tell some poor waiter who happened to walk by, which then he responded that he couldn't do anything and went to get a manager. I believe the manager, named Danny? He did not even look like he cared. He offered to comp two of the meals but seriously, with all the money we were spending, we should have walked away without even giving them a cent. A birthday evening was ruined and pretty much we left Vegas feeling pretty disappointed. I find out from a waiter that the restaurant is closing in a few weeks anyway. Wow, what a way to end. Poor, poor service. 

By the way, the quality of the patrons has also truly gone down. Since when do you wear shorts to fine dining? Ugh. Disgusted.",TvgzAju05vloe1suTLK6JA,0,0,1,h8u3eG2MguSlhLhffQU4Iw

Maybe if more attention was given to the food and service this place could be a hit.  The menu looks good but was poorly executed.

Service 3 stars:  Our server was just ok.  He didn't do anything wrong but he was not very helpful with recommending any food and drinks.  It was not like the restaurant was busy or anything like that.  I just expect more from the staff of a restaurant with a $5000 burger on the menu.

Food 2 stars:  We ordered several dishes to share for the four of us.  We first ordered the hangover sliders and field green salad which were $16 & $15 each. The sliders weren't anything special. We could've ordered that at any chain restaurant and it would've tasted just as good or better.  The salad was just ok.  The garlic escargot vol-au-vent had a fancy name but the escargot was cold and the pastry was not flaky at all.  The LA Galbi taste like any other Korean take out restaurant in hawaii.

Overall, some dishes were over salted, and specific components on the plate were luke warm in temperature. 

- The amuse we received tasted like a fish stick. All we could really taste was fried batter. 
- Truffled onion soup: yum 
- Tuna Tartar: mediocre, tasted like something you could get at any decent Japanese restaurant.

- Grand Marnier Souffle and Elderflower Ice Cream: we really only ate the ice cream. The souffle was a bit under cooked, but the ice cream was delicately flavored, perfectly sweetened, and probably one of the best things we ate all night.

The truffle onion soup! So delicious!!!! For $6 it is a must try. 
Foie gras was some sort of pate and spread over bread YUM. Highly recommended.
""In the shower"" lobster mac and cheese- I thought it included a fair amount of lobster unlike a couple of the posts I've read. 
Pork Schnitzel was tasty but not spectacular. It tasted quite tender and looked to be breaded pork that had been pan fried. Tasted similar things but nothing exactly like this. 
Charcuterie platter- a platter with a number of different cured meats. Nothing too special to me anyway.

It was watery like they just boiled the noodles and rushed it out before draining the hot water. Truffle onion soup was tasty and well presented, so we thought the noodles were just a fluke. Foie Gras wasn't a taste we've acquired yet, so I want to be fair, it's probably good for those who like it. On to drinks: we ordered the trio sampler... let's just say it brought us back to the days when frat boys were passing out shots to the freshman girls.

We stayed at Mandalay Bay this past weekend, it was a group of 6 people (3 couples). We ate on property several times...Citizens, Libertine Social, Burger Bar, and at our Cabana, etc. All restaurants were good except for Fleur.

Our dinner started out fine, drinks/wine and starters were delivered in a timely fashion and our server seemed attentive. The salads and soups were just OK -- nothing special. After our starters we waited over an hour for our main courses to arrive. I tried to make eye contact with our server --- I could not get his attention once to check on our food when he walked by.

Finally when we got his attention to find out what was happening with our order he advised us a large party was causing a delay. We continued to wait another 10 minutes when our food finally came out. Not all together, by the way! My octopus was cold and the flavor was lacking (ok actually not good at all). My husband's osso bucco was just OK.  Our friend's entree's included the new Zealand salmon, a burger, and skirt steak.  Nothing was outstanding -- the burger with the abalone was probably the best.

We politely complained about the wait and I informed the waiter about my octopus being cold. They did offer to get me a new one but at that point I wasn't interested. The manager must have been alerted that we were not having a great experience -- they brought over some fruity alcoholic drinks/shots with a tahini looking salted rim.

To begin they served us complimentary Moscato D'Asti which is an Italian Dessert wine, and while we are not drinkers, it was so light and refreshing, my wife had seconds. 

They next brought an amuse bouche which was a beet served on a dollop of Goat Cheese. 

I had the 7 course tasting menu and was pleasantly surprised by each and every course. Started with Ahi Tuna over a shredded fennel slaw, next was the silkiest creamy onion soup I have ever had with just a touch of black truffle. Then to the veal ravioli, it wasn't bad but wasn't a highlight like the next course, which was a poached hamachi fillet served with a ginger sauce and mushrooms. So delicate and just full of flavor. That was followed up by the best lamb i have ever encountered. served over a couscous with a mango chutney. The pre-dessert course was a mango gelato served on banana bread, swimming in a coconut soup containing strawberries, tapioca pearls, and fried plantains. The final course was the low-light for me, a molten chocolate banana cake with a cup of espresso. I felt that the bitterness of the espresso really ruined all the beautiful flavors of everything else but i didn't eat enough of it to allow it to affect my incredible meal. 

My wife had the surf and turf which was a prime fillet with a butter poached lobster. It was served with a potato puree that is precisely what potatoes should taste like. 

The entire meal was just beyond words and lived up to my HIGH expectations. 

The Service was excellent and while expensive i felt it was worth the money. My only complaint is $5 for 8oz of soda. I'm OK with being gouged on the food but not on the soda's.

The remodeled restaurant is now simply, FLEUR. Recently re-opened just 3 weeks ago.The menu has been revamped to be more of a tastings menu, small dishes.

We asked our server if it was possible to take a photo with him, and she said it would not be a problem. ""He is one of the nicest people, and it would be his pleasure.""  Before our food arrived, Chef Keller made his way back to the floor, and he made a bee line for our table. We were 3 grown women swooning over him like we were teenagers. Ohmygoodness, he was incredibly sweet and such a gentleman. Shook our hands and leaned down to make sure we had eye contact and thanked us for coming. So funny, but as soon as he came out to talk to us, a group of ladies walking by ( we sat on the patio) recognized him from the Top Chef, and shrieked with delight and bear hugged him over the rail. Hahahah. He was so gracious, took photos with them, and then turned back to us to apologized for the interruption. No big deal for us, it was just so nice to see him make sure he acknowledge everyone.

After such an unforgettable dining experience, we were told the kitchen would like to send out some more desserts. WHAT? oh heck yah!  So incredibly nice.....we were treated to a pineapple carpaccio, delicately sliced with sorbet, a mixed berry with honey roasted nuts and cream.

Fleur by Hubert Keller is one of those instances where the potential is clearly greater than the experience. Some of the bites we tasted were exceptional!...not your typical tapas spot here. Unfortunately, the atmosphere is closer to your typical tapas spot than it is to the level of the food and the price tag.

We came in on a Friday evening and experienced the 2016 Tastes From Around The World five course menu. $140 allows two people to enjoy a tasting menu of 10 different items. The food is well executed and composed of quality ingredients justifying the price for this Las Vegas Strip restaurant. In fact, the food was so plentiful that we boxed most of one item up to go and merely sampled the dessert item. We also chose five course wine pairing on this evening--a reasonable choice at $55 per person, but nothing we couldn't live without. There was one curiously remarkable pairing of Gnocchi Bolognese of braised ox tail ragout and a Napa Valley Fume Blanc that we found irresistible. In general however, I think we could have spent $110 on a bottle of Pinot or Grenache, or a glass of each for my love and myself and enjoyed it a little more.

Aside from my pulchritudinous dinner partner, the highlight of the evening was the Scallops for me and the Beef Carpaccio for my love...although we both raved about the Gnocchi wine pairing--a true wine pairing that elevated both wine and food. There were more hits than misses for us on thus night however. I loved the assembled bites of the octopus, taking the time to create mini wields of art containing all the components of this dish paid great dividends. 

My biggest issues with Fleur are the setting and the service. The space is adorned well enough, but even in the back of the restaurant you can hear the noise of typically loud patrons of Mandalay Bay Casino walking to and from the casino floor. The service wasn't bad by any means, but it also wasn't 5 star service at this price point. Instead, the service was perfectly 4 stars.

While friends put together their lists of shows and casinos to visit, I compiled a list of award-winning chefs and their restaurants I wanted to experience. 

By far, Fleur de Lys was the best restaurant of the trip and may be the best meal (or a very close second) I've had. The tasting menu has changed since March, so I won't give a complete rundown of every dish. However, every component was expertly balanced and prepared. My favorite was the truffled onion soup (AMAZING!) And then I had that bite of duck ragout accompaniment and it transformed into something even more AMAZING. I made mental plane ticket reservations to come back at the earliest opportunity. A friend exclaimed in her slightly-crass-but-always-on-the-nose way ""Oh my God. It's like breast milk from the Mother Mary.""  I'm NOT a dessert gal, but would consider trading my engagement ring for the dessert trio with popcorn-flavor ice cream.

It didn't matter if we took 10 minutes or 30 minutes enjoying each course, as soon as we set our forks down, the plates were whisked away, glasses re-filled, and a new course delivered. Seriously... there wasn't even a two-minute lag. I know how hard it can be to orchestrate delivery of two courses to 80 diners at 30 tables over the course of an hour. To do this consistently for four or five course meals with every item at the perfect temperature - this is where you separate the men from the boys. So beautiful and delicious and efficient... 

Jorge was in charge of our table and seemed liked a very knowledgeable old friend. He was personable in a manner you normally don't find in 5-star restaurants. When asked, he could quickly recommend the best authenic non-strip Thai food in town, even telling us how to get there and when to avoid a crowd. Vegas, like New York City or Rome, is a place where hospitality service personnel can have real and lucrative careers. He has been at FdL for years and shines with pride. As we were talking, he mentioned it was too bad we came in late that night, since Chef Keller had already gone home. During the third course, I feel a hand on my shoulder and Chef Keller has come back to give my table of three a tour of the back of the house and operations. Seriously. That's how much this guy loves food and those who enjoy it. (Let me add, I've never seen a cleaner kitchen - not a dirty prep station, random towel, or dish in sight. I feel like a slob.) Keller was very giving of his time and advice. I can't believe this was the night I left my camera in the hotel room. Needless to day, I was charmed and have already made a reservation to celebrate my husband's 40th at Fleur de Lys on Oct 1. 

As a side note, I'm convinced Chef Keller has a bit of the mojo. After leaving FdL, I walked straight in to the casino and bet on 00 at the roulette table (which I have never played). It hit and paid 65-to-1. I turned that over and continued to win 12-to-1 on six more hands. Not wanting to push it, I left Mandalay Bay. But not before I won $174 playing one penny on a slot machine.",2CgYtaxYW14ovv1M9hVU_Q,1,1,5,F4FPpm3fpwUonIWM2VMkyw
2503457,2011-07-12,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I dined at fleur de lys and had a pretty good meal.

Fleur, however, was disappointing.

Pretty good service.

The food was less than that which we expected.

Fig flambé was a long cracker with some figs on it. Total ripoff
Chicken croquettes was ok. Another ripoff.
Sautéed shrimp tasted ok. Nothing special
Artichokes were bizarre and not worth finishing.
Schnitzel was pretty good. The sides of potatoes and cucumbers helped a bunch.

Perhaps the biggest farce and ripoff was to be perpetrated by the Mac and cheese with (alleged) lobster. No lobster was visible. The serving was perhaps 2/3 of a cup of ordinary Mac and cheese for the insane price of $18. This is among the most expensive offerings and arguably the cheapest to prepare.

As another yelper noted, desserts were far better than the rest of their menu. The trio of creme brulees was excellent. Cheesecake lollipops were also good.

The atmosphere is loud!!! Techno Beat thumping away all night.

Not the place to go for a relaxed meal. As soon as the first plate appears, the remaining plates are thrust upon you within seconds.
The result is a frenzied dining experience.

I will not consider returning. So many other (better) restaurants in LV for the same $

I have read lots bout hubert (chef) and this place before coming here and was very excited to taste top notch food from such a famous French chef. We had few things to share as we wanted get a really good taste. 1. Warm halloumi cheese with grilled vegetables- yes the cheese was good and grilled but served on a bed of mixed greens with Tons!!! Of balsamic vinegar!!!! Which almost burned my mouth (vinegar) which took over and killed taste of veggies and cheese. Chef- easy with that balsamic or just simple don't used it at all!!! 
2. Stuffed peppers with quinoa - no taste at all. Very blended and definitely missing a taste! 
3. Shrimp and grits - no taste at all again. The shrimp were marinated in something that really doesn't have a taste at all. Very blended and missing a taste again! 
4. Wild mushroom ragout- oh my! My grandma cooks better wild mushrooms with butter than that dish. Yes mushrooms were fresh but once again no taste and leading  composition. 
I'm a person who very barely use salt&pepper on any dish as I expect to be cooked without a need to use it and always thought it is a slap to a chef when people use salt&pepper on anything but mushrooms really needed a hint of both to save some sort of a taste. 
After that dish we gave up and did not order more plates to taste (as we planned to do ) and asked for a check. 
Service was good and that star belongs to our server! 
P.s. Decor of this place was very confusing to me too. I think someone just lost an idea how this place should look like leather bulky chairs with embroidery? No!!!",EE1QRBTyrDAmzNdgbuJMZw,1,0,1,ou-QbgpfoQ_zUt5vthroPQ

There were four of us dining for lunch, and we all thought our respective meals were lousy. Hubert Keller, come save your restaurant!

And as we had to wait thirty minutes for our meals to arrive, I asked the waiter if they.  served bread or anything munch on. His response? They could do ""dinner roll service"" for only $1.25 per roll. Fuggedaboudit.

We had planned to eat at Fleur de Lys, not realizing it had closed and that Hubert Keller had created a new restaurant in it's place. When we tried to make a reservation, we realized the situation and decided to eat there anyway. We ate at Fleur on 03/02/11 with a group of nine and ordered THE MENU, which at that time was $415. It was AWESOME. We were served 37 small plates (including the seven desserts) - they told us that it feeds 6-8, but we all nine left full. It does NOT include the large plates or Indulge menu items, however the 37 dishes were all amazing and I was okay in missing out on those pricier dishes. 

Of course we had some drinks as well. The plates are small, so not everyone got to taste every item, but it worked out great, there were some things that someone might not want, so the people who did slurped it up. Eight people would probably be a little better for divvying up the portions, but wow! 

It came to $57 per person, which we thought was very reasonable for this AMAZING meal.  I think if we had each just ordered our own dishes it would have been a completely different experience.  It also created a great atmosphere, we were all excited to see what was going to come out next as servers just sort of kept bringing more dishes! I highly recommend this experience if you have a party of this size.

Our service was very good. The waitress assigned to us was very attentive and kept the food coming. There was one time of about 8-10 minutes when the food stopped and we were uncertain if we were done or not, but then came more. We had a separate ""room"" that was curtained off from the restaurant, which was nice and probably a good thing as we were a little rowdy that night.

The highlights for me were the mac & cheese, mushrooms, mashed potatos, cheese platter, steak tartare (which I hadn't had before), tuna tacos, and these AMAZING toasted garbanzo beans. The onion soup shooters were to die for and I was loving the sangria, although the drinks were pricey. I even tried a raw quail egg!

2673717,2011-12-15,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Just ate at Fleur last night after the MJ Immortal Tour show.  Saw a yelper mention that they're on Restaurant.com, so just ordered up a $50 certificate (for $4) on my phone right before we ate, and when we got there they said they could print it for us if we forwarded the manager the email.   How easy is that?

Tomato Flambe - Not what we were expecting at all - my wife said she thought it would be a stuffed tomato lit on fire but it turned out to be a flatbread with tomato and microbasil - a bit like a margherita pizza but lighter.  It's a classic blend of flavors and was prepared well.

""In the shower"" Lobster Mac and Cheese - I assumed this was a shout out to Keller's dorm-room pasta from Top Chef Masters and as such, had to order it.  The macaroni is the small elbow type that is exactly like what you'd get out of a Kraft box, but it's made luxurious with the lobster meat and cheesy bread crumb topping.  For a ""small plate"" the portion for this was huge - it could be a full entree by itself.

Hambul ""Wings"" - A spicy Thai take on Buffalo-style chicken wings.  There were only six flats on the plate, so this is definitely a light appetizer.  The wings were well-cooked and the glaze was sweet and hot.  I think it was a successful dish.

Creamy Polenta - This was absolutely fantastic.  It had small pieces a charred corn and parmesan mixed throughout, giving it texture and little pops of flavor.  Delicious.

Fleur Burger - This is a burger that knows exactly what it's trying to do.  It's a thick, perfectly cooked and seasoned patty of tender Wagyu beef, possibly with cheese, on a bun.  Don't expect toppings to get in between you and the meat - this burger is simply about appreciating the flavor of the beef.  My only minor complaint was that the juices from the meat soaked into the brioche bun and the resulting texture was less than optimal.

Tableside Bailey's and Espresso Ice Cream - How do they do tableside ice cream, you ask?  With liquid nitrogen of course!  Our waiter brought over a tray with a metal bowl, a flask of Bailey's creme anglaise, a shot of espresso, and a carafe of liquid nitrogen.  The Bailey's creme anglaise gets turned into almost instant ice cream, then the espresso gets poured on top followed by another dose of LN2 to refreeze everything.  Novel idea with spectacular results.  I need to make some Bailey's ice cream now and pour espresso over it at home - what a brilliant after-dinner treat.

After the discount this wound up being $55 ($59 if you count the cost of the certificate).  I'm giving this 5 stars because of how easily they handled the promotion and how insanely good everything was for that price.  Consider this 4 stars if you are paying full menu price, as the food and service are still excellent but I wouldn't consider it to be as much of a value.",KGS0J7jL_oZQU7McAUuJQQ,3,1,5,FbPDrQZLdxt3jZ_q0nbUCw

I have to say, I'm a little disappointed. 

My BF and I decided to go here for lunch one day. Figured it would be a good place to get a small bite since we were planning on a big dinner. We got four appetizers and honestly it was the perfect amount of food. To start with we got the tuna tacos. They were actually very good, the taco itself was a crispy (rather than soft) style taco. The sushi grade tuna was accompanied by a bit of spice supplied by some Serrano. This was a good dish, if perhaps a bit overpriced, though perhaps since it was sushi grade I shouldn't complain? The second dish was the highlight of the lunch - gazpacho. This was a green gazpacho and it was made from tomatillos. It was delicious, refreshing and made me want more! Next came a nice little flat-bread; the caramelized onions, bacon and truffle gave it a sweet/savory bite - very satisfying. The big disappointment of the meal came from the lobster mac and cheese. Not only was it not that flavorful, but it was runny! Seriously? make it gooey, not runny; it was almost like the pasta wasn't drained prior to adding the cheese. Also - the lobster in it was not very plentiful. For the price, I would have expected a better quality dish. 

This was probably closer to a 3.5 star experience and though I might go back, its definitely not up there as a high priority (though if I do go back, I might have to get some more of that soup!)",QUGK3WduEPsZ3TSrfyRcGw,2,0,3,cLdgb66oR3vXQLdevKy8mw

First we started off with amuse bouche compliments of the chef of tempurad halibut with a potato salad.  Then we had a onion soup that was out of this world.  It was creamy and savory.  Next, course was a veal with a potato ravioli with a veal sauce... reccomendation is to use the sauce for bread.  Then, we had a olive oil poached hamachi with shitake mushrooms.  The final coarse we had a guiness braised beef short rib.  THis was probably the most inovative dish i had that night which used a guiness foam..

The service was laid back and on point. I never had to ask for anything and someone was always there to keep my table maintained.  The greatest part of the night was when we got to meet Hubert Keller, the celeberity chef... and we were so lucky because he just happened to be there and hes usually not there all the time.  He handed us an autographed menu of all of the courses we had of the night with a rose.  :). 

I reccomend this place, especially now, because locals are able to get pretty good deals if you mention you are from Vegas.  Just mention your a local and the server should able to hook yo up.

Chef Keller arranged a special menu for my husband and me. We had no idea what we'd be eating that evening which I think is so much fun. We let Chef Keller have full creative control. We were treated to an 6 (or was it 8?) course meal which included wine pairing with each course.  Each bite was indescribably delicious.

I could barely even taste the truffle, might as well have been any other minced up mushroom. This was my first time having foie gras and I still feel I didn't get the best piece, it was mostly just fat tasting (like chicken fat or any other meat fat) and there was one tiny bite where I could taste a hint of liver flavor which was good. 

The meat patty itself literally tasted like average beef that anyone could cook up at home, not wagyu, not black angus, not anything. I truly felt insulted and I almost complained about it if I hadn't had a coupon to save a bit (which I purposely showed at the END of the meal so they had no way of knowing I had one earlier to maybe skimp on quality). Overall NOT worth $70 for this burger, not worth even half that much. My boyfriend had a hanger steak which I tasted and his was good quality as expected, the garlic fries that came with it were some of the best I've ever had though, that's what saved this place from 1 star.

One thing that also bugged me a bit was that the average drink glasses were the smallest I've ever seen, it was literally for a child, all I had was soda and had to wait to get multiple refills because of the tiny size.

We decided not to go with the prix fixe because the dishes weren't as appealing to us as those on the regular menu and desserts are usually wasted on us--we really prefer savory items.  At $180/couple, it is a reasonable price, but we just wanted to sample other items.

The selections were fantastic--we chose 8 tapas (each selection is generally shareable between 2-3 people, with a couple of bites per person) and were completely full after the meal.  With a $45 bottle of wine, the meal came to around $175, which was a steal.

Our absolute favorite were the tuna tacos--the plate comes with three delicious petite crunchy tacos that combine perfectly with a raw piece of beautiful tuna, serrano, avocado cream, and cilantro.  One of the most well-balanced dishes I've had in awhile in terms of flavor and texture.  I could eat this every day.

Other recommendations include the steak tartar, cod fritters, sliders, mussels, and duck, all of which were mouth-wateringly delicious.  Would easily order again.  

The lobster mac and cheese and veal ravioli were both okay--would probably not order again.

Slight dings: We could hear the pounding bass music from one of the clubs at Mandalay Bay, but it's Vegas, so what do you expect.  Also, we had to wait about 15 minutes past our reservation time for the table, but quickly passed the time in the casino, so no big deal.

But, if you have the money to spend, this would definitely be a great place to spend it.  There are so many other restaurants that are simply PRICY but disappointing, and this place definitely exceeded my expectations.

The prix fixe tasting menu is fantastic (generous portions) and the wine pairing is a reasonable price (the sommelier pours generously!)  

I absolutely love the generous amount of black truffles with the filet mignon entree.  Some places add expensive ingredients for the sake of doing so, but for the truffles really complemented the filet.  We added foie gras on top of the filet and the taste of the foie gras penetrated the beef, making the meat even more flavorful and delicious.  It was perfectly seasoned.  The foie gras was delicious too.

The scallops were absolutely the best we'd ever had.  It was done perfectly.  Some places over cook scallops which makes it dry and chewy; this was seared perfectly on the outside, with enough bite, but not overly done, so that the inside stays moist, and the scallop stays plump and tender.  It was seasoned perfectly as well.  

The short ribs are a bit too salty and although it was really tender and juicy, it did not wow me.  

The entire plate of chocolate desserts - chocolate tart, chocolate sorbet, etc. was chocolate OVERKILL.  I LOVE chocolate, but for some reason, this dessert really was a bit overwhelming for me.

I got the $50.10 menu.  It came with the  truffle onion soup.  When it first came out I was like... I only see a red onion streak with some rolled duck thing and then they poured on the truffle onion soup.  It was excellent!! So light with and creamy mixed with black truffle oil.  Skirt steak with chimchurri sauce with heirloom tomatoes and mini baked potatoes with creme fraiche was next.  I loved the cute mini baked potatoes.  They were sooo cuute and reminded me of sour cream and chive potatoes.  The steak was cooked to my liking of medium well.

My jaw dropped when it came to the chocolate souffle.  Sooo poofy and looked so good covered in powdered sugar.  Then they said the magic words, ""now we're gonna put some chocolate ganache in the middle.."" I felt like I had died and gone to heaven especially since my friend had decided to give me his partial moscato wine pairing to me since it was too sweet for him.  OMG, so fluffy and oozing with chocolatey goodness.  The ganache was the right consistency as well.  And... it came with a side of mocha ice cream!!

I gave them a 5 star also for their attention to detail.  I was wondering why one of my friends had gotten a black napkin and we had gotten the white ones.  It turns out the waitress noticed that my black napkin friend was wearing a black outfit so to avoid having white napkin lint on her black dress, they gave her a black napkin.  Who'da thunk?

Tip1: Do yourself a favor and make a reservation whenever possible... at ANY restaurant in Vegas.. saves you a headache
Tip 2: If you are in a party of 4 or more, order a bottle of wine.. I suggest the house Malbec, its divine, will cost about 80$ rather than 25-30 per glass
Tip 3: If you are calorie counting and anti-meat and/or not willing to splurge a bit... not the best place for you. The food is rich and delicious. I commend the Saucier.. the lyonnaise sauce on my skirt steak was a beautiful dark amber with perfect thickness... to those of you reading this .. imagine the most delicate gravy in texture but full of robust flavors from onions, stock, and wine all presented to you on a perfect medium rare skirt steak... heaven people.. its heaven on a plate

This restaurant has wonderful service, Dragana waited on us and was wonderful and had informed suggestions. 

We ordered Braised Beef Short Rib, Skirt Steak, & Osso Bucco.. and Tip 4: do yourself the courtesy of ordering grilled baugettes with the Osso Bucco... delicious.

Now portions are good.. and considering the fine dining spectrum they can be thought of as generous... but many people go to Vegas wanting a tomahawk ribeye at basement sale prices.. if you want that.. dine elsewhere. Here you will leave full and the quality of the food is stellar. Well worth your dollars.

I will definitely be back again.. the braised beef cheeks are calling my name as well as the charred octopus appetizer.

NOW
There is a NEW SOUP. 
Mexican street corn soup.
It is indescribable. 
If someone spilled a bowl of this soup on the floor of a New York City subway, I would lick it off the floor.
It wouldn't even have to be the last bowl on earth. Like, if we were together in the subway, and it was you who dropped your soup on the floor and I was still holding mine safe and sound, yes, I would still eat yours off the floor.

We love food, love the presentation, and overall experience- but there are still some things that we just won't eat.  So, this Chef's Experience was perfect!! The Chef comes out to your table and discusses your likes, dislikes, allergies, background, travels and experiences.  The chef then creates a five-course meal around everything you just shared with him.  Each course was a surprise and of course it was decadent and delicious.   Course One- Ahi Tacos  and Shrimp Ceviche served over avocado, pico de gallo and a cucumber gazpacho.  Course Two - Onion and Truffle Soup Shooter and Crab Cake with fresh mandarin slaw.   Course Three- Lupe de Mer (Mediterranean Sea Bass with a crispy skin, served in a beurre blanc butter with artichoke hearts, tomatoes, cerrano chiles and olives)- This was the best fish dish I have EVER had in my life- it literally made my cheeks tingle. Course Four - Skirt Steak with a three dipping sauces, potato puree with truffle jus and sauteed wild mushrooms. Course Five  - Brownie Pops, brownie, chocolate mousse, coated in dark chocolate and rolled in cocoa nibs and Creme Brulee with fresh berries.   Chef Alex came out at Course Three to present and to check on experience and he came back at the end of the meal for our feedback.  We raved of course and he allowed us to take our picture with him.  He was so personable and so open to our feedback.  The whole experience was outstanding.  During the evening our server was incredibly friendly and talked with us about all of the things to do in Vegas.  The manager stopped by to check in with us and the other manager (Brad Weinstein) took a pic with his phone (my flash wasn't working) and messaged it to me immediately.  He then chatted with us for quite a while - he made us feel so familiar and welcomed.  This entire group is second to none!  Some restaurants have airs (sometimes airs they do not deserve) but the welcoming staff made this ethereal experience unforgettable.  I can not say enough how much anyone who loves food should try this!!! The cost of the dinner was roughly $100 per person.  If you want a wine pairing it would be about $60 per person.

I went to Fleur during a tradeshow, and of course it was packed. Thankfully, there was seating at the bar, so I decided to eat there.

I ordered a Ginger Ale and their specialty recommended Lamb Burger with fries.

After finishing the Ginger Ale, the bartender notified me that refills cost the full amount. I'm sorry, you said what? The glass was literally a 4 ounce after ice was filled to the top and you expect me to pay $4.50 for another soda? No thanks, water it is.

The main course was good, but nothing that really made my taste buds excited. The burger was a little overcooked for a Medium Rare, and the fries were obviously frozen  (note: I've had these exact same fries at none other than TASTY GARDEN IN SAN GABRIEL VALLEY). When I saw them I was shocked. I expect it out of a HK style diner, not from a 4 star vegas restaurant with a renown chef like Keller himself.

I decided to give my try at the desert and had the Pineapple Panna Cotta. The textures were just right, and the smooth creaminess of the Panna Cotta really showed. It was an excellent overall dessert but unfortunately dampened by the poor meal overall.

Considering my bill was over $50 for just these three items, I highly doubt I'd ever come back here again, but it was worth trying.",yLU1gR-o94JtKm5U5MW1sg,1,0,2,NkeXfhzGVERVgEw__nE8ZQ

Hubby and I dined here in the lounge tapas style for one of our honeymoon dinners, and boy oh boy, were we gluttonous! We ordered the tapas menu (including dessert) for $115, and it was amazing. The lounge is very comfy and inviting, with low lighting and pillows all over. I was nervous that hubby wouldn't eat anything here (he's very ""meat and potatoes""), but I asked him to trust me, and he was glad he did!
The truffled onion soup and the chacuterie plate for two were simply out of this world, and I am not one to eat these kinds of foods. The manchego mixed green salad was the best salad I've ever tasted, hands down. The truffle buttered popcorn was good, but was a little bit soggy. The rock shrimp noodle salad was very tasty, albeit a tad spicy, and the ahi tuna tartare, eh. I'm not a big tartare eater, so it didn't do much for me. The sliders were slightly too greasy. The mini ham and cheese was sinfully good, and to me, the highlight of the night. My husband loved the chimichuri steak, and the waitress was kind enough to give us two since they were out of the fish sticks.  The weinerschnitzel was ok, too greasy for my taste. I can't remember the other tapas, so forgive me.
The desserts were OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! We had a mix of five fresh fruit sorbets, a lemon angelfood cake with blackberry sorbet, banana cake served over fresh coconut tapioca pudding, a carribean float, and fresh ice cream (avoid the lavender lemongrass one like the plague. It tasted like someone froze a bath and body works lotion and served it up on a plate), and a cheese platter. Simply divine dessert.
The highlight of the night was realizing that Hubert Keller was hanging out in the lounge at the table next to us, discussing design ideas for the renovations. He was super nice, and talked to us for a little bit after he finished his meeting.

The first table we were sat at was sandwiched between a server terminal and a table that was cackling about challah bread.  I asked to be moved.  We were upgraded to a really cozy corner table that was surrounded by curtains.

I had a glass of rose champagne which was yummy.  The BF opted for the Brancot Sauvignon blanc (a good one).

We both chose to get the 4 course menu.  Most of it was good, definitely some dishes more interesting than others.  We both enjoyed the limitless bread assortment.

My BF started with the truffled onion soup and I ordered the tartare.  We had higher expectations for the soup.  My tartare had nice flavor.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous, and the service is impeccable. Their bartender makes fantastic drinks, and the wine selection is excellent.

It was the food that bothered me:

The appetizer was a risotto with scallion, lemon and basil - the risotto was very nicely prepared, but it was nothing mind-blowing.

For the mains, we had a choice between braised short ribs with honey, coriander, glazed carrot and warm potato salad, or chicken breast with wild mushrooms and cabbage fricassee. I opted for the latter, which I regret. The chicken was dry and mostly tasteless. The wild mushroom and cabbage fricassee was actually quite tasty, but was not enough to make up for the lackluster chicken. I had a sampling of the short rib, and while nothing special, it was certainly better than the chicken.

The dessert was some form of chocolatey balls on a stick, but I don't have much of a recollection, as the evening got pretty hazy, and the dessert changed from what was originally sent to us. It was good, but again, nothing mind-blowing.

The coffee at the end was served lukewarm, and this was noticed by everyone who ordered espresso. That was entirely unacceptable, but we had to get going, and I didn't have time to replace it.

Other than the fantastic service, I can't say I was convinced of the food quality, though I'd like to check it out and order off the actual menu, rather than a two-choice cookie-cutter group menu.",NtCaWVg6MU1jikn6FKHp4w,0,0,3,BBjwdVABS5RvD0-rxc-aGg

That aside, the tartare was excellent, better than Tao's (I thought), though, in all fairness, it was served differently, more naked.

Fleur offers a rather casual setting but still maintains an element of class. It is situated adjacent to the casino floor at Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino. We arrived early and were thankful to be seated almost an hour before our reservation as a result. Our server Joe welcomed us with two menus...one Tastes from Around the World 2016 Tasting Menu and an A La Carte Dinner Menu. We decided on the first choice and added the suggested wine pairing at $55 per person.

Food was exciting and succulent throughout the 5 courses. In addition to the wine pairing, each course came with 2 food items plentiful enough for the two of us to share...in fact by the end of the 4th course, we couldn't even finish the 5 course of sweets...and dessert wines.

Since the restaurant is located next to the casino floor, there is heavy foot traffic and lively music playing just 20 steps away from the entrance to Fleur, providing a less than ideal environment, even at the back of the restaurant...after all, you know all of your 6 senses need to work together to make for an amazing experience...this was almost reason enough to drop another star for me.

the onion soup was very delightful. i did enjoy the amuse bouche before that. i had the braised short ribs for my entree and omg it was amazing. it was like velvet in your mouth. the meat just melts in your mouth. and every course had a wine pairing wc was awesome. the chocolate dessert was alright. nothing crazy but was still good. 

the service was fantastic. our server was really accomodating and personable. she explained everything and even wrote down the names of the wines for me to check out.

3019834,2012-01-17,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"On a day trip to Vegas we were all set for some French food. A short Google search later Fleur by Hubert Keller was agreed upon. The fault goes to us for not doing the research well enough, but it should be shared by whomever is promoting this restaurant and placing it under the French categories. The only thing French about it were the names of the dishes and the amount of Absinthe on the menu. 

For the sake of this review, let's forget that fact completely. 

We were recommended the Tuna Tacos - the Tuna ""mini"" Tacos. A complete throw away item on the menu. There was nothing special or delicate about it. Not even the tuna itself. As a matter of fact, the slice of jalapeno atop the taco completely killed my pallet. I am no stranger to spicy food, as a matter of fact I like it, but this miniature dish was extremely out of balance.

Other dishes included, the Ceviche, Mac and Cheese and the most French sounding item, Vegetable Bouillabaisse. The bouillabaisse turned out to be the best thing on the menu, Perfectly seasoned, very well balanced and satisfying. I would have been very happy with a giant bowl of this soup and nothing else. Who knew, right?

The Lobster Mac & Cheese had nothing new or even above average to offer. The lobster pieces were a bit chewy as well. The Ceviche has some guacamole on the bottom of the serving glass which you probably should mix in with the rest of the dish, but there was no instruction from the waiter. I know, I know. ""Shouldn't you know how to eat ceviche by now?"" You may ask. Well, I do and I should, but when there is an idea as to how to enjoy a specific item in the chef's eye, then it is the job of the waiter to convey that. That's my opinion and I'm sticking to it. 

Overall the meal was pretty mediocre. I expected a lot more Hubert Keller amd for the money spent.

We also had a Pot de Creme dessert, which was good, but nothing to write home about aside from a gold leaf a top the cream.

We both started off with the Truffled Onion Soup with braised duck crepe and onion/balsamic puree.  The soup was frothy but hearty and satisfying, a solid first course.

For the next course, I had the Gently Heated Alaskan King Salmon in a chive bouillon.  This salmon was cooked perfectly, it was slightly rare in the center and perfectly seasoned.  The chive bouillon and baby carrots/turnips were integrated nicely.  My wife had the stout braised beef short ribs with leek fondue, whole grain mustard and cornichons.  I had a few bites of this and even though it was a meat and potatoes dish, I was impressed with the quality.

For dessert, my wife ordered the grand-marnier souffle and I had the celebration of chocolate.  The celebration of chocolate included 3 small dessert portions of bailey's gelato, chocolate cake, and peanut butter milkshake.  Needless to say dessert was excellent.

I took my girlfriend to Fleur de Lys for Valentine's Day and we had a very good experience, one that is as good as most any other high end restaurant I've been to in Vegas.  I wouldn't consider myself a high-end foodie, so for me to discern subtle differences in food quality between one high-end restaurant versus another that both serve comparable food is difficult.  But I can comment on the experience overall.  And in short, except for one particular aspect of Fleur de Lys, I would say that it is pretty standard LV high-end, without much else to necessarily distinguish the restaurant from other high-quality, high-end Vegas dining experiences.

The food, high end French, is pretty standard for LV restaurants in its class - tasty, dainty, and expensive - though I would not say that it's disproportionately better or worse than other comparable restaurants..  When we ate there, the service was very competent and I had no issues.  The restaurant's decor was lovely, but doesn't  necessarily stand out in any way.  The restaurant is conveniently located in the casino, relatively close to access from the taxi stand/parking garage.  

What's special about Fleur de Lys that other restaurants don't have are private cabana style booths which can have translucent curtains drawn.  If you're looking for a romantic, high-end experience, this is a particular trait that I don't know of any other restaurants in LV having.  I would strongly recommend it if this is the kind of experience that you are seeking.  

In business school, I once read an article that suggested that for every business, there really was only one core question that needed to be answered in any marketing research - would you recommend this business to your friends?  As far as Fleur de Lys goes, the answer for me is ""yes.""",mP8n6b42hcI8mLLGuR9u-A,2,0,4,44KRHIwoidiBz8i_trg21g

Food was delicious, Fleur offers tapas style as well as entrees. From French, Spanish, American there is something for everyone.

Starters: 
*Tapas from Spain: grilled octopus with potatoes
*White onion truffle soup*** I definitely recommend this 
*Arugula Salad: way too salty and very plain 
*Bread basket: they charge $1.25 for two pieces of bread, good but not worth the charge. I feel like bread should be free especially at a fancy place like this.

Entrée:
*Roasted chicken: a bit salty
*Braised short rib with mashed potatoes (so tender and juicy) 

Dessert:
Since it was my birthday, the server was nice enough to give me a complementary cupcake, that was a nice touch 
*Pistachio/ Coffee creme brûlée: good finish to whole experience not overly sweet  

Drinks: specialty cocktails some type of mijito and a cosmo

Unfortunately, we both left the experience wishing that we had gone somewhere else. Here are the main ups and downs of our dinner:

+ Extremely attentive, knowledgeable, overall exceptional wait service

+ Some of the dishes were incredibly good, with standout favorites being the beef carpaccio, onion soup, oxtail gnocchi, and shrimp tamale

+ The wine was fantastic 


- We made the mistake of ordering the Mini Tour, thinking that the small plates would be, well, small. There were 5 courses, including dessert, each composed of two dishes. However, the portion sizes were quite large, which I do suppose is typical for Las Vegas and a good deal for the cost. But even coming to the restaurant hungry, it became difficult to continue eating the food after the second course. By the time the 4th course came, I was actually dreading the prospect of having to eat more food. I was unhappy to think we might be upsetting the chef by not clearing our plates and felt bad for being wasteful. If you are looking to order the small plates, I recommend picking and choosing off of the menu and not ordering the Mini Tour. I almost think it would be better suited to a group of more than 2 people.

- I was not impressed by some of the dishes, unfortunately. I found the octopus and onion tarte to be extremely greasy, which kind of ruined the dish for me.

What the F$#@?!  Why mess with a good thing?!?!  

Fleur de Lys was one of my favorite Vegas restaurants.  A gf and I came to Fleur expecting a similar experience with similar quality. 

Where to start?  The decor is similar to Fleur de Lys except they removed the thick drapes which now means you're dining with a loud view of what's outside the restaurant. The wall of roses is gone. And they've put up a tacky painting of a big breasted blonde Barbie woman on the back wall.  Distracting.

Service was mediocre at best. There were only a few waiters (who never introduced themselves).  Service at Fleur de Lys was a hundred times better. 

And of course, the food.  We ordered 5 dishes, which included one entree. Lobster Mac and cheese (okay, but nothing like what amazing taste you'd expect with the combo). 
Manchego salad (really arugula but where's the manchego??).  
Chicken croquettes (tasteless, almost like fish sticks).  
Skirt steak with chimichurri (bland, my husband makes better chimichurri!).  
Branzino with a chorizo risotto (risotto was okay, but Wynn buffet's risotto was better).

Sure, you're a little nervous...you wonder what to wear--something sexy perhaps? or something classy and demure?

You try to show up on time and get a class of bubbly to make the night go a bit smoother. 

You're not sure how the evening will begin, but you have a pretty good idea of how you hope it will end. 

This my friends, is how my first $$$$ dining experience began at Fleur de Lys.

As the piece de resistance of my epic birthday weekend in Vegas, we took advantage of the restauarant week promotion to dine at Hubert Keller's famed restaurant. Being that I was with a group of yelpers, this is not surprising in the least.

They were a bit late with our reservations which resulted in complementary champagne for all. An excellent start to the evening.
The restaurant is small, dimly lit, and quiet. We were seated in an alcove, so it was nice to have our own little space for our group.

The service was impeccable, which is something that is to be expected when dining at establishments such as this but is not always delivered. The attention to detail was outstanding and truly enhanced the experience. 
   The bread selection was great, my favorites being the challah and the pretzel bread. The amuse bouche details escape me, but it was a miso cod and truly superb.

 I went with the $50.09 prix fixe menu that consisted of the following:

-Truffled Onion Soup with Duck: the soup was creamy and not too rich. It had a wonderful earthy flavor due to the truffles and was expertly seasoned. One of my dining companions had never had truffles before, so this was his first experience and he loved it. Three of us were actually tempted to lick the bowl, but we knew better...

-Chimichurri flank steak with mini baked potatoes: flank steak is not my favorite cut of beef by any means, but it was cooked well and pre-cut. The chimichurri added a burst of freshness and lightness to the dish. The crispy mini baked potatoes were topped with creme fraiche and perfectly cooked. 

-Trio of Desserts--Molten Chocolate banana cake, peanut butter shake, Bailey's ice cream: I was a little worried about the banana component in the cake because I'm not a fan of that combination, but the cake was outstanding. Moist cake and warm, rich dark chocolate sauce oozing out of the middle with a hint of banana flavor? What's not to love? The peanut butter shake was very pronounced in flavor and a cute concept. The Bailey's ice cream made a great complement to the cake. I thought all three were fantastic, with the cake and ice cream combo being my favorite.

-Petite Fours: after the meal,  we were treated to a selection of petite fours including: passion fruit gelee, coconut marshmallow, French canele, pina colada French macaroon. They were all simple and yet very delicious...it's too bad we were all so full from the meal to fully appreciate them.

A three hour dining experience with a fantastic group of friends is a great way to end an amazing weekend in Vegas.

Here are some of the ""firsts"" that happened here:
-first time trying truffles for Nick
-first time trying foie gras--courtesy of Libby and Fel who ordered it (Nick, Keisha, William, me)

Weekday night allowed us to walk into Fleur without a reservation.  We are glad that we did.   We have stayed at Mandalay Bay many times, but this was our first venture into Fleur.  We had a choice of seating, on the patio for people watching or inside the main restaurant.  I chose inside because one of my Las Vegas resort irritations is spending premium money for a meal and feeling like I'm dining on a casino floor.  The restaurant was well decorated.  The table was a bit small once loaded with plates, drinks  and sides.   Most people were neatly dressed, but not as dressy as seen in some top tier resturants.   

Despite a menu filled with tempting small plate offerings, we went with big plate selections.    Filet for my wife, a 12 oz New York steak for me.   We split an order of citrus braised asparagus.   The steaks were wonderful.  In fact, the entire meal was every bit as good as many more expensive experiences that we have had at many of the ""marquee"" Strip restaurants.   

Steaks, drinks, dinner salads, a shared desert and a couple coffees cost us about $80 less than a comparable dinner at Sinatra in the Encore.    And the food was better at Fleur.   We get to Las Vegas a few times a year.   Next time, I'm trying the yummy looking small plates.",Tr1A93r_-k4_KNItcMHAJw,0,0,4,1ma1CJwuz0BCXMKx4UoAsw

We sat out on the ""patio"" of the restaurant (patio meaning it was along the indoor avenue of Mandalay Bay). Great people watching.

We sprang for some sparkling wine with our tapas, which was pricey but complimented our snacks. We enjoyed the marinated olives (pretty much what you would expect) and the burrata, which was excellent. I didn't want it to end. Lovely texture and flavor.

The waitress was a little snobby and didn't seem to stoked on our restaurant.com certificate but I don't really understand the attitude since the certificate stipulates that 18% gratuity will be added to the bill automatically. So, regardless of her concern over our ""cheapness,"" she would receive at least 18% gratuity.

And believe me, this isn't cheap! Bill was $72 without tip and gratuity and before our restaurant.com certificate.

And, just a small rant that isn't Fleur's fault: 

There was a small girl hanging on the short railing along the patio...inches away from our food. Staring at us, breathing on our food...and the parents said NOTHING! For about five minutes this goes on! Seriously, control your kid. Keep them away from people who are dining. It almost ruined the afternoon with my frustration over the lack of discipline and respect the parents had.

Bottom Line: Fleur is a nice spot for some people watching, tasty drinks, and delightful snacks...just watch out for inattentive parents...",cjPK-A7G66CNDzfdTw8bqg,2,1,4,I00AgfKlZE2WPuJHAwPidA
3150581,2009-10-02,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Without hesitation, this is one the best restaurants EVER!  Four or Five years ago, my husband and I were looking for a place to eat at Mandalay Bay after seeing Mama Mia. It was well after 9pm during the weekday and several of the nicer restaurants were near closing time. We walked past Fleur de Lys and looked at the menu posted on the glass. There was a $59 prix fixe menu that sounded perfect. They seated us without any problems being so close to closing time. The service was impeccable, the 4-course meal was amazing and Chef Keller really knows how to make a beautiful presentation out of his food. We never felt rushed through our meal even when it got past closing time. An Amazing Culinary experience!

I was so impressed with Fleur de Lys, the very next time I was in Vegas I made a reservation for my mother and I. She really appreciates food as much as I do, so I felt I would give her the gift of Incredible French Food! I remembered there being booths on the side of the restaurant that were very private, so I made our reservations for the booth. The 4-course was so good, I decided to pony-up and go for the 6-course for the both of us. And heck, let's just do the wine pairing as well!!! It's my Mom, nothing's too good for her! I would definitly recommend making reservations for the booth. You kind of feel like you're in your own world. After 6-courses of wine and 6-glasses of wine I officially felt Culinary Bliss! What an incredible display of food! Although it was a hit to the pocketbook, it was worth every penny! Top three meals of my life (so far)!",OD6wbZ1jQOW30wYCDD6X3Q,1,1,5,thAB6To-ck_A2NU-r7wL2g

I loved what Chef Hubert Keller did on Top Chef Masters, so I had to eat at his restaurant when I was in Las Vegas. The gf and I got the restaurant inside Mandalay Bay at the time of our reservation. We did wait for about 15 minutes before being seated. While waiting, I got a good glimpse of the interior of the restaurant. Imagine a 30-foot ceiling supported by walls of stacked white stones, curtains hanging organically from the ceiling to divide the space, dim lighting that is dark enough to be romantic but still light enough to enjoy your meal, and a centerpiece work of art on the wall made of 1,500 fresh roses refreshed everyday. Well if you can't quite imagine it, I still liked it anyway.

The 4 course elegance prix-fixe menu is a bit spendy at $89, but I think it's worth it. I had the ahi tuna tartare for the first course. It was very fresh and flavorful, but maybe a bit too salty. The Alaska king salmon was really tender, and it matched well with the julienned carrots and potatoes. The next course, which was my favorite, definitely stood out the most. Filet mignon with a red wine sauce over sauteed spinach and mushrooms. Perfection! By this time I was pretty full and I don't remember much about dessert. 

I do remember that the service was excellent, and the waitress was friendly and welcoming without asking ""how's everything?"" every five minutes. She gave us no trouble when my girlfriend didn't like the kir aperitif and poured her a new glass of wine without question.

What they don't tell you is you'd have to order a lot of tapas to make a meal. A steak was $105. That doesn't fit into the $$ range in my opinion.  We ended up ordering 2 Caesar salads at $16 a piece. And they were nothing special...Romaine lettuce and dressing. That's it!!!

My suggestion would be to make a reservation so you can sit inside otherwise you sit on the patio where people passing by gawk at you while you try to enjoy your meal. We did the small plate mini tour. I loved the service there, our waitress Kat, was so helpful and very nice, and your water glass is never empty and never has a chance to get warm, but the atmosphere (really wish I had made that reservation) and some of the food were mediocre at best and for the portions and the price it should all be great. The mini tour consisted of 10 dishes. Half of them were definitely as good as I expected, the other half were just so-so. The 5 really good ones were the ahi tacos (that tuna was fresh!), the carpaccio (this was my favorite, loaded with so much intense flavor), the scallop (it smelled really fishy so I was initially worried about how it would taste but it was great), the garlic fries, and the beignets that were just cooked and melt in your mouth. The ones I wasn't so crazy about, the white onion soup which shocked me because that's what all the yelp reviewers raved about. It must be about taste preference, I prefer savory and this reminded me of a sweet corn chowder. Next on the menu, the bone marrow which just seemed lacking in flavor as did the shrimp and grits, and the skirt steak lyonnaise which was a tough piece of meat, but since I have never had it before, who knows maybe that's the way it is supposed to be. The last dish I had mixed feelings about was the octopus. Since this was the first time I had octopus I think I need to have it one more time before I decide if I really like octopus or not. Overall this was a very fun experience going through these 10 dishes and deciding what you like. Next time I think I'd pick what looks good to me instead of going the mini tour route though. I debated  between the 3 or 4 stars, in the end since the food was 50/50, I went with the 4 stars because if I had ordered my own food it may have even been good enough to earn 5 stars, service goes a long way.",OA4qBwe_f-166YohzKhcmA,0,0,4,jVoQQa2TIjZLshyBkL13yA

My high recommendations: lobster salad, salmon entree (like butta! and as fresh tasting as I have ever had) and the braised beef. Opt for the wine pairings as the sommelier did a fantastic job with each entree. He even wrote down a list of the wines we had, which was very much appreciated. Their wine list is expansive and a bit overwhelming (in a good way).  Also, the service was impeccable - the wait staff were friendly and very attentive.

The Peking Duck came out and I was surprised how small it was. It was probably half a breast of duck, which isn't a lot and compared to the heaping portion of fries I received I was quite baffled. The sauce the duck was in was really good. Kind of sweet and tangy and went with the duck very nicely. The duck itself was cooked uneven. The middle of the piece I got was heavenly. Cooked perfectly. Pink in the middle with great tender texture. The ends however were rubbery and though flavorful for someone who is a texture eater it was a bit hard. With Peking Duck you expect delicious duck skin but instead I got flabby and rubbery skin. I was extremely disappointed and immediately felt like my $60 dinner was a misstep.

I went with two girlfriends for lunch to this glorious spot when we were out in Vegas for continuing education. (Have to give a shout out to my husband for the recommendation!) We waited a very short time for a table considering it was the busy lunch hour. When we were seated, our server came over promptly and began talking with us. I discussed Chef Keller with him and how excited I was to be eating there, to which he stated ""Would you like a picture with him? He is sitting right behind you.""

I said something to the effect of ""Shut the f**k up!!!!"" (not my proudest moment, but it shows you how excited I was that the word vomit just came pouring out). He smiled politely and said he would send him over in a little bit.

We began ordering, which was quite difficult since everything on the menu looked amazing!! I ordered the Cuban panini (might I add, so did Chef Keller...but I'm not a stalker or anything). This sandwich was PERFECT. The horseradish mustard gave it just the right kick, and I could feel it all through my sinuses. I also got the homemade gnocchi with pesto. Thank god for homemade gnocchi! These little balls of deliciousness were just the right texture and consistency. 

My friends ordered the Caesar salad, the Italian style meatballs with pasta fagioli soup underneath them. They also had the sliders and the tuna tacos. All of these items were delicious and perfectly seasoned. The tuna tacos were the standout item of what my friends ordered...they used very thin slices of tuna tartare, which gave just the right amount of flavor and texture against the crunchy taco shell. We also all shared the macaroni and cheese with lobster. I'm not a huge seafood fan, especially when it is mixed in to one of my favorite comfort foods, but the server recommended it and he was spot on. The only reason we didn't finish it is because we were too full from all our other items, plus...there was the matter of ordering dessert.

For those of you who know me, I am not a huge fan of dessert to begin with, but everything was so good I just had to have one more course. I ordered (are you ready for this???) my absolute hands down favorite dessert of all time! It was the coconut soup with passionfruit sorbet. Sounds weird, I know, but it was unbelievable! They had topped the runny coconut soup/tapioca mixture with cold passionfruit sorbet and crunchy dehydrated fruit. I can't say enough about it. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My friends had the panna cotta, which was good, and fairly standard. We also got a couple cheesecake lollies sent over from the table next to us (apparently, their family of 8 had eaten too much too). Wonderful and a very playful take on classic cheesecake.

Finally, Chef Keller came over to talk with us. We snapped a few photos, told him how delighted we were over meeting him and how much we enjoyed his meal, and then were off to enjoy more of our CE. Thank you Chef Keller!!!",7-BTm74b43TyLzV_WwQ9ag,3,4,5,S7_NHUVGGld7sXi7_xskYQ

We were promptly seated in the indoor faux-patio which is located in a really good spot for people watching. The inside area looked darker and more intimate but for brunch I enjoyed where we sat. 
Service was EXTREMELY fast I feel like our food was out in maybe five minutes. My fiancé got the beignets and I got the short rib Benedict, with endless mimosas of course. 
The short rib Benedict was on a potato cake with jalapeño hollandaise and red wine jus on the side. I think this was the best Benedict I've ever had, which is saying a lot as I've had an insane amount of Benedicts. 
My mimosa never reached the bottom and the server was always extremely polite. I've been to many places that have bottomless mimosas and I'll sit there with an empty glass for five to ten minutes, but not here. Fleur had excellent service.

At that time, I wrote a rave review here on Yelp.  I was looking forward to another fabulous meal when I made reservations to dine at Fleur last week.  I was disappointed.  The dining room was noisy from the opening to the casino and the loud music from the speakers.  There were only a handful of tables with diners when I arrived.  I was there on the fifth day of Fleur's new reformatting.  Perhaps the memory of my previous meal at Fleur dy Lys (which was one of my all time favorites) tarnished my view of the new Fleur, but even the dishes I ordered did not stand up to the quality that I experienced from Hubert Keller previously.  I started with a Ceaser salad that was so oily I only ate a few bites.  The presentation of the onion soup was fun, but the soup itself wasn't especially memorable.  The proportion of the pickled shitake to the braised hamachi was off.  It might've worked better with half the amount of mushrooms.  I enjoyed the mac & cheese served in a cast iron pot, which was inspired by the Top Chef Master's episode where Chef Keller strained the pasta in a dorm shower.

I got the chef's elegance menu; it was a 4 course taster. I started with the ahi tuna, served over fennel with a garlic ponzu. Tasty!

The next course was seabass wrapped in chorizo, served with a spicy tomato broth. This would have been incredible, but my seabass was overcooked. Had it been prepared properly, I probably would have been in food heaven. The taste combination was there, but it just didn't come out well.

The third course was filet. It was cooked a perfect medium rare, but I think they went a little bit too heavy on the sauce for it. Overall, though, great.

The last dish - dessert - total food boner. It was carrot cake, cream cheese frosting, and carrot/pineapple ice cream. PINEAPPLE AND CARROT ICE CREAM. As soon as I ate this, I could feel a gentle tapping on the underside of the table, my food boner. I could also feel an ominous rumbling in the pits of my stomach; a festering storm.

But I digress. The food was above average but not five star. The service was excellent from start to finish. The cute blonde hostess made me think dirty thoughts, preparing me to devour my meat courses.

But I digress. Ok. 4 stars. Worth trying once, wavering on whether or not I go back with all of the other fine dining options in this town.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,6,7,4,ImLqdmBHqXERZb0HlGCoKg

- Truffled Onion Soup - can you really screw up anything that has truffles in it.  D-lish!

- Tuna Tartare - very good, but forgettable

- Citrus Glazed Halibut - very tasty, one of the best fish dishes I have had in a while

- Dessert - a trio of ??? YUMMY!  I was so full, I couldn't finish it and I am still thinking about it!

My review is really more of a 3.5-star, but I'm rounding up because it is still better than a 3-star. I would have given it a 4.5-star review if it were not for the less-than stellar service.

The food was very good. We started with the tuna tacos. They were little bites of heaven. The ahi tuna was very fresh and all of the flavors combined worked perfectly. The portion size on this appetizer was very small, but it was not very expensive, so I give it a pass.

I also had the chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken breast was moist and the pesto and ancho sauce used as spreads made this sandwich very interesting. The fries were nice and crispy. 

The hubs had the HK Burger. It had a good taste, but it was dry. He ordered his burger medium, but they gave it to him essentially well-done.

The server was inattentive and cold. Frankly, everyone at this restaurant was. He never introduced himself and the first words out of his mouth were, ""so what do you want to order?"" He did not offer refills and really only came back to drop off the check. We expected service of a higher caliber at a Keller joint.

We ordered the tuna tacos, gazpacho, butternut squash risotto, onion soup and panna cotta.

Tuna tacos: Three mini, and I mean mini, tacos came beautifully plated with raw tuna on top. Crunchy and delectable. Would order again. 

Gazpacho: Smooth, fresh and seasoned beautifully. 

Butternut squash risotto: Do I dare say that the pieces of squash weren't fully cooked? Ok I said it. If the squash was perfectly cooked the dish would have been amazing! The flavors were spot on. 

Onion soup: The star of the night. Creamy with a hint of truffle oil. Just Devine. Definitely try it!

- grilled artichokes and baby yukon potatoes: I cannot believe this cost $14. I may have paid $1. 

I ordered the Vegetarian Chicken. HUGEEEE DISAPPOINTMENT. Worst meal in vegas. (2nd worst meal was at Keller's Burger Bar).

- 40 oz prime tomahawk rib chop was big, and good, but not great. 
- 8 oz hanger steak were meh. A couple of guys ordered them, and the only reason this isn't a 1 star experience is because one added foie gras and was on cloud nine. For him, Hubert, I'll give you a second yelp star.

I came here this past weekend for Caroline T.'s birthday. We decided to take her somewhere nice that served foie gras and luckily Fleur was in the hotel we were staying at. Of course we all came here after a full day of drinking/partying at Encore Beach so we were a bit hungover. Upon getting seated, we promptly asked for water and bread (to soak up the alcohol), but the waitress told me that they charged for bread which kind of put me in shock. Now, this isn't the cheap Asian in me coming out and not wanting to pay for it...but it was merely the principle of a fine dining establishment charging for bread. We had 6 girls in our group and they wouldn't even give the birthday girl one piece of bread, but we ordered it for her anyway. When she asked for a second piece they told her they were going to charge her for the second piece as well. I'm sorry, but that was just kind of left a bad taste in my mouth about this restaurant. 

Anyway, moving along to the food I can honestly say I only loved two of the items from my whole meal (seared foie gras & creme brulee). The seared foie gras was amazing and I enjoyed the pineapple pairing it had with it, however, I wasnt a huge fan of the shitake mushrooms. It was no biggie since I just pushed that aside and only devoured the foie gras and pineapple bits. I also had the croque monsieur, which upon the first few bites was good but got tiring really fast. I also had the ceviche and duck confit which were both delicious, but nothing that blew me away. My friends all ordered different things on the menu and no one loved what they got. The only dish that we all had a consensus of truly enjoying was the seared foie gras. One friend got the bone-in ribeye and was so unimpressed she only ate half of it. She said it was comparable to her mom's home cooked steak, and although her mom is a good cook, I would expect more from a fine dining establishment. My second favorite dish of my meal was the creme brulee. It came out on a long thin rectangular plate, which made for the perfect custard base and burnt caramel ratio. The birthday girl got the Grand Mariner Souffle which was also delicious, but I have had better before like at Le Papilion.

All in all, I would probably try to find a better place in Vegas if you want a mind blowing dining experience. Sorry Fleur...but you need to step up your game.",h9VHsfMeP3PAO_T9Zbw4lA,1,1,3,ozS4UZjHKRwk3jI0AGlRKA

The website is no help to get an overview of prices. Well, it's just as expensive as any upscale restaurant with entrees starting at $49. The ambiance is lovely but I wasn't overly impressed, (like at Hank's where the chandaliers and glassed fire mesmerizes you.) I selected the Top Chef Master's menu, with the Lobster soup, Filet Mignon, and assortment of desserts. The portions are small but while you're waiting they bring an assortment of great (though not warm or soft) bread to enjoy. The Kobe I received with the Filet was to DIE for!!! I'd say that made my whole meal. I didn't order any alcohol or wine with dinner as I discovered the markup is astronomically insulting. If you don't order alcohol, you'll save hundreds of dollars. Save it for after dinner at one of the hundreds of bars scattered throughout the Strip! The service was attentive and they were all very knowledgable. 

If you're thinking about getting the cabana for the extra $150...don't. If it were outside or with an amazing view of something it would be worth it. But we laughed when we saw its really only a glorified booth with a giant mirror and curtains. However it would be more ideal to accomodate a party larger than 6 as the restaurant tables seem only to fit a maximum of 6 people.

* Wagyu burger - can we just call a time-out on the Kobe burgers? I'm officially over this over-priced, over-hyped menu item.

Should have asked for medium rare, but shouldn't an attentive waiter gently corrected my husband when he asked for it medium? They have in the past.

The ahi tuna tacos were good - but so small.  So, so small.  

We got one of the flatbread pizzas - I think this was one of the better things on the menu though honestly, I like the flatbread better at Seasons 52.

A welcoming lounge area done in a rich brown palette invites you to sink into the leather seats and have a cocktail or two.  If you're just passing time, have a late dinner reservation or just want a light meal, Fleur de Lys has the perfect happy hour. 

Technically speaking, happy hour and a half.  From Wed-Sun, happy hour is from 5:00 - 6:30 pm.   Two for one cocktails and complimentary appetizer. Such recessionista offers are too irresistible to pass up!

Cocktails which are regularly priced at $15, become a bargain at $7.50 during happy hour.   We had the mojito (made with Monte Cristo rum, Yuzu Juice, Shiso which is equivalent to Japanese mint) and blood orange margarita (Lunazul reposado tequila and blood orange juice)  Loved my 'Rita, but the mojito didn't quite come together for me.   

The complimentary appetizer of the day was the parmesan-paprika popcorn.   It's light, crunchy, salty, yummy.  Your hands will automatically be dipping into the popcorn bowl without you realizing it. 

The $4 onion shooters , which come in 4 shots, are definitely worth a try.  Creamy onion soup drizzled with truffle oil.  You'll wish it came in a full size bowl. 

Our charcutrie board for two, appropriately priced at $14, came with quality meats such as prosciutto and various salumi, olives, cornichons, sliced baguettes, sliced picked onions and spicy whole-grain mustard.  This is a pleasing alternative to the usual cheese plate. 

Our server was attentive and nice.  He even gave my bf a complimentary guava caipirinha! It's not a manly drink, but we basically got 3 cocktails for the price of 1.  How awesome is that?  

Pretty awesome really. And that is all.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,24,22,4,qOGcSlGEef3wEsZjdrMrRw

I had a braised veal shank and my wife had smoked scallops with pork belly and truffle. Both were exceptional. The broth should come in cans and be sold as an antidepressant. It is that good. The veal was perfectly tender and came with a delicious polenta. My only complaint was that they did not have a marrow spoon to get to what was undoubtedly one of the best parts of the dish. But in a pinch the back of an espresso spoon did the trick.  
My wife's scallops were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful smoky flavor. The Bork belly or ""super bacon"" as my wife called it was great and needed only be used sparingly so as not to overpower the scallops. 

Lupe the Executive Chef came out near the end of our meal and we called him over to thank him for the meal. We talked for several minutes about his philosophy on cooking and chatted about this and that.

I have a ""secret"" love for the grey pony-tailed man who owns this place and cannot lie that it was a big reasoning behind my wanting to visit Fleur de Lys (on top of it being in my hotel). My friend ordered the full tasting menu with wine pairings. I, not feeling 100%, decided I didn't need four courses and four glasses of wine (don't judge me). The friend loved the food and was particularly pleased with the pairings prepared by the house sommelier. In particular, he absolutely loved the citrus glazed halibut, the stout braised short ribs and the fleur de lys souffle. I also have to say the first dish, the tuna tartar, was full out awesome but he said the pairing wasn't as well thought out and so fell by the wayside in the ranking. I also had the stout braised short rib and although a bit overly heavy (again, not feeling 100% so that might have something to do with it) it was beautiful. The meat flaked off the bone the way it should and the purees of carrot and parsnip were phenomenal. However, the hands down highlight was obviously the fleur de lys souffle. It was HUGE and so perfectly fluffy without being too eggy and the fleur de lys ice cream that came alongside was divine. I probably will not revisit Fleur de Lys but that's less about the food and more about the abundance of options and the less than stellar overall experience of the place.

We have been to France , North and South, quite a few times and never had a bad meal..
The french are famous for ""fabulousness"".. fabulous foods, parfums, wines and champagne, style, fashion..ect...
Hubert Keller ,""Fleur""  being featured on the Travel Chanel ""Forbes one of most extravagant meals"" The only claim to fame on this menu is the $5000.00 for a Wagyu beef burger with foie gras which comes paired by a bottle of 1995 Chateu Petrus...other than that I was quite disappointed with this menu.. 
The Chef is french so we were expecting a french menu but instead there is a mixture of all kinds of cuisines, from central , south america, italian, greek, japanese... The only French dishes on the menu were a croc Monsieur, truffle onion soup shooters, a seared foie gras and a couple of flambees and souffles.
 We did not like the decor., again the french do everything rich and grand however ,this restaurant is decorated resembleling a cabin in the woods, a very ""Plain and simple"" cabin like, not your typical French glamour . The menu consists of  small plates and regular size dishes .. We ordered from the small plates the tuna tacos , ceviche, spicy shrimp casserole, smoked bacon flat bread, and truffle onion soup-shooter  and the seared foie gras. and the Fleur burger with all its fixings...minus the bottle of wine and save $4,935.00
The service was good, however all the dishes were lacking presentation.. The ceviche was fatty..they took it back and brought us the croc monsieur.
 The only stand out dishes were the Fleur Burger, the seared foie gras, the soup shooters and the flat bread... 
 Overall..We had high expectations but they were not met... I wouldn't come back or recommend this restaurant .. Instead for a memorable dinning experience go to the Bellagio and have dinner at any of their restaurants "" Michael Mina"" , ""Le Cirque""  and ""Picasso""  ..or right across from the Bellagio....""Alain Ducasses's""  at the Eiffle Tower..",-i71RmZVsg5HsmZmfEC5jw,1,0,2,MTJmVZI4IESPP4bqe-Bt2Q

Two of us had the Chef's Prix Fixe ($90), and other two had the Lion King Prix Fixe($55).  I was lucky enough to have a taste of both menus (actually I ate half of what my gf couldn't finish. Win win right?) so I will list them out.

Complimentary appetizer: Some kind of fried cod.  It was very small...although free.  Tasty!
Truffled Onion Soup: Absolutely delicious.  The braised duck was a nice touch to the soup.  I wish there was more black truffle in there, but that's my greedy side talking.
Ahi Tuna Tartare: WOW. One of the most delicious tuna tartares I've ever had.  Just the perfect amount of ponzu (with some ginger I think) with fennel. what flavor!
Alaskan Salmon: Cooked nicely.  It was tasty... maybe a little too many chives.  Kind of overpowered the dish.
Braised Short Ribs: Cooked to perfection.  The short ribs didn't even need to be cut with a knife.  The guiness reduction was a nice touch.  Didn't care too much for the mustard with mustard seeds.
Filet Mignon: Perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare).  A beautiful piece of meat here.  The wine reduction sauce was spot on.  The mash potatoes were a little too buttery and creamy.  Almost didn't taste like potatoes.
Complimentary Dessert: Passion fruit sorbet with coconut tapioca + fruits.  WOW. My eyes totally lit up when I tasted this one.  It's refreshing and delicious.  They need to put this on their regular menu!
Chocolate souffle: Very good.  
Grand Marnier Souffle: Tasty.  I liked this one a lot more than the chocolate souffle.
Complimentary tea snacks: Assorted hard cookie's and candy drops.  I didn't care for it but I felt like VIP after this 3rd complimentary dish.

The inner decor was very chic.  I would have preferred maybe some jazz or slow jazz over the monotone beats they were playing.  Made me kind of sleepy waiting for the food.  Service was excellent.

Really, the food was 5+ stars, it was the service that knocked it down.  First we went on thanksgiving with a reservation and the place was pretty much empty.  Maybe 5 other tables in the whole restaurant.  So we were seated right away and about 15 minutes pass with no water or anyone coming to our table.  After walking that strip you know I was thirsty!  So I went up the the hostess and just said that we had not been served water or seen anyone yet.  She was very nice and said she would send someone over.  Right away someone came with water and told us our server would be right with us....another 15 minutes pass and we are getting ready to get up to leave.  As we are doing so our waiter came over and asked us what we wanted to drink.  He was very rude, and it seems like he was upset to have been assigned our table.  Anyway the rest of the service carried on like this, he was not friendly and just kept asking what we wanted.  But never mind that onto the food!
We started with the oysters and duck confit.  The duck confit was the star of the dinner!  THe truffle infusers were really neat!  The disk was just delicious.  The oysters were also very good, the flavors were very different with margaritta and orange but a great combination.   Next we had the lobster mac n cheese.  It was also very good, and the portion size was large.  Finally we finished with the brie and bacon flambe with apples and honey.  Great way to end the meal as it was almost like dessert!

I was really underwhelmed with the food.  The best turned out to be the least expensive - the onion veloute shooters.  At $6, I should have ordered 6 of them and I would have been so much happier - creamy, tasty and fragrantly truffle-oiled.

Instead, here's what I ordered:

Crab and avocado sphere - not terribly different from a california roll, but a lot less filling.  Somewhat refreshing with the watermelon puree.

Tuna tacos - fresh, red tuna but completely boring.  Really, cilantro and a slice of jalapeno? Where's the creativity, people?  We didn't get any kind of foam on it.

Lobster mac n' cheese - mini-ramekin sized, but I enjoyed it.  Pasta was a bit overcooked, decent chunks of lobster.

Foie gras mousse with huckleberry gelee - this was not a mousse.  It wasn't even a pate, it was more of a hard cold butter consistency.  Together with the huckleberry gelee, it was reminiscent of a bad peanut butter jelly pairing.  

Also, it's a casual, noisy space - on the unfortunate night I was there, we could hear the wailings of bad karaoke going on in the casino floor.",N4_3LzKYZcLIBBjg2-0SAw,0,0,2,qvns66B7OyoC5GHFXE_aHQ

Truffled Onion Soup or Braised Veal and Yukon Gold Ravioli

Seared Skirtsteak or Citrus Glazed Monkfish

Molten Chocolate Cake

It was kinda like going on a first date.  You get a little bit of everything, but not enough to scare you away.  Before you had to ask too many questions, the servers came and told you exactly what you were having, leaving some things to the imagination.

the service was the best i have ever had.  after every course, we got different utensils...the servers were on top of bussing our plates and filling our water glasses.  everything was personal...many items were put together at our table.  and the food was just MAGNIFICENT.

ok, first of all, if you want to eat here but are worried about the price, go get a $50 gift certificate from restaurant.com.  the certificate itself was only 2 bucks...well worth it for a fancy shmancy restaurant like this one.  and the servers don't mind at all...in fact, they're more than happy to take it.  it significantly lowered our bill...but don't forget to tip on the original amount!

ok...the food...we both ordered off the prix fixe menu.  a guy came around with a big ole basket of 4 different types of bread.  the pretzel roll was amazing.  we couldn't help but to have a couple of them!  

first course: 
1. truffled onion soup (the server poured the soup into our bowl at the side of our table)
2. tuna tartare (delish)

second course:
3. chorizo wrapped suzuki sea bass (probably my least favorite dish of the night...but was still extremely tasty!  i still licked the plate afterwards)
4. braised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli (ABSOLUTELY THE BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT!!!)

third course:
5. stout braised beef short ribs (the short ribs were so tender...it just melted in my mouth!)
6. prime filet mignon (cooked perfectly...no juices leaking on the plate...the steak rested enough to ensure that the steak wasn't dry...i've never had a steak as perfect as this one!)
   
fourth course/dessert:
7.  upgraded to a chocolate souffle (the server pokes a hole in the middle and pours chocolate into the inside...served with mocha ice cream)
8. carrot cake with cream cheese ice cream filling with a scoop of mango carrot ice cream (YUM)

as a bonus, wifey got an extra dessert for her birthday.  it was some sort of pistachio cake served with fresh fruit...also delish.  and they were cute enough to bring it out with a lit candle...awww....

i can't believe i waited all this time to eat at chef hubert keller's restaurant...there is one in san francisco but never really thought about eating at fleur de lys...until now...if only i were rich...haha.

I've eaten at both the San Francisco one and the Las Vegas one several times. Out of my Top 10 Best Meals, EVER, Fleur de Lys held one of those. (Other meals there were good, but not top 10.)

So I had high expectations for Fleur. And I left, wondering if Hubert Keller is actually gone from any presence here.

Don't get me wrong, the food was very decent. But I expected so much more than ""very decent"", I expected great. And the only greatness in my dinner came out at dessert time.

I ate a ton of stuff because I'm greedy and it was my birthday. So, here goes:
tuna tacos - beautiful plating. Tasted fine, but nothing to go on about. Agree with another reviewer who said they either need to be smaller, one bite things or less crunchy.
mac and cheese - not a lot of flavor and what flavor it had was a little bit weird. Thumbs down.
foie gras mousse - this would have been the best of the small plates except it was served with burned toast that reminded me of diner food. But the mousse was really really good. The huckleberries were the perfect compliment.
crab and avocado sphere with watermelon gazpacho - I didn't notice any watermelon. I can't say I noticed any crab either. Beautifully presented but not much flavor other than avocado. Very mediocre.
braised hamachi - a bit overly salted. It was fine though. 
skirt steak with chimmichurri was fabulous. The chimmichurri was the best I've ever had. +1 (finally!)
angus sliders - very good sliders, but still sliders. know what I mean?
ceci frito - FABULOUS fried chick peas. Nom nom!!
burrato - nom!
oysters margarita sorbet, orange puré - beautiful presentation with smokey liquid nitrogen! But the concoction did nothing to enhance the oysters. I'd pass.
fig jam flambe - okay, seriously?? Keller, wth are you thinking? This dish doesn't work at all.

But the desserts? ZOMG, the desserts were to die for. Using basil, cilantro, etc, in dessert flavors rocked me hard. Get the sorbets. Skip the dinner!",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,3,2,3,AEK9VHnzyK9VAkfBIfo11w
3459564,2011-01-05,7,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"2011 has started beautifully and this meal was just one of the highlights of its' first week. 

Fleur De Lys shut its doors (and broke my heart) and then opened up as Fleur by Hubert Keller (and soothed my aching heart). We were walking around Mandalay and saw that the place was open. We also caught eye of Hubert Keller going around the restaurant to the tables to catch up with diners. We made reservations for a late dinner.

Service was impeccable, the ambiance was great especially for a place that is priced so well and is a ""small plate/Tapas"" restaurant. The only complaint I have is that the Sushi Bar across becomes a nightclub of sorts 11pm onwards. If you are willing to listen to a Santana cover band while savoring delicate food, plan for a late meal. If you are like me, I will be trying to avoid this assault on my ears and dine a little earlier.

Our order:

1. Ceci Frito ($5)- Fried Chickpeas (a little coating of cornflour) and preserved lemons. Best chickpea preparation I've ever had. We ordered 3 plates since we loved it so

2. Hummus & Baba Ganoush ($6) - The highlight here was the flat bread (free refills). The bread was smooth, thin and had a sparse sprinking of paprika/red chili powder that gave it a slight kick

3. Onion Soup ($6) - This was one dish from Fleur De Lys that they've brought here. Served in cute shot glasses, one order is 4 glasses and tastes sweet, smooth and tasty with a dollop of truffle oil on it

4. Risotto ($8) - With scallion, lemon and basil, this creamy risotto with generous parmesan shavings was a hearty bowl and very satisfying

5. Wild Mushroom Ragout ($9) - Various mushrooms (oyster etc) in a medley and reduced in a creamy concoction. Star of the meal!

6. Gnocchi ($9) - Velvety soft homemade pasta with a thick tomato sauce and pesto. Perfection in a bite

7. Coconut Soup ($7) - Another import from the old Fleur De Lys. Passion fruit sorbet settles on top of a soup of coconut and sago pearls and sprinkled with freeze dried fruit. 2 servings per order. The freshest desert I have ever had. 

I'm brimming with joy that Hubert Keller is back with a vengeance. I love it and Fleur by Hubert Keller is once again one of my favorite restaurants in the world!",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,15,9,5,w9mhGWkNvqu7QxFoJhpTrQ

The service here is stellar and they really pay attention to detail. The huge gripe I have with the service is that they neglected to tell us each soda would be charged as such. This would've been ok if each one had more than 3 sips in it and didn't get refilled when it was halfway done.

Other than my small gripe and my friends slightly overcooked Sea Bass the meal was fantastic. I must admit the meal started off great when we were greeted by the deceptively cute hostess and brought to a very private table. I'll excuse the fact that she called my friend my other half but that's a story for another day.

We ordered the 4 course elegance menu which started with tuna tartare on top of a fennel slaw which was refreshing and a great starter. Next up was a chorizzo wrapped Chilean Sea Bass with risotto with a tomato sauce that was amazing. My bass was cooked perfectly and basically melted in my mouth. The presentation was colorful and made the dish pop. Next out was the filet mignon and potato gratin. The filet was buttery and the perfect portion.

And then there was dessert.....wow was there dessert. I ordered the chocolate fondant cake with peanut butter milkshake and peanut butter ice cream. My friend ordered the carrot cake with carrot/pineapple ice cream. I am not a fan of carrot cake but the ice cream was intense. My fondant cake was exactly like you'd hope a gooey, warm, angel would be. Wait....no, that's it. A great way to end an elegant meal even if my company was a snobby Yelper.

Appetizers: We ordered the foie gras trio which came in three forms: seared, terrean (?) and cappuccino. That's right. Cappuccino. Wth right?? Surprisingly, pretty damn good! We also ordered the Truffled Onion Soup. OH MY GOSH. Delicious! Rich, smooth, flavorful, yummy! We also got some Sea Bass appetizer and that was just okay. It wasn't very memorable because frankly, I don't remember how to describe it.

Entrees: We ordered the Filet Mignon and Lobster. The Filet Mignon was hands down, the most tender and juicy steak I've EVER had. I was so blown away. I'm serious! The lobster was just as delicious but I was too busy focusing on my filet mignon to really eat the lobster.

Dessert: We ordered the chocolate souffle which was pretty delicious as well!

3517495,2011-01-19,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Last year I took my wife to Fleur de Lys for her birthday and we had one of the best meals we've ever had. A year later, we're back. Although now it's just called Fleur and the concept has changed to a more casual eatery serving small plates (don't call it tapas... it's not a Spanish restaurant!). 

They've got a larger ""patio"" and a central bar, along with a new facade that looks like part of a huge wicker picnic basket (I'm not a fan). The inside of the dining area is lighter -- they stripped out all the curtains -- and more open and replaced the roses mounted on the stone wall with corks. They were going with a casual feel and they got it. The space also felt a lot smaller than I remember.

Every dish we tried ranged from good to excellent:

Oysters ($10) - margarita sorbet, orange purée. 3 per order. The presentation is cool with the use of dry ice in a rectangular box with stones and seaweed. The sweetness of the sorbet and purée dominated any trace of the brininess or meatiness of the oysters. It was good, but an overly sweet way to start off the meal.

Crab and avocado sphere ($14) - watermelon gazpacho. Another sweet dish thanks to the avocado and watermelon. It was good, but could have used something more savory in it.

Tuna tacos ($11) - jalapeños, lime cilantro. Amazing! The big, fat chunks of tuna were so fresh and silky smooth. It was the perfect blend of hot and cold and soft and crunchy. I want a dozen of these to go!

Peking duck ($15) - greens, pearl onions, date purée. This is one duck dish that will make me forget about all others. Tender, juicy, rich and savory. And, the skin was crispy too. One bite with the other ingredients (that date purée was damn good) and I was in heaven.

Skirt steak ($15) - chimmichurri, roasted fingerling potato, creme fraiche. The greens, tomato, and potato were all good but the steak was a bit tough and chewy. My least favorite dish of the night.

Tiramisu ($8) - coffee-marsala ladyfinger, mascarpone, chocolate. I'm no expert at tiramisu, but this was delicious. So good I wanted to lick every last drop out of the dish.

For beverages, we had two glasses of wine, a Chimay Grande Reserve, and the best porter I've ever had -- a Meantime London Porter. Sure, I don't know much about beer, but it was amazing! It had a sweet, smokey taste and a really smooth finish. 

The service was ok. Our waiter was working a few tables so we didn't see him very often. The pace of the meal wasn't bad, just a little on the slow side. We were celebrating my wife's birthday and they did write happy bday on the tiramisu plate, but I was expecting, at the very least, some petit fours or some other complimentary item to end the meal. Maybe I was expecting too much but even at a place like Applebee's don't they give you something for free on your birthday?

I would definitely come here again to try other items (and order more tuna tacos and another porter or two). But, I would hope that the service picks up. This place is still a little rough around the edges, but very close to being a 5 star dining experience. We ended up spending $165 (incl. tax and tip). In this city and for that kind of food, that's not bad. Too many times, at other restaurants, I've spent twice that for inferior food.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,5,4,mzrGZo2-ma9-TsurL6O3nA

First off. Anyone who goes to the webite for this place, looks at the menu, and sees a bunch of things they can't relate to because they've never seen them before and decides from there not to go are making a HUGE mistake.

This place is all about the flavors. Everything and I mean everything has been crafter to provide a unique flavor experience. 

Looking back on this meal I feel as though I expereiced a mini tasting menu from a restaurant with a Michelin star but at a fraction of the price. It was that good!

Normally I like to point out a few dishes in particular that stood out but everything here was good enough to stand on its own its hard to do so, though the truffle soup and the mussels were good candidates.

As for value, my wife and I came away full and very happy and it only set us back $85 without wine. For what you get, that ain't bad at all.

Menu- As previously said, the resturant has a prix fixe style.  You choose between the number of courses and a selection for each course.  The menu is relatively small - but that is to be expected for this type of resturant.  

Food - This would be the only area I see room for improvement.  My steak was good, but not of the caliber I would have expected.  My Venison Ravioli was very tasty though.

Because we had a party of 10, we decided to order ""The Feast."" Sounds daunting, right? Don't worry - there was a lot of food! The Feast includes almost everything from the menu. It's definitely enough food, but because most of them were small plates, not everyone got to try everything. Out of all the dishes (minus desserts), the Lobster Mac n Cheese really stood out. To be honest, not a lot of the dishes wow-ed me.

By the end of dinner, I was the only girl in the group, so obviously, I ate the majority of the desserts. It was quite a happy birthday to me! Their creme brulee was good, ice cream and sorbets were fresh, and oh my god, the cheesecake was AH-MAZING! 

Their service was great - they consistently brought out food, took away used plates, filled our water glasses, and made sure we had everything.

Mlife is the rewards program for gambling, staying and eating at all the MGM-owned properties (Mandalay Bay, MGM, Bellagio, Aria, etc).  I down-loaded the mlife app to my iPhone and under the section called ""promotions"" I see the ""two for one"" drink special at Fleur.  It clearly states the happy hour special runs from 3pm to 6:30pm.  It was 5:45pm and off we went to indulge!  I pull my phone out and show the waitress as we order.  She knows nothing about mlife or the special and gets a manager who tells me I have to go to the mlife desk in the casino to get a voucher.  We order the drinks and I leave my husband in Fleur to go get the voucher.  They mlife desk tells me there is no such voucher and that the Fleur employees need to honor the special that is on the app.  Ok, I go back and finish my now-melted drink.

Here's my beef:   Fleur, if you are going to run an mlife special please tell your employees so that your customers don't feel like criminals for following the rules.  We were plain and simply responding to a marketing promotion that you/your company put out.  We weren't asking for any exceptions to be made or special treatment and we weren't being cheap.

The chai tea ice cream is strong on its own but mellows out and adds a nice spice when eaten with the pavlova. The raspberries add a sweet and tart note. Wow!

Portions are not huge, which I actually liked because I was able to try an appetizer, main course, and dessert. Usually I'm stuffed just from the entree! However, if you want to spend as little as possible and get full, this probably isn't the place for you.

Overall me and my date both agreed that everything was fine but simply lacked that ""umph"" that I'd expect from a chef of Keller's caliber to do and take us over the edge. Sorry but I gotta chalk it up as (what was) another overpriced spot along the strip. The execution was fine, but maybe its the fact that Vegas can't quite grow the best of ingredients/produce that money can buy. If thats the case my money will go elsewhere.

With the current state of the economy, more and more chefs are having to tweak their formulas and re-tool their restaurants.

First off, our server was amazing! He didn't give us any crap for having a restaurant.com which some nicer places tend to do.  Second, he was funny and checked in the right amount of time.  Food had good timing- we were able to enjoy a couple plates at a time with the next sets coming out right when we were ready for them.  Also, dished had great presentation. Some come out on dry ice which is always fun.

The food- we had the fleur burger 5000... Yeah right! While it would be funny to use a coupon for that, there is no way I would order it!  

Croque Monsieur- thought it was going to be croquettes (that's our fault).  It was okay but not what we expected.  The waiter asked if we liked it and we told him it was not what we thought it would be. He took it away and took it off the bill.  We replaced with the chicken croquettes which is what we originally thought we were getting.  They lacked a little bit of flavor- guess I just like the ones I make at home a little bit better.

Risotto- freaking awesome.  I love Parmesan in my risotto and this did not disappoint.  Very strong, bold favors.

Tuna tacos- these were pretty good.   Not disappointing, but nothing extra special about them.

Ceviche- really enjoyed this one.  It was nice and light and had great flavor.

Chocolate souffle- yummmmmmmmmy!

Overall, we really enjoyed the overall dining experience and ambiance.  The price point might be a little high without the restaurant.com, but it is typical Vegas prices.  Stop by the happy hour if you can and catch a good drink special!",87AXJ_GCGhz7RntCvbokLw,1,1,4,qUbXvXf7bNGUzgUg3EeNNQ

The food comes out relatively slow- it wasn't very busy when I was there. When I got the chicken, I saw that some of it was translucent on the thicker end. When I ate it, it had a jelly texture. I told the waitress that I thought my chicken was undercooked. She took it back. She brought it out again, same chicken, and I noticed they did nothing more than perhaps microwave or bake it- basically re-cooked it. For a high-end restaurant, I was expecting a bit more. Additionally, I asked the waitress for a side order of fries. We never got them... And as soon as we know it, we got our check with no mention of our fries.

I want to give this restaurant reviews worthy of ROTD glory, and have it exude the class worthy of Fleur de Lys, but at the same time, I don't think I can express how I feel without drenching the review with expletives the likes of which Yelp has never seen...

You see, I am a woman who, against social norms and mores, prefers the use of taboo four letter words in a sort of juxtaposition or ironic meaning.  In that way, the ""F"" word has come to mean something good when used in it's Libby-esque context. 

So, hear me out....

Night 2 of our Yelpers in Vegas retreat.  The night previous, we had experienced the drunken epicness that is but the stuff of legend.  Seriously, the night before was pretty major.  
So naturally, being that Sunday night was to be the ""mellow"" evening, I was tickled to know that Keller's Fleur de Lys would be the dinner destination.  Did I say tickled?  I meant fucking stoked.

Our arrival did have a bump in the road.  We had to wait for our table to become available.  However, complimentary champagne and excellent service heals all wounds, and therefore, by the time we got to our table, much later than expected, we were not only fine with it, we were quite buzzed and contented.  

The menu was everything in life I had ever wanted.  Truffles and foie gras and beef, oh my!  So it was with the greatest pleasure that I spotted the 7 course tasting menu that served as it's main a filet mignon with a slab of foie and black truffles.  You had me at mignon.

What followed the ordering was what can only be described as an experience the likes of which I had never, and may never again, experience.  Pure bliss.  Borderline sexual bliss if I am being honest.  
Each succulent bite, from the amuse to the souffle was pure, unadulterated euphoria.  And believe me folks, I busted out the ""Oh"" face, repeatedly.

Truly, I can't say enough about the service, the food and the overall ambiance of this restaurant.  It wasn't my first tasting menu experience, but it was the best I've ever had...and I mean that both culinarily and sexually.  ;)

2nd course. Seabass wrapped in chorizo.  Tasty.

3rd course.  Braqised ribs.  mmmmm.  Good sauce, great meat.  Tender

4th course.  Chocolate dessert, with the Peanut butter shot - a good end to the meal.

I ordered the braised short ribs, that was really just a giant RIB (as in only one big one). it was not that good, and it's really hard to screw up SHORT RIBS. It also had this weird FOAM on top of it that looked like a fuzzy mold. The parsnip puree had a very weird texture. That was POOR, D+ but I ate the whole thing...

As expected, this burger was ridiculously delicious.  The burger with the foie gras and truffles just melted in my mouth with every bite.

Luckily, I managed to take $25 off with my restaurant.com coupon so that helped ease the pain on my wallet.

My server was really good to me.  Always checked in on me and refilled my water when needed.  Also a huge plus to see that Chef Keller was present overlooking the kitchen that night.  Glad that he took time to step out of the kitchen to stop by at every table to meet his customers.  Really cool dude!!

I loved the ambiance although it was a little quiet and after a few glasses of wine, I'm not :)

We both had the prime filet mignon done medium and it was melt in your mouth awesome! I'd list it in my top 5 of all the filets I've ever had. It came with spinach, pureed potatoes (which were amazing), carrots and mushrooms. All very tasty. 

The plates were super cute! I wish my purse was big enough because I would have jacked them but sssssh that's our secret.

Wine list was pretty pricey so we chose the Iberian Remix Red (around $50) which is a tempranillo from the Central Coast of California. It was fabulous. Great suggestion by the manager/sommelier.

Only thing I didn't like was around 10:15, we hadn't placed our order yet. We were pretty much forced to order even though there were other HUGE groups which had just been seated/hadn't ordered yet. Why were we rushed and they weren't? After my friend and I were all done, we still had full glasses of wine and were talking the night away. The check came and we laid it down on the table and put a tiny dish on top of it so she knew we weren't done. Our server had the nerve to come by and take it while we were still sitting there drinking our wine. I found that to be extremely rude.

She was surprised to see how small the tuna tacos were when they came out but we ordered plenty of dishes to keep us full.  The tuna tacos, basil mussels, steak with chimi churi sauce, and lobster mac and cheese were all amazing.  I didn't try anything I didn't like.

There were 4 of us and we all ordered 3-4 tapas a peice.  It was a great way for us to all catch up with each other after we hadn't seen each other for awhile while enjoying dinner. They timed the food perfectly so we never had too much on the table or were waiting for food. 

We used the restaurant.com gift certificate which was a great deal so we were all able to get a few cocktails and dessert as well as the tapas for $43 a person. Amazing deal.

3785709,2009-12-29,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I decided to majorly splurge and brought BF here as part of his Christmas present. But as much as it was part of his Christmas present, it was just as much for me too cos I've been wanting to do something like this and I love me mah food! So why Fleur de Lys and not some other fancy place? $50 restaurant.com gift certificate for $4. It helps cushion the bill, believe me.

I ordered the 3-course with wine pairings for BF with the truffled onion soup and the beef short ribs. I can say that the short ribs were better than the ones I had once at L'Espalier in Boston. And I think the Bailey's ice cream was the best out of his dessert plate, although I barely got to taste it since BF polished it off so quick cos ""it was melting."" That one taste I had was memorable, though. The peanut butter shake was super peanut buttery, and the cake didn't seem anything too special. His dessert wine (Brachetto d'Acqui) was super tasty.

I got the 4-course with wine pairings for myself with the tuna tartare, the veal ravioli, the filet mignon with foie gras and truffles, and the Grand Marnier souffle. You like how I spend more on myself than on BF? =P The tuna tartare was good but had the potential to be better. The ravioli was amazingly thin and tasty. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly and very good, although I think the best filet mignon I've ever had still goes to Meritage in Boston. And I suppose I'm just not fancy enough for foie gras and truffles cos I definitely could've done without the addition. The souffle was a little eggy and got old after a while, but it was still good. Kinda wished I can gotten the chocolate one. For some reason I thought the Grand Marnier one was going to come out chocolate + Grand Marnier. Mmm....

All in all, I think the food could've been better. But it was the entire experience that really made it worth it for me. We were there probably a total of 4 hours, so it really was an event for us. It was a Wednesday night and not really popping. But they sat us at one of the round tables just before the cabanas facing out, so it was perfect for spying, haha. We were definitely the youngest of the bunch and I think the only ones having a really good time.

Our waiter was good but not the best. There were some awkward moments and wine poured after food was served type things. My favorite was the guy who brought out our food and explained everything. He was just a happy guy and seemed to really know what he was talking about, not just reciting from memorization.

Random food thoughts:  The bread most definitely could've been better. Some were even cold with moisture.... I liked that the wine pairing included a starter bubbly to go with the amuse bouche, and the amuse bouche itself was very good. The presentation and attention to detail of all food was beautiful, and I love all the crazy foams.

You know what helped make the night, though? BF just happened to see an old classmate working there, and we ended up with two extra desserts and an extra glass of that d'Acqui for free. I also felt like coffee after paying for the bill, and they didn't bother charging for it.

The two extra desserts we got were the carrot cake with pineapple carrot ice cream and a pear dessert with toasted cinnamon ice cream. Seriously, I think the best part was this little design of gelatin from the pear dessert made of Sauternes, which was the same wine paired with my souffle. There had to have been some nice spices that went into that gelatin as well. So you can imagine how fat we were after all that dessert. And then out comes the petits fours. =P

BF seemed to want to study the menu in the beginning, so the waiter offered to get him a menu to talk home. I later asked if we could get a copy of the wines we tried. He ending up getting us personalized menus with everything we ordered along with all the wine pairings printed on nice paper, rolled up, and tied with ribbons, which was a nice touch. They also plucked me a rose from their big wall design, which was cute. But I bet it was probably time to change the roses, haha.

It was the most I've ever spent on a meal, and it was probably silly of me to do so at this time with my family's current financial woes. But you gotta live it up once in a while, and I thought of it more as a once in a lifetime thing than anything else, heh. They really took care of us though, and that's what really counts. :]",tbXhMtRaWgscqbD6U_PV5A,2,4,5,Mj5y89OiidV5OMNxYly7Ig

The service was excellent as the waiters were very knowledgeable, helpful, and prompt.  The ambience has a low key atmosphere which is perfect for a date and probably what you'd expect from a upscale French restaurant.

So let's go on to the food.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the prix fixe menu where we both ordered different items since we wanted to taste as much as we could from Chef Hubert Keller's menu.  We were started off with some small scallop dish that wasn't on the menu complimentary of the chef. So what we had each were:

- Truffle Onion Soup / Ahi Tuna Tartare (Appetizers)
- Chorizo Wrapped Seabass / Braised Short Ribs with guiness foam (Entree)
- Filet Mignon / Ravioli with Parmesan foam
- Chocolate Fondant / Carrot Cake Ice Cream with peanut butter shake/ Pistachio Cake (This one was for our early anniversary)

The food was all excellent.  The short ribs are delicious, but the taste of braised shortribs have never impressed me much.  They were tasty nonetheless.  The paremesan foam was an excellent touch to the ravioli, and the filet mignon was perfectly cooked.  Also, please get the truffled onion soup.  It really wasn't what I was expecting at all, and I'm glad I tried it even though I don't care for onion soup.

3798768,2012-07-14,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had. The server was very helpful and willing to suggest her favorites. This place is definitely not high on value and probably turning an enormous profit on some dishes (ahi tuna tacos come to mind, 3 two-square inch tacos for $12), but some of it is really worth it and not enough to make me knock it down from five stars. 

One thing that would have made me knock it from five stars is the fact that my reservation was not in the computer. Luckily there were literally two other tables in the whole place, but had I spent 10 minutes on the Mandalay Bay reservations line and not gotten a table, I would have been furious and not enjoyed my meal so much, if I would have bothered to stay. A caveat to keep your confirmation number when making a reservation. 

We ordered 9 small plates and a dessert, all for two. I had a restaurant.com coupon and wasn't sure if I would ever be back, so we decided to go all out. The server suggested that we get around 3 per person, but considering how small a few of the small plates were, 9 would have been necessary.

Starting off with the not so great, for myriad reasons:
-Manchego salad - a teeny little dusting of manchego on top of a salad. I was expecting, you know, a lot of manchego considering it is the namesake of the salad. It was good, but somewhat misleading.
-""In the Shower"" Mac and Cheese - gourmet mac and cheese with lobster meat in it. I'm sure it's all fantastic quality ingredients, but $18 for a small plate seemed steep.
-Ahi tacos as mentioned

And on to the good:
-Duck Confit - little baby spring rolls with duck meat. Delicious.
-Fried chickpeas - the best value on the menu at $3
-Flatiron steak with chimichurri - deliciously prepared, though we had a lot of extra chimichurri
-Lemon basil risotto - excellent, though slightly overpriced for the amount
-Brie flambee - nice little flatbread with honey and bacon. The combination of the ingredients made it sort of breakfasty, but still delicious.

And finally, one of the best things I ever ate: the steak tartare. It was fantastic. I had only had tartare one other time, and after you get used to the whole, erm, concept, it was truly wonderful. The flavors melded really well together and the dish made our night. For dessert I had a pistachio meringue with chai ice cream. The meringue was extremely sweet but the ice cream was the right sweetness for such a meal.

Happy hour for $5 wells and $6 glasses of wine. But be careful, after the happy hour they jump to $12 and $14 respectively. 

One thing we noticed, though, is that it would be very hard to come here with 3-5 people. With 6 or more you could just do the ""eat the menu"" option, but with 2 we each got to have a couple bites of each thing. With more than two, you would be picking and choosing who got to have more bites, particularly for things like the ahi tacos and the duck confit. 

Picking up a restaurant.com certificate will definitely help you on price, too. All in all I will be back but with an edited menu and less of a go-all-out attitude so that I can really enjoy just a few things without putting such a large dent in the old pocketbook.

One thing that should be changed both here on Yelp and on the Mandalay Bay website: this place is not dressy. It is in a restaurant row with ""patio"" seating with people wearing jeans and with shopping bags.

We were looking at the various menus an decided that Fluer had the best value. We ended up ordering only one special and then we picked from the menu. The special included a small salad (ok) short rib lasagne (great taste, but small) and a chocolate mousse desert (pretty good.  We also ordered the tuna tacos  which came with 3 tiny tacos (yummy) the lobster Mac and Cheese ( light and yummy, but did not taste at all cheesy) and some goat cheese toast (yummy and light). We also ordered a Cuban sandwich (good) and the fries that came with it (phenomenal). For 3 of us we end up spending about 85$ pre tip and we were all satisfied, not at all full, but satisfied.  Everything was well prepared and carefully crafted, our server was good an brought every thing out appropriately (not all at the same time or too long in between).

We ate here on New Year's Eve after the Maroon 5 concert and it was the perfect choice for a light late night meal.  

We started off with the freshly made sangria filled with fresh fruit and oh the flavors that were going on....marvelous! 

For and appetizer I started with the Chestnut soup and hubby had the White Onion soup.  We both thought we won the appetizer round so that is always a good sign! Both soups were full of flavor and were served at the perfect temperature.  

Next we split the Duck Terrine which was a new plate for us.  Loved it! Light yet totally filling! For our entrees we split the baby stuffed bell peppers and  grilled artichoke hearts with golden baby yukon potatoes.....so good!

Our server was so incredibly sweet...I wish I could remember our name.  She timed everything perfectly and was the utmost professional.

I just visited Loss Vague Ass for the first time and Fleur de Lys was one of the places I wanted to visit for dinner.  Unfortunately, they were not open (according to my plan) on Monday night...but I was able to visit for happy hour on Tuesday before I took off.  

The food: Truffled Onion Soup Shooters, 4 small porcelain cups served in a wooden basket.  Hot, rich and frothy...not too much truffle flavor but matched extremely well with my well-made sazerac.

Also the Keller Sliders: 2 sand dollar-sized grilled bleu cheese-stuffed sliders on potato buns.  Topped with grilled red onion and beautifully presented with crisp and delicious shoe-string fries.  

The drink: A fairly well-made sazerac (though they had no rye so it was just plain bourbon) with absinthe, bitters, sugar and citrus.  Served over ice (I prefer straight up...but this was good enough).

This was the restaurant we chose to wrap up the trip and it was our ""get dolled up and splurge"" night.  We couldn't have chosen a better place.  The service, food, and wine were impeccable which made a thoroughly enjoyable and memorable evening.

Service was perfect, but I expect nothing less when throwing down hundreds for dinner for two.  Yes, this place is spendy, but between the food, service, and ambiance, it's an evening you'll never forget.

We started with the Foie Gras.  I know it's not PC. And, it's probably best for my health that California has banned it.  But, this particular preparation of Foie Gras with the reduction and the brioche was a delectable balance of silky, crunchy, sweet, and salty that bordered on divine. The Roasted Baby Beets were a feast for the eyes and the beets looked like jewels glistening on the plate.  We had to try the Fleur Burger- Wagyu Beef, foie gras, AND truffles?? What's not to love?!?  The Green Papaya Carpaccio of Wagyu Beef with toasted peanuts and thai chilies was also excellent. We had an absolutely amazing bottle of Cabernet with our meal which just made everything come together perfectly.

Also, we had the chocolate souffle and I'm thinking dessert is not their strong suit.  But, there are pages of delicious small plates from all over the world which more than compensate for the dessert.  I would absolutely go back!",PmIfN1xTN58rQ7wRo11k4g,1,1,5,QohAtqWQv7OskUf7534wzw

Tuna tacos: very simple and not much to it. It was basically tuna topped with a dallop of gaucamole and sour cream.  I mean really...?

Lobster mac and cheese:  bland and Barely any lobster taste. 

Sliders: dry...

Chimichurri steak: only tasted oil from the chimichurri sauce, no garlic or herb taste. Meat was cold upon arrival.  

Foie gras: this was the only decent item we ordered.  Cute plating.

The other good thing was the $3 selected beer, maybe a happy hour deal?

Roasted Organic Chicken Breast // Generous portion of chicken breast on top of a red quinoa salad that is mixed with a fresh light vinaigrette. This was yummy as well and a good choice for a lighter option.

To be honest, I had always past this place not thinking much but ""oh look there is a restaurant""

There was a party of eight and I had made reservations for eight of us. The pretty hostesses led me to the bar as I waited for the rest of the group. The bartenders were helpful.. some had a chip on their shoulders. One had rudely asked me to move out of the ""service area"". I understood I was in the way... but my parents had always taught me it's not what you say but how you say it! Some of the bartenders need to register for some customer service workshops.

The place is nice, but at a first glance the place looks casual. Some tables hug up against the main casino walkway so there isn't much privacy.

We were lucky enough to be seated inside. The place is nice but very small. The service is above average and prices are what you would expect for a restaurant of this caliber.

Now onto the food... the food was good. I had the fleur burger which was very tasty. It was what you expect a fancy burger to taste like. Im not a huge fan of caramelized onions but it gave the burger a little more ummphh and a bit more texture. A solid B for the burger. 

It also came with a side of potatoes slices (their version of French fries) I wasn't a big fan. They came in this small little cup and didn't taste like they were thoroughly cooked.

If you are gonna give me a good burger, please make sure you put as much effort on the French fries as well! A D for this poor excuse of fries!! Very disappointed. 

Overall ... would I come back? Well if the universe presented me this place again, I wouldn't kick and scream but I would order another entree.. the strip steak looked way better than my burger.

And this is a great restaurant but it's not what I was expecting and I was disappointed. I really thought it was going to be French and a bit more elegant.

Let me further preface my review by stating I am a sucker for a celebrity chef.  Especially a slightly lesser known celebrity chef than the Emerils, Pucks and Flays of the world.

It was not quiet.  As soon as I saw it, I knew it was not what I wanted but we were there so we stayed.  I asked the hostess to seat us away from the front bar and noise but we were seated just inside the restaurant even though other seats were available.  Shame on me for not insisting on the back of the restaurant.  The decor is very contemporary, urban and loft like with a two story ceiling.  The noise level is high from the bar and the club across the hallway in addition to the lounge music playing in the restaurant itself.

The food is contemporary American small plates.  We had ceviche, wings, sliders, tuna tacos and a few other things.  I really didn't see anything French on the menu.  Dare I say it, it's basically elevated bar food.  It's good and for $140 with three cocktails including two signature drinks, it was less than we were expecting to pay.  But this wasn't the dining experience we were hoping for.  The cocktails are very good and probably the highlight of the meal.  No, the souffle was the highlight.  Very yummy.

I'll mention my server right in the beginning.  Kathleen was perfect.  She helped explain the dishes when I had questions, she recommended certain dishes as potential tries, but she wasn't in the business of pushing more plates.  She was great!  After telling me most people order three, she suggested I try two and see how much that filled me up and decide then.

For starters, I ordered the white onion soup velouté and the tarte flambée.  The onion soup was excellent.  It was very good and the velouté gave it a different taste but there was still the flavor of onion coming through nicely.  The I got the tarte flambée.  It's a flatbread with bacon, asparagus, truffle, crème fraiche, and and onion.  This, too, was a tasty small plate and quite a different take on standard flatbreads.

I wasn't full yet, so I stayed in France--the menu is divided into different countries--and I got the seared foie gras with braised beef cheek and shallot jus.  This was outstanding.  The foie gras was excellent.  I've only had one other foie gras that would hands down beat this one.

I still had a little room, so I just had to order dessert.  The menu lists exotic panna cotta.  This was a small glass jar with a layer of pineapple panna cotta on the bottom and then a layer of coconut.   On top was some fresh fruit, some coconut and some crisps that gave the dessert a wonderful texture.

This was a very pleasant dining experience.  It's amazing how quickly small plates can add up when you get your bill.

The only thing I'd change about the place was the music.  What it was, I have no idea.  It was really bad.  Since I was dining alone, perhaps I heard it more than if I were there with someone and talked through it.  In any case, it's not good.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,4,4,BP5mZmlw2e1SjhTte0l_fw

We had a late dinner, as part of a show/dinner package. Everything minus tea and dessert was terrible, or at best, horrible.  We tried about 8 different menu items in all, one was worse than the other. 

Among the lowlights, the ""wagyu"" burger they served me 'medium rare' was just rare. I still fear I have acquired some illness, as the restaurant simply didn't inspire confidence that their kitchen could handle fragile food. Even whilst oozing blood, it was one of the driest, most tasteless burgers I've ever had. Oh yes, it was $36. 

Dessert was good-- but, well, it should be. Tea and coffee were the highlights of the entire meal. Yes, for a four dollar sign restaurant, this is my takeaway. Service was fine.

Seriously, at this cost, and this level of quality, you should eat almost anywhere else. Most people have figured that out-- we were practically alone in the restaurant a couple hours from closing on a Friday night. I am guessing this place will be closed within the year-- good riddance. 

Restaurants like this that are incredibly overpriced, and devastatingly bad, give Vegas a bad name and erode the goodwill the restaurant industry has carefully and deservedly built in this town over the last decade.",-uomiSxABFOnYg03VJlsPw,1,0,1,1gvnw6x3DMauGfEY6DpuNw

4002992,2007-03-06,10,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"ok now. good lord. talk about a nice place. 

ive noticed i dont seem to review high end restaurants too nicely. i tend to be very critical of every last detail from the flaps of the toilet paper being folded up, to my napkin being replaced properly every time i leave the table. its not that im a prick and demand the world revolves around my every whim, i just expect when you pay out your ass, some fucker better be kissing it and asking if the temperature and texture of their lips are to my liking. i kid i kid. i actually hate kiss ass waitstaff. i just have two requirements for a good waiter. one, know what they are doing, aka know food. this one time at lark creek steak, i asked our waiter, * is this mirco arugula?*  he had that look like.... wtf is micro arugula. he had to go back to find out. ehhhh i can understand, newbie and all. second requirement, dont be an ass. the host and waiter are the first impressions of the restaurant for me. if either or both blows it there goes the meal. 

so this last time around in vegas a buddy of mines comped us our rooms so i thought i should at least buy a nice dinner for everyone. the four of us found ourselves at fleur de lys in mandaly bay on sat night. how swanky. upon entering, im like wow, this is soo not my scene. except for the waitstaff, not a single diner was close to our age. ehh thats alright. 

we were seated in the tiny *bar area* if you can even call it that for a quick minute. it was cramped. good thing we were seated at our table quickly. 

the dining area is awesome. beautiful. the shape of the restaurant is a bit odd, but then again, the fact that i forgot we were inside a casino  goes to show how well they designed this place. very simple, yet oh so elegant. low key but badass. very much my style. not gaudy at all, a nice simple hotness about the place. 

our waiter was great. laughed with us, answered everything properly. at first he was more mmmm, proper and was a bit rigid, but showing signs of someone who knows how to work it in the hospitality business, he adjusted and became more loose and that in turn made us feel more welcomed. i wish more waitstaff folks could understand that... or probably more accurately care enough and do their job well enough to make their guests happy. 

the food was outstanding. every bite was better than the next. my roasted squab just melted in my mouth. it was FANFUCKINGTASTIC. i can easily say this was probably one of my top 20 favorite meals of all time. 

but i must stress this again, the folks working here make the place. the staff here makes you feel truly welcome..... and only then can you really have a very pleasant dining experience.",8hvXl0oJmU61l17LG9aDag,13,11,5,zKUwdN50HaTzjXoj5wcsOQ

Two minutes later the polenta and finally the foie gras appetizer.

Perusing the $20 lunch options, most seemed like pretty standard stuff (read: lots of burgers). I happened on the menu for Fleur:
place I would normally never visit? check.
interesting menu I wouldn't normally order? check.
$20 lunch option? check.
Ok, sounds like a done deal.

We walk in and the hostess is a little cold about seating a party of 6 for lunch and suggests we could just ""pull some tables together in the lounge."" No thanks, can we please sit at a normal height table? Not to worry, though, we got our normal height table and our waiter was awesome. Tragedy averted. (Plus points for being totally cool with our six-month old).

Ambiance inside is pretty cool. The booths are separated by these flowy curtain things and the wine cellar is actually up on a second floor, looking down over the dining area. Nice.

They had a nice selection of specialty drinks which we did not sample, although I might be back for happy hour, since it's 2 for 1 from 3-6pm. We did get a carafe of sangria, which was tasty, but perhaps not worth the price tag.

Now for the food! The restaurant week special was seriously awesome. The first course was a field green salad with cheese croutons. Just a salad, I know, but very deliciously prepared. The main course was short rib lasagna, and I wasn't too excited about it, but it was sooo good. The beef was tender and flavorful, the noodles perfect, the cheese mild but added a great flavor to the dish. Plus, the baby carrots were delicious. I could have eaten like 4 of these things, no joke. Then dessert. I gave myself a 1-meal reprieve from my ban of sweets in honor of restaurant week, and it was definitely worth it. The dessert was a pot de creme with bourbon foam and cookie, which I found out means ""fancy chocolate pudding."" Great texture, the bourbon foam added the tiniest hint of tartness (or whatever the flavor of bourbon is), and the cookie was delicious, with a light not-too-sweet cream filling. It was served in a mini mason jar, so extra points for presentation.

If the review stopped there, I would grade Fleur five stars, but my husband was not in the mood for the lunch special, and instead got an Italian sandwich. Who would order such a thing at Fleur, you may ask? Well, I know of only one person. The sandwich was fine, but it was still just a regular sandwich. $18 was pretty steep, so I have to assume the rest of the menu is pretty pricey, too.",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,1,1,4,Gq1-N4r7Z4BG-te7kLQTSg

Usual deal with me: the service was great. Very friendly and attentive. 

The decor is nice, but kind of felt psuedo-nice inside. They had a digitized drink menu on the table, which entertained my friend while we were there. And while I like the concept of [it] I couldn't help but think of the Outback Steakhouse in a small town I was in that had the same thing. She had a mojito and I had a beer.

She had eaten, and I was ravenous. They served 4 different kinds of cuisine for appetizers: Peruvian, Greek, French, and something else. This usually worries me but hunger wore me down.

I ordered two apps so I could figure out what I wanted to eat. I had the chestnut soup with profiteroles and received GRAVY. Thanksgiving-style gravy. I am SO not kidding. Without a word, I had my friend taste it and asked her what she thought I was eating. Gravy ding ding ding! $12.gravy.

Then came the octopus with potatoes ($18?) The octopus was fishy in taste and flavor and I was concerned if I would get a stomachache later. It was seasoned fine (maybe to mask the fishiness) but the potatoes were bland. I didn't even take a picture.

The waitperson came back to ask me what I wanted for dinner and I just shook my head. I was starving, but couldn't do it. Our bill was almost $60. What the holy heck?

4060090,2008-12-11,1,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"As for the soufflé?

I know it is just a soufflé. It is simple, and if you haven't tried making one in your own kitchen spend a Sunday afternoon having fun and experimenting. It is a blast, not too hard, and you can do ANYTHING with soufflés. A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Trust me... it is a good time! Go experiment! I made a breakfast cheese and bacon one once. Seriously.... They are easy and can go in every direction.

However this was without question one of the finest soufflés I have ever had. Sometimes the chocolate is so perversely sweet it feels like hershey's, and other times so flavourless it feels like the baker forgot sugar. This was so well balanced, and after a meal like we had, not overtly rich. The sauce brought out enough of the chocolate flavor that the soufflé itself was able to stand alone as a delicious cocoa confection. It also had risen to perfection, and was timed incredibly well. Like... perfectly.

Of course it was at this point the hand press decaf for my lady came out, and my simple double shot of espresso followed..... at $9. I have a contention about that.... The coffee is to buffer the night ahead from this rich and gluttonous meal we had just consumed. It is more of a courtesy to a well rounded dining experience than a necessary or expected aspect of dining. What I am saying is that this should exist for the guest like a well priced wine list, or should be a complimentary aspect of the evening. I don't mind a fair charge for a coffee at the end of the meal, but when you are dropping $400 I am not quite sure a $9 espresso feels fair or gracious. It was actually disappointing that something that petty got us talking about the price of the meal, etc.... and as we walked out of the door it was a simple espresso at the end of the meal that rang in our heads and caused consternation, instead of the entire majestic and astonishing experience that preceded that.

And it is with consternation that I give the entire experience 4 stars.  Simply, I feel it is 3.  Just fine.  But the dining experience is unreal, the food is divine.  The simple fact is that this is one of those ""best meals in the world"", and you simply shouldn't walk away talking about an overpriced espresso.

We were there really early, before 5:30. The hostess seemed slightly confused as to why we were there. She asked if we wanted tapas or the full dinner menu.

We came in to try the Lion King Prix Fixe which looked good. You had a choice of soup or salad, salmon or braised short ribs and a selection of chocolate for dessert. It was $55.

I started out with the guava caipirinha which at $15 could have been a bigger glass. It was tasty though.  

I ordered the soup and short ribs. The gay boyfriend also had the soup and chose the salmon. The soup was a creamy onion that was delicious with this little morsel of pork. Oh, I could have had 10 of these tiny bites of heavenly oink oink. But alas, it was just the one tidbit.

Now, usually I worry about short ribs never being tender enough but Fleur de Lys was great. Every bite was delicious. I also loved the leeks in it. 

Finally just as we didn't think we could eat any more came our dessert. We were each given a tiny shot glass of a peanut butter shake, a chocolate fondant cake and a decently-sized scoop of Bailey's ice cream on a really nice thin crisp of chocolate. I can't decide if I liked my short ribs more or the dessert. Let's just say I loved both equally.

Delicious!  Almost forgot... they served an amuse bouche at the beginning of our meal that was amazing.  It was a piece of fried (I think) fish atop warm potato salad.  It sounded disgusting and I was nervous to try it, but it was extremely tasty and left us wanting more.

My husband ordered the mango lobster salad and the venison, which were both so great.  In my opinion, even though everything was delicious, nothing came close to the soup.  The presentation was amazing and it is NOT your typical onion soup with beef broth.  It was thick & creamy, and I couldn't get enough.  The truffles, duck ragout and red onion/red vinegar puree make this soup unique and fabulous!  The server poured the actual soup table side which added a nice touch.

I've passed Fleur many times and for whatever reason it doesn't jump out at you as a place that makes you want to eat there. Well, if you haven't eaten there then you should. 
My wife and I ordered the tasting 5 or 6 course meal. I wanted to sample the menu a bit so I would have a feel for this place. Every single thing was very well prepared. From the grilled octopus, to the stuffed peppers, to the delicious skirt steak. It was on point. 
The thing that really stood out for me though was the service. It was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Not chatty, not uptight, not phony, and not goofy. When we would finish a course at the precise time that something should come out it would magically right on time be brought to the table. They changed utensils after each course. They brought drinks right on time. There was no waiting and no rush. Perfect. The only regret I have is not remembering our servers name. I know it was a woman. I know when I go back I will walk in see if I spot her and then ask to sit in her area. 
Great food and great service.",JtdQVsiKWRrghAPepxjYQg,3,1,5,p3oewWVLHEUXhkVb7XxR_g

Ok now that's out of the way. 
I've eaten at Fleur for a business dinner but my constant companion has not. As a local it is always a treat for us to actually go to a strip casino on a Saturday night. But the MPI-WEC trade show was there and I wanted to bask in their ambiance so off to Mandalay Bay we went. 
Fleur is in the perfect location for people watching. We had made a reservation for 630pm but got there early and was very happy to be seated. 
Round 1:
Cocktails: We started with Blood Orange Margarita & the Enchanted Apple. NOTE: they have an ipad to speed though the ordering process but if you want something not on their menu (we are bloody mary folks) you have to order the old fashioned way. 
We had the bone marrow & the sliders to start. 
Round 2:
2 Bloody Marys
Pork Belly Fried rice
Tarte Flambe
Round 3:
2 more Bloody Marys
& we split a Fleur burger. 
Round 4:
Vanilla Creme Brule
Chocolate cake pops

The Cockails. Love the blood orange Margarita..not so much the Enchanted apple. They were nice enough to take it off the bill. so KUDOS. Bloody mary's were good but they don't carry any of the infused vodkas so we didn't have the spice factor. 

The Food: All plates were ample for 2 or 3 to share. the marrow was great and even better when mixed with the fried rice. We could have had 2 orders of the sliders they were so good. Flatbread was decent and pretty big so it was well shared. 

Dessert: Cake pops? divine. Vanilla Creme Brule: fail. Never had a hot creme brule. Always cold with a quick sugar encrusted top. 

Fat Friendly: YES! great comfortable chairs for those of us with ample backsides. 
Noise level: they have 2 sections. 1 in the back which is beautifully appointed and spacious and not noisy at all. Front which is in the ""restaurant row"" area is lively and I'm pretty sure later in the evening is much noisier but it is great for people watching. 

Price: Party of 3: 6 cocktails. 4 rounds of food: Bill $160.00 which is just over 50.00 pp. Really not a bad price for a decent night out on the strip.

- I really was looking forward to the restaurant after looking at all the dishes on yelp. Turns out, they recently switched to a tapas concept. So, everything is smaller? 
-Also, turns out, the menu is divided into Italian, Spanish, Japanese, American and maybe one more country. I would think it be easier to do one cuisine really well. 
- I had a great paella before and thought, okay I'll try one dish from each region. I'll order the paella from Spain. It was a small tapas size but the entire dish was too salty.

Hits:
- the souffle was probably the most ordered dessert at the restaurant. It was delicious. The chocolate flavored dessert also comes with a beautiful scoop of pistachio ice cream. We also paired it with a two-scoop ice cream combo. We got MORE pistachio and blood orange. They both work with chocolate. 
-The seafood was delicious! From the yellowtail sashimi, the oysters over a bed of marbles and dry ice to the perfectly seared scallops. Wish they were entree sizes because I wanted more!
- the wait staff was quite attentive asking how everything was and if we wanted more of this or that
-the bread with the basic olive oil and balsamic blend was delicious. Simple is good. 

I hope they do have some entrees and mark it clearly on the menu. I'm fine with tapas but I was expecting a fuller meal before I found out about the changes. Also, there's only one unisex bathroom.

I thought the items we ordered were good.  

""In the Shower"" mac & cheese: cheese sauce is smooth, small chunks of lobster, nice crumbly crust on top  
Steak Frites: crust on steak is black and salty, fries have an interesting extra flavor (maybe they're fried in fat instead of oil?) 

As I said before, everything was good but not out of this world amazing.  Our waiter was very honest when we asked him what he recommended.  According to him, you shouldn't order the caesar salad or the field greens salad because you can get that anywhere.  Also, he said that the cuban sandwich is plain, as is the vegetable sandwich.

They have a dining area in front of the restaurant, but we opted for seating in the restaurant.  The décor and ambiance is very modern and classy.

After checking out the menu, we decided to order several small plates, a large plate and finish off with a dessert. We ordered:

- Caesar salad with parmesan lavash, truffle and anchovy.   The truffle and pieces set this apart from an ordinary Caesar.
- Ahi tuna tacos with ponzu chantilly, Serrano, and avocado cream.  Three small tacos that were so delicious.  Could have eaten a couple more on my own.  
- ""in  the shower"" mac n cheese, lobster and brunoise vegetable.  Delicious with good amount of lobster mixed in.
- Black angus sliders, with caramelized onions, bacon and frites.  Two juicy sliders that were very juicy and tasty.
- Guinness braised short ribs with rainbow carrots, pommee puree and coffee foam.  This had great flavors with the Guinness and coffee foam.  The ribs were a tad dry.  
- Grand Marnier soufflé with orange crème anglaise and orange-cardamom ice cream.  Wow, this was one amazing dessert.  It was delicious down to the last drop.  Had me licking my spoon.

Service was excellent.  We were talking about the wine cellar with our waiter and he even took us on a tour of the cellar after our meal.  That was cool!

Overall, a great overall meal.  With these small plates, we were able to share all these dishes.  Heck, we even shared the short rib entrée as well.",8qpFUPR1wd3uz8N1QaWj_A,5,3,5,R2zrgMgayneUqSRypKruBA
4233918,2013-08-08,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I became acquainted with Hubert through Top Chef (love the show!). I realized he has a restaurant in LV a few years ago, but wasn't able to dine there...so I made it a mission to dine there this time!

As usual...I made reservations through OpenTable. I arrived with my party 15 minutes early. They had us wait for our reservation time. I thought that was strange... I never ran into a situation where a restaurant would not seat you early. Once we were seated...I looked around and saw the dinning are was pretty much empty. So my question is.....why did I have to wait 15 minutes??

The menu is tapas style. It's similar to the way the Asian culture eats, but portions are a lot smaller...and more expensive. My expectations were very high. We ordered the special which included a 3 course meal and 4 tapas.

For the 3 course--fish tacos, filet mignon, and creme brulee.
For the 4 tapas--foie gras, corn soup, scallops, and octopus.

The most memorable were the foie, corn, scallops, and creme. In the foie, you could taste the love and attention put on the plate. From the sauce to the sorbet...it was something I have never had before. The corn soup was the equivalent to the lobster bisque at Capital Grille. Creamy and light, but you definitely have to share if you want to try other things! The scallops came with a bowl of smoke covering it. You could taste the smoke and sweetness of the scallop. There was also tomato water...smells like tomato, but doesn't really have a taste. The creme brulee was hands down the best I have had so far. Smooth and light. I did not feel guilty afterwards!

The low of the meal was the octopus. It was tender, but really salty and the sauce reminded me of jarred pasta sauce. (Sorry! But it's the truth...) I wish I ordered the shrimp dish instead.

Service was great. Food was spectacular. I think they need to dust out the place because halfway through dinner, my allergies kicked up. I wish there was more light (just my personal preference). The hostess confused me a bit with the 15 minute wait...again, I have never been told to wait when I arrive early to a reservation...especially when there is clearly room in the restaurant.

I would give it a 3 if I was in a bad mood. I look forward to dinning there again. Maybe I'll sit outside and people watch next time, haha.",eb_qEtuhI3qVTPKaxwQ0ow,1,0,4,R8zU_tMbvcUKyE-91i3Gxg

My sister and her hubs wanted to try this place since they're fans of Hubert Keller from his stint on Top Chef Masters, so we booked a late dinner on our Vegas trip a few weeks ago. Although the restaurant closes at 10:30PM, they assured us that was simply the deadline to put in your food order - which was nice since we arrived at 9:45PM and didn't want to feel rushed.  

We ordered almost everything that was stamped Keller's favorite on the menu (yes, I have no problem being a tourist) and he did not steer us wrong:
--White Onion Soup: They kindly split this into shot glasses for our party so we could share without any of the awkwardness - nice touch and we LOVED it!  Creamy, pitch-perfect onion flavor to get your tastebuds going.  I wanted a boat load more.
--Grilled Octopus: Tender octopus with good Spanish flavors.
--Angus sliders: Tasty bites - you can't go wrong with caramelized onions and bacon.
--Fleur Burger - I don't know what we were thinking ordering the sliders AND the house specialty burger (#burgermonsters) - but this was phenomenal.  I wanted to order it with the foie gras and truffles ($35 extra), but my table mates objected to my gluttonously wanting to buy a $70 burger.  Boo hoo - and fair enough - 'cause when it came, the burger was so utterly delicious and rich (due to the juicy wagyu beef and meaty abalone mushroom on top) that it was satisfying and decadent without the add-ons.  
--Lomo Saltado - The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare with a good sear and subtle glaze - but not a particular show stopper.  Strangely enough, we all loved the Peruvian fried rice that came as the side, which we hadn't paid much attention to when ordering.   
--Dessert: Orange Souffle - Nothing out of the ordinary but a very well executed classic french soufflé with a cream sauce that pleasantly finished off the meal. 

The decor is a bit wonky - feeling mall-ish with exposed brick and a giant painting of a blonde big boobed woman in a negligee with her head cut off overlooks the dining room (what is up with that) - but the food is the star here and really hit the spot!",sZs1baEmlXjTF88lxmrZtQ,1,1,4,04_RQr8SCzibMwPlZ2_TJw

We had a restaurant.com gift certificate which they accepted with no fuss, and so I feel we got an excellent value for our money, but since the average person is probably paying menu price, I am proceeding with that as my standard.

We opted to stay with the small plates so as to maximize the number of things we got to try.  The small plates menu is divided by region and we sampled the ahi tuna tacos, the tarte flambe (twice, it was by far our favorite), vegetable tempura, and one or two other items that I can't remember.  The tempura was the most disappointing, as it did not match the menu description and was no better than you'd find in an average Japanese restaurant.  Our cocktails were excellent from the blood orange margarita to the fleurtini, both light and refreshing but still immensely satisfying and certainly not lacking in liquor!

Service was fairly formal which fits with the tenor of the restaurant, but doesn't leave me with much to say other than it was fine.

They have a tapas special where you can get one of every tapas on the menu for $99.  You can also add one of every dessert for an additional $15.  I assumed that these would be amuse bouche size bites, but they were the full tapas serving (which was actually bigger than a tapas).  First, we were seated and told the waitress what we wanted.  She said that normally, they only serve Tapas on the ""patio,"" but that she would check with the manager.  They were very accommodating and left us where we were.  They then stopped us from ordering two tapas tasting menus because it would be too much food.  WHAT?  They saved us $115.  Mu husband doesn't eat pork, so they offered substitutions on the two pork items for him.  The food was delicious, but VERY RICH (as you might expect from French-influenced cuisine. Truffle popcorn was amazing, huge portion, but drenched in butter, so even though it was only the second dish they brought out, we couldn't finish it.  The onion soup was literally fantastic.  Four little tasting cups come per serving.  Ahi tuna tartare was good, but heavy on dressing, so fish flavor was a little lost.  The rock shrimp and noodles were very spicy. My husband felt the shrimp were overcooked--I thought it was OK.  Chimichurri flank steak was amazing-the silky chimichurri on marinated grass fed flank served medium rare was outstanding.  The charcuterie plate was Delicious and portion was huge!  My husband got the short ribs, and he loved them.  Delicate and wonderful hearts of palm salad.  The tossed green salad was also yummy. My husband had two glasses of wine, I had the cocktail flight (three fruity mini martinis).  They were sweet and string, presented beautifully.   They brought us 7 desserts (an extra for our anniversary), of which we ate about one bit each because we were stuffed. Best of all, service was unbelievably good.  Our main waitress packed food for us without asking (at a high end restaurant, where I would have been embarrassed to ask for that). We had a great time, and would go back in a flash.  Total bill $227 (alcohol was about $50, and the extra entree was $42).

I wanted to hit a bunch of places for LVRW, but i could only make it to this one plus dinner at Del Friscos. I read some previous reviews that this place used to be alot more high end, and made some changes to make this more of a tapas place with a bar. It definitely looked more price friendly and $20 for 3 courses was a steal!

The interior of the restaurant is absolutely stunning!! This restaurant is known for tapas which we didn't have. But I did order off the breakfast menu and the choices were adequate I had a quiche which cane with arugula on the side.

Saturday night at 8pm and the restaurant is pretty empty. This is Vegas, so maybe it gets hopping later. However, of the four tables in the place they sat one directly behind us, one directly to the left of us and one directly to the right of us. So much for an intimate evening. The blaring techno music doesn't add to the ambiance either.

The tasting menu is definitely the way to go, with one caveat - they are completely inflexible when it comes to making any changes, no matter how minor. Now I understand the very nature of a tasting menu is for the Chef to showcase his  favourite dishes where each course complements the last, but when your first course consists of raw meat (beef carpaccio) and raw meat (beef tartare), with no other options, and your wife doesn't eat raw meat, then there is a problem. Sure, I could have made a fuss and said she was allergic to raw meat, but that wouldn't have been completely true and people bandy around the ""allergy"" card way too much these days. On the flip side of the 2-person tasting menu is the 4-person tasting menu where shrimp and grits is one of the first course selections. We asked if one of the raw meats could be substituted with that, but were flatly told no. So we added an order of shrimp and grits at an additional cost so my wife could eat a first course.

For the most part the food was excellent. The hits - We loved the white onion soup (watch out, it's sweet!) The skirt steak was very tender and a surprising large portion for a tasting menu. Octopus, amazing! The scallop, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The misses -  ratatouille - just a mush of under-seasoned vegetables, completely out of place with the two other dishes served on that course. Carpaccio - all I could taste was the olive oil, it was swimming in it.

For all the positive comments about the wine list, I found the wine-by-the-glass selection to be very limited. On the fancy-schmancy digital wine list there were only 8 reds available by the glass. maybe there is another list that I didn't see, but the iPad was all that was offered to us.

Service was ok, she would disappear for periods of time and the courses were delivered without a moment to catch our breath in between.

Would I come back again, maybe. Is this a must-do while in Vegas? No.",0Bm2BA66nUSJtgpOI9XBPQ,5,3,3,iXWllyo0Dtn79EBApaKB2g

My husband and I came here for lunch and shared the Cuban sandwich with fries and it was perfect for a light lunch. Although the food was great, the service during lunch was lacking.

We knew within a couple of minutes what we wanted to order, but waited almost 10 minutes or more for him to come back to us. We were seated right behind the bar and watched as he aimlessly wandered around the bar and back room before he came back to us. Once we ordered my specialty drink and food, it took nearly 15 minutes before my drink was delivered and 30 minutes before the food was brought to us. Let me add that it took him around 10 minutes from the time he took our order before we watched him punching orders in on the computer, which was right in front of us and next to the bar, so we could only guess it was our order. By the time the food and my drink we delivered, our waiter never came to check on us, but the bus boy was great at making sure our water was filled. Once we finished eating, we literally waited nearly 10 minutes before our waiter asked if everything was okay, knowing we were clearly done eating as there was nothing left. We asked for the bill which he delivered a couple minutes later. When he gave it to us, we immediately gave him cash (needing change) thinking we could get out quicker. We watched him drop the tab off at the bar, then walk off and assist other customers. No bigs, right? Well, we then watched him chat with other employees, walk up stairs and aimlessly wander around. By the time you give a waiter or waitress the payment, that should be a sign you are ready to leave, but this waiter couldn't care.

So you know, there were 4 of us, so this was quite the undertaking. For reference, our waiter told us the table behind us had ordered The Feast as well...there were 7 of them.

Highlights:
parmesan paprika popcorn - salty, buttery and light, yummy, the only thing we kept on our table the entire time 
P.E.I. mussels - hadn't had them before, these were seasoned very well in a pesto-y sauce
maple glazed pork ribs - tasted good but were worth getting for the spectacular presentation...delivered in a glass dome full of smoke since they are smoked to order
cheese platter - nice selection of cow and sheep cheese, honeycomb went well with the softer cheeses
croque monsieur - was looking forward to this and was not disappointed, authentically French
filo wrapped shrimp - large shrimp wrapped in phyllo with a sweet salsa
pork schnitzel - well prepared with nice accompaniments, German potato salad, lingonberry jam, cucumber salad
burrata - this young mozzarella was soft and delicious, bread was lightly toasted 
onion soup - this is one dish from Fleur de Lys that made it onto Keller's new menu, smooth, creamy and very savory with a hint of truffle - my favorite thing on the menu...sadly, you only get 4 shots of it per order :(
scallion, lemon, basil risotto - perfect texture and a slightly lemony flavor, served very hot, as it should be
chocolate souffle and tabasco ice cream  - souffle was baked to perfect and our waiter added hot ganache tableside, the tabasco ice cream was interesting and tasted good with the souffle (much sweeter and creamier than I anticipated)
coconut soup - the coconut milk based broth was sweet and slightly thickened, tapioca pearls added substance and the sorbet was very flavorful
tiramisu - their version is classic and delicious, one of the desserts we actually finished, as we were obviously very full by the end (we were very full when we were 1/2 way through)

Less Yummy Items - since everything was pretty damn good:
Kushi oysters - those who tried them did not like but the presentation was great, they came on a block of ice with liquid nitrogen, the margarita sorbet that came with them was pleasant and could have gone well with other items
""in the shower"" lobster mac and cheese - macaroni was very similar to boxed Kraft or something like that, lobster chunks were there but everything else was off
pan con tomate - I don't like raw tomatoes and these were not done enough, others enjoyed the dish

The 30 or so dishes I have neglected to mention were all enjoyable. I also had a few nice glasses of pinot noir...they have a very extensive wine list and they still have the wine room from Fleur de Lys. To top off the meal we decided to inhale and drink absinthe. They have quite a selection and our server was knowledgable. He lit the 75 proof absinthe and inverted the cup into another full of some fruit nectars. We then used straws to inhale the alcohol vapor that accumulated in the original cup. It was interesting. I didn't actually drink the absinthe, which was called Mansinthe (Marilyn Manson's brand - really,) because it tasted like rubbing alcohol. I don't know how anyone drinks it.

So its been a couple of weeks since we've come back from Vegas, and the experience resonated with us in both a negative and positive way.  It was a nice dinner but I can't help but still be miffed about one thing - the BRUSQUE hostess!  The young asian girl that manned the front barely made eye contact with us, was so cold, never smiled, and was really good at making you feel unimportant.  We checked in with her for our reservations, and stepped aside about 2 feet away from her to wait as she asked.  A short moment later she was cued that our table was ready she calls out our last name towards the other waiting parties.  I mean really - we're no Brangelina, but didn't she just talk to us a second ago?  With a meager acknowledgement she brisked us away towards our table as we hurriedly followed behind her, barely being able to keep up with her pace.  She just dumped us at our table and she walked away mumbling ""Enjoy your meal.""  I don't care if she's having a bad night - that's just unexcusable and she should not be doing this job!  Anyway, let's get to the food, which thank gawd, was much better than the welcome wagon.

The Onion Soup Shooter Veloute quickly caught my attention on the menu.

Oh my, this was lovely to the senses as soon as it arrived to our table.  You pour the white creamy soup into these slender sipping glasses that help the wonderful mixed aroma of onion and truffle waft into your nose as you sip.  It was so good that I was worried that there might not be enough, but the huzbeau and I were able to have at least three shots each.

The tender Braised Hamachi rested on top of some very flavorful pickled shiitake mushrooms and the blanket of soy ginger foam on it rounded out each bite perfectly.  It was so light and delicate and I liked it almost as much as the soup. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=PcLlxY661ppzFROMrjho2w

We weren't too hungry, so we decided to share a Pepper Crusted Filet Mignon with a side of Fingerling Potato Puree. We ordered the meat medium rare and although it tasted fine, there were parts of the filet that were chewy.  The potatoes were just ok too.

Most reviewers seem to like the Sangria and I'm assuming that they had the red.  We ordered the white, and regrettably it really wasn't that great. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=nFbp8SFThRlQrDp7j2xkAw

At the front of the establishment, the brightly lit patio seating that surrounds the bar doesn't require reservations and is quite misleading as to how the restaurant really looks inside.   The dark interior had a very warm feel with its textured stone walls. The sculptural chandeliers and strategically placed recessed lighting played up the high ceilings very well.  Large parties are seated in well placed coves where they can have good conversation without disrupting those on a romantic date.

It was such a relief that our servers were not cut from the same cloth as the hostess and they were great.  I'd highly recommend a visit here just for the Truffled Onion Soup - but would hope that a friendlier and more professional hostess is working when you go!",6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg,11,9,3,S8XNGbKISXbypqPXsFtPXQ

The two of us ordered from the prix fixe menu while the third ordered from their regular menu bc she wanted steak. For the appetizer, I had the Potato Veal Ravioli.  I hope the original appetizer, which normally costs $23, comes in a larger portion than what i got bc my dish came with five little raviolis.  However, I have to say that they were damn good.  My friend had the Truffled Onion Soup, which was nicely presented.  It had a creamy texture to it (but not too rich); our only complaint was that it came lukewarm.  For our main dish, I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs, which came boneless and packed into a rectanglular shape.  Though it looked somewhat small, it was actually very filling as the meat was densely packed together.  It came with crunchy shredded leeks on top and cooked leeks on the bottom - delicious!  My friend had the Alaskan King Salmon, which was only slightly cooked, so it was nearly raw.  I wasn't a fan of the dish, but my friend enjoyed it.  I thought the portions were good as it came with two sizeable pieces of fish.  My third friend ended up ordering a $60 steak (rib eye), which was mouthwatering good, even without ketchup.  It came with a little metal pot of one of the best creamy mashed potatoes I've had in a restaurant.  For dessert, there was only one item listed, which was the Chocolate Tasting.  I thought it would be tiny, but it came with three different types of chocolate desserts.  We barely finished our two orders, and I was completely stuffed by the end of the meal.  Everything was well prepared, and I liked that the waiter would describe what was in every dish that was brought to us.  I usually dislike French restaurants, partly bc of the small portions, but I enjoyed Fleur de Lys with their normal-sized portions and pretty presentation.  Oh, a bread boy also comes around with a tray of breads to choose from - the French Baguette was my favorite, but I also like the Sourdough and Pretzel.

This, fellow yelpers, was not going through my mind when I arrived at Fleur.  Rather, it was going through my mind as I was leaving the restaurant.  I came here for lunch with my sister after an oh-so-tough morning of working on our tans at Mandalay Beach, so of course we were famished (tongue-in-cheek comment for those who missed it).  

We were in the mood for something light, but the food at Fleur was way lighter than we expected.  The tuna tacos with avocado cream were literally a bite each, so we're talking over $4 for one bite of food.  The tomato flambee caused food envy; a lady sitting at the table next to us actually asked us what we were eating and proceeded to order the same thing (refer to my posted pics to feel food envy for yourself).  The chicken croquette with garlic cream came with a flavorful, lightly dressed salad.  Every single bite of our lunch was so delicious it left us wanting more.  

To be fair, we did order starters, which are meant to whet the appetite, but I wish we didn't have to spend over $50 to leave hungrier than we came.",dKHZo6tdqcnlgBO7MHJ1Qg,1,2,3,_f-kUil6oPE0v91LF2U2vQ
4522160,2010-12-24,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Fleur is Keller's new incarnation of the old Fleur De Lys.  We were considering Robuchon, Le CIrque, Guy Savoy (you know, the REALLY fancy places, like Fleur De Lys was) for my birthday dinner, and I eventually though that we had such a wonderful time here last time, why not do it again.  Well, a little research and we realized that the old restaurant no longer existed, however, in its same space is a Keller small plates place with a few of the old standards (onion soup, fleurburger) and food that's still wonderful, but in small portions with MUCH smaller prices.  That kind of made the decision for me, because where else whee I could get phenomenal food in several courses for $120-$200, here I could do the same while picking and choosing from the entire menu for even less money.

We went a little crazy with the ordering.  My passionfruit cocktail was delicious, and my girl's cocktail sampler was great, the cherry one being both of our favorite.  Follow our

AMAZING:
Gnocci - these puppies were absolutely light and pillowy.  Amazing, but not lacking in flavor, as the tomato and pesto sauce underneath was strong and pungent and reduced-tasting.  Perfect.

Onion soup:  These little cups on heaven are much the same as the dish from the old Fleur De Lys, sans duck.  Only $4 on the menu, you MUST have these.  They taste of sweet carmelized onion and butter in a way that can only be described as what god would make if god were trying to capture the essence of the two ingredients for some kind of sick heaven-ambrosia nectar that only heaven-creatures get to sip.  Unbelievably delicious.

Italian style meatballs:  These things are mildly spicy, meaty-but-not-chewy, balls of gorgeousness only fortified by the salty minestrone-like garnish of red sauce beneath them.  They come three to an order, but I could've eaten like 9 before dropping dead of happy.

Yukon gold potato and veal ravioli :  Great veal reduction underneath.  The cardoons added a nice, kind of artichoke-y depth, and the micro greens on top give the dish a grassy, not-too-heavy layer.

Pork Schnitzel:  Expertly pounded breaded (my girl has a German grandmother and has lived in Germany) and fried, this schnitzel is great because it's a fried dish that doesn't feel like it's going to weigh you don.  The potato salad it comes with is great (if possibly only lacking a little more vinegar), and the lingonberry dollop on the plate makes you feel like you're finally eating something way better than the stuff you get at Ikea without having to fly to Scandinavia.

Braised Hamachi:  These pillows of fish also remind you of the gnocci in that they're cooked perfectly, which is just enough for your teeth to sink into flesh that is neither raw nor fully cooked.  Th soy-ginger foam is the perfect salty-earthy compliment to the umami of the pickles shitakes.

Nampol Meesa Wings:  Chef de Cuisine Steven Wolf told us these were invented by one of Fleur's chefs at the old Fleur de Lys to feed the 
kitchen staff when the rest of the birds was used and the wings were left behind.  To me, they taste like LA's Koreatown, or like they've been soaked/braised in soy, in a very good way.  The salt is balanced with a little bit of sweet, and the meat falls right off the bone into your mouth, while the chicken skin maintains just a hint of crispiness on the outside (thank god).  With a little more crispiness in the skin, these things are perfect.  These are a fun, delicious, if not highly gourmet answer to wings. Plus, it's great to see what chefs do with a part of the bird no one really wants to eat as anything but a wing.

GOOD:
Skirt Steak:  Steak was well-cooked, although chimmichurri isn't my favorite things in the world (parsley is a waste of an herb, if you ask me).  My indifference may have something to do with the fact that the dish was (appropriately) served near the end of the meal and by this point we were getting VERY full.

Brick Dough-wrapped prawns:  These were served compliments of the chef, which was lovely. Actually the most expensive small plate on the menu, the prawns were sweet, delicate, and delicious, and the tropical fruit salad on the bottom was so wonderful I ate it separately.  Together, however, the dish was a little less harmonious, and by that I only mean it didn't blow me away, but it was still great. I like my shrimp rather savory, but for people who dig a sweeter twist with your protein, go for it.

Maple Glazed Pork Ribs: These were presented under a glass dome, which holds in a bunch of smoke that eclipses the riblets until removed at the table, when the smoke dissipates away in a cloud of elusive backyard-ness. The ribs themselves are cut into little bites, are are kind of a mix between traditional Southern bbq and sweet, hoisiny, Chinese ribs, leaning towards the Chinese side and leaving your fingers, should you be plebian enough to use them, sticky.

Desserts were all phenomenal, but but the panna cotta and coconut soup RULE.  DON'T MISS 'EM!",8-4W2kWgly4368CqomkfmA,4,4,5,ypLXF0NaGnXCH6t9wTXo-Q

4556040,2009-04-09,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Fleur de Lys  was expensive, but well worth it for a few reasons. 

First, the food was delicious. 

The tempura halibut amuse-bouche was tasty and definitely made me optimistic about the meal to follow. I like that they give you a choice of more breads then i can remember before your meal, including these wonderful little pretzel breads. 

We started out with the ravioli which was rich and very good. My husband originally turned his nose up at my selection,but agreed to try at least a little bite ended up eating more then half of my raviolis!

We both ordered the surf and turf - fillet and lobster with asparagus and mushrooms. The fillet was tender and prepared perfectly medium, the lobster was great. Normally I kind of forget about what was served with my surf and turf but I really liked the asparagus and mushrooms too. They were prepared well, not mushy and seasoned well. We ordered the chocolate souffle which was also perfect and there wasn't a crumb left.  Portions were generally small but I expected that at a French restaurant and we didn't leave starving. 

The drink menu was very interesting. I love that a $$$$ restaurant had a cocktail with Pop Rocks on it's drink menu, which was great by the way. They also had an absinthe menu which I was completely stunned to see... more on that later. 

Second, the restaurant is beautiful and very romantic. It's a modern space with high ceilings but warm and plush and not sterile feeling.  I don't like it so dim that I can't see my food and thankfully that was not a problem here. 

Finally, the service was spectacular. Our waiter and most of the staff that helped us were fairly young and completely down to earth but knew what they were doing. There wasn't a finished plate on our table for more then a minute, never an empty glass. 

Our waiter was competent but very friendly. I wish I could remember his name! He answered all my questions politely.  I've been wanting to try Absinthe for a while but really had no idea how to order it. I asked him about the Absinthe and he explained to us the differences between them and recommended we try it as an after dinner drink. 

We went with the St. George absinthe mostly because we've toured the St. George facility in Alameda and after dinner our waiter brought around the cart and prepared it for us with the sugar and the absinthe spoon. It was very interesting. The absinthe service was great but perhaps absinthe isn't the drink for me. Our gracious waiter brought me a few pieces of that delicious pretzel bread while my husband happily finished off my absinthe.

This place rocks.

The 4 course prix fix menu was, for me, the way to go.  Yes, it was expensive [$89 w/o drinks], but let's think about this:  If you're going to Fleur de Lys, you almost have to forget about the price.  For 2-3 hours, you just have to get that out of your head and relax.  The 4 courses:

Truffle Onion Soup
Chorizo Wrapped Sea Bass
Braised Short Ribs with Guiness Reduction
Warm Chocolate Fondant Cake

The menu built quite a crescendo until you're knocked out by the decadent chocolate molton lava cake.  The start of the dinner was not light, by any means, but as he courses built, the flavors got more intense and the richness was there without being overpowering.

Great, great restaurant.  One of the best in Vegas.

Yes, it's pricey.  And if you're expecting them to feed you and dab the corners of your mouth with the money you spend, it would be understandable.

They have a tasting menu ($45) which consists of 6 preselected dishes. For us, it was: tuna tacos, onion soup, cod fritters, gnocchi with marinara and pesto, sliders, and a trio of creme brulee (earl grey, honey lavender, cookie dough). My favorites were the onion soup (with a touch of truffle oil!) and the gnocchi, which were so soft, light, and airy!

Because it was my birthday, they also gave us a vanilla panna cotta with huckleberry sorbet on the house, which was absolutely divine.

First, wanted to compliment the service.  The waitress asked if we had to make a show and I mentioned I had a flight.  Rather than a two or three hour experience, they were great at delivering the dishes promptly.  Although it would of been great over many hours, I really like the way they were accommodating without me even having to ask.

Although there are entree on the menu, they also have small plates separated by territory.  My friends and I shared several:
--   Ahi tuna tacos.  I love tuna and the tuna was perfect.  The crispy taco was a very neat touch.
--  Black angus sliders.  Maybe the highlight of the dinner.  While everyone has sliders these days, these were fantastic.  Larger than I would of expected and the caramelized onions and bacon came together wonderfully with the meat.
--  Tarte flambee.  Probably the most disappointing dish.  No flambee and overall not much flavor over the bread.
--  Seared foie gras.  I love good foie gras and this foie gras was prepared perfectly, the other highlight of the evening.
--  BBQ pork ribs.  A dish that often goes bad at small plates restaurants, done perfectly at Fleur.  Ribs were tender, flavorful and meaty.
--  Pork belly fried rice.  Okay, another highlight of the evening.  Surprisingly, it was not the pork belly that made the dish great but the flavor of the rice.  
--  Green papaya carpaccio.  After the tarte, one of the weaker dishes.  Just not much flavor, the carpaccio did not come through.
--  Brownie lollipops. I am not a big sweets person, but these were very popular with our table.

With Julian Serrano, two fantastic options for small plates in Vegas.  Both are fantastic, Fleur maybe a little more consistent but some great dishes in both places.",tkAjiVsQEhcVjc-0CKzcNg,3,2,5,7DixFfyOrf_qGae-lQwaYg

Note about the ""star"" rating ... I gave Fleur five stars. You might ask why given that some of the dishes (as explained below) were just okay, and the reason is that the other dishes were really, really good. Ultimately, I like to judge restaurants and food based on whether I'll remember them ... and I'll definitely remember the beef tartare tacos, veloute, and ricotta gnocchi.  In addition, the service was excellent.

Had dinner at Fleur before seeing Le Reve at the Wynn. Decided on the tasting menu (""Tastes from Around the World""), which was reasonably priced (in a relative sense, given how much - and easily - you can pay at the other celebrity-chef restaurants around Las Vegas) ... four courses plus dessert (amounting to ten dishes, and I added escargot to boot):

Course 1 -

1. Beef Tartare Tacos - Terrific dish. I'm a big fan of beef tartare; the taco shells added texture; and the beef was great.
 
2. Truffled Beef Carpaccio - Good dish. But I've had the same at other good restaurants; not bad by any means ... again, a good dish, just not necessarily memorable.

Course 2 -

3. White Onion Soup Veloute - Terrifc dish again. This was my personal favorite, memorable in a way that the beef carpaccio might not be; the veloute was rich and creamy, with a trace of truffle.

4. Gyoza - Mediocre dish.  This was my least favortie dish; the gyozas were somewhat uninspired with neither the pillowy-ness of boiled dumplings or the crispy skin of potstickers. 

Course 3 -

5. Ricotta Gnocchi & Braised Short Rib - Very good dish. I really enjoyed the gnocchi (and I've had a lot lately ... with my favorite being at Osteria Mamma in Los Angeles), especially the nice pan sear; short ribs were also tasty.

6. Grilled Octopus - Okay dish. Not quite as good as the gnocchi, but better than the gyoza.

Court 4 -

7. Grilled Skirt Steak Lyonnaise - Very good dish. The steak was cooked well (as is properly, not as in burnt to death) ... always enjoy steak and potatoes.

8. Diver Scallop - Good dish. Nicely cooked scallops, but don't remember the pork belly.

9. Ratatouille - Very good dish.  I really enjoyed the ratatouille; I recall another review saying the vegetables were mushy, but I found the whole dish to be spot on.

Dessert -

10. Brioche Beignets - Terrific dish. Light, fluffy pilows of goodness ... again, I thought the beignets were terrific (but as a word of caution to set expectations, these are different than the beignets you might expect at Cafe Du Monde).

Additional Dish -

11. Escargot - Good dish. Friend had never had snails, so added an order; good dish, but I also don't eat snails often enough to add any insight.

Service - Service was friendly and professional; have nothing but good things to say about the staff. 

Atmosphere - Comfortable dining room, with an upscale but still casual feel.  For more casual, try the food court, and for fine dining, try Aureole next door.",Kvbr3lQ9gp3XYlnI8SNRiA,5,4,5,EaFTZydjwD2MvewMijmdWg

We prefer to sit inside the restaurant rather than out near the bar--it's more enjoyable to be away from the casino foot traffic. 

Fleur serves small plates, but you can also order a normal meal. We aren't tapas fans, so we usually order steaks, which are always cooked perfectly.

Amuse Bouche: Unfortunately, I've forgotten what was served as the amuse - perhaps a testament to the amuse bouche being forgettable. 

Truffled Onion Soup with Duck Ragout and Black Truffles: 2 words = Simply Divine! 5 stars for an excellent dish... I'd come back over and over for this.

Filet Mignon Topped with Sautéed Foie Gras, Black Périgord Truffles, and Red Wine Essence: Another great dish combining 3 of my favorite elements (filet mignon, foie gras, and black truffles). My only complaint was the sauce and foie gras was a bit too salty for my taste. All in all, though, this was worth the additional $25.

Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut with Shiitake ""Macaroon"", White 

Pan Seared Duck Breast with Chestnut Puree, Onion, and Ginger Gastrique: 4 stars. This was not bad. The puree was an interesting combination in terms of taste + texture. The duck was a bit salty. I liked the presentation of this course.

Passion fruit and coconut sorbet on a streusel crust in a coconut soup with tapioca balls, strawberry, kiwi and plantain: 3 stars. This wasn't bad. It tasted a bit like some Asian desserts I've had before. 

Dessert Trio of Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal of Bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: 3.5 stars. The peanut butter milkshake was a bit too rich, but I liked the Bailey's ice cream. The addition of the crushed peanut butter brittle was a flash of brilliance.

Tray of Chocolates: We finished with a generous assortment of chocolates and truffles on the house. These were not bad but nothing to write home about.

Whew! This was a ton of food.

There were thousands of fresh, pink roses on the wall, which our server said are changed daily. He retrieved and presented me with a pink rose, which I got to keep. 

Service in general, however, wasn't great. I had expected to be pampered a bit more given the price range of the establishment, but our table was somewhat neglected at times. Also, it took almost an hour wait between some courses for the food came out, making for a 3 hour long meal. 

Summary: The truffled onion soup and filet mignon with foie gras are the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars. (Minus one star for service and a few mediocre courses.) Total bill = ~$200 for 2.",Z9lGVOdivMvGIK_9IGNfOw,4,1,4,NrNnkd3oQMPMoE4ZxLMi1A
4712195,2014-07-02,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Nothing about this restaurant came together for me. The only thing I really truly enjoyed was the carpaccio, the steak tartare had the promise of being good, being mixed tableside by a waiter to the customer's taste, but it was desperately in need of salt. My pork belly lo mein was overly sweet, the belly just sat there, it's flabby fatty self, with no acid or anything to cut it. It was just sweetness and starch and fat, and far too much of all those things. Dessert probably ok, in that I forgot what I had, so it must not have been that bad. 

Food aside, the experience leaves a lot to be desired. I've spent some time trying to figure out what this place is. Bar seating flanks the outside of the restaurant, with the sort of chairs that are nearly impossible to push in unless you do some kind of weird half seated tiptoe thing, In a bar where people may choose to stand, they make sense, here in a restaurant, they don't. My place setting was missing a fork, which is inexcusable at this price point. Drink orders were completely bizarre, involving picking out my selection on an iPad, which I then had to turn around and show to the server to actually place my order. Why can't I just send the order to the bar directly from the app? This actually takes more time than a normal cocktail list. It would make sense for wine where you want to be sure your selection is communicated clearly, but it doesn't work at all here.

It also doesn't help that, for as beautiful as the interior is, you're still sitting in a casino and there's some dude at the bar outside whose idea of Vegas is Vince Vaughn movies from the 90's and all the shouting that goes along with it.

There are a few good points here, but they're hard to pick out in an otherwise bizarre experience. Concentrate less on whimsy and more on food and this place might work.",5sKfRMI2-kjW06VhvhII_A,2,1,2,4JRYF0D-BJm3PNkO8yTrnQ
4715225,2016-09-16,6,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Being in Vegas gives you really good options to visit a well known chef's restaurant.  Most of the big names have their place on the strip.  I like to think I am a pretty basic guy and can be satisfied at most (if not all) places to eat; my last review was for a buffet okay?.  I would also say that my mind set is probably focused around a statement such as, ""why would I want to pay that much for a meal?""  I like a good value (this is true), but sometimes, you get what you pay for.  This place was great!

Breakfast is probably my favorite meal of the day, and I also at least know that breakfast and lunch are more reasonably priced than dinner (double score for me).  Fleur opens at 11am and is in Mandalay Bay.  Upon being seated you realize how beautifu this place is, so make sure to walk around the whole restaurant and snap some pictures.  I ordered the Carnitas Hash; it was outstanding.  Everything on the plate was cooked to perfection: just the right amount of char and seasoning while plated very beautifully.  This was one time that I didn't mind waiting for my Yelp Elite S.O. to take her fill of food pictures before the meal because I was taking pictures too. My S.O. ordered the Fleur Omelet; it was stuffed with asparagus, tomatoes, and mozzarella.  After tasting some of her dish, I had to restrain myself from stealing all of her ""crispy potato cakes"" (to call these tater tots would be like calling a race car a daily driver).  I typically cannot eat restaurant tomatoes because of how tasteless they are, but that was not the case here: Very flavorful.  The wait staff was really friendly and professional as would be expected, but don't always get; they did a great job: Bravo!

The take away from me is to remember to treat myself once in a while to a very nice meal.  This was a great combination of great environment, food, and I was able to share it with a beautiful woman.  This inspired me when I got home to start up a ""fine dining"" spare change and money jar to fund our next star chef/restaurant visit.

I've eaten at FDL in San Fran once, and the vegas location is much more modern and subtle in ambiance. I was there in May for the summer prix fixe menu which was an underwhelming experience in fine dining standards. Pompous service, some of the food didn't live up to the price and generally it was just trying too hard to be as fancy as possible.

Took my Mom there on my most recent visit and it was a truly excellent dinner. I think the 4 stars is an average of my experiences. The best things I ate there were the onion soup with duck ragout (amazing), lobster salad, and colorado lamb loin. The food is very modern with a classical french twist.

My only complaint would be the pretentiousness of the wait staff. I prefer a personal touch with waiter service and it just doesn't exist here. Both times I went there are 4 or 5 people serving you throughout the meal in an unorganized fashion. Although the service was prompt I found it invasive at times and severely lacking any personality, like they just say the same exact things to every table.

On top of these 4 courses, my friend and I shared an order of the veal sweetbreads, which came with a poached egg and spinach and apple salad.  I LOVE sweetbreads and they were cooked PERFECTLY.  So we essentially had 5 courses.  I also took a couple bites of other people's souffles, and they were pretty good.  The Gran Marnier souffle was better than the chocolate souffle.  

The meal ended with an assortment of petit fours.  There was a classic French canele, some sort of passion fruit gummy thing (I didn't try it), a homemade marshmallow (forgot the flavor) and a macaron (forgot the flavor as well).  Shows you how impressive they were if I couldn't remember half of them.

Service was impeccable.  The bread girl was very courteous, offering 4 different types of bread.  I will have to say while it was good, the pretzel bread at Cut is way better.  Our server Marcus was very attentive and patient with us.  He was very helpful and he and the expediters explained each course and each different dish thoroughly and patiently.  And Marcus poured the wine label up!!!  I learned from my wine instructor in culinary school (who I believe by now is a master sommelier) that proper wine pouring etiquette means pouring the label up as well as slightly twisting the bottle as he raised the bottle from the glass so it doesn't drip.

I started by the tarte flambée (a French inspired flatbread). Not bad but nothing to get excited about and very Americanized. So after a first base hit on the appetizer I decided to consult yelp photos/menu to help me decide what to have next. I quickly came across the angus beef sliders which looked awesome. They were piled high with cheese, bacon, pickles, and served with seasoned potato wedges. 

So I ordered that (not so healthy, I realize!) and was supposed to receive three small beef sliders with nothing but bun and bacon, and there was a tiny cup of regular cut fries - and when I say tiny cup it as TIMY... About the size of a shot glad with like 3 fries or something.

the entire theme for the courses seemed to be of bugs, where the plates were dressed to resemble a bug. some palate cleansers had leaves for ears, indicating it was bug, etc. one dish that stands out was the brioche, there were 3 little pots, and out spurted brioche! they were so delightfully fluffy, and it just melted in your mouth as you ate it. *heaven*. the food left a good impression, though i cant remember what we enjoyed, it was one of the best dinner i had, and definitely an experience that i would love to share with others!",-YUFeE4jC0JtfTe3QEMsGA,2,2,5,9j9067ck_OE29FuE9XYoFg

The Truffle Onion Soup that everyone raves about was good, but that was about the only thing that was really GOOD for a restaurant of this kind. I expected to be wowed.. but came out dissatisfied. We had the four course pre fixe and my second course was the divers scallops and they turned out to be salty. I told the waitress that they were salty and she said that it was a new dish and she would tell the chef. (nothing against the waitress.. our service was good). 
My main course was the halibut and it was nice and crunchy on the outside, but nowhere close to being moist or soft on the inside. I hate overcooked fish and this was close to overcooked for me. Also, again the corn base.. forget what it was called was salty! 
Dessert - my friend got the chocolate cake and that was good.. gentle flavors and not too sweet. I got the panna cotta desert with a couple of sorbets on top. The panna cotta itself was good, but one of the berry sorbets was overpowering and too tart and didnt mix well with the peach juice base. 
Also, for some reason they advertize a $59 early evening prefixe on their website, but we went in at 6:15 and asked the waitress, she knew nothing about it. Instead we got the Elegance pre fixe for $89.

The pineapple carpaccio was great! It was very fresh and sweet. It was served with cilantro granita as well as lime sorbet. The cilantro may sound strange, but it was delicious! I highly recommend this dessert as it was very refreshing and light.

I believe I was given a lunch menu as I did not see a lot of the items I had seen on their online dinner menu, so this could have shadowed my experience. I ordered a Fleuritini, and that was delicious, and the truffle onion soup, which was also very good. I ordered the spicy salty hot wings which were themed to be thai flavored. These were exactly as described, salty, spicy, hot, but with no defining flavor, it left me wanting a common flavor to unite those elements. 

My brother received the sliders w/pear, and the cod fritters. While he liked the sliders, the cod fritters tasted fishy, something that should never happen in a establishment like this. He did not eat more then 2 fritters and I did not eat but 2 of the 5 wings.

When the server came back he was very attentive and asked why we did not like the dishes. I explained that I was expecting more flavor from the wings, and he explained they are ""thai"" style so maybe I just dont like that (although I love thai food). Upon hearing about the fritters he was very perplexed and returned to the kitchen with our plates, we had asked for our check.

Upon returning he had removed both the wings and the sliders (on accident, but as he advised it saved us more $) and apologized for us not liking the dishes. It seemed as if they had complaints on the cod fritters before, and the server said they may take them off the menu because of this.

Started off with the Ahi Tuna Tacos and they were okay. They were tiny and the taco shells were pretty thick.

Moved on the the short rib lasagna and it was excellent. The dish was light and tasty!

The Tarte Flambee was also perfect with the perfect mix of flavors! The cheese was the highlight of this dish, very fragrant.

The croque monsieur, like the rest of the meal, was top notch. Despite being a very small, the sandwich is very rich with flavors, especially the cheese. This makes the small sandwich very filing!

The exotic panna cotta was okay. 

Service was excellent throughout the meal. The only drawback is that it's very close to the casino and dining can be in front of the public view!

We decided to try a bunch of things including the Madrid style tripe and tongue stew, the green papaya carpaccio (Wagyu beef, toasted peanuts and Thai chiles), the foie gras duo, the crab cake with a mango sauce and a side of wild mushrooms. We would have ordered the bone marrow but they were out of it. Boo-hoo. The foie gras was solid and our favorite dish. So smooth and succulent... melted in our mouths. The tripe and tongue stew was good too but the crab cake and the beef salad seemed a little water logged. Both dishes were soggy and the flavor was lost. There was literally a pool of water at the bottom of both dishes. Presentation was beautiful and service was great. Someone was always coming over to refill our water and take our dishes away. 

The restaurant itself is very open and you can look out into the casino and people watch if you're seated in the front area. We were seated towards the back which is a little more private but what was annoying is that Fleur was playing good music but it was overpowered by the casino music. Anyway, picky, picky.

No.  Not even in the same league.

We ask to sit inside as we assumed it would be quieter than the patio area opposite the loud rock band that were murdering some old classics across the walkway.  Instead, we find that the room is dominated by a large crowd of obnoxiously loud guests, clearly much to the chagrin of all the other guests in the restaurant.  The hostess just laughs at the fact that we chose to come inside and it is louder there.

The wait staff were not much more impressive.  Our waitress was somewhat apathetic.  In between courses, the table did not get cleaned and the drops of sauce and various crumbs just continued to build up.  Our table was not bussed between courses, and it seemed that the staff expected us to eat our fish dishes using our fig jam covered silverware off dirty plates.  When we had complaints about the food (see below), there was no acknowledgement to the problem, let alone an apology.  We also ordered 7 dishes and only ever received 6 of them...

All of this could have been overlooked had the food been spectacular, but it was not.  I very much doubt that Hubert Keller would put out that kind of food had he himself been there; clearly there were problems with quality control.  

By dishes:
The fig flambee (which is a flatbread - who knew?  Just assumed flambee on a french menu meant that it had been flamed.  Would have been nice if that had been mentioned when we ordered it) was dominated by goat cheese; the fig was battling for attention and the pancetta was essentially non-existant.  
The tartar was bland (clearly had not seen a hint of seasoning), even with the addition of the accompanying sauces etc. and the meat appeared somewhat low quality in and of itself.
The seared shrimp was OK.  Nice heat, shrimp cooked well. 
The hamachi was, in my opinion, the best dish of the night: the foam was outstanding and the pickled shiitake were sumptuous.
The salt wings were fantastic, but I can get a whole bunch of those for the same price at our local Thai restaurant.
Then came the risotto: as soon as it arrived on the table I wanted to hold the plate upside down over my head as it was clearly way too stiff.  Tried it anyway, and it tasted like bland mush with leaves added.  Underseasoned, no creaminess at all, and just horribly overcooked.  Had to send the dish back.  Thankfully they took it off the tab.

All in all, I wouldn't bother going back unless I heard that the quality control problems had been addressed.  When you are paying $70 a head you deserve better, and there is much better out there on the strip.


P.S.  Just checked out the rating graph on Fleur - was getting great reviews until the beginning of September, at which time the ratings have plummeted.  Coincidence?  I think not.

Onward to Tech.

Upon arrival our Server presented an iPad with the menu.  What a great way to quickly browse a menu and gather details.  Additionally, the iPad immediately felt cleaner than the typical menu that passes patron to patron.  I wish every venue would use iPads, or Galaxy Tabs for those of us (myself included) that prefer Android.  Now for the bad news.  Upon selecting menu items, the app states ""To place order, share this screen with Server"".  Being entirely honest, 10 minutes were lost searching the menu for the ""share"" functionality.  Screen after screen, button after button.  Problem solved - who would guess ""...share with Server"" at Fleur actually means physically show the iPad screen to the Server!  Half-Hearted Tech?  When ""Share"" is presented in an application, most people anticipate sending the order from the iPad to the POS terminal (or Facebook, or well, wherever!).  The ordering confusion may only apply to some of us, but one of two things needs to happen: the verbiage on the screen must change, or the integration to the POS terminal must be completed.

I love the small plates concept because that means I get to try a variety of food. However, it does get spendy...especially if you include drinks and dessert. DO NOT SKIP THE DRINKS OR DESSERT here! 

White Sangria - BEST sangria I've ever had. Hands down. I could have drank a barrel full of it. However, when I went back the next night for a repeat experience, it wasn't mixed the same. It was a bit of a letdown, but it was still good and it won't deter me from coming back in the future. And I'm definitely going to try to replicate it at home.

Dessert - Grand Marnier Souffle with Orange-Cardamom Ice Cream. To die for. The souffle with the ice cream are the best pairing of foods I've ever had. I still dream of it. You know that cake that's called ""'Better Than Sex Cake""? The name of this dish should be changed to ""Better Than Sex Souffle"". Seriously. It is. 

We also had:

Tarte Flambee - It was described as sort of a thin-crust pizza....total understatement. It was crispy and light and absolutely perfect. I loved it. FIrst favorite small plate.

Ceviche - Yum. But they didn't have enough chips. But I still ate it by the fork full. 

Black Angus Sliders - Yum. Perfect proportion of bun to onions to beef. Third favorite small plate. 

Biggest surprise = Creamy Polenta. Seriously. I could have eaten a vat of it. I'd never had polenta and it was my sister's random order. But we scraped the bowl clean. Second favorite dish. 

""In the Shower"" Mac & Cheese - Meh. Had to order it since it was a Top Chef recipe. Least favorite dish of all. Wasn't bad, but I'd opt for something else in the future. 

We had such a great meal, we returned the next night for the white sangria and souffle. We also tried the coconut almost cakes...they were ok, but pale in comparison to the souffle.

I was expecting classical French cuisine but was pleasantly surprised by the food from around the world menu concept. After asking the server his opinion and taking into account that Chef Keller selected it as one of his favorite dishes, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles.

When it arrived I was amazed at the portion size, but that was about the only thing that kept me from rating this one star. 

The chicken wasn't fried in a traditional method, but instead was deboned and battered which I wouldn't have necessarily taken issue with if it had be done well, but it wasn't. The batter was so thick and hard that it fell off the chicken as soon as the knife touched it. The overwhelmingly thick batter also caused the severely overcooked chicken to taste eerily similar to boiled chicken, it was unpleasant to say the least. 

The side of collard greens had a nice depth of flavor, but were over salted which oddly enough still wasn't enough to make the chicken taste like something.

I will admit that jalapeño cornbread waffle was really delicious, but unfortunately it wasn't enough to save the meal. 1/3 doesn't cut it especially when the protein was so abhorrent.

I ordered a enjoyed a wonderful glass of sangria ($10), and we ordered the croque monsieur, lobster mac & cheese, sliders, and meatballs. Our server had suggested we order 3-4 selections each, but we decided to start with these four. Let me tell you, it was plenty! We were very full by the end. The croque monsieur ($9) (a grilled cheese sandwich with ham) was small, but was cut in two and we each had half. It was yummy, and I loved the mustard and little pickles. We could have easily each had our own it was so good. I thought the bowl of lobster mac & cheese ($18) was a rather large portion, and at any other restaurant I would have called that a meal for one. It was tasty, but I have to admit that I have had better elsewhere. There were only two black angus sliders with a few frites ($12). They were decent, but nothing to write home about and left me wanting more which didn't help when five tiny meatballs and a little bit of broccoli ($14) arrived. The last two items were a little bit disappointing given the price, though both were tasty and I would order them again.

We ordered two deserts-- the cheesecake with strawberries (such lovely presentation), and the affogatto (bailey's ice cream) made with liquid nitrogen tableside. I couldn't resist and both were absolutely delicious and watching our server make it was fun. We were also brought a little plate of some sort of chocolate moouse with kahlua foam (I think) with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate with chocolate syrup. What a nice touch and ending to the meal.

I thought the amount of food was perfect, but three deserts was a little indulgent and one would have been plenty following the other four items. There was a little issue with the Restaurant.com certificate (our server accidentally charged the full amount and then the reduced amount), but said the original one would be reversed. After a few days the money returned to my account. None-the-less, it was a lovely pre-anniversary meal and we will definitely return on our next trip. We are already looking forward to another croque monsieur!",2831Zln_jbAeTpcE8p1OKQ,2,1,5,TwJ2ndsPNyEFYOHXwP4KTQ

i had an awesome dining experience here last saturday night. everything was perfect. ordered off the lion king prix fixe menu and was impressed by every single bite. simple yet very elegant.

first course: the truffled onion soup was amazing. so rich and creamy and so unlike any onion soup i've ever had before. and the serving style was also very unique. tres chic. some people from our group ordered the organic salad and that was good as well. the polenta croutons were so delectable!

second course: stout braised beef short ribs. probably one of the best short ribs i've ever had. it was presented with a leek fondue. every bite was mouth watering. my taste buds are getting excited even just thinking about it now. some ordered the salmon and that was equally tasty. 

third course: chocolate celebration. a peanut butter something shake, presented cleverly in a tiny glass with a straw; a chocolate fondant cake; bailey's ice cream. some of us ordered the chocolate banana souffle that was served with warm chocolate ganache. lip-licking delicious. what an awesome ending for a perfect meal. 

we ordered chardonnay with our dinner. and for 8 people, we paid $70 each including gratuity. not bad for a spectacular meal.",rAGR4nggiBMKj5eqv9WW_g,1,1,5,-PjUBUacBg5njMd6KPKtow

We ordered from the 4 course prix fixe menu, every course was presented beautifully with a detailed explanation of the preparation of each item. They even threw in a surprise free 5th bite-size course. The breads are so delicious. The deserts were fantastic. The wines were very good and the selection varied.

Fleur is not the scary uptight high end restaurant you'd expect in the middle of Mandalay Bay; it's much more relax and fun for the night out with friends and family.  This is not to say that it's a cheapy place; it's definitely not that.

If you have a group of 6 or more, make a reservation for dinner and have ""The Feast"" where you basically eat the menu... the whole menu.  But for the foie gras and the caviar (which are super pricey), The Feast comes with everything on the dinner menu and is more than enough to generously feed 6-8 people and not leave room for you to seek out more afterward. 

Unlike some of French places, none of their dishes are overly heavy or saucy.  The mild light favors allow the different contrasting tastes of each dish to shine on its own.  Every dish is presented beautifully with lighter fares interjected between the more flavorful ones.  They usually serve 3 dishes at a time, grouping them to give you enough varieties to keep you guessing.  The fishes are light and delicate, the meats of tender and perfectly prepared.  And you definitely have to leave room for array of desserts that you can end the night with.  (The panna cotta and pineapple carpaccio were my favorites.)  

Be prepare to sit for 2-3 hours and enjoy your meal. The staff is super attentive and knowledgeable.  And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).  Definitely a recommend.",1_-iBBQJycLVMVpjHhK5lw,1,1,5,vyQxM5P2pUG1g5pEZPZJNQ

Tuna tacos ($13) - 4 stars for taste; tuna sashimi in a tiny taco...literally one bite each taco with 3 tacos total.  Tasty, but pricey for what it is & for it's size.  Not sure if it's worth it.  This will surely rack up the bill..we kept ordering more b/c it was so small.

Fig flambe ($11) - 3 stars; Good portion size. Nice warm, slightly crispy crust with blue cheese & figs spread on top. I like cheese in general, but I felt that the blue cheese flavor was too strong.  If they had spread less cheese on here, it would be 4 stars.  But if you love blue cheese, this might be a good dish for you to order.

burrata ($16) - 4 stars; Cheese was soft in texture and spread nicely on the crunchy toast.  Wish they gave more cherry tomatoes with the dish though.

Gnocchi ($16) -  3 stars; Good portion size .  Pasta was soft and sat in a nice tomato based sauce.  Tasty, but the sauce was a bit on the salty side

Almond panna cotta ($10) - 5 stars; MUST GET dessert.  My favorite of all the tastings & the best panna cotta i've had.  The tart raspberry sorbet compliments the cream well, and it has nice almond crunches with each bite throughout the dessert.  I would come here just to order this dessert.

Tiramisu ($10) - 4 stars; nice and creamy with a slight rum taste at the bottom..yum! Served with biscotti dipped in chocolate. Good, but not as good as the almond panna cotta.",53EWBX2QGISTDZJ1NZfyrA,3,1,4,LnGFpsY4YtQchYeepbLVYQ

The desserts alone deserve five stars. That said...

I'm an insanely picky eater. I clearly don't have the tastes or palate for super fine dining. We got the tasting menu for $135 (for two people, pretty reasonable). The first course was the wagyu carpaccio and ahi tuna tacos. I bit into the carpaccio and got a big mouth full of carrot. I *hate* carrots. That killed it for me. The tuna tacos were good even if they were only 2 bites. 

The second course was bone marrow and onion soup. The only meat I consume regularly is white meat chicken and ground beef. So you want me to eat the innards of a bone from an unknown animal? No thank you. In the spirit of pushing my boundaries, I tried it anyway. And literally gagged when I put it in my mouth. The texture was like a squishy scallop. Ew. The onion soup was very tasty. I would eat that again.

The third course was grilled octopus and spicy shrimp and grits. The grits were a little smoother than I'm used to, but had a good flavor. The shrimp were spicy without  being overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the octopus. It wasn't chewy, but also wasn't my speed. Boy dug into it quite happily, but he's pretty much my polar opposite. The list of things he won't eat is very, very short.

The fourth course was skirt steak and mac & cheese with shrimp & lobster sauce. I was super excited for the mac & cheese. It ended up being way, way too fishy tasting for me. If it had just been shrimp or lobster, it would've been fine. The end product fell short. Say what you will about proper steak cookery, but I like mine dead and deep fried. This one was still mooing. Again, Boy was all over it. Now to the fabled desserts.

The dessert on the tasting menu was the beignets. We added the creme brulee because I love creme brulee. It was definitely worth the extra $10. The beignets were surprisingly light and not doughy. There wasn't too much sugar on them either. The creme brulee was wonderful. It was another case of for the sake of the relationship, we'll share the last bite.

Had it not been for the desserts, I probably would've given the whole experience 2-3 stars. Thank you, dessert.",1UiVMCuVLTm6bOnn9h2R2Q,3,2,5,ada7tOPjdUuSlyIx8SSVQw
4966888,2014-02-09,4,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Came here before touring the Shark Reef at Mandalay Bay. I wish now that I would have stopped on the walk down from Vdara at a different location, rather than putting faith in Mandalay Bay to have a restaurant which would suit my taste and my mother's. The options are very limited at this hotel/casino. You're either going to spend $200+ on a decent meal or end up choking down kid friendly hamburgers and fries. Fleur is really the only place for adults which doesn't come with bank breaking prices, and it really doesn't offer anything more than life-sustaining calories. 

I've got to say that service is boarding on deplorable. Watching the wait staff wander around passing nasty looks for the first 15 minutes of my visit, I began to feel like I was in an episode of Restaurant Nightmares. I have no idea what the big problem was, but it seemed to be revolving around some half-naked hostess who was openly flirting with what appeared to be a manager. Scandalous!! Whatever the drama was, it was impeding on my order getting taken, so I was far more pissed than entertained. By the time my server finally appeared at the table, I was about ready to just leave and go hungry until dinner. Thankfully, he showed up right before the final straw came down.

The next star reducing event was being told that the two sandwiches my mother and I wanted were BOTH sold out. WTF!? I asked the waiter how that was possible when there was still 2 hours left in the lunch service, and he explained it was very difficult for the kitchen to predict the kind of traffic the restaurant would see at lunch. He made a pretty decent case, but it just minimally reduced my frustration. Perhaps had he been a little more attentive when my mother and I first arrived, I would have let the mishap slide a bit more easily.

We ended up ordering the pork belly flatbread and the hot dog. I can't say either was bad, but neither were they memorable. They both go into the ""Ate to Live"" category. Nothing special or noteworthy. Just another meal to keep my blood sugar and energy level even.

If you find yourself at Mandalay Bay and hungry. Well, I'm sorry. Your choices kind of suck unless you have deep pockets, are under the age of 5, or think you would enjoy the before versions of restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares. My advice, eat at a different location on the strip.",QDlW-vc4YW0gw5MWRN_5dg,4,2,2,E8JUqghpnKapk6IdBkkmUg

There are ample parking at the Mandalay Bay's hotel parking lot, by either valet or self-park. There is also parking at the Luxor, with a quick walk across the bridge through the Shops at Mandalay Bay which connects the two resorts. Fluer is located south of the casino floor along restaurant row at the Mandalay Bay!

From the moment you walk down the long hallway of this beautiful hotel, all of the restaurants in restaurant row are lookers! I have  heard from friends you could just pick one and would not be disappointed! After all, it is a 5-star hotel! I would rate my experience at Fleur as a 5-star! Dress code could be described as beautiful, business, casual attire.

It was happy hour so we ordered a few drinks and had the Caesar salad to start. There are only so many words to describe a salad, so honestly? It was delicious! Very delicious! They do have an extensive cocktail menu of wines, champagne, craft beers (they offer a milk stout for you beer lovers with the Mandalay Signature label exclusive to the hotel by Left Hand Brewery), and cocktail and spirits!

For my main entree I ordered the Lomo Saltado (a 12 oz. grilled New York steak, with a soy aji Amarillo glaze and Peruvian fried rice). The steak was soft, tender and juicy, one of the best prepared New York steaks I have ever had!

As a side order to the New York steak, we ordered the garlic fries, which came with two dipping options: ranch dressing and/or ketchup! 

Lastly, I ordered the Classic Tiramisu for dessert! Yummy! The Tiramisu was served in a martini glass! Very nice! I have never had Tiramisu served out of a martini glass before!
(For those not familiar with a Tiramisu dessert, it is a coffee flavored sponge cake, coffee and cognac syrup, dark chocolate ganache, chocolate chunk pearls). In Italy, it is called
Gianni Doglia, Moscato d' Asti, from Piemonte, Italy.

Chef Hubert Keller offers creations from across the globe, including  USA, France, Japan, Peru and Italy....... Chef's inspires desserts hail out of Hungary, Italy and Portugal! Quite a Worldly experience!

Service was exceptional! I would like to commend Jason, our bartender/server, who took care of us during the whole experience! Thank you, Jason! I look forward to my next experience here!

One of the most delicious things I've ever had was the White Onion Soup Veloute with Truffle Oil. It was an explosion of flavors, and it was so delicious I had to go a second day in a row, just to eat the soup. The first day, I ordered this delicious flatbread, called the Tarte Flambe, which had onions, bacon, truffle oil, shaved asparagus, and creme fraiche. It was simply light and full of flavor.

My husband ordered the cuban sandwich with fries, and he was very delighted with his meal. For dessert that day, I ordered the brownie cake pops. They were simply divine. They contained milk chocolate mousse, dark chocolate ganache, and cocoa nibs. I love cakepops, and I have to say this was one of the best I've ever had.

The following day, March 8th, I decided to go downstairs by myself and grab a bite of that delicious White Onion Soup Veloute with Truffle Oil, that I had the day prior. I also ordered the brioche beignets served with vanilla and cherry anglaises sauces. It was so delicious, and as you know, one of my favorite things is a good beignet.

Open entering the restaurant I spotted Chef Hubert Keller himself, I almost fainted. I was looking at his poster outside and said to myself that this couldn't be actually him. I was happy I had the opportunity to tell him how much I was a fan of his work, and how delicious his soup was.

To kick off an even better birthday, I got a delicious chocolate cupcake served by Chef Keller himself. I was so surprised and almost passed out from shock. I was deeply humbled by the whole experience, and never in a million years thought this could happen to me.

Overall, this is simply one of the best restaurants I've ever been to, and it will always serve a special place in my heart. Thank you so much to Chef Keller and the wonderful staff, you made my 30th birthday special, and I will never forget it.",rSwiA7uSKAcsvrlantfStQ,6,6,5,nK5CuJMpHAU-38bFWQ6yhw

We decided to go for lunch figuring Fleur's small plates would be ideal for a satisfying, yet not overly filling, lunchtime meal.  We decided on having the tuna tacos ($13), the green gazpacho ($14), the Tarte Flambé ($11), and the ""In the shower"" mac & cheese ($18).  

The tuna tacos were a dish comprised of three small, just over bite-size, tacos with sushi grade tuna chunks accompanied by serrano chilies, cilantro, and avocado cream.  The tacos were flavorful, but the dish was a bit pricey given their size.  The green gazpacho was a wonderfully-balanced chilled soup of pureed tomatillos, green peppers and cilantro.  It was served with a small but tasty Jonah crab salad sandwich.  The star of this dish, however, was the soup.  Very refreshing and perfect for a warm Spring day!  The Tarte Flambé, a flatbread topped caramelized onions, bacon, truffle, asparagus, and crème fraiche.  It was a veritable tie between the gazpacho and the tarte for top honors for our meal.  Last, but sadly least, was the mac & cheese.  It was supposedly made with lobster, brunoise vegetables, and cheese, but what we received was woefully short on the lobster and veggies.  What was there was so finely diced, denying us the opportunity to get any sense of taste of lobster.  There was seemingly a reasonable amount of cheese, but it was surprisingly bland, excessively runny, and didn't really provide the gooey cheesiness that one would expect.  Of course, perhaps the ""in the shower"" part of its name referred to the fact that the cheese would be wet and runny by design.  Nevertheless, I've had much, much better lobster mac & cheese for much less money.  Service throughout the meal was satisfactory.

Fleur is a good restaurant, but a bit uneven in its lunch choices.  Perhaps the dinner service offers a greater, more even experience.  Still, don't get me wrong.  If you order the tarte and the gazpacho (both 4 star dishes), and perhaps the tacos (3 stars), you'll be pleased.  Just avoid the mac & cheese (a 1 star effort)!",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,1,3,SBOPy_Fe1-dC2w5fC9n8kw

We were early, so we unknowingly reaped the yummy benefits of the happy hour. The popcorn was ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! I still have frequent cravings of it at least once a week. haha Also, the celebration of chocolate was so delicious and plated very nicely. Actually, everything was presented beautifully. If I could, I would give a four or five star rating for presentation. 

However, most of the savory foods were extremely salty. No, they weren't ""sort of salty"" or ""pretty salty."" They were EXTREMELY salty!

I got the 3 Course Prix Fixe Menu with Truffled Onion Soup, Stout Braised Beef Short Ribs, and Celebration of Chocolate. My sister ordered the Gently Heated Alaskan King Salmon entree.

The Truffled Onion Soup was definitely special, but too salty. The short ribs were cooked to tender perfection, but all those sauces on it were sadly overwhelmingly strong and salty. My sister's salmon was cooked well, but, again, those darned sauces were way too SALTY!

I would definitely go back for that popcorn, dessert, and maybe happy hour. Perhaps the chef was having an off day or it was because we dined right when they opened.

I have to say, this restaurant really lived up to the type of cuisine Chef Keller is known to produce. I ordered the roasted chicken (go ahead, laugh but it was just amazing). The BF ordered the duck which he gave two very enthusiastic thumbs up to. I had the ""dorm mac and cheese"" as an app (some may remember he made this during Top Chef Masters). The waitstaff was just amazing - it truly was like a well choreographed dance. Once second you're done, the next your place setting is cleared and a new utensil setting for the next has arrived. 

With a lovely setting, the atmosphere is just beautiful. The acoustics are great - aaaaand... to my surprise, Chef Keller was actually there! The staff says he checks in about 2x a month. They were so nice when I asked for a picture (I know, so touristy) but we got to go into the kitchen and meet him! Was just amazing. 

As a side note, if you plan on going here, take advantage of the $50 restaurant.com coupon - it made the meal totally affordable.",TyIik5grKDKOUAACNz4AIQ,2,1,5,bBoYFInpuwSIqUxrp4TwrA

Experience #1 was on my own for lunch while my darling attended his convention activities.  I had the White Onion Soup and upon special request, the Black Garlic Escargot. I enjoyed a glass of the sparkling wine with the meal.  Service was flawless, food was flawless, atmosphere was perfect. Bill came to $68'ish. For me it was worth it.  I enjoyed it so much I talked him into having dinner here as well.

Experience #2: Dinner at about 9pm.  Ambiance was the same romantic lit room. Not overly crowded (about 40% capacity). That is where the experience changed. Service was not as attentive as lunch.  Bordering on slow actually.  Our server was way too informal in his manners and his use of the English language (""hey""...""um""...""ya"" versus ""you""...etc)  We had the White Onion Soup (still really good), the escargot, the carpaccio, a bottle of reasonable Bordeaux that is one of our daily wines back home, the grand marnier soufflé and the chocolate soufflé.  While we were waiting for food, an obvious VIP group came in, hugs and kisses to and from Chef to the new guests, whisked away to the big table in the back, the chef sits down and 5 servers swarm that table. 10 minutes later a server brings the escargot and carpaccio.  The Escargot had obviously been sitting under the heat lamp for several minutes as it had that ""sat out too long under heat"" skin formed over the sauce.  Still...5 servers standing around the VIP table (including our server) waiting for commands.  When the server does manage to make it back, we comment ""looks like Chef has friends this evening"" his reply...""Oh no...big investors from Cancun that are talking of opening another restaurant with the chef over there"".  Great - business before, well....my business I guess. Perfect.  This is how the balance of the evening went.  After it all the bill for $220 comes.  It's not the $220 because we consider that a decent - not fine dinner in Vegas, we usually spend $200-$500 per dinner during our stays there. It was the obvious lack of caring about the customers who are the ongoing financial support of the dining establishment.  I find it very rude actually.  We are in Vegas at least once a year, sometimes twice.  All trips are business for Chevrolet.  We travel with other couples we know from our Chevy region.  Prior to this dinner, we had inquired as to how many the cellar room (large wine cellar dining area upstairs behind the glass wall) can hold, thinking we would do a group dinner there next trip down with two other couples.  I don't think I would take the chance on that now.  It has a $3500 table minimum, which is totally doable for 6 people when the better wine begins flowing.  However, if Mr. & Mrs. investor people show up, I know where the level of our importance would go again.

I'm thinking that our future visits to Fleur shall not be happening.  5 stars for lunch. 3 stars for dinner.",8A1NPpH3z715cekMYHE_eQ,1,1,4,Iejr4UNP9iR7BagVoAPFDw

foie gras with gelee and bread $12
steak tartar $15
bizare (risotto with chorizo sauce) $29

The oysters had a nasty lemon sorbet that masked the flavor. the oysters were super cold from the liquid nitrogen and were small as hell. I've had better oysters at buffets in Minnesota.

The foi gras was like a nasty peanut butter and jelly sandwich...I thought it was duck liver?? 

the steak tartar was good, but not worth it

the bizare or whatever you call it was super salty and the risotto was undercooked and NOT creamy!

However, I've never got the chance to experience it.  So I'm planning a trip to Vegas, and yes there are tons of restaurants, and maybe I should have tried one that I can't get to in SF, but I didn't.  As soon as I knew I was going to Vegas, I began deciding on what restaurants I should go to.  FDL made the cut.

As expected, we were not disappointed either.  We opted for the Elegance menu, which consisted of 4 courses.  Each beautifully presented and each were provided with brief but lovely descriptions.  The only downside to our dining experience was our server, who although pleasant and helpful, was a little slow to come around.

I definitely need to get myself to the San Francisco location soon!

We started with the onion soup shooters, burrata, and Brie flambé. The burrata was a large portion of light, fluffy cheese, though a little firmer than I'm used to. Still, accompanied by a nice crostini and tomatoes with balsamic, it was lovely. The Brie was decent. My family enjoyed it more than I did, but I'm not a huge Brie fan. The onion soup shooters were the favorite of the table, with the four of us, from my five year old on up trying to get one more sip. 

At this point, the adults ordered drinks. I had the cherry limeade, which is made with cherry vodka, lime juice and black cherry purée. It was easily the best mixed drink I've had in my life. My husband had the Sumo, which was just okay, and kept sneaking sips of my drink. We ordered another cherry limeade to split. My ten year old ordered the steak frites, just under the wire before the switchover to the dinner menu. It was cooked to medium rare, very tender and juicy. The fries were good as well. 

Once it was time for the dinner menu, I had the salmon, which came with a nice dill sauce and some lightly cooked sliced cucumbers. It was delicious. My husband had the braised short ribs, which came in a larger than expected portion, soft, tender, sweet. He enjoyed it.

For dessert, we had the brownie lollipops, creme brûlée, and panna cotta. My husband loved the panna cotta. The brownie lollipops were pretty slim on the brownie. Like a cake pop, with chocolate mousse  and a thin sliver of brownie dipped in dark chocolate. The caramel sauce that accompanied it was a little skimpy, but tasty. My ten year old had the creme brûlée, which I tasted and thought was a pretty standard creme brûlée. 

The service was good, with a nicely attentive waiter and assistant refilling our waters frequently. I'll be back for another cherry limeade and onion soup shooters.",WHintbQHeAc1EyO1nPfvUw,1,1,5,goa-w07geYxh3PPULL18CA

Downgrade reason?  The restaurant does not care about their guest.

1.  Serving warm Champagne.  OK, so it was only a $120 bottle.  Not a $500 Krug but I believe they could spring for $0.20 of ice.  The server knew it was warm and poured anyway.

2.  75 minute wait between courses.  Perhaps the pumpkin for the soup needed to grow, or someone had to catch a run away octopus, IDK.   The ""real"" reason, they were having problems with the ovens.  How about showing some respect and letting the customer know?

3.  Allowing a visibly flawed dish to be served then laughing about it.  A cook must have assembled the dish.  Someone must have approved it at the pass.  A server clearly sees the dish and still presents it.  Cold, rubbery, octopus.  A film on the sauce from air conditioning.  When asked ""how is everything?""  I said the dish was bad and obviously sat at the pass for half an hour.  The server's reply ""haha, yeah it did"".  Well F you too!

To be fair, the restaurant manager did apologize and remove items from the check, but this isn't a case of a little green worm happily munching your organic salad with you, rather obvious mistakes bordering on purposeful. 

Objective food review (best to worst)

Grand Marnier Souffle - Simply outstanding.  Perfect in every respect.  Perfect texture, perfect moisture.  The cream, perfectly infused.  The side of ginger / citrus ice cream a perfect foil adding a hint of bitterness.  Well controlled sweetness.

Tarte Flambe - Tasty as usual but sloppy in assembly.  Onion, bacon, asparagus, and truffle atop a layer of creme fraiche on a cracker.  Great but the end two pieces had NO topping what so ever.

Grilled Octopus - Cold, rubbery, dry octopus atop a dry heart of palm, sweet teardrop tomatoes, dry sea beans, desiccated citrus caviar, a lemon vinaigrette and chipotle aioli.  Too bad since this dish would have been PERFECT in it's balance and flavor if it were served when it was made.

Roasted Kabocha Soup with seared foie and honey toast - Awful.  Sweetness way off balance.  The foie had a rubbery texture.  Extremely livery bordering on the flavor of spoiled beef liver.  Foie?  More like old chicken liver.

Service is a joke where even guest sitting at the bar had to endure a bartender more interested in the football game than them.

Decent wine list with very high Vegas resort markup.

The flambees are basically flatbread pizzas.  The shooters are nothing to really write home about - flavors are too muddled.

My favorite cocktail was surprisingly the ""Sumo"" - not necessarily because of the sweet, fruity taste - but because a cocktail that deep green looks really, really cool.

Probably one of the most sophisticated and chic dining rooms, Fleur de Lys boasted a a delicious menu and a supremely elegant dining environment.

High ceilings, cascading curtains, and dimly lit candles make you forget that you're on the Vegas strip and a bustling casino is only 20 paces away.

The soup was decadent, a thick and savory blend of caramelized onions and truffles. To only add to the richness of the meal, we also ordered the braised veal and yukon gold potato ravioli with sunchokes and English peas. The two appetizers were an excellent way to begin our sumptous French meal.

My boyfriend opted for the 18 oz. bone-in prime rib eye steak and I chose the free-range Sonoma Valley roast chicken.

The chicken was sliced thinly and was very moist and tender - almost a sous vide quality to it. It came with a shallot confit, black trumpet mushrooms, and crispy green cabbage.

We started with caesar salads which were HUGE. It came with two large romaine sections. We could easily have shared that, as well. The flavor of it was good, but the anchovy to romaine ratio was small. On top of that, it seems that the salads had been dressed for awhile, because the salad was soggy. We ordered small plates including the black garlic edamame, kimchi fried rice, and beef carpaccio. We asked that they come out one by one (so that our table wouldn't be crowded and we wouldn't be rushed). Our server brought out things in a really odd order, including bringing our edamame as our last course and starting out with heavier items, which didn't make sense to either of us. She didn't bring it out in the order that my husband stated them, nor did she bring them out according to their order on the menu. We were really trying to figure out how she decided the food order just to understand.

We ended with the grand mariner soufflé that I've been looking forward to for months. Again, good, but not amazing (and small).

One thing that I found very disappointing was that they were unable to cook a rib eye properly here! My boyfriend asked for his steak to be cooked to a medium rare and it came to the table as a medium well. What? For a place like this....and all the other food was prepared very well so we were confused on why they fell short on something so simple.  Their rib eye steaks were just horrible, my brother had a huge chunk of his steak that was inedible because it was a tendon. They took my brother's steak off of our bill.

Despite the mishap with the rib eye steaks the overall experience was great. Too bad that this place closed. At least I still have the SF location to go to.",yeHRi5kh2qFcGE-0em2r4w,0,0,4,e3gNSzQXsfJap-WD1CYeFw

The issues started with the drink order, my cocktail selection was the blood orange margarita whereupon my server informs me that they are out of it.    really, is it that hard to send someone to the store to buy a bottle?   we were seated at 5:15 and dinner started at 5 so this is inexcusable in my book.   so we move on, and I select their version of a mimosa, which the menu says is made with prosecco.   I like this, because I'm not a huge fan of champagne.   however when he brings me the drink it tastes very bitter and certainly not the taste I was expecting.   so I mention this to the server and I am informed that they don't have prosecco so they make it with champagne. !!!    again, is it that hard to either (a) print a new menu or (b) buy a bottle of prosecco !!    in any event you do NOT under any circumstances make such a change to a drink without asking the patron first if this is acceptable !!!

What we ordered: 
Three out of the four of us ordered the three course elegance prix fixed menu which included 4 courses. My bf ordered ala carte. 
 
BREAD BASKET: Good selection of bread. My faves were the focaccia and the pretzel bread. 

SALAD:  Fresh and tasted great. 

TRUFFLE ONION SOUP-Braised Duck Crêpe, Red Wine Shallot Purée, Black Truffle. This was definitely very good...tasted very decadent and hearty. 

AHI TUNA TARTARE:  The ahi tuna tasted fresh and the ginger ponzu sauce added a little kick to the dish.

CHORIZO WRAPPED SUZUKI SEA BASS:  This was a superb dish. Sea bass was cooked very well, melted in your mouth.

BRAISED VEAL AND YUKON GOLD POTATO RAVIOLI: The last time I had veal, I didn't really like it. But this time it was actually pretty good. 

STOUT BRAISED BEEF SHORT RIBS: Soft and tender. Very good but I must say my bf and two other friends ordered the prime filet and that was definitely the better of the two dishes. 

PRIME FILET MIGNON TOPPED WITH SAUTÉED FOIE GRAS: This was definitely the best dish of the night. The meat just melted in your mouth and the foie gras was superb!!! The dish also had truffle in it which was an added bonus. 

Dessert Trio of Peanut Butter Milkshake + Chocolate Fondant Cake + Canal of Bailey's ice-cream with crushed peanut butter brittle: My friend wasn't too impressed with this dish..tried a little bit and thought it was ok,nothing spectacular. 

Chocolate souffle: This was actually really good. Decadent and was perfect with the ice cream.

Carrot cake with a pineapple sorbet: Carrot cake was moist and the sorbet was not too tart. 

Since it was my bf's bday they brought out a dessert dish that had happy birthday on it with a candle..yay happy birthday bf!!! They also gave us 4 small dishes of appetizers; complimentary of the chef  and was pretty good. Unfortunately I forgot what its called though. 

Dog Point Pinot Noir: This was a very good Pinot from New Zealand. Soft bodied and a little more fruity in taste. 

Overall the experience was great. Deducted a point just for the affordability factor. We got $50 deducted from our bill because we used a certificate I got from restaurant.com. Total for 4 people 650 including tip and the $50 deduction. Definitely not cheap and will take a chunk out of your wallet but I have to say it was well worth a try. Also, plan on staying for a least two hours for dinner. Our reservation was at 7pm and we didn't leave till 9PM, that's with us rushing our server a bit because we had a show to attend at 930.

My husband and I dined at Fleur de Lys for my most recent ""29""th birthday. We enjoyed a Sazerac and a Manhattan in the lounge, both well prepared.

We were seated a few minutes early, by a very pleasant and accomodating hostess. We had a wonderful table. The interior is simply gorgeous.

Our server greeted us promptly. We didn't need menus, as the Vegetarian Tasting had been ordered in advance, although menus were presented. We made our server aware of our preference and off he went. We'd wanted to order a bottle of champagne, but it wasn't until our first course was served that our waiter was around to do so. Then we waited...and waited...and waited. 

First course: Vidalia onion cream soup- amazingly rich, intense onion flavor, just perfect

Second course: Frisee and hearts of palm salad with pistachio nuts and oil- crisp and bitter, loved the briny palm

Third course: Artichoke hearts, carrots and asparagus in vegetable parmesan broth- light, flavorful broth, nicely al dente veggies, a tad boring

Fourth course: Pumpkin risotto with ginger foam- rich, earthy risotto, foam had zero flavor 

Dessert: Tapioca pool, mini banana breads, passion fruit sorbet, kiwi, strawberry, fried plantains- delicious, even though none of the flavors seemed to go together- kind of bizarre, but totally enjoyable

Besides the initial difficulty ordering champagne, we had to beg for bread. The bread server passed our table multiple times, skipping us over and over. We asked both our server and the runner for some bread, yet no bread for us. When the bread guy finally came over, he asked if we'd like ""more"" bread. We replied that we'd like ""some"" bread. He apologized, and doled out the killer pretzel rolls.

We were interested in ordering a Super Tuscan for the entrees, but I wasn't familiar with any of their offerings. I asked for the sommelier. When he arrived, I asked him to tell me which Tuscan had a high amount of Sangiovese, as my husband likes it. He was clueless. We chose our own wine. The markup was reasonable by Vegas standards, although most of their wine prices made me laugh out loud. $90 for Gruet Rose? That's a $12 bottle.

Our meal was about $600. I have no problem spending money on a great dinner, and the food was remarkable. The service left quite a bit to be desired. I left under 20% for the first time in my life.",vLTrtgiM-8TTjRWD4RbelQ,4,1,3,1XqLY_0EDlwplhBRttkswg

Because as far as I can tell, either over 700 other reviewers are taken by the novelty or I'm missing something.  The two dishes I actually genuinely liked were the heirloom beet and chocolate bar for dessert, which had an almost silken texture and intriguing flavor, and the 
green papaya carpaccio as one of our appetizers, which was very tangy and bright.  I don't know what happened to the rest of the menu.  

The grilled skirt steak lyonnaise was great the first couple bites, but I soon realized the overabundance of the sickeningly sweet red wine jus, which overwhelmingly drenched everything underneath.  The potatoes -- soaked, not a singly potato-y thing left about them.  Not a jus-free spot remaining on anything edible.  
The szechuan beef tartare was truly horrible.  The first time I had tartare where I was strikingly aware I was eating raw beef.  It had no other flavor, despite being mixed tableside with spices by the expeditor.  We were asked how spicy we wanted it, we said very, so he added a ton and it still tasted of nothing but raw beef.  
The duroc pork belly lo mein had entirely too much lo mein, was too sweet, too salty, too fatty, too saucy, too everything while still not tasting of anything decent!  Just one big goop with no distinguishing flavors or textures.  
The drink-ordering system is just strange and inefficient.  You pick your drinks out on an iPad, but instead of zooming it off to the bartender like you assume it does, your server eventually comes and picks it up and puts it into the computer... so you think you ordered your drink 10 minutes ago, but you actually haven't until they come to take your order for them anyway.  

The menu items are incohesive.  We were missing silverware.  Some food and drinks took forever to arrive while others arrived very quickly.  There is a front bar area where people get drunk and yell at the TV all while you're spending over $200 on dinner for two, trying to enjoy a nice, peaceful evening out.

I always like to smile when I am eating, and this is the one and only dish that made me smile at Fleur. The soup wasn't too sweet, but when you create a complete bite with the sorbet and a bit of the dehydrated fruit (think classy cereal), it is a perfectly balanced bite. I ate both little helpings myself as I spied those around me with suspicion. Silly guests, coconut soup is for Misti!

Most everything else I found underwhelming, and the hummus and baba ganoush were sad. If I had one recommendation it would be to not order this. The baba was blended to a puree, and the overwhelming flavor was of chili powder? I am not sure, but I did not get any of the smoky, beautiful flavor of eggplant. I was tempted to send it back. The little bread triangles were nothing special, and the hummus was just passable, not delicious. The gnocchi were solid, but then the artichokes were a little over cooked perhaps. A little of the freshness of the choke was missing.

The presentations were okay, but at times cheesy. When the oysters first arrived with their dry ice smoke swirling, my first reaction was, cool! Then, after looking at the glass rocks and big blades of seaweed, I thought it was a little odd. Stick to a solid colored stone (perhaps a smooth white) and lose the seaweed and maybe then it will feel a little less Miami Vice. 

Our waitress was a bit brusque and rushed. If we had to think a sliver of a second about what we wanted or if we had a question, she seemed bothered. Perhaps she had too large of a section to cover, but either way, it made me nervous!

If it is a busy night, you may want to avoid the patio seating, as it gets loud and you can hear the nearby lounge singers belting ""Barbie World""? The interior does offer nice cozy seating for groups, and you can order the feast, which is pretty much everything on the menu, for 435. We saw a party of 6 guys attempt it, and they told the waitress to halt the food because they were stuffed! The also offer absinthe service, 9 options, with the cheapest at $25. 

Overall, there is little value here, with the average price of tapas being $12. For $5000, you can have the wagyu Fleurburger with foie gras, truffle and a 1995 bottle Chateau Petrus. We spent around $150 and were sad to see the money go. I wouldn't plan a full meal here, but maybe if you snack on the one or two best things on the menu, you can have a fun light bite!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,13,3,6yqX871pEL6-JiH1xtAA0A

Atmosphere - dramatic and beautiful, service was great.

Course 1 - Salad with herb dressing and polenta croutons. This sounds ridiculous, but the salad dressing was incredible. It was so fresh tasting and complex. The croutons were like a party in my mouth - crunchy on the outside with a soft polenta filling. I actually finished this huge salad - something I never do!

Course 2- slowly cooked salmon. This my friends was the best salmon I've EVER eaten. I've been all over alaska, I've eaten my share of salmon sashimi all over the US, but this salmon was so freaking awesome. It was a beautiful wild salmon ""barely cooked"" and then plated with an apple sauce and a beautiul fresh herb green sauce. The salmon is cooked at 200 degrees for a little while to make it warm, but it maintains a beautiful, delicate texture more like sashimi. It was silky, NOT flaky. Portion size was generous. This was a dish I'd pay full price for in the future. 

Dessert - the carrot cake ice cream sandwich did NOT disappoint. Carrot cake with cream cheese ICE CREAM? Cream cheese ice cream is genius.. where can I buy a pint of this?

Wine parings were smart and good. We did have one disappointment, however, that makes us believe it must be difficult to find good wait staff in las Vegas. The service WAS very good and the meal paced reasonably well, but so many different people showed up at our table that we actually never knew which one was our waiter. Each person described our dishes, when presented, but they never made eye contact and stood at attention robotically reciting memorized lists. We wondered if they even knew what a ""reduction"" meant and we actually laughed at the ""this on top of this, underneath that"" wording that made it sound like we were on an archeological dig. Such a fine resturaunt should have personable servers, who engage their diners. I suppose you can train the staff, as Fleur de Lys clearly does, but can not as easily teach them to have a personality. It was the only thing missing from an otherwise ""5 star"" experience.",6fYj6gfRwIjbbgdq1wbxNg,0,0,4,DmxOXI8RWqLSp3n_yV5BgQ

Roasted Bone Marrow:
Onion jam, marrow butter, bacon and pain rustic. You just can't go wrong with bone marrow...add bacon to that. Oh c'mon!  Worth clogging your arteries for. 5/5

Truffle bechamel, ham and peas.  There's only a few places in town that has good fried mac n cheese - Fleur is one of them. 5/5

Fleur Burger:
Wagyu beef, brioche comes with pomme frites.  Add Foie Gras and Black Truffles. It's the same as Hubert Keller's (other restaurant) Burger Bar's Rossini burger. Best burger you'll ever eat! Glad they didn't take this off the menu. 5/5

After ordering some of their specialties, we were surprised how salty the steak was. I did love their seared foie gras though, but the size was extremely small an not the freshest one that we've tried (God, I miss Paris! haha). Oh, their oyster was pretty decent, but not the best.

Do they have a bigger dinner menu? After 2 cancelled birthday dinner reservations we had to settle for a birthday lunch on Sunday before catching our flight back to LA.  We decided to try Fleur because A. had been to the other Fleur and said it was delicious and that we should go.  Of course I yelped it to see what it was TDF (to die for)

After perusing the menu nothing in particular really stood out to me.  And since a few reviews were talking about the kobe burger, we decided to just order some apps and then walk over to the Burger Bar, also a Hubert Keller establishment located at Mandalay Place.

We ordered the truffled onion soup SHOOTERS.  People seem to have forgotten mention that in their review.  It comes in a small carafe equaling 4 shooters.    I'm a HUGE onion soup fan and am always on the look out for a restaurant that blows my tastebuds.  This wasn't it.  It was heavily creamy and looked like cream of corn.  The truffle oil is probably the only thing that saved it.
The lobster mac and cheese which everyone also raved about.  They used small macaroni noodles and in my opinon didn't have enough cheese to my mac.  It was good but I probably wouldn't order it here again and opt to try something new.
Tarte flambe with bacon truffle and asparagus was the best out of the 3.  The flavors complemented each other perfectly 

The desserts are actually the only thing that sounded delicious, but since we were heading to Burger Bar I exercised a little self control and asked for the check.",5_GZPSAc1svAih8-a8hFmg,0,0,3,JePHG0Eg4ltSeJvukKCoMQ

Evidently, unlike some other Yelper's, I did some research and knew going in this was a ""small plate"" kind of place.  I am completely comfortable with this concept.  It allows people to try things without risking too much. 

I started with a fun Flight of three cocktails that  included The Sumo, made with Sake and Yuzu Juice.  The Fleurtini, a pomegranate based Martini and The Sparkling Peach Blossom, a mix of prosecco (I think) and Peach Nectar. Each glass came perched on a slice of Cucumber, which I ate after finishing each small drink to clear my palate.   Even though I am not a huge Mixed Drink Guy, this was a great way to experience a lot of different flavor combinations and was a lot of fun.

Next, I ordered the ""In The Shower"" Lobster Mac and Cheese.  I Loved it! I thought the portion was generous for the price and it was rich, creamy, cheesy and a delicious.  They may have tweaked the recipe and presentation recently because the dish didn't resemble the description by other Yelpers at all.  Mine came in a large artsy soup bowl (not a small Ramekin), had toasted breadcrumbs on top and was not runny at all.  At first, I didn't see much lobster, but soon discovered a ton of it at the bottom of the bowl. A quick stir and the excellently cooked, sweet lobster was evenly distributed throughout my dish.

For dessert, I debated the Coconut Soup or the Souffle, but decided on the Affogato a la LN2.  Trust me...This is a MUST for any Top Chef Fan or anyone interested in Avant Garde Cuisine. This version of the classic Coffee drink was made table side using Liquid Nitrogen to make a rich and amazingly smooth Bailey's Ice Cream.  Next, one of the best cups of espresso I've ever  had was poured over the Ice Cream.  The result was a wonderful combination of tastes, textures and temperatures.  I want to try the other desserts, but it will be difficult not to order this every time I am in Vegas!

My food at Fleur was Five Star quality.  I am deducting one star because my server seemed very distracted and disinterested in actually serving me.  I felt like the rest of the staff noticed this and went out of their way to check on me.

We had the Prix Fix dinner with wine pairings.  Masterful!  When they found out I had proposed and was told yes they brought even more desserts for us to share.  We were STUFFED with the best food when we left.

They gave us a tour of the kitchen when we were done and that was incredible.  Very clean, very organized.  The Executive chef stands in the middle of horseshoe and calls out, ""Fire or prepare...whatever"".  The only response or talking is ""Yes chef"".

We were shown monitors in the kitchen with live feeds from various cameras in the restaurant.  The Executive Chef know what each table has ordered and is able to call out the next course without prompting from the staff.

3. Ceviche (Decent. nothing too special)

5414794,2012-07-30,2,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I have been to Fleur de Lys in SF a number of years ago and had a lovely meal, so I was excited to try Fleur here in LV. The food, of course, was delicious and fairly inexpensive for it being LV (partially because we didn't eat any land mammals on this visit). For you vegetarians, Keller has thoughtfully denoted a section of the small plates menu as being ""vegetarian"", saving you the guesswork of what actually has animal products in it. In addition, if you are on a budget but want the Fleur dining experience, vegetarian is the way to go as the items generally ranged from $3-11. 

In any event, we went with:

- Fried chickpeas: I'm tempted to whip out my Le Creuset dutch oven now and fry my own little chickpea bites of deliciousness now. They were surprisingly delicious when lightly accented with the lemon wedge accompanying it. 

- Heirloom tomato gazpacho: Generally speaking, I'm not a gazpacho person. However, if anyone could change my mind about gazpacho, it is Keller! This delightfully fresh gazpacho was poured at the table over finely chopped honeydew and cantaloupe ""tartare"" and topped with watermelon pop rocks! The pop rocks actually retained their crunchy pop even after it had been sitting in the gazpacho for a few minutes. 

- Fingerling potato puree: This is not your mama's mashed potatoes. It was super fluffy and creamy with no lumps. Each bite just melts in your mouth because it was perfectly pureed.  The truffle jus was a nice touch as well without being overwhelming. Sometimes, truffles in food can be really ""in your face"" and this was just the perfect blend of savory earthiness for the potato puree. 

- Garlic fries: I have had my fair share of garlic fries in my days and this is definitely one of the better ones I've tried. This one didn't have raw garlic (which can be way too strong) but had a nice roasted garlic flavor to it that infused every bite with garlic but was just balanced enough to leave you wanting more. This is served with ketchup and mayo. 

- Salmon with horseradish dill cream: This is served medium and was cooked well to the perfect tenderness. There was just a little seasoning on the salmon, but not too much to where it masks the flavor of the salmon. The cream sauce was a nice contrast to the salmon too but I didn't love the cucumber or the mixed greens that came with it. They made for nice decoration but didn't add anything to the dish. 

- Souffle: This takes 30 minutes to make and I highly recommend it. I'm also not a soufflé person, but this one is very fluffy and served with crème anglaise tableside, along with a scoop of ice cream (forgot the flavor). The soufflé had just the right amount of liquor added to it so you don't feel like you are taking a straight shot of alcohol. It was only the size of the small ramekin, which is a pity because after a few bites each, it was over. I probably would get one per person!

We didn't get the affogato but it was quite the spectacular presentation at the other tables. It is Bailey's with liquid nitrogen, which they whip up tableside. It turns into ""ice cream"", which is topped with espresso. I'm all for molecular gastronomy and I definitely wished we tried this out - though I was very full by this point and ran out of room. 

Service was generally good although not as good as some of the comparable restaurants here in LV. One of the issues is that the restaurant is on the darker side and given that the water tumblers are black, it's hard to tell when a diner has run out of water. With this in mind, we had to keep asking. In addition, perhaps because we came very late in the evening, it seemed like the servers were a little less attentive than expected, or perhaps just disinterested like what other Yelpers have noted.  Another minor quibble I had was that the servingware pieces are very pretty and uniquely shaped, which made getting the food out of them a little tricky and messy. 

In addition, though Yelpers have said this is a dressy restaurant, we definitely didn't get that impression here. We were fairly casually dressed (jeans and shirts with sleeves) and there were other diners in tanks and shorts. When we walked by the next day, there were quite a number of people in shorts and polos or sundresses.",PMT94wJvyAQdG9YGZerYAw,4,3,5,9B4Zx6OD_tosLdgg9pPddw

Last night (1/19/12) we at at Fleur at about 730 PM. It wasn't particularly busy, but not exactly as dead as you'd imagine for a Thursday night. The atmosphere was lovely-- in fact, it was a solid minute before my boyfriend and I looked up and noticed just how truly expansive this place is. Impressive and well appointments, that's for sure.

I'll admit my ignorance right out the gate: I honestly had no idea this restaurant billed itself as a tapas place. Oops. But I'm sure there's got to be at least one Yelper as ignorant as I, so hopefully that'll help you out :). 

First neat thing: Hubert Keller was actually there, walking around and chatting with people. Perhaps I'm jaded by these celebrity chef chains you see everywhere, but to actually see the guy whose name is on the sign- and to know he's going back and forth into the kitchen- reassured me right out the gate about the great quality we were about to have. 

Second neat thing: when you order, they ask if you have any food allergies-- just in case their ""secret ingredient"" happens to me something that'll make you swell up like a blow fish. Smart from a business perspective no doubt.

Ok, on to the grub! 

Drinks: we each got a cocktail. I got the blood orange margarita that was delicious. My boyfriend got the strawberry martini (after it came to the table, he sort of stared at it and said, ""Oh man, I didn't realize I was ordering such a frufru drink."" That said! After he took one sip, he didn't care how frufru it was and guzzled it down quick).

Croque Monsieur: a fancy grilled cheese (but I knew that). Really simple and delicious, but the best part was that it came with some incredibly good spicy mustard. Good lord, I could drink that mustard it was so flavorful.

Manchego Salad: Normally, I wouldn't have even given this one a second look, but all the positive reviews on here made me give it a try-- and I'm glad I did! Good lord that was good. Just fair warning: it has a strong balsamic vinegar taste, so if you don't like balsamic, this one probably isn't for you. That said, the balsamic they use must be top grade, because it was seriously the best I've ever had.

Tarte Flambee: Very good and almost somewhat lemony. A perfect little something between the heavier stuff we were eating. 

Onion Soup Shooters: I am a HUGE onion soup fan, so I was stoked about this one. Really, really good (and a neat presentation), but definitely very heavy and creamy. It almost felt like I was drinking a baked potato-- it was that rich.

Hummus and Baba Ganush: Alright, so I hadn't seen this one reviews here, but my boyfriend and I are big fans so we tried it. Good lord: if you like hummus, do *not* pass this up. Seriously, amazing. There was some sort of bite in the hummus-- a little zing-- and it was better than any hummus I've ever had. 

Mushroom. . . thing: Ok, this isn't on the online menu, so I can't remember what they called it, but it had potatoes, shitake mushrooms, fennel and a few other things. Good, but not great.  

Sliders: The sliders on the online menu are short rib sliders, but what we had were mini wagyu sliders-- just the meat, the bun, some caramelized onions, and a little bacon. We were seriously taken aback by how utterly amazing these were. If this is what their full sized burgers are like, count me in for one next time I come back. 

Because it was my birthday, they also brought out some brownie pops on the house. VERY good. In fact, we would have ordered more dessert, but we had a birthday cake waiting for us elsewhere. 

I feel like I'm forgetting something. 

Anyway, my point is that Fleur is amazing and absolutely worth the price-- triple so if you get a great deal. 





FWIW: We used a $50 restaurant.com certificate and I also had a $100 resort credit from THEhotel--- so, our $150 dinner ended up costing us nothing. How great is that?! There are definitely deals if you keep an eye out there.",Ll_IZTr6GnZC8SfpEU-dKg,4,2,5,OcovMESMtm0QZPUc9J31dw

I had the truffles onion soup, braised short rib, and celebration of chocolate for dessert.

The truffled onion soup was by far the shining dish of the night.  Combined with the little duck morsel and red wine reduction, it was ridiculously good.  Very tasty and just the right amount to start the meal.

The short rib was also good, but I have had better.  It was braised in Guiness and served with a Guiness foam.  It was cooked perfectly tender, but I don't feel like the purees went well with it.

The celebration of chocolate was a peanut butter shake, a molten chocolate-banana cake, and a tiny scoop of Bailey's ice cream on a crisp.  My girlfriend and I both agree the ice cream was the best and that the cake was ok.  I personally liked the pb shake, but it did seem a little out of place.

Yes, he cooked prawns mac & cheese using nothing but a microwave, hot plate and a dorm room shower stall!! Pure genius.

So being that we were in Vegas, I had to check Fleur out. They didn't have the infamous In-The-Shower Lobster Mac & Cheese on the menu though, boo.....

We were fortunate enough to snag a table during a very busy lunch service. But sadly, our dining experience was just okay. Maybe it was an off-day for them, the food just didn't live up to my expectations nor to the hype that everyone raved about. 

ONION VELOUTE SOUP SHOOTERS ($9): The best part of my meal.
LOVE the presentation! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=UQzOpXu487FmvoLmblZGjA

Veloute is a stock-based white cream sauce, so one would expect it to be rich, but each sip was so light and silky-smooth! Delicious!

You can definitely taste the white onions and truffle oil in every sip. 
It's served in shot glasses, one order would yield 4 full shot glasses-worth of this soup.
 
I would've been happy with just a big bowl of this goodness! Lose the fancy presentation and feed me my inner heffer, lol!

HOUSE SALAD w/herbed vinaigrette ($20 because I added shrimp. Also avail with chicken):
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=E_Abepxb8idybDgc57-R-w
- 4 perfectly cooked shrimps
- tasty polenta croutons (wish they gave more than 4 small pieces)
- imported mozzarella was a nice touch (but only one tiny piece......wth?!)

I wished that the portion size was bigger for what we paid.

BRAISED SHORT RIBS AU POIVRE ($17):
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g?select=HEKFqxRmAQpVH0e_nebuIA

From looking at the menu, I knew it wasn't going to be your classical cracked peppercorn crusted steak. However, I was expecting the actual ""au poivre"" part. 

This dish was very disappointing in many ways:
- The cognac cream (or butter) sauce was missing.
- ""Au poirve"" is usually made w/cracked peppercorn or coarsely cracked black pepper. I got nasty WHOLE peppercorns with each bite, yuck.
- My short ribs was a pile of mush and tasted like chopped up meat soaked in a very sweet bbq sauce. Reminded me of eating bbq pulled pork drowned in a too-sweet bbq sauce. They should've renamed it  ""braised bbq short ribs"" instead.
- My bread was stale and dry.

My boyfriend and I went for dinner this last weekend and as vegetarians (me-no red meat or pork, him-no meat whatsoever) we were very excited to have the vegetarian tasting menu. Upon arriving though we were a little disappointed to discover that they didn't have it anymore. 

Instead I had the Peking duck, ""in the shower"" mac and cheese, and a trio of creme brulee. My boyfriend had the pan con tomate, risotto, and affogato a la LN2. We paired these with a trio of chamgagne cocktails and a trio of chocolate cocktails.

Everything we had was more delicious than the last. The duck was juicy and tender, the risotto was perfectly cooked and not gluey and undercooked like some places, the pan con tomate was so simple yet so flavorful, they drinks though tiny were very strong, and the mac and cheese may not have been the best I ever had but it was still very good.

We started off with the amuse bouche. It was a piece of fried cod over potato salad. YUM. A great start to our meal. Appetizer was the Ahi Tuna Tartare. Again, YUM! The fish was fresh and the fennel crisp on top was a nice flavor combo. I had the Butter-Poached Maine Lobster. It had good flavor BUT it was chewy :( Was that because it was overcooked? Not sure. I didn't send it back. Charlie got the steak. It came with creamed spinach and marble potatoes. The steak had an incredible crust on it. Really really tasty. Creamed spinach was so good! Even he who doesn't like creamed spinach loved it. No room for dessert....so stuffed. 

Overall, the food was really good except that my lobster was chewy. The service was ok. Not super attentive and our waitress spent a lot of her time on the other tables.

We arrived for our 8:30 reservation at 8:10.  We were told specifically that ""we're seating on time tonight"" and then directed to wait in the lounge.  It was almost 20 minutes before lounge staff offered us drinks (we know it was this long because we were debating whether to order drinks in the bar, as we were now at our reservation time).  

Anway, we ordered drinks.  And sat there for another 30 minutes.  During this time, not once did the front desk check in with us, let alone apologize or offer us something while we waited.  A  ""hi, sorry to keep you waiting"" in this situation is customary, doing a little something more would have been nice (bread?  ask if I want more champagne?). 

At 9pm, I went to the desk and inquired.  I was told, rather coldly, that it should be 5-10 more minutes.

After this, we requested our bar tab.  The waitress (who had also ignored us after she brought our first round of drinks some 30 minutes ago) had to ask us what we had again.  There was a problem with our bar bill too but I won't go into it.  At that point, we just wanted to get to our table.

Alas, when 9:10 came and we still hadn't been seated, we informed the front desk we were leaving.  Even if we had been seated at that point, we wouldn't have felt good about dropping big bucks for dinner there.  

In leaving, we did finally get an apology and a song and dance about others being late for their reservations and the tables turning slowly, blah, blah, blah.  Whatever, I get that.  But handle the sitaution better -- turn late arrivals away or tell them that because they were late, they can't linger over dessert; don't tell us that you're ""seating on time;"" and finally, acknowledge and be nice to people who are waiting because you're running behind schedule.

Surprisingly, my least favorite of the four was the red velvet pancake.  I love red velvet anything; however, these pancakes tasted rather bland and was really dry.  The omelet was nice, light and fluffy.  It was made with fresh veggies; thus, was refreshing.  As for the crispy potatoes, it can be best described as a medallion-shaped hashbrown.  It was good.

Lobster mac 'n' cheese -  al dente macaroni, with nice gooey cheese, but lacked a little flavor.  the addition of panko breadcrumbs was very nice.  the lobster was almost non-existent.  the tiny pieces were just the rubbery parts of the claw.  
Cuban panini - presentation was exquisite!  however, the sandwich was just ok.  the fries were AMAZING!
We rounded out our meals with the addition of Sangria.  Probably the best I've ever had at $10 a glass.  Our total ended up being $47.56 before tip.

5727549,2009-12-14,4,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"Everyone that knows me knows that I have the maddest crush ever on Chef Hubert Keller after watching him on Top Chef Masters.  So when I found out I was going to Vegas for a convention I made reservations oh about 2 months in advance for an early birthday celebration.

Myself and three of my girls showed up for our 730pm reservation and headed to the lounge to wait and order a martini that had Pop Rocks in it as the onlne menu suggested.  Alas, they don't make it anymore which resulted in four ladies saying ""Awwwww!"" in unison.  But we were seated before even ordering a drink so we didn't have time to be uber-disapponted.

We were seated in the back of the restaurant in a private cabana (although the curtains were not shut).  The restaurant was dimly lit with light Europop music in the background and my first impression was ooooh fancy!  I loved the atmosphere.  On the wall there is also a live flower arrangement made with 3500 individual roses with their own individual water receptacles attached to them.  They replace them every day too...aaaah Chef Keller, so niiiice!

On to the food.  I chose the Elegance menu since you cannot do the Chef's tasting menu unless the entire table does it.  Another friend did the Elegance menu, the other the Lion King three course menu, and the other the vegetarian menu.  We had an amuse bouche to start and it was some sort of fried cod and it was tasty - my friends and I both liked it.  They brought out a separate amuse bouche for the vegetarian friend as well which I thought was a nice touch.  The bread basket was also brought around and I got the foccacia which was so delicious they had to bring the bread basket around again 5 minutes later because we needed more.

First course I had the truffled onion soup with braised duck ragout and truffles.  They bring the bowl out with items placed in the bottom and then the soup is poured on top.  That was some seriously wonderful, creamy onion soup.  I ate every last bit of it and considered sopping up the rest with my bread...or licking it clean with my tongue.

Second course I chose the veal and Yukon Gold potato ravioli with a veal jus sauce.  I thought the ravioli was tasty but I would say perhaps the sauce was a bit too salty but not too salty to eat every last bit of it.

Third course I chose the filet mignon with potato puree, spinach, and wild mushrooms.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the sauce was divine.  The potato puree looked very festive on the plate - like a potato comma at the top - and tasted as good as it looked.

The last course was dessert which we had to order when we ordered our entrees.  I got the chocolate souffle ($6 supplement) and it was worth the entire trip to Vegas just to eat this.  It comes out looking absolutely perfect and a fleur de lys design is on top in powdered sugar.  The waiters poke a hole in the top and pour the chocolate sauce in.  Then you devour it and the mocha ice cream they served with it while your eyes roll back in your head and you think ""Oh sweet baby Jesus, thank you for this excellent dessert!""

As an added bonus the waiter brought out a special birthday dessert for me - I don't even know what it was but they had written Happy Birthday on the plate in chocolate syrup which pleased me to no end.  The manager came around to ask how our evening was and I did have to ask if Chef Keller was there....and...he....wasn't.  Damn - minus one star for the lack of superstar chef meeting!  I didn't get my chance to meet him this time, but I'll definitely stalk him down next trip. hehe

Throughout the dinner the service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, funny, and he kept our cocktails filled (Fleurtini if you must know).  Only misstep was perhaps the long lag time between the 2nd and 3rd courses.  Not a big deal since we were just hanging out.

At the end of dinner they bring the ladies a rose from the aforementioned flower art on the wall.  This is meant to win you over after you see how much your dinner was.  HA!  Overall I thought it was worth the money and they only way it could have been better was to get to meet my fave celebrity Chef.",L27OShvycGmVOkAxD1h86A,4,4,4,wE0XEaeT2O8NsmvMF1KoJg

5736583,2011-11-14,1,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"If you want a splurge meal in Vegas without the splurge price, I'm pretty sure Fleur is it.  Our party of 4 had an outstanding meal for about $50 a head.  The food is made and plated beautifully, with the menu bent towards small dishes that are easy to share.  A rundown of the things I remember:
Caesar salad - just watch out for the anchovies.  There were these 2 salty, cold bites of fish that kind of jolted me, since the lighting was dim & didn't expect it.  Otherwise, a nice starter
ceviche - served with tortilla chips.  The seafood is nicely seasoned with a lime flavor that is strong but not overpowering.  Don't forget the guacamole on the bottom
steak tartare - parmesan flatbread, tarragon mayonnaise and finely chopped meat.  I rarely eat this, but I thought this was quite tasty
skirt steak - the chimichurri sauce was kind of thick, like salad dressing and not exactly what I was expecting.  Usually I think of chimichurri as a little more oily and thin, but the steak was cooked very nicely
lobster mac & cheese - the classic kid food, all grown up!

I could go on and on, but I want to get to dessert, because there was something that I just had to get.  The pineapple carpaccio - thin slices of fresh pineapple, some that are torched or baked in an oven so that they are crispy, with lime sorbet and CILANTRO GRANITA.  You read that correctly.  And if it sounds kind of strange, just give it a try because it will blow your mind.  Probably the best dessert that I have had all year!  

The service is attentive, and the other thing that really stood out is how everything is served beautifully.  Dishes with a lot of sauce were served in canoes like the sauteed shrimp, or the steak tartare on a flat square, that looked like it was made out of stone with the Fleur logo.  You'd swear that you're the judge on a Food Network show, the way everything comes out of the kitchen.

A tremendous value in Vegas, because you can spend way more than $50 per person and not be this happy.  Get the pineapple dessert!!!!",m8nDqQ7a3zQWfkNK1_vwnQ,3,3,4,0FcC520P09uG1d1NizGzuA
5736765,2011-12-27,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"We had been wanting to try Fleur forever! My husband and best friend accompanied me for my birthday. We were so excited to try Fleur and found the food to be hit and miss, but we had an awesome once in a lifetime experience with Hubert Keller. Here is the list of food that we tried:

Tarte flambée onion, bacon, truffle ,asparagus, crème fraiche - This was probably the highlight of the meal. So delicate and delicious we almost fought over the last piece.

Ceviche fresh daily selection, guacamole, tortilla chips - The ceviche was very good, not the best I have had (thank you Rick Bayless), but good. It was a little weird to eat since it was presented in a very deep dish and we had to ask for more chips, but overall the flavor was good. 

""In The Shower"" mac & cheese lobster, brunoise vegetable - The lobster mac and cheese was OK, nothing special. The serving size for this dish was surprising large compared to other dishes. 

Nampol meesa""wings"" spicy, salty, sweet - These are tiny little chicken wings! I found these to be very salty and lacking in the flavor department. They had a nice crispness to them, but hard to eat due to the saltiness.

Skirt steak* chimmichurri, roasted fingerling, crème fraiche - This was definitely a low point of the meal, the chimmichurri was a really weird and unappetizing paste, not a traditional chimmichurri at all. They seriously mean fingerling, you literally get 1 tiny potato, which we split 3 ways. It was delicious, but seriously?

We also tried braised beef sliders that were nothing special and some korean bbq ribs that had great flavor, but were so chewy I almost had to spit them out. Now, the meal up to this point was disappointing, but then it all changed. Hubert Keller came through the dining room and checked in with every table! He was so sweet and posed for pictures with people. When he stopped by our table my friend Lauren asked him if he could serve me a souffle. He agreed without skipping a beat. 

Now, a little history, I have never had a souffle because like the perfect man, I was waiting for the right one. Souffles are so delicate and can be done so poorly, so I wanted my first one from a real french master and I was not disappointed. Before the souffle was served, we got a complimentary birthday dessert with brownie bites and banana cupcakes. It was adorable, but nothing spectacular. 

My friend Lauren got the creme brulee and it was stunning! I thought for sure it was going to be too much custard and not enough crunchy delicious sugar topping, but the raspberry, pistachio, and vanilla were some of the best I have had. I was in love with the vanilla and there was definitely something special about this one. Then came the highlight of the meal, Hubert served me my souffle and even prepped it in front of me. He also bought it for me, which was incredibly thoughtful. The souffle was stunning and as he predicted I am now addicted to them! 

Overall, the food was disappointing but my personal theory is that a french chef will excel at french food, not tapas. This is not his niche and it was obvious. The desserts were stunning and I would go back for dessert anytime. Hubert Keller did not disappoint, he was so sweet, friendly, and accommodating. I couldn't wipe the smile off of my face for days!

- Thankfully my experience at Fleur by Hubert Keller (located in Mandalay Bay) was quite the opposite.  

- The food here was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  My husband and I are not foodies!  I am a picky eater, who doesn't care to go too far out of the box (sad, I know).  So we were hesitant to try this type of restaurant.  My husband's first concern was that there was no salt shaker on the table...lol

Our meal consisted of ....

Pan con tomate - toasted ciabatta, tomato, garlic, manchego $7

- The ciabatta bread just melted in your mouth, the fresh tomato (which I usually HATE) was divine and the manchego cheese was the perfect choice.

Prime tomahawk rib eye 40oz (well-done), shallot jus $95

- This was the BEST steak I have ever eaten.  Well-done isn't easy but they cooked it to perfection.  The plate was HUGE, we could have fed a family of four with it.  Upon first bite I thought it was going to be too salty, but I was mistaken.  The flavors just blend together and melt in your mouth.

Fingerling pomme puree, truffle jus $8

- WOW says it all!! Creamy, sweet, and delicious. I didn't want to share!!

Marble potato, shallot butter $ 8

- More WOW, they were so tender and flavorful.

We skipped desert, only because we were so full from the steak and potatoes.  But I'm sure that would not have disappointed us either.

Needless to say my husband had no need for a salt shaker his only concern was that now I found food that I liked better than his (and he's a great cook).
P.S. The leftovers didn't even survive the night!!

I went here for happy hour with a few friends recently. The food is pricey and bland, as are the drinks (and not particularly strong or worth the money.) But the service is what we were really unhappy with. 

The busboy spilled a beer ALL over my boyfriend (like, drenched his jeans and shoes.) If that had been me, I would have been mortified and so apologetic. He just said a very apathetic, ""Oh, sorry"" (like he had bumped his chair) and walked off. (Like, ""meh, it happens, whatcha gonna do."") It's not like a spilled beer is the end of the world, but when you're traveling and you brought one pair of jeans, it SUCKS to have someone completely soak you so that you 1) are uncomfortable all night and 2) smell like a stale old drunk for the rest of your vacation. 

The good (actually... let's call it the ""barely okay""): The manager did come over, and they replaced his beer. They also paid for his shoes to get cleaned but that was ONLY because my boyfriend demanded it (since otherwise his shoes were going to be ruined.) Apart from bringing him a new beer (because his was completely empty now!) and napkins, they did nothing to make it seem like they were trying to make up for it. 

The bad: They brought the bill over, and they had charged my boyfriend for his beer! I called them on it, and the waitress said, ""Oh, yeah, because we replaced it."" (Aka, they replaced the beer they spilled on him with a second one.) Yes, because HE DIDN'T DRINK ANY OF THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE YOU DUMPED IT *ON HIS LAP*. The fact that they didn't even comp him a drink (not to mention anyone else) is ridiculous, and the waitress seemed genuinely shocked that we would even think they should have. Seriously? Do they not understand the low cost to the restaurant to comp one drink? When I wouldn't let it go, the waitress said, ""Oh, I guess I can take that off."" When she brought the bill back, she did the super fake, ""So sorry about that, I hope you have a great night"" blah blah blah fake nice stuff you do when you've just realised you're probably getting a really shitty tip. (Aka, the ""too little too late"" fake niceness.) 

I would never go back. it's not the fact that they spilled a drink, that happens. It was more the attitude. I don't care when restaurants screw up, it's how they handle it. It's clearly a place where they know they're in a casino and will get business no matter what, so they're really not concerned about customer's experience.",v2HxTx0A8MkJ1oM1yJ4www,9,2,1,CKfJdRy1rVLKaTYTd8Aezg
5752477,2011-01-26,0,YuiM5VKscO8rS1EX7f19_g,"I feel silly for not realizing this was a ""Tapas"" style place when my boyfriend and I got excited at how inexpensive some of these delicious sounding items were. It was super late and we were hungry, but wanted something that would be unique, and me being a Top Chef fan, I really was excited about trying a Hubert Keller place!

When I saw the 5000 dollar burger on the menu, I knew something was up and asked our server, to which she shyly replied that they don't like to call it ""tapas"" here. My boyfriend was immediately weary but I was still pretty excited to try good food!

The best way to describe some of the food is ""whimsical"" - my boyfriend got chicken croquettes and the skirt steak, which said came with ""fingerling potato."" When it came out it was literally *one* fingerling potato made to look like a mini baked potato. I kind of laugh at this moment, but it was more of a sad laughter. I understand that the chef is trying to make his dishes a tad more affordable to the average person, but a single fingerling? I didn't know whether this was a joke to be admired or weirded out by.

Same with my dishes - I wish I had ordered a few more things, but I got some fried chickpeas, and the gnocchi. While they were *definitely* the best gnocchis I've had before, there were only four plated. Really brief dish that was hard to appreciate when theres so little there to remember!

However the desserts were definitely some of my favorite during the trip. I loved the cheesecake lollipops - they were beautiful, and tasted amazing - coated in white chocolate, gingerbread and a checkered short bread cookie, with fresh strawberry puree dipping sauce. We also got the creme brule sampler - Cookie dough, Lavender, and Earl Grey. These were so creamy, light and were meant to be eaten slowly. 

We were also given a complimentary lobster mac and cheese but neither of us eat fish so that was a bittersweet moment! We totally loved the gesture, though.

I am not against the idea of tapas but I think they should re-evaluate their plating to be a bit more giving due to the steep prices. I would have rather tried Bouchon than this, but serendipity left us at Fleur's door. Definitely a good light meal, however.",FucUIUbYeZ4LSwfVoRf8Ww,0,0,4,Xxr1jLyc-eaUmmZaDc8d6A

Went for Mother's Day.
Nice and slow when we went , right before dinner rush. All servers paying us full attention. Great bunch of people who work there. Julio/ Javier was our server. Cant remember his name, I'm sure it was all the wine parings that did that. But he was great!

So being our first time we decide to go with the 2 person 4 course, with wine paring. 
Was really nice.
 1st course : Ahi tuna tacos ( i did not try I am allergic) Along with beef carpaccio wrapped around a thai salad, next to a smudge of sriracha sauce. Paired with sparkling wine. I am pretty sure beef carpaccio was one of the best things I had that night. Who would have thought raw meat would be so pleasant. 

2nd course : White onion soup with toasted bread and wonderful fantastic fatty fat bone marrow. Next to it, a little cup of sautéed red onions. Spread it all on the bread and enjoy with soup. This was paired with a sweet Riesling. Sweet creamy onions, was all over this dish. Will come back and prob get it again.

3rd course: Shrimp and grits. The grits were like a warm cream cheese concoction, the shrimp had  BBQ tomato sauce, nice and smokey. With that a plate of indescribable octopus. My mom said it reminded her of the octopus she would eat in Greece. Something her mom would cook! She told me about my grandmother beating the ink out of an octopus on a rock in the back yard.
This dish was paired with a really good French Chardonnay. I think this was my favorite wine of ALL.

It should have ended there. But the last course was maybe my least favorite

4th course: Skirt steak with garlic fries. It was ok, nothing special. Sauce was ok kind of undefined .In question of why we didn't get mac n cheese, I see it on other reviews.... The scallops and green aioli sauce was great, loved the mini veggies. Ate it up....Actually took most of the steak to go, was just pretty full from all the wine, damn.
 Everything was good though, just too full for red meat, don't usually eat much of it. 

Dessert: Beignets with raspberry sauce and vanilla. Very charming. Paired with dessert wine.

All in all it was great. We sat in a good spot, got to watch people walk by, laugh and drink really good wine. My favorite thing surprisingly has to be ; the bone marrow! So good. Also I liked the carpaccio. Id go again, but for lunch!",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,3,2,4,jvIrSAaZBueKt2sopFOSug

I also ordered the tarte flambée onion, bacon, truffle, asparagus which is basically like a flat bread. I thought this dish was not that great but I did manage to finish it because I was hungry.

Started off with an amuse bouche which was a piece of fried cod over a potato salad.. It was quite pleasant and was an excellent prelude to Chef Hubert Keller's tasting menu....Next I had the truffled onion soup followed by sea bass wrapped in a pan seared chorizo covering.... Both were absolutely amazing and made me wish I could have ""MUCH"" more... The next dish was the filet mignon and finally a small platter of chocolates 
and ice-cream with a caramel drizzle..... Both items were also very pleasing to the palate and will
not be forgotten soon... As for my girlfriends dishes, all I can remember is the short ribs with Guinness foam and tuna tartare... They 
were equally impressive.... Bedsides the unforgettable food I have to say that the service was great.. Most tasting menu types of experiences I've had in the past have came accompanied with somewhat unapproachable waiters that can't even crack a smile.. The 
staff at Fleur de Lys are both friendly and professional... My only slight complaint is that the pacing of the tasting menu is quite fast..The pace has always been a little more relaxed during my other tasting menu 
experiences at other fine establishments, but I guess this is how they ensure that the masses of Vegas tourists can eat here without having to spend too much time sitting around... 
Overall my experience at Fleur de Lys was an excellent one that I highly recommend to others if you have the extra money to spend 
as it will cost a pretty penny, but is totally worth the experience..

That's what the buffet inside the hotel is for. If you're looking for mouth-watering food that comes in very small portions, then Fleur is the right place for you. I wanted to eat a smaller portion of food so I wasn't bloated or uncomfortable for a night of bar/club hopping, so I settled on the 8 oz Hanger Steak with their Fingerling Potato Puree.

All I can say is: Wow. The Hanger Steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor was unlike anything I've had. But surprisingly enough, the Potato Puree stole the show. So creamy, so buttery, so perfectly seasoned. I dipped each bite of the steak in the potato puree to get both tastes in one bite. Probably the best decision I made during my entire 5-day stay in Las Vegas. The food is too good to pass up. If you're inside Fleur, make sure to order these two items and eat them together.

Food: 4/5
Location: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Experience: 4/5


The Verdict: 4/5

Let me start with the experience.

I did a reservation a week before the actual dinner date. Surprisingly, getting a table on a Saturday night was no problem at all. Then again, I've rarely had any problems getting a reservation on any restaurant at the Las Vegas trip from the numerous times I've gone. 

My group of friends and I took a cab from Treasure Island, where we were staying and traveled to Mandalay Bay. This also was my first time going to this part of the strip since I normally stay in the Bellagio to Wynn part of the strip. The hotel was nothing surprising, just your typical casino with heavy foot traffic being it a Saturday night.

We then made it to the restaurant, 8:30 pm on a Saturday night. One word to describe it - Dead! I was amazed that for a restaurant owned by a famous Chef, no one was eating there. Call me easily swayed, but normally, it's a cardinal rule in my book when selecting a place to eat.  ""Only eat in a restaurant that's packed - meaning, they have great food, ascertained by its patrons"" Take note though, I'm from San Francisco so I was basing my take on this to Fleur De Lys, another Hubert Keller restaurant. 

Ambiance:

We got sat down, although the place is nice and the décor was ""modernesque artsy"", with high ceilings, I didn't like how the restaurant had a feel of being open. It's hard to describe because when I like the ambiance of a restaurant, I like a feel of warmth. The place being opened took some points away In my book. The Ipad on the table where you can order a drink and dessert was both an eye catcher and an eyesore, being a big bulk in the middle of our table.

Food:

The items we got included. Foie Gras, Osso Bucco, Mac and Cheese, Sliders, Clam Noodle and their Burger. 

The Foie, as expeted was decadent. It was soft, silky and was just heavenly. Having not eaten this for almost a year, since California made it illegal for Duck liver being sold and served at restaurants. 

The Osso Bucco was good too. It came with 2 medium size shanks, which were soft, luscious and bursting with flavor. What really is the star of this entre dish is the Pollenta that comes with it. The side dish comes in a VERY petite sauceresque dish. Let me just tell you, I can eat a Big BOWL of that. It tasted truffley, earthy, cheesy and just cest magnifique! A suggestion and tip for Fleur, Make a bowl of this polenta with some beef flakes on top - it be a big hit! It would be an easy $30 entrée there.

The Mac and Cheese, The burger, and the sliders were typical with no surprises. Underwhelming for a good rated restaurant.

Service:
The waiters were on top of their game, always asking if we needed anything. They filled up our water glasses without being asked, and simply was just excellent. The greeter on the podium who was towering tall seemed to be aloof and was not engaged. We didn't have to deal with her that much, so I didn't care for her.

Our dinner ended with the serving giving a small complimentary dessert plate. It came with 2 cake pops with a slight bed of nuts and berries. Again, okay but nothing WOW. Haha

This restaurant is a good weekend food destination but not that great to be a one off, splurge of the moment, special occasion place.

If anyone would like to doubt Hubert Keller's cooking abilities, you'd better be able to back that up with some evidence. All the plates that we had for dinner here had incredible flavor and presentation. The cool thing about tapas places is the variety that you get with every dish and since you're sharing and the large amount of dishes you can order. But that is where Fleur fails. The dishes are extraordinarily expensive per bite and they often serve tapas in servings of 3s. Now, I'm no expert in the field but I saw that most tables held 4 or some sort of even number so it seemed like a ploy to get you to order 2 plates in order to get enough for a table. Not a problem until you factor in the prices of each plate for just a few bites. At an average of $3-4 a bite, you're not talking chump change for anyone. I don't care how freaking rich you are and I'm not even averaging in that crazy $75 standalone Fleur burger (or add another $4.9k and get a '95 Petrus and bragging rights).

I'm not here to debate the pricing of restaurants, especially those in large-rent Las Vegas hotels, but Fleur seemed to be a bit over-the-top in that department and in that sense, I didn't find the food worth the money even though it was pretty darn spectacular. Ergo, I can't give you a five star rating Fleur, sorry babe.

However, if you do feel a bit spendy and would like to try some one-of-a-kind tapas, go and eat. Avocado, crab, and watermelon gazpacho? It was a refreshing taste explosion that I would eat every day if I could. Tuna Tacos? Probably the best little bite I've had in a while.

A vegas joint that delivers a non-vegas experience.

Hubert Keller is a gifted lad. and I am pleased that his gift has not been polluted like so many of the other named chefs.

I have always been a fan of the small plates concept, Spain nailed it years ago and appetizers are just about the right size to take a risk on something.

This take is refreshing in so many ways. It is one of those places that you spend a lot of time looking at the other tables to see what creation they have.

We had :
The salt cod fritters
Smoked ribs
Oysters on dry ice
Skirt steak
Merguez sausage
Hamachi
Souffle
Cheesecake Popsicle

It was all perfect. (wouldn't bother with the cheesecake again or the sausage not bad just so many other things to try)

A late dinner, so the restaurant was fairly quiet... and the server was slow and disinterested.  About halfway through the meal, a bar across the way started playing 80s/90s covers which could be heard loudly in the bar.  I'd avoid late night dinners at Fleur due to the fact that the music kills the mood!  [But I won't let it bring this yelp review down, as dinner was still delicious.]  The atmosphere there is pleasant and the décor is nice.

We ordered the following:  1) Chicken croquettes, which had a nice flavor, were soft and delicious, with a clean presentation as it was served with a few greens.  If I returned, I'd pass on this dish - for what you got, it wasn't worth it.  2) Sliders, two of these came with a few French fries in a shot glass 25% full of ketchup.  French fries were an easy pass - the sliders were perfect.  3) Croque monsieur.  This is one of my all time favorite sandwiches, and the one there hit the mark.  It was a mini sized sandwich with great presentation and delicious cheese.  Go there, order this, and enjoy.  4) Gnocci.  Very well balanced and fragile tasting.  Small in size.

So much to our delight, Paul's Vegas birthday dinner would be held at Fleur restaurant in Mandalay Bay, Hubert Keller's (Top Chef Master-du-jour) most recent epicurean establishment specializing in modern global tapas with a hint of traditional French flair. Keller's more formal Fleur de Lys temporarily closed this past September to make way for his first attempt at more innovative casual group dining, thus Fleur was born to accommodate the general public (and their accompanying savory palette it seems).

Problem is, when a creative genius like Keller submits to ""dumbing down"" his cuisine for popular vote who does he really hurt? Food snobs like myself plus 30 others who deemed Fleur's fare wayyyyy too salty to devour all 12 small plates (plus 3 desserts)? His growing legion of Top Chef fans who expect all of the French flavors but none of the pretentious French snootiness that accompanies such fame? Seems that as your star power grows so does your social responsibility to appeal to the masses, which in turn may affect the bourgeoisie, but definitely not the bottom line baby. 

Hope it doesn't sound too much like I'm complaining because 15 dishes for $45pp, plus a personal meet-and-greet with Keller himself sounds like a steal to me!
