Maybe its just hidden so well, or perhaps it looks a bit quiet and uneventful (never go with your first impression, because its usually wrong!). I finally decided to drop by after eyeing the place forever. Since I've had beef shawarma before I wanted to explore something different, so chicken shawarma it was! Also slightly hinted by the waiter. The order was made fast, price was reasonable, and the shawarma was outstanding for an order out. The chicken was super juicy (herbed and spiced out) the pita was thin and crispy, and everything was just wrapped perfectly.  I will have to do a second tour of this location, hopefully a dinner event with SHAWARMA LOVERS.",0S6OtXUGAZX__HuXlqIO0g,0,1,5,au8ZSjYfFoMCCIU2ouEc5g

The pita served hot at the table with olive oil dipping sauce gets me coming back for that alone. Friendly staff greets you with a smile and service is excellent.

Also, I was totally impressed by the warm flat bread & dipping olive oil (w/ herbs & sesame seeds). It warmed my belly.

832271,2012-09-16,0,BzqwAx_KlRPAMGXw1xHXag,"The Garden Cafe is on the end of a mall row right off South Eastern and Just past  Warm Springs. The Cafe is well lit during the day by big windows. The place isn't cluttered or small. There is a lot of room. We were taken by the sparkle. The entire place was scrubbed clean and shiny. So, our first impression walking in the door was that ""These Folks really take their place seriously."" believe me they sure do.

The menu was very well laid out. It was easy to read and the colors brought many of the items to your attention. When it comes to Mediterranean food I judge by the Tabbouleh. If a place can't put together a well make fresh Tabbouleh we just take out tent down and go home. This wonderful salad of parsley, tomatoes, onion and mint is traditional. At the Garden Cafe it was spectacular. The absolutely freshest and flavorful concoction I've ever had. The base was mounds of chopped parsley, green onion, mint, and tomato. I believe I detected a slight back ground taste of garlic. To this mixture they add fresh lemon juice and olive oil. Tabbouleh (tabouli) is a favorite of mine and there for I speak with some authority when I tell you it is the best I have ever had.

Libby ordered Chicken Kabobs and I the mixed kabobs of beef, chicken, and kafta. Both our platters came with a tasty rice mixture, tomato, onion, and a thin slice of dill pickle spear. The crowning glory of this meal were the pitas. These were perfect, fresh made, puffed, and browned. It was a pure pleasure to put Tabbouleh, onion, tomato and my kafta into a half of a pita and savor the fine combination of flavors. All the meats were hot, juicy, and spiked with flavor.

Our service here was quick, as quick as anything made fresh to order can be. The staff folks were friendly to the point that I really want to go there again just to feel so wanted and among the wonderful people.

Our next trip here will be very soon. I intend to start with some Baba Ghanoug (ghanoush) (eggplant) and then on to more Tabbouleh, and probably Shawarma beef. Maybe I will get to some of the luscious looking Baklava.

All you ""round the world eaters"" don't miss this it is at the top of the list for Mediterranean cuisine or any other cuisine for that matter.",3WHmc6WQ_jk_fIp-dJDKyA,3,2,5,nPC4hxWmOoSRmlwZPLf3VA

Nobody acknowledged us as we walked through the doors. We were really confused on what to do,there was no sign to seat yourself or wait to be seated... Then we walked up to the huge menu they had on the wall and two men behind the counter continued on whatever it was they were doing... No hello or wait one moment... Nothing... I work in sales and my husband works at wolf gang puck.. So I'm very big on customer service... You don't have to be perfect at customer service but I mean come on... The grown men there could have said hello? I'm sure the owner wouldn't appreciate how they treated us... So I finally asked ""do we seat ourselves and wait to order or order then seat ourselves?"" And the one man said ""yeah"".... An I was like ""yeah we seat ourselves or yeah we order first"".... Still very confused and annoyed by that point ... Then the man said ""order first""... Then we ordered the guy took forever and was horrible at taking our order... He didn't even smile or look at us in the eyes... Nothing...we ordered a few things on the menu and the total was about 21 dollars... The man still did little things that bugged me while ordering our food on the computer... Like I asked for just two waters for our drinks and he was like ""ummmm okay that's free....""I was just thinking Okay??  Like okay i dont care if its free or not? i want a water?... Anyway we finally sat down .. Food came out pretty quickly... Food was amazing!!! We got two salads, humus with bread and some fries... VERY GOOD...nothing about it we didn't like... My mom told me that she was waited on my the owner the last time she had came and he was very nice.... So I'm sure it was just these two men working that in my opinion make the restaurant bad... Costumer serious is ""key"" in my opinion... It made me never want to go back here just because of it...I mean its not that hard to put on a smile and say ""hey what's up guys how's it goin today""... Is it? Like I said... I'm sure the owner wouldn't be to happy how he treated us...",4vD95vvPty7dcG98CMFNNw,0,0,2,U8xTq2Bcoz8iTDgnjGJMBw
1807457,2012-09-06,0,BzqwAx_KlRPAMGXw1xHXag,"Really lovely place. I have been to many Middle Eastern eateries and the proprietor is so kind and accommodating, the place is spacious and clean, the kabab plates are really delicious and all the food is halal. 

I have to eat gluten-free and he made sure to accommodate my disease as much as he could, but beware the rice. The rice has noodles in it and I am unsure whether they are rice noodles or wheat based ones. I ate a few bites before I realized; regardless, it was delicious :) The rice with noodles are actually the ones I prefer when it comes to taste, way better than yellow rice usually served at similar restaurants.

We ordered the kafta kabab plate and the beef/lamb shawarma plate. I preferred the kabab. We also ordered the chicken kabab plate, fetoush salad and hummus to go. The chicken with the garlic sauce was delicious as well.

Loved the traditional pickles and tomatoes that come with the plates. A little bit too much parsley over everything, but that's tradition. Definitely get the pita with the hummus, it you can, and skip the fetoush salad. The salad was kind of sad with few vegetables and mostly iceberg. Overall everything else was so tasty that I would definitely recommend this place.",SZ_cx5cRVI2bW0aGFbkiBw,0,0,4,s-Grhlwyo8n-M3tOoyBNQg
1850803,2012-06-09,1,BzqwAx_KlRPAMGXw1xHXag,"This place is outrageous, i had a party of 10 people and we were the only ones in the place. The owner i presume takes our order but decides to NOT WRITE it down so he doesn't mess it up the order. instead he just tries to play it by memory.

we wait at least 30 minutes before we get our food, and of course when the food comes out its all the wrong order. the FOOD its self was a very small portion I had the beef and lamb Schwarma which was dry and not enough meat was put in. i paid $2 extra for fries and received literally 7 fries, i counted.

and even when the guy messed up the order and we told him and he still billed us the wrong items. HORRIBLE service, FOOD is over priced. DO NOT GO.",q4kRGLH1eKFKAJAlq1Ct7A,2,1,1,XgMxqPliy0cmC7Ko5JInfw

It's one of those places you go, and literally anything and everything you try is amazing--every item is a perfect specimen of its type--down to the crunchy sweet onions or the flaky fresh bread. And surprisingly, each item costs less than you would get it most anywhere else. I even pulled up some other similar places that I go to often, and as I thought, this place was consistently a few dollars cheaper on every item. I don't know how they can give such good quality for cheaper than their competitor's. I hope a lot of people come here and keep it open, because this place is awesome and I want to try EVERYTHING!",A2jvkL3yskY_C6zFkmAqiQ,2,0,5,Nz0CxXPvzt_pKNYYyER94A

The setting is simple and for very casual dining. The atmosphere is comfortable and the coast is clear for you to bring the kids as the clients are not pretentious. Now for the real reason people read reviews... the prices are wonderful, the food is spectacular and the service is good. Again, this is a casual dining restaurant, however if it is good food your looking for, this is the place! It beats many of the other high priced Mediterranean eateries.

I love Amena and they have the best pita bread, but it turns out Garden Cafe's home made pita bread is right up there with Amena.
They also make fantastic vegetarian food including lentil soup, fuul (omg, yum!), and the best baba ganoush I've ever had. In fact, this place gets lots of superlatives from me.
The only thing I've had that I didn't love was the hummos.
They have backgammon boards and free wifi.

4633848,2011-09-30,0,BzqwAx_KlRPAMGXw1xHXag,I agree. This place is good. I have been here a few times and the food is always fresh. I love the Gyros and I have had the plates also. They have good salads. I have had the pizza which is fair and I say that because it is your typical Med-type New-York style pizza which I don't personally care for. So others who like that type of pizza might think it is great. The restaurant is newer and clean along with the bathrooms (another way I judge the restaurants).

The interior is large, plain and was totally devoid of customers at 9PM on the Wednesday evening of our visit though one other customer arrived for take out.  I also noticed there were additional tables on the outside patio.  

I ordered the mixed kabob platter, but was told they were out of beef.  We ended up each ordering chicken kabob plates that included rice, pickle, a mayonnaise/lemon sauce and house baked pita bread. The small pieces of chicken were not on kabobs, no ever had been, and the longer we lingered, the drier each tiny morsel became.  The fresh baked pita and service were probably the highlights of our meal.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,1,2,0Oa5W5QGQdoa1InVB7d8JA

I've been here a few times and had the following so far:

Combo kabob plate - steak, chicken and a seasoned ground beef. All were well seasoned, moist, tasty .Served with very tasty rice. The dipping sauce looked and tasted like mayo, plain not seasoned, mayo. What the ??!!
Anyway, I got over the shock and enjoyed the rest of this meal.

Another time, I had the falafel and they were perfect to my taste. The tahini sauce was very good.

We arrived around 12:15 and the place was pretty empty. More people trickled in after we ordered but it wasn't too crowded. My coworkers ordered the gyro lunch special. I set my sites on the lamb schwarma sandwich but at last minute I decided to try the soujouk sandwich with fries and diet soda. The guy taking my order (I presume he was the owner) promised I would like the soujouk and highly recommended it.

Our food came out quickly and everyone was pretty pleased with their meals. I felt the portion size was a little slim for the price, but I definitely didn't feel cheated. The sandwich was tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I'll had to try them again to see if I like any of their other food better. I'd definitely skip the fries next time and opt for a salad or some rice instead. They were definitely lackluster. 

Overall, we had a good meal and I am still looking forward to trying some of their menu items and giving them another chance.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,8,3,PMyAbH1-qFxoyJDXO3rqKQ
