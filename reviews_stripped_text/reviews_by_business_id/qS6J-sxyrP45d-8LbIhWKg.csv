510305,2016-01-05,0,qS6J-sxyrP45d-8LbIhWKg,"Very cool sports bar about 10-15 minutes northeast of Downtown. It caters to Hispanics, but all races and ages are welcome. It has a warm atmosphere, and the bartenders and servers are friendly. The food is upper-scale sports bar food with a yummy Mexican twist, but the burgers also rock. The ceviche (multiple kinds) are delicious and the portions pretty generous. 

They have lots of TV's, but call ahead to make sure they are showing whatever game you want to see.

Look for the underwear and bras, lol. It makes all my friends laugh when they finally spot it. There are tables to sit at with life size posters of famous Latin American Icons to take pictures with. 

The staff has always been super friendly although they can take a long time between serving the tables so ask for more in advanced to avoid issues.  

The first chips and salsa are free. The green salsa is yummy! Get a remedio trust me",UzmO7EjFDYEfXXgG1kRw3Q,0,0,5,91fjVZjEAezz7bxH0r3gcQ

The bartender if she can put it on, there was no one sitting at the bar so she did charge it but gave me attitude the whole time, a few minutes she comes back and asked ""what do you want!"" I asked for a menu since I bought someone with me that has never been there. She slammed the menu on the bar, we order a michelada that looked runny no flavor she didn't even bother to make it right. It didn't look the picture at all she just put whatever she felt in the drink. Then I asked for chips and salsa and they never came. I was EMBARRASSED to have spoken highly of this place to my company.
The service was horrible. If your employee has a attitude maybe send them home or hire someone more welcoming that will help your business instead of failure. This was my second attempt to coming here last time I went I had my 50+ year aunt with me and they wouldn't serve us bc she didn't have her id but she wasn't even going to drink. We took our group of 10+pleople to downtown since is so close for better service and cheap beers!",8totjCs0BfYLqOF_T13Mlg,0,1,1,vlgNPlkIlF-_bzSLH-Vpog

3860236,2015-12-13,0,qS6J-sxyrP45d-8LbIhWKg,"I came here on a fight night to watch UFC fights. My group got there very early so it was dead. Just a few people at the bar and maybe 2 or 3 other tables besides us. No hostess, nobody seated us, it took a girl about 10 minutes to bring us chips and salsa and the another 20 minutes to ask for our drink order. Luckily, the UFC event was long so we were in no rush. We ordered mangoneadas, micheladas, and remedios drinks. They were great and I highly recommend them. 
We also ordered the torta, burger, and I got an order of hot wings. The torta and burger were small portions and we're just...eh. 
I ordered the hot wings with tamarindo sauce. They were really good actually! However, I was upset because the menu clearly said ""acompañadas con papas fritas"" which means ""comes with French fries."" When I received my order, there were no fries. I asked the server about my fries and she said it doesn't come with fries. So I picked up the menu again to make sure it wasn't my error and it clearly said it came with fries. So I asked again and showed her where it said that. She said, ""Yeah I know it says that but it doesn't come with fries."" Wait, what? Why would you refuse what's on your menu? Or why wouldn't you correct your menu? That made me so mad about this place.
However, my friends shared their fries with me and they had no flavor so I guess I saved myself some empty calories. 

For a UFC event, it actually wasn't super crowded so it's a good place to watch events. However, I recommend eating somewhere else and coming here just for drinks. The food won't blow you away but the drinks are great!

Oh, and the music they play is extremely loud. It's nice to have Mexican music playing but you seriously have to yell in someone's ear so they can hear you. It got a little annoying. Turn it down a bit!",TXZRWst2LMfaKRGF4DAxDA,0,0,1,_E-yO924FgDDnoX9tgcUnQ

4790998,2015-03-29,4,qS6J-sxyrP45d-8LbIhWKg,"Horrible experience the second time I went!! If your a female & your at the bar make sure you sit by the male bartenders work area!!! the female bartenders are horrible they wont interact with you nor ask you if u need any drink or more drinks!!! you will have to wait for ever till they actually acknowledge you so u can order another drink!!!! Also if you order food!! ewwww don't get the calamari that was so gross!! it tasted like rubber!! 
Also the music is ok but its just way to loud, you cant have a conversation with someone next to you; you will have to yell at each other. (to be able to hear one another) 
My tip for the Female bartenders would be to acknowledge all of your clients, and actually smile and try to interact a little. Make us feel welcomed!!! 
also to the owner or whom ever is in charge of the audio set up; turn the volume just a little down!! (I would also play more verity of music as well) it gets a little boring!    To top it off it's a SPORTS Bar & all they have on the tv's playing are music videos!!! lmao!!!!
