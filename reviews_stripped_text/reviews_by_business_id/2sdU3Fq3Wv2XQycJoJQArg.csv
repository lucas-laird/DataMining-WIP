The adobo fried rice: I get that some people do garlic fried rice and others don't. No points lost on the non-garlic fried rice. Points were lost in the uncooked, undercooked meat. The pork and chicken adobo pieces were raw.

Shrimp Lumpia: uncooked shrimp.

Chicken adobo: uncooked chicken.

Pork adobo: under cooked pork.

225071,2010-07-03,0,2sdU3Fq3Wv2XQycJoJQArg,"Salo-Salo Grill is an impressive Filipino restaurant. If you know Filipino cuisine, you know that most dishes take at least an hour to cook and it varies from province to province. In addition, it's not as aesthetically pleasing to eye as other foods. However, the Salo-Salo Grill turned that perception around for me. 

The first thing I noticed was that it was a sit-down restaurant and the ambiance consisted of warm toned walls jeweled with traditional art which stands out from a lot of Filipino restaurants I've been to. Second, the food was served in an appealing manner. I ordered the Laing which is a coconut based soup/stew and light pink/purple in color but it was served in a bowl lined with banana leaves which boosted the aesthetics. Best of all, the food was really good and as good as my mom's cooking if not better. Don't tell her I said that though!

The only con, during our second visit it took about 30 minutes for us to get our food. However, the first time we went there were only two other tables occupied and the second time the whole restaurant was filled and there were a lot of people waiting to be seated.",6vp021k-EOBEk-zSETddfQ,0,0,4,LaqQGXRgIrhevLI-8_9xiA

The YUMMY dishes are Inihaw Na Talong (grilled eggplant with a side of shrimp paste), Laing (taro leaves in coconut milk = sweet, but not a dessert), Adobo Fried Rice, Vegetable or Meat Kare-Kare (great tasting peanut sauce), and Hawaiian Pork BBQ. The Sizzling Chicken Adobo is OK too.

With that said, I was not too fond of their Inihaw Na Pusit (charbroiled squid). It was too chewy and tough for my liking.

They give you free salted nuts as an appetizer.

PARKING = Plenty in the lot.

SERVICE = Missing 1 star because things can be super slow on the weekends when there are more customers. Although we've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table, our ordering, food, and water refills were sometimes just too slow.",W0UyJVdWcQQpy0BT-NHUtQ,0,0,4,EQET8_Djb5NJMHp9ihq17g

The menu said it would come with fish balls, but it came instead with pork and a half an egg.  

We also ordered the chicken adobo - which the menu read it'd be in a sizzling sauce - but it just came in a bowl.  It was mostly dark meat which I actually prefer but my niece was hoping for more white.  The sauce was very yummy but that's what I expected as I laddled it over my rice :)

The last dish - which ended up being way too much food for three people - was the Relyeno Bangus which is a pan fried whole milkfish which they completed gutted and deboned and mixed the fish with onions and some other ingredients which again was different than what their menu stated - however, incredibly yummy and flavorful.  

I'd love to come back as the restaurant has an open seating area that they can open the windows which would give the feeling of outdoor dining when it's nice out.  We were there in the middle of the day on Saturday and there were tons of people carrying out cater orders which was nice to see.  I'd love to come back with a larger group so we can try more yummy things.

Two things  - didn't expect is this place is a franchise as it seems very family oriented and the prices online are different - and ask the server to leave a pitcher of water (or whatever you're drinking) on the table as we had too many empty glasses too many times.",kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA,0,1,4,vZiZQgj_WgD4cQMNT4o5dw

The first visit impressed us with their generous portion of grilled fish, and squid as well as our deep fried meat selections, although they were understaffed at that particular time, it was okay- we were hungry! 
The second time we went was a complete disappointment because there were 2 servers and cook and we ordered several items from the menu and with only like an hour before they closed- the waitress was not smiling and was in a rush taking our orders. 
When our order came- it was not  a generous portion in a large platter but like half that came in. Cost cutting? We weren't finished from our late dinner, and they closed the check, not making it to our dessert yet. After this horrible experience, wherein the waitress wasn't in the best of mood to serve and get rid of us- we never got back anymore and will never recommend this place.

Third visit which was today, April 29,2012- we came back because of a dear friend celebrate his birthday here.

We hate to write a negative but it was worth to do so! So here it goes, even there was a reservation for about 30 people in a 24 hour basis there was no effort on their part to seclude us in a function room to which they are the exclusive caterers. They were slow and have no other events or other customers at 3 pm.
Our group ended up in their usual area seating us in 2 long tables plus 2 regular tables- which was  fine. We are all hungry! 
But with this prior party  arrangement- only about 2-3 of their people were staffed to cook, cater and serve this exclusive event. The guests all had to ask for drinking water because it wasn't done along the course of our meal. It was given after several request and approaching their counter to get it  done! 
The  only one waitress busy was trying to push the sale of sago, gulaman and halo2 at the start the meal. 
The inihaw and the pinakbet was bland. What happened to the real cuisine from way back then?
Where's the friendly and hospitable atmosphere here that we expect as treatment  from our very own kababayans? 
The service was slow ,no smiling and amiable employees fom amongst them at all! There was no interpersonal relation as greeting Happy Birthday to our celebrant friend and assisting them, in the flow of the party, to the lighting of our cake,
The staff  seem so unhappy with their job- we work in the food, hotel and service industry that's how we know the tools of the trade. Give your customers pure, undivided and personalized attention and deliver the goods as expected and you have one happy customer!
There was no welcome and thank you greeting from either of them from start of seating to the departing of the last guest.
It was a complete nightmare in the 2 hour birthday celebration, as regards to our expectation and standards. You need to train your employees to offer more personalized customer service and interaction- to obtain more business and make your customers happy and come back!

Marinated just right, a little sweet and a little tangy, and very moist and tender. The pork was cooked perfectly but could use a little more flavor. The skewers were both amazing.

We also got the sisig, adobo fried rice and pinak bet. The sisig was really good. Very good flavor. And our kids (and my wife and I) looooved the adobo fried rice.

She's craving for crispy pata so called the resto first to make sure they have if fresh. I was told they're not busy ( it's about 4pm) & it will not take long. So we went, we're the only customers at that time.  

We ordered crispy pata, kare-kare & the seafood platter. It didn't even took 15 minutes for them to serve our orders so what do you expect!

1) The pata was NOT CRISPY and the worst is IT was COLD!!! We could have walked out of there but opted to call the waitress & told her. They haphazardly re-fried it;

2) The seafood platter w/c was supposed to be inihaw or broiled came COLD as well! the shrimps looked like it came from the fridge. All the items that came in the platter looked sadly unappetizing!

3) I had better kare-kare. Theirs was served in a tin can inside a clay pot or palayok! I don't understand that. It was not a good presentation at all.

I was sad because this experience is another explanation of WHY the Filipino food & restaurant for that matter cannot be in the main stream like the Vietnamese or Thai. The Pinoy mentality of ""pwede na"" has no place in the restaurant business, in my opinion. You need to put your best out there as you are representing the Philippines!

I'm calling the owners/managers of this restaurant to evaluate your menu style & presentation and quality of the dishes. Good luck!

I still stand by my word that this place has the best Filipino food I've ever had in my life. With that said, why 4 stars? The past couple days I've came in twice and the service was just not up to par with the food. We waited about half an hour for one thing to finally come out (granted the place was pretty busy for Mother's day), but if the place is ever gonna be that busy, they should hire more chefs. That wasn't the thing that irked me to re-review this restaurant though. Today, my girlfriend was having a huge halo halo craving. We tried Cafe de Cebu, but the halo halo just wasn't as good as Salo Salo's. So we drove the extra half mile to get some real halo halo.

We called in as we were driving so it would be ready as soon as we got there. We only ordered one item too. When I walked in to pay, the waitress said there had to be a minimum $20 for card use ($20 is kind of a lot for a minimum! Especially if you're dining alone). I totally understand this rule and where it comes from, but I just completely did not have cash on me at all. I told them that they can just put an extra charge or whatever that most stores do when you don't reach the minimum. The lady was nice enough to say ""it's all right, but next time just remember that we charge a minimum $20."" So all was cool until they continued to twist my arm to buy more things after that statement. They were probably half joking, but that can definitely make a customer feel uncomfortable, which it made me feel.

So all in all, this place still has amazing food that will blow your palate away if you've never had Filipino food or even if you have, it's still really good!

I recently went to an anniversary party in town, and they chose to get their food catered from Salo Salo. We walked into the restaurant at 3:00 PM on a Saturday, and there were surprisingly four parties dining in. But we were here to pick up our phone order items: There were supposedly 15 people expected to attend, but somehow we ended up with 25-30 guests in staggered fashion.  And the food was still too much. Here is the stuff we got::

- large order of meat only lumpia, with no veggies inside
- an order of skewered chicken, beef, and pork
- a fried seafood platter  with whole Milkfish (Bangus), fried calamari rings, fried shrimp, and fried mussel with two whole fried eggplant,garnish.  
- meat lover's BBQ special platter (chicken pieces, BBQ bistec, BBQ pork ribs. 
- lechon kawali (cubed and seasoned fried pork with crispy texture and crispy skin with we Filipinos treasure), served with an all purpose sauce
- large order of pansit (glass noodle pasta with chicken, shrimp, and pork. )

Our order was ready right at the time it was promised, and it was  fairly well packed to travel on the road. They made sure the crisply lumpia had holes in cover, and it was only 3/4 covered so that it would be vented properly and not all spill out.

The food was a hit.  Everyone, me included, thought the food tasted really good.  The two dishes I didn't like too much were the lumpia which reminds me of institutional style food and the pansit which had way too much patis (fish sauce) for my taste. Guests brought some other stuff, including lots of white rice, green salad, and steamed winter veggies.  My mom made some some homemade desserts (bibngka, a baked casava coconut milk cake, suman, a sweet rice and brown sugar coconut milk mixture which is baked and topped with brown sugar glaze, and creamy fruit salad with some tropical fruit and young coconut.). 

Most of the Filipinos in this party, including the older adults, are fairly skinny or average in weight (I'm getting a gut, however).  The food was only half eaten two hours after the 3:30 PM dinner start time.  How were we to finish this food?  Well, thankfully, the reinforcements came. They included my two half Samoan nephews and their father and another older nephew Mike who is 5'11 and 220 pounds.  They mowed down an additional third of the food between them.

Bulalo Soup: beef shank with bokchoy
- Broth was sorta bland, I felt it was missing something.. the beef on the medium-firm side and bokchoy was decent

Sinigang Soup: tamarind and tomato based broth with vegetables
- Had some sourness to the soup, how it should be. I chose to include Tadyang (pork spareribs) and Liempo (pork belly), both were the stars of the dish!

Chicken Adobo: boneless chicken fillet in sauce

- Terrific flavor, different from what I'm used to yet it was a positive change from my family's home cooking. 

Beefsteak Tagalog: beef slices with gravy and sauteed onions

- Thicker gravy than the typical more watered down sauce, onions were as expected and it had a hint of salty/fishy flavor to it. Not bad, for me it was a new version of this dish 

Melon Juice: fresh cantaloupe strings and juice

- I love chewing on the fruit and sipping on the juice at the same time! 

Calamansi Juice: Filipino lemonade

- Its got tart from a lemon and sweetness from an orange/tangerine. they don't make it from scratch, its concentrated but still citrusly refreshing!

How can you go wrong with deep fried food?
Rhetorical question.  Please don't answer that.

There was an episode of the Simpson's where Moe decides to convert his bar to a restaurant and purchases a military grade deep fryer.
In one scene, they show a complete meal (entree, salad, wine glass, flower in mini-vase all sitting on a tray) being lowered into this scalding hot vat of oil and coming out all crispy golden. 
That's what I had!

And it was all good: fried chicken, fried pork, fried ribs, fried rice, fried fork, fried drinking glass, all served with a side of lechon sauce and/or banana ketchup.

After my meal here, I had to eat salad for a week, but it was worth it.

And once I've fully drained all this oil out of my system, I'm going back for more -- I'm talking at least a couple months.

It's a small, cozy sit down restaurant. Although, the layout of the restaurant is kind of strange. It's separated into three dining areas - which just makes the place seem smaller than it is. 

Salo-Salo has pretty decent Filipino food - almost up to the level of what you would find in your mother's kitchen. They even offer foods that you can't get at most other turo turo Filipino restaurants, CRISPY PATA !!! They also serve breakfast all day, which is always a plus. Although, i says you get coffee or tea with the breakfast - and I have yet to receive any the few times I've ordered breakfast. The prices are good, especially compared to the amount of food received. Except maybe for their specialty drinks. $2.95 for a very small glass of calamansi juice? C'mon, at least give one refill, especially considering the size of the glass. 

If my review was based on the food alone, I probably would've rated the place higher. But, the service there needs to be worked on. Some nights are better than others, but for the most part - service is very slow. It takes them about the same amount of time to get you your bill, as it takes you to actually eat your meal.

2478198,2011-07-27,6,2sdU3Fq3Wv2XQycJoJQArg,"Salo Salo is a great Filipino place to eat dinner with friends and family while in Vegas. They have plenty of seating, the restaurant is clean and they have good service and food. They also have good hours. Weeknights they close at 9:30pm and Fridays and weekends at 10:00pm. 

On a recent visit here, I came with a party of four and we ordered: 
kare kare (meat and veggies in peanut butter broth), sinigang soup 
(a sour soup with tamarind and meat), bangus (fried boneless milk fish), crispy pata (fried pork) and turon delight (banana egg rolls with Filipino ice cream). 

At the beginning of the meal, they give free garlic peanuts. This is always good and a nice start to the meal. (There are garlic peanuts for sale if you like the sample that they give). 

The kare kare was one of the first dishes served and I liked the presentation of the kare kare because they put this in a traditional Filipino palayok or clay pot. It comes out nice and hot and the peanut butter broth is perfect for topping off the rice. There was plenty of veggies in this in terms of eggplant and greens. The veggies and the broth is always my favorite for kare kare. I did notice their didn't seem to be a lot of meat in this though. (The veggies for me are the best part anyways). 

The sinigang soup was nice and sour and had a fair share of veggies and tomato. I liked sipping on the warm soup and it was also nice to top this on the rice along with the meat that was inside the soup. The meat they put in this though could have been a little bit leaner. 

The bangus fish they served was huge! I think our party only got through a quarter of the fish! 

The crispy pata was good. It was fried just right and was not to hard. It's good to match this with kare kare or sinigang. I also liked dipping the crispy pata in the vinegar dipping sauce that they provide. 

The turon delight was our dessert. Their turon delight is mini banana egg rolls (maybe about 8?) and then in the middle is some ice cream. The ice cream is a Filipino ice cream flavor - the night when we had it I believe it was jack fruit. This is one nice, sweet Filipino treat. 

I love all the traditional Filipino meals at Salo Salo and I also love how the whole restaurant has a traditional Filipino feel to it. They have decor that is very Filipino - Filipino paintings, wooden seats and tables.

For an appetizer we got fishballs which our other dining companion, Alyson, and I let Damon eat by himself.  I wasn't feeling that brave.  For entrees, we got garlic rice, combo fried rice, pork and chicken skewers and Alyson got tortang hipon which can best be described as a shrimp omelet. 

I really enjoyed the sauce on the chicken skewer.  It was sweet but not overpowering.  The garlic rice was OK, but the combo rice was awesome.  Alyson's tortang hipon must have been good because it was all gone.

I'm not even a Vegas resident, but every time I'm in town I make sure to stop by because it's better than everything else in the area, including the Strip. No lie.  I've tried three or four other places where I'm from (SF Bay) and none stack up to this gem.

What's also great about it is how well they're able to make these dishes feel home made.  If I was Filipino, THIS is what I think my mom's food would taste like.  It's definitely family owned and the passion the owners have for making clean, authentic, comforting food comes through in every dish.

In the numerous times I've been there, I've had the pleasure of trying a most of their menu from breakfast through dinner and desserts.  Here are my three favorites:

Breakfast Platter - I could eat longanisa, tapa, and tocino all day and they have the best.  Add in eggs and rice and I'm left speechless.  You might never have American breakfast again.

Crispy Pata.......I can't even begin to tell you how good this is.  If you've never had hocks before, don't let it scare you off, it's amazingly tender and juicy, and surrounded by an addictively crisp exterior. Dip it in the vinegar they provide and it's lights out, game over.

Miki Bihon - I really admire them for executing this dish so well.  Not only does this rely on good technique in the kitchen, it alo requires a ridiculously well honed palate in order to get the balance of all the flavors correct.  Most of the places I go in the Bay douse the noodles in soy sauce and call it a day.  I'm honestly not sure what the other sauces are that go into this dish but they're all balanced so well, and taste amazing with all the toppings, ESPECIALLY the sweet Chinese sausage...mmmmm.

I had to recover from this stomach blow and in my confusion I selected a coconut juice drink.  It was fine, but minimal in size and not really the appropriate compliment to what food was going to be forthcoming.  

As for the food, we HAD to order the Chicken Adobo.  Not ordering that is like going to New Orleans and not having a biegnet or Hurricane drink.  We also ordered Palabok, which are noodles topped in a fish gravy and then covered with pork rinds.  Finally, we got some Vegetable Limpia which is a type of spring roll.   The presentation of all the dishes was pleasant but once I dug in, I noticed a common theme..........Salt!!!!!!  Salt is a critical component to all cooking but when I taste it in abundance I feel its the hallmark of a lazy kitchen.  Rather than expertly prepare their array of spices, many kitchens will just add salt to give a dish some flavor.  I kind of felt that was the case here and thats tragic because the chicken was tender and juicy and the noodles were expertly cooked.  The limpia had fresh vegetables but all the sauces that accompanied the dishes was just way to salty.  See why the beer would have come in handy now?

Prices were all very reasonable and the portions were generous.  I feel that Salo-Salo has in it the makings of a fine restaurant, they just need to want to take it to another level.  Then again, the Filipino's I know seem to love it, so why should they change?  Perhaps its this discontinuity why Filipino food has yet to take off and really make it mainstream.  Until that happens, Salo Salo is a fine enough place for this type of ethnic food, but dont expect to see Anthony Bourdain in here anytime soon.

After many delays to try the Artesia location and having to move back to the Bay Area, I ended up here with my family. It's not that far off the strip, and yes its in the middle of Chinatown/Spring Mountain Road. 

Wasn't busy at all considering we showed up at 2:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. Prices were pretty reasonable too. Between my family, we shared miki bihon, sisig, fried calamari, crispy pata, kare kare, and steamed rice. The miki bihon was a little dry, but it had some flavor to it at least. The fried calamari was a little too crispy. Not the best I've had, but pretty decent. Their sisig was clutch though. It came out on the sizzling plate with two slices of lime on the side, and it was cooked perfectly. The crispy pata was amazing as well, yet at most other Filipino restaurants I've been to they never mess that one up. 

If you're not up for a la carte, they have rice plates that range from $6-$8, and they all have silog platters as well if you're craving breakfast food. Our bill came out to a little over $51, and that's actually decent since some places tend to overcharge.

She has been here for alot of times now and this is first time coming in here. We already ordered when i found the news hee in yelp. :( it my fault i guess that i didnt check yelp before, I usually believe her when it comes to food. But this recent nrws really knock my appetite to the food. Yet Iam here to tell you that I didnt rate them because of the recent news (roach infestation.) Rather iam writing this rating with the same criteria I have been giving other food places.

We ordered:
Chopsuey
Pancit bihon 
And family set( includes ; bbq pork and chicken, squid, and arellanong bangus.
Rice

Lets start with the chop suey. The vegetables were fresh and the flavor is there when it comes to the chop suey taste that filipino style shouls be but the chicken that came with the chop suey was dried up. So dry that we didnt touch it.
Next the pancit, it was probably the one thing that i ate alot of on the bunch, it taste good, and has all the flavor i want frpm a pancit.
Lastly the big family plate which contains different food, the beef bbq is probably the only thing that was near the taste that is near the standard of pinoy beef bbq. The chicken bbq was we only took 1 bite out of it, 4 sticks remained on the platter. The arellanong bangus was okay, but it tasted not fresh, as well as the squid, which i may add has only the bbq sauce on top of it, and smoked. I would have done better prepartion on it, no to mention , it tasted days old or refrigerated.

Regardless of the ROACH infestation which we saw momenta before we eat, i find this place pricey with foods that are not as highly as other yelpers say.
Maybe my standards of pinoy foods are high, but when a chicken bbq is so messed up that the bbq chicken that I make home made is way better than what you sell, then theres a problem. 

Lastly I would not reccomend anyone to eat here. I dont know if its true but they should have the GRADE C on their door, I may be wrong but its either they have never put it out, or they have been inspected again since January i cant find an update about the roach infestation.

This will be the last time i will eat here, i took a chance to see if the flavor and taste are what the other yelpers said are true, even in the midst of knowing what might be back on that kitchen. Yelpers take this advice, and stay away, not unless you want be another brave sould to try out their kitchens delicacies.",RROLYsQezNa4ddSapS8uEQ,7,0,1,n_VuvSxFFZcvg7EAjRgSlw

We ordered a platter to share, for $38 you can pick 7 different meats and 2 sides from a list. We also ordered bagoong fried rice, adobo fried rice and halo halo.  

For the platter we ordered crispy pata, lechon kawali, pork BBQ, lechon rib, pork tocino, grilled pork (double order), grilled talong and adobong kangkong. 

The hits: 
The tocino is ridiculous!! I am in love with that. Lechon kawali, soft meat with crunchy skin...just eat around the fat. The bagoong fried rice is tasty, try this for a new take on fried rice. Crispy pata, always a must in any Filipino restaurant. 

The misses:
Some dishes are ok, not spectacular...but Im happy to report, no misses =)

This location is great and we left there with full tummies and a great big smile on our faces.

the vegas one is pretty nice.  makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.  service was actually ok.  usually filipino restaurants don't have the best service, but this place was ok.  my phone was dying so i had to bust out my tagalog and ask where i can plug my phone in.  they were nice about it and let me charge my phone near the kitchen behind one of the rice cookers.  

it was about lunch time but i was cravin some filipino breakfast so i ordered the combo breakfast - longanisa, beef tapa, and pork tocino with some garlic fried rice.  excuse me while i wipe off my drool...

longanisa is this sausage thing... i hate eating it 'coz its super fatty and it makes you burp the longanisa taste all day long... even if u eat it for breakfast, you'll be burping it for dinner... but it's just so damn good!  the tapa and tocino are yummy too.  the garlic fried rice was ok.

the best part is the dessert. :)  there's no way i can eat at salo salo and not have halo halo [(from Tagalog halo, ""mix"") is a popular Filipino dessert that is a mixture of shaved ice and milk to which are added various boiled sweet beans and fruits, and served cold in a tall glass or bowl.]

The portions here are generous and the environment...well, a lot better than most Filipino restaurants outside of a resort in the Philippines.  It's clean here, and a nice sit down and dine restaurant.

We ordered the following:
Chicken Adobo, $7.95, -OK
Miki-Bihon, $7.95, -Good
Ala Carte Lechon Kawali, $8.95, -Excellent

Salo-Salo Grill is a little pricier when you compare it with the Filipino buffets in Vegas, but the food and look of the restaurant make up for it.  Plus, they have a little hut outside, in the parking area, where you can smoke.  How Filipino is that?

Customer service was OK despite the other reviews I read about it being not to good.  I didn't like the fact that the waitress stood next to our table though when she dropped off the check.  She stayed there till we put out the payment, a 'hunny'.  It was annoying!

It was drenched in shrimp juice which quickly spoiled a few hours later when we tried to reheat it. Crispy Pata was slightly overcooked but still managed to finish it.

Salo-Salo was actually recommended by Roger T for us to go for our next Halo-Halo Challenge.  I admit, I pulled up Yelp, got on Salo-Salo's website, and did my homework on their Pinoy ""Mix-Mix"" dessert.  Based on their website, pinipig was in their Halo-Halo. Interesting...I gots to investigate.

We arrived on Father's Day and this place was packed and there was a line.  Since we weren't having any food except Halo-Halo, they seated us right away.  Within 5 minutes, our Halo-Halo's arrived.  Each Halo-Halo cost $4.95 and what a beautiful sight.  First of all, real silverware. Always a bonus for me since it makes mixing this iced treat that much easier with real utensils.  Salo-Salo's Halo-Halo had what I've been looking for all along...real, legit ube.  Ube ice cream, green jelly, red jelly, some coconut, white beans, and flan were also at attendance.  But what was missing was the red beans, pinipig, and lanka. I was still stoked that I got legit ube. Taste wise...pretty damn good. Would be perfect if red beans made it to the party. 

PS:  We didn't have anything else, just their Halo-Halo. Service was fantastic, especially since they were so busy.

Salo Salo grill was the only choice I had. Anyways, I walked in, expecting it to be busy but it wasn't. Not too many people. Only three tables were occupied. I did take out and ordered beef kaldereta, buko pandan, honey BBQ and garlic rice. If you order a main course, it doesn't come with rice so you have to pay for rice too. The pictures that you see of buko pandan is no where near close to how much they gave me. It was in a much SMALLER container. The pictures of the menu and prices on here; are not up to date. The prices has gone up. Let's get to the food. Shall we? The beef kaldereta wasn't what I was expecting. It had a different taste to it. I don't know, I can't explain it. I can't really compare real filipino authentic food VS the Americanized philipino food because I was raised in the US my whole life. But I was born in the phillipines. Although my parents and my whole family always cook filipino food. Moving on to the garlic rice; it was a lot. I had better. It didn't have much of a strong flavor for me. I felt like it was a hint of garlic. You can barely even taste it. And as for the honey BBQ goes... It was eh. Will I ever come back? Not sure.

Ever wanted to get adventurous and try other ethic foods, such as Filipino food. Well Salo Salo Grill is a great place to try these kinds of food. Not only will you enjoy a modern native ambiance of the restaurant you will be amazed on how delicious the food is. I would suggest ordering the 3 piece entree.

The day i went we ordered that. For the meats we chose the fried chicken, beefsteak, and bbq pork. All delicious and grilled and fried to perfection.

For the soup we decided to have the sinigang baboy a very common filipino dish, a bit sour but really good.

We also had a side of lumpiang shanghai, i admit it was not the greatest, but all the other good foods made up for it.

For dessert we had the Leche Flan, not the greatest as well you can tell it's been sitting in the fridge.

Overall i give this place a 4 because their food is great overall and the service is great. They always followed up to see if you needed anything and they were on top of the waters like no tomorrow.",r2R9t9_0Je8wP-wh4-xM3w,5,3,4,kZfrnVLbg8t8ftvnECj7lw

Came here on a visit from Upstate Nevada (Reno). Knowing there is a large filipino population in Vegas I wanted to try out some home cooking. Came here based on the Yelp reviews and I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.

Sisig was on the maasim side (sour) and the Kare Kare was not too good unfortunately (it had a strong garlic taste to it) :/ The Krispy Pata and the Lumpiang Shanghai was okay.

I will say this however! They have a Jeepney and a Bahay Kubo outside which is dope as hell to take pictures with! The inside was quite nice and spacious, the staff was very friendly, and the service was extremely fast (though we were the only ones at the time. It was a Monday Evening)

They have the same servers from years ago and a few new ones who treat you like they're your Ate (older sister).  They are attentive but they'd leave you alone so you have quality time with your food.

We always get the crispy platter (fried calamari, lechon kawali, fried chicken, crispy pata, fried ribs) and garlic rice.  My personal favorite is their All-Day Breakfast beef tapa.  It comes with your choice of 2 eggs and garlic rice.  Tapa is usually dry and chewy - almost like jerky but they do it differently here.  It's more tender and juicy with a taste of vinegar so you don't have to dip it vinegar - it pairs well with siningag (garlic rice). I don't normally eat rice but I'm a fan of garlic rice.  I wash it all down with either melon juice or calamansi juice.  I end my meal with one of my favorite Filipino desserts - leche flan!  This is different from Mexican flan - the Filipino version is richer and creamier because we use more egg yolks and milk.  A slice of leche flan is swimming in syrup.  I just love this stuff!

This is the type of place where you have to get somebody's attention in order to get seated, place an order, get your bill...that's just how it is.  It's not that they're deliberately trying to ignore you, they just want to leave you alone.  The place is decorated in native Filipino decor.

For what...you wonder?

Busting up in there for lunch two days in a row!  

Believe me, I thought the waitresses were going to give me a look of disappointment and surprise when we walked in.  I mean, who goes to the same restaurant two days in a row?

Apparently, Olia H. and I do.   In Vegas.   Who can turn down awesome Filipino food?

You see, I fell in love with this place last August.   Since then, I vowed that I would try the 'all-day breakfast' that the menu offered.  If you know me, you're aware of my obsession of eggs, rice and longaniza/tocino.  That honestly would be my last meal.  *drool*

For $8, Salo-Salo serves up a heaping pile of garlic fried rice, eggs and yummy grilled meat (either longaniza, tocino or inihaw baboy).  I also decided to order some lumpia because...why not?  It was the best way to start Day #2 in Vegas.  

So good, in fact, that Olia H. and I came to the quick agreement Sunday morning that we'd go back there.  This time, Olia H.ordered the lechon (crispy skin goodness) and was first introduced to the delicious 'all-purpose' lechon sauce.  Yes, you can put that sauce on anything and it will make it automatically taste better.  

Added bonus: Realizing how homey Salo-Salo is.  Various families were in the restaurant, reading the Sunday paper, not saying a word to each other.  Sounds pretty much like the Sundays of my childhood.  Hehe.",m3qH3d97shbvSCtmUrpDFA,8,6,5,nL7KNOK99_JNpSnbghqp5Q

This time we were a little more conservative with our amount of food.  We went with:

Beef Mami - noodle soup with beef shank.  The beef shank was tender with the right amount of bite.  Delicious with the vinegar sauce.  The dish itself was rather bland and unremarkable.
Garlic Rice - a delicoius staple, can't go wrong with this.
Grilled Mussels - This was hubby's request.  I had one and stayed away.  The mussels didn't taste particularly fresh and, to me, very fishy.  Hubby who is a great fan of mussels did not compliment it either.
Kare Kare - I love this dish because 1.) it comes with bagoong which has to be one of my favorite condiemnts in the world.  and 2.) they actually give you a good amount of oxtail.  The tripe is plentiful as well but not as enticing to eat because they use huge pieces instead of cutting them down
Grilled Eggplant - This was a cheap side dish which I think was totally worth the $3 we paid.  I don't know if they really smoked it or just used liquid smoke but it the heady smokey flavor was delicious, especially when paired with the accompanying bagoong.  Did I mention the bagoong is house made and a pleasant pink color?  It's also not over salty like the commercial variety.
Halo halo - can't mess this up.  Ok I guess you can but we haven't had a messed up halo halo yet.  This was delicious as always.  Wish they give you more ube ice cream though.

If we weren't desperate for Filipino food (not much to be had in Orange County), we probably wouldn't come here when we're in Vegas.

I choose this one because it was right up the road.  Unfortunately for me they didn't have what I wanted on their menu.  I guess its not a main stream dish and most younger generation Americanized Filipinos don't eat it anymore. 

Anyway, I settled for some Lichon.  It was good, and the garlic rice that came with if was just like mom used to make.  There was a fair amount of oil going on, but it's Lichon.
