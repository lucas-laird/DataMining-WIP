We did not expect much from a Vegas Elvis Wedding but what we got at this wedding chapel was just outrageous. We had to wait around for an hour because the receptionist had screwed up the times and while we were waiting we were not offered any waters or even apologies for just hanging around. The photographer finally arrived but basically he was just there to shoot extra photos to make us pay more in the end.

First, the place was extremely filthy and not air conditioned (except for the chapel we were to use).  Second, we opted to rent a tuxedo (for $100) from this chapel (as they advertised) and specially requested a gray tuxedo, which they assured us they could accommodate.  All they asked is that I forward my husband's measurements, which I did.  What we got when we arrived was a tuxedo that was unclean, the shirt had ring-around-the collar, the pants and blazer hadn't seen a dry cleaner in a very long time (if at all), and the hem in the pants was barely held together with a multitude of safety pins.  They only had one cummerbund and it was way too big (more safety pins).  The limo was old, dirty and rusted.  I asked for water and was told they had no cups.

When we originally planned our wedding, we had asked if my friend could officiate the wedding. Our original coordinator, Kenny, had said that he had never had anyone ask that and would get back to us on that. His main concern was that we had already paid of the officiant in the package and we wouldn't be able to get that money back. I told him that wasn't a big deal and that we'd rather get married by someone we know than a total stranger. As we grew closer, no one got back to us on the status of our request. I finally called and was told that it would be an ADDITIONAL charge to supply our own officiant. I imagine this ""additional charge"" was the exact amount that the officiant expected to be tipped by us for leading the wedding. 

On the day of the wedding, we were picked up by a limo that had a funny smell on the inside. When we arrived at the chapel, it was nothing fancy. The building seems very run down and dated. There were curtains thrown on the doors to make the picture room more ""private."" It was an older building. We were told that our officiant had 15 minutes and the employees were shocked that our friend didn't know how to conduct a ""unity ceremony."" We were told that it was included in our ceremony and that he was expected to know how to do it. I didn't think lighting two candles, lighting a larger candle and then blowing out the singular candles was that big of a deal. 

After we said our ""i do's"" and were done with our ceremony, we were asked to wait in another room while our pictures were edited. When we took our pictures, they took them before, during and after the ceremony. When we viewed our pictures we were told that only the photos taken during the ceremony were included in our package and that the additional photos would be an additional $500 or $240 for only the slide show. We selected our prints, but were not told how we would be receiving those prints.

The lady running the place then came up to us and told us that we had a remaining balance for bringing our own officiant and for the ""complimentary limo service."" We paid the balance. When I went back to the manager, or whatever, I explained that she might want to change the wording on a ""complimentary limo"" if in fact their is a charge associated with the service. She then went on to explain to me that our coordinator should have collected this original charge when we called in. She didn't address the fact that her ""complimentary limo service"" is actually a ""paid limo service.""

I don't plan on getting married again, but I also wouldn't suggest it to anyone i know.

TL;DR - Old, run down chapel that isn't very upfront on costs.",TtsSSjzbrd-71wtg3_6tog,6,0,2,7ZwHlbUALnYxb5UQabjqYw

She bought the package, went up a week ahead to pay and confirm the exact details of the ceremony. Day of wedding here's how it went down: Limo didn't show (they don't have a working limo, it's a lie) which made us late for ceremony, arrived only to find out they knew nothing about the confirmation from the week before & had to do it over with guests waiting in un air-conditioned ""lobby"" with no seating. They didn't have her flowers and the flowers they ""found"" were wilted and browning. The receptionist was rude and acted like she had never talked to my daughter the week before. Tried to use bathroom (see photos) & opted to ""hold it"" for 3 hours instead. Led her to the bridal suite (closet with NO air-conditioning) where the photographer took terrible pics at crazy-odd angles. Ceremony led by some weird old man with a fake accent who kept making sketchy sexual innuendos throughout, & lit the dirty melted down unity candles with a Bic lighter. After ceremony were made to wait 2 full hours for the photo review, while party waited outside in the heat (no seating or room in lobby that was full of people for the next ceremony). Pictures were embarrassing, terrible poses and the sun coming through window cast shadows on all photos. The two good pics were only available at an extra charge. I spoke with Leah the ""manager"" who had a horrible attitude, and I expressed our epic disappointment in the ruined most important day of my daughter's life. She couldn't care less, made no reparations or even an apology. My child left in tears, her wedding was a complete farce and her party was very frustrated over having to endure practical heat stroke (no water on premises) for 2 hours waiting outside.

1600776,2014-11-23,0,xv-A7RZuC5Qlxu9CEzuyig,"If you want to do a wedding in the middle of the night, this is pretty much your only remaining option in Vegas. Since the license bureau stopped issuing the paperwork 24 hours a day, the chapels all stopped offering 24 hour weddings.

We were getting married in Cabo San Lucas and celebrating our bachelor/ette weekend in Vegas the week before, so we wanted to do an Elvis wedding in Vegas for our legal wedding over the weekend. We wanted to do it after we had been out celebrating, so we needed a 24 hour chapel.

We found A Wedding Chapel and they said they would open at 2:30am for us for an extra fee.

We opted not to have the limo service provided by them as we already had our own limos booked for the night. From the reviews on here, sounds like we made the right choice.

We arrived at the chapel and everything went smoothly and it was a fantastic wedding, everyone had a great time. Don't expect a stunning, elegant chapel. It's a small chapel in Vegas and you should expect the ""we got drunk and got married in Vegas"" style. Since that's exactly what we were looking for as we were going to have the beautiful wedding the following weekend, it was perfect for us.

Our Elvis was AMAZING! Looked and sounded great and was hilarious! Everyone loved him.

Once the ceremony is over, they will take some photos of you with Elvis, but be warned, these are not included in the photos you get with the package and are $30 EACH to buy additional.

Once we were done, we were informed that we needed to tip the photographer, videographer, and Elvis on top of all of the money we had already paid.

Then started the 6 month battle to get our photos and videos. When we got back to the US we emailed them and they responded that we had to pay another $50 to get our photos uploaded to Dropbox and our video shipped to us (again, this wasn't included??). We paid immediately and then heard nothing from them.

We emailed and emailed and finally they uploaded the photos to another site for us to pick the ones we wanted and to see if we wanted to order any additional ones. We picked our photos immediately and then heard nothing again. After more emailing with no response, they finally uploaded 9 photos to Dropbox. We emailed to get the rest and a few weeks later we finally got them. Still no video.

Emailed and emailed to get the video shipped and we finally got it in the mail this week. We got married at the beginning of June.

If you want to get married after hours and you have patience and persistence to get your photos and videos, then go here. Otherwise save yourselves the hassle and go somewhere else.",VeZJy1I4Byyt_zy1XdtQ_Q,6,0,2,7sXz0ct6Zw4DRLrIp3Uldg

2421868,2014-06-18,0,xv-A7RZuC5Qlxu9CEzuyig,"DO NOT GET MARRIED HERE!!!!!!!! For waaaay too much info proceed... 

My sister chose this chapel (if you can call it that) after viewing their pictures from their website. INCREDIBLY misleading. Let's start at the beginning... The ""limo"" was an hour and a half late picking them up from the Flamingo Hotel. They told us they couldn't pick up from the front door cause limos can't fit so we had to be picked up by the pool entrance. Fine whatever, BUT I saw limos in the front roundabout all week, so that's a red flag. Once the ""limo"" gets there it's clear that it was purchased off Craigslist for around $2,000, maybe. A 90s Excursion ""limo"" with a giant dent in the side and, get this...NO AC!! Huge red flag # 2!!! It was 105° that day and at least 125° inside the car. The driver was nice and made it clear it wasn't his fault he was late. The coordinator sent him to the wrong place a few times, so that's red flag 3. While at the courthouse picking up their marriage license the lady working there told them that the ""chapel"" lost their license for awhile so we figured that doesn't bode well for what we were about to experience. We had no idea. So we FINALLY get to the place and I can tell you it doesn't look a bit like the picture presented on yelp. It looked like it was a swift breeze from falling over. When we walked in there was a bride sitting at the front desk yelling at the ""manager"". RED FLAG number 4. ""Manager"" is in quotes because I'm unclear where'd he was running a wedding chapel or a gym. Dressed in a tee shirt and basketball shorts is not exactly the most professional way to present yourself and your business. They send us back to a room immediately so as to save us from hearing what I assume are very warranted gripes from afore mentioned bride. And wouldn't you guess...no ac. At this point red flags are flying out at me so fast it feels like I'm in some sort of nightmare. The room was filthy, had green shag looking carpet meant to look like grass, this was the ""garden"" room after all. There was junk all over the room. Cords everywhere, tube lighting busted and laying on the floor and broken stereos and tables stashed in corners. The minister although nice had a language barrier which is fine but in 4 times saying my sisters name did not once pronounce it correctly and this is a VERY common name. She also pronounced them something that sounded very similar to Mr. and Mrs. Psychopath.... Uh WHAT?! Their last name is no where remotely close to that. The photographer was actually the only bright spot in this whole mess. He was sweet and was obviously aware that this place is a shitshow. If he is smart he will cut ties with them, he is a private contractor. Once we picked out the pictures to have printed we left. Amazingly the limo driver tried to fix the ac while they were getting married but it was too far gone and didn't help but it was sweet of him to try. Now it's been 3 weeks and she still hasn't received her pictures from them. Something tells me she never will. 

If I could give this place negative stars I would. They have no right calling themselves a chapel and should be embarrassed.  I know the business of weddings is commonplace in Vegas but that doesn't give you the right to treat it like it's nothing to you. I've been in catering for a dozen years and I've NEVER seen anything so poorly run and executed. Someone's wedding day is still their wedding day whether they do a lavish 100,000 dollar event or spend their savings for 6 months and take a trip to Las Vegas and do it that way. You should do everything in your power to make that day special and not treat it like a checkout line at the grocery store.  Luckily my sister and her husband took it well and are just considering it a funny story to tell people but I wanted future brides and grooms to know. And I'm hoping this review will save someone from a terrible experience on one of the most special days of their life. I don't know what I expected out of a Vegas Wedding....at very least toilet paper in the bathroom would've been nice.",ULiGNiFnpyp0Xkty_Khm3w,8,0,1,n6hyN5ni-30a8STOW0XPsQ

3000460,2012-10-09,0,xv-A7RZuC5Qlxu9CEzuyig,"I have to say, if you are using this chapel, and probably any other, ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS! I researched the crap out of Vegas Elvis vow renewals, looking for the best deal and the most for the money. There were enough hidden costs, that you don't see in the original fees online. They have a great live chat option, which came in handy since I was planning it as a surprise to my husband. 
Negatives-
1. Make sure you ask about the distance allowed for the limo. It is not listed on the website, and they will charge you on top of the $40 required tip for the driver.
2. We weren't told about having to tip a videographer, which, in the end, was the same as the photographer we needed to tip....hmmmm, which tried to guilt us into buying more pictures that weren't part of the ceremony, or allowed as part of the package that we were paying for. I would have told him not to bother taking pictures before had I known they weren't going to allow us to pick the pictures without more cost!
3. The limo showed up 25 minutes before the ceremony, although we were told we needed to be ready an hour before for them to pick us up, then continued to drive like a blind bat out of hell, even though we had 3 small children in the back!
4. Who knows how long the guests were waiting, since they request them to be there at least 15 minutes before the ceremony,we were picked up and arrived late and we still had to finish up the payment, along with the photographer taking me away for pictures. 
5. There is no ""ah-hah"" moment for the bride. I stood at the back of the chapel looking like a dumb-@$$, without the photographer,lights, or Elvis. They were totally unprepared.And the chapel was super stuffy inside.
6. A rep called the night before, asking why I had cancelled the limo service, which I had not, then called back and asked me to change the time of the vows.
7. You are given only ceremony pictures to pick from for your digital prints and prints. If you chose any of the other ""artistic"" photos, they will cost you $25 for the first, $100 for 5, and I stopped looking after that.
8. Tips added up to an extra $130, and that was only because I was cheap!

The pros-
1. Their packages start at $199, which is about $100 lower than any others I found.
2. Like I said, the limo is ""complementary"", although depending on the size, you are required to tip at least $40 or up.
3. Elvis reallllllly seemed to like his job, and I forgot all about the rest of the crap I was getting irritated about.
4. You can request specific songs, although I didn't....I figured he knows what works best!
5. If you are kick-back, you'll have no problem, and I just told you all the things that could go wrong! Good Luck!!",aiDsggciSnVpiAFTWhxhCg,6,0,3,bmccdVCBQdUicFt1yigtSw

First let me say it looks like staff has changed since all the bad reviews. Lesley was incredibly sweet and helpful. We planned all of it from WA and she was so nice in guiding us through the experience.

We did not use limo service, and honestly with lyft existing save $50 and don't bother. The lyft drivers in Vegas are sweethearts.

If we had thought to email Lesley beforehand our Elvis could have had the music for the songs we wanted but we hadn't so we looked through what he had and it was great.

The outside is a little plain, the bridal room is too. But don't be fooled. They have an amazing photographer on staff. You're going to look amazing in the photos she takes. And if you have an idea for a pose, she'll happily work with you to make it happen.

Posed photos are spendy but they are cheaper than they would be anywhere else. Also if you pay $35 they upload your posed photos to a website then you get a cd with all your ceremony photos and that $35 goes toward any photos you purchase. This is what we did cause we needed a little time to save money to buy the posed photos. They will give you digital photos, not prints. You get your own prints wherever you want.

If you have questions or requests, ask! I am from a cool state and it was a cool day for Vegas when we were there, but I was still overheated. I asked if she could turn on ac, Lesley took care of me. Ask questions and be reasonable.

In our overall experience with the Chapel, we found it to be disorganized, understaffed, poorly managed/trained, dirty, and misleading.
 
We purchased the ""Beautiful Ceremony"" which is shown as including the following: 
* 25 Professional Digital Ceremony Photos (Including Copyrights)
* 8 4x6 Prints
* Full Photo Shoot with 50 poses before and after Ceremony
* High Quality DVD of the Ceremony
* 6 Fresh Rose Bouquet and Matching Boutonniere
* Unity Candle Ceremony (Add Keepsake Candle $45)
* Live Web Cam
* First Dance to the Music of Your Choice
* Wedding Coordinator (no additional fees)
* $60 Minister Fee Not Included
The website and pricing book were misleading. 
You'll notice that it is put in parentheses where additional charges will apply except that the pictures that you take before and after the wedding are not marked as additional charges. 

The coordinator that we talked to was alone & did not have clear knowledge of what they offered. Sign said ""military discount""  and we asked what would be available to us with this discount (as we are both veterans). She first denied that there was a military discount offered, and we had to walk her outside to show her where it clearly said it.
We noticed that 2 of the 3 rooms had broken glass in the stained glass window/focal point, rooms had lightbulbs out we assume it just occurred, and that surely they would be addressed by 2 days later when we were to have our ceremony. When we arrived the bulbs were still out. We brought this up and were told that the maintenance man usually fixes them, but he was not there on that particular day. The photographer attempted to convince us that it didn't matter because he would just crop that out.  The cords for the webcam were unsightly in the room and should've been hidden. They can be seen in many of the photos of our ceremony. 
When it was time for the ceremony; the room had trash on the floor/seats. We had to bring this up with our coordinator who proceeded to clean it up after having it brought to her attention. This cleaning was done while on live webcast with all of our family and friends watching. Additionally, the mirrors in the bridal suite were dirty and this can clearly be seen ""before"" photos. 
The photographer left us many times in order to show another couple the rooms and answer their questions, as well as starting the photo viewing for a different couple. During my wife's ""before"" shoot, the photographer kept coming in and out of her room, because he was busy with the couple that walked in. 
This was very impersonal and unprofessional; the package included a wedding coordinator & a photographer so we should have been getting their undivided attention. We had to go searching for the coordinator multiple times, so she could help my wife with her veil that wouldn't stay on. Also because the coordinator wasn't around, we could not provide her with the song that we wanted for our first dance. During the ceremony, we ended up having to dance to the default song as our first dance, which was very disappointing.
When we finished the ""After"" shoot the Photographer handed me an envelope telling me ""Don't forget my tip"" in front of my wife with an envelope that says $60.00+ and then proceeded to remind me several times. He sat nearby waiting for his envelope as we gathered our things. If you want to ask for a tip the appropriate time would have been AFTER we saw the pictures not after the photo shoot and certainty not in front of my new wife.
When we arrived later that night (9:30 pm) to view the photos and were shown 40ish pictures. Many of the photos were duplicated; one zoomed in and one further back or one color and one black and white. Some chopped off arms/head or one of us almost completely, others had our eyes closed or we weren't smiling. This made is easy to eliminate a lot of pictures quickly. The slideshow in which we were shown the photos was offered to us for a price of $250, and it did not even have my wife's name spelled correctly. 
Our ""military discount"" guaranteed us one upgrade from the next package up. We opted to increase our digital photos, so, instead of 25, we were to pick 35. Once we were told that we could only choose from the ceremony photos, it was too late to opt for any of the other upgrades. The person who was there also told us, ""you can take the 25 from the ceremony...or you can just take all 44. It doesn't matter."" If we would've known all of the limitations we would have done something else.
Multiple photo opportunities were missed, like us walking down the aisle after the wedding. Upon going through the pictures we realized that not only did the photographer not guide us in his picture taking (reminders to smile, where to look, where our hands should be for example almost all of my wife's outside pictures has her holding the dress off the ground, or worse didn't even tell us that our signs were backwards. We had custom running signs saying ""Just"" & ""Married""",PqUSCDVUYhlCi6oQmLeA9w,0,0,1,Gy_L6Z7XWFxSDHLlHQgR7g
4956658,2012-05-14,0,xv-A7RZuC5Qlxu9CEzuyig,"We got married here May 9th 2012. We pre-arranged and pre-paid from home before we left and were sent clear instructions from Leah. Anyone complaining about the tips didn't read their agreement. We brought tip envelopes with Thank You cards and tips inside for everyone and they were happy to get them.
From the moment I walked in the door, they did everything they could to make me feel comfortable and prepared. We explained that we were on a tight budget and all the staff was more than accomodating.
Elvis was phenomenal - he walked me down the aisle and kept my friends engaged and entertained while they waited for the ceremony to start. The ceremony itself was cute and funny and a lot of fun and the room they gave us had a stained glass window that gave a beautiful glow to a lot of the pictures.
We selected a $199 ceremony and my expectations were not terribly high but the staff more than exceeded them and I loved my wedding. 
After the Elvis ceremony, they took us aside to a private room so the ordained minister could actually marry us and he said really beautiful, non-religious (important to us) things and I cried my face off.
I would recommend this place absolutely for a vow renewal or wedding provided you don't have unrealistic expectations.",00hHsUU7_A_QjV8bmnoq-A,7,0,5,135al09NWSJamEFrg_XJcg

LIMO IS NOT INCLUDED AND THEY WILL SNEAK IN THE CHARGE!!! ALSO...We were married over a month ago and still have not seen our pictures and have called over 20 times and we have been just blown off. I am starting a class action lawsuit against this company. If there is anyone else that feels like this company for one reason or another did not deliver what was promised please contact me.

ALOT of their reviews start like this. There are so more and many better options to get married in Las Vegas. This is not one of them. If you want your wedding day to be a complete and total disaster I recommend you chose this place. Anyways, I promised them I would be leaving reviews accordingly. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for their business.  I could sit here and give you a sob story about how oh my god your wedding day is your biggest day as a couple. Etc. We already know what this day means to just about anyone. Let's start from the beggining .  I found this place on Groupon and decided to give them a call before I booked. They ""price matched"" me over the phone. Fine. I know Groupon takes a huge cut. Anyways, it seemed okay Chantal was pretty friendly. I felt good about it. I then found their YouTube channel and had some concerns. Yikes. I then checked reviews. I emailed them screen shots of these bad reviews for assurance because they did have some of the things I was looking for and it was close to our hotel. I was assured my concerns would be handled. I was promised a certain minister we asked for (did not happen and I was devestated), an outdoor webcam ceremony (did not happen nor was it set up), and I paid extra to have our video uploaded immediately after the ceremony. It was not and I was called a liar about being told it was immediate. Let me tell you thank god for recording calls to make sure we could go back on our details of what we chose, emails, screenshots, and covering our bases. I called them out. Every employee had a different story. Luckily as well I had reminded them that we had a 6:30 photo showing to pick our pictures out. They emailed me to book it 3 days prior to our wedding and they didn't even have it on their schedule. We also had to be fit in. We waited almost an hour on our wedding night to view these pictures. I asked for our ceremony to be outside. Natural lighting! I am a professional photographer. When we went to our viewing finally I almost broke down into tears our photographer was very friendly and sweet and was just about the only employee who gave a crap and had a good attitude with us. I felt most of the half butt sorries we got for how this day went down were so unheartfelt. I feel like they just want every penny they can squeeze out of you at a way inflated price and that's it. My barcode had a tear in it on our marriage paper work. We ran for 20 minutes to fix which we were told they didn't even need us both there for a copy and we did not get a first look or anything ruined our big day. We were charged 100 for this for having to be moved up 20 minutes yet, the webcam we were promised outside was not even outside. My family missed most of the wedding. The live stream. My best friends did too. It was a down screen.",7Co3bpAF96UuUhb-1FsOmw,2,0,1,ZakeJfF_9MXqaJBJ7QJoVw

And on our wedding day we didn't get a limo like was in the package and the guy who picked us up was completely rude. He didn't saw 1 word the whole ride and didnt even help me get my dress in the suv. The ceremony itself was okay but i will never recommend anyone to wed here. 

Still waiting for what i paid for!",0UM9KJg27qgK5d9gtYyTzg,8,0,1,lQ2Z9vncvwEFnwYPXKLkEg
