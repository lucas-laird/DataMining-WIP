24237,2013-09-02,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"Let me start by saying this:  Malaysian Food is one of the best food in the entire world...and its not because I'm a native Malaysian   ;)  Our food is unique because it draws from our multi ethnic heritage. 
We had two other Malaysian restaurants before Island Malaysian, which was originally called ""Penang Rest"". All great except this is the only one that sticks around...so guess that speaks a lot in itself? 
I'm kinda ""consistent"" when it comes to this restaurant...I order the same few dishes every time...the waitress knows my order but still hands me a menu ...good 4 her :) 

Well here are my rating by stars
APPETIZERS: 
Roti Canai 5* (small order, get two or three if entrée)
Curry Puffs 4* (potatoes fillings exc flavor, pastry not too bad)
Ice Kacang 5* (my fav, Malaysian style shaved ice ...must try :)

If you like to feel exotic, get the young coconut drink. Its served straight out of the coconut itself. You will love very exotic ;)

ENTREE: 
Char Kuey Teow 5* ( ask for sambal belacan (stinky chili sauce ;) yummmm

Hokkein Char Mee 3-4*  (fat noodles, like udon size fried in black sauce. Its very yummy f the cook gets to heat his wok extra hot. Same for char kuey teow abv)

Mee Goreng 4* (this is Indian Fried Noodles...back home is fried with some ketchup)

Kari Ayam 5* (= malaysian chicken curry. This is the same curry served with Roti Canai) 

Anything with Belacan is good if you like the flavor of belacan. But I think just like Durian, belacan is an acquired taste. Its basically chili paste mix with dried shrimp paste. The Thai also use it in their dish. In Malaysia, we eat everything with it. Just as we would ask for ketchup, hot sauce or mayo here, we would ask for belacan to go with most of the dishes @ home. 

NOTE: They DONT take credit card --so go to your ATM first.  

I LOVE ISLAND MALAYSIAN ....this is one place I visit at least once or every two months for the past few years since they opened.",n_TY6rd1wXZBczBaOaK6Rw,6,5,5,ZwrjuVuCxVjohaWcZbKvNQ

From outside the place is rather modest, on the second floor of a small oriental mall at the far end of Spring Mountain.   Inside, it is also modest, with a band stand, and a pool table, suggesting it is a hangout for local Malaysians rather than a tourist spot.

From the first bite of the Roti Canai, a chicken, potato appetizer served in a coconut curry sauce, we sensed we were on to a winner.  It was so good we immediately ordered a second helping.  I'm a tofu fan, and enjoyed the stuffed tofu pockets.   We had 3 main courses, beef randang, char kway, mee siam - each was outstanding.

The roti canai was excellent! Perfect, crispy texture. The curry sauce was very hearty and even included a piece of meat!

Then, our entrees came.

The Ginger Scallion Duck turned out okay. The sauce tasted a little weird and didn't complement the duck very well. We ate a few pieces and just lost our appetite for it.

The Malaysia Buddha vegetable stir-fry seemed to have been just thrown together haphazardly with some hoisin sauce and vinegar.

We weren't impressed by the coconut rice either. The rice was mushy and came with a weird stringy substance.

Our total meal came out to $30 including tip/tax. We definitely did not feel like we got our money's worth. Maybe it would've been safer to just stick with the curries.",tf-bYwKeDuB-u1WOtvZsbw,3,0,2,z2QHi0ORY1zNnMjXZqjyQw

759879,2012-08-21,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"The only place in the city that I know of that makes Roti Canai. 

I love Malaysian food because it's pretty much Chinese food with an Indian twist. Island Malaysian Cuisine has all the Malaysian dishes I love, and sadly it's the only Malaysian restaurant in Vegas. I always get the Roti Canai, which is the Indian-style flatbread with chicken curry as a dipping sauce. The Roti is always made fresh, and comes out steaming hot and wrapped up on a plate. The chicken curry is oily  and only has 1 piece of chicken and potato, but it goes together so well with the Roti that I'm not complaining. I also like their Mee Goreng, which is fried  noodles mixed with shrimp, meat, tofu, potatoes, bean sprouts, chili sauce, and peanuts (sort of like Pad Thai).

The restaurant is owned and operated by a family, and the menu is very expansive. There's a picture book showing each item on the menu, which can be very helpful for new customers. I'm a bit surprised at the small amount of traffic they get though. Every time I come in for lunch or dinner, out of the 20 or so tables, only 3 or 4 are occupied. I wish more people would try this place out because it's definitely something different from the usual Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants you see all over Chinatown.",g4GA0o1DRARHKGhmxkiSBQ,2,1,4,Rdwev6vCyjYU6k5_y01byA

For main course, we ordered #43 which is a friend noodles with shrimp and bean sprouts. Just Ok, bland and I had to use hot sauce to give it some flavor. Another entrée was the Young chow fried rice. Rice was too mushy, again very BLAND, and had chicken and shrimp.

Hubby and I came here with a friend after I found it on Yelp.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a fairly large strip center.  There were probably 3 or 4 parties present when we arrived and as those left, new ones arrived.  The restaurant appeared to do a good amount of business.

After perusing the menu and the accompanying photo album, I ordered the following for the table:

Roti Canai
Mee Goreng
Chilli Chicken
Deep Fried Eggplant w/Dried Shrimp & Garlic
Coconut Flavor Rice
Steamed White Rice
Mango Sticky Rice

Our friend ordered wine and hubby ordered a Tiger Beer which was described as slightly stronger than a Heineken.  The wine was not to our friend's liking, so I'm guessing if you're one who regularly drinks wine, this is not the place to order it as they only serve one brand, I believe.  Hubby enjoyed the beer, though, and since he ordered a large, he shared some of it with our friend.

I ordered the Roti Canai based on Yelp reviews not really knowing what to expect.  The tortilla/naan was very good as was the dipping ""sauce""?  There were a few pieces of potato and a small piece of chicken w/lots of bones in the bowl with the sauce.  I'm not sure if we were supposed to just dip the bread in the sauce or actually put the potato and chicken in the bread and wrap it up like a burrito.  Regardless, the bones in the chicken made that a little difficult so we ended up just dipping.  The sauce was quite tasty!  Note, this appetizer really isn't large enough to share.

The Mee Goreng was different than what I had had before, but it was very good.  It was weird to get some potato in that, also, but the flavors and different textures all meshed well together.  The noodles seemed different from what I had had before, but it's been so long that I can't even remember what it's supposed to be like.  Regardless, it was good.  This was our friend's favorite dish of the dinner.

The Deep Fried Eggplant wDried Shrimp & Garlic arrived next and this dish was also very flavorful.  There was a large amount of eggplant and it was fried just enough to be crispy on the outside, but still silky smooth on the inside.  Flavors were fantastic and the dried shrimp added a bit of a crunchy texture, too.

The Chilli Chicken was by far my favorite entree of the dinner.  At first taste, the chicken was a bit dry, but it tasted really good.  The heat doesn't hit immediately and the initial flavor sort of dovetailed into the heat.  Hard to describe, but the complexities to get this flavor would be difficult to reproduce (which hubby is going to try!).

The Coconut Flavor Rice was not very exciting in my opinion.  The coconut flavor was so subtle that I didn't really even taste it with all the other flavors going on.  Also, it's difficult to share two bowls of rice amongst three people when you're just given plates and chopsticks.  Forks or extra bowls need to be requested.

For dessert, I wanted to try the mango sticky rice.  I asked if they had good mangoes and they said they weren't too sweet nor too sour.  The should have been a sign right there.  It was not good.  The rice wasn't bad, but the coconut milk was a bit watery and the mango was not ripe.  Lesson learned.  Maybe next time I'll try the shave-ice concoction.

I'd come back and try different dishes at this restaurant.  I know a few to avoid already, but there are also a few I'd definitely order again.  Staff was friendly and attentive, although I think sometimes had a problem understanding our questions due to the language barrier.  Very reasonably-priced, too!",K7vTmYHTnr0fjw807c8E2w,0,0,4,cwNnUbnurQKzCAhJcnaZUA

Super casual atmosphere in a funky Asian strip mall. The Roti canal was light and crispy. The Mee gorang was a spicy delight.

My husband and I decided to grab dinner here yesterday around 7:25 pm. When we came in, we were surprised to only see another table inside eating. But during the duration of our meal, more parties came in (I suppose people like to eat late on Saturday night). 

We were greeted by an employee and told to sit at a table. After that, we were given menus. We ended up ordering:

#1 Roti Canai, $3.95 prior to tax- One of my favorite Malaysian dishes. Roti is an Indian flatbread that is served with a side of curry sauce. This sauce has a little bit of chicken and potato in it. The curry sauce is flavorful. Be sure to wash your hands after you touch that menu so that you can eat this appetizer. Highly recommend ordering this as a starter to your meal. But you only get 1 flatbread and maybe just enough for 1 person (or a small portion to share for 2).

Hainanese Chicken (Half), $11.95 prior to tax- My husband decided to order this to share between us. This Hai Nan chicken is different from the traditional Chinese style, as the ginger is not as prominent and sits in a pool of soy sauce. I have had Malaysian style Hainanese style chicken before and thought this tasted the same as the one I had. I thought this chicken was good and liked the sliced cucumber slices (but did come out to be salty since it sits in the soy sauce). But didn't think there was anything really special about it. 

Side Of Chicken Flavored Rice, $1 prior to tax- Rice does not come with the half size chicken entree. But you can order the Hainanese chicken rice dish that comes with rice and only 1/4 chicken (which cost $7.50 prior to tax by the way). My husband and I ordered 2 bowls. The rice was perfectly seasoned and flavored with chicken broth. Moist and not too oily. I could eat this rice all day long.
-------------------------------
(Total= $19.38 after tax, prior to tip)

Service was friendly for the most part and our water glasses were refilled twice during our meal. 

WiFi is available (free) in case you wish to surf the net while you wait for your meal or wish to post photos on Yelp as your dishes are brought out to you (password: malaysian   please note that there are no capital letters). 

I think the food was good but didn't find anything special with what I had. But I would be open to coming back here again, trying one of the many other entrees on the menu (as there are a lot of choices).

I've now spent $20 on two different Groupons to try to eat here with a discount. No one is forcing them to do business with Groupon, it is their choice.

First experience: Came in and there was a large group dining. Server ignored me for several minutes, then said they would be unable to help me for nearly an hour because the large party had just ordered. How unprofessional. 

Second experience: Went in to order takeout, placed order for $30 worth of food to meet their $10 card minimum. Cashier refused to accept my Groupon for takeout order even though it doesn't state dine in only anywhere in the fine print. She walked away as I was talking to her- I assumed she went to get a manager, but when she returned she simply ignored me until I asked to speak to management. Then she twirled around in a circle and facetiously chirped at me, HI, I'M MANAGER, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

We were wanting to try something new and we saw an ad for Island Malaysian in a magazine. Of course I looked it up on Yelp and was drawn in to the delightful, yummy-looking pictures.

It's located in a giant Chinatown stripmall (by the Chinese grocery store). The decor inside is surprisingly cute, very island-y and clean. The big plastic, orange chopsticks are fun too. The menus also come with a large black binder, it reminded me of a karaoke book. Inside are numbered pictures of all the dishes, which correspond with the numbers in the menu.

We ordered:

-Lychee juice
-Fresh young coconut
-Roto canai
-Basil noodles
-Spicy beef with side of cucumbers
-Peanut bread dessert
-Mango sticky rice dessert

Deelish! The lychee juice tastes refreshing and is not overly sweet. I will upload a picture. I loved the roto canai ""tissue"" bread. Tearing off pieces and dipping it in to the little bowl of curry that comes with it was lovely. Great flavor and texture.

The basil noodles were marked as spicy in their menu but (blame my Korean palate) I definitely could have taken it a lot more spicier. I will just have to ask for it extra spicy next time. The peanut bread was crushed peanuts with honey and butter inside the ""tissue"" breading. Not overly sweet but very tasty.

Service was good, the middle-aged woman who sat us and served us was really friendly and helpful.

If you like Thai and Indonesian food, give Malaysian food a try. Malaysia the country is mainly made up of ethnic Malay, Chinese and Indian, so the food tends to get influence from all these races, making them unique. Get a few dishes and share around the table.

Long story short, I have a friend who is from Guyana and every time we go to an Indian place he comments that it's not real roti.  There's always a problem-- too thick, too thin, too sweet, too dry.  It's like a Goldie Locks thing.  After trying another place, I suggested here due to Yelp review.  I got a look when I said Spring Mountain followed by Malaysian, but he was willing to try.

We got there 30 minutes before they closed, and they didn't seem to mind at all.  We immediately ordered the roti canai.  I thought it was great, and he thought that it is the closest that he had had in a very long time.  After ordering a second one and explaining to the waitress what was going on, she told her husband the cook.  He came out of the kitchen and chatted with us for a bit and said that it's one of those foods that your family may make slightly different than his.  We asked them for a food suggestion for an entry, and we got some kind of a hybrid between the chili chicken and the mango chicken.  Good stuff!  They even let us order mango sticky rice before we left.

There was another group still there, and while being there after close, they really didn't seem to care.  When we left they gave us a red envelop because it was Chinese New Year.  It had a coupon, but the gesture was a nice touch.  Very nice people at the restaurant.  I will be back.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,2,1,5,J8xWHaRp8xDzCNoQSxj1Fw

They have a full picture menu for those of us that don't regularly dine on Malaysian food.   

So, as you may have guessed I come here for the Roti Canai.  It is an individual appetizer, and at around $4 it is a great deal...but they also usually have a buy one get one free with a Yelp Check-in!

Seafood Chow Fun
Lamb Rendang
Kang Kung (Dried Shrimp & Chilli or Garlic)
String Beans 
Lady Finger Belacan  
The Pineapple Fried Rice

Mango Sticky Rice

This place is located on the second floor in the chinatown strip mall. When we arrived, it was empty. The place is huge. 

My husband had no idea what to choose because they have so many choices to choose from. The menu so huge. 

We ordered one of my favorite Malaysian char kwee teow, I chose the nasi lemak with chicken rendang and my husband chose the beef rendang with coconut rice. 

The char kwee teow was okay, the shrimp was too mushy, didn't have a bite texture. It was like reheated frozen shrimp or been in the sauce way too long. 

My nasi lemak was good, the chicken rendang was good also and the beef rendang was also good. The rendang sauce was very flavorful but different from Indonesian rendang which is what I'm used to. The beef cooked perfect.

The ambiance is classy casual. They had dim romantic lighting with a quirky island theme all around - there's a huge tropical mural on the wall and the door to the bathroom says ""nature calls"". Also, there were only 2 servers (no hostess) on the entire floor that night, so they were busy running around all over tending the tables, but we felt that service was still efficient and friendly. 

Here's what we ordered:
1. Roti Canai $3.75: Crispy Indian style pancake with a potato curry and chicken dipping sauce - The roti bread was large, fresh and delicate, crispy yet soft, and lightly sweetened. It was a great vessel for the flavorful chicken and potato curry. Our biggest complaint was the curry was such a teeny tiny portion (a wee amount of curry and one tiny piece of chicken and 1 small potato) - we were fighting each other for the last bites! 4/5

2. Char kway teow $7.95: Penang's famous stir fired flat rice noodles with shrimp, squid, eggs, chives and bean sprouts in a spicy black soya chili sauce - Beautiful presentation. They served it up in a mini wok perfect size for 2 (looks way bigger in pictures). It tasted like a better version of basic Chinese chow fun noodles, with a little more flavor. They cooked everything expertly and I especially loved how they put extra eggs in the dish. That's my favorite part! Not a flavor explosion, but an overall well executed dish. 5/5

3. Ayam rendang (curry chicken) $11.95 - We took a shot in the dark with this dish. I've had rendang curry before, just not this style of preparation. The chicken pieces were roughly chopped with all bone still in tact. Although the chicken was moist, we both wished they did a cleaner job with butchering the chicken. There were many small and dangerous shards of bone that were almost swallowed throughout our dinner. Also the curry was rich and thick, but very flat in flavor. This wasn't a favorite dish that night. 1/5

4. The coconut rice ($1 a bowl) was very aromatic and fragrant. I would recommend that rice with any of your curries or entrees. 5/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,8,4,4,yW5dZrI7fGkDyZlMedcH_A

recommendations. I was planning on getting the Nasi Lemak and the Ayam Rendang. The owner came over to take my order and told me that the Nasi Lemak already comes with the Ayam Rendag. Whew,mistake avoided.

The star of the show and the main reason why I was super excited to come back, is their coconut pudding. The coconut pudding is spectacular!! I would have been devastated if they had run out of this pudding.

It is not your average crappy, artificial coconut pudding. This pudding is made from the fresh meat and liquids of the coconut itself. The pudding remains inside of the young coconut. The dessert arrives chilled and it is massive! 

Nasi Lemak- This consists of rice shaped in a mound, anchovies, peanuts and Ayam Rendang chicken. The anchovies are dried and taste salty. The Ayam Rendang chicken has soft bone in chicken covered in a paste made of chilies, lemongrass, lime leaves, and coconut. We ordered it at low spice so my friends could eat it. This dish was good, but the sauce was on the thinner side. I like the sauce to be so thick that it sticks to the meat and when it is spicy.

Kari Mee- This is a noodle soup dish that uses a light curry broth base and has thin yellow noodles. You can choose the vegetarian or chicken option. The curry broth was flavorful and went well with the noodles. I did not like the way the shredded chicken tasted. 
I am pretty particular with chicken. The chicken flavor would have been improved by rubbing more spices into the flesh, so that the raw chicken smell and taste don't cling onto the meat, even after cooking. It is so so important to do this.

All of the desserts I have had: coconut pudding, Bobo chacha- warm milk with balls of yam, pearls etc, ice kachang- shaved ice with different sauces, red beans, crushed nuts (made differently in each restaurant) are extremely good.

If you come here you absolutely must try their coconut pudding. I can't wait to come back again. I will be dreaming of you, coconut pudding.",iuqXV-puBMppS0DLwzfEXg,3,2,4,DAyV4gaUAeEEA6tqlJFx6w

We had appetizers of Satay (Thai but noticeably different) and Curry Puffs that were the best I've tasted. We also had Malaysian tea that was comparable to Thai tea but not as sweet or Indian Chai, great taste anyway. Our main courses we easy to choose because besides their regular menu they also provide a picture book menu that allowed my companion to choose between a few different options. i ended up getting the Hokkian Char Mee because I'd been suggested to by Malay friends and besides it's fun to say ;-) My companion I'd turned on to lemongrass so she ordered Kari Mee soup which she said was some of the best soup she's ever eaten! There was too much for her to eat which made her daughter VERY happy when she got the leftovers. There weren't many guests because we went early for dinner so service was wonderful and we chatted with their friendly staff. From the discussion if you know what foods you like from the nationalities mentioned at my beginning, have the staff suggest something to you. We liked this so much that wild horses couldn't stop us from returning! Though when we do we'll bring a bigger crowd. BTW I NEVER give 5 stars because it's associated with LOVING something and I believe you can only really, really, really LIKE food but the interaction with the staff put them over the top!",6pT9eePRb2-UEBPvsVhWOw,1,0,5,Hg-txrtWpa7Jl7OhI1R0nQ

My fam and I discovered this restaurant years ago until they it shut down. It had a different name then, but the food seemed to remain the same. Service is awesome and they always remember what we want to order, since we became regulars here. :]

There are not many known Malaysian restaurants here in Vegas, so if you're feeling a lil adventurous and craving for some yummy Asian food, definitely give this place a try! You won't be disappointed ;]

3198670,2011-11-24,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"I first encountered Island Malaysian Cuisine over at the 1st annual Asian Food Festival at The Orleans on October 1st and 2nd. I tried them because the roti that the owner, Steven, was spreading out, looked thin, airy, and bouncy, before it was pounded onto the griddle by one of his minions and made into a thick and non-fluffy and non-airy dough.

Of course, I gave them the benefit of the doubt, and am absolutely glad that I did, because I really enjoyed the food at their restaurant. If you want a really traditional dish, you should try their 

Assam Laksa: noodle soup with a broth made from fish and lemongrass. They do a great job of using the freshest ingredients and keep it warm in a clay pot for you. 

Mee Goreng: mee going crazy... slightly sweet, slightly sour, slightly spicy noodles and we chose chicken as the protein to go with the dish, but they have other offerings such as beef and shrimp.

String beans were so fresh, I thought they just picked it out of the ground. The string beans were plump and juicy and went well with the slightly spicy dried scallop and dried shrimp sauce.

Also, I extremely enjoyed the 

Roti Canai: with their chunks of potatoes and chicken. The roti was really fluffy and airy and the best I've ever had. Then Steven and his wife, Tess, told me about an off-menu item that they were thinking about adding to the menu.

It's called the 

Roti Tissue: The second time I went to the restaurant, I tried it. It is absolutely amazing. I have no words for this dish. To describe what it actually is, well, it's crispy thin roti sprinkled with sugar with curry on the side to dip pieces of the giant ""Tissue"" into. Just break off any crazy-size you want. When it came out, we were wowed by the tent-shaped looking dish. This is a must-try!!! 

To finish the second night, I tried the Ice Kachang, which I also had at the Asian Food Festival. The ice kachang is $1 more for ice cream, which we got. It was really delicious and the syrup that they use is awesome. At the Asian Food Festival, I also tried the Coconut Jelly. This is one of the best desserts I have ever tried. It is not too sweet, the texture is awesome, and because real coconut comes with the jelly, it is very deliciously balanced.

I will definitely be back to try the rest of their dishes. Their service was also really good and I loved hearing about how they ended up opening at the former Penang space. Their ambience is casual with a tried-for island feel with two orange barrels and a metal top as a counter, some metal hot air balloons as lights, and a giant and beautiful painting of a sandy shore-side view out into the ocean with palm trees help any uptight person relax. I also saw that they have a roadrunners.com sticker on their window, so I'm sure they deliver.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,1,0,5,Tjfv8FjCkr6SrpsSzcC_5g

There aren't many MALAYSIAN food places around Vegas, so I may be a little biased. I have never had any authentic Malaysian food either, so... I guess this may be going out on a whim, BUT... my experience here has been amazing!

They have an EXTENSIVE menu, and then a separate binder that has PICTURES... of EVERYTHING on the menu! Seriously, that made our selection process 50x easier! 

I can't remember everything we've had, but I know that the coconut rice is a must get, and so is the Roti Canai. YUM. 

Malaysian spices are more defined than Thai, since they use less coconut milk. I want to say that it's closer in taste to Indian cuisine, but not as bold. 

Anyway, the interior is very themed, and they have a little mini-pool set for children to play. On top of that, the service was beyond amazing.

The owner, which is also a server and cashier (but her name slips my mind... UGHH!) was extra nice, and VERY patient with us when we were making selections, and was not shy to offer her opinions on what we might like, and suggestions as well.

Here is the list of what we ordered:

- Roti canai is dry and missing some much needed oil. The dipping sauce has a nice touch and actually come with chicken and potatoes. It's flavorful, but missing the kick...
- Roti telur is weird, probably the best description. The inside is not cooked properly (a bit soggy), as the roti was also not cooked with enough oil..
- Sambal squid is ok. The squid is fresh with a good cruch, and the sauce is tasty. I wish it was a bit more spicy, but not a bad dish at all
- Lamb Rendang was probably the best dish of the day. The lamb is moist and tender, and the sauce was very well made. The presentation could have been better with the sauce covering the lamb. It was obvious that the lamb and sauce were cooked separately.
- Hainan chicken was a bit dry, the rice was nicely cooked and flavorful, but the chilli sauce was lacking some vinegar and spiciness
- Rojak needed a bit more sauce, but it was decent. 
- Congee was probably the worst dish of the meal. The rice was chunky and weren't cooked very well, and it needed more seasoning.

Rendang had sauce. Rendang is not supposed to have sauce. But like I said maybe cos it's Malaysian, it has sauce. As for sambal petai, the petai was not very strong. I think they boiled the petai first to reduce the stink. The vegetable used isn't exactly the right taste for sambal petai. It should be shallot based as well. We also ordered kangkung belacan, which is a bit disappointing. It was garlic and belacan based but it just needed more kick. I thought it would be garlic, shallot, and belacan based. Rojak has too much shrimp paste (petis) and not enough sweet soy sauce, not a good balance. Some people like that tho... I'm picky on it since my mom makes it quite much and petis is an East Javanese thing so I know it quite a bit since I'm from the area where it comes from. Baikut teh was the only thing we enjoyed a lot but it's hard to mess that up. Asked for sambal and it's this soggy thing you put your bakso in and it wasn't spicy at all. What kind of sambal isn't spicy... Anyway at the end, I make better food at home, which was not the point of coming here. Rendang takes 4 hours to simmer and I don't wanna do it at home that's why I came here but it's half-assed too so I'm disappointed. The taste overall is ok though.

Probably my favorite meal.

In my opinion it's a very welcoming cuisine to try, the flavors are mild and it balances spice, sweet, and vinegar really well. Now that I've convinced you to try Malaysian food you want to what to order right. I can't say these are the best dishes the country has to offer but here are some of my favorites. 

Roti Kanai: Its not Indian style naan nor is it West Indian Roti. It's Malaysian style; crispy and flaky served with a small bowl of curry chicken. The curry is mild in flavor but delicious. 

Beef Rendang: It reminds me of stewed curry beef maybe that's what Rendang means, there is way more flavor in the beef version of this dish than the chicken. 

Chili Chicken: This is a dry chicken dish. No, the chicken isn't dry it's just not in sauce. Its crispy and has a sweet and spicy flavor to it. 

I enjoy the majority of the rice and noodle dishes there, the stand out ones include the noodles served in a wok at the table and the basil and pineapple fried rice. 

I recommend trying this place and then driving across the street for some Taiwanese shaved ice. You're welcome.",rTydTPQKKXoysaVPC0CLxw,2,2,5,J5Ea11Vv1zVcpSx4cZEbjA

I decided to try this restaurant for my birthday, and I'm glad I did.

They have a lot of options on their menu, and they even have a separate picture book with the items they have. I thought this was awesome since, majority of the time, I'm unsure of what to order when trying a new place. Pictures help, big time!

I decided to order some items that I already know: Laksa, Roti & Curry (canai), Hainanese Chicken, and Beef Rendang.
We also ordered a couple other noodle dishes.

Everything was delicious. Their laksa & beef rendang tasted a little different than what I'm used to, but it's probably because I've gotten used to the Singaporean style laksa.
Nonetheless, it was still yummy and my family & I finished everything!

Prices & portion sizes are reasonable, restaurant is spacious & clean, and they even have an area with a pool table & foosball table. The manager was super nice & made sure my birthday lunch was special.

Every time we visit Las Vegas, we spend most of our meals here- at this gem of Malaysian cuisine that we can't get as good anywhere else.  Serious!  Who would go anywhere 3 meals in a row unless they were nutz about the food?!

So this place used to be called Penang and we had been coming here for a few years.  We look forward to eating all the foods we can't get back home.  Despite the Grand Opening sign, we decided to try it out since we already had Malaysian food on our minds.  Low and behold, we walk in, and it's the same wait staff and chef with whom we were so familiar with.  Apparently the chef is now the owner (thought he was the owner before) so we were quite relieved!  We don't even know what their names are, but we are definitely their biggest fans.  When we show up, they already know which dishes we want.  Now that's personal service!

The restaurant is spacious, very clean and comfortable.  The wife of the chef is the waitress and she's warm and friendly!

Here's what we have and recommend.  By the way, they have 150 menu items and we said we'll try them all, eventually.  

Wine chicken soup:  Oooooh, just like how my mom used to make.  This is so amazing.  The flavors in each of their dishes is so delish!

Bak Kut Teh- Chinese Herbal soup.  I don't know if there are medicinal benefits to this soup, but it sure is yummy!

Satay tofu- tofu stuffed with beansprouts and peanuts with peanut dipping sauce.  Yum!

Roti telur- this homemade roti is stuffed with egg and onions and very tasty. 

Roti canai- light fluffy homemade pancake served with chicken curry sauce

Homemade tofu- love love love this dish.  So tasty!

Char kway teow- fried flat noodles kind of like chow fun, with shrimp and squid.

Clay pot noodles- crispy fried noodles with seafood in clay pot with sauce.

Pearl noodles- another dish just like how mom used to make.

Pangang stripe bass- this fish can be made any way and we chose this authentic malaysian dish steamed in banana leaf.

Chicken rice- this is so yummy and such a simple dish, and sooo yummy!

For dessert, we had mango and sticky rice and ice kachang which is like a malaysian snow cone with red beans, grass jelly, jelly, condensed milk, and corn.  Very yummy.

They also have crab if you order ahead of time and they can cook it any way you want.  

The only thing bad about this place is when we get home, we always gained weight, so exercise, here we come!  

Island Malaysian Cuisine is a MUST TRY if you enjoy malaysian food like we do (and I'm not even malaysian but I am a FOODIE)!  Trust me, this is authentic Malaysian Singaporean Chinese cuisine.

We have been coming here for years, but I forget to check in every time, and this review is long overdue. When you first enter this establishment, you'll notice the wooden tables and chairs, dim lighting from the ceiling, and a large mural of a beach. A nod to Malaysia's geographic location. lol If you're not familiar with Malaysian food, it is a mixture of Indian, Thai & Chinese. It resembles a bit of Indonesian and Filipino food as well. The cool thing about this place is that they have two menus. The main menu lists and describes each item while their numbered picture menu shows what each numbered dish looks like! It's a great visual aspect when deciding what to order.

Food that our party ordered:

1.) Roti Canai- Soft and crispy flat bread accompanied with Chicken & Potatoes dipping curry sauce. (Awesome & Popular dish, great way to start out as an appetizer.)

2.) Coconut Fried Rice- Seasoned rice with chicken, shrimp & coconut flavoring garnish with sliced cucumbers and hard boiled eggs. Delicious and balanced spices with a hint of sweetness. (A family favorite.)

3.) Beef Rendang- Slow cooked beef with a curry paste based seasoning. Soft texture and resembles Filipino Pork Adobo at first glance.

4.) Basil Chicken- Basil flavoring sauce with a hint of curry spice and onion taste that went well with the chicken.

5.) Char Kway Teow- Flat style noodle dish with a stir fry appearance without sauce or gravy but mixed with seafood and veggies that are seasoned with a slight smokey taste.

6.) Dang Kung Belacan- Water Spinach with Malaysian shrimp paste flavoring, which is a.k.a Kang Kung in Filipino and this vegetable is popular among SouthEast Asians.

Overall, I always enjoy Island Malaysian. The family that owns and operates this restaraunt is friendly and accomadating. If you haven't tried Malaysian food before and you're feeling adventerous, give this place a try! Especially if you can't decide if you want Indian, Chinese, or Thai.

When I was in LV last month I discovered Island Malaysian Cuisine, and can confidently pronounce it one of the best and most authentic restaurants serving Malaysian food in the US. Among the dishes I liked are: curry mee, char koay teow, Hainan chicken rice, nasi lemak, roti canai, satay, coconut pudding and peanut pancake. Outstanding were the lobak and chendol which were as good as back in Penang, Malaysia. We ended up going there for lunch on three different occasions and twice for dinner during the week we were in LV. The ikan bilis sambal, and chicken rendang were also excellent. Another outstanding dish was the ladies fingers (okra) stir fried with sambal udang, which was incredibly good. I only wish I had more time to try out their other dishes but since I and my wife spent a lot of time visiting the nearby national parks outside LV, we were not able to do so. The service was excellent and the waitress was very nice about making recommendations since we invited some Taiwanese friends for dinner, who had never tried Malaysian cuisine before, and we wanted a combination of dishes that complement each other for a comprehensive meal.

We had a pretty much a late lunch super early dinner and decided to share all our meals to get a feel of what the restaurant is all about. 

For appetizers we ordered the roti with the chicken curry. This dish is pretty alright except maybe the roti wasn't as crispy as I wanted. But overall the curry was pretty good! 

Service here was also excellent and super fast. I felt like every dish that we ordered was given to us in less than five minutes time! 

As for main dishes we ordered a noodle called aksam laksa which is a sweet and sour noodle soup that is pretty fishy but the flavor was still bearable! If you don't like fish flavor maybe skip this dish. But overall it tasted very similar to how it is in Malaysia. 

The other dish was chicken rice which the chicken was drenched in black soy sauce. This is a bold strong flavor but of course with the rice it evens out. 

For dessert we tried the durian sticky rice and to my surprise it wasn't hot which I loved!! I thought the blend with the durian and rice together was just perfect!! 

Overall we all enjoyed the food and had an awesome time!! Glad we did stop by and try this place out.

The spacious and casual interior was conducive for small and large group gatherings. For some reason, we were the only diners in a sizable restaurant during these visits. Given the subdued atmosphere, it was difficult to get excited for an excitable cuisine when the food was this poorly put together.

The Roti Canai ($3.95) was the highlight of the meal. The Roti was warm, soft, crisp, fluffy, flaky, and thick enough to soak up the bowl of spicy chicken curry. The side of curry was complex, nicely balanced between sweet and spicy flavors. Additionally, the embedded chicken and potato were nicely simmered and flavorful. Very tasty, I really enjoyed it.

The Hainan Chicken ($7.50) was made with steamed chicken layered on soy sauce, rice seasoned with chicken fat, and a side dish of sweet red chili. The chicken tasted very bland, heavily dependent on the two sauces for seasoning. There were also more bones than meat in the chicken, making this dish difficult to eat and to complement the aromatic flavors stemming from the rice. It was off putting, and I was underwhelmed.

Equally underwhelming was the Nasi Lemak ($8.50) that came with coconut-flavored rice, chicken, fried anchovies, cucumber slices, and hardboiled egg. For some reason, there were no shrimps in the dish, even though the menu suggested that it would be included. The chicken was spicy but overcooked. The salty-sweet-spicy anchovies were the only item that nicely accompanied the coconut-flavored rice. 

Service was very pushy, as we were encouraged to order their Lobster Special on several occasions. We came with so much anticipation, but find the food and service to fall below expectations. Completely underwhelmed and unsatisfied. We will not be coming back.",0juzbrgcLHqobdK-OZAyiw,29,32,2,80YzVwAP1G2Lgcq-fjXplw

2 stars = chicken curry.  At first I told my friends...really?  We're ordering Chicken Curry? LOL. But it was actually quite tasty, and  even though the soup base was a tad on the watery side, it exploded with flavor!

3 stars = Char Kway Teow. It comes with an abundance of egg which I love!

4 stars = for their picture menu!  If you don't know what to order because you're unsure of what is in it, or how it is cooked, or how it looksl ike, they have a picture menu for your to look.  Dude.  Best idea ever!

Lacks the 5th star because the Sizzling Beef we ordered was super salty, and the Mango with Sweet Rice was a little off (rice was a bit hard, coconut sauce was watery, and the mango wasn't the right texture).

The waitress was reluctant to take dishes back. One of our dishes had meat and my cousin doesnt eat too much meat, and the other dish had runny egg, which grosses me out (nothing like the dishes at the table next to us) So we had to double order food.

It reminded me of Southeast Asian comfort food. Very rustic, lots of stews and soups, and lots of slow cooked items. Everything is super flavorful with lots of spices. It also reminds me of Thai food without the limes or sour notes.

I don't think they serve just Malaysian food. Just like many Asian restaurants this place has some Thai dishes and Chinese dishes. I'm not sure if they are Malaysian twists on Thai and Chinese dishes but I'll try them one day.

We had very nice servers. We got some recommendations but decided on some ""classic"" dishes we both heard of.

Everything came out fast and fresh. Everything was piping hot.

We had barley water, roti with curry, curry puffs, beef rendeng, curry mee, charr geau theuy, and chicken rice. Everything came out to $50. For two beverages, two appetizers, and three entrees it was a good price.

The roti curry app was small. I wish I got my own except we had so much food! Roti is like a super thin and crisp crepe. The curry was really good. It had potatoes and chicken.

Beef rendeng is a spicy braised beef dish with a thick curry like sauce. It was super spicy as in spices and as in heat. It was delicious with the chicken rice. The rice was like Hainese chicken rice. The beef was very tender.

Charr guea thyeu is like Thai pad se ewe except with lots of bean sprouts and sea food. It had shrimp and squid in it. I liked the strong wok taste and how natural it tasted.

Curry puffs are like empanadas filled with curried potatoes, peas, and possibly a meat. I did like this but it was bland compared to how good everything else was.

Curry mee was a curry noodle soup. It reminded me of Thai ka soi. It had a really rich meat and coconutty flavor. It was spicy and just good. I can't really describe it but I definitely recommend this.

The staff was nice. They did a good job with the questions we asked and with recommending dishes. Malaysian food is delicious. With this place being affordable and the food being delicious I can't wait to come back.

My two cents would be the wait for the check was off. This can be so awkward! Maybe let us know before hand if we have to walk up to the counter to get our check or to wait on the staff. We waited a good 10-15 minutes after obviously being done eating. 

Last the food is a bit greasy. I understand this as most of the dishes are slow cooked meats in sauce or soup. Not a down side but just an FYI to the picky eaters. I just equated this to more flavorful food.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,1,1,4,eZDlGTGZFXamGJa3RJz_Yg

Ordered Malaysian Tea, Wonton Soup, Mee Gorang, Sizzling Beef, Kang Kung w Garlic, Coconut and Chicken Rice. 

The Malaysian tea is a must try. It's so good. The best way to explain how it taste would be a mixture of thai tea and milk tea! Yum!!

Wonton soup was only $7 and you can literally feed 6 people. Real wontons filled w meat, you get like 12 pieces of them. 

Mee Gorang is almost like pad Thai but at the same time it's not pad Thai. Very interesting and good. 

Kang Kung taste like most other ong Choy dishes at any asian restaurant. 

Sizzling beef was not good at all. Picture showed an all beef dish but we got a beef dish cooked w peppers and a lot of black bean and that made the dish taste weird. 

All in all, it's not bad at all. Really loved the tea and wonton soup. Pricing was not bad for the food but the side rice are $1 each and the tea was about $3 each for a small coffee cup size (wished it would be a bigger cup or lower price).",ZF-1QU2jweLa59a5gYQptA,4,1,4,1eda_CAcECjdCi6UoSvHSQ

We ordered the roti, the first noodle soup dish and lamb. Being hungry, we devoured each dish before the next came out. The Roti was not fried so it was not greasy. I rather liked it more this way. It also came with a bowl of curry for dipping. There was a piece of chicken and potato in the bowl. For less than $5, it was really awesome.
The noodle dish was good and had a seafood flavor like Big Wong's shrimp soup. What I didn't like about the noodle dish is I think it was spaghetti noodles, and I usually like soft noodle but these were almost mushy. The lamb was not gamey and had all this brown sauce over it. When I see that I think it would be too salty but it was actually perfect in flavor. These are not flavors I am used I'm not even sure what they used to make it with. We finished everything. 

What I didn't like was their tea. It was supposed to be Jasmine but they were flavorless bags of tea.

I could go on and on. They seem to have been here for a while, dating back to a older incarnation under the name of Penang, and they can handle somewhat larger groups like our party of 9.

I had a number of dishes, and they ranged from pretty good to unimpressive (which was why some of the following descriptions are uninspired).

Roti Canai ($3.95): pretty nice crispy ""Indian-style"" pancake. The chicken curry is nice, but the portion is pretty small. It might serve two if you're not hungry.

Char Kway Teo ($8.50): seems more similar to Chinese flat noodle dishes than the Thai pad see ew. Luscious noodles. Most enjoyable dish here, but also not as interesting as the more boldly sauced pad see ew or other Thai dishes.

Ginger Scallion Duck ($7.50): served with rice. This was okay, but forgettable, and is probably just a Chinese dish.

Beef with Broccoli? ($11.50): this almost looks like Beef with Broccoli but came with Chinese broccoli instead. It's an okay version of the dish, but it reads full-on Chinese.

Kari Sotong? ($12.95): didn't hear what the tablemate ordered, but this seems to match the menu description of a curry dish with squid. It was good, so perhaps we should've had more curries here.

Sizzling Seafood Combination Delight ($15.95): another standard Chinese restaurant dish. Shrimp, scallop, mushroom, veggies. Seems pricey for so little.

I may come back to Island Malaysian Cuisine for the noodles or the curries, but the sampling which I had wasn't very special (or spicy) overall. I'd rather just grab Thai food.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,3,NaXcVOzDaAUQF_LQ6KUkmQ

If I had to explain what type of dishes Malaysian food had to offer I would have to say it's a mixture of/influenced by Chinese, Thai, and Indian food FYI.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a shopping complex in Chinatown.  The inside is really nice but dark, there is ambient string lights hung throughout.  The place was immaculately clean too always a plus.  We were the only patrons inside the restaurant on a Saturday around 5:30 pm.  Because of that we were instantly seated and received phenomenal service.  They have a pretty extensive menu so I would recommend looking over the menu online beforehand if you have the chance.  They also have a separate menu with photos of the dishes so you have a general idea of what you're ordering.  I genuinely enjoyed every dish I had here and already have plans to come back here to eat at again! 

We ordered:
-Char Kway Teow ($7.95) - sautéed flat noodles with bean sprouts with generous helpings of squid and shrimp, this and the homemade tofu is tied for my favorite dish here! 
-Beef Satay ($6.25) - decent appetizer, honestly could have done without this though
-Basil Beef ($10.95) - solid dish, no frills similar to basil beef dishes you would order at a Thai restaurant, tasty and full of flavor!   
-Homemade Tofu ($13.95) - tofu made in house, with shrimp, squid, and some type of fish served in a tasty sauce.  If you are a seafood lover definitely order this dish, it was great!
-Ice Kacang ($3.95) - shaved iced dessert served with red beans, corn, palm seeds, and jelly, sounds really weird but it's good.  If you're on the more adventurous side try it out.",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,2,2,5,aEFCRvC1K8EVc1jvwfuVKQ

My first encounter and love for Malaysian food started with a simple curry puff back when I was a young child. I love curry, so it was a nice twist to curry bread or curry anything. 

This restaurant is in the least expected location. I got to try a medley of foods, but my main purpose was to go try the Hainan chicken with rice since Flock & Fowl was closed that day. 

Curry puffs- 3.5 stars. I think the pastry could have been better, as well as the filling. 

Kan Kung with garlic - 5 stars. Great veggie dish I loved it!

Pineapple fried rice- 3 stars. It was good but not extraordinary. 

Hainan chicken with chicken rice - 3.5 stars. The chicken was lukewarm, and I prefer mine hotter. You also have to order chicken rice as an additional as it doesn't come with it FYI. 

Thai chicken special of the day- 5 stars. I loved the sauce for this chicken dish, and it's poached like Hainan chicken. It was also warmer in temperature as well. Definite must try!! 

Condensed milk iced coffee- 5/5. I'm no coffee expert, but this was goooooood. 

I was bummed out that they didn't have the flaky pastry bread. I can't remember what it's called, but it was one of my fave Malaysian dishes.

Started with the tissue roti (see picture). Over 2 ft. tall, makes an impression when it arrives. What you don't know is that it has a light coating of sugar on the inside! Its addictively tasty by itself, but interesting when combined with the accompanying curry dipping sauce. (Also handy as dessert if you still have it hanging around after your entrees are polished off). 

Speaking of entrees - we had the shrimp char kway teow (with mushrooms subbed for squid) and the beef red curry. Both were incredible. The red curry I have to say is the perfect winter dinner -it arrives still bubbling-cauldron-hot, and is rich, warming and satisfying. Get a side of rice to go with. The shrimp char kway teow - will get this again. Wasn't greasy, good flavor and a great choice if you want something not sauced. I'm betting its more of a healthy option, relatively speaking. Fabu!

- kang king belachan or okra belachan

I've tried the durian sticky sticky rice for dessert a couple of times, one time the durian was still partially frozen, the other time, the durian was warm. Either way, the flavor was milder and the texture wasn't the same as fresh durian. The sticky rice part was also sweeter than I prefer. Not my favorite dessert, but it was still nice to get a hint of durian.

I also tried the peanut pancake and it's not quite the same as I'm use to, you don't get the chewy, fluffy pancake, but it's more like a roti pancake. The peanut filling was still nutty, sweet and salty though.",rdBgTExp0PJGcXXejLPxmA,0,0,5,Vi7HU7Wz9NZgF-Q9q83XVw

Roti canai- the roti was chewy and warm. The curry was flavorful but a little on the watery side. Would have liked it if it was thicker. 

Char kwa tew. Not sure of the spelling but it's basically Malaysian flat noodles with seafood. I liked this dish. It has a mild flavor and is close to pad see ew. I ate this with the rendeng curry and it was delicious.

Mee goo rang - an Indian noodle dish that is loaded with great flavor. It's savory a little tart and a little spicy. Liked this more than the char kwa tew. 

Eggplant- heavy fish sauce flavor and is fried but the flavor was delicious.

Tong cho - the name on the menu starts with a k. I forgot. The veggies were a little chewy but the shrimp paste gave it an awesome salty flavor. 

Lamb rendeng. The curry sauce is delicious. It comes with a couple pieces of lamb that has bones in it. Beware. 

Hainanese chicken - it's basically soy sauce chicken served Luke warm. Very basic dish but classic dish. 

Lo mein with chicken - this dish was probably the least flavorful for me. The gravy sauce is very subtle and mild. I don't think I would order this again but if you need a break from curry/ shrimp paste/ fish sauce flavors you might want to order this.",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,6,4,5,hqf7IhhUw-Y1ATzn4ZNjrw

5048515,2013-01-11,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"Their rice game here is ridiculous. 

My BFs grandma grew up in Indonesia and that cuisine isn't really available anywhere, but Malaysia shares many similarities so we thought to bring her here. She ended up not coming, but the BF,my MIL and I went. I kinda know a bit about Malay food, but they have a picture menu binder they give people as well as a regular text menu which was helpful. 

We ordered: 

BBQ Pork fried rice - it had really nice flavor, the bbq pork was sweet and succulent and the rice was really soft and fluffy, not greasy at all. My only critique about this is that it had large slices of red onion which would have been okay well cooked, but it was a bit raw.

Rendang Ayam- I'm a big fan of the bold thick rendang and this one was definitely hitting the mark in flavor. This is a bone- in, skin on chicken so it was more flavorful with that, but it makes it a bit messy to eat. The portion was about half a chicken so they give you a sizable amount. I will be ordering this again, but with a red meat as I think that holds rendang flavors well. 

Captains Noodles - we got it w/o shrimp for the MIL but it was still good. These are saucy noodles, swimming in a sweet soy based sauce which was good but maybe a bit sweet for me. 

One thing I oddly have to rave about is their rice. Their fried rice and plain white rice was so soft and fluffy and well seasoned. It's harder to achieve than you would think to hit that mark, but I love it when I could find it. I only keep brown rice at home now, so it's a rare treat to find good white rice when eating out. 

This is a halal place and so the meats reflect that. The chicken will be more ""chicken-y"" as this isn't your big farm mass produced usual chicken. 

We ordered grandma food to-go. Chicken satay was rather small, but decent enough. It is really sweet though so we did a bit like ""thai style"" and dip a little vinegar onto them to balance it out. She wanted kari ayam curry but with fried tofu and they accommodated it for us. It was alright, rather tangy of a curry. I wasn't a fan and neither was she though, but it might just not be in our taste. 

Service was decent here. Our drinks were refilled before they got were empty. 

Now I want more fluffy rice.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,3,4,gDRWBow9_XbjuvXfh4Pyhw

""The whole world doesn't speak English.  Winge winge winge.  They have pictures, Just point"" I say to Midwest poker bud who immediately shows off an expertly choreographed hand gesture.

Dumbing it way down, in general, spicy sambal and fresh chili, lots of fermented dried shrimp and shrimp sauce, lots of lemon grass and herbs.  Traditional foods of Malaysia sit along side those of India (solid) and China (uhhhh, not so successful and generally sweeter than the original).

Island Malaysian, with its bizarre decor, half dive bar, half restaurant has some seriously authentic and delicious Malaysian dishes.  WARNING:  navigate the menu carefully as many dishes are there to satisfy Western taste.

Straight to it, nasi lemak, the national dish of Malaysia.  In this case rice cooked in coconut milk with ayam rendang (chicken stewed in lemon grass, kafir lime leaves, coconut, and chilis) with boiled egg, cucumber, and sambal.  Personally more accustomed to the Singaporean version (more things on the plate), we add a sambal ikan billis, a grilled whole fish brushed with spicy sambal and deep fried eggplant.  Use your hands.  A pinch of rendang with the rice, some of this and that.  Simple, fun and good.

Need veg?  Kangkung Belacan (water spinach sautéed with fermented, salted shrimp paste) requested with chili and garlic.  Again, simple but packs a flavor punch.

Wanna sample ""Chinese""?  Char kway teow.  Basically wok tossed rice flour noodles AKA chow fun with shrimp and bean sprouts.  Good wok hey flavor.  Slightly sweet.  

Finally, Penang's gift to the culinary world, Asam Laksa, noodles in a beautiful sweet sour fish based soup with a strong backbone of tamarind, lemongrass, garlic, ginger, shallots, herbs and fermented shrimp, garnished with lots of flaked boiled fish, onions, chili, mint, and shrimp paste.  Fiery, complex  and oh so good. 

Be sure to order the barley ice drink.  Simple but puts out the fire from spicier dishes.

Asian service.  Nuff said.

We had our orders ready within minutes and waved to the waiter. He kept acknowledging us but took forever to come. They served us water, which was real prompt and encouraging that it'd be a good meal experience. Finally, the waiter comes and asks us for our order, we give him 3 items. He comes back within a few seconds and tells us their kitchen will be really busy right now and our food will take approximately 30 minutes to come. They had put in the large table order in the kitchen before ours. We got up and left, because we were already behind schedule to leave. But seriously, what kind of business does that?!?! It was 12pm, they should expect the kitchen to be busy!! It's peak lunch hour for goodness sakes! At least they were honest and told us it would take forever for the food to come out. Other places I've been to make it work, but in my opinion, this place indirectly told us to leave or wait an hour for our food.

A curry dish should be slightly thicker, more flavorful and with less mushy vegetables like eggplants. At $13, this dish failed hardcore. How disappointing!

Seafood combination fried rice: this is good but I can't imagine screwing up fried rice. I can make this at home in less than 15 minutes.

Located in a large plaza at 5115 Spring Mountain Road it would be deceitful to suggest this diner had even heard of Island Malaysian Cuisine before exiting another meal just one hour prior, but occasionally deferring to the interests of others it was at the top of a concrete staircase just past eight o'clock that the surprisingly popular restaurant was approached.

On further research apparently the most well-regarded place in town promoting an ""authentic"" Malaysian menu it is to two distinct signs but only viable door that patrons are greeted and with warm welcome inside by a duo of hostesses it was to a four-top at the front of the restaurant our duo was led, the menu of more than one hundred items perused in English alongside one featuring pictures as a few tables of CES conventioneers and locals sat dispersed about the large room.

Decorated in a mix of ethnic items and NFL banners, a TV and Pool Table close to restrooms in back, it was after careful deliberation that a four-part order was crafted, the kitchen expedient with golden pockets of curried chicken arriving a few moments later, though the spice profile was mild while starch overwhelmed protein.

Moving onward to better things, a crisp fold of roti served alongside a small bowl of vibrant red sauce and bone-in chicken, it was next in a comically large $6.50 bowl of boiled rice soup that appetites were entrusted, the texture more heterogeneous than typically associated with congee even before the addition of sliced century egg and chicken, a follow-up of fragrant noodles mostly pleasant despite being liberally oiled and tossed with duck that was almost 50% bone.

A pleasant space to sit and talk, the service timely and noise level not-too-loud, the menu's back features a fair number of sweets and although options trend a bit more pricey than other Chinatown spots the portions are quite generous, a ""Banana Pancake"" textured not unlike the roti more than enough to share with nothing more than caramelized natural flavors used to sweeten it while the ""Chef's Special"" offers several scoops of panna cotta textured coconut milk that reminisces the flavor of chilled Tapioca Pudding.

***Just under $30 each after tax and tip for a meal not-inappropriately large for two - even after substantial eating elsewhere - it would be difficult to call Island Malaysian Cuisine a bargain considering the ingredient quality and uneven execution, but all-in-all a pleasant enough place with a really good staff it may warrant a return visit at a later date in order to sample more things",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,5,3,bDKSCZyVAz7NEjhd0jS5cA

5372732,2011-08-15,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"It has been some time since I had visited this plaza. In between visits, the previous business had been replaced by Island. Looking over the menu and around the restaurant, not too much has changed. 

Wanting to break the monotony of the same cuisine with one of my friends, I had suggested coming here. The large restaurant was steady, but nowhere near full capacity. 

Both of us were hungry enough to get an appetizer to share, and individual entrees. To start, I had ordered the crispy pork intestines for us. They were not quite crispy, but they were melt in your mouth. Unlike most intestine I have had, this one was stuffed with green onions and then fried until the outer layer was golden brown like the skin of a roasted duck. The hoisin style and chili sauce complimented the meat while the pickled diakon and carrots helped cleanse the palate of greasy. I followed this up with the ginger scallion duck with rice. You can get a full order, for $12, but I don't think it comes with rice. Plus no matter how hungry I am, I couldn't eat a family portion on my own. So for $7-$8, it was a good serving. Now this is where Island started to lose me. The dish was rather bland. Normally I don't complain about that in Asian food, but with strong flavors such as ginger and scallions, it should be more prevalent and bold. The pieces of meat were the bonier pieces over the rib cage, so most of my time was spent picking off bits of meat. What I did get off of the bone was dry. My friend got the BBQ pork fried rice and Malaysian coffee. He seemed to be happy with his order. 

The food warrants three stars, but the service made me want to move it to a four. All the servers here were attentive to our water glasses and as soon as food was placed on the counter, it was moving towards a table.

This is a really good find and I can't wait to try out the rest of the Menu.",e2LtHijFAXy4RNTDL5IELw,1,0,5,0wllMbEjzOvCy9g19OSM3w

Nasi lemak, Penang tofu/ young tofu, chicken curry, beef rendang, kue talam, roti prata, fried noodles.

5778700,2011-08-21,1,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"I've never had Malaysian food, so we walked in with no expectations. No clue if this is authentic, but seems like a toned down/less flavorful version of Thai. 

We were pretty overwhelmed by their huge menu of over 130 items. They have a regular menu with descriptions and also a binder with pictures. Kind of cute they have decent pics with little cliparts of whatever kind of animal meat is in it on the side. We would look at the descriptions then look up the pictures by #. This process took a long time and we ended up with #49 captains noodles and #70 Kari ayam.

Captains noodles is mixed flat and thin rice noodles w soy sauce, baby bok choy, chicken and shrimp. It was just ok, pretty bland but shrimp tastes fresh and the fried onions on top went really well somehow. I probably wouldn't order it again because of the blandness. The chicken curry was also bland and fyi they charge $1 for a small bowl of rice (which wasn't mentioned) but you have the choice of regular rice, chicken (cooked in broth) or coconut. I'm not a fan of Asian restaurants that charge for rice, especially not when they don't mention the charge up front. 

Mango sticky rice was good. A little different from Thai places in that they add coconut milk and sesame seeds. 

I'm open to trying this place again, maybe we just chose the wrong things. But this was a really underwhelming first impression. They do accept credit cards now, but not Amex.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,2,0,3,Qt5GoCAqx_wyFcPE8IwfMA

We got 2 noodle dishes: Char Kway Teow and the Basil Noodles. I would not recommend the Char Kway Teow as it didn't have much flavor. The Basil Noodles were good - they had a ton of basily taste...fittingly I guess.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,0,0,3,OK2wjXajmtY3O8ysVoI1hA
5803290,2016-01-10,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"When you first walk in, the first thing you see is the authentic malaysian ringgit..pretty funny....but kinda appealing in some ways. looking at the menu, we reconized familiar menu items like nasi lemak, bak kut teh, mee siam, char keuy tiaw, mee goreng, kari ayam and so on. They gave us a menu with pictures on it just in case we needed to know what to order (pretty funny but appropriate as some items cannot be translated) so we stuck to food that we were craving and knew of despite the vast selection on offer. We ended up ordering the nasi lemak, chicken feet lo mien and pandan chicken. The nasi lemak was quite authentic and cooked well considering some items just cannot be obtained outside of malaysia. The chicken feet lo mein was very tasty and the chicken feet was very well cooked with every bite full of flavours. The pandan chicken was fragrant and crispy ++. Overall a very nice lunch. We followed up the meal with Chendol and some fried banana ice cream. Chendol was almost a 10 out of 10 only thing lacking was it was a little bit on the small size for its price. Overall i would highly recommend this place and I'm sure I will be back again soon :)",iCSv95THuGHsjzHHUjHdkw,0,0,4,5jCy-3Qv1quyGFmKw5lmEA
5847288,2017-07-24,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"Our friend who knows her Malaysian recommended this place.  I've had their food twice now and have greatly enjoyed every dish I've tried to date.  The prices are also really reasonable.

We got - 
Roti Canai - roti with curry sauce
Pangang Ikan - stingray - this was a surprisingly delicious dish!  I'd never tried stingray before but I love that there aren't so many bones, it's mostly cartilage which is way easier to remove.  The texture also reminds me a little of crab.  Highly recommended!
Baby oyster omelette
Kang Kung Belacan - hollow vegetables with shrimp paste - pungent, but yum!
Coconut rice

For dessert we got their peanut pancake & durian w/ sticky rice.  I had never had durian before.  It's not fresh, it's canned, but was better than I expected.  The peanut pancake was good, but the peanuts were slightly rancid.  I'm not deducting a star though because everything else was so good and I don't think there's any other restaurant like this in Las Vegas.

What's really awesome is that they have photos of every item on the menu.  So if you're not sure of the names, there's always a photo reference :)  Definitely recommended!",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,0,0,5,K2jAtNxvAv-E_aLb9v2Big

I found out about them when I saw them on the news earlier in the day. And decided hmm we should check that place out. I am so glad we did. My 3 year old is super hard to keep satisfied (as any other toddler) so we bought him food before we got there, and I'm glad we did cause when we walked in and seated he went straight to the mini pool table we were seated next to and entertained himself while we ate.we found our new restaurant. It's a mixture of Indian, Thai, and a few other Asian dishes. This place I feel is better than Archi's food and price wise.",WfsCMw4EiRcIX2FTANq9dg,1,0,5,9K3UIWgT6RIjWrFbGEYHBw

I came twice consecutive lunch when visiting Vegas. Love it !

Roti Canai = Great
Rojak = Very good (could taste and smell the ""shrimpy"" sauce"")
Curry Puff = Great, very authentic
Cha Keow Tiao = Great, we ate 3 plates...
Fried Rice = Good
Sambal Sotong = Great
Penang Laksa = Very good
Beef Rendang = Great, taste like truly Malaysian/Indonesian rendang",9gXr360kwqpT0uAOk5OoFA,1,0,4,NQShjf2viPxqoOQy8yTuKw

The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :).

5916963,2011-11-28,0,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"totally worth it.  came in here twice in four days.. which says a lot given all the good food available in LV. 

Some hits and misses, but i cant say much about the misses because this is a Singaporean's take, and the cuisine can differ some across the causeway. Also, the restaurant IS called island Malaysian..

also, for those wondering about its similarities to Penang (the restaurant chain)-- the waitress said that it used to be a Penang chain but then other people bought it out.. so i guess the decor and the recipes via the cooks were retained? 

but: 

1) sambal kangkong-- good ratio of leaves vs stems. sambal sauce was a little too thin for my liking, but i think it's a Malaysian thing. 

2) Char Kuay Tiao: Delicious to the max!! fried soft white noodles with fresh prawns and bean sprouts.. hmmm. they dont skimp on the bean sprouts either! but seriously, what is it with LV and awesomely fresh bean sprouts?! Kinh Do served up some super bean sprouts too. Our table of 7 inhaled 3 servings. 

3) Roti Canai: We had 4 servings.  crispy and chewy dough.. Curry was spot on authentic. Enough said. 

4) Hainanese chicken was meh.. at least they stuffed the bottom with fresh cucumber slices

5) mee goreng was pretty good.. very malaysian styled though, ie sweet, a tad mushy, and with fried dough pieces in it

6) house-made toufu was pretty sweet!  At this point we were so stuffed, but you could definitely taste and feel that the toufu was artisan-made and not from a factory. 

7) Barley drink-- great because it was tasty and not too sweet (critical, since other places would pour on the sugar syrup and then dilute the whole thing) but personally, ratio of barley grains to liquid in the glass was a tad off. 

8) ice kacang!! had it during our first meal there.  the waitress was so sweet.. I asked if it was possible to have more attap chee pieces cuz when i was young, my sis and i would fight perpetually over it, and she laughed and said that she'll put 5 pieces in it-- one for every person at our table! that's great service. 

I swear we ate several other dishes, but at this point in time.. my mind is still fixated on the roti canai and char kuay tiao.. LOL

anyone craving straits cuisine-- GO!!!",NwJVKTC6gbTG1pz2Wdag8g,1,0,4,Pd6AIyjzp-lQ0y2azhFlDQ
5974047,2013-03-02,1,X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ,"The roti canai and char kway teow were great. The Hokkien char mee was OK but if I ordered it again, I'd ask for more spice. We also got a fresh coconut to slurp and munch on.

The staff was friendly and it was easy to get refills and order additional dishes (mmm satay) without feeling compelled to rush through dinner. We were dining a bit late on a Friday and there was no wait.

When dinner was over the check came and it was such a cheap meal for a couple gluttons. We were transported to Malaysia, for the length of our meal, for much less than a plane ticket.",6toEhpmJxknHFKBw5u3xWQ,3,1,4,IvUPHDmqxQr0-lknBqzc9Q
