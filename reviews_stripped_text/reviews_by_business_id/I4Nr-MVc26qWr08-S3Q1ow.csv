I'm not a huge fan of New York New York hotel/casino but the teenagers wanted to walk around so we split up and my husband an I went wandering around. I was hungry BUT we had dinner reservations later on and I didn't want to spoil my appetite. 

I just wanted something quick, not huge or anything. My husband pointed out this place and I said sure because I do love sandwiches! We ordered the ham and Colby Jack sandwich and honestly it was delicious. We actually only ordered one and it was big enough for the both of us. It honestly really tasted good.I believe they shave the meat right there and everything tasted fresh, the bread was really good and I was genuinely pleasantly surprised.

Worst sandwiches i have ever had, poor excuse for a vegas sandwich shop... how you guys are in business is a mystery.

I ask for au jus...""o we dont have it sorry, use mayonnaise"". ""First off i don't like mayonnaise, second i see the beef in a smoker right there what do you guys do with the juice, throw it away??"" ""Yes we do"". ""So i tell them look i have never heard of a sandwich shop selling beef brisket without au jus (the freaking sandwich comes with liquid dumbass) this is to dry to eat i would like to order something else"".

Went late afternoon after playing in the casino and before needing to head to the evening's show. Line moves quickly and there was plenty of seating available. Imagine this place could be packed at the 1am-3am munchies hours.
 
Really pigged out with a Vinnie's Deluxe, chips, matzo ball soup and a soda!! - It turned out to be my only real meal of the day. The sandwich was flavorful and stuffed to the max with pastrami, brisket and turkey. Freshly sliced as you watched them assemble the piles of meat. Will pass on the soup next time, not much to rave about there - maybe do the potato salad next time instead. Prices have increased over the years so a sandwich was more than $10 but still a great value for the sandwich. The only negative price wise was $3.50 for a bottled soda - not sure how I missed seeing that!

It's good to see them slice the meat when you order it rather than other restaurants that preslice and just assemble the sandwich when you order.

This time our bread was dry, there were four thin slices of pastrami folded over to appear like it was a fat sandwich, but when opened up, it was clear that the paper-thin meat was folded over and bulked up in the middle of the bread just disguising the fact that there was close to no filler, the meat only fit in the middle of the sandwich (so enough meat for 1/4 sandwich), which meant we paid $9 for a sandwich that was all dry bread and no meat. We also got a chicken salad sandwich. They used to serve 3/4 cup of chicken salad on a sandwich. Now they used an ice cream scoop so there was enough chicken salad for 1 slice of dry bread.

But it doesn't stop there....there brisket, turkey, all of the meats are very good. Pickles, mustards, the whole nine yards. 

One additional not is that they now are open during breakfast hours, with the full menu available. Nice. They also have a $5.95 deal for either bacon, egg, cheese croissant or pastrami, egg bagel coupled with a large coffee. Very good deal and my croissant was Huge! 

Really like this place....especially when you compare to areas nearby. $10 for an OK crepe, $6.00 for a so-so slice of pizza, etc.... Good food for good value.",D9fzp6AaOpofZK5JdU8npg,2,1,5,RNpGhsoyKexWGQR7_H6YZQ

We ordered three items from the menu and a couple drinks. The first was the Italian Stallion, which was very good and super filling. The second was the Greenberg's Ruben, which had just as filling and had the right balance of sauerkraut, cheese, and pastrami on delicious fresh rye bread.

-Chicken Noodle Soup (they keep the egg noodles and soup separate to prevent mooshy noodles, WOOHOO!)

-Matzoh Ball Soup (same chicken soup but with a fluffy matzoh ball, could be hotter, but it's tasty)

-Beef & Cheddar Melt (they loaded it up with meat and cheese on both buns and toast them, and then you tell them what veggies you'd like, I say EVERYTHING)

-Turkey Toaster with added Bacon (much better than their Club)

-Smoked Ham & Colby Jack Cheese (it's a bit salty, but the green chilies make this sandwich good, get this with potato salad to cut the salt factor)

-Classic Turkey Club (your average club, it's hefty and filling)

-Sam & Emma's (even more hefty and filling, lots of meat, mmmmm meat...)

-New York Sky High (similar to Sam & Emma's, meaty, ask for cole slaw on the side so your sandwich doesn't get soggy)


The Bad:

Well there really isn't anything bad, they sometimes run out of a certain type of meat though.  (hence the 4 stars, but it really should be 4.5)

Also, I recommend getting the potato salad versus chips because they give you the single serve Lay's Potato Chip bags and that's just full of more salt, just saying.  So, happy eatings everyone!!",sPksYz22qDXP2Zh475Pi1g,6,5,4,vgCyYiCDzA_OvYbDLHAo3Q

I've always been a fan of pastrami, and we shared a fairly large New Yorker special sandwich with pastrami, corned beef and cole slaw. To be honest, I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw, but I really fell in love with the hot, greasy and succulent mattress of meats, sandwiched by warm and savory rye bread. The star of the show, of course, was still the matzo ball soup, as the giant ball literally melted in your mouth, soaked to the brim with the broth. The overall ambiance is cool, kinda cheesy with NY decors, but I dug the expired meters placed outside each of the 'outdoor' tables.

After walking around I wasn't in the mood to sit and be waited on in a restaurant, I didn't want greasy old flat pizza nor a hot dog located next door. 

After reading the menu on the wall this place sounded like it would do. I ordered the turkey toasted on wheat slice bread with cheese and all the standard samage produce, w/o mayo. The order taker told the sandwich maker the order. I watched as he was assembling the sandwich and saw him put a huge heeping blob of mayo on the bread. I went back and told the order taker that I asked for no mayo. He turned around and told the guy making the sandwich. The guy making the sandwich got a little of an attitude with the order taker, threw the sandwich away and started a new one. I feel bad to see food wasted. 

After a few minutes the sandwich went through the toaster and was dressed with the produce, wrapped up and given to me. I took our sandwiches and drinks to the other counter to pay. 

Price was close to $27. For two sandwiches and two teas. $9.25 each sandwich and $2.95 per each bottle of tea. Way over price for a small sandwich with no side. 

Sorry no pics on this one I was so hungry I forgot to pull the camera out before devouring it. In the end it was good and hit the spot but over priced.",l2uNHbNrt6dmW7PNklJRdg,1,1,3,X1q7ht0ZZVmovyOgMWxDkw

2470342,2010-12-09,17,I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow,"OMG!  Greenberg's serves up some of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had.  If you're in Las Vegas and you love a mountain of New York style hot, freshly shaved, thin sliced meat on fresh bread of your choice you owe yourself a visit to Greenberg's Deli on the casino level of the New York, New York Hotel and Casino.

My friends are thoughtful.  On the day prior to running the half marathon I had a fairly late pasta lunch and decided to skip dinner in preparation for the morning's race.  My race morning ritual is pretty simple.  One hour before the race I eat a banana or a bagel and I drink a pint of Cytomax to prepare my body for the onslaught ahead.  Cytomax is a fluid replacement liquid that has added vitamins to fuel the body and prolong cramping.

Both of my friends were running in their first half marathon, and neither had any set routine for nutrition on the day prior to the race nor on race morning.  They visited Greenberg's on the night prior to the race, and in thinking I was starving in my hotel room they brought back for me a huge deli sandwich with a side of potato salad and a pickle with a bottle of Gatorade.  The time was 10 PM and the race was just 9 hours away.  With no refrigeration in the hotel room, and two overstuffed roommates I was left with no choice but to eat the darn sandwich and the sides.

Knowing my love for meat they brought back a Twin Bill consisting of a mountain of hot pastrami and corned beef with just a slight smear of mustard on wheat bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=u6ig5pKlEqhgsmAvUNWrkA).  I swear the take out box weighed in at more than a pound with the thick pile of meat taking up most of that weight.  The sandwich was incredible.  The meats were nicely marbled, flavorful and moist and this was easily one of the best deli sandwiches I've had outside of New York City.  It was even better than Miller's East West Deli in San Francisco, and I love Miller's.  The big crunchy pickle was outstanding as well with just the right amount of sour to it.  The potato salad was basically big chunks of unpeeled potatoes, lots of mayo and just a touch of dill.  It took me nearly an hour to finish the sandwich, and I knew I was in trouble for the next morning.

Sure enough, the big sandwich came back to haunt me at mile 10 during the half marathon the next morning.  Luckily I run for fun, and I didn't really care that I finished 12 minutes later thanks to 2 pit stops I was forced to make.

I was so satisfied with the sandwich that I made my own visit to the deli the next night to order another.  This time I had the New York Skyhigh (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=QtjcS6CWBgSaD01Zry3urg) which is corned beef, pastrami, turkey, cole slaw and thousand island dressing on bread of choice.  I even tried their authentic chocolate New York egg cream which is simply milk, Hershey's chocolate syrup and carbonated water hand mixed and machine whirled to create a thick layer of froth on top.  Here it was without the froth (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=ekkd6tNYWjCU9Z-oXH3_4Q) as I had already sucked it up.  I loved this sandwich just as much as the Twin Bill and the drink?  Well, that was like drinking chocolate milk with fizz!

Surprisingly none of the supporters were flocking to any of the eateries in the area that's meant to evoke Greenwich Village right next to the slots. With nostalgic memories of Katz's Deli, we ambled our way into the faux-deli to see a condensed menu more akin to a California sandwich shop. In other words, this ain't Katz.

No thick slices of East Coast-style pastrami and corned beef to be found here. What I had was the $10.75 Corned Beef Sandwich on challah with lettuce, tomato and mayo (photo: http://bit.ly/1Toew2b). Yes, just call me Annie Hall. It was large enough but the meat slices were paper-thin, just not my preference when it comes to corned beef. It kept falling apart on me especially when the Hillary war chant came nearer. Symbolic? Perhaps. Jamie went for the $10.95 Greenberg's Reuben which was drippy with Russian dressing.

Sandwiches for lunch and dinner are also a winner. Enjoyed my turkey club triple decker. On Another trip, I chose the tuna salad in eye and was not disappointed. The tuna had a tad too much mayo, but the toasted rye soaked it up deliciously! Hubby's only complaint about the corned beef Reuben was that it could've used a bit more sauerkraut.",dmx5Aryrq50rZ4Q22DcZ_w,0,0,4,wHuMSo4eqjycNMWpXcV4Tg

If I could imagine being back in NYC and eating at a NY deli, this would be the closest to that NYC deliciousness out west. My aunt had the beef and cheddar melt on focaccia. The bread smelled amazing and looked like it could actually control the piles of beef and perfect amount of cheddar in this sandwich. The bread almost succeeded, but it was so delicious that almost was good enough. The beef (I got a sample from the deli man)was okay , but only because my family made them make it less rare (NNNOOOOOO!). I bet you it is amazing without the extra cooking. I tried the pastrami and my world was rocked. It was equally as great as Carnegie Deli's pastrami at the Mirage, and the size of this sandwich was larger than my head! At first my family was going to eat only a half. Oops. The entire sandwich was gone in moments.

The best part of this meal according to my aunt? The chicken noodle soup. I see all the reviews mention this soup. Since I cannot have it, I don't know exactly what it tastes like, but my aunt said it was gorgeous, and that is a fantastic compliment. She said that it is the best chicken noodle soup she had ever had (which is blasphemy coming from her household), and she said it reminds her of the chicken noodle soup she always wanted when she was sick because one minute after eating it you start to feel better immediately. The soup tasted like home and warmed her up for our cold walk up and down the strip. She did not stop talking about said soup for over a few hours, and she still mentions this soup a week or two after she left. So if you don't feel well or have a wicked headache or just feel like a NY deli comfort food moment?

No wafting smells of food vendors on the streets intermingled with urine? C'mon, this ain't legit New York!). But still, but still.... you can imagine being there. And that was good.

Depending on the time and day, inside can get crazy busy and I'm used to that, so it doesn't bother me if I end up getting my order to-go or not. The line can get long, but it  moves fairly quick. 

There are 3 different sandwiches on the menu I like, so I am glad that they have kept them over the years. Problem is the prices and consistency of the food has changed. I used to pay $8.95 for a sandwich that currently costs $12.95 and isn't as big as it was before. That or the amount of meats are off. For example when I get a sandwich that has 3 different types of meat on it, they put a thin layer of pastrami on the bottom and then a huge amount of turkey. I post pictures each visit and you can clearly see how they are not consistent with amount of meat they put on each sandwich. When I told the guy working this last visit what type of sandwich I wanted on a French roll, he said that he wouldn't recommend that type of bread with that sandwich. I explained that I had ordered it many times before on that type of bread and would prefer it please. He made it the way I ordered it and the sandwich came out tasting great! The meat had good flavor and it was tender and juicy and it's still carved in front of you. I still give 4 stars even with the meat portions being off because the meat here is excellent. I only wish that if they are going to raise the prices, that they not put less meat on the sandwiches as well coleslaw or at least when they do pile the sandwiches high they should put equal amounts of each meat.

Ever since I had my first Greenberg's sandwich in 2006, I've needed to make my way to the far back corner of New York, New York to get my fix whenever I'm Las Vegas. I've had the corned beef, the pastrami, and most recently tried a combo of corned beef and brisket. All were huge, delicious, and really nice and fresh! Every single time I've been there, I've also had the potato salad, which is like no other potato salad I've had anywhere else. It is tasty, almost light (with not too much creamy stuff--which I think might be sour cream and not mayonnaise), and has a nice dill flavoring.

Greenberg's sandwiches are all made to order when you request them. Once you've stated your choice of bread (I love the marble rye) and meat, the guys behind the counter actually grab a slab of your protein choice and slice it up right in front of you. If you're lucky, they've sliced a little extra, which gets piled on the plate beside your sandwich along with a dill pickle. You'll also get to choose if you'd like some brown deli mustard. Since the restaurant is cafeteria style, you can then select your chips, dessert, drink (even wine!), and condiments before getting into line to pay. There are a few booths inside the deli, and ""open air"" tables outside the deli walls (but still inside the casino) in a little city street style setting. It's fun setting and a great meal.",88efmQyULvBHe6Y6D-8R4g,4,4,5,G8sYGas_0DYPppJ1jLKQlw

Stopped by for lunch because we wanted a sandwich from somewhere we couldn't go to back home. The two sandwich joints in the area were 'wichcraft and Greenberg's. Since there's a 'wichcraft in San Francisco (and the ratings weren't that good for the Vegas location), we ended up at Greenberg's. 

Service:
- the first thing you'll notice here is how EFFING SLOW they are!!!!! Bring a book or two, you might be able to finish one while you're waiting!
- two of the older ladies that work here could be replaced with someone more competent
- the scooper sits in the sink until they grab it to put ice in your cup. Just seems a bit dirty to me
- not all the service is bad tho, the guys that take your order and make the sandwiches were pretty cool 

Food:
- Beef Brisket on Wheat - VERY good! a lot better than Katz's in NY. Slices were thinner than usual and meat was really tender and easy to bite  through
- Beef and Cheddar Melt - VERY good! This thing was huge! I was full after eating 1/2 of this
- Potato Salad - good. nothing too special tho
- Chips - just a tiny bag of Lay's, but they have other chips you can buy if you want
- Chicken Noodle Soup - good. like the potato salad, it's nothing too special. Like a can of chicken noodle soup, but fresh and hopefully better quality ingredients
- Pickles - good. the last NY deli I ate at is Katz's, and they give you two different types of pickles. I didn't like either one of 'em, but this was pretty good

Misc:
- There's a good amount of tables in the designated dining area next door, but there are also a few tables just outside that are pretty cool w/ parking meters and fire hydrants close by some of them.",sm6AzP6HSQhI9j9V_oiPWA,0,0,4,ZH8oPFYKN0sfnQby2QoErg

Hot and fresh made meats including pastrami, corned beef and turkey, made to order on a selection of freshly baked breads, with house made mustard and dill pickle on the side. 

I had the pastrami sandwich and potato salad. Fresh ingredients, the bread tastes amazing, and the pastrami so delicious and piled so high that it's hard to figure out how to eat it! So yummy, and the potato salad is perfect with the sandwich.

Right in the middle of the ""Village Eateries"" you can find Greenberg's Deli. We walked in and encountered no line on a Friday afternoon in February. The help behind the counter was friendly and helpful and the sandwiches didn't take very long to prepare.

I couldn't resist the temptation to sample their foot long hot dog ($3.95) which came with potato salad. I also ordered a cup of Matzah ball soup ($3.50). My lovely wife opted for the Reuben sandwich (a whopping $9.50). A bottle of water ($2.50) and two draft Peronis ($5.25 apiece) rounded out the order. We sat ""outside"" on the sidewalk and dug in. The Reuben was monstrous with corned beef and sauerkraut spilling out beyond the edges of the insufficiently large slices of rye. I glanced down at the 12"" of wiener and large warm balls on my plate and was momentarily jealous of this impressive package.

Ref: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow?select=lqw28h3QHm0LbOMuhv7lMw

I idly wondered how their ""Italian Stallion"" sandwich measured up. The jealousy didn't last for long. The Matzah ball soup lacked the ""schmaltzy"" flavor I was expecting and the dog was merely a very long but otherwise average dog. The Reuben was a bit better and possessed the girth the dog lacked. I did like their potato salad. The Peroni (served in an under-sized plastic cup) was cold and crisp and altogether unremarkable.

Without considering the price tag, this was quite a pleasant (although completely forgettable) three-star experience. However, the bill came to $32.27 and with it came raised expectations. The NYNY website states that the average check comes to $8-9 per person. Obviously, this is a figure that doesn't include alcohol. Give me a break!

Having gotten a sandwich here last year after indulging in more than a few adult beverages, I thought my perception was skewed. This time around, I was completely sober when enjoying my sandwich.

4655046,2015-06-30,8,I4Nr-MVc26qWr08-S3Q1ow,"Greenberg's Deli brings back that loving feeling that's been gone gone gone. Born and raised in the New York metropolitan area I grew up with the loving feeling of dining in delis that serve delicacies from kasha varnishes to Ruben sandwiches. After moving to Las Vegas there has been far less New York delis to enjoy the these delicacies that I love. I am surprised that it took my brother and I over 15 years to try Greenberg's Deli. Better late than never. 

   It is appropriate that Greenberg's Deli sits inside New York - New York within a Disneyfied Greenwich Village. Both casino and Deli execute such a commendable job with the theme and attention to detail, that a unique dining experience is guaranteed. The New York City motif is so realistic that you expect to hear a taxi careening down the faux Greenwich Village Street, and instead overhear a runaway Manhattan Rollercoaster taxi above with screaming riders. 

   When you step off the Greenwich Village Street into Greenberg's Deli, up above on the wall is  the menu. It advertises the New York City Deli icons including the Ruben, corn beef, and pastrami. Disappointedly yet totally expected Kashe varnishes and kinishes were missing. However, there on the board was an egg salad sandwich. I LOVE egg salad sandwiches. They are not the easiest sandwich to find in Las Vegas and especially on the Strip. A few years past, I really enjoyed the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich until they got rid of it. The egg salad sandwich is relatively inexpensive for the Las Vegas Strip where a Subway sandwich could cost over $8. I would never want to eat an egg salad sandwich by itself. I'd add a prepackaged potato salad for $1.50 and a fountain Pepsi for a couple of dollars more that came out to $13 and change. 

  Before I could enjoy the food I had to pay. This is a two line process. On line 1, I ordered and picked up the sandwich with the prepackaged potato salad and fountain Pepsi before bringing my tray to line 2 to pay. I carried the tray outside to the Greenwich Village Street where the tables are. 

  The egg salad sandwich brought back this loving feeling of enjoying delicious food in a New York deli. They served it on between two slices of rye bread (I could of had sourdough). Complimenting the overflowing egg salad that required a fork to savour every bite was onions, tomato, and lettuce. The potato salad was nothing extraordinary. Perhaps, the next time I visit I may enjoy the sandwich with hard to find Wise potato chips or go nearby upstairs to Coney Island to pick up Nathan's crinkley cut fries. 

   Sitting in the Greenwich Village Street amplified this New York state of mind that in reality is a New York - New York state of mind. The sights and sounds of the casino is exciting. Up above the runaway New York Express roller coaster taxi careened on the tracks, the Times Square Dueling Piano players rocked the classics across Greenwich Village. Greenberg's Deli with the New York - New York Greenwich Village is the marriage of a Las Vegas and New York deli dining experience that brings back a loving feeling that had been gone gone gone.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,9,4,gWdLwWMnWVOBEREWPeUREg

People need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.

Folks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like.

They didn't expect to get tips for their service. It was kind of refreshing because Vegas will definitely nickel and dime you till you're broke.

We ordered a couple sandwiches to go, and they looked damn good.  Prices seem high at first, but frankly, it is the Strip, and well, it's not like sandwiches are any cheaper in a real NYC deli.  

We'd already had a couple nice dinners on our stay, and well, it was nice to have something that wasn't really pricey or greasy diner food.  And well, the sandwich was so good that I immediately walked her over to the Bellagio, and proposed in front of the fountains.

Ok, I was going to propose anyway, and didn't eat the sandwich until later (they were for the plane), but it makes a good story.  The real story is that the sandwich was still pretty damn good after a few hours, although it would've been better fresh.  

Was it as good as getting a sandwich at a real NYC deli?  No, but if you want the real thing, you pretty much are resigned to flying to New York or maybe some retirement communities in Florida.  Outside of that, the meat and toppings were quality.  Fresh bread would've been better, but they did at least ship in a good brand.

The decor is true to what you would find in a deli in New York and the seating outside of the restaurant would make you think that you are actually in NYC.

The menu gives you the choice of soup/salad, toasted sandwiches or cold sandwiches. To start you have to choose what kind of bread you want. You have the choice of rye, Reuben, white or wheat bread to name a few.
I ordered Vinny's Deluxe on wheat bread, and it is a cold sandwich with roast beef, pastrami, turkey, muenster, deli mustard and mayo.
The sandwich was delicious. The meat is freshly cut in front of you as you wait and bread was fresh.
Also, I have to say that I was surprised by how big the sandwich was. My advice is to share the sandwich if you can because it is very filling. In addition to the sandwich I also ordered a house salad as a side.
Service was just OK. The person who rang us up was not very friendly and frankly seemed to be anxious to go home. The sandwich itself was about $13 but I had some left overs as I wasn't able to eat it all.

Stopped here for lunch.  They are located in the ""village eatery"" section of NYNY hotel/casino.  Ordered a corned beef sandwich on rye with side of potato salad, and a chocolate egg cream.  The sandwich was okay, the amount of corned beef was fairly good, although nothing to write home about.  Fairly tender, with a few bites of scattered ""chewy"" spots that weren't too bad.  Fairly flavorful, maybe a bit dry. Again, if you're like me and grew up eating fabulous ""real"" deli food, you won't be too impressed.  This sandwich will give you a little feeling of ""home"", especially if you've lived in Vegas for years and are yearning for a good corned beef sandwich and would do anything to have one, even a sub-standard version.  

The potato salad was good.  Nothing aMAYzing but better than grocery store deli stuff.  The egg cream was okay, nice chocolate flavor. 

Prices are high, as they are anywhere in a strip eaterie.  No getting around that.  The solution:  split the sandwich, it was definitely large enough for two people.  Splitting stuff is the only way to make it easier on your wallet during a Vegas vacay!

I ordered a regular toasted turkey sandwich and hubby had the club, both on wheat bread. We shared a water, total came out to about $25, so pricey, but delicious. 

There is very limited seating right inside the shop, but there is plenty of seating right outside in the little ""street"" area.

I was staying at the Excalibur last week and decided to grab a bite at NY NY and found Greenbergs, right behind the times square bar. It didn't have a huge line so we decided to get two NY sky rises a lemonade and potato salad. Fantastic!!!!! The bread was nicely toasted, the meats were so fresh and hot, the coleslaw was mild but gave a great crunch, and the thousand island brought the whole sandwich together. Potato salad was prepackaged but still good. Lemonade, no so much. 

Only one complaint, the ordering system is a bit confused, especially if there are multiple people waiting for the samething. I would use a ticket system, personally. Workers are rather....charmless. 

Loads of places to sit around. We paid about 10 for each sky rise, 1.75$ for the potato salad (that's right), and about 3 for the lemonade. So decent prices for something this good. This is a great place to have a decent lunch and will carry you to dinner or beyond.

Grab a tray and get in line at one end, order, pick up your sandwich and pay at the other end where you exit the line. I decided to get a simple Reuben ($10.95) with pastrami on rye with the standard fixings of swiss cheese, sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. Similar to what you can expect in deli's in NY the meat for the sandwich is sliced fresh right in front of you. Looking at this process I thought that I would be standing in line for a long time but the person behind the counter worked fast and kept the line moving at a steady pace.

The sandwich itself is not very big but could be considered to be a decent lunch sized portion. It has a decent amount of meat but its not like its piled sky high. What it has going for itself is the taste which is really good. Definitely among the best that I've had. The rye bread is toasted perfectly. The pastrami is of high quality and its taste is not eclipsed by the sauerkraut and thousand island dressing but shines through in each bite. It's price is also right considering that it is on the strip in a Casino.

Very little seating inside of the deli, but there are many (I repeat, many) tables outside on the ""street"" area, so don't fret.

My sister and I both ordered the tuna salad, hers on wheat and mine on ciabatta. The tuna itself was quite tasty; however, the untoasted bread kind of detracted from the flavor. Both sandwiches were served with a deli-style pickle, which was a great touch. My sister also ordered the matzo ball soup, which was pretty OK.

The deli is set-up like an assembly line so do not worry if the line looks long - it moves very quickly. Luckily, I came in at a non-peak time (~3PM) so I was in and out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Vinnie's Deluxe sandwich which was enough to fill me for lunch and dinner. It consisted of their famous pastrami, corned beef, and turkey. All the meats are sliced freshly for you when you order, and you have choice of bread (highly recommend their rye). The sandwich was extremely flavorful and competes well with any of the top delicatessens in New York. The sandwich only comes with mayo, so I recommend adding in some complimentary mustard to give it an extra kick. 

[SERVICE]: Self-seating, traditional delicatessen-esque so no real service. Staff was friendly and gave me great recommendations on how to maximize the flavor of the meats! 

[ATMOSPHERE]: Spacious deli with plenty of space for customers to slide trays down the assembly line. The restaurant really tried to replicate the feel of their other restaurants despite not having a true dining area (only a few tables located within the deli, but plenty of seating outside).

[TIPS]: COME HERE INSTEAD OF EARL OF SANDWICH. It's worth the extra $3 and you'll be 2x as full. Go between 2-4PM to avoid the line. If you're not that hungry, the sandwich will be too much for you, so split with a friend :)",CuwqBgIFPzct-Xx9qnp_1g,5,1,4,Q-5uthojAHEEJOP-rkTqeg
