The room is absolutely gorgeous and the patio has a breathtaking view. It's honestly one of those places where there isn't a bad seat. 

Service is phenomenal. Everyone is a VIP. Ladies, they have little chairs for your designer bags.

The white chocolate and orange french toast was wonderful!  It's texture is more of a cinnamon bun than a classic french toast, which I loved.  The flavors meld together very well.  We also had the tableau breakfast.  The pastry basket was delicious and did not need any of the yummy jams or butters. Chicken sausage was also delicious.  Too bad we were so full from all the food or else we would have gotten the souffle.  

Will definitely come back for brunch here the next time I'm in town.  Am dropping my old favorite (Bouchon) off of the list because service and food has really declined over there.",XN3Hx6Nu1NWYOhpN8SYv1g,0,0,4,EVb8DN0MFsu8QXuXFBnU-w

The hosts advised us to wait a couple of minutes (we waited about 10). We sat down and the host gives me this mini chair to put my bag. I thought that was uberly cute! The table setting was nice and the server too. The atmosphere and the vibe- I'll give it a 5/5. 

Food:
My friend ordered the Spanish omelette and I ordered an item that was off the menu. I tried my friend's omelette and the Spanish omelette was rly good! It had a very interesting taste to it. I had a French toast and that was rly good too! The only reason I give a star down is because of the portion. The portion is a little small (maybe bc it's fine dining?).

He didn't serve the standard bread, and when asked, he was defensive about it, saying that it's because we didn't order a lunch item. Well, I don't see an additional page at the end of the menu, and I'm not sure what else you'd consider a duck entree (not to mention that both plates were ordered from the entree section).  Before we left, he even came over and checked how much tip we'd left him!  I thought we were at Wynn, not some ""hole in the wall"" place?!

The duck entree and the white chocolate orange French toast were tasty, but definitely nothing out of the ordinary or worthy of their prices. The duck was a bit dry, but thankfully the egg was nice and moist, which masked some of the dryness underneath.  And, like one of the other reviewer mentioned, our taste buds didn't quite pick up the white chocolate part.  Maybe we were spoiled coming from NYC. Meh.

Service was excellent, the wine list was very good and had several excellent and rare half bottles. My Kobe burger was competent, not memorable.

101295,2015-01-19,3,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Womp, womp. Just decent..

I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time now and was excited to finally try it. Came in about ten minutes after they just opened for breakfast on a Sunday with no reservations. We were easily accommodated as we were one of the first few there. Tip: if you do go later in the am, I recommend making reservations. By the time we were done eating, the restaurant was a lot more full.

We were fortunate enough to get seated with one of the best views in the conservatory. The lighting is beautiful, decor-very clean and pristine, and the view of the outdoor pool alongside cabanas makes you feel like you're not in Vegas. When the weather permits, I'm sure the outdoor area would be ideal.

Ordered the Tableau breakfast, duck hash & eggs, and white chocolate orange fresh toast. Make sure if you order the Tableau breakfast to add your option of juice, coffee, or tea because our server never brought it up to us until we told her. Tip: there's a vegetarian menu for those who need it. 

Everyone received bite sized strawberry donuts compliments of the chef-nice touch. A pastry basket accompanies the Tableau breakfast that came with two palmiers, two blueberry muffins, and two pineapple pastries. They were okay. I, personally, ordered the duck hash & eggs and my favorite part about it was probably the pastry layer on the bottom. There was ample amount of duck, potatoes, topped with scrambled eggs and roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. Portion size is just right but I still did not finish mine as I found it too gamey and overwhelming to my palate after eating half of it. Also, I didn't taste much tomato flavor in the hollandaise sauce. Sorry! I know a lot of people on here raved about it but I guess it just didn't cater to my taste buds. The white chocolate orange french toast garnished with blueberries and orange slices was good but the white chocolate was too subtle that it tasted more like orange. 

Overall, this place is just alright. Our initial server was not the friendliest and she seemed annoyed by our indecisiveness. Food was ok and during our time here, we felt very uptight and as if we needed to be on our best behaviors. Just not my cup of tea. I'd return only if someone I knew really wanted to check it out.",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,3,2,3,Dat-XftleKsiX9tGEu5UfQ

My family enjoyed a delightful brunch here, and I really can't recommend it enough.  The menu was varied and wide ranging, truly a comprehensive list that everyone could enjoy.  The wine/champagne was not as reasonably priced as I would like, but given the price and quality of the food... there are absolutely no complaints here.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes, and smoke salmon dishes were quite good.  The NY steak sandwich was so so.  

If you must entertain a large party, this really is the place to do it.  All your guests will feel like they just had a lavish brunch; however, your wallet will thank you (surprising given its location in the Wynn).

For all the praise, one might wonder, ""Why only four stars then?""  Well, I dunno how to say this... purse stands.  There are friggin' stands for your purses!  A little stand the waiter brings over, so your purse can rest upon it.

229161,2008-11-02,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Dinner at Tableau http://thesoloreviewer.blogspot.com/

I dined at Tableau twice during my recent trip to Las Vegas, once for breakfast and once for dinner, and to be honest I don't know why I decided to go here for dinner but I was glad I did. Tableau doesn't often get talked about past breakfast which is why I was intrigued to dine here for dinner. Upon arrival I was seated in there main dining room which is a very small and intimate dining room. The windows were wide open and the nice nightly breeze was coming in. Once seated the bread came. This was much different from the ordinary bread basket. It featured a nice dinner roll in a small little pot. Its your ordinary dinner roll but reminded much of the ones we use to have at dinner growing up!

I went with the tasting menu but had to stop half way because just like Le Cirque the portions are way to big which would be the only downfall in this restaurant even though some may like the large portions I'm a little guy and can only hold so much before I have to throw in the flag. The amuse was fried Cod, much like Bouchon Bistros Beignets de Brandade de Morue, over a bed of balsamic seasoned spinach. I found it to be much better than Bouchons version. It was full of Cod which was the ingredient that stood out the most because had a nice light texture that I found to be a nice little starter and the balsamic added a nice rich dark complex of sweetness to it!

The first dish was the dish everyone was talking about. The Dungeness Crab Ravioli which featured a lemon emulsion flavor. WOW this dish was FULL of fresh and perfectly cooked Crab with a Delicious burst of lemon flavor. I loved the dish and I can see why everyone talks about it. 

Next up was the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras with glazed black mission figs, upland cress salad and red currant gastric. Now the foie gras was on top of a piece of toast that at first I found to be unnecessary but I put a little foie gras and fig on top just to try it out and It was perfect! I love figs and these were sublime. It doesn't get any better than Hudson Valley foie gras either! The red currant added a nice sweet jelly type taste to the figs. Overall a great dish with flavors that paired very well with each other.

Next was the Grilled Free Range Duck Breast with sweet potato-pecan hash, stewed stone fruits, and wild flower honey just. This was my first time having duck. It was cooked medium and had a good texture without being to gamy. I LOVE sweet potato's and found the hash to be absolutely delish! The stone fruits and honey just added just amount of sweetness to the duck and the flavors all popped out and you could taste each and everyone of them in every bite! But as you can tell this is no tasting menu sized portion which left me to stop here. The portions are large for a tasting menu.

Of course I couldn't leave without desert. I was presented with a desert trio. A blueberry shortbread sandwich that was to die for. So light and creamy!! My mouth melts when I think about it. A strawberry milkshake. Tasted like one of my protein shakes I drink which I do not like. Last but not least peach cobbler that was slightly warm with the ice cream slowly melting on top and tasted FABULOUS!

Overall this was a great meal. I was seated next to a group of rich older foodies that I overheard talking how this is one of there favorite restaurants! I would agree. If they made there tasting menu portions much smaller I think this place could get a Michelin Star in the future because the Chef is very talented and the service was top class! They give the ladies a little stool for there purse which I'm sure all the ladies out there would appreciate. The tasting menu features some of the best ingredients and is a bargain compared to some other places at the Wynn. This is a place I would return to in a heartbeat!",zjdNmQTjA6IXQaJZUYYwHg,1,0,4,cuKamMubsnojOzt1NIoWkA

The balcony sits adjacent to one of several of Wynn's pools and on a warm late spring morning was a great place to enjoy breakfast. The service was outstanding and incredibly attentive. Expected but always nice when it is delivered. Classic breakfast menu with eggs, waffles, pancakes, hash, potatoes etc..... All however with a little love and a twist. I had the Blueberry, Ricotta pancakes with a chicken apple sausage and my dining partner the strawberry waffles with a side of the potato hash. All were cooked to perfection and to our enjoyment. I think the only annoyance was a slight attitude at my request for a pot of green tea with a glass of ice. I like fresh iced tea and they didn't offer green, which in today's day of healthy eating still surprises me that so many places do not.

While I was staying at Encore, I decided to check out Tableau for my first time. Tableu is located near the guests elevators at Wynn. 
Impeccable service, quality food, and presentation.

I shared the granola parfait as a starter. Their housemaid granola was very fresh and crunchy. I know know if they couldn't get the right balance since this was shared, but it felt like it needed little more yogurt. Even the half size parfait filled me up pretty well with all the healthy granola.

Nautica Benedict: Perfection. Their hollandaise was very flavorful and creamy. I'm a huge fan of lox, so this smoked salmon caper mix eggs benedict was a perfect choice.

Brown Butter Apple Pancakes: Fluffy pancakes with cadied pecans and roasted warm apples had the right amount of sweetness. Their portions are generous.

I didn't have reservations, but we were seated right away. I recommend that you make reservations though to be seated in the terrace/balcony area overlooking the gorgeous Wynn pool.

I love staying at the Wynn property because of the usually excellent attention to detail and really great restaurants, casual to fine dining.  We decided to try Tableau for brunch.
Very, very disappointed.  I ordered the arugula salad that was horrible.  Half of the arugula was slimy and dark green/black.  Maybe it's just me, but I think the greens should be vibrant, intact(no rotting bits), and taste like arugula should.The waitress didn't seem to think much was anything
wrong with it.  I don't think she addressed it with the chef, as no further mention was made of it and she did not take it off the bill.  I did not pursue any further complaint because I did not want to make anyone in my party uncomfortable.
Asked for bread...they didn't bring it.
They were not busy at all...maybe with good reason because I sure won't be back.

   Heirloom Tomato Salad ($20)-  presentation bare bones - sliced with balsamic dressing drizzled on.  Please.....

It was my husband's bday and he really wanted to go somewhere for a nice breakfast. Since we were staying at Encore we made the short walk over to Tableau and were seated pretty much immediately in the atrium section. 

I ordered the omelet and fresh berries and he had elk sausage and eggs. I can't say anything bad about my plate...it was delicious, however, after my hubby took a couple bites out of his he noticed his eggs were cold and the potatoes were not all done, yet the sausage was warm. He told the server right away and he took his dish back to the kitchen. Our server came back and apologized and informed us that the executive chef himself was going to remake the dish and it would be out shortly. 

Well I continued on with my omelet and after a few minutes the server brought out a new elk sausage and eggs. After already consuming about half of this one my hubby realized that the potatoes were still not done. He was really upset b/c he was really excited about breakfast, and it just seemed as though they just couldn't get his dish right. 

We also noticed they never brought out his orange juice that he ordered and brought that to the waiter's attention. He apologized again and brought us out not only an orange juice, but Apple juice and a grapefruit juice to try. He also brought us out a complimentary pastry basket to try and make up for everything. You could tell he was genuinely sorry about messing up lee's order and the dishes not coming out right!

It has a cheerful but relaxing atmosphere with plenty of light even though it was overcast and raining some.  While it has a dressier atmosphere, it didn't require you to dress up necessarily, just wear some non-raggedy half decent clothes.  It's located in the hotel area after you walk through the entire casino if you park in self parking.

The hostess and server were pleasant so it set up for a relaxed lunch.

I got the:
- Pan seared fish (for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fish, but it was a smaller white fish)

while others got:
- Napoleon of savory tofu, dressed with a mirepoix-like spicy ratatouille and fried eggplant
- Kobe burger
- Roasted chicken

The fish was well prepared with the outside a light crispness and the fish moist and soft.  Not overly sauced or seasoned.  The fish flavor was the main event just how I like it.

I was also able to taste the vegan Napolean which had a light but nice flavor with the combination of the tofu and more flavorful eggplant. Although I'm no vegetarian by any means, I love eggplant and better quality tofu so this may be an entree I choose next time if I'm feeling like something light and healthy.  The server told us this was what Steve Wynn gets every time he comes.

The Kobe burger was just another disappointing Kobe burger.  I have never liked any of the Kobe burgers I've ever had as they are more expensive and very average tasting.  American Kobe beef just isn't that good.  I've had a 100x better burger for $4 in Carbondale, CO at Fatbelly Burger where they serve natural grass fed beef burgers and of course in Japan where some places actually use real wagyu (Japanese beef).  That'll run you about the same price or more though as an American Kobe burger.

This is a place where you can kind of escape the lights and noises of Vegas to have a pleasant meal in a pleasant atmosphere.  I'll keep this one in my pocket as an option for lunch and maybe breakfast/brunch as that looks good too.

I have been looking forward to eating at this spot
First off the restaurant is located in the Wynn
(Wynn is the swankiest hotel in Vegas)
So you know this place is not Denny's 

So we made reservations the night before
Couple things about this is 
They had a requirement of business casual
And collared shirts no sandals and no
Kids under 5  
Don't worry about any of that 
I saw t-shirts, mandels and a 3 year old  
Made a special request for the b-day 
On opentable

The restaurant itself basically has the nicest decor
That you can imagine. its where the top 1% have breakfast
It has a feel of a billionaires mansion or a Hollywood movie set

The menu is smaller then it should be but it has a lot of original 
Choices. You cannot make a bad decision on this menu 
You get what you pay for and you will pay a lot and you be
Very pleased with whatever you have 

The service was first class and they come through with
A perfect bday request answered 

If you want feel like a baller or feel like a queen 
Impress a date go here for the ultimate breakfast experience

1057585,2016-02-15,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"We selected Tableau because we wanted to be able to make reservations for brunch for a special occasion. Surprisingly, there are not many places in town that fit that bill.  Many places (understandably) will not consider a wait list for breakfast or brunch unless you go to their establishment. And we just didn't want to wait in a long line. 

SHORT VERSION: food = 5 stars; service = 3/4 stars; ambiance = 5 stars

FOOD: Come on, it's the Wynn, so quality is on the menu. And the options include simple American fare: steak sandwiches, seafood soup, basic breakfasts, and a few (but not a wealth of) respectful vegetarian and vegan options added balance to what seemed like a fairly basic breakfast menu.  And everything we ate (see above) was delicious. The bread basket was outstanding and the homemade jams and ketchup were stand outs. 

Side note: I think they have the best fries in town. I haven't collected any data or done any local fry comparison, but those fries were perfect. I said it--perfect. 

DECOR: I loved the indoor design and color scheme. I admit to finding other parts of the Wynn a little ornate for my taste, but the light colors and romantic shapes coupled with the with the mixed motifs on the upholstery leads to a modern/light/elegant feel to the space. Outside the landscaping and arrangement does all of the ambiance work. As it should. The pool area isn't ""pretty"", but the strategic use of foliage and color and shape make it feel special. I don't know that any casino in town has provided as much outdoor restaurant space as the Wynn has. 

SERVICE: Surprisingly, the service left me wavering between 3 and 4 stars for the experience. Our glasses were left empty for so long that we finally had to flag down a different waiter to request service. While not our waiter, the man who helped us was incredibly accommodating and responsive.  But the lapse of service outside was not limited to our table. And that was a disappointment.  Does it even need to be said that part of the experience in a place like Tableau is the service? 

IS IT ""DRIVE TO THE STRIP WORTHY""? No. 

OVERALL:  I enjoyed the meal (particularly the fries) and would return with guests. But I didn't love it because of the lapse in service and the simplicity of the dishes.  If I want brunch on the strip with a nice outdoor view and I don't need to make reservations, there are  options where service is always spot on and I enjoy a slightly more creative menu.  The spotty service was a surprise as a Wynn property, but more disappointing was the feeling that this level of service was not unusual for the outdoor seating area.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and am confident others would as well, but I am not in a rush to get back.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,1,0,4,vIiJ9X7857UgE2o1AktlYA

White chocolate & orange french toast ($20) - I shared this dish w my friend. I find white chocolate in general to be way too sweet so I was a little worried but the orange bread they used gave it only a slight hint of orange and offset the white chocolate sweetness. Yum if you have a sweet tooth.

When I called in to make the reservation the lady's tone of voice, personality, friendliness is what epitomizes Wynn.  I have never stayed at their hotel but that experience there tells me why they won the five diamond award.  The reservationist was polite, friendly, and just made sure to cover points that I would never have even thought of and best of all she got me excited about dining there.

Upon arriving (we arrived right on time) our table wasn't ready and we waited for 20 minutes.  Even though they apologized a few times when we were seated I would have appreciated if they told us at the ten minute mark why the table wasn't ready or at least update us.  The only things we were told were""just a moment"" and ""we are working on it.""  

For brunch we ordered the scrambled eggs with duck and puff pastry, eggs with elk, a traditional breakfast with eggs, toasts, bacon, a pastry/muffin basket, and a tofu napoleon.  I can't comment on the tofu but my mom liked it a lot.  The traditional breakfast's muffin basket was delicious.  It came with strawberry jam, what seems to be orange zest, and something similar to devonshire cream.  The elk and the eggs were disappointing.  The elk was just a piece of meat patty that wasn't very good.  The scrambled eggs on both dishes (elk and duck) were a bit runny for my taste.  The duck and egg was decent but as I said it would have been better if the scrambled eggs weren't as runny.

Service is excellent.  They have notes ready for the waiters so they address you as Mr. or Ms. or Mrs. so and so.

The ambiance in the restaurant is terrific.  On a sunny day it's like sitting inside a open window conservatory with the garden and pool right outside.  While the views can be nice, it can also be negated by out of shape men wearing their swim trunks walking around and talking on the phone.

I don't even remember what I ate there, and it was just 3 months ago.  Is it one of the nicest restaurants at the Wynn?  Sure.  It has a nice, quiet ambiance, very sophisticated, very quiet.  Will you see any obnoxious frat boys or wannabe Gordon Geckos there?  Nope.  Is it a nice place to take your wife on your anniversary?  Yup.  It's an elegant restaurant that will impress that special someone in your life.  But is the food memorable?  Not even close.

OK, ok, I had the prime filet.  I've had better...SW @ the Wynn was obviously better too.  My buddy at the halibut....he enjoyed his meal, but again, nothing where he was talking about it the next work day.  My other friend had the 7-course chef's meal...but his opinion doesn't matter, since he's a fancy-schmancy dude who's been to Aqua, French Laundry, etc, etc.  Overall, we were pleased with the meal, but not impressed.

Look, I'm not one of those freaks on After Hours with Daniel (go mojo channel), comparing foreplay to appetizers and orgasms to banana ice cream....even though I'm a big fan of banana-flavored anything, so I did enjoy their roasted banana ice cream.  I'm just a regular joe-schmoe who occasionally attempts to be fancy, who attempts to step up the dining sophistication level a bit.  And I don't go to Vegas for the dining......that's #4 or #5 on my TO-DO list.....but I do want to have good food while I'm there.

The Wynn restaurants are really interesting......it's almost like you'll always spend $390 for 3 people there....the bill almost always comes out to that.  Whether it's the SW, Country Club, Tableau, Okada (good sake), Wing Lei (with serious alcohol), or Corsa Cuccina (with serious wine), the bill always comes out to $390.  Kinda scary.

Like most of the restaurants at the Wynn, it's over-rated and over-hyped.  3-star rating in my opinion, but some will add another 1 star because of the environment and the ""Wynn"" factor.",5cI0ayj4VWMoD-YEPqUNUA,1,1,3,211fHzb0Xf0QJyJxnxyVdw

All my mom really wanted for her birthday was a nice steak.  What we ended up with was some tough stripp steak.   My mom and I both just wanted simply a steak, veggies and potatoes.  While it looked great - it did not meet our expetations.  The potato cakes were all right, seems that they come in frozen, seriously. 

They serve a nice yeast roll here, but they put it in a popover pan which is totally unattractive.  I'd rather a roll on a plate in this case.

The orange frenchtoast with macadamia butter was acceptable.

All in all, there were some scallops on the menu I think I would rather have had and I dont even like scallops.  Regardless of what we did or didnt order, no matter what menu we used - EVERYONE in the kitchen should be able to pick a steak.

As Tower Suite guests, we were told upon check-in that our complimentary breakfasts would be at Tableau. We were shown where it was and given the hours.

The first morning there, we had a lovely experience. We were seated immediately, and our server was wonderful. She even helped direct us on where to go to reserve a pool cabana for the day. 

We were given the menus specifically for Tower Suite guests. We couldn't choose from the entire menu for our breakfast, but the menu they provided was still great. I went with the Garden Frittata and it was delicious. Husband went with a salmon bagel. Based on Day 1, our experience would have been 5 stars.

Morning 2, a Wednesday, we came down. The restaurant was a little busier than the day before, but there was still lots of seating. Maria at the hostess table told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table without a reservation. Rewind to our check-in, no one told us to make reservations. They told us to just head on down between the specified hours. Marcelo told them that we are tower suite guests, and we were then offered a table outside. Fine! After the lecture on reservations, we made a reservation for the following morning at 9:15 am, just to avoid any issue.

We were seated outside were we had our choice between quite a few tables. I naturally grabbed one in the shade. Again, the food was great. I went with whole wheat pancakes with a side of veggie sausage. Marcelo had the acai, and as a Brasilian, he confirmed that it's a good one. No complaints on food.

At the end of the meal, their computers went down so we had to wait awhile for our receipt. They all had to be handwritten by the manager. It finally arrived, and we were on our way.

Day 3! We head on down at 9:10 for our 9:15 reservation! The young girl at the front desk can't find it. She says it was never put in. We stressed that we made it the day before with Maria after the whole ordeal. We sat outside and waited about 10-15 minutes for a table.

Once seated, we were handed the full menus. We asked for the menus that guests of the tower get, the ones we were given the previous 2 days. Our waitress told us she had to check on our reservation. She came back and said that the front desk told her that our complimentary breakfasts were at the buffet. News to us!!! We told her that the front desk told us it was HERE, and that it wasn't a problem the previous two days. She was a little uncomfortable and clearly didn't know what to say or do. We just ordered from the full menus.

It was a really frustrating experience. We came to the Wynn to spend money and be treated well. We did everything we were told to do, and things still went wrong. Plus, who we see and how we are treated at breakfast set the tone for the whole day! After going back and forth with our server this morning that we were in the correct place and have her not even try to do any problem solving, we sat in frustrated silence while waiting for our food to arrive. We concluded that we should have stayed at the Cosmo instead. We came to spend 4 days before this baby comes out of me, so we were looking to spend a lot of money (which we did) and have fun. It just sucks to be treated poorly, knowing how much money we pumped into the building the last 4 days.

The orange juice is freshly squeezed and extremely fresh and delicious. Unfortunately it's $7 for a small juice glass which is outrageous but you're in Vegas so...

We both got bananas foster French toast. My Mom loved it. I didn't care for it. I didn't like the bread they used. It tasted like banana bread...almost cakey. I prefer just a regular bread if you are going to have such sweet toppings. I wouldn't order it again. In the past I've had the bananas foster French toast from Terrace Point Cafe which was much better than here. I noticed on this visit that Tableau had it and Terrace Point did not. Their version was better! My Mom also got a side of bacon which she requested be crispy. She really enjoyed it. We got a croissant which was amazing! If I could, I would eat one a day for the rest of my life! 

Multiple people waited on us throughout our dining experience. At least 4, maybe 5. It doesn't matter so much as long as you are being well taken care of but it is difficult to build a bond with your person and it's confusing come tip time because to me it seems more like a buffet restaurant tip than normal table service. 

The only thing that takes away from outdoor dining here is the fact that birds will visit the empty tables and poke around. I feel like since the staff know this happens, they should be clearing the tables much quicker than they do. If the tables were cleared quicker, the birds wouldn't have anything to dine on. We saw some birds take a pastry and fly away.

Food-wise this was a total miss for me. Started off great with the breathtaking atmosphere, iced coffee, and the complimentary pastries which were delicious, and went downhill very quickly. 

I ordered the eggs Benedict, with turkey bacon instead of real bacon. My order was brought out incorrectly the 1st time; they brought me some vegan dish with fake eggs and meat. Gross. They brought it back and then brought out the dish I actually ordered, and they forgot the sauce on the side. Waited for that to be brought out. Then I went to bite into my eggs, which were wayyyyy undercooked. It was literally jiggling all over-it looked like it was alive. Even more gross. I order eggs Benedict all of the time and have never seen eggs come out this undercooked. I advised the waitress and she was very apologetic and wanted to bring me something else. She said that's how the chef prepares the eggs, and that they could cook them through more for me. At this point, I was overly hungry and frustrated, so I chose to cancel my order and pick off of my husband's plate instead. His meal was also unenjoyable: he had the hash, which was basically like eating pure salt. He didn't like it either. Total bummer.

It doesn't look like a ton of food, but we felt very full after both meals.  ALSO, I'm a pescatarian, so we requested the filet mingon from the crab cake benedict on the side for one of them.

Anyway, it was mediocre.  The presentation was great, but the bread was soggy and couldn't stand up against the custard. The upside was that the bread was a multi-grain oat bread, so I got a good dose of fiber.

I yelped the top list of brunch spots in town and went down the list to see if I could get a reservation. All of the major spots were already booked. So, I changed my approach and went to the open table website and looked for restaurants that still had open seats. This is actually a great way of booking a restaurant during a busy weekend. It worked out well and I will do this again. Tableau had good reviews on yelp (which is my go to source) so I booked it. The restaurant is located near the tower suites in the Wynn. The decor in the tower suites area is very well done. It is airy and opulent with light marble and soft green tones. Definitely a ladies who lunch kind of vibe. The restaurant was actually less impressive in comparison. The design on the back of the chairs is horrible. 

Food: 
We started off by sharing a large chocolate croissant which was just okay. It had been coated with butter which gave the pastry a greasy look. The texture was flaky and served warmed. The temperature was good but I usually like my croissants a bit more doughy.  I had the Spanish 3 egg omelet. It was very flavorful. I would recommend it. The only thing I would say is that the chorizo is more like a spicy ham that chorizo. But still, good. My husband ordered the filet and eggs. His dish was basic. There was no sauce or dressing given with the steak. The meat was over-salted and cut did not seem like a true filet cut.

Highlight:
All in all it was a good experience. I'm glad we checked it out. But, there are so many other places to check out at the Wynn that we'll try somewhere else next time. We are new to the area and the best part of the brunch was that we discovered the Wynn hotel. The garden was decorated with an all flower carrousel.

I described to him what I like and he brought me a glass of liquid heaven.  WOW.  I enjoyed it so much, I asked him to write down the name for me.   He even brought me the bottle to show me what it looked like so I could find it in the store.  Very nice.

It's a beautiful restaurant with partial views of the elaborate pool area.  Looks almost like the living room of a chateau transformed into a restaurant.  The decor is very unique, but it's a bit stuffy - like you're afraid to laugh too loudly when you're there.  Or if you drop your fork, you almost want to apologize for the noise.  The food is good, and I do recommend it, but it's more of a private, special occasion type place.",CiJat5Up2jAO3B0qTbiN5Q,1,0,4,iFBOm3SarX35vIOpd6z0Dw

1970686,2011-04-15,2,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Came here for a late breakfast/brunch because I heard they serve one heck of a French Toast!! Besides, once in a while I need to have a gourmet breakfast fix! Since this place sat in the Regal ""Wynn Casino"", I automatically had high expectations. I think its only fair..  Well, it wasn't your neighborhood Denny's, that's for sure.. Another Extravagant Restaurant clearly evident by the Fine furniture, detail in its structure and the Staffs pleasant and proper demeanor that ran it. 

What I devoured Next to the window just a few feet away from the pool:

House-made Elk Sausage & Eggs: This caught my eye since ""Elk"" isn't the standard breakfast fare I'm used to.. I asked the server if it was ""gamey"" and she said not really and then sold me on it. Well, it came on a neat little plate and looked like a sausage patty.. It was gamey enough for me and kinda dry.. I didn't like it. The hollandaise was good and the potaotes as well (only thing, I could of counted how many nickel sized potato slices there were on the plate!). I told myself if i'm gonna go for something unusual like this, I might as well try it served at a place like this?! Still didn't like it..

White Chocolate & Orange French Toast: This totally 360'd my outlook of this place, I mean from pretty bad to Wow!! Besides that it looked like a half order dish, This was so sO SO Breathtaking!!! Although, much different from the typical comforting traditional french toast.. In the gourmet world, this thing was Brilliant! I had to desperately hold in my inner thoughts racing of joy cause I didn't want to look like a fool!! If you like sophisticated sweet and extra succulent french toast then you don't have to think twice on this one.. 

Signature Tableau Potatoes: looked like chicken nuggets.. The crust just lightly breaded, potato just the right softness and seasoning.. Worthy of its name! Dipped in their ""house-made ketchup"".. Potato lovers, enjoy!

House-made Chicken-Apple Sausages: Juicy, Tasty and just hints of flavors unleashed through every bite! This with their ketchup and Potatoes = little meal itself!

Expected Much and Got Most of what I expected especially from the french toast, just not the Elk.. Service was Top of its Class! Value: Most gourmet spots never seem to be worth the quadruple price tag but I think its understandable for the Occasional experience and those of you who have curious taste buds, that make it worth while (But you Might not want to dine at places like this, when you're super hungry.. Like how I was!). A Staggering $70 including 20+% tip (and just regular water to drink) for my solo breakfast getaway.. I have No Regrets! However, I think all thats needed is an order of French Toast (maybe 2 for me) and your Good to Go!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,5,2,4,Os42XVqCEuI_N5YHXtfIRw

Vegas has a lot of restaurants (in case you didn't know) so the fact that these two felt strongly about eating at the same spot twice in a three day trip bode well for our meal.

And holy moly roly poly.  I'd eat here every day if I could.  First of all, the place is darling.  It feels intimate and the decor is vaguely dollhouse, a great spot for a fancy tea party.  Or brunch, I suppose.  The service - stellar.  The presentation is sweet, with bread in individual tins and hot chocolate served in a fancy pot.  But most important - the food is superb!  

I started with a warm portobello mushroom soup that was poured out of a beautiful little teapot over some little lobster raviolis.  This is one of the best soups I've ever had the pleasure of planting my face in, with deep flavor and that perfect buttony mushroom texture.  After polishing that off like a starved orphan, I moved on to an outstanding steak salad with balsamic, blue cheese, bacon, and more mushrooms.  That was another clean plate.  I finished out the meal (hey, it was my last of the trip, don't judge) with a gorgeous parfait with plenty of berries and lemon custard that was out of this world.  My friends all seemed to enjoy their food as well, and the miscellaneous bites I stole were all fantastic.  I will also mention that the fries are great, and the homemade ketchup (in which you can actually see tiny seeds!) is really several cuts above the bottled stuff.  Definitely give this place a go.

Came in after a long night of debauchery and was immediately accommodated even without a reservation.  I, however, highly recommend making one since there were already plenty of people waiting only an hour after opening.

Being situated inside the Wynn, this isn't your typical run of the mill breakfast joint.  The restaurant itself was nicely decorated with elaborate features throughout.  If available, request for the conservatory which boasts great lighting and awesome views of the outdoor pool.  They also have patio seats that's ideal for good weather conditions.  One aspect I particularly didn't like was how the crowd was too hoity-toity which somewhat ruined the ambiance.  Superb customer service though with remarkable attention to details such as offering small chairs for purses which we found quite hilarious.

Instead of ordering something off the menu that I can't easily get elsewhere, the inebriated part of me opted for the Tableau breakfast.  Indeed, that's as basic as anyone can get but it does come with complimentary beverage and pastry basket.

Overall, Tableau is one of the better choices for breakfast around the Strip.  Yet, nothing really stood out of this place that makes me want to rate this place anything higher than three stars.

I have been coming to Tableau at least twice a year for a long time, and the last three times have been really disappointing. I went most recently in the second week of May 2012 for breakfast. I remember coming here and getting awesome, elaborate breakfast items that were meticulously prepared and completely delicious. Now you get pedestrian choices that are pretty ""meh."" 

I told the server that I had had a crab benedict there that I really enjoyed, he asked the chef if he could accommodate and the chef agreed. I got my crab benedict. It was a very boring and normal-looking eggs benedict but it had some wet crab meat slopped on it. Blah.

Service is amazing as always, everyone knows your name right away, and fresh squeezed orange juice is delicious of course. But the food, repeatedly, has been very meh. Las Vegas is not a city to be a ""meh"" restaurant in. On top of that, Tableau is retardedly expensive - two orange juices, a crab benedict and a regular benedict, tax and tip - $80.

I notice that for guests of the Tower Suites at the Wynn, all the food at Tableau is free.  I don't know how long they have been doing that, maybe it has contributed to a decline in quality as hitting food costs may no longer be relevant. I also understand that a new chef recently took over, which makes me even more sad, because at the beginning of a new chef's tenure he should be producing outstanding food to build a reputation. This is not really happening. Guests around us slogged through their overpriced breakfasts with blank, apathetic expressions. 

Tableau closed, then changed names, reopened, then changed names again, then got a new leader. Not surprising the food got left behind. Two stars for overpriced meh breakfast.",Qh4-dAmnRsF8_oDvwBW4GA,2,0,2,11g3tbZETvo76YZ0dZ9AhA

The seating arrangements are done well, you're not close to your neighbors and can enjoy your meal freely. 

Service was efficient and fast. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they made sure our coffee was filled which was real nice.

The first order was museli. It was made with cinnamon and small strips of apples. You are served with milk, brown sugar, etc. The museli was soft and tasty. The aroma of the cinnamon was enticing. We enjoyed the museli quite a bit.

We ordered the lemon ricotta pancake.....need I say more? It was gooood! If it was a short or full stack, we would have eaten it in a hot second. The hint of lemon was perfect and the ricotta added a very nice texture to the pancake. It was served warm and moist. We didn't even use the butter or the maple syrup.

From the fabulous breakfasts, to the creative weekend brunches, every meal left us wanting more. Our last time here had us enjoying the brunch. Girl had a great French toast with fresh fruit and succulent sausage.  The French toast were thick slices of custardy delight, golden brown and topped with fresh seasonal mixed fruit, house made juicy sausage made the dish savory and delish. I enjoyed an eggs Benedict special made with beef tenderloin and blue crab. Omg, mouth watering and presented with perfection. It was to much to behold until I took my first bite. Juicy and cooked perfectly, over poached eggs, and a decadent hollandaise sauce. Again awesome. We enjoyed a couple of the mixed drink specials suggested to us and again were wowed.

BUT, you should not expect anything less, because: 1) You're in Vegas, you're not in some small little town. Expect, to spend more than you're use to. 2) It's in the Wynn Encore. Do I need to say more? 3) You're on vacation, splurge (if you don't have the money, then why are you here?)

Moving on to the food, by far the best breakfast I've ever had. I've been to Vegas twice in the past 3 years and each visit, I have breakfast here at least 3 times. I LOVE the pancakes, super moist and fluffy. The first time I ever had it, I had the Huckleberry Pancake (seasonal), it was just sooo delicious, I went back the next day just for this. The Norwegian Eggs Benedict, was simply divine, the best I ever had and trust me I've had this plenty of times from high end restaurants to your lower end. And to top it all off, the coffee was amazing. I don't know what kind of blend it is or even if it's anything special, but it was very aromatic, not too bitter, you can definitely tell it was brewed at the right temperature.

- Entrees: Aside from the heavenly french toast, we also got their duck hash.  It was tasty but more like a pot pie.  Then again, duck hash is my favorite breakfast ever, so I'm especially picky about it.
- Side: Their bacon's nothing special.
- Drinks: The ShowStopper cocktails were refreshing but just a little too sweet.

All in all, Tableau's a great brunch spot with prompt, friendly service, and the portions don't make you feel like a glutton.  That seems to be hard to find in Vegas.",9ary9cP3EQaNomwcwkkH9w,0,0,4,w7SL0Uuu_nHUj9bepP_Xuw

We have sampled most of the restaurants within the Wynn/Encore resort and this one is certainly near the top of the list. Much better than Alex ever was...

Onto the food:

Coffee: Not bad, but nothing special either. My cup was always full and there was plenty of cream & sugar for my wife's coffee. Basically, they didn't screw-the-pooch on this one like so many Vegas establishments do.

French toast:  perfect portion size, nice subtle orange flavor, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Excellent and highly recommended.

Poached eggs and elk sausage:  we have never had poached eggs actually shaped like eggs - very cool. The sausage is full of spices and isn't dominated by a 'gamey' elk flavor. 

Bacon: I'm a snob when it comes to Vitamin P and Tableau didn't disappoint. Perfectly prepared and good flavor. Again, not the best I've ever had but definitely at a high level.",p2or1zGLo8Uaz7L80NtUaA,0,0,4,um-AAP3qf3P9rJHo40g12A

Summer 2016

It's a gamble to take a toddler to an upscale restaurant. My daughter is usually well-behaved when we eat out, however, there's a 99.9999 % chance she'll be a maniac. One little thing could set her off and her ear-shattering screams will pierce the air. Then all this chaos will attract a great deal of unwanted attention. Most people will be thinking I'm the worst mother ever, and they'll hate me for bringing a child in a classy place. I'll try to keep cool to let my kid know she can't always get what she wants, but she'll show no signs of stopping. I have never let my kid use my iPad or phone to avoid negative behaviors, but it will be tempting to give in. 

Ugh. The struggle is real.

I took a chance even though the whole experience was nerve-wracking. Our server took a while to get our order, she had a customer who was chatting up a storm. I know it's not her fault for the long wait, but I was nervous my daughter was going to break something or start getting fussy since I had to take some utensils away. Why do they have so many stuff on the freakin' table?!?! Fortunately, the little ramekins kept her busy. I was bummed I didn't get a stool for my purse/diaper bag like the others did, that would've probably kept her busy, too. Oh well, maybe purses from Target don't get a stool. Our friendly server was very apologetic about the wait, though, and we didn't wait long for the food.

At home, we often eat fruit for our first breakfast so I ordered a bowl of mixed berries. There was a variety of fresh blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. My daughter ate most of it, even the blackberries, which she never liked before. Since my little girl doesn't eat much, I just ordered the Pressed Duck and Waffles for us to share. That was the most interesting thing on their brunch menu, I've never had that before! I thought the duck was a little small but it was actually enough, my daughter didn't even want to try it. I love how the duck was perfectly tender and the sauce was tasty. The waffles were delicious, especially when I drowned it in the blackberry syrup. I also had the Orange Creamsicle Smoothie. I liked it but it had a little bitter taste, maybe that's why my toddler didn't want to have anymore after she tried it. More for me! 

I also got a $9 bottle of Pellegrino, I had to do something crazy, I was in Vegas after all. I had to live it up! Then I remembered I don't even like sparkling water. My daughter does, but there was no way she was going to finish a whole liter! I wanted to take it back to our hotel, but they didn't have the cap. Our server offered to give me a bunch of plastic cups to pour the rest, but I didn't want to carry fifty cups without a fully closed cover. Oh well. It was really nice of our server to help me out, though. The long wait in the beginning was all forgiven. 

And I was so relieved my daughter didn't have a hysterical meltdown!

I went with one of our sales guys to a conference last week at LV.  He booked us a lunch reservation at the Tableau having just eaten there for dinner the night before.  He was raving about it, but after we finished lunch there, he reluctantly admitted that it wasn't great and that dinner was much better.  We had clam chowder, which was OK; the bits of celery were unconventional, and quite frankly, not that good.  I had a pepper fennel crusted ahi tuna, where again, the cracked fennel seeds were an unconventional topping for tuna and overwhelmed the tuna's delicate taste.

They also have fresh juices and cappuccinos, lattes, etc.

For brunch we dined inside at a round table near the doors that open up to the pool. Its charming decor, abundance of natural light, and delicious selection of food would make me keep coming back for years. The atmosphere is classy yet relaxed. There are plenty of tables with nice views of the tower suites pool area. Service is on point. Food is even better. 

The complimentary pastries and house-made jam was a great start to our brunch. Seriously, the jams are a must-try. They have a pretty standard selection of breakfast dishes to choose from and a separate vegan menu. My favorite was the Spanish omelet. The avocado inside made every bite incredible, and the sauce on the side was so good. 

A few hours later we did not experience the same level of service and expediency while sitting out by the pool. We had to wait an hour to get two drinks, and we heard plenty of other people complaining as well. Somebody in the cabana nearby had to wait an hour for a burger only to receive a burger with a rock-solid bun.

From the relaxing views of the well manicured gardens to the elegant dining atmosphere, no detail is overlooked at this posh ""English tea party"" inspired restaurant. 

The brew here is eye opening and the OJ is freshly squeezed. Small details IMO that make the dining experience that much more enjoyable. In this day and age, we all know little things do mean a lot!

In regards to the brunch fare, I was pleasantly surprised with both the quality and flavor. You can tell the execution was performed with distinction & care.

Although the white chocolate French toast was the claim to fame here, I was hooked by the pictures of fluffy blueberry pancakes on my iPhone Yelp app. Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed at all. It was as fluffy and soft as I expected. I would have preferred more fresh blueberries, but with all things considered,  it was still quite a treat. Especially when I drizzled a generous amount of that warm maple syrup on top and watched it cascade down each thick layer of divine, doughy goodness!

However, the highlight of the meal had to be the Duck Croque Madame. I'd even venture out to say that it's the single best thing I've ever had for brunch thus far in Vegas! Topped with a fried egg (now how can that be wrong?!) this French sandwich was packed with mouthwatering deliciousness!  From the perfectly tender morsels of duck that tasted like it was slow roasted for hours, to the melted Gruyere and caramelized onions (reminiscent of a french onion soup), it was like a virtual foodgasm in my mouth!

I was full from eating Vegas buffets two days in a row so I wanted something lighter and cheaper. First off, nothing at Tableau is cheap. Secondly, I was also looking for quality, and every Wynn restaurant I've ever eaten at is first rate. (I've been to Red 8, Wing Lei, and Okada.) In terms of quality food and service, you can never go wrong with eating at a Wynn restaurant. That also explains why it's very expensive. If you want the best quality dishes and don't mind the price, then this is the place.
Tableau reminds me of a European-style French café. They give you top-notch waiter service. When the hostess seats you, you should ask to be seated in the Conservatory because it's a beautiful venue. 
Tableau serves breakfast and lunch. They also serve specialty dishes that you won't find at buffets or American chain restaurants. Instead of picking the traditional American breakfast, I decided to try something special. I ordered one fresh oyster. It was small but delicious. I also ordered the Ahi Tuna dish which was served medium rare. The dish looked like it came from a master chef cooking competition. The dish wasn't that filling but at least it was delicious. Tableau also serves you bread which is free of charge. It was a very nice way to complement a meal. All the breads and parmesan crackers were delicious too.

I'm not complaining about the food at all.  In fact, the food was delicious.  We ordered the tomato bisque, the eggs benedict, dungeness crab club sandwich, yellowfin tuna tartare, huckleberry buttermilk pancakes, and scrambled eggs w duck puff pastry. Their cocktails were super yummy, too.  

But is a restaurant really great only for their food?  Are we paying only for the meal?  NO.  We're paying for great service, too.  I cannot believe how bad the service was, and how it progressively got worse throughout our meal.  The first thing that went wrong was our server didn't take our order until about 30 minutes after we were seated.  The second thing that went wrong was that the complimentary bread that came out (in super cute little pots) was COLD.  Then the waitress forgot about our cocktails and we had to remind her to bring them.  To make matters worse, she decided to tell us some ridiculous story about how the bartender had to go the cellar to get wine and that's why the drinks were late.  

And here we get to the worst part of the meal.  Our check.  First of all, when the waitress handed us the check, she told us that a 18% gratuity had been added because our party was larger than 7.  Of course, this we expected, but when we looked at the bill, they had NOT added the gratuity.  We told her so, and she adjusted the bill to reflect that.  Then, the Bachelorette in our party told us that she had given her credit card to the hostess (on a fake restroom run), and that the bill should have been taken care of.  We asked our waitress for the credit card, and that we would be paying for the meal.  However, they could not locate the credit card.  It took them a good 30 minutes for them to track it down.  HOW RIDICULOUS WAS THAT?!  The entire time, we're just waiting and waiting, and it was FREEZING outdoors.  No offer for blankets, no one in upper management to come out and apologize to us.  I don't understand how an upscale restaurant in a nicer hotel on the Strip could be THIS BAD.

At this point, I'm just venting, so I'm just going to end this review here.

We also ordered the White Chocolate & Orange French Toast - wow again!! Probably the best French toast we've ever had. So yum. Perfectly sweetened. I like lighter tastes, hubby prefers a sweeter taste and both of us could not stop licking our forks. :)

Food was excellent and worth the splurge. French toast was about $20 for 2 large slices. Our total was about $70, including tax and tip. Both dishes were so good that we decided to come back the next morning. Our total on day 2 was about $100, including tax and tip. Make reservations for faster service and request atrium seating - such pretty views and decor!

The next morning, we ordered the same 2 dishes but also added the elk sausage since it was so different than what we've had. It was smokier, muskier. Hubby loved it but I prefer the duck.

The apple pomegranate juice was very good too - a bit sweet but very fresh and smooth. Coffee was so-so, a bit watered down but I compare all coffee to my favorite (rising sun at Alan Wong's).

Service was also very attentive...one of the servers said that since they were in the Wynn Tower restaurant, some people even ordered  ""off-menu"" and they sometimes have to make ""it"" happen to deliver what they wanted.

We were comped our meals and looking for a place to eat, and after one look at this place, we instantly chose it for lunch.  They have a very unique polygonal room at the end of the restaurant and that is where we chose to sit.  On a nice day, they do have service outside along the terrace which is wonderful, but that day was cold so we opted to stay inside.

Service was good enough in the beginning.  We ordered the seared sea scallops, caesar salad, yellowfin tuna tartare and the steak.  They came out with fresh bread and butter and the bread was individually baked and presented.  That in itself deserves the 5-star rating.  Next we were presented with our main courses, but they somehow forgot about the tuna tartare.  The steak was medium rare, cooked perfectly over polenta.  The sea scallops (5) were also perfectly cooked and with a nice tangy salad in the middle.  My Caesar salad had whole romaine leaves and the perfect amoutn of dressing was added.  The bread croutons and saved cheese was also tasty.  My tuna tartare came out very late, but definitely well worth the wait.  Large chunks of tuna with mango and avocado and hot sauce was absolutely amazing.

I really can't forget the tuna tartare, and I kept raving about it at Vegas.  I was told by our server that Steve Wynn himself orders double orders of the tuna whenever he stays in the hotel.

- Beautiful, gorgeous spot overlooking some of the pools at the Wynn.
- Our server was prompt, friendly, and great.
- Absolutely wonderful food. The free bread was incredible.
- MUST-HAVES: French toast, Milk & cookies soufflé.

OVERALL CONS:
- A little overpriced. Actually let me rephrase. Very overpriced. But.. it was worth going one time to experience the great food.

Here's what we got:

* Free bread - OMG so delicious! Fresh out of the oven, and they come in these little baking pans. Incredibly soft & just breaks apart so easily so you can slather it with butter. A slight hint of sweetness to it too.. yum.

* Fresh squeezed apple & pomegranate juice - Tasted very good, very fresh, like a great cider. I couldn't taste much of the pomegranate (maybe that was the slight tartness) but that's probably a good thing as too much pomegranate could easily be overkill.

* Organic Pear Mixed Salad (pears, blue cheese, walnuts, mixed greens) - Good balance of ingredients, the blue cheese was nice and strong. The dressing was light and tart and there was exactly enough for the salad. But there were just a few pieces of pears (and they looked canned) and overall this just didn't wow me.

* Eggs Benedict (poached eggs, nueske canadian bacon, béarnaise sauce) - Perfectly cooked eggs w/ drippy yolk, great sauce. The english muffin was perfection, with that slight crunch, yet soft & warm. The bacon was a little tough to cut through though (and messed me up as I was trying to cut through the thing - I got egg yolk everywhere). Overall good, but unfortunately not worth $21.

* White Chocolate & Orange French Toast (organic orange blossom honey butter, pure maple syrup) - This was absolutely amazing! There was that slight orange flavor (though I didn't personally catch any of the white chocolate), perfect crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. Love the fruits you get on the side too - raspberries, blackberries, oranges, strawberries, blueberries. Just the perfect amount til the very last bite.

* Milk and Cookies Soufflé (chocolate chip cookie soufflé served with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce) - THIS MUST BE THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. Warning: it takes a while to come out, but that's because they bake it when you order and you get it FRESH out of the oven. Our waiter poked a hole in the souffle and poured in the melted dark chocolate (don't worry, there was some left over). I took a bite and was just in Heaven. It is was incredibly soft and moist and gooey. I can't believe I ate the whole thing but I did! The ice cream provided a good temperature contrast, but it was kind of low quality ice cream, not very rich or creamy.",eIa4QJXp5ZNmuFORnuPvDA,2,1,5,MoWQbzF48fmkoyJE_pJzjw

About Tableau after some research and I hesitated several times because it just looked like the kind of place that would be so snooty. Here's where you say ""don't judge a book by its cover.""

We had 2 small children with us and that's always a challenge when dining out especially when you like to eat good food in a nice atmosphere. Everyone starting with the maître d was soo unbelievable kind to us. She was so courteous, polite and friendly. I wish I remembered her name. Just a beautiful girl and I did not detect any phoniness from her either. They even helped us take our big double stroller and store it. 


Luckily our children are used to dining out so they are generally pretty well behaved. Some people will always give you the side eye but most of the other parties seated near us were cheerful and pretty interested in engaging our children. 


The space is so stunning and elegant. Reminds me of a beautiful tea parlor you would take an English high tea from. The food was amazing. The little small pastries and homemade jams and jellies, my banana  sour cream pancakes were amongst some of the best I've ever had. 

The cutest thing was the little chair they set beside you to seat your handbag. My little blue Chanel was happy to have her own chair.

I was expecting it to be a bit more extensive.  We split the apple pancakes, frittata, and peach smoothie amongst the three of us in my party.  We also got a flight of juices, which were 3 mini shots of the various kind of juices they make.  Tiny amount considering the hefty price tag.  They gave us these mini cinnamon donuts at the beginning, which was actually probably my favorite part of the meal.  The frittata was mediocre for sure, however the pancakes were delicious.

I originally heard mixed reviews about Tableau due to their small portions, but I am so glad that I decided to try it!

AMBIANCE: This restaurant feels like it's designed for the upper class. I felt like I should have been wearing a summer dress and sipping on English tea. I liked the design of the restaurant, with the large windows for a view of the outside.

SERVICE: The service was great and they were so accommodating! They had a vegetarian/vegan menu for my boyfriend. After he ordered the vegetarian eggs Benedict, our waitress mentioned that the English muffin had eggs in it and asked if he'd like to substitute something else for it. I know it's typical for restaurants to ask that, but I think most would forget those little things. I was very impressed at how accommodating they were.

FOOD: The duck hash was amazing! The pastry layer on the bottom was so yummy and everything just complemented so well. The roasted tomato hollandaise made everything so delicious, and there was actually a lot of duck. It was also the perfect portion for me. I am definitely coming back for it.

I also tried my boyfriend's vegetarian eggs Benedict and was impressed as well! The veggie patty was really good, along with the scrambled tofu and hollandaise.

Tableau is a fancy cafe style restaurant in the corner of the Wynn in Las Vegas.  Seated on the edge of the pool and garden with a spectacular indoor rounded lanai seating area, this place is beautiful and worth waiting ten to fifteen minutes for a table for breakfast.  

I had the chicken apple sausage with their pancakes topped with peach compote in honey preserve and some pastry with coffee and water.  

I have to emphasize the beauty of this breakfast.

The pancakes were fluffy and had the right texture to them when cutting into them.  As the fruit compote soaked into each pancake, my breakfast experience would increase exponentially toward heaven.  But the sausage--oh! the sausage--was to die for.  I dreamt of that sausage for weeks and want to go back just for a side order of sausage with those delectable pancakes.  Their sausage, made in house, has a perfect texture and the right thickness of skin that has that bite to it when you chew it.  The flavors of the apple and chicken mixture are heaven on my palette and I could eat fifty more in one sitting.  

You must eat breakfast here.  Their pancakes are worth the 18 dollar price tag, as is that heavenly sausage.  Please, I beg of you--try this place if you have the time. You won't regret it.

Tip: make reservations.  They start taking reservations at 6am.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,0,4,VMMT5L3TQ2yOZm4bzf2IiA
3021440,2009-01-07,1,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"First of all, 3-stars.  Might go back, might not.

1) FOOD
In general, all the food was rather, 'meh'.  My best buddy was the bread roll which was fresh baked and highly necessary to absorb the salt I ingested later.  (See further below)
...The Dungeness Crab Club was reasonable but nothing to write home about.  The sweet tomatoes that they put in there does add some color into an otherwise mild sandwich but other than that, just okay.
...The French Fries are indeed soggy as another reviewer mentioned, but I think they're supposed to be that way?  Maybe?  I dunno.  One way or the other, I didn't think they were all that.  The homemade ketchup however was sweet and delicious and made the fries worth eating.
...The Lobster Bisque really bugged.  This thing was far too hot and extremely salty; it tasted like a sweaty armpit.  Anyone who might have bothered to have tasted it before it left the kitchen would have known how wretched it was.  When the waiter failed to notice my repugnance with the soup, I called him on it and told him to just take it away.  To their credit, the chef admitted that the base had been reduced too far, apologized and brought another bowl which was STILL salty but at least edible this time and at a temperature lower than that of lava.  But guys: You never tasted the soup even once before coming out of the kitchen?  EPIC FAIL.
- Lobster Bisque: 1/5 (2/5*)
- Dungeness Crab Club: 3/5
- Fries: 3/5
- Bread Roll:  4/5


2) SERVICE
I originally told the maitre'd I was very hot from walking the strip and wanted something away from the windows.  So she promptly disregarded my request and put me next to the windows while saying she'd drop the shades.  So she did and it made no frickin' difference. 
...With the great bisque debacle, the service in my mind kinda hit a skid.  The chef failed to identify any issues with soup, nor did the waiter care about the fact that I wasn't eating it.
...To their credit, the busboys were huffin' it.  Grabbed plates quickly, filled my glass promptly.
...But when it came to picking up my credit card, no one was to be found.  I couldn't even find someone to ask, so I flipped out my money roll and paid cash instead and walked out.



3) LOCATION
The location is great, like most restaurants at Wynn.  It's a private area behind High Limit Slots past the Tower Suites registration.  Clearly it's aimed at the Tower Suites clientele.


CONCLUSION
I might go back with the wife. I suspect that I just had a one-time bad experience but what bugs me is that nothing really stood out in my meal at all to compel me to care about coming back to this restaurant.  I hope I'm wrong.

I think based on the people that were there when I went, this is more of a ""ladies who lunch"" sort of joint in the morning & mid-day.  Lots of wifes from the 'upper crust' Tower Suites co-mingling and lunching together.",hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA,2,1,3,TicZgmMyANzTdQ1QyX-xlA

MENU MUST ORDERS:  Sour cream banana pancakes, duck hash, and greek yogurt with granola!  The sour cream banana pancakes are mouthwatering, the duck hash was incredibly savory, and the sweet honey in the yogurt was a perfect starting appetizer.  I used to compare this restaurant to Bouchon, but I think I have grown to like Tableau more.  You cannot beat the outdoor atmosphere.

My family and I came here to have brunch. We all ordered something different so that we can have a taste of each dish. I ordered the purity juice, this was the perfect way to start my day off. I personally like it cold when I drink juice, so I asked for a side of ice. Just makes the raw juice taste so much better when it's cold. I went for the soft shell crab sandwich, this is a must try! It is very tasty and the crab is nice and crunchy. The batter was well made because when I took a bite into the sandwich, you can hear that crunch as you bite into it. Totally recommend this dish if you ever stop by Tableu. 

I also really like how the condiments are all made out of scratch, I mean,,,how many restaurant does this nowadays? Very few I've been to does this, and this is one of them.

3093945,2011-11-09,1,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Lesson learned: it's not worth paying the extra few bucks for a 'kobe' beef burger.  When the meat is in its minced state, you can't tell which part of the cow the meat really came from.  

In the spirit of finding a new brunch service that could exceed or at the very least match tried-and-tested Bouchon, I came across Tableau.  It looks fancy, it's in the fancier, poshier part of the Wynn (if that's even possible!), it's hard enough to find so nobody would just chance upon it, and the glass rotunda in the middle is definitely where the better tables are.  The four of us were lucky enough to get one of them.  

The service was excellent, we never had to ask for the server to top up our coffee and there was never a time that we had to flag down our server.  

The food though, was a bit of a let down.  Maybe I should've tried the orange-infused French toast with honey butter or the eggs benny that a few other yelpers were raving about, instead of the burger, because the burger was, well, ordinary in every way possible.  The hub had an omelet that was too overpowered by onion and the side of bacon was just so so.  

So given the price, I would rather go back to Bouchon for their blueberry friands, sourdough bread, chocolate croissant and pommes frites. http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:PjzTZX9Il0c4LV-ezt13hA",vASaF47nWvCHEEDA8nfCVw,3,1,3,S10d4N_gEKOckgERqcGVyg

3112619,2007-03-30,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"In a nutshell:  go!  But take out a second mortgage first!  :-)

We had the chef's tasting menu.  If you think hoity toity restaurants don't give you enough food, you're gonna love Tableau.  Though I'm not a huge eater, I have earned enough remarks on how such a skinny guy can eat so much.  By the time we're done with all seven courses, I was completely ready to throw in the napkin, if not actually throw up in it.  Everything was very good and there were only one or two rough spots, though it won't be much of a stretch to forgive Tableau for those.

The amuse bouche was a mouthful of white bean and bacon soup.  Too bad it was an amuse bouche 'cause we've loved some more!  The first course was a ""club sandwich"" of smoked salmon w/ dill cream, paired with a tiny cup of white onion soup topped w/ a dollop of creme fraiche, both with a touch of caviar.  Mmmm... good!

Then it was grilled foie gras on a maple walnut beignet.  Here's one of the rough spot, if you can call it that:  they could have cut back a bit on the foie gras.  It was a pretty big piece.  Following that is another small rough spot:  seared scallops w/ frog leg risotto.  The scallop was *EVER* so slightly overdone.  Not enough to be chewy, but it definitely should have been more tender.  The frog leg risotto was the dish's saving grace, creamy, fluffy, beautifully seasoned.

Then it was the ""surf and turf"" portion of the menu:  black pepper crusted (yeah, I know, a bit cliche'ed) ahi tune steak on navy beans a broccoli rabe.  The tuna would seem a tad too salty, but was perfect when paired with the beans and the rabe.  The ""turf"" was a filet migon, again a tad on the ""healthy"" side size-wise, with sauteed pearl onions, atop two cute little oxtail stuffed canelloni.  Extremely clever!

By now, my wife was on the verge of passing out from all the food.  And she didn't even finish her tuna or her steak, leaving half of each.  And she's not a light eater, neither!  I was almost done as well, secretly hoping that the closing two courses would be either mercifully small or not so great, or both, so I wouldn't have to eat 'em all!

No such luck:  the ""fruit & cheese"" course was a pear walnut tart, with a piece of a fairly smelly but oh-so-delish cheese.  The dessert course:  my word!  It was: Frangelico creme brulet, Godiva peanut butter chocolate mousse, and maple syrup icecream.  I have *NO* sweet tooth at all, yet I finished everything, that's how good the dessert was.

The fun touches were:  Tableau is accessible only through the ""lobby"" entrance to Wynn's suites: we were greeted with supremely appropriate doses of deference, respect, and helpfulness;  tiny low stool/footrest that the wait staff would position next to each woman, so she has a place for her purse;  a ""foodie"" wait staff:  out waiter had eaten at the fabled ""The French Laundry""!",OEKo94b5Dofy2TssYyn4zw,2,2,5,7VAsY2esy9IKQnnnVWHALQ

Portions are very large, so you won't leave feeling deprived.  A must try is their ricotta pancakes, they are dense yet light and have an amazing flavor - you won't want to eat any other type of pancakes after this.  Its the simple things that really excite me and I was practically knocked out of my chair when I ordered a sampling of toast and received homemade jams (and trust me you can tell it is fresh made).  The orange marmalade had the most perfect ring of orange rind that was never ending, someone had hand peeled that orange rind all the way from top to bottom without once breaking the peel, it was candied and caramelized to perfection. 
 I go to Tableau every time I come to Vegas, it is that good.  However, my recent concern is regarding the change in chefs, the original chef of Tableau has now opened Botero in Encore.

This was an exceptional lunch, but did run us about $100 total. I would highly recommend Tableau for a fantastic lunch (and an expected brunch just as good), but just realize you are at the Wynn and are paying for the service, quality, and ambiance.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,8sPxb4y44ehd5qOUyiE1UQ

3378296,2016-03-11,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"To determine how long it has been since I have enjoyed Tableau, the meal I was here for was dinner. Regretting the length of time that has spanned since this last visit, I notice they now only serve breakfast/lunch/brunch.

The hosts had made reservations here and even though this was not my original choice, I was looking forward to Tableau, as this was my first dining experience at The Wynn. At the time, this was one of the most elegant properties on the strip (and to this day, still is). I certainly felt somewhat out of place, but the service and company was exceptional, and didn't make me feel like the serf* that I normally am. 

A stunning dining room greets you as you walk in; the lighting was dim but not so much where you can't see the menu, the decor appeared to be in warm creams, with lively bursts of color on the seating throughout. We had a table inside, but the outside had a lovely view overlooking the pool. 

This was my first time trying beef carpaccio; as this was one of those 'try anything' dining excursions I'll probably never have again, and I don't think I'll find a similar dish in quality anywhere else. Forgive me for forgetting the remainder of what I had that night, but this appetizer still stands out today. 

I wondered what those adorable miniature 'chairs' were next to our own, and while the male host said it was a place where one could rest their legs after a long meal, the other host-a female-explained to me it's where a lady puts her purse. My clutch looked minute settled onto this, but it served its job well.

Based on the little I recall from dinner so long ago, I imagine Tableau really knows how to do an amazing brunch. Even with all the newer, high-caliber, celebrity-endorsed establishments that have popped up on the strip, I plan on making this a stop when I come back to town.

We browsed the menu and ordered several items for the table. I thoroughly enjoyed my salmon Benedict. An egg white omelet was also a success. The lobster fritatta was thoroughly disappointing as was their homemade ketchup. The granola with greek yogurt was quite good. Food came out quickly, which everyone appreciates after a long night.

3418725,2015-09-29,7,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"""Proper"" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Tableau. It doesn't hold a negative connotation, but the space definitely is reminiscent of an English tea party. Servers were prompt and attentive and very, very proper, and the setup of the sunlit room was classy and elegant. 

Trio of fresh juices: Red Deliciousness, Purify, Orange Zest:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zdiMak6UuWRV5AlvsB8_7A&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I was unfortunately allergic to one or more of the fruit mixes in these juices, but the other members of my party verified that these juices were definitely freshly-pressed. They also mentioned that these are healthy and do taste it, so if that's not your cup of tea, maybe go for.. actual tea.. 

Cream of cauliflower soup:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FdKXwBSOKe2aBqpIBQvKKQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
Per proper preparation, this soup was served via pouring at the table. It was thick, gloopy, and luke. warm. I had one sip and was so disappointed in the lukewarm temperature that it immediately became a miss in my book. I did appreciate the bits of toasted cauliflower and creaminess of the soup, but any soup that is lukewarm is a lost cause for me.

Chicken noodle soup:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nC5Jo6HDz4I6RpLxP2jkrw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
The temperature of this soup was slightly warmer than that of the cream of cauliflower, but it was still far from hot. The noodles were slightly overboiled, and the broth was too salty for my taste. 

Duck hash and eggs:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=StJ8amQAT9SBTS11CtBhMQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
The puff pastry on the bottom was rolled beautifully; it was flaky and melt-in-your-mouth despite being a little oily (as puff pastries can be expected to be). The duck hash was seasoned well, although I didn't get too much of a duck taste, and the egg balanced out the slight saltiness of the hash. I also enjoyed the roasted fingerling potatoes, as they added a cozy mealiness to the dish. 

White chocolate orange french toast:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mbPZyByuEpY0N7WRm4v9RA&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I love french toast, and I always itch to try it whenever I see it on any menu. After reading the rave reviews about the white chocolate orange french toast here, I was practically salivating even ordering it. When it was served, the presentation was beautiful and I was expecting it to taste as wonderful as it looked.. but it fell really short of expectation. The two pieces of bread were incredibly dry, and despite the beautiful browning of egg on each side, there was no egginess. I did get the orange flavor, but none of the white chocolate (and I prefer white chocolate to orange). Even plentiful syrup could not offset the dryness of the toast, and this dish was a crestfallen disappointment to me. It's possible it was just a fluke, but then it'd be a huge fluke.

Filet Oscar benedict with beef tenderloin, poached eggs, blue crab, and housemade sourdough muffin:
(http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=b4ZzfgTgNOQOMfyKJ9zabQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA)
I thought the pairing of beef tenderloin and blue crab was interesting, and it worked to a degree. The blue crab meat was slightly cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator, but the beef tenderloin was cooked a nice medium rare. The poached eggs had model runny centers, although the hollandaise sauce was a bit too watery for me. There was a lot going on with this one dish, and it's definitely something to dig into when ravenous rather than as an ending entree.

3555978,2018-05-29,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"A friend of ours recommended Tableau for a relaxing and delicious Memorial Day brunch during our long weekend in Las Vegas. The convenience of being downstairs from our room, along with the beautiful atmosphere and acclaimed food made it a no-brainer. We went down from our room and waited 10-15 minutes for a nice and shady table outside by the Wynn pool, which was a pleasant surprise on a holiday weekend when we expected long wait times. 

Unfortunately, from the moment we were seated, the service was disappointing to say the least. After being seated for 10-15 minutes, we had still not been brought water, asked for our drink orders, or even been acknowledged by a member of the wait staff. A member of our group had to get up and find a waitress to come to our table and take our orders. We ordered various meals, juices, and smoothies. We requested that one burger have the bacon on the side, informing the waitress of religious restrictions that did not allow the member of our group to eat bacon. 

From that point, it took another 10-15 minutes just to get our waters filled. Some simple juices and smoothies took over 30 minutes to come to the table. When the waiters brought our food to the table almost an hour after we had ordered, the burger had bacon inside of it despite our request. We told the waiter that we had ordered it with the bacon on the side, and he told us that the bacon was delicious and that it was the best part of the burger, and then left the table. We ended up eating around the bacon because we didn't want to wait another hour for another burger to be made. 

The food itself is the only reason why, despite the disappointing service, Tableau still deserves a chance. The burger with its cheese sauce (at least as much as we could eat around the bacon) was absolutely delicious. The fork and knife sandwich (picture attached) with the addition of a fried egg was a delicious vegetarian option, with several different kinds of mushrooms and abalone. The white chocolate French toast and the waffles were also satisfying, but not extraordinary. Some brunch items were not listed on the menu, so be sure to ask what they have available when you go. Despite the extremely long wait, we were not dissatisfied with our meals. The chai smoothie was refreshing, but very banana heavy so I would only recommend ordering it if you can handle a strong banana taste. 

After we finished eating, we were presented with another unpleasant surprise. When ordering, we had requested that the check be split into a couple different bills so that members of our group who were sharing items would be able to pay with ease. When the waitress took our order, she told us this would be no problem and she divided the orders into separate checks. However, when we received the bill (again, about 10-15 minutes after asking for it), everything was put onto one bill. When we asked the woman who brought our check, she informed us that our original waitress who took our orders was on break. We again had to wait a ridiculously long amount of time for them to split our bill, and once we provided our credit cards we again had to wait an inordinate amount of time to get our cards back. The entire process, from first getting seated at the table to getting our credit cards returned, took a total of 2 hours. 

As someone who stays at the Wynn/Encore properties frequently, and who dines there and enjoys their nightlife and events with regularity, I have always been impressed by their commitment to quality and to service throughout the resort. I have never before experienced such disappointing service at the resort, and I would like to believe that this experience was an aberration. Maybe if you're seated inside, you can get better service, but in my opinion you shouldn't have to sacrifice service for atmosphere.",cLulaB7D_bVG5u2Z9cJfKg,2,0,2,pGT0n3eV_x7WqI4c_Pv9bg

6) Coffee

The elk sausage was amazing.  No gamey taste, but full of flavor.  Complemented the eggs perfectly. Comes with their housemade ketchup (much more tomato-y in flavor than normal ketchup...but in a good way!).  Side of toast came with housemade preserves as well -- very yummy.

My peach pancakes came in a stack of 3.  Super fluffy and moist and topped with caramelized peaches, butter, and powdered sugar.  Oh and did I mention beautiful presentation?? (see picture)  They also did the most amazing thing and made sure that there were peaches between each layer of pancake! =)  That made my day. Side of bacon was also 3 slices.  Prepared to perfect crispiness.

Scrumptious breakfast and LOVED every bite.  But total came out to ~$75.  Hmm probably most expensive breakfast (of that size) I've had.  But then it's also Vegas =P",7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,2,0,4,C6PKRe5aEm9NMq0kVBr8mg

The restaurant serves breakfast (7:00 am - 11:30 am) & lunch (11:30 am - 2:30 pm) only. You can dine indoors or poolside/outdoor terrace if you choose. 

As for the food, top quality and well prepared. They also have a vegan menu. When I went, I had the blueberry pancakes, and a glass of orange juice. The pancakes were the best I ever had, and the OJ was the freshest and sweetest I have had in a long time. 

The place does get crowded, so if you don't want to wait around, make a reservation. The cost, it is located at the Wynn so expect to pay $$$. Because it is usually packed, the time between placing your order and the time the food arrives, can take up to 20+ minutes. So if you are in a hurry or extremely hungry, you might want to look elsewhere.

3784882,2009-05-19,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Yet another disappointment from Wynn. Much like the hotel itself, we thought Tableau was completely over-rated. We came here for brunch after reading all the reviews and were expecting great things, but were disappointed. We were seated outside, overlooking the pool, so that was nice. However, it was 100+ outside and the misters at our table were the only ones on the entire patio that weren't working. We actually waited for a good 10 minutes before our server, Evan even asked us what we wanted to drink. When I asked about the misters, he gave me a smart remark. We brushed it off and placed our orders.

I had the eggs benedict and the hubby had the kobe dish. The food came out in a timely fashion, but the food was sub-par for such a fancy restaurant. My english muffin was burnt and I couldn't cut through it with my knife. I ended up eating the ham and egg part separate from the muffin, which were pretty good. The kobe dish was just ok. Nothing special and certainly not worth the price tag.

Now back to the service. We weren't even checked on during the time we were dining. Our server was standing behind us and didn't even ask us if we needed anything! When we were done eating, we had to ask a different server to flag down our server, Evan, for the check. Evan didn't even return with our check; the other server did. Definitely not a 5 star dining experience. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this over-priced mediocre place. If you want real brunch, head over to Bouchon at the Venetian.

I came to Tableau for a brunch with my friend, knowing how beautiful the dining area was, with top service and amazing food. 

THE STAFF -

Knowing the Wynn is one of the most popular Hotels in Las Vegas, with the extensive reputable five star service, I just had to come here thinking the restaurant would be no different.  I think the security guards that helped me and my friend actually find this restaurant were more accommodating than the staff that worked here.  Although we did make reservations, we still had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, even though half the dining room was empty.

THE FOOD -

I ordered Tableau's parfait for starters but I said no peanuts because I'm highly allergic to peanuts; what do you know? There's a cashew in my parfait! Last time I checked, a cashew was a peanut. I didn't send it back because my friend wanted to eat it, but there is a lack in communication that I do not tolerate. 

My entree, I ordered the Tableau Breakfast, since nothing else was very appetizing to me on their menu. I asked for eggs over medium and my eggs were runnier than the Nile River, it was like soup and I just couldn't eat it. Big let down.  The Pastry basket that came with my meal was pretty cool, but it lacked anything I liked.

I think I only enjoyed the tea I had, which came in a cute little pyramid package! Very delicious tea!

A side note: You have to be dressed well to be seated; meaning, shirts are mandatory and you can't wear a swim suit without a cover-up.",1orfwtwIaqCbLgfs3W1i6Q,12,6,3,1IsLV83RxT7cGS1j7xl5OQ

4048007,2010-08-10,6,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Tableau had me at KOBE BURGER...

I'm not much of a breakfast/brunch person b/c I can't handle anything heavy in the morning. However, my friend was enticed by their signature ""Milk and Cookies Soufflé"" and wanted to dine there. 

After looking through the online menu myself, I was sold on the Kobe burger. What carnivore can ever turn down a good burger? Certainly NOT me...so we decided to come to Tableau for a late brunch during our Vegas trip.

Tableau is inconspicuously located in the Tower Suites of The Wynn where you have to walk through the casino and pass the High Roller area before you see a sign for it. If you're not familiar w/ the layout of the casino, it can be confusing, so make sure to ask one of the employees lingering in the area for directions. 

My friend and I promptly arrived for our 1 PM reservations on Saturday, 7.31.10 and were seated at a table overlooking the pool area. 

FOOD/DRINKS:
*Fresh Watermelon Juice ($6): Refreshingly light and sweet.  

*Kobe Burger w/ Old Bay Fries ($16): OMG--SO GOOD! The thick Kobe patty was perfectly grilled to a medium w/ a soft pink center topped w/ an ooey goeey melted aged cheddar, nestled against fresh ripen beef steak tomato slices, butter lettuce, pickles, crisp red onions and then sandwiched between a toasted homemade sesame bun. 

As I bit into the burger, I got a slight crisp from the toasted bun and veggies before my teeth sunk into the tender patty, which was so moist, that juices started to dribble down the bread and onto my plate. Since the bread was toasted on both sides, it held everything together in place just fine. The burger had the perfect combo of crispiness from the bread and lettuce, tender savoryness from the kobe, saltiness from the cheddar, and a slight tang from the pickles.

The fries were perfectly crisp and the old bay seasoning added a kick from red and black peppers, cloves, and all spice. The homemade ketchup was the perfect accompaniment; you can really taste the fresh tangy sweetness from the vine ripen tomatoes which added a zing to the burger and fries. 

*Milk & Cookies Soufflé ($10): It was ok and was nothing to write home about. I prefer my soufflé light and fluffy, and Tableu's soufflé was on little on the heavy and dry side. The vanilla ice cream was rich and smooth, and the chocolate sauce was thick and decadent. It was a great contrast of temperatures and textures, but again, I wasn't keen on the soufflé's dryness. 

SERVICE:
Our server was pretentious and not friendly. He never cracked a smile the entire a time and was pretty much gone after he took our order. He was only there to give us our dessert and our bill (after having to ask a busboy). I had to ask for my water to be refilled, which is pretty much a no-no at a more upscale dining establishment.

AMBIANCE/DÉCOR:
Classy; crisp white linen tables, a gold chandelier, and tan curtains draped against large windows overseeing the pool area. Tables are well spaced out to allow for a more intimate dining w/ your party and for ease of conversation. 

If you're looking for a nice, serene place for breakfast/brunch after a night of heavy drinking and debauchery, Tableau is the perfect place...",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,9,7,4,9tZNvddhnCnno8DEMck-Ew

I ordered the Vegetarian Orecchiette which was just the right size and the taste was fabulous. The pasta was done perfectly as well. Definitely something I would order again.  Some of the other items we also ordered were the Lobster & Shrimp Frittata, Kabocha Squash Soup, Duck Hash & Eggs and the Smoked Salmon Benedict. The soup was a hit .. nice flavor and just the right amount of creaminess. The Benedict was the only thing that was not good. The slices of Salmon were too thick and the sauce was tasteless. 

The reason for the three stars is the service, ,or shall I say the ""lack of service"" our waiter was very prompt in taking our drink order (which consisted of mostly coffees and teas) and it took about 20 minutes for the order to be delivered. Once we had the drinks, no one offered or came by with refills. Our water glasses were empty by the time we got our food and were never refilled either.  I was perplexed by this as the reviews I had read have raved about the service .. but when the check came it became very clear to me. Tableau automatically adds the Gratuity to large parties. So I am guessing that the server knew he'd get a certain amount regardless of what type of service he gave.

I made a reservation for brunch, but that didn't seem to do much good since we still waited 20 minutes for a table. Despite this annoyance, we enjoyed our food and our server was very pleasant, so Tableau still  warrants 4 stars. 

Many Yelper's posted pictures of peach pancakes, but they didn't have this on the menu. Instead, we ordered the Orange and White Chocolate French Toast, delicious. 

I read somewhere that Steve Wynn is now Vegan and for this reason all of the restaurants at Wynn and Encore have to have a Vegan/Vegetarian menu. I'm not Vegan/Vegetarian but I do enjoy that cuisine, so I asked to see this menu and I posted a picture of it.

I was torn on what else to order in addition to the French Toast. On the vegetarian menu there was an Eggs Benedict with a yellow tomato hollandaise sauce that really interested me. I'm not a fan of traditional hollandaise due to its heavy creaminess, but I also wanted real meat, not the fake sausage that came with the Veggie Benedict. So I asked our server if I could order the regular Eggs Benedict but substitute the yellow tomato hollandaise. She was happy to comply with my special request and my entree came out exactly how I wanted it. 

Another special item was their house-made ketchup. It still had seeds from the tomatoes and it was lighter in texture and taste than bottled ketchup.

Deep in the recesses of the Wynn casino, amidst the bustling shoppes and casino activities, lies this hidden gem. Having a friend who prefers a vegan diet brought me to search for Tableau. They serve breakfast and lunch only. They have separate menus for different types of allergens and another for vegan/vegetarian, so ask for them if they are a concern.

We ended having lunch at the bright and airy conservatory with pristine surroundings that was akin to stepping back in time --there was a sense of understated formality from the wait staff to the china to the ambiance. And the food --simple, sublime, scrumptious.

With the bread tray, chose the corn bread which I ate with big dabs of butter. The Pan roasted salmon burger with seasonal fries was just magical with their homemade ketchup, where the seeds from the tomatoes peeked with eagerness.  Eating for the most part gluten-free but not bound by it, I had to eat half of the burger bun, which was soft and delicate yet truly held its form.

The service was more reserved (coffee & cream was at the beginning and refilled towards the end) but not necessarily unwelcome. My vegan friend completely enjoyed her Oriccehette pasta dish.

It's become a Vegas tradition to grab brunch at Tableau on Sunday morning before leaving town -- brunch here is perhaps what I look forward to most, and is one of the few mandatory stops on the Vegas itinerary. 

What particularly stands out is the exemplary service -- the careful attention to detail throughout Wynn's properties finds no exception here. The staff addresses you by name and has a uncanny knack for making you feel as if you're their sole customer.

We order the Tableau Breakfast, which includes the pastry basket -- an assortment of freshly-baked pastries and jams that rival (or surpass) those found at any fine-dining establishment. The meal is filling and delicious and leaves nothing left to be desired. Coffee served is from Intelligentsia (perhaps the best coffee-roaster in LA). 

The atmosphere is unique in that you feel just as comfortable in boat shoes and a polo than in swim-trunks and a t-shirt. The tables are white-linen clad, and the space is beautiful and airy, with large windows that face the VIP pool to the east. The walk to the bathroom, through the marble-clad, tower suites lobby, takes you past several, rotating pieces of art from Mr. Wynn's private collection. I spotted a Picasso (authentic) just outside the men's room door. In fact the dining room's decor always reminded me of Picacco's, post 30's, expressionist works  -- not a coincidence, I'm starting to believe. 

Tableau (and The Wynn) is a respite from a town that can otherwise be tacky, over-priced and sub-par. I greatly enjoy spending time here and look forward to visiting for years to come.",gzss8P9Ia4q3_pca7MeprA,0,0,5,paM6IpTRaBmQcVt2g7kzEQ

What I tried? Their fresh juices, the Bloody Mary, the intelligentsia coffee, the steak Benedict and the duck hash. The duck hash was perfectly combined with a creamy cheese sauce inside of a puff pasty  topped with eggs any style you want. The steak Benedict had decadent crab meat hidden underneath which complimented the steak and bernaise sauce beautifully!

The smoked salmon was good but the eggs and hollandaise were soooo bland. Completely tasteless.  I must have read 10 reviews about how good this dish was and could not believe how bland it was.  I dine constantly in big cities so yes, the prices are remarkably high but I'm fine paying $27 for a dish if it is delicious but this was not.  It was so bland (except for the smoked salmon) and I wasn't fooled into thinking it was good because they gave me a ton of smoked salmon (and it was good not great smoked salmon).

Breakfast
Smoked salmon plate with Tableau potatoes on the side.
Salmon was extremely high quality, all the fixings on the side (capers, tomatoes, onions) were very fresh, the cream cheese was ample, bagel was perfectly toasted. Just delicious and priced fairly at $17. The potatoes were very unique --- gooey and crispy at the same time, never had anything quite like these. 

Lunch
Tomato bisque was AMAZING. Wonderful portion size, served with the soft fluffy bread on the side in the mini tin pot. The bisque really surprised me. And the crab cake sandwich with fries --- most places cheap out on the crab, load up on the fries. The exact opposite here. Excellent high grade crab, well made sandwich, and the fries were just enough. The flavor of the fries was excellent (love the spice they put on top of the fries). Again, very fairly priced for what I got.

Service was fast and friendly. For this quality, at these prices, in this ambiance, with this consistency, I need to bump it up from my previous 4.5 stars to a 5 star. Welcome, Tableau, to my rare 5 star club (

Bread
Very soft, fluffy, cute presentation.

Shrimp and scallop ceviche
Served in a martini glass with a small spoon. Great presentation. The flavor was outstanding and the portion of fish was generous. It was just delish, well done.

Tuna tartare
Now everyone had talked about this dish so I had high expectations. This lived up!!! Wow, I should have just done a double order of this for lunch! It was well balanced, very fresh, just spectacular. Not the most filling thing but it's all about quality not quantity, right?

Service
Attentive. When I asked for the check, I had about 90% of my iced tea left. With the check, she brought a plastic to go cup in case I wanted to take my iced tea to go (I did). Nice touch.

All around, very impressive. The only reason this is not 5 stars is that for a 65 dollar lunch, I still got hungry a few hours later. So the ""value factor"" isn't really there. But 4.5 stars for sure.",d6b5ZXQKR4BxKN6KY2c_7A,0,0,5,JgvE-EQ3tO8n5s5H37e4-g

The food overall was not bad, definitely pretty standard brunch. That being said, the food tasted no more spectacular than that from my favorite local breakfast diner. I understand that breakfast food is difficult to make unique but I was definitely disappointed.

We got two dishes: the eggs benedict and the vegan benedict. The regular eggs benedict was not very good. They weirdly used sandwich ham - a big no no to me. The bread was too thin and could not hold up to the sauce and egg. The vegan benedict was better. I had wished the smoked tofu actually tasted smoky. The vegan benedict was far from what I'd call a benedict but was definitely tasty. Copy cat vegan benedict is not hard to find so if that's what you're looking for, go somewhere else. There also was no sort of garnish and decorations to make the dishes look nice.

The rest of the menu is standard with little creativity. Other dishes include oatmeal, acai bowls, omelets and Continental spreads. I was definitely looking for something standout.

I was also somewhat disappointed in service for a Wynn restaurant. We made a reservation for 10:30am and were not seated until 11. The waiter was not very attentive to us either: no check ins or water refills. We even had issues flagging him down for the check.

The duck hash was really interesting because I am used to a poached egg with hollandaise and this was a cooked egg with a roasted tomato sauce. There is a generous portion of duck too. Really delicious. The french toast is one of the best I've had-- there are bits of candied orange in there which is a nice touch, but didn't taste too much of the white chocolate. But most importantly, the texture is spot on: crunchy on outside and soft and spongy on the inside.

Since we stayed in the suite for three nights, we were able to visit and sample Tableau's breakfast menu multiple times.

Most of the items were pretty generic (oatmeal, parfait, fruit platter, eggs Benedict, lox and bagel). But there were also a handful of items such as aged cheddar cheese, scallion waffles with pressed duck, pineapple coconut whole wheat pancakes, and strawberry shortcake buttermilk pancakes. 

The aged cheddar cheese and scallion waffles were the best waffles I'd had to date! Smothered in their perfectly sweetened blackberry sauce - sweet and savoury all in one bite. Crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside. I polished all 4 in no time. The duck was beautifully cooked but the sauce just wasn't for me (too salty - tasted a bit like straight soy sauce). 

Both pancakes were tasty but neither was something I would ever crave. Acai booster was a lighter choice I went with on my second day - reminded me of Jamba Juice (how do ppl feel full from this?). Smoothie like with a handful of berries and sprinkles of granola plus honey - refreshing and delicious. 

Bread basket - part of Tableau signature breakfast - house made Danish, muffin, croissant, and donut holes. Paired with house made jam, marmalade, and butter - thankfully refills weren't complimentary or I would have devoured another basket myself... or maybe two more. 

Service - depending on who you get - we felt totally pampered and catered to to completely ignored and annoyed. 

Overall - if it wasn't for the complimentary offer, doubt we would had visited it especially for the price point. But if you are looking to treat yourself and have a relaxing meal - make sure to ask for Vanessa to serve you!",8zXgNCkusOHMwh5Tj_8yCQ,0,0,3,7JMLrgTSkyZWj3I65UIOXQ

I'm all about their homemade ketchup lol I've had almost everything on the menu starting with the Spanish omelette to french toast. Their avocado appetizer is great but you need to order a side of chips to go with it. Tableau hash is yummy and I enjoy it more than the main which was eggs benedict. 

This time I ordered a chicken sandwich, poached shrimp salad, truffle fries and some avocado and chips. Right when I grabbed my sandwich, I found some lint on my fried chicken so I took it off. I was going to just eat it then I found more lint on the other side of chicken as it my chicken rolled on a towel or sweater. I had to ask the waitress to take it back. Lost my appetite so I did not order another dish. 

Waitress told me it must have been from towels and that they always sanitize the kitchen all day. Well... Still, there shouldn't be lint on my chicken sandwich. If there's lint lying around the kitchen because you sanitize too much, it means it is not sanitary.

A couple other points:
We had coat problems too. The hostess rested them on the back on our chairs but two of us were on a couch ah..guess I will use it as a Napkin.

Same issues with our bags--we were not offered a holder and other--much richer looking diners did. Who knows, maybe they only have 5 holders, but everyone who had one was in Haute Coutour for sure.

Service:
The service was great! They addressed us by our last names and were very welcoming. We had a great server, Armando, who made us laugh and really enhanced our dining experience. All the food came out in an adequate amount of time. Our server was attentive to our needs and checked in on us at the right time. 

Food:
The food was excellent! They had a separate vegetarian menu which was extremely inclusive and accommodating for my party. I ordered the Nautical Eggs Benedict, which was well prepared and refreshing. The hollandaise sauce was really great as well. I also ordered the crab cakes, and they would have to be the best crab cakes I've ever had. They also tasted fresh and not frozen. Furthermore, I order the juice flight. Although the juice flight was a small portion, I really enjoyed every taste. I felt super healthy and clean when I drank the juices. Another item I could not resist was the truffles fries. The truffle fries were okay, I've had better. Now, the thing that surprised me was the ketchup, hot sauce, and mayo. All those side condiments looked and tasted fresh and handmade/homemade. Lastly, I were served banana chocolate macaroons(?), and they were delicious! 

Atmosphere:
Great vibe! We were seated outside next to the pool and it was relaxing. We were under a nice umbrella. And there were misters but ours were broken. But overall, this place is ""bougee"".",d9s9wcyDRko5ElkskER7iA,0,0,5,7iluZCGAeS04nc709qvLvg

The food selections included such things as a sublime lobster salad as well as a rather rich, but oh-so-divine Kobe short rib (topped with whole eggs and Bernaise sauce). 

And the service was excellent. My GF and I shared the lobster wonton soup, house lox and bagel, and the lobster salad. They split everything and served it up in three courses. The lobster salad on its own has one fried egg (it's fried whole somehow with the yolk still runny), but when they split the dish, they fried up an extra one. Aww geez...that was so sweet :)

My first lunch I think it was our waiter's first day.  He refilled my CEO's Pelligrino with tap water haha.   The waiter also seemed quite awkward and nervous.   My second time there, our waiter was not very attentive.  I would expect a higher calibur of service from such an expensive restaurant like that.

Chicken and something- man, it was that unmemorable.  I do remember the chicken was dry and that the sauce was overpowering like a hoisin sauce.  Yeck.
Seared ahi- this dish was good
Lobster salad- great pieces of lobster, the rest of the salad was a little lacking in flavor
Clam Chowder- they put like 6 pieces of clam in a bowl and take a pitcher and fill in the broth.  It was weird...and not good.
Scallops and shredded beef- that was the weirdest combination I've ever had.  Gross.

Our first interaction with this particular staff ""Marie"" was one of the worse experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.

After we checked in with the sweet hostess, she told us we had a 25 min wait which we were ok with.  I asked her where we can grab quick coffee before we get seated and she directed us to the bar.  We walked over to the bar and attempted to sit down.  Before our butt was was on the chair Marie came by with a very awful attitude.  ""Are you just having coffee?""  ""Yes, may we?"" I replied.  She rolled her eyes at my friend and I and say ""sure, I guess,"" with great hesitation.  So I stood up and said ""it's ok, if you don't want us here, we will leave.""  We walked out.  Horrible right?  You don't like you job, quit!  You don't want to be nice, quit!  It's not my responsibility for your misery!!!

I waited for twenty mins until our table was up at which point I talked to the lady manager and explained the situation.  She seemed nice about it and assured me that she will talk to Marie.

Now on to the food. 

I  ordered the mixed greens which tasted fresh and the dressing was light rather than overpowering as most dressings seem to be these days. It allowed the flavor of the various greens to shine through. Afterword for the main course I got the wild mushroom tamales. They were moist and fluffy. The seasonings were just perfect, and the jicama on the side really hit the spot. These were the best tamales I have ever had, though to be honest I am not a tamale connoisseur.

However, the food and service are too good for me to pass up a 5 star (okay, if I could, I'd give a 4.5). My boyfriend and I came pretty hungry after our flight to Las Vegas and we're slightly disgruntled when we arrived to Tableau around 11 AM and heard we would have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. Luckily they said we could walk around and they could text our cell when a table became free. We walked around the hotel (which is very pretty!) and before we knew it, a table was ready. In fact, a lot of tables were open when we returned so we got to choose a nice table inside next to the window (it actually got pretty hot). Our server was very friendly and helped us choose what we wanted. 

We ordered (and don't judge how much we got):
-Tableau Burger ($24) - so-so, the meat was good but they caramelized the onions which my boyfriend wasn't a fan of. Any burger more than $15 makes me skeptical in general though. 
-Acai booster ($15) - really good but for the price, not worth. It comes in like a wine glass filled to the brim to give you an idea of how big it is. I did really like it though.
-Duck Hash and Eggs ($23) - quite good. I was stuffed by this point so saved it and ate it later and it was still very good.
-Steak tartare ($21) - my boyfriend really liked this but since I'm just meh about steak tartare, I'm not sure. It was good I suppose and a hefty plate size.
-Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes ($24) - pass. The crab cake itself is good and apples with it arent that bad but mixed with the caramel sauce, didn't think it worked.

Also, the complimentary bread they serve is to die for, my favorites were the honey corn bread and pumpkin spice muffin SO good! The blue cheese bread is also a good savory option. I'm telling you, you have to try them all!

I appreciate their decision to serve Intelligentsia brews, but to offer only a dark roast and decaf option is baffling. I prefer a light roast, medium if I have to - dark roasted coffee mutes the flavor of the beans and adds a bitterness that some find bracing but I find off putting. I still appreciated the brew, but it seemed a shame that I had to add sugar to a ten dollar cup of coffee, even if it was complimentary. I ordered the breakfast sandwich on a whim, but it fell short of my expectations as well. The bacon and tomato jam were top notch, but the brioche roll and fried eggs seemed ill conceived. For one, I prefer the bread for a sandwich like that to be crispy. Then, the fried eggs, delicately and carefully cooked in butter leaving a pristine white with nary a fleck of brown, were completely wrong for this sandwich. The perfectly runny egg yolk dripped onto my fingers and all over the plate, and turned the roll to a soggy mess.

Chatting on his Vertu in a strange language (something arabic I believe) I couldn't help but notice my neighbor's Constantin Patrimony Series watch flashing in the sunlight of Tableau's patio...clearly there was money around. When the waiter arrived to refill his water and asked if he could get the check the man pulled out a money clip, peeled off two $100 bills and said ""that should cover it"" before getting up and walking away...the man had ordered a fruit plate. Tucked away in the gardens and pools of the Wynn Tableau is both rich and beautiful in appearance, much like its patrons. Sure I didn't expect low quality from Steve Wynn, but to say the clientele of Tableau was ""well to do"" would be a vast understatement.

Arriving at 7:45am I was greeted by the gorgeous lobby and the gracious hostess who asked whether I would prefer dining indoors or on the patio. As the patio was amply shaded and most of the patrons were outside I chose the patio and was subsequently offered a copy of the Wallstreet Journal, New York Times, or USA Today to browse. Seeing the headlines regarding the USC upset, I opted for the USA Today (clearly indicating my status compared to the rest of the diners who sat browsing the Times or Journal) and chose a wonderful table half sunny/half shaded with a great view of the pool and gardens. Water was filled and the menu was delivered while the waiter went to get my coffee.

Browsing the menu I was instantly captured by the pastry basket and the Peach pancakes, but not being hungry enough for both decided to ask the waiter what was available in the basket. Approximately 10 items were rattled off including an apricot tart, apple scone, and nectarine turnover. When I asked if pastries could be ordered individually it was explained that these were 'petite' pastries and if I wanted to try only one it would be free of charge. ""A nectarine turnover and the peach pancakes, please."" ""Certainly, sir.""

While I waited for my food I stood up and roamed the pools and gardens. Approximately 20 people were present at the time, all dressed either business casual or semi-formal and all dining on items ranging from the freshest appearing fruits to pastries to eggs and sausage that looked incredible. When I returned to my table (my tableau?) my coffee was waiting along with cream and sugar/spelda/equal. No nutrasweet was to be seen and when asked I was informed ""Mr Wynn does not fancy nutrasweet."" Fair enough (for what it is worth, Alex also didn't have Nutrasweet but noted they could obtain it immediately if I desired.)

After approximately 10 minutes a fantastic yet dainty apricot turnover arrived fresh from the oven. Crispy, flaky, loaded with fresh nectarines it was the perfect opener to the meal and I'd have certainly enjoyed many more had I ordered the basket. Another 10 minutes and a laugh at the Trojans passed, my coffee was refilled once, and then my pancakes emerged from the kitchen.

Described in the menu as Ricotta Peach Pancakes with lime butter and organic maple syrup, nothing could've prepared me for these pancakes. Fluffy and light, airy yet moist, sweet yet savory and absolutely jammed with fresh skinned peaches, the dish was presented with a simple dusting of powdered sugar, a side-pitcher of warm syrup, and a dollop on the side that tasted like a fresh key lime dissolved in butter. Having tried Ricotta Pancakes only once before but any number of stellar pancakes in the past, this dish was a revolution and I truly sat and savored each bite. Sure, $14 for three pancakes is not a bargain, but $14 for breakfast bliss? That is a bargain.

When I finished my pancakes and resisted the urge to lick my plate clean my waiter arrived and asked if he could get me anything else. ""Perhaps a coffee to go?"" ""....don't twist my arm....how about another turnover too?"" ""Certainly, sir."" While I didn't tip $185 like my neighbor, I certainly wish I could have.

On my way out everyone was very friendly, from the other waiters to the hostess, making each guest feel like their visit was truly valued. I was even invited to return for dinner, but when I told the hostess we had reservations for Alex that evening she noted ""oh, excellent choice, perhaps some other time."" All told the meal was fantastic and on par with Bouchon in terms of quality, presentation, and service. Go early, sit on the patio, eat, smile, and enjoy the richness of the food and the clientele...even if you yourself aren't rich...sometimes it's fun to see how the upper crust lives.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,5,5,FmaHPplQDv9ys5grnrvNbQ

Disclaimer: I've only had the breakfast fare at Tableau.  The white chocolate and orange French toast is good.  An off menu pastrami and egg special was exceptional.  The only thing I was disappointed by was the Canadian bacon on the eggs Benedict which was a bit tough.  The portions are small.  No one is getting fat eating at Tableau.

While it is possible to walk in, Tableau is popular so make a reservation.  The yelp reservation app works well and we were seated immediately when we used it.  The hostesses have had things running smoothly every time I've gone.

If the weather is nice, ask to dine on the patio.  Unless an overweight Eastern European middle aged man is sunning himself in a Speedo by the pool, it only adds to the experience.  If the fat man is sunning, focus on your table mate or the smiling wait staff.",yVtv64u9c1pOIs-d9fbcBQ,0,0,5,XHSfHzx1lSDxb9LS4WD55g

Service: very attentive staff. Great service.

Food: very mediocre overall. The first day I got the frittata which was ok but nothing amazing. A little bland. Second time there I got the vegetarian eggs Benedict which was DISGUSTING. A couple of soggy pieces of wheat bread topped off with watery scrambled tofu and veggie sausage that tasted like it was warmed up after frozen. I rarely send food back and i sent this back. I thought Wynn was known for his vegetarian/ vegan choices but this menu needs to be revamped. Boyfriend got the Tableau breakfast which was good. Pastry basket was excellent.

We actually had a great time over some great food in this hidden little restaurant, until the bread fiasco.

We were seated in the atrium overlooking the pool area for our lunch. The atrium was full with about 5 other couples, but the rest of the place was empty. Quiet & cozy. A good break from the bustle of Vegas. Some Merlot, a bottle of Pellegrino, a pina colado (not for me, surprisingly). We were hungry and the wait was average, so as we waited, we noticed the small plates for bread. Thought it was odd that there were no pre-meal dishes. But no one else had bread so maybe it was just for brunch. 

I decided to indulge in a little red meat while I was out of town & had the filet of beef, which was a small filet mignon with mushrooms, spinach, crisped onions, stacked on a marinated bread. Wonderful and intricate. A perfect portion, unlike some Vegas meals which stuff you past walking capability. My guy had a lobster salad which he relayed was divine. Veggie stir-fry & quinoa as sides.

At this point, the table next to us asked for some bread for their party. The server came out with rolls in individual baking dishes... for the entire room... except our table. The table to my right was waiting for their dessert, and got bread. The table behind me was enjoying their entrees, and got bread. The table past the table to our left (which asked for the bread) had just been seated, and got bread. WTF!

My friend ordered the continental breakfast set which came with miniature pastries. It was really just okay for a $30 breakfast set. 

Tableau is tucked in the 1st floor near the guest elevator and the lobby. It's quite hidden. I will return again for the fresh juices and hopefully the new chef will freshen up the menu and food.",9Xc7vla9JStodqfaYdJTow,0,0,3,Ykvvw0He9qBy9RgppgnJXw

This spot is located in this executive lounge area. If you have to use the pisser, you'll understand how serious they take that label.

Anyways, I was hesitant a bit. I don't like to splurge too much for breakfast, maybe Bottega Louie, meh. Menu was limited but I said hey let's do it. Pretty good decision.

Our table ordered the eggs benedict, which delivered. The complimentary bread was clutch. 1v1 cannot be defeated by any complimentary bread, it just can't.

I ordered the waffles with that foie gras. At a +10 charge, I was worried about the quality of it, and well it wasn't the best, but for early brunch it was decent. The waffles blew me away, the batter was Aaron Judge clutch. The applewood bacon was applewood bacon, no rip offs here.

Service was cool. The opener did great, the actual server was alright but still left that 20% because of the first homie. Promote him!

the food was AMAZING.  i ordered the lobster bisque and the lobster salad.  i guess i was on a lobster frenzy w/a generous breakfast comp!  the bisque was very creamy and delicious.  the salad came with a pretty generous portion of lobster w/claw meat and all!  the fiance ordered the crab sandwich which was unanimously voted the BEST crab sandwich all of us ever tasted!  my sister and her family ordered the french toast and continental breakfast which really wasn't spectacular at all -- comparable to something u can get at IHOP but at a much higher price.

the service wasn't all too great until mr. steven wynn himself sat two tables away from us.  it was then that we noticed our waiter became MUCH more attentive and on top of his game.

the moral of the story is:
1) wear earmuffs if you're going to sit in the atrium
2) for brunch don't order the regular breakfast foods -- go for the gold!!

(If you're not a vegan or vegetarian, or you don't have a food allergy, you probably don't understand how profound that is, so just take my word for it. It's amazing.) Thank you, Mr. Wynn, for making sure your establishments' restaurants have vegetarian options!

I eventually settled on the vegan ""eggs"" benedict--in truth a scrambled tofu served on a circle of probably white toast (an approximation of an English muffin without any dairy products) topped with a really tasty yellow tomato ""hollandaise"" sauce. I typically don't like tomato, but it was good sauce :) I had gone with the benedict because as someone with an egg allergy, it's something I've never really had and may never have the opportunity to have again. I also had the side of marble potatoes, which was good, but a little more mundane than vegan ""eggs."" Mr. Piano had a real eggs benedict, which I mostly recall for the fact that I was inexplicably happy about the fact that the presentation for the real eggs benedict looked really, really similar to the presentation on the vegan version. I still don't know why it tickles me, but it does. Maybe because the parallel presentation is cute. I can't recall what the others had, but there wasn't much of anything left by the end, so it was probably pretty good. The only food item we might have had any problem with was actually a beverage--the coffee came out in a French press (we'd gotten a small pot to split between the three of us who wanted some) and had decidedly not been allowed to steep long enough. The first pour was kind of weak, and knowing that the grounds would still be partially in contact with the liquid while the pot sat, I suggested that we wait a bit and then try again, which worked a bit better than I thought. (I am more of a tea than coffee connoisseur, if I can be called either, but I had enough information to make a guess and got lucky.)

The setting is quite lovely--you can see into the courtyard and I believe the pool from the windows, and the chairs look hand-painted with their designs. It's kind of like what I imagine a little girl's tea party with dolls looks like in her head or would look like if she re-envisioned it in adulthood :) It's cute! The servers were also really friendly and accommodating--when they brought out the little treats at the end, the server suddenly remembered that I had mentioned my egg allergy and brought me out a chocolate covered strawberry since I couldn't have the little pastry treat :)

It is, again, a bit pricey (like all things in Vegas), but I'd probably brunch at Tableau again in a heartbeat if I even return to Vegas and have the opportunity!",tUsrdWOWjOGf_hTsjMKycA,1,1,5,_zABQo0A2kvrYHkKtYycdg
5806958,2007-06-23,0,Yp9w4nhUowBU_IS_StFXbQ,"Tableau offers American cuisine by chef Mark LoRusso. I've had dinner here once, lunch once, and breakfast four times.

The dinner menu offers a wide choice of New American cooking. I'd call it fancy but not flashy. Breakfast and lunch are much simpler, but with a few fancy touches.

The room is quiet and formal. Tables are widely spaced, with long white table cloths and a single orchid in a bud vase, and sprays of Phalaenopsis orchids decorate the room. Soft music plays in the background. Service is efficient and attentive. In general, service has been friendly and efficient. Sadly, my lunch at Tableau was an exception. When it was time for the check, my server disappeared. I waited and waited and waited, even looking for someone else to help, but with no success. I finally felt it necessary to go to the hostess, and ask what had happened. My server never returned; someone else brought the check.


** DINNER - TASTING MENU
The tasting menu is a good way to sample the best of what Tableau has to offer. I'm not much of a drinker, but decided to get the wine pairing as well.
* Prior to ordering, the chef sent out as an amuse bouche a small sample of cream of potato and chorizo soup. It was full of potato flavor, with a hint of chorizo.
* Osetra Caviar Trio. Each of the three items had a small amount of caviar on top: (1) a shot glass of potato soup, with creme fraiche on top, was thick and rich, served cold; good-very good; (2) traditional garnish of creme fraiche, chopped hard boiled egg and chopped onion, all in a china spoon; very good; (3) a scallop cooked on the medium side; very good.
* Crab Minestrone. A clear soup with zucchini, beans, and lots of crab. The soup had a lot of flavor, the zucchini was crunchy, the beans were firm, the crab was sweet and firm.
* Tasting of Foie Gras. A medium thick steak served on creamed corn. The foie gras was seared on the outside, and had a good flavor, but wasn't as good as at the top places in town.

This was this point at which I realized the generous wine pours were getting me drunk. I would drink only a fraction of each glass hereafter. However, it was too late. I would fall asleep several times. I think the server caught me once (""Sir? SIR?"").

* Pan Roasted Halibut. The fish was firm, cooked through but still moist. Outstanding flavor.
* Prime Filet. The steak was good, but nowhere near as good as at SW Steakhouse.
* Camembert. Nutty, bitter. I'm not a Camembert fan, so I rate it Fair.
* Selection of Desserts: (1) Roasted banana ice cream had a strong banana flavor; very good. (2) Vanilla pot de creme was like pudding, but so much better. (3) Chocolate souffl was not the best I've had, but was still very good.

Overall, a very good meal indeed. Beware the generous wine pours!


** LUNCH
My only lunch at Tableau was a Dungeness Crab Club Sandwich. In lots of little ways, it was executed very well. The sourdough bread - all three layers - was nicely toasted and had very good flavor. It was firm enough to hold up as a triple decker sandwich, but still soft enough to be easily bitten through. The crab meat was plentiful and tasty. In addition, there were avocado slices, sprouts, sun dried tomatoes, and bacon. Somehow or other, I was able to eat this sandwich without having the contents spill out all over the place. Spiced French fries were served on the side, and were pretty good. Well done!


** BREAKFAST
My breakfasts were:
* Banana French Toast, made with raisin brioche and a layer of mashed bananas. The french toast was very good - crispy on the outside, soft inside. However, I thought the banana flavor was too strong, overpowering the rest. Chicken and apple sausage was surprisingly good.
* Banana Ricotta Pancakes with Walnut Honey Butter. They were light to medium in texture, with a moderate banana flavor. They were pretty good, but not special.
* Poached eggs and duck hash. This was actually part of the weekend brunch menu, but I ate early. The dish consisted of 2 poached eggs on top of a hash of shredded, slightly crisp duck meat, and fried finely diced potatoes. It was delicious.
* Kobe short ribs and eggs. Two very attractive stacks, each consisting of: a round, thick, fried potato cake, greasy but good; shredded braised short ribs (very good flavor); gently cooked scrambled egg; a small amount of tangy barnaise sauce. It's very, very rich, but excellent. My favorite breakfast at Tableau.



When I first ate dinner at Tableau, I knew I had just had a very good meal. The food wasn't flashy, but it was very good. Lunch was also very good. Breakfast was a harder sell. I think that part of the problem is that I'm very pedestrian in my tastes with respect to pancakes, French toast, and the like: keep 'em plain, just butter and a little syrup. I had a similar reaction to the highly praised French toast at Bouchon. As long as I stay away from sweet starchy breakfasts, I've been very happy with Tableau.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,3,0,5,3nuwqEyF4FTzIYCd72236w

We ordered vanilla lattes to start. I love the fact the latte was accompanied by a decorative rock sugar on a stick if we needed to enhance the flavor of our latte. 

It was my first time actually trying eggs benedict and was delighted to have tried it at Tableau. I tried both the traditional version which consists of an english muffin, shaved country ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. I also tried the filet which also consists of an english muffin, beef tenderloin, blue crab, and chive hollandaise. I think I liked the filet eggs benedict better because of its delicious blue crab and beef tenderloin.

We didn't have a reservation, but were seated within 20 minutes.  It was a beautiful day and we had a table right by one of the open windows looking out on the pool. The hostess placed a tiny stool next to my chair for my purse to sit on. This was neat and strange at the same time, but nonetheless a nice touch. 

Our waiter was a bit of an odd character, just in a general sort of way. He wasn't too attentive either. I had an omelette with fontina, mushrooms and caramelized onions. There was too much cheese and onions for my liking. The potato cakes that came with it were delicious though. The toast, even though I requested it sans butter, was still enjoyable. My husband had the elk sausage and poached eggs and seemed to enjoy it.

Of course, my girlfriend is the quintessential breakfast freak.  Spending a few days with her at the Wynn/Encore resulted in an obligatory breakfast trip.

I researched the Wynn's website in order to devise an escape route, and I found it.  It went through a frenchy-breakfasty place called Tableau.

The menu looked exotic but reasonably priced (especially by Vegas/Wynn standards).  Even better, it featured breakfast items that weren't some concoction of carbs and pig.  I immediately made a reservation for Sunday morning.

The place itself is beautiful.  It seriously feels like a setting for a tea party from a fairy tale (in a good way).

We split a tuna tartare appetizer, while I had the Duck Croque Madame and my girlfriend had the Pastrami and Eggs.  

The tuna tartare was some of the best I've ever had, and the portions were more than generous.  The duck croque madame is certainly my new favorite breakfast food (and possibly favorite food of any kind).  The pastrami and eggs were good also, but overshadowed by my dish.

Throw in a couple coffees, and the bill still came to be less than a hundred bucks.  An absolutely astounding meal at a very reasonable price.  This was possibly the highlight of my entire time at the Wynn.",Fg_7ryqQo4nYXy_uWMIUXA,5,0,5,tzmSmccvMxeBE3CLPfdJng
