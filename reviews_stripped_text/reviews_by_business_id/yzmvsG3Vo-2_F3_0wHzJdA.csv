The place has seating capacity of 91 so it's pretty big for a local breakfast joint. They also have seating outside. 
I ordered the corned beef hash with poached eggs and my partner ordered Yo Hala on the square. My dish was good but I've had better. The Yo Hala is a different story, it was my first time trying something like it so I didn't have anything to compare it to. All I know is it was the bomb!!!

Glad I took the chance and went it, excellent breakfast - highly recommend the San Francisco Eggs Benedict.  Here's a tip you'll thank me for - get the grilled onions on top of your hash browns.  

Also, if you are lucky enough, you will get waited on by Chelsea.  She is extremely personable, knowledgeable and excels at making you feel welcome in this great feeling Diner.

You will not be disappointed by visiting this awesome establishment. I truly appreciated management stopping by my table to inquire on my visit as I was able to give feedback on my wonderful experience.",BLFYDGfL7zRnw951hKxfPA,0,0,5,NKLy8i36FKTgibmc9sehBg

Reuben sandwich to try; glad they'd serve it anytime, but it was ok according to my husband. I had 1/2 chicken waffles. Unfortunately the chicken was too salty! Temp hot with their syrup & regular Louisiana hot sauce. The service is excellent  They rectified bill error.

Had the chicken and waffles and made me wonder how the hell they made the chicken so nice and tender. I was kind of hesitant of the waffles with the strawberry butter cuz im not a fan of sweetness, but it actually perfect. The hazelnut coffee and their sweet peach tea was really good too. I love the fact that we can take drinks to go! Especially cuz the peach was awesome to my taste buds! The servers were on point too. They were very nice and  really helped us out.

Then I moved to Jacksonville Beach and ate at the Metro Diner on the Beach. I was very excited to find out that Metro opened up here in Vegas. I ordered biscuits and gravy with a side order of cheesiest grits. Although I enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, very generous portion. The grits had no flavor at all! I think the team needs to be retrained on preparing grits. I love good grits and coming from Florida I wasn't expecting them to be really good, but these were tasteless. I will try other items on the menu, I really want this place to do well. Being from J'ville it is nice to have a place from home. The staff was very friendly and very helpful!

Unlikely other eating places where one finds some items 
way overpriced, some priced right, and some are bargains,
the owners of Metro Diner have priced NO ITEMS as an
overpriced pick, or a bargain either. IMO ALL ITEMS are
close to or right on the mark as to what Las Vegas diners
will tolerate.
That said, it comes down to selections and the taste of
those lections. Here too, Metro Diner rates a middle of
the road rating IMO. A little bit salty and average flavor.
Inferior places, but not by much, IMO, are Black Bear
Diner and IHOP. Superior places, but not by much, IMO
are Village Pub and most Strip Buffets.",MPlMQddB2VlkpE7DtxJh9Q,0,0,5,uEk0H7LjLpe6bfvxpAqwUQ

We had a group of 6 and fit easily into a booth, so very family friendly.  I ordered Charleston Shrimp and Grits and they thought there were no more grit cakes so they asked if I would like a substitution.  I ordered regular grits and the dish was delicious.  Halfway through the manager came with another full order, stating that they made new grit cakes for me - amazing service, memory and thoughtfulness!  

We had the worst shrimp and grits ever at Eat earlier that day - I couldn't eat more than one bite, and the Metro Diner shrimp and grits were one of the best I've had.  The rest of the party loved their meals - meatloaf was like mom made, Cajun chicken pasta, blackened shrimp with black beans, etc.  Tomato bisque - yum!

What Metro Diner has accomplished with their menu is fancy rooted in fundamentals. And it works SO well!! We've all heard of chicken and waffles. It's been done plenty. Metros version brings it home with the hot sauce maple syrup and strawberry butter. Sounds like a head scratcher but it's well thought out and over the top delicious. Another example is their vanilla coffee. It's not sweetened with syrup. The vanilla is brewed into the beans (I think). However they do it it's great. I drank it black.

1138971,2017-09-15,0,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,"We have a standing weekly luncheon at Juan's Flaming Fajitas and we noticed this diner across the street. Based on the positive reviews, we ( 3 of us) decided to try this place today for some ""comfort food"". We arrived at 11:30 so it was not too busy. The girl at the podium asked if we'd like a booth we said yes and she pointed to the booths and  that was the end of the interaction. We walked over and sat ourselves in a booth. The waiter was the most positive part of the whole experience. He answered some questions and took our orders. We ordered bacon & eggs, eggs benedict and a pork sandwich with onion rings. The pork sandwich was specifically ordered without cheese. The breakfasts arrived followed a bit later by the pork sandwich covered in melted cheese. The waiter assured us he submitted the order without the cheese and went off to get a new sandwich. We had to eat our hot breakfasts while our friend waited for his new sandwich. At some point a woman who we assumed to be management came over and explained how you get used to making things a certain way and sometimes special orders get messed up. She then told us a story about a car crash on the 215 at 5:00 a.m. that morning. We assumed she was making small talk in hopes we would not notice how long it was taking to get a new sandwich. It would have been nice for her just to introduce herself and apologize and go find out why it was taking so long.......it felt more like she was telling us requesting no cheese was the root cause of the error. By now there were no other occupied tables and pretty much the entire staff was milling about in front of the kitchen area. Finally the sandwich was brought to the table without the onion rings - the waiter said they would be ready shortly. REALLY???? (I forgot to mention the .50 upcharge for the onion rings). At this point our friend requested his food be packed to go WHEN the onion rings were available as he was no longer in the mood for us to sit and watch him eat. The onion rings finally arrived in a to go box. I was finishing up my bacon & eggs when the waiter came back and actually said ""I hate to interrupt your meal and I'm not rushing you but can you please settle the bill now because the manager wants me off the floor right away?"" So I put my fork down and got money out to pay the bill which did have a credit for the pork sandwich and onion rings. This was not even close to the lunch experience we were hoping for at this diner. If I'm going to pay $30 + tip for  2 breakfast dishes and 2 soft drinks in this city, it sure won't be here! Very disappointed after all the positive hype on the reviews.

Place looked clean & quaint. We ordered a philly steak and fish & chips. The philly steak was good but very light on cheese. We were told cheese is expensive. I didn't care too much for the fish. I should have asked what kind of fish they used. It was some kind of cat fish and the batter wasn't to my liking either. We were never offered refills on our soft drinks. My husband had to ask & there seemed to be a slight hesitation from the waiter in getting a refill. (Maybe there's no free refills on soft drinks?) When it came time to pay we paid our waiter & asked for change. To my utter shock & horror he returned and said he was short 75 cents. Believe me it's not the 75 cents but the principle. When did it become acceptable to short a customer money?!  Is this not a business where money is transacted? So why doesn't this establishment have money to give me as my correct change? I feel so badly for these inexperienced kids who aren't trained properly at their job or life for that matter and make these  errors that end up costing them in the long run. Well we shorted him in his tip. Hope he reads this and learns a lesson. Always give customers the correct change. Metro diner wasn't that good to back especially when waiters keep your change.

The shrimp were perfectly cooked in a tempura like batter and the aioli had just right amount of spice. The complements stop there. The tomato slices (2) on this large sandwich were paper thin, the shredded lettuce had a brown tinge and the roll was very dry/stale. Mac-n-cheese was dried out like it had been sitting exposed for a while. 2) The chicken salad sandwich...the chicken salad (alone) was good, nice and fresh. The bread was dried out/stale. We took the salad off of the bread and ate it separately. The pasta salad had very hard spiral pasta on top as this had been dished out and prepped hours ago.

The reuben had WAY too much thousand island dressing on it. Literally, it was soaking through my bread, and was a huge mess to eat.  It completely took any flavor away from the corned beef and sour kraut.  The coleslaw didn't have enough dressing, and was a bit bland.  My boyfriend ordered the juevos rancheros, and there were hardly any eggs on it, with an excessive amount of cheese.  It seemed more like an order or nachos than juevos rancheros.

So, the worst part of my dining experience was towards the end of my meal, when the waitress dropped an entire pitcher of iced tea next to my table, drenching me.  She did hand me some napkins, and said sorry, but I couldn't believe we weren't offered a discount or a manager's apology or something.  It was just treated like a no-big-deal thing.

I was kind of weirded out by their signature sauce because they literally put a sauce in front of you and dump syrup and Louisiana hot sauce in it. I wasn't really a fan of it. The waffle was delicious. The strawberry butter was delicious. The chicken was super crispy and cooked perfectly on the inside. Super juicy. My only complaint is the chicken was ridiculously salty. I couldn't finish it because there was no flavor to it. It just tasted like pure salt. I was so sad because it was so crispy and juicy. I really have never had a chicken cooked that perfectly!

Those words are printed on the front of the menu.  Since I'm a local, I guess I should eat there!  I had read good reviews and heard wonderful things about this restaurant.  When I was invited by Stefany V to have brunch, I immediately jumped at the chance.  

I had arrived on a Saturday around 10:30.  I was able to get seated immediately for the start of my dining experience.   I noticed that on their giant specials board hung on the back wall French Vanilla Coffee was their brew for the day.  My black coffee with vanilla flavor was delicious.  I always love a great cup of coffee.

Stefany and I decided to split the Charleston Shrimp & Grits along with the Heuvos Rancheros.  Oh man.  Two choices that I am thankful for.  Both dishes are very large.  Even with being split by two we still had leftovers.  Shrimp & Grits is one of my favorite dishes to eat.  The grits are made into two fried cakes infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and andouille sausage.  It's then topped with a gravy like sauce with shrimp, sausage, onion and peppers.  It was creamy and popping with flavor.  I recommend this desirable dish ten times over.

Our first plate of Huevos Rancheros was missing the egg.  But they were quick to correct their mistake with a new plate delivered in no time.  Their version reminded me more of Chilaquiles.  The tortillas surrounding the mound of ingredients were fried like a large tortilla chip.  It was perfect to pile on the toppings of chorizo, black beans, onions and peppers.  Of course there were your normal salsa, cheese and sour cream topping as well.  I did love how they used tempura battered jalapeños.  That gave it a nice kick and crunchiness. 

We received attentive and friendly service from our amazing waiter.  I had a top notch experience at Metro Diner.  I hope to be back soon for more!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,11,8,5,_J4846WAEL-sIY7FWdpjrA

1827293,2017-05-05,0,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,"Was so excited because Metro Diner opened up near our home, and I was craving a good homemade meatloaf. After hearing the slogan ""where locals eat"", we heightened our expectations and headed to eat here on Monday. 

The location has great decor and atmosphere, with checkered floors and big booths. Business was perfectly busy (steady, but not overcrowded), and it smelt like heaven when we opened the front doors. We were immediately greeted and sat down very quickly.

The menu is extensive with so many home-style options. I felt overwhelmed because everything sounded so delicious, and everyone around me really seemed to be enjoying their meals immensely. 

I came with my boyfriend, and we decided to order three entrees and three sides. We settled for the meatloaf plate, the chicken pot pie, and the pastrami sandwich on rye. For sides we ordered the onion rings, the mac n cheese, and homemade potato chips (meatloaf comes with mashed potatoes & gravy too).

Everything came out together looking delicious, and steaming hot! We were so excited to eat we started attacking the food without direction. I went for the meatloaf first and absolutely adored it. I had asked the server to request the chef burnt my meatloaf and they actually listened!  My meatloaf was burnt to perfection, and one of the best meatloaf plates I have ever tried. 

The mashed potatoes and gravy were a perfect side, and I almost forgot I had two more entrees, and three sides to try! My boyfriend was loving the Pastrami, so I went on to try the Chicken Pot Pie. The top crust stayed dry from the gravy making it a perfect accompaniment to dip into the sauce/chicken/vegetable melody. It was cooked perfectly, and an entree I would recommend/order again.

I went on to try our three sides. The homemade potato chips were seasoned perfectly, and not overly oily. The Mac n Cheese was creamy and extremely hearty, but perfectly flavorful. The onion rings were under-seasoned and really boring....I would much prefer fresh onion strings! 

I snagged a bite of the Pastrami sandwich from my boyfriend, and pressured him to try the meatloaf. He ""highly dislikes"" meatloaf, and I was excited to hear his critique. He actually enjoyed it, and commented on how the burnt edges added a great texture element (score!). The Pastrami was soooooo delicious, and I understood why my boyfriend was hoarding it. We continued to munch till we were overly full, and could not even consider the dessert menu. 

The table next to me got the Grilled 3 Cheese Sandwich with added tomato, and it also looked phenomenal. It was oozing with cheese, and toasted golden. I would consider ordering this next time, as well as trying the Monte Cristo or Pittsburgh Steak Salad. 

The Monte Cristo is ""Fried sourdough sandwich stuffed with turkey, ham, cheddar and American cheese, topped with powdered sugar and served with raspberry preserves and your choice of side"". Sounds like heart attack waiting to happen, but executed to perfection and truly looked worth the indulgence. The Pittsburgh Steak Salad sounded up the same alley, being mainly a steak frite & french fry affair. 

Overall amazing experience at Metro Diner, with awesome ambiance and killer food. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their dishes! 

When you think diner, this is what you should envision (not Dennys, Ihop, Applebees, Chilis, etc;) Bringing back old school ambiance of fresh food, affordable pricing, and great service.

They make menu suggestions, offer constant drink refills, and generally anticipate your needs very well. I've experienced a few errors with billing and orders but they're typically resolved quickly and with a smile. Management is visible and they're happy to talk about the company and expansion plans. Expect 4 Vegas locations by 2018!

2nd star: Their famous chicken and waffles. Thick, beautiful waffles topped with an amazing strawberry butter and accompanied by a huge, juicy half chicken with a delightfully crispy skin. This would be my go-to and it can easily serve two.

3rd star: Shrimp & Grits and Huevos Rancheros, my other two go-to dishes. The S&G is their own take on the classic dish, with fried grits patties topped with a tasty cream gravy and ample shrimp. The HR is more of a chilaquiles dish with crispy tortilla chips, lots of salsa and sour cream, and crispy fried jalapenos. Don't forget the over-med egg!

4th star: The rest of the menu is huge, from sweet french toasts (Yohala!) to salads, sandwiches, and dinner entrees (Ma, the meatloaf!). It really does meet their ""where the locals eat"" motto, offering dishes for every time of day and every preference. Always check their specials board.

Almost every single review that I read mentioned the amazing service and I gotta tell ya... They were correct! The service was ahhhhhmazing! My server today was Finn and she was totally on point! From refilling our drinks to checking on us about the quality of the food to getting us to go drinks because it was really HOT outside today to giving up extra napkins to well pretty much anything else that you would expect. She was right there! 5/5 and the hostess was on point as well. She greeted us right away and when I asked for booth... They only had one open since it was 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed... Another person promptly jumped in and said... I'll go wipe it down for you guys right away! And literally within an minute or 2... We were sat with menus. Such great service!

My bf ordered the all American burger which came with a mayo based lettuce slaw and pickle spear on the side and a side of Mac n cheese. He said he wasn't hungry but he scarfed that thing like it was going outta style! He ordered it well done... He said they it was still very juicy which to me is mind blowing cuz anytime I've ever tasted a well done burger.... Well they normally are like trying to swallow sandpaper. Dry and scratchy. Which in my book is always YUCK. But his was juicy and seasoned just right and that's why it gets a 5/5. And the Mac and cheese... To die for!! So creamy! 5/5

I ordered the chicken and waffles dish and it comes with a sweet and spicy sauce... Little did I know that it was made table side... Finn came by and explained what it was...Their Maple syrup with some of the Louisiana hot sauce mixed in... And then proceeded to make it at the table for me to do my chicken in. So cute! I ended up adding more of the hot sauce... And it was a perfect condiment to my chicken.

Onto the chicken...ok... It's been a while since I had chicken and waffles at Roscoe's in Cali... But I gotta tell ya... The chicken here was pretty darn close! It was crunchy on the outside and omg so juicy and flavorful! If I had to guess... I'm going to say that they brine their chicken cuz it had so much flavor and the juice just leaking out of the meat! 5/5 I will definitely be back to get this chicken!!!

The waffles on the other hand were not that great... They were crunchy on the outside but it lacked flavor even with the strawberry butter. But really I didn't care at this point cuz the chicken was like WOWZA!! 3.5/5

I also got the sweet and spicy chicken tender sandwich. This a perfectly cooked chicken tender on a house made biscuit! This biscuit was to die for. It was so crunchy on the outside and yet so fluffy and soft in the center! And yes the chicken was amazeballs as well. Very crunchy on the outside and so juicy and tender inside. Totally get it again. 5/5

It was a very cute little joint. They had a black chalkboard that had their specials on it and their specials rotate from breakfast, lunch and dinner. And their kitchen was open as well so if you wanted to you could look in and watch them cook. As we were getting ready to go...I sat one of the staff members cleaning the floors with a wet Swiffer.  Very clean but it did get a little loud at points... But hey... Good food always seems to draw up more lively conversations! Lol 5/5

There is outside seating with fans but it's definitely still too hot to enjoy this facet of the diner.

Pulling up Metro Diner had odd branding to me. The sign and large awning outside was in art deco style which you don't see too often in Vegas, but I believe was a nod back to the Floridian origin of this chain. 

Walking in through the first set of front doors the hostess was holding open the second set of double doors welcoming us with a smile. She sat us immediately, introduced our waitress by name, and talked about some of their specials for the day.  It was such a nice greeting first thing in the morning.

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and made it vegetarian by subbing avocado for the chorizo, my husband ordered the Corned Beef Hash and we both split a short stack of pancakes.  At first glance the menus seemed pretty pedestrian but what came out was not so at all.  The Huevos Rancheros was served with a choice of eggs (scrambled) over fried tortilla shells, with black beans, onions and peppers and topped with melted cheese, salsa, sour cream, and fried jalapeños.  The fried jalapeños were such an interesting touch; still crispy from the fryer they were spicy tangy and delicious.  The presentation was very eye catching.

The Corned Beef Hash is made in house and served with diced red-skinned potatoes, two poached eggs and toast. My husband said the corned beef was very good but only wished the potatoes were more crispy. Otherwise he liked it a lot.

The portions are huge, honestly with the three dishes we ordered we could have fed 4-5 hungry people.

Thanks for the great recommendation Yelpers!  You guys delivered.",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,1,1,4,1uBfbbTSgDFNXd6_gSAmaA

I had to give an additional shout out because last time I was there I got the Bissell (a lot of food for $11) with a waffle instead of pancakes.  The waffle comes with powered sugar which I am not a fan of but isn't a big deal.  When one of the servers saw me tapping the waffle on my plate to get some of sugar off and asked if I would like a new one.  I declined but the kitchen staff went ahead and prepared a new waffle for me with no sugar with out me asking.  Now that is service!,KlU35KQ1_D5XOhM7Yjjvdw,2,0,5,c3Hoe46et4xadAAhyc-3rg

The French dip you can get at Arby's is much better than what I got here, and much cheaper as well. The gravy on my mash potatoes was very salty.

I never found a chicken and waffles dish that I have actually enjoyed since Roscoe's in Compton, so that's what I'm gaging this review on.  The chicken is so freshly made.  Juicy on the inside and crunchy and savory on the outside.  The waffles are buttery and so delicious.  They even serve it up with a sweet and spicy sauce, I'm not a fan of that flavor so I passed.  I tried my daughter's eggs Benedict and it was also different in a good way.  The hollandaise sauce seemed homemade, with no separation and enough to stay creamy and tasteful.

First off the place is a bit smaller than what I expected. Capacity is only 91 with a outside patio.
I ordered the Cinnamon Raisin French Toast ($8.49) topped with pieces of pecan, and it came with 4 good size pieces.
The coffee was very good and bottomless.
My friend ordered the special of the day which was Meatloaf ($12.99). It came with 2 good size pieces with mashed potatoes and some veggies.
It may not be the cheapest place but considering the quality of the food and decent portions I believe it's worth the price.

Glad to see a great really lovely and great place come to Vegas. To many places are overpriced and lacking in food quality and portions.

Will be back to try some of the other things on the menu.

Or even the chicken and waffles. 
They all sounded so good and were very reasonably priced. The only thing I saw that was more than $15 was the chicken and waffles and the amount of chicken they serve with the dish is fairly large.

Overall, a solid 4 star experience.  Only problem I see would be the pricing.  IMO, the prices are high for what's offered.

Ordered iced tea - no lemon.  Came with lemon and had a sour taste. Looked at the menu and asked if the sourdough breakfast sandwich comes with grits or hash browns. Yes, so I order it. Tried putting into tablet twice with tons of questions (do I want butter on my toast?  It's a grilled sandwich?). Then I go to wash my hands. Upon return - oh, the sandwich doesn't come with a side.  Would you like to add this?  No. I'd prefer a server who knows the menu and can answer my questions. Grr!

Side note:  food was still tasty and the guys behind the line are fun & friendly. Always check on how your food tastes and smile. 

========================

So I had a great experience here for breakfast and have had a few lunches here, too.  I tend to eat dinner a little late and they close at 8pm nightly so I usually skip this place for dinner. I was close by and early tonight though, so I decided to give it a try. 

Well - not my best decision. Tonight's experience was a HUGE disappointment.  I'd have given it one star - but when you sit at the counter you get to interact with the guys in the kitchen.  They're always super friendly and strike up a conversation with you while they cook up your dinner. 

On to my experience tonight - primary issue was poor service but also a little bit on the food.  

Was greeted by the hostess who had a great smile and was super friendly. I asked to sit at the counter and she reminded me there were specials I could read on the wall before sitting down. She came over after I sat and offered to get me a drink. She immediately got my iced tea and told me my server would be right back. 

Suzanne came over and introduced herself as my server.  She seemed friendly, too. Couldn't decide between meatloaf or turkey, but she recommended the meatloaf so that's what I ordered. I also asked for a side salad with ranch dressing to start.  I was told the meal didn't come with a salad. I said I understood and wanted just a small side salad to start.  Well, the meal came - salad never did - after the entree arrived I wouldn't have wanted it anyway.

Fast forward to the end of my meal. I'm completely finished - flatware on top of the plate and no leftovers - and Suzanne asked if I wanted some dessert. I didn't, so she left to go print my check. She returned - I gave her my credit card - she went to run my credit card and came back. Four visits now, right?  Well after all four stops, she never thought to remove the dirty dishes.  Pre-bussing the table is like Server 101.  I mean, really, the lady at Chick-Fil-A bussed my table at lunch today.  I didn't have to throw away my fast food trash.  But tonight my server came by FOUR times and never bothered?  I can look the other way once or twice, and I'm understanding of a server in the weeds cause I've been there, but the WHOLE PLACE only had four other tables.  Sorry, not ok. 

On to the food. Ordered meatloaf, mashed potatoes, veggies, and bread. The meatloaf had a decent flavor. It's pre-made (of course) and then reheated on the flat top grill. It could use a few minutes more on the grill to get good and hot (the center was kind of lukewarm).  That wasn't really the issue though - it was the texture of the meatloaf. I can't figure out if it was loaded with fillers like bread crumbs, or if it was just over mixed. There was no ""meaty"" texture to it - kind of like the meat had been puréed.  It reminded me of a pâté.  Again - the flavor was good, it was just mushy. The veggies were fresh and perfectly cooked (not mushy, not raw) and the mashed potatoes were decent. I thought they needed a little salt and pepper, but that's an easy fix. 

Maybe it was TOO slow and the servers got complacent. Never seen this there when it's busy at breakfast or lunch.  I'll try it one more time; you should too. Keep your eyes open for my follow up review.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,0,0,1,hsdC1_GhAR25wPS5-rDdEw

I ordered the a veggie wrap, my friend ordered a veggie wrap with chicken, and I order Mac n cheese & chicken tenders for the kids. My wrap was so delicious.

This location needs to increase their portions other wise people will go else where.

2902560,2017-07-20,2,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,"I loved the retro feel in this diner, especially the black and white tile flooring!

When we walked in, someone from the back shouted at us to choose any open spot. We usually prefer booths so we chose a booth. I liked that we could choose our spot. There were already menus at our table, which I also liked. Our waitress greeted us quickly after we sat down and got us our waters. 

She asked us if it was our first time and since it was, she informed us of their specials and what not. That was nice. 

I almost ordered $20 worth of food just for myself but she helped me get what I wanted for half the price by showing me a different option on the menu. I wish I caught her name. 

I ordered the Bissell Breakfast it came w/ bacon but I swapped for sausage links, 'home fries', 2 over-easy eggs, wheat toast, and a short stack of pancakes that I swapped for 2 slices of their croissant french toast. Everything was really good!! Probably the best diner breakfast food I've ever had in Vegas. I've never had a croissant french toast before but I'd prefer all the future french toast I consume to be made w/ croissants. 
I asked for peanut butter for my wheat and french toast, it costs an extra .50 cents or something, which is kinda lame since lots of other diners offer unlimited PB for free. PB is a necessity as much as syrup to me for breakfast!! 

My boyfriend ordered the Bold City Burger with regular fries. We saw his burger was ready several minutes before my breakfast plate and would have preferred that they have brought it to our table right away instead of letting it sit there for such a long while. Anyways, the meat was cooked perfectly, medium rare, but I do assume it all would have been better if we were given the burger and fries right away. All of it was room temperature not fresh and super warm like my breakfast was. 

In my opinion, they close hella early! At 8pm?! If I lived closer, I'd definitely frequent this diner as long as I could make it before 8pm, though I rarely ever eat dinner before 8pm.",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,4,6,4,kFIb55te8VryquHnTEJWYw

I'm so glad that my friend wanted me to try this place! So that's what we did today after work we headed down to the lovely Metro Diner,beautiful place inside and out. Very clean, very shiny and most of all very cozy! Our server Ricky was amazing. He was warm and polite with just enough personality to take the cake for one of the best servers I have had the joy of dining with. He explained everything on the menu and suggested great choices. He wasn't lying when he said the creators of Metro Diners menú know what they're doing with food. We started off with the flavored tea of the day which was Mango. Unsweetened it was already so good,lots of flavor.
He suggested the special of the day which was the chicken quesadilla ! Omg the quesadillas flavors was something I had never tasted. Secret ingredient was olives! I know, what the heck are they doing in a quesadilla but I have to say it was a 10! Unfortunately not something on the regular menu but so glad to have tried it, ask and I'm sure they would be glad to make it. Another thing I really wanted to try was the Spicy honey chicken biscuit. Living in Texas for 3 years really made me appreciate a good chicken biscuit. This sandwich was the hands down best! When you take a bite the flavor of the honey and the spice overwhelms your mouth with how great it is, and no im not over exaggerating. I ordered that with a side of mac and cheese and gravy. DIP the biscuit in the GRAVY! You will not be disappointed. Ugh this place is so good I'm mad I didnt have room for dessert. Ricky had no problem getting my friend to take a banana cheesecake to go.

A server promptly arrived and offered us water and provided menus. When the water arrived the menu was was explained along with the special of the day that is listed on the chalk board.
The restaurant is nicely decorated and has a choice of booths and tables. There is also an outdoor patio that is shaded in the afternoon.

The menu has a large selection for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Our choices were the Pot Roast and the Shrimp and Grits. Both turned out to be large portions. 

The Shrimp and Grits consist of two fried grit cakes infused with cheese, roasted red peppers and Andouille sausage. Topped with shrimp, sausage, onions and peppers in a shrimp sauce. Garnished with chopped bacon and green onions. This rendition is different from the typical southern version but it's a great stick to your ribs meal. 
The Pot Roast is a delicious roast slowly cooked, served with veggies, (carrots and onions), mashed potatoes and covered in its own flavorful juices. This is a very hardy meal.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,2,0,4,EdLSKidoR433Q7Zhj5nKLg

I'm talking about the meat in the chicken with none of the skin or batter.  I don't even know how they managed it.  My husband couldn't even eat it.  They also brought a half chicken (1 breast, 1 wing, 1, drum stick and 1 thigh), and the waffle piled up in 4 quarters... all crammed into a plate that would not have fit the entire waffle if it wasn't cut into quarters.  I had to move most of the chicken onto the plate they brought with the syrup container just to create enough room to cut a piece of the chicken.  My husband ordered the corned beef hash.  It was flavorless... which is hard to do with corned beef.  I think they didn't season the potatoes, so they sucked up all the flavor.  I know it was bad when I asked my husband about next time and he said he was never planning on going back.  He grew up in a third world country, so he would eat anything.  This was a first for sure.

3517483,2017-08-28,4,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,"There's plenty to like at this diner out of Florida. My favorite thing to date has been their fried chicken and waffles. The texture of the waffle was great -- light and crispy, just like I like it and the chicken was so tender and juicy thanks to them brining the bird over night. The crust is nice and thick and well seasoned. It's a huge portion with half a bird, so plan on sharing.

The crab cake benedict was really good, too. Lots of crab meat with a modest amount of filler, fried and topped with eggs with a side of home fries. Also popular is their Charleston shrimp and grits. They take the grits and form them into blocks that are fried, then covered in gravy and shrimp. It's mighty tasty with just enough spice to let your taste buds know they're there. It's filled with plenty of shrimp and overall a huge portion size.

On the sweeter side, they have different types of stuffed French toasts. The ""Apple yo halla"" was available on our first visit. It was like a cheesecake sandwiched between challah French toast topped with fried apples.

With a second location recently opened and ambitious plans to greatly expand their empire, I can only hope that they can maintain the high quality food at each spot.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,8,4,e6mahcRirwvU_JHj5a7urg

I ordered the Crab Eggs Benedict... the Benedict part was amazing- it had a tasty sauce, a nice crunch on the bread, and the egg perfectly poached. The hash browns that came with it were actually shredded potatoes and they were so deliciously moist and flavorful.

My bf ordered chicken and waffles. The strawberry creme that they serve with the waffles were very appetizing. The dipping sauce of syrup and hot sauce makes the taste to a whole level. We also ordered Three cheese grilled sandwich to go. The portions are very large for the price and we did not walk away feeling hungry. 

The waitress is friendly. We had a big piece of fried chicken and waffle left on the plate and she forgot to ask if we wanted a box. She took the plates away and later we realized it and went to ask her. The manager who was standing next to her is nice and made a new piece of chicken and waffle to go.

At the end of the call we were not given a total, but I assumed it wouldn't be more than $20, there is no way, right? When we got there to pick up the order, the diner seemed very busy. Everyone was very kind, said hello, and whatnot. We gave her the coupon and she said ""OK, this coupon brings your total to $32"". I think my husband almost died lol. I myself thought I miss heard her. No it was true, it was $32 with tax including $10 off for two entrées that did not come with any sides such as hashbrowns, eggs, bacon, etc. I was hoping and praying that this food would be so delicious that we would both forget how much we just spent on breakfast. The chicken that comes with the chicken and waffles were huge pieces, the coating was very tasty, but the chicken also came with bones. It was as if they took a whole chicken, added a meat cleaver to the situation, and cleaved the chicken into four pieces. The waffle was a regular sized tasty waffle, but have you ever tasted a gross waffle? The sweet and spicy syrup that comes with the chicken and waffles was very good! Now for the stuffed French toast, which has a really weird name that I can't remember, where do I begin? The French toast pieces itself where OK. The filling of bananas and cream cheese was OK at first, but got to be way too much very quickly. I totally forgot I had the blueberry strawberry compote which is a good thing because it would've been complete overload if I had remembered it. It came with a total of one slice cut in half, but it was stuffed. Maybe it wouldn't been too much sweetness if we had a piece of sausage or some hashbrowns to eat with it I don't know...
We have eating there one time before and had ordered the poundcake French toast and the monte cristo. The fried pound cake was  tasty, but also very expensive for just getting the fried pieces of poundcake (Sara Lee brand, bought in a bag NOT made on site). My husband is the one who ordered the Montecristo being that he had loved it from a different place a while ago we took maybe a bite each and couldn't eat it because it was so plain. We wanted to like it so much but the prices are just insane and to scale with strip prices.

As the 3 stars indicate it was A-Ok, but probably not worth the 27 mile drive from my house.  However, I will be the first to admit that we got sidetracked by the Specials board from our original plan of ordering the Monte Cristo and Chicken & Waffle.  Always trust your first instinct, people!  

We arrived around 10 AM on Mother's Day and were pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  It was a beautiful morning, so we took advantage of the patio seating.  

John picked the Benedict Florentine ($10.99) from Specials board and was not impressed.  He didn't care for the hollandaise sauce and felt that the eggs were over cooked.   

I ordered a Western Omelette ($10.99)- ham, cheddar, onions, tomatoes, and peppers. (86'ed the mushrooms).  It's topped with salsa, which seemed like Pace picante sauce to me.  To be honest, I'm not sure that it enhanced the omelette and would recommend getting it on the side before committing.  I ordered fruit as my side ($.50 up charge) and it was perfect.

Our service was very good, although we found it odd that our server Marylu had to step away a couple of times to answer a cordless phone to take carryout orders.  Quite the multi-tasker!  We also really liked that they bring a tablet to your table to pay your bill so you don't have to hand your credit card over.

In a short time, the breakfast arrived.  The server asked if I needed hot sauce or anything for the omelette but that was already in a holder on the table.  My coffee had already been refilled so the server was on the ball.  The only thing needed was some extra butter in the grits and a bit of salt on them.

Those that know me know that I prefer to eat breakfast dishes all day every day.  It was just a matter of time before I finally got to check this breakfast bookmark off my list.  Metro Diner is a hit with locals and it's not uncommon for there to be a wait. I attempted to dine here about a month ago, there was 3 groups ahead of me, and I didn't want to wait.  I finally had the opportunity to dine here last week on a Friday afternoon.  The parking lot was full and the restaurant was busy.  There was plenty of tables open and I was immediately seated.  Metro Diner's menu is extensive.  They're known for their Charleston Shrimp & Grits, the Fried Chicken & Waffles, and the Bold City Burger.  I know what I want and it was their special...The Meat Lover's Omelet.  This meal consists of 3 large eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage. The meal also comes with toast and grits.  In my opinion, the grits were a little too salty for my liking.  My omelet was good and highly recommend.  I thought that the portions are average and the prices just a tad higher than the other breakfast joints in town.  The highlight of my first experience at Metro Diner is the service.

Metro diner has a tone of different food options for everyone in your party. I was craving potatoes and waffles and my fiancé wanted French toast. Upon entering the eatery we were greeting with a smile and the option to sit anywhere we liked.

After only a few seconds our waitress stopped by to get out drink order and tell us all about their top items on the menu.

I ordered the massive order of chicken and waffles with a side of house fries and my fiancé ordered the  enormous order of biscuits and gravy.   

Everything was delicious  and I had plenty of chicken and waffles left over after sharing.

We ordered it to go (yes I know breakfast isn't a to go meal but with two kids 5 and under...) with a phone call since it's literally down the street. They told us 20 minutes. I sent my husband and he ended up texting me 20 minutes later saying that this keeps happening to us. What happened was that he was waiting and they were so busy (which was a good thing I suppose since it means they are delicious) but they forget about him. When they finally remembered him they had given away our fried chicken and waffles. I told my husband to just leave since it was just ridiculous that he already waited 40 minutes (20 min at home and 20 min there) and they gave our meal away. 

Well I got to try it this weekend after deciding to give it another chance. I got my fried chicken and waffles and the fried chicken was juicy and there was plenty of it to share with my littles. I do admit that I loved the strawberry butter and I wanted to slather that on everything I could get ahold of within reason.

The place was  pretty busy too. 

Our server was Marylu (if I remember correctly) and she was great. I ordered coffee which was tasty(I'm picky on coffee) with the Bisell breakfast platter. I was happy with my order. The pancakes were perfect. Bacon crisp. Eggs fluffy and hash browns were tasty, along with a generous amount of toast. My wife, on the other hand, ordered the Pound Cake French toast with a side order of in house made corn beef hash. She wasn't too pleased with the pound cake, it was dry and it didn't resemble French toast. In her opinion. The corn beef hash was a bit of a disappointment too. It was dry to me, and to her it wasn't all that great. For being made in house, it didn't wow us. That's why I took off one star.

The Shrimp and Grits is not what you're used to. Instead of loose grits, they're shaped into patties and breaded. The patties sit in a white gravy with different things mixed in.

I googled it  I watched the show from 2010.  They featured a dish called Yo Hala on the Square.  I decided that I needed that.  

Arrived in Vegas on Sunday and Metro was on the schedule for Monday's first meal of the day.  When you're on vacation the first meal may not be before noon but, fear not, breakfast is served all day.  These are my kind of people.  

The restaurant is clean and bright.  There were plenty of open tables and we were seated immediately.  Our server, Nick, showed up promptly.  Specials are listed on a blackboard.  Between that and the menu, choices are difficult--a tough problem to have--but I already knew what I would be getting.  My friends perused the menu with the understanding that they would each be getting a portion of my food because it sounded like the best thing that ever got invented...food-wise.

We felt so welcomed there.  Both managers stopped by the table to ask how things were.  Nick was never too far away and came back often.  He liked us and, make no mistake, we loved his service.  Everyone seems to enjoy conversing and bantering with the customers.  We were laughing so much with them I don't know how we were able to eat.

The food was dynamite.  We all oohed and aahed over our huge and beautifully plated dishes and each enjoyed our choices very much.  I couldn't finish mine.  I'm told that most people can't.  Mine was the big hit of the table.  Of course.

I have to admit that I grabbed some local friends and brought them back there the next day because I needed to try other things.  I was laughing so hard when everyone came by to welcome us back.  Nick was there but he was leaving for the day so he couldn't serve us but he definitely stopped by as if to catch up with old friends.  Our server on this day was Jaci (pronounced JayCee).  She is so sweet and delightful.  I tried the avocado breakfast sandwich.   After I had ordered, the table next to us had received a Monte Cristo sandwich.  OMG that looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.  Then, another table got a French Dip sandwich.  That looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.    That just means I have to go back again on my next trip.  

Prices are reasonable and our service was peerless.  It's a friendly place and, even if the food weren't as excellent as it was, I'd still give it a great rating because I had so much fun just being there.  Ask for Nick or Jaci as your servers.  I'm sure the others are very good but these two are exemplary and will add to your overall enjoyment of the experience.

P.S. The place has only been open a few weeks so I suspect that anybody who did not have a great food experience could chalk that up to the kitchen staff getting up to speed and finding their stride.",lFHgGgzQregebvt-cD1X6g,0,0,5,vWp16r6Qf4nogaVvqmSJxw

The portions here are so big! That is why I needed to come here at least twice to get the scoop on the new diner in the city. Las Vegas doesn't have too many diners so Metro Diner coming to town was a welcomed treat! 

My first trip I was drawn to the chicken and waffles with the strawberry butter! This entree could easily be shared. I ended up taking half of the chicken home . The chicken was crunchy and the waffles were fresh! I could tell these were not Eggos there was no freezer taste to them . In the syrup they put a little Louisiana hot sauce to give it a sweet and savory kick to it.  I would definitely get these again! 

I was full but not too full for dessert so we ordered the salted caramel brownie. It had drizzled chocolate and caramel syrup topped with some vanilla ice cream. 

Today I went for the Shrimp and Grits for some southern comfort . This meal sticks too your bones. It would be perfect for a cold winter day. We don't see those type of days often so I ate it when it was 111 degrees outside . It was still good! The gravy was rich with pieces of crispy bacon, shrimp, andoule sausage, peppers, mushrooms, and green onions. In the middle a short stack of crispy grits. This can also be shared because of the portion size. It's bigger then what you would get at Lola's.  I ate everything around it and took the rest home because I had to save room for dessert. 

We had the apple cobbler which had thick apple slices in it. You could tell it was fresh because the apples were not soggy or overly soft. 

The staff is super friendly and the food is a good value for what you get. If you want breakfast for dinner they serve breakfast all day! My only wish is that they made Fried green tomatoes!",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,27,25,4,aoDEl3DU2VOesWfucRLY9A

As an old-school breakfast diner, it's as good as it gets.  So if you are expecting something else (like a place that specializes in egg white omelettes with basil, a thin slice of avocado and an aoli with finesse), this isn't it.  If you want old school eggs and taters and pancakes, then this is where to go.

My wife had beef patty and eggs combo breakfast.  I tried her beef patty, it was properly cooked, good quality beef, generous size, and seasoned nicely.  I stole a second bite.  She said it was one of the best diner breakfasts she has had, and they handled her eggs the way she asked them to without having to ask twice.

I had Huevos Rancheros.  They were unorthodox, but the best I have ever had, period, and I have been all over northern Mexico, Arizona, New Mex, California.  Just try them.

Omg. Great tasting, filling, and pleasurable comfort food. 
Came to see my parents that live here across the street, saw this place on Yelp so we gave it a try. Super glad we did. 

My mom who eats out all the time said this is the best breakfast she's ever had. I also travel a lot around the country and eat out and Metro has to be on my Top 5 now.  Reason is the food is great as well as the service. 

THE FOOD:  We got three dishes: Biscuits and Gravy, Corn Beef Hash and eggs and Fried Chicken and Waffles. All three were phenomenal. Seriously. I was impressed. 

Their Biscuits and Gravy blew my dad away. And he's a picky person. Very fresh biscuits, with a rich flavorful topping of gravy. 
The Corn Beef Hash is made in house. Super fresh and good. Went perfect with the poached eggs. 
My Chicken and Waffles were freaking good. Perfectly battered chicken with fresh, soft waffles. Got to mix the syrup and hot sauce just right to get the right final touch! 

THE SERVICE:  Monica was our server.  She is super hip and cool. Lot of energy and very attentive to your needs and attention to detail. We never had to ask for anything. She recommended the Chicken and Waffles. Glad she did! 

The the ladies up front were also very warm and friendly as soon as we walked in. As someone who works in the industry I know how hard this is to do on a daily basis: to put on that smile and be warm and friendly with the guests. Sometimes it can be discouraging for them seeing the severs make all the tips they do, but hopefully get appreciated in other ways and continue the warm greetings.

After a few visits, my favorite dish is unarguably the Fried Chicken & Waffle ($15.99). The order comes with half a chicken, super crispy and very moist, and a fluffy Belgian-style waffle. Plus, their strawberry butter (it only comes with this dish, but can be purchased for 50¢) and tasty concoction of Louisiana hot sauce and maple syrup dubbed their ""signature sweet and spicy sauce."" The whole dish is magic. Fantastic fried chicken, great waffle, and wonderful condiments. I have to actively stop myself from ordering it each time.

Charleston Shrimp & Grits ($17.49): Fried grit cakes with cheese, roasted red peppers, and Andouille sausage. Topped with shrimp, sausage, onion, and peppers, bacon, and scallion in a creamy shrimp sauce. WOW. The grit cakes are great and everything is so flavorful. It is a very heavy dish though, so I'd recommend sharing and ordering another lighter option.

The Holy Davoli Burger ($13.49) is another killer dish, but really, approach with caution. It's a burger with two loaded grilled cheese sandwiches in lieu of a bun. You already know it's insanely bad for you, but daaamn, it is so, so delicious. I took two bites and called it a day (it was Ruben's anyway, lol).

Pittsburgh Sandwich ($12.99): Smoked pastrami, provolone, fried egg, fries, cole slaw, and tomato. Their sandwiches and burgers are seriously crazy. CRAZY GOOD! Another Ruben selection and we both enjoyed it. The bread does give out pretty quickly from all the content's moisture, so I'm thinking maybe toasting?

Yo Hala on the Square ($12.99) is their stuffed French toast featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. It has a lot going on from banana, cream cheese, berry compote, and syrup, but it's scrumptious! It's not my type of dish as it is rather sweet, but I wouldn't mind a bite!

Biscuits & Sausage Gravy ($9.99): Their biscuits are fantastic (fluffy with a nice exterior crust) and the sausage gravy is the way I like it - the right consistency, great flavor, lots of sausage, and a touch of spice.

I just tried the Chicken Pot Pie (Jumbo; $11.49) and I wasn't a fan. It sounds pretty standard from the description, but it was very different from your classic pot pie. First, the chicken was seasoned, baked, and added on top rather than cooked with the dish. Second, the concoction of vegetables and cream, though good, did not have that beloved chicken pot pie taste and it was strangely thick. This part could've been a kitchen mishap, but it was not super creamy as if it was overwhelmed with roux or overcooked.

The Pittsburgh Steak Salad, Pot Roast, and Garden Salad were decent/just okay dishes. I wouldn't mind eating the Pittsburgh Steak Salad again, but I would order the fries on the side (since I like my fries crispy).

All of my experiences have been great, with my most recent visit being an exception. I've only ever visited during busy mornings, but this time I came in between lunch and dinner. There were only two other diners there that were wrapping up when we arrived. Our food took over 30 minutes. No one visited us during this very long wait to explain or apologize. It didn't even seem like our server knew it had taken that long. I asked for the check shortly after receiving our food and upon dropping it off, we were told to ""take our time."" Yeah, I would have loved to take my time, but we didn't get our food until 45+ minutes after we got there. So, we only had 30 minutes to eat and it was an uncomfortably rushed meal.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,5,4,fzhhmO0iTPSi09CVYAJqCQ

It was really tough what to chose here.  I wanted to try so many things.  I went with the chicken and waffles, especially because that strawberry butter looked so inviting!  

The Chicken and Waffles was amazing! It is a large portion with enough to take some home.  The fried chicken was really, really good.  I suggest if you don't like the waffles combo just to order the fried chicken.  

I would love to go back and have it again.

The homefries were HUGE!! And very very good!

Grits were hard...my only complaint. Even so, The 30 min drive was well worth it and I cannot bring myself to visit any other bfast joint in town after Metro.  

Hannah...or was it Shannon? Either way, super friendly server who explained the menu and specials and was overall very friendly. 

They have packets of jam, preserves, and marmalade at the table, as well as standard ketchup, salt, peppa, and Louisiana hot sauce.

We live in Rhodes Ranch and was actually trying to go to the newest location on Rainbow, but were at the Lowe's on Trop and got directed to this one...didn't even know there were two locations.

I'm super big on customer service, especially where I'm spending my valuable time and money.  In this town, it really counts because there is so much competition.  

We were greeted quite warmly and the friendliness just escalated....from the hostess to the waitress.  The manager made a point to come over to ask us how was everything, but he engaged us in a friendly sincere conversation. They all made us feel very very welcome.

The food is AMAZING!!!! My husband had the best Chicken and Waffles outside of Los Angeles' Roscoe's where they originated.  They give you real pieces of half a chicken and not just breast or tenders like most here.  His waffles came with strawberry butter that had small bits of strawberries.....YUM YUM.

I had the Charleston Shrimp and Grits....OMG!!!! It was absolutely delicious.

Unfortunately, we just went to the Rainbow location which has only been open about a week.  We had an absolutely great hostess and Richard the waiter.  However, the manager talked to everyone around us, looked my husband in his face and never ever engaged with us while we were there.  So, needless to say, I will NOT be going back to the Rainbow location although it's a straight shot from where we live.

Oh forgot to mention the delicious cobblers.  The first time we had the apple and last night we brought a strawberry one home.  If you have not tried them you have not enjoyed the entire Metro Diner experience.

First review:
Went here for breakfast for the first time with my Hubby. Had been hearing about it and the choice was Metro Diner today!

It was great to just being able to walk in and be seated, we appreciated that.

Everyone was friendly and smiling. We were excited to try. I ordered the Challah French Toast, it came with sausage,eggs, biscuits and cheese grits. I was confused why I got two starches, French Toast and a biscuit. 

Waitress forgot the syrup, and was MIA for a while so I ate it without. Was bummed on the Challah, tasted like regular French toast.

Everything else was ok. Maybe I was believing the hype, I will try them again with dinner and see how that goes!",91OffSkHKrOu9x76iD7Teg,1,0,5,KLnBEqb96Z43X9WP54WuWw

It was interesting to say the least.  The sandwich was very dry, and although it wasn't a bad sandwich by any means, it was just ok.  The bread was WAY to thick, and flavors didn't really go together very well either. Their menu prices are more of a dinner price. For breakfast and lunch, they are VERY expensive.

Another pleasant surprise was the Biscuit and Sausage gravy $9.99 Gravy was deliciously on point! Comes with 2 eggs and your choice of hash browns or home style fries. The fries could've used more flavor though. 

Crab Benedict $13.99 was fresh with very little filler. The addition of a little heat was a welcomed surprise. Hollandaise sauce was light and very tasty.

This, its first west of the Mississippi serves diner staples along with contemporary takes on Southern diner fare.  Comfort food it is. 

The space, unassuming, warm, friendly, comfortable. The food matches the ambience.

This ain't diet food. Butter, fat, cream, copious amounts of salt all used with no apology.  Large, stomach filling portions of stick to the ribs food that will leave you smiling and satisfied.

Beginning with the chicken and waffles, crispy, moist, gently oily fried chicken (and entire half) piled alongside a crispy, gently sweetened, thick waffle.  Spreading the accompanying strawberry butter over the waffle makes it great, adding their sweet, hot sauce over the chicken with some extra maple syrup, fantastic.

The meatloaf, a classic preparation with some fillers, cooked in the oven, sliced thick and griddled, a heaping scoop of buttery, creamy mashed taters slathered in a brown gravy, greasy, seasoned, sauteed summer squash and a few slices of non descript baguette to mop it all up.  Creamy, fatty and all the right ways, aggressively seasoned.  Zero complaints.

The biscuits, flaky yet moist. At a ladle of peppery sausage gravy all over. Oh yeah.

Finally the shrimp and grits. While I prefer creamy grits to cheesy, crisp fried grit cakes (I'm spoiled by the creamy grits in Charleston), I'm not complaining. Grit cakes are plenty moist on the inside and compliment well when drowned in a creamy, rich, gently spiced gravy containing Gulf shrimp, spicy andoule, and peppers.  Chunks of bacon add the All-American finish. Solid.

Friendly off Strip service with a smile.

5279267,2017-03-27,5,yzmvsG3Vo-2_F3_0wHzJdA,"Originally opened in 1992 in Jacksonville Florida and described as ""Where the Locals Eat"" ever since, it was entirely by accident that it was discovered that Metro Diner had recently expanded to the Las Vegas Suburbs, ongoing discussion about who was doing a 'true' Monte Cristo Sandwich in the local market bringing up results for a familiar name just a few minutes away that had not been there just last month.

Not to be mistaken for Metro Pizza, though both they and the Diner chain now with nearly two-dozen locations show a similar commitment to Scratch-made classics invigorated by contemporary techniques and great ingredients, it was just past 8:15am on Saturday that a party of three entered the converted former drive-thru Burger joint now decorated as a cozy space with checkered floors and green tables, a few televisions showing Sportscenter as early 2010's Pop hits flittered overhead.

Arriving before most of the crowd and greeted by local Operating Partner Tony Alonge, whose name had been passed along from corporate after an E-mail inquiring as to whether the Monte Cristo was available at Breakfast since the online menu seems to indicate otherwise, it was at a sizable four-top next to the kitchen that seating was offered and menus presented, the servers with an ever-present smile that almost seemed contagious throughout the morning - a few of them even passing their limited free time dancing and singing along to the music.

Featuring a sizable menu, though not the outlandish 'everything to everyone' mishmash of some, it was after some perusal and questions about sourcing that a relatively sizable order was placed including a few half-size plates allowed in order to sample more variety, the total cost of just over $70 still a bargain considering all that was entailed and easily a place where a check less than $15 per person would be realistic as an average.

Honing recipes now for nearly 25 years, each restaurant offering similar classics plus several specials that change from week to week, it was with Coffee and Water poured and kept filled that the meal quickly got underway, a miscommunication about wanting items sent out in rounds soon seeing the whole table flooded with eight plates that made it difficult to taste everything while still warm, the Pound Cake French Toast, for instance, saved till last and at that point just above room temperature which made it difficult to get a sense of how good it might have been piping hot and more capable of melting the butter.

Moving on to items better assessed hot from the kitchen, a one-and-one Benedict featuring housemade Hollandaise, Canadian Bacon and Vegetables beneath medium-poached Eggs atop toasted English Muffins as good as most in the city alongside nicely fried Hash Browns, Metro Diner's Fried Chicken and Waffles proved very impressive considering the price point, a half-order of the bone-in Bird plump and juicy with a good spice profile served with supple Waffles and a scoop of Strawberry Butter.

Not offering the option for Pure Maple Syrup, but instead creating their 'signature' sweet and spicy Sauce tableside by combining Crystal Hot Sauce with Warm 'syrup,' it was with good fortune that neither the aforementioned Pound Cake nor the signature ""Yo Hala on The Square"" Stuffed French Toast required any additional garnishment, the thick slices of Challah Bread stuffed with Strawberries and Cream Cheese making for one tasty weekly special beneath a liberal ladle of warm Strawberry Compote.

Not particularly impressed by the ""Cheesiest Grits,"" even the addition of a layer of Cheddar both top and bottom leaving the grains a bit runny and flavorless without adding salt, Metro Diner's Buttermilk Biscuits feature the drop-style common throughout most of Florida and are well flavored with light sours of Buttermilk, the addition of a Honey-Glazed Chicken Plank to make a $4.79 Sandwich well worth it for those not wanting to invest in the whole Chicken and Waffles plate.

Speaking finally on the Monte Cristo, most versions in town either outright lying by serving a French Toast Sandwich or bastardizing the original recipe by omitting the Turkey, Metro Diner finally gives Las Vegas what so many have been requesting for years, the soft Sourdough Batter-dipped and deep-fried around a thick stack of two deli-Meats, Cheddar and American Cheese with almost no residual oil plus a big bowl of Raspberry Preserves at its side.

Using the same light Batter to coat the Onion Rings as that on the Monte Cristo, it was with compelling words offered by the chalkboard at the back of the room that Dessert became necessary, the Salty Caramel Brownie served warm with a big ball of Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Chocolate drizzle while the Key Lime Pie is imported straight from Jacksonville for the sake of consistency, anyone familiar with the debate certain to be amused by Whipped Cream offered on the side, but certainly not on top of, the generous and tangy slice.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,9,4,UqreJQG7RHAS4DXYoxJXew

The food: I ordered a breakfast combination of two eggs, bacon, grits, toast, and a short stack of pancakes. I asked for the eggs to be over medium and they were perfect. They asked if I wanted cheese grits instead of regular grits and I said yes: they were amazing! Just as good as New Orleans! They also asked if I wanted to have any fruit added to my pancakes so we added blueberries...These additions were at no additional charge. The toast is made with very good bread, whole-wheat, and fresh. The bacon was absolutely delicious. Please know that my friend got the sausage patties instead of the bacon and she thought it was just OK so I would go with bacon if you have a choice. The pancakes were good... I cannot say they were outstanding as I have had way better pancakes at other places, but they were good. In the near future, I would not order the pancakes with the rest of the meal.
Coffee, hazelnut coffee, is awesome. This place rocks! We are so going back for breakfast repeatedly and I would recommend it to anyone. I have heard that the chicken and waffles are amazing and I have also heard that they have an amazing Charleston shrimp and grits dish.
Highly recommended and this place is going to be huge... There is no doubt in my mind that it will quickly get to the point where you will have to lineup to get a table because it is that good. Highly recommended.

Day 2: breakfast was so good on Saturday that we decided to also come on Sunday. This time, I ordered the Greek omelette which came with three beautifully cooked eggs with fresh feta cheese as well as tomatoes and spinach, with whole wheat toast and cheesy grits. Outstanding! Once again, the hazelnut coffee was a major winner. My friend ordered the western omelette and it was also fantastic. Her son ordered the pigs in a blanket which is pancakes rolled around sausage and he said it was phenomenal, along with hashbrowns. Her daughter ordered the 'Yo Challah', apparently featured on triple D's. It is challah bread with sweet cream cheese and blueberry compote and other ingredients... very sweet and we were not impressed but still a phenomenal restaurant. We are so coming back here and this place is amazing. Easily top five in Las Vegas for breakfast.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,5,0,5,Y8oUSn98629Ey0Bfmw5jiQ

First things first, customer service was great! We were greeted immediately and were told to choose any table we'd like. Deanne came over to get our drink order then came back to explain the specials of the day. She took great care of us and made sure we were enjoying our food. Make sure to ask for her! 

I was torn between the crab cake benedict and the fried chicken and waffles. They convinced me to get the waffles and I regret nothing. On top of the Belgian waffles was a dollop of strawberry butter -- yum yum!! The waffles were fluffy, chicken had flavor (not dry!), and Deanne made this sweet and spicy sauce for me to dip everything in -- syrup and Louisiana hot sauce, so simple! 

My friend ordered one of the day's specials: French toast. She added bananas and chocolates on top. It also came with many other things -- eggs, sausage patties, and toast (or grits). She was hesitant about the grits but wanted to be adventurous. Deanne assured her that if she didn't like it, she could bring her something else -- such great customer service! 

The French toast wasn't to die for. The fried chicken and waffles were delicious mostly because of the strawberry butter and sweet and spicy syrup. If I come back, I'm getting that again!",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,5,4,4,ENUd1jcRhzbUyXnN15yQ1w

A big chalk board with the daily specials on one wall, today strawberry yo hala. Sounded good, we tried that, I also got John Sr breakfast sandwich, 
Two eggs over medium, Swiss cheese, bacon, tomatoes and mayo on eight grain toast, it was really good, bread was fresh, just the way I like it. 

My husband got one of the specials, fried chicken and waffles, half a fried chicken and a Belgian waffle topped with a sweet, strawberry butter and served with our signature sweet and spicy sauce. It took 18 min to cook the fried chicken, but worth the wait. Crunchy, juicy and waffles crisp on outside and soft inside.

Prior to leaving I checked out the menu and the reviews and decided to try something new for me, Charleston Shrimp & Grits. I'm not a southerner but it sounded worth a try.

I found other items of interest but stuck with my decision and ordered the Charleston Shrimp & Grit while my wife ordered the fruity waffle. After a couple of minutes the manager came to our table to inform me that they only had one grit cake left and would I like an order of grits on the side as a substitute. I told no that was fine, one was all I would have probably eaten anyway. Our dinners arrived and I was correct; I never would have finished two grit cakes. My shrimp were plentiful, tasted fresh and were delicious as was the grit cake. I probably could have done with less sauce but who's complaining? No one made me finish it. My wife loved the waffles with fresh fruit. At first she said it was too much but she did finish most of it. I tried a taste of her dish and the waffles were flavorful, light, crisp on the outside but nice and tender on the inside. When our server brought the check I saw that the manager had discounted my dinner by 50%. This was totally unexpected but appreciated nonetheless. I'm sure they'll make it back in all the good comments I make to my friends who eat out fairly regularly. The food was delicious, the service excellent and the restaurant hospitable and very clean looking. All in all a really great first experience and I look forward to returning soon.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,1,0,5,SFhd8V4oAqN-U7A1FZwh-g

Our favorite Server ""Hannah"" she is amazing.. she makes you feel so welcomed and at home.. This is one of the reasons we drive from the east side of town.. just to have her wait on us..the whole staff & managers are all really nice.. this is one of the cleanest restaurants I have ever been in.. They take pride in the environment and the food they serve..
I like that one will be closer.. but if Hannah is still at the one on the west side I would still drive there just for her to wait on me.. she is awesome..",xfFbRSH1T609k_aR_D99FQ,0,0,5,AJvHwCNblUyeTsWWtYe38Q

We arrived on a weekday evening and order one fried chicken entree and a spicy honey fried chicken biscuit. I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken but it was well prepared and tasty. The mashed potatoes were on point. For a chain restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was made from scratch. I can't wait to return to try more of the menu soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,16,4,nTMaOSQkfEWsozS_mjVC9Q

The portions served were really big. I got the half order of the chicken and waffles and waffles given two waffles and 2 pieces of chicken. My husband got the chicken pot pie and that was pretty big also. Our friends tried the huevos rancheros and the diner favorite : the bold city burger. 

Everything was good. I guess I misunderstood what the server was saying when ordering a half order because I thought if you get a half order of something it would be half the price. The chicken and waffles regular price was $15.99 and the half order was $10.99 which if I understood the server better I would've just ordered a full order.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,1,4,Gjcjcf3HlnxMxwHcq0Njtg
