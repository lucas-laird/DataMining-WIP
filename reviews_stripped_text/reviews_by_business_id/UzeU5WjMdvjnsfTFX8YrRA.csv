The owner is a great guy and this place has been open for almost 2 years. The interesting part is that he was born outside the states then moved to Texas when he was older. There he learned how to make Texas BBQ

Word of advice: Most people order to go and rarely do you see anyone dining in.

The brisket was tender and had that smoky flavor. I asked for the bbq sauce on the side so I could get the full taste of the meat inside of it being drenched in sauce. Their sauce is a tangy honey bbq that they make from scratch. Actually everything was made from scratch! The baked beans had an acquired taste to them but my roommate loved them! The potato salad was better than expected and was actually pretty good. The fries were your usual fries, nothing too exciting about it. My roommate enjoyed this place so much, that he keeps going back. He says the ribs are quite tender. I guess I'll have to try it again but definitely on my list for a return visit.",IxEMT9rqzG6n4EJhqXSMvw,0,0,4,UbYBxu6Jg6qlv9jyNbNpeQ

I was pretty hungry and I asked if the regular plates were a lot bigger than the lunch specials.  She assured me that it was.  I ordered the rib tips and side order of beans.   First of all, the guys getting the lunch special at the next table seemed to have more food than I.  The rib tips themselves were okay in flavor but seemed extra bony and fatty compared to other places.  The beans were okay but nothing special.  The sauce comes as regular or spicy.  They tasted the same to be, with the hot one having more heat but no extra flavor.  My friend ordered the brisket and that seemed to be a lot better portion, not sure on the flavor.  Also, they don't have a working soda fountain so they were handing out cans of soda.",qbq4zC9SrZuaQ4-J-wtRuw,0,0,2,kgrRSM4y3eTCLeexmBT8xg

It's very small, only a few tables. The fried okra was the best I've ever had! The meat fell over the ribs!    I will be back soon!",fQEI1c199giGj9ceoAQTUQ,1,0,4,3cRF-ksT_aL4089SP20YdA

Nothing bad on the menu here....I'm good with ordering any of the meats on the list with the brisket and spareribs being my favs so far.  Its also great that I can get a great bbq fix so close to home.  

I definitely don't come here as much as I should since Shish Kebab House just moved to a bigger space in the same plaza and that's usually my defacto order out restaurant but I'm definitely a big fan of this place.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,5,1,4,KTnHitZJEoZK-XKTyKElvA
