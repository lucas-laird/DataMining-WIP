I tell people that I bring there that we are going there for everything but the service and they can't help but to nod in agreement. It is just frustrating.

We headed upstairs and entered another world. The lounge upstairs that they call the den was a blast. They have a dj that plays until 2 AM on the weekends and I can easily see this place being the new Summerlin hot spot.

161550,2013-01-14,1,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"This review is taken from my blog, read the full review with active links there...

Spoiler alert: just like Town Square, Tivoli Village doesn't have any good places to dine. In fact, Tivoli might be one of the larger development failures in recent years in Las Vegas. I found nothing good at Bottles & Burgers which recently closed, and I don't think anyone in town could tell you the name of another restaurant there. Now we welcome Poppy Den, the latest restaurant to open in this cursed shopping area. This place is brought to us by Chef Angelo Sosa from Top Chef D.C. and Top Chef All Stars which really means nothing to me as I don't watch any of those. Still, with those credentials it promised maybe something good. Right?

After waiting over 20 minutes for our table to be ready even with a reservation, we were seated directly next to the bathrooms which made for a high traffic, slightly annoying location. The booths are incredibly awkward; they fit 3 people comfortably, but for a party of 4 they're forced to place a chair outside of it in the circulation area. The space is also incredibly loud as there are no soft surfaces anywhere, so if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner, be prepared to shout. There's a bar at the front that seats maybe 10 people, those crappy booths along the left side, and a bunch of loose tables filling the rest of the space. There's some sort of upstairs area that wasn't opened yet at the time of my visit, not sure what it'll be and I didn't ask.

The Poppy Burger that I came for is based on his Bibimbap Burger which was voted the Greatest Burger in America by Eater in 2011 you can read more about it here. I was hoping that the burger which was based on something with such an acclaimed title would represent a little more. The four of us ordered almost identical burgers, but what came out were four distinctly different burgers. First of all, look at the insane amount of lettuce that was placed in my girlfriend's burger, I have no idea why any chef thought this looked ok enough to send out. Two of our burgers were ordered medium rare and two of them medium, yet none of them looked similar to each other and my unevenly cooked medium-rare burger was cooked a bit more than that in spots. This was a great way to test the restaurant's consistency, which in this case was a total failure. Also, if you clicked on that link above to see the original burger this is based on, this one looks nothing like it.

As for my burger, the meat to bun ratio was completely off as there was way too much bun. The bun was grilled and actually very tasty with great sesame flavor, but was way too big and fell apart. The meat had ok flavor, but nothing great. It was charred well on the outside but that char didn't really have standout flavor. The pickles had really good flavor, but the egg and sriracha weren't that noticeable. This was incredibly messy, and the plate they give you is completely flat and makes for a very risky meal. Napkins had to be put in place as a dam to stop juices and sauce from spreading onto the table and eventually us. Overall this burger was a total failure in general, and ten-fold if you know what it's based on or compare it to other Asian themed burgers I often speak highly about. After about three bites I actually spoke out a simple ""nope"" in a response to no one's question at the table. 

The fries looked and tasted almost like McDonald's upon first bite. They didn't have great flavor, but were cooked ok. The salts and whatever seasonings on it were present but not all that noticeable. The kimcheese sauce was gritty, flavorless and not really that great either, and I longed for ketchup most of the time. If you do like this kimcheese sauce when it comes out, eat it quickly because as it cools it becomes really gritty and nasty.

Between the less than stellar appetizers, and absolute failure of a burger, I can't say I'll make my way back here to try anything else. I love Asian food, and the menu certainly has plenty of great sounding items that would normally bring me back, but not in this case. The burger with fries is $13, which would possibly be acceptable if this was good. Our meal for four with a couple drinks, two appetizers and four burgers came to $120, which is way too much for how unhappy I was walking out. While the restaurant was very full the night we were there, I fully chalk that up to the fact that it's a brand new 'hot' place, and don't expect the lack of draw that Tivoli has to bring anyone to it, just like the rest of the places there. If Chef Sosa truly wants to make a great Asian themed burger, he should go down the street to Bachi and take notes on the proper size of a bun, how to form a patty, and how to apply your toppings. Until then, don't bother coming here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,5,1,2,FpcDKFyN82uaQrSEkNB8lQ

We had the mixed greens salad, orange chicken, miso salmon and kim chee fried rice. Everything was good, and the presentation wasn't pretentious like some restaurants can be. We topped it off with our waiters recommendation, the giant fortune cookie with mango sorbet and berries. So good.

I ordered the tomato soup, which was some of the best I ever tasted, and the shrimp and grits, which I would normally not order (thanks waiter!), but was amazing and I highly recommend. Overall great experience and I cannot wait to go back.

551172,2013-05-25,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"So after hearing all the hype, my friend and I went and checked out this place for dinner.  At the end, I don't believe it was worth it, especially at the prices they charged.

I had the Silk Road to drink to start off with, and was rather disappointed in it.  It was served in a tiny tea cup that was filled with ice, so the drink got watered down very quickly.  Also, the tequila was so overpowering that I could barely taste the jasmine or lemon, and there was absolutely no bite from the chili pepper, which was the main reason I ordered the drink as I like spicy things.

Food wise, I had the Tuna steak which was recommended by the waiter as well as the kimchee fried rice.  The tuna steak was cooked perfectly, but that is about all the positive that I can say about the dish.  It was served covered in a roasted red pepper/basil/ginger/EVOO ""salsa"" and the red peppers and basil just completely overwhelmed what little flavor the tuna had.  Couldn't even taste any ginger in the dish whatsoever.  Also, the texture on parts of the tuna were off, and so was the flavor.  I described it at one point as tasting as if I was eating semi-firm tofu, as it actually had the flavor along with the texture.  My friend who was dining with me firmly agreed with my assessment as well, so it wasn't just me.  The kimchee fried rice was very meh, and I was disappointed again that there was no kick to it.  There was a very strong flavor of dried shrimp in their, which kind of surprised me but not a lot as I know that it can be used in the making of kimchee.  Overall though, I've had much better kimchee fried rice, but it was much better once I added some more soy sauce and sriracha to it to actually give it some oomph.

I will not bother coming back here to try other things unless someone else is paying.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,2,0,2,pkQYP09OCoaMKi3kz8oGAg

559576,2013-11-17,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"After reading numerous mixed reviews and hearing countless accounts of Angelo Sosas Poppy Den located the very stylish Tivoli Village in Summerlin I decided to see what this place is all about. And hopefully set the record straight for all of you gastronomes with discriminating taste.
     I have traveled extensively in Asia. I have also worked as a Sommelier for Chef Joel Robuchon at his premier restaurant. He has earned more Michelin stars than any other chef in the world...My standards and expectations are extremely high indeed.
     If you crave bland, boring, outdated cuisine with no texture... Angelo Sosa is NOT the chef for you. Angelo has lived and worked extensively in Asia and this is glaringly evident in his cuisine. Each and every dish exemplified this point to me. A careful selection of only the freshest ingredients with bright flavor, fragrance, and texture that seamlessly coalesce into a delicious and truly orgasmic gastronomic experience of seamless perfection. Each dish I savored had the sharp precision, form, and balance of a Japanese Katana!!!
     My goal of dining there last night was to see if Angelo Sosa is all that, or just another celebrity chef blessed by television reality show exposure. I admit that I have worked with some of those Chefs while I was working in Los Angeles whose talents are in the words of Michael Broadbent ""slightly under performing"".
With this in mind, I asked my waiter Matt (who I strongly recommend) to ask Angelo to cook whatever he wants to. I do not have any dietary restrictions.
     The amuse bouche was the epitome of what am amuse should be. It is something bright and flavorful with vibrant acidity to open up your palate. You'd be amazed how many Michelin starred restaurants I have dined at that defy this very premise.
Some of the dishes that I found very impressive include:
Edamame with togarashi
Asian white fish with herbs and olive oil that made me feel like I was back in Hanoi dining at the finest restaurant there.
Persian cucumbers in asian spice
Pineapple fried rice
Duck that was even better than the original Peking Duck restaurant in Beijing.
Watermelon with greens and fish sauce( a wonderful sensation of sweet and salty flavors.
And the grand finale.... A homemade fortune cookie with berries and same featuring five different textures.
Angelo's cuisine is a Sommeliers dream as I could think of at least 10 wines that would match each dish perfectly.
     I enjoyed the cozy yet hip ambiance at Poppy Den. The timing of the food and service was impeccable. Angelo Sosa is a culinary Genius!!! He was very warm and explained each dish. He spends time to visit all of his guests in the restaurant. His affordable cuisine is reasonably priced and is a wonderful gastronomic experience that you will treasure and soon wish to revisit. Poppy Den is my new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. And Chef Angelo Sosa IS ALL THAT!!!",nv2PNXe_Q19tIhCMETpzQA,4,2,5,mhI1xwW_HwA_Lt3zeaROvQ
568582,2014-01-01,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Absolutely one of the best restaurant experiences my friends and I have ever had. We went for NYE and the service was phenomenal. We started in the lounge upstairs and asked the bartender to make a ""fun"" drink for the guys and a fun drink for us ladies. I wish I knew the bartenders name but he made a whiskey drink for the guys and ""the ex girlfriend"" for the girls. The bartender was so nice even though the bar was quite busy. Delicious drink!!! We kept drinking them all night. Then we went downstairs for dinner - our waiter was AMAZING. Great service, friendly, funny and just wanted us to have a great experience. Poppy Den wasn't too crowded which I appreciated because they definitely could've packed the place. At the end of the night before midnight, our waiter (I think he is the manager, actually) took all of our drinks upstairs for us and found a table. Even this surprised me because you don't always find that someone will go out of the way to help you. I shouldn't have been surprised though based on the service we'd already been experiencing!

Quinoa with pineapple and crispy fried tofu was sweet and refreshing, the charred bok choy was perfect in its little pool of salty soy sauce, the ramen (my favorite!) had a deliciously smoky& rich broth with nice thin noodles.

Finally got to try this spot out and ordered the following:

Poppy Fries with Kim ""cheese"" sauce - I ordered this because I thought the Kim ""cheese"" sauce would add some bold, Korean flavors.  What I got were cold, soggy fries with Jalapeno-flavored Cheez Whiz.  No kim chee flavor, not really even any cheese flavor, just....salty.  Also, as wrong as this sounds, I'd probably choose regular Cheez Whiz over Poppy Den's version.  

Fish Fritters -  Essentially, one small step up from Gordon's fish sticks.  The only highlight to this dish is the sauce....which tasted like thousand island dressing doused in dill.  It was a very dim highlight.  The presentation was also terrible.  Little fried balls just chilin' in a bowl of dressing. Pass on this, for the love of god.
  
The Crispy Pork Dumplings - Essentially extra thick fried wontons.  This was such a lame dish it actually pissed me off.  I paid $11 dollars for something I could get in the freezer section at Smith's .  Actually, that's an insult to freezer-section dumplings.  These dumplings lack any redeeming quality - boring flavors, no creativity, forgettable all around.  At this point in the meal, I was ready to peace out.

We left E&R and went for a walk and came upon Poppy Den and saw that the bar was only 1/3 full, so we went in and sat down at at a bar table. The hostess was nice enough, but seemed very flustered and tried to find us menus. We had been seated for about 5 minutes, when we were greeted by a waiter who took our wine order. Another 10 minutes later, the hostess came by with menus. We told the waiter we had about 45 minutes to eat a couple of apps and have drinks, which he told us wouldn't be a problem, so we placed our order right away - a glass of chardonnay, a glass of pinot noir, sparkling water and 2 appetizers. 30 minutes later, we still hadn't received our drinks, much less our appetizers. To add insult to injury, several other patrons had been seated at the bar and at bar tables AFTER us and had received their drinks and food. I made a hand gesture to my husband that we needed to leave, which a manager at the bar happened to see, and he came over to ask us what the problem was. We told him that we had been waiting for 30 minutes for drinks and apps. He got us our drinks right away, which were okay - the chardonnay wasn't cold enough and the pinot noir tasted soapy, probably b/c the glass had soap residue. Our food came out shortly afterward. One app was over cooked and the other was under cooked. 

I really wanted to like this place b/c the menu looked good and the atmosphere was fun, however, the service was terrible, staff/management were clueless and the hostess was triple++ seating waiters so they were slammed.

The menu did not really explain how superb the food was.  We started with the PUPU platter to get an idea what the menu had in store.  DON""T MISS the shrimp and grits. DON""T MISS the tuna tartar (with egg).   I hate grits, but none of us could get enough of these - they are wonderful.  The salmon was perfect, the steak was great.  In other words the food was marvelous.  The staff was really attentive and didn't miss a thing.  Seeing AJ again was the tops.  If you're in Vegas, don't miss this one.

992668,2013-03-12,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"We officially kicked off Spring Restaurant Week last night at Poppy Den. It's an Asian gastro pub in Tivoli Village by Angelo Sosa. You might recognize the name from Top Chef Season 7 or All Stars. I was immediately intrigued when I heard of its opening, but we hadn't found time to check it out until now; Restaurant Week was the perfect excuse.
 
Our party of three had a seven o'clock reservations, we were seated in the center of the dining room. There were several tables filled but I thought it'd be busier. Service was attentive. We started with drinks: Asahi ($7), Big Dog Rebel Red ($7) and Pinot Grigio ($7). We each chose items from the Restaurant Week Menu, $30.13 for three courses.
 
The Crab Toast with Mango Mustard Grilled ciabatta and ripe mango got us started. This was delicious. It's a bit sweet and savory with a nice crunch from the ciabatta. We all thoroughly enjoyed it. 

We sampled both entrees the Miso Salmon with Shishito Peppers Mint vinaigrette and soy sauce was nicely prepared and a bit sweet. The Roasted Duck Breast; with Poppy Honey Italian honey and cracked almonds is what lured me in and it was actually my least favorite. I found it a bit chewy since it was cooked a bit more than I like. The flavors were nice, though. I loved the grilled bok choy. I would have been thrilled with a big ole plate of that alone.
 
Dessert was Chips and Ice Cream or Strawberry Sake Shortcake, but they ran out of strawberries. So, we had our choice of raspberries or blueberries. Raspberries it was! The ice cream was strawberry sake. I loved it! On the other shortcake was whipped cream and cracked black pepper, I enjoyed the unusual twist. Speaking of unusual twists the chips and ice cream was literally housemade potato chips in scoops of lemon poppy and miso toffee ice cream. Sweet and salty, it's such a lovely combination. 

Overall, the seamlessness of the multitude of flavors in each dish is stellar. We thought it was a great experience, we'd like to return and sample more of the menu. This Restaurant Week special is a great deal: the crab toast, bok choy and duck breast are regularly $43 and that's not even counting dessert. It's considerable savings, plus you're helping a great cause with a portion of the proceeds benefiting Three Square Food Bank. Poppy Den also started Meaningful Mondays where they donate 20% of total sales to a different charity each week. It's a nice touch that they give back regularly.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,2,2,4,6D7VwSqZg_IlRvqw5hZe9w

They have the Vinturi wine aerators that they bring to the table. If you are into wine you know what that is, if you aren't, I'm boring you.. 
The menu changes quite a bit. I was sad about the pork belly being removed, but was happy to see that horrid little ""citrus fish Caesar"" be gone. All in all, I am usually 97% pleased with everything I've ordered here.

The calamari was so spicy we each only has one bite and couldn't touch it anymore. We told the waiter it was too spicy for us and his response was ""oh"".  Most restaurants would have taken it back and gotten a new less spicy one or removed it from the bill since we literally each took ONE bite. NOPE not this place.
The broccoli chicken was also nothing but spicy, literally couldn't taste a thing except spice. I'm starting to think that the food here is not fresh, why else would they need to make everything spicy???
The fried rice was actually really good no complaints on that except that's its really small and not big enough to share. 

All in all I think I would have been better satisfied eating from a corner Chinese restaurant than this place and will definitely not waste my time nor money to ever go back again.",fKYjGV2OSkSFD1_vdFhh0Q,6,2,1,mjA7kl4oyR3fkYNVy-hpoQ
1036361,2013-06-23,1,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Came here for happy hour's $5 select appetizers and champagne/champagne cocktails from 5-6:30pm. The hostess was very nice and asked how we heard about Poppy Den and once I said Yelp, she asked if I was an Elite. I would give an extra star just because she knew what yelp was. 

The only hiccup was that they couldn't ifnd a happy hour menu so we had to wait about 5 minutes to find one. 

I had the Bellini champagne cocktail, I originally thought the waiter only brought us champagne, but he explained that the peach flavoring is added in and they don't use a juice like a mimosa would look. It tasted fresh and crisp. The only downside is that I am a slow drinker and it warmed up in the patio area, so the cocktail became room temperature. 

The food was unique, I enjoyed the watermelon salad, caprese salad (another slice of tomato and mozzarella wouldn't hurt), and the chicken wings were scrumptious. The chicken wings had this delicous crust around the chicken meat and then was drizzled in a spicy and sweet asian sauce. If I was dining alone, I could have had the salads and the chicken and make an entire meal. 

The potstickers were fine, and the meatballs were mushy, nothing special. 

From the regular menu we had the tomato soup, it had a light sweetness to it once it hit your tongue, which then transcended into a light heat. I also got to try the crabcakes, yes they are small, but man are they packed with crab. Chef sosa made a good choice to go with quality over quantity here, and the pickled asian apple pear was a very nice light and refreshing touch to something that is usually so heavy. 

For dessert they were out of the fortune cookie with mango sorbet so we ended up getting the trio of sorbets. The sorbets were very tasty, but the waiter said that we had mango, strawberry, and pineapple ginger. I couldn't taste the ginger, and it tasted more like a pineapple coconut sorbet. The flavors were intense, but not sweet! The cookie bowl that it came in was a delite to munch through and acted as a great tool to move the sorbet into the mouth. 

Service was great, our waiter came to check on us quite often and didn't make a big deal that one party member was 90 minutes late. Our water glasses were always full, and came right away with a dessert menu and offered suggestions and was very knowledgable about the menu.",tQVTyovdm4doXxDSkfYUUw,6,2,5,_esYnUo3joK_8NO4h7GFnA

We ordered the $15 mussels and chicken wings. They both were as expected except after having three servings of mussels still no bread. Service was good and the food came at an acceptable rate after getting started.  No real complaints except that the menu changed and the desert fortune cookie I was looking forward to was no longer available. Also they have a limited menu so you will need to be selective when ordering.

Cocktails, a tad lacking in ingredient combination, taste and presentation.  Hopefully that will change. The area upstairs (still unopened when we were there)  is a scrumptious mix of Asian influence with comfy vintage kitsch,  just lovely and inviting.

My friends and I tried all the appetizers on the happy hour menu, since they are all only $5. I would recommend all of them (the watermelon  and goat cheese salad, crispy pork dumpling, oyster mushrooms and peppered chicken), the only one I wouldn't order again was the curried dumplings. They give you a pretty good portion for $5 so definitely hit up the happy hour. Also, they had $5 wine and cocktails.

When I went for dinner we ordered the crab toast with mango mustard and the pork belly tacos. Both of the entrees were very tasty. Our server recommended the crab toast and said it was one of this favorites, I liked it but I am not sure I would get it again -  I can't put my finger on why, but it just wasn't my favorite. The pork belly tacos on the other hand were awesome. The taco shell is actually the sweet, white, asian bread that you can get at dim sum and then inside is the pork belly. I thought there was a little too much bread for how much pork belly, but overall the favors were delicious. Then for desert we got the watermelon and goat cheese salad (my fav).

We liked chef Sosa on Top Chef and were pretty excited to try a new local restaurant, the online menu seemed interesting and prices were fair. Also, anything had to be better than Petra, which was in the same space but now I suspect that space may be cursed!
The failure was very simply the food, it failed in execution as well as concept and flavors. Almost everything was too heavy handed and heavy or over sauced or spiced.

Here's the post mortem, good and bad:

  We started with appetizers including the pupu platter, watermelon salad and cold pea soup were quite good almost sublime. The best entree was the chicken that my daughters friend ordered off the children's menu.
The generals chicken wing was a sticky super sweet general tso sauced debacle that pf chang's would have done better. Jarred tuna was raw tuna in way too much spicy mayo, really? thats the best we could do given the las vegas asian scene? The fish fritter was a super rich gooey thing sitting in an orange sauce that was essentially a sea of too much tartar sauce that came out of a  jar. The lettuce wrap taboule was super salty.
The entrees were worse if thats possible. Pork ravioli was pork belly sitting in an indescribably bad brown sauce, the salmon dish was slathered in a super sweet glaze that was too overpowering. the shrimp and grits was a disaster. The shrimp were completely raw and the grits had this strange citrus flavor that just was not right.
  Overall a complete failure. We asked where the chef was and we were told he is in Korea. Again really? The place has been open for 2 weeks and there is clearly no one minding the store or the kitchen.  We will not be going back any time soon.",0-JqT-9gQPw5FvTFba0rUQ,4,2,1,t6n5DJfJf3wqZMH4XnWJGQ

Very dog friendly. Came here with my husband and two dogs.   On a beautiful spring day, we were seated outside without problem for lunch.  Service was great, even Bex, the manager, checked on us and a huge bowl of water was served to our dogs. 

The restaurant setup and decor is inviting. 

The food is solidly good.  
The jarred tuna was excellent. Sort of like a poke. Wish it was a bit colder, though.  The short ribs, didn't seem like an actual short rib cut, but were tasty yet not distinct.  My husband liked the dumplings, but found the sauce too sweet.  Cocktails are unlike any other.  If you never had sake, here is the place to try a few.  Wine selection by the glass is very well thought out, hitting popular varietals and also less popular varietals that actually pair well with Asian flavors.

The only real negative, was that a few small plates and a few drinks added up to a $100 bill inc. tip,  and we were still kind of hungry.  In all fairness, we did not try a large plate which may have been a better value. I'll definitely come back to try a few more things.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,2,1,3,hFcPBzE-Xj9SP3gcWyr9Jw

Food: 
The food is good and definitely different. We had several small plates all of which were good though they are really just appetizers. I recommend not ordering familiar things like the meatballs, but go for the more interesting fusion items like the tuna deviled eggs.

Service:
Here is the issue. Now don't get me wrong, the wait staff was great. They were very attentive and friendly, but the kitchen simply could not keep up with them. Half the restaurant was empty and there was a wait to get in even with a reservation because they could not clear tables. It took 50 minutes for us to get appetizers and after an hour we were told that they were out of one of the appetizers we ordered.

Overall:
Having read several reviews, it seems that service here is spotty, but this is a place to keep an eye on as the food is definitely worth trying.

Twin Creeks was a hit, Herbs n Rye another hit, Kyara classic favorite. Anyway not here to give 5 stars to Anthony for knowing a place being worth going to and starting trends so lets get on with it shall we?

Finally had an opportunity to eat here with some amazing company. 
Had a newer drink that wasnt on the menu yet but is going to be added soon as part of the summer seasonal. 

The Naked Lunch cocktail has got to be one of THE BEST cocktails i've had in quite some time. Since i've switched to bourbons and snobbish craft beers the sweet and fruity drinks have been replaced with drinks that do away with the fufu and straight to the booze and booze flavors with some enhancers with some sweetness to take off the edge. It was quite refreshing to take sips of this nicely balanced sweet and fruity cocktail. 

Everyone says 'if you ever go to Poppy Den, get the QUINOA FRIED RICE"" no joke what they do with the quinoa is nothing short of absolutely amazing not going to dwell on it because several others have already reviewed it and have described it quite better than i can.

The General's Chicken Wings surely reflect our great nation's military higher ups...old, senile, and adulterous...But the wings on the other hand are friggin amazing! Felix over at the bar recommended them and described them as 'larger than chicken but smaller than turkey' and he wasnt wrong with that description at all. Due to the awesome customer service these were comp'ed as well as a round of drinks for reasons unexplained until the kitchen was cranking out a plate of these once every 10 minutes. These things are quite addictive and wonderfully tasty. Sorry Brian (Wing King)...then again Brian's wings are cheaper and i got 70+ flavors to choose from so it's not a complete jump of the fence to greener grasses just yet.

Shrimp and Grits. Not really a Girts kinda guy. Only had them once and it came from a military messing facility so we got the grits no one else wanted to buy made from people who hated their jobs and get entertained by swearing into the food to give it some extra hatred....Anyway, if i wasnt so full from everything else plus the cocktails i surely would have ate the whole damn bowl and not feel an ounce of guilt until Felix told me how much butter went into it...
These arent you traditionally cooked grits with lots AND LOTS of butter and cheese for flavor. They added coconut cream and maybe some dried shredded coconut to give it a nice...well coconut flavor which i was not expecting at all. The black tiger prawns were cooked to perfection and were plump and delicious. Would have liked them grilled to give a little smokey shrimp flavor to the coconuttie grits but that's just nit picking.

If budget wasnt an issue i would not hesitate to eat here until i tasted every single thing on the menu at least once. 

They've got my seal of approval.

1975931,2014-02-07,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"I must admit I love this restaurant.  It is a prized dinner location for myself - with a beautiful and unique design stuck into the middle of Tivoli Village.  

The menu has been modified a few times since my first time in, drawn up by head chef Sosa.  You can tell he has creativity in stock, and is willing to make this restaurant one of his own inside of the city of Las Vegas.

I've had many of the menu items - from the brilliant duck, the risotto, and the kimchi fried rice.  Each was wonderful, and a welcome example of solid cooking.  The menu itself was also nicely designed, with unique cocktails and little quotes scrawled into the menu from famous writers (including many from the beats movement, like William S Burroughs).

Overall, this is a great place to go with friends or a date if you're looking for a gorgeous and unique dining experience within the city.  Afterwards, there are plenty of wine bars and social spots to head to within the village.",3Apvsrrf4wJuG4NdwIfXwA,3,1,5,1E_Q54FAh_9ofTL4cNh_vg

4 of us came as we were in Vegas for a conference and Yelp steered me right!
Not a detail I could ask to change.
Had reservations.  Happened to be restaurant week.  Both menus available.
Greeted by warm hostess- asked if we wanted in or outside dining and we were seated.

We chose to be seated outside.  It got chilly and we asked for a heat lamp which some strong hot men delivered.  Yeah.

Our server was a cute woman named Yolanda.  She was wonderful.  I could tel right away this girl is a fitness model or something.  Just saying, she was fit and cute BESIDES providing really personal and attentive service to our table.  She let me change the veggies on my fish and she was just overall helpful.

I had the miso salmon, charred bok choy and some strawberry shortcake.  I also had a cabernet.  WOW!  I mean wow.  Really good.  Everyone raved about their food.  Someone had duck and I was so knee deep in my food I didn't notice much else!  

We asked a lot of questions about the restaurant and the owner and since I live in NYC I will be visiting his places here.  Angelo, call me for a great meal!:)

Anyways, this place was the bomb with nice bathrooms and when I come to Vegas again, I will come back.  

Ask for Yolanda!",YYJ5oYIIUm2wSuh9tE7OyQ,2,2,5,GyXgfFn0B86-lxj8nlJgHQ

But I'd rate the food 3.5 stars. Yelp doesn't allow fractions, so I rounded down. We ordered the calamari, watermelon & goat cheese salad, oyster mushrooms, pork belly fried rice and the Poppy Den burger. All of the items weren't bad, but nothing was really memorable either. The prices aren't cheap so if I'm spending $65 on dinner (before gratuity), there are other places I enjoy a lot more.

Service was good. We were there on a weeknight and the restaurant was about 75% full on the inside (it's a pretty small space). We had made a reservation so we didn't have to wait for a table.

I saw on Twitter the night before that Poppy Den had a certain menu item that I went gaga over- pork belly fried rice. Now, I usually don't like to grub on swine, but there is just something about crispy pork belly that always perks my interest.

So after hearing about this dish, my husband and I headed over to Poppy Den on Thursday as we couldn't get the idea of it out of our heads!

Got a beautiful booth around 7pm.  Such a comfortable atmosphere and gorgeous interior!

Started off with the Pumpkin Woodchuck Cider.  Whaaaattt?! Yes and it was delicious!

My husband and I decided to order two appetizers for dinner and share:
1. Crispy Crab Dumplings w/ tomato jam
-delicious! Great crab flavor and the tomato jam had a lil kick to it (not acidic at all!)
2. Pork Belly Fried Rice w/ Kimchi
-ummm holy shit! Interesting & amazing flavors (I can't even explain cause I have no idea what all the flavors are!).  Pork belly was perfectly crispy, the rice is a perfect 10: fluffy and not over cooked, great egg and veggies.  This also had a lil kick of spice.

We loved this so much- we ordered another one to go so we had lunch the next day!!!

We ended the night with the homemade fortune cookie w/ fresh berries, pineapple ginger sorbet and a strawberry whipped cream.  This was a refreshing and light way to end the night.

While the entire menu had incredible choices and was super hard to choose, it would be hard to come back and not order that pork belly fried rice, although, their menu changes, so it might not be around for long!",Ii1PkdRpONUNwKC3lmhl1A,6,2,5,1KG_dYa6fjxDqPy96gFNRw

Decided to hit up this place with Alma C. before the Yelp Elite Event. Ha. We were hungry. Defo hungry. Ordered the following items:

Peking duck with scallion pancake - MUST ORDER! Ok the duck already has taste to it so DO NOT dip it in to the sauce, it gets a weird taste. Eat the duck and the scallion pancakes by itself.

Curry crab dumplings - interesting, but not memorable. I can't even remember the taste of it.

Pepper glazed chicken wings - just the right amount of glazness! Three pieces of chicken. Good amount.

Ramen - ok, this was a bad idea. It was too salty.

2234979,2013-01-18,6,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"The Skinny: unbalanced flavors and seasonings, miniscule portion sizes mar Angelo Sosa's new restaurant (2) service: attentive but with some missteps (3) value: given the so-so to mediocre offerings and the exorbitant pricing, this place is a big fail (2).

We ventured off for Poppy Den with a friend of ours on their opening day for lunch. Suffice to say, this joint lives up to its inauspicious name (Poppy Den? Who in their right mind would name an Asian inspired restaurant this? After what the British did to turn generations of Chinese into opium addicted zombies? WTF?)

Anyhow, colonialist aspirations aside, we were seated promptly and shown to our table. We ordered the Market salad with soy/truffle dressing ($7), Aunt Carmine's Fish Fritters ($11), Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup ($7), Poppy Burger (with fries, $11), Grandma's style Roast Chicken ($15), Steak and Potatoes ($18). We also sampled two desserts - the Chocolate Molten Cake and the Strawberry Sake shortcake.

The Market Salad ($7) can only be summed up in 1 word = weird. There was a little too much basil which pretty much overwhelmed the other subtle flavours of the mixed greens. The boiled egg thrown on top really didn't make any sense - such a heavy item has no place amongst delicate leaves. Added to the fact the heavy addition of a really unbalanced dressing (overly tart and salty), this was a massive fail.

Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup ($7) didn't arrive as hot as I had hoped. Serving it in such a shallow bowl made it cool off rapidly which didn't help. The soup overall was too sweet for my tastes. It was kind of like diluted ketchup with some curry flavor mixed in.

Aunt Carmine's Fish Fritters ($11) was perhaps the highlight of the meal. Nice and crispy on the outside, the fish mixture married well with the aioli it was served with. Unfortunately, the cost of the dish was rather high considering the small number of fritters served.

The Poppy Burger ($11) flavor was good but there are some major issues with the dish. Because we were sharing amongst three people, the hubs cut the burger into 4 equal serving sizes. But what is this? When he cut the burger into quarters - one quarter had no burger meat in it. I repeat - no burger meat in it. That meant that the burger:bun ratio is about 3:4. That's a sucky ratio because when you bite into a burger, you want to get a taste of everything... not just the bun. 

The fries were the thinner variety with a small sprinkle of togarashi on top. They were okay but nothing special. The kimcheese was alright  (we asked for on the side because we didn't want the sauce to mar the crispiness of the fries) but nothing that I would say I'd specifically yearn for again - it was more of an aioli than a cheese sauce per se.

Grandma's Style Roasted Chicken ($15)... it's a f$&king insult to a person's intelligence to put such a dish under their supposedly ""large plate"". This is not a large by any means. Really, the portion size for the chicken is about 1/4 of a boneless thigh off a regular sized chicken. I am not s&*tting you - it is that small. Served with some pickled vegetable, I fail to see how anyone except an 6 month infant would consider this a meal. The actual preparation of the roasted chicken was okay and edible but given the price it ought to be much more than this.

Steak and potatoes ($18) was only ok. Texturally a little tough, we were very underwhelmed by this offering. Served with a bland au jus and togarashi seasoned potatoes, it was definitely forgettable.

Finally dessert - we tried both the strawberry sake shortcake and the molten chocolate cake. The strawberry sake shortcake was overwhelmed by the oversaturation of the sponge with large amounts of sake. Not good. The chocolate molten cake was very good - nice and gooey on the inside but again for the price, small.

Overall, I wanted to love this place but there are too many flaws with the dishes to warrant a return visit. Even if this place were half the price and double the serving size, you just wouldn't come back to a restaurant that fails on so many levels of flavor and textures.

2257582,2013-01-27,9,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"asian fusion? - i hate it.
restaurants like pf changs, cheesecake factory and the like have given the fusion of asian food with any other type of cuisine a bad rap.
the fact that you can get a pork bao at cf and they call it a 'vietnamese taco' makes me throw up in my mouth a little.
you can imagine my hesitation when i heard that poppy den was chef angelo's version of ""asian fusion"".
the name kind of threw me a bit as well...poppy den? like opium den?
nevertheless, we decided to give it a go.

poppy den is located at tivoli village in summerlin.
park in the parking structure, come up the escalators by leone cafe and poppy den is on the opposite corner.

as we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with 2 friendly smiles and asked immediately if we had a reservation, which we did cuz i'm smart enough to know that you need to make a reservation at a brand new restaurant being opened by a celebrity chef.
after giving my name, the hostess was kind enough to inform us that our friend was already sitting at the bar and that our table would be ready shortly.
after waiting a whole of 90 seconds, just enough time for our friend to pay for his drink, we were seated at a nice booth with a round table, which i must say is very cool!
it must be the asian in me but i feel that round tables are so much better than angular tables.

i'm a huge fan of top chef and in season 7, chef angelo put together some really ambitious dishes that made me wonder ""do those flavors really work together!?""
this restaurant is equally as ambitious and while reading the menu, i wondered the same thing.
after my first bite of food here, i remembered how well sweet and savory items blend together, when done right, and how very much my palate enjoys those combinations.

we started with the QUINOA ""FRIED RICE"" WITH SUN DRIED PINEAPPLE.
wow!
it was slightly sweet and sour from the pineapple but also salty and spicy all at the same time.
phenomenal flavors that worked incredibly well together.

next we had the PUPU PLATTER which was a tower of assorted appetizers.
everything on this tower was amazing but my favorite was definitely the sweet pea soup which was a sweet and savory cold soup.

for my entree, i had the STRIPED BASS WITH EDAMAME PUREE.
if you knew me, you'd know that i'm extremely picky about my fish and the way it's prepared.
i typically like my fish slightly under but still piping hot.
this bass was exactly that!
i would say that my only complaint, if you can even call it that, was that the edamame wasn't really a puree, it was more like a slaw.
when i think puree, i imagine a creamy, hummus-like consistency which this was not at all but it was bursting with flavor and the onion dill sauce made me wanna lick my plate clean!

my hubby had the ""GRANDMA'S STYLE"" ROASTED CHICKEN which he said was the most tender, flavorful chicken he'd ever had.
so tender, he didn't even need a knife to cut through it.

our friend had the ROASTED DUCK BREAST WITH POPPY HONEY.
this dish was super interesting as it was served with kix cereal.
how fun!
he finished his meal in record time so it must've been delicious.

we shared a couple of desserts:
sake strawberry shortcake - i didn't have any since i don't do alcohol but my husband really enjoyed it and he also doesn't do alcohol!
miso toffee ice cream with potato chips - the ice cream was out of this world.
the addition of housemade potato chips was wild but it worked so well together.
i sometimes find myself at home craving something sweet so i go for some ice cream and soon after i find myself craving something salty so i go for some chips.
why i never considered putting them together is beyond me!

the food was simply amazing.
i absolutely enjoyed the outrageous blending of sweet, sour, savory and spicy.
i've yet to find another restaurant in vegas that combines these flavors in such a seamless manner and chef angelo does it so well.

as for the service...
our server, camille, was awesome!
she was attentive, prompt, knowledgeable and extremely friendly.
she gave us many suggestions and was able to describe all of dishes in detail.
she even invited us to return for some mah jong action in the upstairs bar.

2 of the managers stopped by our table twice during our meal, introduced themselves and made sure we were understanding and enjoying our meal.
we were also greeted by chef angelo's business partner and spoke with him briefly.
we sat 2 tables away from chef rick moonen and saw chef angelo when he came out to greet him.

from the moment we were greeted to the moment we took our last bite, there wasn't a single missed step during this amazing dining experience.
this was definitely one of the best meals i've had in quite some time.

poppy den is a fantastic new addition to our town and i must add that i'm so glad it's not on the strip.
most definitely as good as it gets!",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,21,17,5,-hAnTdHIlodVCSylQGoXxQ

But, boy, was it ever great!  The Happy Hour menu was well rounded and the few items I had were standouts in presentation and flavor.  The watermelon with spiced goat cheese salad was outstanding and the $2 Teriyaki Chicken Taco was alive with flavors and had a cilantro finish that was perfect.  I'm not much of an alcohol drinker so, I had a homemade peach sangria and was well worth the Happy Hour price of $5.  My friends had well drinks and stated they were very happy with them.  I only wish they had a better wine choice for Happy Hour.  One low quality Cabernet or a Chardonnay that was pretty lame.  The atmosphere sitting at the bar was delightful.  The outside temps at 5 pm were hovering around 100 degrees but, the doors and large windows were wide open.  I didn't feel any air conditioning on and the room was comfortable.

Flavors: 5 of 10
I love spicy foods. However in the dishes I had, the heat killed the dish. I couldn't get any other flavor profiles due to the excessive heat factor. Textures from the wok fried quinoa was spot on! Loved the crunch it had. And the mushrooms were spot on too, a bit more spice and the dish could have been killed.

2633146,2013-03-10,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Finally a fine dining establishment in Tivoli that I absolutely love, love love! Three ""loves"" because it was so good, I have returned three times in six days (four times in two weeks) It is really a breath of fresh air in a place that has been teetering on the brink of a slow painful death and mediocrity in dining options for a while. 

Had high hopes going to my first dinner here, which were increased by Yelperazzi who share my taste/preferences assuring me I'd love it. So, off to an early dinner with my siblings Sarah-Marie V & Anthony M on a recent Sunday. Anthony was greeted warmly by Camille and I took advantage of the complimentary champagne (or champagne cocktail=Kir Royale for me, please) they offer to ladies DAILY from 5-6:30PM. Since we all knew what we wanted, we were seated quickly. 

Our server Andrew whom we nicknamed Adam Levine, was truly engaging and well informed on the menu. (Big plus because I rely heavily on servers suggestions) sadly, several of the items we'd planned on were sold out, so we regrouped and shared the following tapas: 

""Deviled Egg"" and tuna tartare a huge hit; delicate sushi grade tuna with chopped egg doesn't sound like it would work but it did. A unique take on a classic dish. 

Jarred tuna: same ahi in a mason jar with crostini (Anthony and SM both said crostini was burnt) I'm not much of a mayo person, but this was a solid dish. 

Sun dried pineapple quinoa ""fried rice"" I could eat this every day for the rest of my life. There is tofu added & as someone who cooks with and eats tons of quinoa: I want this recipe. I've had it as my main dish on three return trips with extra tofu. It's packed full of protein and flavor. 

Main dishes:

Monkfish with caramelized onion jam was my fantastic entree. Perfectly cooked living up to the ""poor man's lobster"" nickname for texture and taste. The onion jam and accompanying dill balanced it perfectly. Another dish I'd do over again and again. 

Crispy Pork Belly was Anthony's choice (at two meals) and SM put her stamp of approval on it as well. SM had the duck with Brussel sprouts, she enjoyed it. Though not a carnivore but trust my ""siblings"" palates. We were stuffed, but Camille insisted on comping the sake soaked strawberry shortcake dessert. It was creative and delicious, not too sweet and what I'd have chosen.

I had the Chicken Curry and it again had good flavors, but the curry was so hot for some people it would have been inedible...and I like spicy! Later in the evening we were networking with some people during the Rock N Roll wine and they ordered several appetizers and were also not impressed. All around it seemed everyone complained. I had a sweet tooth and wanted to try a dessert, but honestly NOTHING sounded good or appetizing. So instead we went next door to the Mexican restaurant and had an amazing dessert.

Caesar salad: Darn delicious. The dressing is definitely lighter than the original Caesar.

Quinoa fried rice with pineapple: My favorite from the entire meal. It was so differently prepared from other times eating quinoa. Perfectly seasoned making me want another serving. 

Kimchi fried rice: Not a typical kimchi napa cabbage. It was definitely kimchi flavored and good especially with a fried egg on top although I had better in true asian places. Definitely light also and not leaving feeling heavy.

Miso Salmon: Good especially with the shishito peppers.

2672512,2013-06-14,1,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"My husband & I were driving around Summerlin on a Saturday night looking for a place to eat with no reservations. Honey Salt was a 1 hour wait (1st choice), Cheesecake factory which was just across the street had a line out the door, so we called Poppy Den and the hostess said there was no wait, so up the block to Tivoli Village we went. 

We were seated in their back patio while the sun was setting which was very romantic. The restaurant is beautiful and very modern. I love all the decor, including the bathrooms! So, looking over the menu, I wanted the pork belly which I read on Yelp was fantastic! When our server came over, I told him that's what I wanted. He was kind of a jokester, so when he told me that they were using a different cut of pork which isn't pork belly and it's kind of tough and dry, I thought he was joking. So I just laughed and was like ""no, really, I want the pork belly"". But apparently, he wasn't joking. I don't know why they insisted on serving this ""roasted pork belly"" with a different cut of meat rather than just removing it from the menu for the night. That was kind of strange and tells me a lot about this restaurant, in a negative light. Thank goodness the server warned me. I ended up going with the duck which was cooked medium rare I do believe, while my husband ordered the cheeseburger with the kim cheese fries, grilled bok choy, and kim chee fried rice. 

The duck was... alright. It was definitely on the sweet side, and cooked medium rare, it was not that amazing. I'm used to eat duck confit, and Chinese roast duck. Compared to those, I'd say this was sub-par. They were just kind of sweet, extra chewy, pieces of duck breast. The grilled bok choy was a nice side. Having eaten boy choy many different ways growing up, grilling them was pretty unique, but the price was crazy. At a chinese market, you can buy 1lb of bok choy for probably $2. That would come with 10-15 spears. Here, you get 2-3 spears (they are all slices in half) for $7. I think I'll just grill my own bok choy at home next time. The kim chee fried rice tasted like any other kim chee fried rice I've had, and it came in a much smaller portion than I'm used to. 

My husband's burger was weird. There was WAY too much cheese on it, with a strange sauce, and pickled cucumbers (like ban chan cucumbers) that he just didn't like. He didn't even eat more than 1/4th of it. He hated the kim cheese sauce (he said it tasted like cheese sauce mixed with Sriricha) but the fries were okay (it's pretty hard to mess up fries). Overall, I'd say we won't be back. This place is just an elegant place to eat poorly prepared and overpriced Asian cuisine.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,2,2,2,y-Y44wGq_IcvHCCGU9zFHw

For starters, we had the Watermelon and Goat Cheese salad and the General's Chicken Wings. The Watermelon Salad was unique and tasty. Definitely a must-get on future visits. The wings were good - nice and spicy but not like your typical wing. 

For dinner, my wife got the Pork Dumplings and Beef Lettuce cups from the Small Plates Menu. I got the Poppy Burger. The dumplings had a back-end heat that was surprising, but welcome. The lettuce cups were good, but I don't know that we'd get them again. The burger, though, was really good. I was in the mood for a good burger. The burger patty was cooked to a nice medium-rare. The egg was fried nicely. The pickles were yummy.

We were toying with getting dessert, but in the only real service faux pas of the evening, our server went missing. But, it felt like every other restaurant employee stopped by to check on us and every one of them recommended the homemade fortune cookie. We weren't going to get dessert (they were expecting several large parties around the same time.) But they recommendations were just overwhelming so we ordered it and we were glad we did! It was amazing. Not too sweet and quite light. Again, another must get.

Like I said, the service was above average but not awesome. Andrea, the manager stopped by several time to check on us. While our server did seem to forget about us for a little bit (we were his only inside table,) everyone else made up for it.

2952881,2013-03-31,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Last night I was wandering around Tivoli Village killing time and in search of food.  Nothing was looking too promising since most the places I saw were repeats from Town Square (yawn).  Out of nowhere I see a sign for a place called Poppy Den.  What's a Poppy Den and who is Angelo Sosa? I don't know the answers to either of those questions but remembered seeing a bunch of people on Yelp, who are far more into food than I, raving about the place.  And here it was, standing before me.

I was greeted by two pleasant young ladies at the front desk and was quickly seated out on the patio. What's this?!?  A patio dining space in Vegas that doesn't look out onto a parking lot!  I'm sold already.

Truthful statement in 1...2...3...The menu was a bit, well, unfamiliar to me ingredient-wise.  Some of the items I've never had before and the ingredients were foreign to me.  But that's what this is all about; trying something new.  I ordered a glass of cabernet while checking out the menu further. It was their house cab and tasted quite nice however I'd prefer a cab to be served in the proper wine glass, not a one size fits all wine glass.  I chose the Kim Chi fried rice for an appetizer/side dish.  Now I don't know who this Kim lady is but I'm in love with her fried rice. The presentation was cool since it had a whole sunny-side-up egg laid on top...different is good; I like that.  That stuff was amazing; I'll return just because of the fried rice.  For my entree I chose the steak and potatoes, with the steak medium plus. To my surprise the steak was cooked to the proper temperature (something a lot of places have a hard time doing) and was seasoned quite good. The potatoes, while odd in shape, were very good as well.  For desert, well, not really a fan of the strawberry shortcake.  The ice cream portion was great but the cracked pepper whipped cream was a shock to the taste buds; not for me.  The cake portion was kind of odd...not spongey, not flakey, not dense, not moist; something was just off about it and I can't put my finger on it.  The consistency was not to my liking.

I really dig the atmosphere of the restaurant inside and out.  And let's be real here for a minute, the couple short comings in the meal were made up by the outstanding service provided by Eddie; who evidently is from Texas but not a country boy. Whatever man...I enjoyed dining here because of you and will be requesting you next time around.

Thanks for providing a unique experience in the oftentimes tiring dining experience that occurs in Las Vegas.  I'm taking off one star solely based on a few menu selections not agreeing with my admittedly inexperienced pallet and the fact that I truly feel that wine should be presented in the proper glassware.

His cooking is a marriage between European and Asian, which he's mastered by his extensive travels throughout Asia. (Loved the food so much, I bought his Recipe book so I can attempt to recreate these dishes.)

Although the menu is seasonal, I hope you will have the opportunity to taste them before they change!
Tuna deviled eggs:: fresh tuna chopped up and mixed with crumbled hard boiled eggs, with a mystery thousand island-mayo'ish delicious dressing. Licked the plate clean!
Market Salad with Soy truffle dressing:: fresh mixed greens with a ponzu-citrusy dressing. So refreshing and a fine diversity of flavors.
Shishito Peppers:: such a simple appetizer. Typically, one in 10 peppers are spicy. In this case, they were all fresh and spicy, and crisped just right!
Striped Bass with Edamame puree:: Fried bass served on a beautiful platter with chopped edamame & carmelized onions; Once again, such a rare but perfect combination.
Roasted Duck breast with Poppy Honey::  the Duck was cooked perfectly medium rare. I was skeptical as I'm not into sweet foods, however the honey and sweetness worked just right for this Duck entree.

The seating areas are roomy and very comfortable.  I love the outdoor seating and music on cooler days, but we sat indoors at a booth.  Our server provided kimchee pickled cucumbers with bean sprouts, which was yummy and a great way to start brunch.  They have small plates, big plates, and sides.  The small plates are far from being small.  Their big plates are a good size for a meal, and the options are not so much that it takes an hour to decide.

For starters, we ordered pork dumplings, crab on toast with mango, and a poppy basket served with honey, compote, and poppy butter.  They are all delicious and light, even the pork dumplings.  Everything was cooked perfectly and delivered to the table well presented.

For our main meals we ordered the poppy burger done as the chef prefers, along with sunny side eggs  served with house made chicken sausage and potatoes, followed by mochi pancakes with a fruit compote and creme fraiche.  Every single dish was delicious, well portioned, and so good that I would come back for all of them again.

What I love the most are weird desserts, and their chips with miso toffee ice cream is fabulous.  I didn't get the same strong miso taste as another yelper complained about.  I found the ice cream with salty chips to be a great combination.  Their green tea brulee is yummy and comes with a great chili wafer.  If you look at it, you'd swear you were eating guacamole and chips, and I love playing with food like that.

The ambiance and behavior of the staff was exceptional. Our waiter  knew all of the dishes intimately and made great recommendations. I had the chicken wings as an appetizer and they were great; fresh hot, crispy glaze, amazing flavor and just enough spice to get the endorphins flowing. 

I'm docking two stars, because the main course and other dishes did not knock my socks off. It almost seemed like they were pre-cooked then under a heat lamp for a while. I ordered the Peking Duck, and it was really dry. It may have been because I was drinking, but I wasn't able to salivate enough to chew and lubricate that dry duck's journey into my stomach. Because of that, I wasn't able to finish it. In other dishes the proportion of the ingredients seemed off. My partner had a soup which I tried, but it was a little bland and had a ton or raw sprouts. The temperature of the soup was pretty low, so the sprouts were just kind of sitting there not contributing to the dish. 

I think Angelo needs to develop his flavors and ratios just a little bit more and then this will be a five star place on every level. The mood and layout has a laid back but highend feel. My waiter really knew his stuff and seemed to care about what he was doing. Our hostess went up stairs to retrieve us from the bar and sat us promptly.

Free champagne for ladies for happy hour! I was stoked because I wanted to drink, but I wanted something light (not beer). The menu looked so interesting--so many eclectic combinations of unusual spices and ingredients. For example, a watermelon salad with goat cheese and candied wasabi?! We had to try it.

We also ordered the tomato soup, recommended by our waiter, who had a great personality and delivered commendable service by the way. The soup WAS very good like he said, but much too sweet for tomato, which is the only thing I would change. We also ordered grilled cheese off the kids menu alongside the soup, which is one of my favorite comfort food pairings.

As for the watermelon salad, it was one of the most flavorfully interesting dishes I've tried. The only critique I have for the dish is that the candied wasabi was much too candied--the wasabi had no bite and the flavor of it was faint and overshadowed by the sugar. Other than that, we were impressed with how they came up with this combination, mostly because we tried to imitate this dish at home and failed (how does one candy wasabi??). 

Overall, my boyfriend and I cannot wait to come back here to try more dishes. Maybe next time we'll get some of their specialty cocktails, since we were boring last time and just ordered beer and champagne.",IfgOJxjRPDTIJnXDfRUZKw,1,0,4,MG24XMI5ueLqYwbhhmqYrw

But the soup had a nice kick with curry and a hint of lemon grass I believe.  It was served with some charred bread that was so good.  I mopped the entire bowl and could've had a basket of the bread.

The main entree i had was the Monkfish with Jam and Dill Ginger.  It's a play on a Vietnamese Catfish with Dill (Cha Ca Thang Long).  The dill and sweet onions paired perfectly with the tumeric from the monkfish.

I really liked Angelo on Top Chef and could not wait to try his food.

I sampled 4 different dishes all with an Asian flare. I heard Angelo has changed his menu several times since opening but this menu should be here to stay.

I ordered the watermelon salad, ramen soup, peppered chicken wings, pineapple fried rice, and Angel brought us out a taste of his tomato soup.

The pineapple fried rice and chicken wings were sensational. The rice had amazing flavor and the sausage and pineapple complimented each other wonderfully. The chicken wings were finger licking good. I could not get enough, and usually when it comes to fried wings I can't handle much of them. The watermelon salad was good, but I would have preferred if a different garnish was used. The cilantro did not really go with the goat cheese or the caramelized wasabi. Only dish I did not like and actually sent back was the ramen soup. It had no flavor and was very surprised after tasting everything else. 

My girlfriend and I had a very nice interaction with Chef Angelo. He introduced himself and then he brought out a taste of the tomato soup with curried whip cream. The tomato soup was the best I have ever had. I'm not a big fan of soup in general but I slurped it all up and would order it in the future. A little while later he brought us out some bacon froth he just made up in the kitchen. The experience was absolutely lovely and Chef Angelo is an incredible chef that has a great vision.

Small plates great for sharing- and hip and beautiful atmosphere. We ate on the patio. It was not too crowded to get in around 7 on a Friday without reservations. The drinks were good just stuck to generic didn't go with their signature cocktails. We had the 2 quinoa dishes - they were both great. Watermelon salad also very good. The curry tofu was above average. Saw Angelo Sosa - I had no idea who he was but other people at table did and were excited.

Cons: Lots of service- in the kind of above and beyond interject into your night kind of way- still better than bad service and was fine with a group of friends but would have been annoying on a date.  The crab toast with mango- mustard  was Ok. The eggplant was not good at all.

It seems unusual that mid week at 5:30 PM 3 items were not available. 
My biggest complaint was that we were not informed upon ordering. It should be standard practice to brief the staff at the beginning of the shift as to specials and items that are not available.

3251917,2014-07-13,1,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Poppy Den is one of the only restaurants we haven't tried in Tivoli.  Having lived most of my life in California, we were inundated with Asian Fusion in the 90's.  But we tried it the other night and we were pleasantly surprised.  

The bar and dining room is attractive.  It was around 6:30 on a Friday evening and it was pretty empty, but I think they have a dining room upstairs.  

Service was very good.  We ordered a few cocktails and tried a couple apps:

Garlic Edamame - Tasty but undercooked.   I couldn't even get the beans out of some of them because the shell was still raw. 

Watermelon & Goat Cheese - I think this is one of their signature apps.   Not a fan.  Weird contrast in flavor and texture.  

For our meals, we ordered their skewers and curry.  

Skewers are good but portions are small.  

We challenged the kitchen to make the curry extra spicy and it was exceptionally good.  Only complaint is the amount of protein.  The curry dishes were less than $10 but you really had to dig for the meat.  I would rather pay $15 and have more protein.  

Good meal.  Enjoyed the experience.  Will be back.",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,0,2,4,8DAjWDxK2uXAxlMsBtwmsg

My boyfriend and I came in here last night to grab a cocktail while we were waiting for a spot at the bar at brio to open up. The usual bartender Will wasn't here but we sat down anyways. 5 minutes later after watching the bartender hit on this poor girl he finally came over to us. He approached us as if we were a burden, an inconvenience to him. He put two cocktail menus in front of us and the happy hour specials. I asked him if they still had the champagne happy hour for girls he rolled his eyes shook his head, laughed and walked away. My boyfriend called out he wanted a Guinness. 13 minutes later (yes I timed it) my boyfriend was finished w his beer and I still wasn't able to order my cocktail. I told him to make me his favorite specialty cocktail that was on the happy hour list. He made me what's called a ""naked lunch"" 1oz of sake, aperol, vodka, line juice and coke. When I saw him pouring all the alcohol I turned to my boyfriend laughed and said ""well I guess your getting lucky tonight!"" The bartender looked at me and said, ""this isn't all booze it's not that strong"" handed me the cocktail and asked if we were going to eat we said no but thank you. His reply ""well we have tables available, our dining room is gorgeous."" That was my cue he really didn't want us sitting at his bar. We asked for the check and realized he didn't charge is the happy hour price for my cocktail, when I asked about this he laughed and walked away. I paid full price (not a huge deal but it's the principle of the matter) and we left. He yelled out after us that we had change. 

When I asked the hostess what his name was she didn't give us any info just asked if everything was ok. Hopefully I can return for dinner when will is bartending and ill be able to update this review to a better exp.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,14,7,1,cgAR03hFtYfocWJOiRGZbg

Wait... We're supposed to talk about the food, right?..... Haha, my bad.

Anyway, you should come to this gem of a restaurant located inside of Tivoli Village. I guess it was restaurant week, I had no clue what that even was until Tien N. informed me. DOH!

It was so great of Christina W. to plan this fun outing! I got to see some familiar faces, as well as meet few new ones. Oh Yelp, you bring such awesome people into my life :)

I have tried the pork belly here, and it's not as good as at Gordon Ramsay, but it's damn close. So tender, so decedent.

The RW choices I made was the Tomato Soup to start with. Such a great choice! It was light, flavorful, with a swirl of something extra inside it. I don't know what is was, but it made the soup taste even better somehow. I got to nibble on Vanessa N.'s Watermelon and Goat Cheese salad too. I don't know if you guys knew this, but goat cheese on watermelon is the best!! YUM.

I had the Monkfish with dill after. TOO MUCH DILL!!! It was kinda crazy how much garnish they put on top of it. But honestly, if you have fingers then you can just pick it off, so it really was not a big deal for me. The fish was firm, yet still light in it's texture. I had never had monkfish before, and I love the texture of the fish. It had some meat to it, not flaky at all. 

For dessert, I had the Strawberry Sake Shortcake. The black pepper whipped cream was to DIE for. Really great touch. I didn't really taste much sake in the ice cream, but I'm a drinker, so I really like to taste the booze in something if it's supposed to have it in there. That's just me, though. 
Kevin P. let me try some of his Miso Ice Cream with Chips. I really thought this was a clever and fun dessert concept. I loved using the salted potato chip to scoop up the ice cream, and the combination of the two flavors worked well together. The chips were a bit on the salty side, as Regina P. had pointed out, but I like salt so I was alright. But I could see how it might overwhelm some folks who don't like heavily salted food.

A very fun time! Service is always second to none here. The servers are great, and they put up with our drunk as*ses all the time and never complain! We also got to meet Angelo himself, and he complimented my name and my hair.... Very sweet man :)",YTDM5iqsTFIyi1oUBhE1aA,6,5,4,FQfE7o-eyHQHg0yVUtFWHA

Chef Angelo is very attentive and came through checking how everyone was doing and how the food was (which by the way was amazing). 

While we waited for our food, our two year old was a little stir crazy, so my wife took him out front to walk around. Angelo came out with a small bowl of fresh blueberries for our son.

3496569,2013-03-16,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"We paid $110 for our meal at Poppy Den and walked out hungry after two hours. Yikes.

My husband thought the hostess at the front was kind of rude but I didn't notice that myself. I did notice that after we were seated, it took a LONG TIME for anyone to bring us menus or water. Yes, the restaurant was busy but there were about a million servers walking around so I am not sure why everything took so long.

We ordered our food, one small and one large plate per person which our waitress explained is not the thing to do here, as it is a ""shared concept."" Ok, every meal we have is a shared concept so whatever, bring the plates out however you want!

My watermelon and goat cheese salad with candied wasabi was YUMMY but I wish the watermelon had been a little more chilled. Warm watermelon... no thanks. This was honestly my favorite dish. I didn't care as much for the crab toast my husband ordered but it was decent.

Our large plates took about a million years to arrive. We just sat there and sat there and sat there. The waitress offered to get us some fries or something in between and it took SO LONG that I honestly feel that at any other restaurant that would be comped but maybe we didn't spend enough money to warrant special treatment. The fries with ""kim cheese"" sauce were not so great but we were hungry so we ate them. The sauce is waaaay too sweet and the fries are obviously frozen.

Large plates...  this is a hilarious misnomer because the pieces of fish are itsy bitsy. My husband's striped bass with edamame puree was honestly yummy. I kept stealing bites. My mahi mahi on onion jam with dill was totally blah. The fish had no flavor and the onion jam was cold so the whole dish quickly became a gross lukewarm.

Our waitress was honestly quite pleasant despite the restaurant's hiccups and mediocre food but overall I just felt ripped off. I'd like more food, more quality and more service (seriously, the length of time we waited between courses was outrageous) for the three-figure price tag. I'm not sure that even the promise of the free champagne happy hour for ladies could bring me back.",rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ,2,0,2,xlD0MntJ8B0eP_mZJSpggA
3509330,2013-03-11,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"A bunch of us Yelpers met up here for Sunday brunch during restaurant week. They offered 2 menu's; their regular brunch menu and the restaurant week special menu. The special menu is $20.13 for a 3 course meal. Your choice of: tomato soup (yum!) or watermelon goat cheese (YUM!) followed by monkfish with tons of dill and sauteed onions or poppy den burger and finally dessert, ice cream with potato chips or sake soaked strawberry shortcake.
The service was very good today. Our waitress took our orders down the table and everything was brought out not only quickly, but efficiently as well. I've been here several times and when I've been here with large groups, we were 9 today, I've found the pace of the food to be strange. Today, it as perfect! Everyone who ordered from the special menu got their appetizer at the same time. Same with meal and dessert. I enjoyed that MUCH more than their usual style. Our waitress had no problem splitting the bill 7 ways, she was pretty cheerful about it. She didn't charge the 18% gratuity either. (I dont care either way, I know some people do).
The food was tasty today as well. I enjoyed the watermelon goat cheese. There should have been a bit more green on the plate, both for taste and asthesices. The clover was so good, it needed more. The crunchy wasabi was delish! So good. Maybe for presentation a cute small cup with extra of that. I really liked those. I tasted the tomato soup and that was DE freakin LICIOUS!!! Wowser! I wish I would have gotten that. I'm totally getting that next time I come. (maybe 2!).
The monkfish was pretty good. It reminded me of the fish sandwich I got the first time. Man, chef Angelo really really likes dill. They put a LOT of dill on the fish here. I dont mind dill, but it doesnt need that much. We think the sauteed onions would taste better if they added some dill to them.
The dessert was really good too. I've had the ice cream and chips dessert and it just doesnt do it at all for me. So, I didnt expect much from the sake shortcake. I was very pleasantly surprised. The first bite I was unsure, but I really did enjoy it. I wish that one dish was a touch larger. Very good.
As usual, we had a great time. Lots of laughs. Great food, great company. As it ended, chef Angelo came out and said hello. He shook all of our hands, and took some photo's with us. Pretty cool. 
Next time I come, I'm getting the tomato soup and the shrimp and grits. I know that's gonna be a fantastically delicious meal!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,1,1,4,REKsV8c1VITcXR3zW_r6Ig
3519469,2013-02-13,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Is Angelo Sosa the next Wolfgang Puck? Ol' Wolfy started a Vegas revolution when he opened Spago back in '92 and other celebrity chefs followed. Sosa is one of the first TV celeb chefs to open a spot in the Vegas 'burbs and hopefully more will follow (it's great to hear Bradley Ogden has plans to open a new restaurant in Tivoli soon, also). Comparing Sosa's culinary chops to Puck's might be a stretch right now, but his food is tasty.

Here's what I've tried:

Jarred tuna ($12) - unique presentation in a square glass dish; tuna was decent quality, well seasoned with a little heat.

Watermelon and goat cheese ($8) - nice presentation, flavors worked well together, really loved the candied wasabi that added a nice crunchy texture.

Pork pot stickers ($9) - order of 5 sitting in a shallow bowl with a sweet, thick sauce

Tuna deviled eggs ($12) - eggs are cut up in pieces, next to a mound of tuna tartar. Odd combination, but it worked.

Korean BBQ short ribs ($11) - about 5 small pieces of short ribs. The typical sweetness and spicy depth of Korean ribs was replaced with a more mild profile that was dominated mainly by the charred exterior.

Pork belly ($21) - very interesting dish, large strip of pork belly with a thick tempura-like exterior topped with cabbage, pears, etc. I loved the different sweet and sour notes of the dish. Bold savory flavors. Biggest issue is that the thick crust takes away from the best part of pork belly --  taking a bite and experiencing the crispiness of the crust, the lusciousness of the fat, and the tenderness of the meat. The crust dominated the textures and while it was a delicious dish it doesn't beat eating a more simple, typical version of pork belly.

Chocolate cake ($7) - baked in a tea cup; came with miso ice cream and caramel popcorn, cake was delicate and airy.

Strawberry shortcake ($7) - miso ice cream, whipped cream. I thought it was supposed to be soaked in sake?! I didn't taste it. A decent dessert, but I prefer the chocolate cake.

They also have a kid's menu for those that want to dine early with the little ones. It's a smart move considering it's the suburbs. Another smart move is the pricing. Way cheaper than eating on the Strip. Let's hope more quality restaurants open off-Strip so my wallet won't take as much of a beating when i dine out.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,7,3,4,txJLG5TXZMe5krX1LcsQWQ

1st Course-Tomato Soup:  Layers of flavor.  Earl, who is not a tomato kind of guy, loved this soup.  The Watermelon salad with goat cheese was very delicious too.  The goat cheese was of great quality, and I love the crunchy wasabi that was added to this dish.

2nd Course-Earl and I both got the monkfish with onion jam and dill.  The fish was cooked to perfection.  The meat has the same texture as lobster.  

3rd Course-Strawberry Sake Shortcake: We liked the black pepper whipped cream on top of this shortcake.  Other than that, it was pretty plain to me.  The Chips and Icecream was interesting.  The chips were a tad too salty for me.  The lemon poppy icecream was pretty good.  Only gripe is that there wasn't much icecream or chips, compared to another table that was ahead of us, who also did the restaurant week spring menu.  Upon inquiry, we were told that the amount of icecream and chips on that dessert will be the new quantity on that dessert.

Service was awesome!  Our waitress was very friendly and personable.  Added to this memorable fun lunch was to have it with an awesome group of people.  Lots of fun and laugh.  Additionally, we got to take pictures with Angelo Sosa!!!  I was hoping that we will see him today too.

I love mochi anything, so I ordered the Mochi Pancakes on the ""Big Plates"" section, and Wifey ordered the Fish Sandwich with Fries and Kim Cheese Sauce so we could share both plates. When the pancakes arrived, it was a Sh-Stack... way less than a short stack! More like 2 small tortillas with a sprinkle of berries and a little dollop of creme fraiche! Although the flavor was good, $11 is definitely not worth it, and I should have gone with a sandwich or burger which was about the same price.(The photo is a zoomed in shot) Either remove these from the big plates menu, or add at least 3 more pancakes to make up for the missing O, R, and T in short stack!?!?

The ice creams we all shared(Miso-Toffee, Lemon Poppy Seed, and Strawberry-Sake, all topped with Kettle Chips) were pretty good, but not too sure if I'd return after a not-so good first impression....still on the fence for Poppy Den...more like 3.5 stars....ALOHA!!!

3601671,2013-05-01,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"First let me start by saying that I am EXTREMELY lenient when it comes to service at restaurants because I had worked on that end of the food/beverage spectrum for years... but this place really needs to work with their wait staff on their serving skills (anticipation of the command, pre-busing, checking back in decent time intervals, etc).  Upon arriving to the restaurant I met some friends who were already seated, and I was greeted by one of them with the statement, ""Hey!  Order your drink/food now because we've been here about 30 minutes and are JUST getting our waters..."" assuming my friends were just being high maintenance I shook it off as always..but no joke the first drink took about 25 minutes, the second took about 20 minutes (and this was after multiple reminders to the server).  The food we ordered as a group came out in shifts so that at one point some of our group was almost finished with their food by the time others had just begun.

I ordered the Korean short ribs which were flavorful but no where near as tender as I'd hoped, and honestly I feel like the meat was no better than the Hawaiian steak I get from the Aloha Grill for half the price.
I also ordered the Kimchee fried rice, which was tasty, but again I feel as if I've had better for less.  I'm a ""foodie"" so I can appreciate costly food when it's worth it, and again, these dishes were good... BUT I don't know if the pricing was accurate (personally for me).

On the POSITIVE side:
1) I ordered the Silk Road (beverage) and ordered a second because I liked it so much.  The drink was amazing and refreshing, with a little spicy kick.  For $9 the drink was pretty good, but could have been a little larger (it came in an almost 4-5oz coffee looking mug, but $9 in Vegas for any decent drink is doing well).
2) This beautiful girl who I believe was a hostess or manager brought us out complimentary Watermelon salads as appetizers due to our wait.  The Watermelon Salad with Goat cheese is amazing as everyone on this site has said, and I actually ordered one of my own even after the freebies.
3) The staff was extremely nice, and our server a sweetie (believe his name was Andrew?)

Chef angelo Sosa is just a master at his craft! I ordered the QUINOA ""FRIED RICE"" WITH SUN DRIED PINEAPPLE. Super delish and flavorful, with a hint of sweet. I would recommend this to try. Since I didn't get to try the MONKFISH (cries.) I ordered their MAHIMAHI WITH ONION JAM & DILL. Very powerful taste. It is super sweet. Good sweet. The fish portions are small portions of course so come prepared. 

The SHRIMP & GRITS was also delish, but it wasn't special or different from other shrimp and grits. So if you're looking for a good specialty dish. I steer away from this option if you already know what shrimp and grits taste like. I also suggest their WATERMELON SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE. It is very refreshing and the goat cheese makes a great combo with the watermelon cubes. Who knew! It gives a good kick punch to it!

Now for cocktails, I would suggest the HONEY AND HAZELNUT for a nice sweet girly, milky cocktail. It has Jack Daniels, honey, snap, coconut, nutella. It's sweet and milky like baileys or kahlua cream style. I had to order a second one after my first. It sure did do the trick. 

I also ordered their green tea creme brule which was also yummy.  It was very nice of the manager to also make the desserts on the house as her deep apologies for no monkfish. That was such a nice gesture, and she was also nice enough to show us the upper floor that is open during the evenings as a lounge area. It is very hip and they play music there as well.

So we were still hungry hopped over to kona and had a blast 

Would definitely not go out of my way for this place. Don't know If I  would even go back. I hate to get disappointed!",qKJEQrFtW33HWqKzvn3U4A,3,2,3,uPxexik0B4C_FdYyJ8nYfg

The first time my friends and I shared the appetizer tower, it was nice because you got a little bit of everything to try. We then came back for Spring 2013 Restaurant Week, and were treated to even more tasty plates. I haven't been able to get the Watermelon Goat Cheese Salad out of my mind since, I just have a hard time ordering it when I'm there because, it's $9 and not very big, so I can't get full on watermelon and then drink, yea know what I mean? For my entree, I had the Monkfish. This was heaven, best monkfish I've had since Buddakan in NYC. And for dessert we had, the Vanilla Ice Cream served with homemade potato chips. This was really creative and delicious. Other menu items I've had, not a huge fan of the Seabass, thought is was a bit dry. My favorite, along with the rest of the crowd is the Pineapple Quinoa Fried Rice. Can't get enough. I like the cocktails here, only thing I wish they would bring back the boba they used in the China Cat Sunflower.

It does not exist anymore. I made a reservation through Yelp for tonight and when I arrived the place was empty and they didn't have my reservation in their books.

When I sat down, I was handed a 1 page menu with what appeared to be only a few bar food selections. NO Peking Duck. Also, no Chef Sosa. I asked the manager about it and he said they changed the menu. The staff was very nice about it, but the fact remains, what is up on their website in terms of a menu and in reviews is false advertising.

Elniño, a friend from Yelp, and I met for lunch at Poppy Den today to try this addition to Tivoli Village.  It was a perfect winter day so we decided to eat out on the patio.  

For the first course, I chose Amma's homemade tomato soup with curried whipped cream, cilantro, and extra virgin olive oil.  The tomato soup was very good.  I didn't think the curry whipped cream added anything to the dish but color.  The EVOO on the other had helped bring out the tomato flavor.

The second course was monk fish with onion jam and dill ginger, garlic and coriander.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a good flavor.  It was a nice light fish for a lunch.

We also shared an order of quinoa fried rice.  We both enjoyed this.

The third course was chips and ice cream.  There were two kinds of homemade ice cream, yuzu and poppyseed and lemon and poppyseed accompanied by potato chips stacked vertically in the ice cream.  The homemade chips had good grains of salt on them which countered the ice cream beautifully.

Service was good. Our server and I talked about Little Finland in the Gold Butte area of Nevada and we talked about going there with/without 4 wheel drive.  He was a pleasant server!

I enjoyed the lunch and the day was so beautiful with temperatures nearing 80.  At the end of lunch, the sun on my back became almost too warm and we made a retreat through the restaurant to our respective cars.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,4,4,H_9myC3DC4PG2Byo5fPLCQ

3985852,2013-07-19,3,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"I came here for happy hour, then dinner.  I was very pleased with everything, overall, especially since I didn't like an item: Say what?  If you want to know more, you're gonna have to read more...

I came in on a Tuesday night (dead night for most restaurants).  I was meeting someone a little later for dinner but wanted to see what Happy Hour was like.  First, Happy Hour is only available in the bar area (not sure about patio).  The happy hour menu is all 5 bucks, several apps, well drinks, & draft beer.  In keeping with an Asian theme, I had a pint of Asahi and the Pork Dumplings.  The dumplings were served like fried won ton triangles (with plenty of tasty pork filling) & sitting in a sweet/sour/spicy sauce. If I was rating on happy hour alone, this woulda been a 4 star review.  Dinner & extraordinary customer service got the coveted 5th star.

For dinner, we ordered the Sweet Pea Soup, Caprese, and the Poppy Burger w/  Poppy Fries..

- Sweet Pea Soup: Like Klingon revenge, it is served cold.  It is sweet & gingery.  Neither I nor my friend cared much for it.  More on how we got satisfaction at the end.
- Caprese: Served with large heirloom tomatoes.  This dish was classically flavorful; big slices of tomato & mozzarella, chopped basil, & a great aged balsamic reduction.  I forgot to ask for ground pepper, but truthfully, it didn't need it.
- Poppy Burger: A great burger with kimchi pickles, fired egg, & magic.  This was served with Poppy Fries (kimchi cheese fries).  The kimchi cheese sauce was so good; sweet, cheesy, spicy.  I will probably order this every time I come here.  WOWZERS!

Finally, the service.  It was good service & friendly, but here is what amazed me.  As my friend ate a spoonful of the Sweet Pea Soup, she made a sour face to me to show her displeasure.  This was seen by our server, who was at another table, who immediately said, ""I assume you didn't like the soup, I'll take that away for you.""  Obviously, it was also removed from our bill.  Maybe she got lucky, maybe she was just good. 

Will I go back, YES!  I wish they were open late at night, but no matter, bring on the Quinoa Fried Rice!",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,5,3,5,qZ9VskKZNn-5dAzPeB4Usw

4012957,2013-03-15,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Review for Restaurant Week 2013, it was so good that I had to spread the word and show up for a second visit!

My first visit for Restaurant Week was with my foodie buddy Angela T. on the first day of Restaurant Week and the first possible meal you can grab, lunch!  Set at $20.13 I was shocked to see the bill at the end, I thought I was eating a $30 lunch.  

I had the Watermelon Salad, Monk Fish, and Strawberry Shortcake.  I chose the opposite of Angela's order (she had the soup and chips/ice cream) to sample what they had to offer.  My salad was GREAT, just the perfect serving of watermelon with goat cheese and hints of the candied wasabi(!!), EVOO sprinkled around but read the caption I posted of the tomato soup picture, I WANT THAT RECIPE!  The curry cream fit perfectly with this version of tomato soup.  I'm glad the General's chicken wasn't part of this menu to be honest because it's good and that's what I would always order from the small plates section on any other day.

Next is the Monkfish, delicious.  A little bit of extra dill ginger but I brushed off what I didn't need.  Last year I had the Monkfish at Verandah and while it was cooked with extreme high culinary skill I favored the straight off the pan style.  Then came the dessert, I had a double stack of the strawberry shortcake, one was topped with strawberry shortcake ice cream and the other with mixed cream.  Angela had the ice cream and chips, she had two healthy scoops of ice cream and plenty of chips!  

So with that said, I recommended to all my Yelp friends and real life friends to come and steal this deal: Tomato Soup, MonkFish, and Chips/Ice Cream.

----

2nd visit!  The beautiful Amanda opened the giantic doors for me to walk through and I was shown my table.  But pretty much the same excellent experience happened but instead of a couple people, a gang of us showed, 12 or so.  Winner!  And to top it off Chef Sosa showed up!  When I was looking for Amanda I spotted Chef standing by the small hallway and no one else noticed, so I had to do the gasp and point him out to everyone and he came to say hi and took pictures with us.  Out of my 5 prior visits, I have never seen him once!   So for everyone who came because of RW, LUCKY!!!!

The only disappointing part was when the desserts came out, I mentioned to everyone and showed them pictures as well of my last visit that this was severely downgraded.  I had two chips on one scoop of ice cream.  I figured it was because we were a larger party or they didn't expect for word to be spread about this being one of the better RW lunches.  

I want to thank Poppy Den for participating and if they haven't already made me a returning customer, I know they've made some of my Yelp friends into one.  Can we see a unique dish for Restaurant Week next time??

Edit:  And with this five star rating I bumped Poppy Den into the 4 star overall rating.  Well deserved!",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,2,6,5,zTymWSDQy_gKWyhe0DtzlA

4055110,2013-03-11,10,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Restaurant Week...This is stop #1 for me.  

Met a few Yelpers on a nice Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The RW menu consisted of  an appetizer, the meal, and dessert.  All for just $20.13.  Considering that this place normally serves well presented food and at a higher cost than average, $20.13 is a steal.  However, I actually was one of the fools that didn't order off the RW menu and got their Fish Sandwich, Poppy Fries, and Ice Cream.  The tilapia in the sandwich is fairly sized, flaky, and flavorful.  This was prepared like their Monkfish with a mix of dill and sauteed onions.  All of this was then caramelized and placed inside a bun. This was delicious and I still could imagine the taste while I type out this review.  Nothing really special about their fries, but complimented the sandwich perfectly.  For dessert, I got their Miso Ice Cream with Chips.  The ice cream was perfect immediately following a rich tasting fish sandwich. 

Now for the bonus of the afternoon...Angelo Sosa himself.  I overheard him saying to another Yelper that he only gets a chance to visit this restaurant one week out of the month. He went straight to our table, talked a little, and posed in a photo with us. According to the other Yelpers in our party, the food was extraordinaire today.  I wonder if it's because the boss was present.  Great dude that serves great food!!!  Hah..a rhyme every time.  

Shout Outs:  Another great time with other Yelpers.  Yelpers that I met for the first time today included Ife A, Kevin P, Regina P, Earl C, and Jade W.  It was nice meeting you all and look forward to our next event.  And I can't forget Christina W, Arvin C, Vanessa N, and Anthony M.  Another meal with good people.

4057898,2013-03-26,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"I really, really, really wanted to like this place.  And it's not just because I had a major crush on Angelo on his season of Top Chef.   Sadly, I think my crush has been cured.

Let's start with the pluses:  (1) This restaurant is decorated fabulously.  It looks like a cool, hip bar/restaurant you might find in Cabo.  Very tasteful and super sexy lighting.  (2) All of the staff was very accommodating and because the place was kind of empty, we had our choice of seating.  Probably a good thing since we dumbly started out on the patio and decided to move inside because we were freezing.  Two of us had a specialty cocktail.  I tried the Silk Road.  If you are a huge fan of tequila, you may enjoy this drink.  I did not.  The tequila was so over-powering that I didn't even finish it. 

We decided to do appetizers and ordered: (1) Pupu Platter; (2) General's Chicken Wings; (3) quinoa fried rice; and (4) Fries.  The fries were excellent and I also really liked the fish fritter balls on the pupu platter.  That just sounds wrong.  Everything else was pretty Meh.  The chicken wings had a great flavor and crispiness to the skin, but were so fatty that we didn't eat all of them.  We actually didn't finish anything but the fries and left feeling pretty unsatisfied.  Although I will pass on Poppy Den, obviously, a lot of people love this place and I hope it does really well, as it is always exciting to see young chefs making it happen.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,2,0,3,nND_7vvYSP3uqqhP3LNmwA
4109554,2014-05-12,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Review for Upstairs Banquet Area Only:

This review was regarding my experience in the upstairs portion of Poppy Den to which I attended a wedding reception.

The 2 ways to get to the second floor is by taking a boring set of stairs and the other way is the sweet Elevator ride that is decked out with wicked wallpaper of famous woman entertainers and a spin the wheel telephone to call the operator. Big props to whoever design the elevator.

So the layout is great, divided into 3 sections you have the outside seating area with couches and table tops. Great views at night with the neon trees. The second section is the indoor seating area with a small dance floor to get your boogie on. And the third and final section is the bar and lounge areas located near the top of the stairs and elevator.

The food that was served was a few different sliders, assorted tacos and a few other tapas that elude me. Even though I only ate a slider and a couple of tacos I will say they were all very good. My favorite being the seafood indian curry taco!!!

The service and flexibility of the staff was to be commended. Not once did the food quality or drinks being served ever come into question. All party members were all extremely happy with nothing ever being too much. The bartenders were a hoot!!! Very social and a credit the management.

The one thing That prevents me from handing out a 5 stars was the furniture. Yes I understand the vintage look they are going for but to have the lounges and couches propped on bricks was a little scary.

It's the 21st century...get with the program people...update your website, Open Table and Yelp.  I'm pretty sure it's not that difficult to change the time from 10 am to 11:30am.  We got there a little bit early but since we saw that they opened at 10 am we figured it would be ok to be early for our 11 am reservation. We ended up walking around until 11 because it didn't look open at ""10:50 am.""  We were excited when we heard the clock chime 11 times so we hurriedly walked over to Poppy Den. Some other lady was talking to what looked like the manager but long story short the story the manager gave me was that they are going through changes and have not had a chance to update anything. In any case I couldn't wait another 30 minutes...I was starving! We never get to go out without the baby and this was our chance so we left disappointed and me a bit angry. 

Will I give Poppy Den another chance? Perhaps, but their food better be amazing when I go. My husband told me there's nothing like a hungry woman scorned. Ain't that the truth?",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,8,2,1,Qypxi7EHLzEJJhKWNKmsVQ

I was really excited to eat at an Asian gastropub, but the menu didn't seem gastropub enough.  It did have some small and large plates, but didnt have that gastropub feel.  We had a good meal nonetheless.  

Started with a few small plates. Sweet pea soup which is a cold soup.  Very smooth and creamy with a wonderful pea flavor.  It was poured table side.  Crispy pork dumplings which were like Gyoza.  The filling had a wonderful flavor and the sauce really complemented the dumpling. Amma's homemade tomato soup.  It was okay, a little sweet.  Not one of my favorites. Caesar salad with yuzu dressing.  Very good salad, the dressing was good and if I remember right I believe it had some fish pieces in it.  It was very good all together. Tuna deviled eggs were the best dish of the night.  Chopped tuna next to chopped eggs with an oil if I'm not mistaken.  Odd combination but it worked. 

Next we all had large plates. I had the shrimp and grits.  The grits were made with coconut milk.  It was great at first but as you continued to eat it it became really sweet. The shrimp were cooked perfectly though.  Roasted chicken, the chicken had a lot of flavor but the vegetables served with it were just okay.  You expect a little more, it was a boring plate. Crispy pork belly was awesome.  Pork belly was crispy and sauce was outstanding.  Miso salmon with shishito peppers was just so-so.  The salmon was cooked perfectly but the plate was just bland.  We also had the kimchi fried rice.  The fried rice needed a lot more flavor, very bland.  Almost like they didn't add any spices or salt.

We ended up eating dinner at Poppy Den both times. The weather was perfect at night outside and it really ended up being a relaxing experience. 

ATMOSPHERE
The dainty trees were lit up with colorful lights on the patio seating area, which really made the atmosphere and matched the type of outing us girls were looking for. There was music, but not enough to drown out our conversation. The mini garden-esque idea really matched the small plates and wine selections that were offered for happy hour. It made us feel light, happy and care-free~


FOOD
Our food was delicious! And as I am currently going with a pescatarian lifestyle, the happy hour menu was perfect for me. Everything was only $5 each too.

1. HOUSE SUMMER SANGRIA
Won't get you drunk but will definitely get you happy. It was the essence of a summer fruit drink. Loved it with my spicier appetizers.

2. EDAMAME, delicious spicy oil with Asian fusion flavos. Could be addictive! 

3. WATERMELON SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE, My goooooodness... YES.

4. SHRIMP TACOS, Well-seasoned, crispy and lots of flavor! It comes with two tacos, well worth the price. It won't make you full, but it's enough to be able to sample other appetizers and have a satisfying meal.

5. AVOCADO TACOS, Perfect amount of avocado and the salsa and sauce complemented this savory and yummy dish well. Lots of creamy, fresh and salty flavors here =)

6. FRIES WITH KIM-CHEESE SAUCE, Me loves the kim-cheese sauce! I want to try make this at home. So simple, so good. I try not to eat too much fried food, but the kim-cheese sauce needed to be in my mouth. Soo... I think I ate most of it! Sorry to the ladies at the table! 

7. MISO TIRAMUISU, Very, very... interesting. And salty. And... different. It was like a tiramisu, with cream and spongey cake. But in-between bites, I had strong hints of miso paste and crunchy honey peanuts. I think my taste buds were confused with this one. I kept eating it though because I was either intrigued, or I thought it was just so weird that someone came up with this dessert.  

8. GIANT FORTUNE COOKIE DESSERT, The delicious cream inside, the fresh berry sorbet & berries, combined with the crunchy shell of the fortune cookie. Loved it, thanks to the cream and the sorbet. Would order it again. Now, if there was some way I could have a gallon of it...


SERVICE
We were treated VERY well by the ladies at the hostess table, whom even helped to give us tips on what was good, and consistently checked up on us in the beginning, when it wasn't busy. We even got to meet one of the chefs, Alexa, who asked us how our meal was and was very nice about answering our questions about our food. 

Maybe the one thing that we had a problem with was when our main server whom we asked for water, said he would bring it right away, and then proceeded to delegate our request to another server. When it didn't come for another 15-20 minutes, we asked the main server again and he apologized for the other server. I thought that was kind of weird because he should have checked on us and got it himself, rather than putting the blame on someone else. It wasn't that big of a deal, but it was pretty hot and we were thirsty during the end of our meal.

Overall though, great experience, Would come again with the ladies or on a date!",W5GNz_rDc9r37Uav1mdocg,3,3,5,cWRy8s0Y2LCLErIoFyUuWg

2 words...Sake Sangria. Refreshing blend of sake, fruit juice & muddled fresh fruit that dangerously creeps up on you...I recommend you get the pitcher :)
There were so many intriguing choices on the menu that we wanted to try. The Quinoa Fried Rice is definitely one you won't find anywhere else. The tofu was a bit odd as it seemed overly cooked and chewy but complimented the dish well. Not everyday you get a healthy version of fried rice. The Mac & Cheese (yes we opted for comfort food) was the best and had yuzu in it that added a nice lightness. The meatballs were delicate & tender in a flavorful sauce. The crispy pork dumplings were good in a thick sweet sauce. The poppy fries with kimchi cheese sauce were crispy with flecks of poppy and the cheese sauce was light & creamy.
The servers were all very attentive and we also saw Chef Sosa floating around. The finale was a fortune cookie dessert stuffed with whipped cream infused with strawberry beer with a mango sorbet alongside fresh berries...compliments of the Chef.
Poppy Den is a wonderful departure from functional eating that elevates you to a personal appreciation of the innovative fusion vision of Chef Sosa.",bzU8Cl6B9nqV1i5NReobvw,14,10,5,B0oMN3J_pcS6oE1B0ZfFww

The watermelon salad is a must. Small plates to larger entrees are available.  Burger was fabulous.  Going back to try more.  They have fun cocktails too.  Just ask the bartender to recommend some.

4614728,2013-02-28,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"We came to check out this new venue on New Year Eve 2013. I personally enjoy the food as well as the decorations. It is tucked away in the quiet Trivoli Village where you don't even feel you are in Vegas! I can see this spot as a good fit for a nice date or simply friends hanging out. 

As we walked in the entrance, we were immediately greeted by the pretty hostesses. Besides their beautiful smiles, they offer coat check which is not seen normally in other places, even those ones on the strip. On the right hand side, there is a full service bar which can seat about 10 people comfortably. The inside is fairly dark but my eyes are quickly drawn to the beautiful decorations. The lights, the wall papers, the little candle on the table, even the door knobs,etc, some are rusty some are contemporary with Asian influence, it gives a ""arty"" feeling to it. I can feel I am already in love with the decoration before we even try the food! On the TV at the bar, they are playing traditional Cantonese movies with English subtitles. 

They have high table seating, regular table seating as well as booth seating at the first floor, and more tables and a small bar at the second floor plus a mini lounge area. Again the decoration is amazing! I also wanted to ask them where they got that light from and put them in my house! lol They also have a outdoor sofa seating area (no tables) where you can look over the balcony and enjoy the colorful lights outside. It was a bit too cold for that tho on New Year Eve. 

When it comes to the food, we came here with a work invite so luckily we got a chance to try almost all the signature dishes they have here. My No.1 favourite is the Tomato Soup. It is thick and creamy. Their Shrimp Skewer is another great treat! It comes with grilled bell pepper. TSince we got everything as bite size, I can't tell how big their portion is compared to the price. I guess I will have to come back and try again! 

For their service, I guess most of them were new hired and it is their opening night, they definitely seemed a bit too busy. Our server, very nice and sweet, forgot about our drink twice and brought the wrong drink once. Another guy server doesn't seem to know the ingredients of the dishes very well. His standard reply is ""some asian herbs"". It is understandable that he was still not familiar with the dishes on their opening day, hopefully the staffs would be more knowledgable by now. 

In summary, I truly enjoy the experience here with Poppy Den, and I will surely come back and share it with my friends!",RfSCladjX660OpmPFxmV7A,1,1,4,EnSQCPXcxPWVmzv0WI_cIA
4620643,2013-03-10,3,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"""Spring"" Restaurant Week 2013 meal #2 brought us to Poppy Den in Tivoli Village. Honestly, I have never heard of Angelo Sosa. But the Yelpthren seem to love the place, so I made sure to make it part of our RW lineup. And I'm thrilled to report that it is not overrated.

Poppy Den by Angelo Sosa is all that and a (bowl) of chips (and ice cream). (That will make sense later).

Course 1: Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup; Curried Whipped Cream, Cilantro, Extra Virgin Olive Oil ~OR~ Watermelon Goat Cheese Salad; Candied Wasabi, Extra Virgin Olive Oil

I knew the tomato soup would be good, but in the interest of diversifying, the XX half of the table got the soup while the XY half ordered the salad. Both were delicious. Goat cheese and watermelon apparently make a winning combination. If you had to pick though, go with the tomato soup. Jade W describes it as being very Tom Yum-esque. Delicious.

Course 2: Monkfish With Onion Jam & Dill Ginger, Garlic, Coriander ~OR~ Poppy Burger; Sweet & Sour Pickles, Fried Eggs

Everyone went with the monkfish and it was a fine choice. The fish was perfectly cooked with just a hint of char. Two for two so far Mr Sosa.

Course 3: Chips And Ice Cream ~OR~ Strawberry Sake Shortcake

We diversified again with the XYs getting the shortcake and the XXs getting the chips. Personally, I enjoyed the shortcake more than the chips and ice cream, but either dessert would cap off your meal wonderfully.

All this for $20? Excellent RW lunch. And while this has nothing to do with the quality of the meal, I happened to have the nicest plate during each course. (All four plates were different each time).

Epilogue: We also went upstairs to check out the den. Definitely have to return to hang out up there some time.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,8,6,5,ZSXTf0anfawqhjViHex-HA

Server Yolanda even sent an email to thank us for being such great guests!  That was after I broke a glass with my IPhone!  Bartender William is fun.  Okay i will say something about the food.  The dishes our group loved were Tomato Soup, Roast Chicken and Steak dish.  The portions are small but I thought quality was outstanding.  I believe all food challenges will be worked out because the attention to service means someone cares what customers think. For me I prefer only wild caught salmon (or knowing it is sustainably sourced). I eat salmon several times a week and cannot afford the bad stuff.  I liked the raw tuna dishes (i ordered both on menu) yet felt they were heavy on fat content (which I prefer to save for dessert).  We order 4 desserts (there were 5 of us) - liked them all including ice cream minus potato chips next time. 
Another outstanding element of this restaurant is the use of tableware. Very eclectic old china settings. Made the table fun.

Since the weather was gorgeous yesterday afternoon, my friend Juan and I requested a table outside and it made the experience even more enjoyable. Service was fantastic. Our server and several other members of the team were friendly, attentive, and extremely helpful (our server made a few really great recommendations). From start to finish, we had a delicious and memorable dinner. I am absolutely going back!

They also offer a daily H/H (5-6:30pm) which features FREE champagne or champagne cocktails for ladies. Yes, seriously! I enjoyed two Kir Royales which was champagne and Chambord, YUM! And it was good champagne!

{ Small Plates }
CRAB TOAST WITH MANGO MUSTARD: Shredded crab on crostini served with a spicy mango mustard and diced mango. Good, not memorable for me. The mustard was pretty spicy.
WATERMELON SALAD WITH GOAT CHEESE: Cubes of watermelon with goat cheese and some herbs. It was good and refreshing, but too simple for the price tag.
KOREAN BBQ SHORT RIB: Marinated short rib with ""kimchee"" apple and cucumber slaw. Really, really delicious!! This tastes JUST like my mom's marinade! Definitely gets the Korean stamp of approval!
TUNA DEVILED EGGS: Not your mom's deviled eggs! On one side you have delicious tuna tartare (raw) and the other side you have a diced egg white salad. The flavors, sauce were just SO good. I can eat this again and again.

{ Large Plates }
MISO SALMON WITH SHISHITO PEPPERS: The salmon was cooked perfectly and I was really pleased that it wasn't a glaze, rather a flavorful sauce. The shishito peppers were nicely charred and added something different than your typical spinach or asparagus.
SHRIMP & GRITS: Nicely grilled shrimp flavored with turmeric with deliciously creamy ""grits"" (we were told that it was actually polenta) made with yuzu and coconut milk.

{ Dessert }
STRAWBERRY SAKE SHORT CAKE: Delicious cake soaked in sake (cooked off and not overpowering at all), accompanied with vanilla ice cream, sliced strawberries, and the best part, fresh black pepper whipped cream! Wowza. Fabulous and surprising dessert.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,5,3,4,_4Vr6e2TSM5_K8dz72p3vA
4744441,2013-03-26,3,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Poppy Den is one of the newest, and by far the best, restaurant to have opened in Tivoli Village.  It has managed to become a favorite of mine in the short time they've been open.  

One of the best things about Poppy Den is their service.  From opening week to now, service has been top notch.  Poppy Den has done a great job of selecting their staff, from hostesses to waitstaff to bartenders, they have a strong team.  Parties of 10 or more, remaking entrees, remaking drinks, dealing with the effects of ladies happy hour, finding fruit for us to feed each other with; they do what they can to make customers happy.  I've always received great service, especially from Camille, Kim and Julian.

Many dishes here combine sweet and salty flavors, and they work well.  Having tried quite a few things on their menu, some of the must try dishes are the Quinoa ""Fried Rice"" with Sun Dried Pineapple (best quinoa dish I've had), Amma's Homemade Tomato Soup, the Shrimp and Grits (pureed polenta and yuzu!!), and Miso Salmon with Shishito Peppers (perfectly cooked salmon).  Other good choices are the Roasted Duck Breast with Poppy Honey, the Crispy Pork Belly (breading is a bit too thick, but still good), and the Poppy Burger (the pickled cucumbers make this).  For desserts be sure to try their Miso Toffee Ice Cream with Chips and the Sake Strawberry Cake.

They do offer brunch earlier in the day, which I think is decent but not as impressive as their dinner menu.  The drink menu is good, however I have seen some inconsistencies depending on who makes the cocktails.  There is a Ladies Happy Hour daily from 5:00pm - 6:30pm, which offers free champagne and champagne cocktails.  Now that the weather is getting nice, the outdoor area is now open for dining.  And with those details out of the way, have some pictures.

4834435,2013-06-17,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Poppy Den is a funky little gastropub in Tivoli Village. My friend and I had dinner here on a Thursday night. We were seated quickly in their outdoor patio area. We ordered two different signature cocktails which did not lack in the booze department. They were strong! 

We started with the watermelon salad with goat cheese. It was an interesting combination of flavors- creamy and rich, but crisp and refreshing. We also had the tabbouleh lettuce wraps- no lettuce necessary- the filling was good on its own. We also shared the duck, which was a little over seasoned, but was balanced nicely with Kix cereal. Everything was served on mismatched dishes that look like they were bought at little old ladies' garage sales. 

My favorite is always dessert. We shared the trio of sorbets: mango, pineapple ginger (my favorite), and a mystery flavor that we couldn't figure out (raspberry? strawberry? watermelon?). The mango was creamy and tasted like you we're eating frozen mango purée. The pineapple ginger was refreshing and I would buy it if I could. It was served on a crispy thin sugar cookie with fresh berries. 

Prices were fair. The check was presented in an old children's book, which was a cute detail. Ambience was the best part. The patio seemed larger than the dining room, and even though it was a little warm, the breeze made it feel like summer. 

The only negative was our server. She seemed to talk down to us and invited herself into our conversations. It was very off putting. 

I will return to try more of their interesting dishes (and have lots more sorbet!). Make sure you dress up a little- Tivoli Village is not very t-shirt, shorts, and flip flop friendly.",rpsfCdMo3aUiLT6C6onr8g,0,0,4,uP0qN_faSIRfU_eVVzEsCQ
4856624,2014-02-16,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"My fiancé and I went on Valentine's Day for the fixed menu. We were disappointed. We sat upstairs and although the wait staff were very friendly, the kitchen let them down. Three of our three course dinner came out-of-sink where one of us got our dish up to 5 minutes ahead of the other. The Braised Pork with buns was stunning! But we had to wait for several minutes for the buns to arrive...while our dish cooled. For dinner, my curry dish arrived,but no spoons were on he table with which to eat. For dessert, our dish came in a cute little jar, but our spoon wouldn't fit into it...so we waited. No worries though, as we were still waiting on my dessert to arrive. The fortune cookie presented beautifully, but was so overbearingly sweet.

Bottom line, it was a busy night for them, there are lots of good reviews on Yelp, but on this night, it was a fail. We spoke to the manager and he comp'd a portion of the meal and we thanked him. The ambiance is good and I would probably return for cocktails, but not for food.",9eRRQL3JwekCLFPY25tO2A,0,0,3,DHC1oibAWgCk8RIDqtWVUg

The tomato soup with a little curry foam and olive oil was crazy good.  Possibly the best tomato soup I have ever had.  The miso salmon with shishioto peppers was just gorgeous!  Sitting at the bar made the whole experience so enjoyable with bar tender Brian being so happy to tell me about the dishes I was eating.  He explain the shishioto peppers are usually mild, but 1 in 27 can be very hot, so it made the dish even more adventurous to eat - none of mine we hot, but I did enjoy the dark teriyaki like glaze it was covered in.  Excited to try more I finished up with  chocolate soufflé with vanilla ice cream and caramel popcorn.  New flavor treat - vanilla bean ice cream and caramel popcorn are a perfect flavor pairing - who knew?

We wanted to see what the Top Chef finalist was doing all the way out here in Vegas, up in Tivoli Village.  The menu's concept is pretty cool.  A lot of healthier twists on some old fav's like the deviled eggs! They are a must! Its sort of deconstructed, where its only egg whites and he adds ahi tuna- so bomb! The chicken wings are enormous and delicious! A Little spicy, sweet and they are crispy which I love.  I had the China Cat Sunflower to drink which I loved.  So fresh and different with the green tea infusion, it was just the right amount of tequila flavor, balanced with the sweet floral St. Germain.  My friend had the Honey and Hazelnut for dessert! Which was a really tasty cocktail!  Its made with Jack Honey which you would never know by just drinking it.  The only downside was it's supposed to have a nutella rim and this one did not.  We sat at the bar to eat, we meet more interesting people that way :) and the bar staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu! Wish I could remember the girls name, (she told us we could call her Blondie) but all of the suggestions she made, we ordered and were very pleased.

5051539,2013-04-02,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"After a decent first visit for Restaurant Week, the BF and I decided to come back for dinner. 

We started off with their much talked about quinoa ""fried rice"" with dehydrated pineapple and tofu. It was pretty good - a bit sweet, a bit of spice in the back. You gotta like quinoa though which I happen to love. 

The BF got the striped bass with edamame. Nice fresh fish and was perfectly cooked. The puree was minty, and the sauce was a bit tangy, sweet and herbaceous with some dill swimming in it. It's a small-ish portion, but was fair still with the price and was still filling. 

I got the poppy burger which I ordered medium rare, because most places wont and would get it pink/medium. It actually came medium rare, which is surprising. It was a solid, juicy burger and had nice flavor. It was very messy though, I took a bite and the egg burst so I kept it knife and fork. The fries were nice and crisp, covered in togarashi seasoning and the kimcheese sauce was nice. It wasn't very kimchee tasting , but seasoned nacho cheese like. I love nacho cheese so that was a plus. It was a really filling and good burger and side for the $14 pricepoint.

The service has been consistently friendly and nice here. Our server was also the bartender and he was attentive despite having the bar to run back and forth to and was super personable. 

This is definitely on the better restaurants to eat in the area. I can see the flavor profiles not for everyone, but for those who are into it, it's bold and exciting. I'm definitely a fan of what I've eaten so far and will be back.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,10,5,TYyIN9_ZoHOpIzdehNWe0A

Dishes are artfully presented.  Portions are very small for the price.  Flavors run from boring to interesting to ""delicious but"" to bizarre.  Examples:

Watermelon salad with goat cheese, a classic, is very refreshing but could benefit from a drizzle of aged balsamic to boost sweetness and complexity.  The hint of wasabi does nothing.  The watermelon lacked the ""in season"" fruity goodness.  Boring.

Quinoa fried rice with sun dried pineapple and tofu is intriguing.  Good first bite but unless you are a quinoa lover, the texture of the and nutty flavor of the grain quickly becomes one dimensional.  The pineapple lacks the acidic punch to brighten the dish.  Interesting.

The roasted duck breast is delicious.  Perfectly cooked, mid rare.  Mineral duck flavors enhanced by the honey.  A great side of grilled baby bok choy to add bitterness and crunch.  Just be sure to scrape off the ridiculous addition of children's breakfast cereal.   Blood soaked Kix.  Really?  Delicious but.

Miso toffee ice cream.  Wait for it.... Disgusting.  The first bite is good,  but with each successive bite, the miso flavor builds to the point your brain tells you not to swallow.  Fermented ice cream.  Bizarre.

Very small selection of micro brews.  Nice selection of sake.  High off Strip prices.

Bottom line, the food is not for everyone.  There are many better options for more globally accepted creativity.  You're better off looking to the Strip for excellence.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,26,21,2,eXHp5bkqpE8raJYTtCX96Q

Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful with drink and food recommendations (I forget his name but he is from New York)!

I'm so glad Petra got the boot! That place sucked and kind of ruined my 19th birthday. Or was it my 20th? Oh well. Either way, I'm beyond elated that Hot Chef... I mean TOP CHEF ;) Angelo Sosa opened his restaurant here! With Honey Salt & Poppy Den in Summerhood, I kind of still wish I lived there. Actually, Its probably better that I don't. If I was still 5 minutes away from this joint I'd probably be here more often then I should.

SUNDAY BRUNCH: The only Korean fusion I find acceptable is at Poppy Den! Sosa has mastered Kim-Cheese, Kim-Hollandaise, Kim-Relish... With my name in all that,  its like it was meant for me to eat. *bad joke end* All *bad* jokes aside, it really is delicious. I probably looked a little ridiculous dunking everything I could into that Kim-Cheese but it was so delicious and very easy for my non-kimchi-eating friends to enjoy. I stole some bites from my friends' plates but my Eggs Benedict had to be my favorite. Hello polenta cake deliciousness. Other honorable mentions are the Pea Soup, chicken wings, and Yuzu Caesar Salad.

LVRW 2013: $30.13 three-course dinner? What a deal! After trying PD's pea soup & tomato soup, I have officially dubbed them the soup masters. The crab toast we got was tasty but what makes the dish is that mango mustard. If I order than again, I'm definitely asking for extra! The Roasted Duck Breast is such a cute dish in concept. Play on the sweet honey and add texture by throwing in Kix cereal. But to be frank, it was way too sweet for my taste and not enjoyable. They do however do a killer job on their Miso Salmon. One of the better salmon dishes I've had in Vegas (over many Strip places). Everyone has that friend that always orders salmon when they go out right? This is the place to take them for a delicious and perfectly-cooked salmon that won't bust the waist line!

DESSERT: Everyone goes nuts over the chips & ice cream.The ice cream is tasty and the chips have a homemade kettle chip quality.  Its good but not all that. Before I tried their Strawberry Shortcake, I remember Vanessa N. raving that she doesn't like most strawberry shortcakes but she loves the one at Poppy Den.The cake is soaked in sake and the whipped cream is infused with peppercorn.  I can confirm that it is the business.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,9,8,4,3nzc7MUZ3YbbruFvGO5JfQ

-Grain salad with asian pesto: this dish was a bit too oily for my taste. I was also expecting some kind of greens or vegetables to go with it, but instead I received a bowl of seasoned grains. This wasn't exactly the salad I was hoping for.
-Meat balls : these were so salty it made the dish not very pleasant, at least in my opinion since I eat very little salt.
-Miso salmon with peppers - my dinner companion ordered this dish and I tried the salmon. Best entre among all the items that we ordered that night. Pefectly cooked and seasoned. The salmon just melts in your mouth. Delish!

5319902,2013-05-17,1,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"My family and I went here for dinner.  Great ambience, pretty good service and the food? Well...

We got the Pupu Platter: Sweet Pea Soup, Tuna, Watermelon Salad, Meatballs and Fish Fritters.  The soup had a strong hint of ginger to it.  The tuna was nice and fresh. The salad was very refreshing and it had goat cheese on top.  The meatballs were tender.  The fritters were not fishy.  It was a perfect sampler for a group of 4.

We ordered a Poppy Burger with extra Poppy Fries, Kimchi Fried Rice, Crispy Pork Belly, Charred Bok Choy and Roasted Duck Breast.  My favorites were the burger, fries, fried rice and pork belly.   The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fries were crisp and came with a yummy cheese sauce.  The fried rice was not kimchi overload.  Pork belly was crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  We also got the Quinoa Fried Rice.  Honestly, it was too sweet for me.  It was my least favorite item that we got.  The duck was also on the sweet side.

For dessert, we got Chips and Ice Cream.  The chips were homemade but they weren't crisp.  There were 2 ice cream flavors: caramel/toffee and lemon poppy.  Both were good.  It was a great dessert for the texture and sweet and savory elements.  We also got the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Toffee.  The cake was nice and hot.  It was moist and delicious and was paired nicely with the vanilla toffee ice cream and popcorn on the side.

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.  I just won't order the quinoa and the duck together next time.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,3,2,4,xz5wPKpukQuz7oc4zxM7xQ

Pros:
The food was overall spectacular. The chicken wings are amazing. The Asian influences in all of the dishes is prevalent and robust. It is hard to pinpoint all of the exact components in every dish, because they blend so well together. We ordered close to ten dishes and almost all of them were a hit. Besides the wings, I had a affinity for the tomato and the chilled split pea soup. Both are complex and full bodied. 

Cons:
Our table was flooded with food all at once. So the table was full. It could have been coursed out or slowed down. We also got there at the very end of happy hour. We were able to put in some orders, but found out that they scale down the order. The caprese salad was three slices of tomatoes and two butt ends of mozzarella. It was disappointing.

Poppy. So we said yes to Brunch on Sunday with a group of friends.
The brunch menu is different than their regular menu so their are some items missing from their regular menu. But everything we had was pretty good.

I started my morning with a Honey and Hazelnut martini, it reminded me of egg nog but sweeter, I was quite pleased with my drink.
Fresh croissants to begin our brunch were good but appeared over cooked/burnt, the honey, jam and butter accompanying  them helped moisten them up. 
I was able to get another drink while we waited for food so I tried a Poppy Sling which was a good sweet drink also that I'd get again.
My husband and I decided to share the Crab Toast with Mango, General  Wings, and  Pork Dumplings. So the Crab toast was different with the sweet, acidic mango...I liked it but not awesome. The Generals Wings we both really liked...the sauce was sweet and sticky but could've been spicier. The wings were huge and perfectly fried crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My husband liked the pork dumplings more than I did, I felt like they were over cooked. The filling was okay but nothing special. I was able to sample another diners fries with Kim-cheese dipping sauce, I wish we would've ordered some, they were tasty.
We all shared and sampled a trio of  their Ice  cream with Potato Chips...they sealed their 4 stars in there! Miso Toffee was my favorite, the Strawberry was good but just like strawberry ice cream anywhere, and The Lemon Poppy seed ice cream came in second for me.

All of the staff was very friendly and attentive from start to finish. The decor was cool, it set a good vibe but not sure if it goes with the food. I may go back, I may not. It's not a place that's calling me back.",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,3,3,4,d_SW_AM2dEj--STD3VHLmQ
5390882,2013-07-26,8,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"This is a tough one to write.  As a heterosexual male, man crushes are hard to come by for me.   As an avid viewer of Top Chef and all Top Chef inspired shows (yes, even Just Desserts and even Life After Top Chef so help me God), no contestant ever hit that special combination of ""oh he seems like a cool guy"" and ""I mean yeah, if I was gay or a woman, I'd totally!"" the way Angelo did.   Needless to say, the possibility of running into this rare man crush species altogether combined with some of the outstanding reviews this place has received from Yelpers I trust wholeheartedly and I was excited.    Then I ate there.

I met a friend at the bar and she had already started with an appetizer of meatballs (which conveniently were already devoured and all evidence removed).   She did tell me they were delicious, which raised my anticipation even further.   Ever since trying Comme Ca's excellent happy hour and their specialty drinks menu, my fear of specialty cocktails has subsided a bit and I figured who else to trust with my specialty cocktail needs than Angelo!  Started with the Sake Sangria.   It was good.  Really good.   Though I must say the best Sake Sangria I've had yet is still Bachi Burger, so in that sense it was a slight disappointment, but still worth ordering.   While waiting for some food I also ended up trying The Raven and the Poppy Sling.  I found them okay, but they didn't really hit the mark for me completely on either taste nor strength of alcohol.  Sort of regretted not just sticking with a whiskey and coke to be honest.   Back to square one on the specialty drink thing I guess.

Still having high hopes for the food, we received the following:  Crispy Pork Dumplings, Chicken Wings, Quinoa Fried Rice with Pineapple, a side of fries and a side of Shishito peppers.   Sadly nothing really excited me.  The Pork Dumplings were fine, but didn't really stand out to me any more than ones I could get at TGI Fridays.  The wings were similar for me, in that they tasted okay, but they seriously just tasted like the Pizza Hut/Wingstreet Asian BBQ wings.   I'm going to go out on a limb and say that was not the desired result.  The quinoa fried rice is raved about on here and was probably the item I was most looking forward to, and yet I found it overly sweet and barely finished half of the plate.  All I can remember of the flavor was that yup, I tasted pineapple all right.  Shishito peppers offered nothing new, and the fries were par for the course as well.   I will say I did enjoy the kim chee dipping sauce quite a bit, especially the more I had of it.

On the plus side, the service for the most part was exceptional.  The two bartenders worked their asses off making sure all the ladies were getting their free glasses of champagne during happy hour, and angelo himself stopped by to ask how everything was and true to character I lied and said everything was great.   It was already over by that point.

Lets start with the decor. It's like a freshly graduated design student thought ""hmmm, you know what would go nicely with these exposed beams? really out of place tufted furniture."" Sure I get it, you are being hip and mixing trends, fine.  If it had stopped there it might have been ok.  But the strange Asian infusion they try to impart by using what would appear to be a terrifying array of crappy yard sale dishes from grandmas around the Vegas area? Or the completely out of place rock music that was far too loud? No. No. Just no. Way too many things going on at once.

The food: while this could have been the saving grace of the place it was just an utter disappointment. Everything tasted like it could have been straight out of a freezer bag with a seasoning of soy sauce. Note: meatballs are hard to get wrong, but these were some of the worst I have encountered. Texturally, everything was just a bland mush.  There was no differentiation between any favors. It was unpleasant. 

The drinks were fine, the naked lunch overly sweet. 

Also, putting 2 people in a booth meant for 6? That is weird. I don't want to talk sideways at my date, I want to see their face.  I felt more like we should be judging something in front of us instead of eating dinner.

But it was all worth it and I will be doing it again soon.

Let's start with the awesome appetizers we had.  Everyone mentions the watermelon salad and it really is all that.  The goat cheese, oil and other seasonings that come with each piece of juicy watermelon is absolutely heavenly.  The tuna deviled eggs were good but we both felt needed some kind of cracker to put it on.  My friend was starving by the time we got there and added the kimchi fried rice to our order as our terrific server was walking away.  I enjoyed that was well.  Talk about a spectrum of flavors just for the apps!!

For entrees, I got the crispy pork belly which was the biggest portion of pork belly I'd ever had.  The fatty juiciness of the meat itself really complemented the crispy and crusty exterior.  But what really blew us away was my friend's duck dish.  Perfectly sliced pieces of duck topped with Kix cereal.  Why Kix?  Why not!  One of the best duck entrees I've ever had.  I already know I am getting that on a future visit. 

They had a great cocktail menu.  Our server was explaining how she was in experimenting with a cocktail containing siracha that she wasn't ready to unleash yet .  Maybe I'll try to make it a happy hour request.

The tomato soup was outstanding but the burger and my meatballs were mediocre at best.  The kitchen and service needs a lot of work.

5586170,2013-02-16,2,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"I've taken a loooong break from writing any reviews, but this place is noteworthy enough to beckon a review. 

I came here with some friends for Saturday brunch and we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff. The atmosphere reminded me of many my great brunches in NYC. I like that the bar opened up to a little patio and let in the fresh air and sunlight. 

As for the food, everything was well prepared and tasty. 

For starters we had the watermelon salad with goat cheese and the crab toast with mango mustard. The goat cheese was great and it came topped with candied wasabi. It sounds weird, but the flavors really worked well together, and the crunchiness of the candied wasabi offerred a good contrast in texture. The crab toast was good too, my friends really liked the mango mustard, the only critique is that it there was a bit too much mayo, otherwise the amount of crab was decent. 

For my main dish I ordered the egg benedict. Now, my problem with brunch is I'm ALWAYS tempted to try the eggs benedict regardless of where I go. I dunno, its just a comfort food for me I guess. This place though did a great job with their take on a regular brunch staple with perfectly poached eggs, thick cut canadian bacon, and a spicy hollandaise sauce. What was exceptionally unique was that instead of an english muffin, they put everything on top of a polenta cake. Other things we ordered included the kimchi fried rice, the chicken sausage, and mochi pancakes, and each dish was well liked. The mochi pancakes were delicious with fresh berries and creme. I thought it was going to be just a regular pancake with some mochi bits thrown in, but it was like the entire pancake had the texture and flavor of mochi, without it being too sweet or chewy. Well done. 

At first we didn't want any dessert, but the green tea-mint creme brulee caught our eyes. I'm glad we tried it, the flavor was creamy and rich and what made it all so different was the there was a hint of thai chilli in the sugar glaze and in this little cracker that comes with it. So you start with the sweetness of the green tea and mint and it leaves your mouth with the slightest kick from the chilli. Great dessert, presentation was a little bit plain however for such an interesting dish.

5632998,2013-09-16,0,TA1dpJpodkG2NR7JJLIicQ,"Summary: A great arrangement of mostly Asian influenced flavors that provides new takes on relatively familiar dishes. But what I also like about this place is allowing the texture of the food to stand out as much as the flavor. Here's what I mean:

For example, I don't usually order edamame at restaurants because they all taste the same, but here, the edamame was mixed with turmeric oil, ginger and togarashi (Japanese pepper spice) making it the BEST EDAMAME I've ever had. 

The heirloom tomato salad with steak was PERFECT. I loved the use of thai basil. The balsamic vinegar was sweet without being overly acidic. The steak was so tender, we could cut it with the butter knife. 

The charred bok choy was simple, crisp and refreshing.

The quinoa fried rice with sun-dried pineapple and baby(?) cilantro brought a classic fried rice concept with a new texture by using quinoa. 

I liked the tomato soup, the flavor came in three phases; first you taste sweetness, followed by the tomato acidity then a spicy kick after it passes the back of your tongue. I think there's chipotle in there providing the spicy aftertaste. But it was a little too sweet for me. 

We came here for Saturday lunch, the bartender was super friendly, enthusiastic and outgoing. He made great recommendations and even offered to see if the kitchen could make dinner items that aren't on the lunch menu. 

I eat a lot of Asian/Oriental style meals (Japanese, Thai, Korean) weekly and Poppy Den is really something special. It does stand out for the reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph.

Given the rough reviews of late, we decided to give it a try anyway as my family rooted for Angelo in Top Chef. To keep it brief, we found out he wasn't cooking and was in NYC. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt given its only been 19 days since opening...the staff was running around, giving food to tables that didn't order the food...our food was either waaaay too salty or under seasoned...it was comical almost. Some good points...our server was nice and we were comped 1/3 of our meal, and apologized to by the maître d' numerous times. BUT the bad really shadowed--no--eclipsed it. 

When you go, you'll be greeted by a large sign with ""By Chef Angelo Sosa"" written boldly. I don't know the reason why he would have his name in that scale and not be there AT THE VERY LEAST for the VERY sensitive opening month that the restaurant needs his guidance the most. It's quite perplexing. 

What we had: 
1. Pot stickers: good texture, but swimming in sauce and bit sweet
2. Burger: under seasoned, burnt bun and the fries were so salty.
3. Kim chi fried rice: I get it that it's nice to have some char but man, dry and seemingly undercooked rice was not the crunch it's suppose to have.
4. Chicken wings: my kid had this and it was...wow...the breading was wow...not in a good way huge
5. Tomato soup: it was good...thank goodness
6. Salad: sorry cant remember which one...but if you can believe this...it was SO salty. SALAD. SALTY. I'm so confused. 
7. Dessert: chips and ice cream was decent and strawberry shortcake was ok. These were comped items.
8. Tap water: I swear I'm not being a jerk by including this...there is something not right with the water...go ahead try it. It seriously has a bad taste. 

I digress. Chef Sosa, I know you're reading this. You need to fly back, like right now. Your name is on the sign.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,7,1,2,VzTTKjshaEPAJKNvSVDSww

I did my research on-line and saw the ""Happy Hour"" menu posted, and I asked about that when I was greeted at the bar. I was told they don't have a happy hour menu but instead was given the regular menu. Another bartender asked to take my order and gave me a glass of champagne, and that's when I found out there was an ""In Between"" menu with a few food items at lowered prices from 3 to 5:30.  Apparently, the menu I was given didn't even start until 5:30, and I was there around 4:45.  ??????
Great, I spent 10 minutes deciding on something and it wasn't even on the ""In Between"" menu. So, I ordered the $11 Poppy burger from this new menu, which comes with Poppy fries with a delicious sauce. I ordered the burger medium rare and it was much closer to rare, but it was a good burger overall, I love the fried egg and pickles. 
My bill was incorrect, as I was charged the regular menu price instead of the ""In Between"" menu price. The manager did speak to me to apologize for the error and correct the mistake, and she was very considerate and invited me to come back.

The fortune cookie dessert was amusing and it was good, not too sweet, but not amazing. I guess being asian, i'm kind of hard to impress when it comes to my food. My overall opinion of this place is that it has not quite gotten the right balance of ""asian"" with american, the taste could definitely be better! The restaurant is beautiful though and the presentations really nice... just need to work on the flavor a bit more so that it can truly capture the real essence of asian.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,4,2,2,CaTspXSlXhXp8VTpZOzPww
