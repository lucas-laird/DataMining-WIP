There is something about rolled ice cream, you either love it or you don't. Some people say it is 'rolling' trend and others just 'roll' on in. I know, sorry I just had to say it! 

Personally, I like rolled ice cream and have tried it at two other Vegas locations. The texture is not like the regular scooped ice cream because the way it is created. It is a little firmer than hand scooped ice cream because it is scraped into little rolls once it freezes. 

I wanted something simple but I also wanted one of their signature rolls, so I chose the Chocolicious, which has a chocolate base-banana mix, bananas and whipped cream. It was pretty solid for something simpler than their other signature rolls. The ice cream texture was firm and the flavor was spot on. I really won't go into the bananas and whipped cream because that would be silly!

Now that I have tried, something simple I would love to come in and try their other signature rolls such as the DeathB4Decaf and Pina Colada! See you soon Ice Land!",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,5,7,4,-5UbDv3UP7BweWWNDuYrRw

1941791,2017-08-23,0,lWnG8JOua6jJ_STTLLstlg,"Rolled ice cream is now my favorite. It has a creamy yet crystallized texture and served SUPER cold!  Interestingly, it's made to order. 

Steps to make rolled ice are:
1. Put ingredients on ""cold plate"" (-35deg F)
2. Pulverize ingredients with paddles
3. Spread ingredients thin to freeze 
4. Roll ice cream into tubes with paddles 

For me the only ingredients that aren't good in rolled ice are nuts because they have an odd texture once being pulverized. 

Otherwise they're all great!

We shared the Wu-Tang rolled ice cream. It was a vanilla based ice cream with Oreo cookies and is sooo good!  I liked it a lot. 

I like this location because there's no line!  I've waited for about 25 min at competitors. Also it's convenient to get in and out if you're in the Boca park area. 

What I disliked is that they seem to lack focus in their product. They brand themselves as a rolled ice cream restaurant (which they're great at) but have a giant freezer full of gelato in front of the register.

Came in during their soft opening and was torn between the Smores and coffee-flavored specialty options. Helpful staff suggested the DeathB4Decaf option (made with a coffee base) and added the toasted mashmallow from the other choice, which just hit the spot! 

The order was out pretty quick and I liked that the rolls held their shape very well and didn't melt. The flavor of the ice cream itself was more pronounced than I've had elsewhere, and the coffee flavor was really distinct. Looking forward to coming back to try their Thai tea version soon!

They still have gelato available for those who are unwilling to wait if there's a line. They have 3 of the ice tables so as long as they have trained staff working, they should be able to keep getting orders out fast. Props for having vegan options (gelato only right now) and coffee available too.

EDIT: Returned for their BOGO grand opening weekend special and tried the Gold Digger (Thai tea with lychee) and WuTang's Cookies & Cream (self explanatory).

I ended up picking the gold digger because I really like Thai tea. The wait didn't take long at all. I got to see the entire process of them making my ice cream.
Let me just say their topping game is weak! When you get signature ice creams from LA they have good amount of topping, but the place here is so stingy.

Service was alright. Nothing mind-blowing. I was however impressed because our cashier did a cute drawing on each cup. 

$5.99 and you can either customize your own or choose from pre-selected options. I'm the most indecisive person on this planet so I went with Gold Digger, which is Thai tea base with lychee. 

I was hesitant about Ice Land due to other reviewers' comments about crystallized, not so creamy texture. I was pleasantly surprised because my ice cream was creamy. I've tried several rolled ice cream shops in town and this was the creamiest. 

Not to mention, Thai tea base tasted like milk tea blended but with creamy texture almost like gelato (and I love me some milk tea). Also liked the lychee + Thai tea concoction. 

Also tried Perfect Matcha but substituted red bean for Oreo. I believe matcha base itself is not sweetened because Oreo was the only sweetness factor in this.

4108189,2017-09-23,4,lWnG8JOua6jJ_STTLLstlg,"Well, at least this makes it two local places better than ""Rolled Ice Cream.""

Ice Land Vegas is the third ever of this subgenre of ice cream which I've tried, but it's the second chronologically of three local businesses to offer the lower-case rolled ice cream treat, a modern Thai street food dessert with entertainment value in the preparation. The upper case place was the ""pioneer"" for the Vegas scene, but its lower-case product lacked in both flavor and texture.

The location is in an otherwise nondescript gigantic plaza, at the northeast corner of Rampart and Charleston. I found it without much trouble due to the bright sign at night. After walking inside and noticing that the seating area was totally empty - an oddity for late nights at dessert shops, in my experience - I browsed the rolled ice cream menu on the blackboards located on the exterior wall.

There is only one portion size, a $5.99 cup. Unlimited toppings are available for a +$1 upgrade if you're into that sort of thing. Ultimately, I settled on a limited, premade combo off the ""signature"" menu, assuming that these should be reasonably good offerings and realizing that I generally take too long to decide, especially considering the variety of choices of base, mix-in, topping, and sauce. My choice was the Gold Digger, a Thai tea base with lychee mix-in, lychee topping, and condensed milk.

After I placed my order, an employee said that they'll make it for me to watch. He prepared the cream and grabbed the mix-in, and poured those onto one of the three super-cold surfaces which instantly started to freeze the foreign invaders. The employee quickly chopped up the mix-in, then started to mix everything and then flatten it out again to the final rectangular setup for rolling. Five scrapes later, and five spiral cylinders of dessert were ready for the toppings and sauce sauce in a rear station.

In terms of texture and thickness, the lower-case here did bear an uncanny, unsettling resemblance to the not-so-creamy, overly spoon-resistant product of the upper case competitor. It only really got soft enough just before it started to melt. However, I have to give props for the variety of flavors and add-ons, especially the real lychee fruit found doubly in my dessert. It will be familiar to anyone who has eaten either the fresh or the canned versions of it. That said, the Thai tea flavor does seem somewhat muted, which I'm guessing is a side-effect of the cream which they use in all of their bases. Still, it's more interesting than something mundane like vanilla or chocolate.

Ice Land does offer gelato and coffee too, which are seemingly holdovers from the old inhabitant of this space (named Vivido Gelato), but it seems unlikely that those particular offerings would be worth the visit. I do hope to return occasionally, but it's easier for me, a Henderson resident, to drive to another lower-case spot which I prefer overall. I very rarely find myself in this particular neighborhood for other reasons (read: restaurants), and that seems unlikely to change.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,4,3,nCzzrZJQ-FOlgF_nosNvNw

Too bad I left with a bad taste in my mouth and not because of the ice cream but because of her poor attitude. The owner should reevaluate his hiring practices and start hiring friendlier people. The other two guys working there this evening were very pleasant.  This place serves ice cream which usually draws in kids which doesn't really pair well with rude employees. This was our first time there and when I asked her for some details of how it all worked all she kept saying is the directions are behind you on the wall. Not going back unless my negative experience can be rectified somehow. But, overall her negative attitude ruined the whole experience for me.",mlS97MYUHdYWI-SSSeWcQw,1,0,2,3f7Np0CEGUM1kjW4x5FNYQ

My boyfriend said that he actually preferred this place over the other joint in town. The service was great - we were greeted immediately when we walked in and the guy asked if we have ever been there before. It was our first time so he gave us some suggestions on what to order. I ordered the s'mores and boy was it yummy. I will gladly be returning if I'm in the mood for ice cream.,qYFENIidj3syfyGnqqVitA,3,1,5,JKlJw0usRQy8frWqYFb-Vg

It is a small place but has tables and they offer games to play and hang out.
My niece loves the gold digger rolled ice cream which is Thai tea based with lychee. The reason I have to give 4 stars rather than 5 is because I wish they had more options to choose from or at least have more fresh fruit choices for toppings.",ojMIkHP9M07O9SWOSggsRQ,0,0,4,Idxr2-2my1pIeEtQs5VDxA

5227574,2017-09-24,6,lWnG8JOua6jJ_STTLLstlg,"I admit it. I love to try anything new, cute, or. kitschy. Rolled ice cream meets all the criteria in a new to LV way.

I have tried the other option in town and even knowing the texture would again be an issue here I still figured I'd try it. Offering one size for $5.99 and an unlimited topping option for $1 more I went with one of the creations on their menu board. While I found the base here to be more flavorful freezing the ingredients on the cold plate in order to make the signature rolls still results in an ice cream with an unpleasant crystallized texture. To me the texture reminds me of ice cream that has been in the freezer too long. I also found them to be stingy with the toppings here. They also offer gelato which due to its appearance I chose not to try. Oddly shiny its texture did not look right and it was missing the amazing aesthetic of a traditionally displayed gelato.

Service was friendly but I will continue to enjoy a more traditional ice cream or gelato.",-TrZfd9aC4k_7A2i0icMVg,12,7,3,zo-VyI7XVmxhI3JwmK6zqA

My brother's pistachio gelato was okay except for the pistachio shell that he accidentally bit down upon. My niece had the marshmallow-something. She was enjoying her gelato until she discovered an approximately 2"" piece of hard, jagged plastic in her gelato. My brother and I brought the plastic into the shop and the man working the counter, apologized and blamed the distributor that they use. My standards are not unreasonable, but this trip to Ice Land was hazardous. My brother is lucky that he didn't break a tooth or choke on the pistachio shell and my niece is lucky that she didn't bite into the sharp plastic.",vMpozky4O6Z4uszXIxstdw,6,0,1,qbN6zW3vbPIN0FRj-Hox5Q

5912039,2017-09-05,15,lWnG8JOua6jJ_STTLLstlg,"I am so glad I stumbled upon this place on yelp! Once again, my fellow yelpers have chosen well.

As you probably have already seen, this is a ""rolled"" type of ice cream. And the only place to compare it to is rolled (ice pan is now extinct). And it is soooo much better (sorry rolled). They play good music, provide wifi, have tables and chairs, and it's not as crowded. The service is friendly and they have three ice stations. You order and pay first and then they make your creations. They also have other stuff like coffee, hot chocolate, and gelato.

Either their cream consistency is different or their ice pans are cold-ER because the texture AND flavor is out of this world! 

I got the death b4 decaf without the caramel drizzle and enjoyed it so much: coffee base with graham crackers and kit Kat bars. My absolute favorite type of ice cream and chocolate bar in general! So perfect for me. Not too sweet and doesn't melt so fast (kinda like how rolled does).

I would definitely come back and bring babe here, he would definitely like this place! Don't forget to grab a stamp card cause I know you'll be back. 

Let the good times roll!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,38,26,5,ZsStOGLbeUXmIcT2g5i8mw
