I ordered the quiche, and man, am I sorry I did.  It bore little resemblance to actual French quiche, or even the frozen quiche you can get from Trader Joe's.  It was grainy, even floury, and generally flavorless.  I was worried about it being underdone, but it was just simply bad.

831375,2015-08-02,0,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The decor is great, so that's a decent start. I love the idea of a locally-owned non-chain restaurant (decent ones are hard to come by in Vegas), but I have some reservations about going back. 

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the selections are great in theory. We had a good experience there for breakfast, and I would encourage locals to check out their selection for ""first meal."" They have fresh and tasty options in the morning. 

However, during our visit for lunch, my husband and I both noticed that everything had the same flavor, which reminded us of Indian food. It seemed misplaced. For lunch, I had the minestrone and the garden burger. The minestrone lacked that distinct tangy, Italian flavor, and had a strong flavor that tasted like Indian food (as mentioned above). My husband tasted it and thought the same thing. The veggie patty had the same flavor as the soup. I prefer veggie patties to have a distinct garden-fresh flavor, so though the ingredients were fresh, the flavors were flat and disconnected. I have had probably a dozen, homemade veggie burgers in various restaurants around the country, and this was my least favorite. I couldn't finish it. 

I hope they rethink the flavors on some of their offerings so the food is more bright and distinct. (I've eaten lunch and dinner here, and it all just tasted the same.) Also, the buns are way too dense and way too big. My husband had a burger, and disliked the bun as well. I would really like to see this place succeed, and I hope they consider refining their menu to get a foothold in the neighborhood. I will probably try breakfast there again, but not lunch or dinner unless they make some adjustments.",mbe6j2nT5lOfFRDikWpTRw,0,0,3,73u1W2emlPLoJJQQ_5HuzA

1016137,2014-08-16,2,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"Two nights ago feeling lazy about cooking, I was trying to decide where to dine that evening. I had thought about the new place, Jacques, but decided on the tried & true Woolghans in the Rampart casino.   Mistake!   While the food is serviceable, the service has gone downhill ! Long story short: I was suffering from diner's remorse for having overpaid for fish & chips and bad service.   Tonight, I dined @ Jacques . I ordered the seafood pasta.  The serving was generous, the pasta & seafood perfectly cooked, the tomato sauce was flavorful and light without overwhelming the pasta.  The price point with beverage and tip ran shy of $13....I felt redeemed from my bad dining choice of the previous night. While this is not a full service restaurant, the staff were pleasant and earnest in making a good impression-although I believe one staff person's question of whether I was having fun, I think,  meant to ask how I was enjoying my meal.   The decor is light and modern-a comfortable space.  It is exactly where you would want to go for a meal at the end of a busy work day or a simple evening out.

Unfortunately my diet is very limited due to some recent health problems, so I had to order a grilled chicken sandwich on a gluten free bun. I had to modify some of the sandwich (no onions and some other things). They put aioli on the sandwich and didn't put the Swiss cheese, so I wasn't too happy or thrilled (I can't have aioli- a huge problem with my digestion and it wasn't supposed to be on it). I was concerned because they put things I didn't ask for on it and didn't include all of the items I did ask for. For people with allergies like myself, that can be a huge problem. I scraped off all of it that I could. All in all, I would give my meal a 3/5. 

My friend ordered the deli burger and said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. He's actually still raving about it days later, so that was a 5/5 and he highly recommends it. 

I appreciate how they do have gluten free and vegan options! Also extremely clean restrooms and comfortable outdoor seating. The inside was adorable, and the prices are very affordable! You can get lunch for under $10.

Stopped in for lunch with my guy- location is rustic chic with chalkboard menu and walk-up service, drinks in blue Ball brand canning jars, cute bar area and cozy seating. Lighting, fixtures, and other small details are quality- a lot of thought was put into the décor.

Seasoned brisket sandwich has onions and peppers, smoke gouda, and is a hefty size for the $9 price tag- pleasantly surprised. Awkward presentation in a bowl but I'll overlook that. Sides available include a salad or fries, opted for the latter which needed more crispiness.

EDIT: Dropping a star from my rating. Came back for a second meal that was far less satisfactory. The décor remains cute but the flavor seems to have been forgotten in the kitchen.

I ordered avocado on my Simple Burger and it was a healthy portion, unfortunately it was rock hard. I called over the waiter and told him about it. He just walked away. The Deli burger was served as a Simple Burger.

I started waiting at the front with the cashier telling me to wait so she can finish what she was doing before she took my order. Once she was done being way too busy to help us, she finally looked up and took our order. I thought how long she took to help us was a little rude, especially because there wasn't anyone in front of us who had just ordered. 

We sat ourselves and our food was delivered promptly. The burger I had was supposed to be cooked medium but was cooked well done- not sure why they even asked.

At the end of our meal the girl from the front came over to see if I needed a box. I said yes and she said she would be right back. 20 min later- no box. I then went up front and asked her what happened to the box- She looked at me confused and then remembered she never brought one.  

If this place was busy I would understand the bad customer service- but it was so dead!

Because even though items on the menu are labeled GF, it does not mean they will come to you GF, as I found out today.  Two items I ordered were prepared with ingredients containing gluten, even though the menu labeled them GF and failed to list any ingredients containing gluten.  Unfortunately I ate a bit of one before realizing.   The staff was very apologetic and tried their best to rectify their error, but there is no fixing it once it's eaten.   I find a lot of restaurants are jumping on the GF bandwagon, but they need to realize the responsibility they take on when labeling food GF or free of any other allergen.  Allergen free labels are a promise that those menu items will not make their customers ill and we trust that chefs have done their research to back up the label.  That trust is lost my case. 

I gave them two stars because what I was able to eat was fine taste wise.  The atmosphere was nice and the staff was friendly.

For my lunch I chose the Asian burger with fries, ($7.95) a bowl of the Summerlin soup ($6.50) and an apricot beer ($12). The burger did not have any ""Asian flavors"" at all and it was super dry. It says it comes with house mayo, but they put hardly any on the burger so it was pretty tasteless. I would not order this again. The burger came with skinny fries, but they were nothing special and needed seasoning. I added salt, but it didn't help much. They do give you a lot of fries, and most of them went uneaten. The Summerlin soup was bland as well. It is described as: Cauliflower, squash, coconut milk, green curry, cilantro, pesto. I couldn't taste any curry or even pesto, skip this! I enjoyed the Apricot beer, and they give you a huge bottle (500ml). It was drier than most beers I have tried, but still tasty nonetheless. 

After my meal, I decided to have some dessert. I checked out the baked goods case and decided on a piece of chocolate chip pie ($5.95). It was more like a cookie with chocolate and apricot? I think? in the middle. It was weird that this orange stuff was in this chocolate pie, and although I didn't mind this addition, it would have been nice to know it was going to be in there. So for my meal alone it was over $32! Fucking ridiculous. I don't mind paying good money for a good meal, but paying good money for a bad meal just makes me mad.

Not bad by any means, but nothing to brag about, nor drive out to Summerlin for. 
I appreciate the options. Vegan, gluten free, and risotto at a casual place. 
However, of the four dishes we got, I did NOT expect avocado tofu tacos to be the highlight. 
For me, the risotto base was too fishy. Like salt water fishy, not yummy clam fishy. 
The bolognese was great. The flavor of the salmon was as well, but the pasta underneath did not really do it for me. 
I understand al dente, I am Italian, but there is a difference between straight undercooked, and al dente. With a delicious creamy mushroom alfredo sauce, I was disappointed that I could not eat the pasta. 
This place seemed very family oriented, catering to a birthday party as we were there. I seen the main Chef guy in the back teaching the staff some kitchen techniques. Off to the side there is a big beautiful bar with contemporary yet family style decor. 
If I was closer, I would see what this place has to offer in the future. They did mention only being open 3 months. But with it being so far for me, I doubt I will return. 
I do recommend trying this place, especially if you are close! It might be right up your alley.

It's easy to please with rare and expensive ingredients...it's much harder to keep the price affordable and delicious at the same time...Jaques Cafe does that incredibly well for me.  They combine delicious home cooking featuring healthy, Vegan, and Gluten Free options with natural, organic ingredients. 

We shared Miso soup, Rock Shrimp & Avocado Tacos, Provence Style Beef Short Ribs, Sterling Salmon Belly over pasta, and Cherry Pie...with a cup of Espresso.

The miso soup is made with organic, soy-free chickpeas miso with homemade salmon stock and seaweed at $1.95 for a cup...very flavorful and hearty--I was amazed to hear how chef Jacques made his own stock with Salmon bone. The Rock Shrimp & Avocado Tacos were so delicious!...with avocado and ginger sauce on top of the soft taco, these were one of my favorite tastes of the evening. The Short Ribs were marinated in red wine for 48 hours, then slow cooked for 4 hours...all organic, no hormones...only my tongue can testify how succulent it was. The pasta with the Salmon Belly was cooked perfectly al dente, and flavored with Shitake mushrooms in a beautiful cream sauce. We finished our meal with a Cherry Pie. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and a wonderful texture from the plentiful chunks of whole cherries...it went down so lusciously with a cup of Peet's Espresso.

JC offers Wine, Beer, Sake and Peet's Coffee and Mumi Organic Tea to pair or elevate your meals...though there are also standard soft drink options and mason jars for self-service water. There is a small section of dinner entrees that will cost you between $10 to $18.95 and they comes with choice of roasted vegetables or roasted red potatoes but most of their Lunch and Dinner items are less than $9.00! There is a kids menu that includes 6 options all priced at or under $5.20.

I don't know how they can deliver these fresh and good-for-you items with this price range, but I am grateful that we have this option.

Giving it four stars. The location is super close to me, and I love the area. It's right near the gym and convenience is a huge plus for me. We met some friends here for lunch and decided to eat on the patio. The decor inside is great... The tables and chairs and art are all pretty rustic and beautiful. Their pastry counter looked good but I didn't stare too long... Didn't want to sabotage myself. We requested to have a server come out and take the order since we were already sitting down outside away from the counter. 

They have some pretty interesting menu items. My boyfriend and I shared the quinoa salad... It had a nice array of veggies, but it was super super dry. According to the server, all the dressings were dairy base, which I found really odd. I added some Siraccha sauce... To give it a kick and kill the dryness. The minestrone soup was also prepared vegan, so we had some of that as well. It came out warm, not hot but it was tasty enough to compensate. We ordered mimosas. Finally a place that doesn't premix their mimosas or over use the juice! The water was pretty good as well. It was definitely different, give it a try.

Our friends ordered the burgers and fries and both looked pretty good and tasty. My boyfriend said the fries were great. I would definitely come back... I'll probably bring my own dressing... And I'll probably order something different with a little more flavorful. The service was great though. Look forward to coming back.",p9942XebvxZ9ubHm4SXmMQ,6,4,4,ZmuqQfhHg4R6v1tVUMA1dg

Honestly I was surprised the meals are predominately under $10 .... the quality is much better than prices. The restaurant reminds me of a nicer MTO cafe with better prices... Or much better food than Rachel's with similar process. The kicker is the full service bar!  And the patio is great for outdoor dining.,Vh3ADfgEMv4uWdrIwM235A,2,2,5,tnu7M--q2qId6daklwnPMg

3364515,2015-02-27,1,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"I'm not quite sure I understand the mixed reviews for Jacques, as my husband and I have both had 3 excellent experiences here so far.  We recently temporarily moved in with family on this side of town and have been searching for a casual place to eat that has quality food and is not a chain. We are pretty picky about where we eat, like to support local businesses, and Jacques definitely fits the bill.  We can come in workout clothes or dress up a bit and it has a great atmosphere.  I love the decorations and the staff has been great.

Let's start with brunch... my husband had the breakfast burrito and he said it was delicious with nice highlights of veggies and butter.  I had a bite of his skillet potatoes which may have been the best I've had. Very tender inside with a nice crisp layer on the outside with just enough salt. I had their vegan quinoa special which was nice and refreshing.  It could have had more spice but overall it was a great meal.  I love how their dishes have lots of veggies in them and seems to be the highlight and not just a piece of kale garnish.  I also like that they use organic veggies and have gluten-free/vegan options too.  

Another time we had dinner there and I had the sweet potato fries and east/west salad.  Both very good and hit the spot.  The chicken I added to the salad was a little dry and I think they likely need to brine before cooking which could help.  My husband had the turkey burger with side salad and again said it was really tasty and lots of veggies which we both prefer. 

I also stopped by for a quick green smoothie for breakfast and it was really good and refreshing. I haven't tried any of the pastries, but I have my eye on the gluten-free brownie for a treat :) 

I would also say that the prices are very reasonable for the quality and service. Some dishes are higher in price than your average fast food, but others are really reasonable. The serving sizes are just right and I don't have to waste food. I am willing to pay a little more for better food.

3389920,2014-10-15,8,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"Giving two stars based on the food, location (walking distance from my house) and the decor are amazing... If it weren't for these things Id give negative stars, I've eaten here twice now and had very different experiences...

A few days ago I came here for the first time and brought my mom and Andy. We were very impressed with the rustic decor and the outside setting. It's absolutely beautiful on the patio. 
We had the butternut soup, that was phenomenal. Butternut squash with creme frise and leeks for garnish.  
For entrees we each had a different sandwich, I had the bbq brisket. I was expecting a bbq sauce since that's what the cashier told us.. but none of the less it was still great.
Andy had the Pastrami sandwich which also was missing a sauce bit once we put their housemade Dijon mustard on it the sandwich was great. 
The sweet potato fries are great as well! 

Now for the second trip...

Came in last night (Tuesday around 7pm) and sat at the bar. We never received service, we waited about 10 minutes before we went up to the cashier. The girl told us the bartender never showed up so we had to order at the register. We ordered the calamari, shrimp tacos, and the butternut soup. I asked the girls (two blonde girls and one brunette) if there were any nuts in the tacos or the calamari. I AM DEATHLY ALLERGIC to tree nuts and peanuts. I've been admitted to the hospital twice with my throat closing due to my allergy. No one knew so they asked the cooks. They just shrugged and said there wasn't. When I asked if they were certain (i had forgotten my epipen at home because we walked to the restaurant) they started laughing at me. 
We also ordered the Apricot Cider, so we took our drink and headed outside. When our food arrived we noticed the calamari was accompanied with a green sauce. The brunette told us it was a parsley sauce. We also noticed there weren't any leeks on the butternut soup... That made the soup very bland without the added flavor. 
When I tried a piece of Calamari dipped in the parsley sauce it really tasted like pesto. Andy and I headed inside to ask about it. Because pesto 90% of the time is made with Pine nuts. We were told yes it was pesto. Andy dialed 911 because no one knew if there were nuts in the pesto. NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT KNEW. Then when I told the brunette girl my throat would literally close she LAUGHED and said oh don't be a drama queen, no it won't. ....

What can I even say about that. 20 minutes later we finally found out the pesto was nut free. After me having a full blown freak out panic attack it completely ruined my experience here. When asked if they could bring us ice cream on the house we declined and the blonde girl asked what could she bring us and I jokingly said another drink, she immediately brought us another bottle of apricot cider with a receipt. Then said we could pay for that anytime. 

Now, I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. (13 Years now...) My professional opinion and advice is this, TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Especially the cooks. I can forgive a ditzy cashier girl but I can't forgive a ""chef"" that has no idea what they're cooking. Hire a manager to oversee daily operations and handle guest issues. If this would have happened to anyone else I'm sure they wouldn't have been as nice as Andy and I. 

I want to come back. I liked the food and you can't beat the location. But these kinks need to be worked out before they kill someone, because no one is trained or held accountable.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,28,6,2,mMeakJizC9pr2can_ipDIA
3413238,2014-08-31,8,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"I had high hopes for Jacque's and it's great location.  Went for lunch with 4 friends.  The place is clean and tidy with decent new decor and ample seating, better use of space and decor than the last tenant, but held-over floor planning on the entry is confusing.  Here are the challenges that lead to this rating, in order of occurrence.  I hope they can fix them.

1.  They seated us, then waited until we asked to send us back to the front where we were to order our own food at something of a counter, despite lots of wait staff.  Because the 'order yourself' Chipotle-style was not clear, it was aggravating.

2.  There is no French food here.  The entire menu is variations on the American theme.  The categorization of French is a mistake.

3.  Cappuccinos were served in big coffee mugs, basically a weak, too-much-milk latte with a little foam on top.

4.  ""Asian Burger"" was a dry, unseasoned small piece of lean ground beef that had been brushed with some kind of tempura or soy.  Nothing else asian about it.  

5.  ""Salmon Burger"" was dry, sparsely seasoned deep fried piece of fish on a bun with some lettuce.

6.  SERVICE:  

When one of our party asked them to fix the far-from-correct cappuccino, she was told ""I'll have to charge you for that.""  

When we were asked how everything was, we politely began to voice that the salmon sandwiches were not satisfactory (dry), but got hushed by the wait staff who told us ""I had it yesterday and it was good.""  No offer of any kind to fix anything.

SUGGESTIONS:

Just take the orders at the tables and be done with it.  We ran up to the counter several times, sometimes while the wait staff was also arriving at the table.

Get a barrista

Add some French food

Seasoning, seasoning, seasoning

Train wait staff in customer service and satisfaction

3514792,2014-12-10,1,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"A new entry into the growing fast-casual market, Jacques Cafe in Summerlin can lay claim to plenty of buzzwords used these days when marketing restaurants -- chef-drive, sustainable, quality ingredients, scratch kitchen, etc. But don't let the name on the door fool you. This isn't a French bistro. It's a modern American cafe with an extensive menu ranging from casual soups and sandwiches to more refined entrees.

There seems to be an aversion to plates as everything I've seen has arrived in bowls. That includes burgers and a tough beef brisket sandwich with an over abundance of artichokes and red peppers. Another let down was the butternut soup with a consistentcy of a lumpy gravy instead of a silky smooth soup.

Entrees seem to be the way to go. A half order of ribs, with meat easily separated from the bone with the slightest push from my fork, were covered in a sauce with hints of sweetness and bitterness and topped with microgreens that added some visual brightness. Even better was the Provence style beef short ribs. Rich yet earthy, it was a healthy portion of tender beef with little connective tissue or fat that was accompanied by roasted vegetables. The place is also kid-friendly. Hand breaded with a tempura batter, chicken tenders were under seasoned, but will satisfy most kids. 

Baked good are made in-house. The cheesecake topped with chocolate pearls and crystalized sugar was decent, but would have been much better if they had let it defrost a while longer. Part of it was so frozen I just had to toss it in the trash. The chocolate blueberry brownie displayed a nice balance of sweet and tart notes. For those that are gluten sensitive, they have plenty of offerings like dark chocolate muffin and a surprisingly chewy chocolate chip cookie.

While the food was hit or miss, I love the fast-casual concept with its upscale vibe, and rustic-chic decor. The broad range of modern American fare should be enough to get people in the door, but their overall quality and consistency needs to improve to keep people coming back.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,1,3,67OGP4wdtglNZbC9o3mFhg

-tofu avocado taco
-garden burger
-sweet potato fries
-frozen yogurt with berries

Tofu tacos were delicious!!! Almost tasted like fish tacos! I could seriously eat those all day. Seasoning was just right especially when you add some lemon juice.
Garden burger was also really good, although my only complaint was that the patty was too salty and a bit mushy. Wish that it was somewhat crispy to give the burger some texture.
Sweet potato fries were average, nothing special here.
Frozen yogurt was great! But be warned... It doesn't taste like your average froyo, it tastes like actual yogurt that's still a touch sour, but is neutralized by the berry sauce or mochi that you add. I personally liked it, but then again I like ""different"" tastes.

Jacques cafe was tasty and I'll definitely be back to try more of their dinner portion like pasta and short ribs. They also have a lunch menu that's under $10 so super affordable.

The concept is interesting but confused.  You can order up front or get table service.  I opted for table service but the person that served was sweet as can be but didn't know the food that well and wasn't really a trained server.  A for effort but unless you are actually prepared to serve, just run it like a deli.  Orders up front and they drop the food at your table but that's it.

The menu was even more confusing.  My dining partner and I went over the salads and after saying 'Yuck"" out loud we talked about the ingredients.  Just way too many and not particularly appetizing.  I was confused because I just spent several weeks in Lyon, France and their food was fresh, simple and absolutely delicious everywhere.  Even the 4-5 star restaurants with classic complicated french cuisine just didn't confuse so many things with another.

Going past the salads and on to the soups... same thing only not as bad.  In fact, the entire menu is like it doesn't know what it wants to be.  This place could be a real find if they can cut the menu in half and simplify the food.   It's got a nice little patio, everyone there was friendly.  It's in a spot where there really isn't any other ""grab a bite and a glass of wine"" place, etc.

On the wine - I didn't care for any of the wines on the list but my dining partner did and commented on how reasonable the prices were.  There were several on her ""affordable favorites"" that she knew the retail price and commented their mark-up was really low.

I hope Jacques makes it because it could be charming AND crowded all the time.

On entering, there's a good-sized sign pointing the way to the right and around to go past the bakery cases to get to the ordering area.

I picked up the menu and looked it over.  I ordered the Langosteno omelette and coffee.  For a limited time, coffee is free between 7 AM and 9 AM with $.75 for a refill.  The woman at the counter put a mug down in front of one of the tall thermos containers with a pump.

I filled my cup, walked to a table, and waited for my breakfast to arrive.  It took a reasonable amount of time and she arrived with the omelette.

The omelette had spinach, tomato, and langosteno and was topped with homemade Hollandaise.  On the side were some purple fingerling potatoes and two slices of orange and two pieces of watermelon.  

The omelette was good.  The potatoes had not been dried and water from them soaked down the plate and diluted the Hollandaise.  In the corner, under the fruit, there was some unadulterated Hollandaise and it was very good.  

Breakfast was OK.  I am not a fan of serve yourself at a restaurant but I understand the business model.  Still, I like to be served coffee and have someone come around and refill my cup.  Jacques is OK but I see no reason to go back.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,16,12,3,Km9jHZXdmKHnHAxqVNBmcA

I had the Baja Burger with avocado and French fries. With the chorizo and jalapeño cheese it was a triumph of flavor. My ""side"" was the Bonini burger, a deep fried burger essentially enveloped in a pancake. Inner fat kid rejoiced. 

Staff came to assist us even though we spent ample time scouring the menu deciding what to order at a table...and you're supposed to order at the register prior. Great service throughout! Very friendly staff.

My girl had the Provence style beef short ribs with grilled vegetables. The entree was savory. The only shortcoming was the lack of options for her side dish.

We will return to try the Asian burger and a salad next visit.

Located in the small strip mall on town centre  in Summerlin. With Starbucks, Vons and CVS are all located in the strip mall adjacent.

Jacques was a little surprise. With nice new and up to date cafe that stands out among its local competitors, Jacques I believe is the next hotspot in Sunmerlin.

With a great selection, offering pastries, sandwiches, burgers, salads, gelato with other assorted dessert types.

One thing I realized is the side bar. Offering up Beer and Wine to wash your meal down or to grab a drink with friends. The layout has plenty of chairs,high tops and group seating to choose from.

So getting into the food: Brisket sandwich is pretty dam good! Probably the best sandwich on the menu hands down!
The side salad that comes with it the sandwich has an awesome home made dressing.

I can't wait to comeback and sample the rest of the menu.

So when my usual Happy Hour crew suggested it, I went along with the crowd, even though I knew that it wasn't going to be that kind of place.  

The six of us were seated just beyond the entrance, so I didn't really get a good look at the restaurant.  And since we were a group, the staff made it very easy for us and took our orders, which is not the M.O.

They serve beer and wine at very reasonable prices, making us a very happy and congenial group.  The wine is served in Riedel-type stemless glasses.  Everyone ordered a burger - a couple of salmon burgers, a turkey, the rest beef.  I was very glad to be able to substitute a turkey burger for the beef in my baja burger, which had ground chorizo on top of the patty, jalapeno jack cheese, along with a delicious aioli spread on the torta roll (you can substitute different things for the roll, including gluten-free bread, if you're into the anti-gluten fad du jour).  I was also able to substitute a salad for the fries.  The salad could have used a few more thingies, but it was good anyway - fresh butter lettuce along with some avocado crunchies, and a deliciously unusual house dressing.  I tasted the fries some of my skinnier friends ordered, and they were excellent, the sweet potato ones better than the plain ones, even though I'm not a great sweet potato lover.

With great service, and five other friends who really enjoyed their meals as well, Jacques was a winner.  Now if they'd only stay open later, I'd love to come back with Herb, but we always seem to be having dinner long after their 9 pm closing.  And I don't do breakfast.

The food--I'm very glad they have numerous options here, especially for those of us with specific dietary restrictions. It can definitely be difficult sometimes, so I commend them for that. I get the garden burger or the veggie sandwich, both of which come with a choice of side. I always pick the fries. Their fries taste good and always have a good crisp! Plus, they're the skinny kind, and I like to be able to shove a handful of fries in my mouth all at once with absolutely no shame.

Overall, I do like coming here, but I will mention some consistency issues.

One afternoon, I ordered myself a cappuccino. It tasted like 100% skim milk, as if there weren't anything else. It didn't taste like it had any trace of espresso, yet the color was definitely there.

Another afternoon, my French fries had visible sprinkles of paprika. I certainly don't mind paprika at all, in fact, I think they taste great with fries. But the last time I had ordered them, there were plain. Now, I honestly have no idea if they're supposed to have paprika or not. It's alright though, they were good either way!

I really love the concept and outdoor dining area. And we love supporting independent business, particularly restaurants. I personally don't like paying at the counter each and every time I want something, it's a bit of a pain and can't really enjoy my meal when I have to walk up every few minutes and then pay again.  

My husband and I both had an omelet which were quite good!  On the downside, the potatoes we dry and not palatable. Perhaps offering another option like hash browns or fries would be nice.

The add on's were bit of  a disappointment, I personally would prefer to be offered toast or a muffin with each meal, because that's just standard. 

My son had the pancakes and they were very dry, he only had one bite. 

My cappuccino was lovely and perfect combination. My husbands coffee was really awful and they ended up charging him again when he asked for a different cup. 

Outdoor seating area was really comfortable and great if you have kids because it's enclosed.

I think if they offer toast/muffins as part of your meal and  better potato option for breakfast and tweak the coffee it could be a  breakfast contender. And I would definitely offer a kids menu, we take our son for breakfast every Sunday and that's just a nice feature for families.

That said, I won't be going back as its on the on the high end for breakfast and it doesn't offset the cost enough for me when there are better options for breakfast in Summerlin. If however they tweak a few things, I might check it out again.",gL_7frRo8Segp6-UonJTZA,3,0,1,bkGPotY_ze-P1X_msJBm8A

She casually admitted that there's no curry and did not apologize at all, did not seem at all concerned that we had not gotten what we had specifically been interested in. (Instead, she chose to tell us how she had to open all by herself that morning and that it had been really busy earlier.) We were polite and did not push the point that she should have told us, though in retrospect, I wish we had. While neither of the staff were at all rude, they also did not have much depth in the customer service department. 

I had also ordered the East West salad because the roasted shitake mushrooms sounded yummy. Nope, none in my salad. Geez. Our roasted veggie sandwich was decent (thought it could have been more flavorful but acceptable as a healthy option). The Green Energy shake was tasty albeit sweet and we enjoyed the ginger flavor that was definitely there but was not overpowering.  

I had really wanted to like this place; it would be so nice to have a good, healthy, tasty cafe nearby, but sadly, it was not our experience. I sincerely hope the owners read this and take some action because some basic improvement in service and actually delivering what was promised in the food would go a long way towards success as opposed to another restaurant coming and going in this spot....",D4lK3pICfQExkoJa0HevBA,3,0,2,XXGVESRibbBfNT6gsQhh7g

The Fries both regular, and sweet potato were a generous portion, but where's the beef..
No one ever came over to ask how it is..
People were pleasant there. One has to order at the counter, (ugh).  But Where's the beef.
Hardly any on the sandwich.  For Almost $20.00 for two sandwiches there should have been plenty of beef.",rZQa3JrFbM4IvDxGOcM_qA,1,0,1,uCkEwEnVK1C_FS0fJhS8Jw

Then I went for take away the other day and wow what a disappointment. I'm sad to say that the food was terrible. From the bland turkey burger to the lazily prepared soup to the artificially tasting pastries. The only highlight of the meal were the sweet potato fries and they were mediocre. I officially wasted $24.00 on this so called food. People need to know that the food here is flat out bad before they decide to spend their money and regret it later.
Sorry Jacques but you guys got complacent and lazy.
Hope you make it back to the days when you tried to impress your patrons.",cb4XnNYBJ6YV1ksngX8HRw,2,0,1,LoxAYT41cww3TJeDp5cTjw

5959578,2015-01-17,3,1aj4TG0eFq6NaPBKk6bK7Q,"We were in the neighborhood around 8pm on a Wednesday looking for a spot to get a quick bite and a drink. Seeing as everything seems to close early in the area (even the Stsrbucks we tried first), this was no easy feat.

I finally noticed Cafe Jacques, so we decided to give them a try. They have s number of items on their menu that look tasty. Everything from sandwiches and burgers to soups, salads and small plates. 

We each decided on a different burger. I went with the turkey burger with a side salad instead of fries. 

You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table when it's ready. We ordered and it wasn't long before our food was ready. My fella opted for the fries with his burger so I got to sampled a few of them along with my meal. The turkey burger was fantastic. Flavorful and well-balanced ingredients. The salad was really good as well. Most side salads are a bit of an afterthought, but the dressing was incredible and the greens were really fresh and crunchy. The fries were great as well. They had the perfect balance and were thin, crispy and well-seasoned. The perfect fry to complement our meal.

Service was incredibly friendly and everyone was very patient with us since we walked in about an hour before they closed and ended up staying til a few minutes after they were scheduled to closed. We made sure they didn't mind and apologized for the inconvenience, which they were very gracious about.

I have to say I wasn't expecting much based on the mixed Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised by this little shop and looking forward to giving them another visit in the near future.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,5,4,811C6wzprSiPCKs2Eil72A
