Went inside and the guest bartender Tommy was cool enough to find it for me, they have 3 good sized tv screens surrounding the bar so multiple games can go on at once. I met some great UNLV students who gave me some great tips on the town and the drink prices were great ( $4.50 for each beer is cool by me... Beats $7 at a lot of places). They have pool tables all around and juke box constantly jammin great rock tunes. I'll be back tonight for another kings game!

We actually ended up here one night on a half-joking recommendation by a bartender at Freakin Frog, and I'm somewhat pissed we didn't come here earlier because it wasn't until 2 or 3 by the time we got there.

I had some trepidation because of the characters milling around outside when we walked up.  After going in, I got that ""WTF am I doing here?"" feeling when I saw the crowd and when they saw us.  However, that all ended when a friendly bartender ran up and asked us what we wanted.  We got a couple cheap pitchers of something.  I honestly don't remember what they were.

Anyway, I ended up shooting the longest game of 8 ball ever with a random cool guy named Grimace.  Also, a couple of flea bags who know their way around a meth pipe seemed to be passing a relatively cute redhead back and forth nearby.  (She may have been trying to get away.  I could barely take care of myself or hit a straight on shot...)  Her drunk (maybe high) ass fell into me, and I have to say, she smelled surprisingly good and actually apologized.

That was up until about 2 weeks ago when my friends and I went to a nearby bar that we usually frequent, only to find out it was full of douche bags that night. 

After deciding we didn't want to deal with that all night, one friend suggested Cheers as it was so close by. We all thought, ""Eh, why not give it a try?"" 

I am so glad we did. The bartender was super friendly and we never had to ask him for another drink as he was super attentive and made sure we had what we needed the whole time. He even suggested a drink to my friend when she ordered an apple beer. He said to drop a shot of fireball whiskey in it, and it was actually pretty enjoyable. They have a good selection on the jukebox, plenty of tvs and they even have a punching bag game.

But try as I might, I can't really figure out why Cheers insists on keeping 'grill' in its name, unless it's referencing the now defunct window that used to serve up Mexican fare from the Roberto's next door.  (The new smoking laws have now rendered it necessary to actually leave the bar and walk next door.  Pain in the butt.)

Regardless, Cheers is a good, low key place to catch up with some friends, have some big, cheap beers, and shoot a few racks of pool on one of the 5 or so fairly well maintained tables that are available.  The crowd is pretty evenly split between twenty-and-thirty-somethings and older, video poker playing denizens.  The TVs behind the bar show a satisfying mixture of sports, reality TV, and random movies.  The ambiance is lacking, so bring your own with you in the form of a few good stories and a few raucous laughs.

4409631,2013-05-12,1,6UqOXFic_vu2JLGuu8YD6A,"When I was in the neighborhood, I had to stop off at my favorite University hangout. So many of them had changed names over the years. I still have a Moose Mcgillicuddy's shirt, one of the first places I went to get security warning drunk. 

Cheers was a hidden bar, I think you have to know someone to go to it for the first time or you'd never find it? That was the case for me, my first time I was driven there on a night of debauch. I had no idea where we were in relation to any area of town, I couldn't even see the Strat or Luxor light. Doomed. 

The biggest memories I had of Cheers occurred one year when I was in town alone for the holidays with xmas eve and day off. It sucks because of the last 4 holidays of the year, I always bargain to work Thanksgiving, xmas day and eve to score new years day off and a lunch shift if not off new years eve. 

One of the rules I made for drinking on my 23rd birthday (I got alcohol poisoning on my 20-22nd b-days) was that I would drink to remember, not to forget. Well, I didn't like to have xmas off, everyone was out of town. I had patrolled the strip and saw all the Jewish, Vietnamese & other non-christians out. 

Bars are open 24/7, well you'd be surprised how many bars start looking for their keys to doors that had remained open the other 364 nights/ year. I think I was on my 4th bar and I think I got a text to go to Cheers. This is 7+ years of accumulated blackout drunk memories, so my memory is like the reception of a portable tv. 

I was on my motorcycle and don't even want to know how I got there. I usually sat and ate something until I felt Monday at 9:00AM sober, paper pusher style before driving. Except for twice. And I still have the ptsd to lurch me out of sleep randomly to celebrate. 

We played pool, ordered Mexican from next door & they put it in the service window when that was legal to. We had such a great time we planned it for the following year, then again... 

It turned out to be one of the best Vegas xmas's I ever had. It was the wayward holiday crew, people who had no where to be because they couldn't get time from work. Or they just didn't want to be home alone. Or they strategically escaped their family with an excuse. It was us holiday left behind folk. And we were alright without the holiday stress to get everything prepared and everyone over the house, etc.

There was even a drunk Santa. Did we make out? Who did I kiss, it smelled like ash, red wine and the hopes and dreams of people stuck at the airport. 

I know we celebrated there the year before and a couple of years after the ""clean air"" act passed, and dining areas had to have a physical wall/ window separating the bar area. My argument was I didn' t want to sit in the dining area alone while everyone was partying. It should be my choice to bring food in where people are smoking. Whatevs, laws be cray. I voted against it and I don't even smoke. Damn window plastered up!

Always great service from the bartender, made me feel welcome and hung out and talked with us like she was happy to be there. They have the life, I loved bartending.

So I had to pay my own tribute to the wayward holiday vagabonds even though I was 5 months off. (and about 7-8 years past). I don't know what happened the first year I didn't go. I didn't want to be the guy that got too busy and left my warriors behind!

As I type this, it's Mother's Day. It's another holiday I can't really celebrate and I think of the others who can't also, because their mother passed away or some other reason. Maybe we'll have to think of a place where we can go to feel better and not think about another holiday that just bombards those of us without.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,0,1,5,Ohv-VqAjIFiDtLiM8FejBA

So this past sunday our games were showing @ the same time = we had to go someplace to watch our games together. Some people can't beleive I could even walk next to much less be WITH a 49er fan and vice versa.  We take a lot of flack about it but that's ok, everyone has a fan. 
We orig. went to a ""Cowboys"" bar b/c I won the coin toss. Yes most of my important decisions are decided the good old fashioned way, the quarter. If its good enough for the NFL, its good enough for me. 
The bar we went to was listed as a Cowboys bar. UM NO. It was Rascals on Swenson/Maryland pkwy area. Can we say scary neighborhood. OMG. I was worried I wouldnt make to my car on time, but that's another review.

This place was our 2nd choice and I was very surprised by it. I pictured it much fancier but I was glad it wasnt. I dont like fancy fancy. I'm here to watch football not much else! The bartender, Mary Ann was so sweet! 
I loved her. She TOO was a 49er fan so she and my bf made friends quickly. She had several games on different TVsbut the volume was only on for the 49er/chiefs game which was a blowout and very hard to console my bf. I cheer for his team unless they are playing me, then we all bets are off! but I refuse to wear 49er gear. I draw the line there!

Now MaryAnn, was so sweet she turned up my game so that I TOO could have volume. That is my biggest thing when selecting a bar. If you've ever read any other of my reviews you know I HATE when bars show sports games and then play music. really? Well not this place. I would def. go back!
PRICES: $3 FOR 22 OZ draft beers - budweiser and bud light.CANT BEAT IT! And.. when I asked her what she had on special she said that they have 24 hr happy hour. Well cant' beat that either.
