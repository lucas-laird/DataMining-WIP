This time the Lady at the counter was terrible.Didn't care about whether we were ordering food or not  she was busy watching the TV. When I was ordering I had to repeat my order a couple times because her focus was on the Hispanic news channel. Do you know how annoying that is? Tables were not  clean and there's food & paper on the floor. Foods gone south like the customer service.

I have to be honest though,  as someone who does not speak Spanish,  I had difficulty communicating with the cashier. Three examples:

1) I almost never have cash on me, so I asked if there is a minimum on cards (ex. Some restaurants have a $10 minimum when using credit cards).  The cashier ""yes, debit-credit okay.""
2) ""Can you do take-out?"" Blank stare... ""To-go?"" Nervous smile... ""Take-away?"" The cashier sighs in frustration trying to decode my question.  I ended up playing charades to get my answer.
3) I asked if the combos come with a drink. At this point,  I am this poor cashier's worst nightmare with all of my questions. 

What I have learned: no credit card minimums, I can place to-go orders and you have to order drinks separately. I would come here again (language barrier aside, the cashier was polite).",1Hhz6FGgvi9qd1q6PR0AEA,0,0,3,sIaWteiw2UIPgi50FzPunQ

My family has frequented this location several times.  Usually, we order quite a few things, however, I came from across Taco Bell because my little one wanted rolled tacos.  Also, maybe I was able to catch this mistake because I only ordered one plate, instead ordering several items and never catching it before.

I placed an order for #1 which is rolled tacos, rice and beans.  The order should have been $5.75 and tax, however, I gave my debit card and was charged $8.16.  When I got home, I checked the receipt and noticed I was charged for #11 which was $7.55 and with tax, came to $8.16.

I am not hispanic, however, I do know when the clerk turned around and told the cook ""numero 1, pollo) I thought I was getting charged for the correct combo, not being overcharged for something I never ordered.  I was quite surprised my order was correct, just not the pricing.

The next morning I called the restaurant and was told Manwell was the manager and to get a hold of him I would have to call around 7:00 a.m. to get a hold of him.  I tried this morning and got several people who could not understand me to finally find someone who could speak to me in English to tell me his name is Javier and he was the manager.  When I informed him I was told Manwell was the manager, he told me to call back in a couple hours.

I have yet to speak to the manager, yet; however, I need to know if this is normal practice to overcharge customers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",dscPf_w0y9n1a0PZky3a2g,2,0,1,XSmgzp8flJYm2LpT6AjkWg

There. I said it. I'm not even ashamed I said it, either!

This location can be found on Jones just south of the 215. It is in the same plaza as Taco Bell, right next door to a Liquor store. 

I was a frequent visitor of DT in my previous neighborhood, so all I can really do is compare this location to that one on Maryland Parkway and Windmill. 

so, here goes..

-this location has a much nicer dining area than the Maryland Parkway location. I can actually see myself taking one in here sometime, where as the other location was strictly a grab and go place.

- they seem to be a lot busier here! I never walked into the other location to see a line 6 people deep! That being said, they really worked through the line fast! They were hustling here!

- the parking situation is atrocious here! If it is busy at all, good luck finding a space! I never encountered that problem at the other location. Not even once.

- the food its self: I never complained about portion size at the last location, but so far both visits here the portions have been ginormous! HUGE! Plus it is the same reliable yummy food I have come to expect from Don Tortaco.

If anything I am going to have to exhibit a little self control with the carne asada and breakfast burritos before I develop a little buddha belly!

I like this place. I will be back. Probably a lot.

But I'm starting to get really pissed off. Every time I go in there (I order the same thing every time), I ask for a burrito ""and can you add all the extras to it please?"" (I'm not painting myself in a better light here, working in customer service in my teen years has trained me to always be polite). Without fail, the girl (always a different girl so far) will always look at me SUPER confused like she's NEVER seen the menu before in her life. The menu is simple: tacos, burritos, etc... And then ""extras"" to add to your main dish (there's also extra sides, so maybe that's the confusion?). No matter how good her English is, I have to point to the God damn menu and go ""extras please"" and she'll ask about them all. One. By. One. ""Rice?"" Yes.. ""Guac?"" Yes.. ""Salsa?"" ALL OF THEM, DID I STUTTER? Due to my crankiness after a 12 hour shift last night, I didn't care to go through this dance again, I sent my boyfriend and he told her the same thing ""all the extras added, please"". She was confused. Clearly, because when he got home my burrito (which I've been looking forward to ALL week for my diet cheat day) had nothing but meat and cheese in it. It was not a burrito. It was a sticky meat tube. His burrito came out perfect by the way, how did she get one and not the other?!?! My cheat day was ruined. I can't just get another one the next day because they're HUUUUGE (my inner fat kid is usually delighted by this fact). Can't eat that more than once a week, no sir. 

Like I said, I love the food, I love the place. But these are some of the dumbest, most unaware, fucking oblivious cashier girls I've ever encountered. At the very least, I did some math and found out that I wasn't charged for the extras I requested and didn't receive, so that's nice at least.

This place is a 4 stars spot, not so much for the food, but mostly for the service. 

The girl at the register (Alejandra) literally takes care of the place. She does everything! And with a huge smile on her face. I was very impressed with the way she dealt with the customers, orders, kitchen. 

The food pretty good. I got the chicken burrito with the combo. Chicken was good, probably little bit too much sour cream for me inside. Rice were decent and the beans were tasty. 

The place was busy when I sat there! 

Food 3 stars, but experience definitely more than that.

Basic Mexican food but I will tell something that stands out here..they offer desserts like tres leches and chocolate flan..amazing desserts so expect decent Mexican food. Great desserts bad service depending on whose working.

The girl that works the day shift is VERY friendly and jokes with many of the customers that come in. She has gone so far as to chase me down in the parking lot once when I left my bag of salsas on the counter. The food is always fresh and always a few notches above the other guys in taste and quality. By far, the best taco shop in Vegas! Love them!",ckxxADuGCCkMDO7jJBULcw,0,0,5,G-y5xxEee0WUgeKhtqYF-A

I went for the carne asada tacos , I've only been twice and both times the meat is kind of dry and you have to eat it with some kind of salsa . Maybe it's the time of day that I go ? Because the carne asada on the fries isn't dry . Anyways , affordable and open 24 hours for the party people out there",EcE0TDJnA7Mk6Spi_09Utg,0,0,4,BM20L5mYUqh8tE7OTSB-Gg
5850818,2016-04-25,0,2DydwQRkIutHarWT_o1L0Q,"Went in a few hours ago to order 3 bean and cheese burritos, 1 cheese quesadilla, and 1 chimichanga meal (all of which I've ordered before) NO TOMATOES! 
There were 3 men working, all of which were unfriendly and rude from the get go. I was friendly and commented that I love their beef chimichangas because they don't put any tomatoes in it, to which he agreed. 
I put a dollar in change in the tip jar and waited for food. 
Food came up pretty fast, all in a tyed bag, I said ""this is everything?"" He said it was ""all of it"". I said have a great night and they said nothing in return. 
I get home and see I'm missing 2 of the 3 bean and cheese burritos I ordered. 
With hungry kids at home I called right away and spoke to the man that had rung me up. I said that 2 of my burritos are missing (no receipt was in bag). To which he said ""I know"", then he tells me right after that ""the machine told him it was only one I ordered?!"" (Why did he say, I know??), THEN he tells me he didn't understand me...OK. He tells me that there is nothing they can do.... I said "" OK...no worries, guess I'll have to just figure it out"". He immediately said ""who ME?"", very defensive. I repeated what I had said. And we hung up.  
It gets better....
I just opened my chimichanga container and start mixing the guacamole and sour cream and see a couple pieces of tomato....
They not only put tomatoes in it....they put them in the worst spot, UNDER THE CHIMICHANGA! And a LOT (I have a pic). I've had to dig them all out of the worst spot. 
Why on earth would someone do this to a customer that did NOTHING wrong? I mean, come on. 
I've never had this problem before and I've never had issues worth the food before. This was done on purpose because either someone hates their job or they had a bad day. I don't know, but I'll never go here again.",pSVrldsuCwsRVNBdXRpafA,1,0,1,1Fwyrx6bs0OD30nVP4w8lQ

They are always friendly and welcoming and make whatever I want the way I ask them. Their store is always clean and I always see their workers cleaning or doing something to make sure the store is ready for business.

They're open 24 hours, so it's great to come any time of day!

I usually get Adobada Fries (extra crispy) with no sour cream or guacamole. It's soooo delicious. Whether I eat there or take it to go, they always seem to hook a girl up.

Definitely love me some Adobada Fries.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,0,0,4,OQuH7OpQLxzWc7Vx5_WuvQ

My fella and I both ordered breakfast burritos and the tortillas were not fresh and the size of the burrito was skimpier than I'm used to seeing at other similar type restaurants. 

I might stop here again when I'm in a pinch but I won't go out of my way to return.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,17,12,2,24amwhhcdYSpQ4njL8n2wA
