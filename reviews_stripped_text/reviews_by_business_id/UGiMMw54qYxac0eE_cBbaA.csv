The menu is that of flavors and preparedness from Baja California...or supposed to be, at least.

Decided to order the Shrimp Ceviche.  It should have just been called shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp was grilled and then marinated with lime. Real shrimp ceviche is not grilled and is prepared raw then ""cooked"" by the lime.  As you can imagine, I was eating jumbo shrimp with a rubbery texture.

Dean was the bartender that served me with my beer and food.  He appears to be this washed out Vegas bass player, ex-surfer, with a care free attitude that reflects his service.  Quite entertaining, actually.  Especially when he would talk smack about the other customers around the dining area with the other servers when they would come around fulfilling drink orders.  

As I had my bill in possession and laid down the corporate card...it probably took him about 10 minutes to pick it up.  Passed by it twice if I recall correctly.  C'mon buddy...I gotta catch that next flight.

Dean...I know you're too old to think of accomplishing any more goals at this point in your life, but please be considerate of what you say about others and be a little more tentative to the people you serve.

Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill was the only sit down restaurant at our gate at the LV Airport and at the end of a great vacation, we wanted a nice place to sit down and have our last vacation meal.  Big--- big---- BIG MISTAKE! Just thinking about the meal is making my stomach feel queasy.  This review doesn't have anything to do with the prices at the restaurant ($13 for a sh*tty mixed drink that was mostly ice?) It's about the quality.  We tried what seemed like 2 pretty safety choices: a grilled chicken sandwich and a chicken quesadilla.  The chicken sandwich was served with a sad helping of fries topped with a sprinkling of shredded white cheese. Visually unappetizing (served on a triangular plastic plate in a haphazard way).  The chicken in both dishes tasted like something precooked you would buy in a bag at Sam's.  That's fine if you want convenience and you know what to expect.  Wendy's, Burger King, Popeye's (all choices in our gate that I WISHED we selected instead of Sammy's) can manage to serve a real piece of chicken that doesn't taste like it fell off a Cisco truck-- what's going on with Sammy's? Not only was the food substandard it ended up making me feel funny-in-the-tummy later.  The gift that keeps on giving.   Not only does my experience sour me on Sammy's restaurant(s) but I seriously don't think I'll be able to hear a Sammy Hagar or a Hagar Van Halen song without feeling sick.

899668,2016-09-08,0,UGiMMw54qYxac0eE_cBbaA,"Terrible from start to finish. 

I walked in and stood up front not knowing whether it was open seating or I needed to be sat. Two servers up front just looked at me until I asked if I could seat myself. After I sat down, my server (not knowing it at the time) came by about 3-4 minutes later and threw a couple napkins on the table. I assumed he was the busser and someone would come by to take my drink order. Then for the next 10 minutes, servers walking back and forth, actively not making eye contact. I finally got up and asked a random server if I could order. She just replied, ""yeah"".  Then she sent over my server who was short bald guy who initially threw the napkins on my table without saying anything earlier. I gave him my order then had to tell him I would like a glass of water as well. 

My burger and fries showed up not 5 minutes later. They showed up too fast. When I tasted my fries they were cold and my burger was just not good regardless of the fact that it had a crap ton of toppings on it. I felt as if it was an extra of something that was cooked a half hour earlier. I flagged down my server a minute later asking for ranch to mask the cold fries. By the time he came back with the ranch, I had already finished half my burger. I saw him just chatting with the cook in the kitchen window. The ranch tasted rancid so I didn't use it. The server didn't come by again until it finally dawned upon him to check on me 15 minutes later. He looked at my plate and said, ""well apparently everything is good"" since I finished most of it as I was starving from just getting off a very long flight. I then asked for my check. That was the quickest part of the entire experience -- him feeling the need to get me out of here as soon as possible even though the restaurant was dead!

I am a manager in the hospitality industry so I don't like to leave comments like these, but this definitely needs to be said. There is a serious lack of training here. It is for that reason I also don't like to complain because I have to listen to people complain all day at work about petty crap.

This place is awful!  I rarely say that but it really was!  Our flight was delayed so we decided to hit up Sammy's for a quick meal.  There wasn't any signs so we seated ourselves.  Immediately we were approached saying that kids cannot sit in the bar area (I felt very far from the bar btw) and we had to sit upstairs.  Upstairs???  A foot away and up a 6 inch step up.  Um I beg to differ on the stairs comment.  But whatever we will go with it.  

We get seated and order a couple drinks.  We weren't super hungry so we shared the Chips with Guacamole and a Burger with fries.

First off, the chips were straight up obvious out of a bag...and cold and stale.  The salsa and guac had to have been from a jar because I couldn't imagine them making anything homemade here. Both totally bland but we ate about half of it.  Definitely a disappointment.  The burger was a ""build your own"" and we ordered it with carmelized onions $1.50 and jack cheese $1.50.  There was like two strings of onion (for that price?) but the burger was ok overall.  The fries were cold.  The best part was this coleslaw on the side that looked like they got it out of the gutter.  It was yellow-brownish and literally the serving was the size of a tablespoon.  We laughed at how small the serving size was...maybe they didn't want us to get us sick?!!  So gross.

The wine and the ""Can't Drive 55"" drink both $13+ were a bit overpriced.  Ya think?  I know I know-its airport mark ups.  What do you expect?  I wasn't picky - I was going on a mini vacay!

I think the whole time we were there we only heard one Sammy song.  I definitely will choose somewhere else the next time.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten from the airport until now.  Sammmay!  This place is a hot mess.  A definite need for some tender loving care and some pride in your food.

 The Sammy's beach Bar & Grill is in the Las Vegas International Airport behind the security checkpoint. I can't stand restaurants that put little effort into their service and food preparation. The service is poor to bad! The food was ok. 

On this visit they made our food wrong, which by itself isn't all that uncommon.  But what they did after they served it and we said something truly sets them apart from other restaurants..... They told us sorry, and they didn't offer to fix it and then charged us full price for it?! WTF? I am cool with paying for food I ordered, Shit the bill was only like $20 bucks. But if you make the food wrong, admit that the cooks made a mistake. Then say sorry we can't do anything for you, that just doesn't make any sense!? I was tired from the weekend in Vegas or I would have spoke with the manager. I Thought this was just bad form. How can you run a business like this? What happen to making things right?

In any other environment/location this type of service wouldn't be tolerated, but since they are at the airport with people who just need to eat and can't go anywhere else I guess it's acceptable.

Where to start? It just feels dirty. Nothing is cleaned, people leave, others sit down, a dirty rag might wipe the table off, might not. People hovering waiting for others to leave. Super cramped with people bumping you while you eat. Loud music (including much country music) that doesn't fit with the beach vibe. Servers seemingly disappearing. Food stacked up from the kitchen and sitting for as much as 10-15 minutes before being served.

And while we're talking food, let's take a minute to really study what is being served here. After a weekend of big fat food, I wanted something simple, like a chicken sandwich, but I still want tons of flavor. I see a grilled chicken sandwich on the menu that comes with guacamole spread, tomato, lettuce, chipotle crema, queso fresco, and crispy onions and I think to myself, ""Hey self, this has to be good, right?""

Wrong. I ordered mine with no tomato and there was no tomato, which is a plus. But the lettuce was a single piece of romaine, there was no guacamole spread, no queso, and no crispy onions. So I was left with a sad little piece of bread with teeny tiny chicken, one piece of romaine, and a flavorless chipotle crema. No bueno.

Oh yeah, it was cold, too.

Worse yet were the Kicked Up Fries. These are french fries with queso and red chile spice. There was no flavor in these fries whatsoever and worse yet, they were cold as well.

Sadly, it seems that the worst of the worst was the goal and between the kitchen and service - Sammy's exceeded their own expectations and then some?. 

The idea is simple: carbon copy theft of Chili's and Applebee's airport restaurant location's menu and vibe with a bit of a surfing kitch in the interior decorations and entree titles. The prices are as expected (obscene), as is the level of service (atrocious). So far, so bad. 

...and it gets worse.

Everything comes out on microwave safe dishes, as well.... suspect, right? 

I split some nachos (tostitos style chips with shredded mexi-mix cheese barely melted on top), and a burger (uniform grey color throughout the 'beef' patty, and bacon that had obviously come out of a bag, pre-cooked).

http://www.sammysbeachbarandgrill.com/locations/las-vegas/

So, because Sammy Hagar donates his profits to charity (what an awesome gesture), I will gladly give his expensive airport restaurant a five star review. 

Yes, it's overpriced, even by airport standards. My ""Sammy's Breakfast Burrito"" (Flour tortilla, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, guacamole, pico de gallo, queso fresco, with bacon or sausage) ran 14 and a half buckaroos and a coffee (Seattle's Best and EXCELLENT) ran $3.50. So after tax, that's like $20 which was definitely too much for what I got.

But let me say this, my breakfast plate was pretty darned good. Lots of scrambled eggs, lots of sausage, great tasting guacamole and pico, and a generous scoop of home fries. 

But that pricing! You can get a hotel style buffet for that money, but hey -I wasn't at a Marriott or a Sheraton brunch, I was at the Las Vegas Airport.

Service was fine, with multiple check backs and coffee refills.

I liked the music in the restaurant a lot. Between Sammy Hagar commentaries, I heard the Stones, the Who, AC/DC, Talking Heads and a great old song-Spirit in the Sky by Norman Greenbaum. 

I wonder if I can write off my breakfast as a tax deduction?",cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ,10,8,5,vmpL_2Vw-YuyFzLZSUqvEA

The restaurant's dining area isn't that big so it's tough to navigate through with your luggage.  You seat yourself and then the lovely wait staff will come to help take care of you.  We were lucky enough to have Ruthlee help us out today.  They also have the cool buttons at the table where you can ring for service or pay your bill.  Granted the place is small enough where it might not be necessary but it is helpful to have just in case.

I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it was pleasantly good.  It comes with grilled chicken, guacamole, spread, tomato, lettuce, chipotle crema, queso fresco, and crispy onion.   It came with a seasoned side of fries.  There's also cholula at the tables along with ketchup so it added an extra kick to the fries.
Food came out decently quick since they probably expect people have plane rides to catch.  I will definitely have to come back the next time I have to reluctantly eat at the airport.",HmrLyqR8skk7ReB2vwJ4HQ,2,1,3,tbCtzE1ePvqoghUXBcYnXQ

I waited about 15 mins before a server came to greet us. Once she arrived, she apologized for the wait, it was fine, we were not annoyed by it at all. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my fiance ordered a salad. Her salad made it to the table in about 5 mins. She took a bite and she realized the guacamole (advertised as avocado only) tasted odd, ""like the fridge"". It was an odd salad, HUGE, just some greens, jicama and an ice cream scoop shaped glop of ""avocado"" and some dressing. We planned to send it back but we didn't see our server again. After about 30 mins and hearing nothing and not seeing our server, I was ready to go. Our flight was leaving in 45mins. I had to walk up to the bar and ask our server to come see us. She got to our table and I stated that I hadn't received my sandwich and explained the issue with the salad. Her first response was ""well I put the sandwich in"". My response was ""That's not the point, I don't have it"". Her response ""it's not my fault"" I was annoyed already by the fact that a. I didn't have my food b. she never came to our table again, and now our server is saying it's not her fault. The salad. We let her know the salad wasn't good. Her response ""Looks fine to me"". I said. We want to talk to a manager. Her response ""Why? that salad is fine, she can't help you"". Her next sentence was ""If you want that free I have to get a manager because I can't take things off the check"". I said, ""I don't want to pay for this and I'm not paying for the sandwich I didn't receive either, get me a manager please"". She stormed away. After about 5 mins she comes back and lays a check on out table. I assumed that it was a 0 check and she chose not to have a manager come to see us. I was fine with that. I was in a hurry and I wasn't ready to fight with anyone honestly. I looked at the check and was shocked to see the salad. I looked at her and said, ""I'm not paying for that salad, it was inedible"". She looked right at me, grabbed the check, and wadded it up and threw it at us. She said, ""well, sorry, don't pay then"". At that point, I decided to pay. I didn't want to be accused of stealing in an airport trying to get home. My fiance put $7 on the table. She grabbed the money and chased us out the door literally grabbing my fiance trying to shove the money back into her hand yelling ""take it, take it. I don't' want your money"". There are so many things wrong with this story. Was I clearly annoyed? yes. Should we have been treated that way when we complained about bad service and bad food? NO.

My husband got the breakfast burrito. Which as shown on the menu is just tortilla, eggs, sour cream, salsa, and potatoes on the side. It costs extra for cheese and meat to be added to your plain burrito. The whole this was much better than I expected, the flavor was quite good for airport dinning!

The menu serves a variety of options but I went for what they were famous for, the Cubano.  The sandwich was pretty good somewhat better than other Cubano sandwiches I have tried.  It also
comes with fries which is a plus.  The prices are
typical for the airport but I didn't expect a draft beer to cost $10.50, almost as much as the sandwich but hey the knights just won, it's a celebration!

Sadly, this was another typical airport restaurant experience: overpriced and nothing to write home about.

Seating is first come, first serve and open seating - which isn't obvious at first. Note that the majority of the restaurant is 21+ so this might not be the best choice for families.

Service was fine and food was speedy. I got the burger (safe bet at an airport restaurant) and it was again, fine. 

I did like how there is a buzzer at each table to ring for ordering and requesting the check.

The food was good and reasonably priced. We ordered the salad with grilled chicken, chili, and fries. The salad was HUGE and yummy. The chili was perfect: hot, without beans, and had perfect consistency. The chili was served with a side of tortilla chips that were also really good. The fries were flavored with garlic and also had grilled garlic chunks in the pile. It was also topped off with some cheese and seasoning. What I liked most about the food was that it seemed that they actually put effort into it. I liked it, and I wish they had a Sammy's at more airports. if you are in a rush, though, you should try something else. Sammy's is more of a sit-down spot and the food takes a while to come out.

The nachos did not have a great deal of cheese (melted versus shredded), which for me who loves cheese, was not impressive.  So if you are one who does not like a lot of cheese on your nachos, this would be right up your alley.

They definitely had a unique taste to them.  This could have been largely due to the Chimichurri dressing, guacamole and black bean cream sauces.  Definitely different, but good.

There were quite a few TVs over the bar area which you could here, as well as music being played over the entire restaurant.  The music was just the right volume, not too loud but at a volume that was enjoyable.
