The staff is super friendly and really takes care of you.  Don't be shy to ask for ""extra or more"" of any toppings!",u6keGlqJnJx4S44aZGFWNQ,1,0,5,VAfr-RS2EvvtSKYbhfhWow

Pretty much make your own pizza with unlimited toppings without extra charges! How awesome is that?!  AND for a great price! $7.99!  (Additional charge for wheat or GF dough... But still worth it) 

The other joint down the street from this place, Anthony's, it cost like a dollar for each additional topping. And to top that, when they do add the additional toppings, it barely sticks on to the pizza.  Well this place, I don't know if I've had awesome pizza, but this is by far very good. This place is supper fast too.  The amount of time that it took me to pay and figure out what drink I wanted, my pizza was ready.  

The dough to toppings ratio was perfect. I didn't feel like I was having a carb over load so that's a plus.  The crust wasn't hard like the other pizza joint. It was to me, perfect.  I honestly can't wait to come back and try something else. 

The staff was pretty friendly too!  If I could eat pizza everyday, this would be a place to go. 

So with that being said, Happy Eatings!",0uCWbprsjcEwotwKRVKpWQ,2,1,5,V26aaevEyO53zre6ll2Zzw
3588020,2016-10-30,2,DYNeABXl0-ZviedEXX-gUw,This was my first visit to any kind of build your own pizza establishment.  I would compare it to   Subway in that you start with whatever dough base you want and go on from their as far as sauces and toppings.  It's unlimited for $7.99 and the size is enough for at least two meals.   Having never been here I was a little overwhelmed by the menu board but once you actually see the toppings and your pizza being prepared designing your pizza becomes easy.  And they will accommodate your request to go easy or add extra with any topping.  The only change I would make to my next order is to ask for it well done as I prefer my crust a little crispier.,YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,3,4,5,WVmfyszmS5QxK4tOK2A9Dw
