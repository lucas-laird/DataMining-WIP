14014,2013-05-08,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"This was honestly the worst experience I've had at a restaurant in a very long time, if not ever. My husband and I had reservations for two hours before we went to see a show that I've wanted to see for years. We had a Groupon that was two courses (burgers with sides and a dessert) with wine. We were seated (one of six tables with two servers, a manager and a bartender...so not exactly busy) and it took 20 minutes for a server to come by and get us water. We ordered the wine and were ready to order, but he said he'd get the wine first. We waited another 20 minutes. He came back over with the wine and took a good five minutes opening it, telling us that the manager was too busy to get the wine and he usually doesn't open the wine. He then was about to leave and I told him we'd like to order. He took our order and the food came out pretty quickly, about 15 minutes later. It was fine. Not as good as some of the other burger places in Vegas like Holsteins, Burgr or LBS. The fries tasted like they came out of a freezer bag. We ate and then sat another 20 minutes waiting for them to clear our table. When we finally ordered dessert, we waited another 20 minutes until I was livid because we were going to be late for our show. An hour and forty minutes for a one course meal?! Our server came out and told us that they didn't have the dessert we ordered, even though we saw it come out for other guests. They charged us for the extra side we ordered and tax and tip, but since we had to leave we never got the dessert that we had paid for. The manager and server were not apologetic and were quite rude. I would never, never go back to this place. And needless to say, we missed the first 15 minutes of a show I've waited years to see. 

I typically am very forgiving at restaurants as my husband works in the service industry and I know things can get hectic, but seriously. There were a dozen people in the restaurant. Get your shit together PoshBurger.",byrYJzHgy8DAMovA9K1CBA,2,0,1,TwXdU1t_9od2wcADjzW5_A
30560,2013-06-07,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"I bought lunch for the office here today. We ordered three Angus burgers and one Turkey burger. Everyone agreed it was one of the best burgers they ever had and we all recommend the skinny fries with garlic sauce to you. The kitchen is open and those guys look like they really care and work hard. The atmosphere is really cool, trendy and just a little stuck up, but the staff were friendly enough to over come that. So I love the place and I love the staff and I love the food, why only a three star when this owner is Michelin rated? At $25 a meal it should be incredible and it was ok and over priced. I asked for medium rare, they questioned me about the pink, I said I prefer the redder side, closer to rare than medium rare. All the burgers came out medium. No pink. Come on guys, I want to rate this place five stars, but at these prices you need to knock 50% off the price. Or step it up. (ps, the fries were soggy, tasted amazing, but needed a crisp to be worth it). Like the staff at the Weekly, I want to love this place so bad, maybe in a month or two, huh? And the one star groupon reviews? Those people are smoking crack. Nobody who uses living social or groupon deserves food this good, those reviewers seriously need to step up their game, too.

124311,2013-04-24,1,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"I went with the star of the menu, the kobe burger with a brioche bun, truffle aioli, seared foie gras, frizzled onion, watercress cherry tomatoes and a fried quail egg. Despite all those toppings, I was brought out a burger that was completely flavorless and sadly disappointing. The meat on its own had no seasoning at all, and was just lost in the burger. The patty was not formed well for the size of the bun, and was way too narrow and thick. It was also quite dry, despite the mess of grease that formed on my plate early on. Or maybe that's where all the moisture went? It was also cooked more than the medium rare that I ordered, which I heard many times prior to my meal that this is a consistent problem here. The brioche bun was also dry, and actually cold to the touch when brought out. The foie gras was non-existent except for maybe one or two bites, and the quail egg wasn't noticed at any point. The cherry tomatoes were the only stand out flavor, and it was a travesty when my girlfriend accidentally dropped one when I handed her my burger to sample its dryness. I'm not quite sure what the frizzled onion is, as they weren't noticeable either. 

The fries were even more horrible; raw, soggy, and cold with the taste of raw potatoes. The fat fries were actually fairly hot upon arrival, and even cooked a bit more than our skinny fries, but still not nearly enough to make them edible. The skinny fries with parmesan were literally just fries with a huge clump of shredded parmesan piled on. Also, neither accompanying aioli was brought out initially, only a small cup of ketchup. We had to ask for the items that are supposed to come with the fries, this is an issue I also saw a couple times in their comment book that was handed to us with the bill. The garlic aioli (a redundant statement) tasted more like ranch than anything, the truffle aioli was decent enough to mask the raw potato flavor but still wasn't that great.

If this meal couldn't get any worse, let me tell you about our Groupon deal which is a total scheme on the part of the restaurant. The deal is $49 for supposedly $100 worth of food, and includes two burgers with sides, one shared dessert and one bottle of wine. Once our meal was done and my Groupon was scanned, we were still brought a check for $25.84 which was instantly confusing. On the check they list a $99 (not $100) Groupon meal, sales tax for the full $99 amount and an 18% (!!!) gratuity bringing the total to $124.84. They then subtract $99 for the value of the Groupon (not $100), and expect $25.84 from you to complete the meal. First of all, after doing some research I have found some specific tax laws about this such as: ""if a restaurant offers a patron, upon presentation of a coupon, two meals for the usual price of one, the price of the free meal is excluded from the meal's tax. The tax is due on only the actual amount the restaurant charges the patron."" Meaning that they've charged me more tax than they're legally allowed to! Second of all, I have no problem tipping my waiter on the entire value of our meal as opposed to the Groupon price, but forcing me to pay 18% minimum for two people regardless of my experience is absolutely absurd. A gratuity is 100% optional with all meals; sure it would be a total dick move not to tip a waiter, especially if they've been great, but for this to be a mandatory portion of my bill is absolutely infuriating. So without any choice of my own, my $49 Groupon by default is $74.84, or a clever way for the restaurant to get another $25 out of each Groupon deal. And who knows how much of that 18% actually went to my waiter.

With all that being said, how do I even sum this up? Forgetting about the Groupon for a minute, if I had paid the full price of $100 for this meal I would have been so horribly disappointed that I would not have walked out of there until both of our burgers and fries were replaced with absolutely perfect versions of what we ordered, if this is possible of achieving.  If we had paid just the $49 plus a tip that I deemed appropriate I would still be completely disappointed with this meal as such a claimed gourmet restaurant should be spot on every time, and this clearly wasn't. But now factor in some questionable charges on my bill and you have all the ingredients for a very low score. Horribly overpriced, overcooked, inconsistent burgers, and almost raw, inedible fries served without their proper sides leave me with no choice but to give this an extremely low score and my highest recommendation to stay as far away as you can from this place until they can maybe get their act together. If you're looking for a good night out in Summerlin with some fun food, better atmosphere, and one of the best burgers I've had in Vegas, go to View Wine Bar down the street.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,10,2,1,7snpgvepG71NiJv_tvZx7Q

240857,2013-05-02,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"After reading the previous reviews, and having already purchased the Groupon ($50: 2 burgers, bottle of wine, 2 sides and 1 dessert). I set my expectations to what I read on Yelp, a lack of continuity and commitment to food and service. I was pleasantly surprised that from the moment we walked in, the wait staff strove to welcome us. Seating was not typical... 3 rows of 3 tables/benches that sat 8... communal style in an industrial feel decor. We went at 5:30 with a reservation and were seated immediately and no one else was at our table. Our waiter Oscar, was outstanding, informing us of the items he tried and chatting comfortably, refilling our drinks and checking back with us on a regular basis.

Now to the food- my Angus burger was done perfectly, hot and tasty on a brioche bun with racelette, red pepper and arugula. I ordered the smashed potatoes and was impressed with the crispy outside and soft inside, sprinkled with cayenne pepper, olive oil and thyme and served piping hot (and enough to share). The bottle of wine included was a nice cab, very drinkable and table worthy. My husbands Kobe burger was a plethora of flavors: foie gras, quail egg, tomato and arugula. He enjoyed it thoroughly with his fat fries!

Last course was a anise laced brownie topped with a dollop of peanut butter ice cream with a sweet/salty twist. 

Here's my dilemma... with the Groupon, the meal was fab. If you were to ask me to spend $100 on burgers sitting on a bench, I have to think about it. I gave it 4 stars for my experience this evening and the Groupon pricing.",to-2EIRXGkhV3dWcwnllig,3,1,4,kecAVwRvyyDGOwayPDy5Rw
241544,2013-04-24,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"I left here just feeling so disappointed.  Every negative comment about the place I'd read on Yelp came true, which was a shame because my burger was awesome.

We arrived, there was loads of spare seats and yet were told it would be a 30 minute wait.  This has happened to other reviewers.

We sat down and were immediately offered water, excellent so far.  Unfortunately we didn't see another server for about 15 minutes, again other reviewers have experienced the same thing.

When they took our drinks order it was another really really long wait before our food order was taken, the place wasn't even half full and there were a lot of staff doing not very much.

I had the kobe burger and skinny fries, the burger was excellent although the quails egg could have been done with a runny yolk and the skinny fries were OK, but definitely not hand made.  The parmesan on top cannot disguise this.

Interestingly one of my dining companions had the fat fries, both were advertised as coming with different types of Aioloi, this never materialised.

I think the owner needs to visit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on the Strip, it's cheaper and much much better.",9SDaYP8czOnZ-iTQLuqWgg,2,0,2,tXazp19YEsOBia5S4Hj56w
256251,2013-07-08,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,We thought we would give this place a try since we bought the Groupon.  After hearing how the owner was a Michelin-Star recipient.

350416,2013-04-25,2,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"like others here, we were coerced in with the $99 groupon.  we ordered the kobe and tuna burgers.

the food was good.  not great.  just good.

the cabernet wine was excellent.

i ordered an apple-lime juice.  like many things here, it was pricey at $4 and the portion was on the smallish side, but that didn't keep it from being spectacular -- easily best thing of the night.

but those aren't my problems with poshburger ... but these are:

1. the groupon REQUIRED a reservation.  when i made it, i had to give my name four times.  i spelled it slowly and completely twice.  i had the guy read it back to me.  when we went it, at 18:00, they had no reservation on record.

2. from the moment we sat down, until we walked back out the door, was TWO AND A HALF HOURS.  the company was good, so we just talked and talked and talked.  but this doesn't even qualify as slow.  it's glacial.  being short two servers is not my problem, it's the restaurant's problem -- they need to solve it.

3. we were there during witching hour.  during the exact time of the year that we were there the sun goes directly into the restaurant.  there's no shade or screen or overhang.  the day we were there was perfectly clear and the light was laser beam searing.  EVERY customer in the restaurant was wearing sunglasses.  not having the sun screened is not my problem, it's the restaurant's problem -- they need to solve it.

4. 18% gratuity was automatically added to the bill POST TAX.  ignoring the fact that we essentially didn't have any service of quality, this is completely and totally incorrect.  tip (""to insure promptness"") is calculated BEFORE tax, not after.  you don't pay your servers extra because any given government is taking more out of your pocket.  [we DID pay the 18%, but made it a point to stop and tell the management that our service was abysmally slow as we left -- of course we had to spend several minutes tracking someone down.]

5. they act a little bit snooty here -- certainly without service reason -- so i add this solely as a kicker, not that i actually think it means anything ... when we sat at the table, there were new/unlit candles in front of us.  the floor manager was being uppity about the wine so i pointed out that unlit candles are actually an etiquette faux pas ... they should have burned before set on the table.  ""who says that?  i've never heard that!""  ""the same people who say it's polite to say 'please' and 'thank you.'""  (i've heard that it actually goes back to victorian times when some people had electricity and others didn't ... you burned wicks so you weren't putting your electric usage in other people's face.)

i won't be back.  as i write this review, i realize i'm sorry that i didn't challenge the tacked-on service fee.  my experience was probably worse than the average client's, but my advice is to be very suspicious of any 5* reviews here.",xrNxg9m5v_IvOvIqF74d4w,6,2,2,cRgx_uHBwMvOjwUcqnUv0w

We  finished off with the summer berry cobbler- it consisted of strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. Great combo. After the meal the chef came out and asked what we thought.

My girlfriend and i went to poshburger tonight for the first (and last) time. Restauraunt was about 25% full and After seating us, they took an inordinate amount of time to acknowledge us and take a drink order... We also ordered our entrees which were EXACTLY the same: kobe burger, medium rare, fries, and my GF ordered one of their raw juices. The server did the old ""not write anything down"" bit... Shortly after, he disappeared and some girl took his place. Compliments of the house we got some small salmon appetizer thing (one bite really) & it was interesting... Two burgers then came out. Mine was right, hers was not. How two identically ordered burgers can differ i do not know. Also, no juice, and no fries. We immediately pointed this out to the server who said ""yeah, things are.... You know"" as she moved her hands around in the air.... I also asked her for a side of mayo and ketchup for my burger... She disappeared for a while and returned to ask me again what kind of fries i wanted.. I watched her then move about the restaurant making to separate trips to the kitchen window without getting my condiments as my burger kept getting colder... I of course didn't want to eat while my GF was still waiting on her food and sat there with nothing other than a growing disdain. The fancy dressed manager stopped to refill our glasses with pelegrino but made no comment of the lack of food for her or asked why i wasn't eating. He asked if we'd like another bottle of pelegrino and with contempt i told him that we were leaving... Then this guy actually says, ""i understand."" For real? 
It's really a shame because this place and it's menu appear to have something interesting going on... But right now this place is a joke.

I had Parmesan truffle fries as the side - and OMG. I could not stop eating them! The calamari for starters was delish, as well. I look forward to going back and making my way through all of the burgers. Next on my list? The Kobe burger. 
I feed my son an all-natural diet - and there were no concerns here. The meat is all free-range and grass-fed - no nitrates or antibiotics.

We waited a total of about 1 hour for a table. . 

The bartender was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. She informed us that the meat was brought in daily and ground in-store. That was exciting news for us to hear. 

The service was OK, one server was irritated with the other server that didn't know how to ""work under pressure."" and his etiquette was not necessarily appreciated.  I asked for my Caesar dressing on the side of my Baby Caesar salad, and never got it and I also noticed that my croutons were burnt :(   When asked for a recommendation for a dessert, he stated ""the creme brulee is a little runny today, so I wouldn't get that."" It just seemed like he presented it in a negative light. So we ended up getting the apple cobbler. It was really sweet and there was not enough crumbles! But it was tasty.

As for the communal seating- I think it is less romantic when there is someone other group of people sitting right next to you. It's kind of a little awkward. The ambiance of Poshburger made me think of being at an empty butcher shop with tables to serve people. 

The food, to be completely honest, I would not pay $29 for their Kobe burger. It was good, I ordered it medium and got it medium, the patty was small (I definitely expected a bigger patty) and tender. The bf got the Venison burger.

All I have to say is what is this owner thinking?  Yes you are in Summerlin, but if you do not make changes soon you won't be here much longer.",6WaFlZxILBkPG3bmGICcRg,10,0,1,-qwkiggOqdcWWjBB5vluRw

We were seated quickly, but then had to wait for the waitress to come for our drink orders. We both decided to try one of the juices that they offer (which were different, but nice). It took a while for her to return to take our dinner order.  Once she did, I had asked her about the black angus burger, she tried to talk me out of it, because she didn't care for the hummus on it and suggested I do the build a burger.  I ended up ordering that black angus burger and my boyfriend ordered the venison burger, both medium well.  We were told it would take approx 15 minutes ..in the meantime, while looking around the room, I noticed the manager over at the bar drinking wine in the corner.  By the time the food came out, and I cut into my burger, bloody juice ran all over the plate, it was more rare in the middle and not cooked as ordered. I had to send it back.  When it came back, to me the burger was so dry it was like sawdust and the bun was soaked with all the juice from the plate. It was so soggy it was unedible.  I said something to the waitress and the manager then came over. He said he spoke to the chef but never apologized or offered to pay for the meal since I couldn't eat it.  I will NOT return there and would NOT recommend it to anyone.  After that experience, I will be surprised if it lasts longer than another 3 months.",99ptCa-28lQ8lS6TV8zCKw,0,0,1,4eQU8fQk-Q6EWipmuOuhGw

2468724,2013-04-30,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"The burgers sound so good on the menu, but are only executed at an OK - good level.

I bought a Groupon here when they still had a 4 star rating on Yelp.  I am with the Yelpers since that have lowered the score.  Even for the Groupon price the meal was a little underwhelming...If I had paid full price?...yikes 2 or 2.5 stars at best.  I settled on three here since I used the Groupon and just saw another round of Groupons.

When I order a burger from a self-acclaimed gourmet burger establishment they need to nail the cooking temp...meadium-rare is not the same thing as medium.  Simply put, get it right!  I order the Posh Kobe Burger.  The burger comes with foie gras and a pair of fried quail eggs.  These are nice toppings and done well.  The patty itself though was less than average as any kind of grass-fed kobe patty goes.

I also tried the venison burger.  This burger was not exceptionally balanced with its toppings and as a result was on the sweet side.  I like the idea of a cranberry relish, bearnaise sauce, and roasted red peppers with venison...a little sweetness plays wonderfully.  It was just too sweet and wasn't  in harmony.

The Crushed Potatoes are a solid side with great flavor, though perhaps not technically ""crushed potatoes.""  That being said one of the best thing I ate here was the Caesar Salad.  They do a great homemade Caesar dressing here.  It was applied a little too generously for my liking however.  We finished our meal off with the some Pistachio Ice Cream atop a Bitter-Chocolate Cake.  The Ice Cream was tasty and the cake was fine, but nothing I'm running back for.

The bottom line is that there are better burgers in town at the same price...and the execution at Posh Burger Bistro is a little off on top of that.

If I came back I would try the Wild Boar Burger!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,10,1,3,bwiZDyvb56ads0BbXokDfQ

3251256,2013-05-24,6,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"Well its been a month since I've been here.  I figured Poshburger would've read reviews and fixed things.  After all, the owner is a Michelin-Star recipient...right???  That's all that I've read in all their PR.

I was REALLY hoping that the 2nd time around would result in a 5-star rating!!!! 

Well, the two stars is basically based on great service from our server Sandra.  A very pretty Austrian gal who was the perfect blend of attentive-but-give-you-room-to-breathe server.

I came with a buddy and we each ordered the Kobe.  This was my 2nd time trying this burger.  This time the foie gras was healthy-sized and it came to our table very attractively.  The couple to the next of us (uncomfortable due to the picnic tables) gawked at our burgers.  It looked great!!!

Unfortunately, the burgers...again....came over-cooked.  I cut my burger in half and started eating.  I finished half of my burger when Sandra came around and checked on us.  I asked her whether my other half looked Medium-Rare and she said absolutely not.  She asked if I wanted a new burger and I said no....even thought the burger was very dry.  She asked again but I honestly didn't want to wait.  I did, however, appreciate her sincere concern.  Plus she was so pretty when she asked.  Haha.

The bun was so big in relation to the burger that I just removed the top bun.  My plate ended up as a big mess of overcooked burger and thick bread.  Sandra wasn't even sure whether my plate was ready to be cleared.

I ordered the onion rings as a side  which was horrible.  Note to Michelin-Star chef...If you put onion rings inside a cone container, the rings will continue to cook in the steam and get soggy and the breading will fall off the onions!!!!  Any other decent restaurant that I've enjoyed good onion rings understands this and serves them open to allow the batter to adhere to the onions.  

Rocket science???  Poor understanding of Cooking 101???  Or an ""I don't give a shit"" attitude that's apparent in every other aspect of this restaurant??? 

The restaurant was not very busy and I would be very surprised to see Posh remain open for long.  

On a side note...I personally would've comped something for the admittedly overcooked burger.  A glass of wine.  A dessert.  A side.  Something!!!  The owner was there in the kitchen.  He clearly doesn't give a rat's ass.

The best description I have for this place is: CONFUSED.  

- We are high end and we will charge $29 per burger but we will have casual picnic tables for you party.

- We will operate in a Smith's Grocery Strip Mall in a suburban neighborhood full of families but we will remain dimly lit and without a family-friendly atmosphere.

I will never return to Poshburger.  There are way too many good burger options in Vegas.  

I really wish Gordon Ramsay could walk into this restaurant and give his 2-cents.  He would drop F-Bombs left and right because the owner is clearly blind to their actual clientele.  And if Gordon Ramsay saw the overcooked ""medium rare"" Kobe burger that I was delivered, he would throw it in the owner's face and say ""Aw c'mon you wanker, how can a fucking Michelin-Star chef burn a good piece of meat like this.  Especially when there are only 10 other customers in the restaurant!!!!""

Good luck to anybody else who dares to waste their money at Poshburger,",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,7,5,2,SGrhWD6vCED0bwE0dakbWA
3592471,2013-05-08,1,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"I am always delighted when I'm out-and-about and I spot a new restaurant, I spend the next few days trying to find an excuse to drag someone with me to check it out. When I first noticed Poshburger, I only caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, just enough to see it was a burger joint. A few days later I contacted my burger-loving buddy and we headed out to give it a try.

The restaurant itself is oddly arranged, feeling more like a church lunchroom than a burger joint (albeit a classy burger joint). The tables are all 8 toppers, so come prepared to make a new friend, plus they have a bar, which suited the two of us just fine.

The bartender was a pleasant mix of delightful and terrified, after all he was a little wet behind the ears. Though I was thoroughly impressed with his singular focus when asked for a recommendation (too many servers approach recommendations with the confidence of a lemming), to which he unabashedly replied ""The wild boar burger, definitely.""

My buddy decided to order a simple make-it-yourself cheeseburger, claiming it's the only true way to judge a burger joint. I of course, went with our young barman's confident recommendation, because I believe the best way to judge any restaurant is to let the chef blow you away with their signature dish - mine also came with an order of fries (but I'll get to that later).

One thing you should know about me, I always like cheese, ketchup and mustard on my burgers. I will add other ingredients from time to time, but those three are a staple. The wild boar burger (chef special) came with no cheese, ketchup or mustard, but I didn't even notice these were missing until I was almost finished - and I didn't even miss 'em. The burger was incredibly juicy, leaving a savory pool on the plate and I dipped into it like an au jus until there was not a drop left. I did feel it could it have used a bit more seasoning, so I added some salt about half-way through which made it even tastier (note to self: add salt right away next time). Though it was wild, it lacked any of that wild taste that usually accompanies boar. All-in-all, it was probably the first burger without my three staples I ever truly enjoyed.

Now for the fries. Being a good Yelper (please Misty, I'm trying to be a good Yelper  ) we read a few reviews as we waited for our meals (and a check-in which I am usually reluctant to do anytime). From these we learned that the fries have been a point of contention with some of the other Yelpers, mostly that they still taste frozen. When they arrived I had to agree, although I can't say that the advance notice didn't taint my perception a bit. 

For whatever reason (probably my big mouth), we were suddenly sent out another order of fries with no explanation. Of course, after one bite of this new batch I was baffled, they actually tasted great, I mean really, really good. It was the manager that informed us later that the chef had hand-cut a batch just for us, based, I'm guessing, on my comments. Turns out they were trying to see if we would notice the difference - boy did we. 

In my opinion, Poshburger is a refreshing, fabulous new concept that I am proudly giving the full five stars. --- Just don't be afraid to ask for hand-cut fries, you'll thank me.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,3,1,5,l8dokYjFJfkJKhn948FRcg
3616125,2013-05-27,3,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"This restaurant may be the single worst run restaurant I have ever encountered.  Due to the circumstances of our ""reservation"", we were unable to dine at the restaurant.  The Groupon is a total scam and makes it virtually impossible to dine here...

Firstly, let me explain that we attempted to dine here on 3 separate occasions.  We had the Groupon that had been offered online and thus mentioned it when attempting to make a reservation.  We were initially told that they were at their ""Groupon maximum"" for that evening and would be unable to take our reservation.

Later in the week we contacted them again to make a reservation ahead of time for the following evening.  When we called we were told by a gentleman that we didn't need a reservation for the Groupon and could dine at any time.  When we attempted to still put our names down, they instructed us to ""not worry about it"". 

The following day we decided we would be better off trying to make a reservation, so we called yet again.  A gentleman answered the phone and we set a reservation with him for 7:30 that evening, mentioning our Groupon during the reservation process.

Now this is when it all came off the rails...  That night we arrived promptly at 7:25 for our scheduled reservation to an almost empty restaurant.  We approached the hostess to check in, but were told that there was no reservation on the books and that the Groupon was not being honored due to the fact that the wine for the offer was unavailable.  She said she could still seat us, but we only had the option to either dine at full price or get the food associated with the Groupon and come back to get our wine on Tuesday!!!  I was appalled.  They would not make a substitution or exception based on their numerous errors. I asked to speak to the manager and was instructed that there was no manager, just an owner, and he was unavailable that evening.  I have worked in restaurants/hospitality for many years and have never experienced such a thing.  There were only three tables seated (an almost empty restaurant) yet out of 5 servers, 2 bartenders, and a hostess, no one on staff had the authority to actually address an issue that had arisen.  How do you expect to run a restaurant with no one with any authority?!?!?  We left upset and hungry and went to eat somewhere else...

Funny thing is that we apparently are not the only people to run into horrendous issues.  A search online regarding PoshBurger and the Groupon revealed that this is just one of many horrible experiences, which include inflated tax and gratuity on the bill, terrible food, and horrible service.  In hindsight, I have never been so happy to NOT have dined at a restaurant.  Stay far away from this establishment and do not support their ownership (if you can even find the restaurant in the first place).  They apparently don't pay employees, jack up prices, and don't honor their own promotions...",s6-lvb7GP4V5nmtifzyT8A,12,0,1,OiVtTVQxCDsFtcX_Oq303g
3833975,2013-06-21,0,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"After reading the Groupon reviews I was a bit worried.  We called and got a reservation for that night.  It is definitely a boutique wine and beer joint.  I am not a fan of Malbecs in general, but the one they substituted for the Groupon wine Gar?on was a $ !7.00 bottle and most impressive.  We enjoyed the calamari appetizer.  The Brioche buns were so delicious they made me eat way more  bread than I was planning on.  I was disappointed to find they were out of Tuna Tartar.  The Kobe burger(medium rare) was so fab we will be going back to try some of the other burgers and to try the tuna.  My husband had the fries with garlic aolie and he loved them.  I had the baby caesar which was delicious!!  We shared the Chocolate Fondant with peanut butter ice cream.  OMG it was so good.  Yes a bit pricey, but this is no burger joint this was a gourmet Bistro that has a very limited menu.  I am very excited to go back for the sliders to try several different burgers.  Let the chef do the topping or don't go.  He is an artist.

We also enjoyed sharing a table with others.  This is very common in other countries and it certainly promotes conversation beyond the relationship you have with your phone.  This is a place to dine.  The decor isn't formal, but plan on leaving your phone in your pocket and your elitist attitude behind.  You do not know better than this chef and his staff how you like it.",5HjilK4MaY1XGzhx6EWzLQ,1,0,5,Wo-tiML060Zaq6vOmb7nvg

I think I can release this now.  There are two doors but you must enter the left one because the hostess stand is there, and the right is locked.  Greeted by two hostess, sat down at the ""power seat"" of the house.  I had a view of everything, I believe it was table 8, seat 9.  The server, Alison or Ally, approached me and I can tell how inexperienced she was.  Felt like a diner service rather than a place that sells (on the face of it) overpriced burgers.  She doesn't tell me her name, I found out her name after shift change but she asks if I wanted anything to drink.  I pointed to the raw juice section on the menu when she tells me they didn't have any.  Blah, but ordered an IPA beer.

I asked if they were able to sample the dishes and she said no, but she did sample the drinks and I think dessert.  I asked what kind of Kobe Beef was used and she gave me a are you kidding me with that question look, had to explain that it could either be Japanese, Australian, or American.  But she goes and asks the chef and comes back to tell me it's American.  I ordered it, MEDIUM RARE, and had a side of crushed potatoes.

My Kobe Burger comes and when I go to cut it, it doesn't cut as smooth as I thought it would.  It was a bit past medium, I showed my server and Candance, part owner or wife of Chef Conrad, and she too can see it wasn't medium rare.  Usually I send it back but I kept it and ate it, not going to waste this dish.  The foie gras itself was good, if it wasn't for the foie gras my burger would have been dry.  If you cut your burger in half, be sure to cut it half through the foie gras so it divides evenly.  The pair of fried quail egg still had some runny yolk to it so I loved that part too and the tomatoes were fresh.  But it didn't make up for the main event being almost well done.

The ""crushed"" potatoes aren't crushed but small potatoes cut in half and seasoned with thyme, cayenne, and oil.  I loved the taste but it wasn't crushed.

Fast forward to my actual meal on Grand Opening.

For appetizer I ordered the tomato buffalo mozzarella, for anyone who knows me know that I eat at Parma right down the street.  I've had Bufala on my pizza when they had Pizza Wednesdays and this was Bufala mozzarella.  Unfortunately my server does not know what a tomato caprese is so when she explained to me the dish she made it sound like it was a green leafy salad.  Then when it was ready, the food runner brought it to a different table and set it down.  She picked it back up and told the old lady Just Kidding! and brings it to me and tells me she didn't touch it so it's fine.  Ugh what?  I witnessed everything so I know.

What I did witness though about health issues is there's an exit door at the kitchen, next to a sink.  Some of the people who entered into the kitchen from the exit door didn't wash their hands.  I mean, commeeeeee onnnnnnnn.  You're outside and all of a sudden you start working on stuff in the kitchen?  I mean if you're delivering items then drop it off and go but don't handle food.  The executive sous chef wore plastic gloves, I think he was the only one too but others could learn from that practice.  

Anyway, everyone's back is facing the customers so it took me 10 mins to flag someone down until Candace saw me and came over to assist.  I ordered what was probably my favorite beer there so far, the Devastator!  It's a dark beer but fit well with my burger.  Daniel brought it out to me and he was cool, had and held good conversations with him only because he knew what the hell was going on.  Sorry servers, I didn't even need to look at the menu a second time to order the beer or appetizer.  Eventually they'll get better, especially as they get more experience and see more of the different dishes.  Both times Allison had to come back to me after putting in the order on the machine thingy to ask how I wanted my burger cooked and what side I wanted.  

My main course was the Wild Boar Burger.  This was actually perfect.  The bun did not have the oily brush like my Kobe Burger but the second I cut through the wild boar burger it split like the Red Sea and came crashing back down.  My Kobe Beef stayed apart, stiff like a board and not cooked the way I wanted it.  Good bye all that fat I crave for.  The Boar Burger was not bad at all, I can tell this wasn't the first time this was made but my Kobe Beef Burger... maybe I was the first one to get it?

The side I choose with this was the Skinny Fries.  They were skinny and topped with shredded Parmesan, good enough for me! 

The dessert I had was the upside down mango cheesecake.  The menu mentions sorbet but it was more like mango gelatin, topping was great.  5000 character limit, PEACE!",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,19,4,2,R2p_nVS4BcbruvTrUx0sIw

That being said, I understand that when you open a new concept, it takes some time to ""work out the kinks"". So I get it. What I don't get is, how does a great concept fall so short for me after the ""kinks"" should have worked their way out. Maybe because it was fight-night (Mayweather) tonight... so maybe they sent staff home to save labor. But when we walked in, there was only two tables in the entire restaurant. A 2 and a 3 top. I walked up to the kitchen pass (nice open kitchen pass) to see how the kitchen was set up. Small but I am sure it does the job. So lets get seated.... server was running the lines as if he was a robot verbatim- I would think, with the concept, that he would talk about the chef, or concept in general... nope. Just ""todays specials are... etc..."". We ordered the elk sliders to start ($24). And quickly put in our entrees too. Venison burger (medium) and turkey burger. After about a 30 minute wait, the server came to the table and said ""sorry but the kitchen is taking a long time tonight..."". I will say, looking into the kitchen, yes they moved extremely sluggish. Regardless, the food came out shortly after. But not before I saw my server eating a fallen french fry that fell off and onto the plate. Eating fries at the pass. In an open kitchen?! Really? My biggest fuss about the food was that none of the burgers were seasoned. At all. I asked for salt to continue eating. So plain. Definitely not the ""best burger"" in town. So 2 guests. 1 appetizer, 2 burgers- $75. I will come back to give it another chance but not anytime soon.

The food was very tasty as well. Started with the guac which easily landed in my top 3 guacs ever. The chips were served warm and crispy and whole(no crumbles or partial chips shows attention to detail). They didn't quite provide enough chips but were happy to bring us some extras when we asked. The next course came too quickly and was a the arugula salad. Very fresh ingredients and tasty. I think possibly the best crouton ever, goat cheese on top. I think there could've been a bit more of a punch (possibly some balsamic) involved in the whole salad. The veggie burger again came out too quick and kind of felt like they were trying to rush us through each course while I was sitting there savoring the flavors. I think it could've served them better to let the burgers sit under the warmer until I finished the salad. By the time I got to the burger it was cold-ish and I know the flavor would've been more appealing if it was warm. The brioche they served the burger on was fantastic and definitely the highlight of the dish. Their deserts were very rich. The fondant was great. I wish the brownie was a bit warm as it would've gone great with the ice cream it was served with. 

Another issue I had was I couldn't understand what occasion I would go there for. The seats were just a bit too far apart for a date. It was a bit pricier than a family place should be. It was still great overall with the decor, and they were still testing out the lighting so it changed halfway through our meal.

I have eaten at PoshBurger Bistro on 4 separate occasions and with thanks to Chef Conrad and the American Wild Boar - I freaking love the Wild Boar burger.

A suggestion is to add a quail egg to your burger - it adds some milky goodness.

But frankly I've been here with a different person every time and everyone has always left happy.

The guac is a good appetizer, but the buffalo wings are some of the very best around.  The thing I like best about the wings is how he trims the bottoms of the little drumsticks - you just have to try them!!!

Kobe burgers good, osterich - I haven't tried, but I hear it's amazing.

I think some people go here to find a Burger Joint like the cafe in Back to the Future - some of the reviews I read make me think this - It is an excellent restaurant to the Burger connoisseur.

My father and uncle own Burger Kings - this is clearly the opposite end of the burger spectrum.

I had very high expectations...but I was pretty disappointed truthfully 

Little things like the Raw Juices not working yet is acceptable as initial growing pains....Them not having highchairs or boosters for my little foodie dude...borderline acceptable...these things will be fixed in due time.

But a medium rare burger should not be difficult to achieve...especially if it isn't busy out front! The first bite...a well done burger. I sent it back, with apologies from the server and a manager intro. The manager said she would personally check up on the next burger, and to make sure it was done correctly the second time around.  Kobe burger :

First bite into the second burger...well done again. Are you serious? Well done, as in cooked 100% throughout. Not a hint of pink at all...the same as the first time. My company was already pretty much done with theirs, and we were running out of time, so I wasn't going to bother sending it back. The server checked on the second burger, saw it was overcooked again, and said she would get the manager.

Meals over...no manager. We get asked for dessert, we decline, and the check comes over....no manager, no discount, no mention about the poor cooking. I pay and get outta there...still no manager chasing me out the door to double check everything, especially being notified of the second time around. 

Keep in mind, this was a $30 hamburger. This is their top tier, most expensive plate they sell....they should be able to cook it right, especially after two tries. And for $30, I got meat that I couldn't tell was Kobe, Waygu, or Sirloin because it was overcooked. The foie gras was a sliver...about an inch wide, that didn't even cover half of the burger.

The quail egg was great...but small of course. It covered the half of the burger that had no foie gras....It's a $30 burger!! I don't want a half/half burger, but I guess that is what they are going for. There other burgers are probably fine...just don't waste your money on their Kobe burger!

Also, one other small rant....the dips were way too small! We got one small glass bowl that was about halfway filled up...for each set of fry!  Pic of the fries :

I was afraid to ask for more, since it probably would have carried a $2 price tag, so I tried to spread the love out. Fill up the entire glass, or offer two with each fry!

The tuna tartar burger was good though!

Very light and refreshing with the asian slaw and wasabi aioli!  I love wasabi, so I kind of wish they went heavier on it, but we know others wouldn't like it that way! The tuna was cooked well, and had a nice consistency...not falling apart or overcooked.

With all that being said, the Kobe burger itself was great tasting, just felt like it should have been a whole lot closer to $18-20 than the $30 price tag.  

I never mind spending good money for a good burger...but double the size of the foie gras to compete with the other gourmet burger spots in town, or you won't last long selling them for the same money.  The flavor IS there, just cook it correctly, and give your paying customers a fair amount of topping...we are paying enough money for it.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,22,6,2,IBEspkwWJn3TgefP1ZtbFQ

Food was as bad, actually worse when you factor in the price. My burger came with onion rings...4 of them. They were the frozen ones you'd expect at any chain restaurant and inexplicably they came out 5 mins before the burger.

I tried the lamb burger. It was supposed to be medium but was well done. I cut it in half and the next thing I know my plate was swimming in water, the untoasted potato bun was soggy and limp, and the burger was dry. Toppings on the burger were feta and guacamole. I must have missed the guacamole when I saw it on the menu otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it. I love guacamole but it has no place on a lamb burger mixed in with feta cheese.

Definitely not going back, especially since 2 minutes in either direction I can be at LBS, Bachi Burger, or Smashburger.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,12,0,1,tqzeud55LqHjysDisJBMSQ

When we chose our meals, he made sure we knew about the temperatures for our meat choices and was very informative. 

The food was awesome. I can't remember having a better wild boar. The skinny fries were good and the calamari was good. 

The place had a few patrons with people arriving to pick up to go orders. The prices where good. All in all I enjoyed my visit and I think I will be returning this weekend.

Also reading the other reviews, I saw that they appear to be from ex-employees. I realy enjoyed the place, food was great, wine was great. They even allowed us to taste it before we purchased (We are not wine people).",9HZSqrJhVZkjJxKVaOICbg,2,1,4,-5pf2nVsMHKFMhAeEuHCiQ
5959838,2013-04-23,3,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"Reading all the reviews about this place, I was cautiously optimistic about our meal here. I purchased the Groupon for this location. I came with my fella and our friends for a nice evening out and thought it would be a great opportunity to share the bottle of wine. 

I made reservations and we arrived at 7 on the dot on Saturday evening for our dinner reservation. The table layouts weren't my favorite. Large bench seating where we ended up sharing a table with another couple. I would expect this at a lower end restaurant but when you're paying $30 for a burger, I was kind of hoping for a table on our own. Every move the couple next to us made or word they spoke, I heard or felt it and it became a little annoying as the evening wore on. 

That being said, I did enjoy our meal quite a bit, despite the same problems everyone else seems to have had with getting a medium or medium-rare burger. Both my friend and myself ordered the kobe and he specifically asked for medium-rare while I asked for medium and they both came out looking exactly the same. Cooked all the way through with no pink in the middle. I can't complain too much since the burger was still extremely moist and flavorful. My other friend ordered the angus and it accidentally came out with cheese on it even though she didn't order it that way. We told the waiter and he apologized and took it back. He brought back her burger with no cheese on it but she noticed that they had just scraped the cheese off instead of making her a new burger. She wasn't too annoyed but it didn't sit well with any of us. The fries and onion rings we ordered were nothing special. They lacked flavor and texture. They definitely could use more seasoning. For dessert my fella and I shared the mango cheesecake which was served in a glass. The flavor was great. The brownie dessert my friends shared didn't impress them too much, but I didn't get to taste that so can't comment on it.

The service was friendly and attentive. On a few occasions, the waiter forgot to get us some extra napkins and refills on water, but overall the service was good. I don't see myself going out of my way to come back, but we did have a good meal and would love to come back if they offered another coupon. If I had not had the Groupon our meal would have been well over $160 for three burgers, a side of fries, a side of onion rings, an order of buffalo wings, a bottle of wine and two desserts. 

Overall, we had a nice meal with a few minor blips.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,4,3,_FKVAES2PdrFd1G5wcjmxg
5978150,2013-04-29,1,sIr0Wp13Z_MqwgcNvF-5ew,"First off let me start off by saying the other bad reviewers for this joint clearly do not understand a good burger as they are probably used to living off McDonald's and have developed a taste for crap. This place was great, we purchased a groupon and man I'm so glad I didn't trust the bad reviews! Kobe and the wild boar burgers were amazing! The house chosen cab was great too, good choice Mark! To finish we had an apple cobbler, was good but didn't compete with the juicy burger I engulfed before. Ambiance wasn't the best, however, they are still new and more changes are coming. We will hands down return.",UQdRQVYIHkyqO0zU2WY3Yg,2,2,5,TCt9uUcXczZJ4M3kYG-R9A
