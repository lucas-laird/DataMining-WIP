In town for a last minute wedding and since only staying for one night, we figured this place would be okay. 

The casino is TINY and to say it is smokey is an understatement.   I honestly think the restaurant is larger than the gaming area.  Hard to play slots when older people are playing two or three machines at the same time.

Upon checking in, we were told all of the rooms have new mattresses.  They might be new, but they are HORRIBLE.   Honestly,  the floor has more padding under the horribly stained carpet.

In room bathrooms are tiny. Ironic that they are tiny,  because instead of toilet paper holder being next to toilet, it is on the opposite wall.  But hey, at least you get your morning stretching done while reaching for toilet paper.

Taking a shower is scary.
Water temperature level is a choice of slowly boil your flesh off or instantly boil your flesh off.  I didn't even try to bathe my 9 month old son out of fear of causing serious injury.   

Our room was on the backside of the hotel and I was kept awake most of the night by a fight in the neighborhood which is a stone's throw away.

We went for the $5.99 steak dinner special.  Several of us were enticed by the $9.99 steak and petite lobster tail dinner.  Well, terrible is the best way to describe it.  The petite lobster tails were a joke.  They were honestly the size of a small to medium shrimp, but we really weren't expecting much.  The bigger problems were the steaks.  Every steak at our table (there were 6) were practically inedible.  Tough, grizzly, chewy, just disgusting.  The baked potatos were good, as were the rolls.  The rolls were actually great, definately the highlight of the whole meal.  The service was good.  However, we had to wait about an hour and 15 mins for a table for 7.  The place is really tiny, and when multiple tables opened up together we were told the manager didn't want to put tables together.  We had to wait for the only large party to leave.  Really ridiculous!

I seriously doubt this was just an 'off night'.  None of us expected much for a $6 steak dinner, but this was just terrible.  Definately not worth going ever again!",2yiPWn8Xeokc8fjJ1eomkg,5,0,1,bAkAuxjcE_zosvJlvpQArQ

From outside this place might look like a seedy low budget casino and motel, and I pretty much didn't have a choice since it is one of the few pet friendly affordable hotels in town, but once we've been here for a couple days we realized DIS PLACE IS DA MUTHAFUCKIN SHIZNIT!  First floor easy access to parking, free coffee, free drink, friendly and helpful staff as well as security! They even offered to shuffle me a new 6 deck of cards when I was taking beating at the blackjack table!  Ya know, I went to the strip earlier tonight and realized that those big fake phony flashy casinos are pure fucking vile corporate BULLSHIT that literally piped the worst & most poisonous music to the soul into every corner of their casino including the parking lot, I mean we were there for an hour and i couldn't  wait to get the fuck out and back to my good ole' LONGHORN CASINO!! This place feels like home! now I'm typing this as I am having a nice conversation with the sweet southern lady server with a nice smile at the BOMBEST quaint little coffee shop with a country style down home comfort food vibe!  In my opinion this place is reminiscent of how Las Vegas used to be and how it can be again just like the entire world on every other level (once you get rid of all the corporate douchebag scum!) This place may be a little warn down and rusty, but this is the place I'm happy to call home for the next two weeks on my business trip! I think people should make more of an effort to support
Small business like this, that aim to please and are happy doing business with their customers verses evil corporate empires that don't give a single flying fuck about you! But instead, everyone is just looking for something else to complain about when they should be appreciating the good things that they have right in front of them! If places like this don't receive support from their local communities they go away, and that's a bad thing!  #longlivelonghorn",ZBS_SA9G7Xo1QwfqTmu6oQ,2,1,5,RbpnsukFQwT5CdZD-jHPBQ

Checking out other reviews before pulling up had me worried that it might not be the best choice but we were exhausted so the search was over. I have to say that once we pulled up the parking lot did look sketchy and come to find out someone tried to steal our gas.  When we walk in I'm like damn did we make a mistake comming here!? The entrance reeked of cigarette smoke because the casino opening was close and the receptionist didn't even acknowledge us as we walked in. So I say HEeeeLLOooo to get their attention and we check in....now mind you I'm already feeling some type of way about this spot, so I'm trippin on what's to come when we get to the room. We take the elevator to the 2nd floor which is a non smoking area, I don't know what that other person was talking about it smelling like cigarette smoke. I was a little impressed at how fresh and clean it smelled and mind you it was way past midnight already. 
THE ROOM......very impressive, it looked very updated and well kept, the bathroom and shower weren't bad either, the bed and pillows were super comfy too and that's what was most important at this point.
THE CASINO.....don't gamble, plus I can't stand cigarette smoke but we did go down to the bar for our complementary drinks.
RESTURANT......I was not impressed at all, the staff at this joint all seem to have the bad habit of not making eye contact and acknowledging a guest when they walk up, failing to realize they are a representative of this establishment but we were hungry so we ate there just kept it simple. I had their house chili and the bf had a grilled cheese n fries. The prices were reasonable, but the food was very simple and cheaply made. Don't think we'd eat there again.

It's a small, hole-in-the-wall casino, and if you're a blackjack player like myself, you're always seeking the best bank for your buck at the table.  With that said, the rules are ungodly good for the player.  Naturally a 3-2 payout on BJs (which I like a lot of those), but you always get to double down on the third card your receive AND you get even more money when your Blackjacks are suited.

I've been wanting to try their blackjack tournament for awhile now and finally got the chance this past week. They have a blackjack tournament everyday at noon except Monday's. It's a $10 buy in on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, and $20 on Thursday and Saturday. It's cheap entertainment and most of the people here are locals. The dealers are friendly and welcoming. There are only 3 blackjack tables here and with $2 minimums you can't beat the price. 

The restaurant here, the Chuck Wagon, is very good and the prices very reasonable. I've had the Cobb salad (can we say HUGE!), Cajun prime rib and the Reuben here and have been impressed with the quality and taste.

Only really big downside is that the walls are paper thin. I've invested in a good portable white noise machine specifically for places like this though, where the room is good and the only problem is Neighbor Noise due to construction issues they can't control.

This is an absolutely no frills hotel. You get the bare minimum but you get a bare minimum price as well. My overall experience was, meh. 

The hotel from the outside looks rundown and is pretty dirty. It reeks of trash and urine in the back. There are plenty of people hanging around that aren't staying in the hotel. It's obviously frequented by locals. For those of you that are the scary/skittish type, this may not be the place for you. There is a heavy security presence though and they do walk the floors. 

Upon entering, the front desk staff was very friendly and efficient. My wait was only about 5 minutes and once I got to the counter I was checked in in about 5 minutes. 

I got to my room and it was decent. The pros: it was fairly clean and fortunately it didn't smell as bad as the casino and hallways. The bed was sufficiently comfortable. The AC worked well and I was able to get a good night's sleep. It had a decent amount of space and we weren't cramped (my dad, daughter, and myself). 
The cons: the HD TV gets a fuzzy analog signal, there's no iron in the room, there are hardly any electrical outlets to plug things into like chargers, the pillows sucked, and the blackout drapes have light leakage on the sides so you don't really get the 'blackout' effect. 

Overall I feel as if I got what I paid for, a decent, minimalist room with a comfortable bed and a hot shower. The outside sucks but once in the room you don't feel as if you're in a dump anymore. I gave it 2 stars because last year I stayed at the Main Street Hotel in downtown Vegas and gave it 3 stars. I can't in good conscience give the Longhorn the same rating. 
Would I stay here again? Yes. For the price, I'm ok with it all. Could it be better? Absolutely, but I guess you get what you pay for.",ANSGdQLjTHYqagEo4NNb3g,6,1,2,ORQ4ERIQ-T_OVfIRlHSDxw

We've been to Longhorn many times, and we usually have a great time, $2 blackjack with the loosest rules ever?  Awesome.

I'm just getting home from the worst experience I've ever had at this place, arguably the worst experience in my 27 years in Vegas ever.

We rolled in there with a group of 6, played some blackjack and all lost our asses (can't blame them for that, it's the luck of the draw),and then went to end our night at the restaurant.  I had to use the restroom so my friends went ahead and got a table...I walked in right as the waiter was finishing up taking everyone's food order.  
I asked him what the specials were, he told me, and I told him to give me a minute.  

I proceeded to sit there for 30 MINUTES.  I asked the other server there (brunette wearing a red shirt) if I could order some food.  She told me very rudely that she wasn't my server but she would let our waiter know.  Once our server (black male with shaved head) delivered everyone else's food, AND STILL DIDN'T ASK ME WHAT I WANTED TO ORDER, I said screw it, I'm going back to play more blackjack.

After I lost more money in a matter of a few minutes, I went back to join my friends at the restaurant, still hoping I could get some food.  I sat there for another 15-20 minutes, watching my friends eat, and making constant eye contact with every employee I saw while I watched them serve multiple tables.  FINALLY when our waiter brought the check, he asked me if I needed anything.  I responded with ""I don't want to order food now, all my friends are done eating and they want to leave"".  You would have thought I was that dude's worst enemy.  He gave me a dirty look and responded ""I asked you a long time ago"" (bullshit) , and ran away back to the kitchen.

I told the casino manager on the way out about my experience, telling him that I'm not complaining, and we would probably be back, but I wanted to let him know about the sub-par staff he had at the restaurant.  In his own words he said, ""it was the black guy, wasn't it?""  Seems like the dude has a history of bad service.

Bottom line...a great place to go for cheap blackjack, I'd highly recommend it.  But eat elsewhere.  Right now I'm at home, drunk ,pissed off, and wondering what the hell I'm going to eat since their ""WAITERS""never even fuc*ing asked me if I wanted anything to eat.  Seriously.

Rightly so on both counts.

The Longhorn is the type of place that can only survive in Vegas. It's a very small basic casino, and the type of place you can drive right by and never notice. But if you are ever drunk late at night on the east side of town near Boulder Hwy this place is a little slice of Heaven
$2 for any bottled beer, and they have a decent selection, but what kept us coming back were the $2 modelos...both varietals. 
$2 Blackjack ( I can't tell you how much I love playing blackjack with the old style metal chips)
and $3.99 country fried steak and eggs. Comes with Hashbrowns and choice of toast. 
The food is not exceptional but it gets the job done, and when I lived on the east side when I first moved here from Atlanta this place served as my substitute waffle house.
The service is typically god awful. If you are under the age of 50 expect them to treat you like an uninvited guest (although I can only speak for the late night staff.) We turned it into a game of how irritated can we make the server. I typically don't condone this type of behavior but sometimes an over the top sneer from a server calls for retaliation.
Despite these woes take the time to stop in with a group. Sit down and order. The food comes out somewhat slow...then slip out grab a $2 beer and play a couple of hands of $2 blackjack. It's one of the best times you can have at 3am with only $10 in your pocket.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,0,0,4,SUXayty4_oNuVwAkFQmRHw

I went there strictly for the good meal deals at The Chuck Wagon restaurant. But to get there, you gotta walk through the tightly packed machines that stand as obstacles to satisfy your hunger. I must say these guys do a good job of cramming as many slots and game tables as much as they possibly can without being a candidate for the show ""Hoarding: Buried Alive"". 

They actually have a full bar and im surprised that fit over in the corner where it was. I wonder what would happen if a couple of drunks get into a fight? It would proabably end quickly for one or both of them will probably punch or run into a slot machine.

After all my cracking on the size of the place, ironically its not the worst casino I have been to. To my surprise the ventilation was actually decent. When I left, I noticed my clothes did not smell like like an ashtray full of cigarette butts unlike another I have reviewed. But then again, I didnt go when it was really busy so that remains to be seen. The other casino im talking about in particular already has that really bad cigarette smell as soon as you come in and it didnt matter if you came in during a slow time. So props goes to Longhorn Casino for at least having a decent ventilation system.

Another decent mention is the bathroom. It's the only one but it's really clean and it smells good! All the urinals are up to date meaning they are the waterless kind. So saving water is a good thing. Only weird things I thought were that there was no mirror and no actual door to the entrance of the bathroom. That's ok though because all you can see from the hallway are the sinks. 

So overall, this place is small, but they kind of make up for their size with a decent restaurant and a nice bathroom. So Longhorn Casino, you're ok with me!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,8,7,3,D_MYVhLGtp61RwSwbQNTpA

I suggest, if it's available, the New York Steak and Lobster Special.  The lobster tail is 4 oz which doesn't seem like a lot but when served with a huge steak, is just right.

What made me do a review of this place was a daily special of a Chicken pot pie....OMG, it was one the best pies I ever had.    This Pie could have fed three people, and the chunks of chicken and vegetables were huge cuts.   This pie was perfect for a cold Vegas day, because of this hearty rue that mixed this together.

I have to admit, most people come here for the steak special, but I looked at the daily special list, and it looked good.

Service is a hit or miss, and if you're lucky to get one of the waitress, you're all good; especially if you get Amanda, that girl moves and gets my order right...unilke some of waites..

My husband and I arrive in Vegas every Saturday around 9. For the last two weeks prior to this one, everything was wonderful, the dinner crew are great!   We always get the steak and lobster to eat there and the ribs to go.

Last night we were told the ribs was in-house and we couldn't get it to go, we have to eat it there. After my husband informed them that we have been purchasing them this way for the last two weeks, the waitress asked the night manager if it could be done. She returned and said, ""The manager said he will let you have it since you have done it before, however, we are going to put it on a plate, if you want it to go you have to box it yourself"". Okay, even if the manager is an anal prick, she gets tips and should have just  prepared the meal to go. I don't understand the difference from putting it in a to-go container oppose to a plate. 

We had already notice the difference in the service, my husband cup wasn't refilled in a timely manner, we did a lot of waiting for everything. The place wasn't busy at all. The dinner crew worked more efficiently under more stress from the dinner rush.

We declined the second meal. We received the check and my husband placed his credit card on it. The waitress asked if he wanted her to take it up, he said sure, she asked for ID. He said that's okay I'll do myself. She walked away and headed in the direction of the cashier. My husband said watch and see a guard is going to be up there when we check out. Sure as shit not only was there one, there were two guards at check out. 

I have never experience anything like this in my life. Needless to say she didn't get a tip, I have never not tipped before anywhere I've been. I hate to play the race card, however, I feel that had a lot to do with it.

Staff remember this, as far as customers are concerned you are the company.  Customers are not a burden, but the core of your job. You hold in your hands the power to keep customers coming back, perhaps even to make or break the company.  Being on par in terms of price and quality only gets you into the game. Service wins the game. It starts with respect. If you respect the customer as a human being, and truly honor their right to be treated fairly and honestly, everything else is much easier.",4ExY_U2tgfWyj2rhykiljg,0,0,1,zKTvg1nMm3BG7bVX-9rATA

I ordered the $6.45 Chicken Fried Steak (They also have a smaller $5.99)  The seating was very crowded and the tables were so close you could hardly walk by other customers.  This definetely needs to be addressed.  The meal was a 6 on a scale of ten.but worth the money. This was my first review.....After seeing an advertisement for their Chicken Fried Steak, I thought I'd give it a try.  After walking into the Casino, the first thing I noted was how  narrow the isles were.  The walls had mirrors on them and gave the place a ""House of Mirrors""  affect and distorted my sense of depth perception.  It was probably to make the place look bigger but only added to my confusion to find the resturant.  To me, the casino looked dingy and dark.  I found the resturant and waited for the hostess to return to her station to seat me as there was no one at the register or near the ""Wait to be seated"" sign....I waited...finally after a period longer than it should have taken, I was greeted and seated as close to the kitchen as possible even though there was ample seating we passed to where I was seated.  The waitress was prompt and took my drink order and upon her return I ordered the advertised 24 hour Chicken Fried Steak for $4.99 which was not shown on the menu but was told they automatically reduced the price of what the menu said.  The food came quickly and was as I ordered.  Eggs were over easy, Hash Browns were cooked properly and there was ample gravy on the CFS.   The meal was pretty tasty, although the CFS was pretty thin and about the size of a slice of bread.  My drink was refilled promptly and the waitress was friendly and actually made the eating experience more enjoyable.  The Pepsi was $2.00 which I thought was kinda high and I concluded that's how they sell the CFS at $4.99.  So I give the food a 5 out of 10, the waitress a 7 out of 10, the hostess a 4 out of 10 and since I am not a smoker and found the casino stale, and dark, and not to my liking, I give  the casino a 3 out of 10.

My auntie and cousin took me here to try their food because the portion size is good and the food is tasty. At first I was a little iffy because the casino was small so I wasn't expecting anything too great.

Anyway, the food ended up being WAY better than I expected. The waitress was nice, I forgot what her name was but even though the restaurant is small the service is kind of slow. The servers are running around everywhere trying to accommodate the customers. My drink wasn't refilled until 10 minutes after it was empty. Also, being from Hawaii, we're not used to tasting chlorine in our drinks, but the Sprite I had tasted like chlorine. It was crazy. I'm not gonna knock off stars for that though because the restaurant can't help it. 

The only reason I don't give the restaurant 5 stars is because the wait time is ridiculous. When you get your food, your worries kind of go away though because the portions are so big. So it seems like all the time you waited, but worth it. Even though I had a half rack of baby back ribs, I still ended up full and the mashed potatoes were excellent.


Now, on to the casino side. I had a really great time playing on their machines. I was glad they had The Hangover machine because it's my favorite one to play when I'm in Vegas. Not many casinos have it so I was happy to see that this casino had the machine! Also, the security had to check my ID because I looked under aged.

It's almost upsetting to know that this hotel normally costs as low as $30. If you're curious, we paid $76. That's what you get for traveling on holiday weekends, right? 

The rooms have a stale cigarette smell even in the non-smoking rooms, and the beds are questionable. It's hard to criticize anything about the room because we definitely got what we paid for. The bathroom tub was questionably colored, and I honestly didn't' really want to touch anything if I didn't have to.

I already left my review for it there.  Seriously, check out my review.  The Chuckwagon restaurant is a Vegas staple.

-----

I have given up Gambling (I like craps, blackjack, and video poker just a little too much) but before i quit, the Longhorn was one of my favorite places to play.  They have a lot of slots and video poker, with much better payout rates than the Strip or Fremont. (Slots are always a bad bet, but if you are going to play slots, don't do it in the touristy areas...stick to the locals places with better payouts)  

Their pit is 3 tables, but rarely do they have more than 2 tables open.  They have $2 blackjack with the ""lucky ladies"" side bet available 24 hours a day, and their odds are great.  They actually allow surrender and unlimited splitting of cards, but also allow you to double down on your third card if you so choose.   (so if you have 7, hit and draw a 4 to give you 11, they will still let you double to try for 21. AMAZING)  No other Casino in town allows for that rule, and it decreases the overall house advantage by quite a bit.

the drinks are usually poured pretty stiff, but that depends on the bartender who is working.  Their cocktail waitresses are friendly, but understaffed, so it sometimes takes a while to get drinks - especially on weekends when they get pretty busy. 

The performers they get in the evenings are sometimes good, but often sound like fairly bad karaoke.  They have a good time though, so it's still fun to sit and drink and play.

The seats are comfortable, and the place is usually clean and well kept, but it is OLD.  Expect an old dive bar locals joint, not something classy you'd find on the Strip.  It can get really smokey in there, and even when the place is empty at 4 in the morning, smoke still kind of permeates every surface.  If smoke bothers you, this is DEFINITELY not the place for you, but i still love it.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,6,2,3,36zuasWvFe1uOsPfINwTXg

4655433,2015-01-15,10,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"I am a fan of the old school casinos. In my opinion old school casinos equal down to earth. The Boulder Highway corridor is home to a handful of the Las Vegas old school casinos. Off Boulder Highway at the  southwest corner of Harmon Avenue, stands the Longhorn Hotel and Casino (abbreviated Longhorn). 

  The Longhorn is a cramped casino with nothing to attract the eyes. Many people would agree that it is a smoky casino that could barely fit a bar. To give you an idea of the unattractiveness of the Longhorn; the hotel section is a Motel 8. Regardless that old school casinos fall short of drawing in the public with an attraction that might include a dancing water fountain or replica of Venice; they headline value. The Longhorn draws the public in with dinner specials and $1 beer. 

  I have paid a visit to The  Longhorn two times. The other day, I was in the vicinity of Boulder Highway at dinnertime. I was up to an inexpensive dinner in the Longhorn's Chuck Wagon Cafe. 

  On the weeknight that I visited, there were plenty of parking spaces in a parking lot that is overdue for a repavement. From my parking space bordering a bus stop off Boulder Highway and directly across the street from the East Cannery, it was a few footsteps to the Chuck Wagon Cafe. But before revisiting the cafe, I'd stop at the one men's room in the casino. It was clean. On the short walk from the men's room to the cafe, I took notice of an antiquated cashier counter and an advertisement for $1 beer. 

  I have visited Chuck Wagon Restaurant twice. The difference between the two visits was that this time  they seated me right away. The $6.99 steak special seems like a steel which draws in the public. This is one of a few dinner specials they offer. For around $10, they offer the shrimp and lobster tail and barbecue platter specials. Now that I ate their $6.99 steak specials on two occasions, I come to the conclusion that it isn't really that special. The special excludes soup that costs $2 extra. On both occasions a third of the small steak was fat that I passed over attempting to chew. In my opinion, the Boulder Highway corridor offers better dinner specials at casinos that include The Joker's Wild, the Water Street casinos in downtown Henderson, and Railroad Pass. To be fair, I am putting off a review of the Chuck Wagon Restaurant until I try their barbecue platter. 

  After leaving the Chuck Wagon Restaurant in the Longhorn, I walked to the bar. Considering how cramped the Longhorn is, it was a few feet away. At the bar, I enjoyed a $1 Miller while I played Caveman Keno. The patrons were upbeat and friendly. When my portable battery charger dropped, we were joking that it sounded like a gun went off. The Longhorn is a down to earth casino. 

  I appreciate the old school casinos that in my opinion are down to earth. The disheartening thing is there are less of them. Once their gone their gone. I  see myself returning to the Longhorn sometime in the future to try the barbecue platter in their Chuck Wagon Cafe before I unwind with a $1 Miller while I try to strike it rich playing Caveman Keno.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,13,3,WIGkkqLlWryZFmGmHS8KMg

The Longhorn is the PERFECT place to gamble if you meet the following qualifications:

-You are by no means a high roller, but you like playing blackjack a couple times a year.

-You smoke a lot (or you don't mind having your clothes stink of smoke).

Yes, the roll was giant. I'm not big roll fan, but it was good, I guess.

We certainly weren't expecting much, but we were very pleasantly surprised. So we decided to stay and play some video poker for awhile. They have a good range of denominations, but are limited on the games they have (many of the machines carry the identical games -- little variation, and no Triple Double Bonus). We've returned numerous times already, and each of us has won a progressive jackpot so far (between $1000 and $1200). This is also one place we've found where you can actually wear shorts (when it's warm outside) and not freeze to death inside! We've also eaten again at the Chuck Wagon (didn't get the steak this time) and were not disappointed! The country fried steak was melt-in-your-mouth and the pork chops were very flavorful as well.

5304047,2014-12-07,9,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"More adventurous Las Vegas tourists always want to know where the locals eat. I know, because I used to be one of those types before I got the crazy idea of moving here. For my first Yelp review I'm going to let you in on a local secret, if you're brave enough for the adventure. Forget the overpriced buffets on the Strip. Forget the fru-fru hipster nonsense Downtown. If you want to go where the real locals eat then strap in, snowflake, because you've got to take a trip down Boulder Highway.  

The first thing you'll notice as you venture out of the tourist areas of Las Vegas is a palatable sense of despair. That's normal. It's the local color you were looking for. The only skinny jeans you'll encounter are on the tweaker screaming about the bugs under his skin and if you see a woman dressed as a hooker, chances are she's actually a hooker and not a girl on spring break on her way to a club. If you take Fremont Street south out of the Downtown area, it will eventually turn into Boulder Highway which runs straight down to Henderson (a separate city of its own, not a suburb). Boulder Highway is real Las Vegas, like it or not. It is lined with pawn shops, dubious weekly rental apartments, quietly rusting trailer parks and numerous local casinos that you missed on Expedia because they don't come up on the first page. One of these places that you'll encounter, just across from the much larger Eastside Cannery and next to a frightening Wal-Mart, is the Longhorn Casino. You can't really miss it because you'll see the large orange sign long before you get to the squat building next to the Super 8 motel. Plus the casino has a large Texas Longhorn painted above the door so there's that.

The Longhorn Casino itself is very much 'old school' Las Vegas in the truest sense in that it is a dank, dark, smokey dump. There are a lot of (decent) older video poker machines crammed in here along with some blackjack tables that you have to practically dodge around the moment you walk in. 

Your first thought will most likely be, ""Fuck this!""

Just keep moving ahead. The place is tiny and you can see the sign for the Chuck Wagon Restaurant right when you walk in. Make a beeline for that unless you want to try some very cheap blackjack with inexperienced dealers who might overpay you accidentally. 

The Chuck Wagon itself is decorated in sort of an Old West style, with pictures of wagons and John Wayne all over the place. Not that it matters all that much, people aren't here for the decor. Considering that the place is basically a cross between a family restaurant and the typical casino diner, the menu is surprisingly large. They have everything from salads to lobster to a full breakfast menu available 24 hours. There's also the famous steak special. It's not listed on the menu, you just have to ask for it. I believe it's still $5.99. They also advertise the Monster Burger for $9.99. You get a certificate proudly proclaiming your gluttony if you finish it. I've eaten here dozens of times and I've never seen a single person order it but I guess somebody must. The normal burgers, by the way, are pretty great for the price and they are very large plus you get a ton of decent fries. You will not leave hungry. Other items I'd recommend off the top of my head: the fish and chips, the cobb salad, just about anything on the breakfast menu and something they call the pot roast sandwich which is similar to the prime rib sandwich only much more awesome despite the name.

The best part is, even though the prices have gone up a little over the years, two people can eat very well here for under $20. Yes, a couple of the entrees break the $10 mark but if you're looking to spend that much then why are you eating here to begin with?

Even though the casino is old and smoke filled, the odor of cigarettes doesn't carry over into the restaurant. I'm a non smoker, I can't stand the smell of cigarettes while I eat and it has never bothered me once at the Chuck Wagon.

If you show up at the wrong time, you may be in for a long wait. This place is very popular with the locals and you can end up waiting an hour if you chose to arrive at noon on a Sunday so plan accordingly. If you do have to wait you can always spend your time losing money on the penny slot machines. 

Oh and for the love of God, don't stay at that Super 8. No, I've never been in there but no way can that be a pleasant experience. If you want to stay on Boulder Highway for some reason, go to Sam's Town. The rooms are decent and they will probably be cheaper.

So there you go. If you made it through this review you are now ready to have a real Las Vegas adventure. Or you can be a pussy and go to the Denny's.",sV5mnBoYod1LVNksODplQw,8,7,4,iI0VLYCH8mVDFJsOSwYmlg

for $21 (we used a BOGO from the American Casino guide) 

- On Boulder Hwy, across from Sam's Town. Once inside, go straight passed the table games and you're there. 
- 15 to 20min wait. Pretty busy. Wait in smoke. 
- Entree comes with soup or salad, and choice of mashed potatoes and gravy, baked potato, or french fries. Both of us chose the soup, which was clam chowder and mashed potatoes. We each got a bread bun with butter. 
- At first, I thought that the clam chowder was canned but I took a closer look at the chopped potatoes and their was still skin on it! Although it tasted salty like Campbell's Chunky, I know they don't have skin on their potatoes and onions. 
- The mashed potatoes were cold. 
- They gave us a unopened bottles of A1 and Heinz rib sauce!
- BBQ ribs were great! Although the taste is not like Lucille's, it was still tender and had enough meat for the right price. 
- Steak was pretty good, but I'd recommend the ribs over this
- They also have specials like steak and lobster for 9.99, but we couldn't use the BOGO with the specials. 
- The worst thing about coming here is that after coming out of the casino, your hair and clothes will wreak of cigarettes. But it's a small price to pay, for a good and cheap eat! 

Casino
- Mostly slots. Bar and a small area for a live band. 
- 3 tables, but 2 open when I was there, both blackjack. one table was a $2min and the other was a $5 min. 3:2 blackjack, multiple-deck, and poor penetration. 
- New members get a free cookie! Haha. I got chocolate chip. 
- New members with the Casino guide get 2,000 free points!",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,6,3,3,NCXnPKZKL-QXpmbyv1n2Eg
5344669,2017-01-10,0,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"Recently we went to Las Vegas to do our annual coverage of CES. We usually stay with family during our stay until last year when we had a comp stay we needed to use as well as a suite that had been gifted to us.

During this visit family was not an option so we looked at various places and naturally saw very high prices due to the convention being in town.

We discovered the Longhorn Casino and Hotel and being off strip, it offered recently renovated rooms at a price significantly lower than the other options that were available to us.

Upon check in we noticed that the venue was much smaller than what would normally associate with Las Vegas. The hotel covered four floors and the gaming area was loaded with games but smaller than what one would find in various Tribal casinos.  We had heard that the Longhorn was a favorite of the locals and although smokier than more modern resorts the steady stream of customers continued throughout our stay.

Our check in took a few minutes and while it lacked the warmness one may expect it was professional and we were on our way to the room which was very welcome after several hours on the road driving into town.

Our room was very clean and we could see that the recent renovations were well implemented as we had two beds and a flat screen television to go with a desk and ample closet and drawer space. The hotel offered free WiFi which was good enough to stream Netflix without any issues which was a help as although there were 20+ channels, the reception on several was not the best.

The room offered a fridge and an ice machine down the hall but did not have a microwave or in room coffee. Coffee and tea were available in the lobby though as were numerous vending machines.

The maid service kept things very neat and tidy but was also respectful not to disturb us when we opted to take some time to rest in the room. Security was also very good as they had patrols in the hall from time to time as well as numerous cameras throughout. The hotel offers smoking and non-smoking rooms and we did smell Marijuana in the halls from time to time during our stay.

The Chuckwagon Restaurant on site was a real joy as they offer a diverse menu 24 hours a day.  We enjoyed dinner there during our first night and was amazed at the quantity, quality, and price of the food which also included daily specials. You could go as basic as a burger or as fancy as Prime Rib depending on your mood. We suggest the BBQ platter for those looking for some variety. Our subsequent visits did not disappoint as we had dinner there on another night of our stay as well as breakfast where my wife described their French Toast as the best she has ever had. 

The hotel offered plenty of free parking and the lot was well lit with security cameras and guards as well for additional safety.

While it does not have the swank and ritz of some of the more famous locales, the Longhorn offered a clean and comfy room at a very affordable rate as well as unexpectedly good dining options and plenty of entertainment. It was only a 15-20 minute drive to the Las Vegas strip and there were numerous restaurants, resorts, services, and shops located nearby.
The resort lists a pool and spa but we did not experience it on this trip nor did we receive the Gift Pack that is currently listed on their website.

The next time you are looking for a change of pace in Las Vegas or an affordable option check out the Longhorn as you will likely find it an unexpectedly pleasant find.

After checking in and registering the fact that two adults were staying in the room, I made the mistake of going down to the front desk one morning without my husband, to reinitialize my key so I could do some errands and get back into the room while my husband was gone. They decided that I was a stranger, and forced me to spend the next two hours waiting outside with the homeless guys and drunks while praying that my husband would get back soon. The front desk's typical answer to any question was "" I didn't do that, so I can't fix it for you."" Great can-do attitude! After my husband returned, they were rude to him too, and still tried to resist giving me a key. What an awesome thing -- to pay for a hotel room that you can't get into without your ""man."" I guess they've got a programmed attitude from all the prostitutes they deal with.  I've worked the front desk of a very nice hotel, and I've stayed at places of all varieties all over the states. Even a crappy place like the Longhorn should at least train employees to pretend like they actually want to do their job! Oh well, our mistake -- we hoped to save a little money by staying in this place for a week. We left four days early. You're better off going down the street and staying at Boulder Station on the really good cheap nights, and improvising the other nights if you need to do an extended stay.",LcutieagiJwQAK92DQnl5w,1,0,1,PNDDJgZzBWRFA3vBg_bZ0Q

5474396,2008-12-29,4,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"I have not eaten at the Longhorn, from what other reviewers have stated it does seem like an incredible bargain.  Steak dinner for 5 bucks? Only in Vegas.

I stopped by the Longhorn Casino on a Friday night.  I heard from my friend Sara that there were some incredible drink deals to be had, dollar Coronas, dollar shots, etc.. I thought to myself, I can probably spend a lot of time here boozing for sure..

As we parked, Sara mentioned that my clothes would probably stink of cigarette smoke after going in the Longhorn.  I wasn't surprised, I tend to expect cigarette smoke anytime I'm in Vegas, it goes hand in hand.  

Upon entering the Longhorn, I was surprised at how small it was, and the fog like smokey haze fueled by chain-smoking gamblers.  I could tell this place was going to be cheap but dive as hell.

The bar area was small and absolutely packed with locals, and I noticed a TINY stage area behind the bar where Sara said there was a live one man band performer.  The bartender was quick with the drinks, poured generously with the tequila shots and gave us some sass for being from Novato.

We wandered out of the crowded bar area with our drinks and boozed by the slot machines.  One of the locals, who appeared to be wasted (at 8:00pm) came over to us and started exercising her charms on Sara.  

Regardless of how smokey and crowded it was, it was a totally fun experience.  Lots of interesting characters at this place for sure.  And just in general I think local casinos are more interesting places to visit than some of the casinos on the strip.

Eventually we felt the need to leave, smoke was too intense.  But I encourage anyone in the area to go and get the ""Vegas Experience"".",eeI4DVW43NLBlo6nFkcANw,5,5,3,GMY2Yr-J4T9fEt0HzNs1MA

Anyways, the food is good, the drinks are cheap, the gambling is low limit and they do offer live entertainment.

5811670,2015-12-08,2,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"Review of Casino Only ~ **Restaurant has it's own page**

We have gone to this casino to go to the restaurant Chuck Wagon. If you go to eat the restaurant itself can get busy with a wait. So many times we waited we would just sit and play their machines.

The casino is small and old and there is a little entertainment area. There has been a couple of times after we ate we went and watched the singer. It was a fun time.

The only thing is the casino itself does get pretty busy and it gets real smokey,
Not being a smoker myself it really bothers me being in close to someone smoking with some health problems so it is not a place I really want to stay long in.

So if your going to the restaurant its a good idea to go after dinner hours or before so your there before the rush, The restaurant is small so sometimes the wait can be awhile, It is worth the wait but the casino I can do without. Not a place I would go to gamble at. They have nothing to offer like some of the other casinos close by,

They are far from the strip so if you have a car and want to check out where some of the locals go check out this restaurant,   Try their steak special,",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,4,3,2,RveWSAw1SyC5Kk9F5YqfqA

5952946,2017-03-31,0,3p0SYIaMbJ8j-yeK_do5Qg,"I stayed here with my best friend with separate hotel rooms on SuperBowl weekend this year because she was doing The Voice open-call auditions and I was auditioning with her to be there as moral support, and she wanted the cheapest we could get that was close enough to the Strip. So this place came up and as the pictures painted a decent picture of a reasonable hotel, sadly what we got was far inferior to what we expected.

So many things to mention but I'll start with the one that was most alarming to my friend. Her windows would not lock and could be easily opened from either side, even when we tried to jam the window sill with things to keep the windows in place. Since we heard this area was suspect, she got scared and we traded rooms. That was red flag number 1 in our stay there.

The second was that there were no amenities that were advertised (such as microwave and I forgot if there was even a fridge). So every time we wanted hot water for tea or other purposes we had to go all the way down to front desk and back up. If there was a microwave as advertised in each hotel room, it could have prevented a major health scare on my friend's part in regards to sanitation of their tap and drinking waters.

The third major thing was that my friend wanted to leave very early in morning rather than noon on Sunday and we agreed. We asked the front desk what we needed to do for check-out and they said just turn in keys on our way out. So we did just that, but we stood by for a sec in case they needed to fill out forms, so we wouldn't get charged the extra day for checking out at roughly 2am. It turns out our credit cards showed the full days of charges on our accounts after the fact, so they just charged the extra day anyway despite them saying they wouldn't. Very shady. and I was concerned after seeing some reviews of people getting extra charges after the front desk people using old method of photocopy of cards and such. Thankfully that didn't happen but still.

OH! and I almost forgot. this hotel has the WORST housekeeping setup ever! the maids started in early morning, and woke me up at 9am! What hotel starts cleaning at 9am or earlier?? this was the morning after our late night flight which was delayed and landed at 3am so my friend and I needed all the sleep the next day that we could get. I was barely coherent and I guess I said to come back later or not at all because they didn't show up the entire time I had the ""do not disturb"" placard or even on the one day I removed the placard. This was by far the worst part of my individual experience there.

besides those major downsides, the general bad things were very unfriendly front desk staff (with exception to a man in glasses who, along with a waitress at the in-hotel diner, procured all the honey they could find for an emergency we had), the lack of clarity of their indoor smoking policy (was horrible trying to avoid the secondhand smoke), the lack of good service at the in-hotel diner (my friend and I waited for 10 minutes to be seated and even when we went up to the booth none of the servers or hostesses even acknowledged us so we left), the pool area being closed at early night, and outdated decor and appliances.

My friend and I discovered that there was a ""Travelodge"" brand motel inside the actual Las Vegas strip after a local driving us on Uber pointed it out and we were frustrated that Expedia didn't even show it. We also learned that Resort Hotel/Casinos were only super-expensive this weekend because it was SuperBowl weekend and they drive prices. I know now that if I ever go to Vegas again, I'm staying at that Travelodge so I can just walk the Strip and walk back, or I will just make sure I'm not going on SuperBowl weekend and pay for a stay at one of the major Resort Casino Hotels and get top-quality stuff.
