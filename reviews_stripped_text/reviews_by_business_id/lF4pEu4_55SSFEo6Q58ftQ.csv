Visited this morning and tried the bee sting cake, cinnamon roll, cheese danish and jelly donut. JUST LIKE BACK HOME!! I even teared up a little. You have to understand I have always been a huge fan of our pastries back home and have been looking ever since I immigrated. Got to chat with the very friendly owner in German too.

The girl behid the counter was very nice and conviced me to purchase a cake.  I decided to try the Black Forest Cake, which is a chocolate cake with layers of cream.  When I went to pay for it, I noticed they were going to put it in a bag.  I asked for a box because I wanted to place it in an ice chest to transport it home (it was 100 degrees outside) and I did not want it getting smashed or ruined.  A guy there, who appeared to be the owner, said no he will not put one item in a box because it costs too much.  I understand if I had bought some bread or items that are not ""delicate"", but this was a layer cake.  I never heard of putting a piece of cake in a paper bag.  Needless to say, I said ""No thank you"" and left the store without purchasing anything and I will not be back.  I also decided not to purchase other items that I was looking at.  It is sad that the owner lost a potential customer over properly prackaging a piece of cake so that it can be transported without falling apart or making a mess.   Too bad the women that was behind the counter is not the owner becasue she appeared to be a lot more customer oriented and a good sales person.",Zmtn7vHjfCBstO91cUiDrA,5,1,1,0cbIyHVVy2oELLND91X8dA

A generous portion of raisins plus the lightest skimming of sweet glaze made this treat perfect.

The staff (2 ladies) were really nice and helpful.   I was worried about slicing the bread into even slices but no worries here - they have a bread slicer and were happy to do it for me.

He insists it's just like the baked goods he enjoyed in Germany.  Brotchen are hard crust rolls, with a delectably lighter bread interior, and they are a great match for soft-boiled eggs, artisan cheeses and meats, and fruit preserves. The farmer style country bread works well, too, for sandwiches and toast. (For convenience and consistency, ask them to slice it for you unless you have a bread slicer at home.)

Concerned their stock would run low if we waited until too late in the day, which does happen, we stalked the premises on the Saturday before Easter until the ""open"" light was turned on.  Hilarious.

1895511,2012-03-20,1,lF4pEu4_55SSFEo6Q58ftQ,"Awesome. We have finally found a place that makes authentic brochen (german rolls). Unfortunately it's ~1200 miles away from home! Still that's quite a lot closer than traveling to Deutschland proper...

The rolls were just right, and per my fiancee we've finally found a German bakery that 'gets it right'. She's been looking for a place that makes the stuff she remembers from living in Germany years ago, so I trust her expertise on that. 

We got 2 of the brochen, a strawberry danish and strawberry crumb cake for $5 even. It was very, very good and filled us up quite nicely. It was actually the best (also the cheapest!) breakfast I've had in the vegas area for some time!

A tip for fellow vegas-area tourists who might be driving there using a GPS gadget as we did: our GPS got a little confused based on the street address and identified a spot along Rampart Blvd where there obviously was no store. The bakery is located at the large intersection near the street address location, in the strip mall near the supermarket. It's easy to miss from the road but with some exploration you'll be able to find it quickly. 

Also to address a point made in other reviews, it's true they don't have any seating inside the store (there might have been a small table and 2 chairs, if that). However immediately outside there are stone benches at the strip-mall. Yes, it's parking-lot ambiance which typically isn't the best place to have a little picnic, but the food was so great that we couldn't have cared less. You might not want to eat this stuff in a renal car unless you want to risk an extra cleaning charge. 

We'll definitely be back. It's off the beaten path for a tourist, but definitely worth seeking out.",0tKAXMybT-1TI5_Y5chusQ,4,2,5,onAV_9JVQXmOst3AhRbFeg

I'm a carboholic so when I read about German Bread Bakery, I knew we had to hit it. My hubby and I happened to be in the neighbourhood  right when the bakery opened so we decided we'd to get a couple pastries to go.

Back in my hometown, we have a little German bakery as well which served a great beesting cake; a layer cake filled with pastry cream and topped with honey and almonds. Seeing they had this concoction available too, we decided to give this one a try. Also we saw people post multiple pictures of the pudding danish, so we decided to pick one of those up too.

The beesting cake was pretty disappointing. Although the almond topping and cake was okay, the pastry cream had a very unpleasant powdery texture that really turned me off considering that it composed of 50% of the concoction. It was like eating a teaspoon of cornstarch. Not good. Not good at all.

Next came the pudding danish. My hubby was checking out the danish and poked the pudding part with his fork. I kid you not, the fork bounced back and left not a mark on surface of the pudding. 

""Look, baby! The pudding has memory!""

Yeah, it was that bad. Having the consistency of a rubber band, there was way too much gelatin or agar to solidify their pudding. The danish itself was okay - a little on the doughier side of things than what I'd prefer. It didn't have the flakiness of a fantastic puff pastry.

Given the disappointing experience with both the pudding pastry and the beesting cake, it gets a 2 star.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,1,2,ZOmynPpal86vHH4-cyx66g

We came on a weekday afternoon, so they had sold out of some of their pastries -- come early if you want the best selection! The woman working there was incredibly helpful in explaining what everything was as well as making recommendations. They sell several pretzel-inspired items and we ended up going with the pretzel roll, the crunch stick, and the pretzel croissant. All of these were very good. The pretzel roll was light and fluffy on the inside, but had the right amount of pretzel crisp on the outside. I would have loved to eat this with some cheese or mustard. The pretzel croissant was a denser croissant with pretzel toppings. My favorite was the crunch stick! The phylo dough was perfectly flaky and crispy. We also got the day-old cheese cake--sold at a reduced price--to try it out. German cheesecake is slightly different from ""American"" cheese cake. Their cheesecake didn't have the graham cracker crust and was less sweet, which I actually prefer.

I bought a loaf of the 3-seed bread and it proved to be fresh and not full of sugar and other crap.  The nice lady behind the counter said that they don't like to use a lot of sugar and that they like to keep things healthy (at least for their bread...).  Value seemed pretty good as my very heavy loaf was ~$5.50.  The bread is still fresh the day after purchase.

(Although I'm a bit of a sucker for that.) With a nod to these linguistic skills, I was certainly charmed/dazzled to listen to the conversation she had in German with the customers before us. Yep, GBB is the real deal.

We purchased four pretzels, two crusty sticks, a loaf of dark rye (thinly sliced on request), a loaf of white (not sliced because it's very soft), a cheese danish, a raisin roll, and one piece of the seasonal chocolate-covered gingerbread. All of this came to around $25, plus the free advice to not refrigerate the bread. It can be frozen; otherwise it will last about five days on the countertop.

The cheese danish was lovely - succulent, even. One of those rich pieces where halfway through you're full, but it's so good, how can you stop eating?

The gingerbread seemed a little pricey at $2 for a small rectangle, but when I tried a small bite and the full flavours and aroma hit me, I only regretted that we didn't get a second one so I wouldn't have to share.

Pretzels were the definition of what a good pretzel should be, and until I had these I didn't know that all previous pretzels had fallen short of the mark. Salty, crusty, and chewy, but still so light!

The rye I've only tried a nibble of before realizing that I wasn't really in the mood for a rye that didn't have caraway seeds and a light crumb. So, that's my fault for wanting one thing but ordering something else. That said, the bit I tried seemed to have a good, hearty-yet-not-a-brick taste without being overbearing. I'll look forward to grilling it into sandwiches with a little havarti and sauerkraut later.

(The other items were my husband's to try - I'll let him write his own review.)

I was happy to overhear that a new location in Henderson will be opening next year. Hopefully it will be a little closer to me than this store at Rampart and Lake Mead - never again will I grab a Wetzel Pretzel or (gasp of shame) nuke up a SuperPretzel and call it acceptable.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,2,2,5,kr95fvdUA0seLKhRXVgg-w

Both times I've visited, it has been a challenge to narrow down my selections from the display case and counters of various Bavarian delights. Strudels are formed in an adorable bell shape with fillings of apple or spiced cherries. I was intrigued by the beesting cake, a layer of cake topped with Bavarian cream and crunchy sliced almonds in a honey caramel-- one fine German dessert! I can never pass on a slice of apple crumb cake. They also come up with some special items, such as a chocolate pear cake that I tried recently. It was like a coffee cake containing dark chocolate chips and drizzled with white chocolate.

It's not all about the sweets, as the breads baked here are also amazing. Fresh pretzels are available in various shapes. On my last trip, I picked up a loaf of marble rye that became an instant favorite. This bread has enough flavor to stand on its own, but it also makes for the best sandwiches ever with just a few simple added ingredients. GBB has recently added a section of German groceries, including sauce mixes, some cheeses, chocolates and candies, and other fun food items. There's a curry ketchup that looks very interesting; one of the ladies told me that it is the perfect bratwurst condiment. I can't wait to explore some of these unique options.

Which reminds me, it's time to get back to the German Bread Bakery for another loaf of marble rye, and to see if I'm lucky enough to find any seasonal stollen still on the shelves!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,7,6,5,sm97HTVWNVtEi-11YDeOzQ

Purposely drove across town to try some pastries. I know it's late in the day and they wouldn't have much options (it was about 4pm). Got there and they lady was putting everything away saying they closed an hour early during summer... Which the hours didn't reflect on Yelp or even on the hours listed on the door. But she was nice enough to take my order.

Got the pretzel croissant, cherry cobbler thing, chocolate coin, and I asked for a crunch cake and German cheese cake and didn't get the cheese cake and ended up with 2 crunch cakes. Fairly inexpensive for everything though... Less than $14

But nothing was spectacular. I was really looking forward to the pretzel croissant but it was underwhelming. Not that flaky, not buttery, not' pretzely'. The chocolate ring was okay but there's an amazing little bakery in Arizona that is soooooo much better. The cakes were not great. I had a couple bites of each and tossed em.

We were driving from the Ace Hardware on Cheyenne toward the Dog Supply Outlet on Sahara today and a teenager was spinning a sign at the northwest corner of Rampart and Lake Mead near the Smith's. The sign said German Bakery with an arrow. I got the young man's attention and he confirmed it was in this shopping center.
We did a safe but rapid turn around to get back to the bakery. (as safe as a Bulgarian-German who was up late last night and did not have lunch can do at 1pm...)
We found the bakery and it had some of his mother's family's traditional berliner pastries, cherry cake, crispy sandwich rolls, cinnamon and raisin rolls, chocolate and almond corner bars, and almond marzipan pastries. My husband's eyes were glazed over and he started relating all the familiar items to the very sweet woman at the counter. She is warm and welcoming and very helpful. I love it when a storekeeper truly appreciates the visitors who chose to come to her shop. There was an older woman there whose mother in law had made the same German delicacies and she too was very excited to have her first visit to the bakery.
We slithered out to the car with our treasures and gobbled down one of the almond marzipan pastries plus a cinnamon roll. Oh how fresh they are! This is truly a great find.
Well now I have no worries where my husband goes when I am working from home because he is either at the dog park or at the German Bread Bakery.  We cannot wait for the Christmas goodies either!!",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,33,27,5,MSD6pE0MpMtCZoHEBAKc4g

I will certainly be going back for more of those. I tried the Rum Balls because I heard a lot of good about them, for good reason. They ARE delic!

First, the pastries are authentic, delicious and inexpensive. The taste brought back memories, the flavor was simple outstanding - typical German pastry, not too much sugar, just right - and the price, well, that surprised me, literally cheaper than any comparable bakery I have been to in the past decade.

Second, served by a German speaking staff that is very pleasant.

Third, well, my compliments to the baker(s). Can't ignore quality food or the one's that create it.

Thus far, I have experienced 6 different items - all very good. 

And last, not so much criticism, as it is preference and suggestions. Increase the prices as necessary so as to add a small sitting area with coffee made available and the required bathroom. The pastries are so good - I want to stay there and eat there, but at the moment, that is not possible. I believe the clients will accept a moderate price increase in exchange for coffees and a nice sitting area, both inside and out. And of course, Wi-Fi, so some could stay longer and enjoy the food and experience.

However, should it not do these suggested items - that's fine. Simply take the pastries and go across the street to Starbucks where everything goes good with a simple coffee.

Perhaps, even a German TV/cable station or some background music may add to the experience.

There are several added German food products that are also available on a few racks at normal prices as best I can tell.",k_eKYlkhI11VGzb5RxHmOA,2,0,4,3DN0Za-7KiVXqXYMRv9zJw

I've searched high and low for delicious Stollen in Las Vegas, and all I could find were boxed Stollen that just didn't appeal to me. Ah, but I've finally found the perfect Stollen. Funny, though, it never dawned on me before to visit the German Bread Bakery (duh!). If you've never had a slice or engulfed a whole loaf, then you're in for a treat. Stollen is like fruitcake....

Wait, hold on, don't stop reading! Well, maybe you should because that means there'll be more Stollen for me! But really now....

Stollen can be likened to fruitcake, but its texture is more like bread than cake. Unlike fruitcakes which typically have candied fruits, Stollen doesn't have any of that. The German Bread Bakery's Stollen loaf contains raisins, slivered almonds, marzipan, and is dusted with a nice coat of powdered sugar. A loaf costs $9.95, and I'm guessing it weighed nearly a pound -- indulge, carb lovers.

There's nothing wrong with boxed Stollen (or fruitcake). If you feel inclined to try one, I'd suggest trying Oebel brand that can be found at Cost Plus. However, I don't think I can go back to eating boxed Stollen after having tried German Bread Bakery's.

- jelly donut
- cinnamon donut
- almond horn
- pretzel
- pretzel croissant
- cinnamon roll

I believe they call this combination of a supermarket and a department store a Smith's Marketplace store.

The fact that the German Bread Bakery, located just around the corner from this Smith's behemoth with a large in-store bakery of it's own, does a brisk business with a loyal clientele of repeat customers throughout the year is an crystal-clear indication of just how delectable virtually everything made and sold in this family-run business must be.

Germans are known for their expertise in making a great variety of breads including diverse rolls, soft pretzels and the like. No matter what type of bread you prefer, you will find something to satisfy your cravings here.

The baked goods - including cakes - made with various fruit fillings/toppings and nuts are invariably first-rate. My personal favorite(s) apart from the apple strudel include all those pastries made with poppy seeds since such items are rarely if ever found at other bakeries around town.

Special orders are welcome, just ask. Especially large orders should be phoned in a few days ahead of your scheduled pickup date to ensure that an adequate supply of German bread and baked goods will also be available for other patrons.

I was struck first by the smell of fresh baked goods.  I love that smell.  It reminds me of growing up when I would bake with my mom and my grandma.  Especially around the holidays.

There was nobody up front when I first walked in but the lady came out almost right away and asked how she could help me.  She was not a Chatty Kathy but not unfriendly either.  Just very professional with her answers in a German accent.  I asked her about a couple of things and told her it was my first time to the shoppe.  She told me about the bee sting cake which I had heard about through Yelp.  I was already leaning towards trying that and she just pushed me a little closer to the decision.  Close enough that it was decided and I ordered one of those.  I also was eyeing the rum balls.  I like rum and I like chocolate so that was a no brainer.  I ordered one of those as well.  Next thing I know I was being rung up ($4 and change) and instructed to keep the bag on its side so that the sweets inside would not get all messed up.

I took these treats home with me and broke into the rum ball first.  It was the smaller of the two and I was kind of full from lunch an hour earlier.  This was the perfect size for a mid day dessert.  The first thing I notice is that it does not appear to be baked at all.  It seems almost like under cooked brownies with some grit.  Not in a bad way at all.  Infact, I loved it 100%.  I looked up some recipes to see exactly what it was.  The best I can figure is chocolate, sugar, butter, ground hazel nuts, and rum.  Perhaps even some toasted coconut.  There aint nothin' wrong with that.  It was so good.  A little sweet.  A little drunk.  Divinely evil.

I tried the bee sting cake later in the day for my after dinner dessert.  I was only going to have a few bites of what was actually a rather big piece of cake.  That plan was quickly tossed aside after the first bite proved too much to ignore.  It was not overly sweet as I expected it to be.  The cake is more of a yeast bread and is a little dry compared to traditional cake.  There are two layers of this baked good with a Bavarian cream in the middle.  On the top is a caramelized almond cap with honey.  That is where the bulk of the sweetness seemed to be but even that was not too sweet.  It was just right.  Before I knew it the entire piece was gone and I found myself wanting more.  I love almonds, honey and Bavarian cream.  This is like a trifecta of goodness.

I will have to go back for some other baked goods.  Like pretzels and rolls.  There are many other desserts to try as well.  It may take me a few more visits to try it all.  Oh darn the luck.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,15,7,4,73oz3FfaEoNLpUQgVIJ8og

My mouth was watering just waiting to bite into the famous bee sting cake, well the wait continues as they did not have any. Apparently they get the bee sting cake in on Friday's and it usually sells out by Monday. So we went with the bear claws, cherry and apple crumb cakes and cherry strudel. The bear claws were huge but that was because once you bite into them they are full of air and not much else, never seen a bear claw with no almonds on top. For $2.75 I expected much more. The cherry filling used in the crumb cake and the strudel was unsweetened and rather bland, and they were both so cold when we got them home and ate them that I wonder if they were frozen at one time. I am going to go back when they have the bee sting cake and hope they can redeem themselves and live up to other reviews.",535H0AVY41CWfHGjYhEoKQ,2,1,2,CvjKgXwIxsvvHKSVmZq9JQ

The couple in front of us spoke German and seemed to know what they were ordering so we ended up copying their entire order. 
The cinnamon swirl was 99 cents, but hard and too sugary- not my favorite.  
The almond coffee cake was soft and had a nice almond filling in the center. You might want to skip it if you aren't a nutty, almond lover. 5/5 for me. 
The cheesecake tasted very similar to the almond coffee cake. Do not expect it to taste like American cheesecake. 4/5.

The two woman working were from Germany and were so friendly! We talked with them for a little bit, alternating between German and English, and they even gave us tips about where to find other German items throughout Las Vegas. 

We ended up ordering two of their muffins which were really really good, and two Berliners which even though we ate half a day later (and they had sit in a hot car), they were delicious and fresh. 

We also got two cups of coffee which were great German quality, and we really enjoyed it. 

They also have some German groceries and candy, though the shelves were a little bare while we were there. However they told us a big shipment was coming in next week so they should have a lot more than. They have sauerkraut and haribo candy, and they also have those little Maggi sauce packets with recipes for making a dinner with it. We love those and are happy they're there! They also of course have a variety of wurst for sale. 

The biggest disappointment of this place is that they didn't have chairs and tables to sit down and eat breakfast. We were hoping this was more like a cafe, and that it would be our regular spot to enjoy a nice breakfast our snack in a cafe, but we found ourselves leaving and looking around to find a place to sit down.

Service was super friendly which was very nice. Baked goods selection seemed a bit slim, nonetheless I managed to find the bee sting cake people had mentioned in their reviews. 

Beesting cake quickly was in the company of a few other things that husband and I had chosen. Not being familiar with German Bread or German pastries in any way whatsoever, I can only compare it to what we know.

The beesting topping was harder than expected, but still delicious and the rest of it was very soft. Apple pastry of some sort was not filled with that much apple filling at all, seemed to be a bit hollow with one tiny, little cube of apple :( . Again, not knowing if this is how it was suppose to be, or did this one simply get missed?! Im guessing it should've had more.  ;)

It is a delight to find such a nice bakery in Summerlin for tasty, authentic German pastries! Thanks to fellow Yelpers for telling me about this place! I've already been there 3 times past 5 days!
- Do try its delicious soft pretzel rolls ($0.75) and apple strudels ($2?), among other treats! The pretzel stick and pretzel twist ($1.40) are actually made from the same dough, but more expensive for being larger in size? Go there during the morning, if you want the pretzel rolls, which are usually the first ones to go!
- Its pumpernickel loaf ($4.99) is tasty, but a bit on the hard and dry side especially after a day; not quite suitable for making a sandwich with.
- The bakery also carries some meat/grocery items, which I have not yet sampled, however.

- This bakery is quite small, but bright and inviting, what with its glass window & glass door, not to mention the wonderful aroma permeating in the air and the nice display of tempting goodies!

There are three nice ladies working there. Two of them are extra friendly and cheerful! They speak German to each other, as well as to some German speaking customers. I worked for a while in a small town in Germany (Glinde bei Hamburg) some years back, which has a couple of small bakeries I frequented. My wife and I still visit fabulous Germany every now then. The goodies in this German bakery in Summerlin and the sound of spoken German among its staff, really make me feel like being still in Germany!

- My only wish is that it would have tables and chairs outside of the bakery for us to enjoy the good stuff over a beverage on site! I'd give it the 5th Star, if my wish came true!

BY THE WAY:
- This bakery is located in a very BUSY, crowded shopping plaza, at Rampart and Lake Mead, where the Smith Supermarket is located. Cars at plaza's entrances (especially the one at the Lake Mead side) are usually backed up to the street, thus could be dangerous, so be careful! Enjoy the fabulous goodies!

5156360,2012-01-14,2,lF4pEu4_55SSFEo6Q58ftQ,"Carbs upon carbs - that's probably the best way to describe German Bread Bakery. Tucked away in a shopping center, this place is far too nondescript considering all the deliciousness that lies past the door.

Walking in, it took me a minute to process all the options and decide what I wanted. The woman behind the counter was very patient and incredibly friendly - not at all exacerbated after I decided to add on more and more. All in all, I decided upon a pretzel roll, pretzel twist, apple strudel, pudding danish and an almond horseshoe - all of which cost under eight dollars. 

I couldn't even wait until I got home to start devouring, but in my defense, the drive home was half an hour. Parking lot snacks, for the win! The pretzel twist was not at all what I expected - it was light, but with a nice crust and touch of salt. Next thing standing in my path was the almond horseshoe. The cookie itself was a bit too almond-y for my liking, but pretty good overall. When I got home, I gave my mom the apple strudel, which she finished off in five minutes - a sign this place got it right. I tried a bit before she really honed in, and it was flaky, subtly sweet, and brimming with apple chunks. The pudding danish was slowly picked off by both my brother and I - something as light as that danish is deceptive. I'm sure it's packed with fat and calories, but it sure didn't seem like it while I finished it off.

This is the sort of place I really love. A quaint place that makes quality products without love produced by the overabundance of sugar or preservatives. As I was leaving, the woman asked if this was my first time visiting, to which I positively confirmed. Her response was ""Well, I hope to see you soon. If not soon, then eventually.""

Almond Twist

Owned and operated by two of the most pleasant ladies I've yet to encounter in Las Vegas one would be hard pressed to name a more 'authentic' ethic destination in the city - Asian, European, Latin American, or otherwise.  Featuring a wide variety of baked goods and imports both sweet and savory straight out of Deutschland at prices representing a veritable bargain compared to many of the area's artisan bakeries it was plain on entry to the small shop that things were bound to be good when I heard staff and patrons communicating nearly exclusively in German and with no less than two dozen offerings available the only difficulties presented by German Bread Bakery was not ordering too much...eventually settling on a mere five selections at a total of $10.89.  Focused on the classics, particularly those most familiar to me growing up to a Hungarian-German heritage, it was with an apple strudel that my tasting began and reheated quickly in the microwave I'd strongly suggest others do the same, the result a light trickle of butter running from the flaky dough as fresh apples and light sweetness found balance in hefty cinnamon notes and delicate pastry.  Moving next to two almond options it was perhaps an effect of my 2pm arrival that the sole remaining bear claw was found to be a bit doughy though the frangipane was well utilized and moving on to the laminated layers of the almond twist I'd wager that no better exists in the city, a light glaze overlying toasted almonds as each shattering bite made a mess of my table and floor, a similar result found in the signature 'pretzel croissant' as buttery salted layers gave way to a soft crumb speckled with seeds and flavors harkening the Bavarian classic but ever more delicate.  Last but certainly not least, my final taste of German Bread Bakery on this day was the classic Bienenstich - a dish rarely found but always astounding when done well and in this case done perfectly with light vanilla pastry cream proving a marvelous balance to rich almond/honey/butter crunch topping all anchored by the yeasty yellow cake - a must order more than worth a trip to both fans and those (unfortunately) not yet familiar.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,8,4,X9aGLGOQhzlDZRrZ1OC6aA

I found their baked goods very authentic and fresh.  Michelle F., Brochen crust are always crumbly on the outside and yes, you have to eat them the same day they are made.  I can't wait to take my friends and family to have kaffe und kuchen here! The almond horns and strudel are amazing!

The food is always fresh. They told me they bake it locally daily. You can taste the freshness.

I usually get a soft pretzel and will buy other pastries as house warming gifts when visiting friends.

As soon as I walk in the door one of the German ladies comes running up to me with a big smile welcoming me (not at all the norm for Vegas).

Highly recommend!",B7ygjO6fbs5IhW2ykL_MQQ,1,0,5,nVR2fI1AM1rYCjJdZxxfKA

I really like this bakery.  It is quaint.  It appears to be hand made artisan type of baked goods.  They had a selection of breads and pastries.  I was there for some breakfast type pastries.  The ladies working there were delightful, not overly friendly just... warm in a neighborly way.

They had a case with about 10 different types of pastries.  I got a dozen for an office type of meeting.  I didn't try all of them just a bite here and there - they were tasty.  Real baked goods.  This place is legit.  perfect to stop by here on a lazy moring and grab a coffee and some pastries and read the newspaper...

They do not have any tables, probably because they do not have a public bathroom -- but that is just a guess.  I would love to see more of a selection.  Seeting and a bigger selection would make this 5 stars hands down.

Even though we live way on the other side of town, will definitely be back  

I've been missing the light rye I grew up on. There was a German bakery back home that we went to regularly since I was a little kid. This bread brought back so many memories. I couldn't wait till the next morning to try it, and ended up eating 3 slices with butter before going to bed (after dinner and I wasn't even hungry!).  Wonderfully soft in the middle with a slightly chewy crust. Just perfect. 

Also tried their Black Forest roll and a Berliner. I love that German pastries aren't as sickly-sweet as most American pastries. They were both awesome. 

Service was amazing. The lady working there yesterday afternoon was very patient with us as we made our selections and asked a bunch of questions. 

I don't think I will wait for the next time we happen to be in the area to come back. 17 miles away but definitely worth the trip!!!",ER4VikNscGAqk8O2pX61WQ,2,1,5,AChsjsM3S2whYcspdOwJNQ

I got cherry strudel, apple one, and bear claw. 

The cherry strudel was packed with cherry filling light and crispy or flaky 

Apple was really good light and airy. yet to try bear claw lol .. 

Overall happy to learn about this place being so close they also make there own bread and have a really nice selection of bread pumpernickel etc.

I am so thankful for the pretzel rolls, pretzel sticks, pretzel shaped pretzels. In fact, I may need to get some help because I am addicted to these things. I don't know what it is- maybe it's the freshness, the quality ingredients, or maybe it's because they are made with love.  It's funny because I have never been a fan of pretzels before, but it truly was love at first bite!

I am also a fan of the Pumpernickel bread, but that might be because I ate so much of it while I was studying abroad in Germany.  Toasted and topped with sliced apple, brie cheese, ham, and a little drizzle of honey is the perfect combo of flavors.  

The pastries are also pretty good, but because there are no preservatives added, it is best eaten the same day.  I tried to save some for breakfast the following day- and it just wasn't the same.  Thank goodness this little bakery is so close by.  The prices are also reasonable and owner, Ramona, with her beautiful German accent is very friendly.

You can also pre-order German meals prepared by a German chef to be picked up on Saturdays.  I have yet to try it, but no doubt, I will.  I have been craving Sauerbrauten and Spatzle!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,1,4,704Mveow1ip99Ibu-OApGg
