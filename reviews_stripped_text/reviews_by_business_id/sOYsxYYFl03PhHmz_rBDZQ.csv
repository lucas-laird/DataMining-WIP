first of all, the decor and atmosphere creates an amazing intimate ambiance that is original and unmatched in local restaurants in Las Vegas. the style is eclectic and the music suites this place perfectly without overpowering customer's conversations. 

secondly, the food is fantastic! the seared diver scallops were beautifully cook and the spicy seafood pasta was phenomenal. 

Andy, the part owner/manager was very gracious and took great care of everyone equally. the customer service here is better than the 85% of the restaurants I've been to on the strip. I would sincerely recommend 'the sparklings' for that reason alone!

this place has the ability to accommodate any sized party wonderfully and I am definitely coming back and recommending it to everyone! it's simply fantastic",poTLAUysIxd_qCqX90fwkQ,2,1,5,IglwW1eN7rbcN0l57ZnlHA

We started with the caprese salad, bacon and date wrapped meatball and the scallops. All fantastic.   Main course filet mignon and chicken parm. Not much to say about the parm. Pretty basic but very good. Filet was melt in your mouth good. Outstanding meal.  Desert was creme brule and flour less chocolate cake. Both were delicious.

The sliders were a good size and full of flavor. Portobello fries were awesome. The dipping sauces are crafted well and have purpose on the plate. The staff were prompt with fulfilling my needs and well educated about the menu. The manager for the night is also the owner named Andy.

The bacon date wrapped meatballs are delicious.

The decor is trendy and cute. Servers are friendly (maybe even a little too much so). The only reason I subtracted a star was because of the strong smell of chemical cleaner in the air. It smelled like they had sprayed cleaner all over and then wiped it with a bar rag that had been sitting out for a while.

The host greeted us and let us choose our table.  He was very attentive to us and a few other groups he was waiting on.

We got our menus and glasses of ice water and perused our menus.  We ordered a few appetizers; Parmesan Truffle fries and the Crispy Gnochhi.  My boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I ordered the braised short ribs.

The appetizers were yummy.  The gnocchi was really flavorful and the fries were crisp and topped with tons of Parmesan.

My boyfriend liked his Jambalaya, but it was a little salty.  My braised ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  And the sauce was fantastic!

242244,2014-08-09,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I first visited The Sparklings last year, around Thanksgiving. Not a week as gone by since then that I haven't been in for lunch, dinner, drinks or all three. It's a beautiful space, modern and sophisticated, but completely comfortable for any mood you're in. I've shown up in a cocktail dress and also in post-workout gear. Every seat in the place is comfortable - and I've pretty much sat in them all. 

The service is impeccable and consistent. The manager, Andy, is now a good friend.  I've ordered about 90% of the menu, and it's all delicious. The only reason I haven't ordered the other 10% is because 1) I don't eat pork, 2) I'm lactose intolerant and there are a few items they can't alter enough for me. But they will always try. The bartenders Ray and Jose are the sweetest boys you could want behind a bar. They make tasty drinks, too.

I've thrown parties here, had surprise parties thrown for me here, brought all my friends here and celebrated my last birthday with my family here only two days ago. Now it's your turn. Go!

299401,2016-07-28,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Area
The Sparklings is an Italian and American fusion casual dining, which located in Southwest area of Las Vegas. Since southwest area of Las Vegas is becoming very big attraction for local residents, there are a lot of great restaurant in southwest including The Sparklings. Also, there are many house and apartment communities, which they can target for many regular customers

Parking
There are many parking spots available for Sparklings customers. It is not a parking space that Sparkling individually own, but shares the spot with other business that located in the same complex.

Interior
The Sparklings has great interior design. It looks like they have the real Italian theme interior design that makes a customer to feel the real Italian cuisine. It is very vintage and rustic, but also modern in some ways. Restaurant has many seats and tables available for the customers. Also, Sparklings has individual party room and many booth areas for big party of people. Sparklings are divided into two parts, which is a bar area and dining area. Customers can have their drink and enjoy time with bartenders in the bar area, and other customers can enjoy their meal in clean dining room.

Kitchen
Kitchen is located in the back of the restaurant. It is not open kitchen, only thing I can see was that whenever the food was ready, chef ring the bell and server goes in to grab and give to the customers.

Customer Service
Employees seem very professional in the restaurant. Servers wore black pants and black shirt with green apron. Bartenders wore black pants and black shirts with black vest. Servers are always moving around, checking on customers' plates and all ready to answer every question for the customers. Bartenders seem very friendly. They were very outgoing that wants to have a conversation with customers.

Food (Spicy seafood pasta)
Sight: Served with very clean white bowl and silver wear. Also, pasta seemed very well cooked and seafood seems fresh.
Aroma: Aroma of pasta was spicy and pungent smell
Taste / Flavor: Taste was spicy and bit of saltiness behind. The Flavor was very rich mixed with seafood and other spices.
Texture: The pasta was soft and seafoods were chewy. Texture was nothing like I was eating seafood that was thawed. 

Overall, I highly recommend to try out this place since the price and quality of their service and food balanced really well!",yNjOqJya4L0VkdAOsAvVsA,6,0,5,A2GZCUvJGAwbv4oMSdks6w
306121,2014-09-16,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Went to The Sparklings on 9/12 for my birthday celebration. Tired of the normal chain restaurants, I wanted something different and cool; something on the fancier side but with a good price point (Nothing seemed to be over $30). And with Yelp's help I found this gem :)  

First, the decor is so my style! Very shabby chic meets vintage. That chandiler is amazing (I couldn't stop looking at it) I felt like I was having a relaxed yet upscale dinner in New York with friends. I love the marble table we ate on and the chairs were even super cute. I loved everything about the interior. It wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but for me it created a more private feeling.

Secondly (and most importantly) the food: The food was really good. I ordered the zucchini sticks for an appitizer and had the spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce for my main course. I'm a big fan of zucchini sticks and these were excellent! Cripsy on the outside, nice and tender on the inside and the sauce that was served with it was amazing. My spaghetti- bomb! Creamy, flavorful, and a good amount of sauce. I also tried some of the grilled chicken wings (which were also excellent) and I appreciated that they were grilled and not fried. My friends enjoyed their food as well. My sister is still raving about the chicken sandwhich she ordered- she said it was one of the best she's ever had (and believe me she's had a few-she loves chicken sandwhiches lol) 

The service was good as well (our server Jason was really cool) They were all attentive but didn't hover over us the whole night which I appreciated. 

My guest all kept complimenting on the decor and the food which made me really happy, especially considering this was my first time trying it, so it made me feel like I did a good job picking a place and that taking a risk sometimes turns out right :) 

My birthday this year was filled with so much laughter, generosity, and happiness and I want to thank The Sparklings for being an intricate part of my special day. And eventough it's clear on the other side of town from me (lol) I can't wait to go back. 

Wish you much continued success!",XwIXv7fq6ZGkwbh4BDQdIw,0,0,5,JuQ6AIm5g50nRTbHpHRsvw

The food over all was good. We ordered bacon & dates meatball. The sauce was sweet and tasty. Grilled octopus was also good but the portion was small. Only 3 pieces on our plate when the price was $7. It's kinda expensive I think. Scallops cooked perfectly but too much butter in the sauce.

1) The decor. This is a tastefully decorated space with a crystal chandelier and every chair is comfortable. This is a place to take your date, or to celebrate your special occasion.

2) The food. The menu items are ambitious and perfectly executed. I had the beef short ribs which melted in my mouth. The lobster bisque hit the spot as well. 

3) The service was professional, attentive, and not intrusive. It's the kind of service you appreciate, because you don't get it very often.

4) The value. You can spend as much or as little as you like on your meal, but do you have the willpower not to indulge in the wonderful appetizers, drinks and desserts? I think not. It's not significantly more expensive than other Southwest Las Vegas neighboorhood eateries, and the food is better.

5) What it isn't. It's not incidental to some video poker bar. It doesn't have a smoking section.",df616h7n58jbHfYO5OdbvA,0,0,5,-fKOZ88XNVkyNm4kaL_b7Q

481512,2014-02-17,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"My girlfriend and I had dinner here last night in the lounge. The hostess had informed us that drinks were 30% off from 5:00 - 10:00 pm if they were served in the lounge. We were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly bartender.

On the way in, we walked through the dining room. Another reviewer described the interior as shabby chic, and we agreed. High ceilings, funky, fun furniture and a good amount of space between tables left an impression that this would be a great spot for larger groups of friends.

The cocktails we ordered were good and tasty, but a touch on the sweet side. The bartender warned us about one particular drink in that was VERY sweet, so we steered clear of that one. They did have a fine beer and and wine selection as well.

We ordered 3 appetizers and one main course. We began with the truffle fries, the bacon and date wrapped meatballs, the arugula and walnut flatbread, and finally, the jambalaya.

Everything was ok. Nothing really stood out, however. I'd call it bland, really, except for the negative connotation of the word. So, a shade tastier than bland. The jambalaya especially had virtually no spice in it at all. The fries and the flatbread were probably the most flavorful -- the fries due to their garlic, herbs and truffle oil and the flatbread had amazing fresh basil.

The jambalaya did arrive already split on two plates for us which was a nice touch. We were too full for desert afterwards. The three apps, one main course, and four total drinks (two for each of us) came to about $60.

We look forward to returning as they are open late (2:00 am most nights I think) and sampling again from the menu.",S8nyk8xt0MHrdwilzCKjgA,5,1,3,rk-9X383DCpVisw8JA_SIQ

I would love to visit the happy hours and mingle every week if it were closer to me. They're open very late too! (2AM on weekdays and 3AM on weekends!). Don't let the outside esthetic fool either! It's BEAUTIFUL in the inside! The decor is a little luxurious with a quaint country home style. The chandeliers and  flowers are my favorite. I also love the furniture and cabinetry. 

Anyway on to the food and drinks. My best friend and I visited on quiet weekday. We order a bottle of their Riesling, crispy gnocchi, prime rib-eye, créme brulee, and chocolate cake. Loved everything except the chocolate cake. It was FAR TOO RICH AND SWEET for my palette, but I'm sure many love it that way. It was not the traditional sense of cake either. Just straight hard, rich flour less chocolate. No cake whatsoever. I like sweet desserts, but this was too much. I'll stick with the créme brulee in the future. 

I will definitely be returning again and again! I want to tell everyone about this place, but a small part of me wants to keep this little gem a secret. However since there is very few patrons that I have seen, I don't want to risk them suffering from lack of business. Therefore, I hope more people visit, but of course I hope it doesn't become over saturated and cliché like many popular restaurants on the strip. Good thing this establishment isn't on the strip for vultures to ruin it!

Not very casual actually, I'd say for the female, a casual dress or a nice blouse and for the gentleman jeans and a nice shirt. Besides the place, the food was astounding!! For appetizers, we had the brown butter gnocchi (I believe) crisp on the outside, soft and chewy inside (maybe enough for 2 but we all got a taste) . Delicious. We ordered the cheese platter. Amazing. I'm sorry I don't remember exactly what it's called on the menu. I had the pesto pasta (I forgot exactly what it was called but I'm pretty sure it was the only pesto dish). It was excellent creamy pesto sauce in linguine with Italian sausage, peas and pine nuts. The others ordered ribs, other pastas, rotisserie chicken, BLT's... Everything was amazing and impressive. They do an excellent job in presentation. AND THE PORTIONS. Don't get me started! Such generous portions almost everyone went home with leftovers. The place is perfect for a date or even a birthday party (all ages) they offer a nice private room if you want to reserve for a party, but I went with almost 10 people, a long booth was perfect for us. The service is great too, excellent young men that work there. BEST PART: The prices are unbelievably reasonable, for the large portions and quality food.

I went with 2 other friends. We each ordered appetizers and an entree. We ordered the grilled octopus, portobello mushrooms, and spinach and crab dip as appetizers. The grilled octopus was overly chewy. I just kept chewing and chewing and chewing. The flavor wasn't that great either. I liked the spinach dip, but didn't like the crab that went on top. They offered 6 pita bread pieces, which I didn't feel like was enough bread. I had tons of dip leftover after using up the pita. I LOVED the portobello fries! It's huge pieces of the mushroom cap lightly battered and deep fried. The mushrooms were very moist and the batter was crunchy and delicious. My friend ordered a steak salad, and it was delicious! The dressing was a bit sweet, but I loved the feta cheese. The jambalaya was okay. I've never had jambalaya, so I don't know if it was the best I've ever had. I ordered a mushroom and bacon spaghetti but I wanted linguine instead. It was a creamy sauce and really delicious. 

For dessert, we ordered the trio which came with a mini creme brule, flourless chocolate cake, and ice cream. The flourless chocolate cake tasted really rich. 

All in all, I had a great time. I would definitely go again. My only issue is that they should a bit more variety on the menu. They do have a ton of appetizers, so the next time I go I might just order a bunch of those.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,0,0,4,fSVa0Kmaf5eKxGH4db1Ifg

I wanted to steal all of their furniture.  

Other positives include really friendly, but not creepy friendly, waitstaff.  Our food came out almost immediately and water was always timely refilled.

Okay, so, the food...

We ordered the following: diver scallops (appetizer), butternut squash gnocchi (appetizer), tuna tartare (appetizer); and fries.

The diver scallops were perfectly cooked but....there were only 3....and they were small (the rest were fried rice cakes).  The tuna tartare was also delicious but included only a small portion.  But, good execution all around.

The only things I didn't really enjoy were the butternut squash gnocchi and the fries.  You'd expect a sweetness in the butternut squash gnocchi but unfortunately the squash tasted unripe, making the dish a little bland.  The fries also, sadly, tasted a bit uncooked/raw (and cold).  I'm not sure how you mess up fries, but, those suckers needed way more time in the fryer.

Overall, I'd return because I had a great experience.  Some of the food, yes, was a little off, but I have a feeling it will improve.

Was most recently there on the 25th of February. We were a party of 4, 2 couples. Our server was average, but I was a little surprised when she ask if we wanted separate checks at the beginning of the conversation. No, we did not want separate checks, thank you very much,
Next, we were informed when ordering coffee, that Sparklings Does Not have coffee. ""Only Expresso with no free refills"", as she put it. C'mon, buy a dang coffee maker!
I will say the food was good; pork chops big and juicy, beet salad yummy. My only other complaint, the guy cleaning tables was over-zealous with a toxic spray bottle. I think it showered our desert and wine.",FZ1Ae-z0zarctxDvrUepSA,1,0,2,xRMSeOuGsQ58MZGfkIuoSA

919456,2014-11-13,2,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Honestly, I'm very surprised at how disappointing my experience was. We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.

The service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun. 

Her Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it. 

The cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with ""fresh"" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.

The last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.

Bottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in.",3KtmKS4624Mv5xy_9hGIAw,3,0,2,RDIrip-Dhu5hrOARZ6fdeg

Great food. Ordered the scallops as an appetizer; they were well prepared and not rubbery. Ordered the filet; was cooked perfectly and the gravy was excellent without being too heavy. The clam linguini was not the best. It skimped on sauce and should have been tossed before service. For dessert, the creme brulee was good.

I had the tartar and a beet/apple salad and my husband had the grilled veggies and a house salad. My beet salad seemed to have 3 slices of apple and a couple bites of beet...while it did not taste BAD, it was underwhelming. The tartar was just fine, but nothing really memorable. the grilled veggies were meh, and still kind of raw tasting and the house salad was essentially just greens with no dressing, we had to ask for more.

Surprisingly when we got there we were the only table there. I thought they'd be busier but good for us we didn't have to wait.  They sat us at a table right across from the kitchen that was reaping of sewer smell. The floors were wet leading to our table.  As I looked  into the kitchen was when I saw the whole kitchen drenched in some kind of murky water and everyone running around trying to mop the filthy water up.  No wonder the whole place smelled like sewer. At this point I wanted to stand up and leave but didn't want to ruin dinner for everyone else.  We asked to be moved to a table towards  the front door. Out of site out of mind...

We ordered fried calamari which was bland, the octopus appetizer was just ehh. The seafood pasta was flavorless and the noodles were hard.  The clam linguini was ok.

I ordered a chicken sandwich and subbed mayonnaise for pesto from the lunch menu and when it came to the table it was covered mayonnaise. I told the server and she apologized and took it back to the kitchen, when she came back to the table she brought the same sandwich and placed it back on the table and brought a side of pesto. I specifically asked ""is this the same plate and sandwich"" she said ""ya the chef isn't going to remake it so I brought a side of pesto"". Honestly, I couldn't believe the customer service and lack of responsibility that this restaurant  displayed. I don't usually write reviews but for the pure principle of the service that Sparklings demonstrated I will not return there.

Regarding your rude and dismissive response, I think your comment further confirms what I have expressed. You may think that the behavior your staff displayed is justified through your response; however, that is also incorrect. In addition to the lunch order we also had dessert and coffee. Clearly, your priority is purely monetary.

I'm very impressed with The Sparklings.
I waited months and months for it to open and even asked ""when are you opening"" to a construction worker once :)

It is truly amazing the remodel that was done inside of this building. The inside used to have private hibachi rooms for goodness sake. 

The ambiance of the former sushi joint 
is now an updated and posh Martha Stewart worthy lounge. Whatever the hell that means, I just made it up. Sounds weird huh? Just look at the pics it's truly lovely. The chandelier that everyone takes pics of and talks about is magical.

The menu is a more causal (Sage like) menu. Modern American Fusion? Who cares about the title. It's just good food. 

We have not ordered entrees here YET because we have already had dinner or were on our way to dinner on our visits. 

They said that they can accommodate to vegan for us no problem. I look forward to a pasta or a special custom creation. The items that we have had (so far) are very good.

Portobello fries, flat bread, salads....wine, wine, and more wine :)

The service is super accommodating, almost too much service. I guess because they are newer they want to help and help a lot. Lol. 
The over-service was only in the dining area. In the lounge the service is perfect.

I truly love the way the did the garage door in the lounge and the way the patio area looks.

I really want to sit in that left hand side back lounge booth with a ton of people. It's really soooo big it could fit 10+++ people. I love it. Their left side dining area private table would make a large gathering super fun.  

I will update when we order full entrees and remember to take more pics since we are here soo much. 

Just go, it's a marvelous addition to the beautiful SW area. I am proud to be a regular.  
 
Oh and hubby said no I could not redecorate our whole house like the inside of The Sparklings :(((((((;

However with as nice as it was they use paper napkins instead of cloth. I know that is nit-picky and a little pretentious but it in no way effected the overall rating, just wanted to point it out.  

The food here was good. I was hoping for better but just I kept thinking to myself that it was nothing that blew me away. The one thing I always get if on a menu is the grilled octopus and they had one. It was flavorful with I think a soy sesame sauce but it was a little to tough. The Braised Short rib was also good but not amazing. My favorite thing that night was the Gorgonzola Flatbread with honey. 

Also they have a pretty good wine selection and relatively cheap bottles of wine. For that alone I might be back soon.

Maybe they were just having an off night and when I come back it will be more to my liking.",ltKFZ3qQ_cjkbXwdGxw4pQ,1,0,4,nP7zHVra7VLjqd4Ya80ibg

The service is beyond AWFUL!!!!!! 

I went here to have drinks with my girlfriend and I arrived before she did and we wanted to sit in the bar. There were two empty stools on opposite sides of the bar. I asked the bartender if she could arrange the seats so there could be two together, she looked at me like I was at total idiot, rolled her eyes, moaned and walked away- she didn't even give me a response!! So then I proceeded to ask the other customers at the bar if they would be willing to move so I could have two seats together and they were very happy to. Why the bartender couldn't do that is so frustrating. 

We ordered a cheese plate and wine. We received our wine in about 10 minutes after ordering, we NEVER recieved our cheese plate!! We asked about it maybe 4-5 times and the bartender told us, when she would look at us after waving her down, that 'It was coming', or 'It's almost done'. Almost done?!?!?! It's a CHEESE PLATE!! We waited waaaaaayyyyy to long for it, almost 30 minutes. 

It was a bit busy, and they wern't properly staffed. That is no excuse for awful service and never receiving a cheese plate. 

I really wish this place was better becuase I live just down the street, I will never be going here again.

 We also invited our friends from out of town to join us and they also LOVED their experience here. 

This isn't a biased statement, but their Rib Eye steak is the best I've ever had in my life. I'd say better than the steaks I've ordered at a lot of higher-rated steak restaurants where you'd pay for it a la carte. They pick the best cut of meat that just falls apart when you cut into it.

1557598,2015-12-15,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I came here last week for a good friends birthday dinner. Although most of the party arrived at the time the reservation was booked for (9:30pm; super late because nothing else was available?), I arrived 15 minutes late. The server brought out the birthday girls' drink but quickly left before I could ask for water and before the other 6 people who ordered drinks could ask if there's will be coming. Waiter shows up 15 minutes after dropping off the first drink and asks me what I'd like. I politely asked for water...which he went to an absent table, grabbed a water off of that and then handed it to me. 
I'm in the service industry, as well as two other guests at the table, and we were baffled at how terrible the service was. We understand being short-staffed but it was our group (12 people), one couple, and another party (~20 people). It took almost 30 minutes for the people who originally ordered their drinks to get them. We were able to order our food after about 45 minutes of wondering what the hell our server was doing. Dinner arrived by 2 or 3 different food runners/servers for myself and 4 people at my side of the table. As the birthday girl, myself and a few others finished, the server asked the birthday girl what she would like for dessert (he was absent as we were eating) when another girl from the other end of the table had to say, ""Before anyone talks about dessert, when are we getting our dinner?"" The other half of our table didn't get their dinner!!!! 
I felt like an ass for not realizing that the other half didn't get their dinner. However, how did the server not catch that? Oh, because he didn't bring out anyone's food and was completely absent while the few of us were eating. Mind you, when they did bring out our food initially, the server popped by to make sure things looked good so far. I asked for silverware because they brought out my food with nothing to eat with. He ran to another table, grabbed a naked pair, and handed it to me. That's fine, but there weren't any napkins so I couldn't wipe my hands after eating the zucchini sticks. 
Anyway, the manager (I'm assuming that's who it was), came over and apologized for not having the other half of the tables dinner out due to the receipt not completely printing in the kitchen and ensured us that the waiter did put in the orders. The orders for the other half of the table came out but one was wrong. The woman who ordered originally asked for no sauce (allergy) but they brought out one with sauce so it had to go back immediately and be remade. The poor girl decided to order another glass of wine while waiting for her food to be remade only to be told that they were out of that wine. 
I know this is a long review, but I'm hoping that the manager/owners read this and fix their service issue. The decor was nicely done, food was okay, but my goodness was the service terrible! The only reason why I left an 18% tip was because we had a larger party and the server had mentioned that he had 3 teenage daughters in passing. I felt bad for the guy and maybe it was a bad day (we all have those) but that's no excuse for how terrible the service was. If you can't handle it, ask another server for help or pass it off completely to someone who can. We were not a rude bunch and were always polite but the service...I'm flabbergasted at the service!!! Our reservation was at 9:30pm, we waited for others to arrive, ordered food at by 10:30pm and because of the terrible service and our mysteriously disappearing server, we didn't leave until 12:30AM! We shouldn't have been there for 3 hours and twiddled our thumbs waiting for our server to magically appear. The birthday girl was so embarrassed for choosing the restaurant that she sent everyone apology texts after we all left. 
Bottom line - fix your service.",cWdSjMIPH6_2fLcAi_gDWg,1,0,1,szLPwtY0SB5E-806zaImiQ

1568431,2014-01-13,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Stopped into this place since a few friends wanted to try it out. Boy I should have suggested somewhere else! Not a good place to eat at all. And it seems that the place does not know what type of decor it should be going for as none of it matched. They didn't stick with 1 design but had several that were completely mismatched. 

On to the food. Tried 3 of the items off the menu. First off was a Flat bread pizza & I cannot remember the price of it but whatever it was - not worth it. It was completely soggy in the middle & just no taste to it at all. My friend ordered that & I tried a piece of it but - gross. 

Truffle Parmesan Fries ""sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce"" ($6) - It came with one dipping sauce which was just mayonnaise (seriously?) & the chunks of garlic were falling off but there there really was no taste to the fries whatsoever & they were not crispy. They weren't even salted. Since they were cool when we tried to add salt to them it would not stick. I've had Truffle fries at other venues & they at least have the truffle sauce on them - there was nothing present on these fries. Would not ever order them again. 

I ordered the Crispy Gnocchi ""creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts"" ($7.50) because it sounded so excellent & after the complete let down of the other two food items I was still hungry. It seems that they forgot to put the order in as I had to ask them for it after sitting for 30 minutes & not receiving it but others that ordered food after me were getting their food. Finally when it did arrive I was grateful as I was starving after not have hardly eaten anything all day. I do have to say that this dish as great. I really loved it. Wished the portion would have been larger in fact. 

Service was good in the beginning of the evening as the bar area was not that full. But as the night went on we constantly had to flag bartenders down. Bartenders left our food dishes that we clearly were not eating from sit in front of us for over 45 minutes. At that point I placed them on the rail of the bar so they would take them. I would think that it would be common sense if you see plates that have most of the food still on them that you would ask if everything was ok or if you liked your food - nope finally took plates away with most of the food on them after I had to move them onto the rail where they make drinks without a peep if all was ok. After paying our bill we were still finishing our drinks & never once did the bar tenders ask if we needed anything else even when our drink glasses went empty & we were still there talking. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink or a glass of water. In fact they were actually ignoring us & wouldn't even look at us or come to the place on the bar we were sitting. 

How this place has 4.5 stars is completely beyond me. I think it has to be the employees/owners/their friends writing the reviews to bump it up that high. The Crispy Gnocchi is what is saving them from getting zero stars (although I realize yelp doesn't allow zero). The other food & service gives them a zero. Even though the Crispy Gnocchi was great I won't be going back to this place. Not worth the drive even if it is close to my work.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,1,0,1,h-PxAmtoK16Wai5OsX0bRA

As with a lot of other restaurants I heard about this place though foodie co-workers. The Sparklings is opened by the same people who opened Oyshi down the street. The inside is to me very ""hipster"" but I love the set up. They have a bar to the right that is sectioned off with a window. There are a cluster of tables in the center and long booth seating with tables along the wall and on the left there are sectioned off semi private dining rooms. 

Everytime I've been here I've had the same server, Jason, and he is awesome. He really knows the menu and will joke around with his customers. Charismatic.

1594760,2014-02-17,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try this past Saturday night.

Love the proximity of the location to my house.  Less than 5 minutes away.  It's located in the Southwest part of town, near the Blue Diamond area.

The restaurant itself is very spacious and there's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the restaurant.  There's more of the long table seating and humongous booths than there is for couples.

Unfortunately, it was DEAD on a Saturday night.  Very surprising considering it is ""Valentine's Day"" weekend.. although there were several others dining it, it was just a bit too quiet that night.

As for the food, we ordered:
- Calamari salad for an appetizer (A-ok.. I wouldn't order again)
- Crispy gnocchi with italian sausage and peas (the sauce was very tasty!  however the more I kept eating, the more I felt it was a bit too creamy and heavy for my liking)
- Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta (yummy & tasty.. sauce was just right)
Prices were overall reasonable.  For our meal, we spent just about $30 or so.

Server we had was nice and just the right amount of attentiveness.

Overall I think I can give this restaurant one more try.  I hope they expand a bit more on their menu.",3l5lrs0_voc3cZz_UiLeZA,2,0,3,C6n0HAZQaH38btOZSXvWgw

1603475,2016-12-30,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I don't usually give negative reviews, but this was awful! The lobster bisque was the very worst I have ever had. I threw it away after one taste.   I also got the shepherd's pie. I don't quite understand how this dish is categorized as shepherd's pie. It was huge chunks of greasy ground beef mixed with equally large chunks of vegetables sitting in said grease.  There was a scoop of mashed potatoes sitting in the middle of it...clearly it was cooked separately as it's on dish and added to the overcooked ground beef. The pie crust on top was ridiculous.  Since these were so disappointing I decided to really inspect the ""crab"" spinach dip so I put it on a plate and dissected it. It was somewhat decent for a spinach dip, but I am being 100% serious when I say I saw absolutely no crab, nor was there the slightest hint of crab presence in the flavor.   

On a positive note- My husband said the salmon was delicious, although the serving size was very small. 

I am so disappointed, as the reviews on this place are wonderful for the most part. The food I tried was legitimately awful so I have no desire to give it another try. Skip this place, it's not worth it.",o8LuYUR9wGF_p3jS1Z4K_Q,2,0,1,-OM0hoiLoCx3mpSQqT0Ejg

Décor reminds me of Alice in Wonderland with upscale-tea-party dishes and some garden figurines, some private seating areas available for groups.

Best for lunch or drinks and apps, rather than dinner IMO.
Almost didn't order the CRISPY GNOCCHI because I'm not a fan of that pasta in general, but the positive reviews persuaded me and the pesto sauce won me over: good combination of flavors and textures in this dish.
PORTOBELLO FRIES are simple and tasty with two dipping sauces, GRILLED OCTOPUS is perfectly charred but would prefer an even portion to the set of three received, hard to share. SEARED DIVER SCALLOPS are delightful, but deceptively plated with crispy rice cakes that look like additional scallops. The lemon beurre blanc is the perfect sauce for this dish.
Steer clear of the LOBSTER BRUSCHETTA though- recommended by our server, this dish was a disaster that put me off finishing my meal. Menu describes it as lobster, avocado, and mango (neither of which we even detected), in a cream-cheese aioli, on toasts. It reminded me of a really bad country club's version of seafood salad. Pairing seafood with cheese is tricky, this dish does not do it well.

Good wine and cocktail selection, the Justin Cab or the two sparkling by-the-glass options are solid, but frankly I'm baffled as to why the menu has so few glass options in the first place. Service was polite and attentive, love the variety of seating options.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,5,3,43BkJ4YezZpmUFC8It1kuQ

He is completely unprofessional, and if you say something he does not like he bashes you on here. How brave :)  He wanted to state that most of my reviews on yelp were 0 stars but that's not true. I even complimented the decor of this establishment in my review... but I guess that isn't good enough. He even states I am an ""unhappy person?"" how would he know that by me visiting his restaurant? - oh wait, he got one thing correct - I wasn't happy that i spent $200 and got slow service, had a bar tender as a waiter (who was also rude and kept calling me Bebe, Sugar etc. I don't need to be called pet names by anyone, like many of people have stated on here) had to step on threw up on the bathroom floor and had to deal with a male walking into a the lady's restroom. So I guess he is correct- I am unhappy. Unhappy with the service I got! Finally this guy got something right! (Yay!) Any other business owner would in fact look into this and have the business sense to reply in a professional manner. As threw up all over the bathroom floor (health hazard) the waiter who thinks its okay to call women by pet names (sexual harassment much?) and a male walking into the lady's room is quite serious.

We came in around 12:30am and were promptly greeted by Jose who sat us. He led us to the bar but we asked if we could sit at the big booth next to it and he said of course. We started with a Caesar salad, the French Onion SoupThe Caesar had a great flavor, the onion soup was really good, I also got the spinach and crab dip. The breads that come with it are amazing, especially the crispy one. For our mains my wife got the butternut squash gnocch and Ricotta Grape and Arugula Flat bread and my wife adored the flat bread, and I got the Rib Eye with a wine sauce, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. The Steak was amazing and a perfect medium. I particularly loved the wine sauce that comes on it and Jose brought an extra side of it for me without me even asking. He was so polished that it was surreal. He was polite, on point with pre bussing and refills and at one point I dropped by fork while eating my steak and before my wife had even completed offering me her's to use he was already there with a new roll up.

I absolutely LOVE the decor in this restaurant as well as their outdoor space... so much so, that when my fiance and I were stressed out from trying to plan our wedding, we decided to have the restaurant host our reception! We worked with Andy and created a wonderful menu and experience for our wedding guests. He was very patient and understanding and just wanted to make sure we were happy. On the day of the reception, he was there for the majority of the time and made sure everything went smoothly. I really could not have had a better experience with Andy and his staff. Although I was nervous at first, since it's not a traditional wedding reception spot, I was pleasantly surprised and elated at the professionalism of everyone involved. Since it's still relatively new, I'd say about 99% of our guests had never been there and most of them raved to us about how good the food was, so I hope that they return on their own and continue keeping this place in business!

1767393,2014-05-12,2,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Just ate here based off of other Yelp reviews.  Was looking for a restaurant off-strip close to where my parents live for Mother's Day dinner.  Wish my experience was like other reviewers, but there were some big red flags for me here.

1. Sunday night and the restaurant wasn't even half-full.  I suppose you could argue that it was a Sunday, but I don't think 8:30 is late, especially on a weekend and a holiday.  You could also argue its new, so perhaps people don't know about it, but the manager said it's been open for seven months...

2.  Very strange decor:  I dig the high ceilings with exposed rafters and industrial looking fans.  But then there's a huge crystal chandelier in the middle of the space.  There's other modern touches, but then there's always some strange old-fashioned thing mucking it up, like tacky gold frames, more gold light fixtures, and multicolored pastel painted walls.  It's like someone wanted to decorate a restaurant inspired from the apartment from ""Friends.""  Add to that the bizarre layout--it's almost one big room with not much privacy at your table, but then again, when you walk in, there's a gigantic piece of floor real estate that could be a dance floor.  

3.  Menu is all over the place.  I don't know why, I thought it was going to be Italian, based off of other reviews and the photo I saw of the menu pasta section.  But it's definitely not Italian, nor any specific cuisine.  There is Italian on the menu, along with French, American, and even Hawaiian, so said our waiter.  In fact, when questioned, the waiter told us there is no real theme and that they try to give everyone a bit of everything.  That seems unfocused and generic to me.  

4.  Biggest red-flag is that while the three of us still had appetizers we were eating, the waiter brought our three mains at the same time.  Our waiter was a nice guy, but how could he make such a faux pas?  I mean, surely he would have known that he had not taken our apps plates--that Hell, we hadn't even finished them yet.  To me, that's a terrible sign of a restaurant because it means the timing wasn't right, and I wonder how much of our entrees were pre-cooked and re-heated for them to come out so fast?   Not sure who's to blame for the lapse in etiquette, but either way, doesn't look good on the kitchen or the wait staff.  Plus, waiter didn't apologize for this or even seem to be aware that you just can't that.  

As for the food itself, pretty mediocre.  Clam and Spinach dip was intensely rich and could've used less cheese, especially since half the order came with deep fried pita bread.  Zuchinni sticks were ok.  French onion soup was the opposite of the dip--not rich enough.  I had the salmon entree, and while the salmon was cooked perfectly, I thought the cream sauce it was served in was old-fashioned and cloying; Mom had linguine with clams, which is pretty hard to mess up; and Dad had braised short-ribs, which were served cold.  I suppose a restaurant can't cook short-ribs to order, so obviously they need to re-heat what was cooked earlier, but you'd think they could get the temp right, especially since they rushed out the entree as mentioned above.

I feel bad to write a negative review because I really wanted to like this local restaurant that's in a great location for people who want to avoid the Strip.  But I certainly wouldn't go back, not unless at a minimum the menu was revamped and refocused.",RhTTgcTD0k_t2tWQevMxYA,3,1,2,YW7p5oMYuuJoQeLBWF2RJA

Their menu offers the type of items I always looks for at new American restaurants. The interior design of the place is also super eclectic and feels very homey. 

The bartender was super friendly, as well as our waiter and the manager. The drinks were really good and creative. I loved the combinations on the menu. I wanted to try every single appetizer, but sadly that isn't realistic. The ones I did try were good. Some of them weren't executed as well as I had hoped. But still, I wasn't extremely disappointed. The pesto gnocchi was by far my favorite thing I ate. I highly recommend it as well as the fried zucchini. Mmmmm so good!",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,3,3,4,dggIzbDAXXLmH6a6ldPbHw

Nice atmosphere with some fun decor.  There are lots of different seating postures so you can find what you like: sofa, lounge chairs, regular dining table, bar seating, and booth seating.  

The food is good as well. Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.

I have been wanting to check this place out but we never had time, and figured it would be perfect as a send off to our current eating habits. Based off on recommendations I've seen here on yelp, we ordered the crispy gnocchi, seared scallops, and portobello fries. The gnocchi and scallops were pretty good, hubby liked the little rice cake things that came with the scallops. The portobello fries were okay, nothing too special. I think the portobello fries at Echo and rig were better, but that's just me. We were also going to order the tempura and mushroom pasta, but we were both still pretty full from lunch earlier, and the appetizers filled us up, so we had to pass on that. The appetizers were decently sized for the price, which was good. All in all, food were okay but nothing totally struck me as special. We probably should have come here on an empty stomach so we could have tried more of what The Sparkling had to offer.

1870726,2015-09-08,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Went to Sparklings late night, very excited since my girlfriend and I had heard that it was very good.  

Let me start off by saying that this place is open late (until 2am) and the bartender had told us that 2 servers had left shortly before a small late night crowd of 4 small groups came in.  

As we entered we were not greeted by a host or hostess.  We waited for about 2 minutes then decided to walk over to the bar.  1) Because there was someone there who could helpe us and 2) because the music was way too quiet in the dining area, uncomfortably quiet.  It's a very large open room and with all that silence and only 2 couples eating, it had this kind of echo that big open rooms have.  Was a little strange.

Bartender was very friendly and attentive given the fact that he was serving 4 groups and working both the dining room and the bar area.  

The food sounded really good, but I wasn't very impressed.

-The gnocchi sounded delicious.  It was good, but nothing great.
-The Shepherd's Pie was actually pretty good.  Nothing incredible, but good.
-Bacon and date wrapped meatballs were...good.  Are we sensing a theme here?
-Salmon over rice with caper sauce.  Good.  Sauce was great in flavor, but lacking because there was barely any on my salmon.  

The service was great at the bar, but I was shocked that we waited 2 minutes at the front for a host which never came.

The music in the bar was too loud and over the top.  One of the TVs was playing infommercials.

I very much wanted to give this place more stars.  Especially since the bartender was so nice, but we unfortunately had a 3-star experience.",HTWdjjq5jrxCWE9SAv01Mg,3,0,3,UNndFKBECynkTyAK-XOi7w

I admit that it was close to 1am which is an hour before they close at 2am....and we waited for about 5 minute before we were seated since the bartender was going to wait on us. That was a little odd to me... But oh well.

Service was 2/5... We were the only patrons in the restaurant area and we seemed to be a nuisance to them since they seemed to be having a ball in the bar area. But i didn't feel like drinking...i wanted to eat since I had just gotten off of a 14 hour shift and was starving. And if dining this late was not what they wanted to do they should not keep the restaurant open. They should just keep the bar open. I would have given 1 star but the busser was great so I have an extra star for his service. 

The food was...I have no other words... But the food was horrible. Brussel sprouts...I normally love them... And I did eat all of it...As read above I just got off a 14 hour shift and was starving. So I ate it... But it was so burnt and bitter. Blah then the sheperd's pie... Was cold. The mixture inside was soupy instead of a creamy meaty filling. They did have a little bit of mashed potatoes on it underneath the puff pastry.. But that was cold as well...I would have complained but the attitude of the server was as such that I did not want to waste my time saying anything. 

Maybe if I had come at a different time, the service and the food would have been better. Who knows? I see that other people had better service and food then I did. But with the food that I tasted and the service that I received will not have me rushing back which is a shame since they are just down the street from me.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,7,1,2,2UiOYh6iu6g17lAr0-kENg

Be sure to read what's in the house salad before ordering! It was great. I appreciate  the attentiveness  of the waiter to be sure that I was okay with it. As it isn't your ordinary house salad. For one thing it comes dressed, with grapes and apples. Which I loved since plain salads are so boring.

A group of four of us ordered eight appetizers and two salads and it was just okay. The gnocchi was the star of the show. Fries were soggy, scallops were a total let-down (the plate came with TWO scallops and four scallop-imposter rice cakes). A few items were missing from the salads. Our server was slow despite us letting him know we were headed to a movie and despite the early hour. It wasn't even busy. We ended up having to split up so one person could wait for the check and the rest could head to the theatre. And we all left semi hungry and unsatisfied. 

I do like the open, spacious and well-lit dining room.

It's heavy, but so incredibly delicious with a kick of lemon. I'd recommend as a cheat meal:) Had the zucchini sticks to start, and it came with ranch and some spicy creamy sauce. All were excellent (and I'm not much for ranch, but this was yummy). Also tried the brown sugar gnocchi. This was ok. I don't know much about gnocchi so I couldn't tell you much except that it tasted fine, but seemed like it could have had more taste. Portions were great, including the trio dessert (which was also wonderful). Best of all, price point! As a local joint and has a local, I would expect nothing more or less than the prices set here.

There's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the room and there are individual dining rooms that are separated so it's almost like you are eating in your own private dining room. Then there's an area that reminds me of a kitchen with a line of china cabinets along the wall. Outside of the main room there is a separate bar area that you can see thru glass windows. You have to see the place yourself to appreciate their whole vibe that they've got going on and it's hard to explain, just trust me. It's a place you're going to want to come to and take guests to, to impress them when they come in from out of town. It's just one of those quirky-chic spots that you will always remember.

Jason, our quick witted server was great! I have a good little banter going on with him every time I visit which makes my experience fun.

My absolute favorite thing to order is the Spicy Seafood Pasta. It has the perfect amount of kick and garlic to it. Noodles are always cooked perfectly. And there's a lot more to the menu that I haven't gotten to try yet. I tend to be a creature of comfort though and if it ain't broke don't fix it so I find myself sticking to my old faithful Spicy Seafood Pasta when I eat here. Some favorites that I recommend would be definitely that along with the Crispy Gnocchi.

My only suggestion to the owners of The Sparklings would be to add more main course dishes to their menu. Lots of appetizers to choose from but not much to choose from in the main dish department. Other than that, I have no complaints. They treat me well and remember me and what I order every time right down to the smallest detail, for example: the crushed red peppers I like on the side. Don't even have to ask. Service is excellent! 5 stars. :D",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,23,19,5,jiieJAn2pHm5LiCgXcSrUQ

One time I was sick and didn't want to cook so I ordered take out and the credit card machine was down. The guy asked to take a picture of my credit card and I refused. I told him when the machine was up and running I'd come pay or they could keep the food. 

It was a $29 to go order for what is a nicer restaurant (cheap compared to everything on the menu). 

The machine ended up going back up after midnight. He knew I was sick and relentlessly called and texted. I would have just comp'd the meal, not expect a sick person to come back at midnight. I explained to him that I was sick and went and paid the next day. The point is either call me the next day or let it go but don't hammer me with calls and texts at that hour over a $29 meal. 

I decided to give them another shot. My boyfriend and I went for dinner. We are late sleepers and this place is open until 2. Walked in at 1:12 and the guy said the kitchen is closed. I said so early? He said the kitchen closes half an hour before closing. I said it's 45 min and asked if we could order to go. He said they were slow and closed the kitchen early. Then why tell me the half hour rule?

The decor is perfect.I don't even know what to call it, we actually debated it for a good chunk of time while sitting back admiring.  Until the food came and then it was game on!
We started with the portabello fries and also the roasted beet and apple salad.  The salad was good but those fries, daaaayyum. Not overly fried, yummy flavor.  Just do it, they were excellent.  
For an entree, I ordered the spicy seafood pasta, at the recommendation of our delightful server.  It was in fact, spicy, it was also chock-full overflowing with seafood.  It did not disappoint.  But I'm going to go ahead and repeat - it was SPICY.  Just in case you think it's only a hint of spice, nooooo.  It's some damn good heat.
A friend ordered the shepherd's pie and damn if it didn't look glorious. The crust was flakey, buttery goodness.  There were 4 of us including a vegetarian and a vegan and EVERYONE loved this place.  That's a pretty difficult thing to pull off.  Just sayin'
Dessert - because we had too.  We got the trio which included flourless chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, and creme brulee.  OH THAT CREME BRULEE! Delightful.  Scrumptious! The cake was great, I didn't even try the ice cream. I was too full and I needed to eat more of the creme brulee!

I think my favorite part about this place is the bar. It's separated off in a cute little corner of the restaurant but the bartenders can make a mean Jameson and ginger ale. And it's great because it has its own little seating area to just sit and relax and watch some sports on the big screen tv if that's what you wanna do.

However. This place is more of a ""dress up and look spiffy while eating"" kind of joint. Which I'm all for. The decor is so cute inside and more upscale than just the regular/casual restaurant.

My friend and I ordered and shared the langostuine bruschetta (bomb! 10/10) and the spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce with shrimp. It was very good (9/10) but tasted heavy on the sauce. We tasted a bit of the pesto gnocchi and thought it was alright, nothing special (7/10). 

But. I must say. I tried a bite of the medium rare filet mignon and a few bites of the coffee tempura ice cream. AND OH MY GOODNESS. I will come back o this place every day if it means I get to taste such beautiful creations. 

PS ask for Eric, he's a very good server. Nice guy.",IIQjl4ckL2lWPrqV2ZGAtA,4,0,4,OL7y9xxqm3pdelL8cumyFA

2138614,2013-11-03,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I've been waiting for this place to open, since it's so close to the house. I drove by our the other night to see some people in the bar and got excited to know that it was finally open. 

My friend and I went there yesterday for some food. Starting with the service, it was good. Our water cups were always filled, and they checked in on us a lot. Although, at some points it was a bit incessant. But, if rather have over the top service than no service at all. Plus, we were the only table there for awhile. Our server, Deena, made things a bit awkward. There was just a lot of awkward silences, and it always seemed like she was whispering, but I can look past that. 

As far as the food goes, it felt like there were more appetizers to choose from then there were entrees. Which, probably is a good thing because the appetizers we got were far better than the entrees. 

We started with the Portobello fries and the crispy gnocchi. The fries were thick slices of Portobello that were lightly breaded then fried. They.served it with ranch, and some other sauce that I'm falling to remember. The crispy gnocchi had Italian sausage, pesto, peas, and walnuts. While it was good, unless you get a piece of sausage in every bite, the dish lacks a bit of salt. 

For entrees, we offered the turkey and cranberry sandwich as well as the jambalaya. I don't know what o was expecting out of the turkey and cranberry sandwich, but I was just expecting more. While the cranberry sauce was good, they added quite a bit, so it overpowered everything else. Their version was a little more spruced up, with spinach and brie cheese. However, the cheese wasn't spread at all, just one slice in the middle. So, I only got one or two really good bites out of the sandwich. As far as the jambalaya, it was decent. Had good flavor, but just needed more. It war very mild tasting. Chicken was conned ti perfection though, so moist ! No sausage in the jambalaya thigh. :( 

All in all, would I go back ? Probably. It's the closest place to eat next to my house. I'll probably stick with just ordering more appetizers next time though.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,6,1,3,OIC9g5Ewe80bFUHLQQirXg

I went here with my sister in law.
We brought our own bottle of wine, but the corkage is a little excessive at $30 so we ended up buying a bottle there for that same price.

Started with the scallops and my oh my they were delightful!!!! omg so effing good..we were excited about our entrees.
we both got the salmon and subbed the rice for mashed potatoes. So good!!

The only thing I have to say about the place and we did end up talking to the manager about this so I do hope they take it into consideration....(reason for the missing star)

The inside with the chandelier is as bright as the sun! not romanic at all.Music was very low and could hear the clanking of the silverware around as everyone is eating...and the low mumbling of conversations.

Ambience is so so important...and being that it's a big room...the lights need to be dimmed and music louder.period.otherwise it can be really awkward.
I dont care if people complain the lights are too dim and they can't read the menu...get your cellphone out and read it that way.

I would feel so awkward going on a date here with the brightness of the restaurant.
It's funny because the sign outside is so dim too...it needs to be switched around!

OK in summary it's a beautiful place and the food was delightful would recommend going!....
just take the lights down a notch! EASY FIX.

We will be back!

-Brown Butter Gnocchi: sage, butternut squash, and grated parmesan cheese

Firstly, the atmosphere was eccentric and interesting. It seemed that each area/table were decorated a certain way. Since it was a Wednesday evening, it wasn't too busy which made the experience even more incredible because our servers were attentive towards us. It wasn't loud nor was it crowded, everything seemed to be spaced out to give each guest a privacy from others also.

We started our dining experience with truffle parmesan fries. The fries were seasoned perfectly and was just right. We don't know if the ketchup were housemade but the ranch was definitely really good (it had the right herbs and seasoning to go with the fries.) For the food, I ordered the Steak Diane medium rare. It was delicious and perfectly cooked to my liking. I love my mushrooms and wished there were more to go with the gravy (a little bit more gravy as well) and mashed potatoes though  My boyfriend had their lasagna which was pretty good for him. He had a somewhat difficult time eating since the dish was very hot which is understandable for lasagna, but he finished it all. For dessert, our server brought out a slice of cheesecake with a candle for my birthday, and we also ordered the Trio. The cheesecake was pretty good, the sauce gave it a tangy yet delightful taste. But the Trio... that was definitely the spot. The flourless chocolate cake was creamy in texture but not overly sweet. The vanilla ice cream was perfectly paired with the cake and creme brulee. You can even see the tiny vanilla beans! 

I couldn't thank the staff enough with how amazing the food and experience was. They were practically the cherry on top. We were so stuffed and happy!",3lQJQc_OBIu2hNDA3rqULg,0,0,5,HXm_Yx_upymv7WGgQT-mxg

i've been here a couple of times.  the first visit, me and my group of lady friends came in after a fun night of drinking and shopping for toys.  the night wasn't over yet so we decided to hang out in their bar til 3am and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there!  jose was our server/bartender and he was such a dear.
he was extremely patient and recommended many items that we enjoyed throughout the evening.  from what i can remember, we had the octopus, truffle fries, crispy gnocchi, roasted beet and apple salad and the portobello fries.  everything was tasty and i vowed to return.

so, one late evening, the hubby and i were hungry, called up a few friends and met at sparklings again.  this time, we ordered some of the same dishes but also the spicy seafood pasta and the braised short ribs.  the pasta was very good but from what i could gather, the short ribs were the star of the show.  everyone devoured the hubby's dish and still wanted more.  according to everyone, they were some of the best short ribs any of them had ever had.  

the food here is very good and the service has always been kind, quick and helpful.  i only wish we had a similar establishment in the northwest part of town but, for now, i'll settle for driving 20 mins to get my sparklings fix.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,8,8,4,s2J9YRgKckA0QEMr7IasEw

Nice location far off the Strip and the interior/ambiance really reflects that. We had a party of 8 (including one toddler) and they gave us a table with a huge booth. 

Our table started off with a calamari dish and some bruschetta (it had lobster in it) as appetizers. I would 200% order that calamari again - super flavorful, and the batter was nice and light. The bruschetta was tasty but hard to split as there were only four pieces for the 8 of us. We ended up breaking off little pieces and sharing those. True family style!

I ordered a Shepherd's Pie which I really liked, and my brother got a chicken/mushroom cream pasta which everyone at our table kept trying. So good... 

Our server offered three different choices of dessert for the birthday celebration: cheesecake (which we picked), chocolate cake, and one other I can't remember right now. They wrote a nice ""Happy Birthday!"" on the dessert plate, and my mom happily took a photo with it. After dinner, our server was nice enough to take a photo of our group standing together in the restaurant.

The crab and spinach dip should be renamed to just the spinach dip because I didn't get any crab at all (my husband said he had a bite) and it wasn't as creamy as I personally prefer, it was very cheesy but it was still good. I did like that they give fried and regular pita bread for dipping. Nice touch. The Tuna tartare was also good, the mango was different. Clam chowder was good as well. The filet was larger than I expected and cooked as requested but I was just missing some flavor on the steak itself. I like the char with seasoning or the buttery flavor on my steak. It wasn't bad at all just a little plain for my liking. I did not ask for any steak sauce which is always a good sign.

We will probably come back because I can almost see this place from the third floor of my house but the only thing I'd order again would be the meatballs. They were the 2nd best meatballs I've had in my life. I'd really like to try their pasta or perhaps a sandwich because I believe that there's a lot of effort put into the menu and overall quality.",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,0,0,3,6_4Ug0xzd53sdrHgLtuwdQ

Parking wasnt too bad, and I also like the way they keep their bar area separate from the restaurant, its interesting. There is a separate lounge room for bar drinks and socializing but its kept apart from the restaurant dining room and can still be viewed via indoor window, i thought this was pretty smart since it keeps the dining areas ambiance more quiet and relaxing if you dont want the loud fuss of the people around the bar scene bothering you. Once you enter the center of the restaurant has a flower arrangement of orchids with seating protruding from this center and a large chandelier hanging from above. Decor has almost a modern mixed with antique feel to it. We ordered the crispy gnocchi, scallops, french onion soup, hamburger steak, and seared salmon. The scallops were good and I liked the sauce on them, the gnocchi was also good and had a pesto cream sauce and the gnocchi itself were lighty crisp out and soft inside. The french onion soup was good but a little on the salty side and the salmon was a little garlicky and also very salty but the flavor was good. Besides them needing to drastically reduce the sodium in their food I couldnt complain too much. The hamburger steak comes on a bed of rice loco moco style but has good flavor as well. Overall i thought this place was okay, but they need to really cut down on the salt before my blood pressure kills me.

American/Asian influenced.  My husband and I walked in on a beautiful Thursday afternoon and to our surprise we were the only patrons there.  First impression is French Provincial!!! Velvet chairs, Glamorous Chandelier, many hutches of early american design with antique place wear.  They have 3 different pastel colored rooms for up to 10 seating in each off to the side of the main room, a room for private parties 12 or more you can close off to make it more personal and an open area with solid marble tables and Velvet seats and Benches for comfortable seating.  In another section there is a small bar and a door to outside seating if preferred.   The menu has very comfortable pricing for the dishes they serve, The wait staff is pleasant and warm, the owner even walked over to introduce himself and give kudos to their chef.  By the looks of this place and the quality that goes into their dishes I would think it's more an upscale restaurant, but as we left a man in torn jeans and baseball cap and a girl with shredded shorts and tank top came walking in and were seated and treated as if they were dressed accordingly...so I guess it doesn't have to be an elegant night out.  Every bite of every dish we ordered was excellent...even the teriyaki Octopus which was out of this world! The Salmon in lemon sauce and capers was fabulous as was the Cajun Shrimp Pasta!

Abuelita and I had some serious overdue catching up to do and decided on brunch here. I've been here once before, years ago with Hunnie Bunnie, which was also pre-vegan life. 
So this time was different. I did take a look at their menu online before deciding on this place though and they have a veggie sandwich on the menu. I inquired if the bread was vegan (it is), hold the cheese and no sauces (not sure if any come on there anyway, but I got it dry). And it was good! Abuelita also got a veggie sandwich but she left the cheese on hers, and we both indulged in bottomless mimoas. They bring over little carafes for you so you can refill your own glass and when that's empty, they bring you ANOTHER ONE. 
We were literally there ALL DAY.

Service was good too since there weren't too many groups in house- probably like 3 or 4? And a few at the bar.
Our waitress was very sweet and attentive; checked up on us a lot.
The owner/manager came out to chat with us as well & he seemed cool!
They have a good selection of food & drinks.

Now for the food: we started by ordering the  portobello fries. It was good & something different. For my main meal I ordered the spicy seafood pasta.
Now BEWARE it is SUPER SPICY!! The portion was huge with lots of seafood and it looked delicious but once you put it in your mouth, you were on fire! Even my friends who could tolerate spicy foods said it was pretty extreme. And because of this, it messed up my stomach for two days :( So if you're going to order this, I would suggest you to tell them not to make it too spicy. 
My friends ordered the hamburger steak, steak salad, cajun pasta, & ribs.
I didn't get to try any of their food but they all said it was delicious~
Especially the hamburger steak & ribs. 
Unfortunately for the steak salad, my friend's steak had a lot of fatty parts- where she couldn't eat so she told the waitress and they were able to bring out a new one for her.

Tons of parking outside of the restaurant.

I just love everything about this place aesthetically. The chairs, the color, the feel something about this place just works in a French industrial kind of way. 

Service: 5/5
I've eaten in the bar as well as the restaurant. While I personally prefer they bar because I like the chat with Angel, the dining room is a solid choice. I've been here on about 5 occasions and have never heard a complaint. 

Cocktails: 5/5 (can I give 7 stars?)
I cannot over emphasize how amazing the cocktails are with Angel. I love classic cocktails and was very spoiled living in NYC with a mixologist roommate that worked in secret members only bars. At Spago there was one fantastic bartender, but he got promoted to oversee cocktails for all Puck restaurants. I catch him when I can. Herbs & Rye is spotty with their drink making. I had an amazing drink once (made by a guy with tattoos) and horrible one same visit (made by the owner, and I sent it back). Angel is consistent and by far my new favorite. Old-fashioned, sazerac, sidecar, mojitos... All fantastic creations. Plus he's down the street, and it doesn't cost me $15-$20 a drink. Score!

Food: 4/5
With the cocktails so far above what I would expect in Vegas (especially off the strip in a non craft cocktail setting), the food is disappointing.  It's very good but nowhere near great. My biggest gripe by far was the lobster bisque without lobster, but even the rue was above average at best. With the exception on the rainbow trout, I felt like the seafood from all of the other dishes (shrimp and clams) weren't the freshest. I could go through a list of things I had there, but honestly, there's nothing memorable.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,0,0,5,EfwHd-CR7gMnR3BXsSOjtA

- Ralph Waldo Emerson (Paraphrased) 

The Sparklings boasts a unique and aesthetically pleasing interior, complete with a large chandelier that sparkles like a cheesy vampire in the sun. As others have noted, this interior is delightful, but also is one of the better things they have going. If the owners (also see Soyo and Oyshi) were hoping that The Sparklings would be the crown jewel to their south Rainbow eateries, they severely missed the mark here. The food looks great on the menu but doesn't shine in execution.  

If you find yourself sitting in The Sparklings and want to make the most of it try the Brown Butter Gnocchi or one of their seafood based pastas (Note: the Spicy Seafood Pasta was not very spicy.) You could also go with the Rice Au Gratin with Chicken or the Grapes Basil and Ricotta Flat Bread.  Then again, you could also go down the street 2,000 feet to Soyo for better food sans the delightful ambiance. 

It's not that the food is generally bad; it is simply average and not special in any way.  Happy Hour looks like the way to go as well if you're planning on coming in.

Do come here with a large group of people that don't appreciate elevated food. The setting would be wonderful for a group outing, adult birthday, or the like.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,7,3,CwG2y05qe1Za4iLY_ASrGQ

2574620,2014-01-12,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"The Sparkling has a great concept and a lot of potential, but not quite there yet. My friend and I came here Saturday night for dinner and our expectations fell short on the ambiance, menu items, and service. Unfortunately the reviews written thus far are very misleading. In fact, I'm a bit disappointed with Yelp for the first time in a long time.

Food:
The food is not bad, but you are definitely getting what you pay for. We decided to do 4-5 of their appetizers to get a taste of the menu.  Not the best choice. The caprese salad had Roma tomatoes that were thin and not quite ripe yet, the brown butter gnocchi were dry and tasted like frozen tater tots that were re-heated. You would think that with an item description of ""Brown Butter Gnocchi with Butternut squash""  it would have some time of sauce or butter?  Nope...just dry gnocchi and dried out, over cooked, roasted butternut squash cubes.  Our saving grace was the smoke salmon crostini and meatballs. 

Service:  
We had an issue with one of our courses and the server seemed a bit put out and offended with our feedback and then what made the matter worse is the manager came by after it was fixed and from 5 feet away said ""are you better now?"" And then walked off. Don't get me wrong he was NICE about it and did his ""table touch"" as a professional gesture, but a further conversation on what was wrong with our dish seemed more appropriate for a slow night than a shouted conversation across the room. From then on we were ignored by the manager while he laughed and danced his way from every other table in the restaurant.  The whole restaurant had maybe 5 tables total and the server had each course coming out so fast and we felt rushed the whole time.  The server was very nice, but definitely not polished.

Ambience:
Very cute decor concept with the French, Country sheek theme, but the beautiful valour chairs and stunning Chandelier did not pair well with the paper napkins and casual waitstaff attire .  Also, the bar area is distracting with the TV's and loud people.  Perhaps the restaurant could have a curtain/wall up to block the view for people on a romantic date night and a separate entrance for the bar area, so  the drunk people stumbling in don't have to walk by my table acting/dressing like they are at PT's. 
I will try it again once they're on their feet longer maybe for a happy hour, but wouldn't recommend it as of now to a friend.

2609598,2015-01-18,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Visited this place after seeing people give it 4.5 stars. I would say it is just about average. The owner has paid attention to interiors but if it is supposed to be depict fine dining, bar and lounge then they need to do something more than just hanging the chandelier from the top. It is not a nice view when you look up because I have never been to a fine dining and lounge space that has undone ceiling. Looks very cheap.

Service was good. Food could have been better. Their raspberry ginger mojito was very good. Their pan seared scallops which they claim is one of their signature dishes was overcooked. The presentation although was very good. Their zucchini fries were average with no salt. 
Their spicy seafood pasta which again they claim is one of their signature dishes was average. Pasta was overcooked.  They had some mussels and tiny shrimps for the sake of calling it seafood pasta. Restaurants like this should not cut corners in preparing food like this. We didn' t like their cheap cheese grater. I have better ones at home.
Their creme brulee was a disaster. Looks like the chef made no efforts to serve it fresh. It had an overdose of vanilla essence. The caramelized sugar coating was cold, thick and extremely sweet. The caramelization part is supposed to be done just before serving.  Little did we know they serve it pre made. Very disappointing.  
We have been to some of the best food places all over the country. So when it comes to restaurants we pay attention to many details. The place failed to sparkle for us last night.",250RPsQIRjUsaHFQmXIkYA,0,0,3,PKp5vJLbsWhWddbsKk-xcg

2640818,2014-02-11,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"My husband and I got to try this place on Saturday for our date night. Walking in, oh mygoodness, it is so cute. They have this cute little sign written in flowers, and a beautiful chandelier right in the center of the room surrounded by lavish vases and fresh cut (they looked fresh) flowers. I love the decor of this place! They also had walled off areas that seem perfect for families so they could contain the madness within those little walls (or at least try to). 

Okay, on to the important things! We tried 4 different appetizers & a sandwich to share. We were stuffed by the end of our meal. We had zucchini sticks, dates and meatballs wrapped in bacon, crispy gnocchi, crab spinach dip, and a philly cheese steak. I wasn't blown away by any culinary feats happening over here although I did enjoy the meatballs. They were definitely the best dish out of them all. The crispy gnocchi looked very skimpy compared to the photos others have posted and they weren't very crispy... I wish there were more veggies or something to it. It was very green and kind of boring to eat with those soft peas and the soft gnocchi. The best part were the pecans in it. However, I think the selling points are that they are open very late, and provide a nice alternative to in-n-out. The prices are ridiculously low. We spent $35 on all that food, and it's in a beautiful surrounding. Therefore, we will be back and I want to try the portobello fries!",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,1,1,4,ODvgXIAhh6oQQwErrr9ajQ

We also shared the shepherds pie which was delicious too! It was like a flaky puffy crust with yummy ingredients underneath it. Although it was a bit salty, I enjoyed it.

The truffle fries were okay. Nothing special. The braised beef was something I did not like. It was tender but I wasn't accustomed to the weird flavor. Definitely not worth $26.

The Asian salad was good but a bit salty as well. My friends and I stayed for a good 3 hours and no one complained of us sitting for too long which I liked!

The calamari consisted of small bite sizes in a reasonable portion but I felt that it was a bit bland. Yes, there was sauce but without it, it didn't really taste like much. I got the shrimp and crab ravioli with alfredo sauce and it was so good, not too heavy and not too bland!!! I did ask for Parmesan in it because I love cheese so much. I tried the pesto but I felt like it could've been better. It tastes like any ordinary pesto. For dessert we got the flourless chocolate cake and the creme brûlée. For all you chocolate lovers, this is your go to cake. It's very thick and rich in chocolate. The creme brûlée wasn't overly sweet, which I preferred.

I was pretty surprised that this place stays open until 3am (its really awesome for a local restaurant) When we walked we were promptly greeted and seated.

Ambience:
The ambience is so cute, very grand and quaint at the same time. I love the mismatch motif. It's nothing I've ever seen before in Vegas. The Sparklings is like Alice in Wonderland meets Breakfast at Tiffany's. They played current EDM at the bar (where we sat at). 

Food:
We ordered the portobello fries and garlic truffle fries for an appetizer then ordered the spaghetti in cream sauce and a cheesesteak sandwich. For dessert we ordered the cheese cake. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was savory. The sandwich was served with a salad and it was succulent and juicy. 

Service: 
Everyone on staff was very hospitable. Our server was Ray the bartender. I don't know where to begin with how great Ray was. He made sure our drinks were always topped off and always checked up on us. I mentioned that it was my bf's birthday, nonchalantly, when we ordered our drinks at the beginning of dinner and when our dessert came out he put a candle on our cheesecake (little cues like that win me over; attention to detail). When my bf and I finished our lovely meal we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks. We had a wonderful time conversing with Ray. He is truly a wonderful bartender and a beautiful soul.

Overall:
Came for the experience and stayed for the service.

We see the sign advertising $29 all you can drink at the bar starting after 9:30pm. We decided to give it a shot. 

Well, we pay for our wristband and proceed to the bar area. We see two bartenders working. I get the feeling this isn't a good idea, and it's too late now since we bought our wristband.  

I wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink, I ask for two since I know it's going to take forever to get another drink. He wouldn't give me two. My friend comes back with two drinks in her hand. Now I'm irritated on top of annoyed. By 10 pm the place is PACKED. It 3-4 deep at the bar and still only 2 bartenders. 

Now I'm no bar manager, but something tells me that if you advertise $29 all you can drink on NYE, you might want to have more than two bartenders on hand. 

I ended up getting two drinks the entire night. On my way out, I almost slipped in vomit and spilled drinks on the floor. Classy.

The music they play is awful, it's straight house music 24/7 and not the good house with words ~ the bad repetative techno that you have to be on drugs to enjoy... We asked if they could play any other music, hip hop / rock / top 40 didn't matter, anything but the awful techno ( our entire group of diverse friends agreed ), but the bartender said he didn't want to change it.

My husband was a bit hangry ( grumpy and hungry ) as he had just gotten off work late and he hadn't eaten one thing all day. The bartender ( long, spiked black hair ) allowed our friend who's a regular to order food, but wouldn't let my husband order. My husband gave him a little bit of an attitude but nothing crazy ( he didn't even raise his voice, used no cuss words and didn't even move from his seat ), and the bartender got really upset and told our friend that my husband was 86'ed and that if he came back he would ""break his face.""

What the.. ??!! We all didn't know where the bartender's reaction / anger was coming from. I was a waitress / bartender for over 10 years and never in my life have I seen someone act so unprofessional. Never-the-less threaten a customer! We just moved close by and had we had a better experience we would have come often, and FYI we spend $$ / never ask for hand outs... None of our friends are going back after that experience..

I feel bad for the owner, according to our friend they've lost a lot of business due to this bartender. Apparently he is very sensitive / defensive and has picked drama with many customers who also chose not to return, but the owner won't fire him because he's been there since it opened..

Looks like this place is good for large groups (you can reserve tables as well as bigger the bar area) and smaller intimate groups. (Ran into my coworker just having a good dinner and drinks with his old friend on our way out!) Looks like a good hangout, celebration, and dinner spot! 

My only suggestion for this place would be to make sure the food comes out together. My food as well as my brothers food came out last and most of our family was waiting for ours before they started eating. My brother even got the same dish as my cousin and it came out way later.

Unfortunately there was no seating inside (already reserved for graduates who are not procrastinators), but the seating out on the patio was great. The awning made it cool, the lights made it cute, the privacy made it personal, & the food and service was just the cherry on top. Everything we ate was flavorful and rich, without being overbearing. Zucchini sticks, roasted beet & apple salad, and Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta were my favorites!",16flRysV9Vo-JJqNlkZkYg,0,0,5,sWQGQ7iZumtbUuSumqvKBw

Located near the southwest corner of  Windmill(Shelbourne, actually) and Rainbow, you will find the Sparklings in the same area as Pho Annie and Cheeburger Cheeburger.

- I ordered a Ribeye steak, cooked medium rare with sides of fried veggies and mashed potatoes ($25). The portion size of the steak was healthy and it was cooked very well. My only complaint was there was quite a bit of fat on there. Also the portion size of the mashed potatoes was pretty puny. They tasted good, but I only had a few spoonfuls and then they were gone!
- We split an order of wings as an appetizer($8). They were ok. They were covered in a sweet sauce (teriyaki?) and very tender. 
- The ribs portion was also fairly substantial and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. The taste of the meat just wasn't doing it for me. I felt like I was eating a pot roast. It wasn't bad at all, just not what I was expecting.
- Service was good. Drinks were refilled promptly and the waiter was friendly and engaging.

The room is beautifully decorated, including that impressive chandelier. Lots of open air and space to accommodate many people. I didn't get a chance to check it out, but the bar area actually looked very cozy and inviting. Maybe one of these days we'll all swing by here for drinks.

As for the food, it was okay, but honestly lacked the ""wow"" factor that will have me returning any time soon. Maybe one of these days I'll give it another shot, but for now the 3 star rating feels very appropriate. Its A-Ok..

The menu is Italian mostly but offers sandwiches, steak and sea food. Most menu items are below $18 and are of a decent portion. 

I had a shrimp and chicken pasta my last visit and a plan spaghetti the first time. Both were really tasty, not the best I've had but a good value for the price. 

I haven't gone wrong with any of the appetizers especially the steak salad which has perfectly cooled steak along with sweet apples sliced into the mix.

We ended up in the bar, and a cozy little sitting area. The smiling server brought menus right over! One of the friends that we were with has a serious wheat allergy. No not some annoying hipster ""gluten allergy"" but a serious face swells up like a ball allergy. I have seen photos, it is not pretty!

So...we asked our server what he could have on the menu, and the server cheerfully boasted ""Honey, 99% of that menu has wheat in it! You can have a salad and that is about it"" Then told us most restaurants don't have gluten free items here in Las Vegas....OK, we will agree to disagree. And wish there were more gluten free options on this menu.

Once we got over that moment, we ordered some food. (Yes my friend had a salad, no dressing because we were told they make salad dressing with wheat as well) 

He had a steak salad and tuna tartar, hold the soy sauce on the tartar. I had the sausage pesto pasta and it was awesome! 

Overall we had a great time, now I really want to go back and sit in the dining room. Which is beautiful BTW! Still holding out hope that the next time will live up to the hype! It was almost there the first time!",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,0,0,4,lhgpJvMfCYCPI_XHTmDKig

The saying, ""never judge a book by its cover"" has never been truer when it comes to The Sparkling. The outside has the look of every other terrible twenty-four hour local gambling hall. The PT's, the Dotty's, and the Distills of the Valley, but once you walk-in it's completely different. 

A giant chandelier is hanging in center of the main room with brown vintage booths directly underneath. This seating is then surrounded by freestanding tables and private booth areas, I would say the style and vibe of the place is Southern, but the food is a mix of American/Italian? 

We sat in the center booth and promptly ordered drinks and apps. Moscow mules all around and for the apps we got Bacon & Date Wrapped Meatball and Crispy Gnocchi. These were both very good, the Crispy Gnocchi had incredible flavor and the pesto sauce was drinkable. The Gnocchi itself was perfectly cooked, but wasn't crispy. I'm not sure how that factors in in the description. OK, Bacon & Date Wrapped Meatballs. Stay with me here... You take a date, then you stuff it with delicious spicy meats, and then wrap it in bacon. Nuff said. The mules were overly sweet and didn't seem to have much ginger, but they were still tasty and refreshing. 

The main course - The only Italian thing about this plate was the word ""pasta"" in the title... Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta. Normally, I stay away from this type of Chili's or Applebee's style of food, but I wasn't really feeling much else on the menu, plus the server swore by it. Thank you server guy. This plate of food was delicious, the sauce was spicy, and the pasta was cooked perfect. The chicken and shrimp complimented each other nicely. They seasoned the proteins prior to adding them to the sauce, great touch. 

The server we had was stellar, so good in fact that we didn't want to leave after dining and ended up sipping a few drinks. We moved to the bar so we didn't keep a table busy. The bar was pretty empty, but the service very slow. Bummer. 

The ambiance and food were great; I would definitely come back here in the future. If I could a 4.5 star rating, I would.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,12,15,4,9DlhhPDIBjL14tX0K2wEXg

The restaurant was not packed at all which was great because I was hosting a ""Welcome to Motherhood"" dinner for my best friend so it kept it pretty intimate even with our seating being out in the open. I took one star off though because 2 things that we wanted to order and had been hoping to try were not on the available which sucked because we had visitors from California hoping to try this. Also, it was hard to get hold of our waitress because she was catering to another table of 20 but we told her we would have patience with her because she let us know a head of time. She was a good waitress just busy. Other than that the experience was great, the food was great, the appetizers were beyond fabulous (especially the truffle fries and the fried zucchini) and the desserts (specifically the creme brûlée) was perfect.

ORDERED:
-Roederer Estate & Cucumber French 75: Both tasty and refreshing champagne cocktails
-Langosta Bruschetta: Lots of big chunks of Langostine mixed in with Mango, Avocado, Green Onion & a Cream Cheese Aioli. Also very fresh and flavorful, would definitely order these again
-Bacon & Cream Pasta + Shrimp: Basically their take on Carbonara. Creamy, rich sauce, maybe a little too runny for my taste but the flavor was definitely there. Lots of shrimp and mushrooms
-Turkey Sandwich: Reminded me of the Turkey Sandwich at Presto. Lots of turkey, super big chunks of gooey Brie mixed with Cranberry.

I have yet to try a main entree, which I assume is excellent, but their plethora of appetizers keeps me craving smaller plates over a nice, big steak.  The menu is simple--appetizers, soups, sandwiches, pasta and rice, and then entrees and desserts.  On our first visit, my husband and I went through four cocktails and about 6 appetizers.  Our bill remained well under $90 and we left happy.

My first suggestion is to try their apple & beet salad with candied walnuts along with their crispy gnocchi.  The gnocchi is rich and pillowy, while the salad provides that light contrast.  Move on to the scallops and brown butter gnocchi (if you don't mind doubling up on the gnocchi), then some grilled wings and meatballs.  Those bacon-wrapped meatballs with dates provides a salty and sweet dish with a side of grilled, sweet chicken wings.  We washed it all down with a few Chandelier martinis, a French 75, and a bourbon mule.  Hit it up with some creme brulee or cheesecake if you have room to spare, and your meal will be complete.

We were charged $8 to swap out the pan seared atlantic salmon's rice for penne pasta. We were not told about this difference in price. If we were told about it, we would have passed on the ""upgrade"", as there's not enough of a difference between rice and pasta to warrant $28 vs. $20.

We are celebrating a birthday party and only half of the table go to order their food :( I decided on the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer and it was okay. For my entree I got the Jambalaya and the rice was way too watery. My friend had the zucchini and those were delicious. Their happy hour was great and overall it was a good experience.

We also drop in from time to time for lunch or dinner when we don't want to venture too far. The service is always top notch and the atmosphere is amazing! The bartenders and servers are extremely personable. Food is consistent, I wouldn't call any of the dishes the best I've ever had but I've also never been dissatisfied! My favorites are the portobello fries, the filet, the pork and beef sliders, grilled chicken wings, and atlantic salmon.

We started off with the grapes, arugula and ricotta flat bread. The flat bread was barely warm which made it hard to eat because the ingredients kept rolling off. It was over dressed with balsamic vinaigrette and needed a drizzle instead of a pour. The ingredients in this dish had the ability to work well together but the dish just ended up tasting unsophisticated. For our mains we ordered the chicken Parmesan and the Philly cheesesteak. 

Once again, both dishes were unrefined. 

Chicken Parmesan-  dish was under seasoned, breading was soggy at the bottom and crispy on the top making me think the chicken was not freshly breaded,it was dry

Philly cheesesteak- the low quality of meat and bread was evident. It came with a spring salad that had no dressing and a pickle spear sitting on top. Even if you like pickles I don't think anyone wants it seeping into their salad. 

It's too bad that the food does not deliver because they did a great job on the theme.",hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,5,3,2,NWCvIaiJvDrtXMH9xBEliA

There was a slight mess up on one order where they brought two of the same dish out. It was funny how the second dish ""looked"" better than the first dish. But the first dish tasted good so no complaints.

Beautiful and fun decor! We decided on ordering a bunch of things and shared family style, most of the options we chose were done well. A few misses: our table was kind of private, set back between two walls which was cool, but we didn't realize we were in Antarctica until the AC kicked on and blew directly at our table, making most of the party uncomfortably cold. Secondly, we saw the food runner more than our waiter; it wasn't until we commented on that fact that the waiter finally reappeared!

Tyler remembered us and also remembered to wish us a happy anniversary! He was awesome. Our bartender Anthony was great too. Awesome customer service. Now to the food! We had the spinach and crab dip which came out hot and cheesy! We ordered a bottle of wine as well with their 30% off at the bar. What a gem to find here in Vegas.

I have been to Sparklings several times for events and dinner, and EVERY TIME was as good as the first. Consistency is tough, but Sparklings pulls it off. It is super difficult to find ANY business with the level of service that this place has. This last time, my husband and I went in for a glass of wine and dessert. We were seated, and treated just like any customer buying a full fledged dinner. The service was prompt, professional, and the wine is great! the flourless chocolate cake was also ""melt in your mouth"" good!

The food was still top notch but the service was awful.  We were promptly sat in the main area and the guy who sat us started us with waters.

Then we sat and waited for over 10 minutes and a server came over and asked if we had been taken care of and we said no and he said he would.  We then ordered our meal and there was another substantial delay.  My tuna tartar came out first and then nothing for a while then my dads app the fish tacos came out then nothing.

I made eye contact with the manager as he probably saw me looking around and that is when all of our food came out.  While all of the food was great, the service didn't compare to what it has been before.  Not to mention the manager clearly could tell I was impatient and while he intervened to deliver our meal he didn't apologize for the obvious delay.

The bathrooms definitely need some attention.  They were out of paper towels and the toilet didn't flush easily. We could even hear other guests complaining at the host stand to the manager about the bathroom being sub par.  

We were then forgotten about again and as my family was tired we went up to the host stand ourself to pay our bill.

This place has the food down to a tee but if they don't turn their guest experience around ASAP I can't see anything good for the future.  I truly hope this was a one off.",gwXobKRw1ihYiKPqwUE9xQ,2,1,2,_-LxF4P4peaAj9VRC4uc5A
3245931,2016-06-12,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"So updating my original review. I'm sure the food is still excellent but I wouldn't know since the last two times I've tried to dine here it's been closed for a private event. 

Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, the first time they were polite enough to have posted a sign saying they were closed for the afternoon which was perfectly acceptable. 

The second time I made sure to call in advance because I didn't want to make the drive all the way over there to be turned away again. The gentleman on the phone said they were open for normal business hours. Great! I said and almost hung up but then he mentioned the dining area was closed for a private event but we could still sit at the bar and we could still eat there. That option was fine with us so we left to eat there. 

When we arrived we were told that there was a private event and they were closed. I said I just called and that the person on the phone said we could eat at the bar. However to get to the bar we had to walk through the private event which was very awkward. No one else was there aside from the private party so we ended up leaving. 

I get it... Places get bought out. It's a cute atmosphere... But this type of miscommunication shouldn't be happening. If a place is bought out, it's bought out. I guess we *could* have sat at the bar but it was extremely awkward and clearly the entire place was supposed to be only for that party. 

Maybe one day I'll actually get to eat there again.... Maybe.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,3,2,3,4I9L86RlfURZUgVUR1uJxg

3265044,2015-05-30,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"When we walked in to a half empty restaurant, there was no host at the front, so we waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to finally seat us. We were excited about the decor in the dining room. They gave use a table in a nice secluded area with a bench seat on one side and overly large comfortable seats on the other. The menu looked impressive with very reasonable prices. I couldn't believe it wasn't packed with people. The waiter was very friendly. We placed our order for drinks, appetizers and entrees.  When my wife went to pick up the menu, there was a bug on the table under the menu. She jumped from her seat. The waiter looked for the bug under the table. I used the light on my phone, and we found and killed it. Ok. Everything ok. Let's get back to dinner. About 2 minutes later, my youngest jumped out of her seat and said there was a bug on her leg. I looked on her seat, and the bug was running around on the cushion (see picture). Who I think was the owner (tall Asian guy) came over to talk to the waiter. The waiter moved us to another table. We decided to stay because it wasn't roaches, and it was too late to find another place to eat as the kids were hungry. 
Out comes one of the appetizers - bacon/date meatballs. As we took our first bite of the meatballs, out comes my wife's ribeye entree order. The owner comes over and asks how's everything. I said the entree is a bit early. He says, ""Oh, I will try to get the other entrees out faster.""  What?  How about giving us time to eat the appetizers first. Then the next appetizer comes out - the octopus. Then the kids baby back ribs. Finally my chicken parmigiana. So all entrees were on the table before we even finished our appetizers. Geez. Not a huge issue for us because the apps were a couple of bites each, but why doesn't the owner or waiter know how to time the food coming out???  Also, the owner never even apologized about the bugs. 
Now the food (see pictures). My chicken parmigiana came with spaghetti. The spaghetti was cooked right al debate and sauce tastes good. The chicken had a weird texture. I flipped it over and noticed that it looked like chicken had either panini grill or George Foreman grill marks. It was not a breaded chicken breast. Chicken parm is my favorite dish, and they do not do it justice. The chicken filet itself tasted liked a previously frozen breast that gets injected with solution kind of like a breast from one of those family sized bags of frozen breasts you find at Costco. 
My wife got a rib-eye steak and ordered it medium. Although it came out earlier than any other entree, it was well done. It also had a strange color to it. Although there were grill marks, it did not have any kind of crusting like a char-broiled or flame-broiled steak. It looks like they put it on a grill pan but there was too much liquid in the pan causing a boiling of the meat instead of a sear. We waited for about 15 minted before we even saw the waiter again, and told him about the steak. He apologized and went back to get another steak. My wife ate what should could but about 50% of the steak was fat (see picture). Yes the rib-eye looks like a large portion when it comes out, but you can't eat most of it. 
Two of the kids split the ribs. It came with cornbread and mashed potatoes. The cornbread was extremely dry and tasteless. My kids love cornbread, and we each only tasted a small bite to see how bad it really was. Although the ribs were fall off the bone, they still tastes dry to me. The bbq sauce on the ribs was overpowering and not very good. 
My other kid ordered the kid's menu fish and chips. Typical crap food on a kids menu using a frozen fish filet that's deep fried. Kid's meal comes with a drink, but apparently the waiter doesn't know that because he tried to charge me for the drink. 
In the end, I think the bugs were trying to warn us to get out of there. They even sent two, so we would get the point. I wish we walked out after the second warning. I was so disappointed as we were hoping this could be a cool place to stop whenever we are in Vegas. My kids didn't even want to stay for dessert. At one point we were looking for our waiter. I noticed he was near the bar talking to someone.  He was there for about five minutes. Next thing you know he is doing shots with the guy. Then instead of checking on his tables, he wanders in to the back for another 10 mins. The owner never checked on us again even though he passed our table about 10 times when he went to/from the kitchen. 

Bottom line - the food pretty much sucks, the service sucks, the owner doesn't care. It is reflected in the food they serve, the service they provide, and the apathy they display.   As we left the restaurant, you would think someone would give a final word of apology. The owner was too busy in the bar area BSing. Bill $103. No comp for the horrible experience, and overcharged for a soda. No wonder it was pretty empty on a Friday night. One star for ambiance.",Mf_-HfdZbCUxO7-ObpiZaQ,3,1,1,q5FTjcd8LudsMOXSQHJHdw

I didnt drink wine that night, but I looked over the selection and they had a nice variety of everything. Our server was great. Jason I think his name was? My only thing was I couldn't quite pin point the atmosphere.  It's nice, but like trying to hard to be upscale. The music was very jazzy and at times elevator music.

Food: Bruschetta and Tuna Tartare for the appetizer. Full of flavor with every little bite. 
My date had filet mignon as I had the rib eye. She describes hers as ""melts in your mouth"" type of ordeal. I tried to savor my rib eye as much as I could, 12oz of medium rare goodness. The portions were really huge, judging off the other tables. We also had a bottle of wine to go with our meals. Ended the night with a Creme Brûlée, each. Too good to share. 

I will definitely be coming back to Sparklings. Waiters were very prompt and catering. It's not too casual nor too formal of a place to dine and wine.

We sat and waited about 5-8 minutes to be greeted and get our drink orders taken which also gave us time to have our whole order placed appetizers and entrees.

We order the crispy pesto gnocchi which was pretty good but rich to eat alone. We also had the langosta bruschetta which had a beautiful display but underwhelming taste.

Our meals came out and we were not impressed. I had the shrimp tempura pasta with mushrooms. Looked nice, the pasta had a pretty good flavor but I could have gone without the breaded shrimp. It was soggy and I couldn't eat it at all cause the thought alone made me gag. My brother had the cheesesteak and they had kraft cheese on it and it was pretty bland.

The atmosphere is pretty cool and shabby chic. There's a cool huge crystal chandelier in the dining area and several small, fun touches - like the hot pink door leading to the kitchen
The servers are friendly and prompt (although I did have to ask for a water refill - which, in my opinion, should be automatic).

The men's bathroom is in desperate need of a deep cleaning though. There's thick hard water deposits on the fixtures and dirt stains on the mirrors and towel dispenser. While the main dining area looks very well maintained, the men's restroom appears utterly neglected.  Wife said women's room looked good.

Thought it discomfiting that the server did his side work in the main dining area during lunch. There was lots of silverware clanging around while we were trying to eat.

Will most likely return at a happy hour in the future.  Just hope they clean the men's room.  If not for the few things I dislike I would have given 4 stars.",j9WRXv8KavNF8OZF0KyHdw,0,0,3,3VXrOtA49OwrZupVPRXeFw

The only semi-negative thing was that our server was a little ""over the top."" Meaning, this person kept referring to us as ""loves."" It was just a little out of the ordinary. But as far as water refills were concerned, they were on top of it and we also ordered a bottle of wine that was refilled for us promptly. 

So! Here are the good things: 

LOTS of different options and variety. It is a little mix of modern American and Italian. Between the three of us we ordered: 
Caprese Salad
Crispy Gnocchi 
Shrimp Po Boy 
Fish Tacos 
Beet and Apple Salad

All of which were excellent and had no issues. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and delicious. The price was less than $10 for each dish which was great. Keep in mind that these items are all ""appetizer"" size compared to other restaurants.

The servers were very nice and the service was fast.  It was pretty busy today since there was an event happening, but they were on top of it!

I had the lobster bisque, spicy seafood pasta, and creme brulee. 

Good lobster bisque is hard to find.  The lobster bisque here was on point.  Tortilla chips and sour cream (optional) made it better.  

The spicy seafood  pasta was just as advertised: SPICY.  This has a generous amount and array of seafood such as mussels, clams, scallops, squid, and shrimp.  I would get this again!

The vanilla creme brulee was fantastic too!  It's big enough to share with 2 people.

Service: 3/5 Friendly but rather slow, especially considering the fact that there were really only like two other tables there

Food: We ordered the most recommended dishes...all good but none great...and aside from the gnocchi, I felt I could make the rest of what I had pretty easily at home. And no, I'm not a good cook.
-Crispy gnocchi: 4/5 good pesto, good gnocchi. but not exceptional
-meatball wrapped in date and bacon: 4/5 also just solid. 
-spicy seafood pasta: 3.5/5 good, but nothing special. I mean honestly, is spicy seafood pasta ever not good?
-dessert trio: 2/5 this fell pretty flat for me. The chocolate cake was meh. the creme brulee was meh. brulee was thick and hard, not light and crunchy. and creme was not super creamy...more eggy. ice cream utterly ordinary.

I still think it's a great restaurant for the area but unfortunately if these three things are the best dishes the Sparklings has to offer, I'm not that interested in coming back.",sfD1zmstTOpSoVMHYB7kYw,0,0,4,mfupxOWPFjPM6m56fevzBg

My family and I stopped in here for dinner. We wanted to try something new. There weren't very many people there on a Sunday night. The ambience is definitely not your run-of-the-mill. It's a wonderful combination of modern meets classic. An open, airy, yet sophisticated vibe.

With only a couple tables aside from ourselves, the service was pretty good. We were immediately brought waters by an employee, and our waitress was overall friendly. The drinks were great, too - very presentable. I had the BLUEBERRY MOJITO and it looked beautiful! My dad got a MOSCOW MULE and my sister a CHOCOLATE STOUT.

The only reason why I docked a star was because of the food. Don't get me wrong, it's good - as well as surprisingly affordable - but it's not the best I've ever had. For appetizers, we had the PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIES and the BACON & DATES WRAPPED MEATBALLS. The latter were a bit on the lacking end. They were just okay, the tomato sauce seemed like it needed more kick. As for entrees, my dad and I both got the CAJUN CHICKEN AND SHRIMP PASTA, my brother opted for the SPAGHETTI WITH MUSHROOM & BACON CREAM SAUCE, and my sister ordered the RIB-EYE STEAK, which she said she loved. She and my brother both finished their entrees; my dad and I took our leftover pasta to-go. I wasn't really feeling it. It just didn't have a congruent overall taste. 

We didn't have much room for dessert, so I can't comment on that. Overall though, we had a pleasant experience. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere made it worth it.",HcT3BZLc25R9eekoHBA1MQ,1,1,4,faMAD5Bud8DxdN8opUs5dw

I wish I could've given this place 5 stars!  The only mess up was the rib eye steak was over cooked and looked like it belonged in a $2.99 steak and egg special.

The wife and I shared truffle fries, meatballs, scallops, rib eye steak (which we sent back to the kitchen, and braised pork ribs.

The Truffles Fries were my favorite, plenty of garlic! Definitely tasted Asian fusion.

Meatballs were very good, could've been a little softer.  The marinara sauce was on the sweeter side, but I didn't mind it.

Scallops are a must!  Perfection indeed.  The seasoning and the way it was cooked was on point.

Ribeye was the worst part of our meal, and we had to send it back to the kitchen because it was cooked well done (we asked for medium).  There was no flavor and the look of the steak was ugly.

We replaced the steak with the braised pork.  The pork and sauce was amazing, and a huge rebound from the rib eye steak.

The food was hit or miss. The light and fluffy crispy gnocchi had great flavor and a nice variety of textures. Unfortunately, that was the highlight of the meal. The tuna tartare was dominated by an acidic and fruity flavor. The meatballs stuffed with dates and bacon were ok but the sauce lacked depth. Then there was the octopus... I like eating octopus when it's slices or chunks of large tentacles. The version here is presented as 3 tiny, whole octopi. I can't say I was a fan. Too chewy even for normal octopus standards.

The decor is a modern chic and very nicely done.  Whether you are coming in as a couple, a group of friends or even a large party, they have diferent size tables.  They also have a private dining area for up to 14.

Servers haven't had much training yet.  Rather a bit of ojt. Everyone was very friendly and helpful though.

The food was also pretty good.  To start,  appetizers: Definitely try the meatballs.  They are the bomb.  The pan seared gnocci was also good, but I would have preferred it with pancetta vs sausage.  On to entrees: my wife is very fond of braised ribs and these were good, but not as good as Roy's.   I had the jambalaya and it was ok, but was missing cayenne and andoille sausage.  It was a bit salty and and very tomatoish.  Nonetheless, I cleaned my plate.  Finally dessert:  The cheesecake is a must and the chocolate cake is good but rather heavy.

Overall, it was a very good meal and considering they are a week old, its safe to reason that they will continue to improve.

It would have been nice to see some sort of decoration on the tables to follow the theme.  The food was decent I order the Spicy Linguine Seafood Pasta. The seafood was fresh however I felt the dish was unbalance in flavor.  I will return at a later date to try some of the other menu items in hope of finding dishes that are more balanced in flavor.

First, the positives: 
1) gnocchi in pesto appetizer was awesome
2) food came out piping hot (and not the plate), love it
3) staff/manager came by multiple times after receiving our dinners to check on us
4) really like the well lit dining room including decor
5) wife had spaghetti w/meat sauce - appeared to have dissected a meatball or 2 for the sauce

The negatives:
1) took almost 10 minutes from being seated to having someone stop by the table to take a drink order (I understand busy, but my rule is if someone doesn't at least acknowledge your presence within first 10, roll out, was very close)
2) I had the jambalaya, and while shrimp/chicken were well represented, sausage was non-existent

Overall, will certainly return, too many appetizers to attempt and too little stomach availability on this visit.",RxhhGRyinyMbuBXAQrmf_g,0,0,4,XFPzRd267g_zK7EEcW8D4Q

3627867,2014-07-01,3,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I tried this place a couple days ago thinking it was new, but when I asked to waiter they've been open since last year. The decor was beautiful, the atmosphere was chill, and the food was amazing. The waiter was nice and friendly, but pretty average service. The place was quite empty when we arrived, so we got seated right away.

Me and my friends ordered beers, the sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, bruschetta, and caesar salad as our appetizers. I was a bit irritated that the bruschetta on the menu did not state that it had seafood in it, as one of my friends is severely allergic to seafood. Good thing I tried it before he did, and immediately tasted the crab meat. I suggest they change the menu and put stars next to their seafood products as an indicator, because it only says ""cream cheese, avocado, and onion"" as the toppings. It was still quite delicious, but my friend was the one who ordered it and couldn't even enjoy it or try it.

As our main course selections I ordered the spicy seafood pasta. It was the perfect amount of spice and the seafood tasted fresh! And I'm usually very picky with how I like my seafood. Two of my friends both ordered the bacon and mushroom pasta, which I tasted. It was also delicious. My other friend had the clam linguini, which he thought was delicious as well, although I didn't try any. 

Overall, I gave 4 stars because the atmosphere and food was really good. I enjoyed it and would come back again. The only reason I docked 1 star was because of the lack of labeling of which appetizers have seafood. If he took a bite of it before I did, we would have ditch that place and make a trip to the ER fast!! Luckily that didn't happen!",qIESkPmeAIvlsO-Gykzcwg,6,2,4,NlNJwMk2l9ShPddaBAFmhA

But even as everyone cleared out and I was waiting for my bill, and then change, I had to ask twice for someone to help me.

which makes the food/experience here even more amazing.....to think that restaurants known for Asian food could make American/Italian inspired food THIS good.


Again, this is spot caught my eyes and stomach once I saw it on Instagram. Came here after a night of shopping and movies with the boyfriend; and since it's right by his house, we stopped in to use up the GCs his family gave us.

You would never expect a shabby chic décorated restaurant in this log cabin exterior. So cute with open space, rustic furniture, romantic lighting, and a chandelier. This restaurant would be great for a first date or date night =)

We got there little past 10pm and the hostess said there was happy hour at the bar/lounge til closing = PERFECT!

We sat at the bar and our bartender, Anthony, was so friendly and great from the start. BF ordered beer and I ordered one (maybe 3 more) of the specialty cocktails that Anthony had recommended.

I can never say no to grilled octopus so that was the immediate choice for me; BF is a sucker for scallops; and our third app, crispy gnocchi, was chosen from its popularity on Yelp reviews. 
Octopus kind of shocked me because it was whole baby octopus. It didn't shock me because of the head or anything (I'm Asian, I've seen that before) but, only cuz I've only seen them served like that at Asian buffets...not nice/cute restaurants like this.
Anyways, the octopus was ok; scallops were superb but, the crispy gnocchi was my fave! Despite my dislike for pesto, this pesto sauce was pretty good...not to pesto(y) and very creamy!

I was quite full from all the apps but, we had to order the spicy seafood pasta and shrimp po'boy. The shrimp from the shrimp po'boy was crispy and had a good batter on it. Spicy seafood pasta was the hit of the night...Just enough kick and spice to my liking. Wish I could bathe in that sauce!

I can not rave enough about this place. Great local business with amazing food and even better workers.

I've loved all their food so far, except for the clam linguini (the sauce was a bit bland) but other than that, can't speak highly enough of this place. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive and you can tell they want you to keep coming back. Their flour-less chocolate cake is super rich and decadent and tastes GREAT with their espresso. Best dessert ever. The atmosphere is really interesting but difficult to describe. The ornate chandelier in the middle of the room turned us off at first, because we assumed it meant the food would be really expensive. Not so! The appetizers, sandwiches and pasta entrees are very reasonably priced. They do have more expensive steaks and things but I'm sure they're top grade and worth the money. (I haven't had their steak yet.) 

It does feel like they haven't quite found their ""niche"" yet (the type of music they play has changed a few times, the atmosphere is really neat but you can't quite tell what theme they're going for etc.), and while the waitstaff is friendly and attentive, they do feel short-staffed a lot of the time.

3726571,2015-01-11,2,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"1-10-15 - After having a pleasant late afternoon experience with Anthony at the bar, I decided to give it a try at 9:30 on a Saturday night.  The dining room was sparsely populated but the bar was a bit more active.

This is the kind of place you REALLY want to like.  It's beautiful. Great ambiance with the soft jazz music, lively but not loud but this is also the kind of place you expect to see on Gordon Ramsey's show with him yelling at the owners!

The problem... The Sparkings needs to decide what it wants to be and go at it whole hearted!  Why spend the money making something look nice and unique and then have mediocre to bad food?

Tonight i had the scallops. Perfectly cooked again although room temp.  I didn't mind but wished they were hotter.  I also had the truffle fries... truly THE WORST FRIES I have ever had in my life.  They were super dry like freezer burn and thank God the bartender suggested I get all the toppings on the side because they were disgusting.  The normal topping would have been the powdered, green can kind of parmasean, mayo with truffle oil and garlic (all garlic), ranch dressing and ketchup.  Nothing sent together and with bad fries at the base, it was just horrible.

My dining partner had chinese chicken salad, picked at it and said it was really bad.

I was going to order the cheesecake which I know is good (but it is not made on site) but at 11:30Pm they went from Jazz to Techno and that was it for me... and all the other people in the bar except for the six seemingly young gay men in the corner.

They are open until 3am so I asked about that. I was told a lot of service workers stop in to have ""great food"" and relax after work.  I'm not really sure what ""service workers"" want after a day of hard work but I'm pretty sure this is not it.

Oh yes... there was still a large table in the dining room at the same time there was a yellow mop bucket on wheels and a mop.  I got a shot of that.
Gordon Ramsey... where are you??? Help this place live up to it's potential!

If it's in business in 3 months I will be a surprise.

If you go, make sure you sit at the bar and ask for Anthony... he's the only real asset.

Owners... take yelp reviews seriously.  It's free advice and you don't have to hire a consultant to figure it out.  Cut your menu in half.  Use fresh ingredients.  have a few signature things.  Raise the prices if you half to.  Just do a few good things right and the crowds will follow.

The bar was the only part of the restaurant open so I'll cut the bartender some slack considering he was taking care of a lot of people but we had to go to the bar several times to get things like extra lemon or place a food order because he never came back to our table. Onto the food, probably the worst part. I ordered the French onion soup and the calamari. The soup literally looked like someone took a slice of square kraft cheese and melted it onto of a bowl full of salty water. The cheese was barely melted, when it should have had a slightly crispy brownish tint like all normal French onion soups. The calamari was equally as bad, it was soggy and tasted like someone defrosted it in the back and popped it into a microwave. Finally, I ordered the creme brûlée which was awful. The top sugar coat wasn't torched enough so there were a ton of parts that were not crunchy and just sugar sitting on the creme. The creme itself was bland and gross. Overall, I would never recommend this place to anyone. The bad service and disgusting food is plenty reason to avoid his place at all costs.",XcYOTqbY3Yr678gwWaHTJw,1,0,1,kJIz2JUTnNvn1cEChuFpmQ

I would have never expected a place like this from the owners of Oyshi and Soyo. Totally different aura and atmosphere from the others. There's a vintage hipster feel with a nice twist on the music.  Definitely a great place to bring a date or to celebrate a birthday with a group of friends. 

Now on to the important stuff. Food :)
We had an array of appetizers to start and ended up sharing a meal. We started with the langosta bruschetta which was to die for. Bread was perfectly crisp and didn't break into pieces when you bit into it. The added mango was a perfect addition to the topping.  We also had the sea scallops which had a little twist to them. Originally, I thought the entire plate was made up of only scallops but was soon to find out that they added crispy rice which when eaten with the scallop was amazing!   We also had the crispy gnocchi with pesto and walnuts which was also good and the fried zucchini. After trying all of the appetizers we could have skipped the zucchini. It wasn't bad but compared to the others it didn't compare. 

Lastly, we had the spicy seafood spaghetti. I am super picky with Italian food because I grew up with an Italian stepfather who could cook up a storm.  But I was so happy with this dish.  The spicy tomato sauce had a great kick and the taste was perfect to what I am used to. Spaghetti was al dente but I actually like it a little harder (if you know what I mean :). We ended this delicious meal with a perfect ending of creme brûlée. Equally as good as the rest.

The spicy seafood pasta was indeed spicy but not overwhelmingly so. I am sensitive to very spicy things. 6/10 for spicy but it was very flavorful and will be ordered again. 
The clam linguini was Good but not spectacular as the other dishes. 
The mushroom bacon cream pasta was delicious.  

The most enjoyable item we ordered was the crispy gnocchi but the whole meal was a delight.",nsHB3PSgkXLRGpg_nkMrdA,2,1,4,N-ig7Qns87i9nHUuVB6A9w

Came in around noon so it wasn't busy at all. The waiters were all very friendly. 

We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Garlic Fries (3/5). I have had better truffle parm garlic fries and there was nothing too special about these ones. The lemon dipping sauce was yummy though. 

My hubby ordered the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio (3/5). I give it a 3 only because it was something different for me and I just wasn't used to only having olive oil and garlic on my spaghetti. I like my pastas with a lot of saucy tomato-y or creamy flavor. But I would give it a try again. 

I ordered the Clam Linguine (4/5). I liked how they used real clams and not canned clams, it tastes so much better of course. The white wine sauce was really yummy and they gave a portion that was just right. 

Overall I think this place is really cute especially for big groups. The prices are reasonable and the service was good. Definitely coming back here again.",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,1,1,4,LfqCIbZguQsemA-2W6SdQw

My daughter ordered kids meal chicken fingers with fries and the chicken was tough & dry. She didn't even finished both of the chicken. I ordered Philly cheese sandwich which barely any meat inside & just too thick of bread. My son ordered 4 sliders that cost us $15. My husband said with his meal was OK but nothing special about it.

When we were at the bar it took a solid 15 minutes to get the servers attention for our order. When he finally came over to help they were out of what my BF tried to order and when I went to order they informed me they couldn't make my drink either because they don't make drinks with egg whites (no problem) but he just walked away instead of offering an alternative. When it came to trying to order again after figuring out what they did have that I wanted it took another few minutes to get his attention. We left the bar to a table and when the whole party was ready to order we started with a few appetizers. My BF and his friend ordered the Irish nachos, they were terrible! Imagine stale corn chips with cheese sauce and dry small slices of corned beef. The worst part was that there was barely any cheese sauce to cover the chips. They sat practically untouched until our main course came. The half chicken came with a wing, drumstick and thigh. Hardly a half chicken in my eyes but after digging in that was not the worst part. The chicken was extremely dry and hard to eat because the bones were still in it but it was drenched in a very salty sauce. When it's drenched in sauce and super dry there a problem. I would have sent it back but it took long enough as it was to get our food and it was a big party. I suggest not offering bones in your meals if you're serving it like a typical dish in a bowl drenched in sauce. We won't be back.",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,0,0,3,udZvrjVh6dntG3pbjNhvjQ

Let's start with the food. For appetizers I had the truffle fries, crab spinach dip with pita bread (fried and grilled), and the pesto gnocchi-- all appetizers are a 5/5 rating because they were super delicious! For my meal- my sister and I got the spicy seafood pasta (5/5 rating) with average spice level and it was the perfect spice-- not too light of a spice and it wasn't over the top spice. My sisters boyfriend got the ribeye steak which looked delicious but he said it may have been a little too ""fatty"" for him.. I didn't taste it so I'm not going to rate it but it looked good to me!

The decor in the restaurant was nice and not what I expected. I almost felt under-dressed walking into here with my leggings and slippers.

The customer service was on point! She was on it with recommendations and checked up on us regularly. 

I will DEFINITELY be back because there was so much more I wanted to try.... like the crab and shrimp ravioli. OH and they do brunch EVERYDAY until 3PM. I gotta try their brunch for sure!! This restaurant definitely did not disappoint me.",XX--i6RiqjGGTUg4XFNxfQ,0,0,5,0qYAZ2hlLUHk6SSy6WKxzA

The food is fancy and very good, kind of pricey but totally worth it! I am eating lunch here for the first time right now and so far so good. I actually discovered they have a more reasonably priced brunch menu (sat-sun) and lunch menu Monday through Friday. 

They also have a patio area with a lot of space and half of the bar is outside too.

Next was the brown butter gnocchi which tasted almost bland with a hint of bathroom freshener and had the texture of a semi-softened laffytaffy with a crunch in the beginning. The truffle fries were decent, nothing impressive. Tasted like store bought frozen fries. The spaghetti aglio e olio tasted like a cardboard with a hint of garlic. The rice au gratin with chicken tasted like trash. Disgusting. Honestly, I would've been better off making myself some pasta roni and rice a roni.

Ambiance really made me give this place 5 stars, it is so beautiful I think they may have even hired a design team. White furniture, with pistachio green cushions. The chandelier is the focal point of the restaurant and gives it the restaurant's name sake ""The Sparklings.""  I came on a Wednesday during lunch and it was totally empty. I guess this is more of a dinner spot, but surprisingly the server said they are kind of busy on the weekends, but not so much. Sort of surprising considering how amazing this place is. So definitely people give them your business! Now on to the food, to start our meal we ordered the seafood bruschetta, so delicious! Loved it and the drizzle of pesto sauce made the dish look even more appetizing. For my main entree I had the jambalaya, something I've never had before. It was pretty good, but I was expecting a little bit more spice and flavor to it. To me it just tasted like chicken, seafood and tomato paste mixed with white rice.  I think it was definitely missing something but I can't exactly put my finger on since it was my first time having it. I think maybe it needed a garnish of scallions on top and the dish itself could of used more garlic? It was only $13 which is very reasonable for me because it was the perfect portion size. All the prices here are very affordable, the most expensive thing is the filet mignon at $25, which I consider almost robbery. My friend had the beat salad which he enjoyed very much. We shared the cheesecake as our dessert, this was totally store bought cheesecake and the server even admitted it not being made on site. I wish they had more dessert options, but the flour-less cake sounded good, I might have to order that next time.

He still enjoyed it. We had the dessert sampler at the end, and enjoyed everything. The standout was the in-season fruit sorbet, however, which was mango that day. It was perfect.

As soon as I walked into the restaurant I was super excited, the ambiance was fantastic and the menu looked amazing. However I was quickly disappointed by the service and the lack of cleanliness of the bathrooms. 

We started our really good and quickly got water, but I soon found myself out of water and stealing other waters from empty seats. I went through three water glasses and not once did anyone refill or even offer to refer my glass. We had pitchers on our tables but they quickly ran out of water too. 

On top of that, it took them an hour to get my food either because the waitress forgot to put in the order or the chef forgot to make it, I'm not sure which one it was. I ordered chicken and waffles and a pineapple juice as soon as I sat down, and with the rest of the group as they ordered, and it wasn't until the rest of my group had had their food and basically finished it that the waitress asked me what I ordered. I never got my pineapple juice but I did get my chicken and waffles. I had to get it to go because I was on a time crunch, and the waitress was nice enough to comp it, but it really didn't make up for it. 

On top of that the bathrooms were disgusting. Water and liquids everywhere, soggy paper towels on the ground and rags sitting around in the stalls and on the sink. I started gagging as soon as I walked in and I held my breath the entire time I was in there. I honestly could not believe how horrible it was, especially for a restaurant that is more upscale than most. 

Overall it was a horrible experience. I will not be back and I will not recommend this spot for any future brunches going forward. Avoid at all costs!",yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,7,1,1,B2jyA6kZuXytQdJdbaAZzQ

The bar also has a great Moscow mule, which I highly recommend you get right away as you wait for your party to arrive or the rest of the table to determine what they want to eat. 

To start, we ordered the scallops and bruschetta. Both were tasty.  However, I would say the scallops were a bit small from what I am used to. But, the price was fair. It is a decent amount to share between two people. I got the clam chowder. It is not the best, but not the worst. it was an okay bowl of chowder. The soup was creamy and had a decent amount of clams in it. However, nothing beats the chowder you get in San Francisco! But it was worth a taste. 

My friend and I shared a pasta carbonara with the noodles cooked well and extra sauce on the side. It was a big plate that was more than enough to share. It was so big, we still had some leftover! The pasta was cooked well. The bacon on top was delicious. The sauce was creamy and rich like it should be. I recommend getting this for sure if you plan on going. 

This is a classier place that is just off the strip. The drive is a bit far since it is deep in the southwest area of Las Vegas just 8 minutes before you actually hit Blue Diamond. The servers were nice, but it's hard to find a place that does not treat you well in Las Vegas.The drinks are reasonable for the type of dining experience. The seafood tasted fresh and was cooked well. The noise level was okay. When we went it was not busy at all, but I would still make a reservation, especially on the weekends.

I was craving wings, so I ordered their Grilled Ginger Soy wings, in addition to the fried calamari, bacon wrapped meatballs, zucchini sticks, and steak salad my friends ordered. 

When you order a variety of items, there is bound to be some hit and misses, as I experience here. For example, the ginger soy wings tasted quite good, but I could not get over the fact how tiny them wings were. I had to struggle to find chewable meat on them bones. I am not kidding, I worked those bones substance, but good thing the flavor was there. 

The fried calamari was good. It was lightly fried and breaded. The calamari inside was tender and sweet as it should be. Well done. The bacon wrapped meatballs were okay. I liked the marinara they came in because it had a good balance between acidity and sweetness, but the meatball itself was to, how would I put it, mushy I guess. It needed texture and density. The flavor was good, and so was the bacon it came wrapped in but, it was almost as if it had to much moisture in it. 

The fried zucchini stick were pretty good, although they did exhibit a water inside of them, which leads me to believe they ""may"" have been previously frozen. They tasted good and had a nice crunch, but I could literally squeeze them and watch the water drain from them. 

Service was very good and quite attentive. This place no doubt has potential, and perhaps it's already there, but I would refine some of the items I had on this visit. More importantly, some plumper wings would be much appreciated.",WG3w_73scm_JUWJ_3Lgn0Q,6,7,3,XUVSMF4BGzuKDAgfaQa7GA

I don't understand why this place isn't busier. I've only eaten here once, but my fiance and I frequent the pho restaurant next door and the parking lot seems to always be empty here..

Myself, my fiance, and a friend strolled in around 5pm one a weekday and were literally the only people in the place. (At first I thought they were only open for dinner and had just opened, but then noticed they are actually open for lunch as well.)

We sat in the dining room, which is beautiful!! Very classy and inviting. Our server (who was also the bartender) was very attentive and accommodating. After we came in, she had 5 other tables consecutively come in (sitting in the dining room and bar area) and she handled it beautifully, without neglecting us in the process. I'm a bartender also, and for her to handle all that on her own without being in the weeds is pretty impressive. Especially since there was no food runner. 

Our friend ordered ribs with mashed potatoes, corn bread (I think) and veggies. Fiance had spicy seafood pasta. They both loved what they had. 

I love this place because the menu is huge!! I'm a vegetarian, so I'm used to maybe having 3 options to choose from, one of which is a salad, and the other two being a meat dish that I have to modify. Not the case here!! SOOO many options it was hard to decide. I went with the cucumber salad and a vegetable quesadilla without the tortilla. Salad was fresh and delicious. Since I ordered the veggie quesadilla without the tortilla, I just expected a bowl of vegetables with some shredded cheese thrown in (which would have been fine), but the chef loaded it with cheese, I guarantee gave me more veggies than would have come in it the regular way, and baked the whole dish. It was AMAZING. The fact that it was automatically made that way without me asking was even better. And... IT'S CHEAP!! You wouldn't guess it based on the decor, but it is very reasonably priced. We live down the street and will DEFINITELY be returning to try more stuff. I have recommended it to all my industry people to hopefully get them some more business!",PTfIcx4u7-VaDRaGp0mAdQ,1,0,5,afZ02vC8EpkKpHx9IlJaPw

The service was excellent. We got everything we needed without missing a beat. This was impressive with 3 toddlers in the group. 

Aside from a lovely room and great service, the food delightful and quite a value! Hubby and I shared clam chowder, scallops with crispy rice cakes and lemon buerre blanc, linguini and clams, and crispy gnocchi. We also got a side of fries and a beer. All for under $50! The gnocchi was creamy and delicious. A healthy portion for the $9 price. The scallops were good but nothing special. The sauce lacked the citrusy zing I was hoping for. Chowder was good with light airy crispy bread to dip. Linguini and clams was a winner. Flavorful and al dente. There was so much more I wanted to try! We will definitely go back.

4023986,2017-12-31,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,I came across this restaurants by looking up under rated Las Vegas restaurants because I was tired of waiting in long lines for over priced food. The Sparklings is a great restaurant if you are willing to get away from the strip for some reasonably priced good food. They are an American bistro that makes a mean pasta and a delicious cocktail. My family really enjoyed this restaurant especially compared to our previous dining experiences in Vegas. Appetizers were a little small hard to share with 11 unless you order 2 of each. The crispy gnocchi had great flavor in the sauce but I felt like the texture was just like normal gnooci nothing crispy about it. Portions of entrees are fairly large. I had a hard time finishing my spicy seafood pasta which was delicious. The Cajun pasta and bacon mushroom cream pasta were also great. In the end they gave me and my family complementary cheese cake to help celebrate me and my cousins birthday! Once again super glad we got to escape the chaos that is the Vegas strip and got to celebrate in a more intimate place with good food that didn't break the bank!

The carte was extensive and after saying, i am looking for something VEGAN. The servet bartender point me at couple suggestions, no main dishes but I went for the pasta with olive oil and garlic. Food arrived to the table. Evetything look good, mothing special and exciting but fresh and everybody was happy. My pasta was absolutly delicious and i even say "" that wasv he best pasta I ever ate."". The sauce was pretty thick and i had hard time to believe it was not butter. One of my friend said: if this is good, its because of the butter. Then I adked the server who vonfirm it was no butter, just olive oil, but went to check with the chef to make sure. Came back to the table and redescribe tge pasta : they are made with Extra virgin oil, garlic, white wine, and CHIKEN STOCK.  You must see my face and the good laught of my friends. To be honest I was not even angry, it was so big and laughable... I said, thats good, at least there is no butter.  Price are good to. When we went out, everybody had the same reflection about the lighting. The lighting is Horible ! Please hire a professionel to adap the apropriate watts dosage for your restaurant.

The decor seems nice: lots of lighting, modern, clean, nice and roomy. Service was actually superb despite what the negative review said. We were constantly checked and the staff were extremely cordial. I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my friend ordered the herb roasted chicken, as appetizers we also got the plate of cheese and fried zucchini. The menu looked delicious, but it's one of those restaurants that the food looked better than it tastes. I'm not sure why, but it definitely lacked that ""umami"" better tasting places offer. I don't want to give a such bad review, but while the food wasn't complete garbage, it was mediocre at best.

To top it off, my friend also had SEVERE food poisoning about 12 hours afterwards. I'm in the medical field and checked my resources with all facts pointing in the direction of food poisoning. We ate around 10 and the symptoms started the next morning around 10, with multiple bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. Actually, it reminded me of this family guy episode where they were trying to see who can drink the most ipecac, which of course resulted in everyone throwing up on top of each other. The episode was hilarious, but unfortunately it cannot be said for real life. Nothing was consumed hours before or after the meal, and there were no other culprits. We're not entirely sure but it seems all signs point to the chicken, which was possibly badly handled during the cooking.

In the end, we were both pretty disappointed at our visit. We should have stuck with one of our regulars. Needless to say, we definitely won't be coming back.",1Rrbrr16vEI9fGhYKOVOGQ,1,0,2,ngW0qDzKupRjdzp_MDXkfg

Although the restaurant was quiet empty the host gave us an option to sit in the bar area since we had a party of 14 people and he said it would be faster service if we sat there. Reluctantly we agreed to sit there.  The ambience was amazing, i loved the decor. However the food was nothing but average and the service was still terrible even though there were barely any people. 
The second time was more recently. I solely decided to go back because i love the ambience. upon entering we saw the restaurant was completely empty on a friday night. We sat in the dinning area. With just one server managing the bar area and the dining area needless to say the service yet again was terrible. 
My boyfriend ordered a quesadilla without the chicken ( we confirmed the order to ensure there were no errors due to him being a strict vegetarian)  and I ordered mashed potatoes and club sandwich. The mashed potatoes were good but just a bit dry. The club sandwich was just terrible and to top it off they gave us chicken in the quesadilla . Unknowingly my boyfriend who is a vegetarian ate a whole piece before we saw a piece of chicken in the quesadilla. We waited a good 10 minuets before we went upto the owner who was fixing the door and asked him to send the server. The server was busy at the bar area and came over 10 minuets later, by this time we were just sitting waiting and the food was completely cold. The server apologized and rushed to the kitchen and said they messed it up. He then brought out a veggie quesadilla and that was it. No apologies by the owner, nothing was taken off our check, no words were exchanged we just paid and left. I was highly disappointed that they did not even understand the extent of disappointment they caused for someone who has been a vegetarian their whole life.

The only real shame was the restroom.  The ladies restroom was a complete travesty and disgusting.  I went to walk in the large stall since I am pregnant and I had to walk directly out.

4179875,2015-06-14,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"First time here for my husband and I. I read the reviews a few months ago and kept telling myself that I eventually want to check this place out. Plus I drive past it all the time because I live right down the road. Finally my husband and I had a free night to check it out. Its a pretty small place. Not very intimate. From some of the other reviews I read people have said its 'beautiful'. If you look up there are fans and almost like a warehouse ceiling. A huge chandelier hangs in the middle that pretty much looks out of place. Between the fans and warehouse looking ceiling the chandelier doesnt look like it belongs there. The bar area looked decent it was more busy than the actual restaurant. Seems to me this place would make a better bar lounge possibly local dance place instead of a wanna be classy bar/restaurant. The middle could possibly be a big dance floor. But thats just my opinion. 

The food was decent. My husband had a Club sandwitch which he said was tasty. We both had clam chowder which was really good minus he fact the waiter never offered crushed pepper for my husband soup. Waiters should always offer crushed pepper for soup. My husbands soupspoon had dried up food on the one side of it. Which was pretty disgusting. I called over the waiter and he apologized and replaced it with a 'tea spoon' I'm guessing all of the soup spoons were gone.We also ordered the calamari off the appetizers. It wasn't very good...possibly not cooked enough and the marinara sauce that came with it had zero flavor. I wasn't impressed by the calamari at all. I ordered a Caesar salad which was very dry needed more dressing but the waiter took too long to come by so I just ate it that way. This place was ok. I wont recommend it to any of my friends due to the fact that there are better places around town with much better calamari and atmosphere. It will be one of those place I go to if I want to be close to home so I dont need to drive far but its not my favorite. It wasnt horrible but it wasnt as great as I expected. Sometimes you dont know how places are just by reading yelp reviews you need to go there and see for yourself.

First things first, I was meeting 3 of my friends and her newborn baby there, yes they were a little bit late but I let the guy know I needed a table for 4 he said no problem so instead of seating me prior to my friends getting there like most places would do he made me wait til they got there and then as soon as they got there we waited another 10 minutes to finally be seated. It was around 1:40 last Sunday March 3rd. Our waiter was the absolute rudest thing and strutted around the restaurant like he was the owner (I would certainly hope not) or some royalty of some sort. He was very dry and kept calling us ""babe"" or ""baby"" sorry but I'm not your girlfriend and you shouldn't be addressing customers that way. I was so upset at how slow it was taking them to bring my friend sugar, SUGAR nothing special just SUGAR, her coffee started to get cold and finally the busser advised he would bring some over along with a new coffee for my friend. I literally didn't want to be there anymore after waiting 30 minutes for the waiter to come back and take our older. I ordered the cheapest simplest thing on the menu (mind you we were going to go all out on brunch but not after that experience). Finally after another 30 minutes my Caesar salad made with Tysons brand striped chicken strips you can get in the meat dept arrived. The busser brought over the pepper shaker only for the whole pepper to fall completely all over my lap and salad. I was so ready to leave. The bathroom was disgusting, toilet paper on the floor, water splashed over the sink. I had to track down our ""waiter"" to get our check, he was up front just gossiping with the girl up there. I was really looking forward to coming to this place after hearing praise about it but not after my experience.

The bacon & date wrapped meat balls should be renamed ""amaze-balls.""

Their BBQ ribs are also the most meaty, tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs you will ever have. Way better than you would even get at a place that specializes in ribs.

Honestly, I've never had anything bad here.

The only complaint I have is with the BBQ Pork sliders, and even then not with the sliders themselves. They will allow you to order them as a single sandwich for a couple bucks more, which is great, because the sliders are awesome. However, every time I've ordered them as a single sandwich, it has been served completely differently each time. Once stuffed in an interesting kind of hoagie roll, another time on toast... This time they served it as if it was their grilled chicken sandwich, but with the pork instead of the chicken (meaning it had toppings that simply do not belong with BBQ pork). I'll probably go back to ordering them as sliders due to that inconsistency.",PlwUXJjUVYFrOrjHwAt6iA,1,0,4,HLUBiIKT7Fn2Z0ClRypkZQ

When I first walked in the big sparkly chandelier caught  my eye like most things that sparkle. I loved that the decor was elegant and the menu was affordable. This allowed me to try more items on the menu.

I started with the French Onion Soup which was amazing! The broth , the bread and the gooey cheese made the best French Onion soup I've had to date. I was also curious about grape, basil and ricotta flat bread so I definitely had to order that! It was also topped with candied walnuts, arugula (my favorite)  and drizzled with balsamic. It had that sweet and savory taste to it. I folded mine and ate it like a sandwich so nothing would fall off to the side. It's a great appetizer because it's light and leaves room for your entree. Since I just had my wisdom teeth taken out I needed a very soft entree. I chose the Rice Au Gratin with chicken. It was creamy, rich and fit the bill . The portions were big enough for me to take some home for lunch the next day. 

The Sparklings is a wonderful place for a date and special occasions.The dishes are great for sharing so everyone can order something different and you can experience an array of entree's and appetizers.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,4,4,5,9tMd0YxK960qv7zLG-sqMQ

4533414,2016-04-07,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Review is for visit on 4-2-16 around 4pm. Friday afternoon, place was pretty dead. We sat at the bar to have some food, and at the time there was only one other person at the bar. 

The bartender Rey was personable and seemed attentive at first. My friend ordered a spicy pasta dish and gnocchi appetizer (see pics) and I ordered grilled salmon with capers served over rice. It was supposed to come with a cream sauce, but since I wanted a healthy entree I requested no sauce. Bartender acted like oookaaay as if to imply it was not going to be good without sauce.  I thought oh great, it's going to be dry! But when the meal came out, I thought it was perfectly fine without the sauce.

The salmon was tasty and moist. Serving size was maybe around 3 1/2 oz, with a nice presentation on a small bed of rice. I think it is slightly overpriced at $20 though. Not a big enough portion for $20. It didn't need the capers in my opinion, it had enough flavor. 

My friend was satisfied with her app and meal. We were only ordering water as we had been out in the sun all day. Unfortunately my friend had to ask for a water refill, my glass was almost empty and bartender didn't even fill my glass when he refilled hers. Sort of basic to fill both of them at once, isn't it? He didn't have a ton of people to wait on but for whatever reason getting our check and taking our money took a very long time. Sorry that we aren't drinking today...? 

I liked the atmosphere of the place, the food was fine but nothing magical that made me want to come back anytime soon. The restaurant part is beautifully decorated with a gorgeous chandelier.

The food was decent, nothing super spectacular.  Apparently they only have a few tea pots, so a few ladies (including the mom to be) couldn't get tea because they had them all out with the *other* baby shower luncheon that was going on across the dining room.

The last time we were here, everything took forever! There was about 13 of us for a birthday. All of our food came out at completely different times, so some people in our party were almost done eating by the time others were just getting their food. We had to ask for basic things like silverware. One of our people arrived late and nobody asked her if she wanted anything to drink or gave her a menu. Members of our party had to request all of these things for her. We also asked to add another table because we were seated very close together and they refused to add one, even though there were plenty empty tables. 

Now the food. Some of the food was great! The appetizers were tasty. The main dishes, however, were not. My friends ""roasted"" chicken looked like an under-boiled nasty mess. He asked for some Tabasco and was told that the food should already be spicy enough.....another friend ordered truffle fries and never got them and later had to have the server take the charge off the bill. My husband's chicken risotto wasn't good either.

Overall, it seems that this place spent more effort on décor than they did training their staff on service and cooking.

I see the manager Andy,  apologizing for all the other bad comments but obviously not DOING anything to make it better.  We were talking in the car on the way home that the Food is AWESOME, the prices are GREAT,  but the Slooooow and RUDE service makes it almost unbearable.  The restaurant was not even full and it was like pulling teeth to get service.  I finally yelled out ""SERVICE"" across the room.  and the rude waitress, Susan, who had been ignoring us all night,  looked my way and flipped her head and walked the other way.  If this place could delivery snappy fast drinks and pleasant service they would have a line out the door and not always be half empty.  
Normal wait staff pleasantries were non existent, even from the gal who tried to help our disappearing waitress,  like bringing salt, a glass, a plate, taking away dirty plates, fixing a drink, delivering food and drinks in a timely fashion, making sure everyone got their food at the same time.  We were not expecting anything exceptional in service,  just normal things when you go to a decent restaurant.  
It's Sooooo sad and disappointing to see good potential RUINED by staff who could care less about the guest experience.  On the good side, every bite of food I've had there is very good.  Langostina bruschetta, caprese salad,  chicken marsala, ceviche,  gnocchi, scallops and more.  With the groups I've taken there, we have tasted all that and more,  and its all good.

We ordered for Gorgonzola flat bread, calamari, chipotle chicken pasta and pesto linguine. 

Presentation - I was disappointed receiving our appetizers. It looked like our flat bread was microwaved however main dishes were ok.

Quality of food - the food was good. I was however disappointed at how watered down the sauce with calamari was. I would dip my calamari in the sauce and it was dripping like it was deluded with water. 

Price - price was fair. It was a nice restaurant and very clean so the food and ambiance was nice.

Service - not the best. I'm not sure if our waiter wasn't serving everyone by himself, service would have been better. The water tastes horrible, the soda was stale and I had to request a refill on my drinks.

I've also gone at different times and days and it's always the same. The host will seat you just fine but service from there isn't the best.

Our server was Jason and he was great he was very interested in our little baby and was quick with the order refills and making conversation. We wanted to try some different plates so we got the calamari and scallops for appetizers. The calamari was pretty basic but my gf asked for remoulade which I thought was better then the marinara. The scallops were pretty good but I don't feel you get enough since half the pieces are the rice. For our actual menu I got the chicken wings and she got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. The chicken wings were alright but like some people have said I think they would be better with some crisp in them. Pasta was quote ""soooo good"" but since I'm not a fan of spicy I opted out. For dessert we of course got the trio sampler and the creme brûlée was delicious although the flourless cake id really rename ""fudge"" all in all we will come back eventually. Cheap food, expensive feel, and great service.",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,0,0,5,St1oLh-H6lgCivO14hZXog

4683698,2013-11-22,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I don't know, maybe I came in on a off night.  I'm certainly willing to give them another try, but here is what I experienced on my visit. 

On first impression, I love the décor and feel of the restaurant. They got that 100% right. However, there was something missing that I couldn't put my finger on...that night (Wednesday) it wasn't very busy so there was no hustle/bustle to give the place a warm vibe or maybe it was the sound system and how the music didn't really fill the room.  Not sure, but it felt like we were the last table in a restaurant that was about the close for the night. Just a little too quite.

I'd actually give the food 3/4 stars. It was decent. I think my favorite was the crispy gnocchi and would love to see that as a meal...it was darn good. 

Where the night went wrong was partly due to the staff.  It wasn't that they were not friendly, they were, just inexperienced and their ""professionalism"" seemed forced, which if they are new to serving tables I understand it takes time to get your mo-jo going. Our appetizers came out on time and when I asked the person who delivered them (not our server) what type of bread came with the spinach and crab dip, as there were two different types served, his answer was, ""I don't know. I can ask the chef if you want"".  I feel like if you work at a restaurant and you are one of the people that brings food to the table, you should be well aware of the menu and what is on it. Maybe it was his first night on the job...who knows. At least he offered to ask the chef, I guess. 

After the appetizers my soup came out and then shortly after he said our entrees would be out shortly.  They then delivered one entrée followed by about a 10 minute wait...there was four of us in the party, so we were waiting on 3 more entrees.  They then delivered one more entrée, still nothing on the other two, just apologies for the wait.  I even asked the waiter what was the hold up on the entrees, to which he answered ""I'm not sure, let me ask them"".  Hummm...we've been waiting now for 15 minutes + just to get out entrees served and you are apologizing, but you don't know why you are apologizing. When our entrees finally did come out the manager (I assume) finally gave us the reason...our steaks had been over cooked and they had to redo them.  Which, if they would have told us that right from the get go then I would have been understanding to the wait.  Also, while we were waiting during all of this the manager brought out a free appetizer, the spinach and crab dip, which we had already had.  It was a nice gesture, but also shows that there was no communication between the server and manager.  Why bring a table something they've already tried? Why not ask us what we would prefer considering we were the ones inconvenienced. 

I hope it does improve and will go back another time over a weekend, perhaps to see if I can have a better experience.",J3q3TPRJ6S7LoWgkeMXj3A,4,0,2,W-87YKC8NwUsU7IpvAQK9w

So, we came in around 8. There were a lot of us & im sure we were a confusing group of people to serve lol. But they didn't start taking our orders until 9. We practically sat there for an hour waiting... I'm not sure if it was cos they were waiting for every single person in our party to come or what. At least I wasn't alone waiting for an hour. Anyways, my friend ordered an appetizer & forgive me, idk what it's called but a picture will be posted. The flavor was amazing! I wouldn't have wanted to order it by just looking at the description lol but I'm glad she did. I ordered the spaghetti with bacon & mushroom cream sauce & we shared that. Hugeeee portion & a pretty heavy meal, but definitely a must try. Our other friend ordered the crispy gnocchi since we saw it was a favorite on Yelp. I didn't really care much for it. I guess I had high expectations for it but they weren't met. & for dessert, I got the tempura ice cream (coffee). This was very well fried. Not too much tempura overpowering the ice cream & it was crispy, not floury.

We had a larger party with a reservation. I think it is common that the servers just automatically give everyone a water and then asks for separate drink orders. They only gave a few people waters, I asked for refills, and some people did not get their drinks they ordered. The cocktails were very diluted and multiple drink orders had to be remade. The servers all seemed very rushed and did not provide a welcoming environment. One person in our party ordered a steak, it wasn't cooked right so it was sent back. Our entrees did not come out at the same time and one guest did not get his entree until about 10 minutes after everyone else got their food. We also brought in a cake for a birthday. No one informed our party of a cake cutting fee and we were charged one. Not only that, the staff lost the box to the cake so it had to be carried home without a box.

I loved all of the little pieces they have in there. Totally not expecting that. Plus, the host was pretty good looking, too. Heyy! 

First things ordered were drinks.  My first drink, which, according to the host, was a favorite, tasted like medicine. I don't know, maybe the people like the taste of Benadryl with their dinner, but that was not for me. I then ordered, and sang ""Return of the Mack."" couldn't help myself.  That was a little better.  

Since I wasn't that hungry, I ordered crab dip which cam with pita chips.  My meal was tasty.  I also ate off other peoples plates.  The truffle fries are really good. So was the pasta.  It had a nice flavor to it.  Wasn't bland at all.

I wanted to try everything so we mainly got appetizers and one entree. We ordered Lobster bisque, which came with onion crisps and a dollop sour cream, which honestly i think the lobster bisque was fine by itself and didnt need all those extras. My favorite part about the calamari was the marinara sauce. Truffle fries were great but i did think the garlic chunks were kind of big. I couldn't get enough of the Clam Linguini with a light cream sauce, that was definitely my favorite dish.

The drink i ordered was the Cumcumber Frenh, a mix of gin, champagne and cucumber juice, very refreshing.

The food definitely did not disappoint. The service, on the other hand, was not the best. Having worked in the service industry in the past, I can understand how a short staff can really hurt service, so I was sympathetic to the fact that they were down a few people. When the crowd finally thinned out, however, we were still left wondering when someone would come and bring the check. As the last patrons in the dining area, we were still somewhat over looked. At one point, we observed the staff sitting at a table doing their side work. Not cool. Nobody was rude, they just didn't match service with atmosphere and food quality. That's a shame too because I'd love to tell people to give this place more business. If they are not staffed well enough to take care of their patrons, I can't safely say the trip would be worth it. Unless you're just a foodie without high expectations for service. 

As far as the food goes, the tartar was tasty. The flatbread was fulfilling. The scallops were scrumptious. The spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce was sinfully satisfying. So good, in fact, that one of the people I was dining with, after eating her meal, ordered a plate for herself.

When I walked in, I met the co-owner who used to manage the Oyshi restaurant located a couple blocks down the road. We went there during peak dinner time on the weekend but the restaurant wasn't crowded, but that could be because the restaurant has only been opened for a few months. There was a lot of people at the bar though.

Anyway, the place was nice and clean and the service was top notch. I looked at the menu and the prices are not cheap, kind of on the mid-tier level. Anyway, we ordered some appetizers and some entrees and here are our takes on it:

All the appetizers we ordered were excellent. The grape flatbread was ""da bomb"" and so was the grilled octopus and the scallops. We wanted to eat more of them after we devoured all in a very short time. As for the entrees, let just say that we were disappointed after starting out so well with the appetizers.

The steak was overcooked and dried, the spicy seafood pasty was kind of bland and under-seasoned and not spicy at all. 

Overall, it's decent and close to my house and that's why the 3 stars. I will come back but most likely I will just order the appetizers, especially the flatbread, and not the entrees.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,3,MJJNTzB50EeZqFC3auojsw

The food was mediocre. We absolutely will not be returning (I promise) and we will not be recommending this place to anyone.",iPka2rZeJ2aQ0Q9YJZ-umw,5,0,2,3mud-mM9SstPqqe_q1TAGA

4926303,2014-09-23,2,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"We came in on Friday night for date night, not really sure what to expect except what we had read on Yelp. It was pretty busy so we couldn't get a seat in the bar area. The dining room was busy too so we grabbed a drink while we waited for a table to open up. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink, and by that time a table had opened up for us. Our server, Clayton, was super nice even though he seemed a bit frantic. 

We ordered crispy gnocchi, bacon-wrapped meatballs, spicy seafood pasta and the short ribs. Everything was fantastic, except the pasta was JUST OK. It was good, it just tasted like something I could easily make at home and there wasn't that much seafood in it. 

The ambiance is a bit strange. It's beautiful inside, but also kind of weird at the same time. The decor doesn't completely mesh, but somehow it's still cozy. I will say though, they should turn the music up a notch and dim the lights a notch as well. 

For our drinks, we ordered the bourbon mule, which I surprisingly liked even more than the vodka version, moscow mule. Clayton never left us hanging and checked on us JUST enough. At the end of the meal, our bill was about $75, which is not bad at all. We will definitely be coming back but we decided this is more of a hang out in the lounge and order a few drinks and food items from the apps list, not so much a romantic dinner type place.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,7,3,4,djbeBAkIK9Fh6Rw43OXLog

The service was good. Had to wait a bit long for our waiter to take our drink order, the busser seemed to pick up were he was too busy.
The ambience is ok. Too bright for dinner in the dinning room and not cozy. Stale shabby chic. The restroom also not very clean and run down.

4974422,2014-01-10,9,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"The Sparklings is one of the newer restaurants to have opened in the southwest area, courtesy of the owners of Soyo and Oyshi, which are just down the road.  Walking in, it's hard to not be impressed with the dramatic transformation this space has taken.  I almost felt a bit under dressed with the ornate chandelier dominating the open eating area and a bit concerned pushing my stroller in with a crying baby inside. We had our choice of seating and opted for a corner spot to minimize any distractions.  (I noticed the generous amount of high chairs available, which to me encourages a family-friendly restaurant.)

With a quick glance at the menu, we ended up just ordering appetizers.

* Crispy Gnocchi ""creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas, crushed candied walnuts"" ($7.50) - This was good, worthy of making this a meal by ordering two. (Update! I actually did this the following week and it was too much for one person. It's pretty rich, and two orders to yourself is quite a bit. And my gnocchi wasn't as 'crispy' this time. In retrospect, 'crispy' may be a bit misleading. It's more 'browned' than 'crispy'. Nonetheless, it wasn't as 'browned' in the to go order.)

* Grilled Octopus ""soy marinated"" ($7) - Three little octupi sat on the plate along with some greens.  I like grilled octopus in general, so we liked this dish.  It can be a bit daunting for those not wanting to see the head of a baby octopus.

* Seared Diver Scallops ""lemon beurre blanc"" ($7.50) - I didn't realize this dish had other items on it besides scallops, so was confused by the texture in my mouth when I thought I eating scallop. I guess along with the scallops were tater tot like disks.  The sauce was a bit fruity.

* Truffle Parmesan Fries ""sea salt, parsley, lemon garlic sauce"" ($6) - It came with two dipping sauces and the chunks of garlic were falling off.

* Portobello Fries ""lightly breaded"" ($6) - This also came with two dipping sauces.

* Roasted Beet and Apple Salad ""arugula, candied walnuts, balsamic vinaigrette"" ($8) - We like beet salads, but it seemed like this salad missed a little something.  They did shave some Parmesan cheese on there, but maybe it needed more nuts?

* Clam Linguini ""surf clams, roasted garlic, garden herbs, Italian parsley & white wine extra virgin olive oil broth"" ($13) - We took this dish to go for my mom.  She's a big fan of clam linguine and the first thing she noticed was the amount of clams.  She gobbled up the dish and even saved the sauce for the next day.  (She said it was good, but there wasn't enough for the price.) (Update! The Husband obviously liked what he saw when we ordered this for my mom. So the following week he got an order to go!)

Service - The staff were attentive, perhaps even too attentive.  I appreciate more than less, so I can't complain too much.  The restaurant wasn't busy, so they were coming around a lot to ask how things were and if we wanted to order more.  The owner (one of the partners) came around to see how we were doing too. I appreciate when the owners take an active part in their new business ventures because it can show a genuine interest in their clientele, especially if they become regulars.  He mentioned that this was a family-friendly restaurant, which we do appreciate (and noticed a kids' menu available too).

Overall, we like The Sparklings but are a bit confused.  It's very upscale in appearance, but a mix of casual in the menu.  I think they can actually expand on the menu a bit more, and perhaps they will with time.  But for the time being, we just couldn't find anything in the entrees that interested us.  (Items ranged from sandwiches like Philly Cheese Steak ($8.50) and Shrimp Po Boy ($8.50) to pastas, salmon and meats, ie. Rib-Eye Steak ($25) and Filet Mignon ($25).

They do offer a happy hour in the lounge/bar area from 5 pm to 10 pm daily, which means discounted drinks.  Only those over 21 years of age allowed into the restaurant after 11 pm.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,23,18,4,Y2talkrjOnHjh3NBKBq4vQ

5016560,2018-03-11,2,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I loved our dining experience here. My husband and I moved here from Chicago and feel like it's truly difficult to find nice restaurants in the neighborhood without having to go downtown. You're left with a lot of chains in the suburbs, but the Sparklings really hit the mark on food quality and service. 

      Now, when we go out, it's typically just the two of us. We also make reservations in advance, and overall try to avoid the peak times. These are all things that are simply common sense if you want to ensure expedient service. 

 If you go in a big party, your food will take longer, because of all the orders from your table being made, this isn't a chain with prepackaged foods, that's why you came here instead of your local Outback or whatever.

       If you didn't make a reservation, and walk in on a Friday night, you're going to have to wait for a table. 

If you come in on Sunday morning for bottomless mimosas like every other Becky in the restaurant, don't expect it to be refilled the instant you  guzzle that bottom of the barrel champagne because ""you want to get your moneys worth"". 

Now I'll admit, there are places I'll never return to based on repetitive occurrences of poor quality, or just absolutely abysmal service,  but reading some the 1 star reviews, I can not believe the entitlement.

Most of the reviewers that give 1 star I find, basically always give 1 star.

Honestly, you can't take anyone serious who has more than half of their reviews being 1 star. 

Like, if you always have a bad service experience when you go out, look at the common denominator! 
What's the x factor? Find a mirror and see that the problem is you. 

Rant over.

Despite me being too full to try the amazing looking food, the comments from friends were more than positive. It was happy hour which had drink and food specials from 10pm to close (2am - ish). Our server/bartender, Jose, was also such a personality and was absolutely a sweetheart. 

I wish this was in the NW close to me instead as it's a beautiful spot to hang out late night, and a lovely place to eat during day. It looks like a typical neighborhood lodge bar from the outside, but it totally isn't and doesn't serve plain ole' bar food.

""You have to call me that because you're a girl"". I giggle.  ""Oooh, and I want food"".

""Fine"" she continues.  ""let's go to Sparklings"".

""Oooh Sparklings"". I coo, more laughter from the guys.

""It's not that kind of place... pig"" she concludes.

Contemporary meets country sheik.  With it's strong feminine vibe, it's the perfect place for a local, ladies night out.  Guys, you'll understand the appeal.

The food leans towards sensibly portioned Cali cuisine with just right amount of bad for the health to be Vegas.  The classic bacon wrapped dates becomes a delicious bacon wrapped meatball with dates.  No longer bite size, the ground meat a little dry in texture but the combination with the tomato sauce is very good.

Continuing with starters, a warm flatbread smeared with ricotta cheese and overloaded with arugula, halved seedless grapes, and candied walnuts then drizzled with a balsamic reduction is well executed.  A salad you can hold with the right contrast of sweetness to tangy cheese, crunch to tender, bitter greens.  The other standout is the crispy gnocchi served in a pea pure, creamed pesto with bits of Italian sausage and crushed candied walnuts.  Again, it strikes a great textural balance.  The brown butter sage gnocchi is also worthy.  The fries miss the mark.  The Truffle Parm taste of synthetic truffle oil, the Portobello fries, soggy, and the zucchini sticks overly crisp on the outside, overcooked and wet on the inside.

Small list of mains including a loco moco with demi instead of brown gravy (win!)  Tried all, no real standout, no real complaints.

Good, off Strip service.  Very fair prices.

The last few times we've come,  there is a tall Asian manager that we hadn't seen before.   Since we've started seeing him, the bar staff seem to be absolutely miserable and always fighting about stuff. They're also obviously annoyed at the kitchen who keep screwing up customer orders which get delivered by food runners to tables as soon as they're ready.... Even if a table orders 2 large dishes to eat as mains.   

Last 2 times we came,  one of us was done our meal before the second one was even delivered.   Nobody noticed, nobody made sure that the person waiting at least had a drink,  and the food was nowhere as good as it used to be.   

We won't be returning.

Great chandelier in the center and cool velvet seating.  The service was slow. Seemed to be one waiter handling  the whole restaurant the entire time we were there.  We ordered rib kabobs and the Irish nachos as an appetizer. The nachos left much to be desired but the kabobs  were delicious. It took awhile  to get our appetizers out but the main dishes came out in good timing afterwards.  Our table ordered tempura shrimp and mushroom pasta, steak Diane and the chicken pasta with creamy bacon sauce.  The pasta  was cooked beautifully, you can tell it was freshly made as it was thick and dense.  The sauce was flavorful  and the veggies fresh.  The steak medallions  were tender and the sauce was very flavorful.   After dinner, my wife visited the ladies room and she said the bathrooms were filthy.

5220217,2018-04-27,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"I need to share my unfortunate experience at Sparklings so everyone is aware.
I visited Sparklings for the first time on 4/26/18. I sat at the bar and ordered wine and a few vegetarian appetizers, one of which was spinach and cheese ravioli (I am a vegetarian). When the food was brought out, it all looked good and I was excited to try it. I had a bite of the ravioli and immediately thought that something was wrong and indeed it was. They had brought shrimp ravioli to a vegetarian! So this was my very 1st time ever having shrimp. Not only was I furious about the kitchen mistake, but I also got an allergic reaction a few minutes after that bite! There was no managers at the restaurant. However, the bartender was very attentive and sincerely concerned which I appreciated. He took care of the check. I left, bought some benadryl from the nearby store and called it a night. Luckily for the restaurant, the allergic reaction was not bad, otherwise I would have taken legal actions. I will never go back!

+some constructive criticism... the place looks very nice but the bathrooms are disgusting! The food and wine selection is good but the wine list doesn't have info about the region and year of the wines (which is essential for a wine list). And again, train the kitchen staff to take food orders and dietary restrictions seriously.",ROZDVNgmy2ZV6csI0RT-Og,3,0,1,P-em3T0Clk2WRIDAfHLLPQ

The Cosmopolitan-esque chandelier in the main dining room gives The Sparklings a feminine feel. This is the ideal place to host any girlie event--like a bridal shower. They placed our party of 12 in a private room towards the back. 

Our server was very hospitable and engaging, but some of his antics need to be toned down a few notches. He recommended the club sandwich, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the shepherds pie. I ordered the shepherds pie and it did not disappoint.

5291362,2017-11-21,1,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"A somewhat strange, but overall intriguing restaurant.

Environment: Personally, I find the environment and ambience of this restaurant particularly strange. The exterior is fashioned to look somewhat like a lodge, while the interior could not be any more different. The floorplan is very open, with some strange booth areas in the back as well as a somewhat separate bar/lounge area. However, the whole interior seems to be modeled to look kind of like a big living room or lobby, with the tables placed in the center of the open area. Overall, while the interior decorating does seem a little strange it is oddly inviting, and offers ample place for larger groups to have room without bothering smaller parties.

Food: The food style is American fusion with some European and Asian influences. Their menu is surprisingly extensive, and I was pleasantly surprised when I went in for brunch and we were also allowed to order from the regular and dinner menus. From the brunch menu, the short rib hash was delicious, despite the hollandaise which I typically do not like, but with this dish it fit perfectly. Additionally, we tried the tuna tartare which was very fresh and came mixed with cubes of mango which was very refreshing, baby octopus (which was one of my favorites), as well as the Brussel sprouts. Additionally, the bottomless mimosas are a great deal, as they leave the pitcher with you so that you are never waiting for a refill, and the champagne to OJ ratio is very generous, so you do not feel like you are simply drinking juice.

Service: Being a smaller restaurant, they seemed somewhat understaffed, however despite how busy they were I felt like our server was really trying her best and was very accommodating, being sure to refill our mimosa pitcher, waters, and repeatedly checking in to make sure we had everything that we needed.",5fxjUT0sLg9ueMAYtn2PZw,4,1,5,Uy12my4yvolvaljBEadLKw
5294406,2018-03-25,0,sOYsxYYFl03PhHmz_rBDZQ,"Just searched brunch in spring valley and this place popped up. From the reviews it seemed pretty awesome.

Walked in but no one was at the host counter.  Waited a long while, and finally a waiter came over and sat us. No big, wasn't very busy but there was a really large party. We sat and got drinks and ordered pretty quickly from there. Then, the wait. I believe we waited around 30-40 minutes for the food to come. They did apologize for the wait and said the kitchen was behind due to the large group, which I get. But that was also like 30 minutes into waiting for the food to come. About 10-15 minutes later, our food arrived. I ordered chicken fried steak from the brunch menu, and my partner ordered a shrimp poor boy sandwich and a side of corn bread.

The chicken fried steak had burnt edges on one side, the other side was fine. It was pretty tough itself. The biscuits underneath it were pretty hockey pucks - seriously hard to cut through with the butter knife provided.  Super chewy too. Flavor was fine though. Then the gravy....it was alright, nothing special, not super creamy either for country gravy. It also had that look of having been sitting out a while too, the gravy had settled and had that plastic sheen dried on top of it.  Whole thing was barely still warm. Definitely a kitchen timing issue after having to get out the meals for the giant group. The shrimp poor boy was alright, nothing special but not bad either. The highlight of the meal was the cornbread actually. It was good, even without butter (it doesn't come with any, so ask I guess if you like to put some on your bread). Really disappointed with the food. =\

All in all, it's a pretty restaurant that's decorated nicely and the waiter was fine, but the wait and cold/burnt food with the rubber biscuit puck was just....not very good. =\ Menu really sounds great too, I would have liked to try some other things, but I probably wouldn't go back.",TrIBHqM3NMFWYpxNyqVUVw,2,0,2,X4N-nB-BCMiBuiNyr9pvbA

I was definitely under-dressed but I was too hungry to care. We sat at the bar while waiting on our other friend.

We got a booth. The seats were big, nice and comfy. The table has a marble top. The chandelier was so pretty and I love how they have flowers spell out ""The Sparklings"" in front. 

We shared a bunch of appetizers and a bottle of sparkling wine. Our bartender/server with wild hair seemed abrasive at first but he loosened up quick when my friend called him out and gave him a hard time the whole night. It was pretty hilarious.

Truffle Parmesan Fries:
Comes with ketchup and lemon garlic sauce. The lemon garlic sauce tasted like it had dill in it. The fries were crisp and were a cross between skinny fries and steak fries in terms of thickness and texture. 
 
Bacon and Dates Wrapped Meatball:
I like bacon-wrapped dates. I like good meatballs. But together smothered in marinara, it was a bit strange. I wish the bacon was a bit more crisp. 3/5

Tuna Tartare:
Fresh tuna with avocado and mango cubes.  It comes with crostini. This was alright. 3.5/5

Gorgonzola Flatbread with Honey:
Just like what the name implies - nothing complicated. It's simple yet tasty. Who doesn't like cheese and honey? 3/5

Grapes, Arugula and Ricotta Flatbread:
With candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. This was good. Sweetness and juiciness from the grapes, peppery arugula, mild taste of ricotta and crunch from the walnuts. 4/5

Roasted Beet and Apple Salad:
With arugula, candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. I don't like beets but this was pretty amazing. It looked pretty and the textures were wonderful. Soft beets, crisp apples and walnuts. 4/5

Crispy Gnocchi:
Gnocchi in pesto with Italian sausage, peas and candied walnuts. I love pesto and the sauce was spot on. The gnocchi was not as crispy as I expected. 4/5

Grilled Octopus:
Baby octopus marinated in soy sauce. It has a nice char to it. A different server put our plate of octopus on our table and said ""here's your octopuses"" which started a short-lived debate. He told us ""octopi is actually wrong...I looked it up"". Well, octopuses and octopi are both correct, actually      /endtangent. 4.5/5

I am always excited when a place in my neighborhood opens. Call me old fashioned, but I've always wanted to be a cozy person that lived in a cozy neighborhood -- and for some reason cozy to me means being a regular at a handful of places that I take visiting friends to and in turn they envy me living in all my glorious coziness.

Ah, I digress.... The Sparklings took FOREVER to open but it was definitely worth the wait --- and NOT what I expected. The interior and ambiance are unmatched. It is not the type of place you'd expect to share a parking lot with Cheeburger Cheeburger. Think cufflinks and caviar...okay maybe that's a stretch but when you walk through the doors, you can't help but be impressed with the decor and detailed interior. Marble top bars, faux leather bar chairs, dim lighting...and the touch of elegance from floor to ceiling.

With that said, it's not the place you'd expect to see 'Shrimp Po Boy' or 'Club Sandwich on the menu....and that's what makes it good.....good different. The prices, menu selection, and ambiance make this a twist that works for me. It could be a formal dinner date on a Wednesday or a casual Friday happy hour.

On my first visit we ordered portobello fries, zucchini sticks, langosta bruschetta, and the bacon & date wrapped meatballs. The bruschetta was delicious and the portobello fries were my least favorite. The meatballs were my husbands favorite... i only had one small bite of it (he didn't SHARE!!) and it was very good. The zucchini sticks were good too but nothing compared to the uniquely flavored creamy bruschetta.

For our entree I had the shrimp po boy.... it came in a triangular shaped loaf filled to the brim with tempura fried shrimp, tangy spread and slaw. It was a great blend of flavors and well executed. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak and he could not stop raving about it. 

When the bill came we felt like we had a steal of a deal. The service was on point. The food presentation was just as elegant as the location and it didn't break the bank. I know the restaurant is in it's honeymoon period but I hope it keeps up the good work.

The owners of Soyo and Oyshi have outdid themselves. The Sparklings is a great new addition to the southwest area. I'm actually having a fancy dinner with friends tonight and you'll never guess where we're going ---this cozy little place in my neighborhood.

p.s. 2nd time side note- my husband and I ordered the chicken parm and the spaghetti with mushroom & bacon cream sauce... not our favorites. Looks like the sandwiches and appetizers are the way to go---at least for now. :)",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,8,3,4,p_W7y3nyLZBMW47LdikNHQ

Upon entering, you realize that some thought went into the elegant decor.  As you are seated, you begin to wonder if you are an extra on the Great Gatsby set.  

As soon as we are seated at our plush, private table in the bar area, the bartender immediately informs us that it is happy hour.  This means beer and wine are 30% off, including bottles.  Seriously, it's Saturday?  We were not expecting happy hour, but total bonus!  We proceed to order many of their delicious appetizers and a couple of bottles of wine for the group.  Some of our favorite apps include the bacon date meatball, crab spinach dip, and the octopus (different from the calamari).

Service was amazing, every employee that we interacted with was fast, friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable

This last time I came is what drove me to disappointment. It never seems busy in there yet service is a bit slow -- although I don't like to dwell on the quickness of the service cus that can't always be helped. But if there are only three parties at the restaurant, you'd think the staff would be checking the food rather just standing at the front lollygagging or looking unhappy to be there.

I ordered the langosta bruschetta which was okay. I liked the cream cheese aioli and lobster mix and the bruschetta was crispy. But I don't think I'd order it again. 

My mother ordered the clam chowder because that's the main reason we came, she was craving it. It tasted very plain. By the looks of the restaurant (and price of the clam chowder) you'd think it'd be a little more hearty and flavorful. It wasn't. 

The thing that set me off was my truffle parmesan fries. I looked at the menu at least three times to make sure that ""weird dollop of garlic"" was supposed to be in the description. It wasn't. I wanted truffle parmesan fries, not soggy garlic fries. I could barely taste the truffle with all the garlic overpowering it. Maybe if the fries were actually crispy, it might have been decent, but it was way too soggy. Because I paid $6 for it, I tried to finish it but I could barely do it with the strong garlic flavor. I was so disappointed. 

Aside from the food, the decor and the restaurant itself is very pretty. But I don't think I'll be coming back on my own will.",7mjpX2eYbcCt1pcNnN3Hrw,6,0,2,4DGM5zxwMSZAUI4x6EtYrg

I would say this place would be semi casual so it wasn't extremely fancy but it had a little elegance to it. They have a bar inside the place so while we waited for the whole party to come, I went to the bar and tried their blueberry mojito. It was so good and on top of that, the bartender was so sweet! It wasn't too strong and he crushed real blueberries in the drink. 

Now onto the main course, I ordered the Steak Diane which came with slices of steak, mashed potatoes, and veggies. I also ordered a side of fries because I had a feeling I wouldn't be full so I wanted a filler just for in case. For the cons, I would have to say that the slices of steak were quite small and thin so I expected it to be a little thicker at least. It only came with 4 thin slices. The fries were also not warm when they came out as if they were sitting in the back for a while and of course I would like my food to be hot when it's served. I also asked for ranch for my fries and I just want to say that their ranch did not taste like ranch at all. It tasted extremely watered down. 

For dessert I ordered their creme brûlée and that was okay too. It had more of a really strong egg taste rather than a vanilla taste in my opinion. Overall this place was just okay but our waitress was so nice, She was very patient with our party of 10.

-

I'm giving this place 3 stars for mediocre food, but great service!

I ordered the Rib-Eye steak with zucchini sticks and calamari as appetizers, all of which I can only describe as nothing more than average. While the did cut like butter, the seasoning on it was rather bland. The zucchini sticks were one of the better things I tried as the servings sizes were big, but I do feel like they overcooked the food. One of my main problems with both the zucchini sticks and calamari was that it seemed to be smothered in oil. I can just taste it in my mouth, and halfway through the calamari, I had to stop feeling as I started to feel a gag reflex coming from within me. So yeah, that's the food. 

However, I do have to admit that the ambience is great! Old school, Italian-themed with great music. I almost want to give 4 stars for them having my favorite song on their playlist (Unsteady - XAmbassadors)! The place is very spacious and roomy, and definitely does not seem like your average barstaurant.

One thing I did appreciate though was that our waiter managed to pick up on the fact that it was my birthday today. He gave us a free scoop of ice cream on the house with the words ""Happy Birthday"" in pretty calligraphy. It makes up for the fact that we got our water 10 minutes late.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,5,6,3,x3cTBLrZqA_53WWuSffFow

We were under the impression that Samantha was assisting her.  She was very nice, but seemed somewhat inexperienced to serve a table of 6.

We asked several times for our sever and Samantha said she was helping her.  Then after Samantha finally took our order, it was obvious that Susan had ditched us without a word.  I have been a server in many restaurants and I can't imagine treating my customers (especially, potentially tipping customers) in such a manner.  

Andy, I read your responses to our party's concerns and you come off as rather defensive instead of sincerely sorry. You shouldn't tell your customers that they have no idea how to run a restaurant.  Not only is it condescending, but you also have NO idea if your assumption is true.  Two people in our party have owned and run restaurants.  I appreciate that you comp'd the scallops, and gave happy hour prices for the drinks, however that doesn't erase the experience and ""make us happy"" as you say it should.

same owner as oyshi and soyo (another neighborhood fav), but you wouldn't know it because there's really nothing korean about sparkling other than some of the staff. i'll be honest and say that this review is mainly just on them as a bar, since i've so far only gone for after dinner drinks.  

the menu is a little scattered - pasta, bacon/date meatballs, shrimp po boy? i've only tried the crispy gnocchi so far - an appetizer portion was only $7.50, but enough for me as an entree (with a cocktail). the gnocchi itself wasn't that great, but it was a decent dish overall with the peas, sauce and everything else. 

i love love the bartenders here, and would come back even without their awesome daily happy hour till 10pm (30% off all drinks). i like fluffy drinks, and sparklings has a full bar including lots of flavored alcohols to experiment with.

there are no food specials for HH, but their pricing is reasonable anyway. i'm honestly not sure why we haven't tried sparklings for dinner yet. probably because i've been on a huge asian kick lately, so if they could make some korean dishes here, i'd be in heaven...  

the only negative is that i HATE the music they play. it kind of varies between different kinds of easy listening. michael buble is fine, but they also play a lot of instrumental kenny g type stuff. i get that they're going for upscale and classy, but please play somethng else - i can't stand the music. 

i guess they only opened about a month ago, so it's been pretty empty every time i've been here. the place will probably become packed as more people learn it exists - it's perfect for a neighborhood date night. they have a decent sized private dining room, and even have great indoor and outdoor patio seating - can't wait to try it out in the spring!",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,7,6,5,haK5-p0uEHVHR-uB_X77dQ

My son and I decided to have dinner here last week and were beyond disappointed, not just with the food but with the service as well. We weren't treated very nicely, an afterthought really. Felt it was because we were dressed down a bit and weren't ordering the pricier meals. We both decided on pasta dishes that turned out to be very poorly done. No one ever came back to refill our water and the check was dropped off tableside without asking if we wanted dessert (it was a special occasion, we were up for it, but it wasn't offered). Very cold service, even paying the check. We left feeling mistreated and won't forget this experience. 

Decided that we won't be back and will share our experience here, as well as with friends & family so they can avoid being treated this way as well. Sad.

Have you ever been someplace you enjoy but yet you really don't?
Does that make sense??

First of all I had seen some yelp reviews and bookmarked this place. While on Rainbow decided this was one of those places I wanted to see what it was all about.

When seated it is almost like your in a Internet Cafe, everyone was on their lap tops and phones! Well they have free WiFi so why not?

Anyway, we decided to get a appetizer.  The crab and spinach dip which was $8. Sounded so good!
When it came out the waiter made sure to say if we did not have enough pita bread we could order more. Of course for a fee ~ Pita Bread (3pcs) $1 (6pcs) $2. And of course there was not enough so we had to order more. It was very good! Hot and a great taste. There was 2 different ways they serve the pita fried and grilled. Both were good but the fried was really addicting with the dip! Just small triangle pieces not like a plate full, There  was plenty of the dip and worth trying.

Then we ordered the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce which was $11. This came out in a pretty good size bowl and the waiter added some fresh grated cheese if you want. This was also good. Came ala carte . You get nothing else with it. No bread, no salad, nothing. If you request bread you will be charged.

So why 3 stars? Because I do not like places that nickle and dime you for everything. If you want to be a fine dining restaurant then charge a bit more but give people a reason to want to come back! Bread with pasta is a common thing, almost everyplace that serves pasta always serves bread and it is usually always unlimited.

Then with the appetizer ~ why not charge $10 and include enough pita so you don't have to pay more because you did not get enough.

Great atmosphere, nice chandelier hanging but that won't bring us back. The food was good and service was good, hopefully they will make some changes to their menu.

Would we go back? Maybe sometime. Not anytime too soon.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,18,16,3,OHbhGUrj0ZZ6-v03G13CyA

Such an extensive menu at that too, from the specials like rainbow trout served as a light portion to the steak entree and everywhere in between, the menu is nicely priced and high quality. This ""barstaurant"" is open until the wee hours of the morning and serves familiar fine dining food at comfort food prices.

The atmosphere is old-school, country-club, Rat Pack ( Frank Sinatra Sr., Sammy Davis Jr. and friends ) meets the movie ""Cocktail' ( with a young Tom Cruise, Elizabeth Shue, and Bryan Brown ) meets the television serial comedy ""Cheers"". The bar area is integral to the experience but subtly segregated from the dining room providing a different environment from the dining room. If you and your crew need an intimate setting to unwind, the bar is the place. If you are a couple on a date ( with or without toddlers in tow ) the dining room might be more to your liking. This is a discrete environment where the jet-set aren't bothered by paparazzi and the young neighborhood folks acknowledge each other politely.

Obviously a neighborhood, locals kind of place where ""everybody knows your name"", the employees working in this beautiful example of New Vegas culture demonstrate the pronounced culture of treating every guest like the Brown Derby and everybody is a movie star! 

I recommend the cheese platter, aforementioned Rainbow Trout (if available, Pan-Seared Salmon if not), Ribeye, Spaghetti with Meat Sauce, French Onion soup, Lobster Bisque, Caesar Salad, and many more Food Network worthy New American cuisine treats.

I had the Jambalaya and for my regular readers you know how much I love properly cooked Cajun food. That being said when I tell you this was the 2nd best Jambalaya I've had since moving to Vegas you know its damn good.

The Fiancé had the clam linguine and wasn't impressed. The pasta was cooked perfectly but the sauce itself was bland and the Clams were little itty bitty shriveled up Clams that if served to a customer should have been pulled out of the medium sized shells just to prevent the extra work to remove them or cause you to question why the clam meat had shrunk to that size?

She sent the dish back and refused all the requests to remake the dish or refund the cost of the meal. We didn't say no to the cheese cake they brought over though. It was delicious.

Food - Amazing!
   Sweet potatoes fries - cooked just right
   Bacon wrapped meatballs - delicious
   Sliders - no complaints
   Cheese plate - the cheeses were good, but the cranberry and the fried pita were absolutely amazing. The fried pita tasted like fried dough to me! It was delicious with the cranberry and cheese.

Service - Great. Our bartender was friendly and attentive. When I asked if they had blue cheese olives, he said no but he would make some for me since they were not that busy. He also gave us all of our drinks at happy hour pricing even though we arrived there around 4pm.

Atmosphere - Somewhat fancy. Not my style but I wasn't bothered by it at all.

Drinks- Diluted. They use this weird crushed ice at the bar- don't be fooled by it's cool look... it waters down your drink! My martini would have been great, except it tasted watery. (I am picky when it comes to dirty martinis) My husband had some fruity drink and it seemed like he was drinking from a cup full of ice.

Happy Hour - From 5pm to 10pm daily, 30% off all alcoholic beverages. Despite this discount, my martinis were still $10 each, which I felt was high for how diluted down they were. There are no happy hour specials for food, though the food is very reasonably priced and definitely worth the money.",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,3,1,4,oubt0DOsWu911T5QBCTtBg

Walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant interior. It's very spacious and super cute. The perfect place for a date night or girls night out. We walked past the dining area and settled in at  the bar. Seats are comfortable and bartenders were friendly and very attentive. They have just about every bottle you can imagine, so you can request just anything your heart desires. I went with The Chandelier, from the cocktail menu, but my friend wanted and White Gummy Bear and the bartender was happy to oblige. 

The drinks were tasty and pretty reasonably priced. I debated ordering an appetizer while I was there, but decided to try to be good since we had just eaten dinner elsewhere. The food menu is extensive and everything seemed reasonably priced, so I look forward to coming back soon and trying some appetizers as well as entrees.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,6,4,nfxEjjymLXct3_UaXdfdxw

The service was really great and I'm so happy that they were very attentive. 

The food was great and loved the overall experience here.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,0,5,XMZEYXQHTJUHqy-VwJ5BwQ
