I was expecting the shrimp to be over-cooked, but they came out hot and tender. The chicken pieces were smaller than their picture board, but we're also mostly tender.  

They cook to order, but have pretty quick turn around times. Only thing I didn't like was they had mushrooms in the stir fried veggies.  Would order without them.",F_-1IBg81xMObSNhglSyGQ,0,0,5,KViK6jfDk3qMrgTIbjbZ-A
