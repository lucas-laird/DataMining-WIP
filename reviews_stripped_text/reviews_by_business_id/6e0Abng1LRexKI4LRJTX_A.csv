The bean and cheese burrito used to be 2.50$ and would buy it every day . Now the bean and cheese is almost fucking 4$ . A can of beans cost at the highest 1$ and the amount of cheese in the burrito .50$ . But fuck me right they need a profit margin of fucking 3$ ... naw I'm good and everything else is up.

If I'm paying 8$ dollars for a fucking breakfast burrito I better be getting chef ramsy cooking my food back there or a handjob from one of the employees male/female !

The menu is very similar to another establishment that ends with...""tos.""  

The food is a solid A-OK.  This is based on a mean average of earlier orders (carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream and guac plus a quesadilla) dating back to the 80's. When I saw my brother on the first bite, spit out a chunk of gristle on the most recent visit, I braced myself for a similar experience.

I'm taking off one star for the rude service I got the last time I went in, about a week ago. I wanted to know the price of nachos without meat and the rude girl at the register gave me the price, which was higher than the menu price for nachos with meat. I asked about this and she insisted that it wasn't. It turns out they're the same price, which is okay, I guess, but there's no need to be rude.",msxc1VlPTD6E-0Kns7bIFw,1,0,2,RZ3Xjs0CN4L5-ldAwWhrqA
3564966,2013-10-04,0,6e0Abng1LRexKI4LRJTX_A,This place is great for that late night munchie. My wife and I ate here on a Monday night and we thought it was going to be like Robertos. The menu is identical but the quality is above and beyond Robertos. We ordered Chicken Tacos and a Cane Asada Burrito. The Chicken Tacos were stuffed to perfection. There was an even blend of cheese and lettuce. Not to forget the chicken was seasoned great. The Cane asada Burrito was stuffed with all the goodies and they didnt even charge me for all the extras. The price was exceptional. We spent $8.00 and got (1) Carne Asada Burrito with extras (4) Chicken Tacos and (1) Large Fountain Coke. So I have to say $8.00 well spent!!!,lsl_Le9iVqmt17IcRPEzGA,1,1,4,2XEi4tIfp6WhcfRbw4wurw

First of all, this little taco shop is a bit hard to find, but thanks to Google Maps, I have found this little gem in North Las Vegas ( in the Centennial Hills area). This little strip mall does not have too many shops open, and the parking is very small, and limited. If you pass the 7-eleven, you have gone too far.

Don't be fooled by the Interior, because the setup does look like most Roberto's taco shops. But, I think the owners of Algoberto's took over the eatery, and left the interior as it is. 

The Menu is Very Similar to Roberto's, but the Quality of the food is much better. The eatery itself is kept clean, they do clean the floors, and tables throughout the day. And the Condiments are kept cool, and stocked up as well.

5517529,2016-02-19,0,6e0Abng1LRexKI4LRJTX_A,"4 stars for my Carne asada taco salad. 

I let the husband go in to take my order because I wanted to see if I'd enjoy my food blindly. You know, food taste better when service is great or food tastes like poo because of poor service. My thought process was...it is windy and I'm hungry. I'd like to enjoy this taco salad without anyone ruining my vibe.

It's a shop located amongst a strip of businesses. You could easily miss it because it isn't quite street view. So when you see 7-11 at the corner--that's your cue to turn in. Lots of parking because it's one of those strips within a neighborhood. It took us all but 2 mins to get here since the husband works around the corner.

It took about 15 minutes and a little longer until my husband comes walking out with two bags of each of our taco salad. They place it onto their Styrofoam plates which obviously can't be closed. 

We ate those suckers in the parking lot because I couldn't risk our food to get the sweating. It felt a little longer than necessary considering it was ""just"" a taco salad.

Opting for the Carne asada and omitting the beans and rice. What....don't judge. I can handle only so much moosh. Anyway, upon opening I quickly discovered why our food took a little longer for jusssst a taco salad.

I completely appreciate a fresh taco shell. Nothing like waiting long for a stale one. But not todaaay-ay. It was salad delight. All the fixings inside is typical of a taco salad, however, everything in it seemed soooo fresh!!! The lettuce, pico, guac, etc...fresh. furrrr-resh. Lettuce was nice and crispy, meat wasn't salty nor chewy, pico didn't look like twas sitting in a container overnight. I will add that the meat seemed kind of skim. They put their meat at the way bottom of the salad. 

Honestly, though...being skim on the meat in a taco salad is alright with me. The meat wasn't even a feature of the taco. 

The Carne asada taco salad is 6.95. We also ordered a horchata. What else would you wash all that down with during a midday fiesta. That large cup came.out to 2 dollar something.

The husband said the horchata were pre-poured into the cups which bare the Pepsi logo, that sits in a fridge waiting for someone to take them home. Their horchata wasn't overly sweet, and wasn't anything special to add. Just your typical horchata.

Blind test worked. I enjoyed my food without any biasness. Not that I'm biased. I woud love to return to try out their tacos or something of interest, and get the full-service myself. I'll update. 

So 4 stars STRICTLY over the taco salad.",MC0aQHT7mQ1WJknOD6u8pg,1,1,4,bps5Q66VckHD99sf3Q5WHA

I go here not expecting culinary greatness - more for a quick flavorful lunch.  It's cheap and they almost always have a lunch special.  The Chile Relleno burrito is my favorite.  Ask for 2 rellenos and less of the other stuff.  

Some times they have chicken tacos for .99... Bueno!

Basically - nothing fancy, but it's fast, tasty and cheap.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,2,4,7dojhevY-9uttT7ecTVFQg

It was pretty busy, with regulars that came in so I thought it would be good. I was very disappointed. 

Also their fountain drink machine was Down So we had the horchata, which didn't take authentic. 

The customer service was great (2stars) and the rice was good! 

Huge disappointment. Sorry ;(",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,0,0,2,nMKcjKFbi_vZyKRQ6nJ6sQ

The front of the restaurant smells and appears very clean and sanitary. This small shop definitely takes pride in ownership

Hospitality: 5 stars
The staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. I used their call ahead order service and was impressed with the friendliness and promptness received.  

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great for a ""quick"" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food on the go this is a good option.",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,1,0,5,joHcXN1Ek3avmyNPlG7xDw
5866551,2015-02-28,0,6e0Abng1LRexKI4LRJTX_A,Yum!  Best carne asada I have had in a long time.  The restaurant is very clean and the service was friendly.  This place has been compared to Roberto's on occasions.  However.... The menu and prices may be the same but the food his so much better.  I would drive out of my way to visit this restaurant even if there was a Roberto's closer.,3xESvNr3bkJikpjLRqcBcA,0,0,5,MbPUGcN-hRjeQ2f3VSAbvg
