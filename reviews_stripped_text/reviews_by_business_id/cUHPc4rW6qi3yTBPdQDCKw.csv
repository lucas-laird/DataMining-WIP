The service is average and the servers don't seem to speak much English or maybe they are just very quiet. We ordered the seafood chao mian and the general's chicken.

We ordered the beef sesame rolls. Wow, did not expect it to be that spicy! But it was pretty good. The chili oil soaks into the roll and it kind of tastes like a Dorito after awhile. Still good though.

I'd come here again if I'm in town and craving some light Shanghai food, for sure. Also, if you write a review they give you 10% off!! :)",rJzB6GzdqSl20CZFtd-o0A,0,0,3,YbOAdr5w7tu40rwk9jM9JA

298167,2008-01-10,0,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw,"We went for dinner the first night of CES (probably one of the biggest shows in Vegas).  Every restaurant in the area was packed, including Emperor's Garden.  We had to wait about 15min for our table.  When we got our menu, we were surprised by the care the owner took to explain the background of the cuisine as well as origins of well-known dishes.

We were intrigued by the story of the Husband and Wife Beef Lung Slices (lung has been replaced by shank and tendon in modern times) so ordered that.  It came in a deceivingly spicy red chili oil, which was just mildly hot and had a complex fermented flavor which we really liked.  There was great contrast in texture between the tender shank and crunchy tendon.

I've been on a hunt for authentic Dan Dan noodles, which I was excited to find here.  This one was perfectly spiced with lots of ground Sichuan red peppercorns that linger on your tongue making it salivate.  This stuff is addictive if you like the sensation - I do.

The mini pork dumplings had silky smooth delicate skins which helped take away the spice of the other dishes.

The fish filets in Hunan sauce were super tasty with just the right amount of spiciness - enough to not overwhelm the other flavors.  

The string beans were fried perfectly without any hint of greasiness and well seasoned, reminding me of good french fries.

A native Sichuan customer we met gave it a 7 out of 10, which is pretty good for this side of the Pacific.  I've got to make a trip to Chengdu to find the 10/10 restaurant he's talking about.",xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ,0,0,4,1LOvFuV17ITfkSbaSFX9kg

362215,2011-12-29,0,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw,"Oh no, no-no-no-no.  How could so many things go wrong?

While I wore my ""asian-service-glasses"" to this restaurant (please see explanation in my Boiling Point review), this was just a terrible, terrible experience.  The owner of the restaurant was clearly overwhelmed and she could not muster up any sort of decent service.  I've seen much busier restaurants so I actually questioned her competence plus that of her waiting staff.  Here a few things that happened:

-we were told to go sit down at our table...while the previous occupants were still there
-no waiter came for a long time after being seated
-there was a good 20 minute gap in between courses...
-...until we realized that had forgotten multiple orders of our meal (I'm not talkin' about (1) order, more like 6 orders of dumplings, 4 orders of something else, another order of noodles...it was pretty bad
-their explanation to their forgetfulness? Sorry we were so busy. Yikes! 

I've been known to be swayed by food even when there is terrible service, but not this time. The food was bland, sub-par and not even worth good service.  Dishes were extremely oily and the silverware was dirty.  The bathroom had a wastebasket that was overflowing and clearly being ignored.

The only good thing was we had a great busboy who was attentive when we needed waters/napkins/etc.  Not a very good silver lining I'm afraid...

389998,2014-06-30,0,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw,"Brought my book club here for an evening of discussion and great Chinese food. In addition, the website boasted 1.99 glasses of house wine. We checked with server and asked about the wine specials and were advised, no, they were 2.99. Still a great deal, wine for all!

The place was packed, the 6 of us ordered our entrees and were told it would be awhile as they are busy. Within 5 mins, one meal came out, 5 mins later, the next and so it went for 5 entrees.

One of our group ordered combo fried rice, which finally came out 15 mins or so after our last served entr√©e. They should call this ""fried rice"" white rice with peas. Looked awful, boring and bland. The taster confirmed this was the case. As was the case with the tofu meal ordered by someone else.

Garlic eggplant was good, lo mein was good also.

The kicker came with the bill, three glasses of wine $14.98. Also on the bill, 3 side orders of rice, which were not ordered or received.
I call the owner over and advise we were not charged correctly as the wine should be 1.99 according to webpage or even 2.99 as confirmed by the waiter. Well, this woman just screamed, ""website old, not good prices, new owner, no you pay this price!!"" on and on. When we advised the waiter stated 2.99, she then yelled at him, handed me back the bill and said ""no, pay this thank you"".

Really?? 

Then, as we were leaving after paying the bill , she comes and says ""give us another chance, we will give you free dessert next time and we will change the website"". I think not madam.

There are plenty of good places to eat in Chinatown, this place is not one of them.

From their website: Apparently, you pay what they say, regardless of what is advertised.

Located on the second floor of ""Chinatown Plaza"", this is one of the very few non-Cantonese style places I've found in LV.

The meat was so dry, and the skin fatty and limp), Scallop in Garlic Sauce (the quality of the scallops were outstanding!), Crab in Ginger & Scallion (they didn't even crack the crab before sauteing, so no flavor went in the crab), Steamed Whole Bass (very overcooked), Baby Bok Choy and Mushroom (can't really mess this one up), Special Szechuan Fried Rice (can't really mess this one up), Ba Bao Fan (didn't all all resemble ba bao fan.  They just mixed all the ingredients and steamed it in a cylinder shape), Plate of sliced oranges and grapes (can't really mess this one up), Honey Walnut Shrimp (tastes like something Panda Express would make), Sichuan Spicy Beef (NASTY concoction of flavorless sliced beef that has been slightly deep-fried, then drowned in chili oil), Tofu and Spinach Soup (They substituted spinach for bok choy), and Sichuan Cold Noodles (can't really mess this one up).

(@#$@#!$ so mad that i even made an acc just to leave this reply)

This restaurant does not even deserve 1 star!!!

I went there with my family/friends about 2 weeks ago for lunch and decided to go in after looking at the menu posted on the outside. 
However, when we sat down and looked at the menu on the table, it was a completely different menu. Not only were there less choices but the prices were also ridiculously high (close to doubled the price) compare to the menus posted. 

After discussing with my family/friends we decided to stay. We thought maybe the price is higher because it is a bigger portion. 

So we ordered around 4-5 dishes.  
When the dishes arrived, i was EXTREMELY shocked to see the small portions on the table. 

the service was HORRIBLE. it seems like the waitresses/waiters purposely try to avoid direct eye contact with the customers so they dont have to do anything. whenever we raise our hand they look down (right away)

After eating the mediocre dishes we got the check which came down to $95. (EXTREMELY overpriced & TOTALLY NOT worth it)

After we paid, i went outside to double check the menu and looked for the ones we had ordered to match the prices. 
I saw that the prices posted on the outside was almost 1/2 the price in the menu we were handed. 

So i went in and asked one of the waitress why we were not given the menu on the outside and she said, ""that menu is for white people for people who know english and have different taste""
Her reply just made me so angry. Basically they mean that just because we are asians we have to pay double the price? and its not like we dont know english. and who is she to judge what i like to eat? 

Overall, i would NEVER go back again. and if anyone still wants to go please ask for the ""white people menu"" because it is a lot cheaper and surprisingly the same portion with more choices to pick from.",o3BatH7FltHhL62iOVoBgA,3,0,1,bCrAd2OyPJk0l84zrqQKlg

As mentioned in my previous review, this place used to be SWAMPED. When I finally returned, it was virtually empty. Unable to resist sampling their changes, I proudly present my updated 1-star review.

I ordered what they used to be famous for: xiao long bao. It came out lukewarm as though it was microwaved. There was no soup in the dumpling, and the meat was very tough. One of the worst xiao long bao's I've ever had, to be quite frank.

Next on my list was the salty rice roll. This was excellent, and I give them full marks for this. However, it's such a banal dish that it's really child's play.

Finally I had the spicy chilled cucumbers. This was absolutely awful. When prepared properly, the spicy sauce is hot and addicting and delicious. When made incorrectly, however, it's just like mixing a cold vegetable with tons of hot sauce. It won't taste good.

So I came here over the weekend looking for some Taiwanese breakfast and figured Chinatown must have it.  Got to Chinatown, saw ""YongHe"" outside which means Taiwanese breakfast so I was pretty excited when I went in.  

I'm grateful that they are attempting Taiwanese style breakfast but I feel bad for the people that actually think this is good.  Being a Szechuan restaurant, naturally they would have a lot of spicy food.  I ordered a beef wrap/roll and some Chinese donuts (youtiao).  Pretty much it was different cuts of beef marinated in chili oil that's usually served as a cold appetizer but then they stick it in the middle of a shaobing (Taiwanese-style bread). Kinda of a lazy way of doing things. I guess it is smart, using the same ingredients for 2 different dishes haha. Not really authentic. The youtiao was pretty good.  Kinda hard to mess THAT up since it is just frying dough!

Their soymilk tastes like soymilk and the fantuan (rice roll) looked ok but that's hard to mess up too.  Overall for a Taiwanese breakfast place, it's whatevvvss.

Service wasn't the greatest either.  We waited over 15 minutes to hand our order slip to the waiter and the tea took forever to arrive.  It seemed like they were understaffed but the restaurant wasn't even half full..

1627658,2009-01-03,0,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw,"I don't think some of the previous reviewers were being fair.

You ARE in an area boasting the best asian restaurants in town - and they're usually relatively cheap, or affordable at least. You had a choice, and something must've made you go here instead of somewhere else. My older brother, nephew and I decided to stop in for lunch here.

Everything on the menu sounds good, and the meny is NOT limited. The sichuan dishes ARE authentic.
They bring out hot tea (infused with jasmine, but not overpowering). I think they do this partly because you DO NOT GET REFILLS. This is a major downside. I wish we would've ordered water instead of cold tea as well. I'd hope they'd refill water...

As a previous reviewer stated, yes - their ""iced tea"" is Brisk Lemon Iced Tea in a can. Disappointing. I wanted a big, cold class of tea. Did not get that. The hot tea is standard. When you order another drink you'd better pace yourself, because all you'll have left is the hot tea, and if you're eating something that requires a cool drink - S.O.L.

Service was good when we got the food. Otherwise, there are two waitresses and they have to run to the kitchen a lot. The younger one is less attentive.

The bathroom door and kitchen doors being visible kind of bothered me, but whatever.
The entrance is nice, at least. They have fish tanks. The kids always want to sit near them.

We ordered:

- Fried wontons (8 - cream cheese/crab)
- Steamed dumplings (8 - not a big fan at authentic asian places, they were out of pan-fried).

   * For some reason, I like potstickers better. Even Ling Ling's. The steamed dumpling pouches always taste a little off to me at some restaurants. Not as much flavor.

- Combination Fried Rice (ham, shrimp, chicken - plenty of egg, just the way I like it)
- Three-Flavor noodles (they bring a plate of dry noodles and a pan with veggies, meat and sauces and put it on top. The noodles are then cooked and it's de-lish. The shrimp is cooked perfectly).
- Scallops in Garlic Sauce (OH. MY. GOD. This was THE best dish, the sauce is to DIE for).
- Sichuan Beef (not too spicy, cooked perfectly).

You also get steamed white rice. We were so full we couldn't finish. I reaaaaally wanted to order honey walnut prawns, but I was too full. That would've been the dish to make me love/dislike the place, for sure.

I cannot say enough about the Scallops in Garlic Sauce, though. It comes with some veggies thrown into the mix, but if I wasn't in a public restaurant I would've licked the plate clean!

We decided to get boxes. I had the brilliant idea to put the plain rice into two separate boxes and poor the scallop garlic sauce over the rice. YUMMY! I would go back just for the scallops and wontons, and end up trying the honey walnut prawns and probably loving that dish as well.

I wish I knew how to make that sauce. I swear...it's magical. Hahaha.",iyhqoE49PTX2VNITzpDw6w,0,0,3,GrPY7GIkbTv91zeuXquRtw

We decided not to get the vegetable dish and just finish our meal.

Second strike:  They put extra charges on our bill.  They charged us for 3 chinese donut when we only ordered one, and they kept the vegetable dish on the bill.

Third strike:  On the final check that was handed to me, the total had gratuity included.  Really?  Mandatory gratuity for a party of 2?  Whatever.  I gave them my card and when it came back to me for my signature, it said in BIG BOLD LETTERS ""PRE TIP AMOUNT"".

Sweet cold soymilk: Way too sweet. Lukewarm, not cold. And $2.85 for a glass of sweet cold soymilk? Average nowadays should be $1.50, maybe $2. 
Egg taco: Edible, but just some plain eggs around a flat pancake. Quite boring. Didn't even have green onions.
Mixed noodles (??): Where are the noodles?? Barely any noodles on the bottom of the bowl with some strings of cucumber. Not worth the $7.95 at all!
Spicy beef pancake (????). The beef was OK, but the pancake was hard and tasteless. Not at all fluffy the way it should be.

The final kicker; they add a mandatory 15% tip. WHAT?? I've only known fancy Western restaurants to do that, and even then it's only at dinner time.

Food was okay. Tasteless or at least very little sodium.  Service was okay too. They get a lot of Chinese Mainland tourists, who dont tip, so the gratuity is added onto your bill as a suggestion. Keep this in mind for the other off Strip Chinese eatablishments like Jumbo Buffet and the sort.

It's hard to compare to food in LA, San Francisco, and Jersey/NYC but is easy to see why they're still in business...  There's no good Chinese food around so you start missing the taste of well cooked food.

2442531,2014-05-22,0,cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw,"This is one of the few times where Yelp reviews have let me down... because I LOVED the food here. I came here reluctantly because of the low rating, but my Aunt really wanted to eat some Szechuan cuisine while we were in Las Vegas. But maybe my low expectations were a good thing, because I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.

Here's the breakdown!

*Food:
-Pork intestine in clay pot: SO yummy!! This was flavored with a sour and spicy sauce, it was really delicious and the intestine was cooked perfectly. It didn't taste too pungent and it had the right amount of softness. 

-Sizzling rice dish: Delicious. The sauce was sweet and savory, and I loved how it complimented the texture of the crispy rice. One of my favorites from what we ordered.

-Eggplant with garlic sauce: Cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of spice and sweetness and the eggplant was soft with a bit of crisp on the skin.

-Szechuan beef: This was okay. You get A LOT of beef, but it was just all spice and salt and lacked that extra pinch of flavor to take it to the next level.

*Service: It was a little slow because there was only one waiter for the whole restaurant. He was pretty nice and accommodating when he was serving us, but we had to flag him down sometimes. 

*Price: Pretty cheap. Around $10-12 for each dish, which is not bad for dinner.

*Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty spacious, however, some of my dishes weren't very clean prior to eating and I had to switch them out. But that's pretty typical of most Chinese restaurants, so it wasn't a big deal. 

So this is one of the few times where I'm just going to have to disagree with the majority on Yelp. The food is great here and they know how to cook most Szechuan dishes just right.

1) No water was served until after asking more than once! Anywhere I've ever gone to dine at (buffet or dinner service), water is the first thing served upon being seated. There were no pitchers of water anywhere, and in fact, one of our guests actually went to the bar to get water! When we asked for water to be served on the tables, the wait staff was not very friendly about it, and it seemed we were a bother for asking them. 

2) We chose a buffet style service, which the staff was not prepared to handle our capacity. Even after letting the staff know the approximate number of guests we were expecting (which they reassured us that it would be no problem) food ran out after the 3rd table got their servings and we had a few more tables to go... our guests waited at least 15 minutes or more before the food was replenished and the staff was nowhere to be found when they should have been monitoring the food levels. They were too busy catering to the regular diners, and it wasn't even that busy!

The female at that table was having an extrememly loud cell phone conversation that we were not interested in. We stood at the entrance for a minute. No one greeted us.  Two Asian males were just sitting at the bar chatting, not paying attention to us.  One had an apron on with the nametag ""BAI"".  The other one just read a newspaper at the bar.  So I began to walk over and get a menu from the shelf at the rear of the the two males.  

I was interested in some spicy Szechuan cuisine. The other two in my party wanted something not so spicy.  The female in our group asked if everything was spicy.  Bai finally interupted us and stated with a sarcastic glare, ""the one with the chili (icon) is hot!""

We agreed to eat here and told Bai that there were three of us dining.  Bai immediately attempted to sit us at a small table adjacent to the the loud lady on the cell phone.  I gestured to the larger table and Bai asked,"" how many?""  We said, ""Three"".  Bai gestured us away from the larger round table, towards the smaller table adjacent to the loud female on the cell phone again.  Bai stated,""you have three, three sit here!""

There were maybe 30-40 EMPTY tables in the entire restaurant and he refused to have us sit anywhere but near the loud lady.  We finally told him that we would like the larger table to make room for the many dishes we were going to try.

Bai became disgruntled and we sat at the larger table.  As we were looking at the menu items, I noticed that Bai had walked towards the bar and muttered something to his Asian friend
 reading the newspaper.  Bai then turned around and glared at us.

I finally had had it and decided that a sour attitude would probably be present during the entire meal.  I wish I had read the YELPS on this restaurant prior to considering it.

I stood up and stated to my friends that it would be of best interest if we departed now since we felt uncomfortable by the ungracious staff.

I should have also noticed that no one was breaking the door down attempting to dine in this awful place.

All three of us are Asian, so I don't think there was any unpleasantries due to race.

We ended up next door at the Capitol Seafood Restaurant where we were pleasantly greeted and respected during the entire meal.  We were even given free desserts, which no one else received that we noticed.

This is a note to remind myself not to go back to this restaurant.
Don't be tempted by the lure of Sao Bings or other Taiwanese Breakfast foods. 
The ?? you tiao inside my ? ? fan tuan was so stale or tough that it hurt my teeth. 
I asked if they would still have Sao Bings if I came back at 1:30pm, just before they end breakfast. I was assured that they would have everything available until 2pm when they stop serving breakfast. I hoped rather than believed it would be true. I went back at 1:30 to get Sao Bings for my husband. They told me that they couldn't put an egg inside. That the Sao Bings came plain. That I would need to order the ""egg taco"" and put it inside. Since my husband said a Dan Bing was ok, I ordered it.
When they brought me my wrapped up to go bag, they said that they were sorry but they were out of Sao Bings, but had put in extra you tiaos in my order. I reminded the lady that I had been in earlier, and asked if they would still have Sao Bings at 2pm. She said they can run out of things. (Duh)
The next step was my fault. I should have checked my FOOD thoroughly before paying my bill. I should have checked my BILL thoroughly before paying my bill. I did neither. I accepted the wrapped up to-go bag, paid my bill, and left. 
When I got to the car, I opened the bag and found 4 you tiaos that were so stale and hard that when I squeezed them in my hand they didn't give or break. It was like they had been microwaved 2 or 3 times and left to sit for hours in-between. I couldn't give them to my husband. I was embarrassed to admit that I had ended up paying for them even though I didn't order them at all. (I knew better from earlier) I threw them away at a gas station before I picked up my husband.
When I checked on what I thought would be a Dan Bing, I realized that ""egg taco"" was too generous of a description. It was some eggs cooked onto a tortilla. No green onions, no sit sauce, no garlic chili paste. My husband makes WAY better food than that at home!!! I ended up just throwing that away too. 

So basically, I ended up spending $15 at the restaurant that day for some sweetened rice.

Do you know what's worse than losing money in Vegas? The answer is coming here for Taiwanese style breakfast  ...

I don't even know why I came here in the first place, but our group saw the word ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" (????) and the rest is history. ""Yong He Soybean Milk"" symbolizes a famous Taiwanese breakfast restaurant and everyone nowadays just abuses the name. Breakfast is available from 8 AM to 2 PM.

There was only one server at 8 AM and he doesn't seem to speak English, but at least he speaks fluent Mandarin (errr ....... yay)! 

Soy Sauce Flavored Soybean Drink (""Salty"" Soy Milk, $3.25): ""Salty"" soy milk is one of those Taiwanese breakfast item not everyone would love. It contained vinegar, Chinese oil stick (youtiao), sesame oil, and some green onion. Emperor's Garden version of ""salty"" soy milk was a bit disappointing. (2/5)

Shrimp & Chicken Wan Ton Soup ($9.95) - Wow ... $10 wonton soup. I would THINK all food items here would be pretty cheap because we are in the middle of Chinatown. Tasted really whatever and $10 price tag didn't help. (2/5)

Chinese Style Egg Taco (Taiwanese egg pancake, $4.5): One of the most tasteless Taiwanese egg pancake I've had ever. (1/5)

We got green onion pancakes (???), potstickers (??), egg crepe (??), and a rice burrito-like thing (??). I love all of these items usually, and they're all pretty standard Chinese dishes so you'd expect most places to get them right. However, this place produced the most flavorless food I've probably ever had. Everything they served seemed to be missing salt and was covered in oil.

Maybe they avoid putting in too much salt to allow for customers to adjust according to their own tastes. However, with the food they served, no amount of soy sauce could save it because deep down, the food is flavorless.

The worst part about this place, though, was the service. When we came in, there were about 4 tables full of dirty dishes. The waiter hastily pointed to a table without silverware or plates and told us to sit. We were later given some plates and a menu and ordered. The food actually came out pretty quickly, but it was served by some guy with the worst attitude I've seen in a waiter. He dropped the food in the table (spilling a lot of the soy milk) and failed to tell us what any of the dishes were (we knew what they were, but not every customer would). I also saw the same waiter blow off a customer and tell him to ""ask someone else"" when he was asked a question.

When we finished, we were waiting for someone to bring the check, but it never came so we just went up to the cash register. Like some people have mentioned, a 15% tip was included, but definitely not deserved. Chinese brunch with my family is usually my favorite time, but they somehow managed to screw up the food and the experience.",MKTrPMPWriQuc5GkuYpFcQ,4,0,2,p83EWAFOQex-7BR1pS6_hQ

We ordered the fried dough with soy milk for dipping, the roasted peanuts and anchovies which normally goes with congee but we ate it straight as a snack, the rice ball, egg crepe and soup dumplings. The soup dumplings were average but the other items were good and satisfied my craving. 

True, their tabletop chili oil is not as hot but I've been told that's the Taiwanese style and I believe there is beauty in every hot sauce. 

The service was lacking but not horrible. They only had two servers staffed so they did what they could and at least brought the food out promptly. You don't go to Asian restaurants for their smiling service. It's efficient and to the point.",StM6CBrQLRQ2PwfQKWJTzA,0,0,4,19as9WdXlV8H9b8brO9mrg

The food are overprice comparing to other Chinese restaurants. I was wondering how can they still open with that quality of food and service. However, It was a life time experience to dine at Emperor Garden . I would recommend everyone to try the worst Chinese food in Las Vegas.",5HRRYAobrb0Frot-iz691A,0,0,1,Vd8wjZc36ugfckMHQf3dGg

We came here for the szechuan food, and for that, it simply was not spicy enough.  Likely,they altered the flavors for the western palette, which is disappointing.  We got the usual fish in chili broth.  Lots of veggies.  If you don't like oil, then this is not for you...actually, a lot of chinese foods would not be agreeable:)  Then there was the dan dan mien.  4/10...not a single note of spiciness.  Other dishes- 

fresh cucumber in chili sauce- went well with the meat dishes, but nothing special
a lamb with bell pepper dish- 8/10.  Wish I knew what it was called.
chicken with bell pepper dish- good texture for the chicken.  5/10

Service was quick.  Probably won't be coming back though, since there are other great restaurants in the area.",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,0,0,3,1QssPKFNKOlGVEniqi3aVw

Im glad I did it that way as we would have missed out on a wonderful dining experience. 

The three of us ordered appetizers and four meals and shared everything. It all tasted perfect and even a dish I know I didnt like (at other stores) turned out to be delicious here. Made me wonder if a mild narcotic had been added to it.

There was two other tables and a party in the banquet room but our drinks were always full and the waiter seeing I was having problems eating noodles with my chop sticks brought us all forks and didn't embarrass me like Ive seen other servers do. 

It was a wonderful and authentic family style experience but my GF said it wasnt like how she remembered it as a child. If you know of another place in Vegas that does old school family style Chinese food and even includes the MSG; drop me a message Id love to hear about it and put a smile on her face.",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,5,_X7wSoQRv5HjnP3Li2-sjg

Very friendly service...felt welcome and right at home.  Amazing food!  Highly recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and Orange Chicken.  Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu.
