There was no hostess, so after waiting a few minutes, we seated ourselves at one of the two empty tables.  Neither had been cleared from the previous guests.  We waited about ten minutes, but no waitress or bus-staff appeared on the patio, even though it was busy.  Finally, a waitress showed up on the patio and helped a couple of tables.  As she was leaving, without stopping at our table, I asked her if she was our waitress.  She replied there was another person working the patio with her and said ""oh, you haven't been helped yet?""  and left.  We expected someone  to return with menus and to clean the table.  This did not happen, so after five minutes we left.  Management seems to be MIA and the staff appears to be poorly trained.

The restaurant was empty on a Saturday night?  Really?

Customer service was mediocre, the $6 draft beer was flat UGG.  Crazy no?  A cantina that can't get the beer right?  Their quality control is lacking, they are in a premium location .

237803,2015-11-09,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"My family and I normally love this place up until this past Friday night. I was lucky enough to come here prior to them opening to the public to sample and critique the Cantina. I loved it! we have been here a minimum of 10 times since then. Back to Friday Night and the 2 star rating! 
We get there at 9:00 pm, order our food, sit down outside, in a few minutes we get our food served by the gentleman from the kitchen. the waitress that was helping the other patrons outside literally blew us off completely.
There are 2 other tables being occupied, the manager comes outside and greets the couple next to us and asks how their evening is and if everything is alright, they chat for about a minute. He then proceeds to pass our table and goes to the next table and asks them the same questions, they chat a little longer, wait.. here comes the big issue.. the manager looks at me and my group with a look of disgust, turns and walks back inside! WTF!! seriously?! 
We paid for our food like everyone else in this place, why not ask us, how our food is? I did not want to make a big deal because I don't want the girls to feel uncomfortable, but the manager continues to stare at us from inside, but never came out again. 
My husband had to go to the front counter to ask for a to-go box and to refill our drinks. This is the first time I have ever felt so little in my life! Need less to say we did not leave a tip and i felt horrible, but like my husband said, since we were invisible to the waitress, she got an invisible tip too! She did nothing for us, not one word to us for the hour we were there. 
I hate to tell my daughter that we will not be going back, because, us being Mexican, we think the food is actually delicious. I dont fel comfortable returning. I was really hoping that is was not a racial issue (we are a biracial family) because this is the first time i had seen that certain manager and we were treated like crap.. but after reading some of the other reviews, they pick and choose who gets good service :( 
I will not recommend this place to anyone again. Good food, horrible service by those 2 who worked on 11/6/15.",IkqYOC_Skwc2lzI4yi_aNQ,3,1,2,_RVCFIlebN0tnmyI8oVIsg

Took them 10 mins to even come over and get our drink order. We had to ask them to place an order (like are you kidding). I double checked on Yelp to see if they were closing (since we went on a Sunday and they're times could be different) and they didn't close for another hour and half. Used the coupon on Yelp for the queso dip and they decided to not bring it out until all of our food was done. After we just sat there we had to ask them for the check (since they didn't really care about our table at all). And our bill was wrong. Sorry but I'll go and spend my money over at The cheesecake Factor or Kona Grill next time.,F2ivLpINsA-vuk-VzbLFew,1,0,1,QgmMU15SxGMFPT4aAYqa9A

We came in right after happy hour when it was slow. It took someone 10 minutes to approach us. We were not told about the self service chips and salsa until we asked for some. At that point we were told we have to get it ourselves. Weird. When we ordered we watched the waitress walk around for 5 minutes before putting our order in. After we were done eating it took another 15 minutes to get our check. The wait wouldn't have been a problem if they were busy but they weren't. Also the food wasn't great.

Speaking of happy, we were there during Happy Hour and though there are no food specials, the drinks are half off and with that, I had one of the best Margaritas I've ever had!  The beer selection is good and the well tequila was really, really good.  

We were there on their grand opening night (and totally by accident) and the service was ON POINT!  Every staff member we had contact with was friendly and happy; the manager and several other servers in the bar area kept checking back with us to make sure we had everything we needed and if everything was perfect.  Very attentive and genuinely concerned about our experience.  

A great experience and we will come back again and again!!!",iDheTUUbUcg09PwZdlX4Lw,1,1,5,OOzP29vEECBhLjS922umjg

When my dinner came out immediately I noticed the wrong beans on the plate. It was taken back and delivered with correct beans. As I took a few bites I then realized they did not put the correct sauce on top that I specified I wanted when I ordered. The waitress didn't come to check on the table for awhile and when she did she offered to bring a side of the sauce. At this point I was over it. The food wasn't the best and I will not be returning.

My boyfriend said the fish tacos were good as well. The food, for us has never been the problem, the service however, that's another story.

And it's not the fault of the servers! Management needs to get a clue, and have a hostess seating people, that's how you avoid two  people sitting at six tops and making your larger parties wait for tables. Do not let people seat themselves, its a mess. Also, give your servers a busser, we were there during their happy hour on a Monday and it was busy, but the only had 3 servers working, and no bussers, and no one seating people. That's why it takes 20 minutes to get drinks out. Its not fair to your servers, as it effects their tips and their ability to make money.

All of the flavors were odd and disappointing. Nothing I ordered mentioned cilantro yet it was found all over my meal. The fried avocado was heavy, oily, and just not good.

My friend is vegan and she specifically said vegan. The waitress comes out with the vegetarian salad which my friend ordered and had dairy on it-yogurt (the waitress should have mentioned about dairy). As a waitress, you should know the menu and know the difference between vegan and vegetarian. As soon as my friend got her salad she asked what the dressing was and the waitress didn't know. She went back to the kitchen to ask. 

Then, my dish was wrong. I ordered Baja shrimp and I got carne asada. Whole order already messed up. I feel like the waitress was paying attention more to the guys at the bar than us-it was pretty slow in there.

My wife and I ordered chicken nachos, steak tacos, chips and guacamole, and tried all of their salsas at the salsa bar. 

My wife and I only ate half of a steak taco, three nacho chips, two bites of guacamole, and a few dips of salsa. Everything but the chips was terrible. The chips were just standard low end chips.

The nachos, chicken, and salsas can be summed up with the phrase, ""what is that flavor?"" For the chicken it was something red that doesn't quite taste like tomatoes. For the fresca salsa it was something that tasted like tomatillo but not, and was much stronger. For the hotter salsas it was something that reminded me of a mole, a deep rich flavor that clashed hard with the salsa. For the nachos it was a combo of whatever makes the chicken gross and something green that I have no idea what to compare to. 

The steak tacos were a complete joke. Easily some of the lowest quality meat we've had. Even by Mexican restaurant standards. We weren't expecting filet or ribeye, but this meat was just pure gristle and tendon. Totally unacceptable. 

Finally the guacamole. It might as well have been a bowl of cilantro. There was so much cilantro it was completely inedible for both of us. My wife looked at me incredulously when I called it ""inedible"". Sometimes when it comes to cilantro I can exaggerate a bit. So she took a bite, looked at me with a funny look on her face, and said, ""wow, you're right: inedible.""

In the end -- about 4 minutes after the beginning -- we got up, still hungry, and walked away from a still-full table of terrible food.

Only the Original Margarita is discounted (down to $5), and it's a full-sized glass instead of the typical lowball glass one might expect. I don't know if I'd splurge the $10+ for a specialty version, but the lychee one sounds delicious.

Food menu is pretty basic, with two-taco plates running $10, additional options for burritos and nachos. They get bonus points for offering vegetarian options and barbacoa, which has been difficult to find in Las Vegas- their version isn't great, but it's adequate. The $7 order of nachos (+$2 for protein) is on par with Chipotle in terms of size, taste, and price. 

The service was really great, Mario and his sidekick were friendly and outgoing and checked up on us frequently. Aside from that, this place was a bit more average than I had hoped for. Considering Hussong's has been around 120+ years, the food was very Americanized... as were the prices.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,5,3,KgM5k5hOtKx4g1EdRIdTNw

I checked in on yelp and asked to use my check in offer which didn't specify dine in only but I was told that it was. 

I ordered a veggie burrito and vegan tacos.
When he read my order back he said vegan burrito. I said I ordered a veggie burrito he corrected himself and said he was indeed and veggie and NOT and vegan burrito. 
We also ordered two sides of rice. 

He was super rude on the phone and kinda rude in person. But showed me a new expanded vegan menu and we talked briefly about the other locations because I work at Mandalay bay. I said thank you that was nice of you and nothing no thank you good night just weird bad customer service. 

When I got home to eat there were not two sides if rice and they gave me the Vegan Burrito that I specifically said I did NOT want. It was an awful burrito. I didn't eat it. It was full of green chiles and I was so dissapointed because I drove super far out of my way to go there. The experience was lack luster. I didn't eat my ten dollar burrito. And my friend didn't get anything because they didn't add the rice. 

The food itself is good but they have to get there service on point to make this location successful. It'll take more than a good happy hour.

The drink was huge that we ordered. When they say it's good for two they mean it's good to get two people drunk. 64 Oz margarita called the romance really did me in that night. It had fresh fruit in it like strawberries and mango. I had fun fishing them out. 

I ordered the enchiladas. They were delicious. I had way too much food though and took most of it home. I had delicious yummy leftovers the next day. They still tasted good the next day. 

I noticed a deal on yelp that we ended up not using but for those of you wanting an even better deal go for it. I felt too bad using it after the manager gave us enough chips to feed a whole other person. 

Customer service was amazing and we had an amazing table and experience. Right next to the lite fountains. When the manager brought us out there he called it the bellagio fountain show. Really funny actually cause it did look like a mini fountain show.

My date got the cheese enchiladas and I could tell he wasn't that pleased with his either, but he still finished it.  I didn't even eat half of mine, even though I was starving.

The steak and barbacoa tacos were the better options. The chicken taco was okay, but the meat wasn't very flavorful. The carnitas taco was dry and probably the worst option. The tacos were served on soft corn tortillas, that looked heated in oil. They serve their plates with cilantro lime rice and pinto beans. 

The service wasn't bad. The bartender took our order and a waitress showed up to see if we were doing okay and  brought our food. 

Unlike other places this one charges $2 for bottomless chips and salsa. Not a fan of this...especially if you're charging $10 for 2 tacos w rice and beans (add $$ if you want a 3 taco plate). The salsa is a self serve salsa bar with 4 types of salsa. A mild pico de gallo red (meh), tomatillo (the best option), a spicy red sauce (2nd best option), and the fourth was a spicy green. 

Bottom line, the food wasn't exceptional and it cost $38 +tip for x2 3 taco plates with rice and beans with chips/salsa and 2 beers. Not cheap for a Mexican style lunch. I should mention they have cheaper prices on the menu for happy hour (3-6pm), but I wouldn't make a special trip for HH.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,1,0,3,vRcCKkThnbwiz_sbVCLL2w

Now our drink (a strawberry margarita mixed with a lemon ice marg) was amazing. It's on the pricier end $10, but man do they pour the damn alcohol in it. Like seriously, I could burn off half my face with the amount they put, which to me, is a good thing. Though I only drank a quarter of the thing. Too bad. Next time ;)

The burrito was where I had a problem, and why I've reduced the star count. I enjoyed it, it was definitely a good burrito, however, our waiter asked me if I wanted it ""california style"" which I've surprisingly never heard of, being from california myself. I asked how much  more it was, and he said around a dollar. The burrito itself is $12. And when he said it would have avocado and potatoes I agreed. Sure, more food for not much. Well, my burrito had a few specs of avocado and no potatoes in it. Also, when I got my bill the burrito came out to be around $15. Last time I checked 12 + ~1 does not equal 15. Also, even without the upcharge, this is waaaay too expensive for what you get.

Walking in the vibe reminds me more of a cantina located on the beach. Not an authentic Mexican cantina. The waitresses were friendly but short of awesome. Amanda are server was great at refilling our drinks and keeping us with food in front of us. 

The steak tacos had to be some of the worst tacos I've ever had. The shell was that awkward in between.. Was it hard? Was it soft? It was like a soft tortilla was half way fried. Not good. The fillings were minimal. The Barbacoa filling was delicious but again the shell Was confusing. 

Salsa was normal, nothing super tasty. Chicken quesadilla was amazing. The aioli inside was chipotle. Tangy goodness. Margarita was good too but it wasn't out of the ordinary since it was a margarita mix. The Elote was good but I've had better on street corners.

Our waitress was nice, the atmosphere was cool, but the one star lies in the quality of the food/drinks. 

We ordered a pitcher of white sangria, and what we got was a pitcher of what looked like 7up with maraschino cherries in it and tasted like a non alcoholic Capri Sun. Zero buzz was had.

Chips and salsa next. They brought out a tray of three different types of salsa that i guess maybe they make there? Pineapple, Chipotle and Habanero. The only remotely good one was the habanero. The other two were literally so awful we didn't touch them after one taste. 

On recommendation from the server, I ordered the pork belly tacos. My wife ate the carne asada tacos. Both dishes lacked serious flavor, and the pork belly, for some reason, was diced up extremely small in the taco. When ive had pork belly, its always been whole so you can really get the flavor and texture from the fat and the meat. This was just strange. 

At the very end of the meal, our waitress finally brought us the waters we asked for when we ordered the Sangria. We were already paying the bill. Thanks for that.

Also, WAY overpriced.",eXfFtPOBc5v_sNCo_wzKfQ,4,0,1,QkyXRPc2kfieV0CogEyLlA

Bad management is really the issue here. Either they're understaffed to serve an 80% full house or no one knows who has what tables.

A colleague and I were joking and saying how a drive-through Alberto's is better than anything in this town. Well, I have to say I am rather impressed.
The ambiance is very casual, which is wonderful for lunch. Don't know how the restaurant is during dinner time (since Boca Park restaurants are a zoo during dinner and weekends). 
We had two servers, one who greeted us, gave us the history of the restaurant, explained the menu and made some recommendations. The service was on point, enough attention not pushy or overly annoying- just perfect. The chips were fresh and very delicious. The array of salsas that we could choose from was plentiful. I really like the spicier choices. Their original margarita was wonderful. I ordered the combo tacos (Baja shrimp and Carne Asada). Baja shrimp was best outside of Baja, Mexico. Carne Asada one was filled with flavor. I really enjoyed the beans, they were creamy and delicious.

Finally saw the sign to go to the counter and headed that way. 
Server at counter said Hi then I asked her to explain this concept and she did. Somewhat I got from her was basically this is a cafeteria  with a bar. You order from service counter then get a long stick with a number of  it and then go sit down. Some drinks come from  the bar and some they give you before you leave the counter where you also pay before you leave there. Sat àt the bar and bartender served my beer then the counter person brought our food out on a tray and took long stick with number.

Despite its rich long term history due to its namesake and original location, this restaurant seems like it just tries too hard to be hip and cool and ends up resembling something more like Carl's Jr. but lacking the cheap eats value. 

When you enter, you are asked to order from a counter. Then you can opt for ""full service"" where the waitstaff will supposedly check on you and refill your drinks. To opt for this service you must leave a CC at the counter to establish an open tab, regardless of whether or not you accrue additional charges. Then once you order, you are given a number and told your food will be delivered to your table. How they know who is ""full service"" and who isn't I have no idea and it didn't really matter anyway as we left a CC with them yet not ONCE did a waiter come by to offer refills or check on us. 

We left the table to refill our own drinks from the soda fountain and collect our CC prior to departure. The best value we experienced here was our lack of need to tip. 

Overall, the only reason I gave a 2 star instead of 1 is I did enjoy the overall aesthetics. The kitschy 80's and 90's era toys like Stay Puft Marshmallow man and PeeWee Herman doll were nostalgic and cute. But when it comes to the food and service, stick to Carl's Jr. At least when they deliver the food they usually ask if you need anything else.

Chips and salsa were good. I liked to trio of salsas. One was a grilled pineapple flavor sweet with a hint of spice. Chipotle had a nice smokey flavor to it. The third was very refreshing almost like a bruscheta flavor. 

Elote was really good. Grilled perfectly with the right amount of cheese, mayo, and lime. 

Enchilada platter was a large portion of tres stuffed corn tortillas.  Choice of chicken, carnitas, or barbacoa.  I chose one of each and I think the carnitas was my favorite.

May have been a blessing in disguise as they were really good. Drinks also were good,  I had a mango mojito and the hubby had a nice ice cold corona. Being that it was our first time they gave us chips along with a queso Chile bowl. The atmosphere was pretty mellow as it was mid week when we went . Asked the waitress if they show the football games with the sound as we have found many restaurants show the game, but no sound, she said they always have it on for games and that it gets pretty busy but that they have lots of different drink and food specials. She was very apologetic for the food mix up but attempted to fix it right away when we told her about it, but hubby was very hungry so decided to keep the enchiladas.

Walked into a dining room buzzing with several servers, and was directed to seat ourselves.

Shortly after we had menus brought over. The menu is a bit strange in its format, but once you figure it out it is fine. It is divided into protein, style, sauces, etc that you basically ""build your own"" - I did a simple fish tacos, my friend did a pork rice bowl. You get the idea. They are all $9.95 (with upgrade options)

The food was good. I think I liked my tacos better than my friend liked his rice bowl. The endless salsa bar was a great addition. They had some awesome flavors available, from super hot to smokey roasted. The salsas helped kick up the flavor!

Service was surprisingly attentive. Even though it was clear that our server was running around helping a very busy dining room. Really, she was hustling that room, and doing a great job in the process!

Overall, it was good. I would go back because it is close and I like Boca Mall shops. If it was opposite side of the city, not sure I would venture just for this.",y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g,5,2,3,WYpZCSD42dO9K_ovAD5m6g

3008572,2018-06-06,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"Hussong's consistently bad service is unbelievable.  Their original business model had you ordering at a counter and they brought your food and drinks very promptly.  But for several years now they have had a full-service business model and have the worst service of any restaurant in Boca Park and probably the entire west side.

Expect to be ignored, not seated in a timely manner, and never see your server.  Your best bet is usually to beg the bartender for what you need.  They are usually helpful.  

We have tried to give them a chance on 6 different occasions since they've become a full-service restaurant over the past couple years.  The service has been consistently horrible.  It's a tragic shame because the food and drinks are wonderful.  

Today my friends and I tried one last time.  After a very long wait to be seated (not due to them being busy) and of not having a server come to our table to take our order, all 7 of us got up and left incredibly frustrated.  Never again.

3043636,2015-07-24,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"Let me begin with walking through the door. The decor is a tad off and didn't make much sense. This is not an actual restaurant either. You have to order your food and then sit down, i.e. chipotle. If you sit at the bar however, you get full service.
Well, the best thing about this place was Amanda the bartender. She was so amazing and attentive. If we were to return it would be to just sit at the bar and have her make us the amazing margaritas she made for us. My husband had the original and I had the El Pepino. Awesome!
The food was mediocre. The chips and salsa were like from the grocery store. The chips were stale and had no flavor. The salsa (they have 4 to choose from) were nothing to talk about. When we made our order with Amanda she asked if we wanted some guacamole. She offered us regular or mango habanero. We decided to try the mango habanero, I mean why not? Well, I guess the statement ""don't fix what's not broke"" definitely applies here. The girl Summer who brought it out to us literally threw it on the bar and said ""mango habanero"" and walked away. Talk about the poorest of customer service skills. 
The worst part was the manager Chris. Everyone can understand being in control of your employees and making sure the jobs is being done. However, I don't respect a manager reprimanding, micro-managing or being disrespectful to his employees in front of patrons. This is exactly what we witnessed. Very uncomfortable. Also, I went to get some salsa and he made me move around him instead of stepping aside to let me pass. One out of respect for a lady and two for a paying customer. 
The bottom line is we were excited to try a new place close to home that we could frequent and unfortunately this is not the case. 
I will most definitely not return for the food but, may just to have a drink with the only person that had any customer service skills Amanda.
I'm sorry to be frank but, when we spend over $60 dollars and this was the service and quality of food we received I strongly feel others should know too. I mean this is why we Yelp, is it not?",ygkpsZ-JKp8p8hiX4PWx0w,0,0,1,hUyfM1QL7qx_QXI9-7xPTQ

We were greeted by Zack. Who I loved. Bright smile, engaging, cracked some jokes... everything you want in a server. I would like to see him move on to a higher-end restaurant on the strip. 

Chips&Salsa ADD GUAC- Chips were hot and fresh, I could've eaten 3 more baskets. The guac was limey, I loved it and basically ate the whole bowl to myself but hubby thought it was too much. Our girls demolished the salsa.

My not daughters ordered chicken fingers ... you can't really mess that up so I'll move on.

Chicken tacos- full of flavor. The rice was typical but the beans were not what you'd expect - in a good way... almost like refried beans and Bush's BBQ baked beans had a baby.

Steak barbacoa fajitas- marinated. Steak. So much yes.


In addition to our feast hubby and I enjoyed margaritas. El Pepino & The Skinny. Both well balanced and sized appropriately. I'll order them again.

Yummy food!  Great flavored taco combos with refried beans and rice.  They do fried avocado too.  It can be ordered on the side like avocado fries.  Warning: addictive.

They have a margarita of the month, made with muddled cherries.  Strong stuff.  Works well for relaxation during dining.  Try it!

We tried their shrooms and veggie delight taco combo, and their chicken and steak taco combo plates.  The chicken has pineapple in it!  Wow delish!  The steak is made with pickled onions and had a very nice spice kick to it.  For sure would order the steak ones again.

The restaurant is a fairly large center bar with TV's and very casual seating inside and outside.  TV's along the walls all around and paraphernalia galore of anything and everything it seems.  Looks like a collector's arrangement of many interests.  

Cool place to hangout.  Good day to come in apparently is a Wednesday; it isn't busy.  Service is polite and simple.  This side of the parking lot however is hectic.  Have patience and have another margarita.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,34,30,4,WvSMw0pM7OPz_uelmDurjQ

I think if I were to go without the Groupon this place would be way too expensive for Mexican food. I didn't like the fact that you had to pay for bottomless chips and salsa either. Their salsa was good but not anything remarkable about it. I ordered the chimichanga with carnitas and red sauce and the burrito was great. I love the red sauce sort of thick so it was perfect for me. The rice however wasn't anything special, very basic. I did however get their street corn and that was great!

3517466,2015-11-11,9,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"I hate to say it, but I like this place. Some may be turned off the the over-flare-ification of the interior or the high-priced Mexican fare (at least compared to hole-in-the-wall spots). But, the tacos and street corn won me over. The char and prominent cotija flavor of the former make it worth getting, especially when it's free for checking in. 

As for the tacos, the pork belly is my favorite. Balanced sweet and savoriness, varied texture with the cabbage mix and most importantly it was topped with chicharrones. What's not to like? The barbacoa was a close runner-up. Who cares if it was messy with its sauce dripping everywhere. It's still bold flavored and delicious. 

Less noteworthy, but still decent were the chicken tacos and carnitas. Taco platters come with two tacos, which you can mix-and-match. Rice and beans can be hit or miss. The first time around the rice was better than almost any rice I've tried at a Mexican restaurant -- light, fluffy and buttery. The second time around... not so much. Still, Hussongs is a worthy spot to hit up as long as you don't mind paying a little more for tacos.

My girlfriend was seated at a patio table when I arrived.  She had chips and a water.  She said the hostess told her it would be about 15 minutes before a server got to her so I arrived in that 15 minute window and still no server. After about 10 additional minutes and making eye contact with what appeared to be a couple servers on the patio still nothing.  I flagged someone down and asked if we could place a drink order.  She said who's your server, and we responded we did not have one to which she responded, how did you get the chips then. I mean why are we being questioned how chips appeared on our table.  So needless to say it didn't start off too well.  So this person became our server by default.  According to my receipt her name was Jasmine.  

We ordered tacos, quesadilla, guacamole and queso, which was free via Yelp check in. The guacamole was good but I was not a fan of the queso and would not order it again even for free.  I enjoyed the frozen swirl margarita which is the traditional margarita with flavor of choice mixed in.  I tried the raspberry and strawberry.   I like the salsa bar choices versus most restaurants that offer spicy or mild.  

During our time there two parties had dogs so the patio is dog friendly and I am a fan of that.  Overall, I was not a fan of the initial slow service but once Jasmine became our server we didn't have any other issues and she was helpful making recommendations.

3592477,2015-07-27,3,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"Man I wish margaritas weren't so delicious and refreshing. 

When you walk into a place and the barkeep tells you they are the inventors of the ""Original Margarita"", well you might as well stick a fork in me, 'cause I ain't going nowhere anytime soon.

In case you're wondering, the ""Original Margarita"" is a damn fine margarita.

My barkeep was House, and he was just about as brilliant as his more famous medical namesake.

I started with the Mexican corn. Mexican corn is a truly odd experience for a Midwestern kid who was raised on corn-on-the-cob. Back home, the only way people cooked corn-on-the-cob was in a pot of boiling water, a method which all but removes every bit of flavor from the corn (it's a wonder I wasn't culinarily scarred for life). 

Forgive the tangent here, but if I could travel back in time, I would go back to my grade school self and introduce myself to Mexican Corn (and then we would explode into non-existence when we make contact in the congratulatory high five).

Needless to say, there is a reason the Mexican Corn is pretty much the only picture on the menu. No matter what else you try, you need to try the Mexican Corn.

House picked two tacos for me and kept the margaritas flowing. I will honestly admit I cannot remember which tacos I got, but that may be due to House's master mixology skills. I can say, without a doubt, that they were two of the best I have ever had.

The prices here are quite high, which is the sole reason for the missing star. I'm not completely saying the price point doesn't match the food and service quality, but the prices need to come down a little bit to be a 5 star joint, especially on the ""Original Margarita"", which hits you at a whopping $10 a piece. 

But the good news, happy hour has the ""Original Margarita"" at half price. Guess where you'll be finding me from now on?",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,7,4,4,zJhfKq0e_2dMEhVcJOHoJw

I just wanted a snack so I only got a taco and chips with salsa. I ordered the chicken taco, while the bartender recommended something more adventurous like the fried avocado taco, but also said the chicken tacos were good as well. It was so much better than I expected a chicken taco could be! Just an interesting mix of flavors and I'm a huge pineapple fan so that made it a memorable little lunch for me.
I also really enjoyed the chipotle salsa. I don't typically like smokey flavors much but the chipotle salsa is the perfect mix of smokey and sweet; they even sell it by the pint for less than five bucks (you can't even beat that at the grocery store). By the time my boyfriend met up with me, I was ready for one of their margaritas, which they say are the best in town. I can't say whether or not that is true, as I haven't had many margaritas in Las Vegas, but it was a pretty good and fresh- and natural-tasting cocktail - and as my SO pointed out, *very strong* haha.",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,2,1,4,a9Dzu2kqZsD5DAtfOyLafw

I was looking for something with a specific flavour that I couldn't find on the menu so the bartender was nice enough to create something for me that was delicious.
A great touch are the fun games such as Jenga and Os and Xs at the bar that you can play to pass the time. 
The only reason to drop a star is that the desserts left a little to be desired. The deep fried ice cream in particular with fruit coulis was literally a scoop of vanilla, wrapped in frosted flakes and accompanied with less than 1 strawberry. No 'coulis' in sight. Definitely not worth the money and a disappointing dish.",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,1,1,4,z7sv2r8xob_MoImOU8za4w

Basic tacos are $3, special happy hour drinks are $5-$7, chips and salsa is .95 and guacamole is $2.45. There are also items for happy hour on the menu. The drinks are strong but not over the top. The bottomless chips and salsa are good - you choose your salsa from a salsa bar and the guacamole is fresh and well made, but a small portion. The steak taco I had was a bit on the spicy side. The taco was decent sized, but I felt it could have a had a bit more meat. We also had a chicken quesadilla melt, which was delicious. The service was uneven. Our first server was on top of things, but we ended up having to move tables, and the second server was not very visible. Overall, the prices made up for the small issues.

Got seated right away and our server, Angelica, was super quick and attentive!

Ordered:

Classic Margarita
Strawberry Swirl Margarita

Chips and Salsa (Serve yourself Salsa Bar) .95c

Guacamole $2.95

Queso Bean Dip $4.96 (free with Yelp check in offer)

The restaurant is known for inventing the original margarita, so I thought I'd give it a try. They definitely want to charge you for the history and a margarita was quite underwhelming. Now onto the service. Number one, the manager never checked to see if our food was any good and asked us if this was our first time, Which replied yes it was.

First off they had all day happy hour on Sunday which was awesome and the decor inside was very fun and reminiscent of Mexico. 

The sign on the door said best of Las Vegas for their margaritas and I completely agree. I had the original margarita on the rocks, just the right balance of sour and tequila. As for food we shared some complimentary chips, salsa and queso bean dip since it was our first time there. We also had a couple of the tacos and the carne asada fajita.

I had the carnitas salad, which consisted of romaine lettuce, pickled onions, carnitas and some awful pork rind thingies. Nothing particularly interesting, inventive or good about it. The food came quickly and the margarita was fine. 

Another thing that bugged me was one of the giant TVs was tuned to a network evening news program.

This time I made sure to try some different things. We ordered a 3 taco plate with two fried fish tacos & a vegan 'fish' taco which came with rice and beans, a regular margarita, sangría, chips and salsa, and the vegan chocolate cake. 

I really enjoyed the fish tacos and I recommend them over the other meats such as beef, chicken and pork.
Also the vegan fish taco makes a pretty good substitute for fish. I'd order it again! 
One thing we weren't a fan of was the rice. My brother mentioned that the rice tasted like instant rice and after that we didn't really touch it. 

The chips and salsa and guacamole were all good. The chips were light and airy, out of the three salsas that came with it we enjoyed the Chipotle one the most because of its smokey sweet flavor. We got that one refilled a few times. 

As for the drinks, we ordered about three margaritas. Honestly the margaritas here are so good. It's perfectly sour, salty and sweet. I'd come back to hussong's just for them. :) They have other flavor options available too but I stuck to the original because I knew it was good. 

My brother got a sangria which I tasted and it was OK! I have to say I prefer the ones at firefly a lot more. I'll stick to the margaritas!

We finished with the vegan chocolate cake again, I really like the flavor of the pb frosting and the sour tomatillo sauce. :) 

Prices are very reasonable, if you go at the right time. 3 of us ate and drank for around $60+tip. Not bad at all!

That's the problem with Hussong's, the food at best is ok but their use of processed cheese makes so many of their dishes underwhelming. Our friends got there first and ordered a dish of melted white cheese mixed with processed cheese, and chips and salsa, which unfortunately were the highlight of the meal. The salsa was tasty but had not even a hint of heat. We had their happy hour menu -tacos of chicken, carnitas, barbacoa, a quesadilla, their original margaritas and the bulldog. The barbacoa was not bad, much much better than at hip fusion Mexican restaurants. The carnitas and chicken tacos we didn't like and our friends found them unpalatable as well. The quesadilla didn't have much cheese and had a strange layer of chips inside. I assume they were there to add texture but by the time the got to our table it was just more soggy tortilla.

The margaritas were delicious but a tad sweet and not very strong. The bulldog is a margarita crowned with a beer on top. I liked that the beer helped cut down on the sweetness and added a carbonated fizz. When I think of margaritas and tacos I think of the long gone Mercadito at Red Rock Casino during their first couple of years they produced strong distinctively delicious margaritas and a variety of scrumptious tacos before downgrading their food to save money.  Compared to that standard Hussong's food is just average at best. 

Some people have had issue with the service but our server, Bridget, was outstanding she was quick, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere is trendy Mexican restaurant-not upscale-but warm and friendly. Overall the food is just tame toned down homogenized Mexican food.",TxYvDePA67VeFBwnh-wr8A,0,0,3,aYxWGrRJzXIzPUWt2Quz0g

5217916,2017-10-29,2,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"Yum yum yum yum yummy!

Always in search for a great Mexican place, and viola! I found one!

I had dropped my dear friend off at a nearby salon and to kill time I needed to eat and was craving Mexican, I didn't know this restaurant was here as it had been a steak place prior and so I yelped and was happily surprised to find this spot..

As per usual when I find a new restaurant I always order too much food as to try and find out not only are my favorite dishes good but are the other dishes as well... I was very much surprised to find out that the food was so delicious and flavorful 

Every bite tasted fresh and so mouthwatering yummy

Ok, on the order docket was

To start off was the guacamole, with chips and salsa ...now if you have read some of my other posts you will know that as my friends tease me, ice is sometimes spicy for me (ha ha) so when it said that it had jalapeños in it I asked them to not add them, the waitress informed me that they cannot remove them as the guacamole is made daily and they have already been added, however she said that the way they are added it just adds flavor not spice and she would take it off the ticket if I couldn't handle it, so I had nothing to lose but a few tears of spicy rendering if it was too much for me... I was so happily surprised.. it was not only fresh tasting but had a great lime tang to it that wasn't expected . (I have become a snob and expected table-side guacamole but that is not necessary here at all!)

Stacked quesadilla with chicken (I know you think boring huh? Nope!) soooooo deliciousness, it came with fresh pick and the guacamole! Was holy!

Chicken flautas, flour tortillas were yummy and it was cooked to perfection

The table also ordered chicken tacos, and the tray of all flavor tacos to get a sample of all
And the winner was all

I normally order enchiladas but I didn't for a weird reason but instead I asked the waitress for a side sample of all enchilada sauces so I could taste and know if I would be tempted to try next time and she didn't even skip a beat and I have to say, they were not spicy just very flavorful and in my opinion I would rather taste the food with amazing flavor instead of covering with too much spice (my opinion and because I can't do spice lol)

We were tempted to order more but with my tiny tummy I only ate one slice of the quesadilla and a half of one of the flautas and a few chips and I was full.. yes there was food to go but it was even delicious later.

So worth trying and the ambience of the restaurant was so wonderful 
Not a ton of tables, a great pub and food spot if your hungry for Mexican and the game is on, I highly recommend this place and it doesn't hurt that they have great margaritas as well!

Enjoy!

5278208,2017-12-10,6,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"The vegan menu at Hussong's is freaking amazing. Standouts include the ""fish"" Baja tacos and Mexican corn on the cob. There's even a few breakfast choices, but dinner is where it's at. First thing's first, bottomless tortilla chips are served with not one but three salsas ($1.95)! 

You can choose from either fish, beef, or chicken (vegan) tacos. My husband tried all 3 and we both agree, the fish tacos are the winner here. The fish Baja tacos are topped with a cabbage medley and aioli that is just the bees knees. The Baja taco entree ($13.95) is served with rice and beans and comes with two tacos. It's super filling, especially after you've been stuffing your pie hole with chips and salsa. 

Service has always been great here and it's never too busy. I have yet to try the house margarita, though. I'm looking forward to an all-day happy hour on a Sunday in the future.

5438346,2016-01-28,2,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"If your looking for a great Mexican restaurant, don't go to Hussong's! That has got to be the worst restaurant I've eaten at since I've been in Vegas 12 years & I eat out a lot ! There's a lot of great restaurants in this town & I can honestly say this has been THE ONLY bad restaurant we've been to...so what does that tell you??
The whole experience was terrible...starting with their salsa sauce! How do you mess that up? They do....
It's tangy & tart...I didn't taste any garlic or cilantro...very bland & tangy ...no zip to it! And for starters, they are the only place I know that charges for chips & salsa in a Mexican restaurant . It's only $1.95, but it's the principle , & their chips are aweful too! Thick & hard...I like thin & airy chips.
So that's the 1st 2 things wrong. I order a frozen margarita, it comes out on the rocks, so I send it back. The guy brings it out to me frozen, but with no garnish?? Maybe they're saving their limes...who  knows, but I take the 1st sip, & my mouth started to draw up on the sides from it being so tart, so I bring it to the bar & asked the guy if he could put more triple sec in it to sweeten it up a bit & he takes the drink from my hands & goes behind the bar & puts a topper of triple sec in my drinks & hands it back to me...all with not saying 2 words to me! I stir it up, taste it, but couldn't tell a difference, so I said I need more in it. Let me drink it down a bit so you can add some more. He seemed annoyed that I was even asking, but I went to hand him my glass again, but instead he reaches down for a shot glass & fills it 1/2 full w triple sec & I said that's perfect & picked the shot glass up & walked back to my table. That's when I realized this guy has got an attitude, cause this whole process has gone on & still not one word from him! As a paying customer, he made me feel like I was a pain in the ass, but the real truth is....if they had a good bartender that knew how to make drinks, I wouldn't be bothering him to fix this drink that sucks, cause my drink would be spot on!

Next, we order our food...Dom & I both order cheese enchiladas. I ordered mine w extra cheese & green sauce. I ask our server what kind of cheese do you have...cheddar, Jack ? She says no we don't have either of those...we use this Mexican cheese blend, so I said ok, not really knowing what these enchiladas are going to look like. She walks off & Dominic says to me ""if they don't have cheese, then how are they making our cheese enchiladas"" & I said good question. I get up from the table & walk over to her as she's putting our order in & I ask her that question. She says well, it's a blend that we use & I said does it melt? Cause I like a stretchy cheese on mine & she says yea, it melts & I said ok & don't forget extra cheese on mine & she says yes I know. The meal comes out & mine looks exactly like doms...- no extra cheese, both had a drizzle of a thin white sauce on top. There is NO CHEESE AT ALL THAT WAS VISABLE....huh ? None on top of the enchiladas nor on the refried beans...NO WHERE! I  don't say anything & we both start eating & Dom says this tastes like shit & I said I was thinking the same thing...but didn't want to complain since I already started off complaining about my margarita , but when he said that , I said OMG , I was  thinking the same thing! I thought it was just me thinking this food just doesn't taste right, but we both were on the same page ! That Mexican cheese they used to make the enchiladas sucks! No cheese on top & the extra sauce I ordered (green sauce) that she charged me for...I never touched cause that too was very tart & sucked! It was so dark green, I thought maybe it was seaweed puréed ...lol , no kidding...that's their green sauce...dark & tangy!
When I tell you nothing was good in this place...I mean it!!!
This place is not a true authentic Mexican restaurant ...I think maybe they're from the Middle East & that's middle eastern  food or cook  we had...look at the name ""Hussong's "", maybe Asian ...whatever it is, DON'T GO! I promise you'll be disappointed just like we were! I knew something was off when I'm in a ""Mexican restaurant "" & the music that's playing is classic rock ! Where's the ambiance of being in a Mexican restaurant ? I thought I was at PT's pub for a minute .... What a joke this place is!!!!!
They don't even deserve the 1 star I gave them, cause the whole place had an attitude! That place won't make it...you watch! They took over Embers space in Boca Park by the Cheesecake Factory . What a waste of $30 that was...I only wish I would have taken a pic of the food so I could have posted it here so you could see for yourselves that everything I've said is true! Neither one of us could finish  our meals, & it wasn't because we got full...because it was all we could do to eat 1/2 of it, that's how  bad it was! We both had 1/2 our meal still on our plates when we left....we just wanted to get out of there !
That was our 1st time there & our last",22laZkhv3jlWIEttT6HU1g,3,0,1,3JNYCeL4qu7i5wHpZbX0YA

It was incredibly dead when we got there, 5 other people in the whole place. There were quite a few employees wandering around doing nothing, but it still took us a good 5 minutes to be acknowledged and seated. 

Once we were seated it took forever for our waitress to come ask if we wanted drinks and to order. We had multiple questions about the menu and she looked like a deer in headlights and could barely answer our simple questions about what came on the nachos and tacos...then we found she was incorrect in her answers when the food came. It took me over 10 minutes to get the side of sour cream I asked for after my nachos came out. By the time it finally showed up after asking for it twice my nachos were soggy. They were also the most mediocre nachos I've had. My friend asked for a cup of melted cheese or melted queso dip and we had to explain multiple times and ways to the waitress what she was asking for. She then brought a cup of shredded cheese.

5692274,2017-01-07,1,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"I feel torn between 3-4 stars for this place. But I'll go with 3. 

We bought a Groupon ($20 for $40) which was good. Started with the guac for $5.95 which comes with bottomless chips and salsa. The guac was good, not great. It was heavy on the tomatoes which I'm not a fan of. But it's a good price for an easy app. Also comes with chicharrones on the side. Never had a pork rind in my life, but gotta be honest- they're pretty good. Almost like rice cakes with more flavor. The actual chips that come with the salsa trio are not great. 

My husband had the vegetarian chimichanga. He really liked his, although wish it came with rice/beans or anything on the side. I ordered the carne asada fajitas. The meat was delicious, flavorful and cooked to perfection. I was not a fan of the rice or beans. But the onions, peppers, corn and potatoes were seasoned well and a nice side. Tortillas were delicious. 

We also had a pitcher of margaritas that a friend helped us with. The pitcher was 36.00 and was worth with it. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice and helpful. I guess the vibe seemed dull to me, being we were some of the only people in the restaurant at that time. The story behind Hussong's is actually really interesting and being that's it's one of only a couple others aside from the original in Mexico, I would think they would have gone with a more authentic decor. Just my take.  Would probably go back again, only with another Groupon.",xrvyW1ruKS0uz9RtFewC0Q,4,6,3,Y3JOpXP8JSyVrKvuu87ACw

5706851,2018-01-12,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,I found about this place almost a year ago... I couldn't get enough.. the food was really good but what stuck out to me the most was the 5 different salsa they would give you and their very delicious guacamole my friends and I would fight over! Needless to say my husband and I hadn't been in a couple months so we were really excited to have our guac and salsa we always like to get... not the case anymore.... they got rid of 2 and the 3 remaining did not taste the same... I had to squeeze the lime from my margarita in my guac as well as salt and pepper.. I have never had to dress my guacamole up. I expressed my concern to the bartender who was really nice and she explained they were under new management and i could totally tell. Luckily the margaritas didn't change and they were still delicious but we left really disappointed and will more than likely not come back and give our friends a heads up so they won't waste their time either,5KSApbAHQzJEfoprQ6ejPg,0,0,3,mBqSqj8eKt5QeQsz8DT2sw

5749937,2015-09-12,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"Since learning about Hussong's Cantina while in Ensenada, MX a month ago and visiting the Original location opened in 1892 I have been a fan of this place as a bar establishment. 
Finding out that there was another location (Mandala Bay) here in Vegas was very exciting but driving through Boca Park and seeing Hussong's in an old restaurant location I had previously visited I was more than EXCITED!! 

Walking up to Hussong's there is a visible outside covered Patio location with Bar Tops and a few 2-4 seating tables, patio is not super big and on this day when we arrived it was somewhat empty but filled very quickly. 

Walking into the restaurant we were quickly greeted by a hostess/server that asked us if we had been here before. I said no only the one in Mexico. She then proceeded to tell us how to order food/drinks from the walk up counter and we would be given a table # Flag, then we could sit anywhere we like and the food/drinks would be brought out. 

*TIP: Be sure to tell the staff when ordering you would like to keep your tap open if you want more drinks. 

We did not order food but certainly ordered The Original Margarita to see if it lived up to its Standard in Mexico! Drinks were on Happy Hour Special 3-6pm M-F. 

As we sat on patio the drinks were quickly severed and they were certainly strong and tasty! Not quite as strong as the Mexico drinks, however, in there defense, that was Mexico :-)

The food looked good and will certainly be back to try that! There is a center bar located inside the restaurant along with a few TV's which has sports playing at the time. 

Again, I am fan overall and happy this place is near by at Boca Park, next to Pink Berry and Total Wine and Spirits.",fnrbFJ3P8bdFK7DMceZ7LQ,2,1,4,mgmuP0Vj6YiH4sLDZ5gNdg

If CORPORATE GETS RID OF THEIR SHRROMS TACOS I WILL NO LONGER BE COMING HERE because of Principal's.....I am a huge restaurant advocate and I hold a very high standard to my opinion, my opinion of Hussongs will greatly dimish if corporate decides to discontinue some of their BEST ITEMS because of ""PREP"" time!!

5753851,2016-11-17,0,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"This place is awesome, Mexican food made vegan, Whaaaa??!?!?! I've only gotten their take out so I can't account for the innards of the restaurant but I can for sure tell you about the taste of their food. 

First their vegan habanero guacamole is the bomb. Not spicy enough for a spice chaser but it's super delicious. I'm always leery of getting guacamole at places since a lot use dairy ingredients in their dip, but with the vegan seal of approval, I'd have to say this is the best vegan guacamole I've had yet! Paired with their crispy warm and salty tortilla chips...heaven! 

My favorite item is the vegan chimichanga with the faux chicken strips. It's so crispy and cheesy, and yummy. They really can make the food taste flavorful without using the typical ingredients. 

I 100% recommend Hussong's, try it out, you'll love it!",mimhrsIi8XBWrkJZMMb3TQ,1,0,5,46xI7WAmumn2HWZRkNtY4w

We walked in and it was not busy, but I think it should have been! We were greeted and sat quickly and kindly.  Our server welcomes us and asked if we have been in before. We had not.  He welcomes us and explained some menu items and brought over an appetizer for us. 
He recommended an amazing margarita for me to try that was not on the menu. It was delicious! 
My fiance had a burrito and I had enchiladas. My favorite part was that I got to choose the sauce and they even let me to 50/50 so I could try what I wanted.  
Both of our meals arrived quickly, hot, fresh, and were delicious! 
The appetizer we had was a bean queso dip and it was delicious as well! We were stuffed and satisfied! 
The manager came over after to check on us and make sure we were satisfied, gave us his business card and encouraged us to come back and call him if we needed a table to watch a certain sports game. 
The food and customer service will bring us back again! I highly recommend giving this place a shot and ignoring the current star review.  I can tell they are trying to turn it around and they are succeeding!",Hmo9AY2JdZejG5LkLRLU8g,1,0,5,F3n3eOqGt6GPAKHNmCYY4g
5774149,2015-07-28,5,N5CL5HLS6lyltw-OjjBrOw,"It opened on Monday and I visited on Friday July 24th around 7:30pm.

I came in the back door and sat down at the bar. I used to frequent this place when it was Embers so the changes in the place were interesting to see, with the removal of the wall separating the bar and dining tables, as well as lighter wood stains and red upholstery on the chairs. Lots of random pictures and posters adorn the walls. The bar has two hanging bottle displays with different tequilas in them. I really liked the interior as it seemed lighter and fresher.

Bartender Justin spotted me and came over to take my order. He recommended an ""original"" margarita so I went with it ($10.95). He gave me some good recommendations on tacos as well since I don't like spicy food. Tacos are 2 for $9.95. I missed out on the Happy Hour menu which has discounts for drinks only.

Original Margarita - I'm not a huge margarita fan, I usually enjoy tequila as a shot. This was ok, nothing special in my book. 

Tacos - I went with a chicken taco that comes with fresh pineapple on top, and the pork belly taco (extra $1). Both were plenty big and very well made with lots of meat. The pork belly taco was delicious with a sweet marinade sauce and some crispy pork rinds on top. 

Service was great, Justin kept using my name during conversations, and checking up frequently and keeping my water glass full. The other bartender whose name I don't remember didn't hardly even look my way, nor smile much while she was working the other side of the bar. There was a manager guy there who seemed like he was watching the bartenders work and he also didn't smile much or seem to have much customer connection. 

Overall, I'll probably come back during Happy Hour when drink prices are a little more reasonable. One thing I did notice was the bartenders shirts said ""Serving up fun since 1932"" or some year, yet the place didn't really seem all that fun. It seemed like a business.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,7,4,4,1UVjuvw2jmKW-wAgilHvDg

You can sit inside or enjoy the outside. 
There are several large TV screens for your viewing pleasure so you won't miss the game. 
There's a full bar... and a salsa bar! 

The food and decor make it appealing to want to sit for a while and hang out with your friends, be served, and have a few drinks. That's one option. 

You also have the option to walk to the back, wait in a line, read the big menu on the wall, place your order, pay, then find your own seat somewhere (like at Wahoos or Panera) and they will bring the food to you.

The menu looked cheap even though when you order 5$ guac you don't even get a full avocado and wasn't even that good.. It was so small. I rly like the fire salsa tho. We didn't even have any napkins in our holder. There wasn't enough people on sad or they are just lazy. I gave the two stars for the salsa and one because the girl was nice....

Wasn't expecting them to let us use both yelp check ins since we had two Yelpers at the table. But they did which was nice. We also ordered the churro and ice cream dessert.
