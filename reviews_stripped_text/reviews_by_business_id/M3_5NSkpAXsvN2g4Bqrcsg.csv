212713,2015-01-28,0,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,Joseph was very friendly and made us feel welcome. Definitely made this visit a great dining experience! Will be coming back and recommending this place to friends. I don't usually give reviews unless I have a great time or someone is exceptionally memorable and Joseph most definitely is.,r4sY-L0PSxG5i379gzqCbQ,0,0,5,jNbcBMBs-hAgLqMQK7ASRg

Sorry for the negative but come on. The place looks great though, really like the new style of decor and active menu/sandwich boards.",L61df51Rc3-SfQPG7hvtFg,0,0,3,64wzcdDgzpcPemenIxj0VA

2154904,2015-03-05,1,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,"Please avoid this location at all costs.  The workers here do not pay attention to you EVEN WHEN THEY ARE MAKING YOUR SANDWICH.

It wasn't just me, either - I actually stayed and watched several customers come and go and almost all of them had their orders wrong.  They were telling the lady exactly what they wanted in the order of the sandwich bar and it was STILL screwed up.  This is one customer at a time, too.

If you speak Spanish, maybe you'll get better, more attentive service.  When I was there, one lady came in and spoke with them for 10-15 minutes while making her sandwich as other customers began to line up.

Just keep going.  It's not worth it.  I promise.",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,2,2,1,DJKvJvn4ODl1y4kYFvxHUA
2526444,2018-02-17,1,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,First time going to this location last night 02/16/18. Just wanted to see if they had chocolate chip cookie cause my girlfriend was craving them. So I'm standing at the door waiting to get buzzed in cause the sign says open. Dude inside was mopping so I'm watching him mop and waiting for him to finish which I shouldn't have to do but whatever. So he goes to the back and I thought he was gonna let me in. He dumps the mop bucket and gets more cleaning supplies and comes to the door after I've been standing there for 10-15 mins and then tells me he's closed and turned off the open sign. Next time turn off the open sign before you start cleaning you fucking idiot. Or at least tell me that you're closed while you're mopping instead of having me stand there watching you mop.,Jv-qBvI44JFYOCPVEI2Aig,0,0,1,I0HDxT_QA4lftR6e7pzBXw
2759327,2016-01-16,2,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,"Very disappointed that I had a coupon and subway wouldn't honor it. It's my fault for not asking but they should have mentioned it to us. I paid almost 20.00 for two foot longs, a medium drink with extra cheese in one of the footlong. Do yourself a favor and go to flamingo and jones down the road where they honor coupons.",0qMik3XhkXYENJ60500vtw,2,1,1,t0Z5RTJhpuHaOga3Hb73xw
3152986,2011-09-07,1,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,"Its a standard Subway. Unfortunately some employees speak barely english, which makes ordering or asking questions extremly hard. Now, English is my second language too, but at least I able to communicate pretty good.... One lady tends to be rather rude, and ignores people and/or their questions. She sighs a lot when you ask her if she would please (Yes we always say please and thank you!) put more dressing on the sandwich or whatever.
Literally, she sigh's! 
Maybe i would be too if I had to work at Subway and all those americans come in and order in english but I dont speak nor do I understand english. 

How rude of us to order in english!",VVvPNapOOZi-TwNIM1YnsA,1,0,2,3im1EHDfMiNnAaOwuBPpSw

4184570,2014-10-10,0,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,"Well we all know subway is bomb, but what makes the place is the customer service and this subway has the worst customer service of all subways. Because it is a 24 hour restaurant we had to ring the bell and wait to be buzzed in,we stood outside for about 15 min waiting for the employee to open the door after we were just inside of the store 2 minutes prior. Finally he let us in and seemed like he hated his job and we were an inconvenience, he took his time and didn't even really acknowledge we were there. I hate writing bad reviews but this really was not necessary. Not even one star rating.",Gy6OhazG2CUTOpAcxP-2-Q,0,0,1,8uqz96UXp-r4mFhy-qrKYQ

4735887,2015-04-06,1,M3_5NSkpAXsvN2g4Bqrcsg,"I've been trying to keep myself from writing a review about this particular subway because every time I walk in its terrible, but here I am. Maybe its just me, but this is THE worst Subway ever. Theres always something, once they were out of tomatoes, another time they were out of shredded cheddar cheese (that time the person making my sub went as far as to tell me they've never had cheddar cheese as an option), and, my most regular complaint, they never, NEVER have soup. No matter what time of the day you walk in, no matter if they've had no business that day, they never have soup. Once it was 12:30, lunch time everywhere, but not there, they told me that time that they start making soup later in the day because nobody asks for it during lunch. I don't usually like to complaint like this, but every time I walk into this place theres something that ticks me off.",_kDvNx3EpWaalOuOt4ed0A,0,1,1,uJ9dzulmAKEXaGRRQJu8QQ

Everytime I go in the employees never smile, are rude, talk to you with attitude, and it's a drag just sitting there to eat your sandwich.
It's really close to my house but I will for SURE not be going back to this one.
