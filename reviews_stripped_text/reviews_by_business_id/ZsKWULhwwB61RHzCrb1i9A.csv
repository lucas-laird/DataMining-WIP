The tortilla was warm, but not the same temp as the fillings, which made me realize it wasn't microwaved, but properly warmed. The carnitas was moist, flavorful and tasty.

The Blue Burrito Grille is the best of a bunch of bad options in terminal C. Burrito was made fresh, reasonably warm, and didn't taste terrible. I was a little concerned when the cashier didn't know what cilantro was, but the end result was ok. 

It wasn't cheap though. One burrito, one rice bowl, a snapple and a coke does not = $23 value to me. But from what I've read elsewhere on Yelp, it's far less than we would have paid next door and a lot better. 

So it's only moderately expensive and is fit for human consumption. And for airport food, that equals three stars.",9RQKv5g21QS8rbst1-CivA,0,0,3,617jAZDFlz9PizD2mcjejQ

 I ordered the dry chicken, microwaveable-""Mexican"" rice bowl and it was disgusting. The veggies were mushy and over ""saut√©ed"" almost drowning in oil and the fake, industrial-tasting flour tortillas are so gross. 

To make things worst, I get two Perrier waters and it came to $8 for both! NO THANKS! And when I tried to return them, Ms. Patty who rang me up, gave me so much attitude. I could care less about it, I am not paying $8 for carbonated water. She said ""I have to get the manager *rolls eyes, gives me the ""you little punk look""*, and I said ""i have an hour layover, so I'm not going anywhere""

Horrible experience and I beg you, please just go elsewhere. I ended up getting free water from SBUX, instead of throwing away $8. Hopefully  LAS gets better food and soon.

Tons of food for about $8 - so it's a good deal but just not very good food.
