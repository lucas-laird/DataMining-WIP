I went about a month ago. When I got there I tried to go through the drive through and there was a sign that said ""drive through is closed"". I went inside and and waited in line for 20 mins. Finally got to the front of the line to order. The restaurant was full of people waiting for their food. I ordered and waited too. I was there for about two hours total. Listening to the girl behind me order and ask for 5 breast and the girl told her they only have 3 breast right now. By the time she got her food they could have cooked more than enough for the whole restaurant.  The gorl at the counter said every order is to go because it's easier for them to remember. Sounds like lazy to me! Where is the OWNER? Your restaurant is going down hill. 

I went in there todayto order and the same things.  There was a sign on the drive through that said KFC drive through only. I parked and started walking in. A young lady and young man were leaving. They had been waiting an hour. My mother in law was already in line. The lady left behind us. So I asked the lady waiting on her food how long have you been waiting she said she timed ot and it had been 45 mins. The girl is packing her order and I asked why we can't go through the drive through as LJ customers? She said she is not sure. I asked who came up with that them or corporate? She said I think the manager. I told my mother in law lets go.

That restaurant SUCKS!!",6UPgkCNPK-OKRDKo6xtdAQ,2,0,1,R3lAlxSCkVqbRWdom1Trpg
1052578,2016-06-05,1,tcnGHnLRyDmKviWLNFfGcA,"Wow!!!  After not having eaten at a Long John Silvers for a long time, we decided to go. We went inside and had planned on eating there. 

When we went in there were only two people inside. They appeared to be finishing up their meal.  We walked to the counter and stood there for several minutes. We could see one employee appearing to be working the drive-up window. Finally someone came to the counter.  There were actually three people behind the counter. But only one appeared to be doing anything. 

We both placed orders for fish meals (L4 and two small drinks). The total came to $22.66. I paid with a credit card, somewhat surprised at how much a fast food bill for two basic meals had come to. 

Anyway, the bill was paid and we waited for the food to be prepared and served.  On a side note, after I had paid, another couple came in and the lady ordered a fish sandwich. She was told it was $10.58. She asked the clerk how much again and was told the same thing. The lady's response indicated she was not happy and was actually surprised with what a LJS fish sandwich was going for. It seemed pretty high to me as well.  Apparently LJS is trying to get ahead of that $15 an hour disaster before it actually takes effect (will never happen though because a fast food, inexperienced, unskilled, employee is not worth this type of wage, especially here at this LJS).  The lady opted for a lesser priced item. I don't blame her. 

After about five minutes, our tray of food was placed on the counter. We had already discussed getting the tartar sauce and vinegar for the fish. We looked through the restaurant for the dispensers and could not find any, so I asked the counter-person for the items. To my astonishment, she told me they didn't have any tartar sauce!!!  Are you kidding me?!!!   No tartar sauce at a fish restaurant??!!!  I could not believe it. 

At that point I told the clerk, if they didn't have tartar sauce, I would just prefer to get my money back. She started yelling something in Spanish to another person walking around the back of the restaurant.    I was actually hoping they would find the tartar sauce and I would eat the food that was still on the counter. No such luck. The clerk finally came from the drive-up window area and handed me $20.51. What a waste of food. 

Wait a second,  I paid $22.66. Was the difference a fine for not accepting my meal and going on my way?  Not going to happen. I told the clerk how much I paid and she went back and got the rest.  I got the refund back in cash and soon left the restaurant. 

So, LJS, is this what you have come to?  Based on the numerous other bad Yelp reviews it would appear there are some serious issues with this location. It could be those stellar (not) employees you have filled this restaurant with (according to other reviews), or it could be they know they may be about to lose that job they so think $15 an hour will solve all of their problems with. It's time to get real LJS. You are drowning in the sea of restaurants that dot every corner of this neighborhood. 

I will not be back.",tro7QPz1REVlVCB4W1Ehxw,13,1,1,VNApV8S5jnfrYe6WblN_ZQ

Also they sometimes run out of hush puppies and will automatically substitute for potato wedges (from KFC obviously). 

The dining room is also always pretty dirty and gross, and they always forget to include forks and napkins with your order so you have to get up and go ask them for it.

Don't come here very often but we do sometimes get random cravings for LJS chicken planks and this is the only known location to me since all the others seemingly closed down years ago.

4023806,2015-12-20,1,tcnGHnLRyDmKviWLNFfGcA,"A friend and I decided to visit this restaurant as we had not had Long John Silver's food for a very long time. We decided to go inside rather than go through the drive thru. There was one customer ahead of us and we quickly perused the menu and decided what we wanted to order. There were no employees at any of the registers and after a couple of minutes we asked the customer in front of us if he had been waited on as of yet. He told us that he had been standing there at least five minutes without anyone so much as even acknowledging him. We could see four or five employees in the kitchen and drive up window area, but no one seemed to be paying any attention to what was happening front of house. After probably six to seven minutes, a male employee finally made his way to the register and took the order from the man in front of us. As soon as the customer had paid, the employee immediately walked away and did not return for another one to two minutes. He didn't even ask if he could take our order, he just sort of stood there pulling up his sagging pants. My friend and I both placed our order and never once did the employee make eye contact or thank us, or apologize, or generally engage in any way. But, at least we had placed our order and I proceeded to get some napkins and fill up my to go cup with sweet tea. I realized at that point that I could see back into the preparation area of the kitchen and for the next half hour, I was astonished, perplexed and concerned over what I saw. First, there was not any fish even prepped to make. I watched a woman employee have to make the batter for our fish order and watched her dip our order of fish without wearing gloves. Several times, the male employee that had finally taken our order, would leave the cash register and go assist with preparing the food. After handling cash and repeatedly using his bare hands to rub his nose, scratch under his hat and pull those sagging pants up that were so low, we were seeing much more skin than we should have, after doing all this, he would walk to the prep area and start touching food items and food containers. I have never seen anything like this in my life and I can honestly say that this was the worst fast food experience that I've ever had. Needless to say, I will never return to this establishment and would happily suggest to anyone, that picking food out of the dumpster in the back would probably have been much quicker and much more sanitary.

#3 you have to go in side to get LJS even then if its past 8pm you may be told that they are no longer serving that for the night, ( you paid for the franchise you should take every advantage to grow that business for your self and the chain.

I unwrapped it and marveled at how big it was.  It was strange that it had a dark brown color.  When I bit in, grease oozed out of the heavily breaded slab of pressed fish.  What just happened?  This couldn't be true.  $6 for pressed fish?  Soaking in grease?  Dark Brown?  I went inside to get my money back.  Even the manager on duty was apologetic.  She was fully aware that there was a problem with their new product. I called the owner who told me he didn't eat fish, that it was corporate that rolled out the new products.  It's really sad to see a once legend in the fast food seafood industry go down like this.  I'll never never never go back! So sad!",YTAdGiv5kCvytpSEQ8JflQ,1,0,1,9PvrGPzzGnTwmqR9ryzwrQ

I also discovered after arriving at my house with my meal that I didn't get my fries. How hard is it to make food that has specific directions, and these are the same kind of people that want $15/hr.",OK8Kn04VMJFL1jTQ_KjGhg,1,0,1,2RfgUq95jZeSXq3F2c7Oqg
