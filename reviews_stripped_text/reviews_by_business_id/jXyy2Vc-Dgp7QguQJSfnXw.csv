Passable kabobs, excessively mild chili chicken, large portions of rice, uninspiring salad. Not too far from a place that sells much better kabob and salad combos, I'll probably pass on coming back.

Not being familiar with their menu it took awhile to work through the descriptions. The food was good overall. They offered 'hotness' from 4-10 depending on your preference for the chicken curry. We asked for 4. We are used to spicy food and didn't think it would be too hot for our taste. When we tasted the dishes it appeared they offered the choice but it came the way it was prepared - too hot, too spicy, more like an 8+. I asked for chutney which they did not offer, nor did they offer yoghurt to cool it down. I got a chili sauce which did nothing to reduce the heat.
Honestly, the prices are a bit high. $12 for spinach is not in line w/what it is. We might try a lunch special another time but wasn't too pleased with this experience & most likely another 'one & done'!",iDfQikdiXnhu03VBFM4rqg,0,0,2,2cAw3U01tMuYzrNo9ksxuQ

515738,2017-10-11,0,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"Nice small Mediterranean/Indian restaurant. Decor is cute. Out server was really nice. We ordered the appetizer plate which was baba ganoush/hummus and tzatziki sauce. It came with the most amazingly falafel. The pita bread was warm and yummy. They basically make you buy more pita bread though bc it barely comes with any to begin with. For 1.50 more you get a serving double the size of what it comes with. Not a bad price, but the appetizer was already $11. Regardless, we ordered Mediterranean salads with chicken added. By far one of the best I had. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, and was cooked to perfection.  The dressing was a mix of tzatziki and jalapeño, which was spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy (I can handle spice). Overall the food was outstanding.

We took a look at the lunch buffet. We came near the end so everything had been out for awhile and it looked that way. No hummus, pita bread or much of a selection of veggies. We skipped on that but possibly would have tried had we come earlier. There was still a nice selection on different dishes to try nonetheless.

Since the reviews seemed promising I was very eager to try it. This is my first yelp review and it due to the food at Lazeez, it deserves to be my first post. 

$40 for bland microwaved food. The food was so hot it was not edible for a good while. The chicken tikka had no spice, but was loaded with cream and tomato sauce. I honestly thought I was eating a vodka sauce. I very well could have been eating a microwaved vodka sauce. 

If I wasn't so hungry, I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, even though I still threw away 3 plates of food(which I feel terrible about).Waste is waste, but save your money.

For me - I am crazy about Aloo Matter.  Lazees has a very unique recipe that is nothing like any Aloo Matter I have ever had.  Even in Delhi where I work on occasion, it is not this good.  Seriously.  The Naan is addictive - beware.  Once you taste it, you are ruined for life, it is that good.  Other Naan will simply not live up to it.  Even though I do not eat much meat, I like the Chicken Tikka Masala (honestly, I only eat the sauce over rice and give the chicken to my daughter).  I would say it is a standard recipe - quite good, but I think its similar at other restaurants (still - that is a good thing).

The only complaint I have is the falafel was simply not good.  It was dry and lacked taste.  Could be they baked it?  I don't know but I have become accustomed to the falafel from the Halal carts in NYC (another addiction of mine) and Lazeez falafel simple does not measure up.

Otherwise, definitely add this restaurant to your must try list.",SI1TzNdfUJPoiDlePcpCJw,0,0,5,1-PxXzx_YTtVtxzYyDA7vQ
943825,2017-05-09,1,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"My boyfriend and I visited this location over the weekend. The inside was quite nice, the decor was minimalistic & tasteful. I ordered a chicken gyro & my bf ordered the tandoori chicken. The food was very good, but the service was less than exceptional. We were not offered drinks upon arrival, our waiter just came over and asked us if we were ready to order. He took our order on a tablet, which apparently was an instantaneous system because he seemed very annoyed when I made a change to it. He came back after rushing off to cancel the previous mistake to finish taking the rest of our order. I asked for garlic naan, and he scoffed at the request, I'm assuming because we hadn't ordered a curry dish or anything like that which usually accompanies the naan. Anyway, he told US to remind HIM about the naan when he came back with our food... my boyfriend and I were kind of confused, it was as if he was making it a point that he would forget it? So he brings out the food and leaves.. Moments go by and we realize our naan wasn't coming out anytime soon so we ask another waitress about it. She is very nice and goes to get it right away. Our waiter comes out seemingly irritated and says ""I told you guys to remind me... I have 2-3 other tables..."" and some other stuff I couldn't understand. Literally we were the only people in there besides another couple that had walked in not too long ago. I was in complete awe. Also, the ice in our water was almost completely melted when we got them.. Needless to say we probably won't be coming back. It's a shame because the food was very good and it was a nice location..

I am devoted halal eating individual, so is my family. So for us finding the right place to have the quaint essential american burger but in a halal form was a challenge since we moved to Vegas. But I have to say that Lazeez's special Lazeez beef burger hit the spot for us. It has all the components of a delicious burger; juicy, moist, meaty and fresh. It also have hints of spices that gives it a eastern flair which is amazing. Their portion size is also very reasonable. The burgers come with steak fries and overall it was very filling. However the price is a little on the expensive side but that is understandable since they are offering halal meat and chicken. We still have not tried their other dishes, but we definitely would be going back for some more.

It's decor is also something I have to write about. It has such an unique up scale diner like feel with Mediterranean touches like light fixtures and etc. It is always clean and the red and white color scheme adds a nice brightness to the restaurant which I think adds to the dining experience. So Overall Lazeez was a great experience.

I  made a yelp account to just write how great this place is and for me it being halal is the most amazing aspect. Thank you from all the halal food seeking individuals out there, you fulfilled our craving. :) keep up the good work and just a suggestion if you could possibly bring more Americans but halal dishes to the menu then it would be great ;)",U8wee08uxhHnUR0nmCt8_A,1,0,5,uLVmSsTUdFCqG_4OBKt9aQ

We came with a group of 6 people. We came pretty late at night, around 830PM. We typically do not do this to restaurants but we were so hungry!!

The staff was very friendly; she greeted us and seated us immediately; waters came out within my 1-2minute mark. She was very charismatic and personable. We glanced at the menu and it was definitely a great selection. 

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated; it was very clean and bright. The restrooms were also well taken care of. 

We ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken tindoori, rice biryani and nihari. The food came out fairly fast. I was worried that the food would not be as good due it being almost closing time. However, to my surprise everything was delicious.  We ordered 4 things that was enough to share among our group. 

The flavors were both aromatic and addicting. Portions were perfect for our group as well. The tikka masala was creamy and had a flavorful punch. Chicken tandoori we all basically fought for. 

My friends were mainly all from out of town. One is enjoys indian food and is familiar with the spices of the cuisine. He mentioned that this has to be one of the best indian food places he has been to. 

We exchanged friendly conversation with the lady at the end and paid our bill. She didn't rush it at all despite closing time.

The other person that was their asked about his order as well and she said that we ordered the same thing and it takes a little longer as it is made to order - so I decided to order a chi tea and wait it out. 40 minutes and finally got my order.

1701333,2015-01-18,1,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"Surprisingly upscale interior and a relatively traditional menu- apps, wraps, plates, and even Halal desserts round out the menu here, featuring currys and other Indian specialties on weekends. They also have several vegetarian and vegan options.

Interior is very nice- in fact, that walk-up counter is kind of odd (and there are two of them?). Not sure why that layout was chosen over offering table service. Pricing is fair on most items, but some need to come down: $8-10 for a wrap without a side is a little steep considering the fast-casual setup they chose to implement. But they have adjusted their pricing on some items, like doubling the (originally) 2-piece falafel app to 4 pieces for the same $5 price tag. But for $10/wrap, there should be a side.

Falafel is good here- but falafel wrap is dry, highly suggest adding hummus or babaghanouj for moisture and added flavor. Unfortunately the drizzle of tzatziki sauce doesn't quite cut it. 
Veggie samosa was tasty- sided with the red Lazeez's sauce is a surprisingly balanced combo, the fruit-based sauce balances out the heat of the filling. But I don't understand why 1 smallish veggie samosa is $2.50 while an order of 4 chicken samosas is $5.

Tip to management: even if you don't offer table service, do away with the red plastic baskets for serving your meals, they're cheap-looking. Invest in real dishes and silverware. And remove the ""Bus your own tables!"" note above the trash, it's tacky.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,7,3,3,urQSH-XMt55CLi2jFkRzYA

They will bring you a huge serving of plain or garlic naan which was delicious! I started with just a spoonful of each item to try it & that pretty much filled me up.

This is a simple Mediterranean and Indian restaurant that provides a good variety of menu options at a reasonable price.

Pros:
- I like the simple yet stylish decor of the interior
-The owner and staff are very friendly
- The food has good flavor and I love their vegan and vegetarian options
- They have a nice private room for hosting parties and entertaining guests

Cons:
- They use styrofoam and plastic utensils for their food. I know this is cheaper for them (and maybe for customers), but I would like ceramic bowls and silverwear to be used from an environmental impact and home feel standpoint.

Final Verdict:
Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice environment and good Indian and Mediterranean food. I've been here countless times for the classes that I teach and recommend them if you are on the fence.",s1DTIKX-ZXcQOMDlcOI6Tg,0,0,4,w8BFA0e0Sv38V0dMxaO9fQ

Food is pretty good but the portions are getting smaller since I started eating here, and if you can't even place a timely order (I often order/pick up on my way into work, which is near Lazeez), then what's the point?

Update: Service has gotten better since writing the original review",q5kFHEgorksUC2NShxblpA,2,0,3,8r6cSuAw27IbvlqGUGxlFg

Their menu is huge and it took me forever to decide because everything sounded so good lol. I ended up getting the chicken biryani. It was so damn good!! It has so many Mediterranean flavors and has such a strong aroma because of it. It might be too spicy for some, but I really enjoyed the spice level on it. It also comes with a yogurt sauce for that reason but I cannot have dairy. It was still a delicious dish without it. It was a bit pricy but definitely worth it. The portions are a good size and the food is authentic. I can't wait to try out more dishes from here!",6BLLyZDiR0pb-h2E5qvLXw,2,2,4,R1k7qyzhD4JTEqSm-eD_Jg

My daughter had her vegan plate... a rice dish with veggies and a chick pea dish which was also delicious... I had to take a bite. My grand daughter had chicken fingers and fries... yes they have a children's section on the menu.

2183598,2017-01-11,0,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,Have eaten here several times and usually the food and service is great. The other night i stopped in with my husband and a friend.  I ordered a goat curry dish which was rather pricey but was hopeful it would be just as great as everything else.  I got my dish and noticed small bone fragments.  I kept pulling the sharp pieces from my curry and asked the waiter if this is how it should be.  He was unsure because it was his first day. Another member of the waitstaff checked with the chef and confirmed it should have bones in it. I asked for a replacement because there were just way too many for my comfort/saftey and showed the many many pieces to the waitress. As if someone took a hammer and whacked the bone.  The experienced waitress told me that they would not replace my dish because I already touched it with my fingers.  She said I was the first person to complain and that is how all their curries come. I have eaten curry there and many other places and never experienced this once. When asked she couldn't even tell me how i was supposed to eat this dish safely.  She returned from the kitchen and advised that they would replace the dish this time. I have never been made to feel as if I was the absurd person until last night.  My meal replaced with a chicken curry and surprise NO BONES . I say surprise because they had just finished telling me that ALL their curries have bones. I was charged for the goat curry that i did not get to eat even though my replacement was 2.00 cheaper. I was done arguing and just wanted to hurry out of there.  I paid the tab with tip turning it into a bill over 82.00 because the new waiter didnt deserve to be jipped. This experience will keep me from frequenting the establishment.,zBOPcyowuJjgP3ewvoUg4A,2,0,1,-u6uIepWLnCiM9Z0KFEjug

2302922,2014-11-27,2,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"I first walked in and was surprised that this is a self-serve place. I guess I just assumed an Indian Food place would include service. It makes more sense when you get to the menu/ordering area and see half of the menu is comprised of different kinds of burgers. I didn't discount them just for the fusion menu,  but it was my first point of concern. I was looking for some Korma specifically and they don't have that. So, as the pictures I'm gonna upload will show, I got the lamb Shawarma,  chicken samosa,  a mango lassi. My boyfriend got chicken boti, a drink and fries. 

Our bill came out to $37 for me and my boyfriend which I think is ridiculous for a self-serve indian/American fusion diner (basically). They call your number and you go to pick up your food.  After you eat you throw away your trash and put your plates away. I don't mind going to self-serve places but the amount you pay for Indian food I think it's silly not to serve us. Especially because the place isn't busy! Why are there signs everywhere trying to get customers to serve themselves and clean up after themselves when it takes 30 seconds for an empty restaurant staff member to walk it over. I'll say right here if this restaurant doesn't succeed it's at least 50% because of their idea to make it self-serve. 

I was happy with my lamb Shawarma. The
 samosa was really spicy,  would not recommend. The lasse did not have the bubbly texture I'm used to. My boyfriend was pretty upset with his boti - only because for 11 dollars at a place you serve yourself he thought the portions were too small. He had like five chunks of chicken and bunch of rice and lettuce. They call it a salad but it really is just lettuce. 

However, the lamb was good and I may be back for a lamb gyro if I'm in the mood one day. The food isn't bad just some execution issues I think.

I received a discount coupon for doing surveys online and found this place which was right down the street from where we lived and so my husband and I decided to go out for new restaurant experience. I ordered the chicken curry and my husband got the famous chicken masala dish. The chicken curry was superb with turmeric and other Indian spices. I had it at a level five spicy which you can choose between 1-10 on the spice level. It was perfect! The chicken masala was creamy and remanescent to buttered chicken and was so good. I really love this place. They even have a rewards program which is worth getting. We will definitely visit again and bring friends!!!,HTTn15w4c5Yfp4YzrZqd3g,2,2,5,bU_sIHxpwslbQas15C5IJw

Meant to get kabobs as I promised myself last time, but wasn't feeling it today.  Instead lamb shawarma wrap fantabu-marvelistically deliciousrama excellent!!!  Firmly recommended.  Of course its spicyy ttsssss...
Falafels are okay a tad on the dry side; ordered with tzatziki sauce which helped.  Except the tzatziki was watered down in appearance and texture.  
Baba ganoush with pita is great.  I put some BG in my shawarma to make an unforgettable yep!  Ma il mio bel ama il cibo cinese.  Next time my sweetheart.
When in doubt, always get baklava.  Only sweet tooths understand this dilemma.  There is no counseling for being a sweet tooth except for silent therapy with sweets.

A lost star in rating though since I weigh on customer service.  At the time of using the Yelp Eat 24 method I had even tipped in advance.  When I picked up my food, I stood waiting cuz I thought I had to sign the receipt.  But only after I asked I learned it's prepaid. I can just take my bag and go.  Users of Yelp Eat 24 get an itemized email which serves as the receipt.  I trusted my order was prepared correctly and I'd forgotten to check the bag before I left.  I get home gladly to see order is correct and still hot.  But no napkins...

As soon as we walked in around 1 pm, there was literally no one in the restaurant. We were hesitant on whether we should stay or go. I gave them a quick search on yelp, saw their 4 star rating, and decided to give them a shot. Their food looked pretty good from the pictures as well so why not. 

We each ordered the chicken curry lunch special (spicy level 6 for my dad and spicy level 8 for me on a scale of 4-10) and split a chicken tandoori and garlic naan. The chicken curry was super flavorful, and the chicken was really juicy and tender. The chicken tandoori was also a hit, and the garlic naan was soft and fluffy. The curry could have been spicier so I'll go with level 10 next time. The lunch specials also include rice and your choice of soda.

The only complaint I have is that the pre-set silverware was dirty (had some kind of food smear on them). I tried to replace them with the ones on the tables next to us, but they were also dirty. I hope they do a better job of washing and polishing their silverware. 

Oh and for real though, I straight up had some of the worst gas for a good 4 hours after this meal. I don't know what they put in that curry, but it's some potent stuff. 

All in all, it was a pleasant experience, and the food was a lot better than I expected. I'll definitely be back for that chicken curry and to try other items on their menu.",NCRGj36ihdwX-VUCYEX41g,8,7,4,7RFa2nsm7ryiHU3Rko68DQ

~Chicken Chilli, Chicken Curry, Chicken Tandoori.

Chilli Chicken was flavorful and the chicken cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The Paneer tikka Masala were better than most restaurants. I loved the Samosas and the Garlic naan, the naan were crispy, fresh and thin.

I have to say that most people would love the level of spice in these dishes.  I do prefer my food on the hot side, and I could stand for more spiciness.

3970174,2015-05-25,5,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"I watched as this restaurant opened after the previous restaurant closed and when I found out it was an Indian/Mediterranean one, I was anxious to give it a try.  I stopped in for a late dinner a few nights ago.

The meal was good.  I was surprised when I saw an Indian restaurant serving a beef curry stew but I realized the Northern Indian cuisine and the Middle Eastern might be the reason for this.  I ordered the Nihari which the menu describes as a ... ""traditional spicy beef curry, another royalty from India.""  With it, I got an order of garlic naan and some iced tea. On a spiciness level of 1 to 10, I ordered 8.

After ordering, you take a seat and put one of the posts holding your number so they know which table to deliver the food.  While waiting, I got my iced tea from a separate room where the fountain drinks and iced tea were kept.

The wait was no that long and it gave me a chance to get some photos of the interior.  When the dinner came, it was on a school-like lunch tray.  The nihari was in an aluminum foil 'bowl' and the naan was on the side.  In addition, the curry came with some thinly sliced ginger and some jalapeño slices.  The utensils were plastic.

The nihari was very tasty and nicely spiced.  I did dump all the ginger and jalapeño into the stew and it certainly cleared my sinuses before I was finished.  The naan didn't have much of a garlic flavor, but it was fresh and hot and made a good soaker for some of the curry.

A couple of things come to mind when reviewing Lazeez.  I really dislike paying normal restaurant prices to eat as if I'm in a school cafeteria.  Plastic utensils, get your own drinks, aluminum foil bowls--these are all the things that detracted from what was some good food.  If I were to return, it would be for takeout.  At least I'd have proper utensils.  

A couple of other things.  I asked what came with the meal and the person at the register said just rice.  There was never any rice.  The online menu shows the dish with naan.  I was charged for naan.  Maybe that was an additional charge because of the garlic naan.  

The restaurant is strange.  When you walk in, you have a choice of two ways to go--one through the beverage area which looks like it may be bar seating in the future or you can go to your left and past some tables to get into the place.  Walking straight ahead will take you into a divider which is an odd setup.  There are two distinct eating areas and they're completely different.  I can't figure out who designed the interior but I might have been able to do better.  I'm not sure how much the previous place figures in its current design but it is odd.

Altogether it was good food which was detracted by the way it's served especially that damned, little plastic spoon.  Oh, and spend a little extra and get some decent napkins instead of giving a customer 5 of thin small diner ones.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,6,3,7Sj4D4LZ20YENsOPr1wMDQ

So ventured in at lunch time to be the only customer, followed any a few more tables. It was quiet.

I was greeted by a young lad, warm welcome must say. Was offered the menu right away and guided towards the veggie section, as I asked for it. 

Interesting menu, a mix of Middle-eastern and Sub-continent cuisine. Looking at the menu, I most certainly was confused, I could not figure out what kind of cuisine I should have - Middle-Eastern - Indian - Pakistani - North African

I finally made my choice of Samosa and Chan Chat - I as they seemed to be safe bets 

The Samosa is no way close to an Indian samosa, its good but I expected an Indian Samosa, The chana chat, was something weird. I have never tasted this kinda of chana flavor or presentation. Maybe a middle-eastern style. I am not a expert of that cuisine, so will not comment.

Overall its a interesting place, will surely try it again only with middle-eastern cuisines expert/s to truly understand what they are offering here.",7q1EFKcjUTQhUrmjY2ZRkw,1,0,3,9reYNr81WqP29gtkfqd7AQ

Gulab jamun: the syrup was too sweet and watery. The texture is off, I didn't like it.

Looking at the menu, it was definitely a little bit all over the place--there were Indian dishes, Greek dishes, salads, burgers... It was a little overwhelming. I do commend them for having vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. I always think it's important for restaurants to acknowledge these, because there are so many people with allergies and/or dietary restrictions.

Let's get right to the food--I wanted to try their veggie burger, because it was described as a popular Indian street food. This menu item was good! And it was probably my favorite out of everything I had ordered. It was at a good price, and a perfect handheld ""on-the-go"" type of food.

Another dish I tried was their paneer tikka masala, which is my favorite Indian dish, and one that I have ordered at numerous restaurants. Unfortunately, I found theirs to taste very different from the ones I've had and did not enjoy it very much. The samosas were decent! I liked the texture.

4664115,2014-12-15,0,jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw,"I think this place has a bit of an identity crisis. It's either a fast casual restaurant or its a sit down restaurant. Unfortunately they are charging sit down prices for a fast casual, serve yourself environment. 

The food was decent, but two kabobs dinners and a drink, which you have to get yourself was almost $28.  Wait, now that I think about it, one of the orders was a combo and we never got the onion rings (only choice because they ran out of fries).

For my liking, the music was a bit too loud. I also found the menu to be a little on the big side and pictures, as someone else mentioned would be a huge help.  A mediterranean/Indian place that serves great burgers could probably work, but you may want to advertise them a little more. Maybe a burger with these flavors and toppings could work to. 

Another suggestion, I saw that the owner felt  it necessary to respond. When you do respond in such a way, it comes off as negative and makes you and your restaurant look bad. There is nothing wrong about being passionate, but I would respond a little differently. Something like ""I am sorry your experience with us did not meet your expectations. We will take your feedback as we continually strive to make our restaurant a better dining experience.""

I'm a fan of small business and I hope this one succeeds, but there are quite a few places in town to get good kabobs and Indian food.  I think once this place figures out exactly who they are, they can succeed.",XPNiTbrKL7f0_6L0lrbZlg,7,1,3,i_Ebie7v_Vqn2qtXWcEXjw

I came here with my family for a late lunch. We were the only customers here. One young lady was serving us and did a decent job. She made sure she greeted us, promptly sat us down and took our drink order. She needed a reminder to refill our empty drinks but hey that happens. 

Anyways back to the food; it was like anticipating a Coca Cola but getting a flat store brand soda. That's the best analogy at the moment. You can't offer Indian and Mediterranean food and have it lack flavor. Of course I order the chicken tikka masala and it was almost like I could've made it better. Mind you, I hardly cook. I am willing to give it another shot dothe road since I do know they recently opened and I know this specific spot had had multiple unsuccessful restaurant. This restaurant could have a lot of potential. They could start by add serving their chicken bryani and chicken tikka masala with a serving spoon. It was a family size portion. We had to use the same forks and spoons from our meal. Also, I order a Tzatziki on the side because the waitress informed me it didn't come with the sampler. Of course it did though, as stated on the menu. So we had two but I mean the more Tzatziki the better but that's not the point. Regardless we paid $110 for our late lunch.

Then the food is delivered to your table in disposable containers. When you're done, you throw away your trash and out your tray away. Easy peezy. 

We ordered a chicken tikka masala (of course.. our main go-to for Indian). But instead if ordering one each, we shared it and also ordered a Paneer chili and garlic naan. The paneer chili was good, with onions and peppers, but I'm sorry, the tikka masala just can't be beat. Esp with the garlic naan to compliment it! 

The prices are more than fair. Only downfall is their service is a bit slow. I remember thinking we waited a long time for our food. Which I don't mind if I'm not in a hurry. Since that first time, we have also ordered it again about 3 days later for take out. And now that I've talked about it, I kind if feel like it again.. Maybe for tonight!

Go try it for yourself. I loved it..",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,3,0,5,iLqQCe7sTOtC77Jo64aO8Q

This place certainly didn't disappoint when it came to that. In fact it's probably the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Having said that, be cautious when asking for a spicy dish. You will get a whoopin. Our server Natalie was also amazing to top it off. I'll definitely be back here again soon.",Z3UUg88bC1-QGzjZzgRLdg,0,0,5,C9hXoJUgwuZiLwgQPZW7OQ

Ok so I had an unpublished draft that I need to finish. 

This restaurant is my favorite for a quick go to Indian bite and if my kid isn't down for Indian they have some goodies for her too. 

So options are great here but the flavors and the foods they give are delish. The staff I love them. I love talking to this one waiter about Bollywood films and actors.  

That being said the atmosphere, the pricing it's all great for me. They were closed tonight so I went else where to Mint Indian and I was so disappointed after being used to the flavors of this place. 

Great food.  Great staff. Great selection. I wish more people ate here because after reading reviews of other places I'm a bit baffled.  Even my Indian friends don't understand why Lazeez
Doesn't have more of a following ... you gotta try this place. I do recommend it.

I walked in with zero expectations, what can one expect from an Indian place tucked away in a quiet Las Vegas suburb? Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. This is not your quintessential Indian restaurant, it serves Indian/Mediterranean food, so you expect some kind of fusion food. I was suffering from an upset tummy that day and so decided to play it safe and ordered the dal soup with some rice. The dal and rice combination was so uplifting that I started feeling better almost instantly. I started trying other dishes that our group ordered including the chicken biryani. It is not an authentic biryani from any angle but tasted amazing. We also tried the sheekh kebab, boti kebab and palak chicken. Every dish was great and looked as if it was crafted with great care. The service was slow though the restaurant was empty.",IWkmLWxk8lVUYfMDHKowdw,0,0,4,VO4intXrRNueDLmrc-UJUw

If you plan on dining I recommend the chicken panini sandwich. Besides the food, they have the most enjoyable atmosphere yet. It was very zen.

We were in the area and craving Indian food (as is the case with me like 90% of the time) and decided to check this place out. HOLY CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA BATMAN! It was SO good! We ordered the saag chicken and the Bihari kabob roll. Both were excellent. The best part was the saag chicken came with parantha. You need to understand that growing up, getting parantha was a big deal. It was usually only on Sunday morning and mom fed you parantha and then you didn't eat again until dinner. Yes, it's heavy, but it's heavenly too. The ones we got were yummy and flaky and brought back so much nostalgia for me. The serving portions were huge and we had plenty to take home. It was just as yummy the next day reheated. Lazeez (the Indian food part of it) is definitely authentic and maybe not the best for new palates to Indian food. This is definitely for people who LOVE them some Indian food. The dishes are not generic ""Indian restaurant"" food and not for the faint of heart. The weekend lunch buffet is back as well. It's until 3PM on the weekends. I will 100% be frequenting it. If you see me in line, say hi.
