1- This dennys is walking distance from CSN making it convenient to go to.

2- The free wifi it helps when I am hungry and need to do work on the computer to do it right there and the food is moderately priced.

3- the service is amazing. the staff members are always checking up on you to ensure that everthing is to your satisfaction.

4- The food is always so good like the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"" here you pay and you get good quality food.",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,1,0,5,U8uTdtb9cWs2M5v4vqAN0A

I feel like a lot of people in vegas have come to the conclusion that all Denny's in Las Vegas serves awful food. However, my particular experience was quite awakening on how terrible the customer service is. I went in to this Denny's because it's across the street from my college campus, CSN. I went to eat with my mentor whom happens to be completely deaf but she has great oral abilities. The waiter when he approached us realized one of us or both of us was deaf because we were signing. He stared off by screaming ""what can I get you to drink?"" My response was, ""I'm not deaf, but she is. No matter how loud you tell, she can't hear you, but she can read your lips very well and she speaks great. So when you talk to her, you have to face her so she can read your lips."" He then looked at me and asked me what she wanted to order. I politely looked at him and told him to ask her, because I'm not here to interpret a food order. He then raised his voice to ask her what she wanted to drink. She told him, and then took my order and left. When he came back to take our food orders, he continued to look at me while speaking about her as if she wasn't there. I reiterated that he needs to look at her when speaking to her, and he can take her order from her. He then started talking down to her like she was a pet. I was completely dumbfounded at the amount of disrespect shown towards my mentor. She is deaf, not stupid. I reiterated the proper way to speak to a deaf person and was blatantly ignored. This particular area has shown us nothing but respect when we go out to eat, so we will eat somewhere else from here on.",jj82AQKXBu9BgBvezkgsdg,0,0,1,Xvqg2ffbuZ-HYGOd7u3Egw

269370,2012-02-26,2,OlWWHMKPSroPqnLd1I5ujg,I wish I could give them zero stars. They are so rude I can not believe they are still in business. We only went there because we were on vacation and not familiar with the area and our Navigation system routed us to this one. I normally go online before picking a place to eat and check the reviews but my family was hungry and we were on vacation. We were sat down by the very nice hostess who got yelled at in front of my family by the soon to be known rude manager. I can't even say how we were talked about by the manager and our server because it would be flagged as inappropriate  and I do not swear because I have manners. Yes you heard it right the server was talking about us to all of her co workers so loud we could hear here and embarrassing as other customers sat there just in shock as we were. Then my family and I were held captured there because I am guessing the manager called the police because I did not want to pay for one of our meals even though it was not eaten because it tasted bad. It is Denny's and we did not expect 5 star treatment but have a little common decency for your customers. I did end up paying for the full bill because I did not want to wait for the police to come to get  one meal taken off and it took forever for the police to come so maybe the police know this restaurant and took their time because of a manager using the police for non emergencies. Oh and we got yelled at by the manager that we must be from LA... Yes she is right we are from LA and I guess we are too demanding to ask to be treated with respect and to pay for food that we can actually eat. Oh the manager told us she was calling the metro all loud in front of everyone... I wanted to tell her the metro is the bus and subway station in LA!! not the police LOL...

612953,2014-06-30,1,OlWWHMKPSroPqnLd1I5ujg,"Just had lunch there with my little brother. My little brother has really long blonde hair, which sometimes gets mistaken for a girl. It's fine. It's a common mistake. 
Anyway, we sat down at our table and everything was fine. The host was wonderful and made us feel welcome. Our waitress comes over and starts calling both of us miss and ladies. I politely informed her that my little brother was infact, not a girl, because I could see it was bothering him. The waitress just stared at me with the blankest look and rudely said, ""okay..."" No sorry. No laughing it off. Nothing! She then took our drink/food and I didn't even want a drink at that point, I just wanted to leave. 
We sat there deciding what to do. My little brother said he was okay an wanted to stay. I wasn't having it. I finally nicely asked the host if he could cancel our order, since my waitress was going to every other table but mine. I could tell the host was concerned and asked us if we just wanted to move to another section and he would personally take care of us. My little brother and I agreed. We went to the section of the waitress we had last time we went there. She was so nice and remembered our exact order! The host kept coming over to check on us and kept making my little brother laugh. I finally told him what the problem was with the first waitress. He was shocked! I'm giving it a 5 star because everything else was wonderful, beside the first waitress. Some people aren't meant to work with customers. She should find a new job.

1566537,2011-11-04,2,OlWWHMKPSroPqnLd1I5ujg,"I go to the College of Southern Nevada just right across the street, so naturally, I had to go try this place out. What attracted me was that because I'm a CSN student, I'm given the chance at a discount when I show my student ID. So, awesome right? Good food and at a good price. At least, so I expected.

I've gone to this Denny's a handful of times with a different set of friends, so I know that something has definitely been going down.

Just earlier today was my last visit. I went with a good friend of mine after getting out of class. The lady in the back simply said, ""Good evening, please take a seat anywhere on the right side."" Of course, while a group of four who were probably students too were sitting in a booth on the far left. Hm, not a big deal, I guess; it wasn't busy after all.

So, we both take a seat. She hands us our menus and asks us first what we want to drink. Ten minutes later, she comes back with glasses and she takes our order, as we politely tell her thank you, and says that she'll ""have it out soon."" So we sit back and talk. And talk. And, talk some more. Note: We had both gotten in at about approximately 6:15 PM. At 6:40, my friend and I begin to wonder what had been taking our food so long, as he loudly sipped on an empty glass of water with no waitress to refill it.

At around 6:50, she comes back and gives us our food. Imagine how cold my Smothered Cheese Fries felt when I ate it, and to my dismay, how ridiculously small the portion was for five dollars. My friend got the Biscuits and Gravy. Keep in mind, these are two very simplistic dishes; not much to add in, so why did it take so long? I wouldn't know how fast the chef cooked it, but oh, we could only guess that this waitress took centuries to get it to our table.

Not to mention, my friend was promised another glass of ice water. As soon as we finish eating, there's been no sight of her walking anywhere near or past us. We practically had to march our way over to the front area just to get the bill because we could only bet that he would've been late to his class if we didn't do it.

The previous time that I came here before tonight, the lady who gave us our check was practically harassing us with some kind of an attempt at a guilt-trip by going, ""I see you didn't leave a tip. Was our service bad?"" Oh man, I bit my tongue. You didn't know how badly I wanted to say it, too.

Another time that I had, we didn't have utensils on our table for forty minutes. Our food had come in ten minutes prior. And, not to mention, I had to stop eating just because my refill didn't come in for what felt like hours.

Still not convinced that this place is run by a nut job? My friend who I went with today overheard the waitress whispering under her breath about how ""crowded"" it was. This location is a very spacious building, but believe me, and I kid you not, there were only four other groups of people in tables aside from my friend and myself. Clearly, this woman has never seen a true lunch rush like I have, and many others.

But anywho, you want to know the moral of this story? Unless you're such a die-hard for Denny's that you don't care when you get it as long as if you get it, then save some time and DON'T go to this location. You'll wait for hours and be treated horribly as a customer, if even as a person at all.

If I didn't enjoy Denny's food so much, I would've seriously given this place a star. Maybe even zero. Never again.",IWQkdTTn9FslPeSiih2l2Q,3,2,2,6ko32a98lDmchZNdRaAn7Q

I don't know if its the mocha drizzled coffee, or the grand slam I ordered. But I had a major case of the number 2 emergency around 20 minutes after consuming the food. This happened not ONCE but TWICE!

The first time it happened, I was like, okay... maybe the kitchen was busy breaking down for closing and perhaps they unknowingly undercooked the food. However, there was almost no one in the restaurant, it was just me and my girlfriend at the time inside, and a another couple that was already finishing their meal. 

But you know what, for the SECOND TIME, both me and my gf had to run into the bathroom at College of Southern Nevada after consuming the food. 

I was humiliated after I was caught up by my friends who was taking their sweet assed time telling their long fucking story to me. Like, my ass is BURNING with anticipation to drop these fiery bombs in the toilet, and these fuckers that I know didn't realize the EMERGENCY I was in!

I had to excuse myself to go to the bathroom, but even the follow-up experience in the stall was painful and miserable. Like, my stomach STUNG like crazy while I was blowing up the bathroom. And it flowed out just like water!

That night, I made 4 more trips to the restroom during my night class.

Seriously, send in the fucking health department! I too, work in a restaurant as a line cook, and regardless of whether or not it is a Fast Casual Dining or a Breakfast Spot, experiences like this is NOT FUCKING ACCEPTABLE.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,2,1,1,b7dlxmyaZ7K1QIsXlVijMQ

This was like no Denny's I've ever gone to before which is usually prompt and the staff lighthearted making your visit enjoyable. But on this occasion I came in around 12 at night for a quick meal figuring it would be a quite and less busy. I was surprised by one large group so I understood the kitchen may be backed up. I ordered a grand slam and coco promptly to get it cooking. I got my coco and expected a little wait but then the longest and most frustrating waiting game began. 20 Minutes went by, no food, no waiter, no acknowledgment of me whatsoever. At this point I pull out my laptop figuring I can get some work done while I wait, 10 more passed. Then the waiter comes to apologize for the wait and it's ""Coming right up."" 20 Minutes after that ( no exaggeration), it's still not here and I begin to pack up and stand just as the kitchen dings their bell for ready food. So I think ""Fine, I've waited this long I'll stay and eat."" Even though my blood sugar is low and my blood pressure is up at this point. And then I can't believe it, the food was for the table that came in 15 minutes after me! Exasperated but calmly I ask him where my food is and he says ""coming right up."" Yeah heard that one before. But he does go and grab it. He apologizes again, I say I'm not even upset at him it's nothing he has control over but an hour is ridiculous. He explains my ticket had gotten lost behind the printer! What are the odds. He said of course they'd do something with my check for the inconvenience after waiting a whole hour for my food! I ravenously ate my food. It was typical for Denny's. Asked for my check, he took his sweet time getting that too like I hadn't waited long enough. I nearly lost my mind when the check was still $8.68, they had only given me a small discount that didn't even cover the cost of the coco. I was infuriated at this point but I'm not the type to raise a voice or make a scene so I head to the payment counter to wait to pay and discuss the awful quality of service which would have saved them from this review and a letter to their corporation. But again I was completely blown off while he waited to his tables. After 5 minutes of standing at the front I just could not do it anymore and left my $9 cash on the counter top.

I feel like for any chain, you already know what to expect, so you just rate them based on the variance of each location. No one is going to see a five star Denny's rating and assume it's in line with Robuchon.

This location suits me just fine for a cup of severely mediocre coffee before school. I get my own booth to spread my books out for a last minute study cram and the waitresses are always efficient and smiling, especially Kelly! The older lady who works up front is incredibly friendly- pinching babies cheeks kind of friendly. She has that old school diner feel.

All of the food ranges from mediocre to fairly gross. I'm pretty sure they don't have any unprocessed cheese in the house. The toast is like.. cardboard. I don't even know. They do have some healthier options clearly marked on the menu and that's what I always go for, even though they're all variations of egg whites, spinach and cherry tomatoes with fresh fruit.

I like to pretend I'm eating healthy when I come here, and maybe elsewhere I actually would be had I ordered the same thing - but here, the spinach always comes saturated in grease. It usually comes barely wilted, and while that's just how I like it.. it makes the grease even more uncalled for.

I wouldn't recommend a Denny's probably ever, but for my last minute school needs, it fits the bill well. The service makes up for the food.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,0,0,3,dTzkUsV417wuQPUw7y9fxQ

The people standing to be seated were greeted and seated leaving my self staring at my yummy food getting cold and the delivery guy wondering if he was going to get yelled at by the next customer for taking too long. About ten minutes later a girl from the back came out got her pizza and finally relieved the delivery guy of waiting and several minutes after that i was finally greeted and given my food. The woman in the front asked me to check the order to make sure it was correct. Well my prime rib skillet i carb consciously chose (seeing that my hubby eats the hash browns) ended up being there fully loaded potato prime rib skillet. Simple mistake that is easily forgiven except i was not short of being called a liar about what i ordered instead of them fixing their mistake And then she told me i should ve ordered that because it is cheaper. My Slam burger was smashed and the egg was broken leaving my burger bun soggy and when i asked them to fix it they told me i should ve ordered the egg differently than sunny side up like in the picture (yet i never had this problem before). After she couldn't convince me that i wanted more carb filled potatoes and a soggy burger they took my food and replaced it with what i had asked for. I apologized for the inconvenience I BROUGHT THEM and told them the other to-go containers were much better and perhaps that was the reason the egg broke....she then told me they never had different containers and she didn't know what i was talking about and after getting my food from the cook apologized that they could no longer afford the other containers offered me her card and a free entree WOW!!!!!Upon be completely insulted and lied to i told her to keep the card because i will not return there again.

I got a banana caramel french toast skillet that came with 2 sunny side eggs and bacon (with an alternative choice of sausage) for about $8.

My waitress was always around and never too far away if I needed her. In all I spent about $10 bucks total and left with a full tummy.",XRSdeFZosqxyykWA1Ii3HA,1,0,4,LJ4pnC6iLmg_Vx7eHDlCIg

Got here and it was busy but not like the other restaurant. Waited thirty minutes and got to a booth that another party left for because there was still trash under the booth. I just thought I waited this long so I'll ask for them to remove it. Fourty minutes for food!!! Then another table which was cleaned by a busser had old food from another party under it. I had to ask for three separate silver wares because they all had food. I told manager and he didn't seem to care and offered me a five dollar off coupon for my next visit!!!!! I told him it wasn't necessary because ill never return. DONT GO HERE!!!!,8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,2,0,1,TTnhoApiQYi3JGeuHCSUPQ

The waiter is fantastic and the atmosphere is roomy and I will definitely be coming back to this location. They even comped me a belated birthday..,xvzstIJ3Crmlpf9GJG4csw,0,0,5,yyWIaaXJzGBcXezhxjkIGw
