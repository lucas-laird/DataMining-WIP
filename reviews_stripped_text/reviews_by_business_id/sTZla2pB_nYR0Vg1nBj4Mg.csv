89527,2014-12-28,0,sTZla2pB_nYR0Vg1nBj4Mg,"I like this place, good food, I think the food should be authentic enough, as I was chatting with the waitress, I think they don't Americanize their food. I like originality, and so far we never had bad food their. The soltani was great, beef and chicken koobideh were tasty, tachin was tasty too. I had my best lentil soup from them as well. The ice cream was also awesome. Service was good too.
I would like to note that the beef koobideh is a bit pungent and spicy because of the seasoning they use. The chicken koobideh is a bit spicy too. So if you can't handle pungent or spicy seasoning at all, you can try tachin or some other dishes. They make good food anyway. They make their own ice cream too by the way.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,30otynwXgji6eNYYj-va7A

I had the Berry Pulav (Indian translation) and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was similar to the dish we have in Mumbai prepared by Iranian restaurants. The live music was great too.

Really nice friendly place to go to.",2zoYzYffhWYzhjjlR5eMhQ,2,0,4,LUPMu-YVDGvM5LBBdkT6wA

348982,2014-08-26,0,sTZla2pB_nYR0Vg1nBj4Mg,"We were in Las Vegas last week and after dining in hotel for several days we decided to try a Persian restaurant. We arrived a bit late around 9.30 pm. We were warmly greeted and taken to our table by our lovely servant. We ordered Boneless Chicken Kebab and Kobideh. The food was great, the gentlemen playing guitar and singing Persian song was awesome. We definitely visit this place when we go to Las Vegas again.",jL_Sjj6rM9WEOeI7g4f9PQ,0,0,5,QARXGPMj9xLftwMNutgxHA

744518,2014-09-05,0,sTZla2pB_nYR0Vg1nBj4Mg,"Moved to Vegas from LA about 3 years ago and I had yet to find a Persian restaurant that does the cuisine justice... it finally happened when I ate at Caspian.  

My friend and I arrived there late afternoon.  We were greeted and seated.  Started with wine (yes, I know that's not the traditional beverage to have, but that's what we wanted).  

Yousef, the owner, who is a very nice gentleman and who is following his passion to serve excellent Persian cuisine, hosted us.

We started with the tahdig (very generous portion) and requested 1/2 ghormeh sabzi and 1/2 gheimeh stews.  Fresh baked sangak bread at the table.  The tahdig and both of the stews were deliciously homemade.  For our main course (to share) we ordered the Soltani (barg and koobideh combo), and the chicken kabob with bone.  After a decent dinner salad the meals were served.

When the meal arrived, specifically the kabobs, I asked (twice) if that is the customary size of their barg portions and Yousef confirmed.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Nowhere in Vegas had I seen this large a portion of barg kabob (1lb prior to cooking).  Both the barg and koobideh were nicely seasoned and cooked properly.  Both tasted great, though I was partial to the barg.  The koobideh could have been slightly softer (and in relation to the barg perhaps a bit wider), but overall quite enjoyable.  The kabobs were served with rice. 

The chicken kabob with bone (a whole bird) was excellent.  Perfectly seasoned and cooked just right.  Truly finger licking good (you can't really eat those with utensils).  

Wrapped it up with tea and baklava.

Left satisfied, happy, and satiated.

This place is new and has great potential.  I've seen too many places that skimp on portions and do not cook or present the food properly.  I hope that Caspian maintains its current standard and does not do anything to detract from what they are offering.

I personally would appreciate if the following changes were made;  1) No open butter served on top of rice (can't do butter), 2) men's bathroom should have dividers between sink and between urinals, 3) if TV is on and the restaurant is not crowded, the volume should be lowered (which to his credit he did) and the channel on screen should not be glitchy (it was a bit distracting), 4) the baklava could've been a bit sweeter and less dry.

Caspian is up and coming and it is operated by an owner who understands and provides proper Persian cuisine, in satisfying portions, and with friendly service.  Not the least expensive place in town and quite frankly it shouldn't be.  This is one of the finer Persian cuisines and you get what you pay for.

Also worth noting is that next door he operates and prepares various homemade items (breads, specialty dishes, etc.) that may not be served in the main hall.  I will have to try their kalepache some time soon.

I will post a photo of the food.  I took the photo just to share with few friends.  Didn't employ much photography skills as I wasn't planning on posting on Yelp... but as they say... it's worth 1000 words.

Overall... very happy... will be back!",1RjSlKG6Yk7LaybN88cCDQ,5,0,4,H6a9AetH1dTz124gxzZwHg
839269,2014-11-10,0,sTZla2pB_nYR0Vg1nBj4Mg,"I'm not sure why this place has 5 star reviews. I can guess they're from friends and family of the owner as a desperate attempt to stay in business.

Anyway, the food was so disappointing. It was bland. When I go to a Persian place, I expect the flavors to be intense...or at least present. The food I had was a huge let down. After liberally applying salt and pepper, the food still had no taste. What a let down. :( My boyfriend's beef kabob was also bland. I could make it better at home. The food I ordered (some sort of rice layered chicken dish) looked like it was made the day before and just reheated then served to me. 

The interior was also strange. Looks outdated and mismatched. There were only two other parties there besides us. Guess their huge room with tons of tables set up just gather dust. The atmosphere was a bit weird and uncomfortable. 

The only reason I gave it a two star review instead of one was because the waitress was very nice.",GkwKTvMpUp9A7QEmYQAeug,2,0,2,4rPbzLNdwTT2GCINwKvjpg

1942078,2014-12-15,3,sTZla2pB_nYR0Vg1nBj4Mg,"I had high hopes for this place- but unfortunately they were not quite met. Interior is fairly plain and looks like a banquet hall, but the Persian territory map is a nice touch and I like that they have a bakery next door. But I felt the food was overpriced and underwhelming.

Beef Koobideh ($10) was a good portion of two skewers with rice, salad, and a plentiful portion of bread. Flavors were good but rice was a bit soggy, side salads were fine. Overall, I think going to Shish Kabob House one block down is a better value. Other kabob dishes here reach $17-20, which is absurd considering what is offered at SKH of comparable quality. 
Gheimeh Bademjan ($14)- I really thought the traditional stews would be the best dishes here. This one is described as being a tomato base with yellow lentils, beef, and roasted Japanese eggplants. However, what I received was mostly peas, one small piece of beef, and no evidence of eggplant. I can see this being a comforting peasant dish, but it didn't have much flavor. Very disappointed.

Service was polite- once I was acknowledged. With two employees, only one ever approached me and it was after I'd been standing at the hostess stand a good five minutes. Noticed another Persian customer enter and receive immediate service and a warm welcome.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,2,3,gWJ2havsgA5zWgPb8rYrqQ

Of course, with every new restaurant there's always that hesitation that the quality or taste won't meet or exceed your expectation, but let me tell you, we ordered Koobideh and Mast Moosir and it was fantastic! The quality and taste was beyond good. There was live music in the background and baskets of fresh bread, in house bakery, that kept coming!

The place was empty except for one table of two.  We ordered an appetizer from the menu and were told it was not available.  Ordered a salad and the waitress kept asking us if we wanted the garden salad.  No. If we had wanted that one we would order it.  We both chose the Soltani and were told they were out of that too!   Wow!  We then asked for the ground beef kabob medium well.  The waitress came back and said they couldn't prepare it medium rare.   We repeated medium well.  We finally received the meal and it was ok.  We might try it again on a busier night when they have plenty of supplies.,0urjI2eySUkIjs1oDi9_mQ,2,0,2,vY8cTPdivNwLG6H38FZdLw

The atmosphere of the restaurant is weird. It's huge, with mismatching decor, and on a Saturday night, basically empty (only one other table). There was no artist on stage singing. In fact, the server didn't turn on music until a few minutes after we sat down. So quiet...

Our table was missing forks. The server seemed surprised when we asked for some, as if we were asking for extra flatware or chicken teriyaki. I don't know. Did I step into a culture that doesn't use forks? That's the feeling her reaction stirred in me!

We ordered some yogurt/onion appetizer, shirazi salad, and beef and chicken koobideh. Our koobideh came with a complimentary salad, which I could have done without. I don't find iceberg lettuce, some cucumbers, and some tomatoes appealing. The dressing was so sour.
