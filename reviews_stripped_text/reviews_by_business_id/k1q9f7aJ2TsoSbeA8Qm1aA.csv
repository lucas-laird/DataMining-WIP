It is really wonderful, there are not many good Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas.  I come here for vacation pretty frequently and there is never good place to eat but now we will come back to Lao Szechuan all the time.  The reason is the food.  Start with free spicy cabbage that is very refreshing and delicious.  Then we order pot stickers to share which are pork dumplings.  The specialty is the smoke tea duck, which is a very special dish, never have anything like it.  My friends have the Szechuan Cold Noodle Salad and the Three Chili Chicken and we share everything, but everything is so good I just want to eat it all myself!

The best Chinese restaurant in Vegas! 

We've been to Lao Sze Chuan in Chicago and it was great. We were so excited to find out there's a Lao Sze Chuan located in Palms Casino in Vegas. The food was very delicious and the service was above and beyond. Moreover, price was really reasonable.

We like the environment of the restaurant, the food, and the service. The price is acceptable, cheaper than the Chinese restaurants in other hotels on the strip. 

We ordered a Mongolian beef, beef fried noodle and sauteed baby bak choy. They all tasted great. The Mongolian beef is really better than any other Mongolian beef I had tasted else where. The seasoning profile of this one has more depth than those using too much black pepper, garlic and soya sauce. The Mongolian beef here is really outstanding, it tasted so good without having anything overpowering, well balanced.

The sauteed baby bak choy is well done, the veggie is just right, not under or overcooked. It is not garlicy as we asked for simple sauteed, so it is simply refreshing. The baby bak  choy is fresh, and good quality, they are well cleaned too so no sandy taste when chewing on them. They smartly cut the baby bak  choy into quarters vertically so they could be thoroughly cleaned.

The beef fried noodle is good, just no surprise, which is expected. I like that they don't use the very thin yellow noodle. 

We were offered a small complimentary spicy veggie plate as appetizer. It smelled really good but too spicy for us that we kept coughing. If you can handle picy, you will like it. 

I like Chinese food having the real Chinese flavor, meaning that I always compared it with what I had tasted when I was in northern China for an exchange program. I like food having depth but not overpowering by only black pepper or garlic That means I don't like americanized Chinese food. So far, with the 3 dishes that I tried, they tasted Chinese without Americanization. There was also no MSG. I hate MSG. I always think that only those chefs who can't cook well need to use MSG. So big kudo for here not using any. I hope they won't change on this aspect in the future. I can't speak for other dishes yet, but will update in the future after I tried something new there. 
We finished everything we ordered and had a happily filled stomachs at the end. We will come back to try other dishes for sure!",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,3,2,4,SZIDfSM7D_ROp8LLozEI7Q

My broiled beef cane in a red pepper oil soup. I like spicy but I prefer something with flavor. My friends shrimp were sweeter than most candy I eat and the other dish we ordered was just ok.

I had the General Tso's Chicken made with Tofu. It was excellent!! I also had the Garlic Cucumbers as an appetizer which was also great. A friend ordered a Veggie dish for an entree that looked pretty appetizing. I really wanted to try a Broccoli entree that looked pretty good, but I went with the General Tso's. 

The prices were also pretty reasonable. I believe the average entree was about $12-$14, but the environment seemed pretty upscale!

There was another appetizer at the table that someone else ordered that had beans, string beans, tofu, and I think maybe mushrooms. Someone told me it was vegetarian, but after one bite I had my doubts about that. I was certain it contained bacon or some other meat, but the waitress confirmed that it was simply tofu and completely vegetarian with absolutely no bacon or other meat!!! I didn't catch the name, but it was super delicious!! Must try it.

373857,2016-04-06,0,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"Decided to try this restaurant after they had a Groupon promotion.  Yes the inner decor is beautiful and wait staff was friendly until you pull out your Groupon.  Food was mediocre at best.  Jelly fish - give it a decent pass but hot and sour soup was watery, beef short ribs were tender but not tasty, like opening a store bought bottle of Hunan Sauce and pouring it over BBQ ribs.  Garlic snow pea leave were very old and tough.  Egg plant with garlic sauce was not bad.  Bitter vegetable soup with fish - fish was good but the soup base was not tasty, like drinking pickle juice and chicken broth.  And there were insects that kept flying near the food that I had to continuously fan away.  
But the worst part is that I took a guest and once I announced I had a Groupon the waitress kept speaking very loudly in front of my guest about how I had used a Groupon and how I had only paid $50 for $80 of food.  She did this three times.  I called afterward to let the manager know and he stated that she has a loud voice and several people have called to complain about the same thing.  The purpose of a promotion is to bring people to your restaurant and provide a great experience so that they will come back.

451973,2015-04-28,2,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"A fancy non-Chinatown authentic Chinese restaurant that has great food?  Seems like Vegas doesn't have any of those, but Lao SzeChuan was making a good attempt here.

They have (or more accurately- HAD) two menus- one of regular Sichuan dishes, most of which are pretty good though a bit on the pricier side, and a HotPot Menu.   Seems that the HotPot menu was either a seasonal thing, or they simply don't want to serve that any longer- as of Mid-April '15 they stopped offering it.  Maybe in the winter they'll bring it back, who knows.  Somewhat disappointing, as they were one of the only places in town that offered a real ChongQing hotpot buffet.  Great bargain, real spicy soup, full assortment of stuff, the whole deal, for under 25$.  It made coming here totally worth it.

The rest of the menu?

Not worth the trip to here vs anywhere on Spring Mountain to be honest.  It's a nice atmosphere and a fancy place, but the food isn't worth the premium over the plethora of choice you will get a few blocks over.  

Being a semi-regular here, the difference in the crowd from a month ago to currently is very noticeable- 1/5 the people in here on a Friday night as compared to before.  

Maybe they didn't want to become just the hotpot place in town, maybe they want to be the exotic Chinese place (Sorry, Bellagio has that one, the Palms won't ever be that tony...) - it's unclear, but the effect of dropping the hotpot menu is dramatic here.",hBLPLzTW6j7zHDd0Rk1xww,2,1,3,JsF1mYSKQmMw3z7LNXgu0A

700276,2014-10-09,0,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"I've been meaning to try this restaurant for the longest time. I love Chinese food, and this restaurant has been raved about it. 

There's nothing special about the restaurant. I have nothing to rave about or say that it tastes super amazing. It's normal Chinese food- nothing spectacular. I went with a group of a total of 6 people. Now since we had a lot of people, we ordered a ton of food. Now, on it's own, each dish was not terribly spicy. With the combined dishes, the food was spicy! 

Before we ordered, they served a complimentary spicy cabbage (raddish) dish. We ordered, shang hai dumplings, cold rabbit dish, hot and sour seafood soup, lamb with cumin, mapo tofu, string beans, szechuan pepercorn fish, chicken with a spicy garlic sauce, and  a shortrib dish. 

The rabbit dish had a large amount of peanuts, and the dish was rather small. It was suppose to be a cold dish, but it was more lukewarm. I think they brought us the wrong soup because it wasn't hot and sour at all. But we drank the soup already, so what can be done. The shanghai dumplings were in a mini pie tin. It was annoying to take them out of the tin. The spicy garlic chicken was delicious. The mapo tofu wasn't the same flavor that I was used to, but I liked it. It was really spicy and the tofu was so soft that it melted in my mouth. They didn't have any pork in it. 

They took forever to bring out food out. It literally took at least 30-40 minutes before they brought out the first dish. What's strange, though, is that they waited to bring everything out all at once. They brought all the dishes, and there wasn't any room on the table. Isn't it typical to bring out each dish as it's ready. And isn't it typical to bring the soup at way earlier? As a result, some of our dishes weren't as hot as they could be. The food was all okay. There wasn't anything special like this is the best Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas or anything. 

They did put auto gratuity on our tab, but it's expected as the party did have 6 people.",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,5,0,3,G7uzIHOTh4pE5VT-Z_14-w

The Mapo Tofu was one of the best I ever had and I had plenty in China. The General Tso chicken was among one of the favorites in our group. I can go on and on about all the dishes. However I will just say that all the entrees were a spicy foodies dream.

We have eaten at many Chinese restaurants but none have come close to being as incredible as this place. I'm not sure about other reviews complaining about pricing; for two of us, we got an appetizer, two entrees, pork fried rice, dessert, and a carafe of sake. Our tab was $66. That isn't expensive at all in my opinion, especially for the quality, quantity, and amazing service we encountered even on a busy night. Every single waiter/waitress/manager/whomever who walked by checked on us and made sure we had anything and everything we needed. Of course, we were so caught up in the food we were convinced was sent straight from Heaven that we didn't have very many requests.

My wife and I are into all kinds of Asian food - except, somehow, Chinese. It wasn't like that before. We definitely had been a Chinese food lover when in Hong Kong / Taiwan / Japan, but when we moved to the US, first to the San Francisco Bay Area, things changed. We found quite a few nice Chinese restaurants including Yank Sing in SF, Tai Pan in Palo Alto, Little Sichuan in San Mateo and Hunan Home's in Mountain View. But the number is disproportionately small compared to other Asian cuisine. We've tried many, and been disappointed more often than not. At the end of the day, we developed the unconscious habit to avoid Chinese restaurants.

The situation got worse after moving to Vegas. We tried many, and those attempts ended up futile.

So when we heard about Lao Sze Chuan, we didn't have a high hope - but this place turned out to be a great surprise!

- Tony's chili chicken
- Crispy shrimp with lemon sauce
- Don don noodle
- Dim sum: Shu mai
- Pork & rgg congee

Everything was tasty, and the portion was perfect for sampling with two people. I expected spicy food for being Sichuan, but for instance the don don noodle had just right amount of spiciness.

The best part? Reasonable pricing. In fact it's more than reasonable considering it's in the Palms Casino Resort.

Thank you Tony Hu, we finally found a place to return to.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,9,6,5,77AEyU7_as7OBHRWeauB1g

And they also offer you as many veggies or meat as you can eat any extra not eaten is extra charge. Last time I've been there the service was actually decent. The man sat us down right away and we served pretty quickly but this was pretty near closing so I mean we were pretty much the only customers besides some other people that were already eating. The old man that took our order was very sweet he gave us all the sauces and he taught us how to use them with what meat and etc. he even told us don't drink too much of the soup since it's not homemade soup, and that there's msg in it obviously. I really liked this old man he was a very good server, I felt bad because they stayed like maybe 20 mins past closing just for us to eat. 24.95 for all you can eat hot pot is pretty well worth it in my opinion especially when they allow you to order two soup broths at the SAME TIME. Like they have pots that split in the middle so you can put up to two broths (one really spicy and one healthy broth) and I always like to choose that option bc now there's variety!!

The restaurant wasn't crowded when we went and we thought our servers were attentive and quick. I rarely expect to find good Chinese food outside of LA or China, but this place could hold its own among our usual restaurants.

We headed over the try the new Chinese restaurant at the Palms after hearing about their opening promotion. (Go to the hostess stand - there are 25% off dining cards available until October 15/14). We tried dinner twice to sample a variety of dishes while the promotion is going on.

FYI - we decided to skip the $1 white rice and opted for the noodle soup and green onion pancake instead. I decided not to order the sketchy fried rice (in the Yelp pics, there is definitely soy sauce and carrots = gross) which cater to the lemon chicken crowd. I guess ""Asian-fusion"" = Americanized here.

Shandong beef noodle soup: this was a decent bowl of beef brisket soup - it tasted more like chu hou braised brisket beef noodle soup than your clear consomme beef noodle soup. My hubs is Taiwanese so it was a little different than what he is used to but he enjoyed it. Overall, it went well with the spicy food we ordered. The noodles were slightly thicker and round and had a nice bite to it. 

House tofu: a disappointing dish of fried tofu and nappa cabbage. Not enough wok-hai (heat from the wok), left the dish overly soggy with limp vegetables. The cornstarch they added in the end in an attempt to save the dish made it even more sloppy. They might have added some vinegar to the dish, resulting in an unpleasant sour taste. Not a fan.

Stir-fried green beans: (11.95) we requested the Szechuan style which was non-spicy however were accidentally provided with the spicy version of the dish. This mistake was promptly noticed by our server who replaced it with the right version. The small sample we had of the spicy version was okay - the green beans were stir-fried with cumin and whole/crushed chilis. The Szechuan style green beans were good - stirfried with some preserved vegetables. Again, portion sizes are small for the price.

Stir-fried large pea pod leaves: (13.95) generally well executed. We ordered this dish twice and each time the leaves were appropriately prepped (meaning they discarded the fibrous portion of the plant). My only beef is that for the price, the portion size is much smaller than expected.

Smoked Tea Duck: (15.95):This dish was quite good - loved the mild smokiness of the duck. They kindly debone the breast of the duck for you so it is easier to eat. That being said, for $15, the portion size is small.

Green Onion Pancake: cannot recommend this. The pancake was tough, greasy, dense and overly bland. Avoid.

Szechuan Peppercorn Fish: (15.95) the batter was overly thick/heavy for the fish. It was also not crispy enough. I'd pass on this dish.

Given the fact that I would probably not order half of the dishes again and the food is definitely overpriced given the quantity/quality, I do not feel a huge urge to return even with the 25% discount. I'd like to mention that they do offer a small dim sum menu which I have not tried. Although that being said, dim sum is a Cantonese (not Szechuan) style of cuisine so you have been warned. 3 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,5,0,3,XgX3Q_c_UBOmWvUIF71ZWQ

2641255,2014-09-13,16,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"Tradition. 
Comfort.
Value.

These words best describe our dining experience at Lao Sze Chuan on opening night. The value here was surprising! Every dish we sampled was priced very reasonably, if not competitive. The dishes we tried were served in the perfect sized portions to share between 2-4. My boyfriend and I actually took home 2 bags of leftovers by the end of the evening. 

Right away, I immediately noted the modest presentation and culinary style of master chef Tony Hu. It's a breath of fresh air to not be confronted with nibbles of expensive, weak and flavorless rabbit food. It's also important for me to note that the chef is not reinventing the wheel, he's just putting his spin on classical Szechuan dishes - fine tuning it to his culinary expertise.

We received top-notch service from start to finish. Every member of their well trained staff made us feel extra cared for. We were curious about one of the dishes we tried and one server took his time to explain to us, in detail, about the Szechuan chili and how different chilies cause different effects to the palate. He was articulate and eager to share his knowledge of the cuisine. 

I'll also quickly note that the ambiance was classy and blanketed in a swanky, modern pan asian decor - but that's what we all come to expect from a Vegas casino restaurant. Let me just put this out there - dress code is not strictly enforced. 


Here's what we tried:

//Cold spicy cabbage// complimentary 
The cold, crisp cabbage had a medium spice that tickled our nostrils and tastebuds. We enjoyed the spicy, slightly sweet and addicting crunchy texture so much that we immediately ordered a second round. *pro tip: as addicting as they are, wait to eat them with your dinner! This paired very well with the rice and the rest of our dishes. 5/5

//Chongquin chili oil wontons// (6 wontons) $5.95
We savored the expert layering of sweet, spicy flavor and also admired the striking ginger flavor infused into the chili oil. The Szechuan chili peppers pleasantly tingled and numbed my entire mouth, making it such a unique dining sensation. I only had 2 minor annoyances: the wonton wrappers were not as luscious and soft as I would prefer; they were actually hard and a bit undercooked. The same could be said about the wonton filling; a little lackluster and dry. However, the winning aspect of the entire dish was the sensational and flavorful numbing chili oil sauce. *pro tip: make sure to save the remaining chili oil and pour it over your rice! 4/5

//Sliced tender cold pork marinated in garlic sauce and chili oil// $6.95
This dish was presented exactly how we expected - glistening ribbons of cold, thinly sliced pork. The pork ribbons were buttery soft and marinated in a mouthwatering garlicky chili oil flavor - but the dish is not at all oily. Keep in mind, this dish is not saucy and had mild spice. 5/5

//Lamb with pure cumin// $15.95
A dry (not saucy), stir-fried dish with a gorgeous deep brown color, red and green bell peppers, whole Szechuan chili peppers (not spicy in the slightest, but great smoky flavor), jalapeño slices (not spicy at all), garlic, and onion. Pure cumin is the precise way to describe the overall flavor of this dish. The lamb was generously coated in the warm cumin spice and was extremely bold and aromatic. However I can't emphasize it enough, this dish was lacking spiciness altogether. Also, I personally thought the lamb was a bit too chewy and tough, yet my boyfriend felt that the lamb was expertly prepared and was as tender as it will ever be - two different preferences and views on an arguably tasty dish. In the end, this fact remains - the lovely cumin spice complimented the gamey nature of the lamb very well. 4/5
*edit: just had the most divine (leftover) lunch! The lamb marinated even longer with the intense, flavorful cumin seasonings, making it 100% more tender and flavorful. These are a solid 5/5 now! 

//Eggplant in garlic sauce// $11.95 
A traditional dish with familiar flavors. However, it was a sultry celebration of a classic dish, namely because they selected the most perfectly ripe, plump eggplants and gently cooked them in effort to retain their lovely firm texture and to keep their beautiful shape. They were insanely juicy, sweet and buttery. Also, the sauce was super silky, swimming with an abundance of wood ear mushrooms and crisp pickled cucumber. I couldn't stop eating it, even well after I claimed I was full. 5/5

All minor issues aside, my boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed our dining experience here; our dinner was satisfying and comforting. We are looking forward to returning soon, in hopes that the small setbacks we encountered were just a case of the opening day jitters. 

I applaud master chef Tony Hu and his World-class staff and wish them continued success.

Pro tip: Grand opening 25% off your entire bill with the discount card that can be obtained at the hostess desk. Expires 10/15.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,23,18,4,e4HCRBPzCt4ZXYglxPLS6w

Lao Sze Chaun is the newest restaurant opening inside the Palms Casino Resort. After hearing a lot of great things about Chef Tony Hu, I was excited to be invited for the soft opening!

 ....and this place certainly did not disappoint!

We first approached the host stand and were warmly greeted by two smiling young ladies and promptly seated. The room is very nice! The centerpiece is a huge chandelier hanging above the room. You also are still able to see the casino floor, which is always good for some quality people watching!

Our waiter, Adrian, was outstanding! Seriously, this guy went above and beyond. When we first sat down, we scanned the menu and were a little unsure what to order. At that point Adrian took over! He asked us a few questions about what kind of things we liked, how spicy we liked certain items, etc. and asked us if he could make some recommendations for us!  We told him we'd trust his judgement and to serve us whatever he thought was best.  

First, the appetizers..

- garlic cucmbers (very tasty!)

- diced green beans and chicken

- pot stickers (I love pot stickers and these were defintely the best pot stickers I've ever had!)

- side dish of jasmine rice to compliment everything, of course! 

...and some of the dishes...

-mongolian beef (one of my favorites! tender, juicy, and full of flavor! wow!)

- roasted duck (I hadn't had duck in years and this was great as well)

- Tony's signature chicken (fantastic! we shared a heaping portion and I look forward to ordering this one again!)


All the food was outstanding! I was just amazed at the cost! Most appetizers started around $3, with main dishes going from $8-$12 each. Not only are you getting great food and outstanding service, but you're also getting great value! You can't beat that!

Besides the exemplary service from Adrian, everyone else was also on top of their game! Our drinks never reached the midway mark before being refilled and dirty dishes were swooped up in an instant!

I was beyond impressed with my experience here and look forward to many repeat visits!

5 stars.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,23,18,5,3xMQvUmtWhAeUhm4kXm0Xg

My waiter probably needed to be trained again on customer service. I literally am consistently looking for him for a refill or for my orders ! There was a period where I waited over 30 mins to get an Order I had for some meat and veggies. The worst part was that I had spoke to two other ppl to check my order before my waiter came over and finally realized he lost my order !!!! After 30+ mins and no food we were starving !!!! The proportions were not good as they barely gave the bare minimum to serve everyone. I know there is limitations so that ppl do not waste food but we didn't even have enough to share ! Not to mention my waiter told literally told me ""it's troublesome for ME and for you when we do hotspot."" Um excuse me ? IM PAYING FOR THIS!!!!!!!!! Honestly there was nothing special about this place or it's food and probably the worst customer service. Oh and the manager lounges around doing practically nothing.

2946354,2014-09-11,12,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"I was invited to come in and dine and Lao Sze Chuan within the Palms. I'm so glad I did. This is going to be one of the better dining places at the Palms. We went during their soft opening and went all out. We came in for our reservation on time and we immediately walked over to our table. We were asked for our drinks orders and given a menu to take a look at their options. We decided to do it family style and EAT ALL THE THINGS!! 

We started with some appetizers. First my plus one order egg drop soup, her fav thing besides rice. Next we ordered the potstickers, they came 6 to a plate. We were then offered the Green Bean Jelly as well as the Garlic Cucumber dish. Each item came out one after the other.. The next more delicious than the last. My favorite app was the potstickers. They were hot and delicious, but I had to save room for the rest of the delicious food. After we almost filled ourselves with apps, our main dishes started coming out. First we got the fried rice we order. We decided on the the pork and chicken combination. The rice was hot and flavorful. The only thing I didn't like about rice was the Chinese onions. I'm not a huge fan of onions, and if i can see them I just pick them out. Otherwise is complemented the other dishes perfectly. Next we received the Mongolian beef. This was my favorite dish. It wasn't tuff and it almost melted in my mouth. Next was the Tony's Chicken with Three Chili. I was super excited to try this dish. It was spicy and chicken and i love both of those things. I had at first chosen the chef special dry chili chicken but was recommended to get Tony's. Now, I like spicy food and my plus one doesn't. After taking a few bites I told her to try it. It wasn't spicy at all, it did have chilis in it but the actual chicken wasn't spicy. I was the most disappointed by that. I even told the waiter I loved spicy food. We move on. 

The service was why this remained at 4 stars. Our waiter was helpful and funny. He walked us through the menu and made some killer decisions when it came to the appetizers. He also placed our napkins in our laps and even filled our plates when the food came out. YUM. We ended up needing like 3 boxes for leftovers. My last negative was the food temputure. I felt like it could have been hotter on the chicken and beef. I mean it tasted fresh but I'm not sure why is wasn't a hot plate. Otherwise, this might be my new lunch spot when I'm feeling some chicken and pork fried rice.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,16,17,4,BYUZl6xx1th5kOQQ9YK6EA

I sampled both traditional Szechuan dishes and dishes found in every Americanized Chinese restaurant across the country.

Shanghai egg rolls- rolls did not taste freshly made and tasted like egg rolls you can get in the frozen section of any grocery store

Don don noodles- my favorite dish of the night even though it was overly salted 

Spicy beef tendon- full of oil 

Fish with black bean sauce- fish was cooked well but once again tasted Americanized 

Egg fried rice- DRY

3162850,2015-01-07,1,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"Our experience here was awkward, uncomfortable, and overall unpleasurable. There was a group of 7 of us in town on business.  We are all on our own expense account so we need to pay separately.  The waitress was snotty, and pissed that we needed to split the check.  She did back down a bit and agreed to only split the check a maximum of 6 ways.  She wasn't busy, we were there when there were only a few other tables.  She just didn't want to spend the effort to accomodate.  

I'm hoping that something was getting lost in translation, because some of her comments and responses to us were just downright rude.  For example, when a couple of people in the party had questions about the selections she kept responding in a rude tone with the phrase ""I'm waiting to take your order"".  

Maybe the poor service set the tone and skewed my expectations, but the meal that followed wasn't all that great.  

Two of my peers chose egg rolls for an appetizer.  They were clearly served spring rolls (both are offered on the menu).  When we inquired with one of the table attendants if we got the right thing, the answer was something to the effect of ""americans don't know what egg rolls are""... the busser came by and said he'd take the rolls back and correct the order, but the pissy server came over, insisted that we were provide the correct dish, and her disdain for us continued to grow.  

Lady, I know the difference between a spring roll and egg roll. 

The large table was adorned with a huge lazy susan in the middle, which made it very easy to share each dish with each other.  The seafood fried rice was good.  The crispy duck was dry, it was either overcooked, or cooked in advance and reheated.  The Szechuan dumplings were spicy but good.  The steamed dumplings were just average.  The dry chili tofu had plenty of flavor, but the tofu itself was dry and again seemed to be way overcooked. 

Overall, the dishes all seemed to be overcooked, oversalted or MSG'd, or over-oiled.  

This was one of the worst dining experiences in the past few years.  The piss poor attidue paired with sub-par food left us wondering if we were in some kind of hidden camera show.  I think that if any of us were not dining with our work colleagues we'd have either responded more aggresively to how we were treated, or would have walked out all together.

Our waitress was wonderful....the best part of the experience, but the food was SO disappointing.  I ordered a glass of wine and hub ordered a beer.
Hub wanted to try the pepper rubbed dry chicken, for it is one of their signature dishes and I tried the boiled beef in schezuan sauce...another signature item.
Waitress brought a small spicy cabbage to start that came complimentary....it was the highlight of the whole meal.
Next our entrees came out....huge portions.
Hubby liked his OK, but was not really that impressed.  Mine was horrible.
It was covered in oil....like a ton of it!  I tried to work around the broth/oil to get the pieces of meat and vegetables out of it.  It had a soapy taste to it....very off putting ....not sure if that taste was the goal?  I have never ordered this anywhere else.
I am also concerned I may have consumed about 1000 calories with the oil content alone.....calories I simply cannot afford.   I helped my husband eat some of his chicken.  It was ok....rather spicy which I liked, but this being Las Vegas and moments from Chinatown, going here was a grave mistake.

Their  food was Cantonese style ( more everyday Home-style type of Chinese) and to us it was a 5 star category for food taste, preparation, presentation and large portions of meat and many types of vegetables included. Of course it closed  and the new Chinese restaurant lAO Sze Chuan is the replacement. The restaurant has a Master Chef which somehow must justify the higher costs of the menu selections and of course to help  pay for the remodeling expenditures (formerly Little Buddah""s). The kitchen staff and servers also migrated over with the rest of the employees of Little Buddah's. We wanted to like this restaurant and have tried it twice. Their style is Szechuan not our favorite type. Portions are smaller (not a killer though regarding this review). The food was meh at best. We tried cashew chicken, chicken chow mien, beef w/broccoli and a few other selections. The service lacks attention to the patrons because of the much larger size and most likely understaffing. I would be willing to bet it lost a lot of Chinese locals who also used take out ( including us on occasions) because of the mediocre food. C'mon Master Chef all we want is good food WTF.

Progress/change is not always for the better. I think maybe 2 stars might be the right rating but I have to let others post their opinions as ours might be slanted.

You can never go wrong with a cold dish of garlic cucumber. Refreshing. Light. But delicious. This is my must order appetizer when it is available at any chinese restaurant I eat at.

Surprisingly this was not very spicy considering it IS Szechuan food... But! It wasnt overwhelmingly oily. Very delicious. Made me think of homemade chinese food I hadnt had in a long time.

Sliced Tender Pork with Garlic Sauce:
It was tender but some pieces were a bit dry. It obviously had no impact on me considering I cant recall if it was good or not. Our waiter actually messed up our order and put in Chicken instead of pork so this dish took even longer to be served to us.

Fried Shrimp:

Restaurant Week gave me the push to try Lao Sze Chuan.  I probably wouldn't have stopped here but for their being on the Restaurant Week list.   Their menu actually is four courses and they have flexibility with their offering.

After asking for the Restaurant Week menu, the server brought it to me and explained that I could mix both the appetizers and the mains with smaller portions so you could try more.  Instead of getting three pot stickers, I was able to order 1 Shanghai egg roll, 1 chicken egg roll, and 1 pork pot sticker.  For the main course, I was allowed to get half portions of any two dishes so I ordered the three chili chicken and the lemon shrimp.  I opted for the hot and sour soup and for dessert I ordered the coconut ice cream.

My iced tea was brought quickly and I took the time to enjoy the beautiful room.  It is very nice.  Soon a gentleman brought my hot and sour soup.  When I was halfway through the soup, my server brought me the appetizer.  I just don't understand this lack of serving separate courses that I've experienced in Asian restaurants--twice during this Restaurant Week period.  The hot and sour soup was very good and I wish I had some time to savor the flavors after finishing before having to dig into the appetizer.  The egg rolls were OK.  The pot sticker was a bit of a letdown.  One side was not completely done and had a doughy taste.  With the appetizer I got soy, hot mustard, and sweet and sour sauce.  

The main courses were large servings.  A full serving would be a large amount of food for sure.  The lemon shrimp was very good and consisted of 11 shrimp if I counted correctly.  The three chili chicken was good but it wasn't as spicy as I like.  What kick there was came from cracked pepper in the batter and hot sesame oil.  The plate had a lot of oil from the chicken.  

The coconut ice cream was very good and a nice way to end the meal.  The ice cream not only had a coconut flavor but also had toasted coconut flakes mixed throughout.  Very refreshing.

The service was a mixed bag here.  My server, Rachel, was quite good.  She brought me a fresh iced tea when my first one was only half finished.  She was very pleasant, had a great smile, and if she had been doing all the serving, I have a feeling the soup and the apps wouldn't have overlapped.

My son and I have eaten here on two occasions and found the experience to be exceptional. On our first trip we started with an appetizer of pot stickers which we considered to be good but not memorable. The entrees, however, were excellent. My son ordered the crispy lemon shrimp and I went with the Orange beef. Both meals were delicious but the shrimp was the clear winner. On the second trip we started with an appetizer of fried shrimp which were lightly breaded and delicious. The entrees we selected were the chili chicken and the mongolian beef. Our waitress warned us that the chicken was an 8 out of ten on the hotness scale and ,while I did find that to be true , it was a ""good hot"" that added flavor rather than just heat. It is hard for me to rave about a dish like mongolian beef because it is a staple of every Chinese restaurant but this entree was sublime. The beef was so incredibly tender and flavorful that you wanted to savor each bite. One of the ways I judge a restaurant is whether I still think about the experience a few days later. With that in mind I can say that I not only think of Lao Sze Chuan , I crave their food.",87QeogWHFs6Nzass7FvUKw,2,1,5,-ei2qLincjXXjAP3k0GyLQ

There are a variety of ways to get many dishes.

The Szechuan wantons were the best I've had in town.  Spicy but in depth flavor and not too spicy.  In general on everything the spice level was just right.

Get anything they make dry chili style. It is spicy and salty but not too much and all in a good way.

Scallion pancake wasn't my favorite and they need to give you some sauce or soy for it.  Still very good and not too greasy, just in comparison to the other stuff it lacks.

Nice restaurant. My only complaint is the bar stools were too tall to eat comfortably.

We had the two sole dishes & liked them thoroughly but preferred the black bean to the chili. The chili was way too sweet & not spicy enough. We also had the garlic pea leaves which were fantastic. 

The hot pots look awesome & we will be back to try them.

The service is what I've come so expect in Chinese restaurants, which is not bad, just different & I actually prefer this style of service to American style service.

The soup was bland.  They did not give us enough condiments.  Between the 5 of us, we had to share 3 different condiment bowls, 3 scoops, & 2 ladles.  The table was small, so it make it really hard to pass the condiments and ladles around.

I was a bit hesitant as this is at the Palms and it is the old Buddha place.  I am thinking I would only take Chinese people to Chinatown.....

Reservations- 5 Star - Reservations are available and this is a plus when the town is busy with conventions. Many of the places in Chinatown is first come, so it can be quite crowded with long waits.

Atmosphere - 4 star- I found the circular design of the restaurant a bit odd, but you know what, it worked. There is plenty of seating for groups of various sizes.

Hot Pot - 4 star - Everything is all you can eat style and you order what you want, you just have to eat it.... Seafood, Vegetables, Meats, it is all available.  Noodles, and everything.  The hotpot has two sides, spicy and regular.  The spicy broth is chock full of red peppers, and you know what, the broth is just right and not too spicy.

The drinks - 4 star - You can pretty much get anything and there is a full bar, so no problems there.  We had plenty and I do like those large Sapporo Beers.

Service - Pretty good - 4 star - We had Adrian and he was really cool and entertaining.  He engaged with our group and we enjoyed his presence. Would have been 5 star but the other people helping us were a just not the same.  Adrian saw 7 of us tight on a table and so he sorted out a table in the back that was rectangular and more suited to chow down on some serious hot pot and all the fixins!

This place should spend less on decor, and more on learning their craft.  For being located in the Palms, suprisingly bad.  Skip this place at all costs.",wMrb4by6xiZ4vhr5m36D6Q,0,0,1,6PBpcqJIc1hOMFVJ8vp8ug

5770024,2015-04-13,0,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,We were at the palms hotel and didn't want to go anywhere (drive) so we thought we'd try the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. It is a little pricey but what would you expect for a restaurant inside a hotel. We had Mongolian lamb and crispy  lemon shrimp (walnut shrimp without the walnuts). The food was very good. We left with our stomachs full.  The only thing is they didn't have the fresh/live fish tank. So no crab or whole fish. But we were satisfied with our menu choices. We would come here again if we come back to the palms,YOvGl4FvQLUY27NxvMVj_A,2,2,4,d6pl6b8Gxb_jtVspGH9Hgg
5771810,2015-03-11,0,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,Quite good Chinese food with reasonable prices considering that it's in a Casino (Palms). The decor is wonderful and comfortable. Seafood Fried Rice is excellent. Wonton soup is so-so. General Chow's Chicken was good. Noodle dishes are so-so (my kids love noodles but not here).,d3ypnBp6yDHWShML-9k5Ng,2,1,4,2pl9PFNBScrpGNwzQ45lJw

5825254,2014-09-18,0,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,We recently dined at Lao Sze Chuan and were very happy with the experience.  I have to say the Szechuan Smoked Tea Duck (with Bone) was fabulous as well as the Sole Fish Fillet with Black Bean Sauce...it was to die for.  There were several of us in our party so we all ordered something different which gave us a chance to sample quite a few entrees.  None of them disappointed.  But the real star of the evening was our server...Rachel...she was spectacular!!!  We will most certainly be here again.,4E0tGWTGV53aIGNa-5aThA,4,3,5,4GuzuenMvRHW66Zb9ra7wg

Next up was the shrimp, chicken and beef dishes. Topped it off with green tea ice cream. Completely satisfied. Is it worth the trek off the strip?

Ingredients were fine, but the flavor (and I like spicy) were just not exceptional.  Service was friendly but slow.

Well, my party and I had THAT experience tonight at Lao Sze Chuan. It was opening night for them, and I guess it was busy and kitchen didn't know how to handle it? We waited almost 2 hours for our food to come to the table. After sitting for 1 hour and 20 mins, we approached the manager to ask about why our food hadn't come, and let them know that we were going to leave. We had made a reservation at 7pm, and at that point, it was 8:25pm, and all we had on our table was water/drinks and the house special spicy cabbage. WE WERE SO HUNGRY!!!

But I will say that management was very professional, and offered to comp us our meal, and invited us to come again. We finally started getting our food close to 9pm, and if you like spicy sze chuan food, it is really quite good. The flavor is there, and the ingredients are of good quality. They just gotta get their kitchen in check. And figure out which tables to bring the food to (yes, at one point, food was brought to our table and then taken away because it was supposed to be for another table! sadness....)

Decor is lovely. Chairs are super comfy.  And definitely order the dry chili chicken :)",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,7,3,2,kX9v_mI0ro0fwm9mWxQTgg
5911211,2015-02-13,2,k1q9f7aJ2TsoSbeA8Qm1aA,"If you are looking for ""Meh"" Chinese take out cuisine, this would probably be a good restaurant. The problem is that this restaurant isn't your local take out, it's a restaurant that will cost two people anywhere from $75-$150 including drinks. 

The food was just plan horrible. No other way to say it. The duck dish I had was cut into extremely small pieces with the bone still on it, but the duck was so dry and old there was no way to remove the bones.

The drinks were horribly sweet with tons of ice and little alcohol. 

The service was impossible. The waitress barely understood a word of English and when I told her the drink was impossible to drink and horrible, her only response was to smile and say ""Thank you very much.""

Do not waste your money.",hQ1TGSXeIfIkRvppBTf4vA,1,0,2,RZmMmice6Oy3Ga0WDnSCyg
