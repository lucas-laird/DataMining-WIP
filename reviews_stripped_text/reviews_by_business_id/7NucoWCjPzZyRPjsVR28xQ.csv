Staying at the MGM so went to the food court for a quick breakfast. Didn't think much of the omelet at Pan Asian the day before so I tried Bonanno's. If you try to order something different than the menu you will definitely throw off the millennials working there. I just wanted scrambled eggs, sausage, and bacon. They seem to find it hard to believe I did not want potatoes or toast. So they charged me as all sides which again through off the millennial cashier. Required the server to explain. Sausage was tasty, tender, but cold. Bacon good flavor but cold. Eggs had like a dry side on them, as they probably were not stirring them enough. They had no hot sauce to cover it up so I pretty much just ate the sausage and bacon.",SjlOVEa7uj5an6kroRYuJg,0,0,2,GbHRMIbEDgpg7owXdNApMA

I always had to have my chicken and jalapeño pizza with every order as well as a meat topped one. There was bbq chicken as well. Very good!

Pizza here is actually quite pricey... but late at night, there's not too many options. Pizza is about $7 a slice and a whole pizza is $34. I've eaten here a few times due to the convenience. Pizza here is just okay. I can easily name a bunch of pizza places that tastes much better. Pizza here is the thin crust type, but you can also order stuffed pizza, stromoli's and various pastas. I've only eaten the pizza. For $7, the slice is on the bigger side. It can satisfy your stomach, hold you over until you get more food... but by no means will fill you up if you are hungry.  

Most recently, my boyfriend and I ordered a whole pizza and after taxes, it was about $37. If you ordered each slice individually, it would be almost $50 ($7/slice times 8 slices=$48+ taxes) We figured, since we were staying at The Signature and had a fridge and microwave, we could heat it up to eat later instead of buying something each night. The pizza was big. We ordered a meat lovers, which honestly could use more meat. They really skimped on the toppings and when we asked about mushrooms, we were told it was $3 extra!! We passed as that was expensive for just one topping! The bread side crust was crispy, but the crust under the pizza was not and the slice was limp when you picked it up. As far as tasted, it just tasted okay... nothing that stood out in flavor. Like I said, it was a skimpy pizza, even for a meat lovers...

Would I eat here again... only late at night when I'm really hungry staying at MGM and too lazy to walk out to the strip to get something better. However, compared to the Mexican food place that is in the food court... this pizza place is by far better. 

The workers... the guys that did the pizza were nicer than the cashier girl who seemed irritated with people. 

This pizza place will satisfy you when you have late night hunger, but by no means should you go out of your place to eat here. The prices and food quality are not worth it.",4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ,1,1,3,EHGD7wGsgYNH9NUW46YFRQ

Sure, I'm a little bummed that I didn't yelp it and get to eat at the higher rated pizza shop, ""Project Pie"" downstairs, but I didn't think the pizza here was bad. My boy and I were coming back from a concert at the MGM Garden Arena and saw this place open around 11. We thought we might as well go here over ""Nathan's."" We weren't sure if we'd be able to find food elsewhere. We were tired and ready to go back to our room. FYI this place is located in the MGM Grand, so if you are staying here it's a good option for a quick bite to eat if you don't want to walk out onto the strip. 

FOOD: (4 stars)
I ordered a slice of Pepperoni Pizza.
-Thin and crispy crust.
-Flavorful, cheese seemed good quality.
-Pizza came out at a good temperature.
-This pizza tasted better than Sbarro's to me (has thicker crust and crappier ingredients).

PRICE and OTHER THINGS: (2 stars)
-Vegas Prices, Expensive ($20+ if you want two entrees and 2 drinks) I think the slice of pizza was about $6
-Could not find the utensils. Maybe they were all gone at the food court condiment bar by 11 pm. I had to go to ""Nathan's"" to ask for some. 
-food court ambiance- enough said.

Overall, I think the pizza tastes pretty good, was quick, and was our cheapest meal in Vegas. Perhaps, there are better deals out there for pizza, but I don't go to Vegas often, so I didn't know my options.",19FLqyu1rhuvTDAJ9QKQaQ,1,0,3,AEI8ru10jNe1Iko6aVUM2w

Ordered two large slices, meat lovers and pepperoni. Each slice was about $6.50 plus a small drink was $3

$18 dollars after I was enjoying decent pizza and a drink before attending fights at the MGM Grand.

Well I come back again I doubt it.",UtmsHIyNNgeVZlm6CYLWjA,0,0,3,lxlDEOylmg36hbR6zgcn0Q

But I wanted a greasy slice to fill me up, and I got what I paid for.  And $5 and some change?  Not bad at all.  A way better alternative to the McDonald's next door.",eCqmf-byOy_KfWSgQ-_AAg,0,0,4,qlCawXo2rIxYZZYVilsYrw
5593578,2018-05-11,0,7NucoWCjPzZyRPjsVR28xQ,"Hungry after walking around the area, and stopped by here for a bite. The review is only for the pizza: I didn't get to try the gelato. The selection was decent; there were a lot of different ready-to-reheat pizza options out, which was nice. I ended up trying their Pepperoni Pizza, White Pizza, and
Caesar Salad. Honestly, the only thing I liked was the Caesar Salad, and that was probably because it was hand-tossed, made-to-order, and drenched in dressing. 

Both pizza slices were remarkably bland in flavor, and surprisingly dry, while greasy at the same time, if that makes sense. I think that talks to the balance of cheeses/meats and sauces on the pizzas, but it didn't work for me. It was satiating and edible, but wasn't anything extraordinary, nor would I necessarily choose to return to eat there of my own volition (for the pizza). A friend seemed to enjoy the gelato, so perhaps I'll give them a try down the road and reevaluate, but for now, I'll pass.",NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg,1,0,2,6Y20PPTNk4R6Cp74-TvDAw

Bonanno's is very similar to Sbarro - the pizza is pre-made, then sent through the oven again when you order a slice.  You can also order whole pies, which are made fresh (takes a bit longer).

They also have salads and pastas, which have always been good when I've tried them.  They have a pretty decent selection of pizzas/toppings.

The prices are pretty high, but that's to be expected at a Strip Hotel.  They are open pretty late, which is great for after concerts/shows or a night of drinking.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,2,4,FO0ROlliO1XXL1SpCtcEmA

Decent Pizza. Kind of like Sbarro's. I liked it. Nothing crazy spectacular, but its good. 
Definitely a better alternative to one of the fast food joints in there. 
Would eat again.",GUw9aPUf1kLTyW0g66HFkg,0,0,3,jvIXRGTkdbF256LwI2JwlQ

It was obviously hot right out of the oven. We just left the hockey game at T-Mobile arena so we were in need of something good. Thanks Bonanno's for taking care of us.

Pizza is good as well as baked ziti but really enjoyed the Caesar salad with shaved parmesan cheese. Lettuce was crispy, fresh and chilled. Prices are very competitive for Las Vegas strip eateries.

The pizza was quite good, it was ready very quickly and given the early hour in the AM, the staff was quite friendly.

I got cheese pizza one day and pepperoni the others. Straight out of the oven it's delicious, but also as good the next day! Their garlic knot things are okay, not too much garlic flavor. I guess something to soak up the booze. 

It's located in the food court the bottom of the MGM Grand Hotel. It's the only thing open there at that hour bedsides McDonald's. Super friendly staff even when dealing with drunkies. I'll definitely be back whenever I stay here.",UuAsvnbEJptJb0N721gG9w,2,0,4,RaqKC2mvfk8jtqngsVvraQ
