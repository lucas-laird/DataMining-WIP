I ordered the chicken special, but got two long pieces of avian turd. Sorry if I'm being culturally insensitive, but the food was just not visually appetizing, nor was it gastronomically appealing.

I've been here before and it was quite good. But this time I don't know what happened.

My boyfriend, roommate, and I ordered a super gyro, fried chicken with fries, hummus, cheese cake, and Greek salad. 

The sauce that came with the gyro had almost no taste at all, and the texture was like water. The meat was extremely salty, it seems like its covering up some flavor that I'm not able to identify. Fried chicken is also too salty, where we can't even finish the 2nd piece. Greek salad was the only dish that I would've gave a 3.5 star. The hummus was awful. It smelled like neem oil, and tasted like cardboard. And last thing we touched was the cheese cake. I don't know if anyone had ever ordered cheese cake from this place, but from the look of it, I think we are the first and maybe the last to order that. It was chalky and the top layer was almost hard.

I really liked this place. But I think it has been slacking and needs more of that TLC. I live just around the corner from Fremont street and I want the cafes and restaurants around the area to be great. So I hope the owner would see this review and take this as a constructive criticism to better its food to a 5 star quality!",vGKzagg5cLslu_t2FwhyRA,2,0,2,pXfIme2IPoOFe3IFNzBGsg

The owners are super friendly and speak about four or five languages including Punjabi, Urdu, Malay, and Arabic.  

The lamb GYRO I had was excellent.  About 6 bucks and worth every cent.  They will spice it up the way you want--hot or mild, you choose.  Fresh onions, tomato, lettuce.  Like they used to say at McD's--hot side was hot, cool side was cool.  Tasty!

This dish is gooooood!  If you like spicy, then you'll love this.  It was a bit spicier than I'm used to, but the pita bread helped with that. LOL!  It's a big portion too, so I had to ask for a to-go box for my leftovers. 

What I liked is that the chicken was not dry like I've had at other kabob or halal places.  It's very flavorful and juicy.

Pros: The meat is Halal (if that is a selling point for you) cut thick and is decently tasty.  

Cons: The meat didn't have that awesome crispy edge that I look for with gyro meat.
The yogurt sauce consistency was really thin and gooey.  Not very appetizing.  The flavor was unremarkable.
I had very little tomato and lettuce and absolutely no onion to speak of either.
Falafel,  Ehh....  flavor wasn't too bad, but they were served with the same sauce and were ""doughy""

Finally, would I take a trip downtown just to go here? No.  If I was in the neighborhood would I stop by? No.  Too many better options for gyro (Kyklos) and falafel (Parsley).

Frankly, I think I would rather eat a good gyro more than any other meat related sandwich, dish, or anything. I am not Greek. I am not of any mediterranean decent, but I have the Gyro fever and there is no stopping me. 

So naturally I had to stop in when I was in Fremont to get a load of the Kabob Korner and their Super Gyro of course. 

It was a Gyro which is good in my book. It was super if you use the word super kind of sarcastically. Overall it was OK. Really, I am looking for that yogurt sauce and lamb/beef combo to knock my socks off but this super gyro was pretty super normal. 

I wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Especially for the area it is really convenient to have the best food in the world so close to old town Vegas. Next time I try it I will update this review- I hope my mind will change or I will find that gem that they cook like none other.

Wow if i do end up going downtown more often it's likely because of Kebab Corner. 

Found this little spot via a recommendation from Anthony M. Totally forgot about the Super Gyro so the cashier recommended the number 2 entree. 

Chicken Boti Kebab (Kabob)

I didnt like the salad at all. All it did was take up space for extra rice or another piece of chicken or a place to put the two sauces. Sure it did add a little bit of color but it was wasted space for the food.

The rice was quite superb. Very fragrant and spiced perfectly, every bite was a melody of flavors you can lose yourself in. 

The Chicken was just perfect, seasoned with just the right amount of spices, cooked to the point where there's a nice char flavor but still tender and juicy in the middle. Pair the chicken with the red sweet/spicy sauce made from dates and chilis and WOW.

The pita bread was above and beyond as well, soft and fluffy to the touch, chewy and flavorful to the bite.

Kabob Korner is a little hole in the wall in the East Fremont Entertainment District downtown that serves up some great post-bar Middle Eastern food (gyros, kabobs, hummus, etc).  If it's late night and you're crawling out of your 3rd bar of the evening, there is no better food for you downtown.  Tasty, seasoned, and salty.  You will talk about how it's the best gyro you've ever had (i.e. the tzatsiki sauce is feta-based and hyper-salty).  But if you wander in Kabob Korner sober, during the light of day, you'll leave thinking ""Huh, that was a meal, alright."" (not really bad or good, just decent).

So let's break down the experience by meal:
- Gyro -- meat is bland strips of overcooked lamb, topped with fresh lettuce and a tzatsiki sauce that isn't tzatsiki sauce (not dill-seasoned yogurt, but a feta-puree).  In the light of day, it's a rich sauce that will dominate the entire gyro with a salty flavor.  After the bar, that amount of salt will convince you it's the greatest gyro on the planet.
- Hummus -- bland, but well-blended.  You're pretty much eating this for an excuse to have another pita wedge.  After the bar, oh man, that toasted pita is delicious
- Kabob -- probably your best choice.  They actually season the meat and sometimes cook the chicken so it remains tender.  

Bottom line: keep Kabob Korner as a post-bar to-do and you'll be happy.  Visit in the light of day and you'll wonder why you eat there.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,6,2,3,3lP8MeCDsSFDCIdAtCWjIQ

Along with the gyros, pitas, and rice plates that are to be expected at Mediterranean/Greek establishments, there were a few not so expected finds such as pizza pockets and chicken wings. The decor was interesting as well- grapes hanging from the ceiling, vintage hanging lamps, and gold framed mirrors- quite a collection. Everything felt vintage-y, kind of old...Anyways, back to the food.

Chili Chicken Pita- bright red chicken pieces and bell peppers marinated in a spicy, lemony sauce, lettuce and tomatoes wrapped in a warm, buttery pita and topped w/ a spicy (Sriracha-based) creamy, yogurty dressing. The pita itself was oh-so-amazing. The veggies were fresh. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the chicken. The chicken was fatty- grease was dripping down onto my plate- and kind of salty. Nonetheless, I did enjoy my food.

I chose to drink nothing in protest.
Although I was irritated early on by the quality of service, the food was another story altogether.

For the price, the portion sizes were more than adequate to stuff me and my friend full of delicious kabob. I'm an ethnic Pakistani, so I know good kabobs when I taste them, and this place definitely offers the real thing. The meat was juicy and not overcooked, and the spices were certainly adequate. The rice was also authentically prepared meatless pulao-- much more flavorful than the white rice you usually get from restaurants. The naan (white bread) was tasty, but I doubt they bake it themselves (maybe they do, maybe they don't). 
The wait time was reasonable considering the quality of the food. 
The restaurant is certified ""halal"" (which is basically ""kosher"" for muslims) if you care about that sort of thing.

Food: I get the Super Gyro.  You can have your choice of beef or lamb, and I've tried both.  I prefer the beef.

I haven't found a sauce like it anywhere else.  My husband has gotten the falafel and it is some of the best falafel he's found in Vegas.

Luckily, I was in the half, who wanted something fresh so we ventured over to Kabob Korner.

 Gyro was only ok. It made for a decent lunch, but nothing memorable.  I even had a bite of the super gyro (lamb) from whom I was eating with, which was far tastier than mine.

No, not my first choice, but if I was drunk and had a craving for a gyro then yes. I might stumble there in a drunken stupor.",wqJtkh8Mem6-oYjWnjFEIA,0,0,3,rdOiOUss225umW8ZMeP7Jw

It was not crowded at noon on the Wednesday we walked in, so we got good service with at most, a 10-minute wait for our food.  We both had the Super Gyros with fries and drinks.  Drinks were more the warm side (couldn't figure out if it was the weather or a crappy fridge) but the fries and gyros was fresh.  But I must admit, that the fries were more impressive then the gyro.  I thought the gyro was just average. 

All in all it was filling for a reasonable price (Greek food can be pricey in Hawaii); the fries were fresher and more nicely fried than most places I have eaten fries (no, not just Greek places, in my life).  I even had to use the bathroom and it was pretty neat.

This place is located on Fremont Street just east of Las Vegas Boulevard, so coming here when I get that craving isn't always the most convenient solution.  

How good is their super gyro?  A few weekends ago my friends and I met downtown at Firefly at the Plaza.  I've never been disappointed at Firefly, and this was no exception.  However, after spending a few hours at Downtown Cocktail room (another place that I've never been disappointed) I seriously had a craving for a super gyro.  So after dropping about $20 at Firefly per person (which always leaves me satisfied as far as food portions go) I was willing to get a super gyro here.

Before I begin I will say that this review is completely bias, it is only based on the amazingly delicious Super Gyro and nothing else on the menu. 

Located in a terrible place to get to unless you plan on hanging out downtown Kabob Korner is THE place to go to for gyros. Now I have yet to try anything else on their menu due to the fact that I have fallen madly in love with their Super Gyro. It is a delicious creation of meat, cheese, and flavor for a reasonable price. All of which I love. Now the biggest difference that I notice between the Super Gyro at Kabob Korner and other places is the fact that Kabob Korner puts their delicious crumbly feta cheese on it and the quality of the meat. The cheese makes a huge difference. It adds another dimension of flavor that propels the Super Gyro into an addiction.

This time, we wanted to try something different than the normal pizza and food truck options. Although this place has been here for a while, I keep forgetting that Kabob Korner existed. Well, no matter, this particular night was definitely going to happen!

At first sight, the place is a little drab. Red and wooden brown are the color schemes. Wall seating also had a blue padded backing to it. They don't offer wait service here, so that might be the reason for the non upkeep. You basically approach the counter, and order. When the food is ready, you'll go up and pick it  up. 

For dinner, I decided to get the number 1, the Beef Kabobs for $8.99. Two strips of beef, saffron rice and a salad of tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. The beef was nicely seasoned however I little dry. The saffron rice had a nice flavor to it and the salad, in my opinion was just there as a filler. The overall dish was alright. 

I've been to Kabob Korner many times and thought their food was great. This visit was just OK, but it won't stop me from returning.

They also have pizza puffs, chicken fingers, fried catfish basket, hamburgers, etc.....I guess being the only spot serving food on that block, they wanted to represent every drunk craving. 

I got the beef kebob pita. The kebob was juicy and very strong in spices. I can appreciate that since I like stuff herbaceous/floral-y foods but I think that the corriander seeds in there need to be cut up. The veggies were fresh, the bread was chewy and soft and the yogurt was generous and cooling. 

For a pretty big pita and a drink at $6, it's a good, cheap eat if you're at Fremont East.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,4,r6n6lGwIhZi7aWGuVGs6HA

5390830,2013-02-25,6,gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw,"This was my 2nd stop on my Jury Duty adventure I had over the last 3 weeks.  Kabobs are one of my main food groups so I was pretty excited to not have to remove them from my diet just because I was on jury duty.  

I walked in and there was only one other customer sitting waiting for his food.  I wanted chicken and the cashier who I had the feeling was also the owner and/or manager suggested the #2 combo so I went with that.  It looked pretty much like what I normally get from any Mediterranean restaurant so I sat and eagerly waited.

(note: this 1st paragraph is all about the wait for the food)  5 minutes later the other gentleman received his food.   I heard him get apologized to for the wait and figured no big deal, I had a long jury duty lunch break.  5 more minutes later a lunch rush hit, and the phone kept ringing for take out orders, and several people came in for dining in or to pick up their take out orders.  10 more minutes later and I was starting to wonder what was taking so long, but I gave the benefit of the doubt to the fact that it did seem like there had maybe been several orders called in prior to my arrival.  10 more minutes later (30 total if you cant keep up) and I heard some of the girls who had come in 15 minutes AFTER I did get their names called and food delivered.  The best part was I'd heard them order and 2 of them got the EXACT same order I did!  I made sure to look DIRECTLY at the cashier/potential owner/manager at this point with a face that I attempted to convey confusion with a slight hint of anger.  He did nothing, so I need to work on my facial emotion conveying skills apparently.   I had to get up to ask what the deal was, and it was clear he had completely forgotten about my order.   I found it a little weird that he could have done this since I was SITTING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HIM THE ENTIRE TIME.   He didn't seem apologetic in the least.

10 minutes later (40 minutes total) I had my name finally called and my food given to me.  At this point the cashier apologized and seemed sincere about it, and I sat down to eat.  My brain had been processing how I was going to write this scathing review and I almost was hoping the food would be mediocre or terrible just so I could write a 1-star review which is very rare for me.   Unfortunately (fortunately?) the food was delicious.  I really loved the sauce the chicken was marinated in, which was different than how I'm used to getting chicken kabobs from other restaurants.  Whether eaten alone or slathering it with one of the sauces provided the flavor was really outstanding.   The pita bread was hot and fresh (it better have been!) and I also enjoyed the rice that was served with the dish.

On food alone I probably would have started Kabob Korner with a 4 star review, but I have to dock it something for that insane wait I endured.  If the cashier/owner didn't seem so apologetic towards the end it would have resulted in a 2 star review due to the length of the wait, but I'm feeling somewhat generous today so I'll go with a 3.  

Side note, I talked to some fellow jurors a week later and they mentioned they had also visited Kabob Korner.  Unprovoked they immediately mentioned how long their wait was for their food.   I'm willing to bet it wasn't as long as mine, but based on that and some of the other reviews, seems as though it's a fairly common issue here.

If you're concerned about cleanliness, ambiance, or service; this might not be your restaurant. If you want some delicious, cheap, Mediterranean cuisine it comes highly recommended.",RmJh6rLnQ8LdBHao9_ur5Q,0,0,5,5KON9S9MPWOGIZP47AGNxQ

The owner allowed me to order food and eat my meal even though they were passed their hours of operation. The Gyro was actually the best gyro I've ever eaten my life. Everything was fresh tasteful. It was delicious I plan on coming back and bringing friends with me!,uz1_cds7yyehTPYnrArdYA,1,1,5,XauSmLX8OiMoN48HohvvpA

I was a little surprised the beef kabob was not just beef tips, but ground meat with spices very similar to gyro meat.  This was quite ok though since I really like gyro meat.  The fresh made pita bread with dipping sauces was really good.  Kids got cheese burgers, which were very inexpensive, but very fresh and tasty.",7A8BozRafdOwXZJTuleC-A,0,0,4,HRhPux74VEzrH-yVjtw3Bg

They serve American staples, such as hamburgers, chicken fingers and wings etc., as well as South Asian variety dishes. My personal favorite is the chili chicken plate. 

The location is also a plus, as if you frequent the booming nightlife that's developing downtown, it's an ideal location to eat late-night or before you decide to go out to the various downtown venues.

My only wish is they bring back a few other staples that were under previous management, such as hot dogs.",kHKK7IiFwiHgS8xEhN3EVA,3,0,4,IhaY-X0vvoZYLXVq1Gfvdw

  Be prepared for a 10 minute wait as they freshly prepare the food. But, there's always a Bollywood movue playing on the tv.",WGM7TJ_U7Bbwx8C4Wu4F8w,0,0,4,rTJBWVkI3zlx6bcK7GhKhg
