They've got amature wannabe's trying to dj. What an embarassment. The stupid owners of Rendezvous say they're trying to compete with Moda, but they insist on using their waiter as a DJ. What a joke. And the other Ballroom DJ they have is basically a mute (he never talks), and is only good for dancing to his own favorite music, and taking pictures.

Carding's made the same exact mistake, thinking they could have their friends and family DJ for their new business. And now, they have NO business. How sad.",5Asin3t5827GVSgc6ECD0w,1,0,1,QxfXAmP7FacnAAV8hOuv5Q

I also found out that the owners keep using the ""Under New Management"" bs but are still the same people who are not paying their workers properly ie. A worker said all they received was $375 for three months of hourly pay and there are other people who have said the same so stay away from this place!!! Hello!?!? Nevada has a minimum wage!! Let the owners know that the horrible treatment of their workers is totally unacceptable!

Too bad I can't put a zero star, Rendezvous does not even deserve one.",Msr06tqnlXkB5byvAQ5yFw,0,0,1,eCFZeqm2eYQXCpkv34euLw

Food were not enough, and 1 worker, stated, ""because of food were only good for 30 people""?.How dissatisfied and disappointed we were! Some of our guests had to go to nearby restaurant, to eat as one had low blood sugar. Party was supposed at 5pm and host had to request to serve dinner at 6pm! It was supposed a buffet dinner and per person, but buffet containers were empty. Won't recommend to anyone!!

I was at an event in this place recently and no one served drinks or even asked most people at the tables if they want anything. We were left to get our own, to ask if there were servers. When u tell them what u need, they never come back.. The celebrant's family that paid for services that wasn't rendered asked for a to go box, and the waitress just said, ""oh I don't know if we can give a to go box, I have to ask the manager."" Hello! Just for that? Really? We'll just buy some at Costco and give them some for the restaurant, maybe even that they can not afford coz of no budget from bad business. This place needs to close.

3754620,2016-09-21,0,DkttCY9pgiJfpPt7MrB2KA,"I flew in from Nebraska to attend a birthday party that was being held at this establishment. Food for 70 people was ordered since a lot of the guests were out of towners. Food for 35 people was served. This was unacceptable as so many people did not get food during the party. This business is claiming that there was miscommunication with a manager that no longer works there. I would think that someone would call to clarify the food needs prior to the party just to make sure everyone is on the same page. 

My advice for those of you who are looking for a venue for a big party is to avoid this terrible mistake and find a different venue unless you want your guests to go hungry due to the lack of food prepared.",PjoaHmNfhDbgrs7AurMtZg,3,0,1,VO7ZLgrY3kUC4PNQzdB0Yw

The price package they charged 5K/ 120ppl  was too pricey. not including alcohol at least beer.  Where do they get a DJ who doesn't speak just playing music the whole time.  When your paying for entertainment they should get a decent DJ & know how to entertain guests. DJ MIKE SUCKS. You have to learn more about how to get the party going. The manager /owner walking around wearing T shirt and flip flops.  Come on be professional at least wear a shoes not flip flops. You want business earn it don't ripped the customers.

5150056,2016-07-27,4,DkttCY9pgiJfpPt7MrB2KA,"So... I was invited to go to a birthday party there w/ a friend; close as family. All seemed well until I actually got out of my car. The parking lot smelled of raw sewage. Made me sick, but I thought, ""It's Vegas.. It always smells like raw sewage."", so I moved on. Walked into 'Rendezvous' and the smell was just more concentrated; I had found where the smell was coming from. Now, one could understand the circumstance of the situation, the toilets having problems, grease traps; It happens, but this place looked run down, old, and dirty and the vibe was awful. As I looked for an employee I saw none, so I just went to my assigned seat. My aunt comes up to us to talk arrangements and she is furious w/ the lack of communication from the staff leading up to the event, so much so she can't even concentrate on the task at hand. We settle down, finish our discussion, and move forward. Keep in mind the smell is so strong at this point it just makes you almost sick. I look around only to see a few girls in black throwing cheap air freshener all over the room, which makes for a wonderful packed-litter-box/8-different-cheap-smells kind of aroma. -_- Looking for water and I notice that 2 out of 9 tables in the room had water. Had to get my own water. The DJ was AWEFUL, and yet a great photographer?? Our family had cameras. (Keep in mind ZERO service for 3 hours and smelled like *#^&!) Come to find our family is billed gratuity for no service. It was a JOKE!!

There are countless other cons and disgusts that my family and friends have to say about this place. It was also their experience, so it's not my place to put them all here in this review. All I can say for that place is I hope It gets shut down. It's a waste of space. 

UPDATE: Just received this private message from the DJ. Pull yourself together, Rendezvous.

Michael L: ""you suck to we were short of staff and i even let u guys play ur own music too and ur going to say the dj is aweful ur stupid you dont even know whats going on behind the scenes dont come back again pls""

Needless to say I gladly won't be back.",qrTT1lueHlQjF2bgw2uhFQ,5,0,1,Zl9p06AduNkY5GR9FsdNkw
5202612,2016-05-29,1,DkttCY9pgiJfpPt7MrB2KA,"3 stars for the food and drink prices. 

We came here for a show, Meow Meow, she is a female hypnotist. We showed up early to grab dinner and a couple drinks before the show. The food was pretty good we had the pansit, pork belly, and lumpia. The pansit was really good huge order and really flavorfull. The lumpia was good as well, however $9 for a fried app was pretty spendy. I was not a fan of the pork belly which  was really over done/crunchy didn't enjoy it.

The beers were pretty cheap, $3.50 for a domestic not bad, they charge per glass for soda.

The bill was a bit deceiving... they have automatic gratuity (only 2 in our party) which they didn't tell us and on the bill they have the tip percentages and a spot for a tip so if you didn't really look at the bill you would definitely give another tip... Kinda shady!!!!

We stayed for the first 3 comics they weren't that funny, we ended up leaving early, after the mic kept dying. Meow Meow was hard to understand and not funny at all!!

I would probably try it a different Filipino restaurant before going back to the spot.",SIGQgzGkVb_EHsRIvskmmA,1,1,3,pM9wryX6ovqImGVywlAouQ

5594582,2017-03-25,1,DkttCY9pgiJfpPt7MrB2KA,"This place is somewhere between a bar, a karaoke, and a restaurant. 

My family drove to Vegas to attend a private party held by my relatives here for one of my grandma's 90th birthday party. Food took about 30 mins from the time we got there to when we were able to eat. At first I thought they serve you food, but it was more of a buffet style. All the food were Filipino dishes, including lumpia, pancit, adobo, fried chicken, caldereta, chicken curry (a little spicy), and sweet and sour fish.

Overall, food was underpar. We had a party of 70 and it looked like they made food for 50. Considering that it was buffet style, I only went back because there wasn't enough food.

However, I really like the karaoke and the dancing. The first hour they made a tribute to my lola by playing her favorite Filipino song. Then they played dance songs. After there was a live band for the following hour. I really like the entertainment because it was fun for most of the family.",SufbYbQbPhPX0nFO7HCvYQ,2,1,3,cve9Hwe0-oRlYy2c6LyNug
