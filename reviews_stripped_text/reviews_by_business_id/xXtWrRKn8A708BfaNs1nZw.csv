The Thrifty ice cream is the best ever, I wanted to get another scoop and it is reasonably priced. I recommend this spot to anyone who loves Coffee, Tea or Ice cream ;)",v_dTnGObt-y9WZyHUJ3G4w,6,4,5,5-Q1AJ6qMAV0kHtBTpQ2hg

They work for your business and they care. A Subway will be opening up next door but other than that and Landry's, this busy strip has two other small businesses that serve great food with a more urban than suburban atmosphere. Coffee Tea etc has a great soundtrack and if the lighting was improved (even sun light warm fluorescent build are unmusical and unappetizing) it be five stars for me. I'm coming here with my laptop before work with good coffee drinks (standard fare) tic whack my mail or after work to reward my inner child with some ice cream. Thrifty beats the heck out of the overly sweet 31 flavors. The serve large portions here. Support you local owners and enjoy your coffee, tea, simple sandwiches and indulgent ice cream desserts in the shop near the crossing of the freeways.",mwYVPvK93YcOzE2H6i-uNw,0,1,4,4BzUQ9k-bC1nLhAMTq8hoQ

The Barista was very patient, kind and knowledgeable. Makes a great Americano! They have a 6 SHOT DRINK that is cheaper and better tasting that Starbucks.

1781315,2014-07-29,7,xXtWrRKn8A708BfaNs1nZw,"Friendly staff, simple menu, plain interior. Ranked in order of impact on the rating. I've seen this place on Groupon, but had trouble locating them from the street as they are  behind the Landry's and signage simply says ""coffee shop"" rather than the store name.

Was welcomed by multiple staff when I entered, menu is small and consists of hot and cold coffees, a few sandwiches, and Thrifty ice cream- a brand multiple small cafes have started selling, which I totally don't understand.

Iced vanilla latte was simple enough, and not overly sweet. Price was on par with anywhere else.

If you're really in need of a caffeine fix, they offer the Godzilla: 6 shots of espresso in a 32 ounce cup. Watch out!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,7,3,fOYY1lCQNXv93psxS04J4g

The clerk was helpful in giving me suggestion because I was not sure exactly what i wanted. I ended up going with the Cold Vanilla Latte. It was prepare fairly quick and was rather tasty.",hQSlT1ARUiNQ5e3l5BkR4g,0,0,4,dIvOEVVcnyxqNKuAlKoN6w
1842009,2016-06-23,0,xXtWrRKn8A708BfaNs1nZw,Nice friendly service. Kinda hard to spot with the construction going on in the plaza. I ordered a simple large frozen caramel frapp that was delicious. I'll definitely stop by again and try some other treats.,3pCH8DInBNtn2LKa56yVyg,0,0,4,fprUVOTy_A5cRlAczBpAqA

I ordered the recommended vanilla mocha, so delicious! I stopped in looking for a place to hang for my lunch breaks and think I've found it here. I would only add that I would like to have the option to have my coffee served in a real cup. It's too good to be served in a paper one with a plastic lid!",jvaRl7WUjaLREafa9Oegwg,0,0,5,Otgc5gz426a-g0e9lD34fw

I ordered 1 scoop of the rainbow sherbet. She filled the cup all the way to the top!! Definitely not stingy! Price is very reasonable. I am still eating my first cup but I do intend on trying another flavor!! Ladies sitting next to me where complementing their lattes. So that must mean its good! Lol Oh! And they serve chicken wings here too!!!! Mmmm tempting....

I came in 8pm on a Wednesday night. I wanted my favorite treat after my pasta dinner. Door was wide open with hip music flowing from it. It seemed almost like a party! DJ Needles was his name. Wednesdays is Comedy night. Professionals and Amateurs welcome. I dropped a couple tears no lie. My gym visit is NOT needed after spending the night here. Lol

The owner was present! (Very rare at some places) Very nice guy. I loove his hair  Customer service is great!! I didn't ask the 2 young ladies names but they were smiling and attentive. I was at the counter every hour. Lol. I am impressed and left with the feeling that I MUST return next week and bring friends. 

I give a thumbs up! For your time, money, and tummy ^_^} this a great place to come for Coffee, Ice Cream, Tea, or Me?

3839262,2016-04-01,0,xXtWrRKn8A708BfaNs1nZw,"Great service , great food , great deal! We got a discount from restaurant.com so we only had to pay $15 for $30 of food, which goes a long way here. We got two sandwiches, voss water, two cafe drinks and two ice creams. The sandwiches were AMAZING! We got pastrami turkey with provolone on a croissant and roast beef with pepper jack on a croissant. 

The great thing is you get to choose what bread, meat and cheese and they will toast it for you on the panini grill of you want. The toasted croissant was very good. 

The server there was a great guy! Very helpful and friendly. I give him an A+. He made the whole adventure worthwhile.

Also they give you a TON of ice cream so be prepared to eat a lot! It's a great deal!

Cool little gem worth stopping by when in Vegas, especially since Starbucks here charges $6 for the same drink that costs only $3.75 outside of Vegas. This place just has regular good prices.",nyS5P2zPQ9WFm45iCyUWGg,0,0,5,AHCcKY3RUa2rlbmQzg1r9g

The layout of the tables and chairs is not cramped and cluttered and they do karaoke or open Mic nights on Wednesdays from 8-10PM. Nice decor and affordable prices.

This wasn't your average coffee shop.. they brewed the coffee per cup & explained the step by step process while I witnessed a bowl a coffee beans turn into a hot cup of magnificence in a matter of minutes.

And mmhmm.. donuts were served as well! Yummy!!

I didn't expect this. The best coffee at a great price served with a little history/knowledge on how coffee was made-------the proper way ;)

Thanks Guys!",1ofyArnj5HyyARG9PCSw0A,2,1,5,oJvCXUljnBmDMHWzUxY-BA
