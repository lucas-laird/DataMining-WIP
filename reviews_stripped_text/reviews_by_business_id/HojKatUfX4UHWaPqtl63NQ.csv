46317,2015-11-07,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"I had high hopes for this restaurant but left extremely disappointed.  Rivea sits in the Delano Hotel on the top floor where Mix used to be.  The restaurant claims they have spent multi-millions of dollars to update the place but it is hard to tell.  There were many specific mishaps throughout the night but the bottom line is - the food just isn't that good.  They recommend sharing small plates which we did.  Each small plate costs between $8 - $20 and are SMALL.  We ordered the striped bass carpaccio and laughed when it came out because it was served on what looked like a tea cup saucer.  Unfortunately, the entrees and dessert were not much better.  Really, this place is a dud.  The service was disjointed, the Skyfall lounge looked tired, the bar was sticky when I sat down and the bartenders were non responsive.  It's a shame because the location of Rivea is unbelievable and the chef has such a good name.  With Vegas having an abundance of great chefs and high prices dining options Rivea stands no chance of competing based on my experience last night.  Too bad.",lJFMzizKJLuADH7JYKSfaQ,1,0,2,uoh16XkKUmeJtr08OAzQKw

We are from Northern California and like to bring our own wine.  Right off the bat, we were told that we had been misinformed about the corkage fee -- we were originally told $35 but it was really $50. They honored the $35 which was decent of them.  As for the food, my girlfriend was pleased but I was not.  I ordered the filet medium rare, but it arrived well done and very dry.  They took it back and brought me another one that was marginally better.  But not as good as a filet from Albertson's that I grill in the backyard. I also got the ""grilled"" asparagus that were big fat stalks that looked like they were boiled instead of grilled. Not as good as the baby asparagus that I grill myself or what I recently had at Red Lobster. The cappuccino was a good Olive Garden quality brew.

357602,2017-04-24,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"My wife had a great meal at one of Alain Ducasses's restaurants in Paris, so when we saw Rivea at Mandalay Bay, we had to give it a try.  It is on the top floor of the Delano Hotel, a chic, non-smoking alternative to the Mandalay Bay with a fantastic view of the strip facing North.  We spent an hour in the adjacent bar, and then headed in for a dinner that didn't miss a beat from beginning to end.  The octopus appetizer was simply the most tender and flavorful I have ever tasted, large pieces that were perfect.  The Burrrata was tasty and the assorted breads were an interesting selection.  For mains, my wife had the Maine Lobster with Lobster emulsion that was divine, and I had the Pepper Crusted Bison tenderloin.  It was cooked medium rare to perfection.  Others have remarked that theirs was dry.  Bison is a very lean meat, so anything cooked past medium rare will not be tender, so be warned.  We finished the dinner off with the Chocolate Souffle.  A perfectly prepared meal in every way.  Our waiter was very experienced (Lawrence) and guided us through the menu with just the right amount of direction and a whole lot of enthusiasm.  All the wait staff was very attentive, but never hovering.  I am not sure why some people have had less than perfect experiences.  Perhaps they have difficulty managing large crowds (the place was pretty empty the night we were there).  Any way, we loved it.

Incredible food.
Perfect service.


My boyfriend, Jason, chose Rivea for my birthday dinner due to the views and my food tastes. We waited a bit longer for the first row of outside dining and suggest you do as well. The food was a lighter French Italian mix and delicious. 

As  a picky eater, Jason assumed he'd hit a drive thru on the way home but he assumed wrong as we both enjoyed, and perhaps over indulged, every dish. 

Michael was our guide for this dining experience. He was extremely knowledgeable about each of the menu items. We really liked him and surprisingly, picky Jason actually tried new foods based on Michael's recommendations! Instead of the safe steak, Jason excitedly ordered the peppered bison and he loved it. I think I need Michael to accompany us for each special occasion dinner 

Our delicious line up and recommendations :

Octopus and butter bean salad
Lobster risotto 
Peppered bison
Duck breast with fig 
Asparagus 
Mashed potatoes
Chocolate soufflé 
Pear swimming in warm chocolate sauce ... mmmm

Bon Appetit! 


PS: Yes, I took a picture of the powder room to show you the views. No, I was not using the powder room while snapping the picture. Be aware as we heard some posted prior to realizing their reflection shows in the glass!",k4MuXYIkuCrBaC4xEjRhVw,0,0,5,0i3Z_WnblD90tVe-BGMYsw

That being said that was it. I did lots of research trying to find the best steak house to go to for for best friends birthday on Saturday night. Wish we would have gone somewhere else. Everything was fine while ordering drinks and taking the order. My friend and brother where going to share the Rack of lambs with a side of potatoes. When our food arrived there was 2 pieces of lamb and that's it for ($48)I don't know about you but a rack of lamb at ANY place I have ever eating is at least 4-6 pieces. You would think when the waiter heard 2 men say they are going to share he would have let us know it's only 2 pieces. We talked to the waiter told him we were upset about this he went over and got a manager. And he was the worst. Trying to tell us that a rack of lamb is only 7oz. And just kept arguing with my friend. When he finally asked what can I do to fix this my friend just simply asked for the other 1/2 of the meal, we want 2 more pieces. And he said he couldn't do that we asked him just to take it away and forget about it and thank you for ruining my birthday dinner. The manager RIPPED the plate off the table, with no apologizes or anything. I can't believe how rude he was and just grabbing the plate off the table like that and walking away. So after this another waiter came by and took out wine glasses off the table with out asking or seeing if we wanted another glass. I don't know if they were trying to get rid of us or something. I have never been treated this way at a restaurant before and won't be going back.",qR18_Bm4aDn4N7P9UfadHg,0,0,1,iZLgcCMmLwzzriCnShsdYQ

We were excited to finally try Rivea. We sat down in a nice booth and we were given breadsticks and an olive anchovy tapenade which was addictive! I looked around and the decor was beautiful but I was put off by how some people were so casually dressed. We ordered our wine with the waiter who was very knowledgeable and gave us a great wine recommendation. After he brought the wine, a completely new waiter came over and asked us for our dinner order. We were confused at having a new waiter (the other guy disappeared and was a waiter not the sommelier) We asked what happened to the other waiter and he seemed upset that we were asking about it. Anyway we ordered three small appetizers to start. We expected the portions to be small but we basically got a dish that was pita bread and some crispy chickpea chips with dip. It was a let down. We ordered our mains with the new waiter. I enjoyed the lobster risotto which was very delicious and filling. My husband didn't enjoy his pasta dish and the waiter never came back over to ask how our food was and dropped off the check without saying a word.

951281,2017-01-13,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"I am in Vegas every year in January on business. I discovered this restaurant a few years ago when it was called Mixx. It has been Rivea the last two years and is amazing in every way. 

I had three client dinners at Rivea in 2016 and three client dinners this past week. The décor and view are breathtaking and sure to impress. I have been fortunate enough to usually get a table next to the floor to ceiling windows, which offer the best views of Vegas in the city! Service has been always impeccable. If you are looking for a Vegas restaurant for business meetings, you will find that Rivea is perfect for holding a conversation without yelling in each other's ears - something that is unusual in the other restaurants I have dined.

The cocktails are hand-crafted and it is hard to pick a favorite, though I love the Cowboy Hunting, a bourbon drink with amoretto, lemon juice, and a little chili pepper for a kick. Rivea is known for its bison, which melts in your mouth. Several of my guests have had it and loved it. Some other hits are the lamb chops, strip steak, scallops, and fish for entrees. All of the appetizers are great but one of the favorites is the sautéed shrimp and calamari. 

The desserts are absolutely beautiful, though I seldom have room for one. My favorite when I do is the lemon tart with blueberries. A lot of the desserts come with a fresh sorbet. The lemon tart dessert had a lemon basil sorbet which was divine!

Bianca is one of the staff who has been there for a while and is lovely and gracious. And she remembers me from year to year, so that is nice :)

Cold cut trio: simple and delicious.
Mushroom risotto and octopus salad starters: flavor packed with excellent textures. Bigger portions than I expected.
Pizzetta: nothing special and a bit of a disappointment, but we did ask for it without capers, so possibly our fault.
John Dory and Lobster + Purple Chokes mains were right on. Great veg accompaniments. Delicate sauces that highlighted the seafood very well.
Tiramisu was light and not too sweet. With a double espresso and peppermint tea, a perfect conclusion.

1365512,2017-06-18,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"There are many reasons this restaurant gets 4 stars from this very stingy reviewer, and only one reason it didn't get 5 stars. Let's start with the challenging area first. Service is below the level it should be for this Zagat-worthy restaurant. It's not that the service is poor. Far from it. It is simply inexperience, as our waiter was clearly trying very hard to recall the information he was tasked to convey, but he came across anxious and distanced. When I asked him about two different red wines, he stalled a little bit and said, 'Well, it's a red' and then stumbled through trying to say something other than what he should have said, which would've been 'I'm not sure. I'll ask Norman the sommelier to come over.' Again, this high level of restaurant should have a bit more relaxed and professional wait staff. The French-Mediterranean dishes were exquisitely prepared and presented. The sea scallops with lemon and fennel were prepared perfectly, the filet mignon with Bordeaux reduction excellent, and the lobster risotto was amazing. The tapenade was, frankly, addicting. Finally, the view from the 64th floor of the Delano is breathtaking. Go for the food, the amazing view, but check your expectations at the door",beAq5lL5596kxV5m8a96bg,0,0,4,znQ7tLOtth_GD77XQlHw9w

The food is straight forward dont expect molecular gastronomy on the menu or a crazy mixology menu, service is attentive without pretense and prices are reasonable when you realize what exactly youre ordering. 

If youre seeing a show let the server know at the beginning of your dining experience so they can pace your courses appropriately.  If doing the Tasting Menu, which i suggest, give yourself 3 hours and bring someone you can have a conversation with. 

Although the food is great it wasnt anything that raised the bar. It was all perfectly executed and the plates, from the chantrelle risotto to the lemoncello baba dessert were well balanced.  Strong flavor forward dishes that you may get with other cuisines were hard to find here.

 I was visiting from out of town about 2 weeks ago for a early Valentines get away with my hubby (also our anniversary).   BIANCA was our server and she was a complete gem! First of all she was extremely warm, I have been to restaurants that are considered fine dining where the service is very rigid. This was not the case at all, Bianca was super personable. She even gave us a little anniversary surprise at the end. Completely unprompted, but well appreciated.

The Beauty of the room alone is absolutely exquisite like nothing; I have ever seen. Being in the room is like you are sitting in a Champagne glass while the bubble float around you. Obviously people may want to sit on the window because the view of the strip is the cherry on top! Best view in VEGAS HANDS DOWN. But any where in that room creates major ambiance. 

My menu favorites were the pepper crusted bison... The spice was perfect, the meat was cooked perfectly. The flavors melted together so well. Also the tender potato gnocchi was the best I have ever had.  Parmesan Crisps and butter sauce made it so decedent.   I cant want to return for that gnocchi alone.  

We had the most delightful after dinner cocktails. Bianca recommended ""Victim of Elegance,"" which was a very befitting name. Lightly sweet with champagne bubbles was great way to finish an unforgettable evening.",aKCHOEH7ySprq781iIUPtQ,2,2,5,LWC9_t2yNNTqFfpc7wq1QA

The view the view the view.  Amazing views of the Las Vegas valley,  and aren't we lucky that dinner service is around sunset time?!? Swoon! 

They're located at the top of the Delano right next to skyfall lounge.  Which makes for a great restaurant- bar symbiotic relationship.  We got there on time for our reservation.  The hostess, who was just delightful,  asked if we were in a rush.  They were running behind and if we liked we could enjoy a glass of champagne on the house at the Skyfall lounge next door.  Well you don't have to tempt me with a good time! 

After the champagne,  we were seated at a perfect corner window seat and 5 star service began.  We decided to share the restaurant week menu and a few other things off of the regular menu.  The highlights were the octopus,  the duck,  and the halibut.  The octopus was insane! Just perfectly cooked and paired with butter beans and pesto in a way that made the dish sing! That duck tho!! You could really make just a perfect bite in this dish.  Scooping up the pistachio crusted breast with the pulled duck and the jus, topped with a little of the whipped root vegetable! I'm dying just thinking about it! 

This is definitely a must try when in Vegas,  you just can't find this kind of cuisine everywhere,  and with this level of service and attention to detail.",qNeMBnzJc3Kwk8Z39TDZEg,2,3,5,wzabLmNyHNBs5GMaYO2bpA

I also recommend that you check the weather before hand. We had the best seat in the house as we had the best view, however it was so hot that to sit outside for food was a little uncomfortable. It was great for the memories, the view, the photo taking purposes, and the ambience - but not necessarily comfortable, maybe this would be better suited for the fall or spring. Otherwise, they have sommelier and liquor experts to help you with your cocktails, excellent service, the food took a little bit of time but no worries as we were not in a rush and also we all ordered big entrées. I would give yourself about a two hour time limit there because you truly want to experience each course and moments of the dining experience.

The overly priced small meals were adequate and the reach of the 2 foot long breadsticks was something we could have done without. The Entrees were served at approx. one hour and 40 minutes and only after my constant subtle baratement were we served. Now the Lobster and purple artichokes were a healthy portion as it should be at 50 dollars and the Bison filet was fine but lacking flavor of which this establishment should be giving you. All in all the food was again adequate the scenery on the 64th floor of the Delano was everything you wanted it to be and the service was underwhelming with the lack of attention needed for spending 300 dollars for two on a night out to dinner.

However.....
Upon making a reservation we also made a reservation for the rooftop bar with view which is attached to the resteraunt. Upon being escorted and seated by the lovely hostess, we were approached rudely by a waitress asking if we had a reservation (despite the fact that we were just escorted to our seat.....AND that the whole place was dead). We asked if we could take a picture outside but she rudely said no because of inclement weather (it was 90degrees and beautiful- no sign of any hazardous weather). The third strike was when a person in the party could not find there ID (although we were clearly all over 25 years of age). Instead of politely mentioning that you cant be in the lounge without proper ID her quick response was ""Well! You cant be in here!"" As she huffed and puffed. The funny part is there were children hanging out in the lounge. We had also just spent upwards of $400 on a meal and bottle of wine (without being ID'd) which was acceptable...but when we were going to the lounge to buy a second bottle we got treated so poorly within the first 5 minutes - we got up and left.

It took a few years, a new name, and a very nice cosmetic make over to finally get me here!  My wife and our kids and I enjoyed a nice dinner with scenic views of the strip.   Reserve early; at 6pm we were the first diners there but by 7pm the place was full.  It was a nice cool night but heaters overhead kept us very comfortable. 

The service was friendly and the explanation of the dishes were in detail. With any dish, shaved white truffles flown across from Europe could be added on top.   I almost did this on two of my dishes, until I stopped myself and asked what it would cost.  $45 extra on each dish!   My only gripe with the server is that he did not even mention the extra fee at all. Had I not asked, we would have gotten a disappointing surprise on our bill.  Though I do love truffles, $90 on two small appetizers we ordered would be preposterous. 

Otherwise, the food, though a bit pricey for the portions, were pretty good.  The risotto we ordered was excellent as was the potato gnocchi with sage.   I've had better linguini and clams elsewhere.  

For our main entrees, my wife had the lobster and purple artichokes.  There was a lot of lobster meat but maybe it's just me but lobster always needs butter ;)

My roasted duck entree with bigarade sauce was fantastic.  Pretty near the top of my list of duck entrees I've ever had.  Beautiful presentation and delicious flavors.  

We ended with some dessert ice cream and sorbet and pictures to remember the view.   Worth a meal if you order the right food and remember that you are paying for a great view and dining experience as well.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,7,2,4,BoQizCdZDZVV3Jwk6UTaeQ

We couldn't wait to see the spectacular views of the Vegas strip and enjoy some ""coastal Italian"" cuisine.  Pros: The restaurant was stunning and well of course the view was fantastic.  We started off with a champagne toast and some Potato Gnocchi.  Both were fantastic.  Then on to the entrees....
Cons: My wife orders the $54 lobster and I got the $52 Bison Filet.  I requested it medium (pink) and it came out well done.  It was tough and chewy and had overwhelming amounts of black peppercorn on top.  I sent it back as I really wanted to have a great experience.  That's where the problem arose.  Our server decided that she would rather argue with me that it was just poor lighting and that it was actually cooked to perfection.  Shocked by this level of service, I told her that I felt that I had said enough and would rather have the bone-in ribeye.  (it was good). My wife ate 4 bites of her lobster as it felt rubbery and really not that great.

The duck was perfect for the main course, and lastly for desert I had a tasting of both the tiramisu and the pear, which was injected with ice cream topped with hot fudge.

2927736,2018-06-25,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Tried the Restaurant Week menu for Dinner ($50). This place has such an amazing view, and really beautiful interiors. It is actually located in Delano (which is connected to Mandalay Bay).

I think you must make reservations ahead of time to snag a view of the strip. 

Overall restaurant service is quite slow. We waited a bit to get seated even with reservations. We waited a good 10 minute before we got any water (had to ask for water) or the menu. Once we got the menu, the Restaurant Week menu was not there, so then we had to wait again to ask for that menu. I think they might be understaffed? Once we got our server, Scott took care of us and from then service was all good!


As for dinner, my partner and I basically ordered everything on the restaurant week menu except for our entree we got the Liberty Duck and Lobster Risotto. It was cooked nicely and both were well seasoned. 

My favorite dish happened to be what was not part of Restaurant Week, the Beef Carpaccio and that Chocolate Hazelnut with Grapefruit Sorbet. YUM.

Do not get the eggplant caviar or the gnochi.  the server pushed the gnochi on us saying that it was the best thing on the menu and it was not good at all.  it was lukewarm and flavorless.

People who get bad service then rating the restaurant low are probably asshoes in the first place. Stop sending bad energy out! And complaining about the elevator? That's crazy talk. The restaurant had nothing to do with the elevator.

Anyway! On to my food review.  

BISON STEAK medium rare -- SO DAMN GOOD!!!

Lobster was good but that bison steak though 

We also ordered the homemade fettuccine with shaved truffles. It cost more than the steak but was well worth it. However, it could've been better if it were al dente (it was slightly more cooked that I would've made it). And a pinch of salt would've been good too. I know we had salt at the table but I didn't bother. 

The burrata was really good. The carpaccio was alright. 

The Limoncello baba was light and tastes even better after waiting a little longer. 

Tiramisu isn't too sweet which is nice. Chocolate souffle was huge. I would've liked it slightly smaller.

Wine was very good too! (We had a bottle of Château  Margaux).

The ambiance is perfect even if you're not next to the window.",48Y0wqpzagU3sTjfNfdr_A,4,4,5,QAiFR2lvuNROi9i8NuyO9w

There is outdoor patio seating available, but since it was very chilly out, I opted for a table next to a window. Very nice. The restaurant is nicely decorated and beautiful.

The food was excellent. For small plates, the beef carpaccio was tasty and very thinly sliced. The calamari and shrimp were to die for. I honestly can't remember another time that I have had such flavorful and tender calamari, ever. Absolutely delicious.

The lobster main course was divine. The lobster meat was cooked perfectly, without a hint of rubbery texture. It was also beautiful to look at, served on a round plate covered with a foamy lobster emulsion. The flavor was so deep and bold, and was easily the most delicious lobster dish I have ever eaten. Simply divine.

Service was great. Our server was attentive, but also never made us feel rushed.

3330257,2018-01-05,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"I was recommended this restaurant by the MGM grand concierge. I was told ""They have the most beautiful view of the strip"" 

I reserved a table four weeks in advance. 

I arrived to the restaurant on time. The restaurant was almost empty as it was fairly early (6:45pm) and mid-week after New Years. 

The first thing that I was surprised by was the fact that the view was very limited. The view from the bar looked excellent but there was only a tiny view of the strip from the corner of the restaurant and it was only visible from 10 tables (5 five in the window and 5 facing the window.) 

Eight of those tables were occupied. One was being bussed and the other was being reserved for ""high rollers."" We accepted the better of the two tables that we were offered. However less then three minutes later we observed a couple with no reservation walk in an be seated at the table that was being bussed minutes before. Then another couple walked in. The manager showed them to a table with no view. They asked for the high roller table and the manager walked over to it, removed the reserved sign, and said ""absolutely, the casino doesn't have anyone coming in tonight"". 

The waiter was polite but the service was not excellent. My fiancé and I both ordered the bone in New York Strip Steak ($62) and along with two sides ($12 each) and an appetizer ($26). 

To be fair the steak was excellent. But it was plated by the waiter at the table and looked terrible (Photo attached)

After dinner we tried to go on the balcony to see the view (because we couldn't at dinner). We had seen other parties go out there and take photos while we were eating. Yet when we tried to go out the door to the balcony had been locked because ""opening the door was letting in a draft."" 

Ultimately this restaurant is not worth going to for the view and although the steak was great there is better food on the strip.

In general, for this caliber of restaurant, it should have been a 100 times better. I found all the appetizers to be flavorless.

3649793,2017-01-11,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"My husband and I wanted to try out one of the top restaurants on the strip and Rivea came highly recommended, plus all the great review, we had to give it a try. 

The interior is stunning and spacious. You are surrounded by views of the city and feel pampered by the atmosphere.

The hostess and staff were super friendly and informed us of the status of our table being prepped and quickly seated us.

I believe sometimes the server really make it or break it on the first impression of a restaurant. Bianca, our beautiful server made our dinner an amazing one! Bianca made great recommendations and we were not disappointed with all the delightful dishes that Chef Bruno had created!

We came hungry, and there were too many delicious options to pick, so we went all out. 

For starters, we had the refreshing Marinated sea bass, the citrus really balanced beautifully with the sea bass, a delicate yet bold flavor! Lobster & vegetable salad was artfully presented and make sure you get the spicy tomato jelly on each bite. The lobster was succulent and sweet, one of the freshest and tastiest I have had in a long time. Octopus salad was equally delicious, but with a more savory play in the flavor and ingredients. I would recommend both, and you won't be disappointed with either. We also tried the Roasted panisse, first you bite into the crunchy crust that was well seasoned, then you are confronted with the melt in your mouth, soft as pillow inside of the mashed chickpea. I can eat 2-3 servings of that alone!

Matt, our sommelier, recommended a wine that has more fruity notes that went perfectly with the seafood and some of the more delicate dishes. 

On to the main course, my husband went for the Pepper crusted bison tenderloin (medium rare) and I went with the Liberty duck breast. What can I say, they were both amazing! The bison was learn, yet super tender and flavorful. Topped with crushed black pepper really played well with texture and flavor! My Liberty duck breast was topped with bigarade sauce which also balance the rich flavor of the duck and make you go back for more bite after bite. But my favorite part is the nougat placed on top of each piece of the duck breast. The sweetness and crunchy/slightly chewy texture of the nougat really added a layer of complexity to the dish, I was in heaven.

To top it off, we also had the fettuccine with shaved truffles. It was simple, yet extremely satisfying. Perfectly seasoned and balanced.

We thought, we had no more room to even think about dessert, there were just too many fun things to try. So we got the Lemon tart, which is our favorite out of all the dessert items we have sampled. It was not your grandma's lemon tart! It was a piece of artwork when it showed up! The little pieces of meringue on the tart and the meyer lemon-basil sorbet really made it an must order item from the dessert menu.

Since everyone raves about the Limoncello Baba, we had to give it a try too! It was light and fun. Also another good dessert to finish off the amazing dinner with, if you have had too much to eat like we did.

We were never rushed, yet the service was on point with all the servers check on us for water refill and making sure everything is cleared and the courses flow through seamlessly.

Thank you Bianca, Matt and Chef Bruno for giving us such an amazing dining experience in Las Vegas. We will look forward to coming back and try the other items that we have missed during this visit!",sUH9ux0vr9Jf_5dXSUI4Mg,1,1,5,3J2f3DT0N6udKHwMoLzQMg

I say this with utmost certainty as I've experienced place twice now. The restaurant is beautiful with blues and the famous glass bubbles. The restaurant is located on the 64th floor so of course they have the most amazing view of the city. There is both in door and outdoor seating. 

Both times I have done a prefixed menu with wine pairing which has been the most excellent experience. Some of the wines use a coravin (surgical wine opener) that allows the wine to remain inside the bottle but extracting amounts they require for a wine tasting. The sommelier did an excellent job with the pairing as well as describing the wines. *disclaimer I don't usually drink wine but I really love wine pairings. 

The cuisine was fantastic! I have never tried venison before and my first experience was great. Not gamy as I had imagined it cold have been. We also tried the lobster risotto and the bass bouillabaisse and both were fantastic. Honestly you can order anything and have a great experience. 

My favorite part, is the exceptional service. You can tell that everyone enjoys their job and this really shows through all their interactions. Professional and friendly, what a winning team!

It was great to see the area before and after dark. All of the wait staff were extremely knowledgeable as to the wines and food options. Our server, Lee, gave us two excellent recommendations as to wines to have with our duck. Both wines were extremely complimentary to the melt-in-the-mouth main course of duck. We chose three appetizers to share:  the socco, the octopus salad, and the calamari. The octopus salad and calamari were excellent. I expected something slightly different with the socca-- more of a rolled crepe instead of a fried chickpea type of pancake. For dessert, we had the limoncello baba.

4219160,2017-06-13,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Rivea has worthy potential but it's decor, view, and theme overplay the quality of the food. I'm not really sure where this place is going with the menu items but the direction is confusing (as are the outfits/uniforms of jeans and suspenders for the staff, which usually doesn't bother me but it was a bit distracting from the beauty of the restaurant). Service is SPECTACULAR. They hold their standards of service to an all-time high here. 

Back to food, I found that many of the menu items are made with quality ingredients but there is a ""je ne sais quoi"" about the success of Rivea's overall hierarchy when it comes to rating a restaurant. PROS ON THE MENU:
CHICKPEA FRIES or Roasted Panisse, just try them! Nothing more to explain because I couldn't analyze the conception of them at all. PROVENÇAL CAPONATA, tangy and chopped with love, not labor. The MAINE LOBSTER entree, excellent claw meat portions with an emulsion sauce. SAUTERNES wine selection, nice honey finish. And the TRADITIONAL ZUCCOTO dessert, please please TRY THIS!! It's like a Ferrero Rocher meets milk cake meets chocolate bomb. It's simply delectable but it definitely feeds 6 people, minimum. Some not-so-noteworthy items were: Beef Carpaccio, the texture was too thick for carpaccio and the meet was browning at the edges,  but that is a sign of freshness. The bread basket was less than outstanding and that's upsetting since bread is hard to ""mess up."" Marinated Sea Bass, just kind of meh and the grapefruit outshines the fish which is not great. Seared Sea Scallops, this is something that I ordered as my meal and was less than satisfied, especially for a Southern France/Italian-inspired restaurant. 

The view and ambience of Rivea is simply beautiful, but I wish the food would be met with as high standards as the look of this place. I would definitely visit again but avoid some menu items.",Ey_-5w0btBMtkn4zH4SzNQ,0,0,4,nNf05FLbmFE0Q_e2LwaJiQ

4255733,2017-01-23,4,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"277. Topped our last night in Vegas with a fancy dinner. If you're not going to a buffet, you gotta make it worthwhile with something classy. We sat next to the window and the view was amazing. If only the food were up to par.

First off, if you're a vegetarian, be aware that there is nothing kosher for main courses. We perused the menu the night before, so we knew about this before our reservation. We decided to order a bunch of appetizers:

Burrata and heritage tomato: Burrata was great, heritage tomato et al. not so great, The veggies were too soggy to appreciate anything. 
Butternut squash velouté: My favorite for the night. Love butternut squash. I wish I got more of this because everything else was pretty bland.
Potato gnocchi: Chewy but tasteless. Wasn't a fan.
Roasted panisse: Basically fried chickpea sticks. A bit too salty. Tolerable when you have it there, different story when you have it the morning after.
Tomato and basil tigelle: No no no. Way too dry.

+1 for service. Probably one of the best I've ever had. He knew his stuff and was able to explain the appetizers and drinks to the finest detail.

Overall, the place is worth the pampering and the view. Wouldn't come back for the apps, but maybe for the main courses. After all, how often do you get to enjoy a meal on the 65th floor?

- RSVP ahead of time. Especially for window seating.",qEdxnnadZ2tcU9JOXjnGdw,4,2,3,0mOu5ulSydnKS7c6PC1rhw
4294927,2016-09-20,2,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Ok let's start at the beginning.  The elevator ride to Rivea and Skyfall was pure agony.  If you are claustrophobic I might caution you a bit.  It's extremely hot and hard to breath.  So if breathing is a big deal to you I might reconsider.  Hot air pouring out of the vents made me almost go full panic mode.  

So once off the elevator we decided to have drinks and appetizers at Skyfall.  However the appetizers we ordered never came which lead me to believe their staff isn't well put together and they had no desire in making more
Money.  

On to dinner at Rivea!  First off very beautiful and lovely decor.  They seated us on the patio outside.  Again extremely warm outside and our party wore suit jackets and ties.  No fans or mist of any kind so the air was just dead.  Even ceiling fans would be helpful. I'm sure in the winter months it would be nice but summer even into September it's just too hot out there.  

Our waiter was very very helpful and had only good things to say about him.  However way too slow!  The food was very good!  The breads delicious.  So it was a nice experience with the music and table settings. The dishes I thought were beautiful as well.  Great wine selection!  Let's get back to the music because that is all part of the experience.

The soup came out cold and the lobster resort was nice, but I wouldn't give it a five-star where tasted very regular, plus it had lobsters skin, where I had to remove them from my mouth.
And I wanted to see if somebody come to me and asked me like other restaurants usually do "" how's your meal doing !! "",

I did not care for the long sticks appetizers with the dip. I prefer the bread and butter. They did have cute heart shaped breads for us. I liked 2 out of the 3 appetizers that we got. The beef carpaccio and the fish appetizer was awesome. The entree we got the veal and lobster. The veal and lobster was cooked to perfection. Loved it. Wish there we more vegetables and/ or mash potatoes or something. We had to box desserts because we were filled up by that time. I had a glass of moscato for my meal and he had a bud light. After dinner we grabbed a seat outside at the sky fall lounge and had a drink. View was gorgeous. The heat lamps were lit outside it was kind of chilly.

I have now dined at Rivea Las Vegas twice and it is official - this is a must for EVERY Vegas trip. 

The view of the Vegas skyline is amazing, dining on the outdoor patio is breathtaking and the food is fantastic!

Here are some PRO tips:
- patio and window seats are not guaranteed so put a request in your reservation and plan a little extra time to get a drink in Skyfall Lounge before dinner just in case if you have to wait for a table. Trust me, it will be worth it. 
- order the octopus salad, seabass crudo, and lobster risotto as first course (that's the perfect amount for 2 people to share) 
- order the duck and the bison for main course with the potato gnocchi as a side (you can thank me later) 

Last but not least - the service has always been great (which if you've dined on the Vegas Strip a few times you know can be hit or miss). It was attentive but not rushed and we never felt interrupted.",K41uH5wgBVTi3aHMo4OFmg,0,0,5,Nn8a6D5Ye2L4BIqmwGt4SQ

4670126,2017-06-13,1,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Unfortunately my experience with the restaurant called Mix, which preceded Rivea in the same location, has drawn down my rating to four stars because it let me know what this place can be instead of what it is currently.  Quick version is unquestionably five star food and service, but the decor and ambience pull it down to four overall.  I will prefix this by admitting I have some bias because I rented out the prior restaurant for my wedding and reception years ago, and return every year, but I think my points are still going to be valid, and while it was nearly perfect before, it's not quite at that level now.

Mix was very classy and had an openness to it thanks to the incredible view and everything being white/off white, including the seating, tables and floor; none of it distracted from the food or view.  The service staff wore suits as did many of the patrons, but even sans jacket, patrons would dress appropriately for the caliber of restaurant it was and still is.  The balcony dining was no different than inside other than the fact that nothing separated you from the air and view beyond the glass plate railings.

Here's how my Rivea experience went the first time back since the remodel/rename.  It's dark.  The walls went from white to perhaps a gray or similar, hard to tell exactly since we went at sunset.  Instead of just free standing tables, they've been sectioned off with dark brown booth dividers everywhere.  I suppose this may make it feel more intimate for some, but I felt like it just made the layout busier, and the color darkened things even more.  Table lighting is now via large dark brown hanging lamps, intruding further on the space of a two story open dining room.

Outside dining has its own theme now; the seating is on colorful metal deck chairs with cushions.  Deck chairs for $120+/pp meals seems odd.

Service is impeccable as it has been every time we've visited.  You will never have to wait longer than a few minutes if you need something and choose to not flag someone down, and typically you only need something in addition to what you have because mistakes are almost non-existent in both the service and food prep.  The new staff 'uniform' is peculiar.  It's some kind of French Mediterranean theme where the staff wear dark blue jeans, suspenders, sneakers (Converse seemed popular), and perhaps if you're the primary server you also have a vest of some sort, maybe a bow tie.  Honestly I don't care that much, it just doesn't seem like it fits all that well given every other aspect of the restaurant.  There's a gentleman named Renee who is one of the server assistants and one of the most attentive and pleasant restaurant staff I've encountered; he's been there for over six years (based on first time we encountered him) and goes above and beyond every single time.

As far as patrons go, I'm not sure if there ever was a dress code in years past, but I never saw anyone in there that wasn't in at least pants and a shirt before.  Currently, and perhaps this is a testament to today's society, or there actually was a dress code that has been relaxed with the remodel/rename, it's not that anymore.  This time around, there were a few patrons in cargo shorts and t-shirts, along with a guy in very short shorts (think slightly longer than 1980's NBA uniform).  When you're out having a high caliber meal, you just don't really expect to see some dude's pasty white thighs and leg hair walking past you.

Finally, the food.  While I miss many of the items that had been on the Mix menu, the options are still plentiful and still excellent.  I'm particularly fond of the peppercorn bison, and my wife's filet was prepared perfectly.  The lobster risotto was melt in your mouth.  Appetizers include bread sticks with an olive-derived spread to put on them; similar in texture to hummus.  Bread and butter were also served.  We had the roasted panisse which is basically flash fried chickpea fries; great texture inside with just enough crunch on the outside.  I REALLY miss the lobster curry from Mix, but it's off the menu now.  So, no complaints about our perfectly prepared food, or its price, which seemed perfectly inline with what we received.

Last but not least, Rivea has added something very nice that Mix didn't have; private dining / meeting space.  What had been unfinished space in the north end of the building is now a pair of private rooms for dining and/or gathering with the same floor to ceiling windows giving you both mountain and strip, so you can host an event there of smaller proportion than a full restaurant buy out.  Take it from me, this is the perfect place to get married and/or host a reception, and being able to do so at what is probably going to be significantly less expensive than a full buy out means it's now available to many more.

I really love Rivea, its food and its staff, but I miss the end to end five star experience that Mix had.",vhMMA4vymXwtoTbIrD1g6A,1,5,4,GqF1Wjd5rR2-zAlszl2zfg

The service was absolutely amazing, with enough visits that nobody ever had empty water or beverage, but not so insistent it became a hassle. The menu has a nice mix of traditional classics but also some interesting and more modern dishes as well. It was basically segmented in a small plates section and an entrees section. 

We came here for a business meal with clients and ordered a bunch of small plates including the buffalo mozzarella and tomato basil salad, gnocchi and mushroom risotto. Each one was absolutely fantastic. Most of our table ordered the Bison Tenderloin, which was heavily peppered (as advertised) and cooled to perfection. Bison can at times be a bit dry due to the low fat content but this was not the case at all here. Finally we ordered several desserts to share at the table, and each was excellent, though nothing over the top spectacular.

Finally, being situated on top of the Delano tower in the Mandalay Bay resort, the view is absolutely spectacular, and could make up for any shortcomings, which are very few.

First, the server wouldn't even let customers ask if a specific order was a possibility, cutting everyone off on multiple occasions.  At one point someone had to tell him to let them finish speaking.

In addition, extra items were brought out, so 5 sides were ordered and more were delivered to the table and charged for.   Food prep was wrong, steaks not cooked as requested, and extra sauces put in the food when not desired.  In one specific case one of the desserts was more than 5 minutes later than everyone else's.

4778096,2018-06-28,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"As a budget minded Vegas local, I only really go to Strip restaurants during Restaurant week.  Alain Ducasse is a world famous Michelin star chef so I had high expectations, maybe it was unwarranted.  The starters were hit and miss.  The panisse (chickpea fries) had a delicate crispy crust and soft on the inside, very delicious and comforting.  The provencal caponata was average and wasn't easy to eat.  The marinated sea bass and grilled octopus bean salad were both winners.  My husband said the octopus was the best he ever had, since it was lightly cooked without any hint of chewiness.  The sea bass starter was a lightly flavored ceviche, very refreshing.  
My duck dish was perfectly cooked, except for the super salty duck shreds on the side and the overly sweet sauce.  My husbands halibut dish was average, I felt the fish could have been more moist.  
The tiramisu dessert was excellent but my husband's vacherin dessert (a sorbet and meringue dessert) was too tart.  Maybe the fruit wasn't ripe enough.  Overall, I expected sublime dishes from a revered chef and the reality was a real hit and miss.  The service staff were very attentive though.",EYcrZxm0A9VKGjR-yizDvw,1,1,3,nG6wLJcyrKdohXq2YqjkNQ

4879311,2015-12-27,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"First off this should be a zero star. The Delano hotel initially was awesome. When we checked into the hotel this restaurant was recommended on the 64 the floor. When my wife and I went there right after check in, the front hostess said to it is fine to go to bar area because we were in casual wear. After spending money on drinks, I had to go to the restroom and I approached the same front hostess to ask for the restroom and she said I would need to take off my hat and my wife would need to take her beanie off if I wanted to use the restroom. Mind you it is 30 degrees here and we already were spending money at the hotel and the restaurant. The staff is snotty and pretentious and discriminates on what you wear. We spoke with the bar manager who was nice but defended the restaurant's dress code which we didn't know about. Bottom line is dress for your food and cocktail not for service kindness and hospitality. It is really sad to witness this kind of discrimination when you are bringing money to an establishment that wasn't busy with people. I can see why. It is not worth going here.

4909171,2018-03-02,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Went to Rivea for a friend's reunion on a Monday night. We didn't have special table request but the hostess was very nice to offer us a great table with a view of Las Vegas Strip. The restaurant is beautiful with great ambiance. I love the blue color theme of the restaurant. They have an impressive wine list. A bit tough to choose one since there are so many great wines on their list, we got some help from Matt, the sommelier. He is so knowledgeable and helped us to pick a great bottle Pinot Noir, since Pinot is my favorite. The wine went so well with my dinner. Their menu is quite unique with a lot to offer. I ended up with the Tour of The Riviera tasting menu. It was a 5 courses of Rivea classics selected by Chef Bruno Riou. Started with Roasted Panisse- chickpea fries, 2nd course was Black Truffle Risotto, it was delicious risotto with shaved black truffles on the top, everything blend very on this dish. Third course was John Dory, it kind of a seafood bouillabaisse with claim, mussel, prawn, Calamari, confit tomato. 4th course was the Rossini, Angus Filet mignon topped with duck foie gras and back truffle sauce, it was amazing filet, cooked to perfection and of course came with a perfectly seared foie gras. For dessert, I got the Limoncello baba. The dinner was amazing. Our server was Bianca, she was so friendly, knowledgeable and very welcoming us. We will ask for her again when we come back next time. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend Rivea. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

4996824,2017-02-28,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"I have dined in several of Alain Ducasse establishments in London and Paris - and really wanted to re-live this experience on a recent business trip to Vegas. This place gets 5 stars for the views and ambience as the decor is very modern chique as well for the incredible service of the waiters and the sommelier. Came here with a group of co-workers on a Monday for some celebratory libation and dining. The waiter and the service were truly exceptional with lots of attention given to the table setting, explaining the menu, suggesting dishes and specials. The Sommelier was well versed in the expansive wine list and was able to pair up a great Gamay with a rather mixed set of appetizers and later on main courses. The food presentation was unique with lots of people making a show of pouring sauces, accompaniments, etc. 
And that brings me to the food. For those who don't often dine in high-end restaurants, this place probably epitomises haute cuisine. I, personally, was left with a ""meh"" feeling after sampling at least 8 different dishes. 
We were talked into a linguine with black truffles (as they are in season) - and while the pasta came with a copious amounts of truffle shavings (the real stuff, not the crap they shake on your ""truffle fries"") - the overall taste profile lacked depth and most importantly salt. What could have been a very simple but delicious dish, was rather bland. Calamari and shrimp appetizer delivered rather rubbery rings of squid albeit in an interesting sauce that covered up the textural imperfections. It's hard to screw up a burrata and tomato salad - and they didn't. Those two ingredients are a nature's perfect pairing and coated with good olive oil and appropriate spices was a highlight of the appetizer round. For my main, I ordered the duck breast - it's a dish I go to as I belive it takes a particular set of skills to render the fat appropriately and end up with medium rare middle and a crispy skin. That part was done perfectly. However, it's pairing with nougat was at best puzzling and at worse misguided. The bigarade sauce that accompanied the duck was more sweet and candy-like than citrusy as it should have been and the selection of baby greens that was artfully scattered on the plate included something that clashed terribly with the rest of the plate. I can't put my finger on what exactly it was - but the bitter, mint/nettle overtone made me gag. 
I sampled some of my colleague's dishes of filet mignon which was just OK, tender but plain and the rack of lamb which was pretty loaded with a layer of gristle and fat. 
So...overall the dining experience was good but not exceptional and I guess I was really hoping that this place matched the other Ducasse restaurants. It still has a lot to live up to.",9L_1hC-DJJ4Uyy3n5Xc2FQ,3,0,3,zVHXX9j3KoFbuxXL7veZuQ

5042620,2016-04-19,1,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Dinning at Rivea is very unique because of the view. Try and get a table on the outside balcony-weather permitting. I was surprised it was not full on a Friday night at prime time. Service was fantastic as Jared our server was on point all evening. It was hard for me to understand how much food to order with their small plates. They said 3 or 4 but I found 2 or 3 would do. I tried some of the stripped bass carpaccio (wonderful), mushroom risotto (just fine), sauteed broccolini  (good) and the mashed potatoes (very good).

I didn't order dessert because the small plates filled me up! Their wine list is fine and they have a strong cocktail list. 

Bottom line: this is a fun ""date"" place and will impress. Here is what you do - Make a reservation at Rivea for a balcony table. Go to the Delano early and have a drink next door at Skyfall first (see my Skyfall review). Then have a balcony dinner here  (take a date selfie with the entire Las Vegas strip behind you - you will want to frame that photo at a later date)  - then return to Skyfall for after dinner drinks.

5094727,2015-12-26,15,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"""An Unparalleled View"" starts the description of power house Michelin rated chef Alan Ducasse.  Perhaps I'm wrong but I thought it was the food that should lead any description of a restaurant.  But what do I know?  I don't have Michelin stars.

That said, the decor is straight out of an upend, sea side, boutique hotel on the Mediterranean.  Warm walls intermingled with dark earth tones off set by playful pastels (hey, I can write designer reviews too).  The view is stunning.  The only complaint; the restaurant seems out of place on the top of a Vegas hotel.

To the food; this is a ""shared plates"" type of eatery.  The flavors merge classic French against the restrained simplicity of Italian cuisine.  Ingredients are treated with respect, flavors bold and despite the elaborate plating, very comforting.

For starters, the charcuterie featuring an phenomenal culatello is a must order.  Eating with your fingers and swigging some simple wine from Tuscany sets the mood.  The sea beam with citrus supremes well executed.  Think of ceviche minus the heavy acid. The flesh is slightly firm with the gentle flavor of the sea robed in a citrus gel that brightens the palate after each bite.

Large plates include an outstanding breast of duck.  Pan roasted perfectly rare, all fat rendered, deep flavor, pronounced mineral flavor, the very essence of duck.  Served with the classic sauce Bigarade (classic French sweet sour sauce of bitter orange) that truly elevates the characteristic flavor of duck. The dish is perfectly balanced.  Not to be out shown, the John Dory.  The fish, perfectly cooked.  Firm but moist.  A complex sauce brings richness to the dish.  

Service is relaxed, friendly, but proper.

Exceptional wine list with over 1,400 selections.  There is something for everyone at every price point.  Some vintage depth.  High Vegas resort prices.

Tip:  Be sure to visit the restaurant's lounge (Skyfall) for a nightcap and even more stunning views of the Vegas Strip.

5115083,2018-04-23,1,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Wow.....wow, wow, wow Rivea. What an incredible experience. We had such a beautiful, romantic evening at this lovely restaurant, and I wouldn't hesitate one beat about going back. 

After several days of a family vacation, my spouse and I took one night at the Mandalay Bay to enjoy a more intimate evening together. We were trying to find a romantic restaurant but, as was common regardless of price range in Vegas, we had trouble finding a spot with any vegetarian options. Then popped up Rivea in our search. The menu looked diverse and interesting, so I was interested. At first we were confused that there was no way to reserve online, but then we figured out that we needed to go up to the main desk of the Delano resort, where they happily took our reservation for that Sunday evening. 

For such an event, we couldn't help dressing up to the nines to have a little fun. And as a reward from the universe, we somehow managed to snag a table out on the patio with an incredible view of the Strip. What a wonderful opportunity on our last night in Vegas to sit above the city and witness all the excitement that we had been experiencing over the past several days. Our waiter was incredibly sweet and friendly, with a playful and kind personality. He was so attentive, fun, and thoughtful with us throughout the evening, helping me navigate the menu as a vegetarian and giving us wonderful suggestions for dishes to try. 

From the very beginning, the meal is a unique treat. They brought us a variety of breadsticks and sliced bread with olive oil that were both delicious and welcomed after a long day of running around the city. They even refilled our bread basket later in the evening when we used the first batch to pair with our dishes. We ordered some drinks, and my Dust Storm was, in all seriousness, one of the best cocktails that I've ever tasted in my life. So good, in fact, that I ordered a second one, even though I usually like to try different options if I order a second drink during a meal. We then tried a variety of the savory dishes from on and off the menu. I started with a beautiful butternut squash soup, which had great flavor and velvety texture. My spouse ordered a seafood dish that he very much enjoyed, and we shared an order of the crispy socca, which are these chickpea wafers that had a delightfully delicate texture. Our next set of plates were the provencal caponata - an eggplant dish similar to ratatouille that was the perfect combination of fresh and savory with a great tomato punch - and an off-the-menu recommendation from our waiter, which was a delicious, creamy asparagus risotto. For our final plate, we shared a sage gnocchi in a butter-based sauce that melted in my mouth, which were pillowy soft with a delicate flavor and light as air. 

Every bite of every dish was an adventure in flavor. It was such a joy to be able to enjoy such a beautiful and sophisticated meal on our last night in Vegas, especially since as a vegetarian it is difficult to find food that is actually thoughtful and planned ahead for our enjoyment. Rivea delivered that thoughtful meal on every level. Between the excellent service and the delicious food, we could not have picked a better location for our final dinner in Vegas.",9sAAD4WNzKcPZ02bkKv39w,2,1,5,W0GQyLvG4Xhmd6RGp6z4-w

As for the food. The highlights were the main dishes. My duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce had great flavor. My husband loved his bison steak with peppercorn sauce. The appetizers were the only thing slightly lacking. We had the grilled octopus salad which was just ok. The cured meat platter was tasty but the bread it was paired with overwhelmed the meat. Maybe better paired with crisps or crackers. Ending with their dome dessert (can't remember the name) was the best choice. It was a light and amazing.

And the food...Mmmmm. We ordered the exquisite Foie Gras Torchon, (best ever,) Octopus Bean Salad, (we have never had such tender octopus before,) and Chickpea Crepes, (as a gluten free base for the foie gras to be enjoyed by all.) The Tomato Burrata salad was impossibly delicious, given tomatoes are not in season, and served in a coupe glass generous enough for all six of us to have a taste. A Filet Mignon/Seared Foie Gras/Mashed Potato special with truffle sauce was roundly applauded... and we admit the mashed potatoes are to die for. We also ordered sides of their Sweet Corn and Sauteed Broccolini, both of which are delicious. I think next time we might order several entrees and sides and enjoy family style, because every dish was lovely and uncomplicated, (with the exception of a decidedly unexciting Bernaise Sauce on my shared NY Steak-- acceptable but really not so great, both the steak and the sauce.)

Located high above The Delano, the Skyfall Lounge next door as popular as ever with tourists even though searing hot temperatures kept the patio closed until several hours after dark, it was by way of the externally facing glass elevator guests entered the space only to have to pass by the kitchen and chandelier of bubbles en route to the hostess stand, a reservation confirmed and seats at one of the tables looking straight out onto the city a comfortable place to spend nearly three hours in repast.

Busy for Bastille Day, though the style of French served at Rivea is hardly the braised Meats and rich Sauces typically thought by most as typifying the country's cuisine, it was shortly after sitting down that a glass of Champagne was presented along with the restaurant's Grissini and Olive-Anchovy Tapenade, a trio of Breads served with Olive Oil not far behind alongside a nightly amuse of Watermelon Gazpacho poured tableside over chilled Cantaloupe with a subtle bit of heat.

Remaining one of Las Vegas' most  breezy dining rooms, the seaside blues and high ceilings further opening up a contiguous space that sees the Valley spread in all directions through glass, Rivea's current ""Tour de la Riviera"" tasting soon continued by way of a trio of plates including Seabass Crudo with Citrus and Pimento Pepper alongside chunky Eggplant Caponata and Chickpea Fries plus an added plate of tender Octopus served with crispy Garbanzo Beans and aerated Hummus, the flavors all bright and fresh though the Panisse would have benefitted from a dipping Sauce or something to help give it an identity outside of the Salt atop its crunchy coating.

Moving next into a Pasta duo, each served family-style with the Risotto perfectly cooked in Shellfish Stock and a small bit of Butter-poached Lobster at its center, Chef Riou showed a skilled hand by way of the al dente tubes served in Sauce Bordelaise, the Short Rib fork-tender with a great depth of flavor and roasted Tomatoes adding just enough acid to keep the beautifully executed sauce from being too rich at such an early point in the evening.

 Serving relatively small portions of each plate as part of the tasting, slightly larger presentations available a la carte as noted at surrounding tables, course three of the tasting was titled ""Fish"" and although those averse to flavors of the sea may wish to think twice about John Dory served a la briny Bouillabaisse the dish is true to its description with a jumbo Prawn served amidst Calamari and Clams plus buttered Toast while the Wild Halibut sings of Summer with a lightly saline Foam, two types of Asparagus and slices of Zucchini.

Requesting one of Ducasse's signature Cookpots as well as a side of Creamed Corn with Peppers be added, the former served in the style of Ratatouille along with the Fish while the latter came as a side to a medium-rare Filet of Prime Beef with Foie Gras and Australian Black Truffle Sauce, those expecting a French Classic on Bastille Day would not be let down by Angus so tender that it could have been cut with a butter knife, the Duck Liver caramelized on the surface and creamy within while the Mashed Potatoes and gently warmed Endive were just enough to refresh the palate between bites.

Taking Coffee along with Dessert, two seasonal additions presented along with a pair of classics, suffice it to say that the Citrus Cup rang true to its name with mouth-puckering combination of Rind and Marmalade that ate somewhat like a Pudding, the flavors too intense for one at the table while the Peach Melba offered a more mild flavor, Chef Ducasse's famous Baba just as wonderful with Italy's famous Lemon Liqueur as it is with Rum while the Chocolate Souffle proves worth the 18-minute preparation time thanks to a good rise and soft center that becomes a warm Pudding with the addition of Vanilla Ice Cream.

**** Without a doubt the lightest flavors of Sin City's four French Masters, the price-point on par with Twist and quite a bit lower than Savoy or Robuchon, Rivea seems to have found its stride as year three approaches, the food matching the room and Chef Riou executing every plate expertly while the staff manages a balance of personality and professionalism that many guests who fear French Restaurants as 'snooty' will be comfortable with.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,6,4,ywpTVqkG1a-SpsIN-PImqA
5347133,2016-04-11,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"The walk to Rivea from Mandalay Bay is nice, as you get a view of the Delano lobby. I went to Rivea with a large group of 15 people and was able to get a table at 8pm, which is great for Las Vegas. Our server was attentive and seemed knowledgeable of the food. I will say that our server and his manager knew relatively nothing about the wine list so it was difficult to determine what bottles we wanted to order. The small plates are fantastic. We had an argula and cured ham pizza and chickpea fries that were to die for. The bread basket is also pretty impressive.

We all ordered different dishes for our main course. I had two more small plates for dinner, including the mozzarella di bufala and tomato and the sage/parmesan cheese potato gnocchi. 
Both were fresh and cleanly executed. While the table was generally satisfied with their meals, I will say that our server's apparent knowledge of the menu was contradicted by what we actually received, in that many of the dishes were not what he described. 

The best part of Rivea, however, is the outdoor patio areas: one smoking and one non-smoking. The view of the strip is insane from Rivea's 64th floor vantage point. I'd be interested in going back with a smaller group and eating outside. Overall, I felt the bill was rather pricey for the overall experience but the view was an added bonus.",YNkbvkPhLMFlOFYH2PLMwA,0,0,3,rgdal8oQg0HcNQ8n4ol8zw

We sat outside with Mike as our server. He was very personable. Mike made some great recommendations. He made us feel comfortable and like we were talking to a long lost friend who had been coming here for years and knew what to order. Carlos, our busperson. What a nice guy! Always had a smile on his face. Very attentive without being overbearing. He knew when to come to the table and when not to. The Tiramisu was delish. Only thing it needed was a dash of sea salt. I put some on and it came to life. 

Our only downside was the concierge at Delano. I spoke to two of them about my husband being diabetic and if they could get something he could eat that had the carb count on it. It seemed like I was totally ignored. I checked this morning and nothing had been done. I asked again this morning and nothing was done.

5628631,2016-03-28,0,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"Very nice experience overall.  I really like the tapas style menu.  We got 3-4 small plates, and split 2 entrees (4 people), and that was plenty of food, and the cost was certainly not bad when doing this way as well.  The menu recommends 3-4 small plates per person, however this would be way too much food.

Food was completely excellent.  The filet entree, and mushroom risotto were two standouts.

Our waiter was also very accommodating, as we had someone gluten free, and he made it easy.   View is wonderful, but not as nice as the Skyfall lounge next door.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars, is the French bread was just okay, and this is very important to me in a French restaurant.  Also, it really rubbed me the wrong way when the server asked if we preferred still or sparkling water, and ice water was not offered as an option.  Finally, I ordered a martini, and it came in a small after dinner liquor style glass - about half the portion of a normal martini, but of course the price did not indicate this smaller portion.",Y0qhtu7hHefyYctCLpExTA,1,0,4,B_4rd4N3ftaAP1TCHt6Ysg

I would have to say the seabass was my favorite, but all were super good. My main course was the lamb chops. I have to say the best I've ever had without a doubt. My husband had the bison tenderloin and he loved it. Do I have to report a negative thing? I can't think of one. I guess I didn't care too much for bread? Attaching the photos just makes me remember how great everything was. You can't go wrong. We also had a few desserts, since it was my birthday. Im really no help cause they were all great. My beat advice for you is order whatever you want cause regardless it's going to be good, or better yet order everything. 

Our server was Bianca. You have to ask for her. She gave me what I wanted even before I knew I wanted it. So sweet and nice and very attentive but not hovering. She recommend a cocktail that was soooo good. Can't remember the name but it's the first one listed on their ""speciality cocktails.""

5745113,2017-10-16,1,HojKatUfX4UHWaPqtl63NQ,"The location and view of this restaurant is a hidden gem.  If you're looking for a romantic spot, I highly recommend coming here...for a drink. 

We came on a Sunday.  It took awhile to be greeted.. I would say about 15 minutes.  We ended up asking a busser for some menus.  Shortly after our server came, which you could tell he was overwhelmed.  Apologized for the wait, and went over the ""specials."" We immediately put in an appetizer order, because at this point we had now been in the restaurant for a total of 30 minutes and our drink order hadn't been placed. Our appetizer came out in about 20 minutes, before our bottle of wine was delivered....... great start.  But It gets better. 

The wine we ordered was all out (shocker), so it put another 10 minute hold to get another one to us.  By the time we get our wine bottle our food was delivered shortly after... perfect.  

Now the most important part of this review is to note that the food was such a let down.  My 46$ halibut plate was a disappointment.  Not only was the halibut a solid 3 (on a scale from 1-10), but it didn't even come with a side!  My boyfriend ordered the prime rib special and wasn't impressed at all.  The waiter felt bad about the long wait for everything and comped our ""desert"" which was the tiramisu.  Even that was mediocre.  

Such a let down when you spend $200 on food and walk away still hungry and not satisfied.  Terrible food, great view, and like I mentioned earlier.. come for drinks and drinks only.",ie9WxbC4xDrj-KKJXkzWVg,1,0,2,EsYlzYYekQ0xjO7NBs6Wdw

Cooked is overwheming. The steak was way over filled with truffle. The smell, taste, started to make me sick after one solid bite of steak. Absolutely horrible. I pushed the steak aside and the tablebacks, grabbed my plate without asking or noticing the steak was 7/8 left on the plate. The cost for this dinner was $800 for two NYE. The attitude was ""we will refund a glass of champagne"".
I felt robbed.
I was called and offered dinner again at Rivera. I live in Ca. Im not going back to Vegas anytime soon and moreover, I definitely not going back to Rivera and risking another $800.

First of all, the environment, is incredibly beautiful, and someohow, the coolest vibe ever.  The lighiting is just right, the views of the city stunning.  It always makes me feel like I've stepped into a James Bond movie.  The service is as good as it gets - from the hostess, the bussers, and of course the servers - all supremely professional and engaging.  I noticed there was a manager on the floor the whole time we were there, making sure everything ran smoothly, and it does.  And, of course the food - everything I've tried, on my 3 visits here has been excellent.  This past time was pasta with short ribs, and a baked vegetable dish.  Apple tart for dessert was one of the best desserts I've ever had.  What is really surprising is the price point for the quality of food and setting - it's surprisingly reasonable.  That is the topper for Rivea  - it is everything you could wish for in high-end restaurant, and does not hammer your wallet, although you could spend if you wanted - the wine list is extensive with a big selection of pricey bottles, but also some affordable selections.  I love everything about this place - it's our go-to for a special dinner.  Great spot for a romantic evening for two, or for a group.",9dwWqolvlzaG60HP2GlooQ,0,0,5,LMcFk_aQ3qzUHmcJMI1Cfw
