I also like the tacos,  although they arent AUTHENTIC tacos. Obviously. The only thing i do not reccomend are the fucking nuggets man. They taste good at first but leave my insides rotten.... no other fucking food in the world but those nuggets. Otherwise, good.",UcD5WhK-FW_KTPysnMIagA,0,0,3,4ptplGhSFrm6k4LCDA9FKg

This is the closest late night restaurant by my house (besides dulce doughnuts) so I end up going here more than I should sadly. Anyways the place is usually clean and the customers are usually some what normal. At times you can get a weird crowd but mainly kids from the high school or families dining in. Recently I got coupons for a free pita so I decided to give it another shot. The pita was actually delicious, I was surprised. I enjoyed it and actually thought about getting another but I was lucky on this time around. This place is clean and the staff are quite friendly but Jack in the Box can cause some serious problems internally to you. To be honest, I only enjoy the breakfast sandwich, platter, the munchies menu and now the pita. Stay away from the tacos and 1$ chicken sandwich. Best of luck.",Y1sX-m_nxlD8-YeYvIsqcQ,0,0,3,tlfk0jnxFabhY9eGGOXYZA

I can understand when the drive thru gets busy it can be overwhelming but you don't have to be a JERK. If you don't like your job drive thru fast food guY.....get another job!

I'm waiting at the intercom.....window down...no music on. I nerve heard a work until I hear someone say "" are you ready to order for what?"" ...... I said "" excuse me""? ......JOSE then states he has been saying hello can I help you for the ""last 2 mins"". 
I go ummm sorry I didn't anyone say anything at all, but its very rude for you to speak that way. 

He then continues to argue that he knows I heard him. And I asked to speak with a manager so I can put my order in because I'm not gonna argue with him. 

He says have a nice day and you don't have to order. 

By this time I'm thinking what the heck is wrong with this person. 

I then say you are being very rude and I understand you're busy but that's not very professional. He then rushes me through my order. And is STILL rude when I get to the window. 

I have been a resturant server for a year now and I would NEVER make a guest ...rather drive thru or not ...feel the way Jose made me feel tonight. I'm not even gonna eat the food....he may have don't something with it....with his nasty attitude. 

Poor service ....what a shame. 


I will be calling the manager AND corporate in the morning. Just RIDICULOUS",Yi2sBdWFBdHmoPmF-3Kr2g,2,0,1,kKqmCGKipvEkfeZZHCSCfw

3085621,2016-01-21,1,EU8Hp2rTEptiwCH4eLYZBw,"This Jack In The Box is located on Washington and Decatur. I last visited this place January 6, 2016.

Atmosphere: Nothing Special
It's really the people who make up the atmosphere. The neighborhood in which this Jack In The Box is located is not necessarily the best neighborhood, so there might be some shady looking individuals on your next visit. There are plenty of places to sit, but coming in during the week day around lunch time expect this place to be a little crowded, especially since there is a high school right down the road.

Service: Good, but nothing extraordinary
I was served right away and my food came to me in a timely fashion. 

Food: No Strings Attached, Up to Par
I ordered a Sourdough Jack. Tasted like any other sour dough burger I've had from Jack In The Box. The bun was toasted, the bacon was crispy, and the burger was warm.

Overall: OK
Nothing truly memorable from my last visit other than seeing some shady customers walk in and out of the restaurant. Luckily, the staff isn't shady at all, so don't worry about your order being compromised.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,2,0,3,ny5AR5gqCljdOA9GDPzuDw

Buy one get one free 
They would only accept cash  and so I had to go to the bank 
Evelyn the manager would not accept the use of a coupon 
What a waste and an inconvenience 
They should at least give one for free and honor the coupon anyway
