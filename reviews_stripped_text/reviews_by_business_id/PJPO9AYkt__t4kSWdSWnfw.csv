Had the Philly cheesesteak. It was really awesome. Perfectly cooked. Today I had a Ruben sandwich which was also very good. Well trimmed, so not fatty. My only complaint is it seems a bit pricey. $17 for  lunch without a server.  But the food is really good. So...  I guess I'll pay!",itq2rZhg9VmQCCibeLdGSg,1,0,4,pumVeeycyzrT6hcXHloVRw

We didn't know where the silverware and napkins were so when they dropped of our food, we asked for utensils. She said, ""they are on the counter."" and left. They dropped of my dad's pancakes without any butter. The bussers were extremely rude. As we were standing up to leave, I was gathering my baby's things, the busser asked us to move so he could clear the table. I understand needing the table, but they couldn't wait the 30 second for us to leave. The food is incredibly bland, and I ordered chorizo, an item that is typically full of flavor. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, the country gravy tasted like flour. My mom had the avocado omelet. The avocado was still hard since it wasn't ripe enough. My sister ordered an omelet that came with a side salad. That ""salad"" consisted of no more than 7 leaves and no dressing (see photos). I literally laughed. It looked like an incomplete garnish. Definitely pass on this one.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,0,0,1,2dF-4Bvi3oVz7yiq0QaShQ

First, they only had one person working the register while 6 people randomly acted busy behind him. The line built up and took forever while the 6 other staff did menial tasks like put ice cubes in the sink. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, they somehow lost our order. It took another 30 minutes for them to deliver any food. The help eventually came over to tell us they were going to put a rush order on our food but it still took them another 15 minutes after that. For our trouble, they offered us a free pastry, which nobody wanted. Eventually we just left and never received half of our order.

I saw that some items on the menu could be made vegan upon request. I ordered the tomato basil soup which came with a grilled cheese - all vegan. We also ordered a falafel sandwich. When the soup and grilled cheese arrived, the grilled cheese looked a little suspicious. I asked if it was vegan, and the woman said no, they don't have vegan cheese. They had no answer when we asked why a non-vegan side would come with a vegan item on the menu. Instead of rectifying their own mistake, we were offered two toothpicks with three small pieces of fruit. The manager said that's ""the best"" he could do.

Amber at the front is always super nice, and Chris one of the managers is really attentive every time I have ever asked for anything. 

My favorite healthy option is the Tree Hugger, with a secret hack to add chicken. The Tree Hugger is a quinoa patty sandwich with a great spicy aioli. The added chicken completes the meal, as I always want a protein.

They have outdoor seating but no awning or umbrellas to help give you a bit of shade. Since nothing on their breakfast menu was appealing to me, I ordered the vegan falafal and my partner ordered the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast. He said that his breakfast was ok, but nothing he would order again. My falafal on the other hand was absolutely delicious. The falafals were very flavorful and I loved the light basalmic tahini sauce, it was just right and did not overpower the falafal, it comes served on a bed of mixed greens in a wrap of soft bread.

491184,2014-12-01,1,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.  

We went for ""brunch"".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.

The food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with ""corned buffalo""... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.  

The service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls). 

A few things of note: 
- 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.  

- They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.

- Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, ""fine, I'll pay for it""... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice ""got it, charge me"".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier ""I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee""... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.  
 
It was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.

The menu looks interesting on line and even sounds good but this was by far the blandest food I and my mom have ever had. It's as if the cook didn't realize you do need to use some sort of salt on the food to make it tasty.

My mom got the bob chicken sandwich and for 12 bucks they really need to rethink serving it on just regular old wheat bread. Mom said it was just ""okay"" but would not get it again IF we came back. 

I had the hangover burger which is supposed to be an 8 ounce triple angus burger with bacon,fried egg,cheddar cheese and special sauce. This burger lacked any flavor at all. It was smaller the the bun it was on,the bacon was over cooked ,the ""cheddar cheese"" not sure if it was on the burger or not.  The fried egg was cooked correctly but again someone needs to tell the cook salt and pepper are okay to add when cooking. In fact I wonder if the burger was even angus because it was bland and sad looking in color. At 14 bucks I expect much more.

I could have gone to McDonald's for the third of the price and had a better meal.

The young man working as cashier,server and general cleaning person for the place wasn't overly friendly but he wasn't rude either. He did however leave our food sit in the window while he wiped down the coke machine and the counters.

1121576,2015-06-26,2,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"Have been to MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin a few times now. 

Sometimes it was good (the clam chowder) and sometimes not so much. About one week ago I decided to try the Chicken Pot Pie as it's one of their signature dishes and I had seen the reviews on Yelp. 

This dish was a deal breaker in that I won't be returning to this place ever again. 

Presentation is cute, comes in a little skillet with biscuits. The chicken was flavorless and tough. I had to add a ton of salt just to have some sort of seasoning. The biscuits were so hard I had to use a knife to cut through them (think hockey puck) and then the taste was like cardboard (think cardboard). As I'm trying to navigate some flavor out of this dish, I happen upon a chicken bone, and I mean a large bone. 

The waitress comes over, asks how the meal is, so I point to the bone and tell her (nicely) I don't think I would order this again and give her the particulars as stated earlier. She was nice and apologetic but nothing more. No manager was asked to come, she just trotted off like, ""oh well, thanks for coming in"", and left me. 

So here I am staring down at my chicken bone, served with dried out hockey puck biscuits covering a tasteless goo of tough chicken and wondering, why I was paying $15 for this meal?

There are waaay to many options in this town to get great food so I'll be checking MTO off my list as one.",FgpEsFKtv765Q50w9OtpTg,4,2,1,kssMBdRBOk2yhCqg9ipBVw

My friend was told hers was coming several times before someone came over and asked her what she ordered- at which point she canceled her order. It was ridiculous. There was a family of 5 sitting near us who also had to cancel their order after waiting just as long without food. Not one person who worked there offered a pastry, anything from the bakery cabinet while several customers (kids included) were hungry and waiting. My friend did ask for some fries- and cold ones were brought to her. The staff did apologize for the mess and even had to close the kitchen- turning away several customers (we witnessed this).

Nestled in the beautiful Downtown Summerlin, we were thrilled to find this delicious restaurant/take-out style café where you don't have to wait for table service, yet get to sit back and enjoy an awesome (comfort) meal.

My fiancé raves about the BLTAE (Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado Egg) Sandwich. It's a huge portion with a heaping side of fries and well worth it's price tag. That alone lures him back twice a month (at least).

I, myself, first indulged in the Strawberry and Spinach Salad with Gorgonzola and a Balsamic dressing. That was delicious. Next I tried the Turkey Melt, and melt in my mouth, it did. So many awesome flavors in one bite - I don't know how they do it. Everything from the dressings to the toasting of the bread is perfectly mouthwatering. 

I've also tried The Bob, which was fantastic. Sometimes they include these roasted cherry tomatoes, which are difficult to chew, but taste fantastic. 

As for the service, we are always always greeted with a super friendly clerk who takes the order, delivers the food, and clears the table. They are even friendly enough to make suggestions on the menu and wait patiently while I indecisively try to order. We've never gone at a time where there's a line or crowd, so I suppose dinner isn't their busiest hour. Nevertheless, we always leave stuffed and so satisfied at the delicious crafting of foods here.

I'll have to start off by saying it sucks for MTO (or any business) to have to deal with getting 3 stars or less from people who do not know how restaurants work, oh and the ones who can't cook to save their own lives, oh and definitely the ones who all they know is Chili's and that $6.99 prime rib dinner at the Cannery!! Then they get on sites like Yelp and speak like they know what they are talking about... People! People! .... Stop wasting everyone's time by giving businesses 2 stars because it was too packed and you had to wait longer! What do you want these places to do, something is obviously going right if the place is packed! Or giving them 3 stars because the food was good, but they got your order wrong the first time and that pissed you off but you didn't say anything when that restaurant sends out a free dessert item! You people are annoying, lame, and disgruntled.

Anyway sorry I had to take away from MTO's positives!! The food was great. The atmosphere was great, the options of food were just right (I hate restaurants with a thousand items on it, you know everything on it can't be fresh), and definitely the service I really liked and received from the staff!

1571010,2014-12-31,2,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. 

I can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.

Bacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this. 

Fried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs ""over medium"" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger. 

Tillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.

Special sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.

Fries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.

Hamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.

On the plate, there were also two kinds of ""pickles"". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.

It's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,3,1,2,lXZ5KTgV6kcTTG2UjzeuLw

1701383,2014-12-28,7,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- décor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.

Menu has several breakfast choices, of which I am not a fan. The soups and salads are all solid, but the sandwiches are hit or miss- please note that the Philly comes with Velveeta, which will put off many people (myself included). The Hero is delectable and a generous portion, too. The same can be said for the sea salt fries it is served with- the kitchen is a bit heavy-handed with the salt flakes, and despite the presence of Cholula at the condiment bar, I had to ask staff for ketchup. Who had to ask the chef to bring out a ramekin from the kitchen. For KETCHUP. At a place that serves FRIES. Found this incredibly odd and awkward.

The 5 cheese macaroni is one of the best I've had with a good, thick roux and curly cavatappi noodles. However, for a $7 side it's practically an entree it's so rich. Recommend cutting the portion and price to make it a side, and maybe offering an additional $9 portion as an entrée, perhaps with a protein.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,3,9htRtINrd-XRbPbIyhVxlQ

With our yelp checkin we received a free chocolate chip cookie but unfortunately it was burnt and too hard around the edges. I still appreciate the freebie.

And with decent size crowd, the noise level is very very loud. They serve the food on real China, a very nice touch considering how informal the restaurant is.
Service: the staff we're all very pleasant and seem to be genuinely happy working there. The food was brought out in the appropriate amount of time. A staff member came and cleared the table when we were done eating.
Food: the Reuben sandwich was fairly light on the corned beef. I know that there was melted Swiss cheese in the sandwich because I saw it. However there was so little that you could not taste it. There was ample sauerkraut relative to the amount of meat. However , it was put on in such a way that it soaked the bottom piece of bread. Overall, a very disappointing Reuben sandwich. Especially at that price point. The kids got grilled cheese. I got to taste their leftovers. That was actually quite good for a kids grilled cheese sandwich (only $5 - quite reasonable). 
Value: for a very informal fast food breakfast and lunch eatery , it was okay. However I feel that he was somewhat pricey for what you get. I won't be going back.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,1,1,3,ePMbLjTyZuBo1rnvryYUJg

While the sandwich itself was delicious and the open faced presentation lovely, it was quite difficult to eat. It would have been much better had the sandwich not been served open faced. Putting the sandwich together was messy and because the plates have no rims/lips, the egg yolk leaked off the plate and onto the table.

The cafe is order first, then sit. My boyfriend and I arrived at 1pm on a Saturday and found sitting no problem (luckily spaces were available after we ordered). They serve breakfast all day and that's what we both opted for.  I was craving pancakes but I can't fathom spending $14 on speciality pancakes with no sides included. Instead I ordered a veggie skillet with no mushrooms for $11 (I think) and my boyfriend got the MTO breakfast (meat and hash browns, which MTO calls mash browns) for $14. We both got iced coffees for $3 each. 

The food looked delicious and it was tasty! Their spam (part of the MTO breakfast) was cooked to perfection.  There was plenty of food to share. Their mashbrowns are a little soft (but I prefer crispier hash browns). I enjoyed my veggie skillet. I wish the potatoes were softer but that didn't stop me from eating everything!

Looking at the other food people ordered, their pancakes looked aesthetically pleasing and their sandwich bread looked buttered and toasted to make a perfect crunch. Next time I return I might opt for a sandwich!

Secondly, she ended up only eating the steak because the rice was swimming, literally swimming in teriyaki sauce. It was like teriyaki soup with rice. My mom not wanting to complain too much didn't mention it to me until we were all done and she had finished most of the steak. So she went to the counter just to tell them hat they messed up the order, not asking for anything in return but just to make them aware of the type of dishes they are serving.

They made that up by giving him a side of fries but the fries he was given looked like the bottom of the fryer fries, all scrape pieces and over cooked.

A completely different experience than I had last time although my friend says the other location is waaaay better. 

My friend says eggs are organic. Did not hear that from the staff do please double check. 
The hash browns are their signature potatoes & they were unusual & unexpected. It seems like they are hash brown potatoes wrapped around mashed potatoes.  Very unusual. I had to kind of taste it a few time. I Liked It. Very different, try them. 

The eggs were absolutely perfectly cooked! Over medium & they were exactly that. 

The meats on my special were assorted. I am not a spam fan so that went to waste. 

I wish they had an option for the bread. I skipped it as did my friends. So we paid for it & got no other choice. I think this could be improved on. 

The bacon was crispy & tasted great. 

I got some kind of a chocolate or carib drink that was very good.  

It is a menu that could be better understood with photos. For a new person like me, it is off putting.  I hope they add a photo menu or iPad or screen or something to help new people order.

I waited impatiently in line for about 7 minutes before I could order which I think was a bit long, there were only two in front of me. I ordered the Turkey Melt along with their New England clam chowder, with a cup for water. I paid via their tablet system with a credit card, using my finger to sign. The cashier gave me a number to place on my table so they would know where to bring the food. 

This place is unique in that other then the staff bringing your food you do all the work. From getting the utensils and napkins to even getting the condiments up front by the register. I honestly don't mind this approach as 1 it's less to worry about them screwing something up and 2 there is not spot to tip on the bill! Only a tip jar. They must pay their employees handsomely. 

The ambience seemed busy as it was crowded but definitely welcoming with its random art and warm color tones. They even have USB ports by their seats in case you need to charge up. The Clam Chowder was awesome, had bacon bits in it, which they told me about beforehand. The turkey melt was equally amazing, although I feel they skimped on the cheese, also not to crazy about stringy fries but that's just a personal preference. 

So aside from the wait, stringy fries, and lack of enough cheese in my sandwich I'd say for sure we'll be coming back again as my complaints aren't that dire.",A8TRpa--43-mbig73xfhrA,23,15,4,d9KIUEAo1FPeEPHtFryLqg

After browsing the menu trying to decide on breakfast or lunch items, I decided on that would satisfy both cravings. The BLTAE won the battle.  Thick grilled white bread served open face and slathered with mayo and topped with shredded iceberg, Roma tomatos, thick cut Applewood bacon and two perfectly cooked Sunnyside up eggs.  This item is located in the sandwich section but this job requires a knife a fork. Great menu item and very satisfying.  Shoestring fries served on side were also very good.  If I would change one thing about this dish it would be the lettuce. Maybe serve with piece of iceberg or step up to romaine or spring mix. Either would work.

We also had the Lemon Poppy seed pancakes with ginger blueberry compote. Yumm!.  I loved the tartness of the lemon throughout the pancakes. Balanced out by the sweetness of the blueberry topping. Another great dish.

We were greeted from the moment we entered the door! It's a small, but nice and clean, dining area. You order and pay at the counter and then grab a seat and they will bring your order to you.

(+) friendly service from the time we walked through the door until the moment we left! 
(+) cafe was very clean and well organized. tables were cleaned and bussed in a fast and efficient fashion. 
(+) food was very tasty and quite filling! steak was nice and tender and among the better cafe steaks I have had recently. actually everything tasted great and was well cooked with the exception of the toast, which was a bit burnt. no biggie though.
(+) I do love those soda machines where you are able to mix and match sodas and flavoring, much like in some movie theaters!

(-) the only real knock on this place is that it is a tad bit pricey. $3.00 for a fountain soda is  bit high. 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $35.69 before tip. 

I enjoyed my first visit to the MTO cafe! At this price point it will probably be an ""every now and then"" option, but I am almost certain we will be back to try some other menu items!

After yoga, we had to eat something before our next class in a day that we opted for a double...so my love and I stopped in to MTO Cafe around 3:30 in the afternoon.  Not many tables were occupied and the overall setting was clean. We were greeted with a warm smile, and proceeded to order a Quinoa Crunch Salad and a Vegan Falafel Wrap.   

We helped ourselves to glasses of water from the self-service soft drink station and waited...watied...and waited a little more. I could sense the frustration from the other patrons who ordered before us wondering where the food was. The server kindly went around to apologize for the delay and discretely explained to us that they were short on kitchen staff at that moment. So, it took much longer to get orders ready, but once we had our food...the result was a couple of happy campers on our end.

The Quinoa Crunch Salad came with quinoa, broccoli, zucchini, avocado, arugula, edamame hummus, chipotle vinaigrette, and hot sauce at $9...simple and fresh ingredients with light dressing. The Vegan Flafel was made with chick peas, tomato, lettus, onion, balsamic tahini on unleavened bread with a simple green salad...this one was so delicious that if we weren't sharing, I could have eaten it all. The falafel was still warm, and wrapped-up compact with all so much deliciousness to make me forget how long we had to wait....the balsamic tahini has just the right amount of sweetness and bite.

I am optimistically sure that MTO Cafe runs more smoothly on a regular basis...I would love to come back to try other offerings. If they make me wait that long for food again though, It may be the last time.

I really liked it - I thought the food was delicious and I really like that it's walk up rather than table service. It's nice if you're not feeling like cooking breakfast at home, but you also don't want to wait for service all morning on a busy Sunday at a restaurant. 

We ordered the waffle with seasonal berries and vanilla whipped cream. The waffle was perfect, with fresh strawberries and blueberries, and I loved their house-made whipped cream! My husband had the tri-tip with eggs and their ""hash mash"", which is hash browns with mashed potatoes in the middle, and yes, it's absolutely as delicious as it sounds. He thought it was good but thought the portion was small for the price. I sneaked a few bites and thought it was super tasty! Apparently they used to use a dry espresso rub for the tri-tip but they don't anymore - kind of a bummer, would have loved to try that! Last note, the coffee was good which always makes or breaks a good spot for me. We had a good experience here this morning and will definitely be back!

So I took it back to MTO Cafe (luckily, we're only about 5-7 minutes away) and upon explaining the situation to the manager, she promptly said, ""I want to make this right; is it alright if I get a new salad made for you and refund you for the first one?""  I wasn't expecting the refund and was taken aback at that and she said that she felt bad that I drove home and had to drive back.  We walked over to the register where a gentleman helped me with the refund and explained to me that the salad had dressing and an aioli.

I just wanted something light and not too expensive, but since we already there, I figured why not just try it. I figured with that price, I'm sure it was going to be a big portion. 

We ordered two lemon cilantro chicken salad ($12.00) and spicy chicken sandwich ($13.00). Both were okay, nothing different. I'm sure you can find something way less than the menu price elsewhere.

Steak and eggs : 
Came with 3 eggs, hashbrowns, steak, your choice of toast, and choice of avocado (half or whole).
Steak was delicious-- tender. Eggs were cooked perfect. The hash browns were buttery. So good.

K F C :
Fried chicken, mash potatoes, a delicious gravy with a touch of sweetness which actually was amazing with the fried chicken. Ordered it with a side of avocado.  

It was gorgeous outside today so we had lunch outside.  It was perfect.  

Dale! Our guy who actually recommended these plates to us as we were ordering was very pleasant, informative, friendly, kind and attentive.  From taking our order to attending us at our table.  Was a pleasant visit at MTO.  It's a happy vibe at MTO.  Love it.

Their version of Kentucky fried chicken ($13) is similar in name only to the fast food spot with the same name. The chicken here has a thick, well seasoned crust that virtually cracks open. With two eggs over easy, mash browns, and country gravy, this is one of the better breakfast dishes around. Other breakfast dishes are well crafted, like the chorizo skillet and you can't go wrong with the bacon dippers --strips of bacon covered in pancake batter.

The juicy patty and the salty and sharp blue cheese in the black and bleu burger ($13) make a for a great combo. But, you'll need plenty of napkins while eating it. Save some of those napkins for the chicken in a waffle ($13) too. Covered in country gravy along with maple syrup it can be messy but delicious. Their version of chicken pot pie ($15) uses biscuits instead of a typical pastry crust topping, but flavors come through, just the same. It's creamy and packed with pulled chicken, although it could have benefitted from more vegetables.

I have read a lot about how good MTO's lemon poppy seed pancakes are and I will say they did not live up to their hype. I could not taste any lemon. They just tasted like plain pancakes (like boring ones without buttermilk) with poppy seeds sprinkled in the batter. The blueberry syrup was good but I could hardly taste the ginger. The pancakes were also really chewy to the point where I could not cut them with the side of my fork and had a difficult time cutting it with the butter knife they gave me. I would not order these again. 
My husband had the spicy chicken sandwich and he liked it this time. We have gotten it before and it had little to no flavor (hmm shocker there!). From my experience, the sandwiches are usually good here. 
The staff is always friendly. The greet you promptly as you enter the restaurant and are quick to answer any questions and offer suggestions. But be warned, this is not a quick service restaurant though it may look like one. It does take a while to get your food because everything seems to be made to order.

The long line gave me a chance to peruse the paper menu before I could read the menu board at the counter.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outside tables were in the shade at that time, so I was glad a table opened up inside when we were ready to sit down.

It was a nice day, but a little chilly walking around Downtown Summerlin, so it felt like a soup and sandwich day to us.  When we got to the counter, we were told that, while the menu includes both cup and bowls of soup, they did not have cups available.  Okay...so we ordered bowls.  This was definitely not a cheap lunch.  2 orders of soup, sandwiches, and sodas was $50.  

I ordered the tomato basil soup, which was hot, rich, and hearty.  It says it comes with ""cheddar toast"", which I assumed was like a crustini, but it was actually a sliver of regular grilled cheese...and it was really good.  The soup and ""toast"" was a meal, I didn't need anything else.  But on to my sandwich.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese.  Unlike the kind that came with my soup, this one consisted of brie, honey, & toasted walnuts on brioche.  I was trying something outside the box for me, but I'm not sure why I thought I would like this.  I really think this sandwich will appeal to a lot of people, but it's just not for me.  However, the side salad that came with the sandwich was Amazing.  Baby greens, roasted peppers, a fantastic balsamic.  Yum. 

The BF ordered the calm chowder and he said it was one of the best he's had in Vegas.  Both for flavor and the mass amount of actual clams in the dish.  This chowder was enough for a meal, but he has also ordered the Hero sandwich.  It has grilled chicken, prosciutto, salami, and a mix that looked just like my salad.

I was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the ""Philly"" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.

The menu describes it this way.  ""Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions.""  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.

I selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.  

The small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.  

After finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.

I can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,9,4,fP0d1U9mVwCfYdiIi9ypfQ

Their motto is simple...fresh comfort food. Their known for their Hangover Burger (its okay), the Kentucky Fried Chicken (Yum), and their Chicken Pot Pie (never tried).  I recommend the MTO Breakfast for $14.99 if you're undecided.  It's my favorite and includes 3 eggs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, real bacon (the good stuff), spam, potatoes, and your choice of bread.  When I get bored with this meal, I'll substitute the whole eggs with egg whites or pancakes instead of bread.  They can do that here because the food is MTO aka ""made to order"".  The rest of the items on their menu is good too, except the steak.  The best deal at MTO has to be their free cookie if you Check-In to Yelp. MTO is a safe bet whenever I'm hungry, craving eggs, and in Downtown Summerlin.

4304912,2015-04-20,4,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"So, my husband, daughter and I escaped out last Saturday evening for a quick bite to eat at Downtown Summerlin.  I had seen some great things about MTO Cafe on Yelp and through Instagram and suggested we give it a try as we were going for something quick and easy.  We each ordered a salad and split a side of fries(I know kind of an oxymoron, but this was concidered a cheat meal).  We decided to sit on the patio, as I always love the option to do so.  We made our way out and had a seat.

Not long after a gentleman with a very large dog seated himself behind us.  No qualms by us about the dog, but that's what initially drew my attention to the fact that we weren't lone soldiers on the patio.

We received our food, which was great(review not 100% on that).  It was from that point that I began to listen to the gentleman behind us begin to boss the friendly cashier around as to his demands of his order.  Then, something was not up to par on his order and he called for the manager on duty that evening.  He came out, also a seemingly nice young man, and he too got an earful from this guy.  

Now, never at any time, would I say this guy was yelling; but I repeatedly kept mouthing to my husband how rude this guy was behind us.  When we got up to leave, I was so curious to know about this guy as at this point I thought he couldn't have just been some customer off the street; he had to have an affiliation.  So, I walked back inside to ask the initial friendly cashier; and come to find out, he was a partner in the restaurant! 

Mr. Matt Moore, if you are reading this, it is one thing to ensure the food that is coming our of your kitchen is prepared well; I can appreciate that immensely, but it's another to demean your employees on your restaurant's patio, especially when there are customers within earshot.  I definitely see you have a lot of experience in the design and construction industry.  And, I also see you served for us; THANK YOU for that.  However, may I make a small recommendation:  Customer Service.  You built this business for a reason and are a part of it's face.  When you are part of its face, I would imagine you most certainly wouldn't want customers thinking that face is full of belittlement or superiority, but rather support and collaboration.

Today, I ordered the tomato basil soup (comes with half a grilled cheese sandwich) and wow... I devoured it. The tomato basil soup was creamy and slightly tangy and I couldn't put down my spoon. Of course, I had to dip my grilled cheese in the soup, which satisfied my taste buds. This meal was exactly what I craved. The place was pretty busy in the morning since most stores aren't open till around 11am. From the moment I came in until I left, the customer service was great. The cashier greeted me and made sure I wasn't pressured about ordering fast (they have a big menu that takes a minute to choose from). I think while I was there, the waitress asked me about 3 times how the food was, if I needed anything, or to take any plates out of the way. This is the customer service that every restaurant needs. 

However, the only thing I didn't enjoy was the cost. My tomato basil soup cost $7 for a bowl that wasn't really big. I would expect more for spending almost $10 on soup. I don't know if I'd come back on a weekly basis, but it's a good place to eat at Downtown Summerlin in the morning.

Service: What a friendly staff; they're always up to speed. When a customer leaves, the table is cleared within seconds. Everyone smiles--this is a good sign!

Food: You peruse the menu and order up front, are given a number and, then, you seat yourself. Orders come out of the kitchen pretty quickly and a majority of the menu items are a hit!

I'm not sure if the value is there though. We end up paying $30 bucks for two sandwiches which seems a bit more than your average cafe. You have the option to change your fries for salad or fruit at an additional price. I guess there is not much of an encouragement to pick healthy options. I got the simple salad and that is exactly what I got, a simple salad. Lettuce, one sun dried tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was good, but nothing crazy to it.

  MTO Cafe is in the northern reaches of Downtown Summerlin. Two sides of the cafe give the gift of interesting views of the Downtown. The east-facing windows overlook the pocket park known as the Arroyo. The south-facing windows overlook Park Centre Drive. In daylight the Arroyo-facing seats are the prime seats. At nighttime, the Park Centre Drive-facing seats are the prime seats. From this angle the changing colors of the landmark office building put you in the heart of downtown Summerlin. 

The Daniel. S-pectation:

    I expected to pay a higher price than I normally would off the Strip. I expected a full service restaurant. 

The Daniel. S Report of his MTO Cafe experience:

    My brother and I walked into a restaurant that is more similar to Five Guys (also in Downtown Summerlin). You order and pay for your food. The cashier gives you a number to place on your table with a plastic beverage cup. When the food is ready, they bring it to your table. On the way to the table is a freestyle Coke machine with over 100 flavors to choose from. 

  When we walked inside, a friendly cashier greeted us. I was still undecided. The deal is there is only one burger to choose from. It is their Hangover Burger. Hmm! Should I order the burger or the ruben. The Hangover Burger includes an 8 ounce triple angus with bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, lettuce, special sauce and fries on the side ($13). I was so not up to a fried egg with the burger. ""Could I order mushrooms in place of the fried egg?,"" I asked the friendly cashier. She communicated this with her supervisor (believe he is the owner). The answer was, ""yes."" My brother wasn't really gung-ho over a fried egg over the burger. They likewise bestowed his request. 

   The delay time between ordering and seeing the food was short and enjoyable. My eyes took in the nighttime streetscape of Downtown Summerlin with the changing colors of the landmark office building. Looking up my eyes saw the game playing on the TV Between conversations with my brother, my ears took in the dance mixes featuring the late Michael Jackson. 

  When they placed the food on the table, I did the Yelper ceremony of photographing my food. This picture shows a patty with a lot of lettuce alongside skinny fries with a cow dispenser in the background. The picture failed to capture the juicy angus beef, mushrooms, Tillamook cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. My sense of taste appreciated the flavorful burger where it was indifferent to the ordinary skinny fries. 

  My brother wasn't the only friendly person in my company. The friendly staff would consistently checkup on us. The Manager or Owner also checked up on us. Kudos to the flavorful customer service at MTO Cafe. 

  MTO Cafe is in a downtown that appears to shutdown between 9 and 10 pm on a Saturday night in the Holidays season. My brother and I were here up to the time that that they closed at 9 pm. 

The Daniel. S  No-Spin Zone:

    I walked away from my MTO Experience giving it a grade if 80% (3 stars). Here are my constructive criticism points. The price is to high for what you get. The Hangover Burger with fries is $13. You can make an argument on the quality of the angus beef. Taste wise it failed to exceed Smash Burger, Five Guys, and many of the establishments competing for the Burger dollar. With my $13 Hangover Burger, I ordered a beverage that brought the bill to $17.30. The difference brings a plastic cup of Coke to near $4. Just a little overpriced. For $17.30, there are far better deals than a restaurant that isn't truly full service. Diner at New York Chinese Restaurant is $6 less. A soup, sandwich, and beverage at Cafe Zupas is $6.30 less. The seafood combo at L&L Barbecue is approximately $4.50 less. I could go on and on. Another constructive criticism talking point is that the one burger they offer should be a selection of toppings that the customer chooses. A fried egg on the burger is unappealing for far too many taste buds.

The Exit:

  I returned to the nighttime sidewalks of Downtown Summerlin with a positive impression of MTO Cafe's customer service, views of Downtown Summerlin, and Hangover Burger. At the same time I had a feeling that MTO Cafe might be a rare experience. From my experiences shared in reviews, $17.30 pays for more rewarding dining experiences.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,9,3,vGMz7oaseQI5LfDGm3aw4g

Ugh,sorry not acceptable, please replace them with hashbrown..then she just walks away I say I don't want them she said it's ok you can keep them, she walks away and I grab a knife and I have to wipe them off my plate into the garbage. Replace means take my plate you moron and replace them. She then brings me out the hash browns totally disgusting overly cooked and nasty greasy taste. I asked for the burger medium well..it came out medium rare and the meat made me want to hurl. All this abuse for 18 dollars.

Nonetheless, I waited patiently for my Made To Order chicken breakfast tacos.  Chicken, egg, red and green peppers, onions, a hint of queso on corn tortillas (x3) with red and green sauce. The chicken was dry and bland. The eggs appear to have been browned as an omelette then chopped to fill the tacos. The peppers gave it a mild kick. The salsas didn't help much either. The salsa added a little acidity but no heat.

I'd like to say the service made it all worth it, but this day the front counter was staffed by two young kids who seemed flustered and disorganized. To their credit, they tried really hard.

5102415,2014-12-15,3,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"This is one of the new locations in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Excellent location and beautifully modeled. 

This place seems to be very busy, which is excellent for them. When you walk in, it's an order and seat yourself type of joint. #1 reason why I will tell you this place is overpriced. 
Also overpriced because it's off the strip. You would expect these kind of prices on there, but not for the regulars in town that's far enough from the strip. 
Another thing I'm not much of a fan of, they have shared seating here. Which is okay for some places, but a place like this? Probably not. It's so small in here as it is. People tend to take odd chairs and leave room for 1 person when if they could have scooted down just one, it'd make so much more room for parties over 2 people. It's too hard to leave easy things up to people because they'll fuck it up every time. 

The food here is good. I will say that and that is was pretty quick. 
Overall, just for a lunch with 2 drinks costed us $41.00 plus tip. That's a little much in my opinion. For the location, the food and the fact that you serve yourself, seat yourself and they have a tip on the receipt is just asking a lot of people. 


We had - 
The Hangover Burger
Grilled Cheese
Clam Chowder

Clam Chowder: Delicious. Some of the best we've had in town. Full of clams, good sauce that's not so creamy that you have to force it down.
Grilled Cheese: I was not a fan at all. I probably should have read the description better because I couldn't even eat it. It was just such a bizarre combination of flavors and I do not ever NOT finish my dish. The cheese is not melted, it's half walnuts and the bread is toasted with honey. It was so sweet and odd. 
The Hangover Burger: Delicious. The flavors were all meshed in an tasted excellent. The bacon was nice and crispy and the flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was very messy, but very well worth it. Oh, and those fries...FREAKING amazing!

The customer service was fine, I just don't know if I'm okay paying a tip when it's not sit down service. But, some people don't agree with this. 

Overall, it's a nice location, modernly decorated, nice people, good food and excellent for a quick hot meal. Just be expecting to pay prices for sit down service.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,9,6,3,l0RkbG38yzor96Q1VUl5YQ

Fries - completely cold, hard as rocks, and obviously not fresh 

Apple Rings - no crispy texture at all, dough falling off of rings. Again - complete mush. 

No flavor. Just garbage.

I've spoken to a manager twice in regards to getting a refund. (A few minutes after receiving my order and again yesterday when I noticed that the promised refund hadn't been issued.) During my initial call I was told ""Yea, our food does turn to mush if it isn't eaten within a certain timeframe & it took your UberEATS driver 40 mins to arrive."" Um...ok how about you inform your drivers of the mush problem? Jeez. He then told me ""I will contact UberEATS and have them issue a refund. You won't have to do anything else.""

Fast forward to yesterday and there is still no refund. I call again and speak to Leland. He asks for my name and phone number and tells me that UberEATS will be calling me in regards to my refund. No call. 

So at this point I'm done.

We ordered the creamsicle smoothie, pb and j smoothie, bacon pancake dippers, a huevos rancheros wrap, and a patty melt--totaling $60. The only decent items on that list were the pb and j smoothie and the bacon dippers. 

The creamsicle smoothie was watered down. The huevos rancheros wrap was served as a skillet with zero offer to correct the mistake. And the patty melt was inedible. Given the long wait, I had no desire to complain about the meal. However, when one of the workers asked how everything was, I politely voiced my concerns. With an uneaten patty melt sitting in front of her, she meekly said, ""I'm sorry"" and giggled. ZERO offer to correct the inedible food. ZERO offer to provide a refund for the inedible food. That response is why this review is being left. For $60, she should have immediately corrected the matter and not simply offered a lackadaisical apology and walked away. If you're going to ask how something is and then not correct a discovered problem, why even ask?

They're incredibly moist and the agave nectar and pecans added on top just make life better. For $11, you get three huge flapjacks. I'd recommend splitting this heavy breakfast with another person unless you're the hulk or something.  

For lunch, I wasn't as impressed. There's one vegan option - the falafel wrap. It was a little on the dry side and the french fries might as well have been made out of cardboard. The fries had zero flavor and were all crunch. 

Overall, MTO excels as a breakfast spot but could improve it's lunch game.

5279202,2015-02-02,3,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"Stating from the day it was announced that I felt MTO Café was the most relevant restaurant on the list of eateries at Downtown Summerlin it is with some shame that it took so long to visit after the store's opening, but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations at the Downtown location several months prior I'm happy to report the dinner selections in the shadow of Red Rock are just as well done.

Eschewing traditional tableside service and instead implementing a system similar to that of Panera, where guests order and pay at a counter before waiting briefly at their table for Made-to-Order creations, it was with a specially requested tasting menu that my experience at MTO Downtown Summerlin took place and leaving selections to Midwestern Chef's discretion the plates presented frequently took me back to my childhood - memories of roadtrips espoused by some things while upgrades on traditional comfort foods were found in several more.

Beginning with flavored waters from the restaurant's FreeStyle machine - the Peach Dasani particularly lovely, round one began with a sharable tray of Mediterranean dips as well as salads and while the tabbouleh was not particularly my style all three of the dips were absolutely top notch, the smoke-imbued eggplant amongst the best I've ever tasted while edamame added a crisp, vegetal tinge to hummus atop piping hot pita.

Conserving capacity to maximize the experience, round two consisted of three soups served in espresso-style shooters and although the clam chowder may have benefitted from just a touch more brine the cream-style tomato and heavily cheese-topped French onion were both reference standard, a similar compliment applicable to the KFC Breakfast, a juicy breast of chicken beneath herb tinged double-crisp batter atop a pile of pan-seared mashed potatoes all beneath a veil of country gravy and an over easy egg.

A bit leery of rumors that the Chicken Pot Pie was substandard as the biscuit-topped version represents a favorite for myself and pretty much everyone outside of Dutch Amish Country (and those who consider Swanson or Banquet to be quality cuisine) I'm more than pleased to say that the version served by Church and Co. is something many Southern Grandmas would be proud to call their own and with both the stock and chicken teaming with herbs while the carrots offered sweet balance an equally deft plate was executed in the case of Meatloaf that opts not so hit diners with a sledgehammer of false flavors from truffle oil, but rather to dig deeper and provide an aromatic topnote to tender veal beneath flavors both smoky and sweet alongside tender orange gnocchi.

At this point admittedly getting a bit full it was thankfully a downsized portion of the vegan spaghetti squash that arrived and again focusing on nuance, with the sweetness of grapes and carrots used to offset the earthy flavors of beets and curry, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in a plate adhering to such dietary standards - the side-dish of fresh sprouts perfectly cooked, though a bit too spicy from horseradish for this diner's tongue.

Not particularly focused on plated desserts, but instead offering fresh-baked cookies and several pastries available throughout the day, it was with two boxes of goods that I took my leave after a long chat with the Chef and his team and indulging in some after the walk home with others saved for the following morning it was somewhat disappointing to find the poppyseed muffin almost inedibly dry, though the rest was just as good as the majority of the savories - both the brownie and almond pecan scone particularly memorable with soft texture and bold flavors while each of the cookies were far better than those offered at Wonderland Bakery...at less than one-half the cost.

Admittedly a bit pricey for a 'quick casual' place, yet at the same time far friendlier in service with both produce and proteins sourced from local sources as Chef Church is a regular at the local farmers markets, MTO Café is precisely what Downtown Summerlin visitors should support - a local business committed to doing things right, not another offshoot from elsewhere willing to mail it in and make bank.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,4,Sz5VKAfDzh1-r_AQbB6Cjg

Banana Nutella Muffin:
I had such great expectations for this muffin that I bought 3 for me, myself and I - we were all disappointed. Me thought it lacked Nutella. Myself added more Nutella on the 2nd muffin. I didn't waste any more time and calories on the 3rd muffin and just tossed it. I mean, if you're going to put key ingredients onto the name of the menu item, those ingredients better exist! You can taste banana but the Nutella was lightly drizzled on top of the muffin - so sad. The muffin itself lacked texture and was very dense and dry. I'm not expecting cupcake...but a muffin should not be like this at all. 1/5

Turkey Melt:
Turkey, avocadoes, cheese and tomatoes. Comes with fries and pickles. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy, nothing extremely different, nothing noteworthy. 3/5

What you should definitely try: Hangover Burger, skillets, Fat Elvis and apple rings. Those are good!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,4,3,8OOfOSzJ5E352hoca73y6w

we both got the chicken in a waffle.  presentation stunning... it is waffles with a chicken fried chicken breast in the middle with white country gravy on top.   it looked so good I couldn't wait to eat it.  sadly I was a little disappointed.... it needed seasoning BAD.  For the price you pay for this, and the long drive from green valley, I really wanted to love this place.

Every time that we asked a question, Diana would jump in the conversation to answer. I believe she is the boss. Maybe if she quit micromanaging her employees, they could flourish on their own. 

I ordered the MTO breakfast.  I ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy. No big deal. It was corrected and brought back. 

The coffee was warm but far from hot. Diana said that she made the coffee when she first came in. Ya I could tell. The next cup was much better. 

As for the food, it was pretty good. My wife had the broccoli omelet and said that it was incredible!!  My MTO breakfast was pretty good. 

I would definitely comeback but have something different next time. 

My advice to Diana would be to give your employees a little more freedom to answer questions that are directed to them. They are friendly and intelligent. Remember, there is a reason that you hired them.",Fmx8Q9zyPALb1XbN_OnadA,0,0,4,hUeEZU-w5gqPRXwgvWt6KQ

Now I'm not one to complain about the cost of stuff. If it's good, I will justify it. But keep in mind this is a quick service place. Order at the counter, get your own soda and they bring your food out to you. So when I see $7 for a cup of tomato soup, Nope, that's where I draw my line. 

My spinach salad was so awesome but without chicken ($3 extra) it would have been a little boring simply because it would have only been 3 ingredients- spinach, quinoa and tomatoes. My honey got the tri-tip breakfast plate and the meat was rare (not even warm it was cooked so quick). So we brought it back up and the quickly fixed it but the flavor was just very beefy (not in a good way). The rest of the plate was delicious but he wouldn't order it again. Said he'd go back to the protein plate instead. 

Overall, yummy and quick but it hits your pocket just a little too hard. Which makes MTO more of an occasional lunch stop instead of a regular one.",l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g,1,1,3,Uq8DEXSos375y7BMRcfvVA

The line was about 10 deep at 11:30 on the holiday but moved quickly. The menu is fairly large with both standard American breakfast and lunch fare. Our wait was about 5 minutes and after ordering through the fast casual set up and pouring our drinks, we had a seat outside where there was some shade to protect against the temperatures which were pushing into triple digits.

The food was brought out in a timely manner despite how busy it was. The tortilla was layered toward the top on my huevos rancheros which pleased me that the texture wasn't lost from the salsa and egg yolk. I also got to have half of my wife's turkey melt. With both dishes, the creamy, fresh avocado stood out the most.

Even though we were outside, an employee regularly checked on us and cleared our plates when we finished. Lunch for three was a little pricey at $42.

This means that its fans can now have MTO for dinner and that's what four of us did tonight.  I've only ever had breakfast at the original location on Main Street so I've been curious to see what their other menu items are like.  Tonight's choice was the chicken pot pie, comfort food that's apropos for the fall weather.  MTO's version is served piping hot in a skillet with four buttermilk biscuits, shredded chicken, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks: so tasty!  The biscuits serve as the ""crust"" of the dish and it's definitely a hearty meal.  A generous serving, I shared it with the pals and they agreed that it was delicious.  
This location differs from the first one in that you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  There's a flatscreen TV, a Coca Cola freestyle soda station, an outdoor patio seating area, a community table inside, as well as comfortable tables and booths.  The booths have convenient electrical outlets in the wall to charge your electronics while you dine and the dining tables have purse hooks, a feature the ladies (and men with murses) will appreciate.  Service was excellent, too.  Open just in time for the holidays, there's no doubt that this MTO will be buzzing with business, gaining more fans along the way.

Like I said, flavorless and so odd. Who serves raw, cold carrot with warm pancakes? The textures were very strange and not at all pleasant. Plus, because the pancakes didn't taste like anything at all, all you could taste was carrot and coconut.

At first I was put off a bit by the spartan interior, lack of any other customers at the time, and that there was no waiter service.  For some reason, I had it in my head that the MTO Cafe would be much like the Sahara's old bustling full-service Nascar Cafe, and be a haven for comfort food.  I was right on the second supposition, but in error on the first.  And, I was slightly embarrassed that I had recommended such a casual, seemingly fast food eatery as a place to sit down to dinner with friends.

But once the food arrived, and I gazed at and initially tasted my BLTAE, my concerns were quickly dispelled.  My friends were pleased with their food: a Black & Blue Burger with French Fries, and a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup, as was I.  Only Diane lamented that her Hangover Burger was not medium rare as requested.  Yet this place is decidedly not a fast food joint.  Some very good creative cooking occurs here.

I had almost instructed the order taker to hold the egg, but thought it would be more sporting and adventurous to try a BLTAE just as is was intended to be served.  This turned out to be a wise decision, for the oozing egg yolks from two quite large and perfectly prepared Sunnyside Up Fried Eggs lubricated and added flavor to the large sammie, which I had to figure out how best to eat.  I was initially torn between cutting through one-half of the heaping and rather messy sandwich with a knife and then eating it with a fork or wrestling with it by hand, before just picking it up with one hand the normal way and directing it at my mouth.  But to get my mouth around this imposing specimen on a plate took some doing.  Yet after opening my mouth like a gaping upraised garage door, sliding the loaded and egg yolk-drenched bread slices inside, and then chomping down on the strips of crispy bacon, I was in comfort food heaven, and knew that this sandwich could be eaten in the conventional manner.  Slices of red tomatoes and shards of lettuce, large chunks of very fresh avocado, and a generous heaping of excellent crisp matchstick Fries added to the enjoyment of my meal, along with a multi-variety Coke dispenser with unlimited refills. 

In rating a restaurant, In my book the quality and taste of food are of paramount importance.  And, although the ambiance here was somewhat stark and resembled a school cafeteria, the place was clean, and restaurant staffers were friendly, helpful, and accommodating.

I expect to be back!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,10,6,4,7t1UbaEiG24O1uhJe5qa8A

5854112,2015-09-02,2,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,Shopping sprees can leave ones stomach growling and this place happened to be on our path when that happened.  My girls and I walked in and were greeted by numerous employees (love that).  It was quick and easy to order.  We all three ordered a caesar salad.  I wish the girl taking our order would have informed us on the size of the salad especially considering that my girls are 9 and 11 years old.  One salad would have fed all three of us because they are HUGE.  The three salads cost me about $50 (including 3 drinks) which was a little hefty I thought.  The dressing tasted like bottled caesar salad dressing.  Nothing fancy.  The service was fast and friendly but the food was just okay.,1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,3,2,3,kWHCQ-2s51ytnAajctsArw

5923663,2016-03-01,0,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"I came here for an afternoon snack while strolling summerlin. It's a clean cafè, however, doesn't give any impression from the outside. But as they always say, ""don't judge the book by its cover"". That's what I did and nothing did change.

I ordered a chicken falafel. The falafel itself is pretty big and could be shared. However, it tasted nothing special. Sad to say, it's too commercialized. I ordered some fries too, which is pretty crispy and good.....You can't go wrong with fries anyway!!

I believe they have a special drink every now and then. I'm not quite sure how often they change or have that. But that day, I had Mango Lemonade, which is sweet and refreshing. However, it also tasted like as if it came from just the concentrates. 

Price is not so bad. I wouldn't come here if you can still wait to find a better place to eat and explore.",swFWx0h8005umEPH-5YgNA,0,0,3,TuA1AmgJZx77TLDjOgl1dA

I had to greet her, she looked annoyed that she had to help another customer, and my questions were answered with short, blunt, minimal answers. Needless to say she didn't assist me with anything other than taking my money. Good thing she doesn't work on tips! Food was pretty good, but then I just saw them on Dirty Dining this evening eeeeekkkk! So now I;m seriously not going back. Crappy service and demerits for cleanliness?

5959637,2015-08-30,14,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"Having been to the original location Downtown I was relatively confident that I would enjoy this location as well, I we wrong. We came here for breakfast today, my mom ordered the Kentucky fried chicken and eggs and I ordered the tri tip and eggs with toasted brioche. 

The food took longer than expected to come out and it was with disappointment that I note how little I enjoyed just about everything I tried. The brioche was barely toasted and somewhat cold, the eggs were a soggy mess as were the hash browns and the tri tip was absolutely flavorless. I was forced to douse my entire plate with salt, pepper and chili sauce to give it any sort of flavor whatsoever. My mom's chicken was just as disappointing. The only thing about our meal that I enjoyed was the iced tea which was brewed well and strong.

I have no interest in returning to this location again.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,22,17,2,IxokDje1T0ZXHQhkUpS9ig
5971026,2015-11-21,0,PJPO9AYkt__t4kSWdSWnfw,"Don't try to order off the kids menu unless you can prove you have a child with you. I wanted plain chicken fingers and they don't offer it on the regular menu. Also, I wasn't feeling well enough for a full meal of something else. They wouldn't let me get chicken fingers. Clearly they don't understand that some adults have health issues and can only eat certain foods and/or smaller portions. My husband ordered a burger and a drink. Totaled $17. I really don't think my $7 overpriced, kids chicken fingers should have been a big deal. I am now waiting for Blue Ribbon to open at 11am so I can go get some chicken fingers. I'm sure they will be glad to take my $7+. At many restaurants, I often order from the kids menu when I am not feeling well. NEVER have I been denied food. I always make sure to order a drink and my husband gets a full priced meal to make up the difference. This place just has bad customer service and I won't be back. It's really unfortunate, because I have enjoyed their food in the past. Oh well. Time for some Blue Ribbon !",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,1,0,1,xlsC9mKdC6jxhVvtD0GaQg
