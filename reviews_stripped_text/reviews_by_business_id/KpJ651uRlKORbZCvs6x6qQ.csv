It  had a nice vibe and the DJ tapped into it very well.  We had beers for $8 each and a $30 quesedilla so be prepared for the sticker shock.  The good news is that it was delicious and large enough portioned to be sharable. The pool was small but in a way that was kewel since it forced you to be more social. The staff was beautiful - they remembered to hire hot guys too! I went on August 7th and the bartender was friendly, attentive, and serving up drinks with the freshest ingredients!  The crowd was a sexy eclectic diverse mix of ethnic, age, and social backgrounds.  I hope it stays that way.",wLL1iuarpi2H8K7mhqI7_w,1,0,5,yO50-Zpn5bPb1BDiMTmc3g

Since we were going on a Thursday (industry day), he hooked us up with a daybed. We walked into Trop and got immediately confused and turned around (everything looks so much shinier and newer) and ended up at the Cafe to ask for directions. Security decided to escort us over to the indoor entrance (so we wouldn't have to go outside just yet) which was further back by a pool gift shop. There were several hosts around, all of whom were very friendly. One of them checked our reservation and confirmed that it was comped with no F&B minimum. Yay! It was about an hour and a half past opening and the place was pretty crowded. So glad we got the daybed because those are the closest areas to the water and if you don't have a daybed or cabana, you're pretty much sitting on the low walls that surround the area. Our server was very friendly but service was a little slow since there were so many people around. The one thing my friend and I noticed about the actual pool was the depth. The majority of the water is MUCH deeper than a lot of the other over 21 pools. For the most part, everyone was pretty chill and friendly and the crowd was definitely different from the usual fist pumping group (they were present, of course, but there was more variety here). The pool is a bit small but definitely cleaner looking than Bare and Tao Beach. The whole area is a bit smaller as well but it did have a much more intimate and hidden space which I really liked. Overall a great experience, I will be back!",3CMiTAhq_o_GP1tLs-ihbg,0,0,4,dSy0u8VG_cP1SiF-AH160w

Okay, it was like 110 degrees, but that's not Nikki Beach's fault, so I'm not taking away any stars on account of that. 

I had previously written off Vegas pool parties as festering puddles of STD magnets. Nikki Beach keeps it relatively classy (though that term is used loosely - it's a pool party in Vegas, afterall), but what brought the experience over the top was the high quality of the staff, the drinks, the decor, and the great diversity of the people. 

I've never experienced such an accommodating level of service at a Vegas club. From the cute security guys at the entrance, to our awesome bodyguard who moved that freaking heavy umbrella whenever the sun moved, and the lovely girl taking drink orders, everyone got some serious A++ training in customer service at Nikki Beach! Yeah sure, we had a reserved daybed and some cocktail pitchers, but were treated more like royalty. That was awesome to know that the folks at Nikki Beach view all levels of patrons in the highest regard. 

Our group of girls ordered pitchers of rasberry white sangria and strawberry mojito. These drinks were refreshingly bomb, mostly because the fruit ingredients were actually FRESH! Not particularly strong, but I didn't want something high in alcohol content anyway since it was so hot out and it would've just zapped any and all hydration right out of me. 

The pool area was okay, I know that's supposed to be the biggest draw to a pool party, but it was small, crowded, and the water was really warm. I had a better low-key time out on our upper-tiered day bed near bar and misters. But if you're into the wilder pool party thing, that small pool full of beautiful people is probably your ticket.

Lastly, a big kudos to Nikki Beach for attracting such a diverse crowd. Love a place where you see all different types of faces having fun together =)",oCFJQ5fhP9I_IcBYI7WWlg,3,0,5,RuXVeCVdVV8cPC53xm1DNQ

Here is my story, and its just one story but it left a bad enough taste in my mouth I had to leave a review.

We show up at about 11:45am, pool opens at noon. About 15-20 people are waiting. (this is saturday). Line forms, nice enough staff up to this point. Free admission, no problems. The slew of about 10-12 bouncers are now text messaging like crazy for the entire time we are waiting, which if you've been to Vegas is just obnoxious, but its part of their job.

My wife is stopped in front of me and this conversation takes place.

Bouncer: Can you smile please?
My wife: (laughing) Really? 
Bouncer: This isn't the first time I checked an ID miss (sternly)

I laugh, hand my ID and we continue to the ""pool"". The rest of our party follows.

The club area we walked through looks pretty cool, nice decor etc. No complaints for this.

First thing we notice, the pool is about the size of a nice health club hot tub. And its stadium seating day beds. If you want to lay out, I suppose this is pretty good, but it was advertised as a pool, and this big pool party. 

We nab a menu, figure we should order some buckets of beer. 

Nope, but they do have $70 buckets of some fruity drink...

And out we walked. In the end, looked like it had potential, but the setup compared to hard rock was EXTREMELY weak. I highly suggest you check out one of the more popular pool scenes in Vegas.",L6MmNL8AyHIjplQ5yJMn_Q,6,0,1,7QSBxYIQsAOI0q-psRUk7Q

This was my first Vegas pool party experience. I went there on a Thursday pretty early like at 12:30 and it was kind of dead. We were on some list so both got free but I am pretty sure everyone got in free. They mentioned daybeds you just had to spend $50 but my boyfriend doesn't really drink so wasn't sure if it would be worth it. Since it was pretty empty we found a place to put our stuff and it was fine.

The pool is TINY.. like the size of my pool at my apartment. The actual place is pretty big with rows of daybeds that didn't fill up but I assume it may be because it was a Thursday or it just doesn't get that busy here. Drinks are average Vegas prices. We chilled in the pool for a few hours. The crowd is fun.. very mixed! DJ was good. both played hip hop all day.. Fun atmosphere with beach balls and people just hanging out. Since the pool was so small I felt like it was so easy to talk to people and make friends. I've been to Encore beach and its SO big and spaced out that it is totally not like that.

I can't comment on the advertised pool parties I see some reviewers complaining about, but as a nightclub or a place to go during the day to have a drink, chill out, and mingle this place is awesome.  The fact that my party had a special menu made up especially for us, really sweetened the experience.  The space is gorgeous.  There are cabanas, day beds, and tipi structures on different tiers leading down to the pool, so the people watching is great.   The pool is definitely on the smaller side, but who really gets in the water anyway?  My advice is that if you want to go to Nikki Beach during the day go for the social scene, not for the swimming.  If you really want to swim do it back at the hotel you're staying at, because I know that no one going to Nikki Beach is staying at the Tropicana anyway.

That's right!! Halloween in Vegas!

Some guy wrapped these bands around our wrists while strolling down the strip and we decided that Nikki Beach would be the designated spot to get both our drink and freak on. We weren't entirely disappointed.

The bands that the guy said would get us in free actually got is on for $10 off admission. What are you going to do... it's Vegas right?

So table service is $500.00, yes I said $500.00. It comes with one bottle of your choice and mixers. We skipped out on the table service and ponied up to the bar and bought our drinks the old fashioned way... one at a time. The drinks were EXPENSIVE, but again it's Vegas. This is the only place in America where you can buy a vodka and Redbull on the street for $6 and pay $16 for the same drink in a club.

The dance floor was adequate but the place got packed quick. As far as the tables were concerned... they were ALL reserved for people willing to shell out $500 to sit down. So, you either danced or stood. No sitting allowed. The DJ was good but his mixing was horrible. He went from fast song to slow song with very little thought in transition. It made dancing kind of difficult. The coolest part of the night was the MJ impersonator. At first, i was thinking ""cheesy"" but the guy was really good. Afterwards though, it was all downhill. I know night clubs are supposed to be packed but this was a little ridiculous. I probably wouldn't go back to Nikki Beach, one because I'm not really a club goer and two because this place was pretty lackluster considering the prices.

Oh yeah, the half-naked transsexual with The Joker makeup was frightening... however she got in free so that's why I gave them a third star.",90qOr723GZRa1vVCjf0YAw,0,2,3,s5UWbE2WgBMi9HqICiemHw

the highlight of my stay here was definitely the saxophonist busting out to popular club music...in the middle of the pool!

i was seriously in awe. that guy was awesome. 

as far as pool parties go, though, there was surprisingly little activity within the (small) pool. Most people were chilling in the cabana / teepee areas. The space as a whole is smallish and more intimate than others I've been to (like the palms). I didn't eat much from the spread my group got but everything looked fantastic. I think I ate one lobster taco and it was delicious (of course). 

the staff is incredibly friendly as well. i forget the gentleman's name who took care of our cabana but he introduced himself to everyone in the beginning and said he was there for anything we needed :D

Tropicana recently opened its new day club (Nikki Beach) and night club (Club Nikki) on May 26th.  This place is off the charts!  The beach club is an all white theme, with white day beds everywhere.  They even have some kick ass white ""Tee Pee"" cabanas.  The pool is a little small but the day club is simply amazing.  The vibe is much more up my alley compared to other day clubs like Rehab and Wet Republic.  In these two clubs there are numerous drunk college kids and what I like to call Guebos (Jersey Shore type guys that are completely ripped and like to do monkey dances as they try to attract the opposite sex).  Not at Nikki.  They are a little more strict there (dress code, no drinks in the pool, guys cant dance on ledges, etc).  Don't get me wrong you can still have fun Vegas style. but the rules tend to not attract that ""party till Im retarded"" type crowd.  The service could be better honestly, the staff was all incredibly friendly but I felt like it took an hour to get a drink once we ordered it from our cocktail waitress.

Now the night club....
    Again....wow!  This is a smaller club compared to most but the atmosphere was very similar to the pool, chill but people are here to party.  They have an amazing light show to dance with, the dance floor is fairly good size, and they have plenty of tables.  They also have three bars around the club which makes it nice ordering a drink (you dont have to wait forever compared to other clubs that have one bar).  Elaine was right, they have a wood platform around the dance floor that girls can get up and dance on, but if you are of the male sex security will grab your ass down within a heart beat.  NOW HERE IS THE BEST PART OF THE CLUB: They have a champagne muse (looks like a circle chandelier) that goes around a track on the roof and will drop down from the ceiling to your table if you order certain types of champagne.  Their is a beautiful girl on it dressed like an Angel and she will literally deliver the bottle to your table while being dropped from the roof!  Awesome right!?!?

When I visited, it was before the dance party got started, so I did not experience the full out party vibe or crowd. I will say that the dance floor is squarely in the middle of the space, and while there are walkways to each side, I can imagine that the dance floor might become a little irritating with people trying to traverse into and out of the club.

This place is like Nikki Beach Miami, amplified. Everything's sparkling white and brand new. Absolutely gorgeous setup, with a waterfall, white daybeds and teepees everywhere.

From our own personal bodyguard, to the VIP host, to the lush teepee where we made our home, to the drinks & food we were served - to the spot-on service from every single employee, we were in LOVE.

Granted, I can't speak to cost as I wasn't involved in that aspect - but to say this setup was pricey is probably a major understatement. The teepees beat out a cabana any day, with a flat screen TV, insanely comfy couches, fully stocked everything ... just badass.

If you're in Vegas, this is a must visit. It's classy, sexy, spotless and beats out every beach club I've been too. Yes, the pool is small (given the number of occupants this place could probably hold), but that's one minor blip on an otherwise perfect establishment.

If I'd only had a Tiffany's tiara, I would've sworn we were Princesses. A girl could get used to this.",j3hyELLtfNyxWAkGPN1Reg,3,3,5,VUoMiaUfejjtdIbq996sCA

The food seems pricey until you see the portions they come in. If I had to choose for a pool party, it would definitely be Nikki Beach.",NdIQidg--mW4DrKE8gSjWg,3,0,5,XfU2xInWytO2K1hxYUJN9Q
