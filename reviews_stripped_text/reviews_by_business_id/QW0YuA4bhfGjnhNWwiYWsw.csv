Every special is based on fresh, in season vegetables and meats and his own recipes!  When he's out of ingredients for the night, he crosses through that offering and it's done until tomorrow.  

The atmosphere is no doubt a bar, but the food is much more memorable.  The pork belly ramen, pork bhan mi, and many other Asian fusion dishes are out of this world.  He also has ""Scotty"" fries for those missing the bay area, and a country fried chicken sandwich thats equally delicious for the less adventurous. 

I've eaten here weekly for the better part of a year and it never disappoints.",EB37JJbo6Qsd3__VRl-gJg,1,1,5,3EBIBHo_uTp7LpPZvpzGYw

Me and my friend ordered Scott's frys and omg they are like Crack.  So yummy and addicting. No I have not done Crack lol but these frys will have you hooked. Scott uses only the freshest ingredients and everything is made from scratch.  Totally coming back to try more good food.,_0XknTFzKjkvihafRzYNGA,2,0,5,PUNx95x42wnX4lLrHEdNNg
