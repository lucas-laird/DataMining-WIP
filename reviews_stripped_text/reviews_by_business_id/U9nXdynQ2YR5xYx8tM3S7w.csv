The servers don't actually know the price of their alcoholic beverages b/c the price changes daily.  You have to ask for the price each drink you might possibly be interested in.

So I had this one margarita that he said was the best.. I was called the Ultimate Margarita Platinum...it was DELICIOUS. It was kinda strong, but after a little while, I was good to finish it. As we sat chatting and drinking our margaritas, our food came. I had the Dragonfire Chicken.  A fire-grilled breast glazed with Chinese Kung Pao sauce, served over slow cooked coconut jasmine rice with pineapple pico de gallo, Mandarin oranges and fresh steamed broccoli.

I've been to this location before without any issues so not sure what has happened over time or this night??
The lobster tails are my favorite dish on the menu! I always order them when I have gone  there the past few times. I never get them grilled because having them grilled tend to dry them out & then they don't taste so good! The other option is boiled or steamed?? I can't seem to remember, I must have lobster brain now! lol 
But with this visit @ this location I got a loaded baked potato with my tails & it was shockingly ice cold. Really?? I have no idea how this could of happened but I told our server James right away, well the new one he brought me was steaming hot & much better! I found the lobster tails to be smaller then usual. (You get only 2) & a little drier then normal. Thank God for the high cholesterol causing melted butter to dip them in & make them taste much better! 
The broccoli wasn't so yummy as it always is! 
I've been a strips card member for years!! It's free to sign up & you accumulate points every time you eat or drink there then get coupons via email offering money off your meals & free food. I used my 20% off coupon & saved my date $11.00 off the bill. We also got to try out some free chips & salsa before our meal (thanks to a strip offer). My date said the salsa wasn't spicy @ all, which I agreed with him on this & the chips were blah. They weren't the greatest so I would never order them & pay for them. I like freebies & it gives you a chance to try stuff out esp. if you have never had them before! 

The place was really busy for a Sunday night. There was no hostess when we arrived (6pm) & we had to wait a few minutes for her to show up! Also our food came out really fast (I mean it is lobster tail), our waiter James was fabulous! Very friendly & you could tell he enjoys his job! He was sympathetic when I had to tell him my baked potato was ice cold & took care of it right away! Though a little surprised a manager didn't come over like @ most restaurants when there is something wrong they stop by...?? He kept our drinks filled, asked us how are meals were, offered dessert & brought our check over right away & took care of cashing us out quickly cause no one likes having to wait for their check, change or CC receipt when they are ready to leave!!! 

I've also have had their hamburgers & Jack Daniels grilled chicken which are other favorites of mine! Some of the pasta dishes I have tried have been good too! Hopefully if I ever hit this location again in the future the food will be better!",w8QdFtVKqtGn9QhkRDbAFQ,1,0,2,yRlx5QdbkqS8ILQxa3ktsA

Now it was about 7 o'clock at night and there was only three tables with guests so I didn't expect to wait over five minutes just to be seated when they weren't busy at all. After waiting almost 10 minutes our server came over to us and looked very disorientated (as if he was frustrated) I ordered an amaretto sour and he instantly asked me ""what's that?"". I was really confused because shouldn't the bartender know but anyways I told him what was in it. After a couple minutes he came back to the table and asked me again and what brand of amaretto. I finally got my drink after several more minutes  and then we were ready to order. I ordered the French onion soup and I specifically asked for it to come out before my meal and I ordered an entrée as well. After 18 more minutes are food finally came out. My soup and entrée came out together and not only was I upset because I asked for it first but the soup was cold and very tasteless. While eating our dinner the hostess and waiters had no problem using their phones to Snapchat, Facebook, and text and fool around. Looking around the restaurant I could see tables that needed to be cleaned, floors that needed to be swept.

Anyways, this particular one has a pretty cool bar area, it's decorated in the newer TGI Fridays look, rather than the old outdated California ones.

Can't say much else, expect that it's fairly close to the strip, and not touristy at all. My gf and I came here this past Saturday around 12am and she was shocked to see NO ONE was in the restaurant, but as soon as we got seated and ordered, the bar area started flooding with locals.

Crab Cake: was ok a bit bland the sauce helped alot but still couldve been better and was ok.

Jack Daniels Burger: was delish.  flavors went well everything was cooked as asked.

Sizzling Chicken & shrimp. ooooooooooook. we had a major problem here. 2 cheeses are suppose to be in there but it was just 1 american cheese. meh. i had ordered the sweet potato as a side but the waiter came back out saying he can switched my mash potato for the fries. so i agreed canceling the side. the shrimp was alright. nothing special. the chicken was oil under marinated. and just bland in general. the sweet potato fries.. was HORRIBLE. adding salt DOES NOT COMPLIMENT the fries AT ALL. if it was under salted it was fine. but i literally saw chunks on salt all over it... so that was left untouched...after a bite.

I had the Jack Daniels chicken and shrimp which also came with steamed seasoned veggies and loaded mashed potato's. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. Mashed potato's and shrimp were amazing! My only recommendation would be a little more seasoning on the veggies.

 After dinner I decided on  a Washington apple martini which was pretty good but definitely not the best I have had. I also joined the stripes club which is pretty cool. You earn 1 strip for every $1 spent on food and in turn earn free food etc. I am already up to a free appetizer or dessert so I look forward to some more pot sticklers!

I came to this restaurant after nagging my bf that I wanted pasta. We checked every other restaurants before landing in this awesome place (Others were closed because it was almost mid night). 

For starts the ambiance was dark but pretty cool, it reminded me of Applebee's but slightly bigger or not idk I just wanted pasta that night. Anyway, for starters we ordered Tuscan spinach dip... it was amazing. Absolutely delicious I must say. I totally loved it! The combination of spinach, artichoke hearts, sautéed onions and bell peppers blended with parmigiano and Romano cheese was divine. Adding with the crispy tostada chips was better. 

The main dish for me was a Cajun shrimp & chicken pasta and my bf was a Sizzling chicken & shrimp( Garlic marinated chicken). Both dishes were divine and tasty. I love the flavour of the pasta ( I'm a pasta freak!). The shrimps were juicy and the garlic sauce mixed so well with the shrimp. (I've fallen in love with garlic sauce mixed with melted butter).

My wife, who suggested we come here so she could have a drink due to her disheartening day asked our waitress about happy hour and was told it's only available if you're seated in the bar. I would have better understood if we weren't with our child. We requested a manager to determine our eligibility for the special, which shouldn't have been necessary but was honored nonetheless.

When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 30 min wait. Since it was Friday night, we figured that made sense and we sat around waiting for our table. About 20 min later we were told that our table was ready and followed the hostess into the restaurant where we were led to the far back left corner, passing through a half empty restaurant! If there were dozens of tables empty, why did we have to wait and more importantly, why were we lied to about a 30 min wait when they could've pieced together 2 tables to fit our party of 5 easily! 

When it came time to order our drinks and appetizers, I inquired about happy hour and was told it was only at the bar. Since my friend had his nephew with him we couldn't move to the bar, oh well. We placed our drink and food orders, with Rachel and I going with the $10 unlimited appetizers - mozzerella sticks and boneless wings. The mozz sticks and wings were decent since those are pretty difficult to screw up. My 2nd order of mozz sticks were not as good and the cheese wasn't as melted which is how I like it. Our 2nd order of wings had the garlic parmesean sauce on it, which tasted kind of funky. Rachel couldn't eat it because it looked like snot to her lol.

When it came time to pay, we split the check between 2 cards and when the waitress saw this she asked for our IDs. Hold up, hold my phone. Since when do restaurants check for IDs when paying for a meal?! At first I refused to show my ID on the principle that no merchant is supposed to ask for ID anyways when paying with a card (Visa and MasterCard both prohibit this), much less a restaurant. However, it didn't seem like she was going to let me use my card if I didn't show her my ID. A little argument ensued where I informed the waitress that by doing so her business is in violation of their contracts/agreements with MasterCard and that I would report them for such a violation if she continued to ask for my ID. In the end, I decided to just comply by tossing my ID at her rather than just walking out and not paying. I figured I'd contact MasterCard and their corporate customer service to voice my complaints, because an hourly paid waitress is too dumb to understand anything related to business or contracts anyways. All she kept saying was that she could send her manager over as if that was going to solve anything. She said it was store policy so I'm pretty sure her manager was the one that taught her this.

Our food came out, my steak was suppose to be medium well.  It was so tough and over cooked, I will say the ribs were really good, and the baked potato was so over cooked, the skin was dark brown and not edible! I love to eat my skin on my potato..not today! Received another steak, with another baked potato, the steak was a little better, and the potato once again was the same as the one before!  They gave me yet another potato, and it was a little better, but it was barely hot.  I just gave up!  My son's wings were dry, and he did not want anymore than what was on his plate.  I called the manager and she took off 1/2 the bill, but my gripe was that the manager knew that the waiter was taking back my order, why didn't he come to the table and apologize, and take off more if the bill.

It seems like the drinks got a little expensive too...nonetheless they had a pretty good selection of beers on tap (I had the Pyramid) and some awesome prices on the food they do have on the Happy Hour Menu. 
Ordered:
  Pyramid- Ice Cold
  Sliders - was good, but needed a little something.  I ate it w/ ranch!
  Wings - you can order different sauces.  I opted for the Jack Daniel's sauce.  Its a tad sweet, but was very flavorful. (came with carrots and celery)
  
I went with my sister around 5pm.  It was steady-paced, but not overwhelmingly busy. My sister scored a free Margarita.  I don't know what it was, but it was bright blue and was super yummy!!  Pretty strong too!

We started with the drinks we both ordered Coors light and two waters with lemon. I remembered that water taste a little off last time so I asked for a bottle of water instead with the ice and lemon. She must not have heard or listen because when our drinks came back two beers and one glass of water with ice and lemon and a bottle of water came back.

When she brought the ice cup and lemon we asked her about the special we saw on the commercial for two meats and two sides. Rebecca said the special just started a few days ago and hasn't heard the details about it, she needed to ask her manager about it and it was so new T.G.I. Friday's didn't have the menus yet. 
She gave us more time to look at the menu, not really saying if we could order that. So we went on line and looked up the details and read them. We originally wanted to order steak and salmon loaded mash potatoes with broccoli for me and steak and ribs with a baked potato and broccoli for my wife.
When she came back she asked what we wanted, we mentioned we wanted to two meats and two sides deal again and proceeded to tell what my wife's order was ribs and steak she cut us off and said I don't know if we could do that since I am just hearing about this deal and haven't yet spoken to my manager about details . I was about to show her and get the advertisement on the T.G.I Friday website but my wife cut me off ( second time someone cut me off in a row) and said that's fine. She will take two steaks  a bake potato and broccoli. Irritated already I ordered a steak and salmon loaded mash and broccoli I was trying to tell her I wanted the salmon plain but she cut me off twice to ask how I wanted my steak answering medium she left with my mouth still open. I hoped she heard the plain salmon part but had a feeling she didn't. Twenty minutes later my wife and I received our meals hers completely correct except for the ribs not being an option when it clearly was an option on the website and my plate all wrong salmon had the Bourbon sauce. I immediately tell her it's wrong she says that's ok walks off grabs a plate and asked me to put the salmon on it I tell her about the sauce being on the broccoli if she could replace that too? She says oh ok and takes the whole plate. While waiting the manager comes out ask if everything was ok? I go on to tell her what the problem was and she too cuts me off and says oh yes the cooks are taking care of it, at the same time my plate shows up everything looks ok ! But when I go to eat the broccoli IT HAD THE BOURBON SAUCE ON IT THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A FRESH ORDER OF IT  LIKE I ASKED !!!! And my steak is well done not medium.  I'm already highly irritated when Rebecca shows up to check on us we were already almost done BUT I still tell her about the broccoli and she tells me I told them to change the plate and give you fresh but they didn't listen. 
I know how that could be since I have worked in the food industry  and I agree sometimes that could be an issue but in my opinion if the server gave two extra seconds to listen to an order and take it down correctly or have a keen eye to detail this wouldn't happen in the first place. And I love the fact that the manager comes to your table to check if Everything was ok but how about coming around after we received the new plate or around the time we get the check . The manager would of been able to asses the situation. Also I find it odd that a promotion was already going on and no one knew about it ?!? How could this happen ?!? I know that if you haven't received signage or menus yet, it still wouldn't be an excuse why the server wouldn't know about the special. In short we never got a second beer because we never asked which we would have ordered another round and my meal was a complete disaster my wife finished her meal before me and just sat there and waited for me to finish. Good thing this wasn't our actual valentines dinner celebration, This was our second visit to this restaurant and our last ! Can't believe I paid full price and tipped for this horrible service.",HaJT3TVBPe0ZKb5lkGJTwQ,2,0,2,UDuXxJIGZoLT4ot9oSi0xA

For starters, the food and drink prices seem ridiculously high from what I remember. The staff is alright, our waiter was pretty friendly this time around but with as slow as it was, it took way too long for our food to come out.

I went with a new item they had on the menu...Korean Steak Tacos. For $10, I expected a lot more. The tacos were small and had barely any meat on them, the tortillas were stale and I'm pretty sure the greens topping them were expired. My wife had the wedge salad and boneless wings which were both okay. They drench the wings in sauce so they are super soggy when they come out. About the only thing we liked were the pretzel sticks which I'm guessing are a frozen thing so not too hard to get right anyway.

The food and service might deserve 2-3 stars but the restaurant doesn't for letting a particular ""balloon man"" wander around. I posted a picture of the guy so if you see him, make sure to say no thanks on the balloon animals. I don't get mad easily and joke around quite a bit, but this dude was a complete d-bag. He was making inappropriate jokes, being rude and just acting like a complete jackass in front of my family, including my 4 year old who he was making the balloon for. Had I not been with family, there would have been a problem with the way this guy was acting.

The 2 appetizers we had were potstickers and bbq chicken flatbread pizza ($11.50 each LOL!!) both overcooked which obviously made them dried out. I ordered the crusted parmesan cheese chicken ($14.25) and this too was overcooked. Food splatter all over the wall in our booth.

Finally a waitress came up and i will try and find someone to eat you  That should have been my first clue.  So were were seated and finally our waiter came over and ask us what we wanted to drink water and a beer, after a short time the beer was delivered.  I ordered the Pecan and chicken salad my husband ordered the fish and chips and I had the soup.  Now my soup came no bread and one package of crackers.  I asked if I could have some bread extra charge,  okay more crackers.  His Fish and Chips came first not very good looking  and Fish looked like the grease was old, not a very good presentation of the dish.  Next the salad chicken put on top and everything else on the bottom , I had to try and find the nuts pecans and cranberries plus the cheese.  Needed our check and yes I had to ask another waiter for the bill.  Finally our waiter came back and didn't know how the pay at our table worked,  The bill came to 51.00 and some change I tipped  him $8.00 he would have gotten more.  This cooperation needs to get it together .  Lets hope they read their reviews and get a good chief or cook.  Did I complain No but they should know better.

Our waitress took our drink order, and after we said we needed more time to look at the menu, she disappeared for about 15 minutes before she came back, took our order, and brought my water.

That was the last we saw of her.
When our food was finally brought out by two other waitresses about 20 minutes later, my water glass had been empty for awhile so I asked for a refill. Nothing. In addition to that, our order of fish n chips was chewy and a burger was soggy from sitting out so long. One of the waitresses rolled her eyes at us when we asked for napkins and utensils so we could, you know, eat our food?
Meanwhile, our assigned waitress had been very attentive to the other tables she was waiting on, and purposely ignored us every time she walked by. We finally had enough and went to the host stand to find a manager to complain to and there was another woman up there to complain about the same waitress. The manager was very apologetic but as soon as he FINALLY brought my water that at this point I had asked 3 times and waited half an hour for, he disappeared like our waitress had. And still no one checked up on us for the remainder of our meal. When we finally got our check, we saw that we only received a 20% discount, which was much less than we had expected. The bus girl helped us more than anyone else did. It was like pulling teeth trying to get simple things like refills and utensils.

Bar is the left (separated by the door), restaurant takes up the majority of the right side of the space.Atmosphere is less kitschy, used to be like Applebees.  

We were seated promptly and were waiting for the other half of our party. Service is a little slow (which is typical), but there was a healthy lunch crowd (it got really loud towards the end of our meal). It did take a while to order. But service got better as we got our food and the server did check on us several times during our meal. Looking around, I noticed the same thing happening, people waiting for their food (so we weren't the only ones). 

We hadn't been here recently, until yesterday for lunch with the family (to celebrate my husband's birthday). For Stripes members, complimentary chips and salsa. We- the adults- tried the 2 for $10 deal, entree, plus and appetizer or dessert. I got the chicken fingers (8 pieces) and fries/unseasoned- pretty large plate of food and potstickers (didn't dip it). I was trying to get the reasonable meal with the least amount of sodium damage (pregnant and watching my diet) so I was pretty much guessing (yeah, good luck to me, right?! just trying to find a happy medium). The potstickers were very good and tasty (6 pieces) though I didn't dip it in soy sauce. The fingers were heavily breaded and crispy, and though it was a large plate, would probably not order this again. I only had two pieces (took it home for my mom). The fries were skin-on, crispy, and thin. My husband got the angus burger- he really liked his burger, came with fries and the oreo madness (two pieces pretty much like mini ice cream sandwiches). Dessert was the best part- very good. This I would order again! (I'd probably order the korean tacos next time).  

My sister got the parmesan crusted chicken and peanut butter chocolate pie. Hers came with small cheese balls and tomatoes My sister said that her dessert was very rich, like a truffle, and only ate half, gave the rest to my older nephew. My brother-in-law got the burger (came with fries) and mozzarella sticks (these were flattened). My older nephew got the chicken fingers plate- he finished it (smaller than the adult plate), and my other nephew got the cheese pizza and fries plate (he didn't finish it, but he doesn't like eating burned food). They also had some mozzarella sticks. They also got kid-size milkshakes.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,o_xTQeeQrlgcxwDq_LP0QA

hell they got my order completely wrong before. the atmosphere is great if you like it loud like the bar. the jack daniel's sauce is fabulous. the steaks are good, the shrimp is good too. 


waiters/waitresses: showing off by not writing down my order will instantly lose your tip. it is not impressive when everytime it is wrong. and honestly if i wanted my s*%$ messed up i'd go to a fast food joint where nobody speaks english and take my chances there.

drinks refills: if i drink 2 glasses of whatever before my food comes, offer to leave a pitcher at the table or be prepared to run your ass off and not bitch about.

3rd: when we ask for something ""special"" as in not the way it is stated on the menu-do it!! i'm the one paying for this. i certainly don't feel i need to remind you when you bring my food out.

Finally a server came over and took our drinks which came pretty quick.  Our food order was taken and then we only saw her when she was standing at another table talking with some people she was just talking with, they had no other needs.

Our food came and we had to flag someone down for anything we needed from napkins, to sauces to refills on our drinks.  When we were done and wanting our bill, I had to flag down someone who looked like the manager and ask her for our bill as our server was no where to be found????

It pretty much a peach long island. I tasted it, all I could taste was peach syrup. My husband said the same thing. I told the server about it and she said ""ok"" .. she never offered to bring me something different. We told her we were both going to do the $10 endless apps. She said ""oh its not $10, its $12"" .. I pulled up the online advertisements that showed $10. She had her manager come over to tell us that they had changed the price a week ago but not everything is updated yet. Keep in mind there was a commercial on tv that day advertising it for $10. We ordered a few items. We looked at each other and laughed! I pulled up the online advertisements of what the food was supposed to look like, showed my husband and he shook his head. The food was bland and cold! We left a plate sitting there to show the server. It took her a while to come check on us and how our food was. We asked her if the cheese on the nachos was supposed to be chilled, she looked at us like we were stupid. The cheese sauce felt like it went from fridge to plate. The portion sizes are NOTHING like they advertise! Once the next round came out cold and disproportionate, we decided to take pictures of everything that we ordered. At this time, my drink has been empty for 13 minutes. I drank it since the server was unable to take it back. I asked for 2 waters, it took more than 10 minutes for us to get them. Once we decided that we were done, the server quickly got our check. She asked how everything was, we replied ""this is why we don't eat out that often."" We paid our bill and left.

I could see if the place was busy but it was really slow and it's a shame that I has wait so long.  

I will say this the draft glasses are amazing they're so cold the beer came out ice chilled one of the most refreshing beers I've had in a long time.   I had the spinach dip and the barbecue chicken flatbread.  The dishes were average however we did not have to wait long service in the food department was really good!

Today I am here with my husband and we have a coupon for a free entree so we're going to take advantage of it.  We started with an appetizer, the crab cakes, there are two cakes on the plate with a good dipping sauce.  The cakes are pretty good, you can taste the crab meat.

For an entree I got the salmon with lobster.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, however, it was to have a mushroom and lobster with alfredo sauce.  It was barely covered in sauce so it was slightly dry.  There were a ""glob"" of mushrooms all stuck together as if it was spooned out of a jar and thrown on top.  I asked for double vegetables instead of rice or potato to decrease some carbs and it was mostly broccoli, slightly undercooked. 

So as for my meal, I would say very disappointing, but for drinks and appetizers, it's not a bad place to meet.  Glad we had a coupon!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,4,ShJ2ftF1y6-afmiMcaqN6A

I'm Hangry and ready to scream...why you ask, BECAUSE SHE PUT ANOTHER lobster shell in front of me only this time with LESS lobster. So, then she said the grill is pulling it out.

One would come and take our drink orders and then the other would come and do the same thing just minutes later! Communication obviously doesn't happen here. or they were just making sure we had what we needed since the party was so big. Yeah...that was it!

Ordered the Wingmans burger. Which was not for myself but I was told the meat was kind of burnt on the outside. Excessively burnt. Still she enjoyed the wings but said the cream was waaay too salty. 

I ordered the BBQ bacon burger. Which was also a bit burnt but I don't think it was as much as the wingman. I enjoyed it not as good though. I remembered too late I wanted cheddar cheese. Lol okay. 

The manager however was there helping out the servers and some of them were very attentive. But next time ill send the burnt something back.",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,2,1,3,OFkrafQCBzudk624IjoH8g

Since then this location has went through an extensive renovation with remodeling. Unfortunately, the food nor the service (especially the service) wasn't like what it was back in the day.

The two times I've been here after the renovation, the first time our waiter was foreign and had a difficult time understanding what we wanted for our order. The wait on our appetizers and dinner was longer than expected, and the music during this time was turned up to a very uncomfortable volume (when requesting that they lowered it down in our section, nobody even cared to do so). The second time we returned, our waiter started out nice, but became very shrewd once he mixed up our order with someone else's. From that experience, I didn't want to come back to this location anymore, despite how much I loved it back in the day.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,0,2,2-GuVgQdJVtCgjpXthFo5A

There is always a problem.  !st time we ordered the 2 for $20.00 and each had a drink.. our bill was over $60.  When we asked the waitress she said ""ohhhhhhhh i rang it in as a regular order"".  This has happened twice.  Come on I wasnt born yesterday.  They are scamming so if you dont look over your bill your paying full price.  Then just this Saturday night 8/11/2012 we saw a 2 for $10 comercial and figured hey 10 bucks lets give it one more shot..  We were seated and given our menu's but no 2 for 10- menu when i asked for it they said they dont have the 2 for 10 anymore.  I said i just saw the commercial and its on your website.  She said we dont have that she then said they had a 3 for 20.  I looked over the 3 menu's they hand you and no 3 for 20 so i had to call her over and ask for it.  I then asked why isnt the 3 for 20 menu included with all these others. get this response "" ohhh if you dont ask for it we dont give it to you"" . I then asked for a manager and she dismissively informed me that on any specials if you dont know about it and ask for it they dont tell you about it..  Are you kidding me.  Needless to say we didnt ordered and i just paid for the drinks and left.  Also this place has gone down hill in the clean dept.  Floors dirty tables not cleaned.  What a joke I will never eat at a fridays again.  When we asked the manager for the corporate number we had to wait 10 mins for it and she doesnt even include her name on it we had to ask.

A server was slow to arrive at our table, and I had to get my own silverware from an adjoining table in order to have eating utensils.  My Iced Tea order was first forgotten, and when it finally did arrive  contained almost no ice.  One of my table-mates had food gunk visible on his initial knife, and loud chatter from adjoining tables mixed with too loud piped in music made it difficult to carry an understandable dinner conversation. 

Complimentary homemade tortilla chips for being a TGIF card holder were very good dipped in salsa, but our table was not bussed of empty appetizer dishes until almost at meal's end, and then only at our party's urging.  Worst of all, the waitress totally forgot to put in an order for a fellow diner's salad and cheesy chicken skillet, and then took at least 15 minutes just to bring the salad.  The entrée did not arrive until the rest of us were finishing ours.  

Onion Soup was good, except the cheese top floated on two croutons.  My Spicy Cajun Chicken & Shrimp Pasta dish was very tasty, and a Hot Fudge Sundae was good, and for once included enough hot fudge.  So, on this visit the food was good, but the service was decidedly not.

First the salad didn't even fill the plate. I asked if that was the correct size because there was no way that the salad that arrived was $13. We had to send it back in order to get more lettuce. He also said that the dressing was mayo based and not a traditional Cesar dressing. Due to the fact that the salad was smothered in the dressing it was inedible after my husband got half way thru. I ordered the jack Daniels ribs with French fries and broccoli. When my meal came I asked for my broccoli because it didn't come out with my food. Only after I asked was I told that they were out of broccoli and all veggies so they just decided to give me double French fries. My brother's girlfriend ordered the veggie burger and was less than impressed. My parents ordered hamburgers with French fries. The kitchen switched the hamburgers which made a huge difference since one ordered medium rare and the other ordered medium with a touch of pink. My father also got French fries with salt only and my mother got unseasoned French fries. Finally, the bathroom was disgusting. There were USED feminine products on the floor. The bathroom smelled terrible. It was a mess with paper towels all over the floor. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all. When we finished our meal we over heard the table next to us send back their steak because it was improperly cooked and cold. After our meal was done the plates just sat and sat and sat on the table.

They have a special that you have to ask for now by request only, as per our server they ripped it out of the menu. They must have been losing money as I think the special went over a bit too well lol. It is really a lot of food for $10 bucks!

The two for $10 menu is great, you get to select a main entree and have your choice of an appetizer or dessert. I had the new Korean tacos that come with Jasmine rice on the side. Three tacos very filling, the Korean beef is a bit sweet and the hint of chili sauce just makes it perfect. I will for sure order this again! I was in the mood for a salad so ordered that as my appetizer, it was a nice big wedge salad with bacon and tomatoes, very generous!

My sweetheart got the cheeseburger w/fries and selected cheese sticks as his side, very filling a full appetizer which is normally $7.99 alone. We both ordered the two for $10 special as you can't beat it!!!

Service was Amazing, we had Meagan as our server and she was Fantastic! Always dropping off a drink before we finished our previous one. I love refills on drinks without having to ever ask and she kept them coming! We sat in the bar as we wanted a booth and could watch TV during our dinner which were all of the sports games, basketball this night.
