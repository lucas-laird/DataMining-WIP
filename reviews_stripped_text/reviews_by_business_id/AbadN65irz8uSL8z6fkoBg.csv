I had salt and pepper fish again and I tried some tripe with a really delicious sauce they give you this is definitely handmade very very tasty .The service seems to just get better the food is really good great for the budget the kids love it and so do I.

I can tell the service is getting better and better every time I visit compare to the first time. However, there's no doubt when they get traffic, the servers are not able to fill my water or offer another coke. But if you ask for it, they are glad to fill. Also, the food there really worths for the price. Most of the food costs around 6-15, and comes a lot.",fCEGYl_RTrpfZ6D2ag2vRg,0,0,5,GfkST6r4Wxg5s79ceWNk4w

We were seated as soon as one of the wait staff saw us and were brought hot tea. We had to ask for water and cokes are served in the can with a straw and no glass. The food came out relatively quickly: House Special roasted pork, garlic beef, walnut shrimp, fried rice, and steamed rice. Everything was just fine--nothing to shout out loud for, but nothing below mediocre either. The food was not too greasy or salty. Although the pork was somewhat dry, everything was okay. The staff didn't rush us, but they didn't refill our water or offer us another soda either.

All in all, the food was good enough to come back another time, especially at the low prices. Only the walnut shrimp portion seemed small. All of the other orders had large portions for the price. It's a typical Chinatown restaurant and a traditional Chinatown experience complete with ducks hanging at the counter. Don't expect perfect service.

My wife often says I have no clue so I'll have to say I can tolerate even mediocre Chinese food and think it's not too bad. But this place? It was bad. REAL bad. I guess in Chinese it's called Number One BBQ and in English it's BBQ King -- kinda similar don't you agree? The food was anything but that. It was no King, no Queen, no Ace. It was a Joker! That's what it was. Honestly, bbq pork is better in Irvine and even Irvine is not good for Chinese food.

Maybe that's why there weren't many people in this place when we ate here? Maybe it's the food. Maybe it's their rude attitude. Whatever reason people have for not eating here, they've good reason not to. It's really quite awful.",7JLmEwpz7uFmV-z1XziXgw,3,1,1,iy3PjDn3LLbHJmcTo1ANNQ

This is my third review for this place.

New ownership and management since December 2013.
Much cleaner and friendlier; food and BBQ items are very good.

Tho i have to comment that this place highly have consistency issues because, there were times where ordered wonton noodle, there was no salt in it at all.  Another time I can be there and order the same wonton noodle, and i can be really salty.  Not sure if the chef have temper issues and like to take it off their customers but dude, if you cannot even season your soup correctly at your job, i'm pretty sure this guy hates the job itself, therefore effect the quality of food that they produce.  

I don't make good fried chinese doughnuts, they are never freshly fried.  I don't know if there are any places in vegas that make freshly fried doughnuts.  

Over all, I would come back to this place just because it's one of the cheaper HK style chinese food places in vegas.  they also have togo section, but the food there is really expensive.  But there's no other place in vegas to buy stuff from so, we really have no choice but to get ripped off.

The restaurant is tiny (you may have to share a table with strangers), the service is horrible (the waiters are constantly yelling at each other in Cantonese), reminds me of eating in HK. Well, except the food here is 2x the price and half as good. Nonetheless, we come here whenever we want cheap Chinese food. Here's what we've tried:

BBQ Pork - Crispy skin, some fat, a little meat. Not bad.
BBQ duck egg noodle soup - Duck had been sitting out too long and there wasn't a lot of meat. Noodles were just firm enough and the broth was pretty flavorful.
Shrimp Fried Rice - Bland and dry.
Braised tofu with bok choy & mushrooms - The braised tofu was the best part. The sauce was a bit slimy, probably too much cornstarch.",lFOdzMVUA1E2WOhxGX9whQ,0,0,3,UBBAUvhMzDHUL95n2lNXSw

just another non-descript chinese restaurant on spring mtn.  as you walk in you see the ducks hanging by the neck under the heat lamp and some pre-made cafeteria style dishes that according to the gf , are appetizer and ""to-go"" food - one of the items she sees that gets her fired up - chili-infused pork stomach - yummy ?!?!

we order the pork stomach dish, a beef noodle dish, some chinese greens and ""chinese""bbq Chicken.

after we order the food is on the table in geez, 3 minutes ?  that actually bothers me - i don't care how hot the wok is in the kitchen, too much of the ingredients must be pre cooked, pre-everything to get the grub to us so quickly.

the beef noodles - boring very, boring and the beef has the smell of  the 1/2 price selections at  the supermarket - not too fresh.  also too much oil used in cooking the dish.  the greens - nothing special.

the bbq chicken - i don't get it.  it was apparently ""bbq'd"" then flash fried in the wok - the bone to met ratio way too high, decent flavor thoiugh.

the pork stomach - it includes a small l]pile of the  bbq duck - the duck had no seasoning to it, nothing to it.  the pork stomach - reminds me of calamari in texture - some pieces very tender, others, very chewy - but some nice kick from the chili - an ok dish.

Roast duck itself is already $24, plus another 1/2 pound of pig ears for i think $5. 

Duck was very meaty and the skin was crispy even after i got home. Though very rarely we'd eat it as soon as it gets home. Flavorful and yummy. Always ask for the plum sauce that comes with it. Good with duck or with rice haha XD The duck juice good for moisturizing the meat or making duck noodle soup.

The roast duck is well marinated, flavorful and duck meat is perfectly cooked. You can tell you are eating duck from the Integrity of the roast duck's meat texture and innate sweetness. The roast pork is tender as if it's from a sucking pig and is marinated with just  the right amount of spices and seasoning...good crunch on the pork skin.

My favorite dishes here are the Crispy Pork Belly and Peking Duck! The pork Belly is so juicy with the skin being Crispy! When you take a bite the flavors are amazing! The Peking Duck is to die for! They make the skin so Crispy that when you add that to the bun and sauce you just can't get enough! 

The prices here I feel are cheaper than other Chinese restaurants which makes it attractive to come here. They have a great Lunch Special so definitely check it out!

The venue is where I would rate this low. It's a small restaurant and it's just very basic in design. Yes the food is awesome but there is so much movement within customer pick ups that it can get loud being that it's small. It's really a place to eat and then go! 

The service is ok. Sometimes they get so busy that they forget to check up on you. So sometimes your drinks or extra napkins may take longer to get!

This restaurant is great for authentic Chinese food, but at the same time I understand a lot of the negative reviews, particularly the complaints about customer service and cleanliness. This isn't the place you want to go if you're looking for a highly attentive waiter/waitress and a pristine eating environment. That said, there are some seriously good dishes that I think make the negatives worth putting up with! I always order their chow fun with XO sauce (this dish is really like mini versions of the rice noodle rolls you'll see in dim sum places rather than what you picture when you think of chow fun) and it never disappoints. I second everyone who suggests coming with someone who speaks Cantonese--it makes the ordering process a lot easier and it's helped us find a gem of a dish, too! My student wanted to try one of their fish dishes and the waitress told her it was no longer available and after an extensive conversation in Cantonese, my student told me we'd be having something else that wasn't on the menu. It's fried fish in a garlic sort of seasoning/sauce and I have no idea how to describe except the fish is always perfect, moist and tender, with breading that's light but crisp every time! We've ordered it on every visit since then and I'll be updating my Yelp review when I find out a proper name for it, because it's AMAZING. Now any time I have fish elsewhere, I'm a little disappointed.

You get free soup with your meal and while I like the stock and have some every time, I find the meat tends to be really dry/overcooked in general, so keep your expectations low for that. Jasmine tea also comes standard and it's always perfect, never too bitter! I would not recommend the duck, because it was way, way too salty--even for duck--when we ordered it. Their kung pao chicken is hit or miss, great when it's a hit and really blah when it's a miss. All in all, this is the kind of restaurant I go to with tried and true favorites in mind.

Lastly, be aware if you order anything to go, there will be an additional $1-2 charge for take out, even if you're currently eating in the restaurant and just ordering something extra to take home with you!",7WgmtfyZ4eBKNFJ2T5w4YQ,3,2,4,5s1xmiE8puGQghv-qX78OQ

Food: the price is pretty affordable ranging from $6-10 per plate. We got the porridge which I would recommend. Besides that, the meat there wasn't fresh nor were the veggies. 

Service: first off I'm not from around here, but shouldn't the waiters and waitress understand English? The waitress was very rude and was giving us attitude. After we ordered what we wanted, she said, ""is that even enough?"" .. since she said that, we ordered a 4th platter since she kept insisting it wasn't enough for a table of 3. 

Secondly, when the guy came to deliver our food, I asked for a straw for my water and three bowls to share the porridge. He came back not only with the wrong utensils, but telling us he doesn't understand English. Are you kidding with me? He could of made it easier and said it in the beginning instead of making two trips just to let us know he doesn't understand English. 

Lastly, the last platter we order came after we finished the other 3 we ordered. We were going to cancel the order, but the lady came and told us how there was a phone order and our food was left on the counter. Well if you guys are that busy then hire more workers.

Unlike Sam Woo BBQ, where they give you attitude if you want a certain cut of the meat, BBQ King has always accomodated my requests.

As for other chinese items on the menu, they are just average, but very inexpensive. My only disappointment is that they no longer offer Pei Par (peking style) ducks due ot low demand.

I think they're CASH ONLY restaurant, so remember to bring some cold hard cash =)",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,3,ypgN3mptShkFH6nh6-UcjQ

Being that I'm from Seattle, I'm use to paying no more than $15 dollars for a roast duck and $7 dollars a pound for roast pork.  The prices here were significantly inflated on the BBQ items.  However the prices for the dishes were dirt cheap, most dishes were under $10 dollars, even the seafood dishes.  Those prices were pretty amazing!  Overall, I thought the food was very mediocre, we ordered over $140 dollars of take-out to feed our group after a night of clubbing.  The service was friendly, abit slow.  I don't think they realized that I understood the workers talking when they were speaking Cantonese and telling the cooks to make the dishes for the dine-in customers first and put our to-go order on hold.  - 1 star for that!

Over all the food was ok, nothing to write home about.  The beef chow fun was dry and the roast duck not meaty.  The skin on the roast pork was really crunchy so that was good.  However the rest of our dishes was just eh....",XTjZqAe1MGsOJ9PyLZUW3A,0,0,2,TaFj2fkc87OIbzXDOe25Vw

BBQ pork was orange in color and had no taste. Roast duck was fatty and unseasoned. Did they truly expect every person to dip the duck into the plum sauce? What if you don't like plum sauce? The ratio of meat to rice was amazingly vast -- 70% rice to 30% meat. 

We also ordered the wontons in soup -- wontons were not anything special. The accompanying broth was overwhelmingly fishy. 

When I asked the waitress (in Cantonese) if they accepted credit card, she barked ""for a little over $10???? PAY CASH!!!""

YES MAAM! I paid and left hurriedly! Never returning.",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,13,8,1,jva96z4XsBo4syTDLdrV1Q

For dinner, we got the set dinner option for 4 people and everything was pretty good. The bbq items we got were roasted duck and roasted pork. The pork skin was crispy, duck was juicy, and everything seemed really fresh. The walnut prawns were very good, the batter was light but crispy and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and still maintained that crispy texture. The stuffed eggplant and bell peppers were saucy and flavorful without being overly salty. The meal also came with complimentary soup and dessert. 

The second time I went was for lunch. I ordered the lunch special of two item bbq with rice and their pork belly with rice. The bbq items did not seem fresh to me at all. The pork skin wasn't that crispy and it has a lot of burnt edges. The duck was ok but every dish came out cold like it was left out for a while.

Few things... servers speak little English, so it helps to have someone who speaks Cantonese to come with you to order.  Second, it's not a fancy restaurant, go to Sam Woo for a nicer enviroment but the food is more expensive and not as good.

When you walk in they quickly seat you and hand you a menu. Tea conjures and they take your order, and the food is served quickly. The dishes are inexpensive but they're not exactly to-drool-for delicious. But hey, you get what you pay for, which is decent food that will fill you up. 

My family also comes here often to get Chinese BBQ to-go and we've had really good experiences with them. The BBQ pork is always really good, though the BBQ pork or roast duck is a hit or miss 70/30 of the time. Be adventurous and try the soy sauce chicken as well.

BBQ King is more of a hole in the wall and there's not much decor inside, but you'll leave the restaurant feeling satisfied.",s7XUDb3zT-7u1_5lySqvKg,1,0,3,PlltsZds9DVrUL2AQaQgPA

The broth to the soup however had no taste and the noodles were kinda hard. My boyfriend ordered duck and basically ate the whole thing. He really liked it. It was good but I've tasted tastier duck at Sam Woo. The sweet and sour soup was just as named. And the crispy noodles were thin and crispy. 

The customer service was good. They were nice and accommodating and continuously cleaning our table off because we did order a lot and it got pretty messy. They were also filling up waters constantly so no problem there. 

Their bathrooms were okay. And there was a cart full of dirty dishes by our table, I wasn't so sure about that. But they did clean it out every so often. Didn't really bother us but I was just wondering if that was supposed to go there in the first place.
