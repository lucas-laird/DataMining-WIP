They have a daily lunch special from 11-3 daily that includes a frozen margarita, fideo soup, and your choice of two items to make up your entree that comes with rice and beans. The chips and salsa also come with bean dip and guac.

I have had the carne asada tampiquena which was good, as well as cheese enchilada and pork tamale which I also enjoyed. They went a little masa heavy on the tamale but the meat was great.

I am not saying you don't have to get a starter but I don't sometimes due to the fact I have had most of them (great by the way) and I gorge myself on the trio mentioned above.

We've always enjoyed the food for the value and we've referred countless friends to the restaurant.  We ate there tonight for an early Father's Day celebration.  We were shocked to learn that when we requested more chips and salsa, we'd be charged $7.95 for the next round.  Huh?  Then my mom requested a little extra lettuce with her taco and she was informed that would cost $1.75.  At that we asked for the manager.  We have never incurred such charges before and the manager, who was not the regular manager we're accustomed to dealing with, told us they have been charging for those items for a long time.  Wrong!  We have never once been charged for extra chips and salsa or for a little extra lettuce.  Although we enjoyed our meals, to the tune of $80 with tip for 4, I don't think we'll be coming back here any time soon.  I understand times are tough, but come on!  We're not the type of folks who complain about paying money for decent food and we tip well.

It was our first night at the South Point and the only reason we stayed was because my parents were curious about it.  I work like a dog as a bartender in a Mexican Food restaurant and I was excited to start my night off at a place that seems highly recommended.  
We got to the host stand and a little old lady greeted us but had very little personality.  She gave us a buzzer and told us it would be about a 20-30 minute wait.  That's cool cause I'm on vacation and I am in no rush.  We get seated and a busser promptly asks us if we want something to drink so I get a margarita on the rocks, my girlfriend gets an iced tea, and our 9 year old son gets a virgin piña colada.  About 5 minutes later Vicente shows up and asks what we want to drink and the busser tells him.  That seems off that they have a busser ask when it is the waiters responsibility.  We eventually get our drinks and the margarita was strong and I was in a great mood.  Vicente took some time to get to us and we got our food orders in.  Now we have our food and it is just okay.  We get our bill and I give Vicente the free margarita coupon the hotel gives you in those silly discount books you pay for with the stupid hotel fee.  He gets mad and says ""what is that?"" I tell him and he gets even more upset and calls over the manager and says ""what am I suppossed to do with this?""  The manager miraculously gives me the free margarita.  Turns out the free margarita is suppossed to be given to them before you order so that they can give you the water down garbage.  I got the real deal and that irked Vicente quite a bit it looks like.  So if you want a real margarita and can take Vicentes funky little attitude then give him the coupon at the end.  I told the manager how he acted and her and some other server acted like they could care less.  Thanks Baja Miguel!",OcR2p6_-yRF6zOVgf-tP1A,1,0,1,9KFavdnbzjduBWMk0gY2ug

The carne asada however, was about as good as I could imagine--lot's of good flavor. My wife had the shrimp tacos and kind of gave them an 'ehhh'. Overall, three stars for me.

1708666,2013-06-10,0,Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg,"Baja Miguel's is like a Chi-Chi's.  That is not meant as a compliment or a slam.  It is simply a restaurant that provides adequate Mexican dishes in a setting that mildly tips its hat to Mexican heritage, for a modest price.

They take reservations on Open Table (there is a link to it from the Yelp review page, or you can use the Open Table app), which should help with those reviewers who complained about the wait.

Set upstairs in the South Point casino in a windowless chamber, the decorators did their best with what they had to work with.  There is a pink sunset painted on the far wall as you enter, with french doors to simulate the existence of the outdoors.  

Contrary to other reviewers, our servers were neither inattentive nor doting; they came by periodically, provided what we needed within a reasonable time of being asked, but occasionally we found ourselves waiting for one thing or another.

The food was fine.  Not knock-your-socks-off great, nor revoltingly bad, just ok.  As I wrote above - about the quality one would expect to find at a Chi-Chi's (BTW, for those of you who don't get the reference, Chi-Chi's was a mediocre chain of Mexican restaurants that went out of business in the U.S., but can still be found in Europe, where they still don't know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like).

Anyway, bottom line, if you're in the market for a just-ok Mexican meal, for a so-so price, Baja Miguel's is a fine choice.  I would go again.",757SsX4iVOhVz95OAdslWg,0,0,3,WNfCGdUvSLk65M6H1hDwmg

Almost immediately, one of our servers brought a basket of chips with three dipping sauces: guacamole, salsa and refried beans. The salsa was very tasty but a little spicier than I cared for. The guacamole and the beans were absolutely delicious. My wife and I decided to share an order of  chicken fajitas. Because we were sharing the server brought us an extra potion of tortillas at no charge. The sizzling platter was filled with chicken, sauteed onions, and sliced peppers. They also had sides of sour cream, guacamole, beans, and rice. The flour tortillas with fresh and incredibly tasty. Overall it made for a absolutely terrific meal.

We tried strawberry and raspberry frozen margaritas first and they where good. Not too strong but delicious and not too sweet.

I explained to her that our waiter Bryan was either over assigned for the evening or lacking training.
That appetizers are to come out before a meal. A 2nd roud of drinks should not take TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES after ordering and a reminder request, to arrive to the table.
The tortillas that should ACCOMPANY fajitas, should not arive 15 meals after the rest of the meal.

The food was great.  I had shredded beef tacos and a chicken enchilada and both were full of flavor with generous portions.  The 3 entree plate tempted me but the server noticed my slight stature and recommended the 2 entree plate which was a great recommendation because there was plenty of food.
The Grandview (next store) has coupon books that include a free frozen drink with your entree and the kids enjoyed the frozen drinks.
We had 3 kids under 10 and there weren't any selections designed for kids.  The best alternative was a cheese quesadilla.

I ordered the albondigas soup.  I've had it at many places homemade and restaurant.   Every place seems to follow a basic core recipe:  vegetables, meatballs, and broth.  The soup was luke warm, like it has been sitting from a previous order.  The consistency was like an old marinara sauce and a lot, a lot, a lot of salt to taste.

My girlfriend had a taco and enchilada combination dinner.  Again way to much salt to taste even more than the usual expected amount in this dish.  And you could tell by looking at the refried beans that the dish had been sitting prior for a while.

The dining area offers tables and chairs or booths-it's always nice to have the option. We were seated at a booth and within just a minute or two we had chips, salsa, guac, and beans on our table. I loved the taste of the salsa-not too spicy, but very flavorful. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas with our coupon from South Point (good for free margaritas), which we found to be just okay. To me it tasted like a margarita mix and I've definitely had better. My husband and I both ordered an entree, which included beans and rice. The portion sizes are pretty generous, but I was a bit disappointed with the taste of my chicken enchiladas, which didn't seem to have any flavor. I enjoyed the rice and beans, but couldn't finish my enchiladas, even when I added sour cream. The service here was great-our waiter was very friendly and attentive, which we appreciated.

First off, the starting chips & dip...I can't even.  I crave that bean dip at least once every week.  It is so amazing!  The guac & salsa that accompany it are both good as well, but the bean dip is where it's at.  In fact, I would be happy with a couple margaritas and that dip, but I don't know when to say when, so I always overdo it with the dining and end up full and feeling like a stuffed pig.

I was generous with my rating, because my boyfriend thought that the Shrimp Diablo dish was the best Mexican food that he has ever eaten. Ever! He definitely wants to come back here. I had a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combo. It was good, but nothing extra special. It certainly wasn't something that would make me want to rush back.

They do make great tortilla chips that are very light and salty, served with a dipping trio of salsa, beans and guacamole. Very good.

I have several margaritas at the bar during our trip and they were strong and cheap.

My biggest impression of South Point was the inexpensive food and alcohol. Stay here and feast for pennies. Seriously great values to be had and most of the food was good too. 

The decor looks like something from a cruise ship, especially the bar outside of the restaurant. Garish color scheme and just bad design. The restaurant was also kept ridiculously cold and I spent the meal shivering.

Our service was fine - it's not a five star dining establishment but we were well taken care of and the drinks and food arrived in a timely manner.  
The obligatory Mexican restaurant chips and salsa are kicked up quite a few notches with the addition of bean dip and guacamole along with it.  It was all so good and a nice addition to the run of the mill offerings at most joints.  
My husband got steak fajitas and while they were decent, he wasn't particularly impressed.  
I, however, opted for the Frontera Special and they really hit it out of the park!  It was two nicely sized filet mignon that were topped with shrimp and then everything was covered in this sauce that was nothing like I had ever tasted.  They called it a creamy chipotle sauce and it was just perfect paired with the steak and shrimp.  It wasn't overly spicy at all - it was creamy and flavorful and complimented the beef and seafood so well.  
Every entree comes with a cup of fideo soup.  It was decent but I've had far better.
The prices are definitely more than your average Mexican restaurant; tip included, we spent about $50 and we don't drink so that didn't include alcohol.  
The restaurant itself is upstairs so you get the sense that you're away from all the slot machines and smoke.  There are plenty of tables and booths and a central bar located outside the main entrance.

3018373,2012-12-20,5,Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg,"For the first time in my entire life, I instructed my party NOT to leave a tip and they reacted by counting out COINS so that we could pay the bill for this would-be meal and ensure that the wait staff was aware that we hadn't forgotten a tip, but simply that they had not earned one from us.

We had a party of four meeting up at this location to grab a quick bite before our movie began at 7:00.  Two of us showed up first and were brought to our seats.  An older gentleman came up to our table and asked for our drink orders...and then a younger gentleman came up a minute later for our drink orders.  I informed him that we had already been helped and thanked him.  After a few minutes, our original server brought out our drinks and a basket of tortilla chips with a tray or salsa, bean dip and guacamole to munch on.  This is one of the things I love about Mexican food restaurants, it's their version of a bread basket and it works so well, for me, because I love salsa and chips.

After about ten more minutes, another of our party showed up and the same thing happened as before.  Older gentlemen gets her drink order and then the younger one does the same thing.  I'm curious, are they really so overstaffed that they need two people to check up on each other or are they just unaware of which sections each is supposed to cover?  No matter, since we were splitting the bill and crunched for time (and our fourth party was stuck in traffic), we order two appetizers to split.  

After we ordered, my best friend noticed that our salsa, bean dip and guacamole was almost empty and the older gentleman was at our table so she asked him to send us a new one.  He looked directly at her as she made the request and then just turned around and walked away.  She gave his retreating back a funny look and then noticed that the younger gentleman was about to pass our table and stopped him for the same request.  He got a very nervous looks on his face, shook his head and informed us that this wasn't his section and he'd send our server over.  Really?  Then why were you asking for our drink orders and serving the two tables to the left and right of us?

The older server came out with his stern face in place and snidely informed my best friend that only the first bowl of salsa and dip is free, afterwards he would have to charge us $7.95.  Just so that everybody is aware, that's the price of an appetizer at this location.  My friend literally laughed at him and waved him away after I had informed him that this would be our once and only visit to this restaurant.  It amazes me that $7.95 is worth the loss of what might have been a repeat customer.

After we ate, the older server handed us our bill of $25.30 and my two companions literally counted out 25 dollars and three dimes while I wrote on the note that they should be on the lookout for my upcoming one star yelp review and that the service was so horrible that I would not be back.  Three servers saw that I was writing on the bill and pointed us out in front of the restaurant while they whispered vehemently about us.  To top everything off, the server came and snatched up what we had left before we were even out of the booth and gave us a cold sneer for our ""generosity.""  

It's actually a crying shame that I won't be back to this restaurant, especially in a town like Las Vegas where there can't be that many more Mexican food restaurants that would be willing to bestow decent service on a paying customer...right?",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,8,0,1,Z5YQFDLQpqT8Cankz3dfLw

The first thing I noticed about Baja Miguel's is that it looks more like a cafe than a Mexican restaurant. The colours, decor and layout of the tables doesn't make for the most intimate setting.

Before our meal we were given Salsa, bean dip and guacamole. I can't comment on the guac since neither of us like it - The salsa was good but the bean dip was revolting.

I ordered the shredded beef nachos and my wife had cheese enchiladas.  The best way I can describe the food is ""Pedestrian"" - sort of like what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  The beef on my nachos was a bit sloppy and my wife described her food as ""ok, but nothing id ever crave again"".

In a city with so many cheap Mexican options, give Baja Miguel's a big miss. The food is OK, but when you have similarly cheap fare all over town, usually of much higher quality, I don't see any reason to go here again.

My husband and I were staying at South Point and, as semi-vegetarians, decided that going to the Mexican restaurant would be the safest bet for dinner.  Oh no.  No no no.  When we walked in and saw the cheesy Denny's/Olive Garden style decor, we should have turned around and walked right back out.

There are no drink prices on the menu, nor is there a drink menu.  When we asked how much a Corona was, we were given a range of 'between $4-6'.  Huh?  Are we bartering here?  They then brought out the chips and dips.  Of the three, the salsa is terrible, the guac is meh and the bean dip was just okay.  We ordered the ceviche and received a bland, waterlogged dish of previously frozen fish.  Yum.  Eventually we received our main meals, and I was soooooo happy I went with the safe cheese enchiladas.  It wasn't memorable by any means, but it was 1000 times better than what my husband got.  He ordered a veggie burrito.  It is really hard to screw up a veggie burrito, and even a bad veggie burrito is usually still edible.  This thing though ... looked okay on the outside, but when my husband cut in to it he discovered that his burrito was comprised of three things: steamed carrots, cauliflower and broccoli.  Nothing else.   You may have purchased a similar vegetable blend in a bag from the frozen section of your grocery store.  Steamed carrots, cauliflower and broccoli are not burrito ingredients, not even a little bit.  No amount of hot sauce could save this burrito, we just spent the rest of the meal looking at it and cracking up.

When staying at South Point, save your money and order a pizza or take the time and drive to a decent restaurant elsewhere.  I cannot believe we actually paid money for a steamed cauliflower burrito.",8LSIWHsCs4rMTf267BPFdQ,3,0,1,5sYIHMf-wp-3GG5MbDc9HQ

I was here with my family (wife and two kids), and the food was decent...except for my daughter's Taco Salad ""with Chicken.""  It was ice cold and there was no chicken.  It was so bad that I asked for it to be removed from our bill, and said we would order dessert to make up for that.  The waiter never removed it from my bill, said he couldn't do it, and had to ask the manager.

The manager was perhaps the WORST manager I've ever dealt with.  She acknowledged the issues with the food but said she would only take half off.  I went back and and forth with her politely, and she only refunded the entire amount after the waiter voluntarily went back to her AGAIN.  I literally saw her walk by our table SHAKING HER HEAD.  I guess ""how dare a guest not like the food"" was something she never dealt with before.

This experience soured me enough to never go back to this restaurant, and I'm not sure I'll stay at the South Point again.

If you don't have issues with your food, it's okay.  If you do, don't expect to be treated fairly.",Gdm3fu8g9GNOJFUnUegKIw,1,0,2,vatJCkKmKvjN7eh2aX4a5w

Came here for dinner on Thursday. 
The hostess, Lucy that sat us in a booth was very friendly.
The complimentary chips were nice and hot. Came with, salsa, bean dip and guacamole. Wasn't bad at all!!
I ordered Frontera Special. I wasn't expecting the food to be great because of 3 star on Yelp and a lot of people had bad experience here. Actually, my steak was very tender and lean. The red sauce that came with it was so good. (salty but good)
Only thing was the shrimp fajita wasn't sizzling and smoking like the other Mexican restaurants'.

She brought waters for the table. Then the server arrived, welcomed us brought fresh, warm chips and a trio of warm refried beans, salsa and guacamole. You had me at chips, salsa and guacamole, beans too... yes! I asked for the spicy salsa. He brought out a delicious fire roasted salsa that went so well with the spinach and mushroom enchiladas topped with guacamole and sour cream. The food was good, cheesy enchiladas, rice and beans and the salsa made it for me. My friends enjoyed their dishes and we all left satisfied. I took away leftovers that made for a tasty breakfast the next morning. Back to the free margies, I had a margarita salt on the rocks, my friends ordered blended, raspberry and mango. The blended is the better option here unless you upgrade from the house margarita (mine tasted like pure margarita mix). But hey it was free so I'm not complaining.

4 of us sat down at a booth, as the guy brings the chips and salsa I requested an extra salsa so we didn't need to reach. He responds by saying only one is complimentary....Are kidding me? 

We all order our meals and then we noticed the lunch special which tossed in a margarita and some fideo soup and were bummed we didn't see it sooner. The server comes out with our soup and margaritas and says she ran em through as the special to take care of..kudos to young lady.

The soup was a the typical cheapo tomato juiced wannabe soup. Wasn't horrible, just not special. I think it is sold in 50 gallon barrels as I swear I have experienced that before several times.

The margarita, was a limeade slushy. Absolutely 0 tequila.

When the food came out we had everything from shredded chicken tacos, to Diablo seafood, to chile relleno.

The Relleno was like a soggy egg pancake, the chicken was as bland as could be. I mean, even if you cook chicken plain it has more flavor than that. The scallops of the seafood diablo were chewy and fishy so I am guessing frozen, then thawed too early, then served.

This food was redic. Do not go here.

The food is mediocre, nothing spectacular. I had the enchiladas suizas, which were tasty but nothing spectacular. My daughter ordered the beef tamales which were mostly masa and not enough beef. My husband had the carne asada burrito but wasn't excited about it. The one thing I did enjoy was the Taquitos appetizer, the shredded beef was delicious and the taquitos were not overcooked. Crunchy not soft. Another thing I enjoyed was that they give you chips with not only salsa but also beans and guacamole for starters so bam right there you already have nachos!!

One disappointment was their drinks selection, we asked if they had any horchata, tamarindo, etc and they don't. Our nice waiter even explained we weren't the first to ask about those drinks, maybe it's something they can look into, I mean come on, even Am Pm offers them.

There is not much taste in any dish that I have tried there(because of my parents I have eaten there a few times).

Great mexican food, family friendly environment, clean restaurant and nice staff...and SUPER FAST SERVICE

I'm all about food, and I live in a state where some of the best eateries can be found.  Surprising note, you always find them in the most LOW-KEY places.  For me, Baja Miguel's is one the these places...diamond in the rough.

Chips and the TRIO (beans, guac, salsa) was placed in front of us 5mins into be seated.  As the same time that the young lady delivered chips she also introduced herself and took our drink orders.  Maybe another 5mins and we were sipping on our drink.  The server came and took our order, I order the Pork Tamales with red sauce served with rice and beans.

10-15mins hot plate of food in my face, yep I was a very happy fat girl.  The portions are decent, if I wasn't being greedy that could have easily fed 2.  My favorite part of tamales is the maza, the texture has to be right.  Not too creamy and not crumble where it just break apart in rough pieces.  You fork should just slice into the tamale with no effort, and that's EXACTLY how these tamales were.  But let's not stop there, because if the meat is not season and/nor cooked right then the entire dish is ruin.  Um yea, and dousing red sauce doesn't help.  However, this is NOT the case here, the pork was seasoned well and tender. The sauce made it perfect, not too MUCH, just enough.  You can taste all the layers without them overpowering each other.  

The PERFECT BITE, load your fork with a little tamale, bean, rice and sauce (don't overload your fork, enough to get everything in one bite) Stack your fork and it's FOODIE bliss, add some crunch with a chip and take a sip of you drink. I don't know, mexican food is totally elevated to a different level when it is paired with a TEQUILLA base beverage, but that;s just me.  

$25 including tip, yes I will be back...but this is just my opinion, go check them out and see for yourself",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,2,1,4,3z38yd8dc6E9XWZ--QyQHw

I had the carne la plancha with beans and rice and it wasn't that good. The meat looked and had the texture of cat food. My boyfriend had the flautas and he really enjoyed them.

I noticed they put sour cream in the guacamole. I've never seen that before, but perhaps it's a regional thing. 

Our server was very kind, thoughtful and competent. The fellow that bussed the table and refilled our water glasses was respectful and unobtrusive.

       - Lunch Special - They have a lunch special for $8.95 Wednesday through Sunday. It's a really good deal and includes a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=1m4c2eotnlfsD3whZLohoA).
       - Chips and Dips - You're given a chips with beans, salsa, and guacamole (all house made) when you're seated. You can see the chunks of avocado in the guac. It's delicious (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=qP5qEupOH8WAHq0wXYHgdw).
       - Fideo soup - You receive fideo soup with almost every order. It's a salty tomato based soup with angel hair pasta in it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=c_Fo6l5F1uAeLg0MWAWbDQ).
**Ordered**
       - $14.95 Rib-eye Skillet - The steak was juicy but had a tomato flavor that I didn't believe steak should have (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg?select=w3lbn27Wn_UTSDAlGJiRQw).

This place is located within the South Point Hotel, upstairs next to Primarily Prime Rib. The decor is nothing spectacular.  I was there before my bowling league around 4:45 on a Sunday night and it wasn't crowded at all.  The host was friendly and we were seated immediately.

A Server was quick to bring us chips/salsa/bean dip and guacamole and take our drink order.  The salsa was not very good - I like my salsa hot, and this tasted like it was out of bottle (think Pace Picante Sauce).  The bean dip was pretty good, and I was surprised to see the small scoop of guac along with the chips.  It was only OK.

Well, I noticed that they have a lunch special, which happens to go until 5pm (we were just under the wire)...It was $9.95 for a 2 item combo (you get to choose the 2 items), rice/beans (of course), fideo soup and a margarita or soda. I don't drink tequila, so I got a virgin margarita and my friend got a marg on the rocks. She had already ordered a soda, but didn't know that the marg would be included with her meal, and the server ended up not charging us for her soda, which I thought was nice.

I got the combo with a cheese enchilada and chile relleno and my friend got a beef taco and a cheese enchilada.  My enchilada was super cheesy and good, but it is pretty hard to screw them up, especially in a place called Baja Miguel's.  My chile relleno was one of the strangest I've EVER had. And I've eaten a lot of Mexican food in my day.  I am not saying it was bad, it was just different.  And different was not necessarily what I was looking for when I ordered that item.  Instead of being a chile stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried, it was more like an egg/chile casserole.  It was just strange. And not spicy at all.  The beans and rice were pretty typical, nothing exciting there.  The fideo soup was pretty decent.  I actually liked it better than the soup they served at Lindo Michoacan (which isn't really saying too much).

The service was super friendly and fast and we were in and out of there pretty quickly.  I would go back, and I would probably order the combo again, but I would try something different.

I didn't really have high expectations when we went it, and I ended up pretty happy, so I can't complain.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,0,3,dlVOFGPuMhZmOouDSwkhOw

Ground beef tacos very large and not skimpy on the meat.  I really like the presentation as well.  Chips and salsa is free and also comes with guacamole and refried beans.  5+ stars for that as well.  Service was also fast and friendly and I highly recommend this place if you are eating beef options.",nHWSRO8_kNxv_fGs6FIcng,0,0,5,53axitcnP7oG9fo3SbINPA

I feel as though I am a chimichanga connoisseur. The flavor of the chicken chimichanga was good. The chimi was not crispy which h I like. The rest of the family liked their food

They said hou don't get the chips when itsqto go, same price for the meal  it no chips. They went and asked someone else and came back and   and said again no chips. I couldn't believe the rudeness.

5960014,2012-12-13,2,Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg,"Our department decided to try this place for dinner after a fun time of bingo. 

The restaurant was filled to the gills with cowboys because of NFR, but they were able to find us a table even though we were an hour early for our reservation. The service was pretty good. Our drinks were refilled often. The food wasn't fantastic, although I didn't have very high expectations of the place. 

The chips and salsa were pretty disappointing. Totally flavorless. Everyone added tapatio to it to for more flavor. I ordered the pork adobo and it was ok. Nothing amazing, but it was edible. I only ate about a quarter of it and didn't feel I had missed anything. The rest of my party was pretty disappointed with their food. They know I Yelp and asked what I would rate the place and each of them gave their own star rating. I have to say most of them said two star, but I give kudos for the good service and since I actually thought my meal was ok. I rounded up for the attentive and accommodating service.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,zKZBSKDEkVyioi9cretGzA

5984704,2016-09-15,0,Oto60yDwk1z72WmfWEYrjg,"Don't waste your time here.  This place was an absolute joke and the service and the food were terrible.

I was almost tempted to give it 2 stars because the drink waiter was great and the chips and dip you are served in the beginning are good.  But it was a steep downhill spiral from there and I want to discourage people from wasting their money here with all the other good places to eat.

First, apparently the center pieces on all of the tables in the restaurant telling you about their happy hour specials only applies to the BAR area - which was literally less than 10 feet away from where we were sitting.  Plus, my margaritas came from the same bar where the happy hour actually was only they would have been more than 50% cheaper if only I was sitting 10' in the closer direction (they have tables at the ""bar area"" too).  It is very misleading, the logo looked practically the same as the one for the restaurant only it says ""bar"" in small print at the bottom.

Second, our waiter was in a complete dream the entire time.  Terrible.  It was so obvious how terrible he was going to be as soon as he walked up to the table, it was scary.  He was very uninterested the entire time in taking our order, waiting on us in general, listening to anything we said.  There was not one thing we ordered the entire time that we didn't have to repeat at least THREE times to him and he still managed to screw it up most of the time.

We ordered the cheese quesadilla for an appetizer - he asked if we wanted the chicken quesadilla, I said, No, we want the cheese.  He said, Oh ok. He still brought us out a greasy chicken quesadilla.

We both ordered Chicken Chimichangas.  He got that part right after needing clarification multiple times, but this time the food was absolutely disgusting.  It was very obvious they pre-fry the Chimichangas and then just MICROWAVED them to reheat them to bring them out to us.  They were mushy and absolutely disgusting.  They came with the DRIEST and BLANDEST rice you have ever had and refried beans are never something that can ""save a dish"" that terrible.

I asked for a 2nd margarita.  Traditional, frozen, just like the first one I had.  He gave me a blank look for a moment, so I started to repeat myself then he asked if I wanted it on the rocks, I said, No, frozen.  He went to get it.  Came back with a margarita on the rocks, dropped it on the table and ran away (didn't even take away my empty one that had been sitting there).  I was so frustrated at this point, I just wanted this terrible dinner to end.

The waiter never checked on how we liked the food (the restaurant wasn't busy but it wasn't dead either - the booths around the outskirts were about full, but all the tables were empty), instead when we were maybe 1/2 way done eating, he came with his checkbook pulled out staring at our ticket obviously and asked us if we were going to be having any coffee or if we had any coupons for my margaritas??  (Didn't even ask if we wanted desert.)  We told him we were paying with a meal voucher from the casino (you earn dollars to spend based on time played there and you can redeem them for dollar amounts to spend at any of their restaurants).  He looked at us to literally stop eating so we could hand him the voucher right then.  My husband said, No you can bring me the check first.  He went away and came right back with the check and said he can take our card(payment) now.  My husband gave him the dirtiest look and said, I think I'm going to finish eating first.  The waiter said he would come back.

That's when we saw the margaritas weren't the happy hour price and noticed their deceptive advertising scandal.  My husband also noted he did see another couple a few minutes earlier hold up the center piece and ask the drink guy something, then they got up and walked to a table at the bar.  Obviously, that was why.

We didn't want to fuss over it.  My husband pulled out the voucher and paid the rest in cash.  The waiter came back and asked if I wanted a box (one of the first normal waiter things he did the entire time) since I didn't eat too much of my disgusting food.  I declined.  We paid and left just a 10% tip - one of the worst tips we've ever left and he's lucky we're not complete scumbags having been waiters ourselves, because he truly deserved nothing.",U8u1jGMpQiFMl5o_ZhOm_g,0,0,1,h14wzgvcBdPnPHjc-wv80g
