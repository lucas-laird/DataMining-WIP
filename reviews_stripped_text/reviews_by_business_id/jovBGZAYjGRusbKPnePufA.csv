We began going to this place right when it opened and coincidentally right before we took a trip to Thailand. Jen and her entire family (the owners) are amazingly friendly and have memorized our order - red curry with chicken/crispy tofu and brown rice AND, my favorite, a papaya salad - YUM!!! We've also ordered many other things on the menu which are fabulous as well. The crispy spinach is a great little snack. 

After traveling to Thailand and coming back, her food is exactly what we had there. Every time we go it reminds us of the Thai cuisine and our trip. I'm so happy to have this place just a minute from my house and the food is undeniably delicious!",Ot8XHr5Ccq92qE6WyYAcmA,1,0,5,xOnQ4-QNhcOT6v0J5mPi1w

The noodles they use are not the typical Pad Thai rice noodles that you're probably used to seeing if you're a Thai food snob. They use wheat & gluten free ingredients so my dish tasted dry/bland. The spring rolls were as normal as can be. The dishes are also way overpriced, but I guess that's expected when you cook with healthier ingredients and you're located in Summerlin. Eat here if you're on a diet, but if you're craving real Thai food then I recommend going to Thai Style Noodle House...

I went with my kids since we never tried it we decided to go and give it a shot even though their prices are high. My younger son ordered chicken and rice and my other son The beef curry. Well after paying 30$ for two plates and one drink i took a look at the food and it didnt look like something we could just eat in the car so we started eating it there. Mind you the only one table they have is reserved for employees only! And they have a very small table top with a few small stools. We asked the cashier if we could have some soy sauce which was clearly in front of her and the register when she replied no you don't need soy sauce with the food try it. Ok im thinking im my son is half filipino my son eats soy sauce with everything but she ignored my comment. So i saw there was a lower sodium one on the table top we were sitting at we tasted the chicken and rice first and yep we wanted soy sauce so we used the one next to us when she smerked and made us feel uncomfortable for wanting soy sauce. Now my sons curry was in a soup form and I apologize but this is our first time eating here and we thought we ordeee curry thats mixed with rice not a soup. So i looked at the cashier and kindly asked if we could order the curry rice instead because we just did not like the soup. The cashier then replied with a simple no with no explanation as to why we could or couldn't return the curry. At that moment i grabbed my kids handed the soup back to her and said no thanks we wont be back here ever!!! What kind of customer sevice do they have going at this place. I can see if they were busy but we were the only customers there, now i see why!! No thanks!!",3zj0iFZko_uHaZc4zXE0tQ,0,0,1,9L4Xa0qcwWuNwNB36CJhjA

CRISPY SPINCH APP: Tempura-fried leaves similar to the salad at Nitayas. Portion is pretty similar, dressing isn't as good, leaves were clumped together, but the $4.88 price tag is a lot smaller.
GINGER RICE SOUP: Comforting, large portion is only $8. I like that they pack the rice separately from the soup (I opted for brown). Shrimp version came with four pieces.
EGGPLANT MADE OVER: eggplant and veggie stir fry with chicken, $11. Tasty sauce menu claims is ""spicy chili basil"". It was tasty, and I liked the basil notes, but this wasn't spicy and I wasn't asked about a spice preference.
PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE: Ordered this with chicken as well, portion was a bit smaller than elsewhere but still quite large. I liked that this version included cashews, which add great texture. Could have used a few more though, only found about five in the entire order.

$40 for Thai takeout dinner for two is a little steep, but resulted in a massive amount of food overall. Note that this spot seems to be strictly grab-and-go, though they do have small stools and a counter lining the room.

I Iove that the (I'm assuming) owner is knowledgeable about gluten and has a close friend who has gluten sensitivity. She's super nice and easy to ask questions of, and that goes a long way when I'm used to being treated as a nuisance because of my food allergies. 

The Pad Thai is very flavorful, with plenty of sauce. This is wonderful, because when I ordered gluten-free pad Thai at Archie's, it was super dry (they make it w/ soy sauce and they have to leave it off because it has wheat). I'm so happy that I don't have to sacrifice flavor!!!

The price may be slightly high, but I get two meals out of it, so it seems like a good value to me! I am looking forward to some of the curries and soups next time.

Smack dab in the middle of the burbs, this small, fast casual, neighborhood Thai place is a good alternative to all the chain restaurants that are abundant in the area.  It's also convenient for us since it's only about a half mile away from the house.  The service was friendly and helpful and the prices are fair.  The place is pretty small and it's nice that the kitchen is open and right there so you can watch your food being prepared.

We ordered two noodle dishes, a Pad Thai with shrimp and a Pad Kee Mow (wide flat noodle) both were $9.  If you ordered the noodles with Chicken, Pork, Vegetables, or Tofu, it would be $8.  We also ordered Spring Rolls which were $3.68 and came with two rolls and a dipping sauce...the Spring Rolls were vegetarian friendly since the filling has no meat.

All the dishes were O.K.. The filling in the Spring Rolls were a bit on the mushy side but the flavor was there and the rice paper wrapping was fairly light and crunchy.  My Pad Kee Mow tasted good, it just had too much sliced onion mixed in which threw off the flavor balance a bit.  I ended up picking some of them out.  Mark H thought his Pad Thai was so so.  He said the shrimp was good but the sauce overall was too sweet.

After being exhausted from driving all day from Sacramento,  a convenient and quick place nearby is a welcomed thing for sure.  Would be worth coming back to.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,4,8,4,VGftRbFPOkrC1bwlCqtCJA

I walked in picked up our to go order then headed home. As soon as we pulled in my partner receives a call. After being accused of giving the woman at the counter the wrong ""name"", it turned out i was handed the wrong order... 
As if i would get my own name wrong.
 They said that they would come and drop off our correct order ""oh by the way you owe us $9""

The not only brushed responsibility for their mistake, but also up charged us the $9 difference. 

45 minutes later... the food however was good in flavor. Their curry to watery. 

The flavor of their food isn't good enough for me to want to go back to such a place of business.

I will take my business elsewhere. 

Maybe next year ill give them a second try...",ibeKPl_Q6_peLfoFJ4XaAw,1,0,2,V513TLyO26EkerVunAfP5w

I also ordered a large Tom Yum soup with chicken. Standard size amount. This too was prepared differently than most places. Chicken was tough and flavor was ehhhh 

Place has seats for inside eating but restaurant is designed for take out.

Small portion sizes along with the cost makes this an undesirable place for me to return. For $23 ...I expected more",piwcc36E-2uXhvLUj_FfPQ,2,1,2,7UD9Z_aWQfiHEufyBxuhDQ
5679700,2017-10-07,3,jovBGZAYjGRusbKPnePufA,"I don't get the 4 star rating! I'm a huge lover of thai food and this place misses the mark. But let's start with the rude service first. I don't know how the owner was nice to everyone else but she was super nasty to me. I ordered my food and told her it was for here, and even ordered a drink. My daughter and I shared the pad thai. We sat down and she gives it to me in a to go bag, so either she didn't hear me or what I think is the real reason...she wanted me out of there. I noticed that the two guys eating in there had like plastic bento boxes. When I got up to get a napkin I notice that they actually have real dishes that they put away for people, and here I got my food in the good old styrofoam box. I searched for a fork, she only gave me one--so I ask for another she gives me the nastiest look! My daughter even said, wow. She makes me lean all the way across to counter to get it because god forbid she walk over to me in reaching distance. I'm seriously leaning over the counter with my arm stretched out as far as it can go and my fingertips barely touch the fork. Does that make her move closer? Hell no. I finally get the fork and we eat. She stared at us the entire time like I killed her pet or something. Very uncomfortable. I said thank you and nothing. She's a royal you know what. On to the food, the most flavorless pad Thai ive ever had. There are so many other thai restaurants close enough that you would never ever need to step foot in this one. It's tasteless. The only reason you may like it is if you don't frequently eat Thai, so you don't have anything to compare it with. I wouldn't eat in there anyway, it's small quarters. I swear I saw a cockaroach. My advice pass this place up and go somewhere else. 


The fact that I gave this honest review of my personal experience and the restaurant owners and friends of the owner sent me nasty messages through Yelp is deplorable, attacking me as a person for simply not enjoying their food or customer service, nasty people. These are the types that would spit in your food",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,3,0,1,hbDoP2ym6tO6YVSGfwAkZQ
