My girlfriend and I stopped in for happy hour. What a great choice. The happy hour is very reasonable and selection is great. Fish was fresh and tastes were amazing.

The server did not smile from the time I entered, throughout the meal and even when I walked out.  Whenever she gave me a plate or took one away I would always thank her but after getting no response and a blank face, I stopped thanking her. I ordered nigiri ( 2 orders of tako, spicy crab, spicy tuna, garlic tuna, and tai). The first order of tako nigiri came with a small thin slice of lemon and the second order did not come with lemon. So a little inconsistent there but other than that everything was good. Items that are only available for dinner should be clearly noted on the menu. The server said everything with an asterisk under the specialty roll is only available for dinner.  There are way more items throughout the menu that have an asterisk before it so I was kind of confused and had to double check that the poke is included with the AYCE lunch. For appetizers I had the yellowtail poke, enoki bacon yakitori and shrimp bomb. The poke was good but I prefer mine without seaweed. I did not like the shrimp bomb. The shrimp yakisoba was ok.

We needed to find a new go to as our old one had closed.

Every time we eat here, it's perfect.  The greeter is quick and pleasant, we like to sit in the booths, it's nice they have the option of booth or table.  We usally have the same server, so it's nice to see familiar faces when we go.  They take your order, and then bring out the dishes.  We've never had a long wait, service and like water refills have been on point.  

The food is fantastic!  Our go to items are the garlic tuna, wild fire, Johnny roll, and the green muscles. The all you can eat is around $25, plus you get a punch card after 10 ayce, you get one free, I think we are on our 3rd card :)

The prices are great, at the time of this review they were running a 50% off all sushi.  ""You get what you pay for"" is certainly how I felt after my first visit, which in this case what not a whole lot.  The sushi rice was not properly cooked, mushy on the outside, crunchy on the inside.  The rolls are thin, not rolled tight and lacked any of the usual cucumber/avocado or toppings/sauces.  The tempura was definitely NOT made to order, hence not crunchy but rather stale, the California roll had nothing but imitation crab, again no cucumber etc.   I was rather excited to see this place as it is conveniently located on my way home from work.

I originally came here because I have a Groupon... I still have that Groupon because the waitress was kind enough to point out that the Groupon doesn't expire until January and they had 1/2 priced regular rolls as a Grand Opening special. I am a fan of the ""simpler"" sushi rolls anyway, so this was like finding a gold mine, and I have been going back ever since. Their sushi is already so reasonably priced (without the 1/2 off) compared to the rest of Vegas that this means their Grand Opening special (which was still going as of 11/16/13) resulted in $2-3 regular rolls. 

The rolls are pretty standard and the ingredients are fresh. Considering I'm on a fixed income and a sushi addict, I couldn't ask for more from a sushi place!",oG6zUYCWKUy46G6foXnMdA,1,0,5,qsNARO4PoF1zn79JN2MWfw

I had the special roll combo.
The rolls that I selected were pretty tasty and the size of the rolls were perfect, not to large and not loaded with rice. The special came with ""salad"" and miso soup. The salad was not salad at all. It was a ramekin of shredded cabbage with a small drizzle of dressing. I found the miso soup to be weak.

My wife had the salmon tempura combo. The salmon and tempura were tasty but it came with a similar ""salad"" as my combo. We both ordered hot tea. This tea was so weak we wondered if the bag had been reused and we were surprised to find a $2 charge for it on the receipt. 

The overall value was fair for what we received. There certainly was no home run hit here and we left smelling like deep fryer oil. If you have another sushi spot, stick with it.",RO_4PXpV2_KfzKmCkF0ayA,1,1,3,22mEpmfJUELoKAZ7T_7mFg

Went during lunch time and although there were several other parties, it wasn't too crowded on this Friday afternoon. 

We went with the all you can eat menu which was $21.95 plus tax per person. Very reasonable considering how much sushi usually costs.  There are some items on the menu which can only be ordered during the dinner hours which costs a little bit more ($25.95), but there were only a few of those items...

The service was quick and you can order as much as you want for a 60 minute duration. But don't over order as you will be charged extra for anything that is left that you aren't able to finish.  You are also able to order other items while you are eating so we just ordered as we are which worked out well.

Not only all that, but the sushi was very good.  Tasty and well cooked.

They also have dessert on the menu which you are able to order once you are done with the sushi.

There were a few customers at the bar, but otherwise the place was empty...and that surprised me.  We were glad to hear that there was a late night happy hour on both food and drinks.   We ordered a few different rolls (California crunch, spicy tuna),bacon yaki-tori, soup, edemame, saki, and some beers.  Everything tasted perfect.

Everything came out promptly and the waitress answered all of our questions politely.  The price was phenomenal, especially for the sheer amount of food that we ordered and the quality.

1132060,2015-07-29,1,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"WORST SERVICE EVER! I came here with my husband for dinner. We go to sushi places all over town, and decided to try this place. The waitress approached our table & we ordered 3 sushi rolls and a bottle of wine, a moment later the manager walked up to our table & told us we should order the all you can eat sushi instead, he said we would be getting more for our money, so we took his advice and ordered two all you can eat for $24.95 each. Never were we told we had to eat every last bite of sushi on our plate or they would charge us and additional $10 leftover fee. We have eaten all you can eat sushi at least at a dozen other sushi diners and NEVER did they charge us a fee for not eating everything. The manager came up to our table yelling at us (while using profanity) when we said that we should not have to pay the $10 fee because there was no signs anywhere saying you had to eat everything on your plate or there would be a $10 charge (he said it was sushi law lol). I told him typically when I order all you can eat sushi they offer half rolls so you don't have much leftovers. Regardless, even when we had leftovers never did any place charge us for it. DO NOT EAT HERE. There are so many good sushi places in Las Vegas & Henderson, Daisho Sushi is very bland at best, but whats worse than the poor quality of sushi is the horrendous service this place has. I have never had a employee, much less a manager treat me so disrespectful, he didn't care there were other people trying to eat and children were present while he used profanity.

1135638,2013-09-22,0,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"Had ayce lunch ($19.95ea) for two here on a Sunday noon and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant didn't have very many patrons at the time we came in, maybe five or six other tables aside from us so service was super fast.  Our food was being delivered almost faster than we can eat them, old plates being taken away just as quick, and our beverages never less than half full.  The facility was also sparkly clean as what you can expect from a brand new spot.

We were able to sample the majority of their nigiri and found them to be very good overall.  The fish were as fresh and had a good rice to fish ratio.  They do seem to make the nigiri a bit smaller than average, which I appreciate since this gives you the opportunity to sample other items on the menu and not get full too quickly.  I also feel that you can get a better taste of the food if you're mouth is less stuffed per bite.

We also sampled a good number of their yakitori and totally loved each one.  This is probably what sets them apart from other ayce joints.  Sure you can find yakitori elsewhere but their bacon-wrapped yakitori items here is exceptional, one of the most flavorful I've had in recent memory.  We also had both the salmon and yellowtail poke and thought that they were good too, though nothing compared to poke from poke express.

While there are plenty of ayce sushi places in the valley, there are only a handful that are really worth going back again and again.  I'll have to go back here again to be sure and to evaluate their consistency but Daisho sushi looks like a keeper to me.  I would rank this place in the same class and category as Yama and Goyemon in overall food flavor and dining satisfaction.  The best part of it is that Daisho is slightly cheaper in that lunch is only $19.95 and dinner $24.95, where the competition charges 1-2 bucks more.",X87BI29HpGXLwjnqbAOctA,4,1,5,EPpnQTbGA01GRfo0c2ZSuA

1404219,2013-09-12,10,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"It has been a really LONG time since i've been really wowed by sushi. I came to a point in my life where I really questioned whether or not sushi, in general, has become perpetually trite. After visiting Daisho, my opinion of sushi has changed. This is now my favorite AYCE sushi spot in Vegas, and what they are doing here is surprisingly wonderful. Here's why:

First, after walking in the door and being seated by the server at the bar, we were given our menu's. They had the expected items you would see on any sushi menu, but after looking at the appetizer menu, you can tell that these guys are trying to do things distinctive. We had the AYCE menu for 25 bucks, and Tony T. and I started our voyage through this unique menu.

Note: We tried a great volume of items, so I would probably max out the 5000 character limit on Yelp reviews by describing only 1/4 of what we had. There was zilch that I didn't like on menu, but there some dishes that are especially noteworthy.

: Salmon Collar/Yellowtail Collar - This was unbelievable. I was totally blown away, especially by the salmon. The first time I had collar of a fish was at Yonaka, and it was wonderful. On the other hand, the collar at Daisho completely blows Yonaka's out of the water!!! Wonderfully tender, with the natural fat sustaining the moistness of the fish, personally (especially with the salmon), I thought I was eating foie gras. It was prepared with an expert hand, and cooked with precision.  It absolutely melted in the mouth. I'm still thinking about it.

: Uni and Ikura (salmon roe) nigiri - Freshest and highest quality uni and salmon roe i've ever had, EVER. The uni had a delicate, but firm texture, and had a clean taste. The same goes for Ikura as well. 

I FINALLY found a place that makes sushi rice correctly!!!! A great deal of people think that it's effortless to create great sushi rice. What folks don't realize is, that in world-class sushi restaurants, sushi apprentices and beginner trainees spend 3-4  (or more) YEARS learning just how to make rice, before they are given the permission to touch a piece of fish. Making sushi rice in itself, is an art form. And these guys nailed it.

A small footnote: This locale is great for low-carbers. There are more than 5 rice less rolls and plenty of apps that do not contain starch or rice, including collar, poke, oysters, yaki-tori and more!!",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,26,21,5,PPJ9zQU5t41QzCuWVFolLQ

Anyways, all I can say is that this place has top notch Japanese appetizers!! Was really glad they were part of the all-you-can eat menu. The fish they used for the nigiri was actually not that fresh.. especially the tuna.. it looked, funny. The size of the nigiri is also quite small compared to the other places around the valley but it didn't really bother me since I take small bites anyways. Service was excellent. The only problem was when we ordered the salmon collar. It was actually undercooked but they immediately replaced it with a new one so good service on that part. I probably wouldn't come back for all-you-can eat but it is definitely a place to take non-sushi lovers + sushi lovers since they have a larger variety of non-fish appetizers.

Appetizers to get: 

-Miso black cod
-Salmon collar
- Yellowtail collar
- Yakitori
- Fresh oysters",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,3,3,4,RUZQtNsu1ZxQDMcXfBhr9A
1579559,2013-10-05,6,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"First off let me say that this business is notorious for sending hate mail when the reviewer/customer does not rate this place highly.  Now let me save you the trouble by saying that I will not read hate mail so don't bother as I am sure you will also not bother in making any necessary changes for ALL patrons to be fully satisfied when dining here.  

We came here on a Saturday evening and it was completely dead which was the first red flag.  We had heard good things by a few peeps so we decided to give it a go.  

We started with a few skewers and a kama  or I should say half of a kama which were all crowded all on the same plate thrown over a bed of cabbage accompanied by an overpowering smelly orange slice. AWEFUL! 

Everything we ordered looked nothing like the pictures we saw on yelp. No wonder they frown on picture taking.

So disappointed that I stopped at the second order and could not go on.  It gets worse ...the ""sushi chef"" also kept shaking his head NO on certain items suggesting they were not of good quality. I noticed that my husband kept ordering other items as if trying to convince himself that it couldn't get worse...but that's all they serve here and he soon realized they just could not be saved.  They also do not offer half rolls and offer 1 dessert per person and with too many restrictions at an all you can eat joint makes for a very un-fun experience all together. 

There is just way too much competition out there and you unfortunately only have in many cases one attempt to cause a good first impression with me.

The stamp card reads you have to eat 10x All u can eat for 1 Free, Dinner being $27-$28 basically meaning we spent $560 roughly to earn the 2 ($56) free. They only honored one actually AND STOLE OUR SECOND CARD (who creates a whole new punch card and tries to lie about it??) with 6 stamps on it already and gave me one back with 3 when they should have filled the 6/10 stamp card with 4 more stamps as we had 7 ""ALL YOU CAN EAT CUSTOMERS"" tonight and added 3 extra stamps to a new/next card. I did not know it was this hard to do math for these people but thats obvious too since it took 1 hour NO EXAGGERATIONS to figure out our separate checks with our cards. I love great service and tip VERY WELL brought a big party of friends from out of town and didn't expect such a terrible experience, just to argue over a petty all you can eat for free card.

- Chicken Yakitori. It's OK. ~$4 for 2 pieces (which is standard) - but I could go without it next time.

The Sharks Tale has a bit of wasabi mixed in with the Salmon and Snow Crab but it's bearable. I never have wasabi and was able to eat this with no problems.. The Snow White is one of the rolls that isn't cooked. As much as I prefer something raw vs. cooked - I'd have to say the Sharks Tale was the best of these two rolls. 
+ Hot green tea. Roughly $2 (I think it's like $1.75 or something). It comes in a tea pot which is great so you don't have to keep asking for refills. It comes in a tea bag.

2164941,2014-04-29,4,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"Went here Sunday @ around 4 pm with a total company of 4. Did the AYCE and started with 

salmon poke -- it is mixed with seaweed salad. this i would rate 2/5, taste was ok but too much seaweed salad mixed with it. 

uni -- it was good, 3/5.

amaebi (sweet shrimp) - 3/5.

lobster roll - 3/5, i did not taste lobster in it and the wasabi mixed in it overpowered it.

also ordered a couple of regular rolls like the scallop and salmon yum yum, 3/5-- all were room temperature which was a little weird. 
what disappointed me was when i ordered 'rock and roll,'

i thought it was mostly sashimi of fish but it was fish inside shave cucumber -- mostly cucumber that'll fill you up moreso than the fish --

i did not expect it to be like that and ate all my fish, the waiter came to me and said ""WE WILL CHARGE YOU EXTRA IF YOU DO NOT EAT the cucumber"" so I made sure I finished all the cucumber.

i've been to a lot of sushi place and this was the first time this ever happened to me - i would have taken it better if it was said in a polite manner but no, it wasn't. 

Steven, sushi chef- was amazing and tried making up for it (i told him ok, give me sushi that doesn't have a lof of rice in it) and he did-- but because i ate all the cucumber (rock n roll) i was so full of it, i couldn't enjoy any sushi anymore.

there was no manager that day so i finished off and left. I called the next day to let the manager know about what happened and she apologized, Apology accepted but I will never go back to this place -- there are TOO many sushi places in LAS VEGAS and for the quality and price -- I can easily go somewhere else and get an excellent service with the same caliber if not better, sushi. 

in the end, i left super full of cucumber and very much disappointed.
i would most definitely can give it a second try but my experience had me left with a bad taste in my mouth in more occasion than one.",m0AJ1GsoKpEAXW-hNvXtIg,7,1,1,KQRX5x3RI9te62wAvO2kHg

So the woman who picks up the phone does not only not want to hand the phone over to the manager/owner, but asks who is calling, I say ""one of your customers, I am just trying to figure out if the charge I have on my bank statement is correct""  and she says all of a sudden he is not present at all.  I said I would call back and she asks well ""why are you calling?  Do you want to order?"" I say no I am calling to figure out if a charge is correct, her response; ""Well who is charging you? What statements are being made?"" I politely tell her she doesn't understand the proper meanings of these words, so I will call back later when the manager/owner is back.  She says: ""He wont be back for a few days.... Would you like to order?""  Wow.  I will never come back here again for not only being treated this way when I am trying to be polite and just talk to the manager, but also for the fact that she won't let me talk to the manager, and third for accidentally finding out that this is the type of place where if you need the owner's/manager's help correcting or verifying a transaction that this is the sort of response you would get.

I spotted Daisho, and since the storm was showing no signs of letting up, I decided to go in.  I was so happy I did!!!

They had an all you can eat menu for 21.95.  The selection was great.  There was all kinds of appetizers, salads and desserts.  There was also a front and back page of sushi options that were included in the all you can eat price.  The only stipulation is that you must eat what you order, because they will charge you extra for wasted food.

I was alone that day, so I sat at the sushi bar.  I notified the sushi chef that I was pregnant and asked if he could let me know if anything I ordered had raw fish.  He went above and beyond and told me to order whatever I wanted and he would make sure he cooked anything that would have been raw.  Both of the sushi chefs working that day were very friendly and extremely attentive.

I ended up ordering 4 rolls in total. Had a cucumber salad and ordered a fried banana for dessert.  I highly recommend the Daisho roll.  I feel like I definitely got my money's worth.

We came here around 7pm and it wasn't busy at all. There was a total of 6 people at the restaurant...including my bf and I. We never do AYCE sushi....we like ordering a la carte. So spicy tuna roll is what we wanted to start off with. It was pretty good....you can't really fk up that roll. Next we ordered a Godzilla and Spicy Girl. 
Godzilla was supposed to have soft shell crab but we barely got any in there. There were actually more crab meat and avocados than anything else! Spicy Girl was good....a lot of flavors going on with that one. Presentation was nice and they don't skim you on rolls....it was packed with yummy goodness. Specialty rolls ranged from like $10.95-14.95.

Restaurant is on the smaller side so I can imagine you might have to wait for a table during busy/primetime hours. Overall, it was simply A-OK. We MIGHT be back but there are plenty of other sushi places we go to before we decide come back here.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,9,6,3,OuhwkjTsAIVWLjbO4x6CQg

Wherever it's offered, I always start out with an Ahi Poke... If for some odd reason I got to a sushi AYCE and suddenly wanted NO variety, I would just order four or five Ahi Pokes.

I ordered a Snow White to him, he took my order then walked away. 10 min later I realized he wasn't coming back and didn't tell other chef about my order so I had to order it again. Our rolls were good but based on other yelpers picks who know him, we got short sticked on our presentation... I like the radish noodles with my sushi! 
Then they don't do half rolls and with all you can eat there are so many limitations. I agree with other yelpers that with all those limitations I can go somewhere else! Only certain appetizers are included in all you can eat, you can only do one each of the rolls with no rice, and because of those rolls I had to pay dinner price at lunch time.

The whole point of all you can eat, for me, is to try a variety of things. I've asked if I could just get a small portion because it's the same price either way with all you can eat but was told no. All you can eat sushi menus should be like Japanese dim sum, small portions big variety. This place has a huge variety but don't plan on trying much of it in a single sitting unless you're a competitive eater and be prepared to stand your ground when you ask for something like yum yum sauce on the squid instead of ponzu because they always seem to assume I'm a sushi virgin or something.",V1sJJt4wDGNZ8MJT1E8COA,0,0,4,FhjsHOkYMHa5vUf7FwE_DQ

I like a place that pays attention to customer service.  I don't think I've ever been in there when the one of the owners wasn't there. They keep a close eye on the business and it shows because the service is always good and the food is always consistent.  I can't say enough good about this local gem.  If you haven't checked them out you're missing out.",XGufJ5VHHUr2uv2RJt9E9Q,0,0,5,Clq9LiuMDAcZMijF4egwBg

Anyways, I love ordering Uni- but I am always skeptical when ordering it, because LOTS of places have old uni, which is brown and dull and tastes bad. Uni should be orange, slightly firm- not too firm though- as its a soft type of food, and its tastey when fresh. LUCKY ME- they had fresh Uni! Which is awesome! Because I've been let down soooo many times before at other restaraunts.

I particularly LOVE their shrimp bombs.
Also, they have no-rice sushi rolls, many of which are fantastic- Great for Diabetics.
Its also next to a neighborhood walmart- so if you need to get groceries after... you're in luck.


I have not used the bathrooms here- so no comment. But the restaraunt is very clean, and has nice decor. There are TV's around. Its a slightly small place- but it doesn't get too busy so thats just fine. Lunch is the best time, as its not crowded, and its nice an quiet-ish.",12_6lDVEBCKu2Wrq_6j43A,1,1,5,yIQb2rh7gwPL9tY5yN7L2w

Ummm I have never really walked out on too many resteruants... but this was DEFINITELY one I could not stick around to continue.... =[ maybe it was a bad night... but one bad moment is a big turn off for me....

We weren't really greeted the server just kind of stared at us... then she came around & sat us... & was just a bit akward. No smile... no expression... no words really... she came around & got our order as we wanted to do AYCE. 

Our first order came out and it was tuna wrapped around fried fish can't remember the name since the hubby ordered it... but a few minutes later a couple of our sushi pieces came out & literally I smelt a stench of fish...

HONESTLY fresh raw fish should NOT smell or have a STENCH of fish!!! But I thought maybe it was just one of the fishes on the plate so I ate my HALIBUT first & I couldn't swallow it.... =[ 
Then I turned the plate to have the hubby try... & the was a piece of short hair on the sushi.... !!!! O_o  then a salmon roll came out & that was all for my man but he put one roll in & then he spit it out... he said the rice was like MUSH in his mouth... rarely does he complain too much about food he just eats.... but if he can't handle.. BLAHHH 

Seen some good reviews... but OMG I feel like I was totally tricked.... so we couldn't.. we told them to stop all orders... & WORST thing was.. when we showed the waitress the hair she said she will get a new one.. but right as I decided I can't eat here I went up to where she took the plate back... the chef was just placing the same fishes on a DIFFERENT plate...

I saw daisho a couple weeks ago and was not very intrigued to go in . The neighboring buildings did not complement or compel me to eat sushi. Until one day (Friday) I was rather hungry and found myself driving to what ever caught my eye. And I saw that daisho had ""regular rolls 50% off"" and I do love my sushi and especially for 50% cheaper :) 

 At first viewing daisho from the exterior I did not find it very appealing . However when I walked it , I was presently surprised. It's interior is so pretty and the people were incredibly nice . 

I am writing this review for the 2 times I visited daisho and both times they met my expectations and exceeded it. 

The first time i got 4 regular rolls for $10 because it was BOGO free. They were okay but because I'm used to special rolls and haven't had a regular roll in ages .

The second time I went I went for the AYCE and OMG the choice in appetizers was ahhmaaazinng. ;) SERIOUSLY, your gonna give me salmon Kama? They also had skewers and I love bacon wrapped enoki mushroom however they did not cook it to my liking . And I was disappointed cause I was really looking forward to it. I'm scared of eating raw pork (because of my biology class). However everything else was really good ! I thought the food was about an 8 on a scale from 1-10 . But the thing that got me was definitely the service . I had jenny and Michael. Jenny was our server and she was so sweet and helpful. She was unfortunately the only server that night due to some mishaps she informed me about  but she still rushed to serve with a smile on her face . 

So if you want good AYCE sushi, and excellent service that's cheaper than other places daisho is for you !",C4KfHQbd-cP9SyvgJYNY1w,7,7,5,sHSlgv3_Hez3UpRDFwP5CQ

Well, that's what Daisho Sushi was for me. Located in the same plaza as Walmart Neighborhood, this little restaurant is great for a quick bite without the hassle of crowds. 

It was practically empty both times we stopped in during their lunch specials from 11-4p, so happy hour and dinner might be a completely different story. Daisho has 50% off rolls and drink specials during happy hour and an AYCE option, but I can only speak of their lunch.

For around $8, my teriyaki chicken combo included: miso soup, salad, steamed rice, 4 pieces of california roll, and shrimp+veggie tempura. Suffice it to say, you'll leave full with leftovers. Collectively, I was also able to try their baked mussels (first timer), tofu (nothing special), siomai (kind of small) as appetizers along with a sweet cold sake (strong for me), which is served in an ice bucket. 

Their digital artwork on the walls is pretty novel. A projector renders their centerpiece mural with movement and by the host stand, a marlin mount appears to be amongst waves...

I had no idea this was in the same plaza as the Ohana Haiwaiian place! Anyways, the sushi rolls were pretty good (esp. the Daisho and Starfish). The nigiri was a hit or miss for me. Some of their fish was obviously not fresh while the others were pretty good. I would recommend getting the yuzu salmon and garlic tuna. The seared salmon was not even seared at all and the scallops didn't have much taste to it. I would not recommend the chicken and beef skewers at all. They were pretty tough to chew and it was weird because they didn't look natural (I'll post pictures so you can see what I mean). It looked like they just blended the meat together and just reformed it into one piece. They ran out of the enoki bacon so I didn't get to try that one. 

Anyways, this place is decent for an AYCE in the Henderson area. It's not the best, but not the worst. If you are in the area and are craving for some sushi, this place will get the job done, but if distance is not a factor, stick to places like Sushi Neko or Sushi Twister.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,5,4,3,Il0cryMcFZ0FVekiBqQqHQ

3590946,2015-08-06,2,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"I went here tonight with family & friends. At first everything about the place was pretty inviting. The restaurant itself wasn't super ghetto like a lot of American sushi places tend to be. I chose this place because I heard a Japanese person was the owner & hoped that the standards would be a little higher. I don't have high expectations when it comes to sushi in America & never expect it to be like Japanese sushi... I mean you can never expect a different country to get it 100% right. Americanized sushi in it's way has it's own charm, so I'm by no means one of those people who expects Japanese standards when in America. However it wasn't even the sushi that bugged me. The sushi was average. Didn't hate it didn't love it. 

The service is what really got me down. When we went there it wasn't that busy. There were actually a lot of workers. Two girls & a man who waited tables as well as worked in the back. 3 waiters for a not so busy sushi restaurant. So you can imagine our shock when we waved & ""excused me""d in a none aggressive way over & over & over again & got no attention. It got to a point where I was waving from my seat, both hands up & everyone eating at the restaurant was looking at me like, ""WTF"" & STILL no one came. So basically 3 waiters are purposefully not serving us or they are all extremely bad at their job because the place is not that big. How can you not see me? The girls didn't have bad attitudes but I could not get over the fact that there were 3 of them, & I got the attention of all of the customers & still could not get a waiter. It made me feel even more sad when they all gave me dirty looks as if I was a bitch, even though I wasn't being aggressive & I was only trying to get someone to do their job & get my friend the beer they forgot to bring... I even got the attention of the man who was working there & he was wearing gloves so he made a hand signal at me saying that he could not help me. One of the girls was right next to him but he didn't even tell her to go help me, he just went to the back & went on with his business ignoring me completely.
It felt like someone had spit in my face, I was so insulted. It's funny because everyoneeeee was getting waited on except for us. Tables were being wiped & we still could not catch the eye of the waitress..... & okay I am not going to scream for someone to help me & throw a fit & make a scene.... so I just tried to be cool about it while entertaining a friend. 
 My guest was handicapped in a wheel chair. Maybe they were prejudiced against that?  I mean we went in there not demanding anything or needing any special treatment... we were just hungry wanting to order food! It was so bizarre how singled out we were! 

We were pretty cool about it & just had our conversations hoping that someone would stop by to see how we were doing, since politely trying to get their attention was out of the question. 

30 minutes later after the whole incident with the man the beer never came & we ran out of food. No one came to see how we were doing so we actually had to get out of our seat & walk to the sushi bar to ask someone to help us. At this point I really wanted to get out of this place but I was entertaining a guest who was visiting from out of town & could not just up & get out of this horrible place. I never got any refills of my drink that night. We never got asked if our table needed more food or drink. I mean I'm not even sure this is a restaurant really because I did not even have the opportunity to order more food. The worst part was after the guy who never got us any help was done with whatever he was doing in the back he was waiting tables again & would hover & hover & hover over our table but NEVER ask if we were doing okay or needed anything. I am really glad we decided not to get the all you can eat because I can imagine we would have payed a lot of money & never received any of the food.
Not only did I leave hungry & thirsty, I left feeling insulted & embarrassed. I had drawn unwanted & uncalled for attention to myself by people who were getting waited on. On top of that I had entertained a friend in this low grade place. This is the first time I've left a restaurant with my stomach still rumbling. Also I really doubt this place is owned by a Japanese person, that must have been a rumor. In our culture no matter what kind of place the restaurant is, we have a strong ""hospitality"" rule where good service is number one over anything. When I find out that an owner of a place is Japanese I find that the service is fairly decent. The race of the owner doesn't matter to me but I can't help but judge on that aspect if the rumors are true. Definitely not authentic at all. Maybe it was just bad luck but I can't help but feel like were singled out for whatever reason because it was just not busy enough for us to have had that level of service. I will never come back again & never recommend this place.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,4,0,1,pSdBhfYRBBRf_rjY-ubB7g
3599700,2013-09-19,10,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"*This visit was just THREE days after Tony T.'s and Michael K.'s 5-star experience....

Before meeting up with the gang for some Bingo action at South Point, we decided to get our sushi on here after hearing that they had good nigiri, kick-ass appetizers, and that the head sushi chef was from Blue Ribbon inside the Cosmopolitan. Already with high expectations and an appetite for destruction, we sit up at the bar, go all-in with AYCE.

We start off with both the salmon and tuna poke. The salmon was good, but the texture of the tuna was kinda suspect...gave them the benefit of the doubt, and ordered up some nigiri- Uni, Blue Crab, Fatty Albacore, and Amaebi. ""The Amaebi is not good...too small"" says our sushi chef......OH....KAY??? ""The tuna is good"" he says...so we put our trust in him, and dig in. Uni is good, Blue Crab is sweet, but the tuna lacks its glistening fresh appearance and again, I'm hesitant, trying the Fatty Albacore which looks butchered and is barely cold, almost body temperature...I chase that bad feeling with my Iced Green Tea, then I ask where the tuna is from...his answer?  Hawaii...after tasting the mediocre tuna, I knew for a fact that it did not come from the 808 State and that this knock off sushi chef was playing me for a chump! I much rather have had that smaller Amaebi, but then again, who knows how fresh that was!?

Little did he know that he was messin' with The Goyemonstah......

Little did he know that the Goyemonstah was born and raised in Hawaii AND worked at a fishmarket with some of the best tuna from our own waters...

and VERY little did he know that The Goyemonstah wanted to reach over the display case and.....Never mind!

We ditched the nigiri section and ordered off the appetizer section-Miso Black Cod, Hamachi Kama, and a few Yakitori-Bacon Wrapped Quail Eggs, Bacon Wrapped Asparagus, and Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushrooms. I expected Yakitori items and the grilled fish items to arrive on separate plates, but what we got was a pupu platter complete with orange slices delivered by the former Blue Ribbon sushi chef himself with everything on the same plate! The flavors from the Miso Black Cod and the
 ""Ha-Ka""(Half of a Hamachi Kama, not to be confused with the war chant that the New Zealand All Blacks perform before they prepare to kill the opposing team) all blended with the Yakitori which was a big fail in presentation. They probably tested the other half of the Hamachi Kama for freshness? We ordered a some scallop, salmon, and saba nigiri, still just okay, and the cure on the saba was barely evident.

I order a Shark's Tale, Wild Fire, and What's Wrong? Roll. The Shark's Tale mentions tempura snow crab...it is tempura imitation krab. Wild Fire Roll was okay and the What's Wrong roll was swimming in sauce and was alright. I think our Yuzu Sherbet and Green Tea Ice Cream were sadly the highlights here. No half rolls allowed until your last order, and only one dessert per person FYI....

Shady quality of fish, lack of presentation and witnessing lots of shortcuts(they don't make their tamago, and soft shell crab is fried, chopped, and prepared way in advance-YUCK!) does not warrant a return visit here....ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,19,8,2,JxgQN7gbWEioDZTLGURCqg

Choices for desert are so so... fried bannana, bananna split, or the typical ice or mochi but I've been to other sushi places that only offer the typical Japanese deserts so this didn't bother me at all. 

Customer service both behind the bar and outside is fantastic. We never had to ask for refills as they were dine automatically and our empty plates never sat for more than 2 minutes. The sushi chefs are very friendly. They take time to talk to you and have a conversation while they make food.

3623034,2013-10-30,3,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"So I decided to make Daisho my last sushi spot before I cut back on AYCE sushi meals for awhile D': I've abused this whole all you can eat sushi privilege since I moved to Las Vegas a year ago and it's finally catch up on me. Le sigh.

Anyway, I decided to go with Daisho since it's the new buzzing spot on Yelp and I had to see what all the 5 stars were about. 

- Decor - 
To start off, the decor is mediocre. Nothing too special, but they have time to improve that later in the future and doesn't really affect my overall experience. The plates they provide are regular large circular ones you would normally find in any other restaurant that isn't serving sushi. Merh, I guess I'm just more used to the traditional small rectangular plates. 

- Nigiri - 
I can see why the majority of the ratings are 5 stars. The fish is the freshest I have tasted in awhile from the AYCE options. I feel like since sushi restaurants give you the option of eating as much as you can possibly can for a mere ~$25, they can serve not so high quality products. But I must say, the hotate (scallop) was delicious, and the uni was the best I have tasted in Vegas thus far. I've never had so much uni piled on one piece of nigiri. I was actually really shocked on the amount I was given. However, that was the only nigiri where I felt spoiled. Although the fish they serve were all fresh, the slices were really thin. HA! THAT'S WHERE THEY GET YOU! I knew it was too good to be true :( I guess you really can't have your cake and eat it too, oh what a world. 

- Rolls - 
Moving on to the rolls for those who don't care much for raw fish. Their rolls are surprisingly the biggest reason I'd come back again and again. AND I NEVER SAY THAT! So good news, they offer half order rolls, bad news is that you have to wait till your 2nd or 3rd round till they allow you that privilege. I love their 'no rice' rolls. Basically everything you would typically have in a roll except instead of being wrapped in seaweed it's wrapped in cucumber, and of course no rice. The one time I actually enjoy a roll, they put a restriction on it and say it's only one per person :( All the other rolls you are welcome to order as much as you like. They have a huge variety of rolls so if you're a roll lover, you've hit the jackpot. One thing I must make note of is that if your go-to roll is the spider roll... order the 'Godzilla Roll'. Their version of the Spider Roll incorporates lettuce (why??). The Godzilla roll is the usual Spider Roll you'd find at any other sushi restaurant. 

-Appetizers, other items-
Something I really enjoyed about Daisho that really sets it apart from other sushi places is their selection of appetizers. Quail egg wrapped bacon, asparagus wrapped bacon, and mushrooms wrapped bacon! I wasn't very fond of the ""fresh"" oysters since they were warm when they got to our table. There are many other items to make up for it though.

All around, not bad, not bad at all! I'll definitely be taking out-of-town friends here who are more into rolls than nigiri here.",HmhjcPCVr0TbPsPhXV-Trw,6,3,4,43iJMAmWOLmxJnYb5N_DAw

We've both been in the service industry for more then a decade and we were totally impressed from everything like the servers who were sweet and accommodating to the owner who not only introduced himself but engaged us in conversation even got our background and remembered our names when we came back the second time.  The sushi was great, but the attitude of the owner and his enthusiasm to make his establishment a success.  I don't see this much excitement and passion from someone very often in my business. It's so refreshing to see someone with that much passion about his dream. This will be our go to spot on date night from now on.  I look forward to tasting the next valley of fire or warm springs roll. Two of our favorites!

The staff remembered us from the previous weekend. So our sushi was packed with double the rice. This made it a horrible experience all you could taste was the rice. We said something to the server that there was more rice than last time. She dismissed the claim but did admit to remembering my group. After she walked away she went to the other servers and spoke to them in japenese. Next we could tell they were talking about us. Also I notice the chef was staring at us. I'm 100 percent sure they doubled the rice portion so we wouldn't be able finish so they could charge us extra. That is a shady way to run all you can eat.

4107099,2015-07-22,4,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"Prompted by glowing recommendations from trusted friends, I finally made a return visit almost two years following my initial ROTD-earning write-up of Daisho Sushi. What I got was an enjoyable AYCE sushi meal that hadn't diminished in quality much if at all.

I'd been due to eat sushi with one of my pals for a while, and I convinced him to try this place instead of the usual ""Mon"" restaurants. We were planning a lunchtime meal, and Daisho still allows you to pay for the $25.95 AYCE dinner at any time of the day if you want to get access to special menu items (many of which are one-per-person).

I forgot to ask about whether they still offer fresh wasabi, which is a highlight at my favorite place. Oops.

An additional page has been added to the AYCE menu recently, and this one has various extra tapas/appetizers, some sashimi (one-per-person, dinner only), and some special rolls. My friends had cautioned me to steer clear of the pork belly and the sizzling beef, so I can't report on those. The takoyaki was surprisingly good, with a crispy exterior, tender interior, plentiful bonito flakes, and tasty sauce. The biggest drawback is that the actual tako (octopus) is a pretty small piece.

I also enjoyed the soft shell crab tempura (definitely use the sauce), the yuzu chili salmon ""salad"" (basically a sashimi), and the sashimi portions of super white tuna and yellowtail w/ jalapeño, but the portion sizes (e.g. nigiri cuts instead of true sashimi) were quite modest considering that these were all one-per-person. The relatively worst item was the ika butter (squid cooked in a sauce), which was a little chewy and forgettable flavor-wise. Lastly, the Iron Man roll (super white inside, tuna on top) was good and still quite palatable at the end of a huge meal.

The appetizers on the classic menu were just as good as before. Bacon enoki was my lone yakitori order. The bacon was meaty and smoky, though still lacking crunchiness, and the enoki was soft yet still has that snap. Miso black cod was still great, although I've tasted a better version of it and therefore don't think the world of this one. The yellowtail collar had meaty portions and fattier, more tender bits. Plus, after one past negative kama experience, ""not burnt"" is a positive. The fresh oysters were on the small side, but they were really good. The fried oysters were similarly small, which is unfortunate because it's linked to the fresh oysters as one-per-person. Lastly, the baked green mussels were cooked properly and not overly sauced.

Nigiri is still the sushi mainstay, and Daisho delivered for the most part. I loved the flavorful blue crab. The uni was as good as you expect to get in the AYCE quality range, and the amaebi was nice in spite of being a little mushy. Scallop (the good stuff, not bay scallop), yellowtail, and salmon were tasty. The fatty albacore wasn't flavorful, and the default wasabi sauce didn't help. The biggest letdown of the meal was the super white. I realized after ordering the super white tuna salad (a new, one-per-person menu item) and the super white nigiri that (1) they sauce all of their super white with this slightly spicy condiment, and (2) the quality of the super white itself is significantly worse than what other local places offer.

Dessert is one item per person. I won't dock them for what is unfortunately a common policy among these restaurants, but it's always enjoyable to have more dessert. I chose the fried banana this time, and I'm wondering now why I didn't order it in the first place. It's like the banana split in that it's topped with so-called vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles, but the banana pieces are fried and give a richness and a warm temperature contrast. Just like last time, I happened to have some leftover bacon to throw on top of this. Just like last time, I enjoyed it. Best AYCE sushi menu hack ever.

It was not very crowded at 1:30-ish, and they provided the expected quick service. The first round of items came out in quick succession from the chefs/kitchen after they'd handled the few other tables' orders, and other rounds seemed to arrive faster. Empty plates were quickly removed too. The only issue was that the server didn't seem to understand that we were ordering for each other or for ""the table,"" so to speak. For example, when we tried to order sashimi for the first and only time, she stopped us and told us that it was one per person. We had to start over and have me call for super white, and him call for the yellowtail. No biggie, but something to be aware of.

Along with the other minor food blemishes, the super white deficiency is why I've decided that I can only give four stars to what's otherwise a solid AYCE sushi restaurant. If you've been to a favorite AYCE sushi place too often and need to change it up, or if you want dinner variety at lunch hours, Daisho remains as good as any secondary options.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,5,4,9UDcb2PaQYvditzdAW0vFg

I (over)ordered the Alaskan, Eel, Salmon Skin, Spicy Scallop, and Spicy Yellowtail rolls. I didn't care so much for the Spicy Scallop and Spicy Yellowtail, but the rest was good. The simplest and cheapest turned out to be my favorite (the Alaskan, consisting of salmon and avocado).

Let me just say it's different when it's just a romantic date and a night out with friends. 

We come once a week to see our favorite server. 

When we came this past Friday, yes I'm aware it's a Friday in lent and a lot of people come to this place for a meat free meal. We came right after the rush and our server just seemed so tired or something. I mean she did mention her last table was 24 guests!!! 

We usually get too notch service when it's just the two of us but as a group it was a bit of a longer wait. 

I wouldn't wait 45 minutes for it again. My friends were just insisting we stay because it was a lot of food. 

I did notice though after about 30 minutes of waiting, our server asked us all if we wanted soup or salad while we waited. 
In that time we had already seen 3 other guests that arrived after us already chowin down!!

So we ended up waiting and had shoved our faces with delicious food right after the server dropped it off. 


Like I said, it's much better when it's just 2 on a romantic date!

We usually don't venture out to this side of town but after seeing so many delicious pictures posted by @aznttboy on my Instagram feed, we had to come check it out! 
Came on a Saturday morning so we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves..
Nice clean & open space. They are located in the same plaza as Walmart-neighborhood. 

My boyfriend went with the lunch AYCE while I paid a couple bucks extra and went with the dinner price.. I wanted to sample all the special 1per person/dinner only items..
-Oysters / were good!
-Yellowtail Poki / came on a bed of seaweed salad and was very good! You can also get tuna or salmon poki..
-Miso Cod / buttery and sweet! watch out for the bones though!
-Yakitori Skewers / we got bacon wrapped asparagus, enoki mushrooms, quail eggs & the tuna... These things are huge.. 2 sticks come in 1 order so don't order too much! Bacon anything is delicious although I would have liked the bacon to be a little bit more crisp.
-Nigiri / Everything was decently fresh and we didn't run into anything horrible but the standouts for me were the scallops and fatty albacore! mmmmmM
-Wild Fire Roll / (no rice) spicy tuna, tuna, albacore & soy paper.. Loved the presentation! 
-Miso Soup / seemed a bit watered down & they don't offer the option to add the shrimp head to it.
-Dessert / we had the standard green tea ice cream & yuzu sorbet.. hopefully they add some more creative desserts to the menu!

Service was fast from our server although sometimes it seemed there was a language barrier but he was very efficient. The sushi chef who helped us was nice and kept the conversation going and the food a-flowing.. Forgot his name but he likes to play golf and he is from S. Carolina LOL

4934542,2013-10-09,2,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"This place is a solid 2.5 so I have to be fair and round it up to a 3 star...

a.  Location - 5 star - On the southwest corner of Warm Springs and Eastern, very accessible from most parts of the valley. For us, it was a 10 minute easy drive from Henderson.

b.  Ambiance - 2 Star - A bit spartan in terms of feel and decor, however, that is cool. I would say the music was both loud and obnoxious.  Not sure how / why you would want your clients to dine in loud punkish modern music that is neither food for the soul or nurturing.  It was also loud enough that it nearly impeded conversation.

c.  Service - 2 Star - We got here at 6:00 and ordered two Bento type dishes and two AYCE sushi which comprised of about 5-6 choices.  Took about 50 minutes to get the first sushi after the two that had the Bento type boxes had theirs for about 15 minutes. I find that rather odd.  Also, when I asked for hot Green Tea, I was advised that they did not have green tea, but another kind.  I asked....is it Genmaicha and she came back with the little sweet tea bag that said genmaicha.  Well, I think I am a bit stuffy tea drinker because I like this type of tea in it's real form, a whopping two teaspoons of loose roasted rice and barley and tea leaves in a pot to steep and all the flavors of this very tasty tea.  Coming out of a tea bag..... nah.

d.  Food - 2 star - besides getting to us so late, here is the dealio:

- Bento Box with Teriyaki Beef - The beef was so dry and thin and overcooked and over sauced, it tasted like Costco Teriyaki Beef Jerky dipped in soy sauce. Wow. Both over powering and salty.

- Amaebi - This is a special dish I love because of the fresh raw shrimp and then the fried shrimp heads.  Where were the fried shrimp heads?  Come on, you cannot serve this dish half axx.  This is totally a boo hoo disappointing disaster.

- Maguro - I love to have Maguro Nigiri Sushi with a thin slice of lemon and thin slice of jalepeno. It really makes the taste perfect.  When you serve this with a SPAM size chunk of lemon and jalepeno, it actually over powers the Maguro and well, nigiri is all about complimentary and simple flavors, so this was a complete miss.  I had to remove all the lemon slices and jalepeno to make the maguro edible.

- Miso Cod, Hamachi Collar, Star Fish, Daisho Roll, Wild Fire, Mexican,   All the rolls were edible and uninspired. It did not help that they serve these sushi on huge American size platters instead of smaller plates that match. It was hard to fit plates onto our table, and it was very unappetizing.

e.  Overall - 2 star - really?  Food was barely adequate. Not prepared properly, Japanese is all about presentation and the food was poorly presented.  I was really shocked because after reading the review s I was raving to go celebrate my BD at this place and instead, I felt more like I compromised.   Worst part is that the place was empty for about 40 minutes and service was poor, then it was packed as so many groups came in, I had to go from shy asian boy to obnoxiously loud demanding diner boy and keep pushing for service, food and the bill...

I was shocked!  DAISHO in japanese means big victory or soaring large.  This place needs to change its name to something else....

GK says, OK, I was a year older and depressed.  Go check this place out.  I will come here again and give it a second chance. It was all me the first time........ Fried Shrimp Heads, here I come...",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,1,3,FXY2rtBBVRGkF9K_48-I4w

Do you want to make money? Or is it your clean up time? If so then change your hours because I believe you should service a customer fully if they are in your restaurant in time. But hey, that's just me.

Sushi places are a dime a dozen. You could literally eat at a new place once a week and who knows when you'll try them all. The sushi here is okay. Not bad, but not amazing.

And doing all you can eat every time you need something you have to wave them down and they barely acknowledge you if you order something. They're not friendly. And this was not just a one-time thing we go here once a week and the few times we've sat at the bar have been awful they're just so rude and unfriendly. I will continue to go here and sit at a table because the food is good and I like the location but I don't recommend sitting at The sushi bar,iEzB9zPPx1wgkWQAv3wYmQ,0,0,3,8dSAssSOA7rsHUHGNPZDew

Service was wonderful. The only complaint would be that the rolls were very small. I don't know if this is standard or because they have a grand opening special with 50 percent off their rolls. That is only reason I deducted one star UPDATE: we went back for lunch again. This time we had a crunch shrimp roll and a California crunch roll. They were both seemed a lot bigger.

5139897,2013-10-02,0,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"Another AYCE sushi joint in Vegas??  

The reason why I am giving them 5 stars :

Yakitori is GREAT.  Asparagus, Enoki, Quail Egg...all great!  Great sauce, great cooking consistency...yummy!

The Apps...some great ones here.  The Ahi Poke was plentiful and fresh, Oysters were smooth and also fresh tasting, Sake Kama was delicious and cooked perfectly (unlike the Hamachi Kama).  Nice to change it up a little besides just the run of the mill sushi.

The ROLLS.  I don't usually eat rolls...I am more of a nigiri guy myself.  But the few rolls I tried actually impressed me!  They aren't completely drenched in heavy sauces, and have lots of flavor!  The ones I enjoyed most :

Starfish : Yellowtail Tempura, Tuna, Daikon, Ponzu, and Wasabi Oil. Delicious!! Best ""roll"" I had here, especially since there is no rice!  I'd order this every time I am here!

Wild Fire : Spicy Tuna, Chopped Albacore, and Garlic Sauce. This was pretty good...lots of fish in each bite.

What's Wrong Roll : Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Masago, Rainbow Fish, and Screaming Orgasm Sauce. I liked this roll as well...the soft shell crab adds a nice taste and consistency.

Overall, the nigiri was also fresh and tasty.  I enjoyed the Uni here, Salmon Belly, Garlic Ahi, and Hotate.  Good cuts!

Finish off with some Plum Ice Cream! I enjoyed this much more than the Yuzu...good stuff!  They also made us some bacon ice cream...good!

Very clean restaurant, and the servers and staff were very fast, efficient and friendly.

I like to go because children eat free with their parents. Today they told me that I'd have to pay half price ($13) for my daughter if she were to share with me, whom is only 30lbs. This was very misleading as the previous times I never had to pay for her and no where on the menus or displays does it say they charge depending on age. The all you can eat menu even says that children can share with all you can eat parents. She's 5 years old but because she's so small she eats just as much as a 2 year old. I ended up ordering her a full plate of yakisoba (this was the cheaper choice) for $7 which she barely put a dent in. We took nearly the whole thing home. When I spoke to the manager, he said that it was a normal thing and they have always charged. He said they always charge based on age because children eat at varying levels. I told him to look at her and look at how much she ate (or didn't) and he continued to argue with me. After arguing back and forth I thanked him for his time and told him I will never be back but he didn't care. He really needs to clarify this, fix the menu, and most of all fix his customer service skills!

5319222,2013-09-26,1,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"We went here with a group of Yelpers. Honestly, I was having second thoughts about this place since the reviews seem inconsistent but with Tony T's guidance, we seem to have picked the right stuff from the menu. There were a few hiccups so I can't give this place shining 5 stars.

I tried the miso black cod, bacon-wrapped enoki, bacon-wrapped quail eggs, bacon-wrapped asparagus, yakitori beef, salmon poke, tuna poke, oysters, salmon skin handroll, uni, unagi, salmon, garlic tuna, amaebi, salmon collar, hamachi collar, Wild Fire, spicy tuna cracker, Starfish, fried bananas, red bean ice cream and yuzu ice cream.

5/5:
I love bacon so obviously the clear winners for me were the bacon-wrapped quail eggs, asparagus and enoki mushrooms. Also, 5-star worthy items like oysters, salmon nigiri (super good!), Wild Fire (tuna, spicy tuna, soy paper, chopped albacore in garlic sauce. NO RICE) and Starfish (yellowtail tempura, daikon, scallion, tuna in ponzu and wasabi oil. NO RICE). Yuzu ice cream - I haven't been to an AYCE sushi restaurant that serves yuzu ice cream.

4/5:
Salmon poke, tuna poke, garlic tuna, miso black cod (reminds me of Shiro's in Seattle), amaebi, salmon collar, spicy tuna cracker, fried bananas (get it with vanilla ice cream and well-rendered bacon topping) and salmon skin handroll (crispy skin).

3/5:
Yakitori beef, uni (was a little bit watery), unagi. Hamachi collar was charred on the outside but undercooked on the inside. I was craving for some shrimp tempura. Melvin ordered it but it didn't look so promising and he said it was just ok so I didn't bother ordering it.

They give you real plates instead of the usual sushi plate and they'll give you a clean one if your plate gets really messy. The chef/owner kept checking on us and gave us beer on the house. After ordering 6-7 hamachi collars and 6-7 salmon collars, the restaurant smelled like smoke they had to keep the door open.

The service was great but I'm not sure if it's because we were with Tony or if it's because we're Yelpers or if it's because that's just the way they treat all their customers. I would have to come back again to figure that out...eventhough this is far from home, I wouldn't mind coming back here. $20 for lunch (11am-4pm) and $25 for dinner (4pm-close) and the food is pretty good.

However, I know I will not be returning, only for the 1 reason that made the experience horrible. There is 1 apparent regular that pushed the limits of being loud and obnoxious. He sat at the bar verbally bashing just about everyone and everything in the place during his drunken stupor.

He is amazing in his own right and can pump out some amazing signature creations catered to your taste. I ventured here with a coworker and chowed down on some rolls and nigiri. She ordered a few of the fried appetizers and enjoyed them all. The nigiri was fresh and the specials were surprising for a lunch menu price. The sharks tale roll was tasty. The salmon and hamachi nigiri were so fresh we ordered multiples.

I'll attribute it to being a rookie Yelper that wrote a snap review because my gullet couldn't be fed at a fast enough pace. Since I thought the sushi was good the first time, I should have stopped back again before I wrote my review to see if they would show their true colors, and they have. I have returned 6 times over the last year and the service has been significantly better.

There seems to be stability in the employee turnover as we have had the same servers on the last three visits. Everyone is more attentive and the waits to order more food are pretty much non existent. The kitchen seems to always be on the slow side, but the sushi chefs have consistently been more efficient compared to my initial visit.

In the last year, the actual menus have been replaced, but the content is pretty much the same. Keep an eye on the specials board because they'll occasionally throw something different into the mix, like blue fin tuna or jellyfish. More recently, I've been sticking to just the apps and nigiri, so I can't comment on the roll situation.

Sometimes the uni has me raising an eyebrow, but I think their sushi is just fine for AYCE level, and good enough to make return trips for $26 a pop when I'm in the area.

Getting our car serviced near by and yelped Daisho as the closest and highest reviews in the general area and took a shot. Went for the lunch $21.95 all you can eat and wow, talk about taking you for a ride. Guys I know it's all you can eat but really way too much rice to fill you up..the proportions are just greedy. Not only that but the fish wasn't fresh, especially the mackerel (which for those who eat it, it's naturally fishy already) was brown and old looking/tasting. If it's not fresh, why serve it. Sorry to go back to the rice, it also was undercooked, had some crunchy pieces that were dry. Hate that. 

Service was lackluster. They don't even say hello and goodbye when you leave as in traditional Japanese restaurants. It's funny my wife said even how they walked look like they were dragging their feet. 

We complained, paid $70 for two adults and a child, and left hungry because we didn't want to order just to order. 

It's sad because the place looks like it would be a good neighborhood sushi joint, but look elsewhere...NO DAISHO FOR ME.",-YLiMJ0xeWxqny9O9YKzoA,4,1,2,xIKBkE00xZgPXa3ryPr4IA

We were seated & all was good until our waitress came. She was very rude about explaining how their 50% off on special rolls. My daughter only wanted an order of California Roll & she insisted we get two roll since it was 50% off but we told her no, she only wants 1 order of it but she still continued to say ""you should order two and just take it home is she doesn't finish"" and again we said ""no"". We go on with our order and she brings back a teriyaki crab roll & California roll. I told her we didn't order the teriyaki & she took it back with an attitude. They didn't much of a good option for dessert either. Restroom door was very hard to open especially for a child.

5918672,2013-09-12,11,5JjGTaZkHbbjBrzBODcsAQ,"Daisho Sushi is a moderate drive away from me (located in a large strip mall on the corner of S. Eastern and E. Warm Springs), but after making my way across town to try out their Dinner AYCE sushi, I am definitely a fan and considered the drive here well worth the effort for good food.

As the restaurant is still relatively new, they were not all that busy tonight (plus it was raining, and you know who people here shy away from driving under such precipitous conditions). So after being seated at the sushi bar, it was pretty much just me and Michael K here at the ~70 seats capacity sushi restaurant giving their menu a taste drive.

We started off with the usual limited to one per person orders: 
Uni, Sweet Shrimp and Blue Crab nigiri, they were good.  

We also gravitated towards their APPITIZERS section, and had ordered:
* Salmon Collar (the salmon was so tasty and naturally fatty, it was amazing, like having ""Kobe"" salmon) and Yellowtail Collar (cooked just right and I really enjoyed it with and without the accompanied ponzu dipping sauce)

* Yaki-tori (skewers): Bacon wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Bacon wrapped Quail eggs, Bacon wrapped Asparagus.  At other restaurants you can order just skewers, paired with responsible consumption of beer and sake and call a great night out.  I really enjoyed these.

* Shrimp Bomb (it is like the Jalapeno popper with shrimp and crab, but without the jalapeno).

* Miso Black Cod - tasty!  Insane in the membrane that this is in the AYCE line up!!!

* Tuna Poki - the poki are prepared to order, not something that was made hours ago and left marinating in the cooler.

* Yellowtail Poki

SPECIAL ROLLS:
* Star Fish (No Rice) made with Yellowtail Tempura, Daikon and wrapped in Tuna, finished with Wasabi Oil, Ponzu and Scallion.  (Recommended)

* Johny Roll (No Rice) made with Crab Meat, Shrimp Tempura wrapped in thin strip of cucumber and finished with Spicy Yum Sauce.

* Wild Fire Roll (No Rice) consist of Tuna, Spicy Tuna wrapped in Soy Paper, topped with Albacore and finished with Garlic Sauce.

* What's Wrong Roll (recommended by Chef Michael) made with Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Green Onions, Masago, Spicy Yum Sauce, topped with assorted fish and finished with Screaming Orgasm Sauce.

I could totally put away more food, but I have an appearance to make at Bacchanal the next day and thought I take it easy and just finished the meal with some Fried Banana with Ice Cream (it was a nice finish to the meal, but nothing that blows me away).

Totally satisfied and very impressed with the food we were served tonight.  There seems to be a handful of new sushi restaurants opening in Las Vegas recently, and most have had positive reviews thus far. So if the other freshmen sushi restaurants are as good as Daisho Sushi (which I now easily considered in my top 3 Las Vegas AYCE sushi restaurant list), the rest of the old guards will have good competition to keep everyone on their toes.  That is good news for all the diners out there.

Note:  Aside from AYCE sushi, Daisho also offers a la carte items for lunch and dinner in addition to their lunch and dinner specials.  And dinner starts from 4pm until closing.  Pricing are very competitive for AYCE (especially lunch, which does not seem to have a reduction in the selections available).

About the Chef: (kernels of knowledge gleamed from small talk during our meal)
Chef Michael is from New York. His parents own a Japanese Ramen, Yaki-tori (Japanese skewers) and Sushi restaurant there.  So even before moving out to Las Vegas and working as one of the sushi chefs at Blue Ribbon Sushi (inside The Cosmopolitan), he was already familiar with the competitive restaurant business. So finally opening Daisho Sushi here in Las Vegas, just seems like the natural path of progression for this passionate young chef in a new city he now calls home.  (Haha, I sound like his autobiographer).


5 stars!  But as words spread and more and more people learn about Daisho Sushi, and the restaurant undoubtedly gets busier, I hope they can keep up with the projected increased interest in their restaurant and the food they serve.  Good luck Daisho Sushi!!!  And I will definitely be back and bringing friends to tryout the amazing food I had earlier tonight.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,25,16,5,ozZdAxggOPEb3JHMp8HXsg

I told her that their menu says $8.95 so $4.00 in tax makes no sense. She says ""oh, those prices changed a long time ago"". So they don't care that their menus are nearly a year outdated and their prices increased by 50%!

They are still offering their regular rolls for 50% off so I got a few off the menu to try. My dining companion ordered the lunch special, which was also a pretty good deal. 

The fish was all pretty fresh and the rolls were made well. I would have given them 4 stars if service was a bit better. I know they were a little busy, but drinks went unfilled and our food came out slow. Their AYCE prices were reasonable and I have a Groupon burning a hole in my pocket, so I will be back.

Nothing was really spectacular, aside from the baked mussels & the salmon skin hand roll. Service was good, and quick. However, my friend ordered fried bananas at last call only to find out ten minutes later the oil had been turned off and they weren't able to fry it. The manager was nice enough to come over and aplogize about it, which we appreciated.
