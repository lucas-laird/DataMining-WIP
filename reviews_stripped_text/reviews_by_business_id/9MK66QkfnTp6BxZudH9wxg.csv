What shame it is to come in 20 mins to closing to be told there are no more rolls. Uh huh! Yeah sure.  What this person didn't count on was there was a person with car trouble right outside the shop. We decided to stay and help. I watched this same person who told me there were "" no more rolls"" make sandwiches for himself.  How would I know that?? Because no one else showed up and we were there long past closing time. In fact this same man who lied also ran out to go talk to his ride while still wearing his food service gloves.  Then after that and I watched him package his sandwiches then he started cleaning the front counter.  Apparently this location is no longer interested in making money or keeping customers.

The vegetarian turkey is my go to sub and the sandwich alone is usually enough to satiate my hunger.  Occasionally, I hit up the Vegetarian Cheeseburger sub or the Veggie Philly Cheesesteak if I'm in the mood for meat-like goodness.  Aside from the sub, Capriotti's offers a wide array of kettle-cooked potato chips (my favorite I might add), diversely flavored potato chips, and, to my surprise, bundt cakes.

This Capriotti's is pretty much the only one located on my side of town (East Side). It happens to be located in a decent shopping center though, one that is much newer than the surrounding area. The place is SMAAAAALLLL. Although I've noticed that with quite a few Cap's. I think their main idea must be, get this sandwich and get outta here.

My fiance and I arrived here in the afternoon one day of the week and there were a few other customers. He got the Bobbie and I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak and was enticed into adding peppers - NEVER AGAIN. And never again will I order the Philly Cheese Steak! MEH! The steak was definitely overcooked and the peppers were way too overpowering. I wouldn't even order it without the peppers. I'm sticking to the Bobbie or one of their cold-cut sandwiches.

Overall I like Cap's, but it is kind of on the pricey side and on more than one visit I've been kind of disappointed (not just this location).

This location was clean though and the employees were nice guys too. If I was rating just based off service, this would probably be a 4-star, but I have to take the fact that the sandwich really was not all that good into consideration.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,COwnruNaw6VuNvIXHKgdMw

As far as I know there are no Capriotti's in Los Angeles so I won't be able to celebrate thanksgiving any time I want. Sad. 

Staff are always cool. It's a requirement there.

I once had another sandwich not called the Bobbie. It was pastrami and cole slaw. B+",wZRbLxsopoe0-FyWGt9SrQ,0,0,5,wfLZ7bkb26A1BlDBELXB9w

I was on my way to get my iphone 5 next door at the at & t store where I stumbled upon this shop. My friend were all raving about this franchise and I thought I give it a shot.

WOW WOW WOW. Absolutely amazing capastrami. Finished a foot long by myself and absolutely enjoyed coming here. Brought 2 friends from out of town and they were blown out of their head too.

Absolutely bomb diggity!",gm20Rasn38z5xdnd7_iM4g,3,2,5,f7u63ODuYHyLGyep2vw-JQ

I like the way they make my Fav, Ham and provolone with everything and their sweet cherry peppers..I actually also tried (off the menu) the Capicola and provolone same way! Very clean place. Great atmosphere too. Keep up the good work, love your ingredients with deli thin slices.",v4WB-qGb4mSIOilHK6i-xg,4,3,5,ZE2VADPo99b0reRjWCVyFw
5351430,2011-04-29,2,9MK66QkfnTp6BxZudH9wxg,Hmmm Let me see if i can find one bad thing to say about Capriotti's. Nope I cant. I always get the cheesesteak sub and it never lets me down. Every time im in town I hit up Cappys as we have yet to have one in Denver but they expanded to Davenport IA Go figure. And this time they had Brownies which i had one. It was oh so delicious. I agree Phone in or Fax ordering would be nice. And BEER,A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,1,1,5,aCO205iO3iOtgnEigxnbZg

We called them and they do not answer the phone properly. Please get a better night staff. Laurel & Hardy is not funny!,JGQdTcuVGacoKl8e9Cu_-Q,0,0,2,fuYyP5iC_StG-xygcRlhmA

Young female with orange hair, freckles, and heavy makeup made my food. 
I had:  
-A small bobbie ($6.60)- You can't go wrong.  I gave an extra star just for this sandwich. White roll, stuffing, cranberry, turkey, and mayo.  
-Cap's creation salad ($5.99 +$1.00 extra for meat)
THEY FORGOT MY TUNA...didn't notice until I got home. I'm so irritated. 
I asked the gal if they have banana peppers and she said no, but they have sweet peppers.  They were disgusting...imagine green bell peppers made into a sweet pickle.  Bleck! I picked them all off.  
Dressing is T. Marzetti's from an individual pack.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,2,otximxOL-CuhmP-H3ZhJtw
