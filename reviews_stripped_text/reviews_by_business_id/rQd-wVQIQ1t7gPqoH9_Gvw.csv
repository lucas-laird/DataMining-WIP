SUPER EXCITED they had another location near my job! Great food, great service,  my favorite family owned little restaurant",qsXUykmSlRGtf0wIx08_cw,1,0,5,_XnXUFRywBz08X6KR9H5ow

Regardless it looked good, big menu. I ordered 4 Tacos de Canasta for $3.50. They where good but really small. If you're hungry this won't do the job. It's family owned and that cool but they have their daughter working the cashier and seems mom running the kitchen on her own. They are extremely busy. I went there for lunch and had to end up taking my food to go cause it took 40 mins to complete the order. Maybe it was a busy day or they where short staffed but I probably won't stop their again since it would be during my lunch hour and I don't want to be late again.",BD6wfWTT--CGMzfOJPv1cg,0,0,2,D8jFG_x-7h9k_s6J-xecCQ

Very nice portions, I ask for a Cuban Torta and it took me 3 days to finish it",yzlc_sXL7oyj0ueBle96SA,1,0,5,7IXlvrChyVMp9iRXMj9yfQ

Also had the mango and the cantaloupe Aguas Frescas. So yummy too. I gave 4 stars because my son ordered a burrito that had more rice than anything else in it....otherwise, 5 stars.",jZadhxW8fLM5zEt40Pw_bg,0,0,4,xzNIbsorICCRGQMrHD1Fpw
3035347,2016-09-24,2,rQd-wVQIQ1t7gPqoH9_Gvw,My husband asked me to join him for lunch. Ordered my grandson chicken nuggets. First of all they look nothing like chicken nuggets second they were so hard he couldn't even chew them.  The salsa wasn't spicy at all barely had any flavor. my rice and beans had no flavor.  the best thing here was the handmade tortillas. Not returning. Kids were serving us.,cjb89-_gvMVlbD-W5e5QcQ,0,0,1,2GHwdmE0qfbCMev7nou3Sg

Had the order which came with 4 Street size tacos. 2 Beans , 1potatoes , 1 Chicharrón. Super tasty but must admit in my personal opinion very small. I could have had at least 3 more tacos since they were he very small!  They do have a B rating and observed a few things as to the reason for the B rating. However I must admit the food had great Flavor. Defiantly good to eat while getting a car wash for  lunch or a quick snack.  They do deliver via Bite squad.   Also  don't expect no grand presentation with the food just great taste.",3cBVCNsm273EJ_GM4FVvJg,0,0,4,pRFnqBJoZgAdEcmI6Ap1Jg

The staff is extremely pleasant and love their work. They really take a personal interest. I love their food. Each dish is authentic. It really is like visiting a friend for a home cooked meal. I again choice the chile relleno today. It was again perfect. All the combination plates are awesome and very inexpensively priced. The food is quality. Drinks are inexpensive. Try it once and you will be back!,pJP3wahfq3WE7E9VmD3-yw,4,2,5,71BcScwplRvASpIoJjRHQg
