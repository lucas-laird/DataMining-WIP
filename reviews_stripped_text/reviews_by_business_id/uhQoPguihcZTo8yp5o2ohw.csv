The only gripe I have with this establishment r the hostesses. They rather spend the work hours talking to one another than taking care of customers. There is especially one which unfortunately I didn't get her name was the rudest of the bunch. The whole time I was asking her a simple question. She just walk on without replying.

I believe we paid $13,99 each. Not bad at all, considering steak is an expensive thing plus all you can eat. Let me tell you the steak was delicious! I've tried a lot of stuff there, including the salad bar and pasta and desert. I went each single day of our stay there because I loved the food.

759587,2016-04-12,0,uhQoPguihcZTo8yp5o2ohw,"First impressions: The cashier was very sweet, she complimented my purse and told me how skinny I was. With the B-connected card, I paid $7.56 for lunch on a Monday (including tax and beverage). As soon as I sat down, I was promptly greeted and brought my drink of choice. I perused the choices and began to wonder if I should have listened to the advice of many other Yelpers who highly discouraged others from visiting the buffet. There seemed to be a few good choices, but some items looked pretty unappealing. I proceeded trying to keep an open mind, the buffet was $7 after all! 

I began with the Mongolian BBQ station, excited because my regular Mongolian joint back home had recently closed. I chose my items and was a bit disappointed at their lack of noodles. The man working the station was very nice. While waiting for my plate, I tried to take a look behind the counter. Not fantastically clean, but not horrible, nothing crawling around at least! I saw nothing that made me run out. Once I started on my plate, I began to wonder more and more if I should have risked this place. The meat (beef and chicken) were quite bland (probably because teriyaki sauce was not poured onto the food until right before it touched the plate). Since the food wasn't completely awful, I continued with my plate. All complaints aside, the Mongolian BBQ guy did give me an impressive amount of meat. After several bites and sips of soda though, I began to feel a bit queasy. I attributed this to my reading of other reviews claiming food poisoning, probably all in my head. Being unsure about the food, I ate quite slowly. I found it a little weird how quickly the meat on my plate became luke warm/cold but figured that I had just eaten it too slowly. On to another plate! 

Having grown up by the ocean in California, I tend to stay away from seafood in a place like Las Vegas. This seemed like an especially good choice based on other food at the buffet so far.

I grabbed a couple of things from the Chinese food area. The sweet and sour chicken looked pretty good. It had a hint of good flavor but for the most part was just too bland for me (and this is coming from a pretty picky eater who often enjoys bland foods...). The worst thing about the chicken was the temperature though, calling it luke warm would be a generous overstatement. The steamed white rice on the other hand, was fluffy and tasted as it should. It could have been warmer, but maybe that's asking too much here. I ate quite a bit of the plain white rice, all the while wondering if I would regret this meal later. 

Although I had yet to visit the American, Mexican, Italian, or dessert stations, I opted to end my buffet experience in fear that I would spend the rest of my last day in Vegas sick in my room from the buffet food. 

In the end, I did not get sick from eating at the buffet but felt pretty thankful of this. A friend of mine who are her at another point during our trip thinks she got a little sick from eating here, but she wasn't quite sure. 

Even for the fantastic price, I would still suggest avoiding this buffet and eating at another fairly cheap option at Suncoast. ""The Game"" sports bar has great food and is very reasonably priced.",POELwhmAPmxoXXzXUG07lQ,0,0,2,aUPURtw4NBtMKOVJCtNi7w

I'm not sure if this is an isolated incident or if something has changed.  Should we chance it again?  Did we piss off the mongolian cook by overloading our vegetable bowl?  Were the waiters spiking our water?  Who knows.

So basically the buffet for an adult was $7 but we had to pay $12 in order for our children to come to the buffet. A child who usually eats half as much as what the adults would eat had to pay twice as much.

1099120,2010-12-22,1,uhQoPguihcZTo8yp5o2ohw,"Compromise is an important component in every relationship. Except food.

This buffet, located in the Suncoast casino, is a compromise in every sense. There are far better buffets out there, such as Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, Studio B at M Resort, and the Cosmopolitan's new Wicked Spoon (blatant plug there). If it's not in your budget, there's the Carnival World Buffet at Rio. Don't want to go to the strip? Try Feast Buffet at Red Rock. Don't feel like driving all the way out to the 215 and Charleston? You've pretty much compromised your way into this.

When you walk in, you'll notice the average age of the clientele is 800. Factor in the staff and it brings it down to 780. The place is small, the staff is not always friendly, or present, and you feel like ordering a Metamucil the moment you walk in.

The food is meh. Decent roast beef and pizza. Small salad bar. Cold fried catfish. Really? The only time catfish should be cold is when you fish it out of the water. I waited for ten minutes for someone at the carving station, and he only came out after I reached for the knife and fork to serve myself. My waitress didn't refill my drinks until (conveniently enough) I was ready to leave and tip out. 

Redeeming qualities: It's cheap and on the Westside.

1232549,2012-04-01,3,uhQoPguihcZTo8yp5o2ohw,"I don't go to the Suncoast. Ever. 

I had only been in there on one occasion before yesterday and that was to see Paranormal Activity with some friends. That was almost 3 years ago, and even back then I could see that I definitely wasn't missing much. 

Yesterday, I just so happened to be at Tivoli Village for the first time (I also see I wasn't missing a whole lot there either, but that's a different review), and since none of the restaurants in there appealed to me and the friend I was with, we decided to just drive across the street to the Suncoast. Turns out this was a bad idea.

The whole place just felt very......empty. There was no line for the buffet whatsoever, and when is someone NOT happy about that? That's the gift. What lies within the buffet is the curse. 

Not having to wait in line was nice. The price wasn't bad either, $8.99 to be exact. The service: so-so. Our waitress always had a smile, but she wasn't the most attentive either. The ambiance was quiet. Way too quiet. The place also had this creepy, medieval dungeon like feel to it. *shivers* As for the food? Oh dear.

To begin, let me tell you something funny: the section that was labeled seafood had none whatsoever. It was used for cold cuts and bread. (Yes, you read that right. This is a buffet that has cold cuts.) The stromboli and taquitos were so dry. Quite possibly the blandest sweet potato fries I've ever had. The best part had to be the waffle fries and the spring rolls unfortunately. As for my friend, she claimed her food (which included some of those cold cuts from the ""seafood"" section) smelled funny and had to stop eating because the smell was making her sick. 

Why 2 stars and not 1? Pumpkin Cheesecake in the dessert section, that's why. Ironically the only buffet I have ever been to which serves it. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros: 
Cheap.
Pumpkin Cheesecake.

Cons:
Generally gross.
Slightly creepy interior. 
Severely lacking in variety. 

Suggestions: Just go to another buffet.

Return factor: Nada, not even for the pumpkin cheesecake.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,3,2,2,vTYPX0s5O_B-W37LZi8ayA

It doesn't get much cheaper than that for lunch.  Dinner was $12.99.  That was just OK.  For the price difference, we did not get much more for dinner.  So I would say that the dinner was just an average deal.  Unless you come for the crab on Friday, or the prime rib on Satuday, you will probably get tired of the same food here very quickly.  I haven't tried the Champagne brunch.  I'll try that next time.  Service was very good.  We paid a tip when we paid for dinner, so the servers knew we had already tipped.

While both the Strip casinos and local ones have all been busy trying to find more creative ways to offer less and charge more, St Tropez is the only one I know of that has actually improved the quality of what they offer.

The salad bar is well stocked and fresh (although it'd be great if they served a fresh dressing or two). They have a nice sampling of fruit. They have good soups as well.  Disappointingly, the Chinese station needs a lot of work. Their Chinese soups taste strongly of the cans they came from. 

What is to be applauded is that they have a real seafood station. At lunchtime they have a nice variety of fish and real fried shrimp.

The chef in charge has done a good job balancing offering some tasty fresh food options while staying on a tight budget. 
 
Service overall is friendly and attentive. The only issue is they close the buffet line between meals. It's a real hassle and sometimes creates long lines.

Deborah, one of the manager I always see working, pays close attention to everything and it shows. 

The buffet has improved dramatically over the past year. If you have not tried it lately,  you may want to give it another chance. There's lots of things they could do better but the fact they are trying shines clearly through.

Not your average day, I expected things to be a clusterFk, much like how RedRock and neighboring restaurants were the day before. There was a line, but it was only a few minutes deep, and with a staff of at least four working the registers, all was well managed. Beyond being well-managed, there was graciousness of hospitality and true civility.

I want to be clear about that here. The majority of my fellow diners were old codgers sporting their Korean and Vietnam war covers and shirts. I was thanked by staff for my service at least three different times, but it was the graciousness with which I saw these other men treated that, on my first visit to Suncoast, made the glowing impression. They were thanked, offered a beer, escorted to their tables, and waited on as if they were high-rollers spending the big bucks instead of sitting down to enjoy a free meal. This is how I like to imagine my grandfather, shuffling in with his cane, would have been treated back in the day for his WWII service. 

Respect. 
Simple acknowledgement.

St. Tropez didn't skimp on the day, either. As my plate suggests, there was a wide variety of items to try, my favorite being the generous filets of swordfish. Swordfish! That pricey, healthy cut so seldom enjoyed even at home was there in bulk. Delish and filling. Side that with some tasty greens, al dente pasta, large Italian sausage, and a tiramisu for dessert?

Saturday breakfast and lunch are the same price ($8.99) with your players card.

French toast, pancakes and scrambled eggs were solid. Bacon and sausage were good, but the turkey sausage was hard as a rock. Fresh fruit was a hit or miss, but the canned fruit was fine. After 10:30 they shut down pretty much all the stations while they got lunch ready. Lunch started promptly at 11. I found that many of the lunch items were not good. The alfredo sauce, for example, was really lumpy which is never a good sign. The chicken picatta had a gelatinous sauce on top of it which was very off putting, and the fried ravioli were luke warm. Considering lunch had just started you would expect the items to be in good condition and HOT. The salad bar was fresh and the Mongolian station looked promising, although I did not try it.

The dinner is reasonably priced if you're not particularly looking for something. 

Saturday night is prime rib and shrimp scampi. Not the greatest but not the worst either. 

The other stations are so so. 

If you have a comp then this would be four stars. If you had to pay, it's more of a two and a half but the service that you'll receive rounds it up to three stars and I feel that's fair. 

The plates are cleared the moment you're finished and the drinks are topped off. 

The dining area is comfortable. The seats and booths are well placed. 

The only thing that I didn't like we're the extendable dining tables as they were a bit wobbly and silverware kept falling.

The desserts were decent but not many options to choose from. 

The ice cream wasn't dryers which I prefer and the consistency wasn't right. It's probably their settings. I still finished it though. 

At the end of the day, what it came down to was I came in hungry and left full.

For the price, the food at the Suncoast buffet, especially the breakfast and Sunday brunch buffet, is better than it needs to be. As a frequent diner at this and other buffets in town, Suncoast does a consistently better job than any of the other ""locals"" resort buffets.

I suspect some of the negative reviews come from folks who are expecting a four star restaurant dining experience. We have enjoyed dozens of buffet meals at the Suncoast and have always left feeling we got more than our money's worth.

2719288,2015-04-02,1,uhQoPguihcZTo8yp5o2ohw,"Ok, stopped here twice. Once for lunch, once for breakfast.

Lunch on Saturday - The signs all over the casino advertised an $8.99 buffet. So I walked up and figured I'd try it. First problem - It's only $8.99 if you're a member of the ""Connect Players Club"", the free in-house gambling loyalty program. If I wanted the $8.99 price I would have to wander off somewhere else in the Casino over to member services or something and sign up for the free loyalty program. I wasn't about to go figure that out (we were staying here on a rock climbing trip - not a gambling trip). So I paid full price, which was almost $15.

For the price, the buffet wasn't that great. Decent amount of choices for lunch type foods. But it was basically just the same as Old Country Buffet. This was not one of those fabled amazing cheap, amazing tasting Vegas buffets of mystery and legend.

On the other hand, everything was rotated in and out quickly so it was always fresh. Everything I tried (Pizza, Turkey, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies, Baked Chicken) was all pretty good. The soda and drinks are not self serve, but the waitress was very quick and friendly and kept us topped up. Overall for lunch I would have given three stars.

Now on Sunday, I'm subtracting a star. Again there were signs all over for a breakfast buffet. $8.99. This time I noticed the asterisk. I figured that was the loyalty card price. Three of us went downstairs anyway, expecting to pay a little more than that since we didn't have the cards, but not much more. I mean it was breakfast after all. So we get down there and are informed that because it's Sunday, there is no breakfast buffet. It's ""Champions Brunch"" and it's $24.99. Yikes. No way. Based on the food we already tried, there wasn't anything at all that could be good enough to be worth that.

Well, salad bar is ok, tomatoes cracked and not -so-fresh but you can find some good stuff.
Tuna salad is NOT fresh and tastes funny, like it is carbonated. BBQ ribs - looks good, suppose to be mild, juicy and falling apart... nope, beware, you bite it and may broke your teeth, it tastes and feels like rubber wheel or something so you can get stuck. Yuck!  Salmon is dry and hard, and even pork chops is hard and slightly savour!
Watermelon bowl empty. Sweet pies all about the same, difference in décor. Cream puffs shell overcooked - so hard , you can cut your mouth with that like with a blade....
No good seafood like sushi or seaweed salad or fried calamari or scallops....  well, no good seafood like in other buffets around. One or two lonely crab legs swimming in big bowl of murky liquid...
About ANY other local buffet (except Silverton casino buffet) is better!
All food honestly doesn't worth that price. And I notice manager with kind-of eastern european name on the badge going around and mixing that food to make it look more attractive - instead of changing it to fresh.
Want some good buffet nearby? Better walk a few hundred feet more and go to the Rampart casino buffet, that way better!  Rampart buffet  have good food - juicy, tasty and fresh -  and sweets different,  just beautiful & awesome!   I will never ever go to Suncoast buffet for dinner again!

Despite there being cashiers and hosts and a manager no one seemed to have ever seen the coupons that all these places have for locals every week, or the comp slips that loyal gamblers get from the casino. Literally every single customer seemed like the end of the world as these people had no idea what to do with the coupons or how to process them.

Meanwhile, a host and a manager are getting into a yelling fight in front of everyone when they could have moved the shouting match 4 feet and out of sight of the rest of us.

I had not eaten there or if I did, I don't remember it which means to me, it was okay but nothing I would do again.

All the dishes I had were very good, and our server was xcellent!l.  He remembered my parents and asked why they stopped coming, and I said because of your food.  Then I was told they r under new management, and I met one of the managers named Andrew to talk to him. He said they have been and still are putting in a lot of time and effort to turn around this declining buffet so. . .

The variety of dishes is awkward - why is there a cabbage-based dish at nearly every station?! The only thing I ""liked"" (I use quotations because liked is loosely used here) was the collard greens. The taco meat wasn't bad. The potato knish was just a ball 'o pepper. The stuffing was tasteless. 

I'm a ""hit 'em were it hurts"" person with buffets, opting for the more expensive dishes like meats and such. I ended up resorting to a dinner roll and some extremely dry fried chicken. 

If this is your only option and you need to eat somewhere convenient, then fine. But there is a TGI Friday's about 100 feet away and I am sure your $13.99 (or $8.99 if you're a member of the player's club) would be much better spent and enjoyed.

Came here one day for lunch with the fam because I had a coupon (yay for being a Club Coast playa) and for the price, a reasonable $7.99 a person.  It's ok for a quick lunch buffet with most of the general fixings.

You got your American, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, salad bar, and dessert station all represented here.  I gotta say though for me the standout is the Mongolian station.  Damn, they make a fine stir-fry!  Really, it is way better than those you see at the local Chinese buffets.  I swear it must be the sauce!  The sauce is boss!  Pick your veggies and your protein of choice (I always go beef and shrimp) and it gets Mongolian-ed right in front of you!  That soy sauce concoction they use really makes it though.  It's got the right taste, salty, sweet, a bit tangy...it's very good.  Helps too if the veggies and meat are fresh.

The other plus I've found here is that they serve Stuffed Cabbage!  Yep, I love me some old school, down-home cookin'.  Only buffet I know so far that serves it.  May not be like Mom used to make, but it'll do in a buffet pinch.  Brings me back home!

Other than that, the food here is average.  The place is pretty clean and the service is speedy but polite.  You may want to watch the food however, some things looks like they sat out under the heat lamp for a good bit.  Soggy pizza?  No thank you!

The gelato station was a nice touch with some interesting flavors.  The blood orange was tart and sweet, so nice.  My fav though was the coconut, always a plus to end my buffet jaunt.  

If you're cheap and broke like me, St. Tropez is not a bad way to go.  It's no Bellagio or Wynn buffet, or even a Station Casino buffet for that matter...but it sure beats a stale hot dog and some Top Ramen!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,JfOHkCxo7kQB2MwD5L6NBg

This buffet offers food that you'd expect from a local casino buffet. Familiar foods, catering toward the elderly slot-playing zombie-like clientele. Sure, with older customers, it's important to remember that their palettes have disintegrated to the point that taste buds can't tell whether they are eating breaded cardboard or a Filet-o-Fish patty... and the food available represented that.  I already walked in with low expectations, but walked out even more disappointed.

The good? Cream puffs at the dessert station
The decent? Apple crepes, pizza, tater tots, champagne
The bad? Everything else. Most of the protein dishes had little to no flavor, while also being as dry as the food I try to create in my kitchen. My cooking skills are comparable to a 4 year old with a Play-Doh imagination kitchen.

Salad was not extensive, but what was there was fresh.  The marinated artichokes are a highlight.

Most of the hot foods appear to be of standard mid-level buffet quality:  Generally edible, but rarely exquisite.  One standout is the Spicy tofu: normally I don't like tofu, because it is so bland. However this added enough flavor to make it taste good.

Also, they have a gelato bar, which turns an otherwise uninspired dessert station into one worth stopping at.  I recommend the blood orange, coconut, chocolate, and pistachio flavors.

I'm not sure which marketing intern came up with the name ""St. Tropez Buffet,"" but the only thing similar that I could find to anything having to do with the French Riviera was the fact that the deli station offers cheese.  However, none of the cheeses appear to be French in any way.  I believe every restaurant should have at least some vague connection to its namesake.  (For example, the Orleans French Market buffet sometimes has crawdads.)

I wanted to try the restaurant as I was hungry. The restaurant needs to remove the sign because they have been overcharging customers all day or the young lady was just trying to over charge us?",5zVvcIkBP-GXCmBsIIY50w,0,0,1,_tapnO3E1wgAiB9mjmbcnQ

Of course, I should be fair and say that for my belly all buffets are pretty much one star, unless they're Indian. As a result of some free coupons that showed up in the mail, however, I have eaten lunch at St. Tropez twice now. By the end of the second trip, my husband and I were joking that we should establish a buffet rating system based on how many things you end up spitting out. Yes, that is juvenile, but we thought it was rather funny, especially after he spit out like the 4th thing. 

Personally, I only spit out one thing: some foul tasting steamed broccoli. I am sorry, but it tasted like poop. I survived my trips to the buffet with the following: noodles from the ""Asian"" section, some cold salads, baked sweet potatoes and some bean tacos (hold the guacamole because it was brown on the first trip), and some pretty good Chinese broccoli. Even the salad bar was a little disappointing because there were no mixed greens. A fabulous salad bar could earn a star upgrade from me. The sweets section is enticing, but the rice crispy treats were stale. How anticlimactic. The bright spot is the staff as they are definitely cheerful and hardworking! It is cheap too I suppose.

Again, if you want a buffet lover's opinion, this is not it, but even with the free coupons, we don't have plans for a third visit. I am not a one star kinda lady, but in the service of honesty, I have to go there.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,8,5,1,fi0f05D5NPaq1bvHvOMePQ

It was 5:00 and we figured at this hour everything would be fresh and hot.  Wrong assumption!  On every section (Chinese, Mongolian hotpot, Italian, BBQ) the food was lukewarm.  The hot & sour soup wasn't even that.  I won't itemize each item I sampled, but I found nothing to be palatable.  Their salad bar doesn't look fresh, has very few items, & appears like Las Vegas in the fifties.  The Chinese section is pitiful, with overcooked veggies, dried up noodles & a poor selection.  The Italian is not your grandma's kitchen... thick, over-cheesed pizza, a mushy lasagna, a very boring pesto over cold bowtie pasta.  The BBQ section was serving up steak, dark turkey meat & one more item.  I tried the turkey, but didn't have a second bite.  There is ONE kind of bread which had garlic on it, was cold & hard from sitting too long.  The Mongolian section I skipped because there were only ""cheap"" choices, like tiny cuts of carrots, bean sprouts, onions, green peppers, & the ""meat"" of chicken, shrimp & pork was in the back so you couldn't see it until they cooked everything.  Desserts?  My partner tried 3 of them & said they were tasteless & the cover-up was too much whipped cream.

I spoke to the manager about the total lack of hot food & she said she'd call the chef who finally emerged to tell me all the burners are on hot, there is no problem whatsoever; that she couldn't believe I found all that food to be lukewarm.  We left in frustration and chose to never return.

The desserts are probably the highlight of the place.  I would not recommend it for lunch, unless you enjoy greasy, deep fried foods.  The stations are broken down by type of cuisine, but it's kind of a disappoint. Nacho station had no cheese or guacamole, but the cheap fare e.g. beans. 

Breakfast had a wide selection of various things other people noted.  Their OJ was not watered down and gross, but actually palatable but they weren't as attentive with refilling the morning I came.  Staff was friendly and helpful, replacing my silverware when I came for breakfast, but not when I was there for lunch.  They allowed us to choose between booth or table, which was nice.

LIKE
- cheese blintz
- country fried steak with gravy
- churro (because there is no wrong time for churros, even though it was on the dry side, still good comparable to the rest of the fare)
- tiny sprinkled donuts (they had the bigger ones too, but oddly, with less sprinkles which is a waste of carbs because the whole point of getting the donut is for its sprinkles!)

PASS
- waffles (not crispy, soggy even though they were in cute heart shapes)
- eggs benedict (cold and flavorless)

Pancakes were basic, syrup was meh (didn't think you could mess up on syrup). They had the usual breakfast fare e.g oatmeal, grits, yogurt, dried fruit (raisins, cranberries, banana chips, etc.) 

You save a couple of bucks with the player's card, so for the 5 minutes it takes to sign up at the window by the front desk, it's worth the extra couple of feet in walking to work up your appetite, lol.

I had a buy one get one free coupon but realized it doesn't start until August 1, but decided to give it a try for a locals $8.88 deal. I brought my mother and 15 year old niece with me. Cashier charges us $8.88 for me and my mom and my niece was charged $13.99 because there is no discount for anyone under 21. So $34 for 3 of us , not bad , or so I thought.
My first impression when I walked up to the small buffet area was oh no this whole buffet looks awful. We tried pizza which was horrible and had a very funny taste that I can't even pinpoint . I also tried pesto pasta and took 2 bites and left that on the plate . Dried almost to the point of been rock hard. The taste was horrible and the oil was just seeping from the pasta. Plate 3, I figured I could have salad. The salad area was very small but was the only fresh food item in the whole buffet. I have romaine lettuce was crisp and I topped with small carrots and onion . The ranch dressing was thin and watery but edible. 
These 3 items are the only ones I tried as everything else looked absolutely disgusting. My mom tried to eat a pork chop but could not because if was so hard you could t even cut it.
My recommendation is to never eat here. Seriously the worst food I have ever saw or sampled . I would never eat here again even if it was free. We almost got up 5 minutes after we ate and left but have decided the salad would hold us over until we ate later.

So why did we go?  It's Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year and, like the other locals' casinos, they had their Jewish Pigout (pun intended) up and running.  That is, gefilte fish, chopped liver, whitefish salad, boiled chicken (I passed - yuk), brisket, potato knishes, potato latkes, matzo ball soup, tsimmes (a sweet potato and carrot concoction), noodle pudding.  Though I'm not a fan of this Eastern European peasant food (even though I grew up with it, including the boiled chicken), my husband is, and he wanted to go.  Who am I to deny him his thrice-per-year Old World extravaganza?

Truth is, the food was suprisingly excellent, despite the dreary surroundings.  So was most everything else I tried, though I didn't try a lot except more veggies.  The desserts were unremarkable, except they've jumped on the gelato bandwagon, so what more does one need?

For 12.99, including free wine and beer, you can't cook this kind of meal for the price.  The wine and beer thing is confusing, though.  We didn't realize until halfway through the meal that it was included, since the sign at the register proclaims that a glass of wine is $3.00.  I still don't understand it.

Dinner here turned out to be a nice surprise.  Next week we'll try the holiday one at Red Rock, and see how it compares.  It's a dollar more, wines aren't included, but the atmosphere is a lot nicer.  We'll see if it measures up.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,0,0,4,lGqJzj7wZ_1tJ55XPTA_sg

We got here at 7PM and a good amount of the food looked like it had seen better days. 

Here is the good bad and the ugly...

The Good:
Knowing well in advance to temper my expectations I went for the high ticket item of the buffet; Prime Rib. The first round the roast looked dismal and looked sun burnt from being under the heat lamp for the past 2 hours. After eating my first slice of prime jerky got up and waited for the carver to pull a new roast out of the heater. At that point pretended to be a shark circling the buffet waiting for him to break into the new roast. It was well worth the wait 3 thin slices of rare prime rib... That right there was worth my gas in my car to drive to Suncoast.  

The salad bar believe it or not was stocked with GREEN lettuce and fresh veggies!

Pizza seemed to be a hot ticket item. Every trip up the the station there was a fresh pie waiting for me. 


The Bad & Ugly:

The guacamole and wasabi both were brown and looked like it had developed a hard candy shell. Although I have a rock gut I decided not to tempt fate and eat my tacos w/o the green stuff. 

The chili cheese fries looked and tasted like they tried to reincarnate last nights baked potatoes by cutting them into wedges and throwing chili on them.. Bleh!

The pasta and and ravioli looked sad and dismal. all the dishes looked like they were set out during the lunch buffet. Not even a dent in any one of them.



The food (some of it) is edible you just have to use your sound judgement and pick wisely. 

In summary people, there is not much room to complain when we are all eating here for free or heavily discounted. So temper your expectations and be thankful for the free prime rib.
