Several times me and my husband came here to eat, the place was almost empty, and we had to wait for 15 minutes or so just to get a menu, and over 20 minutes for the waitress to come back and take our order. On top of that last time they also didn't even take my order - no, they didn't get it wrong, they just plain forgot about me and only made food for my husband. Then apologized and brought the food when he was long done with his meal. And while he was eating, he never got a single drink refill. The food is great and so are the prices, but the service is just too much to deal with for it to be worth it.",kwV24XuUKN5ncelesciW-A,1,0,2,UJ6lQtGIKIHHwSB7mCznEQ

90412,2013-03-11,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"To be blunt, I can't drink soju for the life of me, but it sure goes down better while eating spicy and filling Korean food. Came here for a friend's birthday, and there's no better way to celebrate with noms and great company.

Out of all their banchan, their green beans could easily be eaten with a bowl of rice alone. Not really a fan of their roasted shrimp, but we kept ordering our favorite potato salad instead. 

Order their chicken wings, fried dumplings, and their seafood pancake! No regrets there, promise. Don't be tricked by the casserole; it's really budaejjigae, a spicy soup with some meat, vegetables, and instant noodles all cooked on portable stove at the table. Definitely go for the spicy chicken with mozzarella on top. 

Their flavored sojus are a great mix of the famous Korean alcohol and the Calpico drinks from most Asians' childhoods. Most of my friends don't like alcohol that much, so the sweetness from the peach or lychee flavor really helped them down the soju.

Soyo's sign is hard to see at night, so just remember it's located in the same center as Oyshi. Inside, there are several tables for bigger groups and booths that are closed off from each other. The wait staff is quite attentive, quick, and friendly.

If Soyo is anything similar to drinking joints in Korea, I'm glad we have a piece of that here in Vegas. Makes me excited to try the real thing! Until I make the flight across the Pacific, I'll make the return trip here.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,3,4,DxudtLzR6lwzJyMy1joTAw

The decor of the restaurant is special, with old Korean comic book on the shelf and there's some booth that for people who prefer a little more privacy. Service is great and I like the cold barley tea they served!! Instead of giving you a cup, they give you like a tin bowl, just like how ancient Koreans people drink! 

Food is reasonably priced, cheaper than most Korean restaurants in Chinatown like djk or mothers grill.  My favorite is seafood tofu soup which is only $8:) Their side dishes are great too. I like their Potato salad and chapjae. Our server refilled our side dishes as soon as we got done with ours!! My boyfriend ordered Bibimbap and the stone bowl is hot :) love the rice at the bottom.

First, the atmosphere is great...it's mellow with some kpop playing in the background.  And the drinks are fantastic as well...my favorite, by far, was the yogurt soju cocktails.  They're sweet and super light, but you'll definitely feel the effects fast.  Order the pitcher, it's a great deal.

But the food is the real star.  We started off with seafood dduk boki (spicy seafood with korean ricecake tubes) and it was super fresh and delicious.  Also, the owners were kind enough to send us over a pot of free odeng (fishcakes in a bubbling hot broth) and it was sooo good, especially dipped in the special soy sauced based sauce.  We also ordered the korean chicken wings (sticky, spicy, amazing), the kimchi fried rice (the best I've ever had, next to mom's), the spicy bbq pork (really smokey and a little spicy...super good), the cold noodles, and the bi bim bap.  Everything was incredible and we left stuffed.  Also, the prices are very reasonable, the service was excellent, and did I mention how good the food is??

Soyo is located in the same center as Oyshi Sushi & Haven Animal Hospital. We stopped in on a Sunday evening for some dinner and drinks. We were seated right away in a little booth. They have shelves on the side with what I am thinking either books or dvds. lol. They also have video games  in the front area. Right away we were brought our little tin cups/bowl look things with some tea. As other yelpers, we were a little confused at first. The tea is very yummy and I really love when businesses give you your own pitcher/jug.

For drinks, I order the lychee soju. At first, I thought it was going to be some sort of lychee soju martini and for $12 it better be good! Instead, it was brought in this skinny milk jar looking thing.. definitely more than enough for one person probably even better to share. It was most definitely delicious but not as strong as I'd expect.. especially soju. It reminded me more of a lychee sake.. They make it in-house which is awesome in itself. 

To eat, I got the beef soondubujigae. It came out bubbling and topped with a raw egg. It was tasty but it could've been spicier.. it also had a much stronger garlic taste than I am used to. I love garlic so bring it on but I prefer more flavor from the dashi (soup broth) than it being overwhelmed with garlic. The bf got the kalbi ribs which were flavorful but had a bit too much fat. I loved all the ban-chans which consisted of daikon kimchee, napa cabbage kimchee, marinated beef, and bean sprouts. 

Service was up to par and the servers were very knowledgeable with their menu/drinks. They came by to check up on us periodically. 

I really enjoyed our visit here and I plan to be back. I loved their homemade soju as well as the atmosphere. w00t w00t.",DGDlpOVeUNEkBDYkJLvdBQ,2,1,4,Rwukw35tWsl6llcGydEo7Q

218418,2014-08-19,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I LOVE Soyo and would normally give it 5 stars without a doubt, but my last visit was simply disappointing. 

I came with 3 other people and we all ordered at the same time. We ordered the bossam (steamed pork with cabbage and radish kimchi), tondak (fried cornish hen), two kalbi tangs (beef shortrib soup) and a yukejang (spicy beef soup). They brought out the banchan and the water quickly, but we were waiting for our food for FOREVER. We were waiting at LEAST 25 minutes when they usually take about 10. I ordered the bossam, and it was the only dish that didn't come with the rest of the orders. They assured me that it was on the way and that the kitchen was backed up, which was understandable. I waited at least 20 more minutes before the dish was finally served to us. By then, the rest of my party had finished their soup and I just ate some of their food since I was starving, so by the time the dish came, I just took it to go since I didn't want the rest of my party to awkwardly sit there waiting for me to eat. Also, the yukejang was missing beef when it is basically the most important part of the dish. How the heck did that happen?!  They also messed up our check by switching it with another table's check somehow, AND they misplaced our ticket, so they weren't sure how much change to give us. Super disorganized and the waitresses definitely lacked communication.

Noise level in Soyo is pretty high, being that there is k-pop blaring in your ears nonstop. Soyo seems to be for the ""young"" and ""hip"" crowd, being that there was no one over the age of 25 in there. You first receive some tiny tin bowls to drink their bori-cha (barley tea). It keeps the bori-cha cold and on a hot Vegas night, this is good. 

I have to admit, the dolsot-bibimbap here is spot on. The pot was hot, there were a variety of toppings, and it was good. I tried the sullung-tang on a seperate occasion, and it was decent. The seafood casserole was also flavorful. However, the banchan was a bit flat.

Called ahead to ask about late dinner and was pleased to find out that there was no need to rush; they're open till 3am for your nocturnal K-style cravings. It's a pleasant suprise to find an after hours eatery that's not smack dab on the strip or deep in the heart of Chinatown. A request for an outside table was fulfilled with a smile and the chilled barley tea was a delight on a mid summer night but there was no invitation to order any other drinks or even water from the waiter who also managed to short us one menu. Disappointment popped up again at the discovery of our waiter taking the meal orders from another party he sat two tables after us! A diner from our table walked back in to inform someone that we were ready to order. The waiter arrived to take the order shortly after. Then a member of management asked us if we would prefer a table inside because the outside dining area was going to become a smoking area shortly after our food would arrive. Redemption! Courtesy bonus stars to Soyo's management. The invitation to an inside table was accepted and greatly appreciated. A bowl of milky oxtail broth with slices of beef in noodles, a side of fresh scallions and a saucer of kosher salt arrived. Delicious, and the kosher salt was a nice functional touch. The traditional Korean side dishes soon arrived as did an order of spicy tofu/seafood soup. The crispy flat dumplings sprinkled with paprika and the chicken wings with garlic sauce were also a big hit at our table. The taste and presentation of the food was so delightful that the lack of attention paid to our empty water glasses was a mere detail amongst a plethera of flavor. A brown rice option would  have been an added bonus and something that hopefully will be considered at Soyo in the future. A responsive and courteous manager elevated this foodieview from ""Meh.

The food is unbelievable. Spicy - flavorful - colorful - amazing. I ordered the Kim Chee soup last night, absolutely great. We shared the Spicy Chicken with Mozzarella - extremely spicy, but great all the same. (and we love spicy food) We ordered a pork dish with sliced onions and peppers - another dish that comes in aluminum foil that has octopus and roasted whole garlic cloves. The garlic was so tender and sweet, not over powering at all. Our favorite is the pork with tofu - so amazing and I am drooling now just thinking about it. We did order a few more items, but I cannot remember now - maybe a post later to refresh my memory... 

When you sit, you are provided with an iced Barley Tea automatically - a great little treat. The service is good. I almost love the utensils as much as the food. The Iced Tea is served with thin metal bowls to drink out of. The chopsticks are metal and the soup spoon is awesome too. The dishes are served in heavy ceramic containers and the rice in a heavy metal bowl.

612854,2015-03-18,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"It seems every Korean restaurant I go to in Las Vegas, improves on the previous one. Soyo is no exception.

Firstly, the atmosphere is really nice. Christmas lights hanging from the ceiling, cool blackboards, really nice dinnerware, cool booths that are hidden into the wall, and lots of Hangul (Korean) writing everywhere. They even have a neat little feature, where they have lots of Korean manga and books on shelves. 

Okay, now to the food. I've really only tried one entree, the Dolsot Bibimbap. But it is excelltn. The toppings are all there, the fried egg is great, and I love the sauce they have. Very par for the course for the Bibimbaps that I've had. Yet, the price is great on this one. It's only $10 as of this review and it's perfect. Even if they raised the price, I wouldn't mind. 

Next, the side dishes. These are my favorite part of Korean restaurants. I was well happy with these. They give you 5, and all range from spicy, to savory, to refreshing. They also ask you if youy want refills a lot, so that is always a plus!

Lastly, one of my favorite things is that they give you a free bottle of tea as you walk in. It's barley tea, but that is my favorite so it could not be better! Also, not sure if it was just that day or for lunch or whatever, but on my visit for lunch they gave me a free bowl of this Korean egg drop soup, with tofu, that the chef specially made

So we get:
-1 bottle of barley tea
-5 side dishes with free refills
-Large Dolsot Bibimbap
-Bowl of soup

The order was taken relatively quick however the food took awhile to arrive and flagging down the waiter was rather difficult in order to get drink refills or the check. So overall service went down hill. 

As to the food, I had the bibimbap, which was good although I have had better (Island Style for one). Also, ordered the dumplings again good but not noteworthy. So the food was solid but not phenomenal. I prefer it when the banchan is brought at the beginning too. I can't remember what other places have done or what is traditional but that is just my preference. Here, the banchan was brought along with the main entrees. 

In regards to the ambience. I believe other yelpers have stated it is very K-pop here and I agree. I could see it being a lively venue for a weekend night. Music was loud, and for lunch, it was almost to loud to visit and enjoy especially since it wasn't too crowded. The decor is industrial but appealing, however, we sat on the benches with no back. Would have prefered a back to the seat, especially in light of the somewhat slow service. 

Overall, glad that I put aside my ill feelings before and gave it a chance. The food was solid but it is unlikely I will be back as it was not noteworthy and there are so many other places to try.

On one last note (which would be added above excempt my computer is having issues right now). The selection was more extensive than other Korean places I have been and they had a few decent beers, although I didn't imbibe. They had either Hitachino or Morimoto Soba ale, I think it was the latter, either way they are both great beers that are difficult to find in restaurants.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,JJZk5llNimMV_HsuS_mz1w

When we first walked in the hubby & I didn't know what to make of the place because it was blaring club music. To make the situation more confusing was the interior decor, it was very nostalgic. But the hubby appreciated it as he noticed the old TV in a wooden box that took him back when he was a kid, so I get it.

I appreciated that we were seated and served our drinks right a way, but the service from there went down hill (Thus I'm giving this place a 3) I'm big on service so even if a restaurant has less than quality food but have exceptional service encourages me to want to come back. 

For me the menu was a little confusing and felt that it could be more descriptive or perhaps our server could have go over it with us or suggest some items. Anyway, here is what we ordered:

* Kimchi Jjigae (w/pork) $8- This was very good. But I don't know if they were being skimpy on the meat because it was chopped up very small I hardly notice the meat in it. 
* Galbi $12-  This was very delicious. The meat was thick and juicy =P
* Potato pancakes $9- I never tried this before so I didn't know what to expect. It was the last thing to come out as the server explained that it takes a little more time because they have to smash the potato's. With that in mind I thought it should be good then cause they make it from scratch. I was totally wrong. Right when it was set on the table I was already disappointed as you can see the 4 pancake size potato's was very oily. It came with some dipping sauce that was just soy sauce mixed with sriracha and was the only thing that gave it any flavor. 

I think Soyo is more a great place to go with friends, hangout and drink, rather a place to go have a lovely nice dinner with a love one.",v0LsUNLSO2No_yXu3w2w4A,0,0,3,6cLGzJZ5tAx2KdoUBU8p4Q

I really liked the beef bulgogi which was flavored just right. The sauce wasn't too thick, greasy, or loaded with sesame oil.

The bibimbap was solid, but not the best menu item

My friend ordered the sulletang, and he liked it. My yuk gae jang was pretty great. There was egg, shredded beef, some weird string thing, a thin rice noodles. The soup I had in Korea had more beef in it, but the soup broth was nice and spicy and tasted pretty good. I really enjoyed it. The other dishes we ordered were a fried chicken and omurice.

The menu offers smaller portioned dishes somewhat reminiscent of tapas joints. It's a good way to tip-toe into Korean food for the uninitiated but offers very little to those who may be looking for a more authentic restaurant. The prices are fair and the food is hit or miss.

My korean friends took me to this place.  This is a little different than the traditional korean restaurant which is very ""smelly"" or ""BBQy"" (in the good way).   It's very modern and clean.  The menu is very ""tapa"" style too.

We ordered rice cake with vegitables with ""ramen"" noodle in spicy sauce which I haven't eaten in 10 years.  I was so happy they make this dish.  I gotta find one in Honolulu (usual korean dish is rice cake with vegi only).  We also ordered some grilled rice cake skewers and cream corn with cheese for appitizers.  They are all very good.

Half the dish were strips of steak and the other a salad. The steak was so juicy and flavorful and the salad was dressed with sesame oil I believe. My favorite dish there, with a good portion size. Update: It's on the permanent menu now 3/17

Spicy seafood Tofu Soup: $8 (4.5/5) Came with a raw egg to crack into the soup while it was boiling hot. It was a typical Korean tofu soup, it came with octopus and a mussel? Needed more seafood in it though. Enough for 4 people. 

Seafood pancake: (2/5) It was slightly burnt and soggy. Limited seafood included octopus and shrimp. Wouldn't recommend. 

Blood Sausage and Vegetables: $22? (3/5) We saw another table that had it so we thought we'd give it a try. It wasn't bad just blood sausage had a bizarre texture; chewy and soft. Super big portion.",57rdPhLMle0z9qXpK8C4Mw,0,1,5,4hjIT4-HF7-g3ewCHyCHcA

Being around for 8 months, I thought I give this place a try.  I had no clue what this place was all about.  After eating at Soyo for the first time, I felt that this place was jaw dropping.

We were greeted by a Korean guy that was able to speak English.  I've been to a few Korean restaurants in the valley but none of them had someone who was fluent in English.  So I was thrilled to find someone who can communicate effectively with us.  We didn't know what to order, the guy recommended us two dish.  

Marinated Beef with Garlic and finely cut green onions  $14

This is an appetizer.  The marinated beef tasted great.  Finely chopped onions had some kind of sesame flavor in it.  A sweet sauce plus a side of jalepeno.  The combination of meat, veggies, and the Kimchi that came on the side was mouth watering.

Cold Noodle, kimchi, cucumber $7

Noodle was extremely elastic.  I mean, I wanted to ask them for scissors to cut up the noodle.  Haha.  I THINK the noodle is bean noodle, but I might be wrong.  But we tried eating it anyways because it was too good for us to wait for the scissors.  I can't even tell what kind flavor I was eating, but it was good.  

1 star for service- came and ask us how the food was twice, gave us more water without us asking, excellent service
1 star atmosphere - they got Korean manga on the book self and a bunch of unique collectibles on display which gives the place a unique atmosphere which most places fail to show. This place is clean.
3 stars for the food -  everything was somewhat spicy, but spicy enough to keep you going, but not to the point where I am dying for a water.     The side dishes were great too. Bean sprouts, long beans, kimchi, coleslaw, everything was great.

Conclusion:  I give this place 5 stars, I don't really know what's REAL Korean food, but what I ate at Soyo already made me feel that I had one of the best korean meals ever.

847882,2016-05-28,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"My husband had a craving for bulgogi, so we went on the hunt for a place where he could get his fix.  After a quick search on yelp, he came up with Soyo and based upon the pics and reviews, we were in for a real treat.  We didn't have too much trouble finding the place (although their outside covered seating does obstruct the view of their signage-they should probably fix that), so that was nice, and while the parking lot was a bit full, we were able to find a parking spot.  

It was about 6pm this last Friday, so we didn't expect it to be dead, but we also didn't expect too big of a crowd just yet.  When we walked in, we really liked the small, intimate setting and thought that the decor was neat.  Little details such as Korean video game machines and cute soju posters made the place unique.  We were greeted by a hostess and asked how many were in our party.  Another couple was right behind us and their host did the same, but already had menus in hand and directed them to their table immediately.  

Our hostess went over to a table to grab some menus and other items, then walked off towards a booth without another word.  At this point we were unsure if we should follow her or not as she had not mentioned anything.  I decided to follow, so my husband and daughter did the same.  As I approached her I asked if this was our table and she giggled, ""sorry, I wanted to get the table ready for you first"" and then quickly walked off without explaining anything, offering drinks, stating that a server would be with us in just a moment...nothing.

We slid into our booth and took a look at a jug filled with ice and a brownish substance as well as some small tin dishes that looked like mini dog bowls.  The jug read ""Hite"", which we knew to be Korean beer, but we didn't think it was beer since there was ice in it.  We weren't sure if we should just start drinking it or wait to see what was going on with this possibly iced beer substance.  I thought it looked like tea, so my husband tried a small bit in his dog dish.  He confirmed that it was tea and so I tried some as well.  It was a bit earthier than some other teas that I had tried, but it was very mild and familiar - I liked it.  The tin dish retained the coolness very well making the drink ice cold, which was pleasant.

We took a look at the menu, which we found to be a little confusing, and located the bulgogi my husband had come here for.  After about another 10 minutes, and us thinking that we had been forgotten in our booth next to the bathroom, a server came over and asked if we were ready to order.  We asked him about the tea, which he said was barley tea (so, that's what that familiar taste was!).  We ordered some items and he seemed unsure, while offering no input as to portion sizes.  We asked him if there was anything he thought we needed to try on the menu and he responded with ""I'm not sure, it's all the same as other places I think.  I'm not Korean.""  I chuckled and explained that neither were we.  I went on to ask if there was anything on the menu that he had tried and liked.  He continued to explain that we wasn't sure, so we moved on and placed our order of Bulgogi, Sweet and Spicy Pork, Japchae, and   Nabjak Mandu.  He thanked us and walked away.

At this point my husband and I started to discuss the decor and the confusion with the tea and menu.  We were really hoping that the food would not be a let down because we really liked this small place with the simple, yet unique decor.  We drank more of the tea out of our dishes and waited for our sides and other dishes to come.

The pork came first along with the various kimchi items (black beans, bean sprouts, cabbage, etc.), rice, and mandu.  About 5 minutes later we got our Japchae.  When we were just about done with the pork and mandu, another server came over and asked if we had the bulgogi.  We explained that we had ordered it, but had not yet received it.  My husband was going to tell them to just forget about it, but heck...this is what we came here for!  He was getting his bulgogi and so I told them to bring it out.  After about another 5-10 min the bulgogi came out sizzling on it's dish.  We were excited, but contained ourselves and let it cool down a bit before digging in.

The pork was delicious and tender, although my husband thought it had a bit too much sauce on it reminding him of Chinese food.  The mandu was good, but a bit on the bland side and the Japchae was as expected, but nothing spectacular. I liked the bulgogi, but there were some really tough parts and nothing really set it apart from other bulgogis we had experienced here in Vegas.  We settled for a box and the check.

Based upon the food, service, and pricing...we probably won't be going back.  It was fun as a dinner night out with the family and I think we got a lot of comedy out of the experience, but we've had better.

Being a relative newcomer, I let Dennis choose our food and crossed my fingers. Also, my toes. One can never be too careful. 

What arrived was an array of meats, vegetables, and even seaweed cooked just right and given great flavor. How great you might ask? I ate radishes. Willingly. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, until you stop and realize something....they were RADISHES. Yet Soyo made them good, and made them stand out even among the stuffed dumplings, bbq'd beef, kim chee and other tasty items. Except for the sea weed. 

Even Superman had limits to his powers.

That said, Soyo was great all the way around in the food department. The staff were polite and helpful, the draft beer was drafty (imagine that), and the whole experience was a very good one.

One other thing needs mentioning, though. the decor is going to be off putting to some. By some, I mean really really Americanized people. While it is classy, clean and unique, it also features a copious amount of Korean writing all over the restaurant and the menu itself. Those who are not a bit adventurous could be a bit overwhelmed or intimidated, of even, overtimidated (inwhelmed?). 

My advice to those of you who think you might fall into that group? Take a chance anyway. The food is great and well worth it.",yXuvxLICKpUCrM7cg4E2Bw,2,1,4,qpKBjGTni9QYFo00e5vohA

The chicken wings were delicious. I liked the crunch to the skin and the taste of the sauce, which had the perfect hint of spice. It was spicy, but not too hot that it disarms your taste buds.  I was surprised I didn't have to use the pickled dikon to cool my mouth. (I tried it anyway and thought it was pretty good).

Also ordered the kimchi fried rice. It cane out with an over-hard egg on top. This dish was pretty tasty. However, I was a little disappointed it didn't have more of a kimchi flavor.

The pork cutlet with cheese on top (sorry, but I can't remember the name) was also very tasty and the favorite among all at the table. I enjoyed the crunchy thin layer of breading around the outside and the cheese and the light sauce. Everything in that dish worked well together.

Last but not least, the soju. We tried the lemon soju which tasted like lemonade. Very dangerous. Haha. We also ordered the raspberry one, which turned out to be a raspberry wine.

for people coming from out of town and living on the strip beware of the taxi cost to get here. We went from our hotel, Wynn, to the restaurant with a taxi and round trip was $60, more expensive than the food. 

The food: if you came from an area that has good Korean food then this place is nothing special. The food is good and certainly has its own style but by far not the best, certainly not worth the $60 cab ride. 

The drinks are cool and somewhat creative but nothing you would not find in New York or LA. If you ever been to Korea...then this place is just very so-so.

Overall a good restaurant if you have transportation but if you are from New York, Boston, LA, or other major US metropolitan area then is not really worth the trip.",BEd65qN4hhgZHNe5qc8ryw,1,0,3,OrEMU_lAeU6sxinPtI8nwg

The food is not like Western styled Korean food, they are actually very authentic. Soyo has many street food and traditional food that a Korean family would cook everyday. I also love the fact that they open till 4:00 am. I always stay up late and I can go there when I get hungry at night. 
The food here is amazing. Everything we got was flavorful and they have delicious spicy food, but not too spicy to eat. They have the best Korean food in Las Vegas that I have tried so far. I had seafood pancake, Korean fried chicken, and the bossam. My all time favorite is the bossam. The ssamjang, garlic, kimchi, and mini shrimps really complimented the pork well without overpowering the pork. The quality of kimchi is vital for Korean food and they make great kimchi that is fresh, flavorful but not too salty, goes great with the meat. 
The seafood pancake was super soft with a little crunch on the edge. I could taste the seafood they use was very fresh. It was kind of creamy, very moist and mushy when bite into it, the taste of the seafood is strong. Highly recommend but may not suit for people who does not like the taste of oyster or octopus.
The fried chicken was amazing. It comes with some white pickles, which goes great with the chicken and helped my appetite a lot. When we eat fried chicken, it could be too greasy sometimes, but they make it differently and makes the chicken flavorful with their special sauce, so it won't be too plain also not too salty. The chicken is crispy even with the sauce on the outside. You can taste some subtle garlic flavor underneath its tangy, sweet crunch. 
However, the service here is slow sometimes. The waiter doesn't really check on guests often and they are always so busy, I waited for a while to have someone passing by to have the check. The food is amazing, I have been to Soyo many times and tried most dishes on the menu, I loved every one of them.

What I can only assume is the manager came out and told me ""it's the same"".   This knuckle head is trying to convince me that BBQ and soup is the same?

Then another time, I ordered short ribs.   I had to argue with the staff that I was given only bones.  I know Korean short ribs and they had bones on my plate.   If I want more meat per bone ratio, staff actually told me that I had to place another order.  Not acceptable.   They came out with the proper portion after I cancelled my order.  

The few time I am there, I am greeted by untrained wait staff.   They do not greet and seat you immediately.   They do not bus tables.  They take your order and pretty much forget about you.   I feel the staff hides in the kitchen.   

They do make a good spicy Glass Noodle dish.   

Music it too loud.   There were curse words in some of their lyrics they were oblivious to when young children were there.

We had the stone pot of bulgogi ($12), the spicy pork rib ($13), Fire Chicken ($10) and potato pancake ($9). All were fine, but the spicy pork rib really shined.

My wife and I had great food, unfortunately I can't give 5 stars based only on the food. The service was terrible. I have never been so upset from poor service and I felt like more people should be prepared for this.

We barely saw our server and as the place started filling up, we noticed them seating people outside who probably would have preferred indoors (late December). We had chosen a booth which was big enough for at least 4 people, because the place was less than half full when we got there. Needless to say we felt bad for the people waiting. We were ready to go but had to wait, while people waiting to be seated looked confused and upset. I'm not saying anyone should rush to give up their seat, but we waited over 15 minutes for the check. Eventually my wife asked a different server for the check which arrived soon after, however, it sat on the table for at least another 5 minutes until I walked it over to their register and paid it.

We ordered Korean bbq short ribs as well as an omelet rice and spicy chicken to start. Our short ribs came out first and we noticed they were entirely fat. Now some fat is normal but not when only a couple pieces from our order were meat. We told our server if they could replace them and he said oh, too much fat? And took the plate back with him. About 3 minutes later Sara came back out with the same plate. She said that because we already ate half that they could not replace it. But we could place another order. No apology...nothing. She then had the nerve to ask, ""Do you want to keep it?"" To which our reply was, ""We are paying for it, aren't we?""

First of all, I counted the bones after she brought the plate back and we had eaten only 3 pieces. Now if they really had any interest in delivering good service to keep customers coming back they could have said, ""I apologize but because you ate some of the dish already we can replace the half that is still on the plate and, if you wish, place another order which I will ensure is not all fat."" Which I would have been fine with (even though we did not eat half) and I feel this would have been a reasonable way to resolve the issue. Instead Sara and Soyo decided to save $15 and give up at least the $30 more that we were planning on ordering today. Not to mention, we won't be back.

At first the service was very attentive and then died down towards the end of the night to the point we had to keep flagging someone down when we needed something. 

We started with the lychee soju and marbled beef with garlic and chives. This dish was great because the beef was a little on the fattier side and the salad had my favorite Korean dressing on it. 

The Kalbi Jjim came out next and there were probably about 6 big pieces in it. The meat was very tender and fell off the bone. The sauce was not overly sweet like most Kalbi Jjim I've had. Just talking about it is making me crave this dish again. 

We then tried the yogurt soju and the spicy chicken wings came out. The wings were heavily sauced and not spicy at all. Very sweet. 

We the ordered the peach soju which was probably my least favorite if the three flavors but still refreshing with the perfect amount of sweetness. 

They have this wheel that you can spin in the from and is supposed to be for people that spend a minimum of $20 per person after 10 pm. We noticed this when we were about to walk out the door and had to ask someone if we could have a spin. It ended up landing on ""free appetizer"" and the man said we had to order it right then and there. Pretty weird especially because we already paid and were on our way out the door. They've got to figure out a better way to do this. We just opted to forget about ordering the free item since it was time to leave. 

This is a great spot to go to for soju and appetizers. Especially because most Korean restaurants I've been to require cooking your own food. It's enjoyable to relax and leave the cooking to the pros.",jOW3BGthCDL3l7Dd6AWZtA,0,0,4,SZPPjvIbaJLZWweePngosQ

When you walk in, there are Korean arcade games on the right of the entrance, and tables and booths for your to sit in on the left. You may be greeted in Korean by the wait staff, and they've been more than accommodating and attentive. Usually they're playing the latest Kpop, so if you're into that, Soyo is a great place for that Korean experience.

Every time I'm here I'm with a large group of friends, so I've tried many of there standard dishes including the yang nyam chicken (sauce-covered fried chicken), jjigae (stew) which come in tofu, seafood, or beef varieties. The food is usually a bit salty, but that's how Korean food normally is, so if you're watching your sodium intake, you may want to go easy on the dishes here. The meat is always flavorful and easy to chew. I'm not very discerning when it comes to Korean food, but the food is comparable to the LA Koreatown fare. Their tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) is a staple at Korean bar/restaurants, so be sure to order that for the crew.

Overall Soyo is very clean and organized. The staff periodically checks on the tables to see if you need anything. The food is delicious and there's rarely a wait.

We were given cute water cups, and I had to take my time deciphering the menu, as many of the menu choices had looked the same to me. I had settled with a menu item that was taped in the front, which was either a new addition or a special. The bulgolgi that came with it was what sold me.
The sides had been served first, as expected of most Korean restaurants, and then my dish, along with my friend's had come at the same time. My dish had come lukewarm, but I had disregarded that fact because I was very hungry and could not wait any longer to eat. The dish was nice, and I had enjoyed the egg noodles and the bulgolgi very much, along with the macaroni salad, kimchi, and rice. I had enjoyed it so much, after I had gotten full I had asked for a to-go box, which is something I rarely ask for.
I would've given this place five stars but...

Almost two days later, I had come down with diarrhea, followed immediately by a high fever. I suspected that it was food poisoning, and I had later went to the doctor, who had confirmed that I had salmonella. I had wondered what restaurant had given me food that would contain it, but I didn't have to dig deep.

1165957,2014-08-12,4,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"First off, if you're not Korean or know anyone that works there then good luck on getting decent service. 

The waitress we had is obviously new, I know this because I come here a lot to know, also because her lack of knowledge of the food & drinks. 

She described the new soju as a lemon soju. I think it was called soyo soju something like that. It was either straight up soju with a lemon inside or soju & water with a lemon inside. Definitely not a lemon flavored soju. Big difference. 

She also didn't know what crab came in the seafood mixture. It's blue crab. Or a crappy version of a blue crab. Couldn't get meat at all because it was so small. It's really there for show, ha.

Our waitress didn't even know what food was what either. If I would say ""No. 39"" she would ask ""What's that?"" then as I describe what's in it, she would look at me like she didn't know what I was talking about. I'm obviously not Korean so I can't pronounce the name. Just write down the number & look at the menu in the back.

We were attended by the veteran waitress more than our own. I don't know her name, but she's the reason why they received 2 stars & not one.

But every single time I go there they lack in refilling drinks & service.

Also, we spent $180? Something like that, for 4 people, just so we could spin the wheel. 

My friend went up to spin the wheel & supposedly it landed on ""nothing"". Excuse me, why is that even an option? & why isn't it in english? They could be ripping you off & you wouldn't even know it. If we're spending that much money there that shouldn't be an option.

As for the food, normally I leave happy or at least satisfied..but the last time just wasn't satisfying at all. & we ordered a lot of food.

This review is mostly on service. I make a big deal about the refill on the drinks because their food is spicy, but good & to always have to flag our server down for a refill is complete utter bull shit.

But me & my friends get bad service all the time. I've noticed that if you're not Korean or friends with someone there, you're not getting service. 

Actually the one time I received good service was when a server named Iris was working. 

I hope that gets better because I wouldn't mind coming back.

...Just not with the server we had last time.

By the way, it wasn't busy. There were 2 parties inside & one on the patio. So dinner rush was obviously not the reason for the lack of service.",c7fb0XUAQvd7DJJ6ok5spQ,3,2,2,L1-zlrmrCeem8KGHDzH4Gg

We tried to eat at this place awhile back, but was never acknowledged and seated, but I didn't think it was fair to write a review so I held off on it 'till I can actually try the place out and write a proper review, and I didn't think a few sentences for a review would cut it here on Yelp.

I thought the food was OK, but the service was terrible. We were greeted and seated immediately since the place didn't look very busy. It took awhile for one of the servers to notice us. Our server didn't look at all in the mood to serve us. When we ordered our drinks we asked him for a couple minutes to look over the menu; keyword: ""a couple of minutes"". After 15-20 mins we looked around for our server, but he was no where to be found. The place wasn't that busy. We tried to get his attention and walked past us a few times and kept chit chatting with the same table, which I can only assume are his friends since he seems to be laughing it up and being more attentive to them.

He finally came around to taking our order. I don't remember the name of the dish that I ordered, but it was white rice with ground beef, and a mixture of vegetables with an egg on top. It came out sizzling in a charcoal colored bowl. It was good, but I ended up unintentionally scraping the burnt ingredients off the bottom of the bowl, which made some of the bites hard to swallow.

Our server never came around to checking on us after our food was delivered. We ended up waving another server that ended up taking over our table.

In short, food was OK, service was bad.",2u06pfLxzD0mqhnhJNlFhA,1,0,2,CIDN2OB7CAs5OYpPeTfCZA

1230992,2011-05-18,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"If you have never had Korean food, now is your time to try.  Soyo is the perfect place to try that one food with a bad reputation, Kimchi, and learn to love it.  It's also your opportunity to see somewhat familiar foods transformed into delicious, other-worldly dishes.

Everything I learned about Korean food, I learned from a single episode of ""Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.""  Needless to say, the only thing I retained were the facts about Kimchi and cold, buckwheat Soba noodles.  I learned far more from my single experience at Soyo.

Soyo is owned by the same people who own our ridiculously busy, yet favorite, nearby sushi restaurant, Oyshi.  One look at the long line outside of Oyshi and the idea of trying Korean food for the first time seemed more appealing.  The friend we met had tried Korean food once before and enjoyed it, but warned us about kimchi, described as an ""acquired taste.""

I'm happy to say that my taste was immediately acquired.

I couldn't tell you the name of a single item we ordered, since everything was written in Korean with an English accompaniment describing the items in the dish.  Short Rib stew, buckwheat kimchi noodles, pork belly and squid with soy beans and spicy red sauce (still cooking on an open flame when brought to our table) and about 8 condiments/side dishes that I couldn't name or describe the contents of.  Lucky for us, everything was absolutely delicious.  If you like spicy food, come here.  If you like big, bold flavors and tenderly cooked pork and beef, come here.  If you want to try something new, come here.  5 star food and 4 star service.

Unfortunately, I have a couple of minor complaints... First of all, our friend asked for a glass of water, but we were informed by our waitress that they don't serve water and instead serve cold barley tea.  5 minutes later, I saw someone being served water.  Second, the service was inconsistent, no one really checked on us, but it could be because they were unprepared for the amount of business coming in at 8pm on a Friday night?  Third, the squid that came with our spicy red sauce dish was perfectly cooked for the first 5 minutes of dinner, but thanks to the constant heat, quickly became chewy and difficult to eat.  I would recommend getting any dish with squid without the burner.

Complaints aside, we had a fantastic meal and will be returning very soon. Go to Soyo!",F4bgNA3DctjQK8vVrvPNlQ,1,1,4,O-fhB0JED_3oY3PspgLOXw
1232336,2016-04-02,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Went on a Wednesday evening about 5pm.  4 other parties in the place.  The restaurant has 4 or 5 semi private booths, 5 or 6 bench-type seating and an outdoor patio seating.  The menu is a la carte with more of a Korean fusion type of dishes.  A small pitcher of iced barley water was provided.  I ordered the Spicy tofu soup and my husband ordered the Kalbi and we ordered the Mandoo for appetizer. The food arrived quite quickly.  The Mandoo are not the traditional ones I am used to. These were flat, filled with very little filling, and barely cooked.  Don't expect a crispy Mandoo.  Just a quick pan fry on it was all.  Out came the small dishes of radish kimchi, bland cabbage kimchi, soggy pickled cucumber, and the soy jelly type cubes.  My Spicy tofu soup arrived boiling in its pot.  It was very good. My husbands Kalbi arrived just barely warm to the touch.  It was not grilled thoroughly because it was chewy and rare.  The best part of eating Kalbi is chewing off the meat and gristle from the bones but it wasn't at this place.  While you dine, the atmosphere is like eating in a Korean hip hop club.  Rap music is blasting; rapping about ""hitting it from behind"" and ""N-word"" this and ""N-word"" that.  I look around and there is a family with two children under the age of 10.  I listen to hip hop music and I understand a club vibe on the weekend but it's in the middle of the week between 5-6pm.  I give one star only because the soup.

Beef Soondabu (4 stars): I think out of all the places I have tried in Las Vegas this place probably has the best Soondabu. Comes with an egg and a bowl of white rice. Lots of soft tofu and great flavor broth.

potato pancake: (4 stars) very chewy not crispy but has good flavor. Comes with a chili soy dipping sauce which is very good to have with the pancake. 

Dokbokki: (5 stars) comes with fishcake, cylindrical noodles and spicy sauce. Very good dish. I absolutely love this korean bar food dish and have to have it every time.

I actually told my real estate agent that I wanted to live on this side of Vegas because I NEEDED to be surrounded by great eats. I made a wonderful executive decision, YAY ME! OK so anyways I have been to Soyo twice, once late a night and another during the day. Two different vibes but still good vibes and you know I am all about the vibes!

On my last visit here, I brought my visiting daughter and her boyfriend. She has been living in Orlando for the last five months and had been complaining about not having decent Asian food, so I suggested we go to Soyo since it was in my hood. We ordered a lot off the menu, enough food to bring home. On the table were the Garlic Chicken Wings, Tofu Soup, Bulgogi, Spam and Eggs, rice and all the little sides included. It was a little feast!

I do recommend the tofu soup with the added egg, that you crack open and add into the bubbling red soup. The favorites with the adult kiddos were the Garlic Chicken Wings and Bulgogi. I do prefer Bulgogi when it comes off a hot grill at a Korean BBQ but this was pretty good. I just think my daughter was desperate for something other than Panda Express, which she hates. My daughter's boyfriend has never had any other Asian food passed Panda or Chinese buffets so he left a changed man. He was a good sport and tried all the little sides and had Spam for the first time, which he did like when he ate it with rice. We did have him try the Tofu Soup before we slipped the egg in because he doesn't eat eggs, cheese or other normal foods because he doesn't like the texture. He did enjoy the Tofu Soup and had not realized tofu could be cooked in different ways. They were a fan!

There are so many other dishes on their extensive menu that I want to try and with Soyo being on my side of town, I have a another place added to my ""Good Eats List"".",quDu_Z0-i9TCYvdHRnULEw,11,10,4,1xkFguA5hHmjJIK0m1sc5A

I knew of a couple Korean places in the area, but this place came in at the top of the review filter.  I had wanted to stop by here in the evening and check out the bar portion of ""barstaurant"".  That will still happen, I'm sure.

Great menu.  Nice selection of options, except for my colleague, who prefers chicken over beef.  No chicken on this menu!  I'm fine with that.

The roasted barley water, was a nice refreshing palate cleanser.  The side dishes were wonderful.  I personally like my kimchi much spicier, but it was  good balance for those less masochistic eaters.  The bibimbap was awesome!  Lots of fresh veggies, and wonderfully tender marinated beef!  I was only slightly disappointed with the fried egg over medium.  I wonder if they would crack it raw into the pot, or do sunny side up.  I will definitely ask next time.  Cooking the yolk into my hot rice is my favorite part of the dish!

I was a little surprised that there was only one other table occupied at lunch.  No complaints.  Was a very relaxing little lunch getaway.  The waitress was super friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is hip and the little touches like small tin bowls for your drink, and a trash canister on the table, set it apart just enough to make it a memorable experience.

If you go to any other restaurant, if the chef has a heavy hand on the salt, they re-make the dish so you're able to enjoy it. If the food is overcooked, they make it properly... But apparently, at this restaurant, the only way they will accept re-making the food or take it off of the check is ONLY if you get a piece of hair, or any human particles in it..",qA_MpzwfOal2rGvWl6ZyDQ,4,0,1,wiDk48zjEE6FR-y5M51plw

I gave this place another chance again. Fool me once...well I got fooled twice so shame on me.

Came again with a smaller group this time. 

Over a year and a half ago I came with a large group of Yelpers and the food sucked. I had a cold tomato based buckwheat noodle dish that I hope was even actually veg. We sat out in the patio and the service was slow and really sucked. I can't remember how many of us there were last time but I'm thinking around 10 Yelpers after the Terry Fador show. The tomato based cold noodle dish reminded me of what ChefBoyRdee? noodle O's in sauce smelled and taste like 25+ years ago. Only cold. So just stay home, find a can of that and have at it! 

This time there were only five of us and same type of slow sucky service. It was almost like the server went out of their way to avoid us. Just as I experienced before. 

The food here for me is yuck. I have to have them make plain noodle dishes with vegetables because most of their items are premade with fish stock and the fish or meat stock are in a lot of the sides and accompaniments also. Spicy sauce is ok, but I think it's like soy sauce with sirachca mixed together. 

Clear noodles, vegetables, spicy sauce, and kimchi. I honestly after these few visits, still not sure because I couldn't get a straight answer, if they add fish product to their kimchi.

Not sure why I tried this place again. Shame on me. I wasted my money.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,7,5,2,Rf7tEoxMmffl2dGdhFX6kQ

All in all, I don't want to say that this is authentic Korean food but if you are looking for savory westernized Korean food, this is hands down the best place to go. It's also very nice to have the option to eat at a place that isn't 1000% just Korean BBQ.

First of all, this may be the best Korean dining room in Vegas. And, it would be hard to argue against that. Upon entering, one could be forgiven if they thought they were mistakenly transported to a hole in the wall joint in Seoul. The year round Christmas lights emphasizes that fact.

The service here is also pretty good. The servers are very attentive as well. They will constantly refill the water and ask to refill the banchan side dishes if needed.

Food wise, I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's good. They give great ""bang for your buck"" value. Don't be fooled by the ""tapas"" menu, these are entree sized portions! My favorite item to get here is the soondae bokeum (pork blood sausage that is spicy stir fried with veggies). That's a hard dish to find in this town, and they do it pretty well except that it's a bit too spicy for me, and that the veggies aren't as crisp as I would have liked.

They start off by bringing you tea and Banchan. I believe the tea is called Boricha, which is Barley tea. I definitely needed to acquire the taste of this tea because at first I wasn't so sure, but now I can't wait to sip on it during my meal each time I go! I've noticed their banchan varies from time to time. The most recent time they served some sort of beef, almost like brisket or something along those lines, and I was so pleasantly surprised! 

There hasn't been one meal here that I haven't liked! I have tried their Bul Go Gi (beef with vegetables), both with broth and BBQ style. I have also tried their Jea Yuk Bok Eum (sweet and spicy pork), and it was more on the spicy side than the sweet, so keep that in mind if you are thinking of trying it. I love their Bi Bim Bap, it is a bowl with beef, veggies, rice and an egg on top... mix it with their hot sauce and it is to die for! Boo Dae Jji Gae is my all time favorite to get when I am eating with a group. It is a spicy ramen (extra $2 for the noodles) with kimchi, spam, sausage, tofu and veggies. It is a large portion, so I recommend sharing it with someone or a couple people if you want to try it!

I love the atmosphere here -- it is the perfect mix of a bar and a restaurant.  You feel equally as comfortable grabbing a quick dinner, as spending the entire night chatting with friends over drinks and appetizers.  They also have a patio area, when the weather is nicer.

My favorite dish is the soondubu (tofu soup), which is perfect during the winter.  I also enjoy the garlic chicken wings, dduk bok e (spicy rice cake), jap chae, and the spicy pork.  Everything I have had here is very flavorful and there is always something new to try!  They also provide you with delicious complimentary appetizers, which is characteristic of Korean restaurants.

Their drinks are also delicious -- they have a variety of soju, beer, and wine for you to enjoy.

The thing I do not like here is that you cannot order bulgogi bi bim bap.  They refuse to make it, even if you request it, which I think is strange, but maybe it's just not authentic?  I also do not like the barley tea they automatically serve you, but they are always happy to serve iced water upon request.

Their amazing garlic chicken is cooked perfectly and blended with their special sauce...making this a winning entree for me rather than an appetizer. The crispiness of the chicken with the garlic seasoning surely makes this my favorite choice! 

Then there is the bibimbap with bulgogi served in a hot stone plate...you can never go wrong with this dish! The crispy rice on the bottom is an added treat. The protein, veggies and rice served in one is definitely one to order when in doubt.

The decor itself surprised me because it's a very oriental theme setting. It's a very nice change from the modern ""vegas"" setting theme restaurants. Soyo Korean Barstaurant's decor reminds me of the theme restaurants they have in China. They had high wall booths which created a sense of intimacy but I could still here the people sitting behind be talking. The wall decor to the cups we used to drink caught my attention and made them stick out. 

They served barley tea instead of water with thin tin bowls as cups. It was great to try but we requested water shortly after. I didn't like the tea and I am a heavy tea drinker. We ordered the Kalbi plate as well as the Spicy Beef Tofu Soup. The food came out quickly after we ordered. The Spicy Beef Tofu Soup had great flavor and the Kalbi was cooked well done, like we asked. My overall first time experience was great.

We ordered the Yogurt Cocktail Soju. It was a little stronger than what I've had before but it was good. It was only $12 for a large size of Soju. I also noticed the beers for only $3.50 a pint and $13 a pitcher which I thought was a great price!

The only aspect of holding me back on rating this place a 5 star, is the language barrier I had with our waiter. The waiter spoke enough english to take our order but not to explain clearly some of the items on the menu we had questions about. It was hard to understand what he was saying even though he was trying to pronounce his words slower. Communication was a little difficult through out our time at dining here.",jAqQ_x620Bx9ofRr9HURaA,0,0,4,NOL8Ha4-TqOdikT4MI_4mA

When it's cold, I think of any food that's warm and cozy (ramen, chicken noodle soups, jigae, beef stews, pho, cinnamon rolls).  Soyo sure fits right into the warm and cozy because they offer all kinds of Korean comfort food.  

We enjoyed...
1.  starchy potato pancakes - Might I say even more enjoyable than the kimchi pancakes?
2.  seafood soondubu - It's got a combination of tangy, spicy and warm your belly goodness!
3.  chicken wings in special sauce - these are some mutant wings!  they are gi-normous!  delicious.
4.  dolsot bi bim bap - this totally hit the spot for the windy days this past weekend.  it was hot.  not spicy hot, but HOT in a stone pot!  i love how this dish is always presented in a hot stone pot, but soyo really does it right.  The mix of rice, veggies, and beef comes out seriously sizzling, so when you go to toss it with the sauce, you have to really dig in to scrape the now crispy rice membrane at the bottom.  for those crispy rice lovers, that is certainly not a bad thing!  chewy, crispy, tasty rice!

Conclusion:  Korean comfort food at it's best.

1661915,2015-01-04,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I was lucky enough to explore Soyo with a loved one, and then come back again with my lovely mother. Both times I got the yukgaejang since it was cold out and I wanted something warm and comforting. This is consistently the spiciest yukgaejang I've had in Nevada (and up there with Phx and LA). My companion got the dolsot bibimbap and mom got the al jigae (fish stew). We got the gamja jun (potato pancake) and it was so thin and crispy and came out with this yummy sauce. Both times a good assortment of banchan came out,  everything looked right, tastes right. The cook's style reminds me of an old favorite from AZ called Seoul Jung way back in the day, very flavorful and spicy, so you're looking at the south western peninsula of Korean cooking. I'm going on a nostalgic tangent. 

They also have the best pat bing soo I've found since moving here. It's the dessert with shaved ice, red bean, little mochi cakes, fresh fruit, and condensed milk. This one has vanilla ice cream on top! I got to partake in a tradition my mom and I have had, splitting pat bing soo, since I was in high school. 

A nice thing Soyo does is have cold bori cha (barley tea) at the table for you as soon as you're seated. Barely tea is common in Korean restaurants,  but unfortunately I'm allergic and hope they'll carry green tea or some other alternative soon. 

Oh! I was telling a story about my dead phone the first time I was here and someone overheard me offering to charge my phone, they have chargers somewhere up front for guests to use.

Our most recent visit was to Soyo, and I must say I was definitely not disappointed. We arrived right before 7pm and unfortunately all of the booths were taken, but there was still plenty of large comfortable seating available. It was steady, but by no means busy until after we were finishing our meal -- then it started to get packed. We enjoyed the ambiance as well as the design. I must admit I was a bit thrown off by the ""barstaurant"" portion in the name, as the actual bar was exceedingly tiny? In any case..

The service was attentive and quick. You start off with a bottle of complementary  and refreshing barley tea to be consumed out of tin bowls. Very interesting touch, but I can see how it may throw off some diners who are not as experienced or well versed in other cultures, customs or cuisines. But then again, you have a bottle of tea and two tins in front of you. It certainly didn't require our engineering and economics degrees to put two and two together! 

I must admit that we did not experiment with the menu as much as I was hoping to because we were starving. So we opted for the safe choices: fried wings in special sauce (sauce was heavy and not particularly unique, but enjoyable), spicy pork ribs (they were actually spicy which was a welcome surprise), and korean bbq beef (pretty difficult to mess up this dish, but the meat portion was generous with very little fat). The entree came with a side of steamed rice, and several sides dishes. I enjoy kimchi and this one was very good, but I am used to a bit more spice.

Everything was very tasty and the prices more than reasonable for the amount of food  you will get. Next time I would like to explore the menu a bit more and pick foods unfamiliar to me.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,1,2,4,tjReVRGvypI8CNB5zAGtLA

In spite of its young, hip, eclectic vibe, service remains overly attentive...sometimes having 2 or 3 people ask if,  ""Everything is OK?"", as you have a big wad of kimchi in your mouth,  Of course, I give a nod and satisfied smile.

We ordered different items from our first visit.  Except, my husband couldn't resist getting the dumplings, AGAIN!  A bargain, because you get six huge ones for $5 bucks or so. It's a good value, so it the rest of their stuff. 

The Bo Ssam is my new favorite... a perfect low carb meal.  Radish kimchi, braised or maybe steamed whole napa cabbage leaves, and steamed pork belly. It was big enough for 3 as an appetizer or hearty enough for one for dinner with a little over for a delicious lunch the next day.  My husband ordered the ramen which is only $5 and is large enough to fill an average size belly on its own...if noodles are your thing.  However while the broth may be kimchi-ish flavor, the noodles are just like the Nissin packets, not like a Sora or Monta Ramen. 

Probably a solid, well prepared, tasty meal could be had for as little at $10, here.

Soyo comes closest to being anything worth going back to. Service has always been just okay except one time when a waitress put our check book on top of the to go box which was open with food in it. Very careless of her. Another time they brought the wrong order and would then bring the right one but would need to wait 15 min more after food was already on table and we were 3/4 of the way done eating at that point. I got an apology from the guy who brought the food but not from the guy who took my order, which would have been nice. Everybody else is decent though. Banchan is just ok not really great but I like their barley tea which is complimentary. On a side note although we are regulars I only recognize 1-2 waiters the rest I don't, making me wonder if they have a high turnaround. The waiters don't seem very good at what they do not do they care much hence the 3 stars. 

Items I like:
LA Gaal Bi
Jap Chae
Korean pancake with seafood
Bulgogi
Grilled pork belly
Marbled beef with salad

Items I don't like:
Fried chicken wings with garlic- very sticky and messy and breading is too hard and thick for my taste 

Soon Doo Boo used to be good and I don't like it anymore- broth has become thin and watery. 
The only downfall is they are usually busy and often times have a wait.

Cheesy corn

I would like to try spicy items but my hubby doesn't like spicy. 

 I get really jealous of people who order these red looking soups and a burner is brought to their table. I wouldn't know what to order, I think I need a Korean expert with me.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,1,3,5hIYk8C2ynQJ5drNdFOIJQ

1825040,2012-10-17,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"ARGUABLY the best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas.

Inside Soyo is a very unusual atmosphere that makes it unpredictable to determine if you're there for Korean food. It's not small nor big, making it easier for service to be fulfilled. And in my opinion, amongst all Korean restaurants, Soyo has done the best job thus far in service. 

There's a very ""industrialized"" sort of feeling inside the restaurant. For one, the tables and chairs (especially the booths), are what you see from old times in South Korea during an industrialization period. Worn out and wooden chairs with cement-like tables. I mean, it may not sound appealing, but it's a lot more unique than I describe it.

Most dishes here are like tapas. Personally, I don't like tapas because I like to eat big. My favorite has always been the ""boo-dae-ji-gae,"" which is like a spicy & meaty ramen served in a large pot on a stove right in front of you. You can never really go wrong with that. And get a couple bottles of Soju and your night is good to go. Other than that, Soyo has virtually all Korean dishes that you can think of in small servings of tapas.

Not only is Soyo a great place to eat, but a great place to drink. Not necessarily for big groups, unless you sit outside, but they have the best service. And they have your standard selection of alcohol plus more.",jCUqHcg4xvFtsG6ah6RcRA,1,1,4,hJeVYICPqUdMoAV2dbgURw

First time was delicious but would have preferred more onions. Second time I went I requested more onions, and got more onions but less japchae noodles, so you can definitely tell their foods are made to order.

Banchan first time - Macaroni Salad, Kimchi, Pickled Radish, Sweet Black Beans and can't remember the 5th.
Banchan second time - Kimchi, Pickled Radish, Radish Salad (like macaroni salad but with radishes), Seaweed

Their kimchi is fresh and less fermented, very delicious.

Barley tea for everyone at the table.

Has a very traditional Korean feel, with the lighting of a Korean bar.

Service could be better, but I attribute that largely due to the language/culture barrier. They are quick to help, they just don't understand!

it's like walking into a cozy little restaraunt in a young hip Korea.  
star 1 for the simple decor and mini video games [street fighter..& I forget the other] a giant chalkboard wall.... 

star 2 for the manga you can pulloff the shelves and read if your sitting in a booth.. 

star 3 for a very cool and welcoming waiter, and a good menu with lots of stuff to choose from.

star 4 for the yummy tasting and affordable food

they start u off with a big container of iced barley tea... [yum] I love tea, And their tea was especially good paired with the food.  

came for lunch and was very happy with the prices and selection.  we were starving so we decided we'd stay safe and order what we always ordered:

shortribs
kim chee fried rice
spicy seafood tofu soup..

with your meal your given a bunch of sides: kim chee, kim chee radishes, cold noodles, green beans, and peppers..
[very typical of Korean restaurants]  

my favorite dish was definitely the tofu seafood soup. regular spice was just enough spice.. the soup was sooo good.   

-short ribs had just a
little to much fat, but my husband liked
it very much.  

-kim chee fried rice was very good.   it was sticky and not to moist.  I hate moist watery rice! especially fried rice.   

all in all I loved the coziness.. 
-very well kept and clean
-our waiter was kind and courteous and checked on us often..

We had 7 adults and 1 child in our group. They told us that they didn't have a big enough table for us to sit together now so if we want we can wait for 30-40 min or sit at separate tables. Then we sat down at two tables. During the meal, the service was beyond horrible. The food was average.

When we asked for the check, there was a 20% tip added onto our bill. They explained the charge was for large group more than 6 people. Well, we didn't seat together so we asked to have separate check for each table. Then they still charged the 20% tip on each check. We asked to take the tip off of the bill since we only have 4 people each table and we'd like to decide on the amount of tips. They tried to argue that we had 8 people in our group no matter what. In the end, they reprinted the checks again. This time, we were charged $3 for the appetizer dishes on one of the bills because accordingly what we ordered was not supposed to have complementary appetizers. Excuse me!? First of all, if that was the case, we never asked for the appetizers. They were served with our dishes. Second, it's not stated on the menu and we were not warned.

We asked to speak with the owner because the charges were just unreasonable and the reasons they gave were ridiculous. They told us that the owner was not there and refused to revise the bills again. In the end, we didn't have the time to sit there and wait for a police to come in. We still paid for the meal with no tip.

SIDE DISHES - I like the beef steak and the macaroni salad. They also have kimchi. 

BULGOGI - Ask for it in BBQ style. I guess bulgogi in Vegas means it has broth or something. I'm used to BBQ style. It's not the best, but it's good enough to fill my cravings for Bulgogi. 

SUL LUNG TANG (oxtail soup) - It was pretty good. Just make sure you season it with salt and spices they bring your table. We only figured out until later that they want us to season it ourselves. After my boyfriend seasoned it, it was pretty good. 

DOLSOT BIBIMBAP - I like this one. Pretty good. 

LYCHEE SOJU - I only realized we can't take it home so my boyfriend and I had to finish it. Soju always has a sneak effect on me... The server said lychee is the most popular flavor for their soju.

Prices for this place are pretty decent, especially for the amount of food that you get. I usually opt for AYCE Korean restaurants, as I usually like to stuff my face with as much food as possible. But on the weird nights, where I don't want to overdo it, I go to Soyo. 

Service is great. They're fast and friendly, and always make sure your tea/water is filled. 

Now for the part I enjoy the most, alcohol !! They have a few varieties of beer. But, the real reason I go there is for the Soju [Korean alochol]. They have about 8 or 9 different flavors, if I remember correctly. It's only 12 dollars for a bottle. My favorite flavor would definitely have to be a mixture of the yogurt and the lychee.

The female waitress rushed our order without asking if we needed any advice or help, when I said I would like to order the tofu tapas. She blurted if I wanted the entree or the tapas without explaining the differences and when I asked what's the difference she only said one is the tapas and one is the entree. When the tofu arrived, I asked if we get rice with the dishes and she said no. I stated we had them last time and she said not with this dish, okay that's fine, we ordered 2 bowls of rice. When the rest of the food came out(Korean pork belly with house salad), she didn't bring the side dishes like we had last time, I waved her down and asked if we get them. She said not with these dishes, okay I assumed the pork belly was a entree considering it was 13$ and on the front of the menu close to where the entrees were and it didn't distinguish above what it fell under. She said it would be extra for the side dishes and didn't explain for which ones or anything. I asked for another menu because if I would've known any of this information before, I would've ordered an entree. 

Eating Korean food entails the side dishes such as kimchi, pickled cucumbers, beans and whatever else comes with. 

She never came back to ask if I wanted to order another dish then I saw her leaving the restaurant in a rush, get in her car and drive away. 

What sort of service is this? I came back because I had a great experience the first time and she thoroughly ruined it with her terrible lack of customer service and attitude.

Ambiance
Cool and kinda trendy haphazard quasi disheveled interior. A few booths along the side with benches and tables in the center. Try for a booth as the benches have no back support so can get uncomfortable. They're open late into the night. When we were there they had pretty loud Korean rap laced with profanities playing continuously. That's ok for a song or two, but how about some Girls Generation or other K-pop now and then?

Service
Friendly and attentive even though the servers all seemed young. They were always refilling the tea and offered to add more broth to the soup. 

Food
Delicious garlic chicken wings which were tender and tasty and crispy on the outside. Awesome!  Great spicy soup also which was flavorful and tasted great. Tons of side dishes which you can have more of too for no extra charge. Great kimchi!!

2205769,2011-03-05,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Soyo has done for Korean food what Raku did to revolutionize Japanese food in Las Vegas. Soyo is (at least of 3/4/2011) the new and trendy hidden jewel that Raku used to be for adventurous foodies in Las Vegas. Unlike Japanese cuisine which is often praised on its minimalist perfection, Korean cuisine is the celebration of the bold, spicy, and complex flavors that are relatively still new to the United States.

Just like Italian food utilizes a lot of parsley, or like how a lot of Thai or Mexican food utilizes cilantro, Korean spices mainly consist of green onions, garlic, and chili powder/paste and can be a bit spicy. 

The type of Korean food served at Soyo is much like an izakaya or tappas restaurant where you order a collection of bar food to accompany your alcoholic beverage of choice.

Besides the standard ""banchan"" or mini side dishes that accompanies every Korean meal, you should order about one entrée per every two people in your party (although this depends on the type of entrée you get) as Korean dinning is communal (think family style) and food is shared, not individually served. 

The holy grail of Soyo is the ""Bu-dae Jjigae."" A Jjigae is what Koreans would call or compare most closely with a western stew. During the Korean War when American lead UN troops were fighting on the Korean peninsula, they brought with them sausages and spam. The Koreans took this and combined it with their national stew, the ""kimchi jjigae,"" to create the ultimate poor mans comfort food. 

The Bu-dae Jjigae is spicy and big enough to feed about three to four people here, so this isn't something you'd tackle on by yourself unless you are extremely brave or foolish of heart.

The beverage of choice here is ""makgeolli"" which is a type of traditional Korean milky rice wine. The makgeolli is often served in a large urn with a ladle and you are supposed to spoon the beverage out into the bowl like cups provided for you. For those who think the makgeolli is too thick, a lot of young Koreans have been known to mix the drink with 7up or sprite and sip it as a cocktail.

The food isn't reflective of traditional or authentic Korean cuisine, but Soyo does a wonderful job in representing Korean bar food culture. Everyone should try this place out.",lcbJ_02EYZ0g1Mu6HNPzsQ,5,1,4,7T3hSS17EetV_JU_6Z4WRA

Our party of 4 snagged a booth and ordered a variety of delights: bibimbap, fried chicken, chapchae, etc.  Barley tea was flowing liberally, the banchan was plentiful and tasty, and hubby got his fill of kimchi to last for the next few weeks.  Everything was delicious and the sweet, if slightly clueless server, was more than happy to bring us drink refills and napkins (after reminding him several times).  It was nice not to have our clothes saturated with bbq smoke after our meal, something that is a given at AYCE bbq places I've patronized.

About 5 min passed between the first and second dish then about 10 min later we wondered where our 3rd dish was. Let me say the fact that nobody was around for 10 minutes isn't probably the best as far as customer service and/or possible revenue lossage for the risk of someone just walking out. So we finally find someone and we ask about our food, he said oh ya let me go check on it for you. He came back and asked us again what we were missing (so did he totally not hear us 2 min before)....we told him and then he said oh you didnt order that. We stare blankly at him and said yes we did, he continued to argue with us and even more INSULT us by pulling out his notepad and asked ""if we wanted to see his paper"".

It's kind of hard to see from the blazing lights of Oyshi Sushi but it's just off to the left of Oyshi.  This also coincided with Chris M.'s UYE, which was perfect.

Hite beer on tap (and in the bottle).  Morimoto Soba Ale on tap.  Soju. Tiny little video game machines.  That would be enough for me.

But the food is great, too! Our party of four shared a bunch of different dishes including spicy chicken with mozzarella, spicy pork belly and bean sprouts, mandu dumplings, kimchi and tofu soup, and a seafood scallion pancake.  Plus a few other dishes I did not try (so much food) and all the traditional Korean sides. The food portions are generally huge so plan accordingly.  Also, don't be afraid to mix and match.  Chris discovered that the sauce for the spicy chicken went great with the dumplings.  Who knew?

The complimentary iced barley tea was delicious and I like the tin bowl service.  But I'm pretty sure it's caffeinated so I only had a bit.

The spicy pork belly and bean sprouts came on it own portable stove, which was pretty large and unwieldy.  We ate pretty fast and didn't turn it on (were we supposed to?) so I wasn't quite sure the purpose of this as it took up valuable space on an already crowded table. 

At the end of your meal, its probably best to just approach the servers and ask for the check.  Thankfully Chris knew this or we would have been sitting for much longer wondering what was up.  Our bill was  very reasonable for all the food and alcohol my husband and I had.  Didn't even make it to the $75 mark so we could spin the wheel.  :)

I also tried the kimchi fried rice, which was extremely greasy but oh so delicious, and some Korean dumplings (no idea what they're called) that were pretty tasty.

They are good with what they do and that's creating excellent higher than average quality Korean food in a good bar restaurant environment. They have your usual Korean dishes with some being misses for me. Highly recommend their delicious spicy wings my fave, spicy enough to make me sweat a little, crispy enough to my liking borderline burnt/extra crispy. I didn't like the very spicy chicken with cheese melted on, it wasn't spicy at all and not so great even if it wasn't spicy, they might have messed up the order. The bibimbap was ok but didn't stand out. The Kalbi was good and so were they're soups. Prices are higher than I'd expected.

When you come in you'll notice that they aren't huge so you might expect to wait on busy nights/days.  They have booths built like a cubby hole or a little home and there's some patio space.

They are open pretty late into the AMs which is awesome and perfectly located for the SW people.  There are still people eating late so you don't have worry about eating alone or holding up the kitchen.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,3,1,4,eXLj9asAfLIRBa3FB_vIdg

Now, I haven't had Korean food since I studied abroad in China (weird I know) and my husband had never tried Korean food. The server was so incredibly friendly and helpful with all of our stupid questions. He told us all his favorite things and the most popular items! I got his #1 recommendation: the short rib (so mouthwatering), and then we ordered a variety of other things. My husband wanted hot noodles and the server made a recommendation that was spot on.

I have been here several times and have yet to have a bad experience. The iced barley tea has a wonderful toasty flavor and inspired me to purchase some for my home. It is especially nice in the hot summer. Although I do feel like I am drinking out of a dog bowl.

The fried dumplings come out nice and hot with a dipping sauce that complements their flavor. The Dolsot Bibimbap is great with the bowl that adds a nice crispiness to the rice. I am not a huge fan of the sweet chili rice cakes. They were a bit too sweet for my liking but the budae jjigae is delicious. 

When ever I go here I leave with leftovers. I recommend taking people you do not mind sharing with.

Just as a warning, you can ask them to make the spicy grilled chicken with mozzarella as spicy as they can and they do not hold back... I have a pretty good tolerance for spice and wow. My eyes were immediately watering with just one bite and it was one of those burns that just gets stronger. I am not the one who ordered it but the person who did saw it as a challenge and did complete the dish.

When we walked in we sat at a table with two benches. The waitress suggested that we sit at a booth so we'd be more comfortable. We took her suggestion and moved to a booth by the wall. She asked if we'd been there before, and we told her it was our first time.

She was very nice and explained the menu and told us about the complimentary tea and sides.

I am not a big fan of tea, but it was pretty good. Kind of like a woodsy, green iced tea.

She then brought out the sides which consisted of seaweed salad,
green flower with sesame (I think that's what she called it, looked kinda like broccoli rabe), Cole slaw, marinated potatoes, kim chee, and marinated cabbage stems (I think that's what it was). My favorites were the potatoes and the cole slaw.

For our entrees we ordered the kimchee and pork soup and the kalbi beef ribs. The soup was hot, both spice and temperature-wise. In fact it was boiling when she brought it out. It was really good and a perfect antidote to my cold. The kalbi was also very good. It was well-marinated and had a nice char to it.

The waitress checked on us frequently to make sure everything was okay and see if we wanted any more of the sides.

RE: Pick up orders. I wish they would give more rice for some of the soups/stews. I got sul lung tang (ox bones soup) to go and ended up making rice. I think double the rice would be sufficient.

RE: Appetizers & Main dishes. I wasn't a fan of their mandoo (dumplings), spicy, marinated chicken wings, haemul jun gol (seafood casserole), mussels soup, and kimchi chigae but I like their omelette rice and corn cheese. Their kimchi bokkumbap and soon tofu were alright. I forgot what else I ordered from here even though I've been here more than ten times.

RE: Banchan. Probably one of the better selections of side dishes that Korean restaurants in Vegas offer for the most part except their kimchi. It can be a hit or miss depending on what type they serve.

It took far too many years for me to include Korean food as one of the mainstays when eating out. I think it was because I was so dreadfully afraid of receiving a KOREAN KIMCHI SLAP...and if you're not familiar with that, you should google that now and rest assured that you are in no danger of such a horrible experience happening at Soyo. 

The bibimnaengmyeon is my favorite.  It is cold buckwheat noodles in a spicy sauce with some fresh root veggies for a little texture. It is a little on the spicy side, but an ancillary benefit is that it helps to clean you out the morning after. Another Soyo favorite is their Soondubu Jjigae (Spicy Tofu Soup). I don't mind tofu, but I rarely looked forward to ordering tofu until I came across this dish. Korean heat is one of my favorite styles for spicy foods.  This dish balances that heat, with rich and full flavors. A final go-to is Soyos Chaa Dol Baak E Boo Choo Moo Chim Salad. This dish is certainly light on the salad and plentiful with thin slices of marbled beef. What the salad brings is a nice bit of acid to cut the fattiness of the savory beef.

Soyo is a ""Barstaurant"" which, best as I can tell, means it's a restaurant that can at times have a fun, slightly lively, feeling going on when the Soju is flowing freely. Still the name is a bit vexing. In general, it is just a cool Korean restaurant...so stop by and check it out if you're looking for good Korean eats!",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,8,9,4,eBP6qSVN2_4V3jbw3b65CQ
2481679,2011-02-05,3,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"This is my first review here on yelp, so bear with me. Anyways, thanks to a buddy of mine (who is also a yelper) I have discovered a new outlook and love for Korean food. My past experiences consisted pretty much of Korean table BBQ (which is great!) and their instant noodles. That is pretty much all I knew until I went to the Soyo Korean Barstaurant. The variety of different types of Korean foods was amazing since I didn't know they existed. I mean I knew that there had to be more to Korean foods, but I just had the impression that they only specialized in BBQ. 

Some of the dishes that I tried were the ""Odang"" (fish cake soup) which was absolutely amazing! On my first sip of the broth it reminded me of the Japanese Miso soup, but just 20 times better and a lot richer in flavor. Another dish that I tried was the whole fried chicken with the salt/pepper and the sesame oil. The chicken was cooked just perfectly, so it wasn't too dry, moreover the skin was nice and crispy with lots of flavor. For those of you that prefer a heavier flavor you can use the salt/pepper combo or sesame seed oil which compliment the chicken perfectly. 

My personal favorite at Soyo is the Budae jjigae which is an Army based stew. To give you a a quick overview of what it is, it's basically a bunch of stuff tossed in a big pot of spicy soup. The ""stuff"" consists pretty much of korean instant noodles, spam, hot dogs, sausage, rice cakes, and kimchi. This may seem like an odd combination for a soup, but TRUST me, it's the perfect dish for those cold days. It's also a good alternative to the typical bar food that you may eat, and after having the Budae jjigae, I would choose it over the buffalo wings, french fries etc. any day of the week.

I have tried some other dishes as well, unfortunately I forget the names of them, but let me tell you that they all were delicious! It's not everyday that you can find a restaurant where you like everything that they serve.

Not only is the food absolutely amazing, but the staff is friendly as well and very attentive. They also serve a variety of different types of alcohol, and specialize in a variety flavors of soju. Prices are also very reasonable. Overall I give this place 4 stars as of right now, I would give it 5 stars but since I don't have another place to compare it to currently I can't determine if it deserves a perfect score or not.

So yes, definitely check this place out if you get the chance, it's worth the time, worth the drive, and worth the money.

Soyo is so great I vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. Never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie...",GokcEonmSuL2b8D2Y36CUw,4,3,4,t4xhRRHF3mjXen95DbAIFA

I write this with huge disappointment because I frequented this place for the past two years. There clearly was a small piece of dirty plastic in my hot stone beef soup. It's unfortunate that I found this piece of plastic in my mouth at the bottom of the soup after I ingested most of the dish. I asked the server if he could ask the chef where it came from. He came back and said it was probably a chip from the stone pot that I was eating out of. 
At that moment, I knew there was no point on making a bigger issue out of it. If the chef can't even be completely honest with me, there was no point in arguing with them. I simply wanted the truth to what it could possibly be because I want to know what goes into my body. Clearly he accidentally dropped or broke something inside the soup while he was making it. THERE IS NO PLASTIC IN A STONE POT!!!!

They add seaweed in this one which I have never tried in any of the soups I've ordered before. It adds a great touch to bring the whole soup together. The only thing that bothered me was that the beef was very chewy and chunky. Soyo could benefit from slicing the beef into smaller pieces. The tofu was also very broken up like it had gotten a good beating before it was served on the table. 

The restaurant not only serves Korean food but also comes equipped with a full bar. Our party of 5 sat at one of the booths and sipped on yogurt soju, which consisted of all soju.

It's a chilly winter night and soondubu (spicy hot tofu soup) was on our radar. We chose this quaint little spot and we're very glad we did! 

Soyo Korean Barstaurant has a cute name and an even cuter romantic atmosphere with a Korean bar charm. Imagine twinkling Christmas lights dangling from the ceiling and the booths tucked away in the back with steps and shutters making them look like little mini apartment rooms. The ambiance is sweet to say the least. 

The complimentary barley tea to sip in little tin bowls is as legit as you can get! So earthy, nutty, and healthy to boot! We love the stuff. 

The banchan offering were all flavorful and authentic. We went for seconds and thirds of the kimchi and the sweet crunchy seaweed snack. They really enhanced our dishes. Flavor rating: 4/5

Here's what we sampled:
Soon Doo Boo JJI Gae (Spicy tofu soup with beef) $8 - the soup base was on the bland side and not very spicy, even though I asked for it to be very spicy. I may consider ordering this dish again, as hot soup cures a lot of winter aliments, yet I might just have to add my own makeshift seasonings (ie: banchan/kimchi, spicy red sauce/sriracha, soy sauce, you name it!) Flavor rating: 3/5

Kim Chi Jyun (Korean traditional kimchi pancake) $7 - thin and super crispy, yet a little tad on the oily side. However great flavor and decent portion makes up for it. Flavor rating: 4/5

Japchae (sweet potato noodles stir fried in sesame oil with vegetables and beef Bulgogi meat) - Great flavor and they really loaded it up with veggies and meat, but the noodles were sparse. I would recommend the dish but we would probably request extra noodles in the future. Flavor rating: 4/5

The portions are decent and the prices are reasonable. Some minor complaints but overall we would return for their yummy Korean bar-style dining!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,6,4,4,w1IHwQ-qwFBv8zrrT7-NnA

There's mini arcade games by the entrance, cozy booths with Korean comics on their shelves, and a swanky dim ambience. The staff is very welcoming and they are very attentive.

2732715,2010-12-28,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I've been wanting to come to this place more often because of my latest obession with Korean food, but I have either chickened out or haven't been able to find a food adventure partner in the late-night hours of when those Korean food cravings hit. Also, as someone who is not fully familiar with Korean cuisine, I got a little intimidated by the 'barstaraunt-y' feel of this place. The menu is in half korean and half english, with the english being only the descriptions and the korean being only the name of the dish. This made my first attempt at trying Soyo a challenge as I was armed only with a list of korean dishes spelled out in english from my best friend who was teaching in South Korea at the time. Ultimately, my first time trying to venture out of my sundubu/kalbi/bulgogi triumvirate of Korean dishes ended up with me trying their ""milky soup with oxtail and beef pieces"" dish that I had to flavor with salt myself. Needless to say, I didn't know what I was doing and ended up with a really salty, milky oxtail soup where my comrades stuck to what they knew and got some really yummy bulgogi soup in a steaming hot clay pot. 

The second time, however, I came armed with my actual best friend who just got back from teaching in Korea and he not only translated what was in the dishes but ordered for us and we ended up getting filled up on much less than what I spent last time. This time around we got the kimchee fried rice and a spicy version of the beef rib stew with vegetables and that was more than enough with the banchan to fill us up. The stew was delicious: sweet with a soy sauce-based soup, with carrots, onions, and other veggies. The meat was definitely falling-off-the-bone tender, but even though we ordered it spicy, the heat wasn't memorable at all. The kimchee fried rice was sticky, spicy, and eggy--everything I expected and so yummy all the same. The banchan was pretty decent, however the egg omelet thing was way too salty for either of us to take, even for our asian palates. My friend commented that the kimchee was really good, but the daikon was too sweet. For some reason, as our experience progressed, it seemed like a party was growing inside the restaurant and I started to realize why they call it a 'barstaraunt'. It really does turn into a bar/club-like atmosphere after a certain hour, and considering it was around 11 on a Monday night, I'd say that's pretty typical for the young asian american crowd on a holiday week. 

I want to keep coming back to this place, but my friend keeps insisting that a lot of the dishes they charge quite a bit for are actually cheaper and easier to make at home. Seeing as I'm still a major newbie at the Korean food thing, I may come back a few more times until my friend shows me the ropes of how to insert some Korean cuisine into my kitchen.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,2,2,4,_Arsgmyp1taxpLbU2y6zRA

My wife and I used to go to Soyo at least 2x a month when we lived in Las Vegas, because it was 10 minutes away from us. It is always open pretty late too, so we went for lunch, dinner, or a late night meal. We always ordered the same thing every time we came to eat: I would order the ""L.A. Gaal Bi"" (this is the actual name of the dish there) and my wife would get the ""Soon Doo Boo JJI Gae"" (this is the spicy tofu soup and she would get it with seafood). My short ribs were always pretty tasty, although they may not be the best that I've ever had. That dish only costs $15 though, which is cheaper than a lot of other Korean restaurants in town. The seafood tofu soup, on the other hand, is one of the best ones we've ever tried and it's only $8! So you definitely won't break the bank at Soyo!

We've gone a couple other times, and tried some of the other dishes, which we weren't as fond of, like the ""Kong Naa Mool O Jing Uh Saam Gyup Saal"" (bean sprout and pork belly casserole). First of all, this dish has the longest name ever, and it is an enormous dish, but the taste is just ok. Also, it's one of the more expensive dishes on the menu at $23.00.

Anyway, this was always one of our favorite places to go eat when we were in Las Vegas, and now we miss it dearly. We try to make time for it when we fly back to Vegas every once in a while, but I wish there was a Soyo in the Bay Area. Affordable and tasty. Good service, and really cool divey atmosphere.

Everything on the menu looked really good, but I decided to go with the Dolsot Bimimbap ($9).  If you have never had this, it's served in a stone pot and rice, egg, veggies, and beef.  I've only had Bimimbap at a few other places (so I am far from being an expert), but this is probably the best I've tried.  The rice that hardened from the heated stone pot is seriously the best part!  

I got to sample a few other things too and I was totally impressed:

Chicken Wings -
  These were doused in some amazing marinade.  I do not have the slightest clue as to what it is (perhaps it's some homemade concoction of some sorts), but it was definitely memorable!  The wings itself were huge too!  These came off some ripped chickens!

Budae Jigae (I totally did not know what the stew was since I didn't order it, so I had to rely on a fellow Yelpers review for the name)-
   This is what is going to bring me back to this place!  The portion of this thing was out of control (perfect for sharing).  I honestly do not even know what was in it:  noodles, Spam, and pieces of bacon.  Whatever it was, it was full of goodness!  It had a spice to it that gave it an awesome kick.  Not too spicy though so you can actually enjoy the taste.

Pros:
*  decently priced
* filling portions
* authentic food
* endless Barley tea in some tin bowl (I love it!)

Cons:
*  The only con I can think of is that I slept on this place for too long... If you haven't been, you definitely have got to try it.  I'm so taking my gf here the next chance I get.

Tips:
*  Come hungry!
* Yes, they have flavored Soju for those wondering.
* They are open late to satisfy your late night K-Food cravings

  I will surely be back and I'll update my review when I try other things on the menu.  I can't wait !!! (Salivating w/ anticipation)",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,5,4,5,E3d30oZ0F9wA9MvdGptrBQ

Like other Korean restaurants, they also serve small complimentary side dishes like kimchi, pickled radish and fish cake with your meal. They used to serve their cold tea in these tin bowls that kinda look like small dog bowls. They recently switched to tea cups but I have to admit, I miss the novelty of drinking out of the tin bowl. It actually made the beverage seem more refreshing. Try to get seated in one of their booths. It's cozy and I like the feeling of being tucked away in my own little alcove.

Soyo has a large menu and I've enjoyed everything I tried, so far. I gravitate towards items such as the gal bi jim (beef stew in hotpot, grilled mackerel and the dukbokki (spicy rice cake).

Located in an unassuming strip mall (same as Oyshi), Soyo serves up Korean ""bar"" food late into the night. I've eaten in the patio, in the ""upstairs"" area with a large group, in the booths, and in the picnic tables in the main floor. The place isn't huge, but they definitely try to use up as much space as possible. My favorite dishes are the garlic chicken wings, tofu soup and corn cheese. The ban chan choices here change periodically - just last night, they had a side dish of this really tender, marinated beef that was really mouth-watering. They do get really busy here, so at times there can be a long wait. I've seen so many different types of people here, which I think goes to show that Soyo is a crowd pleaser. Just last night, I saw the parents of two newborns dining here, so you know the food must be good if they're willing to go out of their way to eat here. They give you barley tea in a tin bowl as soon as you are seated, but hot tea and iced water are available as well. I'm not as big of a fan of the Soju (prefer places in SF more), but this place is a solid Korean option on Westside.

We had been talking about trying this place for a while now. With much anticipation, yesterday became the day we finally experienced Soyo Korean Barstaurant!

Soyo is located on the west side of Rainbow Blvd, just south of Robindale Road. It is kind of tucked away in a little strip mall, so it could be easy to miss.

Positives-

- the interior is unique and charming, IMO. We sat in one of the booths, which was enclosed with a decorative awning with some interesting decor in the interior. lol It was great as far as allowing a good degree of privacy. The lights on the ceiling was a nice touch as well.

- We had no idea what to order and must have looked pretty confused lol So one of the servers was great about explaining many items on the menu and asked questions as to what we might like. He was fantastic! Both employees we encountered were very friendly and helpful.

- We ordered the BBQ Bulgogi ($12), the L.A. Gal Bi ($15). We enjoyed the complimentary tea that is situated on every table(nice!) and I enjoyed a Miller Lite Draft($4). The Gal Bi was incredible! So tasty and flavorful! I am definitely coming back for more of that! The BBQ Bulgogi was really good too. But to be honest here, the Gal Bi was the star of the show on this night!

-Total bill for 2 people came to $33.51 after all was said and done and I was quite comfortable with that. 

Meh-

- we ordered an ice water with the other drinks and it just never showed up. After asking twice, we just had more of the tea and let it go, but I would think it should be pretty easy to get an ice water in most places.

- the table setting came with only chopsticks and spoons lol I had to ask for a fork because I am just terrible with those damn chopsticks! Really they should just set all 3 out at each table. But honestly, this was no biggie at all.

Overall, I really enjoyed Soyo and can definitely recommend it and say that I will be back to try more of the menu.

2931775,2012-09-06,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"The atmosphere in Soyo felt modern-industrial, but the food is comfort and classic.  First, at the table you are greated with a pitcher of the iced barley tea.  I haven't had this before, and I am smitten.  Before I tasted it, I got a whiff of aroma somewhere between chocolate and coffee... I thought that there was no way that this could come from the light colored liquid in front of me, but it did.  The tea tasted like toasted grains with a subtle coffee-like flavor.  I need to learn to make this!  The friend I went with was psyched about one of the sides including a potato salad.  That was not an option this night, but it was replaced by a seaweed salad with similar creamy seasoning... I could eat this for breakfast, delicious!  

We ordered the bulgogi, friend rice with smelt egg, and kimchee pancake (after seeing several mentions in reviews, I couldn't resist).  $27 total for the meal and both of us had a meals worth of leftovers, winner!

The bulgogi was fantastic.  The broth was subtle yet complex, beef was tender, the veggies were crisp, and I love the addition of enoki mushrooms.  I'm still warming up to the flavor of kimchee, but paired with a bit of the beef, and I'm smitten.  Plus, who doesn't love a hot pot?

The fried rice smelt egg was more complex than I expected with an assortment of grains and crisp veggies to mix in (some pickled roots, some fresh - like chopped cucumber and carrot), it too was served in a hot pot so we got to fight over the delicious crispy rice crust on the bottom of the pot.

the kimchi pancake was ""delightful"", as my friend said. I didn't know what to expect here, but I loved the chewy rice flour holding it together.  It wasn't too kimchi-ey (it didn't feel like a mouthful of ferment), and the subtle dipping sauce served with it really brings out the flavors, and compliments it nicely.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3,1,5,-m9S8TAx6gBpNK3CGH1lDQ

Just to give it another shot, I went with a friend again and a person who has never tried Korean food.  Other than the ok galbi, both of us thought every other dish was insipid, overcooked, and just gross.

Having never experienced Korean BBQ before I was a little hesitant but I do enjoy trying new things from different cultures (within reason).  This visit I had the Dol Sot Bi Bim Baap...aka the number 6 :-)  I enjoyed the meal except for the crispy seaweed strips that adorned the top of the bowl.  I know, I know...it's the way it should taste but every time I taste seaweed anything it reminds me (sorely) of being tossed upside down at the Jersey shore and coming up with a mouth full of water.  The rest of the bowl was quite nice but really didn't knock my socks off in the flavor department.  It wasn't flavorful or spicy or all that complex of a taste...kind of all ran together, taste-wise. Maybe there's something such as a sauce I should have added to the bowl?

Service was excellent.  I swear 4 different people came to the table to ensure everything was up to snuff.  Maybe that's how it always is, maybe it's because they could sense the fear in the white boys eyes.  Whatever the reason, I dig it.  I hope to return again soon so that I can try something the regulars suggest that may have a little more flavor to the dish.

p.s. I don't know who the foxxy lady is guarding the bathroom with the sign that says ""Take me home"" but can you give her my number?  Thanks.",UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw,2,1,3,U4qok00BQm9oxFso1IKPyA
2955599,2013-01-23,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Excellent quality and ambiance, great for families or late night drinking. I really enjoy how Soyo is the closest thing in Las Vegas to an urban restaurant found scattered in Korea. The greyish walls with accents of wood furniture around the dining room puts a nice interior touch.

I had the Bu-dae soup which is a spicy combination of veggies, meat and noodles. It's a great dish for sharing and even better with a serving of soju or makguli (rice wine). The cheese donkatsu is also a signature dish that's great for late-night munching. All while the prices are very reasonable ranging from $8 for a single dish or $24 for a soup/jeungol order fit for sharing. I finished off with a papingsu dessert which is shaved ice with red beans layered with a few scoops of ice cream. Fantastic meal all around.

I enjoy the attention to detail with the little things like having an outside patio with a pitched tent, it just screams nostalgia for me.

When you first walk in, there are a couple of mini arcade games with a set of mini chairs.  My friend and I were playing co-op and we were basically squatting over our chairs.  I love that they have these old school games, and I would probably come back JUST to play.

As for the food, I haven't been to a Korean restaurant in Vegas that tastes better than Soyo's.  I've gotten something different everytime I come here and I have yet to be disappointed, but I also haven't had anything that really stands out and says ""Devour Me!""",ZXuzNVdGTdSXjz8QjBS9Hg,0,0,5,mUVE58fzizpU8EhDAsceDg

Soyo is not afraid to take on the Korean street foods that attract college students, but they also do a wonderful job with the hearty and traditional dishes that bring the daddies and mommies out with their children. SKB has a young, vibrant staff that speaks both English and Korean.

A few of my favorites are: 
Soon Dae Bokk Eum...stir fired korean blood pork sausage and vegetables with hot sauce
O Daeng Tang...fish cake soup with steamed radish
Kim Chi Jyun...korean traditional kimchi pancake
Soon Doo Boo Jji Gae...spicy soft-tofu soup with seafood (but you can choose beef, pork, or  vegetables also) 

Rice is always cooked perfect...easy to overlook, but I appreciate how well they consistently do it. Their complimentary Barley tea is great also. Occasionally, we order Soju-cocktails...yogurt is our favorite...drinks so smoothly and easily that it could get you in trouble sometimes.

SKB has an extensive menu...featuring over 60 items arranged as: entrée, noodles, soup, casseroles, tapas, new menu, and desserts...there is not even one item I would not want to try but my stomach is not that big, so I am content to come back with my love and try them one at a time.

3014451,2011-09-11,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"So yo want some yum-o Korean food, come on down to Soyo Barstaurant.  Open till the next morning, this place is quaint, cheap, and boasts a full bar.  What caught my attention was the sign outside--simple and sweet.  I love the games at the front door, the unique booth seating, and the old TV used as decor in the eating area.  There's even a dead chicken hanging from a bell at the bar!  

The menu is simple and broken down by types of dishes.  The bulgogi is served in a stone pot and the kalbi served on the usual cabbage on a platter.  I ordered some fried dumplings with special sauce, korean fried chicken in spicy sauce, bulgogi and kalbi.  

They provide green tea with corn for free and serve it in tin bowls instead of cups, which I LOVE.  The food takes about 10-15 minutes, but well worth the wait since they provide the usual side dishes while you wait.  Everything came out piping hot and very, very, VERY good.  The dumplings, although listed as tapas, was the side of my palm and there were six of them.  The special sauce was yummy, the dumplings were so darn good and soft but crispy.  The filling--rice, meat, vegetables--was flavorful and well balanced.  It felt like a lumpia filling but better.  They definitely make those on premises.  

The bulgogi and kalbi are outstanding.  They're better than the $25 cook-your-own BBQ we usually get in Chinatown.  If anyone's been to Guam, it tastes like Seijong's food.  The bulgogi is yummy and in a broth with clear noodles and dumpling slices, and the kalbi is BBQ'd to perfection.  The sauce is killer in both.  

The KFC is really darn good!  I'm going to have to ask to lay off the sauce a bit since it was drenched, but they do it pretty well.  I was just happy to find one that does serve it and at least gets close enough to K-town's as we can get, although nothing beats K-town's KFC in LA.  Anyway, it's spicy, sweet, sticky, but super crispy, which made it yum-o.

With all the food we ordered, we were out 43 bucks--a steal.  With great food and the fact that the kitchen is open late, this makes Soyo a winner in my book.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,0,0,4,bxUs8xOyWEVFHT8Eq5gw6w

3026299,2011-02-03,8,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I went to Soyo with the Yelp Elites after an Elite Event. I have driven past this place a couple hundred times and never would have thought about stopping in if it hadn't the official after Event dinner spot.

Soyo isn't very large, but they were able to handle our group of around 20 without much trouble. The place is much different than the other korean places I've dined (most have been AYCE). The meal started with some cold Roasted Barley Tea, which wasn't really too great IMO (a little too smokey), but I'm always open to try something new, and the waiter later brought me water with a pitcher to refill my glass.

The menu isn't the biggest in town (around 50 items), but everything I tried was really really good.

I am a Korean Food rookie and stick with what I know, The Bulgogi, and I can say it was without a doubt the best bulgogi I've had in vegas. The meat was tender, the veggies were crisp, the sauce was flavorful but not overbearing, and the hot clay pot it was served in was a nice touch. I will be going back for this dish alone, however that was not the crowning jewel of the evening.

One part of the Korean eating experience (and it goes double when you are with yelpers) is sharing. I got to try a bunch of items I would never had ordered on my own.

Their Dumplings were amazing, I am slowly trying my best to eat vegas out of dumplings, and these were nothing short of yummy!  I also tried the Fish Cake Soup, and while it wasn't what I had in mind (how do ribbons of fish count as cake?), it was surprisingly good.

But the Dish that stole the night was Budae Jjigae, I am going to be honest I have never heard of Budae Jjigae before, and without this trip and the brave souls who ordered it, I may never have. It's a stew that consists of random meats married with ramen noodles, and served boiling hot in a spicy (but not too hot) sauce. The meats in the Budae Jjigae served last night appeared to be Spam, Hot Dogs, Vienna Sausages, and possibly more. 

I have a feeling after my diet is completed I will be doing my best to finish an order or two of Budae Jjigae!

The Ban Chan were all pretty good, the rice was your standard white rice, the raddish was really good, and the Kim Chi was nice (I prefer mine cooked rather than cold however).

One thing I did learn, when they say Spicy on the menu at a Korean Resturant they mean SPICY!!! One Yelper ordered the Spicy Pork Ribs, I tried a piece of cabbage with the Spicy Sauce and think I burnt a layer of taste buds off my tounge!

I really like the set up at Soyo, the service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere is pretty fun, and after a while the Kpop music grows on you.

Oh and they have 2 tiny arcade consoles that looked pretty fun, but I was afraid to play as they looked like I could break them by just looking at them funny, yet alone playing them.

3039687,2015-05-17,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Officially, our default restaurant when we want to eat healthy and hang out with friends. I have now been over a dozen times so can issue an in-depth and accurate review. 

First off, you can never tell what the crowd is going to be here. We have popped in on a Friday night and been one of two parties there. Then the next week walked in on a Tuesday at 5pm and there was a twenty minute wait. 

No matter the wait, the staff is always excellent. The thing to remember is that once the meal starts, the staff is not going to bother you unless you flag them down. Everything comes out in a wave, and you're left alone to talk and eat. So don't get offended, that's just the way things are.

Have not had one bad thing so far. Our favorite is the Chaa Dol Baak E Boo Choo Moo Chim - Marbled beef with greens. This is a light, delicious and healthy meal fit for one hungry or two kinda hungry people. We get it every time we go regardless. If it's a little chilly out, try the Boo Dae JJI Gae. A full pot of sausages and tofu goodness sat boiling right at your table for everyone to pick from. 

I must admit, the Dol Sot Bi Bim Baap is not the best we've had. Way to much rice and not enough veggies and meat. However, what you do get is very good. 

They do make it 21 and over at a certain time, but I think it's after 10pm and we never stay up that late anyways. Just be forewarned.

So that's it. The best Korean place in town right now as far as we're concerned. Give yourself a little nutritious break and stop by sometime for a bite.",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,1,1,4,6BqeMBrlneyPFegWABUEMQ

I love the food but the customer service has dropped tremendously. 
The last multiple times I've been here, I was rushed to eat my food. I remember specifically the last time I came which was last month, I came at 2 AM. I came right from work and Soyo's hours said that they don't close until 4 AM. Well great for me because I really wanted to eat their cheese donkatsu.  
My coworker and I came in and the waiter told us that they're closing early. I said okay and he seated us and immediately went to sweeping the floor. We already knew what we wanted and he came within a minute and rushed us for our order. He asked us if there was anything else we wanted because we won't be able to order again. 
I understood that they wanted to close everything early because it was slow and really cold but closing two hours early was a bit too much. 
We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and within the next 25 minutes he already gave us our check and to go boxes. We felt so rushed to eat our food that we just put everything into the to go boxes and left to eat in the car.
The funny thing is that every time we got rushed, it was from the exact same waiter. I can understand everything he was probably feeling but I like to treat my customers the way I wanted to be treated, no matter how bad I want to close up shop and go home. I just wished he would do the same.

The banchan (side dishes) are complimentary with your entree and they are so good. They offer a cold barley tea and serve it in these cute little metal bowls. Refills are free! I ordered the bulgogi but it's definitely not your traditional bulgogi. I'm used to BBQ style bulgogi ...

This restaurant, or barstaurant, has become one of my fave places to eat in the southwest part of town. Not only are they conveniently open late, but their food is bomb.

One of my fave Korean comfort food is Spicy Tofu Soup. That is usually what I order from here and it's actually what I make the drive for if the craving is just too real. lol And because this restaurant has bar-styled food, I gotta get my side order of fries to go with it. Try the squid too. The portions of some menu items are great for sharing. And like most Korean restaurants, they include free banchan (mini side dishes) when dining in.

From all the times that I've been here, customer service has never really been a problem. The staff is usually quick, but it can get pretty busy here. Seating is pretty limited, as the restaurant itself is not that big. They do have patio seating, which is nice for those not so cold nights.

The atmosphere is a throwback to old-style Korean bars, complete with dim lighting, wooden booths, wood furnishings, metal bowls for sipping barley tea (I've only seen that in Korea), and small arcade machines. This place is a great find for those looking for good Korean food served in a fun, relaxed atmosphere. The servers were nice and very accommodating- they moved tables and chairs around so that our large party could all be seated at the same table, they didn't seem to have a problem making individual checks, and they patiently answered our questions about the different items from the diverse menu. 

When I go to Korean restaurants, I usually order the Yuk Gae Jang, a spicy beef soup with vegetables, shredded beef, egg & rice vermicelli noodles, and this time was no different. I was surprised at how fast our food came out. My Yuk Gae Jang was served in a stone pot to keep it hot and with a bowl of rice. Normally, other restaurants serve Yuk Gae Jang in a regular bowl, but I definitely preferred the stone pot. Be careful though, although the soup isn't bubbling, it still is very hot (I think I burned the inside of my mouth). Anyways, I definitely put this Yuk Gae Jang on my list of Top Yuk Gae Jangs that I've tried in Las Vegas. I enjoyed the deep, spicy flavors of the soup and the good amount of veggies, noodles & meat. I would definitely order this dish again. I also tried a piece of pan-fried dumpling (Mandu), which I could tell was homemade. The dumpling skin was crispy yet soft, and the filling was fresh and light. I also liked how the dumplings were shaped. 

In conclusion, I had a fun time here with my other Yelpers. I can't wait to come back with my friends in tow to show them how great Korean food can be.

I'm beginning to realize that Korean food is one of my favorite genre of foods. I was really impressed what Soyo brought to the table, especially for the high standards of dining in Las Vegas. Portion sizes are generous, the menu is filled with diverse, reliable options, and the bang for your buck is ridiculous. I would return here in the future, even as a tourist.

My friend and I ordered the corn cheese, bulgogi, and La Duk Bokki (ramen duk bokki) for the two of us.

CORN CHEESE (5/5)
- The best corn cheese I've had in a while
- CHEESE PULL WAS AMAZING
- A great texture, not too creamy like most corn cheeses
- Good portion size
- Great mozzarella taste

BULGOGI (4/5)
- More dry than I expected
- Still flavorful, but missing that ""sauciness""
- A lot of meat for the portion
- Paired well with side dishes

LA DUK BOKKI (4/5)
- HUGE portion size
- Great dish to fill you up
- Not as ""wet"" as I'm used to, could be saucier
- Lots of variety in one dish

I felt very positively about my experience at Soyo. The staff was very attentive and helped us with anything we needed. I really liked that there was indoor and outdoor seating available. Eating outdoors helped with not smelling like Korean food for the rest of the night. I can go on and on about my great experience, but I think you get the gist.

Soyo is a place that provides great Korean food for a great price.

I must say this place reminds me of back in the days when the hubby and i used to go late night eating and drinking a lot in LA.
It seems to be really hard to find a decent korean resteraunt around vegas. Coming out here from Los Angeles and orange county where there are so many korean resteraunt that are amazing because of the competition.
Anyways service here is pretty good. Everyone is super friendly and pretty quick.

Ambiance is fun and the decor looks like little stands that they usually would have outdoors on the streets called ""po jang ma cha""
They have a little spinning wheel for prizes which always fun...
The food is actually flavorful here and I would have to say they have improved over the years as well!
They give a really nice variety of side dishes which is always a plus!

My favorite dish here is the ""CHA DOL BAE GI BOO CHOO MOO CHIM"" which is pretty much sautéed marbled beef brisket with garlic slices and it's served with a soy base sauce which is delicious! Plus it comes with a serving of chive salad which I always order an extra side.

GAMJA TANG - bone in beef and potato spicy soup. This soup is to be shared because it comes in quite a large serving like most korean TANGS are served to share amongst everyone. The flavor of the soup is refreshing and it goes great with some beer or soju! And they offer more soup base if it starts to run low. 

This is definately my goto if i don't feel like eating at home and especially when my friends visit from out of town!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,5,6,4,c-4qhUACJgcwuZdq5wVYFg

I digress, soyo is very good. I like the atmosphere in this cozy place. The service is good. Waiters and waitresses are very attentive and come around often (maybe I get better service because I'm Korean and speak to them in Korean). Keep in mind this is a barstaurant and not a restaurant. So there is music playing and an upbeat atmosphere. On to my favorite part, the food and drink =)

I love the flying saucer / UFO shaped mandoo, only place I've seen do this. This allows for mandoo with tons of filling, but it can be a little difficult to eat. the Kal bi and Kal bi jjim (stewed/braised Kal bi) are both very delicious. Bul gogi comes in a hot pot with various accoutrement, very delicious. Slup up the broth as well. The chicken wings are saucy and sticky delicious. The scallion pancake here is very tasty as well (better than china mama if you ask me). The soft tofu soup is a bowl of deliciousness. I need to stop because I can go on and on. 

To wrap things up, the food here is done well. Everything is well seasoned and full of flavor. Also, I was reading las Vegas seven magazine and one of the top chefs in Vegas frequents soyo. So that's got to be some kind of street cred right there. =)

Came on a cold winter night to get some piping hot Korean stew. The place was poppin' with the EDM music blasting, which I must say was a bit distracting to the general ambiance. The menu has a ton of stews and bbq dishes. For two of us, we ended up getting the gamjatang (pork bone and potato stew) and a squid and garlic in soy sauce tapa. The tapa came out first and it was pretty delish. Squid was chopped into small pieces and the garlic was cooked until they were super sweet. The soy sauce wasn't too salty and it was a good, simple little appetizer that came in aluminum foil wrap. Pretty interesting to have it just in foil. As for the gamjatang, the pot was put on the portable gas burners so it was kept hot the whole time. The stew was filled with pork bone and potatoes. A bit skimpy on the veges so we actually asked for another side order of vegetables ($2.50), which we thought was super worth it cuz it was pretty much another pot of soup and veges. Meat wasn't extremely tender and fall off the bone. Needed some work to get it off and the potatoes took a bit long to get cooked. The flavor of the soup wasn't as strong as I would like as well. No matter how long you left it to cook, it tasted about the same. I would look maybe at the boodaejigae instead of the gamjatang because it seemed like that would have more flavor.

Overall though, the service and the ambiance made up for the food. Service was very responsive and on point. They were all super friendly. As for the ambiance, other than the blasting music, the place was decorated very ""Korean-y"" in my opinion. A few knick knacks around the place with cute booths. A chalkboard wall that advertises their soju flavors. They also have outside seating. Not used in the winter for obvious reasons (BRRR!!!) Would definitely come back.

I am not joking about this time frame.  After everyone had finished, we waited a polite amount of time, trying to catch the eye of one of the servers and then we finally had to get up to ask for the bill.  Annoying.  At least offer us more drinks if you are going to make us sit there for 45 minutes.

The food -  Probably the best food was the kimchi pancake and the seafood pancake.  They were delicious and the sauces they came with were yummy.  The bibimbap was good, nothing too special.  I ordered the spicy kimchi pork stew.  The flavor was good and spicy, but I found maybe one piece of something that could have been called pork.

Things you might want to try:
Tofu Vegetable Soup, Bimbimbap, Kim Chi Fried Rice or the Oxtail Soup. Majority of the dishes comes with rice! 
The tofu vegetable soup was only $10 for a good portion. The taste and spice for it was neutral compared to some places who somehow makes it 10x spicer than ever. Bimbimbap, I could say this portion was humungous. Might want to ask for some seasoning though. A few of my friends say the taste is bland and some say it was tasty. I, myself, have always asked for whatever sauce they use for Katsu or the red paste to make my bowl even better. Kim Chi fried rice happens to be one of my favorite dishes. The spice is amazing and will leave your mouth watering for more. Add on that extra egg if you're a big egg lover like me. During the winter, its best to eat that oxtail soup! Tried it once with my boyfriend and absolutely became of the favorites as well. 

The service: 
Good service is when the servers not only ask how's your food but refill your water constantly! Yes! I don't need to wait and call for help when I'm crying from eating anything spicy.

The BBQ bulgogi was so good. It was easy to eat. It wasn't chewy. The flavor of the BBQ was great. I enjoyed it a lot. I would definitely recommend it. It's good for 2-3 people.

3420075,2011-01-27,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"While running errands on Blue Diamond Rd we decided to find a place to eat and we were craving Korean. I Yelped and we got treated to a very cool Korean barstaurant with good drinks and good food. 

Soyo was simple and cool. It reminded us of the hole in the wall eateries in Japan.There were 4 cement booths with wooden seats along the back wall. They decorated shelves above the seats with either books, Korean pottery, or empty bottles of Soju. They also had booths in the center, a private booth near the front door, and 3-4 seats at the bar. Some of the other cool decor they had was a rotary phone (for you young bucks if you don't know- Google it LOL), an antique TV, and a couple old school .25 cents games. They were playing some Korean Hip Hop music that got the kids jazzed up.

We got seated right away in a booth. And the lady gave us some tin bowls. My son picked up a bowl and looked at me dumbfounded, ""whats this for?"" Our waitress tells him its for your tea, my son replies ""I want my soda in it because I don't like tea."" Hahaha gotta love kids. But , she brings you a bottle of barley iced tea and pours it into our bowls. It was very refreshing. The menu was simple and clean. The foods were seperated in catergories, Entrees, soups, tapas, & casseroles. We love Korean and knew what we wanted to eat, but for the newbie looking at the menu- they would be lost. The menu had 3 columns of the foods, Korean name, one line name of dish in english, and price. They should add more detail in description of dishes.

We ordered:

Kim Chee and Pork Soup- It was spicy, hearty, and damn good. More pork would've been nice. I got jiigae with it LOL!

Bibimbap- my liked it but she didn't like it with the ground meat, she would've enjoyed it more with bulgoggi or kalbi meat.

Bulgogi- My son loved it. He said it was his all time fave...that raised my eyebrows, so I had to steal a bite. I agree it was very good.

Fried dumplings- stuffed with rice noodles, veg, and ground meat. 

Lychee Soju- They mix this cocktail in a soda bottle and give you a shot glass so you can pour your own. After the first shot passed through my lips...I had flash backs of eating lychee right off the trees in our backyard in Hawaii. The Lychee taste was really good and the soju was barely noticeable...it was like drinking Lychee juice. But, don't let the good taste fool you....after I finished the bottle, the feel good vibes crept up on me LOL! Next time we'll try the yogurt soju.

All these dishes were served steaming hot in stone pots. We love it like that, its a nicer presentation and it also keeps the food hot, much longer then if it was served on a plate. We got the banchan, daikon & cabbage kim chee, fishcake strips, & bean sprouts.

Overall, the service was great (she was very accommodating to our family-she knew the drill with kids which is a plus in our book), you get a good amount of food for the price, and its a cool atmosphere. Soyo is a great place for Las Vegas. We hope to see more barstaurant pop in the near future.",jR00ESlM7Rmg9tFYwMbh4A,4,2,5,jB8OCqcaSQNr7mNu78lZgw

We still had to wait with the other two and awkwardly eat our dinner while they sat around, so I believe we all should have been compensated.

Cool arcade games along side the front entrance, you can play while you wait. Parking is available pretty accessible. There are booths and picnic tables, you can sometimes choose either if you are early. Too bad I got there a minute too late and the last booth was taken. Very cozy seats, cushions available if the seat is too flat and sturdy. Our server sat us quickly but took over 10mins to return to our table to take our order. Again the restaurant was less than half full. 

I ordered the Boodaejjigae and galbi-samgyubsal (pork belly). From the time I sat down and began eating it took 35 minutes. Pretty slow considering the restaurant wasn't full. The portable butane burner the waiter put down was in bad condition and looked terribly dirty and unsanitary. Asked that to be replaced and the second was in the exact same condition. Aside from that being dirty, the plates that were already placed on the table looked used or unwashed. Had those replaced as well too. 

The side dishes used to be good, from what I remember. Looked and tasted days old and I had to shove that to the side. 

My soup was good, too small to be valued at $22. The porkbelly was over cooked I believe. Really tough to eat and very very small for $15.

My main complaint with the dish is the scarcity of meat compared to some other Korean places I've been to. The first few bites were good, but after a while it was just a carb overload since there was just mainly rice. My friends also had similar complaints with their dishes. The side dishes they gave were pretty good though!

I don't know if I would come back to this place, but if I do, I'll probably just order one of their meat based dishes and see how that goes lol. The atmosphere is pretty cool with the kpop music and dim light setting. It kind of reminds me of a hip cafe. The workers were pretty nice and attentive, but it was kind of hard to understand some of them when asking questions about the menu since they spoke limited English. Towards the end of our meal, I think the workers forgot about us when we tried to pay our bill.

I ordered the Bi Bim Bap last time I was here. It was still sizzling when it arrived in its hot stone pot and tasted great, save maybe for a little lack of salt that could easily be fixed. The portion sizes here are just perfect, and the presentation of the food at Soyo deserves an A+. The orders here come with inclusive side dishes which are a great addition to the main course. Also make sure to check out the dessert when you have the chance. The parfait I ordered was incredible: The fruits were all fresh, there was just the right amount of whip cream, and ice cream makes everything better, of course. 

The restaurant plays Korean pop music, the servers are mostly young adults, there are arcade game machines, and the walls are decorated with posters, pictures, and chalkboards, making for a trendy atmosphere that is worth coming back to. 

I absolutely love the variety of seating options here. There is both covered outdoor and indoor seating. Customers have the choice to sit in elevated booths, the bar, or regular tables, and a big party booth that overlooks the entire place. How fancy!

Finally, we were ready to order.  We had the following:

I was introduced to this restaurant by an old friend and I have been loving it ever since. They share the same parking lot with Oyshi and a few other recognizable places so parking can be a little eh. Be vicious! jk.

They have a very chill ambiance here (hope you like k-pop) and it's exactly the type of place you feel comfortable just chatting it up with friends over a delicious meal. I also love the white lights, korean manga in the booths, and ""play area"" here. You will be thankful for the tea that they serve in tin bowls instead of water if you want to eat spicy. However, just ask and they can bring you out some water.

So far, I have tried:

Kimchi Fried Rice: STOP READING AND JUST ORDER IT (jk, but it's really that good)

Fried Dumplings: Just crispy enough for some crunch on the outside, but be cautious about the inside because contents might still be hot. Definitely use the sauce that accompanies it. Yum.

Dduk Bok E with Ramen Noodles: OH GOSH IT'S SO GOOD! And so darn spicy! Haha, but I just can't get enough of it. It's a korean casserole with ramen noodles and seafood as well as some veggies. This one is definitely for sharing. 

Dolsot Bibimbap: This is something that I order to help give my mouth a break from all of the spicy foods and it is definitely delicious. White rice to be mixed with cucumbers, bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and seaweed in a warm pot. 

Soon Dubu Jjigae: This is a Spicy Tofu Soup and it was alright. Not the best I have had, but not the worst either.

Ramen: About $9 for a bowl of delicious ramen. My brother ordered this once and I wanted to steal it from him!

The only mildly ""bad"" experience I have had here was when one of the waiters had forgotten to put in our orders twice, but he was so apologetic that we couldn't even hold it against him :) the servers here are very sweet.

I've been trying to sample a few more dishes - all of them have been great so far. I've had omelette rice (omu-rice) and had spam added to it (that's how my momma makes it!). We also tried the cheese corn which was delicious as well.

I also tried one of the ""casseroles"" - the name escapes me for the most part but it was basically like a kimchi flavored stew with ramen noodles, spam, sausage, and a few other things. This one would need to be shared by at least two people.

Last but not least, I tried their Galbi-tang which was really tasty though had less meat than I'd probably like. But typically Galbi-tang is quite expensive because of how long it takes to cook, but this one was just $15 and really did hit the spot for flavor.

The same knocks apply - service here is not the best. They definitely try their best best but they still have problems keeping up when it is busy. Also, my friend gets the same thing every time - bibimbap with extra vegetables, and usually they charge $3 for the extra vegetables and this time it sad $5, which they did fix for us but was still a bit of a hassle that shouldn't happen.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,0,1,4,IGMe_8cpRQCUo95xHlx-Ow

My first and last time  here believe it or not was when  Tien N. and Anthony T. were leaving for Afghanistan, and this was my first review for the Yelp 365 Challenge BACK IN 2011...Can't believe it was that long ago!

After a Yelp Fit Club event, we hit up  Soyo for some post workout fuel. I got #27(no, I an't gonna butcher the name!) I also wanted to try their Kim Chee Fried Rice with Egg and wifey got the Mixed Seafood Sundubu with no spice. 

Didn't care for their Kim Chee Fried Rice with the egg on top which was overcooked. 
I'm not that big on Sundubu, but I thought it tasted pretty good. The endless banchan were delicious, and my cold noodles hit the spot. The heat had me in the sniffles, and I ended up killing a whole bottle of the Barley Tea, but I kept eating...It was that good!

Good food, even greater company, that's what its all about....ALOHA!!!

2. complimentary iced water/tea served in tin bowls.

4. HOUSE SOJU! peach soju! lychee soju! yogurt soju! soju soju soju!
5. tons of beer on tap
6. authentic feel-good korean food
7. wonderful service !

I can imagine this place getting pretty crowded with youngsters on a weekend, but it was relatively easy going at 11pm on a Friday night... maybe its cause its off the strip or just that weekend, but if this place was in LA... this place would be packed! They were relatively low staffed but we were tended to very well. Ordered the seafood pancake (tapa/appetizer), kimchi fried rice, and porkbelly/squid special. The seafood pancake was nothing close to tapa sized... but that was fine with us!; kimchi fried rice was nothing special; porkbelly/squid was solid and enough to feed 3-4 people! Portions were huge! Should of known better than to order so much food at a korean establish, had to take food home  - which they nicely packed up for us - and it still tasted great heated up the next day!

Overall, it was a stellar experience. Soyo provides a trendy fun atmosphere, perfect late night dinner, and plenty of soju for a fun time with a good group of friends!",RugiruRsLxooWa5aE5Z5lg,3,1,5,nxTjms_50iQyBEcqQ7B-Rg

Soyo is my sidebae because oftentimes my bf and I go line by line down our yelp bookmarks and can't agree to what place to eat at, but SOMEHOWWW Soyo ends up being the backup we can fistbump with agreement on and it never fails.

PORK BELLY ($15) - yuMMO i'd say it's a widdo pricey for the portion considering $15 can get you AYCE pork belly elsewhere, but it was cooked perfectly and the included salad combated the pork fat well. Me like.

GALBI TANG ($12) - AHH, just the soup my clogged nose needed! It's a comforting, clear broth rather than the bright red spicy soondoobu broth, no spice at all. Clear noodles, chunks of boiled beef ribs and green onions swam in the bountiful bowl. Like I said, it's very comforting and simple so don't expect to jizz in your pants via flavor explosion. 10/10 would eat when im feeling sick again.

SOONDOOBU ($9) - consistently delivers. Korean soup for the seoul!! (heh...he...see what i did there?)

A meal for 2 could probably run you around $30...not bad! The greatest convenience is THEY'RE OPEN LATE!! Forget steak and eggs, ILL CHOOSE SOYO FOR DRUNCHIES ANY DAY!!!

So come here and enjoy the atmosphere. Come here if you can't afford a ticket to Seoul. Sip on some korean soup and revel in the beauty of how smooth the waitresses faces look (without being creepy of course - i just wanna know what their Korean skincare routine is).",16A22OSpylVKhl-oJVXneQ,0,1,4,gb47DSKELiFEgHKrO99RNA

Finally! Everyone on Yelp has been raving about this place, and I just had to see it for myself. The place is small, but I love that it is very cozy and tiny. The interior was just absolutely darling. From the cute little benches and booths with seating pads to the fun white lights that wrap around the fun and artistic chalkboard. 

Barley Tea in a tin bowl! That's the way to do it. None of the small plastic water cups here (you know what I'm talking about). It was such a flavorful tea, and you can tell they didn't over infuse the tea as well. We had the spicy soft tofu seafood soup. It was to die for! Just the right spice and tang, and with all the great seafood treasures in that bowl, you can taste that seafood taste it has.

Samgyupsal - came pre seasoned with the salt sesame oil with a slight crisp that would resemble having a thick cut bacon slice. Salad was paired with this dish to counter the oily factor to this dish. 

Bibim naengmyun- a good spicy kick to your palate and you bite into the buckwheat noodles with s shred of beef to top it. 

Final analysis. I recommend the samgyupsal and the kalbi.

I've never been to Korea so what I'm about to say makes no sense. 
 
Soyo makes me feel Korean the moment I walk in. I've always wanted to be Korean so it's like a dream come true. I'm partially joking... I went through high school listening to K-pop so the fact they play nothing but K-pop is enough of a reason for me to come back time and time again. 

Lucky for me, their food is fantastic also. They serve all the typical Korean dishes that most of  us are familiar with and some + American favorites such as french fries and chicken wings.

Dduk Bokki( spicy rice cakes)

3969907,2014-06-22,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"My experience with Soyo was disappointing.  I ordered two items from the tapas section of the menu--chicken gizzards with garlic and onion and son doo boo.  The chicken gizzards were good, chewy but that's the nature of the meat.  The son doo boo is supposed to be in beef broth.  The water the two pieces of tofu rested in shouldn't be referred to as broth.  Broth connotes some type of meat/fish flavor.  This had none.  It was merely a watery dish with a side of hot dipping sauce.

It was the wrong day to go to Soyo.  The place is very small.  The tables are such that it's not a good place for a person eating alone.  I was there a little after 5:30 and there were only a few people in the restaurant.  Within a very short time, young people getting dinner before going to EDC came in and I was taking up a table that could seat four or even six.  There was an error with my order and rather than have them bring the correct item ordered, I hurriedly finished and paid the bill so someone else could have the table.

Since I am not a big drinker, I just partook in the food!  Our group ordered oden (fish cake soup), thinly sliced beef with leeks (?), chicken gizzard, korean style fried chicken, and budae jigae (army base stew).

Everything tasted great!  The sliced beef was stir fried with garlic and eaten with a leek salad.  The chicken gizzards were crunchy, not really my cup of tea though.  The fried chicken had super crispy skin and dipped in a sweet sauce.  The best thing about the chicken however, was the side of sweet, pickled radish that came with it: crisp, tart, sweet, and crunchy.  The budae jigae was spicey and contained a mish mash of ramen, hot dog, sausage, vegetables.  Supposidly, this dish was created by soldiers, who put whatever they had into the stew.  Everything was very warming and filling, especially the stew, perfect for one of the coldest nights in Vegas.

Service was good, all you can drink pitchers of barley tea were brought to the table.  The biggest surprise was the bill.  For nine people, the total came out to be $100.  I found it to be a great bargain for great korean comfort food.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,4,4,4,sulBfyZDM1V-FbsoamA4sA

4017605,2011-04-10,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Took a much anticipated trip into Soyo for date night with my hubby. 

We were instructed to sit wherever we liked so we chose a nice private booth. It's a pretty small place. I think there's only about 12 tables. The atmosphere and decor are very cool. Much better than expected from the average Korean place. 

The service was excellent throughout but slow considering we were 1 of 3 total tables. Guess that's just how they operate. Pretty laid back. 

We were greeted with complimentary rice water/iced tea concoction. Not my ""cup of tea"" but my husband loved it. We started with lychee soju. It was pure ecstasy! They even chill all the glasses/tin drinking vessels. The flavored soju is $12 for an approx. 20 oz. bottle. The lychee is magical. We also had the pear. This may have been better of we didn't have the lychee first. The pear soju had too strong of an alcohol taste and was gritty with pear pulp. No thank you. 

After great debate, we decided on the kimchi fried rice, Korean BBQ short ribs (aka kalbi), and the mixed seafood pancake. Furthermore, we received all of the complimentary Korean apps. They served radishes, potatoes, kimchi, fish cakes, and a mysterious crunchy rice noodle in a creamy yogurt/mayo sauce. No pickled cucumbers!! Boo! My favorite. The kimchi fried rice was excellent! It was spicy, flavorful, and topped with an overhard egg. I, of course, would have preferred an over medium egg. The kalbi was ok. It was cut too thick. Very chewy and difficult to eat. The flavor was good though! The blackened onions and cabbage underneath coated in beef drippings was the best part. The pancake was crispy on the outside and slightly gooey on the inside. It was served HOT! Which I like. It came with a very tasty mystery sauce. The menu lists items as ""Korean tapas"" but they are portioned for 3-4 people. We only ordered 3 items and we were spent!! We even packed some to take home. 

Total bill for 2 bottles of soju and 3 items was $62...$74 with tip. 

I would highly recommend drinking at this place and killing some snackage while you are at it. However, it won't be the best Korean food you've had.",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,0,1,4,LfhyWBN_0L9kdi57g5B-zw

Only complaint is that the trash bin's lid is one of those door with bit of restriction, so it'll need an extra push to dump your trash in there.  I usually like an open trash can next to the door after a hand wash, so i can dump my paper towel in there when handling a door knob.

They took us in even though it was at 2:30am just before closing.  Dick move on us, but we were in the mood for some Spicy Ramen. This time I notice the broth has more of that hot dog taste than i wanted since i was burping it all night. Still good though.  My buddy ordered the Kalbi Jjim; germonstrous size beef ribs in a sweet soy base soup, finished with fried stripped eggs, carrots, sesame seed, green onions, and i think seaweed.

The service is a few of the overflow employees from Oyshi which i have always received great service so no complaints there. The Soju was tasty and decent portions for the money at $12 per order and feeding 7 i think we managed almost 2 shots per order for everybody which was  a nice surprise. The different flavors was excellent but i think the lychee was the favorite among my group. The food was pretty solid for more like bar style food rather than a full on meal. The soups were tasty and served in generous portion, the Korean style pancake was very tasty as well, but my favorite without doubt was the chili/honey wings... coated in a thick honey and chili paste that i could have put on my napkin and eaten.

4092754,2011-09-24,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Husband and I made it over last Sunday and loved it.  Couldn't get over how developed that part of town is!    Definitely think this is the sharpest, most interesting place in that area...

Inside, they've done a  nice job of tricking up the interior to make it feel less strip mall.  I loved the atmosphere although the booths weren't very comfortable nor were they sound buffered - we could hear every word of the conversations around us...

I'd made a short list of items (okay, it was too long) that I wanted to make sure we tried...

We started with the mandu - needed some seasoning but that's what dippping sauce is for -- the filling and portion size was generous.  I'm a sucker for dumplings and love how every culture has one - and I love em all.  

We had the buckwheat noodle soup - it will be coming off the menu as soon as temperatures come down and I've been telling my husband about this dish from EJo... I was thrilled to see it on Soyo's menu.  I had him taste it before adding the vinegar/mustard - he pronounced it flat...I swirled in the magic ingredients and this time his eyes sparkled - it's his kind of dish --  light, bright, surprising, complex but simple.  I loved their version.

We had their KFC (actually the spicy garlic wings) - these were sticky, ooey, gooey delicious - and I normally am not a wing fan...but I thought these were yummy.

We also tried their rice wine - it comes in a bowl with a ladle...and it's addictive.  Light alcohol content, cold, sweet, a little sparkly, think unfiltered sake spritzer or new wine.  Delicious.  (And enough for two to share...or not)

I didn't realize how wonderful Hite beer is until Sunday either -- it's got a touch of sweetness-- perfect for spicy Korean food.  I think Hite is probably my favorite beer right now...

We also tried their kimchee pancake.  Great, but could have been crispier, downright soggy in the middle...but we ate it all with relish.  Sort of hard to complain about when you've pretty much licked the plate clean.

All in all, it was a great first experience...we probably should have tried their bulgogi, but we'll do that the next time - because we will definitely go back.",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,0,0,4,jehLsfQYPPJFshETGeYaxA

4107048,2015-08-24,7,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I feel that I'm often the last one to try a lot of popular restaurants in Vegas, and I'm glad that I've finally checked this one off my list.

Soyo is a Korean restaurant in Southwest Las Vegas. I had trouble seeing the name on the facade at first, but it's on the southern corner of a building that it shares with a few other businesses, perhaps most notably Oyshi Sushi. Not many people were utilizing the outside seating area, which is expected in the summer. I didn't actually find out where the ""bar"" of the ""barstaurant"" is, but I'm sure it has to exist.

Anyway, the main indoor dining area has a pleasant ambiance. It has an interesting feel with the concrete flooring, largely pale wooden walls, bookshelves, and rather dated appliances including a television set and some arcade games. There are some rather charming booths that are elevated slightly above the ground, but our large group took up a table or two on the floor. The largely K-pop music wasn't stifling in loudness, but it's noticeable during conversation. I really liked the cushions that they provide because it never came to mind even once during the meal that I was sitting on a wooden bench.

You'll definitely want to drink something here, even if it's non-alcoholic. The complimentary barley tea is my favorite rendition of this drink so far. The barley flavor is cleaner than what most places serve, but it doesn't taste watered down. I probably could have finished the entire pitcher by myself. By the way, they didn't serve it in bowls, which I'm sure would have been awkward.

I also had a couple shots of the yuzu soju. It's not very alcohol-heavy, but it's sweet and clear with a wonderful yuzu flavor. If you haven't enjoyed this particular type of citrus before, this is as good a chance as any.

The food was good overall. The Japchae ($10) with bulgogi (+$2) was really delicious. Really smooth noodles with egg, beef, and thinly sliced veggies. I would order it again. The soondubu ($8) with my choice of seafood is a bargain compared to most other places and tastes delicious even without the egg, which is either an add-on or was misplaced somewhere by the wait staff. Loved the broth, which came out mild per my request, as well as the silky tofu and the various seafood bits (shrimp, mussel, clams, octopus). It's my favorite soondubu in Vegas so far.

The LA-style galbi ($15) was good too, but I typically prefer a sweeter marinade on the meat. There may also be some small inconsistencies with the cooking temperature due to wide variations in how they cut apart the meat, not that the texture was at all tough or that I've gotten sick or anything. I kinda wish that I'd opted for the seemingly popular garlic chicken wings now instead, but at least there's always next time.

The complimentary banchan (side dishes) were a bit of a mixed bag. I really liked the kimchi and I enjoyed the broccoli, but I disliked the surprising crunch of one of the items that looked to me like sliced skin-on tofu. Also, the crunchy chunks of some juicy radish-like root vegetable seemed atypical and out of place, and nobody ever asked if we wanted seconds.

I also managed to sample a few other items from around the table. The seafood pancake (haemul pajeon, or however they anglicized it here) was delicious, with prominent octopus pieces in at least my chunk of the pancake. The dduk bok e (from the first page of the menu) tasted pretty good and wasn't too spicy for me, but I'm just not a fan of the rice dumplings. I'd describe their texture as a ""mushy"" chewy, which I'm sure is intentional but just isn't my favorite thing to have in my mouth. I also enjoyed a sample of the beef from what appeared to be a bulgogi with dressed chopped lettuce.

I'd love to return to Soyo to try more of their dishes. There's not much competition in terms of Korean food in this particular part of town, but they're doing a great job regardless.

(UPDATE 1/8/16: I'm not ready to add the 5th star quite yet, but some dishes that I tried for the first time included included fantastic corn cheese, delicious kalbi sam gyup sal, good bo saam, and a a nice spicy soup that I think was boo dae jji gae. I also enjoyed the laa bok e, which is like the dduk bok e but with instant ramen noodles instead of the sticky rice cake. Also, the beef chive salad was good again, and the LA galbi seemed to be sweeter and therefore tastier than last time.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,8,4,QyKd0mOt9qwgOZ8rft2pLQ

BUTTTTTT I will sit there and sniffle all night long because beyond the spice is an amazing authentic Korean taste. I normally get one of their noodle dishes - it has spicy rice cake, ramen, fish cake, egg, and I like to add tofu for a little added protein in there. I love love love the flavor. It has a sweet and spicy taste to it, and the rice cake it perfectly chewy.

I also got one of their soups, and while it was a little too spicy, I like that they give you more broth.. So I have my friends take the first round of soup and I dig in once they bring more broth so it's less spicy.

The Kim Chee fried rice was a disappointment- too mushy and not to much flavor - the kim chee taste was there but maybe a dash of salt n pepper would've done the trick. Nice presentation though...

The Dumplings were yummers as well - lightly fried good sized circle shaped dumplings filled with tasty chop chae (clear noodles,finely chopped carrots, onions,and I think spinach)
All the Ban Chan were good especially the sesame seed flavored veggies.

I wish we could pick all the Ban Chan before it comes cause I always feel obligated to eat them or pack it up to go so that nothing is wasted even though I may not like the taste of that particular Ban Chan.

The complimentary Iced Barley tea was a nice touch but after tasting it we opted for water with lemon. Sorry the taste isn't for everybody....

I work in the restaurant industry and I know what service is. I've been going to this place because I live near here and it was convenient. I have placed togo orders, ate here with friends and family, and brought new customers as well. Whenever new people would ask where to go, I would recommend here for people who lived on this side. However recently I was thoroughly disappointed. 
It was a 1:51 am on Sunday, which also happened to be daylight savings (March 11, 2018). Since I work in the restaurant industry and didn't want to be rude. I called before I went in because even through their closing time is listed as 4am on Saturday night (which is technically Sunday) since they're a local restaurant, they might close sooner. They said they will close in 10 minutes. So I placed an order of kimchi pancakes. Mind you that it was raining that day and I desperately wanted to drink Makkuli. Something Koreans do as a custom when it's raining. It's like drinking a nice cold beer on a sunny day. Anyway, I go in and I see several tables there. I asked if I could buy two makkuli and take it home. They say it's illegal. However, no liquor store was open that carried Makkuli. So I thought maybe I can open the bottles and drink a sip from each and take it home. They answer with a no. Then as my last question, I ask if I can take Makkuli in a different bottle. They say no. I then asked if I can just eat here and drink Makkuli (which was my intention if they weren't closing in ten minutes). They say they're closing in 10 minutes. Also mind you that a single man had come in while I'm waiting and ordered soju to drink at the bar. 
I am a regular. I don't come in every week but for sure once in two months at least and have been for at least 5 years. 
I understand if taking Makkuli is illegal since they might not have the license for it but saying you will close soon and not even have customer service to a regular is impolite especially when I am not asking to be your last customer there. There were at least 5 tables and a single man at the bar. 
Oh and I don't know what kimchi pancake is like at SOYO since it was my first time ordering it here but they gave me one pancake which was burnt on the edges for $10.

When I talked to the waitress they told me it's normal, they don't give us a lot of noodle and beef, OK, I'm totally fine they do this, but if that's the case, why are they posting inaccurate picture on there tricking people into thinking they are getting a generous portion?

The place is very clean and inviting to new patrons, there were small and intimate 'nooks' that we would have preferred to have been seated, but nevertheless, the entire open dining area itself wasn't bad either. Having no idea what their menu was like, we asked our friendly server what she recommends instead of guessing ourselves. We are not new to Korean Food dining, but Soyo offers a different take on traditional Korean BBQ, making things whimsical/modern right down to the way food/drinks was presented (rustic tin canisters in lieu of drinking glasses/tea cup for example). For dinner, our party of three ordered the recommended Chicken Wings In Garlic Sauce, Hot & Spicy Vegetables & Shredded Beef Soup and Bibimbap. The chicken wings, for me, was what stood out the most, the chicken was cooked perfectly: tender and juicy in the inside, crunchy on the outside enhanced by the savory garlic-honey glaze. And oh yeah, grab a lot of napkins for this round folks, because things are going to get real messy (in a good way)! The hot and tender beef soup and colorful bibimbap are more traditional in taste and presentation, and that's also a good thing.

We came here on New Year's after the UFC fight so it was around 10pm? Inside the place looked cool, with the old school tv and what not, the benches are a lil uncomfortable but they provide you with pillows to sit your bum on. 
We were served our doggy dishes for the tea right away, but it took another 20-25 minutes for the server to come back and even take our order. The place wasn't packed and it seemed like everyone there was just ""hanging"" out. Well when we finally got to order the server told me that they didn't have my oxtail noodle soup....so I ordered this short rib soup.  The food came out probably about 10-15 minutes later which is about average I think. My ""soup"" was good. The meat was tender for the most part, but there were no noodles. I really wanted something with noodles and the server said this was what replaced the oxtail noodle soup. The rest of my friends enjoyed their meal for the most part. 
Maybe I was just there at the wrong time and didn't order the right thing, but I was not impressed. 
Service really was terrible and I think that ruined the whole Soyo experience for me. I'm a huge sucker for service and when there is no service or lack of service I become this mad woman. When our check came, the server had given us the wrong one. The one she gave us was for an amount WAY cheaper with a discount (about 10-15%) on it, luckily for her I went up to her and said that it was the wrong check. She printed the right check and there was no discount. I wonder how one gets such an awesome discount. In any case for 6 of us, the bill came out to be around 85 something bucks plus tip...which was about right for 5 entrees and 3 soju bombs.

SERVICE- My friend and I were total noobs but the servers were more than helpful and friendly, it was just a little awkward at first because once we sat down they gave us a small pitcher of barley tea with these two cup/bowl looking things with no explanation (they serve this over water btw) we weren't sure whether to drink from the bowls or if it's for scraps lol. 
FOOD- so much great options from Galbi, to stews and ramen :) we tried the KOONG NAA MOOL GYUP SAAL - it seems like a popular choice and it was delish! It was pork belly with squid that's in their sweet chili-issh broth, they bring out a portable stove/burner for it to cook all the way and stay warm , definitely adding to the dining experience , plus it was very flavorful! It comes with rice and typical banchan sides. We also tried their flat dumplings which people rave about but it was okay for me, maybe I was expecting it to be out of this world but it'll do :)

:: Popular seafood casserole (really like a hot pot) was huge! There was also a lot of good seafood in there like mussels, prawns, octopus, and salmon. We saw some couples who just ordered that to share.  
:: Bulgogi, which was served in in a stone pot with a sweet and salty broth. Definitely needs to be eaten with rice. 
:: Dol sot (hot stone) bi bim bap was good, nothing to complain about, except it would've been nice for it to come with a fried egg.
:: Steamed egg (off menu for $5), which was a mistake as it came out overcooked. It may have been because they don't usually make this dish. They probably forgot about it and left it cooking for too long. It was quite dry and almost green when it was finally served.

We showed up on a Monday night to this cozy and dimly lit place. There was a wait to be seated inside, but they offered up the patio. We were hungry so we chose the patio, which had heaters and plastic flaps. Even with all of that, the January weather had us keeping our warm coats on. 

They sat us down with menus, a plastic bottle of liquid, and three small metal bowls. We were a little unsure of the metal bowls. I kept looking slyly to other tables to see if we were supposed to drink out of them. I had a brief moment of thinking that the entire restaurant would start snickering at how I was drinking out of the bowl that you are really supposed to wash your hands in or something. When the waitress came back, we asked about them and she offered us real glasses if we wanted. So everyone else we saw at other tables had opted for real glasses, which is why we thought the bowls were for something else. But we decided to drink the bottled tea out of the little round metal bowls for an authentic experience.

Part of the reason why we had decided on Korean food was because I had explained what bimbibap was. So of course we ordered bimbibap and it was delicious and it warmed me up on that cold patio. My brother also ordered a dish that was basically chicken wings as I actually do not remember the name for it. The sauce was perfectly saucy with a touch of spice.

It's nice to have a restaurant here that isn't KBBQ but again I wouldn't choose to come here whenever I feel hungry or in the neighborhood.  The portions, the saltiness, is all off :P  Yeah it's dope they have a lil arcade cabinet thingy but that's probably the best part and not the food or service.

You'll find the majority of the patrons here are young, and korean or like weaboo types.  Find another spot more Mom and Pop that would cater more to service and better recipes for a better price.",NJxfyWtbOi9WDxAvfgqLIg,2,2,3,PTsYoko4xSlxYQtAATtS_Q
4263375,2018-02-14,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I have had this spot bookmarked for awhile. I have been here twice in four nights for dinner. Both times were enjoyable and I have found my new favorite restaurant, just in time to celebrate the PyeongChang Winter Olympics!

On Saturday night, I met my newlywed friends for dinner at 6pm. I took Yelpers' advice and made reservations, which I was glad we did. We were able to snag a booth and it started to get busy after we got seated. Immediately, as we sat down, we were given ice cold barley tea, which was refreshing. We ordered 1/2 and 1/2 order of fried chicken wings, 3 Yang Nyum (Korean-style wings with a zesty sauce) and 3 Ma Nuel (with garlic-flavored sauce),  Bi Bim Baap, soups, Sul Lung Tang (milky soup with ox tail, beef slices, and noodles), and Beef Soon Doo Boo Jji Gae (tofu soups, asked for no spice) and Nap Jaak Man Doo (handmade flat dumplings with ground beef & pork, clear noodles and vegetables). Soon after ordering, we received ban chan: kim chee, potato salad, radish kim chee, and seasoned broccoli. Pretty standard fare, nothing special. The favorites were the chicken wings. They were so good, we ordered another set of wings. Paul, who ordered the ox tail soup, complained that his soup was plain with zero ox tail. This was the only complaint of our meal. I was very happy with my tofu soup. While it wasn't the best I've had, it was tasty, all hot and bubbling, with a raw egg dropped in the boiling soup. Ana her bi bim baap was good, but nothing spectacular. The service was a bit inattentive and slow at times, but they did come and refill the ban chan and barley tea when asked. Overall, we did have a good time.

Last night, I took my parents for our Mardi Gras dinner. Again, I made reservations. This is the way to go here to ensure you get one of the 5 booths. My dad got the korean bbq, LA Kal Bi, beef short ribs. I got the 1/2 1/2 of the chicken wings and the Man Doo dumplings again. My mom wanted soup because she wasn't feeling well, a shredded beef soup. This time around, everyone loved their entrees. The ban chan was kim chee, radish kim chee, beans, seaweed, and cellophane noodles. My dad loved the radishes that accompanied the chicken wings. The vinegary taste really complemented the flavors of the wings. My mom said her soup really ""hit the spot"" and made her feel better. Again, the service was spotty and you had to call someone over if you needed something, instead of them coming over the check on you. This is why I am giving 4 stars, instead of 5. 

I look forward to my next visit to this fine, Korean, establishment in my area. I am glad I don't have to go all the way to Spring Mountain for great Korean food.",1N4z5Okxbl9Bz6Min-ZYTQ,0,0,4,TUVNrE6dRxbWBahTdmM7fA

Ok, after the good reviews on yelp I definitely wanted to check this place out.  I love the interior design, and its location.  Once we entered, the people greeted us and sat us quickly.  (Something I definitely love, the quicker I get to eat....the better.)  The server gave us 2 bowls and iced tea I suppose?  I didn't know what to do with it, so I just poured it into the bowl and drank it.  My mother and I just looked at each other and then thought we used this to wash our hands.  (LOL, but that didn't make any sense since it had ice)  

After looking at the menu, I didn't know what to order.  I guess I'm a visual eater than a reader.  I wish they had specialties recommended or something, cause I was totally lost!

I ordered:

Kimchi Fried Rice - It was ok.  I think I like ichiza's better because it actually comes with kimchi.  I think the rice was little too sticky, and a little too spicy.  The egg was refreshing though, but overall I thought it was OK.

Corn with Mozerella Cheese - It was good.  I thought the sauce that was mixed with the cheese while being served on a hot pot was pretty genius.  I did wish the serving was little bigger since I was paying like $5.00 for it.  

Garlic Squid - This dish was very good, although I got more garlic than I did squid.  I kind of felt jipped a little, and with that price I was expecting a little more than just garlic.

Green Mussel Soup - It was pretty good.  The portions were good, and the flavor of the soup was ok.  It was nothing to brag about.  They did add a lot of mussels and what not.  

I thought this place was an OK spot.  The thought of Korean tapas is genius, but they were pretty greedy with their portions. (Maybe something they could improve?)  Even the veggies they serve as side items were small.  It looked like someone took one scoop and just served it.  I might return cause the service was good, but I don't know about the prices.  I paid almost $40 just for those dishes alone.  I felt like I could've gotten more out of it than I should.",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,2,2,3,1Y7-mP9pZRt9Hts0rV6RUA

I came here with a few friends in the late evening (~10:30-11pm) and got a few dishes to share. Everything we got was amazing. It was flavorful without being over seasoned/over-salted. We got the bossam, bulgogi in soup, korean fried chicken, korean pancake, and rice cakes w/ ramen. My favorite has to be the bossam. It's the best bossam I've had in Las Vegas so far, and I've been having dreams of it for at least the past 3 days. The ssamjang, garlic, kimchi, and mini shrimps really complimented the pork well without overpowering the pork. It was a match-made in heaven, and I feel like I'm fiending to get back here to eat it. 

The Korean pancake was crisp on the edges and soft on the inside. It was everything that you could ask for in a toasty pancake, and portion sizing was so generous. It's something you definitely have to share with a few people.

The fried chicken was great in my opinion, but then again, I loved the sauce. I just couldn't get enough of it. The chicken is smothered in the sauce, so if you don't like a super saucy wing, then you might not have a good time with this one. If you're like me and like sauce though, then you'll probably die happy after these wings. You can taste some subtle garlic flavor underneath its tangy, sweet crunch. 

The rice cakes were cooked to perfection. It wasn't overcooked internally and it was chewy without being sticky. The sauce wasn't too sweet which was great. I've had some overly sweet ddeokbokki sauce and it just completely ruined the dish, but not this one. There's a pack of ramen cooked right into it with some carrot & cabbage shreds. Oh so satisfying and delicious!

On the slight downside, the service was kind of slow. There were probably 5 tables there and about 3 employees working. Even then, the food came out pretty slow and it took a while for the waiters to come by to refill waters/etc. 

Overall, the food is great to a point that I'm using every excuse I can to get my friends to come back with me. With so many great options and generous dishes, you definitely should come with a few people and share.

Korean food cuisine is one of my top favorites that I crave, that I've learned to make a few dishes at home (bibimbap, kimchi jjigae & bibimgooksu) But the times I don't want to cook, I drive up the block and over to Soyo. They have DELICIOUS lychee soju that I can't get at home and yummy little sides of banchan (with refills at request).

FOOD
Kimchi jjigae - Spicy and filled with lots of kimchi, the amount of anchovy, kimchi, garlic & gochujang hot pepper paste is perfect. It goes amazingly well with the complimentary barley tea and the portion size along with the banchan and rice is super filing. 

Kalbi soup - Nonspicy, but comes with a good amount of beef and vegetables. The broth is a little on the bland side, but adding in extra dippings and hot sauce really makes the broth's flavor enhanced. It tastes fresh too, but I think the Kimchi jjigae is more to my liking.

Lychee soju - Perfect perfect perfect amounts of soju, soda & lychee yogurt! The size and presentation of the soju in a glass bottle is charming and enough to make 2-4 people satisfied. Not pass out drunk, but happy =) 

Maa Neul (Tongdak) garlic-chili marinated Chicken Wings - MUST GET MUST GET! After drinking at Oyshi and then at Soyo, we very much enjoyed this greasy, crispy, garlic chili marinated chicken wings. They have lots of meat on them and the serving is I believe 6-8 pieces. 

Duk bokki - Large portion of rice cakes, spicier than I expected it to be, so we brought it home and ate it with more rice the next day. Had a soft boiled egg on top and fishcakes. The soft boiled egg was the piece de resistance. Next time I think I'll order an extra boiled egg. Really good!

Bi Bim Gook Soo - Cold noodles in spicy sauce with thinly sliced cucumbers, other veggies and I think it had a soft-boiled egg. Anyway, one of my favorite dishes and something about cold noodle dishes are just refreshing. Must try. And the price is satisfying for the portion.

Overall, my meal was great The service was attentive and they made sure the tables were clean and void of any empty dishes. They refilled a couple banchan that I requested and promptly.

Each booth has walls that go all the way up creating privacy and a sense if intimacy.  The servers are friendly, helpful, and clean.  Korean pop music and a little Korean rap provide additional cultural ambiance.  Popcorn tea is served before you order.  Its a little weird, but definitely reminds me of popcorn.  Various side dishes come out with every meal.  A lot of pickled stuff.  The only one I can name is kimchi.  My girlfriend loves the hot kimchi soup.  I'm starting to like it too.  I like to pour it over rice.  By the way, they never seem to give me enough rice.  My favorite entree here is the galbi.  Probably because it is closest to stuff I normally eat.  It is BBQ ribs sliced very thin and served on grilled vegetables on a hot skillet.  The bulgogi is also pretty good.  Thin sliced meat served in a soup.  We ordered the fried calamari once.  It was pretty good, but had a lot of garlic.  Once we tried Korean style sushi.  It was okay.  Another time we tried a seafood soup.  It sounded so good.  It had all sorts of seafood.  However, the meat was too hard to get to.  It was really messy so I gave up.  I was really disappointed.  The plates, bowls, and eating utensils are all very stylish.

The food here is great!  Korean food is communal.  The dishes at Soyo are big enough for large parties and everything tastes great. Some of my favorites include:

Yang nyum chicken aka KFC!  Mmm it really is finger lickin' good.  The chicken is sweet, a little spicy, garlicky, and double fried to perfection!  

Budae jjigae: the army base stew is pretty much ramen on steroids.  A big pot of spicy ramen with spam, vienna sausage, the chewy rice cake stick, vegetables.  It's perfect during the cold, winter nights and it's large enough to share with 6-8 people.  You can also ask for extra noodles!

Everything else that I've tried here is good!  I love that the portions are big enough to share so that you can try all Soyo has to offer.  They offer flavored soju!  Very good and verrry addicting!

Food 5/5 -- I am a fan of Korean cuisine and have tried many of the dishes as Soyo. I love them all! They are all well-cooked and delicious. My favorite dish is the L.A. gaalbi. I recommend this dish for first-time Korean food eaters as this is a very safe yet delicious choice if you have not tried any of the more unique dishes. 

I also ordered the cheese corn for the first time last visit. A must if you're a fan of both corn and mozzarella cheese. When they brought it out, the presentation reminded me of a pizza and I wasn't sure what to expect but it was surprisingly pleasing.

The side dishes are also always yummy... Love the radishes & potatoes when they're available. They switch it around every time I visit. 

I love the barley tea they start you out with -- it is very refreshing. I think it's very cute how how they give you bowl-like cups to drink it out of. Our server recommended us Hite for the beer and that was also a very light yet refreshing alcoholic beverage that  went hand in hand with our dishes. 

Service 5/5 -- I have nothing to complain about in terms of service. They're very quick to change the small side dishes to new ones as well as refilling the tea. Awesome job on staying top of this!

Overall, my go-to local Korean joint!",os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,5,6,5,Ts2kpUIvYJ9W_BPlBJl7nA

The decor is a welcoming reminder of home for those that from the old country. With that said there were good things and not so good things about the food.

The pork wasnt cooked as long as i wouldve liked, the meat didnt fall off the bone and the meat had a weird flavor.

Nothing really stands out, but it's convenient Korean food without having to trek out to Spring Mountain and the decor is kinda cute. After this last visit I will not go back again.  

I was craving seafood pancake that night and we got one as an appetizer. It was drenched in grease and not crispy at all, though flavor was decent. My husband got some kind of spicy tofu soup which he rated ""very mediocre"". I was definitely not wanting something spicy that night and went with the innocent looking number 12, listed as ""tofu and assorted vegetables boiled in anchovy stock with fermented soybean paste"". It didn't have a pepper after the menu item to indicate spiciness, so I thought I was pretty safe.  The soup came and I saw floating specks of red chili pepper, a bad sign. The first sip confirmed my suspicions, the soup was most definitely very spicy, not just a little spicy. 

When I complained to the waitress that I felt mislead by the menu, all I got was an apologetic ""yeah sorry, it's supposed to be spicy"". Really? Complained to another waitress and she at least went to ask the manager, whose answer was ""the soybean paste has chili pepper in it"". They offered to ""take out"" the chili pepper in the soup. 5 minutes later, the soup came back warmer and looking almost exactly the same as before, and tasting just as spicy. I gave up at that point and decided to just eat rice and the few non spicy banchans on the table.  

In an effort to not totally waste food, I fished out and ate the 5 pieces of tofu that were in the soup (yeah I counted). The other assorted ""vegetables"" included a few tiny pieces of zucchini, a whole lot of mushy leftover banchan pickled radishes, and guess what, some jalapeno pepper pieces (I guess they count as vegetables)...Aside from the overwhelming spiciness, the soup was totally flat and bleh. The whole experience left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I'm swearing off Soyo for good.",ZKwO9lkpAnOnQlBL1fXf1w,1,0,1,W7ZH2zYq55gO2Du4BD1n7Q

I like Soyo mostly because of their atmosphere. It's decor would attract a younger crowd and has a welcoming bar/restaurant feel to it which makes it unique to the average Korean restaurant you find in Las Vegas.

I've tried a couple of their dishes and I enjoy their Yuk-gae-jang (spicy beef stew). A lot of my non-Korean friends absolutely love this restaurant. They usually order the bibimbap or the LA style kalbi.

The banchan is pretty tasty and I like that they serve you chilled Bori Cha (Korean Barley tea) and leave your table with a large pitcher. The servers have always been friendly and the food never takes too long to come out.

4451618,2012-12-16,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I had to update my review based on my last experience at Soyo. Soyo is a nice spot for food and nightlife. It really is, to me, a different type of ""going out"" in Las Vegas because you can come here, drink, eat, and listen to Asian pop music. Plus the atmosphere is lively and loud. Food is pretty good, although on my last visit I wasn't terribly impressed with what I ordered. Unfortunately for me when I go to places like this my food is either hit or miss. This time, it was a miss.

For the food - we shared an order of friend dumplings, and of course, the array of appetizers. For me, the fried dumplings were the best thing I ate that night. My main meal was the short ribs in the soup with noodles and what I can only guess some sort of radish. My friends concurred to it being a radish-like vegetable. I was disappointed in the dish. It lacked depth and flavor. It was also quite boring looking. The meat was SO very sinewy I could barely eat it - but I was starving, so I did. The only GOOD meat was to be found on the bones, which I attacked and ate after I had slurped up all the noodles. I was wanting my friend's Dol sot bi bim bap.

In the future, if I return, which is questionable I think I'll stick to the bim bap and chicken wings (which we also didn't get and I wish we had!). 

As for the biggest offense during the night - our terribly poor service. I can expect slow service, but this was like a glacier moving through the Arctic slow. It didn't take long for our food to come out, but after we were done eating (and our plates had not been cleared by the way) we waited, and waited, and waited. It was pretty obvious we were done. Eventually one of my friends flagged down a server. THEN she had to flag down ANOTHER server. Two servers to get our bill. 

With all being said and done, my rating must be down-graded. Perhaps they can recover some stars in the future. It is not a bad place, just this experience left me desiring better service and better food.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,3,N8Usq-1YnCs1hQtG5xpqOQ

Environment: this spot really reminds me of Korea, when I used to go into random buildings with bars. The set up looks identical! So you are really getting the full experience of what it is like to go to a bar in Korea. The tradition is usually to drink some soju and order food and chat and have fun! This spot brings in all sorts of people who either just want to come with their family to try their delicious entrees or drink and get rowdy with their friends. They also have an outdoor area for large parties.

Service: the staff is always super friendly, super helpful and quick to service no matter how busy they are, which is most of the time. 

Food and drinks: i come here pretty frequently, and I would say most of their food options are good. My favorite is their chicken wings, which you can ask them to do half and half with the 2 different flavors. They also have good meat dishes on a hot plate, I usually get the marbles beef, a great share plate. I also really like their ramen soups with a lot of other ingredients, their cheese corn, and their japchae. They also give you side dishes which is refreshing to have as well. 
As for drinks, they have flavored beer, soju, yogurt soju and special Korean rice wine. I usually get soju and Cass.

It's a great stew to share among three of four friends. Don't worry if you can't find it on the menu. I never can either.

* Fried Rice with Smelt Egg in a Stone Pot - I can never remember the exact name of this dish, but it's absolutely delicious. After they bring it out, make sure to let it sit for a few minutes to allow the bottom to crisp up. Then mix all that goodness up with a spoon before you dig in. It's worth the extra wait. The smelt egg really adds great flavor to this rice dish.

* Chicken Wings - I don't remember the exact name of this dish either. It doesn't matter. They're insanely good. Props to Misti Y for ordering them. I wouldn't have tried them otherwise. The wings are bursting with flavor and you even get whole cloves of garlic for good and tasty measure.

* Galbi Jjim (Korean Braised Short Ribs) - This is a dish I've only had once thanks to a recommendation from Jieun L. It's a bit on the pricey side at $15, but it was incredibly good. The ribs were flavorful and extremely tender.

* Very Spicy Chicken - The level of heat on this dish has been hit and miss. In fact, I don't think I've ever had it at its legendary spiciness level, which is fine with me. In any case, this is a great choice. The mozzarella cheese isn't something you would expect in a Korean dish, but it's a stroke of genius. Delicious!

I won't continue listing dishes ad nauseam. You get the point. As Jane K mentions in her review, Soyo is simply a fantastic place to hang out. A few hours with a few friends and perhaps a few bottles of soju. Now that's what I call a killer evening.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,6,7,5,w7OPt2_KPwh-I1YRnHQloA

The noodles had good flavor but was not a memorable dish. 

The kimchi jji was probably one of my favorite options. The soup was full of flavor! I think the pork and and the vegetables gave this dish a very unique flavor! And last we ordered the dwe ji kal.

4663722,2016-02-10,46,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"SOYO -- tonight you lost 3 customers: my friend, her nephew, and ME -- and here's your chance to repair the damage. Just REPLY to this review and promise to give my friend the $11 beef salad for FREE and she'll be back along with her family and friends that she often brings in for you since she lives a few blocks away--remember how she brought the two of us with her tonight? Please show us that you care about the continued business of regular customers.

MY FRIEND'S DISH WAS VERY SLOW
My friend's dish took 25 minutes, while our 2 dishes came out within 10. Yes, you later explained that her dish always takes that long--but a WARNING would have allowed her to order something else instead of the beef salad.

SLOW DISH WAS CANCELED
My friend watched us eat for 15 minutes and finally canceled her order. After checking on it, the waitress came out with the dish and asked if my friend would like to TAKE IT OUT. ""Yes"", was my friend's reply. *Myself and the nephew split our dishes so that my friend could have something to eat. From here, the customer experience began to DETERIORATE.*

THE DISH WAS GONE
When the check came the dish was not added to the price, but it was also not packed and had disappeared. We were confused as to why it was gone after the waitress offered to give it to us for take out. *The stress caused by this ruined my own customer experience because we were angry that the restaurant didn't seem to care about what happened.*

MISCOMMUNICATION?
Perhaps the waitress meant 'Remove it from the bill' and wasn't offering it for free--fine. But SOYO, you SHOULD HAVE just given it to my friend as compensation because that's good customer service. It doesn't matter if you disagreed in the moment with her, because now you've ALIENATED a woman that lives three blocks away and loves your food but will not return, thus losing your restaurant hundreds to thousands of dollars in the LONG TERM. *The fact that we were even worrying at all about these issues made me wish we had eaten ELSEWHERE.*

DON'T LOSE BUSINESS OVER $11
Just give her a free beef salad! Mr. Manager--pay for it out of your own pocket--it's only 11 bucks! Your food is great, your restaurant is very cute, but remember a great restaurant is classy and treats its loyal customers with more respect. *The fact that I have to write a bad review and explain this is BULLSHIT.*

WHAT TO DO NEXT
Just write a reply to this review and say you'll comp her dish and we will be back, and I'll update the review to be about the great customer service move you made. Otherwise, it will remain at 1-Star to remind Las Vegas that the business of loyal customers don't matter to SOYO.

LASTLY -- THIS IS THE 2ND POSTING OF THIS REVIEW
This review was previously REMOVED because of the rare technicality that ""it appeared to be primarily based on someone else's customer experience"". Well guess what happens when your friend has a bad experience at a restaurant while you get to eat and watch her go hungry -- your own experience is also ruined. My own experiences are now asterisked above. But there's more to my experience. Guess who walked back in to talk to the management about the problem? Me. Guess who was appalled when the manager understood our side but decided it's better to lose customers than comp the dish? Art S. -- Me. Guess who looked the manager in the eye and said if you don't comp the dish I'm writing a 1-star Yelp review. Donald Trump? No, ME! So was my experience also ruined by my the treatment of my friend? HELLs to the YES.

Now SOMEBODY took the time to figure out how to remove my review on a rare technicality that no common Yelp reader would know about. Prrrrrrobably SOYO management. So INSTEAD of just saying, ""We'd love to have you back, here's your free dish,"" they took the weasel route. Well SOYO, the bright side is it shows you actually care about a bad review on Yelp. So how about THIS as a better way to remove it: 

Please comp the dish :)",kiNuLT0QBYXRaH1DSXykFA,41,36,1,EtFjrzq_xssIC8v8EO7fDA

4701520,2013-02-23,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I was really nervous to try a new Korean restaurant and the only reason I finally decided to go was based on its close proximity to home. Naturally, I have high expectations and I'm pleased to say that I enjoyed it! So, the meal had its highs and lows and when I compare it with other Korean restaurants, it was better (and worse) in different ways. 

First, the service was much better than I've experienced in most Korean restaurants. Definite plus. I love the cold tea water they serve because it reminds me of visits to my grandmother's house and Korea when I was a child. The bowls were cute too. The panchan (side dishes) on the other hand were rather disappointing. Tonight we were served potato salad (why this is a staple in Korean restaurants is beyond me), dried Furikake-like seaweed, radish kimchee, kimchee, and broccoli. I seriously can't eat kimchee anywhere because that's probably the one dish I am most critical, however, there have been some that are manageable. These two kimchees were really bad. The other dishes were meh. The seaweed was cool and Ruben enjoyed it with his rice.

For dinner, we ordered the Yaang Nyum chicken wings and Soon Dubu Jjigae. The chicken was really great! Not many Korean restaurants serve this dish nor do it well, so I was really happy. The last time I had Yaang Nyum chicken this delicious was in LA's Koreantown! They serve it with tiny cubes of pickled white radish (standard) and it's just so great together. The jjigae (soup) was not my favorite preparation of it (soon dubu jjigae is one of my favorite Korean dishes, so it's tough to please), but it was still delicious in its own way. The tofu was definitely on point! Very silky and perfectly soft. Nice portion for eight dollars as well.

I was torn between three and four stars, but I decided to give it four stars because the space, atmosphere, and menu were all really cool. Plus, the food had a lot of highlights (hopefully I get better panchan next time) and I can't complain about an easy 10-minute drive from my house.

This was one of my favorite places to come to in college to knock back some soju back (I loveeee their yogurt soju) and eat some food with my friends. 

Everything is priced very reasonably and their food is always great and delicious. I would say you'll be spending around $20 a person if you're not boozing and if you are - it would be upwards from there. 

I came in with my family the other evening and enjoyed some soondae jigae and spicy pork belly & squid with bean sprouts (bomb). I'm also a fan of their bo Ssäm, LA kalbi, and their grilled samgyeopsal with a side salad and garlic. AND THE CORN CHEESE.  They always provide additional banchan with no extra charge - which is awesome. 

I will say that sometimes you get amazing service and sometimes it can get spotty. If it's cold out, it gets limited on seating inside but their outdoor patio and little upstairs table is pretty cool too if you have a larger group. I'd recommend calling ahead. 

Definitely check this place out if you are craving some Korean food and can't make it all the way to Spring Mountain or if you just want to get lit with your friends.",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,2,1,5,RTQ7-ZfRs3mUb6GColRvYg

First off, the portion sizes are healthy.  The ribs were $15 but you get a very nice sized portion and the Kim Chi fried rice was huge.  The food itself was delicious!  The ribs were cooked to perfection and full of flavor, and the Kim Chi fried rice was revelation.  It's finished with a fried egg and this dish is just a plethora of textures and flavors: savory, salty, spicy and vinegary(if that's an actual word).  

The rest of the menu looks amazing; there are so many things I want to try.  Plus, they have a Korean Tapas menu which looks super good.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because I want to wait until I go in for the full dining experience, order a larger variety of items and I'm optimistic I'll be bumping it up to a five star rating.

I bumped this back down to four stars.  I've gotten take out from this place around five or six times and everything has been outstanding including the service.

4744358,2011-04-25,5,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Soyo now gets the five star treatment from me.  Service is always excellent and is able to cater to my party, whether it's two people or twelve people.  They have no problem pushing together several tables to accomodate large parties.  The staff here is extremely friendly and very open about their menu.  Not only will they tell you what is good, they'll also tell you what is not so good.  I think one big thing that Soyo has going for them is that the staff speaks English pretty well, which makes things a bit more convenient for us non-Koreans.

I can safely say that food here has remained consistent, since my friends and I have ordered the same dishes many times over several visits.  The Budae Jjigae is still delicious, and if you ask them for more broth/soup they will bring it!  We asked for enough refills on soup last time that they even gave us more ramen noodles.  They know we enjoy their jjigae.

We're now on a mission to try the whole menu, and everything we've tried has been good.  Recently I've tried the Blood Sausage and the Very Spicy Chicken.  The blood sausage was tasty, and came with some vegetables and clear noodles.  The Very Spicy Chicken is very spicy (spicy in, spicy out).  Order it mild or medium, and you have a delicious chicken dish with some spice and mozarella cheese on top.

There are also special nights throughout the week now.  Tuesday nights are ladies night, where you can get drink specials if your party has 3 or more girls; no guys allowed in your party though!  I believe the drink special was 2 for 1 drinks, but I'm not positive (I'm not a lady, so it doesn't apply to me!)  On Wednesday through Sunday nights, if your party spends around $75 you get to spin their wheel.  Prizes range from nothing, to free cocktails/beer, to a $50 credit for food.  Lucky for me, the group I go with will almost always spend $75!

It is safe to say that Soyo is easily one of my top Repeat Eats!  Enough so that now there's a new Yelp Las Vegas acronym: SUYE (Soyo UYE)!",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,8,6,5,EeWPbEoPvAmRNYCJBZlRQw
4750899,2016-05-19,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Soyo is an interesting restaurant. It's decor reminisces the war era according to my friend. Indeed, it has old school metal lamps hung from its cord, concrete looking wallpaper and decor. Barley tea is poured into metal tin cups. At one time these were probably items used by the poor or soldiers but now they are trendy. I was told by my friend who frequents the place that this concept originally came from LA....much like most restaurants in Vegas. I think the only thing original in Vegas is the sand that blows outside.

The service was not bad. They forgot my BBbap for a good 30-40 minutes before we stopped conversing and wondering where the food was besides the Hite beer my friend was imbibing. I much liked the barley drink so I was on bottle #2 by then. The waiter professed not to have heard me even though he repeated what I said when he took our orders. That's fine. Mistakes happen so we weren't fussing over it. Besides, neither one of us is a rotund Kardashian who would break a nail at such an outrage. Oops, I think I wrote aloud on that one.

They brought out the sides and I munched on that and had them refill 2 of them before my entree came out. The food did come out 10 minutes later. While the dish was traditional, the taste wasn't. Missing was the aroma and flavor of the burnt rice crust on the bottom of the earthen pot/bowl. And that my friends is how you make 10 minute bimbimbapp. The egg and toppings were meh.

BBP was one of my first introductions to korean food. Before Vegas grew, the commercial center was where you find Korean restaurants and the only K restaurant down there that was great was Jinme. I didn't know you were supposed to mix the bowl up before eating. The owner/server saw me and exasperatedly said , ""ahhhh, if I had time I would show you how to eat this"" and hurriedly mixed it up for me before rushing to the next table. So from there on, I mix my BBP like a non-Korean guy would, gingerly.

My friend, who is Korean, told me that it's a very good eatery. I'll take his word for it because he's a pretty fastidious eater. I patronize oxtail soups in the California and Fremont Hotels so my style is no style, as long as it tastes good.

We went at 12:30am and we stayed until 2:20 toward closing time of 2:30. There were quite a few of us still in there toward the end. So, while I didn't care for my food much, it's a pretty popular place. Like any respectable trendy K spot, there were 2 groups of guys puffing smokes and vapes outside the restaurant as we walked to the car.

Paying my bill at the register I noticed on the wall huge chalkboard wall, a drink they dubbed the beergarita. I guess besides the war cantina look, they outsmarted Mexican restaurants and bottled the margarita. And they say the land of Samsung doesn't innovate.

Boo Dae JJI Gae is a must here (spicy army soup) get it with everything such as the ramen noodles. 1 soup would be good for about 3-4 people. It's pretty much everything in your fridge put together in a hot boiling soup. Very delish. 

Gaal Bi Jjim is Beef short rib stew with vegetables and is also a great dish if you're looking for something other than the traditional Gal-bi short ribs. This stew is marinated well and the beef is so soft that it falls of the bone. You can pour the stew on your rice which is an added bonus. 

Jap Chae (Korean Chives or Bullgogi) with clear noodles stirfried with vegetables flavored with soy sauce and sesami oil. Always great!

Dduk Bok E is the korean Rice cake with boiled egg, fish cake and vegetables stir fried with sweet and spicy sauce. Great portion for the price and you can get it even more spicy by asking the waiter. 

The mixed soju is also good here with a variety of flavors. Hite, OB and Cass only come in bottles and pitchers include sapporo and other draft beers.

3. The food is amazing. I am of Korean descent and quite frankly they have the best al-tang (fish egg soup), I have ever eaten in my life (don't tell my mom). The side dishes always seem freshly prepared and not refrigerated for weeks. Everything really tastes phenomenal; the soondubu is great and even the kalbi (BBQ ribs) is marinated perfectly. Its even better than the Korean BBQ spots scattered around town! 

To boot, everything is reasonably priced. I don't think I've ever seen anything on the menu over $13. That's a far cry from the $25 for one slab of meat at the Korean restaurants in Chinatown! Highly recommended.",NYxQwZ7ftzfBeE0HJolpEg,1,2,5,96vd18XZ3Y84pi0-qBAMBw

4918512,2017-12-05,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"This is a long overdue review. I have been coming here since they opened, and it is our default restaurant. When we have big groups, take our out of town guests, and when we don't know what to eat, we come to Soyo. 

Ambiance: it is a nice casual place where the music is somewhat loud so you can be loud with your friends too :p 

Services: the reason I gave four stars. I feel like the service here used to be better. Now, it is inconsistent. I had to keep waving down a waitress when I sat upstairs with the big group a couple of times. 

Food: I can say Soyo is probably my favorite Korean place in town asides from Korean BBQ places.  Here's the some of the items we order consistently:

1. Rice cake skewers (5/5): nice chewy fried rice cake with sweet and spicy sauce. Our must order. It came with two skewers with five pieces each. 

2. Chicken wings (4/5): we usually ask for half and half. Half spicy and half garlic sauce since there's always someone in the group who doesn't eat spice as much. It comes with 8 pieces. 

3. Galbi Jjim (5/5): another must order for me. It's a short rib beef stew with white radish, carrot and onion. The savory sauce with hint of sweetness. It is cooked perfectly almost every time. It only has about 4 to 5 pieces of meat so order two if you have a big group. 

4. Spicy cold buckwheat noodle (4/5): we like to order this during the summer time. It is nicely seasoned with spicy and sour sauce. 

5. Grilled Mackerel (4/5): don't order this dish if you only like fillet fish with no bones. They used to have half order but now they only have full order which is a pretty decent size for a table of 4 to 6 to share. 

We also enjoy seafood casserole, corn cheese, tofu pots, mandu, and variety of cocktail and flavored rice wine here.

Most of our friends who we took here really enjoy this place and want to come back. Soyo group has a great designer who designed their restaurants nicely. From Soyo, Sparkling, Goong, and Yuxiang, each has its own individuality. I think the common quality that these restaurants have is the consistency. My recent favorite from the Soyo group is Yuxiang.

To be honest the food for me is not all that great but what they lack in taste they make up for in atmosphere. There's always a fun hip vibe complete with loud KPOP music.. This place definitely caters to the under 40 crowd. Although after a certain time I do believe you have to be 21.  

They have lots of beer including one of my faves, Purple Haze! Soju, flavored soju, cocktails are also on the drink menu and they even do bottle service HAHA i think you can buy a bottle of crown for under $70.  

As for food I always get one of the casseroles. Perfect for sharing. It's like a big hot pot that comes on it's own little stove. I like the ""gamjatang,"" potato & pork bone stew, the best. 

One thing I would watch out for is the parking lot. On one occasion my friend's car got hit. Now I don't know if it's all the Korean people JUST KEEDING or the drinking but you definitely should be on the defense and make sure there are no crazy drivers around!

Hot Tip: Be sure to offer your servers a shot of your soju, they will return the favor by hooking it up with some more yummy banchan~",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,4,3,3,_j8DdiqW7E4dHCH6bMTACA

I'm all for supporting my neighborhood shops & restaurants, so when I took notice of this establishment I told the hubby that we got to go try it. 

When we first walked in the hubby & I didn't know what to make of the place because it was blaring club music. To make the situation more confusing was the interior decor, it was very nostalgic. But the hubby appreciated it as he noticed the old TV in a wooden box that took him back when he was a kid, so I get it.

I appreciated that we were seated and served our drinks right a way, but the service from there went down hill (Thus I'm giving this place a 3) I'm big on service so even if a restaurant has less than quality food but have exceptional service encourages me to want to come back. 

For me the menu was a little confusing and felt that it could be more descriptive or perhaps our server could have go over it with us or suggest some items. Anyway, here is what we ordered:

* Kimchi Jjigae (w/pork) $8- This was very good. But I don't know if they were being skimpy on the meat because it was chopped up very small I hardly notice the meat in it. 
* Galbi $12-  This was very delicious. The meat was thick and juicy =P
* Potato pancakes $9- I never tried this before so I didn't know what to expect. It was the last thing to come out as the server explained that it takes a little more time because they have to smash the potato's. With that in mind I thought it should be good then cause they make it from scratch. I was totally wrong. Right when it was set on the table I was already disappointed as you can see the 4 pancake size potato's was very oily. It came with some dipping sauce that was just soy sauce mixed with sriracha and was the only thing that gave it any flavor. 

I think Soyo is more a great place to go with friends, hangout and drink, rather a place to go have a lovely nice dinner with a love one.",lf5hE9wVr7jFXd95hLPs-w,0,0,3,CH_f0OGEi8epxEDJp64rAg

- The Ban Chan - This was the most uninspired bit of the restaurant.  If found the ban chan to be a bit average at best. 

- Gam Jaa Taang - Pork Neck Bone stew - Yes.  this is a huge dish to be shared with many people.  Lots of pork bone and vegetables.  The vegetables must have been dehydrated as they were stringy and very hard to chew.  Tasty though.  The pork neck bones were awesomely tender.  Just a bit huge and they could have trimmed them to a more manageable size.  Served to you table side on a small propane burner to keep this huge soup bowl warm.

- Gaal Bi - Your traditional beef short ribs bbq style.  I found the meat to be a bit fatty or chewy.  Not as tender as I have had it. Tasty!

- Dol Sot Bi Bim Baap - Veggies and rice with beef, friend egg in a stone pot.  Yummy and especially with the chili paste.

I used to go to ones in Chicago and sometimes they had the best food. We had the bu dae jigae, commonly known as G.I. stew. Why would anyone want a spicy stew that has spam, ramen noodles, sausage and rice cakes? Cause it's awesome and spicy and you will want to eat it. You can also get some decent duk bok gi which are spicy fat rice noodles with fish cakes. It was a little sweet for my taste but definitely spicy.

It was adventure time  and we wanted to hit a joint that was different so I read the numerous 5 Stars branded on Soyo.  As soon as we were seated, it took our waiter  such a long time before he approached us that we all dared eachother to up and leave and hit the neighboring sushi joint if he doesn't come in the next 5 min.  The thing is, we didn't have an order to begin with.. all we had buzzing around our heads were ???. It was our first time at Soyo and we had questions about everything.  There was a bottle of carmel colored liquid on our table and 2 silver tin pans... didnt know what it was, what to do with and if we had to pay for.  No one bothered to tell us that the COMPLIMENTARY iced TEA was supposed to be POURED into and SIPPED from the tin PANS.. who woulda knew?  The menu was foreign from the normal Korean BBQ so we asked the waiter to bring us a couple of their most popular dishes.  He brought us the Chicken Wings w Special Sauce and the Garlic Squid.  The presentation was so so and the taste of the dishes didn't jazz me up one bit.  The wings were overdressed with what tasted like BBQ sauce and the garlic baked squid was good (eatable), but it wasn't the rave.

4974465,2010-09-19,3,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"A decent Korean restaurant in the southwest area without breaking the bank!

We've been meaning to hit up Soyo Barstaurant for awhile, so was pretty happy when one of our friends suggested that place for her birthday dinner.

We had a pretty huge group - at least twenty people.  We easily took over the two long tables in the middle, although there was still plenty of room in the booth-like tables, and in the little loft area on the right when you enter.

One thing I definitely appreciate are the bottles of iced Korean tea readily available on the tables.  This makes life (for customers and employees) so much easier because then you don't have to wave the staff down for refills every few minutes.  The unusual thing (for most of us) were the gold bowls on the tables.  We could only assume they were cups for drinking, but were a bit unsure.

They started off with three different kinds of banchan that evening - cabbage kim chee, string beans, and fish cake.  A bit skimpy on the banchan side of things, but was overlooked.

Four of us decided to share a few items:

* Kim Chee Fried Rice ($7) - This was topped with a fried egg.  It was REALLY good, surprisingly tasty and really enjoyable.  Something I don't usually order, but would definitely order again at Soyo.

* Beef Short Ribs with Korean BBQ Sauce ($12) - A bit tough to eat, but had a good flavoring and the right amount of time on the grill.  We couldn't complain about the price either.

* Spicy Pork Ribs ($10) - Another dish that the boys devoured and enjoyed.  The price wasn't too bad for this dish as well.

* Spicy Soft Tofu with Seafood, Beef or Pork Soup ($8) - I was pretty stuffed by the time this dish arrived.  It was pretty standard for a soft tofu soup, and I chose the seafood option for it.

They also have quite a few things they describe as ""Korean tapas"" and lots more entree options.

The only real complaint was the service.  It was a bit understaffed with only two people working.  They should have had another person, especially with our large party that took over.  We had to remind them about certain items - rice, for example.

Overall, everyone was surprised with how the bill turned out.  Even with alcohol, it was a lot less expensive that most people thought it was going to be.

I had dinner here a little over a week ago. Considering it was Friday night, I expected it to be busy but it wasn't. 

With that being said, service wasn't great. In fact, it has been pretty slow the last few times I dined here. The items we ordered were good but just didn't hit the spot. The banchans were junk though. I usually clean up every little dish but I hardly touched them. By the end of the meal, I was feeling a bit disappointed and ready to bounce.

You taste nothing short of authentic from a place that's located in the suburbs and the fact that they're open late every night deserves a five star review in my book.

Everything that I've had is good. I have literally tried everything on the menu and only found myself not liking one thing- the wings (which were unexpectedly sweet). But take my word when I say that EVERYTHING is amazing here. I'd rather have you go and try it out yourself than to base your decision on a review.

Service is always friendly as well. They seem to love their job and quite attentive whenever you need them to be (like a refill on their barley tea- so good!). The prices are very reasonable for the quality as well and this is something I cannot stress enough when I'm obsessing over a restaurant.

The only thing that they could change is the loud music they're blasting late at night.

They offer tables, booths, and patio seating. This is not an All-You-Can-Eat spot so expect to choose classic Korean dishes. Price point is normal for a Korean spot (upper middle range). 

The menu offers many different dishes with English and Korean names with descriptions (no worries fellow non-Korean people!). We ordered the bulgogi beef and a ramen hot soup with tofu, sausages, spam, and vegetables. They bring out the classic house side dishes and we ordered SoMak (Chamisol Soju and Hite beer) to start. Not too long, they brought out a butane stove and dropped off the pot of soup with ramen.

The soup was excellent in taste and hit the spot. It is more of a traditional house-made meal families would make on the whim. Not too spicy but packed with delicious spicy aromas. The jalapenos added a nice touch to the broth. The bulgogi was wonderful with the right cuts of beef.

Service was attentive and I never felt like they were annoying. Although pricey, I wouldn't complain as it is expected. Definitely a spot to check out. K. Cheng approves!",f_z_JtNybp_0d0eWO75JUQ,0,0,4,3WQyttH37wtU_32ieahLHg

Today, I called a good friend to join me for dinner at a place I've never tried before but heard some great stuff about.  Turns out that my friend has been here many times and loves it, so I had to try Soyo!

First off, I LOVE the ambiance.  This ""barstraunt"" is a little small, but boasts a lot of personality.  There's Korean lettering, wooden tables with mats to sit on, small little cabana-booths to eat in, disguised as a Korean house with windows.  There was an array of awesome Korean genres playing.  I couldn't understand the words, but the music was lovely.This is a great place to do Korean date night!  

There was two female servers and a male server working.  The female servers were super sweet and remembered my friend which I appreciated.  The male server was kind of impatient and wasn't really helpful. 

When you sit down,you are greeted with a cold barley drink at your table.  It's refreshing and tastes great throughout the meal.  They even serve it in small tin bowls which was new to me but added greatly to the overall experience.  I really appreciate them bringing us more as we needed.  We decided to get the garlic chicken and the grilled mackerel.  Those two dishes and a salad came out to about $30 total.  Honestly, the price is a little higher than other Korean joints, but I think it pays for the ambiance as well.  The garlic chicken was great!  The flavor was perfect.  It was served with chunks of garlic.  Not too crazy about it being on the bone, though, I'd prefer boneless.  The highlight of my meal however, was the grilled mackerel.  It was juicy and fell off the bones of the fish.  The grilled meat was super flavorful and reminded me of the yellow tail collar bone I often times get at sushi restaurants. Served with a tangy dipping soy sauce and you got an AH-MAZE-ING dish!  Highly recommended. Like other Korean restaurants, they bring out an assortment of side dishes to accompany your meal.  I loved the pickled radishes and kim chee.  

All in all, I would say that I had a great time there.  I will be back again with a bigger group and for a later dinner.  This place is trendy and great for hipsters looking for a food joint off the strip on the southwest side of town.  Be sure to check this place out if you're ever in that area.

I think if you stick to their greatest hits you can have a good meal. We let Tien navigate some communal dishes. 

Budae Jiggae (aka wartime soup) is a medley of rice cakes, veggies, kimchi, spam, sausage and topped with ramen noodles. Theirs was pretty good and came in a quite large pot on a tabletop burner that is definitely for sharing. 

Grilled Whole Mackerel - this was pretty darm yum. I know, it's a basic and standard dish but the freshness plus the char and the simple sauce was all elements done right. 

Thin Marble Beef - which was sauteed with garlic and came with some korean salad, some pickles and a dipping sauce. This also was rather good. I'm a fan whenever I go to KBBQ of that simple green salad with that dressing and I normally gravitate towards thin sliced KBBQ meats too. 

Chicken Wings - these were really nicely crispy and had a sticky soy based sauce on them that is super similar to these ""Korean chicken"" that I find sometimes at Hawaiian plate places that I really enjoy. Super good. 

Cold Noodles in broth - this is one of those things people like or dont and I happen to like it. I find it kinda refreshing though can be plain. I do think I prefer the spicy cold noodles and I ask for a tiny bit of this broth on the side which is the best of both worlds. 

We also got pitchers of some red sangria and some soju. Banchans were pretty solid and I appreciated some of them were refilled. On a hot day, I appreciated pitchers of water and barley tea are left on the table. I rather serve myself than wait and get salty. 

Our server was pretty friendly and nice. 

I didn't think I would be wanting to go back, but after this experience I definitely would come back for some Korean eats. If you're not sure what to order and it's your first time, maybe try to ask for recommendations. I think I seriously ordered wrong last time.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,4,sQQcjxWrGIdwRsYHyMf1mw

I still frequent their sister restaurant Oyshi Sushi just a few doors over. Truth be told, I'm still so much into Oyshi(I just went again yesterday!) I hadn't bothered to try Soyo til I got dragged here lol. It's not a really large place, very casual. I'm guessing the interior was made to resemble more of a typical korean drinking spot? I say guessing since I've never experienced the korean drinking scene but the style seemed to be aiming for something to that effect.
They serve boricha, a corn tea that's common in korean cuisine. Instead of cups there's small metal(copper?) bowls to drink from. It's a slightly bitter tea but it complements alot of the spicy and savory korean foods.
The menu was pretty good in describing the various items for people who might not be as familiar with korean food. We're korean and grew up on korean food, so not necessary for us lol. Prices looked reasonable. This might be considered more of a drinking spot, but no one in our party drank, so I can't vouch for their spirits. But nothing definitely wrong with just coming to eat the food. I'm sure nobody here will scold you or call the food police!
There was 2 waitresses and they were good at keeping the side dishes and tea refilled and whatever else we needed.
The side dishes were decent. The only one that was kinda puzzling. It was shaved radish with mayo and I could taste a bit of egg. My best guess is a radish version of potato/macaroni salad? I ordered the spicy rice cake, it was fiery n delicious. If you don't have a high tolerance of spicy you might want to ask for this mild or try something else. Also had their version of hot wings with sauce made with korean chili paste(not overly spicy). There was kimchi fried rice & spicy tofu stew that I didn't try but was told were pretty good too.

DATE ATMOSPHERE: Of all the Korean restaurants I've been to in Vegas, Soyo definitely has that 'cool factor' for a good date spot. The COOL part is in the booths on the back wall. They're constructed of wood and elevated off the ground. Very private and really gives the place this extra cool vibe. Lights are usually dimmed . And a blend of Top40 is playing that I approve of! Plus, you get to drink barley tea out of a copper tin bowl--offbeat ftw!

PRICES:  Prices are a dollar or two higher than I would like, but hey! They're in a suburb area and super convenient. I don't have to drive to C-town to get some good Korean food if I have a craving!  Avg: $10-13 / entree.

FOOD: I can't speak Korean. But I can read & understand all my food. My apologies in advance for my Konglish translations. I've tried a number of different things on the menu and they're all pretty good! I would definitely return. I can make 'Doenjang jjigae' (Soy Bean Paste Soup) at home and I have to say that Soyo's has a homemade flavor that I can appreciate. The' Yuk Gae Jang' (Spicy Soup w/ shredded beef, clear noodle, & veggie) could be a little spicier and more flavorful--but for people who can't handle their heat, this is a good thing. Pancakes are flavorful and crispy. But you really can't ruin fried food. One thing to try is the' Ddeokbokki'--rice cake sticks in a spicy sauce with veggies (get the seafood option if you like!) SWEET & SAVORY DELICIOUSNESS.

PORTIONS: Soup servings are average and comparable to any other K eatery. But any other entree is HUGE. Even the ""appetizer"" stuff is pretty big. 1 entree/soup per person is more than enough. Be prepared to be absolutely stuffed if you order a 3rd dish to share. 

SERVICE: Polite & Prompt. Offered to refill side-dishes numerous times. Drinks were always topped off. And they didn't mind us hanging out to chill & talk after we were done eating.",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,3,4,4,mSk1opWQ-6reTnNwMqd55g

It's a little brighter than I feel it should be. The booths provide intimacy, not that intimacy was needed for me, Anthony and Tien. Just saying, if you're in a date type of scenario, the privacy would be welcomed. But the high walls also have a drawback in my book. It's a bitznitch to flag down a server for any assistance if you aren't sitting at the edge of the booths. And you do have to flag down the staff if you want anything here. The guys tell me that might be typical of Korean culture. So maybe they get a pass for that here? The high walls also prevent you from enjoying the view to take in the ambience. I do want to check out the outdoor patio sometime though. It is actually enclosed at the moment, not sure if they do that during warmer months or not. 

The food was good. I enjoyed their beef short ribs, the Korean chicken, and a few bites of the other random things that were ordered. Tien ordered a warm soup I think, and they brought him a totally different cold anchovy soup. He just accepted it and ate it anyway. Though I think he wasn't a big fan. 

Anyway, this place was pretty cool and I'd return. It's far from a 'Home run! Must become a regular.' type of scenario for me, but still a solid 'Will return again.'. Oh and there was a random mix of music from K-Pop to Timbaland so that was fun.",eBWDX4a5iURWg-MA97hFpg,2,1,4,TLmEyjEheH11i1f8FLrVnQ

Mandu was good, tasty filling and great flavor and consistency.  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soyo-korean-barstaurant-las-vegas?select=SAJYCicKM6MULVgtNj51jw#SAJYCicKM6MULVgtNj51jw

Bulgogi...pretty yummy cooking in the soupy broth.  I guess this is the more authentic way of serving it, but I like it best when it has crispy edges and char...which this would never have being cooked in the broth, but it did have a bit more flavor since it's sitting that broth :)  Pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/soyo-korean-barstaurant-las-vegas?select=tO3LUDfLW_h4N7_QHkhwdw#tO3LUDfLW_h4N7_QHkhwdw

Banchan was good....a little bit of everything with about 5 plates, which is a little less than most Korean spots I've been to so far.  They refilled the kimchi fairly quickly when asked.

After having a cold buckwheat noodle soup with my brother once before, I decided to continue with the buckwheat tradition, but ordered the Cold Buckwheat Noodles in the Spicy Broth. My coworkers ordered the Cucumber, Kimchee Noodles and the Bulgogi dish. Needless to say, everyone was satisfied. My buckwheat dish was a huge portion, enough to feed two people for only eight bucks. Everyone else commented the same on theirs, with only one of us to finish our entire dish. Oh, those noodles. Cold yet spicy; filling yet addictive. Oh then there were the sides - the one that garnered attention from our chopsticks was the rehydrated squid. It was salty, slightly sweet like my favorite childhood snack without the chewiness of dried squid. That with my noodles was the perfect thing for the four hours of sleep and multiple beers the prior night. 

Now service. I can't remember our server's name, but she was the absolute sweetest! Something about her quirky, adorable demeanor mixed with attentiveness and cordiality. I adored her almost as much as I did my noodles!

Having a brother and two best friends completely enamored with the Korean culture piqued my own interest. After Soyo, it became blatant why. I can now say I have a crush on the Korean culture too.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,1,1,5,X6UJtM7Rxs70eUFyMU17Qw

When it comes to great food, we must analyze the three components of appearance, fragrance, and taste since it appeals to our senses! I will give 5 stars to appearance for Soyo's food, as it displays wonderful colors and textures. I'd give 4 stars to fragrances as it is quite satisfying to smell their food. I will give 4 stars to taste, because while it is delicious to eat all their cuisines, much improvements need to be implemented in comparisons to other Korean restaurants. In addition, as in for the hygiene category, it is acceptable for dining area, however the bathrooms needs more sanitizing.
Oh and let us not forget about the environment condition and customer services. The setting is very modernized. Various K-pop musics are popping all the time, while the fonts of decorations and menus are chalky and hippy. When it comes to customer services, I tend to notice this trend at many Korean restaurants (again, not all), if you are not a native speaker, you might not receive the best customer service compared to Korean speaker. As many times when waiter/waitress thought I was a Korean speaker, and when I talked to them in English instead, the attitudes and enthusiasms were different than before. But generally they are kind, lolz.

We were seated in one of the booths that could be considered intimate because it's very private and lighting is somewhat dim.  This time around I wanted to try something different because for the most when in a Korean restaurant I will order beef short ribs, fried rice, chicken wings, etc.

We ordered #48.  I forgot what it was called.  So much for remembering because it was really good.  You can order it with ramen or without.  We opted to eat it without since we get rice with the order anyway.  They asked us twice and made sure our order wasn't with ramen.  That made us think if we should have had it with ramen.  Oh well, next time.  

It was a soup and supposedly the history behind this dish is that the Korean soldiers used to prepare this meal since it was quick and it feeds a lot of people.  There was spam, sausages, bacon, jalapeno, tofu, carrots, other vegetables I can't pin point, fried rice cake, and among other things thrown in the mixture.  

As always, our dish came with side dishes and I'm happy to indulge.  I really love coming here as the atmosphere is just relaxed and laid back.  Servers are always kind and quick to cater to your needs.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,1,5,FG95yQuc6RzWTjl_Bvt5Jw

The staff is always friendly here and they don't really rush you even you eat here. And the barley tea that you drink with metal bowls definitely gives it the touch of originality. Don't be afraid to try this place but always try to eat here when it's not busy because most of the time it is. Great thing too is they're open late.

Soyo is definitely a spot that has a vibe that makes up for any culinary shortcomings. You can come in with 12  of your rowdiest buds at 2am and live it up (if you like Korean food!).

That was my first experience, except I was a tad too sleepy to live it up or to really think about my order. I ended up with a cold buckwheat noodle, tasty but not something I could make an entire meal of. Still, I was impressed by their ability to handle a large group of boisterous bodies.

Second trip, I went with my fave Korean treat, sundubu, and this came with banchan. The banchan were good, but could have been a bit fresher. There wasn't one that I requested refills on, and usually I am a refill girl! They were able to make my sundubu without meat, which I appreciated. It had zucchini, a nice treat. However, it didn't have many other ingredients. Still, it was a nice sized bowl for $7. The flavor wasn't as complex as others, but I finished the bowl.

The servers cracked me up. I was going to order one thing, and one server told me it was tasteless. Then, as we were leaving we asked about the wheel (earn a spin by spending $75 after 10pm), and another guy told us it wasn't worth it! Even so, I'm a sucker for a wheel of fortune. Love their honesty.

The booths are not as clean as I'd expect - built up crumbs and oil like stains on the seats and table that I had to wipe it down myself. 

Anyways, the server was nice, he came with water and barley tea (so refreshing!), and then took our order. My fiancè got a Bi Bim Baap and I ordered Gal Bi Jjim 15, and a side dish of Beef Japche.
Because it was slow our order came within 15 minutes. Portioning is good to leave you full and satisfied with some left overs. The dish wasn't as savory as I expected and my rice was very oily that I had to strain some oil out by squeezing my rice into another dish. Our entrées were sizzling and i thought it is a creative way to present their food, careful though the food remains very hot!

Upon seating, we were offered cold, refreshing bori cha (barley tea). Note: If you would like ice cold water, you'll have to ask (they do not offer unless you ask). 

The meal: We ordered galbi, bulgolgi and bibimbap (marinated ribs, meat and hot stone rice with veggies and egg). All delicious and savory. My only complaint is that they didn't have a variety of vegetable tastings upon seating / before the meal (most rival Korean restaurants have a variety of fermented vegetables. This includes kimchi, radishes, sprouts, etc. This offering was limited). Additionally, the fermented vegetables, bulgolgi bibimbap, galbi all contained sesame seeds. I enjoyed them, but sadly, my Aunt had to pick around it since she is allergic to them. We asked if they could prepare some vegetables without, and they said they could not. Strange, but true.

I also saw that the tapas side of the menu has ""soondooboo"" for five bucks. I ordered it thinking it was just a smaller size of the soondooboo you normally find at korean tofu houses. Little did I know, it was literally a slab of soft tofu in a pot of water. WTF, even my korean friends that this was a first....oh well i should've know..since it was 5 bucks.

Environment: The interior of the restaurant is somewhat small but they make very good use of their limited space. The interior decorating seems very authentic and makes you feel like you are in Korea. They have low tables and several more private booths against the wall. Additionally, they do have a patio section which is constructed in a way that allows people to sit out there even in the Vegas summer heat. They are also very good about reservations, as there have been many times when we have made reservations for 20+ people and they accommodate us very well, so they are a good place to go for get-togethers.

Food: The food is also top notch. Their menu has various sections from smaller portion appetizers to noodle dishes, casseroles which are good for sharing, and an assortment of BBQ beef and pork dishes. A couple of my go-to items are the Marble beef, which comes with a delicious dipping sauce and a large portion of salad, the spicy squid pasta, and the bulgolgi japchae. The portions are also rather generous and make it easy to share. Their drink menu is also great, including flavored sojus, beers, and other alcohol choices such as bokbunja, makgeolli, and bekseju.

Service: Service is somewhat spotty, but with the layout of the restaurant it doesn't make it too difficult to get staff's attention if you need it, while also being allowed privacy. Additionally, every time I have come with a large group of people they are very attentive on checking on everybody.

We were given cold barley tea (which tasted like corn) and unlimited ban chan.  We got gaal bi jjim (short rib stew with veggies), gaam jaa jyun (potato pancake), soon dae bokkeum (spicy blood sausage with clear noodles and veggies), maan doo (fried dumplings), and bulgogi.  All washed down with Hite and soju.  The meats on the gaal bi and bulgogi were tender and flavorful.  The blood sauage was really spicy for my taste - it's not something I'd eat by myself.  I really liked the maan doo and potato pancake - fried and crispy.

There's a lot to choose from from the menu.  I want to go back and try other dishes...soon!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,2,1,4,mP239OQ9nBglJdVKv89Clg

The only Korean food I have ever encountered was the BBQ; who doesn't like grilled meats? Anyway, not knowing anything, I let the experts order. I for the most part had no idea what I ate. None of it stuck because I didn't particularly care for it. The beef nonsoup dishes were the best, although not memberable. 

I found the tastes to be either lackluster, underwhelming, or just spicy. Nothing that really hit it out of the ballpark for me or piqued my interest in venturing into Korean cuisine anytime soon or ever again for that matter.

Service was alright. We had to constantly ask for more silverware, more cups, more tea, more almost everything. I think this is mainly because we were the overzealous group on the patio.

The portions were decent, it would fill up two to three people easily, and the stew was perfectly spicy (note: I have a high tolerance for spiciness) and had so many ingredients that it was enjoyable to eat. Next we got the Blood Sausage Stir Fry which was hearty and savory with a slight kick... Yum!  Overall it was a good experience, and my family was definitely satisfied.

5339837,2013-03-03,1,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"WOW. That pretty much sums it up.

I remember when this place was being built my husband and I were like ""Korean Bar?! that place is not going to last. But every time we drove by, the place was packed and the reviews are always great - we decided to check the place out when we were itching for something new to try last night.

I really liked the interior. It was quaint, cozy and i liked how the booths were sorta closed off from the others.

I had to use the yelp app photos to determine what to try but the hubby found 3 iitems right away that wanted to try. He ordered the Spicy chicken, the katsu, and the BBQ ribs. I asked the waitress what I should order and she helped me figure out that I was a bulgogi person. I also decided on the fried dumplings.

The doggie bowls they give you for the brown water were a conversation piece...but after a few sips I was hooked. I absolutely loved the free AYCE side dishes. ESPECIALLY the spinach. I had like 4 refills. 

When the food came out, I was amazed at how great everything looked. The chicken parm-like katsu was awesome (hubby almost didn't want to share) and he LOVED the spicy chicken (just enough heat he said). My bulgogi was awesome (i AM a bulgogi person) and the dumplings were pretty good too. The ribs came out last and they were awesome but hands-down our table favorite was the katsu. It had all the right spices and it just really hit the spot.

We had leftovers and they actually tasted just a good, maybe even better the next day.

I'm a sucker for great service and besides the great food, the service matched the katsu. They were attentive but not overwhelming. I think the manager lady came by and when we told her we loved it all she politely said - ""I will look for you next time"". It's the little things that put the exclamation point on a great date night.

It's been over 24 hours and we are still talking about the place. We almost broke down and went back today but we settled for leftovers.

The price, atmosphere, service, and of course the food were all 5 stars. 

I never knew I'd like Korean food (hubby didn't either) but we know better now. If you are hesitant in any way, bite the bullet and check Soyo out. It was that good.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,2,3,5,76Zdv7cuNlCXhHPSknbX6A

If you want a place to drink and eat Korean night style this is the place. I love their makgoli especially the way the present it in a old school pot. Their other soju cocktails are good but a little bit too sweet.

The food is also a plus. It may be higher priced but it's a bar and also the amount is pretty hefty. My husband and I usually share a plate and we always have leftover.

Everything was mostly just okay. I have heard many good things about Soyo and a lot of my friends do enjoy this place. But for personal preferences, nothing at Soyo keeps me coming back and wanting more. And typically whenever we come, it's always someone else's suggestion to dine at Soyo..it typically never crosses my mind as an option. Whoops. 

I've tried their fatty beef dish, their spicy tofu soup (soondubu), sullungtang, kimchi pancake, wings, spicy cold buckwheat noodles, and some other things. Everything was just okay. Their soondubu was good. It had just the right amount of spicy kick to it. They also do add a few pieces of seaweed in there, which I actually did not care for. I don't really remember their sullungtang very much so I guess it was just okay? Their kimchi pancake is really good and I typically don't like Korean style pancakes. I do enjoy their spicy cold buckwheat noodles. I did not enjoy their wings with special sauce. 

Soyo is authentic and traditional yet with a modern twist to their food. They have a ton of options for you to choose from so if you do not enjoy one thing, you can always get something else. It's also a nice location .. so if you want Korean food, you don't have to drive to specifically to Chinatown for it if you live in the Spring Valley area.

With that being said, I love the variety of wonderful Korean dishes they serve here. The Albap is a solid dish that takes the standard bibimbap and amplifies it with delicious fish roe. The bright orange granules add a nice crunch and pop in every bite. Served in a dolsot, or stone bowl, it gets crispy on the bottom and adds more texture to the rice. The gamjajeon, or potato pancake, takes on attributes of the Jewish latke more than the Korean style. It is so good, you do not have to worry about it getting cold, because it will be gone. Cold noodles are a passion of mine and they have three of the best. The bibimnaengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles) are tossed in a spicy and sweet sauce and is my sister's go to meal. I ordered the bibimguksu (cold rice noodles) today and she loved those as well. If you like vinegar, try the broth version of the former. It has a richness from the beef bones and a tanginess that awakens the taste buds. 

My only complaint about this visit was that the radish kimchi was mushy. It should have a nice crunch. The other side dishes were ok, but nothing mind blowing.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,3,2,5,6MZD-6w7ImAqpAcdUaBZdw

I had a bite of a friends meal which was a huge bowl of some sort of spicy noodles, they were good but not something I'd get.

Speaking of tea, they serve a flask of iced Koren tea with tin cups, very quaint. 

After looking over the menu, I let my hubby make the choices, he's the best foodie I know and we usually don't do wrong by it. The server was a bit surprised because it did seem like a lot of food, especially when you add the kim chee. 

We got the Kalbi, very tender and full of flavor, dumplings, which were bigger than any others we tried in other places, chicken wings which was smothered a soy sauce with kim chee dipping sauce, a seafood kim chee soup and the best of all, the spicy tofu pork with kim chee. 

Of course we had to have white rice and there were at least eight little plates of various kim chee dishes. We did manage to eat it all and I added a fruity draft beer to help me wash it all down. I had had apricot beer before, and notice they had one on draft and that was my special added suggestion, it goes well with the spice of the kim chee.

As for the wings, I don't know what's in the sauce but it's so addicting! The chicken was crispy outside and tender inside as well. 

 We made a mistake in ordering the Soon Dubu from the tapas menu; we thought it was the regular soup with chili paste, veggies, and meat but it was really just tofu and beef soup with soy sauce to dip. To get the regular one, you can't order from the tapa menu!

We entered, and the restaurant was empty except for another large party of 8 or 9. To seat the other group (a group of college age kids), they moved two tables together. But they refused to do the same for us. Which was bizarre because we weren't a rowdy group or disagreeable, and we didn't have any young children with us. We sat down at two separate tables, and waited to see if someone else would offer to put us together as they did for the other group. After we waited for awhile, we got up and left. Very frustrating- especially because wheeling my grandfather in and out to go to another restaurant is very inconvenient. If a restaurant wants to succeed, they need to be accommodating- like, at the very least, allow families to eat together.

I was pleased to have their Korean Barley Tea; it was something that I missed dearly. I ordered my usual Cheese Don Katsu while my S/O tried the KFC and the kimchi fried rice. 

Trying the orders one by one, all that was going on in my mind was this: ""what in the world happened to them?""

My favorite Don Katsu came out burnt brown. One look at the pork and one could tell that it didn't quite look right. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and had a crack at it anyway. Rough, dry, really hard to bite into, and definitely not what it was years ago. I'm not one to send food back to the kitchen, but this was a meal that I just had to send away. The funny part is that after remaking the dish, it was still burnt. 

As for the KFC, I thought it tasted pretty good. However, that thought left my mind after having a few pieces. The chicken was drenched in way too much oil. Almost dripping for a few pieces. Made me sick. 

The kimchi Fried rice, to me, was one of the saving graces. Unlike the kimchi Fried rice in Japanese restaurants, Soyo turns the kimchi level up 3 notches. The Fried rice is literally almost orange, jam-packed with so much kimchi it leaves your mouth watering. Love it!",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,9,8,3,tkEv_PXrCGpzxp3DnJL6xw

5521098,2016-11-10,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 5/5
Soyo is a ""barstraunt"" and has that exact feeling with the decor inside the venue, along with a matching outdoor patio. The decorations remind me of the eighties in Korea, with an adorable retro television against the back wall. There are a lot of old books and comics which sprinkle a nice casual vibe. 

The whole venue is quite spacious. It has individual tables that are separated by metal awnings and walls which is a really attractive aesthetic but also offers a great amount of privacy if seated within the booths. The other tables that are situated in the center of the restaurant offer space but it can get loud in the area since it is intimate. 

FOOD: 3.2/5
I brought my parents to Soyo on this visit and we ordered three different dishes.

I had ordered the chadol bakhe buchu muchim, which is basically marinated thin slices rib eye with a side of chive salad. The salad was fresh and the dressing had a sort of sweet and sour flavor, which was delicious. However the salad lacked its namesake, buchu or chives. I had to dig around the salad to find the source of the sparse chives. Other than that, there was decent amount of meat and it was all cooked well. 

My mother ordered the soondae guk, or the blood sausage soup. This turned out to be a huge disappointment. Initially, we were surprised to see this as a new menu item and were hoping that the taste would be suitable. However the broth had a strong pork taste which means they did not soak the raw meat and let the blood drain. What seemed to be the worst was there were only four pieces of soondae and cost 12 dollars in total which I find ridiculous because at many locations they will give at least half and sometimes the whole sausage. 

Lastly, my father ordered the kamja tang, which is a stew with potatoes (kamja) and pork neck bone. This dish took forever to arrive, and the other two meals were brought way before this one. I typically like when all the dishes are brought out together, but that's simply preference. The fire was put on low when it arrived at our table, barely keeping the heat for the stew. There was a strong pork taste with this dish as well, but it was more subtle than the soondae guk.

SERVICE: 4/5
The server assigned to our table was attentive and very friendly, always refilling side dishes and checking up on us. We were able to get a water jug before it was emptied and were given napkins when requested. 

However, the other server seemed standoffish at first before he realized my mother and I were Korean speakers. That is a sort of disappointing action when I encounter that. Otherwise, he grew to be friendly and serve our table during our visit. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 3/5
I have been to Soyo plenty times in the past due to the closeness to my residence. I have watched management change many times, menus flip with different items, along with renovation within the restaurant itself. The reason I have not recently frequented this restaurant was due to a previous experience where I was given a horrible amount of attitude from a server. 

For today's visit, I would say the positives and negatives are about equal. I will attempt to give this restaurant another try just to be fair.",zn1klNeNLrk0XE1vF_l00A,2,0,3,Z2fiQOEi6MCIs6Xrn20cRg

This time, I would like to share several menu items while drinking alcohol beverages such as Soju or Macju(Beer) :P The service has been truly excellent by the friendly staffs.. They seem to always be on the move, efficient, and very polite people. 

**Corn Cheese-basically corn baked with a cheese sauce in a sizzling hot pan that makes it gooey, crunchy, sweet, and salty. Seems like they added some chopped onion, scallion, carrots, jalapenos(all kinds of veges), & panko bread crumbs(crunchy) for more flavors. It's a MUST-HAVE in the appetizer! 

**Starchy Potato Pancakes 'Kamja Jun'-It's under the special menu(written in Korean on the wall)and their Potato Pancakes were really tasty! This pancake is made out of fresh potatoes, instead of flour (it's more healthier). Because of this, the consistency and appearance of the pancake is quite unique, slightly chewy and almost translucent. The Potato Pancakes are the best served fresh off the pan so when it comes to your table, go ahead and enjoy it right away. Me and my friends really liked this dish the most out of any appetizers :) 

**Steamed Pork, Napa cabbage, & Oyster 'Bossam'-It's a cooked pork belly, you wrapped with nicely salted napa cabbage and tasty Bossam Kimchi. Bossam Kimchi is specially made for 'Bossam' and it's more sweeter and more vegetables(radish & fresh oysters) in there compare to regular Kimchi. For Bossam, Kimchi is not an option. It's one of main component to complete this dish. It also comes with Ssamjang sauce (bean paste with sesame oil & garlic) and Saeujeot (pickled fermented shrimp) that you can create you own style of Ssam!!! It really depends on your preference and this is how I like to eat my Bossam :) It can be really spicy so stay out of this dish if you can't handle the spiciness. 

**Fried Dumpling 'Kun mandu'-The server told us that they make their own version of dumplings at Soyo. The filling were clear noodles, ground beef, cabbage, scallion, onion, & firm tofu..It is best to eat immediately with vinegar-soy dipping sauce.",h0wxG2EiDLhgKjIzI8j2Mg,9,9,5,aKmsqVOFPzUhRczOz_NgdA

It's time we had a talk. I know we've had a long, lovely relationship, but it's not working out. I think we need to break up. Honestly, it's not me; it's you. I know, I know, I'm so mean, but you've changed. 

I remember back to when I first fell in love with you. Your cute little booths, your tasty banchan and my favorite bibimbap. I thought you were the ISH. 

I bragged to all my friends about how great you were and how they totally had to come check you out in person. I remember all the meals I shared with my friends here with you and how they all thought you were so unique and cool.

As time went on, I felt that something was wrong. The soups became blah and the once Kevlar killing chicken of delicious doom was just so-so. Don't tell me that you didn't see this coming. The last time I saw you, which was last week, I didn't even ask for a to-go box for my half eaten bibimbap. Soyo, you know that's my favorite, so clearly there's a problem.

I guess I knew the end was near when I went on that no food whatsoever fast for nine days back at the end of February. I was so happy to visit you and have you be the first thing I had coming off of my dry spell. Unfortunately, you let me down. 

Your banchan was swimming in MSG and it made my mouth, lips and throat itch, to the point I had to take my food to go and wash it off under the sink at home. I had to give my food a shower just to be able to eat it. I don't know why you got into the bad stuff, but seriously, why are you going to try to pass that off to me? You know how I feel about MSG usage. You're going to get yourself hurt and your usage is hurting other people. Soyo, why do you have to do this stuff? Ugh. It's so upsetting. 

Soyo, I really loved you and it pains me that we've come to this place in our relationship but I just can't take it anymore. I want you to get help. I want your dishes to have that vibrancy again. I want you to get off the bad stuff. I think you can make a total turn around, but don't think that this means we're getting back together. I really want good things for you and I enjoyed our time together, but it's time we went our separate ways.

All the best,
 Rachel 

P.S. your gamjajorim is the best I've ever had. ;-)

With your meal you are given Korean iced tea and traditional Korean sides.

We started with the dumplings which were large and had a nice sear on them.  The problem for me was the filling.  I am not a fan of onions and they were full of them.  Speaking of onions, we ordered the corn with cheese.  I expected corn and cheese, but not tons of onions.  The corn was sweet and I would have enjoyed it without the onions.  

We finished with the bibambap.  It was large and not bad, but I would liked to have had an uncooked egg instead of a fully cooked one inside.

The food was ok, but the service sucked.  It is not a large place...come around once in a while and check on your guests.",cFubXywYZHvmwwKb5spgQQ,1,1,3,jjfEzXtMYvkjdJTq8VD_JA
5752740,2014-10-17,5,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"Soyo is the place.  You take the crowd and the food from L.A. K-town, place it in a cleaner-than-LA space in Vegas, throw in some easy-on-the-eyes servers, and you have Soyo, the barstaurant.  This place is everything a Korean bar should be, and thankfully it's in Vegas.  Now only if it was closer to Summerlin...

First the spot.  Corner of a strip mall, interior with bench seats (my back no like) in center and walled booths on edge.  Outside patio with ample tables and metal seats.  Modern-ish, not quite-spartan décor.  K-pop loud enough to be heard without drowning out the conversations.  It's sufficiently bar-like except for the lack of TVs.  

Second the service.  This night there are 3 girls serving the entire place, with couple of bussers.  Girls are hot.  Service is all smiles and on-time, especially that one girl... she's really hot.  We get one dish that came out missing an ingredient, but it's corrected right away.  So spot-on service, or may be I'm just a bit biased here...  Nah, I probably would have said the same if it was 3 guys serving.  Except for the hot part.

Last the food.  We ordered a makgeolli for quaff, rabokki (ramen & ddeokbokki), and flat dumplings for eats.  It's a draft makgeolli, but I couldn't tell a difference.  Not sure if I'm supposed to, I just drink them and they're good.  Rabokki came without the ra, but was corrected quickly.  Great dduk, firm & chewy.  Very spicy, ample amount of fish cakes and 2 boiled eggs!  Good stuff.  Fried Mandu (dumplings) were filled with ground meat & vermicelli noodles.  Dipped into the ddeokbokki sauce, it's da bomb.

Place was packed inside & half-full outside when we got there, filled up full during the evening, and then was half-full by the time we left.  Lively crowd, good people-watching, and did I mention the servers?  Good times.

The cheeky metal beverage bowls are cute to drink from. The barely tea is a nice and refreshing departure from standard tap water.  I never know what I'm going to get so we just randomly order items. Most of them are all hits. I always get the Korean chicken wings to start since it's definitely a must-have item. I need to know how to make that yummy red sauce pronto! You can slather it on anything and it would be good. Matter of fact, I happened across these little fried rice roll skewers slathered in this sauce and it was oh so good! I forgot what they were called but I'm sure the really nice and cute waitresses can tell you. I've ordered the dumplings a couple of times which are good. I've had the grilled mackerel once before and it was ok. Probably can do without that....very basic seasoning most likely just S&P. Kalbi ribs are wonderfully flavored and not too fatty and grisly like some places. 

The latest and yummiest discovery was the spicy squid. It came wrapped in tinfoil swimming in a delicous sauce. The squid was grilled but still very tender. There were loads of roasted garlic in it which lent to the robust flavor and also some vegetables I enjoyed but can't recall. Anyway get this!

First off, the way the inside is decorated. They have lights hanging on the celling and cute little booths to sit in. Not sure what the theme was for the booths but they were cute and as if you're in you're own private room. They have complimentary Iced tea in a jug on the table with a big tea cup.

We ordered the bulgogi japchae, seafood soondooboo, and spicy pork ribs. The japchae was delish! It wasn't dry like other japchae's I've tried. But the ratio of veggies & noddles was more veggies than noddles. I wish they gave more. I give it a 8/10. The seafood soondooboo was really tasty! I was iffy about getting the soondooboo because of other yelpers saying how it tastes ""watered down"" but the seafood soondooboo was really delicious & good for it's price. I give it a 9.5/10. The spicy pork ribs was to die for!!! The sauce was sweet and spicy and it wasn't too spicy either. I would come back just for this! I give it a 10/10!

5781547,2010-12-09,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"My wife and I were here on a Sunday night at around 6PM. We saw the great reviews on Yelp, so we decided to check this place out. Due to the thin black lettering that is used for the sign, we almost missed the place, but all it took was a second glance.

There was only one other group when we got there, so the place was kind of empty; however, that was understandable since it was still early. We were prompty greeted by the host/server as we walked in. He guided us to a booth and served us some barley tea right away (hot or cold option).

My wife and I both really liked the feel of the place...I guess you could say it had a modern, loung-y feel to it. The place was dimly lit, but the blue neon lights hanging by the small bar in the corner gave everything a blue-ish tint (not a bad thing imo). Overall, it gave us the impression of something you'd walk into in one of those KDramas haha. Korean music was playing when we walked in, but it soon switched to American R&B, Hip-hop, etc. We would have preferred it stay Korean...but meh.

The menu was simple and straight-forward. We walked in already knowing what we wanted, so we didn't really look at it much. IIRC, the dishes are in Korean with English descriptions.

To be honest, the food took a while to come out (maybe 15-20 minutes), but we didn't really mind so much. After a bit, the food did we ordered did come out--Dolsot Bibimbap and Budae Jjigae, along with 5-6 various banchan.

I haven't been exposed to much Korean food beyond the typical AYCE Korean BBQ, but everything put in front of me tasted great. My wife (who *has* had her fair share of Korean food) commented that the Budae Jjigae here was the best she's ever had. She said that other places are usually bland and spicy...but the Budae Jjigae here was spicy AND full of flavor. Overall, really great dishes.

The host/waiter was great too. His grasp of English seemed fine, but he had an accent when speaking, so it was a bit hard to understand him at times (""lamen"" vs ""ramen""). This wasn't really a big deal since we're used to it, but I just wanted to mention it for those Yelpers that want to know. He had a lot of things going on (handling drinks, answering phone calls, taking orders, bringing out food...), so he wasn't always available to run over to our table right away, but we didn't really mind.

Anyhow, great place for some Korean grub if you're hungry. Being a ""Barstaurant"", they had drinks and stuff too, but we didn't get any. Our total bill came out to be about $32 after tax/before tip --we were stuffed and happy from the meal.",RL_Kk4QRqBwNL88uhN4o-A,0,0,4,6pJxKxRaCK7to-4Y6r8ASw

The set up makes you feel like you're in an actual Korean restaurant. 

Came here with my mom on a weekday and it was slow, but I think it's due to the fact that people come here to drink at night more than to eat. 

Came here based on my Korean friend's recommendation because I had wanted to try some actual Korean food rather than KBBQ all the time. 

The barley tea is sooo good. You drink them with a bowl too! 

Ordered:
-Fish Cake soup
-Spicy rice cake
-KBBQ

I enjoyed the fish cake soup, it was something new. 
The KBBQ was good as well

I was excited to try spicy rice cake for the first time and was disappointed. The portion size was huge and I barely ate it due to the fact that it was EXTREMELY sweet. There was no hint of spice. We couldn't handle the sweetness of the dish so it went to waste. (Btw, I've had better spicy rice cake experiences now in order to know that this place isn't right)

The portion sizes are great for the price you pay for. Although the KBBQ portion was a tad small.

We order the Pork Belly with Squid cooked on table, Beef Short Ribs and Vegetable Stew and Fried Dumplings with Special Dressing. The food came on a timely manner and we were started out with the Korean side dishes that usually is served in Korean restaurants. 

Friend Dumplings = 4 stars
It's not your traditional dumplings, the skin is made with rice flour it seems, and the inside is filled with rice noodles and ground meat, very flavorful.

Pork Belly = 4 Stars 
This is cooked on the table, and it has squid, pork belly, and soy bean sprouts. It's spicy for me but it was really good. The only down side about this dish as it cooks down it could get a little salty.

Beef Short Ribs = 5 stars! This is freaking amazing. The beef is so tender and flavorful, falls right off the bone and a non-spicy dish. This is so delicious! I would order this every time I go.

THE GOOD:
+ Quality, authentic Korean food
+ Generous portions
+ Fair pricing
+ Amazing vegetarian options
+ Complimentary barley tea (when dining in)
+ Bottomless side dishes with certain entrees
+ Super cute interior

THE BAD: 
- Service can be hit or miss
(While they're always generally friendly, it can be really slow sometimes) 


I RECOMMEND:
The cheese corn and fried rice cakes to start. While the corn is covered in gooey, cheesy, creamy goodness, the fried rice cakes come skewered, crispy and fried to perfection. It also comes coated in a delicious savory sauce with a great kick. 

For the main dish, I recommend the veggie bi bim bap topped with fish eggs. It comes sizzling hot in a stone bowl with veggies, shiitake mushroom, kimchi, and infused with sesame oil. If you want something more substantial, my boyfriend swears by the garlicky marbled beef which comes with a heaping side salad that's both delicious and addictive.

Although I have seen much older patrons having a late supper here as well.  Soyo which called itself a ""barstaurant"" has a menu that is dominated by Korean tapas, and rounded out by some items in the soup, entrees and casseroles categories, and of course beers, ales and ""cocktails"", which in Soyo-speak for flavored soju.

It is an establishment that is best visited with a decent size group of friends, as ordering food and sharing it family style is the best way and arguably the more cost-effective approach to enjoy Soyo's menu.  And having a Korean speaking friend is most helpful when ordering, as most items do not have English names, just descriptions or list of ingredients for each menu items. Below are menu highlights that our group have enjoyed in past visits.

Marbled Beef - Thinly sliced sautéed beef with onions with a slightly sweet flavor, served with Korean salads and dipping sauces.

Grilled Squid and Garlic  - Highly recommended for garlic lovers, as there are a lot of garlic in this appetizer presented in a foiled parcel.  The slightly sweet sauce is perfect with a side of rice.

Smelt Roe with Seaweed over Rice - served in hot stone bowl.  It is best to let the rice gets crispy by the super hot stone bowl, before mixing everything together and diving in.

Very Spicy Grilled Chicken with Mozzarella Cheese On Top - The two chilies warns you to avoid it if you can't handle the heat, because even at 'mild' it will still burn you at least once.  But it is a perfectly delicious dish for those that enjoy walks on the spicy side of life. 

Gop Chang Soup/Casserole - served with beef intestine, tripe, vegetables and noodles in a spicy broth.  This is best shared with 2 or more.

Boo Dae Soup/Casseroles - This became famous around US Army base in Korea, as it is an American fusion spicy broth made with ingredients (hot dogs, ham, cheese) that are available to US military personnel. Adding a side order of instant ramen noodles completes the authenticness of this item.

Anchovy Hot Noodle - noodle served in a mild anchovy broth, it was a surprisingly good and simple bowl hot noodle soup.

Interesting play on words, but fitting as this is quite an interesting place. 

I'll start off by describing the design and atmosphere of this new hip Korean joint. Soyo is located in the same plaza as the well-reviewed, Oyshi Sushi. In fact, these two places are under the same management, after having been acquainted with the manager and owners. As you walk inside the dimly light place, you'll find a main section in the middle, with booth-like seating arrangements. On each adjacent side, there are additional booths on elevated platforms which are a bit more private and sectioned off. Stacks of manga, cute ceramics, arcade game machines and other random pieces of rustic Korean decorations adorn this place, and it all works together in a 'cute' way. Save for the upbeat, bubbly, and techno-heavy K-Pop music they always seem to play (I'm Korean myself, just personal preference) this place is often lively and full of people enjoying themselves. 

Now, on to the important stuff. The menu at Soyo contains your usual Korean items such as soups, casseroles, noodle and meat entrees but they don't get too crazy in offering specific variations of each, or the whole Korean BBQ table-grill experience. Instead, the real winner and crowd pleaser here seems to be their offerings of ""street foods"". Soyo offers some items that I haven't been able to find in any other Korean kitchen outside my own mom's. Real standouts are the:

Buu Deh Jii Kae: Giant, spicy casserole of an unlikely combination of Spam, rice cake, onions, green onions and ramen noodles brought out and cooked on the table. 

Spicy Pork Belly Casserole: Sliced pork belly, bean sprouts and other veggies cooked in similar fashion as mention above. 

Dduk Bbokki: spicy rice cake and ramen noodles

Chicken Wings: Korean style drummettes, served plain or slathered in a sweet, spicy, sesame seed topped sauce. Served with pickled Daikon cubes. 

I could name a few more, but I'm having a hard time remembering them correctly because I keep salivating over the Spamcakemen goodness. 

Obviously, the aforementioned dishes are really truly meant to be enjoyed slowly, with some friends and of course, alcohol. Aside from the usual Hite/OB light beer and plain soju, Soyo offers rice-wine, top quality spirits & cocktails, and a respectable beer selection for those beer connoisseurs. Which warrants bonus points for pleasing a beer snob like me. 

All in all, Soyo is not what you'll be expecting if you're searching for the finest in Korean cuisine or looking to fill up on barbecued Kalbi and Pork Belly. Instead, it's a great place to hangout with friends on a mellow night over some good Korean soul food and liquor. Don't shy away, it's worth checking out at least once. 

Plus, how can you not want to try a placed called a Barstaurant?",k-35KEBzHxuchfV8Y2WdjQ,5,2,4,3ijyhsQAsA8xufjRqRrG5w

Very clean, but still retains that modern ""grungy"" Korean Bar feel...food is very decently priced, especially since everything is so darn yummy!! Only weird thing was that we literally got checked up on by EVERY employee and manager and cleaning people...meaning we got asked if we needed anything every 5 minutes or so, and people watched our dishes like a hawk and took it away once empty, which made me feel like i had to eat faster so they could stop looking and take it away. Never really thought that would be an issue, but it was a bit awkward after a while. 

The food that we got were all delicious--its rare to find a place that has decent gochujang (most in Cali are watered down and way too sugary)--but this has it! The fried rice cake is yum, as was the galbijjim. To be honest, I've had better cheese corn, but I'm not complaining! The cold noodle (nangmyun) was also a favorite of ours...soondae was only so-so, but once again, good enough to make me happy so whatevs!

We are DEFINITELY coming back here on our next trip to Vegas...I'll be missing it til then!",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,6,10,5,0jdVQHOnGfsXLauHoHH7LA

The vibes here are super fun! Perfect place to come hang out with a group of friends to eat and drink. We had the kimchee pancake to share (definitely recommend), and I really enjoyed the seafood tofu soup.

They were blasting trance music when we came in to eat at 3, so make sure you have a certain expectation. I like that they have little cubbies for tables- makes the group dynamic more fun. There is a very small bar to sit at (maybe 4 seats?), but the food's so good, you shouldn't pass it up.

So many more new restaurants on the east side! I like the late hours here, and if I still lived in Vegas, I would add this place to the rotation.",F_e2MV6xhDnW4hsZav496g,2,2,4,xLWnbfqkZYarv9dkpkN_1Q
5937028,2012-06-06,2,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"We just tried kyochon chicken in LA and it left us craving for more here in Vegas, unfortunately they do not have one here so we decided to look for a place that offered Korean chicken wings. I decided on Soyo after reading the reviews and seeing that it was 4 stars. Overall the experience itself was not horrible, but the food was not up to par for my palate. We ordered the 2 kinds of chicken wings, the garlic and the special one. The chicken had a slight stenchy after taste that chicken gives off if not properly handled (my nose is super sensitive), the taste ok, nothing really to rave about. Also FYI the side orders are not included when you order only ""tapas"" (appetizers) re: chicken wings, but if you must have them it is $3 more. I then decided to order my favorite bibimbap, unlike many though I prefer mine cold and not in a stone pot, which I had requested them to do. The bibimbap was a disappointment as well, I mean I never would've thunk that they put lettuce in this dish? And the meat was ground meat, and a handful of nori which made my dish smell fishy, I doused it with hot sauce and it still lacked in flavor. Unappetizing. Well at least I got my $3 side dishes which I spent $10 for (the cost of bibimbap) but alas that too was blah... The kimchi unsavory, the only thing i like was the glass noodles with mayo and broccoli, the rest I did not even bother trying, some black beans, and radish dish. The only salvation for this meal was the free iced barley tea drink and the pickled radish that came with the wings.  Now maybe it's not really fair to judge this place based on just these three dishes, but if you ask me WILL I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE? I would say NO. WILL I COME BACK? That is a NO as well.... Unless somebody else drags me there and pays for it. But aside from the food though...I really did love the ambiance, even their outdoor patio setting, really reminded me of Korean drama series, I mean it probably is a great place to hang out and get wasted, maybe then you can't really tell how bad the food is.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,2,2,2,KZgMxqcRWV5zPwWdvD2dyA

5959676,2011-11-16,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,"I have been hearing about this place for ages and have never gotten around to going until last weekend. I came here with two of my girl friends and we decided to share several dishes between the three of us. 

We ordered the seafood stew, spicy chicken wings and appetizer order of the mackeral. All the food was incredibly flavorful and the amount of food you get for the price is fantastic. We were stuffed by the end of the meal and very content. The staff was pretty friendly and gave us great suggestions on what to order to help round out our meal. We didn't try any of the drinks on this occasion, but I hear they are fantastic. I look forward to trying them again on my next trip. 

I enjoyed the seating quite a bit as well. The booths we very closed off and private which creates a very good environment for conversing with your dining companions. 

I'll definitely be back.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,4,DPtmruaTTSTS1mgg9lh0HQ
5967472,2013-07-22,0,gTw6PENNGl68ZPUpYWP50A,Lychee soju gets 5 stars but it really should be kept chilled! There are a lot if asian kids that come here that are extremely loud. They have a lot of spicy or sou dishes. We ordered a bunch of things and they were ok. The garlic chix wings were good. The katsu was overcooked and hard to chew. I had to chew it for a while before it was safe to swallow. The eggs and spam dish would be a great dish for breakfast. Service started off slow and cold but a few other servers redeemed the server points. This place is small even with the patio area. Not sure if this place is worth the long drive from north las vegas.,Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,0,0,3,kAZdYdQ16nUKLfOVZSyKMw
