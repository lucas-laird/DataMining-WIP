I've been wanting to go here for so long and finally did, which was majorly disappointing. I ordered a chili relleno entree which included rice and beans. I also ordered a tamale on the side. Accompanied by a family member, she also ordered a similar entree with a side dish. Considering portion size, this place doesn't disappoint. Everything else? It heavily does. 
There was absolutely NO flavor in any of the food. My chili relleno was ice in the middle and had a strange taste, which implied that it wasn't made fresh and most likely brought in frozen. I wouldn't argue if their other food was ""prepared"" the same way. This explains how our food came out quickly, wasn't even hot and tasted heavily of just salty refrigeration. 
I glanced over at other cutomers' plates and everything just looked the same...uniform, flavorless and just overall, no excitement. Chapala's serves traditional mexican food but in the worst ways possible. There's nothing fresh here, no exuberant colors and flavors jumping out at you when tasting these foods. Just cold, old and dead. I could say the same about the atmosphere as well as our waitress, who had the most odd-like personality I've ever encountered at a restaurant. No greetings, smiles or even explanations of anything, let alone talking. 

This place is dead, which also explains their 44 demerits they have just recently were closed for. I feel sick just thinking about it now.",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,3,1,1,NR0LYMhhqWzZdMRnAJxx8Q

I nearly always start off with a bowl of their albondigas soup which is outstanding.  The wait staff are friendly and do a good job, especially when they get to know you.  The receptionist who is also the cashier is a bit cold until she gets to know you.  We've taken guests there and they, too, always enjoy Chapala's.

342333,2011-08-09,1,0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw,"My husband and I like to consider ourselves Mexican food aficionados. As our favorite type of cuisine and my husband from San Diego, we find there are not too many good Mexican ""sit down"" restaurants in Vegas. Yah...you can go with these people who don't know true good Mexican food and join the ""Vegas Michoacan"" bandwagon with their ridiculous prices and bad food OR you can eat at Chapala's delicious food and enjoy their great prices.  My husband and I frequent Chapala's and love, love their beans. Good Mexican food is all about good beans for us and they hit the mark. The rice is tasty as well. I always get the enchiladas or ground beef taco, or both! The enchilada sauce is my style - not too red, more of an orangey color and lots of cheese...sometimes a special surprise...hot and gooey cheese that has snuck its self under the rice! I am not sure about the unfriendly service people state on here, we have never experienced it - maybe it is just one server and we have never had that one?? They are always pleasant and the food comes out super fast. Their prices rock! Under $9 for a 2 item combo and under $8 for a 1 item combo! The chips are always good and warmed...One complaint, they are definitely lacking in the salsa department. The mild tastes like plain tomato sauce. I do like the hot chunky salsa, sometimes super hot. My trick is to spoon some of the hot into the mild and it makes a good salsa! I will forgive them for the not so great salsa because of the excellent tasting beans and enchiladas!",Y-sW-k-vT3jXCfYoOZLt5w,1,1,5,1R0Yi7sOhMnwe1pOZ4laSg

1. Service: Our waitress was surly, and downright rude.  She did, however, keep the only palatable thing filled...our drinks.
2. Chips and salsa: The one thing you continue munching no matter how full you are. This was definitely not the case. Chips were ok, but the salsa was so salty that it was completely inedible.
3. Entrees: My friend had the fish tacos and said they were ok.  I had an easy combo platter...cheese enchilada and chile relleno. The enchilada was over soaked with sauce which turned the tortilla to glue and the cheese was cold. The relleno had it's entire seed core still inside which was not cool to bite into. We informed our waitress who simply brought us the bill and made no offer to take my uneaten food off of it.

Enchilada
Chile relleno 
Burrito 
Taco 
Tamale
Your choice of meats are chicken, shredded or ground beef, and pork. A 2 item combo is $12.50 and the 3 item is a dollar more. 

I LOVE the Chile rellenos. That is my favorite thing on the whole menu. I get them almost every time. I don't really care for the burritos or tacos but the fajitas were good. Like every place they have some good and some bad. The chips and salsa are probably my least favorite things. The chips are bland they have no salt and the salsa just taste like tomato sauce.

As soon as we walked in, we were seated right away. I was craving the authentic Mexican dish, which is why we came here. Before ordering, they bring you chips and salsa (one mild salsa and one hot salsa), so you don't really need to order any appetizers. Score! For my main dish, I had the mojarra with rice and beans. It's basically a HUGE fish (in which I did finish by the way), and rice and beans. Love that dish! You can never go wrong with it. My boyfriend ordered the camarones a la Diablo. It's a dish with shrimp covered in this spicy sauce, ay ay caliente! My boyfriend likes his food spicy, so he really enjoyed it. For drinks we just had horchata. But the great thing about their drinks here is that.....they give FREE REFILLS!!! Yes that's right, you definitely get your money's worth, and they don't try to jip you by charging for refills.

It's located centrally which is pretty nice - not in the best neighborhood, but easy access to the freeway.

I should've known that this place was going to be a disaster from they're chips and salsa. One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. 

When our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre.

The restaurant was probably 1/4 full, which always makes me feel weird. I love excellent service as much as the next person, but when servers have too much time on their hands, they hover and it creeps me out. Thankfully, a minimum of hovering here. The complementary chips & salsa were tasty. The chips tasted fresh. There were two salsas: a hot and a mild. They were not kidding about the hot, but it was really good, so I continued to torture my poor tongue :)

Boyfriend got beef enchiladas. They were swimming in sauce and the filling was all beef (no veggie overload in there!). I had the carne asada tacos. Oh wow, were they delicious. They reminded me of street tacos: well-marinated meat with diced onions and cilantro. Nothing else was needed! Highly, highly recommended entree.

2462789,2012-07-26,1,0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw,"How I missed reviewing this place in my Yelping escapades is beyond me. 

Bold statement in 3...2...1....Chapala's is the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas...I know, I just blew your mind. But seriously, the food is that good. It's a staple dining option in the Jason L. household.

WARNING, please do not let the following statement deter you from going. Their salsa is below average. If they had great salsa I might give them a bonus star. Not sure why, it's pretty generic mild & hot soupy salsa. An improvement here and this would be a huge bonus.

I've eaten various things on the menu, my favorite would have to be the Enchiladas Ranchera. The creamy white sauce they use is awesome, and hard to find elsewhere. Always cooked to perfection. They have outstanding beans and rice to compliment the entree. Service is generally very good. If your not feeling the Enchilada vibe then go a little lighter with the Grampa Tostada. You have the option of a meat (chicken is juicy, moist, and you receive a generous portion). Their traditional enchiladas and tacos are also excellent. Ground beef always has great flavor and their enchilada sauce isn't weird (you know what I mean, that mole/cinnamony strange sauce we all come across from time to time). 

Another warning and tip...they offer coupons in the LV Review Journal on Wednesday's in the Taste Section and Friday's in the Night & Day pull out. *warning* They will not accept the coupon if it's not presented prior before placing your order. Do not test them, they have signs (every-friggin-where).",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,7,2,5,Ma75uM_PPceslSwIJIiw0A

We wanted to go get burgers at Ichabod's, but they were only serving lobster.  We were in a rush to get home and try the merlot I'd bought for the occasion, so we ended up here.  It's a place I've driven by countless times and have heard rave reviews about, but it was just mediocre.

We had to wait for quite some time until we were seated, and when we were the service proved to be pretty slow.  The chips and salsa were brought out and since I absolutely can't resist chips and salsa I drove right in.  Minutes later I was still sitting there with my mouth on fire and no drink.  We had to ask for them again.

My enchiladas suizas were good, but the tortilla was mushy as if the plate had been sitting under a lamp for a while, and the sauce was more of a sour cream than an actual cream sauce.  My dining partner enjoyed his selection (I can't remember exactly what it was) but like me he didn't have any rave reviews.

First of all, the menu covers just about every option for which I could hope when going to a Mexican restaurant. Page after page of different combinations, different menu items - I give that a big thumbs up. However, it's not all about the menu; the food has to be good. So, we ordered (I got the combo plate of enchiladas and a tamale), and hoped for the best.

So many Mexican restaurants here use, for their enchilada sauce, that Ortega crap right out of the salty little can. Not Chapala's. Nope - this was clearly homemade by someone who knows how enchilada sauce should taste. At least, that's what the red sauce was. The green sauce was another story altogether. That appeared, fully formed, from the mind of a benevolent God who wants us to be happy. If I wasn't full to the point where taking a breath makes me pee a little, I'd sit down with a pitcher of that green sauce and just drink it.

I like a wet burrito and the Chile Relleno that comes with soup or salad. I also like the Capala's chicken which is a rotisserie chicken that is flas fried to make it crisp on the outside. In the summer I really like the Ensalada Grampa which is fresh greens with a mayonnaise sauce and pulled pork which is chilled to perfection. Tasty and cool in a hot Las Vegas Summer. The Ice tea is rich ans strong and these people know how to make a delicious Flan. The parking is ample and the ambiance ios good. for the price of the meals you can't beat it.

I am always a bit nervous about how these can turn out, but I thought what the heck go for it! A really good Mexican restaurant is tough to find... not quite sure why, but even in vegas I was struggling. They had me order a burrito with pork and a side of ""verde sauce"" in a bowl. I think it is the same thing that was in the burrito..... I recall them saying it was #60 on the menu. You pour the sauce over the burrito. I have to admit, that I would have never ordered this on my own... but I have to tell you that this was the best Mexican Dishes I have ever had... it was absolutely delicious! The pork fell apart and the juice was phenomenal! Not a scrap left on the plate. They also ordered me a large margarita that was very good as well.

3 Stars for Taste

Chapala's Mexican Restaurant has been around for years.  According to the waiter, they recently moved to this location to here.  The prices here are pretty good.  For $13, you can get their 3 item combo which also includes rice & beans. I chose their Chicken Taco, Chicken Enchilada, and Chili Relleno.  Tough for me to say it wasn't good because I demolished it.  All items were good, but nothing that really sets them apart from all other dine in Mexican Restaurants.  Besides, I still prefer your hole in the wall type south of the border stops. 

Food came out quick and this was probably due to the fact that we were the only guest here. I can't imagine how this place is when it's busy.  Service here was okay and with lunch comes free chips with salsa.  The basket for the chips is small, but refills are free.

Rather than going to one of the abundant taco shops we chose a casual dining experience. Chapalas was reasonably close and not located within a smokey casino. So in we went.

There was four of us and we were seated right away. Almost surprisingly considering it was Friday night and the parking lot was packed. Before we even looked at the menu we asked if we could split the check 4 ways. The waitress seemed a little uncomfortable but said she could do that. Big thanks to her for that.

We each ordered combos. I was too busy talking to know what anybody else ordered. But I ordered a taco and tamale combo. There was nothing overly special about any of it. The taco was in a preformed shell and stuffed with ground beef, lettuce and cheese. The flavors were fine but it was greasy. There were a lot of refried beans on the plate which I don't usually care for but these were good enough that I ate them all. The rice was standard Mexican rice which I am absolutely fine with. Its my favorite kind of rice. The tamale was disappointing. The sauce had little flavor. Same with the chicken which there was much of. But the worst part, the masa has been dried out to the point of being crispy. How does a food that is steamed before being doused in sauce come out crispy? My guess, it had been lying in wait before they prepared it for my plate. A reminder of why it had been several years since I last ate here.

As for the rest of the group, the seemed to enjoy their meals very much. They took home their leftovers, what little bit there was left. I am happy they enjoyed it.

Before we left, our waitress did split the check four ways. She broke it all down and wrote the prices on napkins for each of us. Two paid with cash. Two with cards. We were each brought individual receipts when all was said and done. It was cool of the restaurant to do that for us. My family walked out years ago when they refused to split the check. This time though, their accomodation was much appreciated. Four stars for the service. Minus one for the food I wish I could have enjoyed more.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,e7qG0G5Mw7czyTJJuUxNpg

I really like the ambiance here. It's not dark (think dungeon) like the other one (Decatur), and it feels festive, in here, but not overdone (my favorite for ambiance is casa don juan btw). The tables, chairs, and booths are spaced just right (though we always get seated next to a loud talking person, go figure, almost like they want other people to hear their life stories, had to tune them out, though). In other words, it doesn't feel cramped in here. 

The people working here are very nice and inviting (smiles and greetings). Our server was pretty good. There is another person tending to the drink refills, but I don't think she speaks much english and is a bit timid. The hostess is very welcoming. This is a Entertainment Book participant (BOGO). The prices are very good too.  

The salsa is very good here. I love the spicy salsa- mmm, and my husband likes the regular one (he can't do spicy). So, you get two kinds of salsa with chips (careful, so easy to over do it, before you know it, you're not hungry anymore). I usually get the fish tacos but I really wanted ceviche this time (shrimp and crab, served with tostados and sliced avocado). The ceviche is served in a bowl, and is tasty, but I needed to add Tapatio, for some heat. I also added some spicy salsa, too. I didn't finish it- I took the rest home. My husband usually gets a burrito (but it had all the things he dislikes) but he surprised me by getting the fish tacos (2), served with rice, and beans. He really liked it. I had a bite too, but it's my go-to dish, so it wasn't a new thing for me.

We specifically asked for separate checks, the server said no problem...when we went to check out the young girl just pointed to the sign and said we don't spilt checks...I let her know the server told us it was ok (as we asked him at least twice) but she just shrugged her shoulders and said Nope. So since we didn't have an itemized check we couldn't even do the math, it was the most frustrating check out I have ever had! 

So make sure you have cash and remember what you order and the price if you have a group.

This has been a restaurant that me and my family starting with my grandparents we come here at ever trip to Vegas. The food is amazing no matter what you get. But I have to say that the check out girl and not accommodating your customers made all of us reconsider coming back the next day with our group. Bad customer service and it's so disappointing!

We normally have the same 2 servers. A female or Mr. Potato Head (sorry, but that is exactly who he looks like).  He had been a little rude on occasion, but we overlooked it.  The last straw was when my co-worker and I went there for lunch and Mr. Potato Head, the female server, the owner, and the cashier were standing at the cashier's counter when we walked in.  When we walked in everyone at the counter looked at us. Maybe a minute went by then the female server gestured to Mr. Potato Head to seat us.  He would not turn around, he kept talking to his coworker and said something in Spanish to the female server.  You could tell by the expression on the female server's face that whatever the comment was by Mr. Potato Head wasn't nice because it made her facial expression change.  She then grabbed 2 menus and gestured as if to say ""come on, I'll seat you.""  We sat for a couple of minutes, Mr. Potato Head passed our table, kept walking and did not acknowledge us.  He later came back and asked what would we like and we ordered.  YES!, I felt some kind of way about it and so did my co-worker. They should appreciate their customers. This experience, coupled with the other times of rudeness made it all too obvious to us that he did not welcome or want our business.

Never a yes, always a no we can't mentality. Just not a good vibe from the staff. Dining with friends is supposed to be a good time, not an unpleasant one. 

Food was edible but not worth a return. The burritos were ok, not much to them, it was like there was a lack of food love by the chef. The plates that my frieds ordered looked like baby puke and you could even tell that is was a quesadilla. It was smimming in everything around it. 

I won't be recommending this place to people and if they mention that they are going I will say don't go, go to XYZ, service it much better and so is the food. 

I am not a picky eater, nor a food snob, but this place is not worth the time or money that you spend there.

My first ever Taco Tuesday was here.  Went with a LOT of rowdy people and the place was seemingly cool with the huge loud crowd, and even was able to seat us (I'm talking like 50 people).

I got a meal #27, don't remember exactly what it was but it included tacos and beans and was pretty epic-tasting.  The meal combo seemed so perfect that all of my friends got the #27 and loved it just as much.  However, my friend Greg did not get the #27 and was temporarily shunned for doing so. 

The chips are epic, as was the salsa and the interior decor.  

Also epic are their margaritas (and from what I remember, cheap too).  There is a seperate bar area you can go to get away from your crowd and order drinks.  Bar is especially cool because there are pictures of el guapo and wooden ships to look at while you order/drink.

Their new location has no fountain or large golden rooster, but the food  is still just as good as it's always been. 

Chapala's service is pretty good it just depends on which waiter or waitress you get. But if you get one of the good servers they will be quick to get you your drinks, chips and salsa and of course your order. I will say no matter how busy they are the food comes out fast and tasty. 

Some of my favorite things to order are the Taco Salad. It's huge and comes with all the yummy Mexican items you want. I love to get it with chicken. It's marinaded in a red sauce that mixes in with the salad. Yum!! When I was younger I'd love to get the special with the two Chicken Burritos enchilada style of course. My friend and I would order this eat one and take the rest home for when we had the munchies later. On my most recent visit I had the ala cart Pork Tamale in a red sauce. The masa was flavorful and soft and the red sauce had a great spice. Plus, it was covered in gooey cheese. Basically I haven't had a bad meal here.

I wasn't really all that impressed with the food the first time I went there.  It was just your mediocre Mexican food menu.  My first time I ordered Enchilada with chicken and beef.  Nothing to be impressed about since it tasted like any other.  

My co-worker loves this place.  So we've been coming here from time to time for lunch.  I have to admit, the reason why I keep coming back is because of what my co-worker orders, Flautas.  These are so good.  As we keep coming here, the food kept getting better.  Maybe they fired the old cook, or the cook is getting happier and happier.  Getting laid maybe?  Okay, that was inappropriate.  But, the Flautas are awesome here.  The crispiness of the wrapping combined with the tenderness of the meat is something no one should miss out on.

Something you can do without here is their guacamole and chips.  Chips seem like they're re-used.  What I mean by that is if there are left over chips from a table, seems like they'll put it back in the chip bin, reheat it,  and put it in another bowl for another customer.  The guacamole is too smoothie like consistency.  I like 'em chunky.  

As for service, it's just like any other restaurant that have monotony to it.  You sit down, they'll bring out water.  Then they'll ask you if you want anything other than water to drink.  After the drink, they take your food order.  When you get your food, they'll give a courtesy walk by to see how you're doing.  It's very monotonous.  No personality really.  Maybe I'm just being picky.

If I'm gonna eat there again, it would only be for the Flautas.  If I lived around there, I would just order the food to go and eat it at home.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,0,0,3,TJvdCJCiip1n8ygcUMV4IQ

First of all, why is every Mexican restaurant in Vegas DEAD when you walk in? It's depressing!

Steak inside the burrito WAS tasty, but everything else was mediocre to bad. Guac was the fake bag kind. Gross. 

Salsa was craptacular, but the chips were good.

The chips & salsa are fresh and amazing! Their albondigas soup is so awesome! I love the #45 (enchiladas w/green sauce) and truthfully I've never had anything else here. Hunny tried the carne asada special and the steak is cooked perfectly! It is so tender he can cut it with a butter knife! Their guacamole is really mild and tastes great and of course their margaritas are to die for! Worth the trip all the way from Summerlin to get this yummy goodness! Grab a bag of chips & salsa to go, you will love it!",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,0,0,5,vqpIDr1rEaflUQbNPlh8-w

The food here is pretty typical Mexican food. Certainly a lot better than Taco Bell or Del Taco, but nothing special. It was good, hot, and generous in size--I couldn't finish mine. The waiter was prompt and efficient and there were several beers to choose from. 
As a value, this is a good choice of place to go. You will get a good meal for a fair price and have good service. For a lot of restaurants, that would be a lot to expect but here is it what I got. This is a good place for lunch and I would certainly return. It's just a good, everyday eatery.",ElqtFedDDqa3og3nQY2Amg,2,0,3,xKiLtr73T3DkGYCVv5FcYw
5672234,2012-12-05,0,0G1y7uV7w1D2uziS4Lt_Dw,"The only reason they get two stars is the server we had was great. He was very personable and made us feel welcome.

To take a page from Jason L... Bold statement in 3...2...1.... Chapala's is some of the WORST Mexican food I have ever consumed. I may be a Gringo, but my palette is very well versed in Mexican food of every quality.

It started out like any other night, in decision about what and where to eat. I had brought my wife home her favorite meal of all time, so her input was somewhat tied to how awesome her dinner was. It was all on me.

We left the house a bit like Crocodile Dundee, just on a drive-about to let my steering wheel and stomach lead the way. 

Again, I have lived on the East side of Vegas off and on for years and years. I have seen Chapala's more times than I can recall. It seemed packed most evenings and weekends, figured it was time to stop in. Pulling into the parking lot, I wondered if they were still open, as it was empty. Never fear, the 'Open' sign was illuminated, time to eat!

We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated. The tables were all covered in some thick, leather table cloths with trim, paper napkins were folded into little tents and the booths had a similar leather pattern to the table cloth. 

Perusing the menu, I admired the width and breadth of their offerings. I had not read reviews, so the only warning I had that their prices were pretty high was the aforementioned leather decor.

Our server came by to take our drink orders and was very friendly. A few moments later a female runner brought out the drinks and seemed very put off by the fact we were there.

Chips and salsa were brought out and we dove in to what is usually a much anticipated part of a meal. As others have mentioned, their salsa is garbage. The ""chunky"" salsa is spicy for the sake of being spicy without flavor or good consistency. The other salsa was just like cold, lightly seasoned tomato soup. On a positive note, the chips weren't bad, just yearning for some good salsa to dip them in.

Deciding on a three part combination, I ordered and we waited for the food to come out. It didn't seem to take too long for the soup to come out, I let the wife have it and she only had a couple bites. Normally, she is not as picky as me, except when the food isn't that good.

My dinner was delivered. At first glance, it looked amazing, tacos, enchilada and rice almost overflowing onto the table. Then, I looked closer. The taco shells were Taco Bell, from a box, hard shell tacos. Seriously? You ask us to pay this much for premade taco shells? Then I took a bite and was again disappointed and shocked. Yet another Mexican restaurant using canned chicken. No joke, go to the grocery store, next to the tuna, you will see canned chicken. That is what Chapala's uses. Flavorless, dry, a little tough and with that ""fresh from a can pink hue"" that we all love so much. 

Fortunately, there was enough extra enchilada sauce, I was able to use it like taco sauce to add some moisture to the chicken, to make it tolerable. I finished the tacos and went after the enchilada. While it too had the same from a can chicken, the sauce and melted cheese made it tolerable. Their enchilada sauce was quite delicious.

For close to $20, I got sub-par, un-fresh, pseudo-Mexican food. Extremely disappointing. There are so many good Mexican places in town that I don't see as busy as this place gets. I don't get it.

As mentioned before, our server was great, he talked with us some, was very friendly and personable. Also, I ordered an iced tea but didn't need a refill, so he took it off the tab! No reason, just removed it. That was an unexpected surprise when looking at the check.

Also, the enchilada sauce was very good. So I'll bump them a second star for that. However, if not for the server, 1 star may be a bit much, just for some sauce over canned food.

Next time, I will be going just about anywhere but here.

One final note, as we were walking out the door, saw they had a flyer posted on the door asking people to review them on a list of review sites. Well, they're getting what they asked for, maybe they should be a bit more careful about that.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,2,1,2,D6qqE8wlP6-7ylii8ik2bA

As Horrible Smokers, we're always happy to find a place that has an outdoor patio, and Chapala's is even located in the shade! The bartender takes and delivers food orders on the patio, and even though he had a pretty busy bar that day we waited for nothing. Nice guy.

The food here is always good. Not eye-rolling fantastic, but solid and yummy. Make sure to order the 'fresh made' guacamole rather than the regular stuff...it's worth the extra buck.

Also, Mr. Bartender guy makes a mean Godfather Margarita.",6XO9sx-kktvBE_9FlI5G5w,1,0,4,_wZDuoU2pCUYrCw7CaM8EQ

It's not very often I rate something this low just because I give points for effort but it's like this place stopped caring and started serving crap! I ordered a taco chili relleno and enchilada combo the only edible item on my plate was the enchilada.  My husband ordered the fajitas and it came on a not a fajita plate just a regular plate with lettuce and pico it was a very sad excuse for a fajita meal! Don't waste your time money or gas going to this place! Oh and to top off crappy food the service is just as bad as the food!,6Y-aPujVXGDF3eMrhJybug,1,0,1,tYlkhMQ_dVW9Ylme3dUO2w

Our server was friendly and we ordered the carne asada to share and snacked on chips and salsa while we waited. The chips weren't anything special and I found the salsas to be particularly unappealing. They were watery and had a sweetness that I didn't enjoy. 

Our meal came and it was plenty large enough to share. The meat was tough and had lots of fat bits I had to eat around. The rice and beans were decent, though.

The server was very attentive and refills were plentiful. I don't think I would be interested in coming back, but they seem to have faithful clientele.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,5,2,n5KWaMnYn2T0M0wYc60pzQ
