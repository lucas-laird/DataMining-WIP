The meat was thought to my taste but the chilaquiles with green sauce tasty as ever. My fianc√© has the huevos con carne with chorizo which was awesome.

We were so happy we stubled upon this place via yelp.  When I called in our order the man who took the order was friendly but I have to admit we were a little afraid that he didn't understand where our office was located.  Well 45 minutes later we had a delivery guy show up with our food and menus.  The food was so good.  My co-worker ordered a Carne asada Taco and chips and salsa and I ordered a carne asada burrito.  We both agreed the meat was good and not fatty and it was seasoned well. We are so happy we found a new place that we can order from. :),OK_vkRR2nO1cNWV5NGtoEA,2,0,5,oiQTjuGXXDZI_UE-I5h4cA

1139186,2015-01-07,2,Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig,"Wait ... it can't be true ... I get to be the first one to review this great place?  Well, we'll see when this posts ...

Anyhow, if you are in Las Vegas for the museums, at some point you'll hit those on Industrial, like the Elvis-a-Rama -- what?  it's closed? don't let *that* stop you -- and the Erotic Heritage Museum (oh, not *your* heritage? okay ...); and when you are hungry, slide up just a bit further to the north (why is Downtown to the north?) and stop by this great restaurant.

I think it's Mexican.

Whatever, the food is really, really good.  Try the tacos.  Really, really good.  Everything reasonably priced.  Just head to the counter and order up.  They'll bring it up to you.  Yes, the place looks like a set from a Tarantino movie, but the people there are friendly and -- did I mention this already? -- the food is really, really good.  You'd imagine that it was made by a celebrity chef.  But you'd know it wasn't because you can afford it, and don't have to con yourself into thinking that you like small portions at high prices.

By the way, what's up with the little residential neighborhood between this place and, say, the Stratosphere?  The streets with all of the city names:  Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, New York ... until I came upon Cleveland, I figured it was the set of all cities pre-1953 with baseball teams in both the American and National Leagues.  Still, no Oakland or Atlanta or ....  no, I guess there is a Baltimore.  Never mind ....

Also, why get a so-so room for one night at, say, the Venetian, for $425, when for that money you can get a full month -- move in that day -- at the Boston Garden ... and take half your meals at Las Delicias.  You suppose they have a line-cutting card?",zacgWsLkuYFHJHA6q8VxWQ,2,4,5,WI6Gou7XhkFz5EflfXt7gQ

The review Patty left is crazy because I had the complete opposite encounter. We went in around 1:30 and there are only two ladies working, the cook and the server. She told us hello and to sit wherever we wanted. We sat and she came up and spoke to us in a friendly manner, we order WATER, HORCHATA, and some Mexican cokes. A few minutes later she came out with all of our drinks and took our order. I ordered a carne asada gordita, sans beans, and some fries and my BF orders a Cali burrito.

Now, Yelp guidelines are pretty... flexible, I never cuss in my reviews, but an email I received said they like for the reviewers to express their passion, so, I'm going to do just that.

THE CARNE ASADA IS MOTHERFUCKING AMAZING. IT'S THE BEST FUCKING CARNE ASADA to come out of a little shop. It's HELLA FUCKING better than Tacos el Gordo, and any other carne asada out of a small resto just blows dicks compared to this one! And guess what? You want fucking taco Tuesday? or like us beaners, taco any day? Come here! Tacos are 1.35$, wait bitch, did you just say $1.35?? For a fucking street taco?! YAAAASSS BITCH! Come get some delicious, juicy meat, in a small tortilla and put that shit down your throat, just like some other meat, you booches! 

Anyway, out food was super delicious, and priced oh so right. You definitely get your fill. Burritos are huge just like my boyfriends... dimples. And the gordita is just like me, juicy and delicious. One will def do! The free chips and beans are a nice touch!

This isn't some opulent resto, this is a mom and pop owned hole in the wall. Don't expect a cloth napkin and them to lick your ass. Support them!

I ordered two Chorizo sopes and they were really good. The chorizo was seasoned well and the corn patties had a nice crunch to them. The beans were ok but the rice was awesome. I also tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was great.",PcvbBOCOcs6_suRDH7TSTg,3,4,4,5CFMPb1fJtcNOWa-53ORRA

5291535,2016-07-25,0,Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig,Not impressed at all! And by the reviews we thought we pick a good place. They took to long to get our drinks and food. And we order carne Asada and that took forever to cook it and when we got it the meat it looked bad and even the  waitress told us it looked bad too that not to worry about it she would order another one. So we waited and the owner/cook came out telling us that's how the meat looks when it gets cooked that making a new one wouldn't make a difference So we agree just to try it and we couldn't even cut it and they don't have steak knifes just butter knifes! We just left. Bad service by just the owner/cook. Will definitely avoid this place on my next vacation.,zo2u1XszyZ1cmK4GrXPcPg,1,0,1,aXnn73N6Olbc6ApfTlvQLQ
5322515,2015-07-04,9,Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig,"Need to review this joint on the real. This spot is legit. I haven't found a taco shop like they have them in Cali. Roberto's can eat me and Don Tor can go take a hike too.

When a co-workers son recommended it, I jumped at the opportunity to try a new spot. I always go in with high hopes for the danky-dank-dank.

Las Deliciousas isn't the prettiest. Inside she has surprisingly ample seating, the temperature was borderline oppressive, and the humans behind the counter were making everything from scratch and made to order. The aromas were intoxicating. 

I ordered two gorditas and their aqua fresca of the day (which was cantaloupe).  The wait took awhile as all items were made from scratch.

Worth the wait. I was met with those delicious Cali vibes and taste sensations. It's a little out of the way, but not bad and a great spot to hit up before a night out on the strip.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,11,10,5,wQIng9lH5-aYcnLJ8XXBtg

5680891,2016-02-05,0,Kx0MUrNQ737s-VVElk6Vig,"Food was great and inexpensive. The only thing I didn't appreciate is that it's so far from the strip and you could miss it if you don't look carefully. The place is a good size, and I believe it is family owned. I ordered Huevos Rancheros which was delicious but they served it with a tortilla dorada. I had never had that before, but it didn't take away from the plate. I think the interior could use a little sprucing up but it's not a big deal. Not really of fan of the salsas; too watery for my liking. Prices were reasonable. I would definitely go back again.",WiBEWFrmxCbS6FvPajW3mA,0,0,4,mbeB-fY5R_eBgTt6ktvBCg

I don't enjoy a loud television while I'm eating. We were the only ones there but my Honey didn't feel comfortable asking them to turn it down or off.
