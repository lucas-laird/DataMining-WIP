Food came up pretty quickly after that but it look like it had been thrown together. How hard is it to get all the ingredients on the bread? I guess the rush of 4 people in line was too much to handle. Food was ok but messy. Also, done woman parading her dog around inside the restaurant.

I immediately regret not going for in and out which was like 1 minute away, across the street. What a huge difference from across the street to this jack in the box. I came in the morning and it looked terrible and reeked of pee thanks to the other customers so I absolutely would not recommend this place at night. Food was ok, we just ate in the car for a quick meal because it just felt too dirty inside.",7-7A0Avj47slLGV7yBFc8w,0,0,2,Y-trnjwCn48IVPGAOAg57w

When it was time to leave Las Vegas, my current wife and I decided not to leave town with empty tummies and no coffee.  This JB was right across from our hotel, so we hit it for breakfast.

Our food was just great, mine a Meat Lover's Burrito Combo ($5.19) and hers a Sausage Croissant Combo ($4.69).  Both combos came with hash brown patties and coffee.  Neither of us could finish, and the leftovers provided a great snack on the 5-hour drive home, along with our refilled coffees.

But I was most impressed with Victoria, the order-taker.  The customer before us was a wee bit harebrained or hungover, hard to tell which, and thought she had to wait outside the building in the desert heat for a To-Go order.  Victoria called her number, and realized the customer was outside sweltering in the morning sun.  Victoria rolled her eyes, shrugged her shoulders, told me she would be right with me, locked the register and delivered the bags of food to the whacked customer outside.  Now that's good service.  We're fans.",BvYZGQNW-AstHbl4aZ4Kaw,4,4,4,KCFfb3_xGrMFlg0HBk-ULw

Ive had Jack in the Box before in NC and at other locations around Vegas but this one fell short of my expectations. First off they were severely understaffed and I only saw two employees working in the whole facility. So while one person was cooking the other person was working the drive through and it took quite a while for someone to even notice that I was standing there ready to order. Once I finally got my order they short changed me on the fries and my fry bag was only half full. To their credit once I brought this to their attention, they gave me another bag of fries free of charge. The burger was burnt and just simply lackluster. If I hadn't had better Jack in the Box experiences then this place would have gotten a 1 star but since I know they have better food at other locations I'll give them 2 stars.",oPxPP2m1eu4CJCRsiiAAFQ,0,0,2,HZMBYE_kJMze865V3Hqqig

3592783,2016-06-10,0,uUlq6chIVb0I8AehlET5bQ,"Absolutely 100% the worst customer service I have ever received at a ""restaurant"". Repeated my order 15 times for a new employee because clearly no other employee there felt the need to help her. Completely not her fault, it was her first day and should have had a trainer helping her with orders. Finally, another girl with a terrible attitude took over and told me to pull to the window. After asking three different times to have chicken instead of beef she finally understood the question, and told me ""we don't have no chicken tacos. Only soy."" I asked her what soy meat was, and asked specifically if it had cow meat in it. She said it did not, only 'soy protein'. So I took the ""soy tacos"". Parked the car and looked on jack in the box's website, low and behold their ""soy meat"" is made up mostly of BEEF. How can you work at a place and not know what you're selling people? I am allergic to beef. Hence why I attempted to make certain their soy meat contained absolutely no beef. So I go in the store with the food and asked for my money back. I wait 5 minutes for a manager who said nothing other than ""why?"" when I asked for my money. I advised her about her restaurants website, and that her and her employees are telling false information. People ask questions for a reason. Employees should at the very least know what's in the food they're selling to people. The new girl was the only employee with a smile on her face and a good attitude. The rest could learn a thing or two from her! If your job is to deal with customers, you probably shouldn't act like such a miserable asshole! You couldn't pay me to go back there..

I went to get two shakes. An Oreo and chocolate and he gave me pumpkin ? I even repeated twice and he said it back and still messed it up. I didn't care and I was still good but I waited sooooo long and there was no one in the drive thru or inside. Then tonight I get shakes and waited like 3-4 mins to get a response then I wait literally over 10 whole mins for the shakes. I can see them sitting there melting while this huge black(?) chicken and this dude are doing things. One person inside and no one in the drivethru and it takes two people to do what they were doing which was close to nothing ?  No one could just quickly hand me my shakes. It's all small shit but altogether it's just annoying as hell. Plus her attitude. Why does it take 10 mins to hand me a shake. Why does it take like over 25 mins to get a shake when I'm staying 4 mins away. They need to step it up. And respond at the drive try faster. Not make people wait 3-5 mins.
