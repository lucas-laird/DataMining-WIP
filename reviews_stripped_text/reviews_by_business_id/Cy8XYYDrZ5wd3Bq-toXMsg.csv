71036,2017-11-25,0,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"Delicious food. Fish were fresh and comparable to the fancy sushi at the $$$$ sushi spots on the strip. I was able to get happily full on the sashimi alone without spending double. Hubby was surprised when he saw the bill - he thought it would be double like at home in the SF bay area. 

The daily special menu had an uni sashimi and the scallop and uni carpaccio. I couldn't resist. Fresh uni at a decent price is hard to find. The dishes were perfect. No fishy aftertaste that is common with not fresh uni. Reminded me of the fresh uni I had in Japan's fish market. They were out of the Steamed abalone with truffle oil by 8:30pm so I was a little disappointed to miss out. 

Also the only Japanese fatty tuna left that night was akami. It was still buttery goodness. I would have loved to try the otoro.

I was still a little hungry so I ended with the 3 assorted sashimi of salmon, tuna, and hamachi - my faves. All fresh and good size pieces. 

Hubby had the sukiyaki pot. It was smaller than we expected but the quality was perfect. Beef was fresh and cooked just right - not dry. Sauce was properly salted. Usually other places can be too salty. And hubby was happy with the clear noodle. Usually it comes with more starchy noodles to fill you up. 

Hubby also enjoyed the spider roll. He said the rice was fresh so it was soft and the crab was fresh. He said other places usually use old hard crab. 

Neither of us tried the yakitori. Next time. Considering it's an izakaya, its non-yakitori offerings were surprisingly delicious. 

The service was good. Appropriately attentive. Server helped pick the perfect sake for me - small 300 ml light, slightly dry and sweet.

Will definitely have to come here next time I am in LV.",Qf0mIa19SZiOE-_htF0j0g,0,0,5,e7mPsY_FQhlT6ph4iuZ94w

If you have a bad experience from other places like me and didn't wanna eat it again. You have to try it here. Sashimi is fresh and yakitori is a bomb.

171728,2016-11-30,2,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"My wife and I went to this place with very high expectation.  After moving here from OC three years ago, we have been craving for a good Yakitori joint.  
Well after our first visit, we haven't returned to Hachi again. Couple of the Yakitori order we placed were under cooked and semi raw.  This is a no no in my opinion especially with pork or chicken meat.  I thought of complaining to the server but decided not to after the second dish came out with under cooked meat.  Whoever trained the guy doing the Yakitori pieces did not do a good job imo.
I am Japanese and have been eating yakitori since I was about 5 years old.  I have been to real high end Yakitori restaurants in Ginza and other part of Tokyo.   In OC, there were couple of super good Yakitori places as good as Japan.  Staff cooking in OC places are not Japanese but they are trained well so they cook well.
My favorite Yakitori place in LV so far is Cocokara.  
Maybe I will try Hachi again soon and see if they have improved.  I will write a review again after my next visit.",dAHHIffJUdiOUkK7dpimVA,2,1,3,o8G5ZN67s2U_h7ZJNakjDg

The location of the restaurant has a lot of competition in such a small strip mall: Chubby Cattle, District One Kitchen, Chada Thai & Wine and Ramen Tatsu to name a few (all of which are bookmarked and I have yet to try).
My husband and I enjoyed the food so much that I did not even take pictures of what we got so I took pictures of the menu so I could remember what we ate.
It's awesome that you can try a little of everything instead of being committed to one big entree.  Portion sizes are decent and sushi was very fresh.
We tried a little of everything and ordered the following:
(We are not very adventurous and stayed away from ""exotic things"" ie: tongue, pork belly, intestine etc..) 
Sushi 
Passion Roll $11.50 Spicy tuna and cucumber inside and tuna on top were so fresh
**Natto Roll $3.50 (for me) if you do not know what this is then skip it.  It is fermented soy beans so healthy and good for you however it is an acquired taste and something that I have been eating since I was a little kid. Whenever I go to a Japanese or sushi restaurant I look to see if there is Natto.

Ikayaki $7.95 The squid is marinated in their signature ""Tare"" sauce and was prepared perfectly.
Dynamite $8.95 Baked scallop, crab, mushroom and onions baked in a mayonnaise? sauce, one of the best we've ever had!
Sukiyaki Hot Pot $7.65 The meat was not fatty and the broth was very tasty.  There was a lot of food 3 pieces of tofu, clear noodles, bok choy, enoki mushrooms, onions and green onions.
You can add rice and miso soup for $3.00
or rice, miso soup and California roll for $7.50
Cheese Chikuwa Tempura $4.65 I liked this one, my husband not so much.  It was a very interesting texture combination with the melted cheese, chewy fish cake and slight crisp outside from the tempura batter.

Yakitori-All Yakitori is cooked on Bincho-tan Charcoal that is imported from Japan so that they can make it as authentic as possible and also makes the food crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.
Chicken Thigh Tare $2.25
Chicken Thigh with Citron Pepper $2.50-Hubby really liked this one, it had a good flavor but a little too spicy in a peppery way for me.
Shitake Butter $1.85
Okra $1.50

Dessert
Honey Toast I was very excited about this for dessert and almost didn't get it because I was so full from dinner, but I did and OMG it was the tallest piece of bread I have ever seen! It was so delicious! Bread, vanilla ice cream and honey! Very basic but so yummy and a MUST to top off your dinner, save room!
They also had a a pretty big selection of sake both hot and cold, by the bottle or carafe.

Overall we had a great dinner experience and will be telling everyone we know to go and check this place out!  We will be back again for sure!",e5mj9DaE1ZWRGxWDCUgUQg,2,2,5,5_C4Ufiu9KSz4CbKCs2Bdg

Food was absolutely great! Their Tsukune is hand made and made from Fresh (usually many restaurant pre-cook) and cook with Low heat which makes tsukune very juicy! 

Also all Yakitori is cooked with BINCHOTAN charcoal!! Which makes a lot difference! Significant difference on flavor and more tender inside!

They have a great Sashimi too! We had assorted sashimi with 6kinds! OMG it was fantastic! And you won't imagine how big it would be with that price! Must try!

Small plates, so you can order something that you're just curious about, and it's a $3 gamble. And I've been pleasantly surprised by nearly everything.

On my most recent visit, four of us ate (no drinks, unfortunately) very well for $100 plus tax and tip, including some very fair (but not exceptional) quality otoro and uni nigiri. Very fair for the price.

They'll also do an omakase if you ask, just tell them what you want to spend. $40 is a very nice price point for this.

836162,2015-09-23,0,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"With so many izakaya places in town, this is probably my least favorite.  Selections are not as big as other places and they were even out of a few things on the menu when we went.  

First of all.. maybe it's a bad day at the restaurant, but they have to get their AC fixed!  My friend and I were literally sweating while eating our dinner.  The server saw me faning with my menu, she was kind enough to move us to another table with a better location with the ac.  We did feel the air move at the new table (one of the booths), but the air was not cold and minimal.  That made the dining experience not very enjoyable if I had to wipe my forehead while eating...and I wasn't in Asia eating street food.   

Service was great, with 4 or 5 servers in the little restaurant, they were all very nice and come refill your drinks and take away your plates.

Food is ok.  Solid 3.5 stars.  The chicken thigh skewers were perfectly grilled; the pizza one...well, guess it's our fault to order pizza skewer at a Japanese place; chicken wing was meaty and nicely flavored; grilled whole squid was done perfectly, not too charred to make it ika jerkey, just the right amount.  I wish they give you more ground ginger on the side (like Ichiza does) instead of more of that mayo sauce.  

Tried 2 cold dishes, the sashimi carpaccio and their version of tuna tataki.  Sashimi carpaccio is 2 stars at its best.  It's a combo of halibut and salmon, I think they dressed it with some kind of oil on top instead of just ponzu type of dressings.. it made it pretty oily for my taste, especially the salmon was already a belly cut with extra fat.  And again, didn't feel the dish to be very refreshing because it wasn't very cold... again, maybe I was just hot from the lack of AC in the restaurant.  Seared tuna tataki was much better, with a huge amount of red onions on top, although flavors were great and the right amount of dressing, wish the star of the dish would be more of tuna itself instead of red onions.  It's hard to find the tuna under the huge pile of onions.  Needless to say, both cold dishes were not my favorite of the meal.

Chicken karaage... I think they need to cut the pieces smaller, either bite or 2-bite size like other izakaya places.  They were huge pieces, 4 in an order, I felt like I was eating the chicken tenders from Cane's.  Although flavors and breading were pretty good, the size was just way too big and made it kind of gross... I had to double check every bite to make sure the inside of the chicken was fully cooked since the pieces were huge.  

Dessert: They didn't have the matcha soft cream, I was looking forward to try it.  Tried their Honey Toast because who doesn't love some Honey Toast, right?  Who knew you can screw up honey toast.  It was overly sweet....not sure if they were using extra honey or bad kind of honey, it's too sweet for my taste.  And they had to dust powder sugar on top to make it ""prettier?"", like it's not sweet enough, we need extra sugar on top.  The vanilla ice cream was probably a very cheap kind... it's SO WHITE, like hospital white and not very natural taste.  So, definitely would not order honey toast if I ever come back here.

Overall, it was a decent meal, most dishes were tasty, but nothing memorable.  My friend and I love Japanese food so was really looking forward to try this new spot.  Unfortunately I don't think I'd want to come back here.  With their limited selections of izakaya and overall taste of the food, i know I'll have much better experience at other places, unfortunately.",bEZjkjMe1HDWjec-R5O8bw,1,0,3,nc4ipqt__RCVKnd6cRILzg

The service was quick and attentive; water glasses kept full. 

The food was great. Ordered a variety of dishes, but we were a little limited by our kids' immature palates so we didn't experience the breadth of the menu.  The menu was a little more extensive than I've experienced at other izakayas, though. Ordered: salmon sashimi, sashimi bowl, tamago yaki, oyako don, yakitori ($1.40/stick), chicken karaage, hire katsu, chicken skin chips, and honey toast.  These were small plates so they were shared amongst our family of five. The flavors were good but maybe generally on the sweet side. Fried chicken skin - how can you go wrong? The hire katsu is not as tender as I've had elsewhere (talking Tonkatsu Kiyoshi). Tare yakitori was sauced slightly and the charcoal taste was prominent. One kid thought it was overly smokey, but the mom and dad liked the campfire taste. Sashimi was very fresh and the thick cuts were appreciated. Honey toast was a highlight; best I've tasted in a long time - perfectly crunch on the outside and just enough honey to not make it overly rich.

We enjoyed our food. After eating standard Christmas fare for a few days, izakaya hit the spot. I would agree with another reviewer that this place is a little on the spendy side, but it's not entirely unexpected at the same time.

This is a gem of a restaurant that my boyfriend and I adore. Let's start off with their yakitori. Their wagyu beef is awesome!!! We also had their pork belly and duck yakitori with salt and the pork belly was definitely just as flavorful and well seasoned as the wagyu. What I enjoy about their yakitori sticks is the char flavor that enhances the overall flavor of any yakitori sticks.
Their maguro and chutoro are fresh and I love how they serve it on a bowl of fresh ice to keep it cool. 
One of our go to dish is their chicken steak. As everything on their menu, this is also a dish full of flavor. What's becoming my favorite appetizer is their fried chicken skin. All I can say is YUM!!! It is fried to crispy perfection and again seasoned well with garlic salt. It's comparable to chicharon. 
What I didn't get to take a picture of was their special which was a marinated beef skirt steak. Omg!!! The best dish of the night. Nicely cooked to medium rare and so tender and fu of Japanese BBQ flavor. Anyone that has bbq'd skirt steak know it's not always an easy task as you need to also cut against the grain to keep it juicy and they definitely got this dish right. 
The staff is always friendly and courteous and it's pretty easy to be seated without reservations. This is one of my highly recommend spot if you're ever nearby Chinatown. 
The majority of the dishes are small portion size reminiscent of a tapas style so be prepared to spend some money but not a crazy amount if you like variety like we do.",PN4U68T2TPhfATDxiISdKA,2,1,4,PTnPdB4Pi_eWewZZhVd_Rw

-I stood around for at least five minutes without being helped and when I was finally greeted it was 'are you an uber driver?' Staff seemed completely frazzled although it didn't appear to be that busy to me, but I could be wrong.
-One bowl of ramen was on the menu and it was honestly mediocre at best. The service was quick, however. 
- Still hungry I decided to grab a tuna roll and holy heck did I regret my decision. I made a point to specifically not order the spicy tuna roll because I'm not a fan of spicy sushi but when I ate a piece it was hot as heck! Definitely had wasabi everywhere but I ate another piece in the event that the particular piece had touched against the wasabi on the plate - this was not the case. 
-After asking the server what was wrong with my food, he informed me that their rice was made with wasabi? Or maybe it was the roll either way I scanned the menu and I couldn't find a warning about it anywhere.

The guy that greeted us and served us wasn't very happy about something. Sorry we came in? Or... maybe he was just having a bad night idk but I didn't like how cold he was.. 

The food was pretty good tho. They have a special type of soy sauce that tasted yummy. 

And They have a late jught menu of cheap items.. maybe too cheap.

I ordered the poke bowl.. the flavor is there.. but the fish was not.. pretty sure there were like 7 pieces of fish.. wish there was more fish.. even off of the late night menu like regular size with more fish because it tasted yummy. 

I also ordered a chicken thigh skewer which was small but it was only 1.85 glad I ordered that because I wanted more protein from my poke bowl.

My man and his dad shared the supreme salmon roll. It was yummy!

See the food was good, the hours are great, but the service and the amount of food was eh.

Now the food, I ordered a hachi salad and it was made with rice crackers and that was pretty delicious if you ask me, a little too saucy for a salad but it was still good.
I also ordered hamaguri clams, 2.50 for a clam. They were a little hard/chewy and the sauce for the clam was a little salty. 
All the other stuff I ordered was up to par though! Like the salmon sashimi, the salmon rolls, sukiyaki ($15 for a bowl good for up to 2 people) chicken skewers, and the desserts. The oysters are okay not the best I've ever had.

*fresh oysters 2 pcs. $3.98 - with a ponzu sauce garnished with scallions. This is a must-get. The oysters are BIG and fresh, they apparently are korean oysters 5/5 

*salmon kama - grilled to perfection! Had the right amount of seasoning. The skin was nice and crispy and the salmon was succulent and not dry. Eat with rice to make it into a meal (:

*chashu - this I probably wouldn't order again. Was more lean than I'm used to, dry, tough and overcooked and barely had any sauce on it. Wish it had more fat in it..

*pork cheek - we preferred the pork belly over this. Didn't have much fat on it

*pork belly - delicious! Very juicy and the person grilling knows exactly when it's perfect!

*wagyu premium beef tongue - was a little too chewy for our taste but the quality is there

*Oyakodon - small serving size but had a good amount of soup. Juicy chicken and egg, not overly salty or sweet (:

*sashimi bowl $9.98 - my bowl had 2 ea. of tuna, salmon, whitefish, mackerel, and yellowtail. Fresh, was satisfying and I was able to finish it with no problem.

*nasu dengaku - it comes in two small pieces. Love the flavor but was kind of pricy for the amount you get lol

*Paitan ramen $10.50 - my bf really really loved this. It's on the pricier side compared to most ramen but is well worth it. The noodles had the perfect bite, was neither thick or thin but in between, perfect onsen tamago, and the broth was not too salty, subtle but flavorful.

Use the condiments! The pork skewers with salt went really well with the buta miso paste. Hachi soy sauce was sweet and salty which was different and I used it with my sashimi.

Service here is impeccable! We've always sat at the bar and all the servers make sure to check on you. Refills come on time which is a plus. Chefs are nice.

This plaza is rife with great offerings, and I'm glad to see the new dishes offered here: a mix of hot and cold tapas, with some sashimi and yakitori grill items thrown in. Their charcoal grill items are featured, but their fresh fish items are standouts for us!

HOT DISHES
The grilled ika and grilled mackerel are both great! Nice blistering, perfectly cooked, simple and tasty. Daikon, lemon, and spicy mayo are offered alongside, but neither dish really needs it.  The chicken karrage was juicy, but not a standout. Crispy breading seemed uneven. 

COLD DISHES
The sashimi roll is perfection: fresh fish, rice paper, and shiso leaves, with a tasty yuzu sauce. The sashimi carpaccio features garlic oil, herbs, and seasonings- the crispy garlic in particular added great texture and flavor to the fish! What's not to love?! I am hoping they add more raw fish dishes and light rolls to their menu, their fish is very fresh and great quality. Will come back for sashimi. 

GRILL ITEMS
Various meats on sticks. The chicken thigh is tasty, with a nice char to it. They have a house-made chicken sausage that is fairly unique, and available with a poached egg dipping sauce- didn't much care for it. The offer two types of beef tongue, and the lean version we tried lacked the flavor we expected, seeming more like liver? The kurobata sausage and tomato/bacon are staples that are executed well. Grilled mackerel was the best dish in this section of the menu: simply prepared, crispy skin, moist interior, best with just a squeeze of lemon.

DESSERT
Matcha pannacotta is sublime. Cool, creamy green tea custard features a surprise red bean filling, topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. I prefer desserts that aren't too sweet, and this perfectly fit the bill. Their honey toast seems to be very popular though, and many groups around us ordered it.

Service sitting at the sushi bar was attentive throughout our visit, with constant drink refills and small talk with the sushi chef. The interior space is modern, with both booths and the bar, and loud EDM/House style music, which was an interesting contrast to the simple, classic food.

Long story short - our unfriendly waitress misunderstands our order, brings us twice as many things as we order, and EVEN AFTER WE CLARIFY and ASK HER TO STOP, CHARGES US FOR THEM.  She argues with us that she brought them and because we ate them, we're paying!  
I have never had a restaurant mistakenly give me the wrong food and then say we're paying for their error!  Especially when we tell her this issue, she says okay, and walks away, leaving the food there!  If the restaurant was going to charge us, you would think they'd take them away??

The owner/sushi chef is there pretty much every time I can remember and serves up some of the best scallop nigiri I've had in the U.S. I generally keep it to the yakitori menu and It's turned out some of the juiciest most flavorful pieces of meat I've ever had. Some stand outs from the yakitori menu are definitely the duck and the wagyu, the tongue is good but ichiza has them beat on that front. When it comes to their dessert they are known for their giant honey toast that whole very good is also sometimes too much after a full dinner and some of their other dessert options are a little weak but their beer and liquor selections are solid and their happy hour flavored sake shots are an extreme deal.",nMV0HlS6mx6Kn98lBmmjBA,0,0,5,RGfXz6OGotWDU-FX8rcx9Q

Grilled oysters are pretty small so even $2 seems a bit costly.  Happy hour will lower the price more.
The brick toast is very large portion.  The bread is about 8"" tall and loaded with ice cream so it'll be good to share.  Takes 15-20 minutes to make so order it during mid meal can avoid some wait time.

A new little izakaya that stands alone right across from District 1 and opened in early August 2015!  The decor is inviting and comfortable from the minute you walk-in.  The focus of the restaurant centers around the kitchen as the seating area encircles the cooks and the bar area.

The food emphasis is on small tapas type dishes ranging from classic Japanese yakitori skewers, grilled seafood...to a variety of carpaccio dishes.  I would say that you have try a few things from the authentic Japanese charcoal grill.  The grilled items have a smoky taste that is unlike anything else that you will find in general at most places.  They use a specially imported Japanese charcoal that imparts great flavour to the food.

They have other typical items of sashimi, katsu's, and other ramen/donburi but you should really start with their specialties first and fill up toward the end should you need.

Don't forget to look at their alcohol menu as they have many different sakes and sochus that are bound to fit your taste.

Service is great and very attentive.  My water glass was never empty and I was drinking constantly during this summer heat.  Servers were also very available a moments notice when called upon.

So everyone should try this new izakaya and enjoy a little taste of Tokyo.  And don't forget to try at least ONE of their yummy desserts!!!

It deserves much better.

The service was excellent - polite, sweet, friendly.  One small suggestion to the manager and BOH - slow the kushiyaki down just a little.  Kushiyaki is meant to be eaten hot, fresh off the grill. When they are spaced as they are - not all together, but too tightly spaced sequentially - the guests can't really enjoy the previous skewer without the next skewer getting cool.

Nearly every kushiyaki item we ordered was excellent, on par with the best I've found in LA and better than most. 

A large part of my happiness with the kushiyaki items was due to their use of bintochan to grill...

The fish sashimi and uni dishes were very good, not quite excellent. Certainly better than good enough for those who like raw seafood instead of or in addition to the grilled items, but it was not destination sushiya level.

The decor was great, with an authentic Japanese izakaya meets modernist US west coast feel to it.

I really enjoyed my experience here and I greatly hope they find their fan base; it is a worthy addition to the area, with the superlative Raku just down the street and so many great Asian and especially Taiwanese places nearby, in Las Vegas Chinatown.

We chose to sit at the bar this time, so we could see some of the chefs at work.  

They have a daily special menu, with discounted items which was awesome. The day we went there was sweet shrimp nigiri, and choice of fried shrimp head or miso soup (add $1.00). It's only one per person, so we tried the fried head, and it was so crispy.  You could eat everything. The nigiri was very fresh, kept me wanting more! Each piece including the fried head was only 2.50.

We ordered some skewers, chicken thigh, tskune, pork cheek, beef.  They were all very juicy and had a nice aroma.  Their blend of house soya sauce was very tasty and not too salty.  

We had the other daily special which was a baked clam (2 pieces), the presentation was very nice, but the clam meat was a little salty, perhaps because of the natural habitat of salt water. 

We tried fried oyster (2 pieces) and this was very nice and juicy.  The outer layer was really crispy with a silky texture inside. 

Fried chicken skin, this was really yummy.  Nice starter, great crisp, and a squeeze of lemon cuts the saltiness. 

Takowasabi, this had a good Wasabi flavour and crunch. 

Yamakeke, we got this last time too because we really liked it.  It's mountain yam with tuna sashimi chunks, salmon roe. The mountain yam is very gooey and has an interesting slimy texture with a touch of crunch.  We mixed it together with their house blend soya sauce.  They put a bit of Wasabi to mix in, and this gave it such a nice kick!!

The atmosphere is intimate and all of the staff was welcoming. We decided to sit at the bar as to not take up any four top tables. I'm glad we sat at the bar because it felt like a much better experience.
We ordered a couple of Kirins and perused the three menus. One was a nightly specials menu, one was an appetizer dinner, and the last was their full menu. 

We began with the crispy rice appetizer, bacon wrapped tomatos, and a scallop and sea urchin crudo. Everything gave out super fast and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh. 

We went super fat kid mode and ordered the following:
Wagyu tongue misozuke
Pork cheek
Duck
Pork belly
Beef tataki
Kurobuta sausage
Seared garlic tuna nigiri
Chicken karaage 
Honey toast (to finish the night off)

Overall I had an incredible experience and it made for an awesome date night. Sitting at the bar was fun because we would get all of our food handed over the counter to us as soon as it was finished on the charcoal grill.

Their service is 10/10 every time. They are attentive, knowledgeable, professional and extremely polite. Back in Japan these type of service is the norm but that's not the case in US unfortunately. I liked that both chefs and servers genuinely care about their customers. You can just see it in their eyes when they greet everyone. 

If you are dining in at Hachi, I would highly recommend their yakitori. There are several that I always always order:
-Duck (I like both balsamic vinegar and salt)
-Beef tongue
-Pork belly
-Okra

As for other items on the menu, my favorites are:
-Yamaimo somen
-Beef tataki salad
-Ochazuke (Highly recommend..this is not your typical ochazuke)
-Magic mountain
-Sashimi

Four of us arrived at about 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night. We were promptly greeted and told it would be a short wait. We sat down in the waiting area and the man who greeted us also brought us menus to look at while we waited. They were so nice about keeping us updated and apologizing for the wait, which was not a problem at all. 

Once we were seated, we were promptly served and the waitress took our drink orders. We looked over the menu and basically decided to do everything family style except everyone ordered their own rice dishes. Everything was amazing. First of all, they had natto rolls. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know that I love the traditional Japanese staple and that I judge the authenticity of a Japanese restaurant by the availability of natto. +1 already for having that (it was delicious, by the way).

We ordered the following items:
-Juicy chicken karaage with negi sauce: AMAZING. The sauce really brought out the fried chicken flavor. 
-Chicken thigh with tare: Easily one of the best yakitori sticks I have had, both in Japan and domestically. Great, great flavor.
-Pork belly: probably the winner of the night for me. We got it with tare and I am drooling just thinking about it again.
-Pork with negi shio sauce: OMG an explosion of flavor. This is tied with the pork belly with tare
-Kurobuta sausage: I didn't eat this as I was getting full, but the others in the party seemed to really enjoy it.
-Beef misozuke: so tender and flavorful. We all shared one stick of this. We should have got more!
-Sweet corn: the corn is sweet and there is just something great about grilled corn.
-Shiitake butter: delicious. I liked that they put katsuo flakes on it. It was a nice touch. 
-Ume shiso chicken: Two traditional Japanese flavors that are always a home run. Yummy. 
-Sashimi bowl, unagi bowl, and yakitori bowl: these were the ones we ordered separately and everyone enjoyed it very much. 

The service here is beyond excellent. Our water and soda glasses were always full, and even though we ended up staying at the restaurant for over 3 hours, we never felt rushed or anything. In fact, they kept coming over even after the checks were paid to see if we wanted more water. 

I am definitely coming back and want to try the other menu items. This place really reminds me of the two years I spent living in Japan, and I have only positive things to say about Hachi. From the moment you step into the door to the moment you leave, they treat you like a valued customer and their food is so good.

2. All of the food is really good, but honestly would rather just pay somewhere else for an all you can eat sushi since a lot of the food they have to offer is on any AYCE menu. Ex. Hamachi kama, tempura, yakitori skewers 
3. This is the kind of place that will charge you for anything and everything. I got charged for barley any jalapenos (see photo) it says i was charged for extra jalapeno but that was the first time i asked for it. 

So everything was good, I just dont see myself coming back here. The menu isnt creative but it's so expensive. I left barley full and not satisfied. Ill probably just stick to Inyo or Yonaka for tapas dishes.",-C9TzyciiJwct30Mwm_o9Q,0,0,3,eEQtB84hSjPTQlcuz1sNew

4108268,2017-03-19,3,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"When your Japanophile foodie friend who's actually traveled to Japan recommends a restaurant such as this one, you pay attention. When he invites you to dinner there, you smile and reply yes.

Hachi is an izakaya which is also owned by the person(s) behind local restaurants Sushi Twister and Ramen Sora, both of which I've enjoyed. It took over the old Kaze Sushi spot (RIP AYCE sashimi lunch) and contributes to the massive parking snafu of the increasingly jampacked Mountain View Plaza on Jones near Spring Mountain. My friend likely suggested this spot because of the late night specials (aka happy hour), which are offered nightly from 10pm-2:30am (last seating at 2:00).

Needless to say, we took advantage of said happy hour menu. However, we also dived into the daily specials and the regular menu, leaning heavily toward the binchotan-grilled and other cooked items more so than the sushi for tonight.

Crispy chips ($2.95 special): chicken skins on steroids. It's just a flavor bomb in a crunchy format, and the simple lemon squeeze does so much for it.

Raw oysters ($1 special): I wouldn't call myself an oyster expert despite having had the food at several places, but I didn't find anything off-putting and appreciated the wasabi and sauce on this. The lemon squeeze was almost not necessary.

(Paitan ramen: I only had a taste of the broth, but I was intrigued by the bonito flavor listed on the menu and easily tasted it in this dish. FWIW, my other friend is a bit of a ramen fiend, and it didn't think that highly of the dish overall. It's a little pricy at $10.50, but I'll consider trying it for myself in the future.)

Chicken Thighs ($1.95/skewer): perhaps a relatively bland meat is actually the best vehicle for the charred flavor bestowed by the highly prized binchotan charcoal. The salted version was actually one of my favorite skewers of the night, while the sweet yet salt-deficient tare version needed help from the tableside condiments. I used the special house soy sauce, which is actually nicely sweet.

Ume Shiso Yaki ($2.60/skewer): a totally different take on the chicken due to the plum and shiso leaf. Not that memorable for me, but worth a try.

Pork Belly ($1.95/skewer): far more meat than fat in the cut used here. The salted versions didn't work as well as the tare for me. I was a bit underwhelmed here.

Pork Cheek ($1.95/skewer): I opted for the tare seasoning here, and I found this juicier and more flavorful than the pork belly. It's one of the better cooked porks in town, but I've tasted truly fantastic pork cheek from another restaurant, and this doesn't really match it.

""Wagyu"" Tongue ($3.50/skewer): I'd rank this a bit above at least the salted pork belly. It has the distinctive ""crunch"" of tongue and of course that beefy flavor.

Duck w/ Salt ($3.50/skewer): I probably need to try more non-sweet duck preparations to appreciate this fully. I'll say that it was nicely cooked and tender at least.

Bacon-wrapped Enoki ($2.50/skewer): you can never go wrong with bacon, the crunch from the enoki was tremendous, and the ground pepper was a nice touch. I think I could've used a bit of sweetness here though. Maybe I'm sugar-spoiled...

""Japanese Delicacy Sampler"" ($6.50): one of the real highlights of the meal despite the tiny portion size. Firefly Squid w/ ginger & soy sauce was a tender yet delicious preparation. The other two were both rather chewy but still special. The raw baby eels with daikon and ponzu are a very unusual special, and the fermented squid was surprisingly not that bitter and had obvious citrus notes. I hope it's not just a limited-run daily special.

Ebi Yaki ($3.95 special): think takoyaki, but with tender shrimp in the middle instead of chewy octopus. I wouldn't call this special, but it's very fun and they even force the server to struggle with sprinkling the bonito flakes onto the dish table-side (because you're provided the option of having the server drizzle sauce over it or leave the sauce on the side). It was a good but not exceptional variant of the dish.

Seared Salmon Belly Nigiri ($2.25): I couldn't let the night end without sampling one of my favorite cuts of fish, and it was indeed a delicious, cooked variant of the fatty fish. Some may balk at the touch of sauce on it, but I liked it.

Macha Panna Cotta ($5): yep, had to have dessert too. It's a little thicker than I would've liked, but the matcha flavor shined in every bite, and the azuki (red bean) surprise at the bottom was also fun. I wouldn't say that I was blown away, but I enjoyed this.

And on that note, I wasn't really captivated by a majority of the items that I ate at Hachi tonight. I did enjoy everything though, and I appreciated the care that they showed with quality of ingredients and cooking. I'll definitely come back some time to explore the vast myriad of items on both their regular menus and their daily specials.

No referral or prescription needed, this establishment will be able to relieve all symptoms of disappointing foods and at a generic level price!

Having severe withdrawals from my trip to Tokyo I wanted to experience the quality of Japanese kushiyaki that I had there. Fresh meats, marinated over Binchotan Charcoal and not cooked using a conventional gas grill. I've have had this place bookmarked ever since it first took over the previous sushi restaurant and with some friends in town, we decided to go check it out.

Setting: In the middle of the busy jones/spring mountain plaza, there are tons of places to eat and do. Q karaoke, billiards, cafe moda, hookah etc.... This area to me is the new focal point of go to eats in the chinatown area. 

Interior: Dark and sophisticated, the area has a light smoky smell from the grill but well ventilated. Sushi bar area with seats and booths surrounding it, usually there isn't a challenge to get seated which surprises me because of how good it is.

Food: Sushi, Karage, other japanese apps but the kushiyaki, THIS is why you come here. Ever since my trip to the Philippines, eating with my hands has changed my life and grabbing food with my hands feels so right. So grabbing these meat skewers and sliding it off with my mouth has an usual satisfaction for me. They have chicken, beef, seafood based skewers but my favorite in order are 
1. Wagyu beef tongue
2. Tsukune (you don't need the $1 raw egg, it slides off the meat)
3. Pork cheeks
4. Chicken thigh
5. Intestine
*i prefer the salt over the sauce for the thigh, cheeks, and intestine
**make sure you get a bowl of rice to accompany your skewers

Service: Everyone here is nice and approachable to ask any questions about the food and menu. They welcome you with a big irotshimasen and arigato gojieemasu after you're done, it's like I haven't left Japan.

Overall: I crave this place and if I lived closer i'd be here every other day (we actually came here 2 days in a row).",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,27,34,5,PB_0Ix_k6aUJ1YUysWhurg

First time we had dinner here, everything was good, the chef's appetizer sampler with the crab butter, beef tataki with cucumber, and the eggplant--it all took my taste buds for a sweet ride. The least remarkable was the eggplant. The beef and the crab were good. Must try. I also had yakitori: chicken thigh with tare, pork belly with salt, shiitake butter, shishito pepper and tsukune. Everything is delicious. The first bite I took of the tsukune, my first reaction was mmm.... wtf is that?! (With a look of disbelief--in a good way). I then ordered more of the tsukune. The wagyu tongue is sooo good too. Must be the charcoal they used. All their yakitori is soooo tasty. You have to have some yakitori when you eat here.

Second time I went, I had all of the above again AND the kanpachi collar which landed on our table by accident (fortunately). Another must have. I also had mackerel and halibut sashimi which were both good thought not as out of this world as their yakitori.

On both visits, my kids loved their katsu and karaage as well. They have really good karaage.

Service is good. Ambience is authentic japanese.

1) Crispy Chips (4.5/5) - fried crispy chicken skin....so bad for you but so good. 

2) Sashimi Roll (5/5) - assorted seafood wrapped by rice paper topped with an amazing yuzu miso sauce. one of the mandatory dishes you must order...it was delicate and delicious

3) Kurobota Sausage (3.5/5) - all the times I've gotten kurobota sausage...I've been underwhelmed so I may be a bit biased. but it was cooked just fine. however, compared to all the other dishes, I probably wouldn't get this again next time.

4) Chicken Thigh (5/5) - $1.60 per skewer. you can get it with salt or their tare sauce. they grill all their yakitori with this high quality Binchotan charcoal, and it just tastes better. the meat is succulent and flavorful.

5) Chicken Teba Wing (4/5) - $1.50 per wing. cooked perfectly with the skin just delicately crispy while the meat itself is very juicy. 

6) Yamakake Hachi Style (5/5) - mountain yam sliced into thin noodles with tuna sashimi and greens. I love unique, authentic dishes like this and I would get this over and over again. 

7) Pork Belly (4/5) - $1.75 per skewer, same with chicken thigh, you can get it with salt or tare. tasted good but I think the chicken thigh is superior.

8) Assorted Sashimi (4.5/5) - got the three kinds of fish for $17. comes with standard tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. fish was fresh, thick slices, what more can you ask for.

I love that this place is open late and the servers and chefs are very friendly. Fun casual ambiance, great for groups of friends or date night. Now on to the food! These are the memorable dishes:
Beef tongue : mustttt get. Mine was cooked was perfectly, so tender. I ordered 3 of these :D
Pork cheek: reminded me of the Korean pork neck/pork jowl. Order it!
Pork belly: definitely get an order of this if you like pork belly. Its not too fatty and very flavorful.
Kire katsu: BESTT katsu in vegas yet.. you're missing out if you don't try katsu from here.
Tako wasa: i looooove tako wasa. it's not the best I've ever had but still worth getting. Best I've ever had was in San Diego and let's be honest... No way Vegas seafood is going to beat SD's seafood.
Duck: can't remember if I had this but if we did, it was good. There was nothing I didn't like!
Spicy tuna roll: it was alright. The tuna looked like there was additional food coloring added in.
Wagyu yakitori: omgg, melt in your mouth goodness!! This came very close to the kobe beef I had in Japan, which nothing can beat. 
Honey brick toast: WAYY too big for 2 people but nonetheless we had to order it. It comes with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream. I probably wouldn't get it again because I felt like a fatass afterwards. This brick toast is a lot more simple than ones I'm used to but it was still yummy. Worth trying if you've never had brick toast before.

We then ordered the crispy chicken skin and marinated salty squid. Crispy chicken skin is like pork rinds, salty and crisp. The squid was not what I was expecting but cold and in a heavy sauce. It was really good. We then had orders of duck with salt, chicken thigh with salt, wagyu beef, smelts, mackerel and shrimp tempura and all were excellent.

After the first time we went, we went 5 more times in the next 10 days. #truth 

Here's the rundown:

Sashimi specials - if it's on the board, try it. Never let an opportunity pass you by. 

Jalapeño yellowtail - fresh, delicious, not spicy, love the onion slivers

Pork belly skewers - delicious both ways, salt or sauce. The flavor is amazing, the charcoal they use really enhances it and makes it just that much better than any other pork belly you may have had. Promise!

Chashu and or the chashu bowl - oh mah gah!  The chashu is just DEEELISH!  Can't even describe it. I want it every day! 

Chicken Karage - go for it...get it with the sauce.  You won't be disappointed. 

Other highlights: enoki bacon skewer, chicken thigh skewer, okra, tsekune...yum!! Get it with the poached egg..so rich, 1 egg is enough for a table to share, sashimi plate, squid, and of course...the brick toast! 

See you there!! Lol.

My favorite unfiltered dame and I arrived a little early to Hachi last night; none-the-less there were quite a few others waiting to get in as well. Usually a line is a great sign something amazing is about to go down!!

The stars speak for themselves the fish is very fresh and totally the opposite of your typical low grade AYCE joints! The seared tuna was by far one of my favorites. 

I'm not a fan of oysters or so I thought until I took mine down like a pro! I was expecting a gritty taste but the oysters were rinsed well before put back in the shell to serve! I skipped on the wasabi that junks totally an acquired taste. 

The soy sauce wasn't your typical salty condiment; it's actually refreshing and not overbearing.

4974877,2015-10-01,5,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"Hachi is one of the latest izakayas to open up shop, taking up residence along the popular corners of Jones and Spring Mountain.  With ramen (Ramen Sora) and AYCE sushi (Sushi Twister) under their belts, the owners went a different route with their newest venture in yakitori. 

Greeted promptly and eagerly on a recent Sunday evening, the restaurant was a third full with Japanese-speaking clientele. 

Our waiter was thorough and energetic with explaining the menu and there was a bit to review.  We ordered a little of everything, but let's get to my favorites first. 

* Crispy Chips ""Deep fried chicken skin chips with house seasoning"" ($3) - Oh. My. Gawd. This had me dancing in my seat! Fresh off the fryer with a squeeze of lemon and I am having a party in my mouth. I love deep fried chicken skin and their version just makes me so happy. As a result, we added 2 more orders. Love love love! 

* Yamaimo Chips ""Japanese mountain yam skin fried isobe style"" ($3) - Having only experienced this dish at one other place, we were psyched to see it here. Yum. Yum. Yum. Can I get an Amen? Oh yeah! There's a limit of 3 orders a day since they don't carry a huge quantity of mountain yams. We were more than happy to claim all 3 for ourselves.

* Ika Karaage ""Deep fried squid"" ($3.50) - A tasty aioli accompanied this dish.

* Skipjack Tataki Hachi Style ($6.50) - This dish came from their specials board. It's loaded with raw red onions, which may not be something for everyone. I especially liked the shiso leaf, onions, and mayo(?) combination, but it was a little too heavy-handed with the Hachi sauce.

* Assorted Sashimi Bowl ($9.98) - This came with about 10 pieces of fresh fish on top of rice. It didn't taste like sushi rice and I didn't expect it to be since they don't serve any nigiri here from what I gathered. This is a great opportunity to use their special soy sauce blend made with bonito flakes, so it's a bit sweeter.

* Scallop Carpaccio ""Scallop sashimi topped with masago, cherry tomatoes, micro cilantro and micro greens. Splashed with olive oil, white soy sauce, lemon yuzu, and yuzu miso sauce."" ($9.95) - The scallop was fresh and bright, and the fish eggs were flavorful (although they seemed more like tobiko than masago). I wasn't the hugest fan of the micro cilantro and micro greens and felt the yuzu miso sauce took away from the clean flavors of the seafood.

* Halibut and Sea Urchin Carpaccio ""Thinly sliced halibut topped with seared sea urchin, green onion, momiji oroshi and yuzu ponzu."" ($12.50) - Although delicately presently, it lacked something. The flavors weren't coming out as much as we would have hoped for this dish.

* Tsukune with Oroshi Ponzu ($3.50) - It's made with ground pork and was surprisingly quite juicy. Their yakitori does take awhile, so I suggest putting those orders in early. They use Binchotan charcoal (versus a gas grill or regular charcoal), which means the food grills at a lower temperature for a longer period of time. Be sure to utilize their condiments, specifically the Buta miso which is made from miso and crispy pork discards.

* Otsumami 3 Kinds ($5) - We received bean sprouts, squid and seaweed, and bonito flakes and veggies. It was a little uninspiring. It does change regularly though. 

We tried ordering their Match soft serve, but it was unavailable. 

Overall, food was good. I would come back just for the Crispy Chips and Yamaimo Chips for sure. I would request light sauce or sauce on the side for the sashimi dishes, but that's my preference. I would definitely be interested to see what other specials they offer and any additions to their current menu. Service was attentive and polite. Water glasses were constantly filled and they worked as a team checking up on us. Love that.

Ambiance: 4 - A rather small place with 8 tables and one set aside in a separate ""party area"". However, if you don't want to wait long for a table, there's usually some seats at the bar!

Service: 5 - Fast, friendly, attentive. Honestly the service was so good that I don't have anything to say about it. 

Food: 4 - Let me just list off the ones that I really loved: 

//Yellowtail Collar: Yummy, tender. Always a fan favorite if you love fish. 
//Chicken Karage: Fried chicken that is melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I love chicken so it was one of my favorites. p.s. I dipped it in soy sauce ;)
//Duck with Balsamic sauce: Since it's small plates, they only give you one stick...but it is DELICIOUS. 

They are known for their yakitori, but they will also give you a small menu with their special items on it!

5084394,2018-02-24,6,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"Still in awe as I write this review of Hachi. As a fairly frequent traveler to Japan, I can now say that I've found an izakaya as good as most in Tokyo. The only issue is that Hachi is in Vegas and not in LA. First heard of this place from a good friend that happens to travel to Vegas once a year. We were eating at Totoraku when he mentioned he was heading for Vegas for a little fun and asked whether or not I've tried Hachi. Now I don't travel to Vegas much anymore so I am slowly discovering hidden gems off the Strip.

Made reservations easily via a phone call and with a little coercing, Hachi was able to squeeze us in during CNY. Arrived to a fairly packed restaurant (I think I only saw a few seats open at the bar) and waited a few minutes as they cleaned up a booth for our party. The first thing I noticed while walking in was the yakitori grill full of skewers. I love how this place uses bintochan charcoal which produces some amazing flavor. 

Ordered a pitcher of Kirin and a small bottle of dassai while we looked over the menu. The waitress quickly brought over the drinks and offered a few suggestions. 

Started off with the yamaimo chips, crispy chips and chicken karaage. The three were brought out fairly quickly and all were perfectly fried to a golden brown. Out of the three appetizers, I loved the crispy chips (fried chicken skin) and the karaage. The crispy chips paired well with the beer and thought that it was perfectly seasoned (especially after a quick squeeze of the lemon). What I found unique about the karaage was that they do include some of the chicken skin which added a nice crunch to the juicy and tender pieces of chicken. Once again, a quick squeeze of the lemon added a nice brightness of flavor to the well seasoned fried goodness. 

We ended up ordering the hachi salad (to balance out all of the yakitori that would be coming) which was pretty tasty as well and wasn't drowning in salad dressing. 

Out of all the yakitori that we ordered (and we ended up ordering several rounds of it) my favorite few had to have been the beef tongue, wagyu beef, pork belly and enoki mushroom. Only complaint I had was that the enoki mushroom was a bit overly sauced during a few rounds.

As for the sushi items, we ordered the scallop carpaccio which was super tasty as the combination of sweet scallops, olive oil, yuzu and yuzu miso paired perfectly.  Only regret was not being able to order more since I wasted my stomach space at a less than memorable Hainan chicken rice place for lunch. The steamed abalone was also pretty tasty especially when they serve it with bits of the liver and add a splash of truffle oil to it!! The uni was super sweet though it didn't appear to have been from Hokkaido, it was tasty nonetheless.

I can't wait to head back here for dinner once again. Hopefully in the not so distant future. To the owners and chefs here at Hachi, please consider opening up a location in LA!!!

Oh I also wish they'd consider lowering the temperature inside the restaurant. Service was also phenomenal. Definitely do head here for dinner if you're in the area but I would recommend making reservations as this place gets packed.",w-hrD3-YJXbDUlvBwrpWtA,7,7,5,s_RAy9xfjo4porHPxquqIA

Wagyu beef plate was cooked perfectly. Katsu pork cutlet was tender. Offered winter specialty Oden soup, flavor was rather light; first time ever seen Oden in America. Quite a treat ! Honey toast ice cream is as good as it looks. All this plus sake came to $77 for two.

If you enjoy grilled salmon, try their grilled salmon collar or any other grilled fish collar. This part of the fish is super tender with some fat on it. The grilled fish skin is crispy and lightly salted. Hachi is the place I always take my out of town friends to, and everyone always enjoy their food and hospitality.",2HNU4vNP8c_EtWG4MhlVVw,1,1,5,6429aYEdIZjUCt9__95Scw

Note:  This review is based on two visits and includes seasonal specials that may not be currently available.

Tip:  Order in waves.  Dishes are brought out when they are ready.

Raw - Limited, straight forward, and fresh.  Correctly graded chutoro, clean tasting hamachi and halibut.  The salmon and aji could both be higher grade and fattier but for the price, all good.  

Deep fried - Again, straight forward, no free ranged chickens or specially sourced beef.  The ""juicy"" chicken karaage is in fact juicy; cooked mid well, tender, with a well seasoned coating.  The ika karaage, aggressively seasoned but slightly rubbery.  If available, the deep fried chicken skin (AKA crack) is... suffice it to say, I'm salivating just thinking about the crispy, salty, goodness.  

Grilled - The squid, excellent.  Perfectly grilled with the right amount of charred bitterness on the outside and tender inside.  Correctly grilled, aggressively seasoned hamachi kama, salmon kama, and saba filet.  

Robatayaki - One skewer  per order.  Most prepared either with just salt or a sweetened soy based sauce.  No exotics.  Two choices of chicken (thigh and wing).  Requested mid rare and grilled to temp with no argument, juicy.  Crispy fat pork belly made better by adding the house miso.  Very good, thick sliced, beef tongue.  A squeeze of lemon and ahhhh.  If available, the whole smelt is good eats.  The stomach imparts a fishy bitterness that makes the rest of the flesh taste sweet.

Efficient and friendly service.

Well chosen selection of sake by the bottle.  Reasonable markup.

Located on Jones, in the same plaza as China Mama and Chada Thai, Hachi is a relative newcomer to the growing izakaya scene in Las Vegas' Chinatown and owned by the team behind acclaimed Ramen Sora it was with two friends and a four year old that dinner was enjoyed this past Saturday, the results a bit mixed but at times more impressive than Raku at a lower pricepoint and far less of a hassle.

Spacious in layout, a center bar welcoming solos and those looking to experience a limited selection of raw fish cut to order, it was at one of the comfortable booths circling the restaurant perimeter that our group was sat and with service always nearby, pleasant, and happy to answer questions it was after a brief description of daily specials that a bakers-dozen items were selected, several ordered in duplicate with the total bill tallying just under $30 per person.

Unfortunately one of those places to which ""coursing out"" plates is a foreign concept, despite several requests not to overwhelm the table, it was with a relatively limp and flavorless presentation of chilled omelet that the meal kicked off, but following this up almost immediately with two styles of fried crisps both the chicken skins and house-special mountain yam were lightly seasoned and virtually oilless, the first bold bit of flavor presented by garlic soaked edamame that permeated the air in a ten foot radius.

Underwhelming again with buttered mushrooms that were tender enough, though not particularly well displayed beneath too much salt, it was with the whole squid that grilled items began to arrive, the tenderness of the cephalopod's flesh found beneath snappy initial resistance as a kiss of charred lemon added 'pop' with or without the spicy mayo addition.

Surprised by the thickness of fried chicken thigh that was both tender and immensely juicy on a plate of  miso sauce imbued with smoke and onions the evening's most intriguing bite was soon offered by ""Cheese Chikuwa Tempura,"" the thinly rolled fish layer not dissimilar to the flavor of salt-cod beneath light batter with a gooey mozzarella interior.

Progressing to three items from the low temperature binchotan grill, all 'Out-Rakuing' Raku in terms of smoke profile and tenderness with the ground pork Tsukune particularly memorable amongst the group, it was with a bit less enthusiasm that the daily appetizer trio hit out table - the raw tuna well flavored while the rest were mostly throwaways, the daily special beef tongue marred by being overcooked by tableside searing, a Bill Walton quote-in-waiting about ""letting the show get in the way of the game.""

Saddening the little fella at the table by informing us that softserve was unavailable it was nonetheless in two desserts that the evening called it an end and although the bittersweet panna cotta with an unexpected red bean core was a bit meager in portion considering the $6 pricetag, the $7.98 Honey Toast more than made up for it as the half-loaf was presented golden, buttery, and crisp yet at the same time still saturated with sweetness.

***Excelling with some items while fumbling and frustrating with others that seemed slipshod in their execution despite otherwise good ingredients and intentions, Hachi is the sort of place where a good meal can be had at a relatively low investment while a more memorable overall experience would be better sought at Raku for those interested in esoterica or Kyara at a similar cost.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,3,ez7DjN6bQ3dQgR94_JSErA

1. Yellowtail sashimi.

3. Scallop sushi (the scallop itself was fantastic, great flavor and a nice sweetness to it but the rice was just okay. It fell part when I picked it up and I personally prefer sushi rice with a little more vinegar in the seasoning.)
4. Eggplant cold appetizer
5. Eel yakitori. We ordered few other yakitori items like pork belly, duck etc... Most of them are alright but the eel was excellent, the charcoal grill works great for the eel, it gave a nice smokey flavor to the fish.

Scallop nigiri was tasty and fresh.

The hama-something clams were really good, but so overpriced. Almost $3 for a single clam the size of a dollar coin.

DO NOT I repeat DO NOT get the giant clam. It wasnt even a clam it was like a fucking conch. It was super rubbery and tough, and had a nasty ocean animal innard taste to it once you got inside the clam. Huge waste of $15 and was a bit annoyed because the waitress recommended it to us -_-...

Tsukune was good.. didnt really understand how I was supposed to eat it with the poached egg so I ended up basically drinking egg.

The grilled squid was my favorite, cooked perfectly and great flavor and tasty sauce.

The pork skewers were meh.. nothing spectacular.

Bacon tomato and bacon enoki were both tasty. Cant really fuck up grilled bacon.

The chashu pork bowl was delicious, but they are pretty stingy with the pork.

Udon hotpot was meh

Unagi bowl was meh, granted I was pretty full when eating it, but still nothing out of this world. Also barely any charcoal grilled flavor to it.

The HONEY TOAST was seriously the highlight. I demolished like half of it by myself. The vanilla ice cream goes so good with the warm, sweet, crunchy, honey covered toast. The ice cream itself was really good too.

I left stuffed, but we spent over $100 for 2 people.. not sure ill be back any time soon with that kind of price point with so many other delicious much cheaper places there are in Vegas",2r0CnsEbhBo75KYoVF8eGA,0,0,4,OJWbsMq81ajEVvwvMY77nw

5774342,2015-09-08,3,Cy8XYYDrZ5wd3Bq-toXMsg,"I've been struggling to write this review and give it a star rating because I both loved it, then quickly afterwards hated it as I got a dose of food poisoning that required immediate bathroom attention. I'll give it 3.5 stars for now and when I go next time I'm sure I'll bump it up.

Went here on a Saturday night with my friend around 7pm. As usual, no place to park in this busy shopping center parking lot. So we parked next door near the Filipino place. 

Nice looking place. I remember eating here when it was a Pho restaurant a long time ago, and the space is nice with several tables around the edge, and a long counter area ala a sushi place, which they have, but really you come here for the marinated meat BBQ sticks. Menus dropped off and drink orders taken quickly. Our waitress must have been new because she had to go ask when I inquired about the pricing on the specials. Nonetheless she did a nice job even though it was kind of weird getting the meat sticks at different times and not all at once. 

We ordered:

Salmon belly special - lightly seared and served sashimi style with salmon egg and sauces. Since I was the only one who ate this it might be the culprit. It was good.

Chicken Thigh Tare style - very good flavor. My first couple pieces here were so tender that maybe they weren't cooked through because I ordered a couple more of these sticks later and they weren't as tender. This might be the other culprit but this stick was shared.  

Umeshiso Yaki - w/sour plum and japanese basil. These were just ok, I wasn't wowed by the flavor and didn't order more later in the meal.

Pork belly tare style - absolutely delicious. I love pork belly and these didn't disappoint. 

Magic Mountain - salmon and cream cheese wrapped by soy paper and deep fried. This was delicious as well, a combination of my two favorites.

Beef Misozuke - This was actually one of the very first japanese yakitori meals that I'd ever had as a kid. This version was so-so...didn't have any flavors jumping out at me. 

Garlic Edaname - I believe this is fried in butter and garlic instead of steamed. It was really tasty. 

Overall, I'd come here again. I liked many items and saw many more on the menu to try. I'm a bit concerned with the quality control though.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,7,3,3,4IQQR2XE-ASSul8NQg0uhA

The beef tataki, tuna carpaccio, and seared mackerel were also good.

The Wagyu beef is a must as well - the meat is not HUGE but you don't need it - the bites make you close your eyes and make food noises.

From the same group that brought you Ramen Sora, Hachi is the new Japanese yakatori and small plates restaurant in town, rounding out the impressive and delicious Asian eats that populate this strip mall on Jones & Spring Mtn. 

So why is this place so great?
FIrst, the food is delicious. The yakatori here is so juicy and flavorful, whatever it is about that charcoal grill they have, it's magic! All the meats are seriously cooked to perfection. Tiny little skewer portions so you can try tons of different meats/flavors! My favorite is the chicken w/ salt and the tsukune pork.  Also, I'd recommend the bacon wrapped mochi....it's good, trust me!!!!  Their fish is also incredibly fresh. Portions are small, but this is a small plates kind of place :)

Second, the ambiance. It's a small restaurant that is super clean, with a fresh minimalist Japanese feel. Music doesn't really fit (dance music), but I like dancing ;)

Finally, the service is pretty good. The servers are very knowledgable about the menu.  Not the most efficient restaurant (took a while to get the bill), but overall no overt complaints.

Now let's get to the FOOD!

The yakitori (I don't know how to spell it) is amazing and at a great price! I like the salmon collar. It's HUGE! I also love getting the tomato cherries wrapped with bacon, they're honestly really tasty. I've gotten the bowls and they were all delicious. Everything is a good size at a reasonable price and it tastes authentic and juicy! Definitely try the Miso soup as it is special there and has a lot of stuff in it and can definitely fill you up unlike the plain miso soup at other places.

Overall, this is a great place to dine in and bring your friends for small talk or a gathering. The guys that work the sushi bar are all great and super kind. You will definitely see me eating here a lot!!!",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,10,8,5,KHdyWLVScnbhoDuNHC6E2g
