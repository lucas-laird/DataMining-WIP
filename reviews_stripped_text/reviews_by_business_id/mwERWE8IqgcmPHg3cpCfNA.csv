478674,2011-11-14,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"Great food, great prices. Good place to go during lunch time as their specials offer a lot of food for a modest price. 
I had their pad thai and it was delicious. It came with soup, vegetables and rice (not sure if this was due to been a lunch special) and it was all priced at $5.95. 

Service was good and the waitress did her regular checks around the table to ensure we were satisfied.

The only things that hurts this restaurant is not been located on the strip (this might be the reason for the modest prices). If you are hitting the old downtown in Vegas, make sure to make a stop at this restaurant and have one of their special, you wont be disappointed. 

Another issue was the decor, it is Thai decor, but it isnt the most attractive restaurant. It feels more like a old dinner/thai restaurant. 

If you are just looking to have good food and dont mind the looks of the restaurant, I highly recommend it.",IEVSSB9yb4Ooi-xP3NmRBg,0,0,4,DDKI8yEqtf6Yd-Tg9dDyVA
929814,2011-07-16,1,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"I appreciate their simple decor and their family-owned atmosphere, but the food is just okay. Pad see ew was way too sweet and overcooked to the point that the noodles kind of crumbled when you ate it, but the pad thai wasn't too bad. Sometimes I got some hard noodles. 

While the service was pretty good, I don't think we'll be back. Not when there are way better Thai places in Vegas (Lotus of Siam).",aoCX6FnGcFEliOZbCO4qHA,1,1,2,ou5vIW1Hby3Dngo3EBwWgQ

2014444,2010-07-16,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"Quick and simple works sometimes, especially when it's tasty-enough.

Thai Vegas qualifies under all three.  They offer 14 great lunch specials with meat dishes in a variety of Thai sauces and a side of rice (and a spring roll and salad/soup).  The sauces available include curry, hot chili, mint chili and lots more--Pad Thai's also an option  The dishes aren't over-the-top amazing, but they're tasty enough to bring you back week after week for the lunch special.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,2,3,ZY-v6pHKkr0H6uTRlKo2OQ
2317661,2010-12-20,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"So after coming downstairs from my work to discover it was raining, I saw my beloved Curbside Caf√© truck pulling away.  I guess they weren't getting enough business with the rain.  So I decided to hoof it out to Thai Vegas, hoping that nearby Fremont Street Experience would provide some shelter from the rain.  Did you know that dome over the Experience isn't solid?  Geez.

I used to come to Thai Vegas a lot when I worked nearby.  Ever since I moved I haven't been back.  This is a great place for a fast, good lunch.  And they have 15 lunch specials (see pic for lunch specials) - even more if you count the fact that you can get chicken broccoli instead of beef and red curry instead of yellow now.  

All the tables are covered with plastic picnic tablecloths.  I got the Happy Birthday one!  How did they know my birthday was coming up? They don't call me Holly for nothing.  

The lunch specials come with an eggroll and soup or salad.  Also you have a choice of steamed rice or fried rice.  All for $5.95.  Brown rice is an option for $1 more.  The soup varies but today is was a tofu and chicken soup with seaweed in a fish sauce.  Pretty good rainy day soup.  I haven't had the salad in a while, but last time I did, it was a typical iceberg salad with ginger dressing.  The vegetable eggroll comes with a sweet and sour sauce, which is decent.  

I love the yellow chicken curry but I decided to be different today and get spicy eggplant chicken.  This dish is made from ground chicken instead of chicken breast pieces like the chicken curry.  It was pretty good but not at all spicy.  I can't blame restaurants for this because so many customers order spicy food and then complain that it is actually spicy.  Luckily, there is red chili sauce on the table so I was able to make it spicy with that.  That made it pretty tasty.

You can order off the menu during lunch.  It's not as great of a deal as the lunch specials but the food seems to be slightly higher quality.  I had the Thai beef salad once and it was excellent.

The only thing that was disappointing is that I did not get the check very quickly.  I think they were busy taking phone orders.  They do offer food to go.  A woman came in after me to get takeout and got her food before I even finished my soup.  They are amazingly fast with the food.   

The sign doesn't say Thai Vegas, but actually says Vegas Chinese and Thai Restaurant.  The window says Thai Vegas on it, but the difference in signs can be confusing.  Just look at my pics to make sure you have the right place.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,3,2,4,wzF19KcstaOE_vQJMUKD6Q

2549511,2006-11-10,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"I'm giving this place 3 stars - 2 for food, and one for being non-smoking, a rare commodity in this area.

Like many places in the area, they serve both Thai and Chinese.  I guess there's not enough demand for pure Thai restaurants, so the Thai places serve Chinese dishes as well.

They have a good selection of lunch specials.  The food was just average - a little greasy, not super flavorful, though there was a good amount of it.

If you need a respite from the smoke, pop in for a Thai Ice Tea.  If you want good Thai food, I'd look elsewhere, unless you're stuck in the area and need to find food pronto.",m7mQf4FbNRZ6u1wrHEmonQ,2,0,3,GXeQiz4fb-C5UKoscBk_-A
2833886,2012-03-12,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"A very surprising place! First it's on a side street near the fame downtown Freemont street and second, it looks like a run down american place...

However, the Thai food is great and they make it really spicy if you ask for it! I particularly like the ""Tom Kha Gai"" (chicken coconut soup) which  you can order in a hot pot and share. The green curry is also one of my favorites here and so is the ""Nua Num Tuk"" (beef salad thai style).

Based on what I saw and other critics, I think it's fair to say that you should have Thai food here and avoid any chinese items.",seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg,1,0,4,NRnHOIW-c6fKlpErDVLUNQ
3425776,2012-05-09,5,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"So far, my worst Chinese food experience ever! My mistake though, as I should have known better when I entered the restaurant. Atrocious decor, no one to greet me, and only a couple eating there. But I was craving for Asian food, and this place was right next to my hotel. I ordered egg rolls + Orange chicken (which came with steamed rice). The rolls were so greasy that I truly started to feel nauseous. The worst was the Orange chicken. In my book, the chicken has to be tender inside and crispy on the outside... Well, it was literally dried! I almost choked on it! When the waitress took away the half full dishes, she did not bother ask me if everything was fine... She knew better!

3769161,2011-08-20,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"I will parrot some earlier comments - this place has the aesthetics of a soup kitchen...but check your attitude at the door; this place has FANTASTIC food of you know how to order.  If you are into ""mild"" thai, you may just be disappointed,  go to a chain.  If you are into REAL thai, COME HERE!  

Helpful tip - they are brown-bag friendly and there is a liquor store around the block, back up Freemont...be prepared and order two levels of hot above your normal.  STRAP IN, it's worth it.

BOOOOO  This fabulous dive has closed - also, don't bother with the Thai place across the strip on fremont.  See review: it sucks.",y7QdQmpe5-Z6EDuPt1qu6g,1,1,4,Ud5sEO29tPJvRrBTsPsUjg

4147702,2012-03-22,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"Thai Vegas was recommended to me by a co-worker recently so I thought I would give it a try for lunch.  I am pleased with it.  I ordered the Red Chicken Curry lunch special (#7).  A different co-worker ordered the Beef Pepper Steak (#6).  I rather enjoyed my curry.  It was remarkably fragrant with a flavor to match.  It was sweet from the coconut milk yet spicy enough to easily clear my sinuses.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and spice without overwhelming my palate or the other flavors of the curry with the bamboo, bell peppers and chicken.  My one complaint with it is that it was not as thick and creamy as some other similar curry dishes I've had from other local Thai establishments.  Another minor complaint is that the salad did not seem to have a dressing.  There was a cup of warm sweet and sour type sauce I assume was for the rice.  I used it on the salad and put my curry on the rice.  All in all, for $5.95 I got an egg roll, salad, fried rice and curry.  Plus there is no delivery fee.  I could not ask for more.  Is this my favorite Thai restaurant? No, but it is good and relatively affordable.  I will likely go back again in the future. 

As for the three star rating, I would prefer to give 3.5.  I cannot give a four star rating based on my co-workers comments of it not being as good as Maui Rose, a place she likes but cannot really be compared as it is Hawaiian rather than Thai.  She said the rice was too starchy and the beef was not tender.  For this, I must give only three stars.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,0,0,3,ZUH1ar_8N8rNFWf6B_g9Bw
4176235,2011-07-10,0,mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA,"I used to live in Thailand and I pretty much always find super Americanized Thai food.  This place is legit.  They serve southern style Thai food the way it is supposed to be served.  The people who work there are super friendly (also Thai style).  I order delivery from here pretty much at least once a week.  To the person who didn't like the pad thai I would recommend trying something else.  Pad Thai is pretty much only eaten by Americans and usually lacks the flavor and spice of the other dishes.  It is prepared to be less spicy and more bland.  
The price can not be beat.  5.95 lunch special.  And my boyfriend and i order two days worth of food sometimes and it comes to $30.  
If you are looking for something with little asian statues and nice decorating, you will be very disappointed.  It is literally like what you find traveling off the highways in Thailand.

The prices are downright cheap and the pad thai is outstanding.  If you are staying downtown and looking for a tasty meal, this place should be at the top of the list.

Be forewarned, the atmosphere in downtown Las Vegas starts at tourist friendly and festive on Fremont Street and quickly degrades to skid row-esque as you venture away from Fremont.  This delectable meal requires that you trek about 75 feet past the point where the glitz of Fremont Street ends and the only moderately lit streets of the rest of downtown Vegas begin.  You will be exiting the ""tourist zone"".  Enjoy your adventure into the dark realm of Vegas' underground thai food scene.

The restaurant deserves 2 stars for not being in a casino and having a laid back ambiance.

The food, meh.  I ordered a few things just to sample them and they were rather bad actually.  The tofu was overcooked, the duck (I know I shouldn't have ordered at a place like this) was chewy and did not have a lot of meat.

Might be OK for a quick lunch but beyond that forget about it.  

Extremely unhealthy food.  Trans fat, MSG, and loads and loads of salt.  Well this stuff should make anything palatable and that was barely the case at Thai Vegas.
