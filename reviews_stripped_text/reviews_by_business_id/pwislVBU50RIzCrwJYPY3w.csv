Immediately upon entering the store the woman working the cash register said ""to go?"" She didn't say hi or anything and when we told her for here she said ""we close at 9"" Ok great it's 8:23 that means I have 37 minutes to eat. Now I would understand if it was 853 but come on. I've been to other restaurants that have served customers up until the last minutes of closing. I understand you want to go home but your business is open until 9 so that means I should be able to get food until then. I'm not that person who goes into a restaurant 5 minutes before close anyway and I thought 823 was a reasonable time to eat considering I just got off work at 7.

Anyways I ordered the loco moco plate which I've never had, and the bf ordered the bbq chicken plate. The loco moco was disappointing. The burger meat was not seasoned and the gravy was bland. The only thing I enjoyed was the mac salad I could just order that and be happy. The bbq chicken was just ok it's teriyaki chicken basically.

I guess they didn't know how to prepare the BBQ beef as well because it was a little too well done. The lau lau needed more salt too. The highlight for me was the macaroni salad. However, I tend to love most things that try to kill me from the inside out.

Ok so what the heck is this place first of all? Plate lunch? What am I doing, talking another language? Huh?

Allright - newbies (or frequent fliers who are reading this). Plate lunch is a plate (or styrofoam container) loaded with 1) 2 enormous scoops of white rice, 2) macaroni salad Hawaiian style (it's good, trust me, just more mayo than the usual) 3) meat of your choice 4) drink of your choice

Now - when you enter, you aren't listening to anything but Island Reggae, (different than Jamaican Reggae). There are brightly colored walls, decorated with surf boards, and other surf related items.

Family favs here are the Chicken Katsu, Chicken Katsu Curry, Fried Mahi Mahi, and BBQ Chicken. Haven't had the Lau Lau at any L&L mainland or in Oahu due to the fact that we get our Lau Lau from a particular market in HI only. (Sorry L&L, we just love it so we stock up.)

I enjoy the Mochico chicken here more than at other places I've tried it at. They now have fried wontons which is basically the filling in the eggroll (clear noodles,little bits of ground pork,minced veggies and lots of black pepper) filled into wontons and then fried. Yummers!!!!
My friend tried the siopao (stuffed steamed bun) and she liked it. I asked if they could put egg into my portuguese sausage musubi and they did and it was so freakin good dipped into sriracha sauce-Yeah Baby....
The last time we ordered for pick-up they forgot to put our butter mochi in our order but when we ordered again she remembered on her own that she forgot to put it in the last time and gave it to us. The butter mochi is a yummy sweet snack. Like my friend said it tastes like a cross between mochi and poundcake. They now have smoothies- the lady said it's juice,ice cream & crushed ice. So I got the Papaya smoothie and honestly I didn't like it too much. It was a bit tangy and I normally like tangy but I prefer my smoothies to be more on the sweet side but I'll try Mango next time.We will never stop ordering from here....",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,2,0,4,lOPflDjO9Lc9wsOJxi5SqQ

But the katsu was over saturated from the curry sauce and no longer brilliantly crispy.  That same curry sauce was more like a gravy with a hint of curry spice. I would have prefered something listed as  curry to taste as such. If it was to be just a sauce it would have been good. The vegetables in the bowl were soggy and over steamed. The rice was not bad but some more of the so-called curry sauce would have been a nice touch to the otherwise plain grains. The other part of my meal, my typical order of Spam musubi, was superb. The nori was tender. The Spam was just the right thickness. There was a perfect amount of teriyaki sauce. And the rice held together as it was the perfect stickiness. I will continue eating here.

The main menu is very good. My favorites being the Laulau & BBQ Beef or Chicken plates. I love the Butter Mochi. Everything else is pretty good also. I will say some of the Asian items, you would be better off getting from a real Asian restaurant, like the egg rolls. The Madasada's are frozen, not made from scratch, but not bad. Another thing, the Ahi Poke, isn't even close to being Hawaiian, but I guess it would be too much to expect it to be made with Kukui nut oil & Hawaiian Limu.

The eggs were ordered over medium (i.e. slightly runny yoke) and when I got home, assuming my meal was prepared correctly, since it seemed to be a consistent place to eat at first.  The eggs were so overcooked, the yolks appeared similar in texture/visual to a hard boiled egg, not a fried egg.  Called them back and had to explain the issue twice, since once isn't enough for them, and they offered to replace it, but trusting the same ""cook"" (using that term loosely, as I highly doubt there's anybody working in that kitchen who graduated from culinary school) to prepare the same meal again, and expecting the same results.  Your welcome to play roulette with your palette but expect mixed results and maybe even not your order at all...

**UPDATE 11-08-15**
Attempted to eat here at the request of my gf (she knows my thoughts on the cook who's still working here).  My food was not cooked properly yet again, but her's was alright, but her Katsu Chicken was extremely tough/lots of fatty tissue to get through.  Now she's on the same page as I.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,1,0,1,sk-iTYNRlohWefdue16-nw

Hell no moa even fish cake and den! They don't have veggies 'cause ""vegetables are expensive."" For how much they charge I'd expect it to at least have taste! Oh how I miss Zippy's saimin. I'll have to stick with California Hotel for my saimin fixes. 

Honestly I usually come here for a quick kalbi fix...I never have issues with my kalbi or katsu...THANK GOD! 

On a side note, when you can tell someone is from Hawaii, talking small kine pidgin...small kine talk back, lol.",FumV143KKEC-PVGGPKTPTA,0,0,2,gI1Cu3ZAxGEgLSZhNV7YGQ

5651046,2013-09-08,0,pwislVBU50RIzCrwJYPY3w,"This is definitely my one out of two go-to L&L places after I'm done shopping around the area. They're not always consistent, so that's why I had to deduct one point from them.

Anyway, FOOD! I always order their regular chicken katsu. It comes with two scoops of rice, A LOT of chicken katsu, two cups of sauce, and a scoop of macaroni salad. Portion of rice is a little small, but I don't eat much rice anyway -- It may be a problem to some people, but not to me. They put a bunch of chicken katsu in the box. I swear, I never ever finish it. I wish they would add more sauce in those cups cos sometimes they're only filled 1/3 of the way :( Macaroni salad is always so good for the tummy and bad for the heart, haha.

Their service is okay. Some days I get a cashier person who is nice and actually SMILES and some days they're just grumpy and frowny. I'm actually BIG on people who smile. I love it when people SMILE. If your'e friendly and at least pretend to love your job, I will tip. If not, then well.. you get the hint. 

I would come back. There's this push & pull relationship that I have with L&L, so I'll definitely be back here for more of my favorite chicken katsu!",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,0,4,IMFZdJ5Fjb5v1y6YXKUVMQ
5735999,2017-01-17,0,pwislVBU50RIzCrwJYPY3w,I wish I could give it no stars. I went to the Nellis location. It smelled like a sewer in there. I ordered chicken katsu and bbq short ribs. When I got home I noticed something black on top of my macaroni salad. I took the top off and there was a dead fly. I went back and got my money. Whoever made this order im sure saw the fly before putting the lid on it. Just gross. I wont eat there again.,5Sx6OBVlbbXNtt2aAn1HiA,0,0,1,euFUU4J0u_VDgUyH2VvaPg
5775317,2017-10-31,0,pwislVBU50RIzCrwJYPY3w,"Usually pretty consistent on the food, especially the chicken katsu with or without curry or the mix plate.  But I ordered the roast pork...they don't have a mini so you have to order the regular plate.  Ordered take out so when I got home, I noticed that it was really overcooked and pretty dry tasting.  It was also really spicy...wasn't sure if the lid fell off the pepper!  I think I will stick to something that I know they do well.

I came here for a lunch and wanted to test an Hawaii bbq restaurant  and you can be sure I will remember the result.
This is really bad and ribs are especially horrible.
I'm really not ready to take my tickets for Hawaii!",Klq75XUycV-M_ggyOSwiWA,0,0,1,3M-gj6JknLe9dNQ7XFkOhg

L&L Hawaiian BBQ is a signature name here in Las Vegas, Hawaii and the west coast. I was first introduced to it after a day of shopping with some friends when I first arrived here and my initial experience was great! I've come to realize that it was my excitement at the idea that I could order Spam Musubi, Saimen, and Poki anytime I felt like it.

Over the years, however, I've come to realize that you pay a pretty penny for a lot of average food. Again, this franchise is well know (and widely available) across Las Vegas with some pretty aggressive competition from other smaller, family owned Hawaiian BBQ location. The food is acceptable at most locations but sometimes you'll pay for a hearty alan of fat and not enough rice to accommodate it.

In all honesty, I enjoy the occasional visit to this rather ""homey"" location. The service is quick and the food is made to order (with the exception of the cold dishes and rice). Plates and single orders are available as well as party platters and ""to-go"" orders. Call to order is available but don't be upset if the operator taking your order is slightly rude... He or she is also manning the orders and payments at the location. So, overall, I gave three stars based on the price and the not-so-consistent outcome of some of their menu items.

Still an amazing taste of home for those Local Boys and Girls missing the islands. And if you're looking for something new, Hawaiian BBQ has a little of everything for everyone!",EApIYB1lMaH-r2quP42vTA,0,0,3,y8mkYkhb7Dbi38qwOr-YAg
