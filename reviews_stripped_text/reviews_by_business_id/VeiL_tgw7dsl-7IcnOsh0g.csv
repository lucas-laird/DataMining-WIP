4 different sushi rolls- all delicious... Can't recall the names except the 007 roll.

My girlfriend and I ate there a few nights back, we have been hearing nothing but great things about this new sushi restaurant in the area so we had to try it.

When we sat down in the cozy booth we looked over the extensive sushi menu, everything in the sushi window looked very fresh so we knew we would be eating great! Our server came over and got our drink orders, she explained to us about the 5 course $46 menu that the sushi chef makes especially for you so we decided to go with this option. We were not disappointed by any means, everything tasted so fresh and the rice that was accompanied with the sushi was the best I've ever had.

1030464,2016-09-26,4,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"Sushi Hiro is such a hot spot these days. There is always a line for a table especially around lunch time. 

Lunch and dinner specials are really what make this sushi joint great. For a decent price the lunch and dinner specials come with a huge portion. The sushi and sashimi specials come with miso soup and salad. They have a chef selection of fishes and all are good quality. The bento specials come with an entree of your choice, miso soup, salad, selected tempura, and a california roll. So much food!

If you do not want to eat the lunch or dinner specials, you can order al la carte. However, I don't recommend doing this. Whatever fish I ordered in nigiri and sashimi was not the fish they brought out to me. They claim to have all these rare fishes, but when I order them, they always bring me ""similar"" fishes and not the exact one I order. Just beware of this so you don't get ripped off.

Update: The yellowtail cappacio is really good! Take note that they put a lot of the oil sauce so I would ask for light sauce.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,8,7,4,XKlEYaWEt7ZaKwitwiOTUw

If you're staying on the strip, it is worth driving to this place as it delivers consistently better quality and without the ridiculously high prices.

My date and I decided on one roll and one small plate each - and we'd share everything.

We started with Yellowtail Carpaccio which was quite good and a very reasonable serving size. This would make a good main course for a lighter appetite.

Our two rolls were ""Mermaid Roll"" and ""Plum Roll"" (which, we were told, was the chef's specialty). Both were good, and were *huge*. 

We split an order of uni (sea urchin) which he liked more than I.

All in all - this was a *Lot* of food. Almost too much for two big guys. I would prefer smaller rolls - and then I'd get several, rather than one large roll each.  (Maybe they'll add a half-roll option?)

The total came out to what you would pay at any AYCE place, but the food quality was definitely a step up from that.

The staff that hosted us were attentive and kind, and did a great job making sure that my boyfriend and I were comfortable when we ate here.

I do see that there are several wonderful reviews, so please don't let this review deter from you trying Sushi Hiro! However, my boyfriend ordered the Tour of Tokyo, and I ordered the 007 roll. Both rolls were tasty, but under-seasoned, and left much to be desired (especially since we were both craving sushi that night!) Our dinner was palliated by the amazing azuki mochi ice cream (red bean) which was smooth and perfectly sweet. But, it was made way worse when a few drunk restaurant attendees came out of the restaurant and kept standing in the path of our vehicle as we tried to leave (even after we asked them kindly to move)! They were clearly severely inebriated and I think that more attention should've been paid to them by their waiter/waitress in the restaurant (it's a safety thing, really!)

Chef Hiro and his brother are two of the most friendly people I have met in Vegas. From the moment you enter and the moment you leave, you are met with warm smiles and leave feeling quite satisfied. It is a fact that they know how to run a successful business as high-quality food and superior service is their standard.

Sit at the sushi bar to ogle the fresh fish where friendly conversation is well-received and returned.  Brian, Stella and the hostess are very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive to all guests. 

Appetizer: Fresh Salmon Spring Roll - This is light and refreshing. Salmon sashimi, shrimp, green salad, shiso leave, kaiware radish wrapped with rice paper. This is served with sweet sesame dipping sauce.

Roll:  Plum Tree - Tuna, salmon, and yellowtail wrapped in rice and topped with red, wasabi green and orange fish roe. The presentation was marvelous - I almost did not want to eat it because it was too beautiful! The flavors were rich and the crunchy texture of the roe paired well with the soft and creamy texture of the fresh salmon.

Dessert: Strawberry and Red Bean Ice Cream: Another beautiful presentation of lightly drizzled chocolate with mochi ice cream from the popular desert spot, Mikawaya (Los Angeles).

Chef Hiro and his brother recommended I try the Omakase ($45-65) - this seems to be the item of highest value as other high-end restaurants charge at least double of the price. 

If you are in the area and would like to be served high-quality fresh foods with top-notch service, stop by Hiro Sushi!",cGok9ycGn_HvZaht9xkyPw,40,36,5,_mECcPem8vvN2ogvrx0_8w

I've only been by for lunch, where the omakase and chirashi prices are a bit lower. The dishes are consistently fresh, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. My go to is the chirashi bowl, and the chef is great about accommodating reasonable requests (no wasabi, no octopus, etc). Though they do offer a menu of rolls, I stick to their more traditional sushi options, which are simple but well executed. 

Note that you can order online to take your spectacular sushi feast home. I advise against this because of how great the dine-in presentation and service are, go when you can enjoy the whole experience!

Sometimes in sushi life not about quantity but quality. Although I only ordered one sushi roll (Crunchy Toro Special) from the daily special rolls. It was really really good. The fish quality was fresh and like the combination they came up with for the Crunchy Toro Roll). Not sure if maybe there thing or no doubt found the size of any of the speciality rolls HUGE. Basically your getting two or three extra pieces then regular sushi restaurant if ordered speciality roll. So warning if going specialty rolls two or three that LOT of food. The diversity of the speciality rolls is awesome. They literally have pictures of believe all the specialty rolls on the menu. Really not often seen full menu that literally every dish has picture with it. 

My entree ordered from the Dinner Bento Box and got the teriyaki chicken. They have few other protein options if going with the Bento Box. The thing that stood out for me. Most traditional Japanese restaurants that has the Bento or Box dinner on the menu. Not that big. The size at Sushi Hiro is pretty big. Literally every box is filled with food. It also come with miso soup and house salad. Both very tasty. The house salad nice fresh greens and the kicker was the salad dressing was awesome. I would buy bottle of that if they sold it. The teriyaki chicken was just ok. It could have been marinated longer or lacked distinct teriyaki flavor for me.

The service was five star. I came for dinner help celebrate another yelper Terri R birthday with other friends of hers. It was no big deal getting separate checks for party of seven. They were friendly, attentive, and nothing but five star service in my mind.

Fatty tuna ($8) and salmon belly ($7). Best tasting fish I've had in the valley. Have I had good fish else where? Yes, but it was topped with other heavy dressing sauces or ingredients. This was natural, simple and fresh without fishiness. I just can't explain it. 

Next we had the screaming O ($15), which was a fresh salad with tons of ahi tuna. Yum! Very large. I would eat one just as a lunch dish. 

Lastly we had a fatty tuna crunch roll ($15). Best roll I've had without all the crap dragging it down. Loved it! We even ordered a second one and the sushi chef gave us fresh cut jalapeños and chopped wasabi to try it even spicier. 

Five stars hands down. No AYCE? No problem!! We love AYCE but this beat AYCE by a long shot",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,6,5,4Na5c77bm94M-6tZeOz6IQ

It was a bit overwhelming at first due to the size of the menu and having to choose...so I snuck a look at the other yelp reviews. The highly recommended Chirashi was indeed really good, and large! I could do without the imitation crab among all that great fish though. I'm not sure if the chirashi is the same size at dinner and lunch, but it does cost quite a bit more at dinner. The Salmon Teriyaki box was also really good and a big portion, with great salmon quality.  We also had a salmon jaw, which was very good. My wife has to have her fish attached to bones so she had to have it. The Udon looked good, although I didn't try it. The dish that wasn't great was the chicken kara-age. I've had much better, but it was certainly OK.

2358711,2016-07-24,2,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"My expectations were high. Unfortunately- Sushi Hiro did not deliver on the following:
1) Bento Box- the Teri Beef was tender but the sauce had NO flavor. None. No sweetness. No saltiness. Jus blah. Shumai was cold in the middle and almost pasty. Gross. Portion is big but quantity never rules over quality. 
2) Tempura- no finesse. The tempura was not flaky and delicate. Instead it was globby, oily, and blah. To boot, I think the shrimp tempura was really ebi fry and not tempura. Big difference. 
3) Sushi Rice- could've used a bit more vinegar and tasted more like regular rice. On a couple of the rolls the rice was hard and almost pasted together. Weird sensation and not pleasant. 

Hiro did deliver on the following:
1) Service- excellent. Attentive, friendly, and sincere. Well trained staff. 
2) Ambiance- comfortable. Very clean restaurant. Booths with the curtains is a nice touch. 
3) Flexible- requested a substitution and was accommodated with a smile. 
4) Quality of Fish- on point. Fresh. 

Bottom line- next time we'll go for sashimi and nigiri. I get the feeling they offer the bento to cast a wider net of diners but the attention is on the fish. Not on the bento. I hope they pay more attention to the quality of the sushi rice and maintain the quality of the fish.",6zUfFgBPJSV81WJFrMMJRQ,2,0,2,XCsvNdLnEzkEdoqzvb9BYw

2674875,2018-04-18,0,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"This review would have 5 stars if it were only for the food. We can only give 3 and would even lower it for the several issues and observances at the sushi bar during our meal. Please read to the end.

First, the good: The fish is amazing. Fresh and portions are very generous. The presentation is very pretty. We had kanpachi (amberjack yellowtail) sashimi and sushi, umi masu (ocean trout) sashimi and sushi, uni, salmon and tuna sushi and a rock and roll.

The bad: We sat down at the sushi bar around 5:15 on a Tuesday.  There were only 4 people at the sushi bar and one party in a booth. The 2 waitresses were very disorganized and hurried.  We were not recognized at the bar for a while then our drink orders were taken. After waiting longer the sous chef finally came to take our order. I knew what I wanted but my husband did not so I ordered sashimi kanpachi, uni masu, salmon and tuna.  The sous chef milled around, obviously not making food, and finally the sushi chef asked him what our order was and began making it. It was obvious that he had forgotten because I received only kanpachi and uni masu. At this point a waitress came to take my husband's order. He ordered sushi kanpachi, uni masu, uni and a rock and roll. We were presented with 2 orders (4 pieces of each) of tuna and salmon sushi that we neither ordered that much of or prepared that way. My husband finally got his food after much confusion and miscommunication between the waitresses and chef with near arguments in front of us and a ""we'll talk about this later"" from the chef to the waitress. We for sure double checked our bill and found we were charged 3 times for one thing that we only ordered 1 of and 3 times for another item we ordered 2 of. 

The worst: Sitting at the sushi bar allows customers to view the chefs making food. It's fun and I enjoy it. This time it was very obvious that extremely dirty towels were being used to wipe the food prep, knives, and hands. At one point, the sous chef was chopping salmon with one of the dirty rags about 3 inches from the fish. He wipes a hand on the towel, continues to chop fish using both hands to mix. A piece of the salmon dropped ON the dirty towel and he picked it up and put it back in the mixture. Sushi Hiro has a unique item on the menu, Wagyu carpaccio.  We did not order it but saw it prepared for others. One order sat on the sushi bar, ready to go out, for about 10 minutes before the waitress finally picked it up. 

This experience is very disheartening.  I guess had I not seen the dirty towels I would not have known but nonetheless, I did see them and the manner in which they are used. It's very hard to find a really good sushi restaurant in Henderson and I wish all the negatives would not have happened because the food was so delicious with generous portions and so fresh and that in itself is hard to find. Can I go back without worrying about contamination?

EDIT 6/1/18: I had reported this to the health department and I looked today to see that a routine inspection happened on 4/23/18, 6 days after my complaint to SNHD.  I see they got their grade lowered to a B and had 20 demerits on routine inspections.",J7_9NQbVDV95N25BJ3aAiw,0,0,3,W9gvkYABv5e01aRgPZCSmQ

We were pleasantly greeted upon entering and promptly seated. I had my toddler with me and it was very nice that our server asked me where I would like the high chair placed. Our drink order was taken and our food order was placed. 

I ordered the salmon dinner bento box and my husband ordered 2 sushi rolls. The miso soup and salad that came with my dinner came out immediately.  Unfortunately, the rest of our food took a REALLY long time to come out.  When our server, Grace saw a the look on my face, she came right over to our table to check on us.

Folks in Henderson don't have to drive to the Strip or China Town for excellent Japanese. This modest and modern spot has a long sushi counter. It's the best spot to dine if you want to watch the chefs in action. The omakase (two different options) is reasonably priced at $49 and $69, a bargain for the quality and amount of food you get. 

Halibut sashimi in tofu oil and yuzu began the meal, with an oyster shooter next. A large portion of shrimp and vegetable tempura followed, all lightly coated and exceptionally crispy.

Fish is where they excel. Tuna from Spain, yellowtail, and ocean trout were all sizable cuts of  quality fish. Another large dish followed with the salmon kama deep fried and sitting in a rich and aromatic agedashi broth. The sushi course was also excellent, particularly the tuna and red snapper. All came glazed with house made sauces.

Ending the meal was a rich and dense green tea cheesecake -- creamy like a traditional American style cheesecake instead of a lighter and fluffier Japanese cheesecake.

I tend to stay away from AYCE, well because if you're a true sushi eater, you know AYCE really can't cater to high standards because they can't use top notch fish, and well they have to make money too. So, that's why I went to Sushi Hiro. I went multiple times before writing my review, so at least, I can make a fair judgement call. First, the sushi is great, no doubt about it. And their omokase option is also great. I couldn't give it 5 stars because well, personally, their sushi rice wasn't too flavorful. It tasted a bit more on the bland side.

The chirashi is a fantastic mix of fresh fish on a large box of rice. My husband refers to it as the ""box of fish."" Also try the homemade tofu if it's available. It's a firm type of tofu but the mix of toppings is delightful.

My favorite though, is the chef's tasting menu. Go big! This is an amazing experience. It's 8 courses of delicious raw and cooked foods.

Food...most important part of a review.....best fresh sushi everrrrrrrrr! The quality is just over the top, and the amount they give is so much for such a reasonable price. This place has sushi as well as kitchen prepared foods if you don't like raw food. The menu is limited but I honestly prefer that so they really perfect their selection. If you're one of those who likes rolls, and sauces and deep fried this and that...this is not the place for you. This is real sushi which is just really good rice and fresh fish.

As you walk in, you'll notice the gigantic lantern decor in the ceiling.  The place is bright, clean, and new.  Very welcoming feel.  

I sat at the sushi bar, where Hiro, the Owner of the place, was the sushi chef.  It's always nice to see the Owner working behind the counter.  You can really tell he is really proud of the place, and I agree he should be.  Hiro seems like a hard working, humble, and very personable guy.    

Pretty much all specialty sushi rolls have photos, which is a great idea!  Saves me time on imagining what sushi looks like as I'm reading through the description, when I can just look at the photo and say yep....that's what I want!!  

I decided to try their sushi (nigiri) lunch special.  Comes with miso soup and salad.  

Sushi came with 8 assorted fish of the Chef's choosing, but I requested one of the pieces to be the super white tuna.  Sushi came with pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, red snapper, halibut, shrimb, albacore, and the super white tuna.  Each piece came included some wasabi in between the rice and the fish, which gave some kick to it.  I think more sushi places should include a piece of wasabi in their nigiri sushis.  

If you check in on Yelp, you get free dessert.  I'm glad I tried the green tea tempura ice cream.  They pour bacardi on it in front of you and light it on fire.  Quite the presentation, and the flavor was amaze balls.

Toro tuna belly was neutral in flavor, it was like eating plastic. No flavor at all.
Tako Octopus was super chewy and difficult to eat without almost choking and no flavor.
Maybe the items coming in on the airplane from overseas are being stressed from the flight?
The fish on the rolls are tiny tiny tiny, almost a non event to eat the rolls, since they are tiny and flavorless.
There wasn't even one item that had that special something that makes it memorable.
Spider roll had some kind of veggies in it that took away from the soft shell crab and even that ingredient was mushy and flavorless.

The prices are as expected for a good Japanese restaurant; slightly higher but not exorbitant, and great value considering the extremely high quality of the food.

Service is phenomenal and courteous. The interior is clean and sleek. They take reservations but I can usually get a table without a reservation as well.

The lunch special came with miso soup, salad, and chirashi bowl. The fish was very fresh and in generous potion, and the sushi rice was very flavorful. I highly recommend it to all who like poke bowls - in comparison to most places specializing in poke bowls, here you are getting high-quality fish of different varieties, proper sushi rice, restaurant-quality soup & salad, and unlimited supply of green tea (that doesn't come from a tea bag). In addition, the lunch potion was so generous that, half way through it, I started to regret the side-dish order.

I see this place as somewhere I see myself splurging a ton ordering a la carte just because the quality is so high, which is great b/c there's nowhere I feel compelled to do that on this side of town. Really the only other places in Vegas I do that right now are the two edomae spots in Chinatown, which are only open for dinner and usually need reservations.

Hiro Service:  I've been here multiple times since the first visit and the service is comparable to a $$$$ restaurant.  Once seated, you are presented with a warm hot towel to freshen up.   Everyone is friendly and although a small restaurant, it's not uncommon for multiple servers to check on you throughout your dining experience. Fantastic

Hiro Sushi & more:  This is not an AYCE sushi joint but they offer numerous in house rolls (currently 40 on the menu)  All the nigiri, sashimi and rolls I've had have been very tasty and fresh. My current favorite roll there is the ""out of control"" (#9)  Loaded with eel, crabmeat, cream cheese & avocado inside along with suna, salmon, & yellowtail outside.  It's like an inverted philly roll with all kiiinds of #gainz.  The Bento boxes are packed with so much food that it's hard for me to finish.  The Udon is at a level better than some stand alone Udon restaurants in the Vegas Valley.  I'm just as impressed with their non-sushi dishes, excellent.

Hiro Ambiance:  Modern Sushi house decor with dark wood being used throughout the restaurants for tables, chairs, and booths.  The Sushi bar is shaped like an L and seats about 15 people?  You can dress casually or dressy and both would be fine at Sushi Hiro.

Sushi Hiro is one of the newer spots in this middle-of-the-road sushi segment. They do have omakase options, but their dinner menu has more easily afforded options. Sandwiched between a taqueria and a fast casual burger chain location in a popular and convenient plaza on Eastern near Richmar, this place has been on my radar for a while now, but I only managed to visit it when some friends came up with it as a backup plan after we learned that our first choice for Friday night dinner was shockingly busy.

I entered to find my group already seated at a booth rather than the bar, and they seemed to be going toward the less pricey end of the spectrum, so there was no way I was going for omakase regardless. I ended up choosing the Sushi Dinner ($29.95), which consists of the typical sides of salad and miso soup, a small tuna roll, and the chef's choice of ten pieces of nigiri.

For what it's worth, the salad had an atypical, not so sweet dressing and was fresh, and the miso soup was balanced. I'll also say now that the tuna was pretty tasty in its simple presentation, which is at the center of one of those thin tubes fully wrapped in nori. No fancy sauces or fish on top here, just a few simple and well-executed ingredients. These pieces ended up being a nice palate cleanser following certain subsequent bites.

Most deserving attention was the nigiri course. Ten different fish (well, nine actual fish and one shrimp) were represented here, and some had garnishes while others were presented unadorned, with a small wasabi layer gluing these pieces to the rice underneath. Also, after I looked back at the menu to compare pricing for individual orders of nigiri, I determined that the monetary value easily swings toward choosing this sushi dinner, and to have the benefit of variety on top was music to my taste buds. You're welcome for the mixed metaphor.

Lest I ramble on too much about the fish, they all had excellent flavor variations and will taste familiar if you've eaten them elsewhere. The ones on my plate were maguro (tuna), hamachi (yellowtail), sake (salmon), aji (horse mackerel), ebi (shrimp), super white tuna, ma dai (a Japanese snapper, also called sea bream), red snapper, albacore, and saba (mackerel). The mackerel types clearly had more fishiness, certain fish were mushy but in an obviously deliberate way (salmon, sea bream), and the ebi never tastes special to me, but everything was distinct and enjoyable in its own way. Oh, and the size of each piece is what I'd call a moderate mouthful. Don't you dare bite it in half though...

I also tasted a couple of other items on our table. There was a roll with tuna inside, eel on top, and eel sauce all over (named eel lover's roll, perhaps, and going for around $13) which was quite enjoyable as far as rolls go. The Curry Rice ($11.95) was a massive portion of this common Japanese dish, and the depth of flavors plus the delicious Tonkatsu (breaded pork) will almost certainly be my order on a future visit. As a Henderson resident, this steal of a deal might preclude most if not all future trips to Spring Mountain or the Southwest for similar dishes. Lastly, two tablemates had bento boxes, and while I didn't sample anything of these dishes, the portion size looks more than appropriate for dinner.

Sushi Hiro is a very respectable sushi joint with a few other Japanese dishes up their sleeve, and I'm already feeling the urge to return for a small taste of more of their pricier fish as well as such simpler options as described above. They're worth a visit for sushi enthusiasts of all levels as well as the fish-averse.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,12,9,4,V55ufhwtfBnBgRSCxkdtlQ

We ended up going with omakase for two. The service and quality were outstanding and the price was fair. I ended up dining for several hours since there was so much food and had great conversation with the owners wife. Chef Hiro is not new to this industry - he's been in the business for over twenty five years and had a restaurant on the east coast and in little Tokyo in Los Angeles that's still operating.

Three words that came to mind after every dish eaten here. The ambience in Sushi Hiro is lowly lit and quiet. The focus and spotlight is on the sushi chefs and it is enjoyable to observe them. 

Upon entering and exiting, the entire staff greets every guest with a shouted welcoming in Japanese and/or English. From the second you walk in, it feels like home here and there is a relaxed environment. There isn't anything I don't recommend here but the dishes that stood out were the toro and crispy rice special, spicy scallop, and the takoyaki. The toro belly melts in your mouth and it is complemented by the crispy rice patty it sits upon. The spicy scallop is remarkably fresh and the takoyaki is decadent. The chefs here REALLY know how to cut and select fish. The service is impeccable and fast! They make you feel like they are serving you in their home.

4271358,2017-05-08,0,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"IRASSHAIMASE without an accent?! Okay, already feeling a 5/5 star restaurant here.... 
Let's get straight to the point, Sushi Hiro has Japanese sushi chefs behind the counter and even Japanese waitresses. The sushi chefs are a pair of brothers that own a sushi shop in the main plaza of Little Tokyo in LA. After talking to them, they promised me that they serve the freshest quality of fish in LV :) 
They don't have AYCE and their a la carte nigiri prices are pretty pricey, so I suggest ordering off their lunch specials menu. They have a dinner specials menu, but it is the same as the lunch menu, but more expensive (by about $3-5). 
We ordered the obento boxes (chicken katsu, salmon). The chicken katsu was pretty bad, extremely rubbery and I wouldn't order it again (3/5 stars based on just that). The salmon was a lot better. The portion size is huge, you get a choice between tempura and california roll, with gyoza, egg roll, salad, miso soup. If you're new to Japanese food, I suggest starting here. However, it was more for the portion than the taste. 
Where they really shine is their chirashi and sushi plate. The sushi plate was very filling and the quality of fish was pretty good. Ask what they're including on the sushi plate before you order! Even better, sit at the sushi counter and make friends with the chefs, get the real Japanese experience! The chirashi is HUGE. SO filling and SO much fish. I'm amazed by the portion size and the quality every time I go (Yeah, I've been here a lot)

4352940,2018-04-12,0,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"I had been hearing about how great sushi Hiro was since it opened, but just finally made it in.   Walking inside you pass through the split red curtain into an almost nautical design.  They have bar seating, table seating in the middle,  and more secluded booth seating to the side.   They also have like 4 menus, but if you have an idea of what you want you can navigate fairly quickly.   They also hand you a warm towel to clean your hands before the meal. 

What many people continued to reference was how fresh the fish was here, and honestly they did not disappoint.   I really enjoyed watching the sushi chefs, and the  care they put into handling their product.   The rolls themselves are very generous portions, and we'll worth their price.  No all you can eat here, this place is about the quality not how much you can shove in your face.   I actually converted one of my friends who always insists on all you can eat,  through a meal here.    One item she cannot stop talking about is the higher level cut of the tuna nigiri she got.  They had been out of their cheaper option, so she went for the 10 dollar one.  It was the size of like 5 all you can eat portions,  thick almost like a steak,  and buttery.  

Now some rolls that stood out to me through both visits were the best friends roll,  and the rock n roll.  Their sashimi at lunch is such a great deal for how amazing the cuts are.   They put a chilli sauce on one of my white fish cuts though that was not my favorite.  Also the miso soup they have is fairly basic,  and the dressing on the salad although very fresh tasting is a little heavy in onion.   Also even though overall the service is stellar,  I would have liked them to tell me what fish selection the chef gave me.  I had an idea,  but it's nice to know for the future when I order. 

 I also love that they have some more obscure options on the menu for the foodies like egg custard,  it had the perfect jiggle to it,  with the broth from the meats inside breaking through with each spoonful.  It was savory yet light,  and oh so comforting. 

One little tid bit that really made me happy, is in addition to grated wasabi, you can order chopped wasabi. They also let you order their other sauces on the side as well.  

For dessert I have a deep weakness for fried ice cream,  especially green tea flavor.  So when I saw they had this, I had to have it.   They even light it on fire to add to the crunch right in front of you.   The green tea itself is lighter in flavor not a heavier matcha, but it was still lovely with all the components.  They top it with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. 

I had to give this place 5 stars because a week later I was already back,  and I look forward to many more visits exploring their menus.",XYZw8rWQ0wjMWQChRCU8Hg,3,2,5,QKC4qpCAspmoq4zO93l-LA

This place reminds me of a lot of sushi places of the late 90s, early 2000s. You know, those small mom & pop shops, but with a tasteful updated decor and aesthetic style. It just feels welcoming.

As soon as you're seated, you're greeted with a warm moist towel. A rare sight to see these days at any restaurant. They're refreshing, clean, comforting, and very Japanese. I could already tell that this was going to be a good dining experience at that point.

I came here for good sushi, and that is all I ordered. The salmon and yellowtail nigiri were great. Smooth, buttery, and tasted so fresh. However, the chutoro nigiri was just so, so good. It was worth the $14 for those pieces. The rest of my orders were a salmon roll, negihama roll, and negitoro roll. All again very good, but the negitoro roll tasted amazing. Almost divine. It's just something about that combination of the fish and scallions that add an extra dimension of flavor that is almost mindblowing. I'm a guy who enjoys minimal ingredients at the tastiest levels, so this was a near perfect meal.

The booth is pretty and its like your own private area kinda(they cover the booth with curtains). When you sit, they give you a warm hot towl for your hands and they give you the menu. They have a lot to chose from but i'll always get the rolls. The sushi plate my sister ordered was good! You can taste the freshness of the seafood. The only thing about the sushi, they put wasabi on the seafood and the rice so that it wont fall apart so heads up to those who don't like//want wasabi on their sushi. Theyre Japan Series Roll is amazing!! In the chicken teriyaki beno box they give alot because it also comes with house salad and miso so you'll get pretty full. Tip: ALWAYS order a side of eel sauce whem you order any of the rolls that have eel in it. Itll taste so much better. What I do like about this place is that all theyre seafood is fresh so you can actually taste it. The only thing, when my sister got the Fatty Tuna sushi from the fresh seafood sushi menu it has that oil after taste and when you bite into the middle, theres something in there thats spicy and its not wasabi thats the only thing. Overall, I love this place. It's pretty far from the strip, its more in the subburbs area so expect a pretty far drive like around 10-15min drive i think.",qK42OEwrbiexsTi7Jyho8A,1,0,5,W8J7E8z57CzBKNrJDy8lTQ

4934415,2016-08-06,16,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"I enjoyed Sushi Hiro very much. There is such a plethora of Sushi places in town and that is such a great thing for us Las Vegans.  There are very traditional places, the popular Roll type of sushi houses and in this case with Sushi Hiro, a blend of your Roll type sushi house meets tradition.

1. The authenticity - I really love it when you can walk into a Sushi Restaurant and the Japanese that is spoken is more than just Irrashaimasu.  To hear the sushi chefs speaking the lingo and calling out orders for pick up in that traditional way just adds to the ambiance.

2.  The ambiance - I like the simple originality of the place. Big Sushi bar, a few tables in the middle, and then booths with a bit of privacy along the side.  Clean, efficient lighting and those large wrapped Sake Barrels used as part of the decor.  Lighting is just right, the lights themselves are so simple and nice.  Just a great place to enter.  Not much room for waiting though.

3. Service - The team tonight was tapped out as it was freaking busy at 8:00 pm on a Friday night.  The wifey and I entered when there was a small lull, but about 8:45 pm the second or third wave hit and it was swamped. But alas, the team is so friendly, nice and welcoming.

4.  The Food - That is what we are here to talk about so let's rock this place out.

a. The rolls - As you may be aware by now, I am not a huge roll fan, however, I find them definitely edible and tasty. I mean, as a comparison,  I find grilled cheese and PBJ sandwiches tasty and edible, just don't order it much.  Back to Sushi, the rolls here are very good. Rather than the huge massive rolls that are packed and heavy, these rolls are rather delicate. each piece is cut thin and each piece is about 75% the size of those normal rolls you get elsewhere. I do like this in many ways because the taste is simpler, more defined and it seems the nature of the fish and rice stands out more.  When I go to an AYCE Sushi place, I can eat the rolls, but i find that all the flavors and the tastes are masked due to all the sauces and ingredients mixed in.  Here the essence of the sushi is more refined.  If you are a big roll eater and like that huge mix of ingredients, you will find perhaps some disappointment, so be aware that this is entirely a different style of sushi rolls.

b. The Goodies - 

Ankimo - ordered up an order of Ankimo, monkfish liver.  You don't get to find this everywhere. It was great and with a bit of scallion, daikon and ponzu sauce to round it out. I am not sure why I like monkfish.  Don't google a picture of one.  I don't know who goes around the world saying ""look at that fish""  isn't that one tasty fellow!  When I got my first look at a monkfish, I think it was a bit frightening.

Mirugai - You cannot imagine how many sushi places I go to and attempt to get this Geoduck clam or any other type of clam and it is not easy to get. I get a no more than a yes. Here they had it as a special and i ordered it sashimi style. Again, simple, great texture, fresh.  One of my favorites and they had it.  Loved that they served it very simply in a plate with some Wakame.  A nice pairing.  By the way, if you ever googled a picture of this clam, you would probably never order it, so don't google it...and keep your kids away from it.

O-Toro- When ever I am ordering sashimi and tuna specifically, I generally am getting the Maguro. Love Maguro and you get a lot of it in an order as well.  Here they had as a special O-toro. That fatty belly part of the tuna is so tasty and melts in your mouth. I often don't get it at many places, but ask and here it was one of the specials. I enjoyed it and that made it a bit special tonight.

Escolar Super White Tuna - Whenever I go to a place and they have superwhite, I have no idea if it is albacore tuna or escolar fish.  Here they tell you straight up it is escolar.  That fatty special controversial fish that many consider a delicacy.  I guess some people's stomach does not go well with the fatty content that makes this fish so nice.  I had it as a sashimi as well at enjoyed it.  I won't order this all the time, but I do like to order it when I am feeling a wee bit adventurous.

Scooby Doo Roll and the Fashion Roll - Hey, come on, you knew I was going to get a roll anyway!  I had a few bites of these rolls and like I said above, nice, simple, delicate.

Dessert - If you check in on yelp, right now they are offering a free dessert. Mochi ice cream and it tastes great. Always like that.

I will be coming back here for sure to try more of what they offer.  I stuck mainly to the specials and sashimi tonight to get the best possible taste of their fish offerings.  For the second time here, I enjoyed it and will be coming back for sure!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,36,27,5,Du0fH8GiZG8vemV3I2A-hg

I don't really know how that happens. Aren't you supposed to ask the name on the order and then confirm what they ordered before just handing the food over? So I had to wait for them to remake everything that I had ordered 30 minutes before. The sushi was good and fresh, but nothing outstanding or memorable. I had high hopes for this places because of all of the reviews. But maybe they're better to dine in instead of take out. I also recommend when people order take out sushi that they should label the boxes with the names of the rolls instead of it being a guessing game.",UgYG3TgJocOM-HZ2-VE6zg,2,0,3,D7n_BbkP6F2EO0mZN_4Edg

I had the sashimi lunch and the fish selection was delicious and fresh. I love uni and had to order two orders of them. It was so fresh and sweet. From the specials menu we ordered the o-toro (bluefin fatty tuna belly) and the mirugai (geoduck). The bluefin was melt in your mouth delicious. The geoduck had a nice crunchy, chewy taste. It was something different. The only critique I could make was that the fish was cut so large. It was a two biter. I rather have it cut into smaller pieces so it's not overwhelming. This place is not cheap so of course they want to give you your money's worth, but cut it smaller and have more pieces than? I love this place and will be back.

Our focus is the sashimi dinner, the dinner chirashi, and whatever daily fish they have in stock.

4996121,2018-02-05,2,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"Wow, HUGE disappointment!
 Placed an on-line take-out order yesterday evening  via Eat24 app, to be picked-up about 40 min later at 9PM.

I ordered Curry Rice with Tofu ($11.95) & Teriyaki Don, also with Tofo ($11.95).  Picked-up my order at 9:02PM, and the first thing I noticed was that the take-out bag didn't seem to be as hot as it should be -- I suspect they made my order closer to 8:20PM when I placed it, versus waiting a while, knowing that I specified a 9PM pick-up time.   During my brief encounter (my order was pre-paid) with them during pickup, the staff was friendly.

Second issue: Most Asian food places give you steamed rice in a separate ""to go"" container, so if for example, you order a curry dish, you get the curry item in a pint or quart container, and then you get steamed rice in a separate container, making for a total of two pints of food.   Sushi Hiro doesn't, and that means you're paying a pretty high price for about half the quantity of food you get at most other Asian take-out places.     I learned the hard-way this was the case with both items I ordered.

Third issue: The Curry Rice with Tofu was extremely bland.  I'm well-aware that tofu itself has no flavor, but I'm also well-aware that any decent curry *does* have both 'heat' & flavor. The curry from Sushi Hiro simply didn't.  Their menu did not give any options for curry spiciness.  

Fourth issue:  I saved the Teriyaki Don with Tofu item to eat today, and just did.  Same issue covered in #2, *and* because the steamed rice was mixed-in with the Teriyaki Don, in the 20 hours between when it was cooked & when I ate it, the teriyaki sauce had been completely absorbed by the rice, thus the tofu and other ingredients didn't really have any of the Teriyaki flavor.    On top of that, the teriyaki flavor was minimal, so this dish also tasted very bland, just like my other entree from them!

  I've got zero reason to ever go back there (other than to ask for a refund), and even writing this negative --but completely honest-- review of the place is taking up more of my time than they deserve.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,1,0,1,gUy3Gmolxr0YB75nBRNkXw

Unsure as to why three of the standout off the strip sushi restaurants are all spearheaded by such talented chefs with the same name (Sushi Hiroyoshi, Tokyo Boys are the other two), but I plan on legally changing my name to Hiro for a couple of weeks to see if that raises my own culinary game.

Prior to arrival, we called to discover that their corkage fee was a ridiculously low $7 (?!?!?!?) and snagged a couple of bottles at Trader Joe's up the street, which enhanced dinner smaaaashingly.  This is also the most price accessible Japanese spot offering omakase, starting at $49, but we opted for the $89 premium option and were seated in front of Chef Hiro himself in order to compare it fairly with the others...and because I am a fucking pig.  
  
While Raku's version of tofu is the gold standard for Las Vegas, the one that the Chef Hiro doles out is excellent and would save any Henderson resident some car fuel if they were jonesing for a soy fix.  The tempura dish, the other option for this specific course, was also first-rate.

The ocean trout sashimi was definitely a highlight, cut thick and delicious; these mini filets had me absolutely fish-giddy.  Served on a bed of crushed ice with several other cuts of sashimi and a mini-box of uni (kawaiiiiiii), it was easy to see that the chef and his staff take great pride in details.

All the nigiri served was terrific with the most unique being the special chu-toro from Massachusetts of all places.  This provided a unique flavor and chew; almost like a cross between ika and maguro...even in color!  Overall, this was another noteworthy dining experience that I would gladly return to.

When we first walked in, all the staff gave a hearty ""Irasshaimase!"" - ""Welcome!"" - which was a good sign. After we were seated, we were given hot towels (o-shibori) for washing our hands, another tradition you see in Japan but not so much in Japanese restaurants here. Two for two for hitting the ""authentic"" Japanese restaurant experience!

While we knew what we wanted, we looked over the menu and ended up ordering a baked asparagus appetizer as well. It was tasty and a nice starter to the bowls of curry heading our way. And man, were we happy when the curry hit the table. I had the torikatsu (fried chicken cutlet) with it, and at first I though the chicken alone was a little bland and needed more salt, but then I had it with the curry sauce, it was perfect. And man, that curry sauce. Unbelievable, with the flavors of the vegetables coming through beautifully, but all in perfect balance. Curry carving: blown away. 

As far as the restaurant, it's a nice modern looking place, with a few well-chosen Japanese decorations. Clean and uncluttered. Relaxing, but not fancy. 

There were only a few things that kept this from feeling like you were sitting in a restaurant in Japan: No doorbell buttons on the table - but it is an American restaurant, after all, and the wait staff were all very attentive so no need for the bells; and the contemporary pop on the radio. And the whole ""everyone speaking English"" bit ;)

Overall, REALLY excited to have a great curry place close by, I can't wait to come back and try some of the sushi!",IwzUGunOvSCtm0xfZwFR6g,1,0,5,UOoY5Bl7iB6VjpN5zw6X4g

5676884,2016-07-10,0,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"Authenticity: I like that this is a Japanese owned business, however the reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of areas of inauthenticity, such as in the bento box, the gyoza was fried and it also had egg rolls (weird). Also, I felt the slices of sashimi were too thick. I'm happy that this is NOT AYCE as I find that a disgusting concept. 

Food: chirashi, sashimi lunch and chicken katsu bento. quality was there, but too thick slices felt cumbersome in terms of mouth feel. I like that the chirashi came with pickles. It would be nice if they served complimentary orange slices at the end to get rid of the fish taste in my mouth. 

Service: very friendly and welcoming. 

I think I would be back to try bento box lunch again. In terms of Tokyo-style sushi, in Henderson, I still prefer Tokyo Boys.",V6Cjj3SVmMqCrr6uJqvlPw,3,2,4,tZIJ-qqZifwJUsNw4helJw

Surprised my husband suggested we try this new restaurant since he is very leery about eating sushi anywhere other than by the beach. We were greeted with a Japanese welcome by the entire staff when we walked in the door. We decided to sit at the bar for the ""sushi bar"" experience. We would have been happy at any other seat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was bright, clean and modern. Every dish we ordered was delicious: several sushi varieties, sticky rice, fried calamari, soup, gyoza, and lots of saki. Their sushi presentation is A+++. I would definitely recommend Sushi Hiro to anyone. Another indication of a good restaurant is the restroom - which was clean and modern.

5707915,2018-03-13,0,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"This has to be one of the best sushi restaurants I've found around the Silverado Ranch area. I'll start with two negatives so you can read them and forget them - there is no all you can eat, and the prices are a bit prohibitive from eating there every night (it's a travesty - trust me).

NOW ON TO THE GOOD STUFF! The restaurant is cozy but laid out well - there are booths which actually offer slight privacy with tasteful curtains and then you have general table seating as well as front-row seats at the bar. The staff is very engaging and accommodating - many members of the team take the time to check in regarding drinks or clearing the table for you so you never have to worry about being unnoticed. 

The sushi chefs are especially talented at making some AMAZING rolls and adding their flare with some outstanding specialty rolls. While I can't consume shellfish, I still enjoy most everything on the menu because they are more than happy to accommodate a substitution and ensure zero cross contamination (seeing as I haven't visited the hospital yet - don't worry, yelp review once I do). 

One of my favorites is the out of control roll - just like everything else on the menu, it's a well sized portion which leaves you full yet ready for another.

Located in the same shopping mall as Twin Peaks, BJ's, etc off Eastern. The restaurant is very clean, welcoming and friendly staff, and excellent food. Reminds me of Yummy Grill and Sushi off Lake Mead, but nicer.

I ordered a bottle of sake, and it came with an ice bucket to keep it cold. That's pretty cool. The menu has a wide variety of dishes, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, etc. Ordered a rainbow roll, beef negi wegi, and one of the specials for the day, albacore tataki. All were presented nicely, tasted fresh and delicious. Very happy with the quality of the food here.

What really made it great was the service. We were frequently checked up on, empty plates taken away quickly, sake glass filled, my friends coke filled, and waters topped off at least 3-4 times. 

Its not a huge place, I think I counted 4 booths, and about 6 tables as well as the sushi counter. It was pretty full except for the counter when we dined here on a Wednesday evening 6pm. Well worth a visit, come check it out!!",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,6,6,5,BFl4xr7_BGM5cFJVcY3DwQ

5913562,2016-07-15,9,VeiL_tgw7dsl-7IcnOsh0g,"Sushi Hero has many 5 star reviews so expectations were high, unfortunately we were totally underwhelmed. Everyones tastes are different but Yelp is about honest reviews and that is what I will write. We arrived around 5:30 and were quickly greeted and seated in a booth. 

I started off with an ice cold Kirin draft while looking at the menu. There are no complimentary appetizers or salads like many other sushi or japanese restaurants (edamame, green salad with ginger dressing, cucumber salad, etc). We put an order in for a few different rolls and nigiri sushi. 

All of the order with the exception of the crazy tuna roll was served in the boat which was a really cool presentation. We first tried the yellowtail sushi was fine, pretty thin cut but average. We then went to the eel roll and both looked at each other as we ate it. The eel was very fishy tasting which fish should never be. The rice was cold and hard (like if you have ever had sushi from a supermarket). We did not finish the roll. 

We then tried the philly roll, spicy tuna and crazy tuna rolls and again did not care for them at all. The spicy tuna was very ""dry"" and again all of the rice was hard instead of warm and soft.

In all fairness this is more of a traditional sushi restaurant so maybe it just wasn't our taste. Maybe it was an off night? Im not sure but its definitely not like us to not finish our sushi. 

Our waitress noticed we didn't finish our food and asked why we didn't like it. We explained the eel was very fishy and she told us they switched to a new supplier and that might have been the issue. She was kind enough to take the eel roll off the bill. Everyone was very friendly and service was good but I cannot give more than 2 stars due to the sushi.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,8,2,2,BbF3cjlFNu0vLg3A5g9Tew

They do try to accommodate American/Las Vegan tastes with a large special roll menu, but do yourself a favor and order some fresh chu toro nigiri, kumamoto oysters, giant clam sashimi, etc. Their homemade tofu is a treat as well.
