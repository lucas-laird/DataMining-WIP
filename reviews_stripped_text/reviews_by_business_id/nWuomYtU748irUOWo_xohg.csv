I want to thank MISS SUZANNE and STAFF I watch the cashier the whole time waiting on my food they didn't make not one mistake.

Customer service was poor, food mediocre and overall experience was horrible. What topped off my whole experience was the fact that the drive thru guy (Chelino, he was also the same guy as my first experience) did not want to give me more then 2 ranch for my large order of jalape√±o  cheese bombers, 2 chicken tenders and 5 chicken sandwiches! So dumb to want that extra 30 cents a ranch packet then to send me on my way a sort of happy customer. I will not be returning to this location and I would advise all of you reading this to spend your money somewhere it will be more appreciated.",vovpj42xq53n9pPWjPkH3g,0,0,1,Qjd4d7V8b1g4TDqOgxc_Tg

I couldn't believe the wait that was ahead of us for chicken, but I soon realized why everyone was ordering large amounts, (probably supplying a big party somewhere).  I just don't know how well their drive-thru works if there is such a wait. 

The chicken is literately being flowered in their yummy recipe and fried to perfection, so these are not pre-packaged frozen chicken pieces. Yay! 

Now onto the biscuits...they are some of the best biscuits I have tried outside of home.  They had just come out of the oven and then a big squirt of honey butter goes right on top.  The biscuits are nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   

I will say, that the experience can vary depending on when the chicken and biscuits come out and that they haven't been sitting out too long.  Fresh out of the oven fryer are always best. So that's my tip!  

I am glad they cater to large parties, however I would also like if they equally consider those of us just ordering a 2 piece meal.

Overall, this has to be one of the yummiest chain produced fried chicken joint I've experienced.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,5,3,5,dmxlNxWnUCI-uh6BH348KA

What we didn't appreciate was the gentleman taking the orders pep talking his staff loud enough for everyone to hear.  His pep talk wasn't designed to hype the employees to work hard and fast so they can make it home to their families.  It was to give the customers within earshot a guilt trip for ordering Churches on New Years Eve.  

Well I'm sorry you had to work on New Years Eve. I do hope you all were able to make it home in time for the countdown.  At least you are able to do so while I on the other hand had to call it a night after having Churches for dinner at 930 PM because I had to work early AM on New Year's Day.  Not only did you make me feel guilty but did you have to give me and my whole family diarrhea?  

I know it wasn't deliberate and I'm sure the folks before me and after me probably got it too.  Were you all in such a hurry to leave that night and not care about making sure our food was not contaminated?  Did you change the oil?  Did you wash your hands before using them to dump the chicken in the fryer?  Did someone put something back in the refrigerator too late?  Or was it just a bad batch of chicken?",PFx8DMu2_iiORDXjlKcJTA,0,1,1,FUy-j0_hCEvVq-z65AwxaA

I had a coupon from online that I printed out and took in 2 separate times. I guess it isn't a coupon they get regularly because they messed up my order BOTH times. One time they forgot to give me the biscuits that came with my meal and the second time they shorted me an order of mashed potatoes. I learned my lesson and checked my order before I left the second time. When I told them they charged me for potatoes that I didn't get they gave me money back...I told them I don't want my money back I want my order of potatoes. They called a manager over...who couldn't speak English and insisted that I take my money back. I calmly explained that I don't want my money. I want my correct order. The thing that really made me angry is that they were not listening to what I wanted. I was very calm, patient, and clear because I also work in customer service but they kept trying to just get me out of their drive through without listening to my problem. Horrible customer service.",bUHDMqn8mpepC8k7GRI0Jg,1,0,2,_y6dJtARM27xxdmbmBCDvA

It took a little longer than what I'm use to (comparing it to another location) but it was awesome, it was hot, like it just came out of the fryer, the corn on the cobb was hot until the last bite.  
This Churches, is small, and the tables are really close to each other, but other than that, no need in sweeting the small stuff, if everything else is awesome.",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,0,0,5,g_CUmIL8-o2qtVDnRX_03w

The macaroni was so creamy and buttery. Those biscuits though! Man! These are like pillows from the gods! Sweet, buttery, crunchy, soft, fluffy, warm mounds of perfection.

It's your typical drive-through with far too many options on the menu. There was some bucket deal running, but my husband wanted strips, so we didn't opt for it. The chicken is fried, crispy and very moist. The flavors are delightful and it wasn't very greasy. I got a side of fried okra with mine and the serving was enormous. The okra was perfectly fried, not dried out - and made my mouth happy. :) 

My husband wasn't a huge fan - but he's super picky :)",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,1,4,TEQYVH8PTzMbJOP4fAKVZA
4318696,2016-03-09,1,nWuomYtU748irUOWo_xohg,"The chicken was great. I don't even mind waiting because its worth it. What got me was the employees personal conversations. I and the other customers (about 6 of us) don't care who you're dating and why he keeps calling other women. I was so put off by this and this is the main reason that I'm writing a review. On a positive note, I could see the work ethic through the sideshow. 

This location needs to be expanded or remodeled. The inside looks dated and Its hard as hell to exit the property because of the plethora of traffic traveling south on Rancho. If you're leaving this restaurant you got one direction, South. In my case I had to drive past the freeway and hit a U-turn which took an extra 8 minutes with the light pattern. I made a right on Bonanza which is the same damned intersection which I had left 8 minutes ago!! I drove past Popeyes on the catty corner or in other words diagonal of Church's and that place was a ghost town. 

Church's needs to expand. We'd be happy to have you in North Las Vegas!",MwpK7PqQX7fgTFM2Pfy61w,0,0,3,NED_Be9Pky0xDn6vQr2VBg
