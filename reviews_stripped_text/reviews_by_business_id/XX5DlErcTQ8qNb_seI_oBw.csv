Staff was friendly and they worked quick.

After 15 minutes, I asked to speak to the manager - only to be rudely greeted by some guy that couldn't even be troubled to put down his cell phone - apparently he was in the middle of some text saga with his friend ""Pacho"" - I only know because he couldn't even be troubled to put down his phone while I was asking how much longer it was going to be.

As I rule I'm not really fond of pizza with sauce that oozes all over the place so I tend to just order my pizza fresh and waiting versus, just taking what's available and pre made.     So a friend of mine and I went last night (2/26/17) to pick up a couple pizzas.  I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom and olive w/light sauce and a deep dish pepperoni w/light sauce.    Well the young lady at the register was extremely rude and informed me I would have to wait about 10-15 mins. and I said that was fine..... then she sighed and gave me a total.   My friend said it was like I somehow bothered her.   she ran my card and walked away from the register no words or pleasantries were exchanged.   So Whatever.  A few minutes later this young lady stopped working the register and went in back to prepare crazy bread/bread sticks.   Well we could see her clearly while waiting for our pizzas.    She had on no gloves and had not washed her hands and was now handling food.   I was so grossed out.   Then I kind of glanced back further where the other teens were handling dough, cutting and boxing pizzas.   Not one of them had on any type of plastic gloves.    Now I used to work for a restaurant in the Nevada area and I happen to know that NV health department is very strict.   So why all of these teens were preparing and touching food and not one of them had washed their hands or none of them had on any gloves while touching food, and they are still allowed to remain open and operating business???    This is disgusting and needless to say I could not eat my pizza after seeing all this and I surely will not go to this location again.    Shut this place down and teach these employees about cleanliness 101 and customer service ......    the depressed rude attitude does not belong in a customer service environment.",Dl9EjZ1U7G0loCCcIzetkw,2,0,1,tpWn3IYGRUKsEUtFv9--YA

You've seen the commercials. You've heard the pitch. $5 hot and ready pizza. 
And let me tell you, they aren't fucking around. I had barely placed the order when like a magician from down low he produced a fresh 'hot and ready pizza' Even now, I'm genuinely impressed with the quality of the pizza, the cleanliness of the store and the enthusiasm of the staff. If you're hungry, and just want to get it in, here's your place. 
Why the missing star? 
When I look down on a pizza, I don't want to see bread bubbles or red sauce. I want to see a roof of cheese and toppings over an evenly laid out crust. 
*there was a generous amount of pepperonis 
Keep in mind, I'm an asshole. But I know what I like. And air and sauce, isn't pizza. 
Ps-keep in mind, I didn't actually have a slice. I just picked off some of the pepperonis and then shared it with a friend. 
pps-if you're going to make a 'deep-dish' pizza, there needs to be something deep about the dish. An inch and half of bread, is not pizza. It's literally bread. I can go to Panera if I want that.

Located on the southeast corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, it is kind of tucked away a bit behind the gas station.

I live about 5-10 minutes away, so for a quick cheap fix you can't beat that hot n ready deal! If you're looking for gourmet, top shelf pizza, than you are an idiot if you are looking for it here.

But...

-It is good for a quick, cheap fix if you don't feel like cooking or going for, you know, real food..

-If you have friends/family that are over that have kids, than this is a GREAT solution to take care of the kiddies on the cheap..

- sometimes it is nice to just grab a redbox movie(or2), curl up on the couch, and grab a couple of these pizzas and enjoy and a nice, quiet night in without breaking the bank! (Hey! Who says you have to spend hundreds a night??)

Plus they stay open until 10pm and everytime I've gone in there the service has been quick and friendly..so I am going to give it...

I called ahead of time and asked for a fresh pepperoni deep dish pizza, what we usually get from Little Caesars. I was told there's already some made, I asked again if he could make a fresh one and said what time we would be there to pick up. The pizza I received was dry, burnt, and as if it was sitting under a heat lamp for hours. Very little sauce, just tasted like a big hunk of bread with a cheese stick on top. Please don't waste your time or money and go to another location.",CMPlVtxPC1E01u7Hn9aNGA,1,0,1,dcy7qoDPWrLz8s_BinqAWg

Picked up a $5.00 Pep and tried two pieces. I threw the rest in the trash.

The pizza was burnt.
The pizza was cold.
The amount of grease on the bottom of the box was so soaked through my counter at home had to be washed off. It sat on the counter for 2 mins and looked like I washed the counter with grease.

I do understand this is the McDonalds of pizza, but when its not even edible, whats the points?

If this place went out of business, the world would be better off..",fmsDLWdRHbaTbs62nYR6Aw,0,0,1,dDdjenhufekw92ewNjXGwQ

I stopped in earlier and ordered 5 pizzas and some crazy bread, all from their ""Hot and Ready"" menu.  I don't mind waiting a little when something isn't ready, it means that it's fresh and they're busy but 18 minutes after I ordered the cashier listed my entire order as available to the 8th or 9th customer behind me in line.  When I asked why my order wasn't ready when it was all in their core (twice), he told me that he didn't know.  I asked for manager who didn't seem to understand that someone could be upset that the pizzas they had been waiting for were walking out the door to people who came in after their order.  When I asked for a refund he muttered something about the owner and vanished into the back.  That's when my favorite part happened, a lady (presumably the owner) came out and asked what the problem was.  When I related, once again, to her that my entire order was sitting in the warming ovens being listed off to newcomers and I didn't understand why I was still waiting.  She tried to say that she'd check on it.  When I asked for a refund instead, my order suddenly appeared (as if by magic).  When I asked why I had been waiting she offered me a 2-liter of soda and a bit later a pizza.  I didn't take either, I would have much rather had an apology that I never got.  What I got instead was called ""miserable"", I can only assume because I had the audacity to complain.

I will say that the pizza here does not live up to the ""ready"" part and customer service appears to be nonexistent.  If I'm going to have to wait nearly 20 minutes anyways I'd rather have food from Pizza Hut or Papa Johns.",FoZb_w4h3b1n-_EDyVH2zg,3,0,1,1s4vSMKET-VuI1-wEbtLpA

I stopped in on a Friday morning for some crazy bread & a $5 pizza & asked for a bunch of napkins. I got 3 flimsy napkins so I asked for more. She gave me 6 more & said she needed to make sure there were enough for the weekend. I said I was feeding a class full of kids and needed more napkins and she said you only bought one pizza I need napkins for the weekend. So I said maybe you should talk to someone about ordering the napkins not to give me her attitude. She gave me a few more and began to yell at me in front of three other customers that I only ordered one pizza and she needed more napkins for the weekend. I started to leave but walked to the side of the counter just so I could see how many napkins they really had. If she had bothered to eat any of the crazy bread she would know that it is extremely greasy and covered in cheese, requiring the use of more than one napkin per person. She then proceeded to scream at me that she wasn't going to let me come back to HER store. I've been to many other little Caesars in the valley and when I order only a crazy bread I am given a nice supply of napkins without the trouble. I will not be going back to this location.",1LRpbTK3-s79B2jEz9aXLw,0,0,1,t1xAH-89kOj9LzOFFEYnWg

that is running the place is yelling for Tony, OK there are too other woman and myself in the store, no one is answering. Did she ever think that may be he was not here. Tony did show up and yes for ten minutes she stood calling for Tony only to tell him she gave his pizza's to someone else. In the meantime I placed an order for two deep dish pepperoni pizzas. They only had one ready and said it would be 5 minutes the place started to get crowded and pizzas were going out the door right and left finally I said hey I am waiting on two pizzas and you're giving one away after already giving one away before that. Then the woman screams from the back well it's only been 5 minutes whatever happened to hot and ready so I told her I want my money back and she just started to mouth off.

I was there yesterday around 3:00pm and ordered the Italian Cheese Bread. Lady at the counter offered the hot and ready ICB in the warmer. I insisted it looked unappetizing and chose to wait  for a fresh one. I stepped over to the side and waited 5 minutes. And then, the lady at the counter approached me and demanded I paid an additional $1.00 more the fresh ICB THAT I ALREADY PAID FOR which made no sense to me. I asked for a manager and found out it was he who delegated to the associate I had no choice but to pay the dollar or take what's in the warmer. I called their corporate number and later found out the Silverado Ranch and Bermuda store is owned by a franchisee. I later visited the store on Durango and Warm Spring which was corporate owned and found out you do not have to pay an additional amount of money to have your pizza freshly prepared. Little Caesars on Silverado Ranch and Bermuda practices scamming their customers and not giving a cufk about it. All this for pizza right?",3wCBZB2UarPi5U50c0hRWQ,2,0,1,OzdbVTSy3fPibP2NtV1dKw
