My bf and I just popped in because of the reviews and the star ratings; ratings didn't lie on how good this place is. Although It is located inside a gas station, do not be dismayed by it's location or you'll pass by some well prepared tacos and tortas

Tacos weren't small at all  Horchata was delicious and my bf's torta was bomb af

From my thorough observations they do a good job in keeping up with their health code regulations (trust me, even the best places don't)

Might be a family ran business because it did seem like a father and daughter were providing my service. The cook came out to double check if everything came out good and IT MOST DEFINITELY DID",EBgquOwKGXSEdOhSweDrDA,3,0,5,irhPvoQadGhrdNmojfh04w

When we arrived I was a little taken a back as it was part of a convenience store, but OMG! so glad we went inside. The food was just amazing, I had the carnitas torta and 2 tripas tacos and I was not disappointed one bit. I think I can safely say this is one of, if not the best taco shops in the city. The torta was perfect with the cheese melted perfectly unto the bread and carnitas were perfection. The tacos were way bigger than expected, flavor was beyond delicious, tripas were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crispness. And last but not least the red salsa was not only spicy it had flavor that paired with the meats.

I could go on, but to sum it up this little gem is about to become part of my weekly routine, I am excited to try more of the menu! Oh and the customer service was spot on",wF6AjZwcGdVcqhkSSNa2jA,2,0,5,0K_mpBOwQ8PVEIPY5V7KMA
