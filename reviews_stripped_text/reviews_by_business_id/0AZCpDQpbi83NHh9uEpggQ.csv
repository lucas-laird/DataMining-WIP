So the other morning we woke up earlier than normal and decided to go to breakfast.  We have a favorite breakfast place ""Sunrise Cafe"", however, for a change... we went to Ihop.  It was very early, so it was not busy.  We were kindly greeted and seated right away.  Minutes after being seated while we were looking over the menu, there was a very bad sewage odor... I looked up from my menu and saw that one of the employees had the women's restroom door open mopping the floor.  WOW... was the odor bad... I think the employee mopping saw the look of disgust on my face, as he quickly finished and shut the door.  The waiter was friendly, however his English lacked in that it was a bit difficult to communicate (us to him and him to us).  I ordered a simple omelet (cheese / bacon) and chose the pancakes in place of toast and my husband ordered the red velvet pancakes and scrambled eggs... we both ordered coffee, which was mediocre at best, and the pot of coffee left on the table barely gave us each a half cup.  The pancakes were delicious, just as I remembered, however the omelet was just okay... it was on the small side and lacked cheese and bacon... PLUS, there was no fruit, or potatoes!  The waiter did not offer us more coffee, although he did bring me a box for my leftovers and he took our dirty plates / silverware... and gave us the check.  I guess that was his way of telling us our breakfast was over!  I got up to use the restroom and gasped when I opened the door!  Mind you, I have very bad allergies and can hardly smell, however the odor of sulfur / sewage that resinated from this restroom was the worst that I have ever experienced, so strong that my lack of smell disappeard... so much that I could not go in.  Seriously, in my opinion, the health department should investigate this because my guess is that an odor as pungent as this one was, is quite toxic.  I had not yet looked at the check, but when I did as we were walking up to the cashier, I was SHOCKED!!! Almost $30.00 for hardly any food!!!  Needless to say, and after years of being loyal iHop customers, we will never go back, as the overall experience / price is definitely not worth it.

Service: Our server, Ben, came to our table immediately. Very warm and friendly. Brought our coffees right away. Got our order correct and brought it in a timely fashion. I like their policy of leaving a pot of coffee on the table so you can refill your own without having to flag down the server for more.

- Fast food quality for restaurant prices
- Unlimited mediocre quality
- Lots and lots and lots of screaming/yelling children

I don't know if the ratio of families with children versus everyone else is simply high or I am just unlucky, but almost always I find myself seated next to the large table of a family who thinks it's cute / appropriate / whatever to let their children scream and run around the table / restaurant.

This isn't IHOP's fault, but they could at least politely ask them to have their children seated while in the restaurant so as not to disturb other patrons.  Or is that just forbidden now?  I don't know.

I used to get the Harvest Grain 'N Nut Pancakes here a lot (delicious), but changed it up.  Their Simple & Fit vegetable omelette is pretty good, but a little salty.

My chicken fried steak was burnt. The gravy on top had been sitting on top of it for so long I could turn it upside down and it stuck on the steak. The hash-browns were hard underneath where they are supposed to be soft. I wanted to share them with my 9 month old but couldn't because they were so hard. So I sent my meal back, didn't ask for it redone and just ate the pancakes. My husbands meal was TINY. The bacon was under cooked and floppy, the hash browns were hard like mine, the eggs (which were scrambled) were watery and instead of toast they gave him French toast. Who wants French toast when they are already getting pancakes?? That made no sense at all. We asked if that's how it's supposed to be and the waitress said it is, but that just didn't seem right and they weren't cooked thoroughly so he didn't eat them. Horrible horrible place.

Having been a couple decades since I've been to an IHOP, nostalgic memories flooded back to me once we were seated at the table and the high fructose corn syrup bottles sat waiting to be sampled, such nectarous flavors such as strawberry, boysenberry and butter pecan. 
I ordered an omelet with avocado, dry wheat toast ( it came heavily buttered, and I tipsily enjoyed every bite), others ordered the fried chicken and waffles, scrambled eggs and turkey sausage, a green salad full of field greens and a small handful of diced tomatoes, and of course, pancakes. Everything was okay, nothing stood out or wowed us, mostly bland or quaggy in taste and texture, but it did make my slightly alcohol-soaked stomach happier. 
Service, our waitress at 2 am was more than accommodating and friendly. Putting up with our raucous bunch was probably somewhat challenging at times.

However, the service was something to be desired! First off we were told kids eat free with the purchase of an adult entrée. Then we get told that he didn't think that the computer was going to take them off because we ordered of the 'special menu'. Excuse me? Um yes it always has, and as we attempted to explain this to him he kept saying that he wasn't sure, he was new. So we asked if he could find out for us so in case we had to change our order and he tells us he can't unless he is cashing us out. Ok, so we ask if he could ask a manager and he told us there's no manager on duty. Are you serious? What business has no manager on duty? I call BS on that. Anyways we tell him that fine we will just take what we ordered and see what the computer does at check out. Two minutes later he comes and tells us that yes it will take the kids meals off. Good. Well here comes check out time and he gives us a bill at full price and a milk that we didn't order. Try to explain this to him at the register and he argues with us that he did take the 3 kids meals off and that yes we did order a milk. So my wife has to argue with him that no he did not remove the kids meals and that no we did not order a milk. He finally adjusts the ticket and it's amazing how the total went from $61 with supposedly the free kids meals to $34 once he fixed it. During this whole process we ask again for a manager and get told there is no manager on duty. I think that's unprofessional and sounds like either he didn't want the manager involved or the manager told them that they did not want to be disturbed because I doubt there would be no manager on duty. Another thing worth noting is I wouldn't waste time calling as our server told someone on the phone that they would have to call back as he is busy and had people waiting on him.

Food - 4 star - Very nice choices!  The fattening stuff, the lunch stuff, the dinner stuff, the dessert stuff and all the breakfast stuff seem to always be available.  I also think they do a great job for calorie and weight watching people.  Low salt, low calorie, low everything.  Very nice overall.

I ordered the cheesecake pancakes with scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, and crispy hashbrowns.  While the eggs and hashbrowns were adequate, my pancakes were delicious. These pancakes are the reason I drag my husband to IHOP. Our server was Claudia, and she was amazing. Fantastic service!",TCsq_NAdG5m93HPtzKj3kA,1,0,4,YRliYzG2Kb_vPufXBxWhPg

The food was ok, I just got pancakes, eggs and bacon.  My husband  got French toast eggs and bacon, I must say, I think it was worth $28.00  I think I will think twice about going here again for that price!",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,0,0,3,Xxp9YdBz1nmUi9Lq3odA_w

When we ordered our food, she had an attitude because I asked if I could get my quesadilla without chicken, being vegetarian. So I just said nevermind and got mozza sticks and fries. When she came back with our food, I asked if I could also get a cup of coffee. She SIGHED, rolled her eyes and said ""yea sure one sec"". When she came back with it, she slammed it on the table and walked off. Me and my friend ate, drank our coffee. And were ready to go. We sat there for 20 minutes before I got sick of it and asked another server to get our check. Worst $40 I've ever spent.",Yiq83rNm4rk7lCMbopmN9Q,0,0,3,1c7hBPYMHdJ7c8No0t7cKA
5390866,2014-04-25,1,0AZCpDQpbi83NHh9uEpggQ,"""It was IHOP on a Sunday, what do you expect?"" will be your first reaction to my review.   I've done take out a couple times over the last two months, and both times the experience wasn't exactly my idea of a good time.   Yes, both take-out calls were on a Sunday morning, and I'm well aware that IHOP on a weekend morning is going to be a madhouse.   And a madhouse it was!   The girls who work the front/cashier spot and also take the take out orders definitely had their hands full.  The 1st time half of my order had never even been put into the system so I had to wait an extra 20 minutes for it to be prepared.   The 2nd time my omelet came out as a regular one and not the egg-white version I'd asked for, so yes, another wait.   It would have been much more discouraging to enter the establishment, find these mistakes and see the cashiers just swiping their Tinder apps on their phone.    But instead they were faced with constant traffic of customers wanting to be seated, customers wanting to pay, people foolishly calling in take-out orders on a Sunday morning (what morons!), and customers like myself waiting for their revised orders and also inquiring if they had any sort of blackberry or boysenberry jam (they dont, only Strawberry and Grape?!)    So I forgive them for the mistakes, as they were very apologetic each time and kept a pleasant attitude through the maelstrom that is IHOP on weekend mornings.    I was a little disappointed in the lack of care management seemed to have about the situations (and yes, I did see a manager informed of the first issue).   No kind of offer of discounted or gratis items for the honest mistake, and not even an apology for the wait.  

Onto the food.   Both times I ordered an omelet for myself, and outside of the long wait, I was pretty pleased with them.   I'm weird when it comes to the amount of mushrooms I like on pretty much anything, so when my custom ordered omelet with swiss, bacon, mushrooms and spinach came out absolutely loaded with them, I spent a bit of time removing 3 lbs of them before consuming.   But I didn't preface my order with the fact I 'd only need a handful, so maybe they thought they were being generous.   NOTE TO IHOP:  feel free to substitute 4lbs of bacon instead of mushrooms next time.    Outside of mushroom-mania, everything else was to my liking and I would recommend the food here.    Just don't call it in on a Sunday.  duh.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,1,3,s5-1P0gNtNDmep39nGJSAg

I have never had a good experience with Ihop and now I will never go back. I am forever boycotting Ihop!,YSICosLjXOp-z0pre27NfQ,0,0,1,5LGdVLTIAg-IVKDGK-f6GQ

Kids were screaming the entire time. I asked for a pitcher of water. Never got it. The food was mediocre at best. This experience was terrible.,Iq2miDuqeAjVFdgwe_DvZw,0,0,1,AJMWBgIfnXbr6fZJQs7OUg

There was something odd about the taste of the food from the get go, but I just couldnt figure it out. I was starving, so I ate it anyways. BIG MISTAKE!!! Within a few hours I felt ill, and my lips were numb. I drank some water and attempted to sleep it off. The next morning not only I, but my entire family woke up vomiting and hibernating on the toilet all day long. It was a nightmare! I attempted to call and inform management, but it was impossible to get anyone on the phone - let alone get them to answer the phone. It was the same with corporate, no one seems to want to talk to anyone. 

Terrible! Oh, and in addition to getting sick - the service was terrible. Our waitress was rude! And, there were two tables within a few feet from us that sat unbussed with dirty dishes, food, drinks, and trash from previous customers. 

I will NEVER come here again. NEVER.",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,5,0,1,DWbzKdQgCPq1s01H4sRSJg
