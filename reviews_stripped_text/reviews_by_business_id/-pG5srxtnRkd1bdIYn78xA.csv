This spot is cafeteria-style, with several dishes to choose from, super-low prices, and patio seating. Note that they are also cash only, so come prepared.

A $5 plate will get you a huge portion of food, with rice and beans, a protein, and a side. The grilled chicken was amazing, super juicy with a flavorful skin. I added on a papa rellena (potato ball) to my order and it was unfortunately underwhelming, but the meal itself was solid and more than enough for dinner.

I didn't see any written menu available, so I just selected from the prepared options on display.

2956054,2017-11-29,0,-pG5srxtnRkd1bdIYn78xA,"I'm not an expert on Cuban food so I feel hesitant to give them such a mediocre score, but regardless I think there's a lot of things they can improve on.

First, the options are too limited. I don't know if Carlitos is planning to add more variations and choices but when I was there it was very limited: two choices of rice, two choices of meats, two veggie choices and desserts.

Secondly, the food itself did not taste very fresh. I went in here thinking it would be more restaurant style but it's set up buffet style, with the food pre-made and sitting in steamers. This is usually OK but sometimes the food doesn't taste 100% fresh, which was the issue here.

Lastly, no cards, cash only. Again, maybe because this place is new they don't have a proper POS system installed yet, but I hardly ever carry cash. I happened to have a few bucks in my car so I was lucky.

I really wanted to like this place. I remember having some of the best Cuban food ever when I was in Miami last spring so I came here expecting the same thing. I was disappointed they didn't have Cuban sandwiches or much of anything at all, but perhaps because it's new. I asked the workers a few questions but it didn't help that none of them could communicate with me.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,6,1,3,laNQESKjgq5QFEtBij4Z8Q

Got $5?  Seriously, find some of that change between your car seats, that's all you need!  $5 and change for some great, stick to your ribs kinda food!  Carlitos Cuban Food is no frill, but it ain't no joke either!  Tasty!

Came on a Saturday early afternoon for lunch.  Place was hoppin' busy!  Line was out the door for us, parking was a bit of a squeeze too.  But it was worth it!  $5 will get you fed WELL - get a takeout box with rice & beans, or rice & beans already mixed together, choice of a main protein, and an additional side!  Trust me, the portions are great, lots of food!

Choices for proteins and side vary by day according to what the chefs find at the market that morning.  That day I got lucky, gots me some slurpin' good simmered OXTAIL!  Got a side of fried yucca to go with it as well.  So yummy and sticky delicious!  I don't know what kind of spices they simmer the oxtail with, but it was flavorful, nice profile, and a tiny bit of heat!  Delicious with the rice & black beans!!  Then sop all that tasty juice up with some fried yucca!  This totally made me comfortable in the belly.

As if that wasn't enough - I gave in and got the Cubano sandwich - AGAIN, only $5!!  Comes in a combo with hot fries.  Dude!!  Girl at the counter said it's probably the best Cubano in Vegas.  Can't say she is wrong!  Such a simple looking sandwich - but layered with so many flavors and cooked to perfection!  You gotta eat this Cubano fresh off the grill, the bread they use is lightly crunchy but still got heft, the store-bought deli ham (yes it's probably key), the Swiss cheese, the pickles, mustard, all topped off with a heap of shredded pork - HOLY COW!  Umami town for sure!  It is such a great sandwich!  I'd come back a few times a week for this value of a Cubano - Subway footlong be damned!!

Yep, I'll be returning to Carlitos Cuban Food whenever I can, and that's probably often - because I only work 10 minutes away!!

Just one note here - it's a CASH ONLY business.  So bring your change, for real!!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,7,4,4,r5-73nARZHKJj_nZOYNEjg

4336466,2018-03-29,0,-pG5srxtnRkd1bdIYn78xA,"Authentic Cuban Food $5, Five Stars. 

A six word review in honor of Cuba's favorite adopted-son, Ernest Hemingway. 

This small kitchen offers some great Cuban favorites for $5. The combo comes with a starch, a protein, and a side, each with about a half-dozen options. You walk down the line and your choice for each selection gets lovingly heaped into a styrofoam container, a very similar process to a chipotle/subway.

I had the rice mixed with black beans, which was piled high to fill one-half of a styrofoam to-go container, the ground beef with veggies and olives, and fried sweet plantains, or platanos. 

All the dishes were fresh and delicious. I topped it off with a $2.50 Iron Beer Soda. What a treat! The flavor is akin to pepsi mixed with orange soda and maraschino cherry. 

I will definitely be back. Great place for authentic, cheap eats.

Be aware that it is cash only! 
Also, inside seating is limited, but there are more tables on the front patio.

We are so excited to have one within 15 minutes driving distance of Summerlin, conveniently off the I-95 and Decatur exit. Food at Carlitos is served cafeteria-style, and the menu changes daily. Seating is limited, so take-out is best. For only $5, you get a generous platter of Cuban country cooking with the choice of one main entree (usually four are featured), white rice/beans or congri plus one side (ex: plantains, yuca). Additional items can include papas rellenas (stuffed potatoes), tamales, empananas and such for less than $2 each. There are also desserts and tropical drinks. We have sampled the masitas de puerco (pork chunks), ropa vieja (shredded beef), stews, picadillo and breaded fish....all delicious. So far the only weaknesses have been the arroz con leche (a very dry rice pudding) and croquetas de jamon (fried ham croquettes that tasted off). The place would also benefit from better signage so that those who are not familiar with Cuban food can know the food options.
