They were full of so much flavor,  or to mention the guacamole that came with it.  The owner, José, came out and welcomed us.  We talked with him the whole time we were there.  He and his wife were so pleasant.  They were so polite, and very appreciative of us for coming in to their restaurant.  I will definitely be returning, and will be making recommendations to friends who will be coming into Las Vegas for El Cordobes restaurant.  Thanks, José!",w727ylVwBZq6Ytpjvn2DpQ,0,0,5,DX7QRWeKpGCbEBlUfuGzoA

2861871,2015-07-14,0,ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA,"A great little hole in the wall with excellent food! I had one of the combination plates - a taco and an enchilada. It was excellent! T came with refried beans and rice, both of which were on the same level as any I've had down in Mexico itself. I ordered the taco to be chicken, which was very tender and tasty. The enchilada was cheese, my favorite, and was just as good as any I've had south of the border. The chips were thin and crispy, just like I like them and the salsa had an excellent bite to it. Overall, the best Mexican food I've had since coming back from Baja last October. If you like good, real Mexican, you won't be disappointed. Don't let the ""dive-y"" look deter you from pushing the door open and going in. You won't be disappointed either! 

Oh yeah, they have real Mexican Coca-Cola in a bottle, too. If you've never had one, you'll be surprised at how different they taste from our Coke in the U.S. Try it!",E0pfxJoX1qNgr29uXwm5BQ,0,1,5,opOvHN3KrG4zYpwUq3Cfig

This place offers breakfast dishes like huevos a la mexicana, huevos rancheros, chilaquiles and more.  For lunch there is tacos, burritos, tostadas, taquitos, flautas, tamales, beef soup, pozole, menudo, seafood soup, ceviche, carne asada, goat stew(birria) and it goes on.  Mexican soda pop, beer, coffee, and other drinks.  This place takes cash only, and it is very inexpensive.  So splurge!",Y85yRsIwEi0ykFQxm1XF8g,0,0,5,qoMANknVgHTyI6sQF3YCTg
3579797,2013-06-01,0,ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA,"I have been here three times and the food here is awesome!  I didn't even know about this restaurant until my mom asked us to go with her.  The first time I went I ordered camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) which was delish.  During yesterday's visit I ordered 1 chile relleno burrito, 1 tongue taco, 1 adobada taco.  I asked for rice to be added to the burrito, and this was done :). The burrito was great with a lot of cheese.  The tacos had so much flavor.  The day before I tried the tacos from Taco Tijuana but the tacos at
El cordobes are better that Taco Tijuana.  
Taco Ranking so far FYI
#1 spot- Las Taquizas on Lamb and Bonanza. 
#2 spot- El Cordobes
#3 spot- Taco Tijuana
You can read my reviews for all.  
El cordobes has very good prices for their food.  Everything I had was 1 burrito, 2 tacos and 1 soda all for $10.50.  When I walk into this place it feels as if I were walking into my grandmas home to eat her food.  The only problem here is that they do not have flavored water like horchata, tamarindo and Jamaica.  All they have are sodas and beers, but the food is soo good that it makes up for this.  Please make sure you get the refried beans with your food!!  Also, I think it's cash only.  I payed cash but I think I saw a sign that said no debit/credit.",s03Hbpkhb2uklGs9y6k9DQ,3,2,5,QgLgUGYR1xngDCjcFtoEcQ

Chile relleno was really hard, I couldn't even cut it with my fork. The customer service was terrible. They were not attentive and didn't even refill my water. Then they seemed bothered when we asked them to split the check.",cj22D7EcgplTEbBtmOtyng,1,0,1,08Dnf0f8ToZ4fbFO56_yJA

My husband had a carne asada burrito smothered in green chili and topped with cheese. I had sopes (chicken and deseprada AKA shredded beef) they were amazing!

4720995,2017-07-27,0,ifkCEpYaSAUT3WVQNxwvXA,"This is just an awesome little ""hole in the wall"" Mexican restaurant. Their prices are great and their food has that home made taste that many places struggle to capture, but El Cordobes does it with ease.

If I had to describe this place in one word it would be ""authentic"". Their menu isn't tailored towards Americanized Mexican food like so many other places do. You won't find a salsa bar or queso dip, but you will find tortas (Mexican sandwiches) and things like goat soup.

As soon as you walk in you'll notice the dining area is very small, just a few booths and some tables in the middle. I wouldn't come here as a large group, as I don't think they would have the staff to handle it even if they had the room. This seems like a place that always has just one cook and one server.

I love the salsa here, though be warned it is a little spicy and they don't have anything milder (like I said, authentic). Funny enough this is they only thing I have had that seem's spicy, though everything is well seasoned. One thing that stand's out about their food is they seem to use less salt than any other Mexican Restaurant I have been to. You don't really notice how salty most Mexican food is until you come to a place like this that doesn't use as much. The lack of salt is actually a good thing, as it let's the natural flavors of the ingredients and seasoning's stand on their own. And heck, you can always add a little salt if you need it (though I have never felt the need here).

I've tried quite a few things on the menu, and I have been impressed with almost everything. I am even more impressed considering their prices are excellent. Almost all their meals are less than $10, and burritos run for $6 or less. The two thing's that just astound me are that they have ceviche tostadas for $1.50 and tacos for $1.25. You can't find prices like that at Mexican fast food, let alone a sit down environment! And they have a ton of meat options for the tacos to; chorizo, asada, pastor, carnitas and chicken just to name a few. My wife and I almost always get a few tacos in addition to our meals every time we come here as they are very good and you just can't beat that price.

My favorite thing on the menu is anything with shredded beef in it, though I also love their chili verde. To be honest the only thing I ever had here that I didn't like is a torta with breaded steak, and even then the flavor was good it was just really chewy and tough. I also see a lot of people order soups, which I haven't tried myself but smell great and are served in large bowls. The next time we come here I plan on trying one.

One last thing, they have Mexican sodas and Mexican beers for great prices to. Sodas are $2 and beers are $3. Everything is served in glass bottles, and the coke is even in the larger size than the typical 12 ounce size. Yet another thing that adds to the authenticity of this establishment.

If you love really good authentic Mexican food, then you really need to give El Cordobes a try. This is one of those places that really stands above most of the rest.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,0,0,5,is9_Mfyq1s5uPKpMbwmHLQ
