This location is convenient because it's close to home however the staff is always changing you can literally come within one or two weeks of each visit and everyone is different. When I'm not in the mood for their tasty chili I'll settle for some nuggets with some honey mustard sauce,XCt2YsumxosamY6fvHwbyw,0,0,3,U49JK8KRk_F5sK-N3sADXw

1985052,2017-02-27,0,bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA,Ok I've learned my lesson. I will NEVER go to this location again. My hamburger and fries were cold and old!  You could taste the old grease in the burger. The frosties are worse than ever. They've started pumping air into the mixture and it tastes like melted ice cream with foam. The employees are young and rude. They never thank you for your order. The manager must never be on site because the service and food is way below par. Do yourself a favor and find a better location if you really have to have their food. Wendy's use to be my place for a good hamburger- not anymore.,w9z4RxpTpGg4pOlr1h2k_A,0,0,1,SK0-VWBcaMJvRTUEjmQ86w

2962314,2016-06-02,0,bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA,"Normally I wouldn't review a mainstream fast food joint but the service and food I got at this Wendy's last night was so awful I have to share.  

My husband and I had a very late lunch which spilled over into a very late dinner and decided around 10:45pm that Wendy's sounded good.  We went through the drive-thru and were greeted by a female employee who, at first, seemed professional and friendly.  I was driving the car and after her greeting us and asking what we would like, I politely (and I'm especially polite at fast food restaurants out of fear of food sabotage!) asked her to give us a minute to look over the menu.  She very nicely said that was fine and instructed me to order when I was ready.  So far, so good.  

No less than 30 seconds later, she got back on the speaker and curtly said, ""Are you ready yet or what?""  I'm not sure what could possibly have happened in the half minute since she last spoke to us but her demeanor had changed drastically.  I wasn't really ready but again, in an effort not to piss off someone who's making my food in a sight unseen kitchen, I obliged and started to place our order.  She interrupted me probably 2 or 3 times while saying my order; it was just so rude.  I'm well aware that I need to indicate what size value meal I want and what kind of drink I want - no need to continually interrupt me while I'm speaking to ask me.  Wait until I'm done talking and if I haven't told you exactly what I want, then feel free to ask away.  But to interrupt me over and over again?  Hello?  Common sense and courtesy, anyone?  Both are highly lacking here.  

I pulled around to the window and gave my money to a gentleman who was nice but not overly friendly.  Not a big deal.  However, when the woman who was obviously the gem on the drive thru speaker (I say obvious because she was the only one there with a headset on) came to the window, she literally handed me the bag of food, did not look me in the eye a single time and started to close the window.  Not a word was spoken.  No thank you.  No enjpy your food.  No come back again.  Nothing.  I wondered if she had suddenly become a mute.  I said thank you as she was handing me the bag and she literally kept looking over my car and out into the street. Annoyed at this point, as she closed the window I yelled out to her, ""Hello?  I said thank you!"" She looked at me with a blank stare and walked away.  Again, not a word was spoken by her.  

Unfortunately, the food didn't redeem the horrible customer service.  The fries were obviously old and the tortilla on my grilled chicken wrap was so hard around the edges that I ended up just taking everything out of it and eating it like a salad (which, to be honest, wasn't that bad but I wanted a wrap, dammit!).  My husband did enjoy his burger but his fries were old, too.  

Look - I get that eating at a fast food joint is hit and miss and I understand that going late at night can get even sketchier but there's just no justification for an employee acting like that and most definitely no excuse for the food to be old and hard.  If you're open until midnight or 1am, I should be able to get food that late that's as fresh as it is if I come at the dinner rush.  I'm sympathetic to fast food employees - it's a thankless job, they're not paid well and I'm quite certain that a lot of their customers (especially in this shady area of town) are real pains in the ass.  

With that being said, like I mentioned before, I am NOT a pain the ass when ordering food at any restaurant establishment, and most definitely not if I'm ordering at the drive through of a fast food place.  If I'm being rude and condescending, by all means - dish it back out to me! I don't expect to be treated well if I'm not treating you well.  But if I'm nice, friendly and respectful, is it too much to ask for the same?  

And now I'll close - with this being the longest Yelp review I've ever placed.  Whew!  I'm coming up for air and if you've made it all the way to the end of this, I salute you!",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,2,0,1,l4uJsLDJj05gbA7UE-CEJg

3337885,2016-01-16,0,bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA,"For the third time in a row they have jacked up my order. I would be more understanding if the people working in the window were not English speaking, but this is insane! 

I told the young man twice that my order wasn't correct (I order the same thing every week) and he still messed it up. Then the man who brought it to me didn't have the two drinks, and when I told him there was supposed to be a Coke as well, he handed me the lemonade and said he didn't have a Coke. Well, I can totally see he doesn't have a Coke...  

AGAIN... Not a speaker of another language. I can be patient, they are at least TRYING to make a living.  

Then he acted like it was a huge pain to go get the other drink!  Really!  I paid for it, and if I have to go in and talk to the manager someone is going to be finding a new job!  I don't have a problem calling corporate or the owner.",WubpjuDIAkwuDvN08SvMdw,0,0,1,0Arvi3UiJUv06GO-PmXkDw

4722730,2016-07-04,0,bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA,This is by far the worst Wendy's in the world.  And that's a stretch because most Wendy's are pretty good.  One night I came in and this huge family cut in front of me.  I only had one small order but would you believe it they served them first before making my one sandwich.  They are very inconsiderate and their work is sloppy.  That was terrible that they did that to me and I've been a loyal customer to them for a long time.  Most of the workers there are okay but I found out the hard way that some of them are hateful.  The dining room is run down and dirty and smells bad.  Their restrooms are always dirty too.

I almost never change my order there, haha. I always get a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, value cut fries, 4 piece crispy chicken nuggets (with BBQ sauce), and a chocolate frosty. This meal is so cheap, it's crazy, but it really hits the spot. I personally like their chicken nuggets better than McDonald's.

Recently I started ordering the strawberry lemonade, which is quite tasty!

I noticed they now offer a caramel frosty? I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds delish! I may have to try it next time I visit.

Oh, I also noticed that this location is open very late now! I can't remember the exact times, but I believe they are open until at least 1 am everyday. I think the latest they stay open is until 2 am! Yaaaay!",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,2,1,4,ZegQ7r7rRgkmJTPI7NiPdQ
