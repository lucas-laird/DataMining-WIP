we went there for dinner last night. started with apps of salt and pepper shrimp and veggie egg rolls (menu says seafood, but they are veggie now). salt n pepper shrimp were awesome!  could have just eaten those all night, but we would have missed some other good stuff.

then we had the seafood chowder.  nothing like American chowder.  chunks of misc seafood (i don't like fish, so i didn't look to close at what i was eating) in a broth base.  not an overly fishy taste or smell.  i finished a whole bowl.

the mongolian beef had good flavor and a nice spicy kick.
i didn't try the fish in black bean sauce but the other 4 in our party really liked it.
the chow main with beef, chicken, and shrimp was decent. the large pieces of beef, chicken, and whole shrimp were generous.

and, the best item of the night:  Lobster!  a whole lobster! they had a special where lobster was $8.88 a pound.  ours was just over 4 pounds. there were several ways to have it prepared, and at our waiter's suggestion, we went with the ginger and scallion sauce. everyone loved it!

total bill was only $116 for the 5 of us. great price for 2 apps, soup, and entrees, including us ""splurging"" on the lobster.  all were stuffed and very satisfied.",uftVgvFArubrcsuXu7fEfg,0,0,4,hokqeWV8J70rUxSqOcphEA

Inside the restaurant, the light is very enough/ Four big TVs surrounding the dining area, and they are always playing Cantonese songs. If someone's birthday, they also play Happy Birthday.

If not for the waiter, I might have given this place 3 stars.  The food was good, though nothing spectacular.  They did have good prices which is why I think my ""chicken"" noodle in black bean sauce was actually ""chicken fat"" noodle in black bean sauce.  The taste itself wasn't bad, but I'd rather not eat a piece of chicken with the yellow gelatinous fatty skin hanging off every piece.

My partner ordered ""chicken"" fried rice, but the server heard ""shrimp"" fried rice (it was sort of tasty though).  The waiter repeated twice what he ordered, the first time I heard him say shrimp, but the second time I could have sworn he said chicken...but alas, what he brought out was ""shrimp"" fried rice.  My partner jovially said he had ordered the chicken, but would take the shrimp.  The waiter actually seemed offended.  He said ""no, you ordered shrimp.""  Uhm, ok, I think we know what we ordered...but then he had the nerve to turn away from the table, throw up his hand and wave it while walking away, as if to say he was done with us.  OH HECK NO (neck starting to roll).  My mouth went open and all I could say was, ""did you see what he did?""  Never once did we throw 'tude because we received the wrong order...we just pointed out that we had not ordered what was brought out, but would take it anyway.  We should have got up, but we didn't...we were hungry and munched the food unhappily.  The waiter, meanwhile, went to talk about us to another waiter.  I know this, because I was staring right at him.

By the time we were done, the ""other"" waiter passed our table and asked if we were ready for our check.  Yes, please...when I attempted to pay with my debit/credit card, the guy said there was a $25 minimum order.  Uhm, now WTF?  excuse me?  Where was this posted?  Nowhere that I saw...well, I don't carry cash, so I asked, ""do you have an ATM?""  No, was the reply...so he took my card and charged me a $0.50 fee because it was under $25.00.

Needless to say, I will NEVER go back to this place and I will adamantly stand against it.  There is no excuse for rude service...and if you're going to have a minimum for a card, then post it.",gpFtRKASVimMqE39TXJMXg,4,2,1,_DwXJQRZfx69eCRqZWSR4A

I feel bad for not agreeing with my fellow yelpers. The BF and I were excited to try HK Star, but was utterly dissappointed with the quality of the food and service. As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted with an unpleasant scent that reminded us of being in a pet store. Immediately after being seated, we were asked if we were ready to order prior to even looking at our menu's. Customer service could use some improvement. Typically going to a restaurant you would expect a certain level of service (ie. not having to ask for refills after being there for an hour).  

As for the food aspect, I feel that the quality was not very authentic. I would not recommend HK Star as a top Chinese restaurant. We ordered the Beef Chow Fun with black bean sauce, Honey Walnut Shrimp, and Chinese Broccoli with garlic. They made a mistake and brought out Beef Chow Fun with BROWN GRAVY instead of black bean sauce. However, the server was kind enough to correct the order. The noodles were overcooked and the honey walnut shrimp was mediocre - I actually think the Honey Walnut Shrimp at Panda Express has more flavor. The Chinese Broccoli was tough and leafy. To top it off, they had disturbing content of weird looking insects being prepared and cooked on their tv's. Not very appetizing when eating. 

On a positive note, The hot tea they served helped break down the food.

The interior is decent and pretty big, but I hardly see this place filled with customers -- maybe that explains why the workers are always chilling.

Since there's a competing restaurant now, I guess the customers are getting spread. The service here is definitely better and they run super super cheap tasty lunch specials.

1743858,2010-08-01,0,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"Treated Badly - food was tasteless!

We were looking for good authentic Cantonese's Chinese Food and after reading the reviews here we gave HK a try only to be so disappointed in the way we were treated and only 1 out of the 2 dishes being editable. 

The Service was slow, uncaring and the attitude towards the customer was just terrible. 

We ordered an Eggplant dish and the Sauté Shrimp. The Eggplant was decent but the Shrimp dish $15.95 (highest on the menu if you don't opt for the $12 extra charge for fresh shrimp $27) was buried in celery with about 6 - 8 medium shrimps. The taste was bland, nothing there. The Eggplant was decent with tiny crumbs of hard fish. 

When the waiter took our order he said that if we were 4 people (instead of 2) that we would of received a free 1/2 a chicken if our order was over $38 (our bill was $48) but since we were only 2 he couldn't offer this to us? Then he said he would give us a free cup of soup, my wife asked if it had meat in it as I don't eat beef or pork, he said it had pork so he would give us Egg Drop Soup. 

At the end of the meal they charged us $5.95 for the soup! When we questioned this, the manager and waiter treated us in the most condescending way possible, not listening to anything we said as we even attempted to explain our understanding of the situation, instead presenting us with this huge painted smile and patting me on the shoulder telling me to be on my way! 

We were never rude in anyway. My wife (Chinese) was so quiet & polite in trying to get an understanding presented to them but they treated her with total disrespect (especially the manager like she wasn't worth listening to). 

We couldn't believe that we were being treated this way. We were 100% in the right as we never ordered the soup, nor would we of had it to our table if we knew we were being charged. 

As we were walking out the door they said to my wife the free soup was only the pork soup but never mentioned this until we confronted them about the charge. $48 for an Eggplant/Shrimp and Egg Drop Soup? Never again will we step foot in this place! 

So purely on the quality of the food, if you like bland tasteless Hong Kong style Chinese food you may want to give this place a try. If you care at all about how you are to be treated or cheated by the management and staff then do yourself a favor and stay away!

The Skinny: pretty good selection of Cantonese styled dishes done well (3.75), service: is poor but pretty standard across Chinese restaurants (2), value: can't beat the crazy lunch prices here where dishes range from $5-6 (4).

We came here for lunch on a Friday at 2 pm. This is the least busy I have seen this place.

My hubby and I have come here for dinner multiple times in the evenings but this was the first time for lunch.

We ordered the prawns stirfried with egg, salt & pepper porkchops and the string beans sauteed in XO sauce. The best thing was the salt & pepper porkchops. The porkchops were flavourful and tender on the inside while the batter was light, crispy and non-greasy.  Stingbeans were stirfried nicely however the XO sauce lacked complexity due to the addition of jalapeno. The prawn dish tasted fine but was drenched in oil.

Honestly combined with the previous food experiences here, the food itself would rate a 4 probably. But the service seems to been significantly less attentive since we were there last even despite the fact the restaurant was relatively quiet (ie, we kept having to ask our waiters for refills for things - water, tea).

Due to service issues, this place rates a solid 3.5.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,4,3,YEPqwNYBoLNNULX01ISEig

Two dishes that we always order are the salt and pepper shrimp and salt and pepper pork.  Everything we have ordered has been good except for a clay pot(this particular dish needs a couple hours to cook not 30 min). HK Star has a bad rap on here because people always complain about service, to those that complain about service this is a restaurant, not a day care. Waiters are not supposed to spoon feed you.

plenty of parking

2481209,2012-02-09,1,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"Yes, this is where you want to eat Chinese when in Vegas.

 First, this place is LEGIT Chinese food.  Its not difficult to find good Thai in Vegas local restaurants, and a case can be made to say the same for Vietnamese, Japanese, & Korean, but Chinese?  That's been the elusive one.  Well, look no further, finally I found it!  I haven't had better since I was in New York.  If you want to have delicious Chinese food and you want to find it in a local restaurant (not inside a pricey casino hotel) then this is THE spot.

  The atmosphere was nice, not extravagantly decorated, but pleasant enough.  Most patrons were Asian, I noticed just one other white guy in the place.  Employees did not speak English, other than the names of the plates, but it didn't cause any issues for me.  A nice size kettle of hot tea was immediately brought to the table.

  The menu is large, with lots of seafood, and separated into categories by the meat used in the main dish.  There are certainly some strange dishes (snake anyone?) so I stuck to the safe,  tried and true American white guy favorite dishes.

  For an appetizer I had Wanton soup.  This came in one size for about eight bucks, but there were around ten large dumplings.  The broth was tasty but not as salty and rich as I would get in the North East, so I had to add soy sauce, but the dumplings were everything I hoped for.  Big chunks of shrimp and meat inside, and no ""mystery"" items that go ""crunch"".  

  I had the Shrimp w/ Cashews for my main course, and it didn't disappoint.  The shrimp were plentiful and large, cooked and cleaned just right.  The vegetables were crisp and fresh.  Lots of cashews, and the sauce was nice.  The white rice was also good, although I was expecting ""sticky"" rice not ""jasmine"".  I really couldn't have asked for more from this plate.

  To drink I had a ""Lucky Buddha Beer"", known for its neat green glass bottle shaped like Buddha.  I'm not a die-hard fan of Asian style beers, but this one has become my favorite beer overall recently. Crisp, clean, and refreshing, almost a sweetness.

  Total price is moderate.  Its certainly not cheap, but neither is it expensive.  The beer was pricey, but that's to be expected.  It's a nice middle-of-the-road restaurant.

  The service was acceptable, but nothing to write home about.  Tea and food came out very quickly, but water is not served unless asked for, and there is not much ""checking up"", I sat with an empty glass of beer for a long time and was never asked if i wanted another.  There was a slight communication issue when i asked a question about the wanton soup, like I said, no English here.  But the staff was at least friendly, and I've certainly had worse.

  Oh and the restaurant hours - on a Thursday night they were open until midnight, with a full menu.

  Overall, I have to say this is by far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas so far.  Not that there is much competition.

I got pea shoots and Szechuan pork. Both dishes were pretty good. The pork dish had a little too many onions though.

There was a lot of crab, lobster, and fish but I didn't eat any of it. 

There was a slight debacle where they charged us $1 per person for rice, which was something they haven't done before. We didn't even ask for rice; they handed us rice and didn't tell us about the charge. After some complaining we got the $8 fee waived (ridiculous since a bag of rice that feeds like 30 people is $8).",taPq7IxYskEWH7Vfc261pQ,2,0,3,U2psCaKfPPENZ-NGkgJkOg

3014528,2010-03-31,0,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"After many of you wrote to me to try out this restaurant because of my review of Food Express Chinese Restaurant, I decided to stop by today to give it a try.

I have to say that I absolutely love the location--off the beaten path, not on Spring Mountain like I expected, and in this strip mall on the corner of Jones & Desert Inn.  I thought it was closed due to the lack of cars parked in front, but they were open, and I was happy.

Walking in is like walking into a Chinese restaurant back home: cloth covered tables, those shiny, rounded wooden chairs and money bamboo and statues around the place.  I love the fact that they play Chinese TV and speak their language while you're around.  It makes the whole experience more comfortable and authentic, which I love.  We were seated immediately and given some time to order.

They didn't take our drink order right away, which I'm not used to, but I think they were being polite by giving us five minutes to decide what to eat out of their extensive menu.  They provided 3 menus--lunch, dinner, and their authentic cuisine menu.  I also appreciate their Boba shake menu, which I love to drink!  If you ever try one, get the melon flavor with apple tapioca or without tapioca. It's so yummy!

I was happy to find the intestines, jellyfish, sharks fin, among other dishes that most people find exotic.  They are all my favorites!  We went for an all out lunch and ate quite a bit of food, and here's the breakdown to the experience:

Sharks fin soup: 1 bowl is 28 dollars unless you want the ultra fin which is 48 a bowl.  I ate the one with crab and brown sauce, which was to die for!  Just like home and made with real sharks fin, not that fake stuff.  You can tell from the cartilidge connectors and the soft white flesh that gets stuck with some of the fin.  It was absolutely yummy!  Nice and salty, briny, and tasted like the egg flower soup base with a bit of soy sauce and seafood.  

Salt & pepper fried shrimp (without shell): Wow. This has this great, light batter that it's fried in and topped with a little chopped garlic, pepper and slices of pepper on top.  Nice and spicy and with the right saltiness.  It's so nicely seasoned and light that I could eat a whole plate to myself without realizing it, honestly.  Great appetizer.

Half fried chicken: They have a few options of fried chicken and honestly I can't remember which one I ordered, but I think it was the Queen.  Either way, it was super crispy skin and moist chicken pieces with that great salt and sugar to sprinkle on top.  Great dish and it satisfied that fried chicken craving I had for days.  No one can go wrong with any of their fried chicken.  If you prefer no salt, they serve it on the side anyway, so season to your liking!  Even without the side salt, the skin has a nice flavor to it and has that hint of salt and pepper.

Honey Walnut prawns: Who can go wrong with sweet shrimp?  Lightly fried, great mayo lemon sauce and a wonderfully crunchy, sugared walnuts.  I loved stacking the nuts on the shrimp and eating one whole shrimp as one bite.  The textures are amazing with this dish, having that soft, creamy shrimp and mayo sauce and that crunchy, sweet walnut with it--it's to die for.  One of the best I've tried in Vegas.  Not as preferable for me as Food Express' version, but still god.

Live Steamed Lobster with silver and gold garlic: Need I say anything more than lobster and garlic?  They bring it out to get your approval.  I went for 4 pounds at 16/lb and it was worth every penny!   Succulent, chopped up into easy-to-handle pieces and coated in that amazing crunchy garlic.  It was absolutely wonderful and I wasn't ashamed to suck and slurp the pieces and use my fingers. They put just enough butter in the dish to make it flavorful but not oily, so that was lovely.  Trust me--it's really good.

Overall a great meal and worth the price ticket, for sure.  I'm glad that I found this place because of you, readers!  If you haven't tried it, please do.  It is authentic and a great place for foodies to try exotic foods.  For a restaurant to bring me a dish that transports me back to my childhood back on Guam is a great find, and this restaurant did it with their sharks fin soup.

Hop in the car and try this place.  It's like taking a trip to Hong Kong without leaving the city, and you can even take that experience to go.  Happy travels!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,3,3,5,nPwMcNyZXBg7vw7CGsXf_g

And I tend to say this in most of my Chinese restaruant reviews.... you can't rank Chinese restaurants on Service and Timeliness.  Asian restaurants get a pass, unfortunately.  Generally speaking, Asian people are rude.  

Go walk in SF or NYC Chinatown and see how many people bump into you, cut you in line, spit on you, and deliver bad service.   Look we're kind of misunderstood.

Located in a strip mall in the oriental part of town (Chinatown?), I would not have come here unless it was recommended.  The outside, so often misleading, would lead one to believe this is another mediocre Chinese-American restaurant.  

The service was haphazard and spotty, no doubt due to the language barrier and me using my pigeon-talk mixture of the little Cantonese I retained from childhood and simple english.

We did get our order in, and in short order the food began to collect on our table.  There was soup, a chicken and corn soup and a shrimp soup, both good as appetizers.  Then, everything from steamed fish (flounder) to fried tofu, walnut shrimp, pot stickers, sauteed baby bok choy, garlic chinese green beans, roast duck, and a clay hot pot (bitter cucumber and ribs)!  Although it was all very good, the crowd I was with really enjoyed the tofu and veggies (green beans and bok choy) above the other dishes.

It was one of my In-laws' birthday so we took him here to celebrate. I didn't yelp this place because if I did...I wouldn't have step foot in here. The only reason we came was because my MIL saw it in a Chinese newspaper ad and said it looked good.

Okay, so we ordered the food and it came out. We all ate a piece of geoduck and everyone ate a piece and we said it tastes funny. My husband smelled it and put it in his mouth and had to spit it out because it taste rancid. He called the waiter over and told him that the geoduck wasn't fresh. The waiter then told him that the geoduck was fresh...my husband told the waiter to taste it and he wouldn't. The waiter walked to the kitchen and came back to our table and told us that the geoduck just died. WTF? Really??! Why did you lie to us and tried to serve us a dead geoduck like we're idiots?! They asked us if we wanted to replace crab for the geoduck and we said that's fine.

We finished eating and received our bill. It was ridiculous. A meal like that and it costs $280 before tips!!! Over $80 for a fish and $70 bucks for a crab? Are you FN out of your mind? So it's $150 for just those two items alone?! Since it was my in-laws' birthday we didn't want to make a big deal since we were the one paying for it. If it wasn't a special occasion I would have told them off! I rather go have a French dinner at a fancy restaurant for the price we paid. Nah, I would rather give a homeless person that amount then to let people who run this establishment any of my money. Shame on you!!!

My family raved about how great this place was and we decided to go back here again based on my family's previous experience. When we went here for dinner, there was no one in the restaurant. People arrive after 6:30PM.  We were seated and we placed our order. After placing our order of various Chinese dishes and receiving our order, it was like the waiter forgot we were there. 

Don't get me wrong, the food was great. The service needs to be worked on because quite frankly, if you're the only group in the restaurant, it's not THAT hard to have good service. 

Vegas is hot and there are a lot of flies in the area. They don't have that AC Unit that prevents flies from coming in. Every time the door opened more flies would come in. Unless you like fending flies off while you eat, you should not eat here.

We kept asking for more rice and we didn't get it. After we got our dishes, the restaurant filled up and it was like a free for all trying to get the waiter's attention. We had to keep trying to wave down the waiters.  When we wanted our bill we had to do the same thing. We were ready to pay. They did not pick up our bill. My brother ended up walking the bill over to the register. Do they not want to get paid?

Even though I am part Chinese, my Cantonese is very limited so I asked about their menu for large parties.  The first one they handed me was in English and started at $218! So I balked and asked about the cheaper prefix menu..you should have seen their face..like what menu??  You know the cheaper one I say...OH they say but it's only in Chinese..okay so you can translate it for me then! (smile)

Anyways- so we get the cheaper prefix menu and it's only in Chinese, well, I start asking them what was on the one for $68 and what was on the one for $148.  After a little haggling back and forth about whether I can switch out certain dishes and get others instead ( really wished my mom was there cause she is a way better haggler) we decide to just stick with the $148 prefix menu.

What we got:
Soup- lotus root with pork shoulder ( it was good)
Cold App- jellyfish, boneless chicken feet and assorted meats (was okay only, most of my party did not partake as it was not their cup of tea)
Steamed Chicken with ginger sauce- was really yellowish but everyone enjoyed it
Walnut Prawns- gone before I got any!
Cubed Steak- again gone before I got any
Lobster Cantonese- was okay, wished I could've switched it out for crab instead but was good overall
Chinese vegetable and mushroom dish- was tasty, the kids really enjoyed it
Whole Flounder- the head, tail and fins were fried and the rest was filleted and sauteed with vegetables ( really good)
Scallops and Veggies sauteed- also gone before I got to it
Clams in basil on a hot pot- it was okay, the hot pot doesn't work cause if you don't eat the clams right away, they end up overcooked
Red beans and tapioca for dessert

Oh and service was a little slow even though there were only 3 tables in there at that time, I had to ask three times for condiments!

Overall, it came to about $160 with tax..would I order the prefix again? Probably not...being that I was the only Chinese person at my table, I think most of the dishes were a little too ""authentic"" better just order off the menu next time!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,2,1,3,_cXZ0XURiK4detzz0aQMVA
4107137,2015-06-22,2,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"I don't normally eat Chinese food. But when I do, I prefer something good.

Sorry, I couldn't figure out a satisfying conclusion to that catchphrase. But Chinese food isn't something that I tend to crave. It doesn't come to my mind as really must-eat since it became mundane territory with wedding banquets and dinners with relatives growing up. Long story short, I've rarely eaten it in Vegas.

However, an opportunity came today when several friends gathered at HK Star for dinner. It was my first time here, so I mostly deferred to others for ordering. We ended up having more than enough for all of us.

- ""Spicy"" jellyfish ($9.95): always seems like more of a textural experience for me than something that I seek out for a special flavor, but it was crunchy enough and came with pickled onions. I didn't really detect any heat when I ate it. I'd skip it unless you specifically like jellyfish or want to try it.

- Minced chicken with sweet corn thick soup ($9.95): they bring out your large bowl and then ladle it into smaller bowls at the table. Much better than the last corn soup I had, but let's not dwell on it. Definitely solid flavor in the corn, egg, and chicken in this soup.

- Honey walnut shrimp ($14.95): I specifically ordered this. The shrimp were cooked fine, although they could have been more crunchy. Good flavor, not overly drenched with sauce, and plenty of chopped honey walnuts. I usually prefer whole walnuts, but these were fine.

- Deep-fried flounder ($23.95): my favorite dish of the night. Tender, delicious fried fish that you'd expect to get from a Chinese restaurant.

- Chinese broccoli ($9.95): I'm not a vegetable aficionado really, but these were crunchy and juicy. They are worth an order.

- Seafood, dry scallop and egg white fried rice ($14.95): tasty enough and not overly fatty, but I wasn't that impressed when considering the price. My friends definitely loved it though.

- Roast duck ($19.95 for a ""whole"" order): a little less sweetness than you might find elsewhere, but juicy and flavorful.

- Lobster, breaded and fried ($94.27 for 4.5 lbs at current market price): They pulled a lobster for us to look at when we were ordering, then took it back to the kitchen. It came out tasting pretty good, and it was cooked properly except for the claw piece that I had (too mushy there), more of the salty flavor is in the breading than in the actual lobster meat. I would probably try a different lobster preparation next time.

- Complimentary hot dessert soup: delicious and not overly sweet.

They probably have a pretty big kitchen in the big. Despite a fairly crowded dining room, our dishes all came out quickly and in quick succession, requiring some careful manipulation of the Lazy Susan and the other free table space to hold all the dishes satisfactorily. A server helped out a little over halfway through by giving us fresh plates and taking away the old ones with bones and mixed sauces. Decor is certainly on the nicer side for a Chinese restaurant.

At the end of the night, I felt satisfied with most of the dishes. I have no problem coming back here for Chinese food should the craving actually strike.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,4,YQa9k13laSu1hPk9Jp-v7w

They were running a special  - purchase 3 entrees and get lobster for $10.00 a pound. Ended up ordering clams with basil, rock cod stir fried with Chinese veggies, Mongolian beef and lobster with green onions and ginger. All the seafood was fresh tasting and solid (They brought me the lobsters live to approve). My least favorite was the Mongolian beef which was spicy to my surprise. The waiter who was a younger Vietnamese gent spoke perfect English and was funny conical but was on the spot with service. What a difference compared to my last visit.

Things we had,

- Pork chops with black pepper and salt: It was crunchy and yummy. You know how deep fried stuffs are usually good?

As I mentioned in my review of China Mama, this center is super busy, and the greatest accomplishment is finding a parking space.

When we walked in, there was a group of Chinese businessmen in suits, sitting at a large corner table. It almost looked like a scene from an old movie, where the Chinese Mob was planning something in San Francisco.

That was the highlight of this visit. 

The bottom line is simple: The prices were on the high side for this type of food, and the quality just wasn't worth it. From the hot and sour soup, to the entree and side dishes we ordered, it seemed no better than a ""hole in the wall"" take out, that re-heats its left overs.

We were not only disappointed with the food, but the service was less than friendly.

My friend, Phillip gave this place 5 stars 5 years ago. It must have changed owners, and the new owner is cutting corners to pay for the place. 

I will agree with Dave R, and his review. It's worth reading.

We arrived at dinner time.  Surprisingly, the restaurant was not crowded, but more people arrived as time passed.

The food was good, but nothing to rave about.  The waiter got our order wrong though.  One of the dishes we ordered was Rock Cod with Salt & Pepper, but instead he got us Salt & Pepper Pork Chop.  The only reason I didn't fume about this is because my family and I like the pork chop dish as well, so we just let it slide.

A good point is that since we ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, the waiter actually poured soup, noodles, and a wonton into each of the 4 bowls.  I'm not sure if it's customary for the waiters to do that at the Chinese restaurants (despite my frequenting of many Chinese places), but I thought it was good customer service.

He also spoke some Tagalog with us to break the ice.  I was impressed.

The waiters also speak English, which is not always the case at other Chinese restaurants.

Also, when we finished our entire container of white rice, they delivered another full container.  Yes, we eat that much rice.

My only complaint is that they never bothered to refill our cups of water, but this is pretty common in Chinese restaurants so I can't really dock them for that.

I would eat at this place again.  However, I'd be more careful when ordering so that the waiter doesn't get it wrong next time.",ZYm9D3D1nBcWjDjrxhSqPw,0,0,4,dGzixSW_EMyTC9rVakWszQ

I don't really know the name of the noodle dish in English, so I'm guessing what I called it is probably close.  These were lunch portions and were reasonably priced.

It's actually right across the stress from where we had Vietnamese the other day and I liked this meal much better.  They gave a type of soup that was like a pork & chicken broth as a pre meal cursor.

Service was fine - no rudeness nor super friendly, just average.  And for me, since there was no rudeness, I would give it 5 stars for being Chinese.

HK Star is a Chinese seafood restaurant with a caffeteria-like feel tucked inconspicuously behind the more well known China Mama's. Though the ambience and several of their dishes leave something to be desired, there are some redeeming items on the menu.

Two such gems include the aforementioned 'salt and pepper cod' ($6.95 lunch, $9.95 dinner) and 'salt and pepper shrimp' ($6.95 lunch, $11.95 dinner). Both are lightly battered and deep fried, then tossed with hot chilies and crispy garlic bits. The 'salt' description rings true as well, though they have successfully managed to not go overboard with it. I couldn't pick a favorite between the two options, as the cod is flaky and moist and the shrimp are plump and snappy. These are certainly the best two items on the menu, and you won't miss the 'chips' at all.

The sauteed vegetables ($5.95 lunch, $7.95 dinner) come with a nice variety of mushrooms, one of which is kind of chewy and sponge like. After a google search I think I can call it 'snow fungus,' though I can't be entirely sure. Pass on the Kung Pao cod ($9.95) as the only flavors emerging from the blonde sauce come from the peanuts and MSG.

The scene is a hurried and the staff are not entirely friendly, but for the prices of those fried morsels I'm willing to tolerate a less than stellar overall experience.

Service is just stellar. The waiter was very attentative and it shows he's passionate about his job. He recommended an alternative fish to give us freshness instead of a frozen fish. Our waiter also had a kid of his own, so he got along well with our coworker's twin babies. Lastly, he showed us how to pull the last remaining meat from the tail of the lobster without destroying it. It was super tender and just orgasmic. 

Lobster, sea bass, beef and mushroom with oyster sauce, and steamed cod was all great. Only issue was the fried tofu needing a sauce since it was like just eating french fries. I recommend the sweet and sour sauce.

You can get an entire fried fish (my favorite) with the side of a spiced soy sauce for $7. Also, their XO string bean is very good! I get so addicted to them.

4884712,2010-09-01,0,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"I came into HK Star with my roommate today and had a great lunch.  They had many choices for the lunch special based on price.  One section was 4.95, the other was 5.95, and the most expensive was 6.95.  While many lunch specials come with salad, soup, egg roll, and maybe some other items, HK star's lunch special came with only the entree and a side of rice.  This was no problem, though, because the portion of the entree was very large.  
We got one order of crispy dumplings for 4.95, and they were probably the best dumplings I have ever had.  The dough on the outside was soft, yet crispy on the outside, and the meat on the inside was plentiful, and, more importantly, seasoned perfectly.  When you bit into the dumplings, they poured juice into your mouth and a little into the hands, which is exactly what I want.  It wasn't water being poured into your mouth, it was the juiciness of the chicken.  I would definitely suggest getting a plate of dumplings when you go!
For my lunch entree, I got the Duck, and my roommate got the Mongolian Beef.  The duck was a very large portion, and was served with a thin, yet flavorful sauce, and boiled peanuts.  Very good dish, especially for only 5.95!  The Mongolian Beef was surprisingly very good, too.  I don't usually like the americanized chinese dishes, but this one had just the right amount of spice, and even the onions with the dish were very good.

They have lunch specials that are discounted from the dinner menu.

4934565,2014-05-14,0,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"Yessiree! This place is pretty darn good!  Close to home as I can imagine. If you are for the west coast and likey 2nd or 3rd generation Cantonese food then this place is the place to go  if you are from Hong Kong or more of the Panda or PF Chang style of Chinese food then this may not be a five star event for you. 

First look- I first checked if they have tanks to hold fresh seafood and fish. They do so that was a great sign. Now I decided not to order a fish from here due to the cost but good to know that they have fresh live fish. 

Next check was to see if they have real home style soup. The plain broth with some mustard greens and beef bones. Yep they had several choices so I was felling darn good. I did not order a soup due to this being lunch and I was going for the big entree test today. 


My time tested entree test:

Bitter Melon with beef-  the butter melon was sliced thin and the beef was also thinly sliced. Nice flavor and just the right amount if black bean sauce. I love bitter melon and it had to be al dente to be right and this was just about perfect. 

Steamed pork with salted fish-  this brought back the home cooking from my mom and grandma. I love the flavor of the pork steamed and even the juices. The salted fish on top added a nice flavor. 

Steamed flounder - this was about as good as it gets. The fish had the best juicy flavor when steamed with a bit of scallion and green onions. The bone came off easily and the meat was firm. I normally order  a Rock Cod but did not want to pay he big bucks. 19.95 for steamed flounder was just right. 

Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce- my go to favorite but alas the kids ate so much of this so quickly that I only had a bit of a taste. Crispy and crunchy with just the right amount if oyster sauce for a subtle salty flavor. 

Curry Chicken -  love this dish and here the curry was the right spice and consistency. I was a bit dialed that here was not enough chicken or potatoes yet this was still a great dish. 

Chicken with green onion. - this is my all time favorite dish. Simply prepared chicken on the bone and cut up with a sauce made of minced scallions. We ordered a full order vs. half due to wanting to have some for home later. 

To me, this is very home style authentic west coast cantonese food.  I really enjoy this place.

 So based on all my favorite food items, this place I consider to be top notch in my book. GK says check it out!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,3,5,gIaBeaBaeqfvz6x0Xm9ctQ

Service is horrible here, it took me awhile to get my water, servers gave us plastic fork because they said utensils is being washed. Really? Everyone uses chopsticks here.

I felt like if you aren't not in the Asian race they would not care for u, notice a group that came after we sat and the servers were   attentive to their orders.

Food is good no doubt I love them for that, and preferable to eat during dinner when the owner or manager is in. The servers act like a bunch of monkeys today without a trainer by there side.",Sm9x596MhO6DHqaznBrpLg,2,1,1,N2v-zgeLbHA59B0TWI-s-g
4974486,2010-10-16,2,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"Lunch specials are the real star of this place!  

I've been here a handful of times and only for their lunches!  They offer quite a few choices for lunch - $4.95 to $6.95, including rice!  All these dishes are served family-style, which makes it ideal for a group!

Highlights include their Braised Tofu, Salt and Pepper Pork Chops (although they could really cut them more so they aren't such huge pieces), Fried Flounder, Black Cod in Black Bean Sauce, various Chow Fun dishes, Chinese Broccoli in Oyster Sauce, Braised String Beans with XO Sauce, Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, East River Tofu in Clay Pot, etc.

The list goes on and you're bound to find something that you like on this menu! 

Service - like Elnino F. mentioned, there are some issues.  They really don't like giving out water.  On more than one occasion, I had to ask more than once for a glass of water.  Yes, they aren't making any money on the water but they should still provide it since you need something to wash all that food down and sometimes tea just doesn't cut it.

Overall, you really can't beat the price for quantity and quality at HK Star, especially for their lunch prices.  I briefly glanced at their regular menu, but what's the point?  Their lunch prices go for a pretty long time too!

Minimum $25 before you can use a credit card.  There's an ATM machine at the smoke shop in the same shopping center.  (On the left when you walk out of the restaurant.)

5050084,2010-08-15,2,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"Sorry, but after coming back a few times, our experiences get worse and worse that 2 star bump down is fair. 

Firstly,today there were flies. A lot of them bothering our food and we're trying to eat while waving them away. I eat with a bowl of rice in one hand and chopsticks in another- I don't have a spare hand to keep waving so I look like an idiot waving my rice bowl about. Take care of that shit because that's annoying and unappetizing. 

The UYE we got fairly decent service, but maybe it was a fluke or they knew we were reviewers so they tried to be on their best. When I came with my BF, we had to flag down for everything even though theres only 2 tables. Next two times with family, sometimes flags were ignored and we were held hostages waiting for the check and to-go boxes. The servers always look angry and don't seem very happy doing their job. They don't seem to be pleased when we ask for anything so I try to order everything at once, but that doesn't make a difference because they ignore you asked for things and only bring out items you paid for and not the condiments, or water or tea.  Refill request and simple things like asking for condiments or water was ignored even when asked repeatedly. We also were given forks only and also had been skipped in being given hot tea before...I'm assuming they think it's not for white people (Asian clientele had tea and chopsticks without asking). Other Chinese restaurants when in doubt usually ask. It seems that dinner/bigger spenders ordering the lobster specials and such are the friends that have gotten decent service so it probably is because they only care when you spend a lot. That's not how to run a resto- treat me nice when I have a big ticket, and then ignore me when I come for a lunch special. People talk and nothing is more loud than unhappy customers. 

Food that we get is good, but I don't think it's fantastic enough to say that it can overcome the pisspoor service and attitude. I'm going back to Food Express and Joyful House for Chinese/late night and lunch across the street at Wendy's Noodle Cafe. Wendy's is not only fantastic service, it's so pleasant that their smiles can cure a bad day. They're just as good food-wise and the three of them have actual service. 

My family is nice and still gave our standard 20% tip. I had half a mind to yank that off the tray and put it back in grandmas wallet. I rarely have felt we shouldn't tip at all....I normally leave a little bit, but I should've got their tip and bought myself dessert at Wendy's Noodle Cafe. 

I doubt that I will be going back here. If I do it's because someone insisted and I had enough notice to bring an obnoxious big neon foam ""sports"" hand to wave for service.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,2,2,iTqRCqU8iAfKXzSyFQV5Hg

My papa-in-law was obsessed (and that's putting it mildly) with having a Chinese banquet dinner. After being lured in by the enticing advertisements in the Chinese newspapers, there was simply no escaping the destiny of the 10-course extravaganza. We managed to convince him that the advertised pleasantries were not worth the risk as they were mostly from lower rated spots, but we headed to HK to appease and please. 

With this type of meal, you have no choice as to what you receive. They just bring out the courses, and they are largely seafood, limited vegetables. It's a feast after all, and green things are cheap. There was a plate of odd texture items that I don't eat, and then a soup, which honestly looked like dishwater, but it tasted okay.

5231814,2011-02-04,3,LJQCv30PCIpC3FnvHF5mXQ,"I went here today to celebrate Chinese New Year. I was with a group of Chinese folks so perhaps we got special treatment because the service wasn't bad at all. I find most asian restaurants have sub-par service, and this place just seemed average from a service standpoint to me. 

The food on the other hand was above average for a Chinese place. We ordered a smorgasboard of everything and most things I tried were light and fresh tasting rather than greasy. Additionally I didn't get sick from an MSG overload, so that's a great sign. 

I wish I knew the names of what we ordered, but I will admit some of the things were a bit too authentic for this adventurous eater. 

*Bright yellow chicken with the chicken's head on the plate. Hrm, I really didn't like my food staring at me while eating it. Hard to get used to that. I suppose putting a chicken head on the platter makes this place more legit, however. 

*Big blocks of tofu with ""bamboo fungus"" (I kid you not, this is how our Chinese hosts described this!). Looked and smelled pretty nasty, can't say I was even willing to try it as a tofu hater. 

*Beef chow fun noodles - awesome and way better than the ones at your standard chinese delivery place. 

*Fried pork chops - it's fried pork! Obviously amazing. Not as salty as the
ones at Anna's Garden.

*Seabass in a clay pot with tofu - the seabass was slimy and chewy, pretty nasty imo, but most of the people at our table were loving it.

*Honey walnut shrimp - one of my fave dishes and their's is well executed. 

*Fried squid (I'd call it calamari but not sure if the Chinese would use that word?). Phenomenal - not greasy, so light, and so tasty.

*Green beans - ok this sounds lame, but they do some amazing wok fry technique and use shrimp flakes or something and I can honestly say they were the tastiest green beans I've ever eaten. Green beans are my favorite veggie so I do eat them quite a bit. These were so freaking good I'm on a mission to replicate them somehow (as someone who has never cooked Asian food odds aren't in my favor!). 

Overall one of your better Chinese options in Chinatown. Service was decent, the food wasn't all that greasy or MSG-laden, and prices were fair for what you get. I particularly enjoyed the trippy Chinese karaoke videos they play while you eat. My favorite is the one with people in 80's clothes playing paddy-cake over a dead bird. I wish I could speak the language so I could understand what the hell was going on in that video!

Apparently they have been running a special that prints in the Vietnamese newspaper; party of 4 that spend more than $38 has an option of choosing between soy sauce duck or chicken, pnarty of 7 or more gets two free dishes. We did not inquire about what dishes because there was only four of us. By the time we finished ordering, we had surpassed the $38 mark and secured the duck. It is easy to ring up the bill.

We ended up with:
Hot & Sour Soup- It was unremarkable because it was neither spicy nor tangy. This soup is suppose to have very bold flavors and nothing really stood out.

Mandarin Pork Chops- Large meaty pieces in a balanced sauce. It was not too sweet nor tangy and was crispy.

Salt & Pepper Squid- This is my sister's favorite dish. It was golden brown and a generous portion. A little too salty for me, I ended up eating half a bowl of rice with each piece. 

Rock Cod in Black Bean Sauce- A family favorite and it did not disappoint.

Seafood Chow Fun- I have had better. A decent amount of fish fillets, scallops, squid, and shrimp.

Complimentary Duck- Came out on a bed of peanuts. It was delicious and surpassed our expectation. Definitely better than the soup and chow fun.

Complimentary Mung Bean and Tapioca Dessert- It is served warm and reminded my family of our favorite Vietnamese dessert. It is made in a similar fashion to the Vietnamese style as well. It is less soupy and thicker.

An A+++ for both the food and service!",cMts4uQI_MvF6Smk2erBLA,0,0,5,2yrfb-kjG37Lch4sQ9k4qw

It was an impromptu decision to get lunch here, since I was originally planning to go get dim sum with some classmates afterclass. But being the first week of school, things were hectic and things rarely goes according to plan.

Anyway, I figure since I was in the area taking care of errands, I will drive a few more blocks to try another new item on the HK Star lunch special menu. I have typically ordered the more expensive items, so decided I want to try something from the $4.95 portion of the menu.  Hong Kong Style Chow Fun sounds interesting, and I have never ordered it and would like to find out what exactly is HK Style Chow Fun.

When the waiter came, that was what I told him I wanted ""Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" (#8 on the $49.5 lunch special menu - okay I didn't say the #8 part of it).  He said theone with the gravy. I have never ordered it, so I said sure. He also wanted to confirm that I wanted Chow Fun, because on the menu the Chow Mein option is also available, and I said yes.  He looked a little confused to me, and I repeated the order again in Mandarin ""Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" and off he went to punch in the order in the POS.

Minutes later, a generous plate of chow fun with gravy and vegetables, shrimp, chicken and fish arrived.  I was hungy for the past 2 hours so I took a quick picture and dug in.  The food was delicious, and I was thinking this is a great deal for $4.95. I ate the entire plate of chow fun without being interrupted by the wait staff.  It wasn't until the very end when I have ate everything that the waiter who took me to the table brought over the check.

When I saw the bill, I realized the fantastic deal was a mistake, because they have made me ""House Pan Nood, sub Chow Fun"", which I interpretted as House Pan Friend Noodles made with Chow Fun and asking me for $6.51 for my lunch. I was annoyed enough to write a comment on the bill that I ""asked for Hong Kong Style Chow Fun"" and left my $7 for lunch. I figured besides taking my order wrong and delivering the food and provided no additional service, such as asking if everything was okay or if I needed more tea or water, that was what was earned.

So downgrading my rating to 4 stars solely on the poor listening skill, not knowing the menu and non-existent service.  I feel had I called my order ahead and the regular waiter took my order, I would have been given what I ordered. Or my experience today at HKS was due to being stuck with the crappy waiter that some other Yelper have complained about.  

Hopefully next time the ordering process will be better, and if I sense any confusion in the waiter repeating back my order, I will just have to point to it on the menu to make sure we are all on the same wavelength.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,4,4,2ugJtJAbIPANblKF6ewnHA

1) The food had a bit too much salt. If you don't like too much salt, ask your waiter to hold off on the salt. 
2) The waiters were not very attentive - too focused on their socializing among themselves.
My favourite dishes there included:
1) Mongolian Beef (a bit too many onions to my liking. Ask your waiter to hold off on the onions.
2) Garlic Chicken (dry) - too salty for my taste.
3) Filet minion beef with string beans (I substituted the string beans with bock choy)
4) Fresh seafood from the fish tanks (can become very expensive).",K5aw16gZzU5tZMOCkN-Hxw,0,0,4,GIES8Yg6312icj5wL2rxvg
