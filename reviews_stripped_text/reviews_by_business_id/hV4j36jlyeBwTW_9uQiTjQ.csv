1188040,2017-08-15,11,hV4j36jlyeBwTW_9uQiTjQ,"Who wants some fried chicken?!? I'm not much of a fried chicken person but I totally recommend this spot if you are looking for some good fried chicken this side of the valley.  We were in the area looking for a spot to eat to pass time while the teenager's phone was getting fixed and thankfully, Yelp led us here. 

The shop is located on Pecos and Sunset and was pretty easy to find. As soon as we walked in, the gentleman greeted us right away. Luckily, I already skimmed the menu on our way down, so we knew exactly what to get.  We decided to go with the Family Pack (cause well, I have a big family and my family can eat lol). The family pack comes with 18 pieces of chicken, 3 sides, and bread. The husband also decided to sneak in an order of shrimp as well. This was definitely enough for my family of six. 

So I'm a white meat kind of person and the husband gave me the breast right away. All I can say is that the chicken was moist and juicy and the skin had a nice crisp. Breast meat can be a bit more on the drier side, but not this one. It was juicy and seasoned well. Another plus is that the skin had such an amazing crisp to it.  I normally don't eat the skin, but this one...it was heaven! I love how the skin didn't have that oil taste in it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly. Their onion rings are pretty amazing as well. I liked how the entire onion didn't come out in my initial bite like other places. 

Overall, I would recommend this place for some good fried chicken. They do offer other items like hamburgers, ribs, seafood, etc. if you're not in the mood for chicken. Or just stick with the chicken, you won't regret it.",A36BF-rIbGExgnu1StJJiA,37,20,5,jH9V05M3wVuKMAK1Anrm5Q

Everyone loved the chicken. So much so that we've ordered there twice more for lunch on our Fridays. We always get the 21 piece mix. It's more than enough for the 10 or so people in our office but there's never leftovers.

1700739,2017-07-28,3,hV4j36jlyeBwTW_9uQiTjQ,"U.S Fried Chicken Halal For The Win! If you like your chicken moist, juicy, with crispy golden skin, then check out this new place!  It's right on the NE corner Sunset and Pecos.  Easy access parking in front and around the corner of the restaurant.

So why five stars off the bat: Because I came here two days in row!  I hardly do that! But really, here's 5 reasons.

1. Tastes Great!
Like I said above, moist, juicy, crispy and flavorful!  Spiced just right. Made to order. Consistent too! The two visits here and the 3 different orders of chicken were all made good!  Other places Ive been to, you've seen my reviews..problems with consistency.  Not here. Passed with flying colors!

2. Very Affordable!
2 pieces of chicken (Your choice of dark or white or mix) fries, soda $6.80!  Many menu items for an individual under ten bucks.  A family of 4 average  under $30.  So 5 stars for that!

3. Nicely rounded menu!
Chicken is their forte, but there's also burgers, beef ribs, seafood, gyros and Philly Cheese Steaks too! WOW!

4. I repeat...pretty inexpensive.
Five dollars for a double cheeseburger with fries....and the one I saw a customer ordered was a good sized one too.

5. Great atmosphere!
Family friendly, and just overall nice. Employees are very welcoming and genuinely friendly and truly appreciative for your business. The place is clean as well.

Fast/casual style...meaning you place and pay for your meal first.  If dining in, there's plenty of tables and 2 high tops. They'll call your name when your order is ready.

Orders came out pretty quick...so perfect place for those who work in the immediate area to grab lunch.

Their hours of operation are pretty convenient. Open seven days  week and open late evenings is a plus!

Just overall very good experience, and like other reviewers stated, best tasting fried chicken for this area, I agree!!",2EuPAGalYnP7eSxPgFCNDg,13,8,5,5PaXu0hQRUys6rALHCpKbg

The food was made fresh, delivered to us hot, and the taste was sooo flavorful and delicious. I have a lot of family who visit from out of state and this is one of the places that I will brag about to them and take them to.

I have visited Strip Restaurants, Downtown Restaurants and everything in between!  I read about U.S Fried Chicken Halal here on Yelp - and saw the great reviews.  I had to try it out for myself to see what all the fuss was about.

Upon entering we were promptly greeted and welcomed by the owner.  He asked if it was our first time and explained the menu.  He even provided us with a couple of samples!

I settled on the five piece meal with roll and side, and my brother chose the boneless spicy wings.  I tell you what..my fried chicken quest has ended.  Lightly breaded, juicy, seasoned perfectly and non greasy my chicken was insanely good!  The wings packed a punch and were really good.

They have other food options as well, but I would try the fried chicken first.  It took me back to family fried chicken dinners of my youth - that's definitely my highest bar to meet.

The Pros: The fried chicken is SUPER DELICIOUS and reasonably priced. 

The Cons: The restaurant itself is not a comfortable place to eat at. While maybe not overwhelmingly filthy in any specific way, it just comes off as feeling fairly uncomfortable.

The food here should leave you satisfied and full!   The portions were plentiful and the value is spot on.  The taste mimics some of the best shops back in NYC.  

My family and I walked in for the first time tonight and were warmly greeted by the staff.  We were offered a sample of their fried chicken before even ordering anything on the menu and that's some exceptional service right there.  The chicken is juicy and moist on the inside and has deliciously spiced crispy skin on the exterior.  

We opted for a 2-piece chicken combo with a roll and a side of mashed potatoes, a chicken gyro over rice plate, a beef gyro salad, and some chicken nuggets for the littles one.   Man, oh man.  We stuffed our stomachs and still had to box it all up for another meal or two at home.  

I wish I could truly express how happy I am to have a better gyro option nearby to me.  I'll probably end up making a stop here a couple times a month for sure.   

Definitely treat yourself to a beef or chicken gyro over rice if you are unsure of what to order.   It may be the best halal-style food you can consume on this side of the country!",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,7,8,5,INaYjVs50fZjs4iGfBMDUQ

I've warmed up their fried chicken in my toaster oven for breakfast, and it still tasted as good as the day before! I've also tried their chicken wings (original is better than the 'hot'), cheese-steak hoagie (excellent meat to bread ratio), bbq beef ribs (amazingly tender), chicken nuggets (way better than McD's), hamburger (freshly cooked, sizeable ground beef patty that I believe surpasses even In n Out!), and tilapia-whiting (delicious fish fry).

Abdul was friendly and check to see if needed anything multiple times.  A new batch of chicken is worth the 15 minute wait.

The restaurant is clean and you can view the cooking of the chicken in the enclosed frying vats.  Recommended for family dining.

I ordered off grub hub for a pick up/to go order. I had a taste for fried chicken and didn't know where to get any that would be good locally, so I decided to try this place based off the reviews. The food smelled great and I was pretty hungry so my daughters and I had to sit down and eat before going home. The employee who rang me up was very friendly and brought me the food covered with foil in a pan (I ordered 9 piece fried chicken and a side of fries.. costing approx $15 and they also have grub hub coupons for $10 off by the way). When I let him know we would be staying to dine in he brought me plates and forks and napkins right away as well as their sauces (ketchup standard buffalo and ranch) so I didn't use my to go ones he packed for us. The chicken was delish! Fresh & crispy! My daughters loved the shoestring fries and the chicken. They seemed happy the kids liked it so much and asked me if they did. (Incase they didn't notice my 3 and half year old scarfing down fries and 2 pieces of chicken) even the baby ate the food & im sure they'll eat more later. We had plenty of leftovers to bring home as well. As soon as customers left they cleaned the table immediately. Employees had gloves on and the place is pretty clean. The floors did have some scuffs and dirt marks tracked on them but that's probably normal from customers throughout the day, I did show up in the evening. I asked for water cups and was given some. Don't waste your money on crap like KFC. Come here for friendly and attentive service and good crispy fried chicken!",Iz1OjH-QHe-r9a7gm2sOLA,0,0,5,IrqDDo7DGKTEBezO-fORvQ

When I walked in, a man (presumably the owner) greeted me. He reviewed my options and we settled for an 8 piece value pack. However, the value pack still cost me $18 and that is with no drinks included. I found that to be way overpriced.  In any case, I asked if the chicken was fresh and the man told me that they just took it out of the fryer/oven.  While waiting for them to prepare my meal, I noticed the menu board. The menu board looked like it was from 1980. I couldn't believe a new restaurant has such an old menu board. A few minutes later, the food was brought to our table.  I started out and tried the potato wedges. They were delicious! Next I tried the onion rings. They were ok!  Finally I took a chicken leg and bit into it. Ugh. The breading tasted burnt/smoky. I finished out that piece and tried another one. Same thing, it tasted burnt. The perplexing thing is that the chicken didn't look burnt.  I had about 3 pieces and my wife had 1  Finally when we were leaving, I was asked how things were and I told the man about my experience. He apologized and said that next time it would be better. I'm not sure if there will be a next time. As I said, the prices were very high and the food wasn't that good.  When I came home, I ate the rest of the chicken and surprisingly, it tasted a little better.

I really can't argue with the 4 and 5 Star Reviews for U.S Fried Chicken Halal.  The fried chicken here is delicious.  For only $5.50, I got the 2 pc.

They also serve burgers, fish & chicken sandwiches, Gyros, ribs, a California burrito, and seafood options like white fish, shrimp, and fish & chips.  There's so much on the menu that it can be overwhelming if you're undecided.  But that's a good thing, right?

All the food is Halal as it says in the name, and it's expanding the Halal options in Henderson which is really great.

The serving sizes are pretty generous for the price. We ordered the hot wings, 2pc chicken w/ a roll, and the Italian hot dog. By far, the hot wings are my favorite but the regular 2 pc chicken is a close second. The hot wings don't have any sauce so the flavor comes from the dry rub which is a classic vinegar flavor. The chicken for both dishes were juicy and not overly greasy. There was a lot of flavor in the wings, so I was a pretty happy camper. The only downside was that my 2pc chicken was a little over-fried so it started to taste a little overdone, but the hot wings really brought it back.

The price point for the wings are very reasonable, and it's a plus that it's Halal as well.

We looked at the menu prior to getting there and my dad was suspicious that the beef ribs would be bare bones with very little meat, but he was surprised when he actually got more meat than bones! 

I personally tried the cheeseburger and the 2 piece chicken (with fries/onion rings) on the side - and I was full after the burger. The proportions are more than enough, and they supply you with condiments upon request. Like other reviewers have commented, the fried chicken is possibly the BEST - because it's NOT GREASY and oiled but it's still crispy enough to enjoy that KFC taste that many of us can't have. 

The beef ribs were warm and possibly eaten the quickest, since no one really likes to eat cold ribs. The person who took our order was super nice and mannered, which is incredibly hard to find at some newer places. He was also patient when we were deciding what to order.

4699468,2017-08-06,3,hV4j36jlyeBwTW_9uQiTjQ,"Excellent fried chicken with excellent customer service. Saw a review from a fellow Yelper and decided to give this place a try. I was greeted right away and upon seeing me undecided, the young gentleman offered me a free fried chicken leg for free just so I could try it! What a surprise! The chicken was not greasy at all, but it was crispy and juicy! Sold! I now dream of their hot crispy fried chicken for lunch when at work, but luckily it is on my way home so I can get it for dinner in the evenings. The thing about fried chicken is that it is so easy to cover up it a heavy batter and season it to death, but not here. Their chicken has a good crispy crust, but light enough where you get to the moist and juicy meat on the inside. The seasoning is not too salty, not peppery, just really well seasoned. They have a good menu selection of mixed chicken platters that include fries and some have a dinner roll with it too. 

You can just get the chicken without the fries like I do if you want. My reasoning is that I can eat more chicken lol. I have also tried their burgers which are made to order too. The burger was juicy and the cheese was good s melty. For sides and desserts, I have tried their potato salad and banana pudding. I like the bsna pudding a lot as it wasn't too sweet and had real bananas in it. The potato salad was ok. It didn't have too much mustard or mayo which I like, but it was decent for a side. They also have slices if bundt cakes and macoroni salads which I have yet to try. Condiments are available upon request. I usually ask for ranch and ketchup on the side to go.

All in all, this is definitely my go to spot for fried chicken now. Besides the yummy chicken cooked to perfection, the customer service is outstanding. They check on how you are doing, make sure the food was good and to your liking, are fast and are professional. Not too many places that have those attributes, but they do. So if your running a fever for some good fried chicken give this place a try!",yyDp7MZ2st7p0fOQuFYpcA,12,7,5,tNsy0bq8HsrkncKH6oYRRA

I was in the area getting my car repair so I decided to give it a try.  So glad I did!  I got the two piece box to go.  I asked for a leg and thigh.  No problem.  Lots of choices for the side.  I picked fries.  I told server I lived a good twenty minutes away and would everything reheat well.  He said fine.  I noticed they made fresh fries.  When I got home food was still hot enough.  Didn't need to heat.  Chicken was great!  Crispy, juicy and flavorful.  Skin not too thick, almost lite.  I have been known to take off greasy heavy skin but not this chicken!  The fries were perfect.  Crispy and soft inside.  Hawaiian roll yummy as well.

Found them on yelp went in on a weeknight, only ones inside.  Shortly after we started to order another family came in.  We finished ordering $48.00 worth of food, and sat down to wait.  The family behind us ordered and did the same.  The husband of the other family spoke to the owners quit a bit.  They are of Middle Eastern decent but not from Pakistan as the owners said they were, so they didn't speak the same language.  However, the husband of the other family stood at the counter speaking to them for a while, while we all waited for our food.  

My order was ready first, the gyro over rice.  The owner lifted up the tray over the glass tops off the counter which meant he had to almost lift the tray up and over his head, and I stood up to walk over and reach to get it.  Not a big deal right?  However, the man from the other family finally sat down right about the time my order started coming out.  The other families burgers were ready before our chicken wings were and the owner walked the other families food to their table and asked them if they needed anything else.  Finally, when the rest of our order was ready he did the same thing to us again and called us to come reach up and get our trays.  This wouldn't be a big deal if I hadn't seen what he just did to the other table.  To make things worse he brought them a complimentary plate of fried chicken to try since they only ordered hamburgers.  His prerogative, but showing favoritism in front of other customers kind of sucks.  Just saying, but if this had been the other way around and it was an all white store who did that discriminating against a Middle Eastern family it would be racist.  I guess since  I am Caucasian it didn't matter. 

I also had to ask for the macaroni and cheese, and bread that was sitting on the counter that he forgot to give us. 

Will I come back, no, will I tell you what I thought of food, no, because it doesn't matter. I felt embarrassed having to go get my tray when the ""MAN"" of the other family had it brought to his table like a King.",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,9,0,3,oRm8SqJ4qvAQwVX2Az3u0w

The chicken skin was crisp and it had decent flavor. It wasn't seasoned with the normal spices that you would associate with fried chicken but it was ok. The meat of the chicken tasted like any other fried chicken. The fries that my wife ordered had great texture but it had a different kind of spice on it instead of just salt that we just didn't like. The rolls that came with the meal looked like it was bought from vons. The coleslaw was made with some creamy sauce. Not my favorite.

I was also disappointed with the menu. There are 2 similar items on the menu. They both have 3 pieces of chicken but one comes with a drink and fries for $7.50 and the other comes with a roll and your choice of sides for $6.50.

Walking in, we were immediately greeted and warmly welcomed. The guy asked if it was our first time coming in, to which I replied that it was. He handed us all menus and turned around to the fried chicken that they have ready in the case. He put a few pieces on a plate and handed it to us, telling us to have a seat, try the wings, and decide on what we'd like for lunch. Talk about some amazing service...and this was just in the first five minutes of our arrival!!

I really, really appreciated the fact that he gave us a sample of their chicken. It was really good and we all ultimately chose chicken tenders and chicken nuggets. The nuggets seemed to be ready-made, but those tenders...let me tell you...those delicious, juicy little morsels were absolutely fresh! You could tell that those were not straight out of a box. Those were freshly tossed in batter and fried! The guy brought over their cucumber ranch sauce, hot sauce, and ketchup. If I could rob them of all their cucumber ranch sauce, I'd gladly sit in jail...that's how good that shit was! I HATE ranch dressing. My parents burned us out on that as kids because that's all they bought. I rarely eat it now, and only with a few fries, until I can't stand it anymore. Their cucumber ranch though....I swear I wanted to stick the bottle down my shirt and walk out of there. It tasted delicious dipping the tenders or nuggets in there, as well as on salad! 

In addition to the tenders, fried chicken, and nuggets, they also have hot wings,beef ribs, various shrimp platters, whiting and tilapia, fresh salads, and several burgers and sandwiches. They also have sides like mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and macaroni and cheese, as well as desserts like cheesecake, carrot cake, and chocolate cake.
