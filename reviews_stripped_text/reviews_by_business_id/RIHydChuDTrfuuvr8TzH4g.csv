If it's a straight cup of coffee that you're looking for, headed down the hall to Johnny Rockets. You'll find they have decent coffee at a decent price, and you get free refills, and there's never a even a line.",cex2ZL2lbWUIG7ISHHB0Wg,1,0,1,W4hr9LDwzlVuApmvxrbabw

While staying at the Excalibur, I found it noteworthy that Castle Coffee is found at the elevators leading to the rooms in both Tower 1 and in Tower 2 (on opposite sides of the casino floor). It makes sense they would place these here since there were no in-room coffee makers. We felt lucky to even have a blow dryer in the rooms given their state. 

We only visited Tower 2 Castle Coffee, but I imagine there isn't much of a difference.  More than just coffee is sold here. They have breakfast items and packaged mixed salads. They aren't open very late but there is a Starbucks upstairs in the food court.",1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg,3,4,4,poPvHhh8WxFv5BqAEjFHgw

I made the mistake of standing in line here the first morning in anticipation of some delicious coffee.  The line took FOREVER since there was only one lady working.  They had specialty drinks, regular coffee, and pastries.  The regular coffee was HORRIBLE.  I couldn't even drink it.  Not worth the time or the money.  Trust me when I say make the walk to Starbucks (there are two locations in Excalibur).  You'll save yourself some time and you'll get coffee you can actually drink.",CnT1mtEAoVAMUUku_J_huA,0,0,1,XDRlINMcNnDoZhSwHtFo0Q
