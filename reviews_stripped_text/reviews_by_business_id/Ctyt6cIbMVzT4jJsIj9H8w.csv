It's nice to have fresh produce at such a great price. I finally have access to my gluten free donuts (yes, you heared that right!) without the treck to the Lake Mead store. My spot is definitely the vitamin section. Sprouts branded essential oils are a great bargain and benefit. Knowledgeable expert on hand ready to help, too.

Paid something in the neighborhood of $14 a pound, which was a $2 surcharge over the regular beef, because of the ""Grass fed"". They didn't look too great to start with, but the regular steaks looked worse. Spent $40 on steaks and cooked all of them the way we always do, medium rare, with a nice char on the outside. Terrible terrible cut of meat. So tough we could barely chew them. Horrid. Threw every ounce in the trash. Do not buy the grass fed beef. Worst steak we've ever purchased. 
It's a shame because it seems Sprouts, with all of their healthy food and huge butcher department, would also carry quality meats. Nope.",Bfe564xSYnjvpfxknA4g8A,0,0,1,KcR9te8rFwX3eoLnS7vuKw

1404611,2018-02-14,0,Ctyt6cIbMVzT4jJsIj9H8w,"Thank you, Sprouts, for finding your way out to northwest Las Vegas. We are glad to finally have a store with healthy, ethically-produced, and reasonably priced foods in the neighborhood. 

The store is clean and the employees are helpful--especially those in the meat department. I've had several Sprouts butchers move behind the counter to help me find humanely-raised meats, explaining each option until I thoroughly understood. In addition, at this and other Sprouts stores, I've never had trouble finding a person to help me find a product.

The fruits and vegetables are fresh (they offer both regular and organically-grown options), the meats are varied and from respected farms, the bulk bins are numerous, full, clean, and varied, the bread selection focuses on specialty breads (e.g., Ezekiel 4:9 bread), the vitamin section is huge, and the main grocery area has many hard-to-find items. The store also offers good weekly discounts.

This is not the place to go if you're looking for canned fruits and vegetables, boxed dinners, or ingredients you can't pronounce. Because Sprouts prices are lower than those of similar stores, it is the best alternative for healthy grocery shopping.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,1,0,5,xzB7e_VyjKjei0R7RSthqw

But that damn vibe wanted to me check out everything this location had to offer.  I fought the urge and stayed narrowly focused to my task.  Brussel sprouts...check.  I remember from a previous visit at another location that the produce is very, very fresh.  This location provided the same experience.  Bulk lightly mixed nuts.....check.

They mostly sell natural and organic products although not all of their stuff is organic. Their produce and meat is always fresh and of great quality. They have competitive weekly sales which makes most of their products (especially produce) an equal or lesser price than their local/nearby competitors.

My wife and I love their rotissiere chicken, snack boxes and other ready to eat foods. Makes for convenient, healthy snacks or quick meals!

IT IS AMAZING!!! They have a large bulk foods section that has anything from lentils to chocolate covered espresso beans. A great way to try new grains, nuts, and spices without having to commit to buying a whole package.

2395737,2017-10-18,0,Ctyt6cIbMVzT4jJsIj9H8w,"Meh. I was pretty excited to see this store open. I'd never been to a Sprouts and I've been missing the convenience of Fresh and Easy since it closed. Since it opened I've been in a few times. They do have a really nice produce section as well as a variety of things you might not find at regular stores (special vitamins, essential oils etc.). Unfortunately they don't have a lot of things on my grocery list and every time I've gone in, I end up having to still run into Albertsons across the street to pick up things they didn't have. Some of their prices are really good and other things are priced super high. For example, I think that regular Dryer's ice cream was $5.99 the last time I was there whereas you can get it at the regular store for $2.99 on sale. Because it's a smaller store, there isn't a lot of selection either. Like with the ice cream example, let's say you go to Albertsons (or Smiths or Vons) and the Dryers is not on sale - you can usually find a generic or another brand that is a cheap price. Not so here. I just could't bring myself to pay $6 for a small carton of ice cream and every other brand was just as expensive. Similar experience with butter. Every type was way over-priced. Like double what I normally pay. The Sprouts brand was the only one that was priced half way decently (still more than I usually pay) but they were all out. They were out of several brands of milk as well and a few that I picked up expired on the day I was shopping. Last time I was there I was in the mood for some bagged salad- just the crappy iceburg kind, but every bag of it looked brown. The first couple times I went in, the employees were super friendly and helpful. The last time I went in, I dealt with an off shift employee still in her uniform shopping with her husband and rudely pushing her way around the store, cutting me off etc. and when I got in line, the cashier was busy talking to another employee as was the bagger (they had 2 different conversations going on). I felt like I was disturbing them by being there. Neither said a word to me during the whole transaction. At any rate, I just feel as though this store didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it. I might drop in if I'm only needing one or two items and I need to get in and out fast, but it will not be where I do my regular shopping for sure.",aPXpM_OsjPiQLnCEsawMoQ,0,0,3,QTbxvmOaHGgqIxs6WWdoUA

Always a pleasure to visit as it's not really crowded mid morning and the employees are friendly and helpful. Love all the fresh produce and the deli counter serves the Boarshead meats. Meats are always fresh. Prices are great especially when they have their sales. The only reason I didn't give five stars is that leaving the store is kind of a hassle having to across a large street and can't make a u turn at the signal so I either have to cut across the Lowe's parking lot to get back home or the other option is to go down farm and turn into the Albertsons parking lot and cut across. They haven't put the signal on Farm into operation yet. There is always someone to help if you have questions regarding supplements, vitamins or anything in regards to their health products. Always a great place to stop for a little gift or food speciality item for a party. My hubby and I usually stop by at least once a week for a freshly made cold cut sandwich.

There is SO MUCH more parking that the Centennial Hills TJ's! I know that a lot of the retail spaces aren't open in this shopping center yet so it may be early to judge, but I am holding onto my hope that the parking stays decent. 
Sprouts has an awesome selection of food and other goods. We have stopped in a few times and last night I was able to snag some natural deodorant and hairspray. I was thrilled-it was much cheaper than shopping online and they had a HUGE selection of deodorants to choose from. 
They have plenty of single-serve cold drinks and ready-to-heat meals. They have a pretty vast candy selection-but they don't have the bulk salt water taffy! A travesty! 
We have had positive interactions with the staff on all of our visits, and they all seem happy to be at work and eager to help.

3737444,2017-12-28,6,Ctyt6cIbMVzT4jJsIj9H8w,"I'm a sucker for a good grocery store! Eating healthy and purchasing healthful ingredients, i.e., organic veggies, organic fruits, grass-fed/organic/free range eggs, is an expense I am willing to absorb. I thank heaven for grocers like Sprouts (and Trader Joe's) that help me keep my budget in check.
 
I was ecstatic to learn that a Spouts was coming closer to home in the Northwest area. Sprouts always have lots of items on sale every week (hello buy-one-get-one sales and monthly deals)! Their produce and fruit quality are on par with other high-end grocers - I always judge a supermarket on their unique offerings and product (quality meats and produce are important). They offer loads and loads of healthy, vegan items, gluten-free items, GMO-free items, and red/white wine. Their coffee (walk down this aisle, and you will get to sample different blends on your visit), frozen products w/o the junk, quality cuts of meat (vegetarian fed/organic, etc.), bulk items are fantastic, and I am barely scratching the surface here.
 
Overall, Sprouts is mini 'Whole Foods' that is easy on your wallet. What's not to love there? I still frequent Trader Joe's and Costco. However, I still do majority of my grocery shopping here. 
 
Hot Tips:
 
Vitamins/Body Product Selection: There vitamin/health conscious bath and beauty products selection is out of this world! There is always an employee to help you and answer any questions you may have. We recently purchased some Alaffia - Authentic African Black soup for my husband's eczema and it seems to be helping with is dry skin, and it was on sale--score!
 
Salad Bar/Deli: If you are looking for a fresh sandwich or salad bar, come here to grab some grub. We have been here a handful of times to just to eat. They have deli sliced meats and cheese for you to take home if you are looking for it to be ultra fresh! They do have a fair share of grab n' go items for healthy eats on the run (rotisserie chickens, sandwiches, salads, soups, and plenty of heat n' serve options).
 
Catering/Holiday Meals: I ordered a precooked, heat n' serve Thanksgiving meal for two this past Thanksgiving. It saved on the cooking, and it tasted good and was roughly $30 bucks - which is a steal! They have catering trays of deli meat and cheese, veggie trays, fruit trays, and sandwich trays you can order if you're hosting an event. They even have prime rib you may order - easy.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,12,8,5,lyL4LZM5GbnmE22vz4Pd8Q

Pretty much everything you need or find at a Sprouts near you, this is just the same. 

I did notice one thing! When I approached their deli because I wanted to buy a sandwich, someone working towards the back was doing their job by constantly looking up. I was immediately greeted then asked if I needed help, which I extremely appreciated! I've visited the deli at the Lake Mead location and I swear tis as if no one works back there. Grrr.

Obviously having just opened...it is going to be clean, it is going to feel fresh and new in there, and customer service will be on point. Let's just hope management enforces consistency because that seems like a lost word in the customer service world amongst businesses. Consistency is important! So I hope they consistently keep up with the customer service.
