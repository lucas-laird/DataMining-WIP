 I was disappointed by the customer service. I will pay extra if the customer service is good. The men at the location were courteous and polite, the woman however, was rude and seemed to be very unhappy working there.

1540713,2015-09-03,11,I5TnTKHzJuLA0YLZPGCNwQ,"Came here for a late lunch. This place is located next to Albertson's in a small shopping center. 

Hubby saw the special which was $3.99 for the teriyaki bowl, drink not included. We got three orders of the teriyaki bowl, one drink and one mango boba. I didn't know they sold boba drinks. The mango slush with boba was good. Boba tasted sweet. My daughter even liked it even though she normally doesn't. 

After the lady took our order, we took a seat at a table. Place was small and had air conditioning inside. You check in on Yelp and get six pieces of potstickers for free. I forgot to claim it but hubby did. Yum! Teriyaki bowl was good. It had pieces of chicken, sliced up carrots, cabbage, and broccoli. They didn't drench too much sauce which is how I like it. Rice was perfectly cooked. Perfect meal. The mango boba was good. I could taste pieces of fresh mango in my slush. I loved the taste of mango. 

As we ate our food, we hear music in the background. Definitely a great mix of music. They were playing ""How you remind me"" by Nickelback. I found myself singing along. LOL! Hope no one heard me. It was a mix of old and new school. I liked the vibe in here.

Now they no longer give discount to gym members. Portion sizes are about half of what they used to be. Service is worse than the Shell station employees down the street. On top of all that - the last two times I went there to pick up a to go order, they were missing extra chicken we had paid for and gave us white rice instead of brown rice that we ordered.

I was excited seeing this place since all food options were healthy. My sister and I shared a Large Teriyaki Bowl with brown rice and vegetables and it was so tasty and filling. I bought my boyfriend the Big Boy Bowl which had both steak and chicken breast on top of brown rice and vegetables as well which he loved as well. There are also dark meat or white meat and rice or no rice plates options which are cool since pricing is different for all options. Don't forget to get your free potstickers for checking in to yelp! They were delicious!

For our drink we shared a strawberry protein shake and strawberry boba. I recommend the protein shake but not the boba since it was so sweet and the boba was hard. =T

There is nothing over $10 which makes everything nearly affordable and with the $7 for $14 Groupon it makes Teriyaki Boy very affordable.  I like the low carb chicken bowl because of the healthy chicken and veggie servings but that's being most effective when it comes to your health and post workout diet.  

Bottom line, know there's a Groupon deal out there and take advantage of it.  The healthy options here I feel beats out the other two ""teriyaki"" places nearby.  I don't get the sauce at all or if I do I get it on the side and apply it myself.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,7,8,4,D5jLS5xZ1XyNAPKQK5a7SA
4054648,2013-03-13,7,I5TnTKHzJuLA0YLZPGCNwQ,"Teriyaki Boy is one smart business.  Located smack in between LVAC and a nutrition store.  Where else do people from LVAC go for their post workout?  They should come here, especially since your anabolic window is about an hour after your workout.  

I still remember when this location use to be Bonzai Bob's.  They have since shut their doors and Teriyaki Boy took over.  Teriyaki Boy still has the same line up and even supports ex-Mr. O Jay Cutler like Bonzai Bob's use to do.  I was a fan when it was Bonzai Bob's and a fan now even though it's changed to Teriyaki Boy.  I've tried their steaks, chicken, and salmon bowls.  Everything I've tried has tasted fresh and flavorful.  But it's their brown rice that tastes amazing.  If you come here and get a bowl, try it will brown rice.  For some reason, it brings the flavor out of their meats.  My most recent meal was their salmon wrap w/extra meat.  This was good, not as good as their steak or chicken bowls, but good enough to sustain me for a few hours.  All their meals are price low. The most expensive item on the menu is currently $9.40.  But keep in mind that these prices are for their larger.  If you got your big boy pants on or need that extra extra protein, go for the Cutler Bowl which is about 48 oz of food (over 12 oz of meat). It will cost additional to go huge on their meals, but well worth it.  Plus, it's perfect for the next day's packed lunch or baon (for all you Pinoys). For an even better deal, try their ""Weekly Meal Plan"".  This will save you about $2 on each bowl, but this also means the same meal all week long which can be boring.  

To some, T-Boys is just another Teriyaki Madness or Samurai Sams.  Both taste and prices are similar.  But it's way more affordable than Greens & Protein when it comes to their chicken, steak, and salmon.  If you're hungry and looking for something on the healthier side, give T-Boys a try.  My suggestion...go big and get their Cutler Bowl.  


PS:  There is a table reserved for Jay Cutler.  I didn't know who he was or how big of a deal he was until the day I was sitting in his chair.  Yes...he walked in and everyone gave me the look.  I got the ""you better get out of his seat"" type look.  This was a while back during the Bonzai Bob days, but they say he still frequents this place.  My advice, stay out of his seat!!!",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,7,4,cu4WnneFsbwqXUUKTEGhqQ
4074418,2014-04-10,0,I5TnTKHzJuLA0YLZPGCNwQ,"I visited Teriyaki Boy for the first time recently after hearing people talk about their low carb bowls. I'm a low carber and it's so hard to find places around town that understand my lifestyle. When I walked in there were lots of big, beefy guys from the gym next door waiting to order big protein bowls -- always a good sign! 

I ordered a shrimp low carb bowl with broccoli instead of rice. I loved that the cooks wok your food fresh to order right in front of you. The quality of the broccoli and shrimp was good too. I had two minor problems with this place -- one, the teriyaki sauce tasted really sweet, making me worry about too much added sugar; and two, the portion size was pretty small. I need to eat a LOT to get full since I don't eat carbs. When you start adding extra meat here and there, your meal price can quickly grow out of control. 

I'd go back here but only if I was in the neighborhood and needed a quick, light meal. It's not something I'd crave and drive out of my way to eat. The restaurant was very clean and I had fast and friendly service.

I visited Teriyaki Boy tonight around 7:35 pm (05/23/2018). While standing at the front counter, I watched the cook wipe the sweat from his forehead, then reached into the vegetables and placed them in the wok. WHAT THE HECK!!?????!! I could not believe what I had just witnessed. He did not even wipe the sweat on his pants. Just palm of hand to forehead, then leaned right over and grabbed the cucumbers with both hands. Eewwww.......Sure way to contract Hepatitis. So, I immediately informed the cashier of what I had just witnessed, and her response was ""Ok, I'm busy right now with customers."" I am appalled. You would think that something so important would warrant a quick verbal with the employee to wash his hands, and to be mindful of his actions. But no, she just continued right on. So, as I sat and watched and waited disgustingly (for her to tell the cook to wash his hands), she said nothing. He continued to touch veggies and cook. :-( So, I said ma'am, this is a health hazard, and if you are not going to inform him, I will need to report this to your management, I then asked her for her name, as neither of them were wearing name tags, and she shook her head ""No"". She just refused to give me her name. She then replied, go ahead and do what you want to do. Can we say unprofessional! This was the first time I had ever been serviced by the young lady, and the first time I had ever seen this cook. So i'm assuming they have not been around very long, or maybe my timing has just always been right. So the moral to this story is, Teriyaki Boy Management, take notice. They are a potential loss to your establishment, a certain risk management issue, and the young lady, she totally brings down the sense of professionalism and good spirit that I am used to observing at this restaurant. She should treat all customers with respect and address any hazardous issues immediately.",aFTNjRbupSC6ytbtzfMIHg,0,0,1,gMOVwm_d74QOICuVXGHesQ

4558372,2013-05-30,0,I5TnTKHzJuLA0YLZPGCNwQ,"Man, I love teriyaki chicken. I think it should be a food group unto itself. It certainly would merit it in my case, as it's part of my food pyramid. For me, it goes (starting from the bottom): steak, burgers, pizza, teriyaki, sushi. That's the pyramid, and teriyaki is in a good spot, I think. Having said that, why just the three stars? Well...

Because this place is right outside the LVAC I (sometimes) go to, I only ever come here after a workout when I'm starving and don't feel like paying $7 for a smoothie. Every single time I've come in here, I've ordered the same thing: yaki soba with teriyaki beef and veggies, sauce on the side. I have no idea what anything else tastes like, but keep in mind I feel this makes me an expert on this particular dish. So this review is pretty much based on that one dish, plus the one time my brother said he ate there and he liked it. 

Ultimately, it comes down to the noodles on this dish. The steak is almost always great, as are the veggies (but I hope you like a ton of broccoli and not enough anything else...) but the noodles are not the best. They always taste the way Panda Express chow mein tastes after I've left it sitting out for a few hours and then get back to it between episodes of Arrested Development. It doesn't taste fresh, but it's not that bad. It tastes like three stars. It tastes like ""I come here because it's the best choice without having to move my car"" or ""man I am starving and this is better than getting KFC on the way home.""

While I come back? Certainly. I am a creature of habit and comfort, and both apply to this place.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,0,0,3,tCVnH-HOuZkTGA1ySVATEw

Music? I liked it, typical pop, but blasting so loud that they should install a disco ball. You have to scream to have a conversation. The workers can't hear over it, either,  and thus screw up your order. Plus, they will stand at the counter and yell ""ma'am"" over and over until someone standing close enough to hear them will come get you. Never mind that they could have simply taken the three steps over to hand it to you. 

I'm dying laughing at all the people calling this place healthy. I'd call it healthy-esque, at best. You really have to be on your toes to keep it clean. The teriyaki sauce is pure sugar, and they only offer ""lite"" soy sauce, no low sodium or gluten free. Noodles and rice? Really? Boba in artificial flavors so sweet it'll make your heart race. I had to throw mine away. Ask for sauces on the side, then babysit the cook. She'll give you none at all, then when you ask for it - again - on the side, she'll splort half a cup of it all over your food! 

Something they do do right: veggies. Those saying the vegetables were undercooked apparently don't know what veggies are supposed to taste like. These were perfect. 

The place is roomy and clean. Food is ok. I make better at home, frankly. Service not so ok. Wish I knew about the low carb options before ordering. Of course, it would make for a very dry meat dish, since the sauces aren't anything a low carber could touch.

Completely lost my appetite and at that point decided I will never eat there nor suggest this place.  Sucks that even with attempting to copy Bonzai Bobs they did an unbelievably disgraceful job.",CbzG0CZn_RZyP-zPyRNApQ,0,0,1,HNqT43bz6jCO8x_1jCtkzg

The b/f says this is where Jay Cutler has his own bowl, and sure enough, there's a picture of the former Mr. Olympia on the counter and his own big teriyaki chicken bowl--buff!  We only wanted plain chicken breast with no sauce, no rice, and some plain broccoli and the folks behind the counter were very accommodating; this location is right next to LVAC, so they're probably used to such requests.  If you're into eating clean, which can mean boring at times, this place can hook you up.  It's also super clean as an eating establishment--the employees were mopping and cleaning when we walked in and kept on after they served us.  They have boba on the menu, too, but it's not on our diet these days; too bad, so sad for us.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,5,4,chy3o-yIFCNfbVq0oL1mfA

Went today 10-30-15 at noon for lunch take-out.  I ordered online and then paid when I got there. It took me 9 minutes to get there and the cashier said she *just* got my order.  So plan accordingly.  

$17.94 got me a mahi-mahi teriyaki bowl and two smoothies.  When I got back to work and opened up the teriyaki bowl I noticed that the mahi-mahi looked and tasted a whooooooole lot like salmon.  Something fishy is going on here.  *snickers*  

I enjoyed my first taro smoothie today!  It's pretty good...reminds me a lot of Ube ice cream.  The boba at the bottom were hot...I think they just cooked them.  

The teriyaki bowl was meh.  Tasted really healthy.  If I was watching what I eat this would probably taste wonderful but as a fatty it was very....meh.  I got bored and depressed halfway through it and put it in the fridge ""for later"" which is code word for ""I feel guilty putting this in the trash so I'll put it in the fridge and then throw it away when it starts growing fur.""  

Very nutritious and I'd definitely go back here if I ever went on a diet or if Jay Cutler invited me.  One time I went to the BX on Nellis AFB and Jay was there signing autographs.  I got his autograph and took my picture with him.  He was kind of a jerk.  He didn't look at me or say anything he just posed for the picture and then turned back around.  Now I understand why he was so sad...because he has to eat food like this every day.  I bet if you fed him chili cheese fries he'd be nicer.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,6,2,3,Gxck2gRfWftU8iZraqgqMA

Clean, reasonably priced and convenient makes this a good spot for a quick bite on the go. The menu is pretty straight forward, but I prefer anything else but their yakisoba noodles, which I found to be rather bland tasting.

Beef is better than their Chicken, which is still pretty good.
Wrap is preferred over their Rice, both of which are way better than their Yakisoba.

Staff was friendly and greets you as you enter and leave the premise. It is such a trivial thing, but makes a big difference.  Good job!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,4,zsmxecGZFAbvX8HPX6K20A
