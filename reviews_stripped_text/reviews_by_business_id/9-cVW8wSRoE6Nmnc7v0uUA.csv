The pantry's 24 hour service makes it the perfect place to get your fix, whether it's breakfast or dinner; all of the food is deliciously Vegas, yet still affordably priced.

My husband and I have eaten here on more than one occasion only to receive the same, consistent service that leaves us wanting to come back.
We've tried most of the menu so far as, usually ordering half in a sitting as our ""spoils"" meal- each bite is perfectly cooked and portioned as well as creatively presented to match it's homey atmosphere.

On this recent trip our server was Janel. She was extremely attentive. Extremely:
1: We were able to receive happy hours prices just as they were ending with her help.

2: She was friendly, bubbly and reached our table in a timely manner- never too much or too little, leaving all our requests met...

3: even the last minute order change was not a problem for her to fix for us.

If you get the chance, check out the pantry.
And if the wonderful Janel is working, make sure to request her- by all means.",OySRTbbgYgURPtAJefAZew,0,0,5,UzSFszOSMzEsVbW9cS01sA

367995,2016-07-06,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"Horrible experience. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E. My sister and I came here the first night of our stay to grab a bite before going to bed. We were seated and the busperson came to collect our drink orders -- a water and a club soda. The water comes along with the menus then the waitress comes almost immediately to collect our orders. Of course we aren't ready because we just received menus so ask for a couple of minutes. Then we wait. And wait. The club soda comes (it only took 15 minutes to make). Then we wait. And wait. I flag down the waitress from across the restaurant. She motions that she's coming in a minute. Mind you, the restaurant is only 1/3 full and most of the tables already had food when we arrived. Furthermore, the waitress only had 3 other tables aside from ours, of which 2 had already eaten. But she was frazzled so couldn't take our order. And every other employee disappeared from the floor so we couldn't even ask someone else about our waitress's whereabouts. So we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally the busperson comes out so we ask her to please find our waitress so we can order. She says, ""Ok,"" but then keeps clearing tables. So we wait. And wait. And wait. The busperson sees we are irritable so eventually goes to the waitress to let her know we're waiting. At this point, it has been 10-15 minutes since we asked the busperson to get the waitress and about 45 minutes total since we've been waiting. (As an aside, if it had not been 12:30am and other places were open, we never would have waited that long to begin.) So she comes and we order the 'Wings 2 Ways' and regular fries. That's it. Just wings and fries. Then someone walks in and flags her down and she starts taking his order at the door before he's ever seated by the hostess. Five minutes pass before she goes to put in the order. After another 15 minutes the FOH manager brings out the wings and asks if we need ""more plates"". Sir, we never received plates to begin with. So he tells the waitress and she drops them on our table without a word and hurries away. Okay. So we don't have the fries but maybe they're coming. So we wait. And wait. And wait some more. We ask the busperson to get the manager. She says okay then goes to clean tables. After about 7 minutes our waitress comes out the back and the busperson tells us we want a manager. So the waitress comes to ask if we need anything else -- yes, a manager (and the fries you never brought but that's a dead issue at this point). She says, ""Ok,""...but then walks off to start checking her tables on the computer. Then she starts talking to another customer...then she starts talking to coworkers. So my sister gets up to go ask the bartender if he can get a manager. He says okay then turns back to cleaning. We ended up having to wait for the manager to come out to talk to someone else before we could flag him down to make a complaint. He gave us the meal on the house which was fine because the wings were nasty (the chipotle lime tasted like ketchup and the dry spiced tasted like Lay's bbq chips) and the fries that they eventually brought out in a to-go container were old and had obviously been sitting somewhere for awhile. She came to apologize and said there was a glitch in the computer that didn't send the fry order to the kitchen. I don't know whether that's true nor do I care. The service throughout the restaurant was some of the worst I've ever encountered. I can't speak for the whole menu but what I ordered was not at all tasty. But the decor was nice and it was clean so I'll give them one star for that. Don't come here unless you are too drunk to care about receiving quality service and decent food.",lR8xlI39O1V6Vionsv30Eg,0,0,1,sLQJkwvXkrwi2eYNrllP4g

The coffee is delicious, the service was great despite it being busy.

I ordered the eggs and biscuits and gravy, I left a happy girl. It was heavy, i suggest getting extra salsa/ pico on the side! Brightens each bite. 

My husband ordered the chicken and waffles, it was okay. The waffle was flimsy, not crispy. I know this sounds particular but when you're having it with chicken and pouring syrup all over, you want that waffle to be exceptional to hold up. It also didn't have much flavor. It just tasted like oil.

My boyfriend only orders buttermilk pancakes for breakfast when we eat out, so he naturally ordered The Pantry's based on all of the rave reviews here. This place has decent pancakes, but we've had better.  The butter we were served was actually a waxy/lard like margarine.  Soooo disgusting. The pancakes would have been much better with real butter.

I ordered the cheddar chive biscuits with scrambled eggs and country gravy.  I can tell you the country gravy is good. 

Our server was very businesslike taking our order. We never saw him after he left the table. A nice lady brought the food to our table. We never saw her again.

Their $5 cup of coffee that tastes like cardboard is not worth it. Can't say I'll ever come back here.",ti61X2ryuuPiXTXi5Pfd4w,0,0,2,SyDTEnmG5XRGsinF18a89A

Alex was our server tonight, not only did we wait 30min for our order to be taken but our food was not correct when it arrived at the table. No one checked back to see if our table was ok so we had to flag people down. We had to flag someone down for the check and were charged incorrectly for food we did not order. Alex said he would adjust it.. He returned with a check that had not been corrected after telling us it was. As we sat there waiting to sign the check other tables were complaining loudly about the service as well... 
If you decide to try it the Pantry, expect to spend at least 3 hours on a slow night and double check your bill...

Service was excellent.  All the servers are extremely nice.  They even gave me a to go cup for my coffee!

The place was pretty full and two parties of four in front of us in line. However, we only waited for about 2 minutes and the hostess offered us two seats at the bar. We said sure and were sat in front of a very quaint and clean subway tiled bar. 
We were immediately acknowledged by the bartender, Edgar. He asked what we would like to drink- I ordered a Mimosa and my mom was still looking over the beverage menu.
Edgar asked if she wanted Tequila (my mom is 76 years old!) and my mom said sure!   LOL
She actually ordered the coffee and we took our time to look over the food menu. They had a great breakfast selection and the food making it's way past us had great presentation and looked so fresh!  I decided upon the egg white omelet and added swiss cheese, spinach and mushrooms. Mom ordered the all-American breakfast with eggs scrambled, bacon crisp and dry whole wheat toast. It did not take very long for our breakfast at all, about 12 minutes and it was FABULOUS! My omelet was perfectly cooked and the smashbrowns were addicting! 
I wanted to eat them all but they provide a good size portion and I was full after a few bites. My mom was very happy with her breakfast as well- everything came out as she had requested.  Edgar and the other guy behind the bar, Eren, kept our water and coffee filled and made pleasant conversation with us during out meal. I would definitely recommend this place- food and service were great!!!",1qgjpD9Iz4DtPklG0RgEOg,1,0,5,jiQsjd9l_9HrgOVA4xFtXw

Manuel brought our food out and he was really funny as well. 

Now the food - the caprese flatbread was decent.  Didn't knock my socks off. I got the alfredo and subbed chicken for the shrimp. The noodles were over cooked but the sauce was not really heavy or too salty. Chicken was moist and tasty. So aside from the noodles being over cooked, this dish was tasty.

They have fruit loops on the menu but the waitress didn't tell us that they were out we found out when the server brought a different type of cereal, we of course sent it back for something our son would eat. Maybe I'm being difficult but I thought when a restaurant runs out of something they 1) notify the customer and 2) tells them what the options are?! The worst part was that my son and and got our food and my husbands dish never appeared, we had to ask the hostess to get the manager, since our waitress was no where to be found, and the manager, who was apologetic (reason for 2 stars) went to the kitchen and brought his dish, keep in mind the dish made it to our table when me and my son were both done with our food, and those of you who have been around a five year old know how restless kids get.

Again, this could have been a mirage (ha-see what I did there?) because we were so tired. If you look at their sandwich boards, they have a late night happy hour, I believe it's 12 am - 3 am (call or stop by and ask!).

It's $5 appetizers and $5 cocktails/well drinks. We ordered the dry rub and BBQ chicken wings. Not wanting to be out in the public any longer, we asked if we could get it to go. All in all everything took about 30 min. The wings were really good, and actually a good deal considering there were about 6 wings in each order for $5. The meat was moist and skin was crispy. I didn't think I'd care for the dry rub, but it's got a sweet, hickory, smokey taste that is really well put together.

The staff are courteous, it's a very cute setup with mason jars used as water glasses, and a very country, relaxed vibe.

On another night, we decided to get a burger, this was around 1 am. This time we called ahead and was told that it would be ready in 15 min. When we arrived to pick up our order at the bar as instructed, there was no bartender and no staff. We flagged down a server who appeared to just be standing around and let them know we were picking up a call ahead order. Instead of hunting down a bartender/server, he just told us to wait by the bar and someone should be able to help us and continued to stand in place.

The Backyard Burger ($17) was solid, not phenomenal. Just a burger on a potato bun, with lettuce, tomato, BBQ sauce, and onions. We ordered it with fries and to our dismay when we went to our room, they included two ketchup packets. So we had to head back down for more.

We also asked them to charge it to our room on the phone and were asked to produce a credit card upon pick-up.

I believe this operation is new, maybe opened around September 2014, so it could explain the scatterbrained service. It's a nice option to have being that's it's open 24 hours.",d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ,7,7,3,BDgSM3W5g4vMElDXIFKCmQ

Had breakfast here right now, my daughter asked for jam for her toast when her food was brought to her. It took 5 minutes to get her jam. The toast was cold . 

Second , my husband had asked for tobacco sauce for his hash browns. It took almost 10 minutes. When the waitress came she handed him salsa-- fresh.. He kindly told her, I had asked for tobacco and she said- oh yeah, here you go. 

She was kind-- just supppppper slow! Nothing kills a bomb breakfast-- more than a cold breakfast!

- fairly diverse menu, offering both breakfast and lunch at the same time. Perfect for those of us unsure of what time it is and preferring to trust our gut on food choices.
- a pot of coffee for the table to share (about 4 cups) only costs $5! Amazing cost-effective option. Wish more restaurants offered it.

Averages:
- food quality is mediocre. Nothing to write home about, but good enough to satisfy your hunger.
- the ambiance is nice, but a bit bright, especially for those of us nursing Saturday morning hangovers. 

Negatives:
- our waitress was an inconsistent mix of inattentive and overly involved. She kept us waiting around to place our order, but when she did talk to us, she was a bit pushy with her suggestions.

THE FOOD IS DELECTABLE HERE! It's not just a gimmicky themed restaurant.  I had the eggs benedict (which is my absolute fave breakfast food) and they did not disappoint!

My friend had the Boston Cream Pie pancakes, which I believe is one of their specialty pancakes that alternates everyday!

Whoever hired these servers should win an award because they literally remind me of the servers in some of the diners in my hometown (which I know, is kind of the idea).  The servers are all very sweet, and even their uniforms are on point!  The servers are even a bit quirky, so they have some character as compared to the formal and eloquent servers you're used to on the Strip.

Before I even sat down, my waiter tried to get me to pay $5 for water.  (""It's in a big bottle you can pour for yourself!"") I declined. ""So what do you want to drink?"" I still had not sat down, let alone had an opportunity to review the menu. 

I ordered steak and eggs from one of the three or four waiters buzzing around. I still have no idea who, if anyone, was my actual waiter.

I probably wouldn't have had a chance to try it if my wife didn't stop a waiter from clearing my plate while I got up for less than a minute.

I would have gladly taken a refill of my not-five-dollar-self-serve water, but none of the wait staff seemed to notice or care about that. 

The final straw, however, was the fourth plate-grab. A waiter interrupted me in the middle of a sentence, grabbed my plate, and asked if he could take it.

Now, let's talk about the service:

I really wanted to come here for my birthday breakfast and despite the usually long wait in line.  We were happy to hear that the wait was ""only 15 minutes"".  We did find it weird that literally every group in front or behind us we're being told the same amount of time, regardless of party size.  We figured maybe the tables are turned fairly quickly, so thought little of it.

Turns out that a couple of the ""solo"" people in line were placeholders for large parties; two of which were parties of 10!  So our ""15 minute wait"" became 40.

We finally make it to the front of the line when the hostess comes up looking for the party of 2 (being us).  She literally stands in front of us, looks right past us and calls on the family behind us; a group of clearly at least 5 people and all Caucasian.  The father of that group looked right at the hostess and told her: ""I'm pretty sure these guys are before us."" She only rolled her eyes and gave some half-hearted, BS excuse as to why she chose to ignore the gay couple of color.

We thanked the gentleman behind us and walked into the dining room where the hostess was already waiting (clearly impatient and irritated) at our table.  Would've been nicer if she actually LED us to our table rather than force us to find her, but at that point we already wrote off her inability to provide even a passing semblance of customer service.

The food service itself was ok.  Wasn't bad but certainly wasn't good. Truthfully, we didn't expect expedient service given the location and venue, but as our experience had started on the most SOUR note, we lost our appetite abd finished less than half our meal.  We were in and out of there so fast because honestly, we didn't feel welcome.  I would say we hadn't even been sitting for the 15 minutes we were quoted at the outset.

The best part of our experience was getting our bill almost instantly as we wanted to get the hell out of there.  We charged it to our room at the Mirage and left.

We did make an attempt to say something to the Front of House Manager but she was barely phased by the event and offered the most disingenuous apology I've heard in quite some time.  Last time we'll come here.  It's a shame really. Their bread pudding is phenomenal but not worth the price of being disrespected.

I really should've just gone to the Carnegie Deli instead.  The food tastes better, wait is minimal and our meal doesn't come with a side of bigotry.",FQW3yhUGAPzES50ufBsGnw,0,0,2,9pe1OwangbrhlNtXZ8Yv0w

The Pantry is the 24 hour restaurant at the Mirage Resort and Casino.  On my most recent trip, my mom and I decided to eat breakfast at the Pantry purely out of convenience reasons (though this was not our first visit to this restaurant).

1.  Yes, its convenient.  They serve breakfast food all day, and other menu items include salads, sandwiches, large entrees, etc.

2.  Yes, they offer room service.  Even more convenience at your fingertips; well its convenient if you're a guest at the Mirage anyway.

3.  Yes, they're open 24 hours.  Have I yet to mention the convenience of the Pantry??!

4.  Yes, the prices are a bit high.  This is after all Vegas resort pricing.

5.  Yes, the lines can get long for breakfast and lunch (and possibly dinner).  The reason being that the Mirage doesn't have a food court like other resorts, and the only other lower ended dining options at the resort are CPK, Carnegie Deli, or a burger place.  Also, its situated near the guest elevators so this is probably more for the fact that its close by (and convenient) than the other aforementioned places.

6.  Yes, the staff is courteous and friendly.  But then, they want a good tip, so of course they are.

7.  Yes, the food portions are fairly decent.  Though there is a nice price, the food portions (for our breakfast orders) were very filling.  Not overly generous, but not wanting more than what you were given.  I had the eggs benedict, while my mom chose the corned beef hash.  We both liked our entrees, no complaints.

BOTTOM LINE:
Convenient.  Open 24 hours.  Located near the guest elevators.  Good option for breakfast if staying at the Mirage.",HaoPeg2ySVEbQKN3gySxHQ,12,8,3,Sl2MgZTtjxB0H-bOWpC8iQ

Our food was really good and they served a decent amount. We weren't really happy about the fact that coffee was on the table with cream ready to pour all ready to go.. like it was free. The lady even started pouring without letting me know I'd be charged for it. The coffee was $5 a cup... a little overrated if you ask me.

I really wanted French Toast, plain old French toast but all they have is Vanilla flavored white chocolate.  Thought I'd have a waffle, only have vanilla flavored.  Some times more is less.

Their potato sides are called smashed potatoes and they are actually red potatoes which are as described, smashed.  For my money, the best part of the breakfast.

the servers are all very pleasant and service is decent and food arrives pretty quickly.  We did see one poor woman when we sat at the bar to eat who had been waiting for about 40 minutes.  Apparently her order got lost but the bartender did the right thing and didn't charge her for her order.

Had to laugh at the man next to us, he complained to the server that his oatmeal wasn't hot enough and he wanted her to fix it.  Of course the server did just that be we thought it funny since he'd finished it and guess he wanted more so he complained.

Berry french toast was MORE THAN filling!
Prices were actually decent for Vegas.
Only issue was that some of the tables (one that we were at) are kind of close together (about 6 inches apart) so you kind of feel like you are dining community style.
I would have had more issue with it if I had had a serious night of indulgence and just wanted to keep low, but luckily I did not and the people at the next table were friendly and entertaining.
It also got a little loud in there for normal conversation and it was only about 2/3 of the way full.

Our appetizers came out about 30 seconds before our main course came out. There was a mistake with my order and was sent back to the kitchen to be replaced with the correct order. By the time my food returned, our party had finished their food and was ready to leave. My food was brought to the table by the chef, which was a nice gesture. Both the chef and waitress came to the table, they just put the food on the table and walked away, not a word from either of them.  Also, when my food arrived, there was another mistake, my sandwich was not cut and the knives on the table weren't sharp enough for me to cut it myself. 

The level of unprofessional behavior from the staff at the restaurant was not what I would expect at any establishment, much less at a hotel like the Mirage. There was one employee who was very friendly and helpful, it was a man who was clearing the tables. 

I wish the manager had come by our table so that I could speak to him/her about the situation and have a positive resolution, but we never saw the manager. Might as well have had a chimpanzee in a suit with a manager tag on his chest.

SERVICE.
I can understand it being slow during the wee hours of the morning, but at 2 pm on a weekday, service was incredibly slow, despite the place being 3/4 empty. It took 30+ minutes for our table to get 2 burgers and a salad, which seems excessive. Flagging down a waitress for the bill later was quite time consuming as well.

THE FOOD.
The portions are massive, which is good, since the prices are fairly high too. You definitely get  a decent bang for your buck, and the food is fresh, but altogether fairly heavy. A cobb salad came with at least a cup of crumbled blue cheese (if not more), along with an overload of other ingredients as well. And as there are no fridges in the rooms, you'll more likely than not be wasting most of your lunch.

My husband had the brisket cheese steak on baguette instead of ciabatta.  He seemed to like it.  It was pretty big, too.

She gave us great menu recommendations as we weren't sure what we were going to order.  While my daughters and I were dining, my brother and his girlfriend stopped by to say hi and Janel was so gracious and helpful.  She made sure another table was pushed over to ours to make sure we all could sit together.  

As you read this review it sounds pretty typical of what a server should do - and it is.  What made it different is that she was so kind and genuine.  She really took the time to chat with us even though she was busy.  She really listened and was so friendly.  She takes relationship building in a small amount of time to the next level.  Relationship building is big part of my business so I am a pretty good at gauging this.  

When my daughters and I left we talked about how awesome she was and we all said that we definitely needed to write a review about her.

This most recent visit was a good experience. The only red flag I had was the pace of service. We came around 9pm on a Wednesday night.

We ended up ordering the Homespun Potato Chips for our appetizer. The dip had truffle oil, mushrooms and spinach (I think?). Pretty good. I also ordered a bowl of clam chowder. This is something I would definitely recommend, especially if you're a chowder fan. Even if you're not though, my boyfriend who usually steers clear of all chowders gave it his seal of approval. Lastly, for his meal, my boyfriend ordered the Steak & Taters. Ordered the steak medium and it was cooked to perfection. Super tender and juicy and it actually had a great flavor to it - no steak sauce necessary. 

No complaints about our meal - except the loud & obnoxious table near us. But that's not the restaurant's fault. Our meal including tip was an even $50.",7Q4xvpbjLa_s7P802HtEJg,0,0,4,nZnK99aDhHNgus_EHbKk2A

This is the hotel's restaurant and the one that then goes on to give you room service. They are open 24 hours and breakfast is available all day. That's right I said it. All day breakfast people.

Generally there isn't much of a wait. In fact, if you want to sit at the bar, there is no wait at all and you have access to the full menu. Being on one of my low carb diets it was challenging to say the least not because there was no protein but because of how amazing the carbs were on the menu! But I managed with a chicken fried steak (awesome by the way and delicious... but skipped the potatoes) and chicken wings. What a combo but the chicken wings are awesome (but so are the ones across the way at the Still.

I also had one meal there where I had the Caesar salad with chicken. Chicken was dry so I would go with shrimp the next time. Service was quick and fantastic.

Our waitress gushed about how amazing the shrimp penne was and encouraged me to get it. When it arrived, the display was great but the flavor was lacking. The cream sauce was too thick and it wasnt all that hot. The shrimp was overcooked and tough and I ended up not even eating all five shrimp on the dish. For dessert we got the apple pie with vanilla ice cream - now THAT was good stuff! Absolutely delicious! 

Decor is nice - it feels like you are in an offshoot of Martha Stewart's kitchen or something, and I mean that in a good way! Very crisp and clean in appearence.

Once seated we were asked for our drink orders. We selected two glasses of wine, a Pinot Noir and waters. It took another 5 minutes more to get our water glasses filled. When our waitress came over to take our meal order another 5 minutes later, she mentioned that they were out of the wine we selected. We order a Merlot as a replacement. My wife ordered the daily soup and grilled cheese sandwich. I ordered the ""Backyard Burger"" and a side of clam chowder. The waitress asked me if I wanted the soup out separate of my burger which I said I could have them brought together. The same question was not asked of my wife. About 10 minutes later our food arrived and when we asked about our wine, the person delivering our food (which was not our waitress), had no clue that we had ordered wine. My wife told this person to cancel the wine order since we had hoped to drink our wine before our meal was served. When I cut into my burger it was medium rare (bright red). I had ordered it as a ""medium"". I flagged down a bus person who took it back to the kitchen to fix a new burger. A few minutes later, the manager came out with two glasses of wine and apologized for the issue with our drink order. He also said that the meat was how they cooked it for ""medium"" but would redo it as ""medium well"". The new burger was OK but even at ""medium well' there was still some pink to the inside. 

We finished our meal and got our check. As we were reviewing the charges, we realized that the wine we did get was charged at $14. My wife called over and got a copy of the drink menu only to find that the wine we did order was only $12 per glass. We flagged down our waitress to have her fix the bill. She took it back to the manager and shortly afterwards got a new bill with $4 discount applied. We paid the bill and left.

As convenient this new restaurant is for Mirage guests, the service and food quality are not worth it.

On another visit I ordered the White Chocolate Brioche French Toast, which had an excellent presentation with mixed berries, berry compote, a touch of whipped mascarpone, and syrup. Unfortunately, the taste didn't match the looks. The bread didn't taste cooked fully, the berries didn't mix well with the syrup (perhaps they were out of season), and the French Toast didn't have a White Chocolate flavor as advertised. The waiter said the bread was lightly dusted in white chocolate, but if I wanted to actually taste the chocolate I should have ordered the chocolate pancakes.

The atmosphere of Pantry is best described as a down home bakery, with black and white accents and funky accessories dotting the walls. My husband immediately noticed how quirky and inviting it looked as we walked by, asking if we could stop in for lunch. Not so set on diner food yet noticing this one's unique appeal, I reluctantly agreed.  

I ordered the turkey club sandwich.  Being someone that doesn't eat red meat, my options were limited on their menu.  Honestly I was afraid I was going to get boring Oscar Meyer turkey on a stale roll and was already preparing to make this my first and last visit.  The inclusion of turkey bacon and avocado on the sandwich had me hoping I might be wrong, but I didn't hold my breath. Luckily when the food arrived I was pleasantly surprised. My roll was soft and fresh, the turkey thinly sliced and of high quality, with thick avocado and lettuce piled high on top. A pickle, pickled vegetables and metal container of french fries rounded out my plate. The presentation was spot on and the taste was pretty much on par with how it looked. No, this wasn't the best food I had ever had, but it was pretty damn good for a diner in The Mirage!

My husband's spinach feta omelet with roasted tomatoes looked pretty tasty as well. It was cooked to perfection with a side of arugula and whole wheat toast. Fresh jam was also available on the table. Upon finishing his plate, he told me this might be the best breakfast he's had in Vegas thus far (and we usually go twice a year). Upon looking at the hotel's magazine later, Pantry also offers Valrhona ""Grand Cru"" milk chocolate pancakes. Chunks of chocolate piled atop freshly made pancakes? Yes Please!

The first night we got in I was starving after a long plane ride and bad airport snacks, so we decided to get in line for a table. On a whim we asked if the bar was first come first serve and found out it was, so we ditched the line to eat there instead without a wait.

A bartender brought waters fairly quickly while we browsed the menu. I'm always a sucker for places that serve all day breakfast, but Big T's Grilled Cheese was calling my name. Much like pizza, I rarely meet a sandwich with melted cheese I don't like. 

They served it with piping hot potato wedges, ketchup, a pickle, and pickled green beans. I'm not normally a green bean person but these were awesome. They had that spicy/sweet thing going on and added a much needed bite of freshness to such an indulgent plate (not that I was complaining). 

My friend ordered the Backyard Burger which also came with pickled green beans, a pickle, and potato wedges. On it was caramelized onions, tomatoes, greens, cheddar (that she left off), and a potato bun. She mixed some of the tableside hot sauce into her ketchup and said it made it even better. It was the perfect late night greasy meal.

I wanted to try their coffee and pancakes before leaving (that I heard were great), but we never got back around to it.

Anyways, my friend's mom had a membership and we received 50% comp for our meals which made it so much more worth it. The pancakes were delish!!! I highly recommend getting one plate and sharing with everyone because it can get a little tiring eating all that in one sitting, the portion is also pretty big. I ordered the mahi mahi tacos and they were okay. My tacos were pretty dry in my opinion, but I drenched them in limes and hot sauce which satisfied me just enough. I also ordered a side of potato wedges and they were my favorite!!! Definitely get the fries if you're a die hard potato fan. They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and had so much flavor without being too salty. Also, presentation was very nice and picture perfect if you're a insta foodie this is perfect for that new post ;).

Food is a little bit pricey, but we thought good.  We had two breakfasts here and I had a late afternoon ""snack"" of a bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup.   All good.  Loved the feta-spinach omelet and the smashed browns (instead of hash browns) and my biscuit. Husband had some great pancakes.

The soup wasn't good and came out piping hot to the point where I have burns on my tongue, even after waiting a few minutes. It didn't come with bread and when I asked the waitress she said I couldn't have a single slice but there is bread we could purchase. I don't care about spending money, even the additional $4 for bread wouldn't have bothered me so much but come on its a restaurant that served us nothing while we waited and were out of more things than that which were available.

This time we find ourselves at The Mirage. The Pantry was our only option.

It's bright and clean, but the menu was limited. I didn't really want to go there, but since pickings were slim, decided to eat here, not go on a mission to find something else, somewhere else. 

We were quickly seated. Our waiter was nice, and attentive , but that's pretty much the positives.

My husband and I decided. To split the Grilled Shrimp Penne pasta and the Chicken wings ( two ways ) to drink I ordered a coffee and Bailey's. 
The coffee was WAY too strong. In addition to the Bailey's, I had to add cream, sugar in the raw and a sugar substitute to make it drinkable. Normally I would add a touch of milk and a half sugar substitute to taste the creamy goodness of Bailey's but this time it was barely noticeable.

The pasta I did not enjoy at all. It was billed as a ""Bigger"" item, but only had 5 over cooked shrimp in it ( my husbands one shrimp still had a shell on it so it totally turned him off ) I actually found the shrimp was the only thing I liked in it. The pasta itself was way too ""saucy"" yet very bland. I also didn't like the tomatoes nor the ham- I barely ate any of mine. 

The chicken wings I also didn't like. They were half lime chipotle (again I found these too saucy / fatty and undercooked despite my request to get the wings well done) . The other half was a dry BBQ rub. This was a bit better but I only ate 1. The wings also came with carrots and celery .

Shortly after we arrived, it became so loud that we could barely converse.

The sign outside showing they had some happy hour specials drew us in. Happy hour runs from 3-6 pm and 11pm-2am daily. Much to my delight they serve Coke here. (That is the reason they get an extra star.) We ordered the caprese flatbread ($5), the chicken wings with the dry rub($5), and the pretzel with the cheese dip($5). All were specially priced for happy hour. The flatbread was gross. It had no flavor and was dry. We each ate one piece and left the rest. The wings were ok. My friend liked them better then I did I think. I thought the seasoning was just thrown on top on them. There was some ""ranch"" that was served with them, but they were better without it I guess. They were also served with some carrots and celery, but they looked so dried out and gross we thought they might have just been for decoration. The pretzel was just ok. It was just a filler. The service was friendly. Our server even offered to make me a Coke to go! That is the only reason I am giving two stars. Otherwise, I would not recommend this place for the happy hour food at all!!

We were rushed to order by more than one person. We were looking for a small and affordable breakfast. Two of us ordered a bagel, one ordered the yogurt parfait and the other ordered biscuits. We got the vibe right away that our waitress didn't like that we ordered small/inexpensive items. She rushed off to put our order in, brought our bills within 10 minutes and insisted we give her the cash we had sitting on the table under our bill .... before we were done eating! The tone and pushiness she had was very rude. We told her to keep the change for a tip, instead of keeping it she came back and slammed it on the table. We kept the tip.

My review is for room service because guests at the Mirage can order from the Pantry menu. The menu in the room had a nice selection of breakfast foods such as omelettes, pancakes and other morning items. It also included hamburgers, club sandwiches and salads. I selected an omelette with toast and potatoes. I placed my order via the hotel room phone and the lady that took my order was extremely friendly. She told me my food would be ready in 20-30 minutes and verified my room number. I heard a knock on the door in 20 minutes and a gentleman with a pantry paper bag with handles stood at my door. The food was delivered in a bag that reminded me of a shopping bag and was not on a traditional tray. The room service deliverer handed me my receipt and also reminded me that the receipt stapled to the bag had the last 4 digits of my credit card. That was a nice security measure and I appreciate that. The bag contained the omelette on a plastic plate with a lid, silverware, and mini condiments. Everything was included and my omelette was delicious. The toast had a buttery taste and potatoes were perfect with the omelette and ketchup. The price was not bad either ($20). I highly recommend ordering breakfast for any meal at the Pantry.

4069173,2018-05-14,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"We ate here several times while staying at the Mirage, and had mixed experiences.

The decor here is very nice and a lovely change from standard Vegas strip/casino restaurant style.  It is a light, bright, country store in the 1920's style - perhaps something you'd expect walking into the book Fried Green Tomatoes.  It's tasteful and restful on the eyes after all the bright lights and jarring colours elsewhere.  

Our first stop was in the evening.  My husband and I had been out walking the strip all day and were desperately hot and thirsty, and wanted a snack before the show we were headed to (Terry Fator!) but weren't ready for dinner.  The service was friendly and exceptionally prompt and thorough.  The waitress was chatty in a nice way, and the food was fabulous.

Our second stop was in the morning.  I was meeting my parents - who were also staying at the Mirage - for breakfast.  The coffee arrived promptly, but after taking our order, the waitress vanished for a long period of time.  Finally, a food runner came and deposited pancakes - my dad's order - in front of him, but the rest of the orders didn't match.  My dad had already grabbed the butter and his knife, was readily doctoring his pancakes when they were swooped out from in front of him, the butter taken from his hand, and the food served to another table.

I mean, ew.  I know my dad, so it's fine, but if it had been my food and I'd seen that happen?  I'd have been horrified.

As we watched several tables seated well after us receive their food, we started to wonder about our own.  We hadn't seen the waitress in some time, so finally flagged her down.  She promised to check on our food and got us some additional coffee.

After quite a long wait again, our food arrived.  My suspicion is that the waitress hadn't put the order in until we asked her about it, due to the timing involved.  The blueberry pancakes were exceptional, and my extra crispy bacon order was fantastic.  My parents loved their food as well, but it took us a long time to get cream refills for the coffee and even to get the check.  I feel as though the waitress may have had too many tables or somesuch as she seemed very, very harried.

The next day we gave it another go for breakfast.  I didn't have much of an appetite so decided on just a bagel, which was very good.  Service was fair, not as bad as the day before, not as good as the first day.  It took quite a bit of time once more for coffee refills.

Overall, I like the food here very much and appreciate that it is open 24 hours.  However, breakfast time service seems a little hit or miss.",_cLzb8A4lhYT9QcgcsJuVQ,0,0,3,BiJ_eGA3vYmocbYEGge2KQ

I waiting about 15 minutes, no big deal, place was pretty busy. They had a separate person bringing the food, so he seemed confused on who it was for, even though i was by myself.  They messed up and gave me a sunny side up instead of scramble, he said he would just bring another dish with scrambled eggs which is fine. The breakfast was mediocre, 3 crappy strips of bacon, i was hoping for like 6 ridiculous huge pieces for the $17, only two pieces of toast, and the rest was all has brown/hash/casserole, which was good.

It came with a side of deli mustard and a beer cheese sauce for dipping. The sauce was just okay, the cheese was a bit gritty, but the pretzel was good enough to have on its own. 
The waffle fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, and came loaded with melted cheese, bacon, chopped tomato, sour cream, and green onion. I would recommend these fries for sure! The portion is also a good size and surprisingly filling.
We also split dessert--the mini donuts and the chocolately chocolate skillet cookie.
The donuts were delicious! They came out warm and covered in sugar! The cookie was a little disappointing. The chocolate was too intense and a little bitter, which gave it a weird flavor overall. We told Jonel about it, and she was more than happy to replace it with something else. We chose the bananas foster Sunday, which was huge and very delicious. The ice cream had a great creamy texture and the rum caramel sauce was sweet, but not overly sweet. The bananas were absolutely perfect, cold and fresh, with no impurities at all! 

Overall the food was really good (their pancakes are also amazing for breakfast), but the service is what stood out and made the dining experience truly spectacular. Jonel was the epitome of friendly, taking the time out of her busy schedule to check in to make sure everything was perfect and getting whatever we needed. She even spent some time having a nice conversation. Service of this caliber is something I would expect at one of the celebrity chef driven restaurants on the Strip, so Pantry is extremely lucky to have her. I recommend to request her when dining here because she will make your day!",tPbeQi5YjBeehLAlEOm3Rg,0,0,5,I2jzZjvZUx7nNzuWYTObrA

Get over yourself chef- this place is nothing more then a glorified coffee shop, and I'm pretty sure you are nothing more then a cook.  This place is literally located right outside the elevators that lead up to the hotel rooms. If I order a dessert with some kind of ice cream- I know it will slightly melt during my long 2 minute walk back to my room. How about  investing in some small styrofoam containers- like what an ice cream store would give you for ice cream you wanted to take home.

He states that the two drinks that I ordered, are in the one cup. 

Two other couples observed our server trying to explain, and asked us what was the deal. There is no deal. Apparently, the 2-for-1 drink special they advertise is for looks, and draw, but in the end, you get ripped. Ok. Kinda tricky there. 

Our server was nice enough to fix it without asking, so he saved the day. No one wants to argue at breakfast, wtf. Potatoes were delicious. They weren't hash browns or potatoes o'brien. It was a nice unique mash potato fried with seasonings hybrid. Waffle was perfect. It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I drowned it in butter and covered it with an egg.

It started Monday evening waiting on friends who I was meeting to see Beatles Love. We sat at the bar and I could tell almost immediately that things weren't going to go well. The bartender was going off about something with two guests sitting at the bar. When I ordered a martini, he very sarcastically stated, ""Well I hope you like that on the rocks - we don't have martini glasses here."" Oh well, a vodka tonic for me then.

I started with Calamari -- extremely ""rubbery"" for calamari with very soggy breading. They serve their calamari with a mayo based dip which I didn't care for, but that is just my personal taste. The soggy, rubbery calamari -- no thanks.

When my friends arrived, they literally waited five minutes before being acknowledged by the bartender. Apparently the manager saw that he was struggling and came behind the bar and we were so relived, thinking he was there to help. I was dumbfounded when we asked for drinks and his response was, ""The bartender is backed up -- he'll be caught up soon."" What decent manager doesn't jump in and help!!! One of my friends asked for lemonade and you'd have thought he asked for bubbling jet fuel. The bartender acted completely put out and it was a real effort for him to find the lemonade.

The loaded waffle fries my friends had were actually decent, but the terrible service and my bad calamari were signs that we won't be back. Pantry has a long way to go, and it is a shame because the concept is a great one.",Kpgc6qNkjpEfgQ9-zYWQsg,0,2,1,t5RRH94EOOXlwURd4KtYPA

When I checked into my room there was a picture of the Pantry's pancakes on the cover of the room service menu.  They looked scrumptious so on day two I succumbed to my yearning for pancakes and went downstairs.  So you know how usually the picture never looks like what you actually get when it comes to food in restaurants?  Not this time!

It's in a great location, just passed the guest room elevators which makes it a prime pit stop before and after heading out to the strip. We initially considered coming here for breakfast but found that their options seemed limited, the line too long and the prices too steep. Before heading out for a night of dancing however, the Pantry suddenly seemed more enticing and we stopped by for dinner. Pantry definitely has more of a diner feel to it but it's almost like an upscale diner as its interior is very modern and kept very neat and clean. I ordered the veggie burger and side salad. It was very tasty. The quality of the greens was evident and the dressing wasn't your typical diner ranch but a nice balsamic instead. The veggie patty was so good that I started eating it by itself without the bun - that's not to say that the bun wasn't delicious but I wasn't looking to grow a food baby right before going out. All my friends enjoyed what they ordered. My friend's meatball sandwich looked giant and delicious and I was tempted to take a bite. There was also chicken and waffles at the table and a shrimp pasta. Both were said to be really good. Service here was fast and our server was accommodating of our group of 6 when it came to splitting the bill. If at the Mirage again I would definitely stop by.

- Chances are you're in dire need of food to go with your drinking habit. Pantry serves breakfast 24 hrs a day.
- You probably smell pretty bad from drinking, smoking, and dancing all night. Grab a bite to eat before you head up to hit the shower, your hangover will thank you.
- Super fast friendly service and they won't even make fun of the fact that you cheaped out and got a $20 hooker, instead of a $100 hooker. Hey at least you're nice enough to buy her some pancakes. 
- Prices are moderately expensive, but it is Las Vegas the only thing cheap are the hookers.
- Interestingly enough they have healthy organic options...in case you've endulged so much you need to offset your behavior.
- You can gamble close by while you wait for a seat.
- The décor is very white, French country kitchen style. Nice and keeps you awake night or day.

The service was great. We had a very helpful service, and she had an assistant who constantly made sure our glasses were full.

I ordered an omelet with bacon, tomato and cheese, side of potatoes and instead of bread, one of their cheddar and chive biscuits. If you do nothing else, get those biscuits. My oh my, delicious you guys. Warm and flaky with just the perfect amount of well, everything.

4674433,2017-10-24,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"The first meal I had here was somewhat mediocre, but that was partly my fault- I mean, how interesting can eggs and bacon and toast really get? It tasted fine but what weirded me out was the cheese on my eggs. I asked for cheddar for my eggs, and technically they did do that, but it was literally a square slice of cheese just thrown on top of my eggs, slightly melted. It wasn't very good. Also, the bacon was so crunchy I felt like I was going to break my teeth on it. But the service was great, and the pancakes on the plate of the guy sitting next to me looked and smelled so good, I decided to give the Pantry another chance.

So the next day I came back, and I ordered blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes did not disappoint, and thankfully the bacon was the perfect level of crispy/chewy this time. The coffee was good again and the service was even better than before as well. My only critique is that I am pretty sure the ""maple syrup"" is not real maple syrup. But I didn't have the heart to ask because the guys behind the counter were so friendly and fun. Ultimately I let it go because I am aware that I can totally be a syrup snob, not unlike most Mainers.

I would come here to eat again if it wasn't in the Mirage. I am not sure I could ever go back inside that hotel because of the horrible air quality.

I was not impressed with any portion of this meal.  The pizza crust tasted like it was frozen and made by Digiorno.  The truffle potato chips had a great crunch but the flavor on top of the chips was not good.  The pretzel and cheese dip also was unimpressive.  Two pretzels without salt served with a beer cheese dip with little flavor and a side of mustard.  The pretzel itself was decent but the cheese sauce was very plain and in need of seasoning.  The truffle mac and cheese had overpowering flavor of mushrooms.  Like the beer cheese dip this dish also lacked seasoning.  Finally the cinnamon doughnut bites were the one saving grace of the meal.  Warm and soft they brought some happiness to an otherwise lackluster sampling.

It wasn't busy, so we walked right in to the bar and were almost to the bar but an employee, the hostess, told us we had to wait in line. It wasnt clear that there was a line so we stood behind two other people.  They seemed kinda annoyed because they were waiting a long time. So the manager told them there weren't enough servers.

Well, when it was our turn to go in, some guy from the casino area just walked up to the hostess and asked if he could sit at the bar. And guess what...she took him right to the bar & sat him down before us even though we had asked to sit at the bar well before!!!! He didn't even have to wait in line!! Wtf!!!?!

So when she sat us down, at the bar mind you, we sat next to him. Karma.

Anyways, so we ordered food and I ordered a Bloody Mary with rum.  Food came out, kinda slow, but still no drink. Whatever's, maybe they were still making it...? As for food... I ordered the Mac n Cheese. It was sour tasting. Not good. I did not enjoy it.  My friend ordered the fried chicken.  It was not cooked thoroughly. The biscuit that was served with it was tasty! 

So I never got my Bloody Mary, our server didn't even apologize for not making it or serving it! Funniest part of the night..the guy who got seated before us, got his food way late!! And he had only ordered a small salad! Ha! That made me laugh.

So, overall I didn't like the place. I think it's kinda new, but for a Vegas restaurant, standards are higher for service and food.  Next time I'm gonna stick with Planet Dailies. Can't go wrong with that place!!",W1WjM6DyXMysC3y950RUhw,2,1,2,HIbXKf8XRwb8ovok1CHKyA

They have a ""delivery service"" to any hotel room.  It's pretty much the same menu, only the room service menu had pizza which I didn't see on the menu outside the restaurant.  I'm guessing if you asked for it though, they would make it for you.  (Don't quote me on that, just saying it makes sense since it probably all comes from the same kitchen.)

I placed the order, simple - they told it would take about 45 minutes and I'm thinking - what's the deal?  Are they ordering Dominos and slapping it into a Pantry branded box? 

Well it actually only took about 30 minutes and the pizza was delicious!  I couldn't eat it all so I took it home (in California) the next day and microwaved it and it was still good.  The mark of a good pizza.

They sent everything I needed like parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, etc.  All in a little bag.  The plastic plate was even fun because it felt like a fancier plate than a Walmart special.  

It's room service prices, so $19 for a pizza, plus a $3 added fee and tax.  However, $25 for a hand delivered pizza to a hotel room at midnight, it's actually a good deal. I can spend that ordering from Pizza Hut at home.

I had two meals there and I think my room service was made by Pantry, so technically that's three meals there in three days. The food is good and if you make the right choices, you can eat good food at a food court price in a pretty restaurant. 

My first time there, I ordered peppermint tea and cheddar biscuits. The tea was brought to me in a white tea pot and I had at least three cups. I've had better cheddar biscuits in my life - they weren't overly cheddar-y, but they were good enough and quite filling. They were served with honey and butter, for which I can't vouch as I had neither. I think the total was $6 before tax. 

I had a very early meal at Pantry the day I left Las Vegas. I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato soup, but they were out of tomato soup and wouldn't be abler to serve any more until after 11 a.m. when they started lunch again (I think they serve only breakfast between 5 or 6 and 11 a.m.). I was served fries even though I hadn't ordered them, but I wasn't charged for them. The grilled cheese was good. I'd have it again. I also had Pantry's ice cream sundae. I don't recall whether that was the official name of it or whether it was called something else. It was very large and I could only eat about 2/3 of it.

4958046,2017-11-21,1,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"Had a good, but certainly not close to great, lunch at Pantry on a Thursday afternoon.  We arrived at Pantry around 1:30.  It was decently busy, but we walked right out.  I can't recall the name of Mirage's previous 24 hour coffee shop, but the decor at Pantry is a significant upgrade.  

Service was acceptable during our meal, but it certainly was not great.  We had to wait for water refills a couple of times and getting our check back once we had given her the room number took quite a while.  That being said, our server was very friendly and did get us extra condiments quickly.

To eat, I went with the cajun chicken sandwich and the table shared an order of mac and cheese.  The sandwich comes with grilled chicken, cheese, asparagus, some sort of green (maybe arugula?  Can't remember) and a spicy sauce on a ciabatta bun.  The bun was way too thick.  It was simply too much bread for the sandwich.  I had a couple of bites of the sandwich together and then gave up and ate the filling with a knife and fork.  The chicken was seasoned well but nothing about the dish was ""cajun.""  It had no heat whatsoever.  The creamy avocado was nice with the chicken and the bacon was appropriately crispy.  The sauce was basically mayo.  The fries were standard wedge fries that you've probably had a lot of places.  I would not order this again, it's not that it was especially bad, but it was average to be sure.  Definitely 3 stars.

The mac and cheese was good, but not great.  I am guessing they use some sort of processed cheese to improve the creaminess of the dish.  A serving was enough for 2-3 people to share.

I would return to Pantry on future trips to Mirage, I think I probably should have ordered off of the all day breakfast list rather than lunch.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,1,3,UX2wbZs9rp1rGAlgcKSkPQ

5076958,2016-03-13,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"After leaving the secret garden and dolphin habitat when it closed at 5:30, we headed here to feed a starving toddler. We had to wait a bit for a table for six, but it was easy for all the couples. 

We ordered happy hour foods: $5 calamari bowl, $5 chicken wings (6 wings), and then two kid's meals: the waffles with fruit and whipped butter, and the turkey sandwich with fries. Then when my parents came to join us, we ordered truffle mac and cheese and the ribs entree. 

We got our waters and a milk really quickly, but the waitress took some time to take our orders. The food took a bit to make, but not too bad. 

Calamari: Not great, it was crunchy, but the breading left a lot to be desired. It surprisingly wasn't salty enough, and was really tasteless- but REALLY crunchy. I wouldn't get it again. Came with limes and the usual marinara sauce. 

Chicken wings: pretty tasty. Good amount of sauce. Came with ranch. 

The turkey sandwich: I didn't eat it, but it was pretty thick, so lots of turkey, mayo, and fries! 

The waffles: the best part of our meal. I asked for whipped cream on the side, and well, I basically used the waffles as a vehicle for whipped cream delivery. So good.

Truffle mac and cheese: Truffle flavor is there, but there wasn't enough cheese! It just seemed like eating pasta with truffle oil. 

The ribs: sauce is super salty (hah!), I couldn't withstand eating more than one rib (at that point in the meal). 

Good: waffles (kid's dish)
Meh: truffle mac and cheese, ribs
Bad: Calamari

If I could, I would just go in and order all the kid's meals. They're the cutest, smallish servings, so you can try a lot of the dishes. :P",O9D9-9-KFJ8BfCiq838oIg,0,0,3,3haQgk-uBB_NtyKj41B6zw

I like the white clean homey theme it had going on. Menu had a wide variety of foods and prices were reasonable. Bf and I were not that hungry so we ordered a grilled shrimp penne pasta and calamari. Boy was that a good idea! Pasta looked like a sharing platter for 2-3 people and calamari was a good size considering it was an appetizer!

5134940,2016-05-11,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"A mixed bag but I'm basically a fan.  This review requires bullet points.

1.  Service is slower.  Not painfully slow but slower.  The food is Southern and regrettably so is the service.  I'd call this a management issue.  It simply isn't fast enough.  Vegas is a city.  And I get a feeling these are career waitresses who've burnt out some time ago.  No matter what time of day.  

What I'm about to discuss next sounds racist.  But I believe I observed some racism and to discuss as much requires discussing races.  Basically four black ladies in their late 20s came in and waited for service.  They never got it and left.   I believe they left because of nervous looks from the Asian hostess and Asian waitress.  (They looked nervous in general... which is strange.)  Anyway if four black ladies can't get chicken and waffles (a featured dish) in this place then WTF is this place doing exactly?

2.   I ate here several times and found the food hit or miss.  Basically whenever that 'gravy' was involved the dish suffered.  An egg dish with said gravy was so weak I should have sent it back... but was afraid to... because of all those nervous looks.  I ordered a side of bacon and felt very precooked (buffet) style.  The fried chicken was OUT OF THIS WORLD but next time I'd say HOLD THE GRAVY.   I also had an arugula goat cheese salad to die for.  Good luck finding a place with great salad and fried chicken -- lol.

3.  The menu needed a 3 eggs with meat and biscuit plate.  Instead of putting things together yourself.  Nickel and diming that way.   I grew so tired of this breakfast I went back to the Cravings buffet.  There's a big dude from Trinidad who makes eggs fresh for you -- and the buffet bacon was thin but warmer than Pantry.  Go figure.

4.  9 dollars for a tall can of Pabst?  Really?  Make it $6.

5.  Pleasant interior but noisy.  CLACK CLACKy.   But it has a great people chatting buzz.  In the morning it took a nice cup of coffee to be able to tolerate the noise.   

6.  This place is open air which would have been a problem in the Mirage.  Smoke from the casino floor was supposed to pour in but didn't thanks to new and improved AC.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,1,1,3,LB5H2Nu-v_WYk04odq5wAA

5161805,2015-11-30,1,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"We came here twice during our stay in Las Vegas. I would give the restaurant a 3.5 if half stars were allowed, but I bumped it up to a 4 only because during both our visits the service was really friendly. 

Food on the first day was really awesome. We went for dinner on Friday. There was no wait and were seated immediately. Not everyone in our party arrived on time, but they let us sit at a table and enjoy our waters without any pressure to order to hurry our other late guests. We had chicken and waffles, the white chocolate brioche french toast, granola and yogurt, and seared salmon. All were so delicious this first night. Chicken was juicy, french toast was AMAZING (so many berries for each bite!), salmon was tender and flavorful. 

The next day, we came back for breakfast. We decided to bring another friend since we had a great time the first time. It was busier since it was breakfast time for a restaurant that specializes in breakfast food. So we expected to wait. The line went fairly quickly. They told us 20 minutes to wait and we were seated in 15. Not bad. I told my friend about our great food the night before, so she ordered the chicken and waffles. I ordered the same french toast as before because it was too delicious not to get it again. The french toast was good but not as great as the night before. It was a bit overcooked and dry, especially around the crust. Thank goodness it had berries on it to counter the dryness. My friend's chicken was overly dry. It was pretty disappointing since it was breakfast time and you'd think the breakfast  food would be served better than during dinner time at least to keep people coming during these popular hours. Our drinks were forgotten and we had to ask for them after our food was already served. Our server was a sweetheart, though, and apologized and gave us an extra drink to make up for it. This is why I rounded up the star rating to 4 stars instead of rounding down to 3. 

I wish the food could have been more consistent. If we had the second day experience the first time we came, we probably wouldn't have recommended it to our friends. I'm not sure I'll be coming back again. Not sure the third time will be as good as the first time or as bad as the second. So many other choices to eat in Vegas. I enjoyed the service immensely, though. Try the place at least once. See for yourself. 

Summary: 
Food - inconsistent; delicious the first visit, dry and not prepared as well the second time around.

Service - very friendly; loved it

Recommendation - Hard to say. Try it for yourself. Food may be a hit or miss. Service hopefully will not disappoint, though.",UJGgSjaejyNN3_U4VFMbcw,0,1,4,aqWGCPyqcAhqAYkNc1Eu5Q

The service was great, but the food...

Food was yummy. My friend order the soup of the day, which was a sausage potato soup I believe. Let me just say that I regret not ordering this soup for myself. I had a taste of it and wanted to steal it from my friend. It was THAT good. My corn beef hash was yummy. Poached eggs, slow cooked corned beef, potato, grain mustard hollandaise was legit and lets not forget the mimosa. I was a happy camper.

the only dish I was not much of a fan BUT looked delicious to look at was the seared salmon. Roasted young potatoes, vegetables, arugula salad, lemon vinaigrette and the Soup of the day...the lobster bisque I ordered for room service. The salmon was lacking flavor and the poor dab of lemon vinaigrette tasted more like mayo. The potatoes also lacked flavor and they were a bit undercooked. The lobster bisque was lacking the lobster. I've had lobster bisque in the past and i've had pieces of lobster in my soup. Not the case with this soup.

I have to say the menu sounded good normally but I couldn't find much this time that I said I gotta have that.  Instead I had Chicken and Waffles for basically the 3rd time in four days.  It wasn't bad.  The chicken was a little overdone but certainly very enjoyable.  It was also priced very reasonably especially for Vegas. While I give it three stars I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone that's looking for a fairly quick meal.

Long targeted as a place for breakfast given the beautiful space, quality ingredients, and collection of favorites including an ever-changing 'pancake of the week' it was finally with friends in town that I sat down at The Mirage's 24/7 Pantry, a three course order marred only by the confusing menu where dashed-boxes unclearly delineate 'exclusions' to the mix & match bakery section while denoting highlights elsewhere, and not every ""Take The Best Of It - Comes with Smash Browns"" actually comes with the spuds, regardless of what the subtext says.

Offering breakfast all day, and the rest of the menu from 11a until 11p, Pantry is located at the back of The Mirage and with an open café up-front overlooking the gaming floor and a more cozy family-style dining area in back it was in the latter that we sat, a large four-top easily big enough for six set for just three soon greeted by a middle-aged waitress named Rina who dutifully pushed coffee (an excellent roast from La Colombe charged at $5 per pot, without free refills, though diners are left to discover that for themselves) before filling water and taking orders, the request for items to be coursed out loosely adhered to until it was reinforced after round two landed atop quarter-finished baked goods.

Told that the donuts could not be included in the 'mix & match' because it was ""in a box, see"" and then served only one biscuit, instead of the menu-listed two, because ""it was part of the mix & match"" as though one was supposed to infer this information for themselves, suffice it to say that at $9 the biscuit and two muffins were still a veritable bargain considering the quality and although the donut bites were a bit steep at $5 for six, the crispy sugar shell over a light brioche center was every bit as good as those at Puck's Postrio which carry a tariff several dollars more - the addition of locally sourced honey, whipped butter, and two types of housemade jam the sort of small details I'd gladly pay a premium for whether dining near home or on the Strip.

Sitting, chatting, and enjoying the first round it was less than five minutes later that a man arrived porting two plates and setting aside the muffins and donuts while informing him to put the brakes on expediting the next course it was soon in chicken and waffles alongside huevos rancheros that we partook, neither served with the 'smashed browns' advertised on the menu but both again showing the work of a confident kitchen working with quality ingredients, the crispy tortillas beneath eggs and accoutrements featuring no lack of dynamic flavors or textures while as the spicy chicken featured skin that crackled to the tooth atop a supple and aromatic waffle more than ready to sop up plenty of pure maple syrup served in a sizeable sidecar.

Transitioning back to sweets, another pot of coffee elected even after assuming the upcharge based on the menu's description, it was perhaps a gluttonous choice to pick both the pancake of the week and four-piece French Toast when eating with friends generally not the sort to indulge in such things but never one to shy away from over-ordering to experience the best of what a place has to offer it was honestly a surprise to even myself just how excellent Pantry's griddles were, the decadent custard soaked brioche cooked golden and topped with rich mascarpone plus plenty of berries featuring far more chopped chocolate than one would have ever assumed while the fluffy flapjack trio was not only topped with housemade strawberry jam and freshly sliced berries but also imbued with strawberries and cream in the batter and layered between each cake, a large dollop of whip and a small ball of ice cream added to finish perhaps a bit unnecessary, though I certainly didn't hear anyone complain.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Confounded by a menu seemingly built to confuse and up-sell with the sort of service that is trained to turn tables it is almost as if Pantry does not know just how good the food coming out of the kitchen really is, particularly for a 24-hour spot on the Strip - a bit more attention to detail from the front of house would go a long way to giving the chefs the credit they deserve.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,4,3,PZz0iDiv-2dHxi_jCGf6pw

We had a party of 4 and all of us enjoyed our meals.  Our server was very pleasant and nice.  Besides a long wait, the other thing that disappointed us was the price....$100 for 4 of us!!  Ouch!   I know everything in Vegas is expensive, but Wow!  I only had pancakes, no side of bacon.  Hubby had the 2 egg breakfast with a kids size order of pancakes, and the other 2 in our party also had eggs with bacon, potatoes and toast.  2 of us had ordered coffee, so we had a carafe of coffee on our table.  My husband really liked the little jar of strawberry jam that was on our table.  We had pastries and coffee/juice the next day at a different place...much cheaper.

The portion was pretty decent with a generous share of gravy, a decent mash potato, and a pretty good biscuit.  This dish satisfied my craving for fried chicken.  The bartenders and other staff were quite friendly that I decided to return the next day before leaving Vegas.  I got the shrimp penne.

5440353,2016-01-23,0,9-cVW8wSRoE6Nmnc7v0uUA,"Ate here often during a recent stay at The Mirage, mostly out of convenience because we were staying at the Mirage + it was the only restaurant in the hotel that's open 24/7. Overall, it was good, but it depends on what you ordered. Hubby and I had dinner and late night snacks here and I ordered breakfast to go early one morning. I also had room service from here for breakfast. The eggs and bacon had a slightly weird aftertaste, but since I didn't feel sick afterward and the dish was otherwise ok, I decided it wasn't bad. The pancakes were DELICIOUS, though (had them on 2 separate occasions). Definitely my favorite thing on the menu. Light and fluffy and on the larger side.

Things to know:
- If you're a Mirage guest, Pantry is who room service food is from
- They are located outside the guest elevators of the Mirage, next to the Samba Brazilian steakhouse
- I usually saw the longest wait line during breakfast and dinner
- They are open 24 hours
- Decor ambience was very cute, felt very homey
- Booths are huge (a plus for me!), with a small pail with napkins and utensils at the edge, nice touch
- Service was mostly good*

*My only gripe: When I went very early one morning to get an order to go with some coffee, the guy at the counter (bald guy) was a bit dismissive with me and kind of ignored/didn't acknowledge me right away (a simple ""I'll be right with you"" with a smile would've been perfectly fine if he was helping someone else). After I placed the order, I was trying to get his attention again to tell him that I'd be back, but he ignored me again. I tried waving my arms at another server who got eye contact with me, but he ignored me as well and walked away (even though he clearly saw me). I FINALLY had to flag down a female server to tell her my message, and she said she'd tell the counter guy for me (with no apology by the way!). There were a few other tables of people dining there, but only one other person ordering at the counter, so they were not so busy that they had an excuse to ignore me - AND I was not rude at all and polite/nice to everyone. THEN, when I come back to get my order, he gives it to me but forgets my coffee. When I mentioned it, he glanced back and claimed someone must've taken it (which they did not - he never gave me a coffee).

Otherwise, it's a cute place with decent eats and mostly good service.",VoO-eDoNC87qolK8Fz9yPA,2,0,3,T8RM5efwxtryv49Xc1ps1A

When the Mirage first opened, this location originally had their 24/7 cafe just like the rest of the strip. Then new management came and made it into BB King's then that concept didn't work out. So here comes the Pantry where they're open 24/7 which is very convenient right by the bank of elevators. When you're drunk and need to sober up, the Pantry is the perfect remedy to get rid of that hangover. 

Service here was spot on! We were quickly greeted and seated right away. They have self seating in the bar in case you don't want to sit in a regular table. As with every other resort are the $$$ prices on the food. It doesn't matter to me because it's all part of the Vegas strip experience. 

I ordered the spicy rub wings and flat bread. The wings were so good and flat bread was delicious even with their own brand of hot sauce. Our waiter would always check up on us to see if we wanted to order more cocktails. Even though it was pricey, I'd say it was worth it. I'll be making plans to dine at the pantry when we go back to the Mirage in August 2016. I love the Mirage!!",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,14,13,5,M7kJgCRi5vOeV6vpkBVFYQ

Service is mixed - very friendly and efficient from ordering to delivering the food, but then seemed to disappear once we were ready for the check. Be prepared to wait in line during peak hours.

I liked that the menu listed the items that could be made gluten free or vegetarian - it made for easier ordering and less chance of cross-contamination. I opted for the garden vegetable hash, which comes with nut-free basil pesto and poached eggs (no smash browns or toast) and a plethora of veggies. Portions are on the large side, so you won't leave hungry. The food was fairly tasty, but my poached eggs were overcooked, almost hard-boiled. Since we were short on time, I didn't bother to send it back, but I did miss the way the yolk should have run into the hash.

When we came into the pantry 24-hour restaurant, we were greeted, seated and given menus cheerfully and promptly. The menu was very clear and geared toward American Diner cuisine and specializing in breakfast all day long as well. We were ravenous for dinner and I ordered the braised salmon which was great. However the greatest highlight was our waitress whose name was Janel. She was so prompt, cheerful, attentive, helpful and caring about how every aspect of our meal was and it was great. The thing that I really liked the most was kind of unexpected. She said after every response to her queries about our dinner ""My pleasure"", which I love for anyone serving another person to say as opposed to today's typical ""no problem"" reply which is most commonly heard almost everywhere. Great job Janel, we'll be back tomorrow night to see you again for dinner!

I lined up in the MLife line. The front desk lady took another party ahead of everyone else in line without explanation, not good. Later, the manager explained that there were executives attending a brunch. Be careful of the greeter, they don't always pay attention to customers in line. A manager tried to address the issue but just gave us excuses and fluff about how the special party had reservations and the rest of the group was already seated in the back. That's all well and fine, just don't leave the public with the impression that they are less significant than the salaried executives.  

We tried the white chocolate brioche for an appetizer, truffle oil mac and cheese, BBQ ribs, and homemade potato chips with mushroom dip. The BBQ sauce was too sweet, too tomato pasty, and did not compliment the meat. The luke-warm cole slaw is sour and doesn't taste fresh. The biscuits are without flavor. Potato chips and dip are reasonably good but lack any inspiration to finish. 

Anything claiming to be truffle is actually just truffle oil laden. For real truffles, you have to pay more but true artisan culinary delights made with truffles but it's worth it and better than the oil sprinkled mac and mushroom dip. It's only ok but not great. 

This little eatery is trying too hard to be like the Yardbird at the Venetian Casino. But instead of eating here, eat at the Yardbird where the trip and cost are so worth it. Save your tummy and trip and pass on the Pantry.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,0,0,2,P-rdp0SSHoDuh9Nlg1DQSw

Cancelled the fries, paid and left. Following day, stopped in for lunch. Ordered a bacon cheese burger, plain with fries. Order was taken by the same server as the previous day who recognized me and assured me it would be right this time. Twenty minutes later, out comes my burger with everything on it (apart from the bacon).
