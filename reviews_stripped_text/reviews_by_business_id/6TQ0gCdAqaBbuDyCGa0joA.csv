1067023,2018-03-16,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"I am a Huge fan of chopped and was so excited to try this restaurant! I do believe that it will improve with time and fine tuning, if Scott Conant  takes reviews and criticism, in the same spirit he dishes it out on TV! Our waitress was enthusiastic but woefully inexperienced. It doesn't help that she takes the orders but doesn't deliver anything.  Our appetizers were so oily, we would have sent them back, but she never returned to ask and we were too hungry to wait.  The spinach pizza would have been great if the entire crust wasn't soaked in oil! The Octopus and rapini was soaked in oil as well. I didn't received the parmigiano cheese  nor lemon for my water,  that I asked for several times! 
 My husband's main course was the Lamb Shank. The lamb itself was cooked well
But the couscous it was served with floated in the gravy that was too soupy and Tasted too strongly of black olive. The saving grace was my pasta entre, the pacceri  (pasta tubes with lamb ragu)! Tasted exactly like my Mother's homemade sauce and the pasta was light and pillowy!
I will return for this alone. 
The final insult was the bar order. The JWB scotch on the rocks my husband ordered was not even an ounce. He ordered the next one straight up and poored it over the same ice, finally a full shot! However when received the bill he was charged and additional $3 over the in the rocks price! WTH? The waitress could not explain the descrepency and said she must have entered it wrong, but did not correct it. 
For now I would recommend you head 2 blocks down to North Italia, also homemade, better value and service!",5WaRP4D9BOjfNP4RQIwfuQ,0,0,2,mczsQRr80lXBm7pHP2f9uw
1089855,2018-02-17,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"I'm sure there will be a lot of 5 stars because Scott Conant was there. I went thinking this will be a great experience and love watching chopped. Unfortunately this experience was not good at all. We did the tasting menu. First off, it's a great amount of food and gives you a variety of items.
The first few courses were decent. Raw tuna on undressed butter lettuce was weird, polenta was amazing, octopus was above average, kale salad was good, 2 bread dishes were ok. Left you with the  ok what's next feeling. Disaster hit when our pastas arrived. Both pastas were well undercooked. Squid ink pasta was edible but had a raw pasta taste and texture. Pomodoro was inedible. Im shocked it was even served. How did the chef plating it not notice the texture?? We obviously didn't eat that course and we then waited over a half hour for our main. That's after we had already been there for 2 hours. Asked for dessert to go because simply, after 3 hours, we wanted to go. 

Tables are very close together. On two occasions I witnessed people having to help move their table so  someone could get out from the bench seat. Now to the worst part.... the icing on the cake was our server. When we first arrived, it took 15 mins for him to great us. He walked up and said do you know what you want? We quickly ordered and barely saw him. Other servers/food runners were very attentive. He dropped our bill off and walked away before I could tell him there was a comp from the casino. We had to explain it 3 times, which took another 20 minutes. Two tables next to us had comps and they didn't have issues. He finally returned and barked ""you're good, it's taken care of"" and walked off. No copy of the bill no thank you. Nothing.",EkjK5wzlcPIoaYKWcm-vyg,9,3,2,Z-XsRoX0s4nAL6M0LqkftA

We ordered the creamy polenta and grilled octopus for appetizers and lamb shank as main dish.  They did a better job with the small plates.  We had to send the lamb shank back because the cous cous was so awfully salty.  The kitchen replaced the cous cous but did not reheat the lamb shank.  Not sure if this was an oversight or the way chef wants the lamb shank to be eaten.  The radicchio and pea vines combo were also very tough and not tender at all.  The manager dropped by and asked about the cous cous but didn't apologize. 

We probably will give it another try given the restaurant is newly open and probably still working out its kinks, and furthermore Red Rock Casino Resort is one of our favorite destination.",HE1C_JR8rF8Oht4W0mGgmw,0,2,2,bPRwq0ceUmpprZH7wCebGg

We had a reservation at 5:30pm on the soft opening.  As soon as we came in, they sat us at our table and our waiter automatically asked who had the seafood allergy.  He then explained the menu and showed us which dishes was safe for my son to have.  There were 7 in our party and we had an amazing time.  From the cocktails, to appetizers, main course, side dishes, and desserts, we all enjoyed every dish we tasted.  Our girls devoured the cheesecake dessert.  We had staffs that always checked on us and made sure we were okay.

1299030,2018-04-29,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"Had a really nice meal out on their front patio while visiting with an old friend there in town.  We split a few appetizers, then each had our own meal.

The house-made Stromboli starter was filled with salami and mozzarella and served with three dipping sauces (the best of which was the garlic, followed by the pesto).  It was more of a round (loaf) shaped bread than your typical oblong style...but the filling to bread ratio was just about right.  The zucchini fritti dish was made up of thinly sliced zucchini lightly battered and fried, then served with a spicy sauce (similar to a bloomin' onion sauce).  The delicate wafers still had some ""meat"" to them and the batter made for just a hint of crispness.  It paired really well with the spicy sauce.

For my main meal I ordered their signature pasta dish, the pasta al pomodoro.  It was served with a thick (al dente) style spaghetti and a sauce similar to a vodka sauce but with slightly more tomato incorporated.  It was a really hearty plate, served a la carte.

Between the lovely weather that evening and a pretty solid meal...we both had a great time.  Would definitely return.",CcOgdfEJxgrxTAwag5k18Q,0,0,4,J6D-AB6Y_JxbOtaBxqlAvQ

Both my wife and I ordered the  Veal Milanese which turned out to be way overcooked. It was dry and almost burnt. Our waiter sent the manager over who promptly took it back to the kitchen and reordered it. The second time around it was good but not terrific. I've had much better. We passed on the dessert. We used to frequent the place when it was called Terra Rosa. We are locals. We tried it when it was called Salute and it was terrible. Obviously others thought the same way and it closed. 

End of the day....it was just OK...most likely we won't be going back. There are too many other Italian restaurants in the area that are much better - like Mastrionni's.",yQuamXhIIeQ-PVxAxk-2LQ,2,1,2,rsoiOsQ3NDSg3End9QuS8Q

I also made the mistake of ordering just the kale salad assuming it was entree style but it wasn't, it was definitely a side salad for $15 so when our waitress said that's it? I should have listened.

1427870,2018-03-06,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"We just might have a new favorite Italian restaurant in Vegas. Masso Osteria was simply fantastic. Everything from the bread to the dessert was first class. 

We started with the house made focaccia, which comes with a garlic parmesan spread. I could've killed about 4 loaves of that by myself. Next, we had the zucchini fritti with Calabrian peppers. The zucchini was sliced thin and the peppers added a really nice kick. For my entree, I had the tagliatelle with bolognese and fonduta. Without a doubt, one of the best pasta dishes and maybe one of the best entrees I've ever had. It was just that good. For dessert we tried the pear crostata with créme fraîche gelato. That was the perfect light dessert after the heavy pasta dish.

1527177,2018-03-18,2,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"We went there last night.  After explaining to our waiter about how we would like our food prepared, (such as no extra pepper on anything during the cooking process, because we have dietary concerns) he asked us if we would like any wine or other alcoholic drink.  When we told him we do not drink alcohol he asked, ""why""?  That's right.  ""Why""?  While I will never apologize for not ordering any liquor, I told him point blank that I do not drink because I simply do not enjoy the taste of alcohol.  Plain and simple.  So right off the bat we got off to a bad start. The tomato salad was fresh and very good but it arrived along with the beet salad which I assumed was to be served warm or hot since it is listed on the menu under ""wood fired sides"".  It arrived cold. Why it is listed under this category I haven't a clue.  The beets had a combo of arugula and red onions on top that were so salty that I just removed the entire amount on put it on an empty bread plate.  The beets tasted just fine but they were supposed to come with pistachios.  My idea of pistachios is that you can see visible amounts of pistachio pieces. Instead , I took out my magnifying glass and saw tiny, tiny dots of pistachios (pistachios is plural so I will guess they used at least two pistachios to make this dish) that I assume were crushed by the tires of a 747 and then handed over to a chef's helper where he counted out the amount of granules he would put on each beet.  Before our main course came out the waiter starts to clear away the table and removes the yogurt for the beets even though we aren't done eating the beets as well as the bread plates.  I told the waiter that I was considering getting more bread so he said he would bring us more.  This is the free bread that the restaurant doles out only if you ask for it.  We may have exceeded our allotment of free bread.  The waiter brought us more bread and more bread plates and said that he just got this out of the oven.  It must have been an ""easy-bake"" oven because the bread was as cold as the first batch he brought.  My wife's main course of grilled salmon was very ordinary accompanied by  rubbery mushrooms.  I got the paccheri pasta dish that was perfectly al dente but as you got down to the bottom got saltier and saltier.  Apparently the chef may have over compensated the lack of pepper with adding more salt. Finally, we got our check and paid the waiter with points we accumulated from the slot club.  When he brought us our receipt he reminded us that the total of points used...""DID NOT INCLUDE THE TIP"".  Thank you Mr. waiter.  Not only did he correctly guess that I was born yesterday but that I had never eaten out in a restaurant before.  Aside from all the unintended insults hurled our way I still tipped the waiter 20%.",Kj_RradgPJbHh7UoP89mIA,0,0,1,dMyF1U_a6o5BhfFWwbqIHA

1941766,2018-02-24,3,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"We ate at Chef Conant's Mosso Osteria for the first time last night. Here's three take aways:

1. Same delicious food from Chef Conant at more affordable prices. A+
2. The breads, pastas, and desserts are all made in house. 
3. We had a wonderful meal made even better by passionate and enthusiastic team members

We had the Recco Style Garlic Bread to start. One team member in an Italian accent enthusiastically explained that the cheese in the garlic bread is imported from Italy and comes from the milk of cattle after having walked a great distance in the alpine mountains yielding cheese that is very creamy with high fat and acidity. It felt like a scene from the TV show Portlandia, but in an exciting way it added so much meaning to the dish which was absolutely delicious. The bread was the consistency of Indian Naan and had the aforementioned imported cheese tucked between it's layers and topped with fried garlic shavings. This is a must try. The best. 

Second to come out was Zucchini Fritti. Very thinly sliced zucchini is battered, fried till crispy, and served like chips. Tossed with mint and chilies, this dish was light and flavorful. Amazing. Also a must try. 

Chef Conant's Signature dish is ""Spaghetti"" crafted with a technique to elevate 4 very simple ingredients (tomatoes, garlic, red chili flakes, fresh basil) into a flavor dense and ultra creamy sauce. Our server recommended the Pasta al Pormodoro saying it's the same recipe just called by a different name. After trying it, I do believe the pasta is different and I didn't get any heat from red chili, But if I hadn't had the original to compare it to I wouldn't have known the difference. Still a world class pasta. I will order this over and over again. 

Vegetarians, order all the dishes I just mentioned. You will not be disappointed. 

My husband ordered the Tagliatelle with bolognese & fonduta which he was really happy with. He says he will come back for more. 

The table next to us ordered the Wood Roasted Chicken. They liked it a lot and said the secret to the flavor was a dry rub. 

We had a great experience at Masso with great food and great service. It's so nice to have world class restaurants such as this off the strip and easily available to Las Vegas locals.",WBmDeZG_dGUwhG1DtotLcw,5,2,5,EMkyHweaM8FJ_SqyhrHYTw

2151559,2018-03-04,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"Ate here with wife and kids on 3/3/18 (Saturday). 

Ambiance: 4 stars; Very nice space - well lit but a little loud as the tables are tight together. 

Service: 5 stars; Staff is very attentive and friendly.  Constantly clearing used dishes and refilling drinks. They automatically bring you extra silverware when you order appetizers which is a welcome touch so you don't have to constantly be asking. 

Wine list: 5 stars; Wide range of selections by the glass and reasonably priced for a casino restaurant. They have a ""sommelier selection"" section which allows you to sample a more-expensive wine at an affordable price (I'm assuming it's a Coravin system). 

Starters: 5 stars; Ordered the garlic bread, focaccia, polenta and meatballs. The bread is fantastic - well-seasoned and fresh. There is no free bread here but that doesn't bother me - I'll pay for bread this good especially when you get three different dipping sauces on the side (caponata, kale pesto and olive oil with garlic and Parmesan.  All were delicious.) The polenta is so creamy and is infused with a wonderful bacony-smokiness. Meatballs are sausage-style which I really enjoy but is not the wife's favorite. Either way they were very tender and flavorful. 

Entrees/sides: 4 stars; I ordered the squid ink rigatoni, wife ordered the tagliatelle with meat sauce and kids each ordered a pizza. Rigatoni lacked seasoning and overall flavor. Usually squid ink noodles have that ocean brininess that enhances the seafood flavor - these noodles had none of that which is a little odd as the server did confirm that all pasta noodles are made in-house.  There is a good amount of lump crab in the dish and the fried Anaheim chilies are a nice touch but it was just lacking something.  I felt the same way about the tagliatelle - again the house-made noodles are good (aren't they always?) but the dish was just lacking salt and overall flavor.  The pizzas, however, were both delicious - crisp crust edges, excellent quality toppings and very flavorful.  The pizza with the poached egg on top is not to be missed!  Also ordered the brussels sprouts on the side along with the marble potatoes.  Sprouts were very good - nice and tender but not soggy with fried shallots on top.  Kids loved the potatoes - they're smashed and then fried which makes for a nice textural contrast between a crispy outside and creamy inside.

Desserts: 5 stars; Wife and I shared the caramel budino - again not to be missed with a perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I could have eaten five more of these (and I was full from the meal).

Intangibles: Chef Conant was in the kitchen and also walking around the dining room checking in with the diners.  It's nice to see him giving personal attention to a new restaurant in the suburbs.

OVERALL: 4.5 STARS; a very good value based on food quality (our bill was $200 before tip ($160 food + $40 beverages).  Portions are just the right size.  I really hope this restaurant is successful as it would show that the Las Vegas valley is growing up to the point that a nationally-recognized chef feels comfortable opening a location off of the strip.",KjVrhZeeKQEvbe2obo_d_Q,0,0,5,g3jiIwD0H5h13LIEUYDhOA

I also ordered the lamb which was not bad at all fell right off the bone , I enjoyed the tenderness of the meat however I didn't necessarily care for the flavor of the juice surrounding the cus cus it came with. 

The Short Rib gnocchi was great and the salmon was delicious. 

The garlic bread was just ok it wasn't too rich but more just a little dry like it needed marinara or some type of sauce to eat with with out getting tired of eating it. 

The main issue that i have and I'm not sure if it has to do with the Venue itself because I experienced the same issue with the service when the last company occupied the space. Even if the servers are on their job it always seems like they take an overwhelmingly long amount of time to bring drinks from the bar , check to the table etc. on multiple occasions at this venue I've notice the servers having maybe more of a work load than they can take on and if that's not the case the drinks at the bar are not or have not been a priority. I hate to complain I really hate to . But management needs to get this issue dialed in . This location is too convenient for me not to come back ! 15 mins with an empty beer is just way too long and every time my drink was empty it took 15 mins and an apology no exaggeration. Attention Management let's resolve this issue so i can come and spend more money with you guys ! By the time desert came my espresso was gone. (I like to eat my dessert with a nice espresso to top it off) . I understand the objective of trying to give a 5 Star fine dining experience however this place is either understaffed or the servers are not able to be attentive enough in order to provide the service a 5 Star establishment requires . I will definitely give this place another try.",Jy3MoHeefnYoUWNrWii_Ow,5,2,3,P8tFu0AN1Z65U-TKCrjEPw

The limoncello martini was bomb!!! The happy hour cab was very smooth!! The dinner however....
I hate to say I was so disappointed! The atmosphere was awesome!!! Super chill and cute and just lovely decor! The food was not so great, everything lacked flavor, even the Margherita Pizza! How can you go wrong with pizza? The $65 veal chop had a side of raw dandelion greens that were inedible! The homemade Gnodi was something I could pick up at Trader Joe's, not something at a new Italian restaurant. I had sea bass that was rubbed in tomato and it was not anything to write home about, totally lacked flavor! The pricing was pretty high and the food certainly didn't match! I was expecting fresh, yummy, exciting and totally wont be going back! North Italy was what I was expecting.... this was so not what I would pair with Scott Conant!

2571801,2018-03-05,1,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"I'm a fan of Chef Scott Conant on the Food Network. He constantly demonstrates that he knows his stuff...which is why we decided to try this place.

Conant does show that he can be a bit of a prick on Chopped, which may be why his waitstaff try too hard. Their trying too hard results in this place being frenetic and frenzied....to the point of overkill.

We had 5:00 reservations and showed up at 4:45. The hostess told us that we would be seated at 5:00. Wife decided to use the restroom, so I walked out with her, she did her thing, we walked back in at 4:55. Everybody else who had showed up early were now seated. Not a lot of people, but they sat us in almost in the center of the restaurant. We should have asked for a better table, but we had a direct view of the kitchen which was pretty cool.

The waitstaff are friendly...and, there are so many of them. We had our waiter, multiple servers, the guy who popped out with the pepper grinder a minute before we needed him...we asked him to come back, which he never did. Two random dudes, one with a sportscoat, jeans and tennies and another with a pompadour that would have made James Brown jealous.  

We had someone stop by our table about every 4 or 5 minutes. Too many. Too much. Too often. 

The food was GREAT.  (I have to add that even with all of the staff, food took a while to get to us.)

Appetizers
Creamy Polenta. Seriously amazing
Classic Meatball - fair
Antipasto Salad - Awesome. Dressed perfectly

Dinner
Wife - Cedar Roasted Sea Bass. WIfe is still talking about this. That good.
Me - Tagliatelle. Some of the best Pasta I've ever had.

...and a couple glasses of wine. Their wine selection is top notch.

Not only can they now gossip about the newest celebrity chef cooking down the street from their abode but the food and service at Masso will live up to their ""oh my gawd, let me tell you about the fabulous dinner I had"" tales at the water cooler on Monday.  There are only a handful of dining establishments that do ""Italian proper"" in Las Vegas and I can proudly say Chef Scott delivers here.  Our meal started with being sat in the corner which normally I would be offended since my name isn't Baby, but the venue was absolutely packed so I was just stoked to get a seat.  Normally I would be very weary of a brand new restaurant being so full with eager customers as we had a movie to catch in 90 minutes, but the service and food timing was perfect so we didn't have to rush on any of the  courses.

Our server was incredibly knowledgeable regarding the menu and offered fantastic suggestions. We started with the Tuna Crudo, the Kale Salad, the Polenta and the Octopus.  All four were strong offerings and I would order each again.  The Tuna has a good dose of heat. The Kale was seasoned to perfection. The Polenta....ah mi amor. I would write a book on that if I could but it would mostly be made up of drool and caloric dirty thoughts. The octopus was incredibly tender and spot on.

For entrees we ordered the massive veal parmigiana to share and our guest ordered the regular veal chop.  The veal parmigiana had a great presentation as they paired the giant Barney Rubble type chop with a cute arugula salad that paired well. Each crunchy bite combined with the healthy dollops of burrata created a velvety pleasure that one should not live without.  

Word of mouth alone does not do this meal justice. You have to try it for yourself as you would be doing your stomach a disservice by not imbibing on the cocktails (and reasonably priced wine list) and tickling your gastronomy bones as you inhale the perfectly cooked veal parmigiana.

Great job from top to bottom. Can't wait to come back and bring my tooth brush so I can brush my teeth with the polenta 'cause it's that damn good.",NppW9SFDMKioUAx_87QQhw,3,3,5,RLOcvTuNsfnDHlVlRlfsaw

We started with drinks (I like it!). I had a bourbon based cocktail called lalna, while my friend had a summerlin spritz.  We then moved on to appetizers by ordering the creamy polenta with bacon on the side (my friend doesn't eat bacon) and the wood roasted octopus. The octopus was tender and quite tasty. The polenta was very creamy and had good flavor, but felt more like a side dish to me. For entrees, I ordered the lamb shank and my friend ordered the grilled salmon.

I was so excited to come here because I am a huge Scott fan and I am a Chef myself. So me and my GF came here. Sat down and we ordered the garlic bread with the cheese appetizer and it wasnt anything great. We ordered 2 drinks, my GF got some whiskey drink and i got a Masso Mojito, her drink was ok, my drink literally tasted like mouth wash and it had no alcohol in it at all. So we ordered the Beef tartare and the Polento with bacon, truffle and mushrooms. Honestly the Beef Tartare was was amazing 10 out of 10. The polento came out and my girlfriend thought it was vomit, it was super waterly and had no flavor. There was absolutely no truffle in there at all. We told the waitress and she said let me get you another one, the second one was worse than the first one, no flavor and no truffle. For an entree she got the gnocchi and i got the squid ink pasta. Her gnocchi was overcooked and had no salt on it, flavorless and the clams were so fishy it was making her gag. My blackink pasta was one of the worst bowls of pastas I've ever had. Also there was a group of 4 women next to us and they were screaming and cursing loud as hell. Obviously they don't goto nice restaurants very often because they had no manners and the waitress did nothing about it. Im sorry chef Scott but this was very disappointing. I dont understand why people go so crazy over a restaurant because a famous chef has made the menu.

Located in Red Rock Casino Masso Osteria is easily accessible and you don't even have to enter the casino. A perfect night we opted for a table outside.
Know for his pasta dishes we split the two of them to start the meal and then had some main courses and dessert.
- Potato Gnocchi served with clams(out of shell) guanciale and tomato. Gnocchi were perfect, light pillows of dough. I would have enjoyed them more with another sauce. The clams were still gritty and that made this dish not so appealing.
- Paccheri Large tube like pasta with a neapolitan meat ragu & caciocavollo cheese. This was the right dish to order. Ragu had perfect amount of tender meat and tomato sauce with a generous amount of the cheese. I am definitely going back for this dish!!
-wood roasted chicken. This was another dish that had potential but just May have been executed wrong. Expecting the skin to be crispy we were disappointed that it came out chewy in texture. Flavors were good and the mixed vegetables were a nice side but the skin should have had that crispness from the wood fired oven
-The D.O.C.G pizette was topped with fonduta, truffles & poached egg. Thin and crispy, the dough was perfect and a poached egg on pizza, yes I was all in on this one. Very rich flavor, almost like a buttery taste, I enjoyed this pizza.
- Salted Caramel Budino. A custard like dish with a hazelnut crumble and fresh whipped cream with one of the best salted caramels I have tasted. This dessert was an excellent way to end the meal

She got us a really nice and friendly waitress and they brought us out some appetizers on the house and bought our first round of drinks. 

The positives were the place has a great feel and looks amazing. Manager was very attentive and we appreciated the efforts she made to get us back. 

Food was actually very good but portion sizes were small for the prices. I understand we are in Summerlin but I would suggest lowering prices or increasing the portion sizes. We really liked the beet side, garlic bread  and gnocchi. The sea bass was also very good. 

I think there is a lot of promise here but service kinks need to be worked out it seemed confused and we noticed others having some service issues. I guess this is too be expected when a place is new but the owner has multiple restaurants so this really should not be an issue. 

I have it a three star rating just based on service issues and value for what you pay. I think they will have to step up their game to compete in the Summerlin food scene as there are so many great places within 10 minutes of this restaurant. 

We really wanted to like it a lot more and we will probably go back at some point but I think we will let them work out the issues.",FS-FWEFgKlF3ITABs9hJYg,2,0,3,D5HMZ5vfNXFIXkvS9AeHfw

3968757,2018-04-10,5,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"Having been open a couple of months, I decided it was time to give Masso a try.  The restaurant by Scott Conant took the place of Salute at Red Rock.  I went on a ""Senor Wednesday"" night when dinner is half price when you pay with points.

I had a reservation and was promptly greeted.  After a couple was seated, the woman took me to the patio area and I sat at a two top along the glass with a view of the small pond and mini waterfalls at the front of Red Rock Casino.  It was a lovely evening.  I noticed that they had installed mister fans for the warmer days coming and there were heaters for the cold ones that are leaving us.

I was soon approached by my server, Annemarie, and she took my iced tea order.  She also brought me a box of complimentary bread with an oil, garlic, and broccoli rabe mixture for use on the bread or for dipping the bread.  Annemarie was helpful in letting me know what dishes were suitable for a solo diner.  I ordered the creamy polenta (Polenta Boscaiol) for a starter and the whole sea bream for my main course.

The polenta was amazing!  Perfectly done and just the right amount for me.  It could also be shared by two.  Then came the sea bream which was very large.  Two filets on a bed of lemon, caper, olive oil, and kale.  There was a considerable amount of garlic also something I liked a lot.
I generally don't order fish but I am not a salmon eater for the most part and the sea bream was just right.  Besides, I didn't want a veal chop that is large enough to kill someone if you hit them with it.

The dinner was served at a leisurely pace.  My iced tea was replaced with a fresh glass several times.  It then came time for dessert.  There were two things on the menu that I wanted to try and I went with the pear crostata with crème fraiche ice cream.  It was very good and a good ending to the meal.

Masso was quite crowded when I left after 7 but there were always tables available on the patio.  I'll be back especially on those special Wednesdays.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,10,4,oA0arWL86RrUJnO3dzM1Sw

4768456,2018-04-17,2,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"TLDR: Two stars for the excellent service provided by our server and food. Lower overall rating due to the way my restaurant reservation was mishandled and due to the unsatisfactory response from the restaurant Management when I brought it to their attention.

We made a reservation for 07:00pm and requested a booth for a party of 4. The reason for requesting a booth was, we have a child in our party and our child is still jet-lagged as we have travelled from East coast and tends to lie down at this hour (10:00pm EST). We showed up on time, and when I said we have a reservation for 07:00pm, the hostess stand looked surprised. They said, let me show you a table and let us know if you like it. They showed us a 16 capacity (8 on each side) tall stool-top seating area which was not acceptable to us. Reading other reviews I have now learnt that they offer this seating to those *without* reservation. They then asked us to wait until they could get us a booth. They said wait for 10 minutes at the other end of the restaurant. At 07:15pm, they didn't have a booth and they showed us seating with 4 chairs which we couldn't take for the reason mentioned above. While standing near the 4 chair area, I noticed an empty half booth half chair seating right across and asked to be seated there instead. The hostess said it was reserved for a 09:00pm reservation. At this point I said to her, we also have a reservation and we are here, why can't you give it to us? And why isn't anything reserved for us in a similar fashion.

I spoke to the manager and she was unapologetic. She essentially said the reservations are just ""luck of draw"". She said, restaurant honored our reservation by offering us the tall stool-tops. She even said ""some kids do like to seat on the stool tops!"". I asked her why can't they give us that half chair - half booth. Manager said they will need those beginning at 09:00pm. I asked why at 09:00pm and she relayed the same information that there was a reservation for it. And I said to her - ""exactly my point"". We also have a reservation. For us it was the ""luck of draw"" and for the 09:00pm party you are holding the seats since 07:00pm.

We got seated at 07:30pm at a different half chair half booth combination. The food and the service offered by the servers was excellent. Manager on the other had no sympathy and admitted no fault.",d3V4vXK1RPymFEshVYrlNQ,1,2,2,hq464uYul5B-4rElTsHmGg

5181426,2018-03-21,2,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"Hello and welcome to Masso Osteria. We have been seeing several commercials for this place all over so we decided it was our time to try it. I am a big fan of Chef Scott and was looking forward to dining here. We had made reservations and requested a high top table. The High top was sat in the bar area which was an excellent area and we could see the whole restaurant. It also seemed quieter than the busy low section. We were sat right away and our drink order was taken. Our waitress Kaccee was an excellent host for our first time here and did a great job with recommendations and guiding us through the menu. She explained and we did not take warning that many of the dishes were meant to be shared. (That is your warning). She definitely knew the menu. They have great beer and wine selections and our water glass was always full. We caught part of the happy hour which has great beer and wine options. 
Food, we decided on appetizer of Recco Style Garlic Bread. Picture a Quesadilla with bread. Thin buttery bread with  Stracchino cheese. A great substitute for Mozzarella cheese. The bread was cut into six triangles and was gooey and melty as you pulled it away from the plate. I think I may have found a new cheese. As for taste, crisp bread, buttery and garlic rich. As an appetizer it was filling , but we reserved some for a midnight snack. We also ordered the Tuna Crudo for an additional app. Located in the salad section of the menu, but for us it ate as more of an appetizer. nice fresh pink tuna on a bed of lettuce with lemon and pickled fresno chilis with breaded-crumbled jalapenos. We ate them as sort of a lettuce wrap for a spicy, sour and crispy one or two bite finger salad. There were many other things that looked and sounded amazing as we saw them go by our table. I can't wait to try more menu items. 
Main course. Josie had the Paccheri. A more supple Penne style pasta, with a Neopolitain ragu. This was quite meaty and had that pinkish hue that may come from cooking in a red wine. The bite I had was a meat filled bite and cheesy. It did not have the normal Tomato taste or after taste of say a bolognese would have. Very good and my first time having that type of Ragu sauce. I had fish. My choice was the Sea Bream. If you are saying,what is that. So was I . I am glad I ventured into the unknown and ordered this amazing fish dish. So this is a white fish and I will not say its like a halibut because it is not. It is also not Bass. What is though is very good. This comes with two big pieces that fill this big pan. I could tell this is normally a quite plump fish as i came out with two pieces laid on a crisp bed of kale with capers and a roasted lemon for seasoning. A succulent, white and flaky fish that just melted in your mouth. The skin was buttery and crispy and when you add the perfectly cooked Kale underneath that also added a crispness to each flavorful bite. I took the first bite and was amazed, but then added the roasted lemon for a slight tartness that just added to how delightful this fish was. Order it but don;t add a side dish unless sharing. We had the fingerling potatoes with fresh grated mozzarella on top. they were very good but I paid more attention to my fish. We took a to go plate because there was so much food for just us two. Plus we needed dessert. 
Dessert.....I had a Banana Bread with Vanilla Ice cream on top. A dense desert that definitely topped off my meal in an excellent way and made me quite full. Josie had a Tiramisu. Well, their deconstructed version. this version has the cookie on the bottom with drops of Mascarpone cheese around the edges with a dollop of Vanilla and chocolate ice cream.There were these little dots of coffee  that help get that Tiramisu flavor you are used to and an added Toffee drizzle. I will add photos later. 
Thank you for Dining at Masso Osteria. If you couldn't tell I will be going back. again our server Kaccee was amazing and very helpful. From what i could tell all the staff have a great knowledge of what Chef Scott has put together. I can highly recommend going here. It is busy so make reservations. Go please and have a great meal. Value for amount of food was pretty good. If you go with a group will probably be better so you can share the various dishes.",QtuzG4-zmGTdB0jSMC54tg,3,3,5,wwx8-yritNhXhti1YbzVMA

Exposed brick walls meet modern white marble with an open kitchen that's vibrant and at the center of is all. The bar is bright with high top communal tables and blends seamlessly into an outdoor space. The patio is cooled by misters and accented with bright greens and turquoise giving it a Miami vibe.

My girlfriend took me last night for my birthday. We nestled into a dark brown tufted booth tucked into a dark back corner. The perfect vantage point for taking in a long meal.

The service was on point in every way. 100%


We took our waiter's suggestion and tried the tasting menu. Five courses each with several small plates, it was amazing. Highlights were the oil poached octopus, gnocchi with clams (already de-shelled which was nice), the crispy chicken, and a surprise grapefruit sorbet. It was such a feast we came come with so much leftovers. Yay! 

Five courses for $65/pp. can't beat it.


Chef Scott happened to be in town. He seemed really engaging with all the staff and patrons. He took time to chat & take pics with so many folks including us. He even came back to serve us dessert complete with birthday candles.

(We weren't fans of his before, but we are now.)

5376816,2018-04-20,0,6TQ0gCdAqaBbuDyCGa0joA,"The only reason why I am giving one star is because the only good/easy thing about this place was making a reservation which I made thru open table. My husband and I are huge fans of Scott Conant and we were so excited to try this place. I read some of the reviews before making the reservation and I was a bit skeptical but we decided to give it a try! Our reservation was @ 8pm on a Monday night to celebrate our anniversary. The restaurant was not even busy. We arrived thru the patio entrance, and we were greeted by a nice young lady. Shortly after, we were seated in a very awkwardly shaped 4 top in a walkway next to a server who was polishing his glassware. We didn't say anything about the awkward table as she gave us the menus and walked away. I literally felt like I had to shout for my husband to hear me. About 10 minutes later a gentleman came up and I suppose he was our server. He never introduced himself, and he didn't bother asking if this was our first time dining here? He simply asked would you like flat or sparkling water? Once he came back to pour the water, we didn't see him for another 10 minutes. No acknowledgement, no explanation of the menu, not even a wine menu was offered. The extra place settings on our huge table were not even removed. It looked like we were still waiting on half of our dinner party. When the server came back, (I would give a name if he ever offered one) he asked what would we like to drink? How about introducing yourself, asking if we are celebrating something?  Right then and there My husband and I got up and we went next door to Yard House. Luckily our server Kayla was wonderful and we were able to still enjoy our night. What a disappointment this place was, we were really looking forward to enjoying our anniversary and trying some delicious food. If you ever decide to try this place out, hopefully you have a much better experience and if not, there are plenty of other great options around there with much better service.",xFfGeGL0VBoKrFtM-gE7TQ,1,1,1,69tYVQefhR-6TvF7tXiOxg

It is by far the worst meal we have ever had in the five years we have lived in Vegas. 

The staff was super kind and working hard despite how busy the restaurant was.

If this restaurant is open for more than a year I will be shocked.

The pastas are thick and heavy, dressed in flavorless watery sauces that need salt amongst much more and served luke warm.

The beet salad also has no dressing so you literally are eating beat and arugula with a few pistachios chopped and sprinkled on.  The goat cheese to beet ratio is like 1 to 100.

The polenta is served like a watery soup IT however did have some interesting flavor profiles if you could get past the fact you were drinking it.

The cocktail I ordered was awful so I figured a simple gin and tonic couldn't be messed up.  I was wrong the tonic was so flat I couldn't drink it either.",SbhRBLCSq-tdz6GA_7-7pw,3,1,1,s3cN3cFLC1v4IABX-6LVIg

Our waiter came by quickly and took our drink orders.  Mom had the mojito.  She really liked it.  I had the L'AMARA PESCA - Campari, white peach & passion fruit puree, thyme, Prosecco.  It was very refreshing and light.

We started with the RECCO STYLE GARLIC BREAD - wood fired with stracchino.  This was so good.  Almost like a quesadilla with thin layers of bread between lots of cheese and garlic.  I would go back just for this.

Mom had the VEAL CHOP ""PARMIGIANA - dandelion greens, pickled onions, tomatoes & burrata.  She enjoyed it but the serving was way too big.  And really $65!?  That is ridiculous when everything else on the menu is in the $30s.  I had the BONELESS VEAL CHOP MILANESE with arugula salad.  This was very tasty and I loved the arugula salad but it was $62.  Again too much.  Not sure why their veal dishes are a good $20-25 over everything else.  They need to fix that.  Maybe serve smaller portions as they are too big anyway.

For dessert, mom had a scoop of cherry gelato.  It had a nice cherry flavor.  I had the STICKY TOFFEE BANANA PUDDING with cookie crunch & coffee cardamom gelato.  The pudding was really good, almost like a bread pudding.  Not a strong banana flavor though.  More just a nice vanilla flavor.

When I heard Masso was coming the Red Rock, I was extremely excited as one of Chef Scott's other recusants here in Vegas is my favorite! So of course I had high hopes and exceptions..... happy to say that our experience here was just as fabulous and did not disappoint. Not to mention we got to see Chef Scott as he was at the restaurant for the opening. So cool! 

Masso is located inside of Red Rock Casino.There are plenty of parking options including valet, self parking garage and surface parking offered by the casino.

I made a reservation earlier in the month when they began taking them, upon arriving to the restaurant the atmosphere was very nice, the decor is very welcoming, warm and enjoyable. We arrived right about 7p and the host staff was very friendly and kind and we were promptly seated at our table. Once at our table we met our server, who was very attentive and on top of his game! In speaking with him and getting to know him, he moved out here to Vegas from Phoenix to assist with the opening of this restaurant. Great service and staff always on top of anything we needed and a keen attention to detail. 

We started with a bottle of the Slingshot cabernet ($50), which was a nice selection and enjoyable wine. For our food selections we wanted to try everything, but we just cant do that in one night! So here is what we tried.... 

Recco Style Garlic Bread ($11) which is two pieces of wood fired flat bread with garlic and stracchino cheese melted in between.  

Wood Roasted Prawns ($22) prawns are roasted with a calabrian chili butter and served over cous cous.

Pasta al Pomodor ($21) deliciously cooked pasta with a signature tomato sauce and fresh basil. (OMG you have to get this! Simply perfection!)

Cedar Roasted Whole Sea Bass ($31) perfectly roasted sea bass served with grilled vegetables.

Mascarpone Cheesecake ($11) served with huckleberry compote and a crumble.

Knowing this location has previously failed, why would Red Rock put something that caters to locals? That being said if you plan on trying this place. Don't bring your appetite but bring plenty of money.",XKJN0p-whnE9yx4tDnhZxw,5,1,2,e_gJgmx1e2tbPQrx2FrnwA

You get to taste the best of his menu for a fraction of the full price. 5  Stars    this is a big hit. Got plenty of leftovers to take home, but still can't wait to go back and have some more. The service was outstanding. Our servers were great. Caesar's is a stand out server. His knowledge about both food and wine was impressive. The pasta dishes were very Al Dente aka undercooked, but nothing I could not handle. I kind of eat the sauce and leave most of the pasta anyway. I'm sure that will fix that quickly. Glad to have this new option at one of my favorite local casinos.",ZNCU9UFTa_UWmkwMztkEbA,0,0,5,L3u0o7yVQBs5MG4PYMhY_A
