He didn't even say hi to us. Just said how many today? The restaurant was pretty Empty being 230 In the afternoon on a Monday. We were sitting for 5 minutes and still no server. Another table got sat at this time and a server came right over to them. Still ignoring us. We continued to sit for another 5 minutes while the other table that came In 5 minutes after us had already gotten drinks and their order taken. I got up and asked the host if we could get a server. He said yeah then just stood there at the stand. We ended up grabbing our menus and sitting in the bar area instead. The manager walked by a few times ignoring us too. Then sat down in a table not too far from us and started eating lunch. Still no service at this time. We've been in there for 16 min now. Our server eventually came over and the service was okay. He was very monotone and not too thrilled to be there either. When I asked if we could have some bread he snapped back at me saying ""yeah give me a minute to heat it up!"" When we had already waited about 12 minutes after ordering. My boyfriend ended up sending his steak back. And getting his food to go. This will be our last time at this location.

Of course I don't expect $10 steak to be an example of perfection but I at least expect it to be edible. I ordered it medium but it came out absolutely medium rare. I struggled with cutting a first piece and I couldn't even chew it... it was just plain inedible. Wife ordered medium well and it came out medium. French fries looked soggy like they were sitting in a bin for a while. I sent my plate back and even though establishments attempted to give me a replacement meal I denied.

Our bartender was also our foodserver and just really didn't have a handle on good customer service. The bar was dirty with crumbs everywhere. The service was painfully slow. When my wife ordered a second glass of wine, which took forever to actually order it, the bartender just dumped more wine from a small carafe into her dirty glass. When our food came mine was ok, not fantastic, but was as expected. We had appetizer plates and such in front of us that were empty but not removed which caused the food runner to have to ask another waiter for assistance to remove them when all this could have been accomplished had the bartender been trained correctly. My wife's steak was tough to the point she only ate a small portion of it. They did take it off the bill but that's still not a good dining experience for us.

I had never eaten at an Outback before and was a little leery... I dont care for eating at chain restaurants....but very glad we did.. (we had actually planned on eating at the bistro at Siena golf course, but it was closed for a private party.. Lucky us!)

 We had the stuffed mushroom appetizer, excellent, then both of us ordered the steak and lobster. (I ate both lobster tails, he ate the steak).  We typically would go to Sedona, Tbones or  McCalls for  this type of meal, (and pay the price!)  but we took a chance and glad we did...My lobster was perfect, and his steak was outstanding.  The baked potatoes were just right (last time at McCalls they were not fully cooked). I always like just butter and sour cream on the side, and though they say ""all the fixings"" on the potatoes, they do accommodate

A little hint... If one of you wants steak, and the other lobster, do what we did and order the combo.... Saves $$...

As for the meal - wow has your prices increased!!! Steak which was my husbands - was subpar ( used to be great) was over 30.00 and tough. Your choices of sides are sectioned out and had choices of premium which cost more. ( ding, upcharge!) 
Nickel and dime ing is exhausting!!!  I ordered the steak salad - so much smaller than it used to be! Looked like lunch portion with hardly any tomatoes, less crunchy pecans ( where were they?) and the steak was very tough.

Okay easy fix but it gets worse... Well our server finally takes our order of which we wait another 40 minutes before we are served. 
Total time from being seated to getting the main course was over an hour and 30 minutes...
We should have left but it was late and we were all tired and hungry. Finally we see our waitresses with our food. You guessed it. The complete order was wrong. How do you bring chicken out when we ordered steak? And then say, ""sorry it's chicken, it that okay? The chicken is just as good as the steak"". We also ordered a salad that was ordered without dressing and it came to the table soaked in dressing. We also ordered an 8oz steak that was 5 oz at best... What a shame.

I ordered the crabcakes, which was ok but really salty. My sister had the parmasean pasta, which she said tasted great. My niece (4yrs old) had the kid's meal of mac n cheese and my nephew (2yrs old) had the grilled chicken and fruits. My brother in law had the porter house steak which he said was overcooked, dry and lacked seasoning. He was very disappointed with his meal. To make matters worse, my nephew got a pretty bad scratch on his right arm from our table! The hard laminate was peeling off the edges of our round table and a sharp part was sticking out, nicking my nephew's arm. My sister alerted our server, who notified the manager. Two managers stopped by our table. One asked what she could do for us. My sister explained what happened and pointed out the sharp edges. The other manager, Laura, took down my sister's name, phone number, address and a statement of what happened. She said it was for insurance purposes. When we asked for the bill, we were disappointed that the managers didn't take off my nephew's meal ($5.99) for his troubles. My sister didn't want to make a bigger fuss about it because at that point my nephew and niece were already tired and wanted to go home.

This Sunday I went there with my wife, and we ordered dishes with onion soup. No big deal so far, until the soup came, with THE CHEAPEST IN THE MARKET BLACK PLASTIC SPOONS. I  made a joke and showed the plastic spoons to the server..""You guys are loosing the glamour"" the server said: ""I am sorry, I guess they did not have any clean ones back there""..She did replace the spoons with regular metal silverware with the respective apologies which were accepted...How strange!.Such a well known franchise compromising its quality and service that way. Was it an innocent mistake? Was it a miss-judgement by a careless new employee?, or was it a deliberate attempt to offend us?.

With that said, I like the ranch at outback. And they refrigerate their salads before serving, so it's also the right amount of cold. Unfortunately for them, this isn't enough to justify the price tag. 

The second good thing: the wallaby darned drink with a floater shot of chambord. It's like a grown up version of the fuzzy naval, but better. I'm not even ashamed to order it by name sober. Apparently this isn't a normal menu item anymore (darn), but that didn't stop the bartender from turning on the blender and making me this drink. Yay!

As for the food quality. At $100 per couple, after drinks and a tip, you can find a better steak elsewhere. My personal fave alternative is herbs and rye for similar price point. The last time we went to outback I ordered the filet and lobster tail. The lobster was good, but I'm convinced anything dipped in butter has a place in my heart. The steak was bland & needed steak sauce. It wasn't worth the caloric tradeoff & I as I finished my meal I couldn't help but think we should've gone elsewhere. This is the feeling I get every time I leave outback - but I'll be damned if the ranch and fruity drinks don't make me come back a couple of times a year for this reminder.",FqrJdXN2hmKOurdNsKU5Nw,1,1,3,DrQochk6VxbTQEoZ3_OEvw

There was no wait at 5:30pm when we arrived, so we were seated right away. Our server Philip was a gem. He immediately brought us waters and hot bread shortly after we sat down. I love the bread here, it's soft and delicious and comes hot to the table with delicious butter. While we looked at the menu, I ordered the famous Bloomin' Onion for an appetizer. For my dinner I chose the 6oz filet mignon with lobster, a Caesar salad and a loaded baked potato. He chose the 20oz porterhouse steak, a cup of the cheddar potato soup, and a loaded baked potato.

It wasn't long before the onion arrived, complete with their signature horseradish sauce. Philip even brought us an extra cup of sauce without me having to ask. The onion was cooked perfectly. The breading on the outside was crispy and full of spice, and the onion was soft and delicate on the inside. We ate the whole thing. Our soup and salad arrived next. The Caesar salad was well dressed with some of the best croutons I have ever eaten. Ironically there was a sign on the wall saying the croutons are made by hand everyday. You can taste the love in these croutons, they were soo good. By the time our entrees arrived, I was just about stuffed. Bread, onion, salad! That alone could have been a meal in itself. But I stuffed my face with steak and lobster and it was delicious. The filet was cooked perfectly medium as requested, and was soft like butter. I didn't even need steak sauce! The lobster was succulent and sweet and melted in my mouth. My only gripe is I wish there were more of it.

I have never been to this location before but think of Outback as decent steak chain restaurant at affordable price. On this night decided wanted to mix it up also instead of going for steak had the Grill Mahi with vegetables.I had my doubts cause really go steakhouse eat steak. I was pleasantly surprise with the whole dish. The Mahi was grilled perfect nice char grill marks, cooked through, moist, and even without sauce had great taste. The vegetables was all cooked nice al dente from the zucchini, carrots, and broccoli. 

We ordered couple appetizers to share the calamari and the spinach artichoke dish. The calamari dish would say was ok. I felt like the calamari was little too crispy or overdone. The spinach artichoke dip would say was fabulous. The chips was nice light, crispy, and add nice scoop of spinach dip was delicious. The bread that comes with the meal. One thing always look forward to whenever come to Outback. Love it!!! I also ordered side caesar salad. I felt was ok nothing really special about it and felt like the salad could have used more dressing. But then again I like my salad with nice amount.

The service was great! She was very attentive the whole night on our drinks, friendly, and could not ask for better service. 

The decor thought was pretty modern for long standing chain restaurant. Or maybe they just changed the whole philosophy or what not. All  I remember the last time been to a Outback been that long years. It had this cheesy over the top Australia look but from the moment you walk in very modern. I like the look more then the old look makes U feel like eating not so much at whole wide chain type of restaurant.

Doesn't help that every time this certain nascar driver comes in under 15th or something place they send us an email for a free blooming onion. Lucky us! Keep winning!, they sent out coupons all the time, and the specials. 

3 course meal for $12, I will take it. Soup or salad, steak with one side and ending the meal with two different types of cheesecakes. Perfect. But then again I always go for the combos which range in price. I get the ribeye for 26, it's always perfectly cooked with the tender meat and tasty fat. I upgrade my one side to asparagus and keep the other, a Caesar salad. You can really taste those anchovies. Fresh, crunchy and you can tell they bake their own croutons. 

Price is perfect, especially if you do a special or have a coupon. I've tried a variety of the dishes... Ribs. Shrimp Alfredo. Alice springs. All are winners and I can't stop myself from the free brown bread they give out, just ask for extra butter.

2797692,2017-03-27,0,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"So dissatisfied with my waiter and the manager Doug. My boyfriend and I stopped in the restaurant yesterday afternoon for an early dinner. I chose Outback Steak house because I was craving pasta real bad . My boyfriend also wanted pasta but with shrimp. He ordered the Queensland pasta with chicken and shrimp. I ordered the loaded potato soup to start with because I was extremely hungry. The pasta I ordered was no longer offered on the menu it comes with chicken and seasonal vegetables. When my soup came out it was really salty. Both pastas were also extremely spicy and not good at all. My boyfriend specifically told our waiter ahead of time that he needed his pasta pretty plain with no seasoning even the chicken and shrimp because he's on a special diet and diagnosed with diverticulitis. He couldn't even see his shrimp because of all the Cajun seasoning that was all over it . He was damn near choking and he had to stop eating it due to concern that his blood pressure would spike. I couldn't take any more bites of mind either it made my nose run and I was coughing. I usually can take a little heat or spice but this was just awful. We asked our waitress to take the food back we were soo disappointed and asked to speak to the manager. The manager came to our table and told us the biggest excuse that didn't make sense, He advised us that corporate told the cooks to add more seasoning because customers were complaining about not having enough seasoning on their food. WTH? Dumb excuse did he think we were stupid what an insult to our intelligence. That's not the icing on the cake he told us to try Bells Bar B Q on the east side of Las Vegas . He kept telling us over and over to try them they have Amazing bar b q and tell them Dougie Fresh sent you - I can't make this up he was the spokesperson for Bells Bar b Q but the manager for Outback . Why would you recommend a competitor smh - We ended up after all the madness only being offered a credit for the two pastas but I was charged for my soup . Bad part is they had unlimited soup and salad for $6.99 that wasn't even mentioned or offered by our waitress . My boyfriends phone has an app that notifies him at any restaurant what specials are offered . She dropped the ball also. We ended up leaving and going to the nearest Smiths Grocery Store to get my boyfriend some fresh salmon and shrimp . I ended up getting fresh rotini pasta from the deli. Very dissatisfied with our meals and don't ever go back to Outback something's definitely Off . The food isn't good anymore .

This is after almost a decade where the prices have steadily increased by 60-70%.  Alice springs chicken cost $10 or $11 at one time.

The appetizer piece is probably the biggest to-go deal breaker.  When people have a choice between regular and small, you have to have a threshold of how much goes in what and not just random quantities in a to-go box.  The one they used was even smaller than the usual tins they use.  As someone that has really supported the Outback corporation, it seems that will no longer happen.

Speaking as someone who spent the first 34 years of his life growing up in Australia, I can categorically tell you that there is nothing even remotely ""Australian"" about the menu items at Outback. Yes, you can get ""Fosters"" beer, a beer sold almost exclusively for export and exceedingly unpopular in Australia, but if you ask an Australian what a ""Bloomin' Onion is you'll receive a blank stare - This is AMERICAN food.

I ordered some baby back ribs and a bloomin onion and my wife some sort of pasta dish.

The food was absolutely disgusting - My ribs were very fatty and underdone and drenched in far too much of their sickly sweet sauce. fries were overcooked and dry.  

The famous ""Bloomin Onion"" was so greasy I felt like I'd eaten a few tablespoons of pure lard after eating only a small portion of the thing.

3425005,2014-09-02,0,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"Okay as I write this review, I am a little confused but I'll get to that in a bit.

I understand Outback is not a 'great' Steakhouse so let's get that out of the way. As a chain my experience is that they are very consistent, medium prices and  decent food. That being said, it is my mother's FAVORITE place so when we got together in Vegas, we all decided that we'd be taking my mother to her fave eatery.

First, an order of drinks. One frozen margarita with salt, one on the rocks with no salt. The waitress repeated the order and left. A while later the waitress brought our drinks but with no salt anywhere. My mother isn't a wave maker and so let it go. The waitress to her credit did realize the error (at the table instead of at the bar)and offered to correct it but Mom declined.

We placed our orders with all of us getting entrees that were combined with endless shrimp. Three steaks all medium rare, one chicken. Two salads: one with onions, one without. As we were ordering, another table was seated next to us. Shortly, the waitress returned with a tray including our salads as well as the drinks for the new table next to us and bread. Our salads were apparently prepared by the bartender because, as with the salt on the margs, onions were omitted from both. She dropped off our salads and turned to the other table and gave them their signature OB bread on a board, we got nada. 

Originally we weren't going to ask for the lost onions but once we saw we also weren't getting the bread we decided to ask. We got her attention after she took the other table's order and asked if we had to special order the bread. She said no, it's on the way. ""Oh"", I said "" but you brought theirs"" And she says ""yes, yours is coming."" Okay, we were there first but whatever. The bread came out in a bit along with the missing onions, so everyone at the table could at least be eating something.

Before the person who had to wait for her onions could finish her salad, the meals arrived. I cut into my steak and it was extremely tough. It was cooked properly though which can be tricky for a place like OB. All were tough. I cut off a piece, put it in my mouth and....nothing. The 'famous' Outback spice blend that is normally on the steak was nowhere to be seen. It was bland. I put a little salt and pepper and took another bite and chewed for days. My mother was still struggling to get through her first piece with the knife.

Again, I know we were not at the best steakhouse but I've been going to OB long enough to remember when the New York strip was called the Ayers Rock Steak and the shrimp on the barbie was served on the yummy bread slice so I have something to compare. My mother was unhappy, my steak isn't good at all and the third steak being the small 5oz just plowed on through and focused on her flow of shrimp. We call the waitress over and explain about the the steaks being very tough and bland. My mother asks for another steak while I switch to chicken. 

The waitress leaves and to her credit, the manager arrives to see what the situation is. My mother explains the toughness of the steak to which the manager responds ""Well, the New York Strip is our toughest steak."" by way of explanation. I suppose if we had never had steaks before in our lives, it would have been a suitable one. I ask about the seasonings and how the steaks here didn't seem to be seasoned like all of the other OBs. Her response was that she could not speak to what the other restaurants do. Okay, I guess that's fair in a way.

A little bit later, the manager brings the new food to the table and says she will wait until my mother samples hers to make sure it is okay. My mother starts cutting...and cutting and the manager just turns and leaves. No comment, no waiting to see if it's cooked properly or if my mother will ever be able to cut through it. She just walks away without a word. When my mother does finally get through it, it's well done. Remember, we all ordered medium rare. The waitress returns and my mother expresses her dissatisfaction with the second steak. The waitress offers her something else and my mother decides to just have the shrimp and no steak.

We finally get the check. As you might imagine there is a mistake. While both my and my mother's original orders are removed, instead of changing mine to the chicken and endless shrimp combo, it's charged as two al a carte entrees, which is more $. I show the waitress who is confused again. She leaves, asks the manager, returns to tell me I changed my order and that's the charge. I explain again, she leaves again, returns saying she ""got it now"" and fixed the bill. This time it is correct.

It's a nice date place, and even a good place to bring your family, hang out with friends, or you might even have a good ""power lunch/dinner"" with a business partner or client.  The restaurant is mostly well-kept up, the service is fairly consistent (good), and the steaks are better than average.  Not steakhouse quality, of course, but you are not paying money for that, either! Try the bone-in ribeye, 22 ounces of amazing.  Very satisfying meal for what it's worth, with excellent sides. Our favorites are the broccoli, potato soup, and baked sweet potato.  Great if you are on a diet.  You can order low-carb, and skip dessert.  Downside is if you come at a popular time, you may have to wait.  Avoid that by calling ahead to get on the ""priority"" list (no reservations), or go at an unusual time like we did: 5pm on a Friday night.

Ordered the 11oz sirlion steak and the combo plate of filet mignon and shrimp scampi.  Sirlion Steak was ordered medium and it came to the table perfectly medium (good job!).

I ordered the rib-eye which was seasoned (Outback style) and cooked perfectly. The rest ordered the 8 oz. sirloin combo offered by the promo (gratis), and while our server was excellent and management was nice to allow 2 people in our party to use their voucher and even tipped that one can opt for a different steak instead and they'll just discount it's price from the voucher meal's value, wife and mom still opted to try the steak offered as-is. Disappointingly, the 'free' steak was nothing to write home about: it was dry, and barely passable for a steakhouse steak.

4215250,2012-07-16,0,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"Went to eat on a Saturday night since we had a gift card  Had to wait about 25 minutes and was then seated.  It had been a while since I had been at outback and they changed the menu quite a bit  It's obvious that they are trying to cater more towards the steakhouse aspect of their name and getting away from entrees.  I really liked their queensland chicken and shrimp but it's no longer offered on the menu  We ordered he bloomin' onion as an appetizer as my wife and I have always been a fan and it had been a while since we had it.  when it came out, we were pretty disappointed.  It was obvious they cut back on the size of the onion as it was considerable smaller than we had remembered.  Additionally, it was extremely greasy and over cooked.  We ate some of it and had to stop because of how much grease was on it. 

For our meal, I decided to get the alice springs chicken and my wife got the chicken and ribs combination.  My chicken breast was disappointingly small and about half the size of a normal chicken breast you get at the store.  Additionally, there were barely a handful of fries with the meal.  The chicken was very overdone and dry.  There was also a very heavy ""woodfire"" taste that almost seemed artifical.  My wife's meal was also disappointing.  There were only 3 ribs.  They were moderately sized and slightly overdone as well.  The chicken breast was unimpressive as well as it appeared to be a cutlet rather than a chicken breast.  Her chicken was also very dry and had a very heavy ""woodfire"" taste that seemed artifical as well.  She ordered a baked potato as her side and that was the best part of her meal.  

Service was somewhat unattentive as we had to wait for drink refills which did not help with our disappointment with the entire meal.  Luckily we had a gift card otherwise I would have been even more upset with having to pay for the entire meal.  All in all, not very impressed and will probably be a long time, if ever, that we go back.

The bleu cheese dressing and the balsamic vinaigrette complemented each other very well.  One of the best wedge salads I have had.  The wife ordered the classic bleu salad, with bleu cheese vin, candied pecans, wonton strips, very good. 

For entrees, my wife ordered the wood fire grilled filet with mushroom Madeira sauce and a baked potato. Her filet was undercooked, but the sauce made up for it.

We waited about 30 mins, not too bad considering it'd be a pain to go else where and wait 1 hour. As we were waiting outside, a nice lady handed us a coupon for a FREE bloomin onion! She was so sweet, I guess they gave her so many coupons that she had extra left over lol.

The Eats:
His: T-Bone, Fully Loaded Potato, Veggies, Michelob Ultra
The Kid: 6oz Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies
Mine: 9oz Steak, Mashed Potatoes, Veggies 2-Coors Lights

Personally, the steaks are way over seasoned but the quality of the meat isn't all that bad, isn't awesome, but isn't horrible. Cooked just the way that I'm used to, Med-Rare, and the veggies is where the meal fell short of that 5-star rating. Over cooked, which is hard for me to comprehend when I know in these kitchens, pre-portion the Veggies and either nuke them or flash 'em in some boiling water... Kinda mushy, even the snap peas, wth. The bloomin onion is pretty consistent, no complaints, yum!

The service was great! I feel so bad that I don't remember his name, but he was nice enough to let us know about the 2for1 drink special, the Mother's Day special and everything. He checked up on us often and refills were taken care of without us having to request it.

Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back unless we have a gift card or something... Don't get me wrong, it was a great experience and not having it for awhile made it taste so much better but there are so many other better steak restaurants out there for a lot less.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,2,0,4,Pnyc9WPosSiBfXV_wfmzmw

We eat at Outback Steakhouse every Wednesday back in California.  We're thinking, I don't know, everything is so good here in Las Vegas, we don't need Outback. Let's be adventurous, however, I forgot about my Wednesday specials.

Got a friendly reminder email last night, so here we are. In case you're wondering, yes, we are  super glad we dropped by.

Customer: 5/5
Our server Mikaela, ""WOW"" talking about an amazing WOW service. Honestly, we've had great experiences, but Mikaela is in a whole different category. 

I even heard our neighbor bragged about how amazing Mikaela's service was.  Clearly, this girl needs a raise.  You can totally see that she's an asset to both, Organization and the restaurant. I hope the General Manager holds on to this one. Good employees come and go. Great employees can happen when trained properly. Now brilliant employees like Mikaela, they only come once in awhile. 

Quality: 5/5
Everything is so delicious, for some reasons, way better than the ones in California. Like I said, I am in big trouble, gaining weight is my concern, in case you're wondering what trouble I'm concerning about.

The steaks, onion pedals, desserts, strawberry lemonade, even the grilled onions were perfectly grilled. 

Cleanliness: 5/5
Very clean and organized.

Price: 5/5
Great, especially Wednesday's, great promos. 

Tips:
They were super busy, so avoid during dinner hours. If you are from California, you may be use to a $9.99 special, in Las Vegas, it's $10.99, still worth it.  Even though the Ad states comes with Fries, you can substitute for a different side. Freakin generous.  See you next Wednesday Outback Steakhouse.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,3,3,5,tEDLUeKaTEt7KuaVlYeliw

We started off with our usual Outback apps Seared Tuna, Coconut Shrimp, and Spinach/ Artichoke dip. All three were excellent. I really like that the Artichoke dip came out with these little Crustinis instead of Chips. I wasn't expecting to like some thing as cliche as Spinach/ Artichoke dip but surprisingly it was really good. Nice and creamy with healthy chunks of Artichoke in every bite. I liked the seared Tuna app so much I decided to order the seared Ahi Tuna entree and a side of grilled Scallops. The Tuna and the Scallops were cooked just right and the flavors were excellent too.

Shortly after it opened, I called in for a reservation. Dinner for 5:30pm  on a Saturday night. The person who I made my reservation was great. She placed me on hold and another person picked up and continued it. It was confirmed. Shortly after I received a text messaged confirming my wishes. 4 stars 

I come in just shortly before my time (520pm) and was told it would take approximately 15-20 minutes for the wait. The staff was friendly the restaurant was busy and clean. 4 stars

A male server seated us. Friendly (maybe) but I know he's preoccupied. We was definitely a 10 and made sure our drinks were on the table but that was it. Through conversation he had with another server, and another guest(s), he was either dating or just broke up with. Sorry server I'm here for food and enjoy my time. 

We placed our order and that's when things turned from happy to sad or should I say from happy to hulk. My princess who was celebrating her birthday ordered the Outback famous bloomin onions. Received it real quick (4stars) but when eating it discovered a hair follicle in it (1star). After getting the servers attention (he was too busy talking about his ex-girlfriend (server) we got another one. 

We ordered another bread with butter but, somebody was preoccupied and forgot about the butter on several occasions. Yes it was a little busy and I gave him some latitude but really? It truly will get better.

The rest  of the order came out. Finally my order came out. Very good steak, great bake potato and the macaroni cheese was awesome. (4 stars) let's talk about my Mac and cheese when it finally came out I was 3/4 done with my food. Why did I eat most of my food before bringing it to the attention of the server.....cause he was busy talking about his ex-girlfriend who happened to be a server at the next table. Needless to say I was not happy. Yes I talked to a manager who attempted to do damage control but WTF.

My daughter got to pick her dessert but was told emphatically not to pick the chocolate cake. No explanation but that was it. My perception was them yelling at here. I almost lost it. If it was delivered a different way I would be happy. I'm going to spend almost $110 on the meal, who cares about another $10-$15 on dessert. Listen there are over 40 major hotel and casino's in 20 mile radius, over 300 restaurant that serve steak. Tell me why I should keep coming back from the experience I had.....Do Your Research, I've done mine.

As of 3/13/18, the manager reached out to me and sent me some gift cards. His customer service was 4 star service. I was still disappointed with the experience.",EK4B8i9FJfw539XnWGAV0g,1,0,4,7USH_Sqj1j7Y16Atk7LUEQ

This was my first (possibly second) experience at Outback Steakhouse and they definitely exceeded my expectations. We went on a Friday night around 5PM and they had a full house! I never knew Outback was so popular. They gave us a beeper and we waited about 30 minutes. 

I really like their booths, they are nice and spacious. Our server, Ryan, was attentive, friendly and fast. They start you off with warm bread that reminds me of the honey wheat bread at Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a few items, nothing stood out but everything was good. They currently have a steak and AYCE shrimp special that starts at $15.99.. My only complaint is that the fully loaded baked potato was overly salty so I will probably ask for no salt next time. 

HOT TIP: There is a ""light bites"" menu that features some items starting at $4.. I suggest the Blooming Onion Petals (smaller portion of their famous Blooming Onion) and their Melon Chelada!",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,2,3,3,IPCI1PLKLTi8R4Afh0hGcg

However, even though the place was mostly empty, we still had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Maybe they should've scheduled more waitstaff for a holiday like this. After we got our table, I excused myself to use the restroom. I walked around to the other side of the restaurant where there were a lot of empty tables, but two tables seated. Next to those tables were waitstaff, completely blocking the pathways to the restrooms on both sides. I was left standing there with no way around either one of them. Perhaps some rearranging of the tables would be useful so customers who want to use the restroom aren't left standing there like idiots while they wait for a clear path. They took forever. The people in the tables looked at me like I was strange, the waitstaff never looked at me. Once back at my table, the waitress told me Happy Mother's Day. I am not a mom, it was awkward. She took our drink orders. When she left we noticed one of her long very blonde hairs was left on the table. We didn't complain, just removed it. When the bread came, I put my napkin on my lap. Moments later I felt cold, and then realized my dress was wet/damp. The napkin that I placed on my lap was wet. When our waitress took our order, I told her my napkin was wet and asked for a new one. She said it's because the silverware is wet sometimes when they roll it. I again asked her for a dry one. Even though she walked past our table many times and they still weren't busy yet, She never brought me a new one. I had to ask her again after our salads were brought out. When our main food came, a different wait staff delivered it. I don't like that because how is our waitress supposed to know if anything was wrong with our order? One of the baked potatoes was supposed to have the toppings on the side but it didn't. The guy who delivered it said he would get us a new one and he did. Our waitress never asked about the potato so I'm guessing she didn't know. She only checked on us once. My dads steak was supposed to be medium rare but it was still mooing. Definitely, not medium. The shrimp had no flavor other than the taste of a grill. And the pasta was spicy. Waitress said it had red pepper flakes in it.

Their service had gone downhill very badly for a while but I'm happy to say it seems to be getting much better . Food has been consistently good lately . Tried another location this evening and we were definitely missing this place ! Ask for Phil . Awesome server. My least favorite is Cheryl.,fQ9owsz3ap05vrGrTLPa4Q,0,0,4,3lUiSNz5ne64ygZrAe_a_Q

Our blooming onion was tasty and came out quickly. 
My 8 ounce sirloin was cooked a very perfect medium rare and it was perfectly seasoned.
My boyfriend got the chicken and rib platter and he enjoyed his meal as well. His fries were a bit overcooked,  but other than that it was perfect. 

Our waiter was very friendly and checked on us many times. Our drinks were always full.

We will visit this location again!",ft8zU9vAMp4FkcxB43ysTA,0,1,5,p3MDIDemSlMVOzGTluM5bg

Our doors got opened for us, seated right away, we had the best server...nice short chats, refilled waters when needed, and everyone thanked us as we exited.  Food was good. Nothing too fancy but very good.  I usually get the grilled salmon, but decided to go with the new item ""firecracker salmon"" and that was much better than the grilled salmon. We will definitely be coming back for good food and good customer service",x7XxZlwwicP-3eNPVgiTaQ,0,0,5,AvsgIb84n4_nagqBfE1qBw
5658905,2017-01-06,2,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"What can I say about Outback? If you're looking for a casual, not so fancy but still pretty good food. Then, this is the place! We started off with the Bloomin onion and coconut shrimp. The Bloomin onion has always been my favorite at the Outback. Their French onion soup is also good. I absolutely love their brown bread. I always forget what it's called. But, it's the only one they have and it's really delicious. I like that the butter is whipped and very soft so you can immediately spread it on the warm bread. I got the surf and turf. I forgot which steak I got, but it wasn't the best. Although, the lobster tail was perfectly cooked. I love their sweet potato, I asked for more cinnamon sugar to put on it. For dessert, we decided to try the new salted caramel cookie skillet. It was absolutely amazing! As far as the service, our waitress was wonderful. Ariel was her name. Although, the hostess that worked in the front was very mean when we asked her for something. She was new, but it was her personality that just wasn't pleasant at all. Overall, it was a delightful evening...",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,3,3,4,sKAElFDEeNdvIb76d6EFlg
5740605,2012-11-10,2,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"I do enjoy the Outback from time to time. This location is very peaceful and not too noisy like the other locations I have been too. I ordered the petite sirloin and lobster tail, and yes it tastes just as yummy as it always does! Thats why sometimes I like chain restaurants, because you know excactly what you are going to get and it always tastes just like it did the last time.
We arrived at 4pm, as the doors opened for the night, I think I like being the first customers of the evening as its very clean and the food is the freshest. Our waiter was very attentive and brought the food in a timely matter. I will always go back to an establishment where I feel comfortable and treated nicely by all the staff. Thank you Outback!",wmyoMUiW6YU9Audm0lACDg,3,3,5,xOnlv5NUIV4RlAKlWQdMsA
5851332,2014-07-04,1,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"Food was great.. But like I said in my last review we come because you shouldn't expect that your in Fine dining.. It's casual dining.. Our FAVE kinda of place!. Can't beat the price for what you get.. 

Carly was our server and was a great server.. Would of got 4 stars, but when we asked another server for just sugar.. He acted like an Ass and wanted to say it wasn't his table and walk away mumbling stuff under his breath! 

Oddly he was our server the last time we were here and didn't add him in my review of his conduct! But now I will.. Last time we came here.. He had the nerve to take the open seat next to my son while taking our order.. My son gave me the look as WTF! But I guess that's how he takes his breaks or he just thinks he owns the Joint! Wish I knew his name! Nonetheless, might be awhile before we revisit! 

PS: we didn't let it hurt our waitresses tip! If it were someone else they would of took it out on the Tip! Not her Fault!!",KEcOIBotNrjaOk-x69cgBA,1,1,3,7WVqvZ4ZxssEHWYJXPGRhg

Our server did come back to check to see that everything was well, offer refills, etc. He was friendly as was the staff that opened the door. The food was good too. I didn't give 5 stars because it wasn't WOW but it was good and a favorite in the neighborhood because of the bloomin' onion. The blackberry sangria was delicious, and my first drink I've had here in the multiple times I have gone here. Great job guys!",yhsWUWex0RtJvOwdRnZLuA,0,0,4,-OHzSKe7xLFyq4Y025BnLg

5959430,2013-10-29,1,gqcJHVFCPeBRGnDf8bFzMw,"I had a gift card and resisted my initial instinct to head to the trusted location I've been to near the South outlets, to come here instead. Bad idea. 

We arrived around 3:15, and they were pretty empty. Despite that, service was slow and they seated every subsequent party all in one area with no breathing space. 

Our server was nice, but a little on the slow side and refills on drinks and bread were hard to come by. We ordered before several other groups seated near us and yet our meals were the last to arrive.

The shrimp appetizer we ordered was sad. Skimpy for the hefty price tag. My fella and I shared a porterhouse with baked potato for him and I added a sweet potato on the side. The steak game out dry but after waiting so long we decided to just suck it up without sending it back. My mom's chicken breast was dry as well.

The best part about my meal was the sweet potato and that's sad for a steak restaurant, even if it is a chain.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,2,2,pmxAc8X-kDO2ZBR9_CiWCA
