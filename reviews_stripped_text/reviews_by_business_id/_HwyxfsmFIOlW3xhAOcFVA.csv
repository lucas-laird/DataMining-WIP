I don't really know why I would think that about any place, maybe it's because my expectations were really raised after seeing this new business pop up. After coming here, it was alright, not terrible, but not 'mind blowing'. This would be just right in the middle.

Saw this new business pop up and decided to give it a shot after seeing some reviews. It looked super promising. I noticed that Chowon took over a spot that used to house another Korean restaurant, which closed more than several years ago. A place in town where you would not expect one to be there. So I drove down and tried them out. 

This is off of LVBlvd, but there is no way you can get to it off of the Strip. The best way I could think of is that you take off Wyoming, then take Casino Center Blvd, then drive off Utah St. towards the Strip. It will be the bright blue building at the end of a cul-de-sac.

Parking here is tricky. I'm not too sure if you could park at the motel behind the restaurant, and there is no parking marked on the cul-de-sac. I had to park at the ballet place about 100 feet away on 3rd st. There is a closed down Thai BBQ restaurant and motel across the street from the restaurant where you could park, but just one look at that spot gave me nightmares. I'm not too sure how I feel about walking around too much in this dimly lit area at night. 

After walking in, this place is very spacious. There are ton's of tables to sit at, and everything looks clean. I sat down and ordered some food, then waited for a short bit.

Ordered the soondoobu, or soft tofu stew. I thought that the tofu was cooked well, as were all the other items in the soup. The broth seemed a little bland too me, kinda watery without too much flavor. The banchan, or side dishes, were pretty average too me, nothing really stood out, but nothing was bad. It was OK.

I don't know if I'll be back, nothing really stood out. I think the lack of parking is also a killer for me. But, I wish them the best, they seem like really nice people.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,20,19,3,HooCr8LJeYhqfpKwiP4WUQ

The banchan was good, and the service was actually very friendly. It's been open for about 4 months now. This place is near downtown Vegas",hn-mT1rG9FxXvYsII3JiIA,1,1,2,KrGxf_qke3s2gmZRvAo_Ng

I have to say, I wasn't expecting how delicious the food was, on top of that, the how great the people working there are. They are extremely sweet and I would totally come here again!",hiEXzKv5FstLOe7Szw4kpQ,0,0,5,FuO3ELba1P55sc9peaYbYw
3753764,2015-12-26,0,_HwyxfsmFIOlW3xhAOcFVA,"This is the best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas. My family and I have tried other restaurants but nothing compares to Chowon Grill. Their staff is very friendly, but the food is what we keep coming back for. We tried the Galbi, Kimchi stew, Meat stew and Dumpling soup and they were all delicious. The food tastes like the food your mom makes for you as home or your grandmother made for you when you were little. And that is so comforting because nothing compares to the food that your mother cooks for you. I'm always reminded of home when I eat here and I will be coming back during my next visit to Las Vegas!",kC5ClQ8RXhWZJfl8DSWI9A,0,0,5,Mp-KWq7_-74AST8mku6lWw
