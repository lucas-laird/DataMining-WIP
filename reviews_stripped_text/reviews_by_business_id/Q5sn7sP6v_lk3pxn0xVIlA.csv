I ordered a cheeseburger (2 patties) with american cheese, jalepenos, green peppers, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, lettuce, ketchup, and maybe more. Forgot already. Anyways, it was delicious and I loved it. Every bite was an adventure.

Kalila ordered a little cheeseburger with mayo, lettuce, mushrooms and A1 steak sauce. They forgot her A1. That definitely didn't help her opinion of the place. She was still unimpressed with her burger. She won't stop telling me about how amazing Shake Shack in NYC is. She compares EVERY burger to them. 

We agree that the employee who took our order was very nice. She offered us a side of cajun powder so that we didn't have to order both regular and cajun fries.

Five Guys offer free peanuts and they have futuristic soda machines. Once you select a drink, such as lemonade, it changes to the different kinds of lemonade to choose from! We thought we'd get lemonade and then all of a sudden we got strawberry lemonade! It was a nice surprise.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,0,1,3,QQIvdxu74WlYcTG6BVznJA

I do think the volume of the workers was a little loud, competing with the radio.   I would give it five stars if the there was less shouting. Regardless of the noise,  We will be back for the great burger.",tHOXNIF2Fhf9v4F7KjdUXg,0,0,4,5beVjHG9_p9FM-52PLhOrg

My wife has celiac disease so she can't eat any gluten.  The staff takes extra care to not cross contaminate anything.  We've gone to this location numerous times and it's always the same.

173476,2015-04-26,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"I was first introduced to Five Guys a few years ago when I lived in Phoenix.  Specifically at the Scottsdale mall.  Imagine my surprise when I moved back to Vegas exactly one year later to learn there was one here. I thought Five Guys was specific to Arizona, specifically THAT location.  And then I traveled to England and Five Guys is everywhere there?!  Clearly this is a chain, and an international one at that. 

All that said...the important bits are these:  they make a good burger buts just okay. Its not special.  Its not great. Its definitely overpriced. $5.99 for a LITTLE BACON CHEESEBURGER better WOW! me with flavor alone. It doesn't.  

The LITTLE sized burgers aren't code for kids meal...its a normal sized, one patty deal.  I like you can customize your toppings & sauces.  For someone like me who hates mayo or ""special sauce"" that comes standard at other places, that I can order mustard & know I'll get the mustard (or ketchup, or A-1) I asked for, is different & nice.  

The bacon is crispy, again a nice change from the raw fatty pieces you often get elsewhere. 

Not keen on the multi-flavored drinks machine. Having used one in the past, while a neat George Jetson contraption, it totally messes up your drink. One spigot dispensing 100s of flavored soda combinations daily leaves behind a funky taste in your REGULAR Coke fill.  It's gross.  I bring my own drink or order take away instead. 

What makes this place better than other burger joints are the fries. I like they aren't frozen and instead are made from fresh spuds. I even like that an order of LITTLE FRIES feed more than 1 person. I'm not keen on the amount of grease the brown paper bag absorbs...these are greasy...but the fries are fresh & not salty & I for one love that. Others might not...

Unfortunately when I arrived last night, my first visit here, I found the inside to be a mess. Lots of empty tables that were dirty.  The floor was dirty.  I opted to take my meal home to eat.

I didn't get peanuts, nor was I offered any.  Not a big deal, but everyone raves about the peanuts...I can't say anything more about it than this.

To me, Five Guys is average. It will never be my first choice but when I'm not in the mood to hit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR or fight the In & Out crowds I might...MIGHT...come here if I'm craving a burger & am too lazy to cook one at home.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,0,0,3,9HCRa4hXbNYfcexXvbPvpg

188850,2012-05-23,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"I visited Five guys recently for the first time and I can see why they have opened so many locations in such a short period of time.  Their menu is pretty basic, hamburgers and dogs and lots of free toppings to choose from. I had a double bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce and onions.  

The burger itself is nice and juicy and tasty, but I can't get past the cheese. It just tasted weird, like I dunno, it didn't belong with it. In N Out still has my vote on a better burger.  One thing 5 guys does do better though is their fries. They are oh so good and well seasoned. Definitely better then any other burger place in my opinion.  

Their drink machine is off the wall. I was taking my order to go so didn't get one but I couldn't resist checking out all the different options you can make up with anything from water to soda to powerade.  Also while you wait they have peanuts you can munch on. 

So for the burger with the weird cheese I give 3 stars because for the price I think a key ingredient like that should be of better quality.",0jh6FM1kd6ecYs1ESjFZKA,0,0,3,ipCHeXCTlHwjiOqVS-GcJg

We showed up just after the dinner rush and the place was a little slow but the atmosphere was awesome. We were greeted when we walked in the door by a nice lady who told us to help our self's to as much peanuts as you want!! Wait what peanuts you say yeah they have buckets of fresh peanuts along the line to get your food. All you can eat!!!

As I made my way to the order area I was ready to just order by number but found out that is not the way here. They have a card on the front counter with a laundry list of items you can add on burger at no extra cost. Pick the type of burger you want and what you want on it. Being a little in shock and new to there ways the guy helped me thought the ordering process with a smile and was extremely helpful. I mean when do you go to a ""fast food"" place and they put what ever you want on your food! This is the true meaning to have it your way!

My burger and fries were made fresh after I order it and was pretty fast too! They gave me a huge bag of fries that I couldn't even finish and that means a lot coming from me!! The burger was amazing it had that good ol home cooking flavor!

The price was high for the meal but after eating it I felt that is was justified! I wish they were a little more competitive on the cost so I don't feel bad for spending 13 bucks on 1 meal!!

839031,2013-05-28,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"In honor of National Hamburger Day I thought I might take a moment to pay homage to one of my favorite (top two) fast food hamburger establishments, Five Guys.   If you haven't tried a burger from them you must, it is imperative you follow my recommendation.  Otherwise you quite possibly are depriving yourself of one of the greatest fast food experiences of your life (unless you are vegetarian of course!).  
Having moved here from Virginia where the OfG's (original Five Guys) originated it was quite depressing not having the little cheeseburger available here until about a year ago.  I tried the whole west coast In-N-Out thing and although close, just didn't do it for me.  Finally, being an avid follower on Facebook and seeing the franchise expand to places like Pittsfield, MA , Casper, WY and even Canada (eh) my taste bud prayers were answered and now we have five locations here in town.  
Let me share with you some fun facts about Five Guys:
*There are 250,000 possible ways to order a burger (although we all know I only order it one way-plain!)
* If you are in the mood for a Grape Fanta, Sprite and Orange Coke concoction all locations have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  If I hadn't given up the coke I would be all over that.
* Everything is made fresh here.. they don't even have a freezer!
* If you are daring enough to order your burger ""all the way"" it is similar to the animal style but has mayo, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, grilled onions, mushrooms, ketchup and mustard.. all for no additional charge!  It doesn't stop there though as they also offer such toppings as jalapenos, barbeque sauce, and green peppers... why anyone would want green peppers on such a delicious burger is boggling but to each their own.  
The food is super fresh and in fact there is a nice little notice advising you where the bags of potatoes for your fries have come from.   Speaking of the fries, if there was a negative about this place is would be that their fries are not my style.  I think they are too fresh and healthy for me but I still throw a few on my burger for texture purposes.  Even so you get more than enough for two people to share when ordering the regular size.
I interrupt this review for an important message.  If you are one of the 3.3 million Americans who suffer from peanut allergies, please do not enter Five Guys as not only are the fries cooked in peanut oil but they have bins and bins of complimentary peanuts for you to snack on while you wait.  It is an allergy attack waiting to happen!
With all that being said I think you should give them a try.  It is a little pricier than your usual fast food restaurants you may patronize but worth it.  And with that Yelp Nation in honor of NHD I leave you with this famous quote ""I will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today."" Wimpy J. Wellington
PS- Mark your calendars National French Fry Day and National Hot Dog day are both coming up in July!",GbHckhaFyxErPGKAP0PJQw,0,0,4,p91IlMWeRydugqQtt9huYw

You get to pick what you want and take off what you hate. Plenty of toppings to choose from and they are actually fresh produce too. Either than lettuce and tomatoes, you can choose grilled mushrooms, jalapenos, grilled onions, and A1 sauce. Who does A1 sauce? 5 guys does :-{D. They french fries come in big portions and can feed 2-3 people, but the large can feed up to 3-5! Huge. It is kinda pricey but the quality is delicious.

854395,2012-04-29,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"So after a long drive to Hoover Dam and stopping in for some gambling at the M Resort, we decided to do some shopping at the Las Vegas Outlets South.  
We were also hungry and burgers sounded good.  I didn't want to eat at McDonald's or Wendy's or Burger King or any other chain that I can get anytime in Hawaii...I wanted to eat something different.  So when we saw the Five Guys Burgers located by the road next to the outlets, we decided to give them a try.
Overall, I'd rate the burgers as excellent and the fries as well.  The burger itself was excellent and cooked to perfection.  What I also liked was the fact that they include the toppings for free(except bacon, which you have to pay for)...so if you want mushrooms...no problem...onions...no problem...jalapenos...no problem.  
As an added bonus you can munch on free peanuts while you wait...it's serve yourself style...so scoop a bunch if you wish.  The peanuts are actually quite good.

It's also funny watching people try to figure it out.  The customer service was very friendly and they seem trained to be so.

The place is good, not great, and worth a try.  The reason for 3 stars and not more is because of the price and the food not being anything note-worthy.

1099094,2012-01-28,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"All over, people are raving about Five Guys Burgers & Fries. My friend up in Washington says she loves them. On their website they show off everyone singing their praises.

I must not get it.

I've been wanting to try them for quite some time, and learned they now have a spot open on the Strip (not the touristy part everyone knows, but a little further past Mandalay Bay at the Premium Outlets South). As that is on the way to my gym, I decided to roll out early, stop at Five Guys, and work it off at Fight Capital.

Walking in, you feel good about the place. It's kinda diner-y, simple... tables, chairs, and a team of employees hurriedly working on food in the kitchen. Kinda In-N-Out-esque. REALLY In-N-Out-esque. Like, you wonder if you walked into an In-N-Out instead of Five Guys. There was only one person ahead of me in line, and the cashier, Michelle, was quick and pleasant. I ordered a Bacon Burger, which if you leave it that way, is just that: bread, patty (actually two) and bacon. Anything else on it you have to make sure to specify, so I added my standard toppings -- lettuce, tomato, and BBQ sauce. An onion ring might have been a nice touch, but hey, I don't run the place. Didn't see mustard on the list... hmmmm... well, it's probably by the ketchup, because I didn't see that on the list either. I also ordered some Cajun fries and a drink.

So, let's start with some of the good things here. First off, the employees are very efficient. One person barked orders at the other, everyone had their station, very assembly-line style, and I got my food quickly, which was great because I was famished. Secondly, the Coke machine is, without a doubt, very cool. It's one of those new Coke-brand stations with a touch screen. You touch the soda you want, then you choose regular or with flavored syrup, and POOF -- it's Cokeapalooza! I went with a cherry Coke Zero. Wise choice. On my second visit I noticed there was Diet Barq's (root beer with BITE!), but no cherry option, and I was really diggin' on the cherry Coke Zero, so I went back to that.

The Cajun fries were some of the best I've had in a really long time. Zing-y, spicy, good with or without ketchup. Definitely was loving the fries.

Definitely was NOT loving the burger. Sure, it was a nice surprise that the burgers came standard with two patties, but they were kinda dry and lifeless. Apparently standard setting for their burgers is well-done. Any cook or chef will tell you that overcooking ground beef will cook out the juice and flavor of the meat, and that's what happened here. Bacon was overcooked as well. And by ""overcooked"" I mean ""burnt."" Fortunately I had sauces to back me up, BBQ sauce and.....

Oh yeah. That's another thing. There's no mustard in the entire restaurant. Let me repeat that: THERE WAS NO VISIBLE MUSTARD IN THE ENTIRE HAMBURGER JOINT. No pump, no packets, nothing. I looked on the Coke machine to see if they had it stashed on their touch-screen. I thought about asking, but that would require the only non-assembly-line employee to leave her cash register. Plus, I thought, I shouldn't have to ask for mustard in a friggin' burger joint.

Final blow: Price. I ordered burgers, fries, and a drink, thinking, meh. $8. Should be okay with that. Oh no no, my friend. Everything is a la carte and you will order and take it up the wallet, my friend. By the time I had finished my order I was $11 in and there was no turning back. it felt as if the place was called ""Five Guys"" because you'd be paying the paychecks for five guys. Now, I would expect to pay $11, maybe more, at Holsteins or Burger Bar, where I would also not be looking for a ""quick bite"" and know I would get more (much more) bang for my buck (all eleven of them). This was not $11 quality. Nowhere close. Ironic, as I stared at the sign that said the Washingtonian or some other print media said in 2007 it was the ""best bargain"" around. Apparently in Washington you make a bazillion dollars an hour there. (Hmm... maybe The Gazillionaire is from Washington...)

I didn't know anything about Five Guys before I wandered in. It's a homey feel, with their sacks of potatoes lining the ""order here"" area. You can grab peanuts while you wait.

I was wearing an old beat up gray tee shirt and she was complimenting me on my nice shirt?  I ordered a Cheeseburger, small fries, and a small drink.  She rang it up for 14.30 and was really slow giving me my change, counting 70 cents like five or six times.  She then took about 30 seconds to give me my five dollar bill back from the twenty I gave her, like she was going to keep it.  It was bizarre, but then I noticed she charged me for a regular order of fries.  I normally give them a buck for a tip in their bucket, but I had to say something to her about not listening to me and giving me the larger fries.  She said nothing so I told her I will just forget the tip.  It was really strange but maybe she was new.  On to the food, I got the burger loaded and it was really tasteless.

I knew I wasn't going to finish the fries by myself, and I didn't, but I have someone else to give my leftovers to so I wasn't worried.

My cheeseburger and fries were delicious. Greasy, but delicious.

1825078,2012-08-06,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"This place has controversially and quietly been on the rise amongst burger joints. The only way for me to confirm with its credibility was to give it a try and so I did.

I got the mini cheeseburger with green peppers, jalapeno, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, and etc. Just because this burger is named mini does not mean the burger itself is mini. The difference between the mini burgers and the normal menu-named burgers is the amount of patties. In the mini, there is one patty while for the normal ""burger"" there is two patties. What I like about this burger is that I get to specify what I want in it and it's a very vintage old school style of burger which I like. It's not manufactured with cheap preservatives like McDonald's or Burger King but the ingredients for 5guys is a lot more fresh. However, I wouldn't particularly claim anything special about this burger. They are tasty and good, but nothing that special.

The fries on the other hand were amazing. We ordered the smallest one and it was huge! It came in medium sized cup but the catch about this is that after they place the fries in the bag, they scoop up like 2 spoon-full of fries and just throw it in with the bag. The more the merrier, especially if you're like me who fantasizes about fries all the time. The fries not only come in large quantity but they are great in quality. You have the option to have either normal or cajun fries. I got the cajun, and you should too!

Overall, a great experience and it met the hyped expectations that everyone has raved about. But I would go as far as saying that Five Guys is a bit overrated. In short, no it's not better than In'n Out, but it is definitely worth trying, especially for a change here and then.

I'll get the one negative out of the way, I wish they did curly fries but they instead aim to provide fresh cut French fries (which I also hoped were thinner). I also wish I got to try their Cajun fries but was outvoted.

Their burger menu, although small, has the essentials. You can get plain, cheese, bacon, a combination of the above or even a veggie burger (which is full of veggies and not a fake meat patty). You can also choose to FREELY add fillers to your burger with standard stuff like lettuce, tomatoes, to more unique things like hot sauce and mushrooms.

They have a wide range of portion sizes to choose from and even the smallest sizes make a good meal if you're on the go and don't want to be weighed down by your stomach.

They also have a huge bag of free (dry roasted?) peanuts for patrons to snack on while they wait for their meals.

Service, especially for a fast food joint, was excellent. Everyone was friendly and hustled for the customer and that includes the table cleaning staff.

What they should really do is add what In-N-Out does with their fries, animal style, and there would be not even any competition. Far from gourmet but a real solid non-gourmet kind of burger. They are not inexpensive. It was $10+ for my burger and fries, no drink.

Food was great, fries fresh and hot and the service was excellent. One thing i did notice also is they keep this location way cleaner then the locations in florida.  Free shell on nuts while you wait for your food can cause quite a mess and people don't care when they are waiting, tended to leave large messes on the floors in tampa but here one of the associates was on it the whole time even while they were busy.  Drink machines where pretty cool with the touch screen feature. Sweet tea tasted fresh and changed out.

  This burger is more akin to a homemade burger, nothing fancy, but it's a burger made correctly.  I only got the standard fixings, so next time I'll definitely add bacon since that was recommended to me for a second round.  
  The service was great and if you're eating in house, they even come around and ask how you're doing.  They even asked us if we wanted more fries on the house!  As much as we wanted to take the offer, we were stuffed.

Just FYI
The regular burger comes with 2 patties so order a little burger if you're so inclined.

Fries:  They give you a mountain and you definitely won't be disappointed with the amount.  The fries are decent as well

Sometimes the cajun spices are over done on the  fries but a quick sip of soda will get rid of that :) They offer free peanuts at all times which is super cool. All their foods are cooked in peanut oil which personally I never appreciated until I ate there. Its delish and the folks are pretty friendly.

First thing I enjoyed were the complementary salted roasted peanuts. This was good because it's great for people that are hungry and cannot wait to be served.

My friends went during the evening after 5pm and there wasn't much of a wait to order. To pretty much sum up why this place is awesome:

No wait in line
Establishment was clean
Extra toppings for free
Two of those high tech fancy coke product dispensers that pours 10-15 different types of beverages.
Good location off the Las Vegas Blvd for those on the south end of the strip.

2797520,2012-06-20,3,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"Their menu is very simple. Pick your burger, hot dog, or sandwich. Then you can pick as many free toppings you want on your selected item. Technically it's not free since you gotta pay for your selection. But then again, you don't pay extra if you decide to have them put ALL the toppings in your burger. This is where I have to actually stop and think about the value of my choice. Yes I actually had them put ALL the toppings on my burger. This is good or bad depending on how you look at it. GOOD: Definitely got value for my money. Filled me up. You get to taste how every single topping is put together and based on that, you get to experiment how certain toppings can blend better than others. BAD: Very messy. As soon as you take that first bite, you may have some or all toppings come falling out (to me, a messy burger is a good sign of enough ingredients to keep your tastebuds on your toes). Obviously I wouldn't recommend you eating this in your car even if you are parked. You might get heartburn if you have a weak stomach. 

Now as for the pricing, I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with everything. It cost about 6 dollars and some change. Not bad. Of course you gotta have some of their fries and a drink to wash it down with. So total for my whole meal was about 13 something. Definitely just a tad more than In n Out which for some reason is the other burger joint that everybody is comparing it to. 

Their fries alone are pretty tasty. Pretty greasy but good. I have yet to see fries that are baked or grilled taste any better. Now if you do get the fries, they have two sizes. Small and large. The small in itself is a nice size so if you wanna share that you can't go wrong. What I don't understand is why anyone would not order their fries cajun. The fries are already good by themselves but damn, having them sprinkle the cajun spices on your fries is like putting ice cream and hot fudge on a brownie. It's that much better! I'm sure you have heard the term, ""Put a little spice in your life"". Well, the cajun fries are just that! 

Their coke machine is not just any soda machine. It's what every fast food restaurant should have! So many choices of beverages and even some you never heard of! I think after this review I will contact the Coke company and demand this as the norm for every fast food joint they are in. 

Oh, did I mention the free peanuts you can eat while you are waiting for your order? I guess if you really wanna be stingy, you can just order a burger and ask a cup for water. Then fill up on the peanuts! I have actually seen somebody do this so if you wanna save money than by all means!

So overall, with their good service you will have a pretty good experience. Just be prepared to spend a little more than you're used to especially if you are feeding a family of 4 or more. For more info especially for a list of all the toppings you can have, go to their website, www.fiveguys.com

Their fries are top notch. Just the right amount of crisp and crunch. To top it all off, they have one of those cool multisoda machines, see what I did there. ;) Not to mention they have pretty much all the self serve peanuts you could ever eat all for a semi reasonable price.

There goes my gripes about the place which is why it was not a perfect match. I do believe their prices are just a tickle overpriced for what they offer but not enough for me to not buy their delicious, mouth watering food. Their quality burger does taste good enough for me to not care about the slight over cost not to mention them having been awarded the best burger in Vegas for multiple years just goes to show that there doesn't need to be a change to an already perfect burger. 

Never before have I had a problem with their food before but this day for some reason after finishing their burger I did feel queasy for a good minute. Enough in fact that I actually went to the restroom just in case I did heave up that deliciousness. Luckily nothing came out and the nausea went away. I came back to finish my fries as though nothing had happened. Again this is not a normal occurrence and every other time the experience has been amazing and I have eating their food without a hitch. There was just something about that day that did not sit right with my stomach.

Regardless, if you are looking for a quality meal, and you are just a little tired from having eaten In-N-Out 6 days in a row and just want a quality burger that doesn't taste like perfection for once, Five Guys is a good runner up that I highly recommend people go there to eat.",Y5Jn7FKHubCVjl5qZjA3yg,2,1,4,_Gmno3QI7jtI-uTCsCEaSw

I do have to admit that I'm a burger fanatic and haven't come across too many burgers I wasn't at least mildly enthusiastic about, but despite that, I do think there's something special about Five Guys.

It wasn't busy at all when we got there, which surprised me a little since I've heard this place being compared to In N Out so often (and In N Out is ALWAYS a zoo!), but then again, it was almost closing time.  It took a few seconds to acquaint myself with the menu, but once I took a look at all the toppings available, I was pretty darn excited!  Grilled onions AND mushrooms?!  Yes, please!

I had the hamburger and sinfully opted not to get fries (this is pretty much an anomaly in my world, but I was feeling a little off that day), so sadly, I can't comment on their probable deliciousness.  I'm pretty sure I'd be more than ok with just one patty, but it comes with two.  Every single bite of it was fresh and oh so very yummy.

While I do understand the general public's constant comparison of Five Guys to In N Out, I choose to stray from adding to the rivalry.  The only thing I found similar between the two is the interior decor looked a bit familiar..red and white tile and what not.  And yes, they're both atypical burger joints with a simplistic menu...(Oh good gosh...look at me!!  I AM comparing them!  LOL), but, to me, they each stand tall in their own right.  Their price points aren't the same...my Five Guys burger was in the $5 range, while I usually spend $2 for an In N Out burger...a Double Double (since we're talking two patties at Five Guys) $3-4...I guess I'm playing both sides of the burger fence here, but being a California girl raised on those little red In N Out palm trees, I didn't feel like I was cheating on them with Five Guys.  I have a new friend in Five Guys and still maintain my loyalty to In N Out...it's like dual citizenship...

A friend brought me to Five Guys after a day of boating at the lake. The nice juicy burger hit the spot. It was so delicious I went back the next day for more. 

It's a good thing i'm not allergic to peanuts because I enjoyed the side peanuts. Since it was my first time we opted for the little burger (all the way), Cajun fries, and a drink. By the time I had gotten to the burger I was stuffed from the drink, peanuts, and fries. Next time I'll probably opt out on the fries. The burger reminded me of an 'In n Out' burger on steroids. Now that i've had a taste of Five Guys I won't ever be going back to In n Out. 

Those peanuts do make for a messy floor but the staff is always on point with keeping the place clean. 

On a side note I love places that have the Coke soda machines with hundreds of different flavor options. My personal favorite is the Diet Vanilla Coke.

I probably drove by this place a million times but finally decided to check it out after a movie night at Town Square. Walking in, I noticed two things: this place is WHITE, and there are peanuts everywhere. The whole place looks like it was bleached up and down. The floors, walls, everything is white. It has a nice clean look, and there are giant bags of peanuts all over the place.

The menu itself isn't very large but it does offer vegetarian and chicken options if your not feeling beef. The burgers are highly customizable with tons of condiments and add ons. I did notice that the bacon is a very crispy. I am not sure what they do to it but thank god its not soggy. On top of that they give you a ton of fries, and i mean a ton.

Five Guys is one step up from regular fast food burger places.  You won't find a drive through here and your burger is made when you order it.  A regular Hamburger will come with two patties so if you're really wanting just one, you'll want to order the Little Hamburger.

This place is located across the parking lot from the Outlet Mall, so do some shopping/walking and then do some eating, or the other way around.  Either way, take in some calories and burn some calories.  When you walk in the door, you will probably be greeted with some form of welcome.  Note the bags of potatoes on the floor that tell you what kind of fries you'll be having today.  Oh, and you will be having fries, right?  Live like me and go for the Cajun fries.  Mmmm.

Walk up to the counter and place your order.  They have a long list of toppings to choose from but don't get carried away.  After placing your order, have a seat.  It will take a few minutes.  Bring your phone so you can spend time Yelping or playing games.  

Oh yeah, almost forgot.  While you're waiting, they have a treat for you.  Shelled peanuts.  Just go on up to the barrel and take a paper bowl and fill it to your heart's content.  Head to your seat and eat away.  Remove shell first.

Your burger's gonna come wrapped in a soft foil.  The buns are really soft and end up getting mashed a bit, but it's still good this way.  This tends to be a sloppy burger as it's being eaten, so keep it partially wrapped as you go.

And one order of fries is enough for a couple of people (you get a bunch).

If I'm paying more than McDonalds prices, I want better than a slice of off brand processed cheese on my burger. Maybe even a choice of American, cheddar, or a white cheese. Also, when going out specifically for a burger, a milkshake would be great along side it. Its just hamburgers, cheeseburgers, hotdogs, sodas. If you order a regular burger/cheesebuger, be aware that it has 2 patties. A regular sized fry is enough for 2 people. The place is LOUD. It gets quite annoying lsitening to the employees yell out how many people just walked thru the door, as if we didnt see them. They also have a worker constantly yelling out how long its taking to dish out burgers from order to pick up time. I like the fact that they tell the cooks if they need to speed up or not, but it just gets ridiculous constantly hearing them yell at each other. The only things I enjoyed about Five Guys is the free peanuts, the cool soda machine with endless options, and the homemade tasting fries. All in all, I will stick to Smash Burger or Fatburger where there are more options, better topping, and more bang for my buck.",QyyCQb7i4YHZeHLPeLfYLQ,2,3,2,s41Juyf0S-M187BBmNvjGg

I ordered Cajun Fries. $3.74. I was just getting a regular order for myself. When this ""cup"" arrived, it was spilling over with a ""Fountain of Fries,"" if you will. This fountain nearly filled this grease-stained brown paper bag. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the bag. That's all part of the presentation. But definitely WAY more than I thought I was getting. Pleasantly surprised. 

Then, at the bottom of the fry bag, is my Cheeseburger. Wrapped in tinfoil and HOT. After nibbling on some delicious Cajun Fries, I unwrap this amazing burger and....wow. When they say grilled, they mean grilled ingredients. This is how I wish every burger tasted. 

Overall, this has been an amazing meal. Very much like a backyard BBQ type feel to the food. And I can't wait to order again or dine-in. Definite must-try if you haven't already tried their burgers. I got grilled onions, peppers and jalapeños on mine and it was DELICIOUS!!!

You pick your burger size (single patty is a ""little burger""), if you want cheese or bacon, and choose from tons of free toppings like grilled onions and mushrooms.  The ""little"" burger is a bit of a misnomer because it is very filling (IMO).

It gets a little messy if you order your burger wrapped in lettuce, but now you can also get it in a little plastic tray if you want go bunless.  You can also order fries (regular or Cajun), but if you dig into the free peanuts while you wait for your burger, you may question your decision to order fries.  We never wind up eating them and one order is definitely large enough to share with a few people.

A couple visits ago I tried the BLT for a change of pace.  I was a little skeptical about a BLT on a burger bun, but it was fantastic.  Crunchy lettuce and bacon.  Perfect.

The place is very clean and simple.  I like that! The menu is about as simple as it gets. Damn near looks like a menu from the 50s; Hamburger, Cheeseburger, Bacon Hamburger, Bacon Cheeseburger, Hot Dog, that's about it, really!

You get an exceptional selection of toppings, but nothing over the top. Alongside the norm, you can get grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, green peppers, and a kick as hot sauce. Not too hot, but has some flavor to it!

The burgers actually look like a burger, which means they are using fresh goundbeef (YES!), the patties don't look like they have been under an 5 ton press. It's big juicy burger patties. And if you order fries, you get a basket of fresh cut fries, check you bag, because over half your fries didn't fit in the cup they give you.  They're in the bag.

Another novelty in the restaurant is the Coke machine, it has screen with what appears to be every Coke product made and you can mix n' match to make your very our drink flavor combo.

4142810,2013-05-11,3,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"So I am new to the Five Guys phenomenon and I am so excited to have seen the light!  

My husband and I found this place when we were trying to decide what to have for lunch one day.  We had heard people talk about it, but hadn't been by one when we wanted to eat.  I'm so glad we finally found one at lunch time though!

First let me tell you that I am a burger lover.  I am always trying to find great burgers wherever i  am.  When I was in Kenya a couple of years back, I almost died because there weren't burger places in the Safari-lands.  I went 3 weeks without a burger and almost died, I swear!  So whenever I find a great burger joint, it makes my day and I love to spread the word.

So we walked into the store and all you can smell is wonderful, meaty goodness.  I knew I mind was about to be blown and boy was it!  We walked up to order and that is when I saw the wall of options you can get on your burger for no extra charge.  You can go simple or crazy and everything is the same price.  I love condiments, so I was really happy with the extra options like A1, BBQ, and hot sauce.  Life needs spice, so might as well add it to the burger, huh?

We waited a few minutes for our burgers and that is when I saw the Coca-Cola machine of my dreams.  So many options to customize your drink.  I love soda, almost as much as burgers, so I was in heaven.  It was almost overwhelming to have so many options.  I was just happy that I was able to try out several different soda combinations during our visit.  I think I drank my entire month's allotment of soda during this one visit, but it was worth it baby!

And then the fun began because our burgers were ready.  The first bite of my delicious burger made me see stars, in a good way.  I even chewed slowly to make the moment last longer.  I had juices and sauces all over my face and running down my hands, but I was in love.  Sorry hubby, the burger may have bumped ahead of you on my love meter!

Now every burger needs some fries and the fires here do the job well!  They do a cute thing here by posting where the potatoes that your fries are made out of were grown.  It is fun to know such a little detail.  My fries came from Boise, ID, in case you were wondering.  We each got an order of the Five Guys Style and the Cajun flavor and loved both of them, but we only needed one order between the 2 of us.  I think one order would feed a small family, so keep that in mind when you order your fries.  They were great fries though.  You can tell that they are fresh cut and fried right away.  They were yummy and delightful.

Another thing I really liked was that they label each burger.  It is nice just to look for your burger # on the top of the burger, than having to open each lovely present to check and see if it is yours or not.  Great idea Five Guys!

So yes, I have a new burger place for when I am on the go.  I am lucky that one isn't too too close, otherwise I might end up being 500lbs.  If you haven't tried Five Guys, go do it now!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,8,4,5,fzURJPdHf2gecYsFhk0P-g

Every time this happens, I see Five Guys and I use all my willpower to resist going there instead.  Well, I succeeded once again today and got my healthy teriyaki bowl and headed back to work.  Suddenly, without my having any clue as to how it happened, I found myself at the counter of Five Guys ordering a little bacon burger with mayo, lettuce, pickles, onions, ketchup, and mustard and an order of cajun fries.  WTF just happened?!?!  Burger magic?  Well, I decided to just go with it, seeing as to how it was too late to turn back.

Just a tip if you've never been there before: a ""LITTLE"" burger is a normal sized burger.  If you order the regular, it will come with double patties.  Don't get me wrong, the more meat, the better, but it's a lot of food and you have to be prepared to be hit with something like that.  The Little versions are about 300 calories less.  

You walk in and up to the counter and place your order.  Toppings are free, which is a huge plus!  Then they give you a number and you wait until they annoyingly scream your name or number out.  They have this amazing Coke machine that seriously looks like an arcade video game.  I don't drink soda so I didn't mess with it, but I did watch as a very elderly gentleman attempted to find a type of soda he wanted and quickly became frustrated and confused.   An employee cleaning tables nearby hurried over to help him.  Everyone here is so nice and chipper!  I love it!

Best of all, the burgers are freakin amazing.  They are juicy, and just the right amount of greasy.  The cajun fries have a kick to them and they taste like heaven dipped in ranch.  This is one of my favorite burger spots in Las Vegas.  Guess I'm having teriyaki bowl for dinner.  :/",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,4,2,5,_EeM-_PR6A5kM1RQf7X6qA

a. Holy peanuts Batman - They have tons of sacks of salted peanuts and paper dishes you can pack up with tons of these.  Eat them, spill them, snack on them while your custom made burger comes out and it is truly a cool experience!

b,  The ordering - I find it a bit challenging due to the very lengthy list of extras and things you can put on the burger.  I was tempted to have many things and so you get it, but it does make eating your burger very difficult unless you have a very large orifice!  Watch it!!!

c.  The noise - Man is this place noisy.  The food order takers and the kitchen people are all yelling out the orders an processing your order.  It takes a bit to get used to, but besides the noise, the good thing is that you can hear your order getting done.....

d.  The Freakin Fries - ORDER ONLY A SMALL - and you will be luck you don't get a lunch bag size container full of overflowing fries.... What a great value and especially if you are on that high carb lo protein diet that is working out for so many of us!!!  This is like the best deal in the nation.

e.  The soda - Five Guys, home of the wonderful coke machine that is like that Star Trek TOS Food Replicator.  You can have so many flavors of your favorite coke, and then add any liquid add in like lime, cherry, lemon and you have a great tasting soda!

f.  The taste - Nice burger, they cook it to one temp.  If you leave the burger in its wrapping too long, it will get soggy and your burger falls apart as you touch it.

The ordering process for a newbie is easy enough. Pick your burger and tell them what toppings you want, if any. It's all included so don't be shy. Seeing the concept as awesome, I added grilled mushroom & onions to my bacon burger. Added some fries and a shake to complete the high caloric meal. 

As I waited in anticipation, quotes of praises and magazine covers that featured Five Guys on one wall caught my attention. I read and waited for my culinary enlightenment. They called my # and I was at the counter in less than .7 seconds. 

The fries were hot, the burger felt heavy ... all is well, that is until I opened the wrapper. What faced me was a twin of dry patties, tons of various sized lettuce pieces, with bacon that fell apart in some areas, and remained chewy in others. The meat was dry and bland. It had zero flavor. No salt was spared, nor was any seasoning. I was chewing, but tasted nothing. Not the meat-ish product, not the grilled onion & shrooms... only tasted the lettuce. 
The fries were so salty that I had to stick them in the burger to serve as a flavor agent. 

The service was pretty good. They worked efficiently and were courteous. I would have given this FG location a 3 star, but after I ate and was about to leave, I saw a nice red roach making a run for the door w/o paying.

This particular Five Guys is very well managed.  The employees are the best I've seen in a fast food restaurant.

Also, it's the first time we've seen the new Soda Machines where you can fine tune your soda.  Diet Cock Raspberry/Vanilla for me!!  Sweet!!

The burgers are the best.  Always eat ""In"" at a Five Guys.  When you take the fries home they cool off and get nasty.  Eat the Fries Hot!!

Burgers were wonderful as always.  Never had a bad Five Guys burger.  Never.

Try the hot sauce sometime on your burger.  It's more like spicy ketchup.  It's not that hot either.  Just spicy.

Try dipping your fries in the Malt Vinegar they offer.  It's a unique taste and something different that ketchup.

It has been about 3 years since I last set foot in a Five Guys, now I remember why! Last Saturday we were in the neighborhood and wanted to try somewhere besides our usual places and the kids wanted cheeseburgers, so Five Guys it is. I do not have any complaints in regards to the restaurant itself or the service for that matter. I do have an issue with the quality of the food or I should say the lack there of.

We got there a little after 11 am when they opened, there were about 3 tables occupied already. I stood staring at the menu for a couple of minutes trying to decide what I wanted. I did notice their prices were higher than In n Out but they offered more topping variations so I thought whatever. I opted for the Cheeseburger ($6.89) with grilled mushrooms and onions, A1 sauce on the side. The kids each got their little Cheeseburger ($5.09) Large fries ($5.09) and Large soda ($2.79) All that set us back $26.98, I thought it was quite steep for fast food burgers but hey if they're great, why not. Boy was I wrong!!! That had to be one of the worst burgers I've had, I purposely asked for the A1 sauce on the side so I could taste the burger and not risk over powering it with the sauce. There was no distinction to that burger, no sweetness offered by the grilled onions or the earthiness of the mushroom. Heck I didn't even detect any salt or pepper on the burger! I was not expecting a mind blowing experience for the price but I did expect it to be at least up to par with In n Out or even better, I mean if you're going to charge me $6.89 for a cheeseburger by itself (compared to In n Out Double-double @ $3.20) then I sure would hope it'll taste somewhat decent. For that price I can get a Double-double with fries and a drink at In n Out. The fries have nothing going on for them either. I thought it was cool for them to have peanuts to help yourself with while waiting for your order but even that was just okay, some of the peanuts tasted really stale and old.

The ""little"" burgers are usually enough to fill me up, but if you have a larger appetite, their regular sizes are double patties.

Everything is cooked fresh in an open kitchen, so the smells are great when you first walk in.

Try their cajun fries if you like salty goodness.  They are really really salted and spiced (hot spicy), so I do a french fry shake or two to get most of it off before I eat it, but they are much better tasting than the reg fry.

This was my first visit to Five Guys, and if it is your first time, I think it is important to know a ""little"" burger is one patty, while the standard burger is two, and unless you're a family of four, a regular size fry will be more than you can possibly finish. They basically fill the entire sack with fries! I tried my best to consume them all. They are fresh, cut thicker variety, closest to a Wendy's fry, but with more evidence of a real potato. 

As for the burger, they offer a respectable selection of toppings, as many as you want for no additional charge. I went basic with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. It is served up on a soft sesame bun. The patty isn't the thickest, so if you're passionate about your meat, you might want the standard. However, I was more than pleased with the little. It gave me just the right amount of charbroiled tastiness to go along with my burger salad.

The lady who was cleaning the tables asked if we were ok and if we needed anything and offered to take my trash ... it felt like I was at a nice sit down restaurant and I told my boyfriend wow they're all so nice here and they were joking with each other.   I'm a firm believer that if you got good teamwork and enjoy your peers it makes work so much easier !!! 

Ok let's get to the food.  Their regular burger is two patties of meat and you can choose a hamburger, cheeseburger, or bacon cheeseburger.  Then you custom your burger with your choice of toppings.  The bacon is super crispy which I love.  Also huge portions of fries.  Boyfriend and I usually just share the regular fries ... which is more than plenty.  The guy also said their regular fries normally feed 2-3 people. Also there are unlimited amounts of free peanuts for you to enjoy.  

Cons.  I think it's a little pricey ... maybe if they had combos it would appear a little cheaper then ordering everything separate.  I have to admit the only thing I like from here is the fries .. my preference for a burger joint is In-N-Out (sorry Five Guys) ... however my boyfriend craves this so we go here from time to time.

5790086,2016-12-26,0,Q5sn7sP6v_lk3pxn0xVIlA,"I LOVE Five Guys Burger and Fries! You an choose your toppings to put as little (or as much) variety as you want. It's cooked well done (no pink center) which I appreciate and like. They're sort of like Jack in The Box....they don't make it until you order it. Which is great because it's fresh food. The fries are delicious! The little fries are enough (in my opinion) for 2 people because they give you so much! This is definitely great for your money. They are so friendly and courteous. My order was done correctly. And, there's the wonderful peanuts! Did I mention that I love peanuts? Well, these are also great and another reason why I love going to Five Guys.

Worth noting:
A ""little"" burger is just 1 patty. The other is 2 patties. Something I wish I knew about when going the first time since the burger is quite large. Little hamburger is by no means ""little.""",7nEnXfmm3ICIJtGtFAMMuQ,0,0,5,xeLoD1NfR5aYyf576M7FGw

After a hard day of outlet mall shopping, mom and I were getting a case of the hungers. She hasn't been to a five guys before so it was time to introduce her to deliciousness. 

When you walk in you see where the potato's are from, like which farm. When you walk up to the counter it is laid out pretty easy. You have your choice of hamburger or double meat hamburger and a whole list of toppings. Cheese, bacon, bbq sauce, mustard, jalapeno's, its made however you want it.

Now the frie's are my favorite part. While im not a fan of the cajun fry's, i do love the regular fry's. Even better is that a regular order will feed 2 people. They just toss your burgers in a bag and shove it full of fry's. 

The coke machine was mom's favorite part, It is a touchscreen that allows you to choose from about 50 some off soda combinations. Cherry coke, Lime Dr Pepper, just image having that as a kid the flavors of our suicides would of been!",bvr5-SZikO9DexmFmCn_4g,0,0,4,M5XKucnqnu6cOV6VME8Bng
