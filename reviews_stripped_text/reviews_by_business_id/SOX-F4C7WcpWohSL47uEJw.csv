First let me warn ya...this restaurant is in a not so good area and gave me the creeps even in plain daylight. 

Anyways, I ordered the chilaquiles which come with 2 eggs any style and beans.  They come in red or green sauce. The red sauce was supposedly mild and the green sauce was hot so I went with the red. One bite and quickly realized they were simply awful and still too spicy, so then tried the eggs which I ordered over easy, and got rubber instead, so I quickly moved on and tried the beans and they were okay except they used the most smelliest cheese topper which made them uneatable. (this quickly felt like the story of Goldilocks and the three bears) Luckily my husband ordered birria de chivo (goat) which was some of the best I have had in Vegas, and best of all he was willing to share. It also came with plenty of fresh made corn tortillas. 

Not sure I'd come back even for the birria since the location is just simply not the safest looking place.  Also don't expect friendly service. .I am sure we can find better.",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,4,1,2,WyyODy7RGT6Jm9cCFtG8_g

A co-worker tipped me off about a little spot on the corner of Owens and Lamb that serves up some tasty goat, and when he made the motions and explained that fresh tortillas are served as well, I knew I had to check it out.

Anyone who knows me, knows that distance and location is not a concern to me, as long as there is good food to seek out, I'm there. Antojitos Estillo Michoac√°n Serves up Birria de Chivo(Goat) which is a specialty , and also Birria de Res(Beef). You may also choose to have your Birria dry, like a stew, or in a nice flavorful broth, and if you order the goat version, you can have it with just goat meat, or mixed with goat meat and other tasty goat parts....:9 

Chips, salsa, and a bean dip are given to you as you are seated...Chips were meh, but the tasty salsa and bean dip kinda made up for it                                                  

Of course, I went with traditional, and went all-in and got it mixed as well. Wifey wanted to try their Chilaquiles which was pretty disappointing(read her review), just as bad as the Chilaquiles at DW Bistro. The Birra was very tasty, the goat meat and other parts were soft and tender, the onions, lime, and salsas added to this dish, and add fresh tortillas to that? Simply a dish that I'd order again. Hopefully we're brave enough to drive out here when another craving hits, or find a safer looking location that serves up this tasty delicacy....ALOHA!!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,5,5,4,H4WllHspqdGAZsw4sUtMdg

That said, it's a hole in the wall with only a few tables. All the customers were locals who I bet don't even know what Yelp is and would probably like to keep it that way.

The food was great and we enjoyed every dish ordered. The service was friendly, but a little awkward since we weren't obviously locals or even Hispanic. I don't think they get a lot of outsiders for customers which makes this place even better. The prices were good, too.

It's a bit out of the way for us but we'd definitely stop by again.",3NqSmH1yHOLecWWjp0qUTA,0,0,5,CpFqJEz4kggpiyVbjek4sg
