The owner, came to us and told us to sit down, that they will make us something!  well me, baby is not fully vegan. He brought the chef and she asked me what I was in the mood for! #Wowness ! She told me some options of what she can make...  she made me a chickpea taco with tostones and salsa! Oh Lordy!! So so soooo good!!! And at the end came back to us to ask how everything was!! 
Definitely recommend this place if you are vegan or not, plus, it's super cute inside!!

Our waiter Jeremy was very knowledgeable about everything regarding the food and which wines and champagnes go well with what we were eating. The decor is beautiful and everything looks so classy!

455569,2017-09-23,0,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"Update- made a reservation and had family from out of town we were taking to dinner.  Arrived to find they had booked a private party and I was not notified.  Very disappointed.  Used to feel very welcome here.  I'm sure the food is still outstanding but not sure I'll be back.

Previous review- I need more stars to accurately rate Boteco.  I would say Boteco deserves 10 stars on a five star scale.  The food, presentation, service, drinks, atmosphere, everything is extraordinary. If you haven't been there yet you have to go, as soon as possible.  If you eat vegetarian (as I do) there are several delicious options. And there are vegan options as well.  You MUST try the Black Garlic Hummus with Veggie chips.  I won't spoil the surprise, but will tell you that dish alone is worth the visit. My husband says the Coq au Vin is the real stand out dish and the Happy Hour meatballs are fabulous.  If you don't try Boteco you are seriously missing out.  Been there for Sunday brunch too and HIGHLY recommend the Poor Knights of Windsor(AKA French toast).",1y2PIsntCnL7orgADTUAlw,0,0,3,GlOZSD5z5Nr7x9zNv7Y9uA

FOOD: Most of their dishes are made with some of the finest wines. I haven't had the chance to try their food during dinner, but their brunch dishes are pretty amazing. During brunch, they serve $1 raw oysters. The Steak and Eggs is probably my favorite dish here. The Chicken and Mash was not that impressive. The presentation of the food was beautiful. Pricing is perfect for a nice brunch that won't hurt your wallet.

DRINK: Sangria is free during weekend brunch and you get the choice between white or red wine. They serve specialty Bellini, coffee, wines, and more.

1224453,2017-09-17,0,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,Decided on Boteco for a birthday dinner and it turned out to be a perfect choice. Lucky to have a spot with this kind of creative and affordable menu in the GV area because you usually have to go to the Strip for similar food in Vegas. It's awesome to get samplings of different cuisines from different areas at the same restaurant. We had six courses plus a prosecco flight (that was enough for both of us to drink) for less than $100. Service was friendly and helpful.

Cons: Not much. Limited drink menu.

Details: We went late on a Friday so I can't speak to when they are busy, but our service was great. Our waiter struck a good balance of checking in and letting us be. We ordered two drinks, an appetizer and two entrees. One of the entrees was escargot (really a starter) and it was ok to good. The highlight was the steak with yucca,  so delicious. My fiance also got desert but didn't share so I can't comment on that. The drinks were pretty good, about $10 each. We will check it out again.",5G0RQ4kAsBOPSJsKwWnaSg,1,2,4,AAJX00jVsrZgq7JtWtWyUw

My brother ordered the Wienerschnitzel which was a big fat chunk of chicken that had had the life deep-fried out of it. He actually sent it back and got another chunk of chicken, Slightly less deep-fried. When we asked whether hand frying wasn't the correct way to prepare it, we were told that deep fry what is the standard way. I'd like to see a place in Austria and Germany try and deep-fried a thick cut of chicken or veal Wienerschnitzel and get away with it. Didn't even come with a lemon. The sweet potato gnocchi appetizer was gummy mushy and tasteless. Maybe we didn't hit one of the ""perfect dishes ""that our waiter told us the place specialized. But they never should've brought that horrible weinerschnitzel in  the first place.

1562262,2018-03-27,1,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"Wow! This a hidden gem entirely unexpected tucked away in this busy strip mall. It is a culinary event with phenomenal wine choices without obnoxious prices. There's even a list of discontinued wines at a lower cost. The food prices are a bit high and the flavor and options are fresh new and delicious. The only disappointment was the seared tuna- my husbands favorite so of course we ordered it. It was presented beautifully but was way too overdone leaving it dry tough and not very tasteful. The dips, schnitzel, Brussel sprouts and octopus were phenomenal. Carnevino is the only place I've ever had octopus this good in the US. Love this place a will be back soon. 


UPDATE
After a second visit here I was sadly disappointed in everything. We took friends just days after our first experience and everything fell short- food service caliber and quality. 

The response I got was that the various chefs use their own flare which is nice but consistency has to be maintained to some aspect. The first time we ordered 3 dips that were in jars filled to the brim. This time we had 4 tabs each were 1/2 to 1/3 filled. Thee were 4 of us so I requested additional bread for these. The large chicken schnitzel dinner we had 4 days prior was now 1/3 the size and on a side plate though still an entree. To get the additional $3 charge for the extra bread was enough to make me realize that this place unfortunately is not what I had thought or hoped.",03iMNggjXP2tOkfih15ccA,3,0,3,2ppgxTwzuQ2NXKK47aIAXw

1800461,2018-03-25,1,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"While I gave Boteco five stars ( and they certainly deserve it), I have to start with a qualifier. If you are a meat-and-potatoes type of person, this restaurant is not for you. The restaurant has a small eclectic menu. But if you are a fan of large portions of basic food, you may find nothing on this menu that will interest you. The top of third of the menu  consists of a  very interesting variety of  small plates.  The lower 2/3  are entree size portions.Having said that, we decided to try dishes that we had never had before. We started on meal with one of the small dishes, the octopus garden. The seared octopus tentacle was in a bowl lined with roasted red pepper puree. Absolutely delicious. We shared two entrees. The Moqueca de Camarao is a shrimp dish in a dende coconut milk sauce. We worried that the dende might be too spicy. But we were assured that while it had some kick it would not be too much for a gringo pallet. They did not lie. It came with a bowl of white rice. There were three small beans that are on top of the white rice. Those were really spicy. Unless you like stuff really really hot, your best to avoid those three beans. But overall, an outstanding dish. We also shared the black truffle cream pasta. This is a fettuccine dish with black truffle butter and black truffle zest with Parmesan cheese. My favorite of the three dishes.
Service throughout the meal was excellent. I also appreciated at Alex, the owner, came around and helped with the service and also to check that everything was going well. I definitely will be returning to try some of the other more interesting items on the menu.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,2,7,5,T07iy_bJ7qcMIhQjQ643tg

1881709,2017-06-12,0,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"I call this place classy. Service was spot on from start to finish and each plate was detailed and complex.

Tapas were of decent size and we shared between us two. Food ordered:

Pork belly baos
-the pickled pineapple was the surprise ingredient here. Pork belly wasn't overdone and had the right amount of fat. Buns needed to be a little more fluffy and it would've been perfect

Singapore chili crab
-the chili sauce at the bottom has real crab meat mixed into it already so you needn't worry about shelling a lot of crab like the actual dish. Egg is fried with sunny side up (rather than incorporated in the sauce) so you can mix it in the sauce to get a creamer texture. It wasn't overly sweet or Spicy! You can dip the shishito peppers in it. Came with Asian crackers

Braised chicken and mash
- chicken is off the bone and super tender! No need to use your hands! The flavor was amazing, I can't explain it. You can definitely taste the red wine. The bacon was fried very crispy, it was good! The pearl onions will give you bad breath but it's worth it lol the mashed potatoes were wonderfully seasoned and flavored.

Brigadeiro Beast aka brazilian chocolate condensed milk dessert.
-garnished with chocolate balls that gave it a crunch, strawberries, blueberries and plum. Very rich and creamy

I loved the presentation of each dish along with how it was presented. I think it is reasonably priced for the quality of food you're getting. They are memorable but these recipes would be hard for anyone to mimick. you can't get them elsewhere and that's what this place gas it going for them.

We ordered 1 item (crab dip) about 3 minutes after our initial order of Sliders, black garlic dip and the meat and cheese board. The food was bordering on amazing, but the crab dip we ordered came after asking the two waiters (they team served but often forgot to communicate) 3x and 30 minutes later. The dip was worth the wait, but the service just took us out of enjoying our evening. On top of all of that, we had full glasses of water 2x in our hour and ten minute dining experience. I would caution anyone coming here to make sure to order everything at once, or you may not be as patient as we were.

1993587,2017-07-05,14,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"Came in for grand opening night with a few friends. Boteco is a new wine bar and tapas concept that should fit in great in this plaza, a welcome addition that offers class and creative cuisine in an area anchored by Twin Peaks and lunch-hours-only options. 

 Chef Rachel's globally-inspired menu features several dishes with Asian influence, from a trio of bao generously loaded with pork belly to a Thai crab ""dip"" with prawn crackers that riffed in ceviche, and more of a European influence in the bite-size Escargot Croquetas. The Avocado Crunch salad I ordered reminded me of gazpacho, would make a refreshing summer option on their soon-to-open patio.

Other than the eats, Boteco has a selection of interesting wines from around the world as well as a weekend brunch (foie gras benedict and champagne pancakes!) and a monthly tasting menu dinner ($65/pp). Don't forget to try a dessert: the salted caramel bundino was our favorite.

The service provided great information and enthusiasm for the dishes but unfortunately some fell flat, not matching descriptions or simply underwhelming. Will return once they settle in more, has lots of promise.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,15,3,q-GX5VlCPT8KuQyYdu4bAw

First, the atmosphere on their patio is absolutely incredible. The lights, the decor and vibe is straight out of a European cafe. A warm night drinking wine on this patio is something I could do a little too often. 

Second, the food. OMG. I'm notoriously hard to impress (Even Gordon Ramsay's Steak at the Venetian failed to do so) and this place had me BEYOND impressed. From their ""worldly"" starters (small bites from different parts of the globe) to their main courses, every item was better than the last. We had the sliders (to die for) and the braised beef with crispy parmesean rice (just as good). For these prices, the quality and taste of the food was absolutely stellar. 

Thirdly, the wine. Everything we tried was phenomenal. By the owner's suggestions, my closed minded-ness of only cab's and pinot's was blown wide open. I can not wait to go back and try more. And again, the price point was super reasonable. (I've had awful glasses of wine for double the cost)

The owners are two of the nicest people; knowledgeable and sweet.. being around them was like being around old friends. Hearing about their experiences travelling and eating was such a pleasure. 

Thank you for such an incredible evening. We fell in love.. with your restaurant, the experience and even a little bit more with each other.",VsIWfWGMd9HGFN53pjcayQ,5,4,5,mkPPcnulfiwXVFgq2xvUOA

The food, other than the black truffle pasta (Fri&Sat only) were tasteless, odd or just not to my liking.  Maybe you will feel different.  There were four of us, we ordered a pitcher of Sangria, tasted watered down and weak.
We go to a lot of Tapas bars and love them and therefore had high hopes for Boteco.  Our server was almost too attentive, almost telling us how to eat each dish.
All-in-all we will not be going back and we found the prices restrictive for anything other than a drink and a tapa... don't go for dinner, the menu is limited.

However I was extremely disappointed. It took the staff 10 minutes after seating us to get me and my mother 2 glasses of water we ordered upon being seated. Our alcoholic drinks even came before the water. We order the shrimp and again were disappointed to find the shrimp were tiny and not much better than what you can buy at Vonns. We also orders the foie gras Benedict and steak and eggs. They were alright in taste, but it took extremely long for them to come out, about 20 minutes after the shrimp for the foie gras Benedict and 30 minutes for the steak and eggs. When the steak and eggs came out they originally gave it to the wrong table and they cooked the eggs incorrectly. We ordered over medium and they came over easy. As it seemed the food takes a long time to cook, so we ordered the strawberry champagne pancakes while still eating and the waiter assured us it will be quick. This was not the case and after another 30 minutes we cancelled the order. The owner saw that we were unpleased and came to talk to us. As she was talking to us the pancakes came out, probably due to confusion on the staff. Instead of just giving us the $8.00 pancakes the owner told the waiter to take it back after already presenting it to us. Giving us the pancakes for free after enduring the mediocre brunch could have made up for the bad service but the owner did not.",YKKc2jrG0Xbl-LVj4RZ1-g,0,0,1,WUqaafGZtn1zfkh8rXIh3Q

Which I could remember his name because he deserves all the props. Anyway, we ordered:

Black garlic hummus- so rich and an earthy. Had an amazing and unique flavor. Recommend ordering only one of the conservas if you're ordering a bunch of other food because the bread can be filling.

Brussels sprouts- soooo good. They were crispy, but didn't have burnt flavor. The honey balsamic gave then a really nice flavor.

Chicken + mash- the chicken was super tender and flavorful. A few bones, but overall really good. The Parmesan potatoes were really smooth and not too heavy.

Salmon noir- flaky, crispy, and juicy, but nothing too unique. However, it was a perfectly cooked piece of fish. 

Octopus- really tender! The sweet potato mash and jumbo beans were perfect accompaniments- a little sweet, a little salty went great with the octopus. 

Moqueca de Camarão- (Brazilian shrimp stew with coconut cashew rice) this was a favorite. The stew was bright and very aromatic. Rice had a subtle coconut flavor that was perfect with the shrimp. 

Overall, we loved everything. It's a small place and by 6:15 the restaurant was full, which is a good sign. They deliver bold flavors and unique dishes that do not disappoint!!",JBLRC5b0iz7gosMb-orYAw,0,3,5,z0q1ZkPXCION1Vqi-fp5Yg

loved the hangar beef sliders! delicious blend of flavors that harmoniously melt in your mouth! smoked gouda cheese with a sweet and smokey onion marmalade, tomatoes, and garnish greens! comes in 3 so it is easily shareable. 

we also tried the spanish ham dish with an interesting story. can't say it was amazing, but for the high price point, it was interesting to say the least. texture was similar to a ham jerky, but with a little gamey edge.. 

braised chicken & mash were great. texture of mash was smooth and you can definitely tell it was butter blended. complimented the chicken quite well! 

not a huge fan of the braised beef & rice because it was super salty. neither of us could take more than a single bite because the flavor was not that great overall and the beef was dry. 

selection of drinks were great since it is a cute wine bar restaurant. tried the hennessy mojito which was good. not too sweet and had a nice blend of ginger and mint. we tried the salmon cream cheese dip and the shrimp ceviche with a small bread basket as well! both were good & the bread was all fresh baked from a local vendor bakery!

Great higher end restaurant in local Henderson.  A nice outdoor seating area that's pet friendly and a calmness in the patio make it a great outdoor venue.

The Singaporean crab dip is extremely good with a nice chili kick and rice cakes.  And the white sangria was a stalwart - boozy and only $6.

The peppers had good flavors, but was quite soggy. They were not charred enough. The highly popular chilli crab was too salty to me. Definitely didn't taste like the chilli crab I had in Singapore. The shrimp ceviche was basically whole pieces of little shrimps in a marinara sauce - skip this at all costs. The black truffle cream was i think the best item we ordered. It was creamy, smooth, and rich. The conservas menu came with bread rolls, which made sense for the truffle cream, but not for the ceviche. We got there around 5:30 on a Friday night and were promptly seated. Service was good. They ran a happy hour from 5-6:30, so i tried their red sangria ($5) and mojito ($8).

The dining area isn't too big however dining on the outside patio is also an option. our server was nice and checked on us often. 

Chicken and Mash ($14) - Braised chicken, red wine mushrooms, pearl onions and bacon with a side of buttered potato puree. This was the one thing on the menu I couldn't wait to try. It's Chef Rachel's twist on Coq Au Vin. Seeing this dish arrive at the table, it looked presented well and I couldn't wait to dig in. The potatoes are made with 50 percent butter and tasted so effing delicious! If you order anything here, order the mashed potatoes! The chicken was served in a  dish that had no red wine sauce in it. I as well my friends agreed that this dish was lacking the sauce and was dry with out it. I asked our server for some of the red wine sauce to pour over the chicken and it made such a huge difference! I did get a free sangria with this meal which was a great deal however it didn't taste that great. 

Strawberry and Champagne Pancakes ($8) - These are dutch baby style pancakes. The price is very fair, but the way these tasted left us all needing a drink just to swallow each bite. Too crispy on the outside and still somewhat raw in the center. 

Salted Caramel Budino ($6) - Caramel toffee, vanilla custard and crunchy fleur de sel. Though not as good as the now closed DOCG, this one will do just fine. We also got some type of apple strudel (also $6) and we all pretty much enjoyed the desserts more than the actual food.

The menu is kinda limited, but I feel there's room for improvement and wouldn't be against giving Boteco another try in the future. Boteco has wine tastings and you can find any of the upcoming events on their social media pages.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,61,59,3,z7DXbsKWvEd6EjJreidSpA

Mount Charleston
Blueberry gravlax
Foie gras Benedict
Chicken and mash
Steak and egg with potatoes
Botequito sliders
Champagne pancakes
Caramel budino
Brigadeiro Beast--not ordered but brought out by the chef

A few of the dishes stand out--the blueberry gravlax. foie gras Benedict, and the chicken and mash.  The blueberry gravlax was well cured and was quite good.  The chicken with vegetables accompanied by very good mashed potatoes was a standout.  The chicken was tasty and the pearl onions added to the flavor.  The mashed potatoes were very well done.  The foie gras Benedict had two perfectly poached eggs on brioche toast with foie.

I was less impressed with the Mount Charleston and the champagne pancake. The steak and egg was listed as steak and latkes but the egg was served on a layered pile of thinly sliced, cooked potatoes.

The place has a bit of work to do to get their plates to match what the menu says.  Prices were reasonable.

I see that other people commented on the strip mall location, but I feel like this particular strip mall is building a reputation for above average food choices. We have become used to strip mall dining, and have been pleasantly surprised time and time again. It always feels like finding a hidden treasure, which is a good description for this place. 
Anyway, we came in late and I was nervous that we would be frowned upon for being that guy that comes in shortly before closing.  Not so, we were welcomed as if we were the first customer of the night. We ordered 4 items from the tapas menu and all were exceptional. I would post pictures, but my phone died - wah wah. 
I will do my best to paint a mental picture.:) First I must say that the food was creative. I had 4 things that I've never had before. The first dish to arrive was the Hennessy Peppers. They were delicious! Lightly tossed in a teriyaki inspired sauce and aren't spicy. Next arrived the Singapore Chili Crab, which reminded me of a hot pot. They are accompanied by bowl shaped, melt in your mouth (literally) wafers. This was my favorite dish and was a lovely blend of flavors and textures. Next, the Botecoquito Sliders. I think I remember the server saying the meat was a mix of beef and bacon, which is never a bad idea. The bread is sourced from the bakery next door, and how they put the sliders together was an artful mix of flavors. I would go on, but this review is too long already. 
Long story short, the food embodies creativity, ultra fresh ingredients, skill and care. The service was top notch. We will be back.",26eyRCj5n5Sq9jA4MuqZSw,0,2,5,zjnXztzhZUwsuSJTwUHfyw

4272167,2017-10-03,0,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"What a cute addition to this popping plaza. Boteco is a much needed wine bar/tappas spot in a plaza that already has some great finds, but was missing a classy late night drinking spot. The plaza is filled with tons of day time restaurants and a slightly grimy bar- Boteco was exactly what I needed. 
The place is brightly lit and the indoors has a daytime brunch feel. If you're looking for a dimmer, more romantic spot this might not be it. Or just sit outside. 
They have a nice selection of wines, a prosecco flight and just 2 beers on tap. I would have loved to have a wine flight option! 
They didn't have any tapas that stood out for me. Also only salad for a vegetarian option.

4382764,2017-08-05,0,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"I was really excited about trying this wine bar and it took some consideration about whether I wanted to give Boteco a three or a four rating. Overall, I liked the wine and food, but I don't feel the need to rush back.

We arrived on the early end of dinner time on a Saturday evening and were seated right away. The inside of the restaurant is on the smaller side with a contemporary feel. There are about a dozen tables and a long booth along one wall. In front is a small patio for cooler evenings. 

The menu is limited for both food and drink. In the evening there are just over a dozen savory items and a few sweet items to choose from on the menu. The alcohol menu offered about three cocktail options and a small selection of red wines, white wines, and bubbly drinks. There is also a flight option to choose a mix of the wine options. 

My husband and I started with a wine flight, choosing one red and two whites. We enjoyed all three of the wines. The flight was served on a vertical stand which was great for saving space on the table. 

Our food choices were Botequito Sliders, Chicken & Mash, and a Boteco board. The Boteco board was actually served on two boards and came with four meats, four cheeses, some bread, honey, nuts, granola, fruit, and mustard. Everything on the boards was delicious and a generous portion. This was more than enough for two to share and could probably serve three to four people if ordering other food items. The Botequito Sliders were good and had nice thick slices of cheese. The Chicken & Mash was yummy and probably my favorite item. The chicken had a nice flavor and the mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery. 

We liked the food and we liked the wine so why not four or five stars? A limited menu usually isn't a turn off for me. Typically I appreciate that a restaurant just offers what they do well, but the actual food items offered on the menu seemed a bit disjointed to me. I also expected this to be more like a wine bar, but the actual wine offerings were slim. There were only three or four red wines and three or four white wines offered. Our server was nice enough, but he played a joke soon after we sat down. He carried on for too long so it ended up being awkward. We have a sense of humor, but it wasn't a good joke so we were just confused. The tables were also a bit tiny for the dining style. We felt like we had to rush through some of our food just to make space on the table. 

I'm not opposed to returning for a brunch or joining a friend here if invited, but it's not at the top of my list.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,8,5,3,_RPk4RI_BSUmh0p0sKdyuQ

Environment: the restaurant is pretty small in a popular plaza. It is kind of a hidden gem and looks a bit fancy inside. This would make a great date spot.

Service: the waiter was friendly and quick to serve. The food came out at a moderate pace, allowing you to try each food one by one which I enjoy. 

Food and drinks: the food was very exotic but tasty. I had the pork rind with the dip which was delicious. I also got the chicken and mash potatoes which was very tender and juicy. The pork baos were also very good, the pork being very tender and sweet. The drinks I enjoyed too, but did not stand out much for me. The sangria was good, but I felt like the fruits were just added on top rather than marinated. The Hennessy mojito was good too, and they also had a wide variety of wine options which is probably more popular.

This place definitely makes a great date spot. Remember it is tapas so the entrees are small, but they are fun to share amongst friends and gives you the option to try a variety of things.",6n3aU2lfldd5w4kP15OqpA,0,0,4,VT3AwkRwZlFLvMzjpqsmrQ

It's a tiny location, so I'd recommend making a reservation. The servers and owner are great. There was a brief mix up with who our server was, so the owner comped our drinks, which was incredibly nice. Service was top notch, and so was the food. You can order various spreads for your bread - each of which comes in a cute little jar. The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had (and I've tried a lot of brussel sprouts). My husband loved the chips that come with a bacon jam/blue cheese dip and the pampas steak churrasco (I'm a vegetarian, so I passed on these items). We also ordered the boteccine (pasta) with black truffle cream, which was amazing. Overall, an excellent experience.

We do not have large appetites so we only ordered three, but each offered a decidedly different flavor profile.  We started off with the blue cheese cream that came with house made kettle chips.  This was followed by moqueca de camarao, a.k.a. shrimp in Brazilian Dende sauce.  I have had this dish elsewhere and would only rate this version as good. The highlight of the meal was the truffled mac and cheese.  I do not enjoy mac and cheese and will only take a small bite when my wife orders it, but this version was amazing.

5094979,2017-07-20,13,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"Sigh.

Many have tried to capture the spirit and sense of place of a casual eatery in Italy, Spain or Portugal.  None have.  Funny, a strip mall locations with views of parking lots, asphalt streets and traffic lights isn't quite the same.

Props for the beautiful plating and presentation  and for creating liquor tasting and pairing events.  

Meaning no disrespect to the chef, wanting to feel that old world charm, the best things on the menu are NOT cooked.  Instead top props to the Boteco boards (nice selection of charcuterie and cheese platter with accompaniments), Jamon Iberico (thin slices of cured ham from the famed acorn fed black footed pigs with a side of crushed tomato topped bread), and traditional caviar service, all paired with a simple glass of wine.

Note:  Caviar is Kaluga, from sustainably managed populations of giant river sturgeon so don't hate me.  Flavor profile not as pronounced as osetra with a more yolky, briny, but far less salty flavor.

For cooked dishes, the chicken and mash is good.  Red wine braised chicken, that is oddly too tender (young chicken) and lacks the deep chickeny flavor you'd expect from such a dish.  As a result, the bacon used dominates.  The buttered potato puree good, lacks the depth of flavor of European butter.  The Singapore Chili Crab, OK as a dish, but should be renamed.  There is NOTHING about the flavors that remotely taste of the iconic crab dish.  High expectations, destroyed.

Well chosen selection of wines with good by the glass offerings.   Fair markup.  Do look for tasting flights for the best value and a bit of fun.

Off Strip friendly but still a little nervous service.  This should improve with time.

In the end, if you look at this as a restaurant and NOT as they say, a European casual dining spot, Boteco delivers.  Fall for the marketing and sadly, you will be disappointed.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,19,16,3,Y2uGKlhXqaNh5V3MmxcnRQ

5279876,2017-05-22,6,8tMy7yEeNVYylVVFRlPmdQ,"Stated to be ""not a bar, a pub nor a restaurant"" on its website, but rather a ""local no-frills meeting place for friends and family,"" even as it proudly touts Chef Rachel LeGloahec's fine-dining pedigree on a separate page, Boteco opened on 5/12/17 to limited fanfare on Social Media in the face of substantial hype for two other new restaurants, the decision to pay such an early visit based largely on a Brunch menu that seemed significantly underpriced for the sort of plates it suggested

Owned by the same people involved with the cooking school, the change in concept bringing Maine native and former White Barn Inn Chef LeGloahec into the fold to create dishes of ""superior flavors made from seasonal and fresh ingredients,"" first impressions on entering Boteco are created by clean lines and dark leather with light-fixtures made from repurposed Wine bottles, the music overhead a low-key blend with only one other diner present just past 9:30am on Saturday, the hotrod show outside seeing the parking lot quite full as Crepe Expectations' line snaked out it's door

Describing its cuisine as ""embrac(ing) recipes that are fused from cultures around the world - no borders or boundaries,"" but clearly taking a French angle given the Chef's pedigree and list of ingredients, those visiting Boteco for Brunch are greeted by a menu of less than a dozen plates ranging anywhere from Pancakes and a Parfait to Steak and Eggs or a Foie Gras Benedict, plus Espresso drinks served at even-higher-than-the-Strip charge of four bucks per shot, no discounts for a double with the cost on the bill for two a staggering sixteen dollars.

Reportedly offering free Mimosas on this particular morning, though it was not until the Chef stopped by that the deal was explained...and no Mimosa ever did arrive...it was with an all-in approach omitting Caviar, Oysters and a Charcuterie board that seven plates were ordered to divide amongst three people, the dishes sent out as they were readied from the kitchen with portions quite big for the price-point, though one wished frequently that the pace of a place suggesting it ""provides the set and the setting to slow down in the company of one another and exchange experiences paired with great conversation"" would course things out more appropriately and, indeed, 'slow down.'

Admittedly still in its earliest days, the lone server overselling most dishes but generally quite pleasant and well-versed in the ingredients and technique, Brunch began with the Mt. Charleston Parfait featuring Organic Greek Yogurt and Birchemuseli with a wide variety of Fruits and Berries, the fact that Cherries had not been pitted a risky mistake that fortunately did not cause any harm while the $12 Champagne Pancakes pictured and described on the menu as 'Japanese style' were instead served as a Dutch Baby with a side of Champagne Zabaglione, the menu updated just hours later now listing the version served appropriately for a cost of $4 less than what was paid

Told by the Chef that changes were already upcoming, a mere eight days and two Brunch services apparently enough to inform the owners that some terminology was 'scaring off' potential patrons, plate three featured Blueberry Gravlax now described on the menu as Vodka Cured Salmon, the velvety housemade Fish nicely paired to traditional accoutrements with more than enough to go around while the Coq Au Vin was a truly remarkable dish with tender Chicken, Mushrooms and Vegetables cooked in the classic style with Red Wine and served with near-Robuchon quality 50% Butter Mashed Potatoes

As yet not unafraid to challenge diners with a few luxury ingredients, though the updated Brunch Menu seems to have done away with Charcuterie, Cheese, Oysters and Caviar in exchange for Cobb Salad, Breakfast Casserole and a 'Hangover' Patty Melt, those interested in something truly decadent should happily invest $14 in the Foie Gras Benedict complete with two 63° Eggs atop Buttered Brioche and Mushroom-Bacon Hash, the now-dinner-only Sliders another great bite with a loose grind topped in Bacon Jam and Gouda while the previously misspelled ""Steak & Sunny Side Laktes"" are now termed Steak & Eggs with Potato Pave, a $1 price-cut from $14 really not something Boteco should have had to do as the Medium-rare Steak tasted as good as many of the city's Dry-Aged versions with melting Garlic Butter and a stack of thinly sliced Potatoes cooked crispy

Not always offering Desserts at Brunch, but happy to do so if some have already been readied for Dinner service, it was with a complimentary taste of the texture-rich ""Brigadeiro Beast"" that the meal came to its conclusion, the flavor of Brazilian Nescau Milk Chocolate far more bitter than some might expect while the Salted Caramel Budino was simple and well-balanced with flecks of Fleur de Sel, the elegant presentation at first appearing a touch small but in reality plenty to share around and the perfect amount of sweet at the end of a pleasant breakfast",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,7,3,oEJXp4LxoZsXoo3HQK65-w

If they are trying to save money by only having one person serve the entire restaurant I would have to say its having negative consequences. Its a shame as I was looking forward to trying many of the dishes. 

Thanks for ruining our night out.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,0,1,DifgVE4j6CjSRBMjyhJd1w

Service is absolutely deplorable there. I've had more attention at an ice cream shop. On a Tuesday night, one server is all you need for the room but he's got to be able. We asked him about the menu, says he doesn't know much, never really ate the food. Asked him about wine, says he doesn't know much, hasn't gotten a clue about wine. Never got waters for our table, never asked if we needed another round of drinks, had to ask to order dessert, coffees, if we liked or food, took forever to buss our table, never said thank you, come again. Nothing. Our $215 bill could have been a lot bigger if he was just more attentive and I cringed tipping him. For this reason alone, I would not go back. The food was ok but not good enough where I could look past it. 

The octopus was sublime, jamon plate was amazing, gnocci was creative but the main dishes fell flat and the desserts in our humble opinion were sweet and that's about it. Unless you like overly sweet - skip 'em. Bathroom was clean and nice with mouthwash in there. I can appreciate the ambience but please consider changing the music from the top 40s station!

We both felt the same, just Okay, nothing really special. The potatoes had way too much butter, for our taste, the chicken dish was too sauty, and I would have  preferred vegetables along with the dish. The service was excellent, and the decor was done with Professional Care.",KSIvZhOy-kF5VtsIpijCnA,1,0,3,4k8q76cHzWEK3yEwxvoD6w
