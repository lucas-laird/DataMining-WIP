The food was absolutely delicious! I ordered the breakfast sandwich and swapped out the chipotle mayo for the garlic aioli. The sandwich was flavorful and the ingredients perfectly complemented each other. The side of potatoes were extra crispy and tasted more like chips. They were probably the best potatoes I've ever had. I also tried the queen bee's latte. It sounded unique, but it was actually kind of basic. 

Overall, a lovely place for brunch with outstanding food.",YYXHhd16RZR4HqLmfz_ANA,0,0,5,8e_xHRet0qnrkz4N1Kn7bg
1066003,2018-03-04,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"The place has a nice ambience when my wife and I first walked in. It was around 11 am Saturday. There was no one to greet us at the door. We were a bit confused. We saw a line to the cashier but were not sure if the line were for to-go or dine-in. My wife and I decided to get in the line (15 plus people). After 30 min of waiting in line, we came to find out that after we order, we have to wait approximately 25 min to have a table. At this time, there were about 8 people standing around who ordered already but without a table. We angrily left the restaurant without ordering anything. I am not in the restaurant business but this place is poorly run. I believe there should be someone at the door to figure out if the customers were dining in or ordering to-go. If it's dining in, tell them how long the wait and assign them tables before they walk up to the cashier to order or direct them directly to the cashier if ordering to-go. I think if they can make some improvements on this aspect of the restaurant, I might give them another try.",NcFRXsA7cbfPDF7SVloUxA,0,0,2,l3Bs1u2vfxiEwkG_-vIU2Q

1253711,2018-02-20,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"Neighbors opened just a couple weeks ago. It's a hip modern-style cafe; upon walking in you're entering a large walkway area to the order station. If you take a look around while walking up to the cashier you'll notice it's somewhat of a minimalistic style, simple but eye-catching and decorated with greenery. 

I came here mainly for coffee, and found out their coffee menu is also very minimalistic -- definitely not a bad thing because as they say, less is more right? They have a Queen Bee latte sweetened with honey and topped with cinnamon that tastes amazingggg. My friend jovi got an iced mocha latte which, as simple as can be, was made to perfection. It tasted amazing as well! Now moving on to the food menu, found on the back of their paper menu rather than the board. More extensive than the coffee menu and offering a few vegan choices as well (for those of your interested). I have yet to try a vegan option on their menu, maybe on my next visit. 

I've visited Neighbors twice (with jovi) during their grand opening and ordered the mushroom burger on the first visit and the salmon toast on the second visit. The presentation of the food definitely fit the modern, millennial style of the cafe (even most of the employees fit into that type of ""style"" if that makes sense). One bite of the mushroom burger and OH MY GOODNESS  it was made with a beef patty and topped with onions and a bun with some kind of aioli sauce if I remember correctly. Jovi ordered the avocado toast, and I declined her offer to try a bite since my mouth was too busy with my burger, but she could not get over how good it was either! The second visit with my salmon toast and a side of greens also left me  it was basically their version of a lox bagel but on a slice of sourdough instead. Still bomb. am definitely going to visit again and again.",Fv_HnsFKqJ591qoVFAr86g,2,0,5,PeF9GArRo8NtkP5Q1z09ng

Literal fire because the Shakshuka has way more of a chili kick than I was expecting. With a morning beverage menu fit for the gods, I recommend the matcha latte because my boyfriend was matcha green with envy that I wouldn't let him taste it. 

Came here for breakfast with some co-workers and it was relatively busy for a Monday morning so I guess this is the spot to play hookey. You could call it a plant based restaurant since there are pots everywhere but the food is a mixture of millennial favorites such as avocado toast and gram worthy lattez.

People who are complaining because they have to get up to get their own utensils, water and condiments: It's 2 feet away. Don't knock off stars because you're SO LAZY. 
Also, you take a menu, look at it and decide what you want and order at the register. I'm sure we've all been to a McDonalds, lol. It's the same concept. If you have a hard time understanding that, then I don't know what to tell you. (It's not an extensive menu.) 

I've had something different every time I've visited and I haven't been disappointed yet. My favorite is probably the smashed potatoes they serve as a side. They're super crispy and seasoned well. My only complaint is that I wish the salmon they served with their salad wasn't as small.

The food was quite nice and the price range goes from $6-$12 with the average around $9. Portions were decent. Everybody was content with their food. The main reason for the 5 Stars was their service. We had ordered an açaí bowl and white mocha alongside with our other dishes. My brother had went up to order another dish while asking about it. They had forgotten the order, apologized, and let him get the other dish for free. Sometime later, his dish came, but the drink and açaí bowl was still missing. My cousin went up and inquired again. The management had apologized profusely for the long delay and actually even gave us an extra açaí bowl to go and refunded the drink and açaí bowl. This was way more than we expected.

1352505,2018-04-16,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"My friend and I were together earlier in the day and were wondering what to eat for lunch. Since we don't have the chance that often, and it was a Sunday, I offered up the idea of brunch since she loves breakfast foods. Considering our work schedules and tend to want to wake up so early on off days, breakfast foods is not often an option. 

When we had looked up brunch, this was one of the new places we didn't recognize and it was close by, so here we went for a new brunch experience.

Located just south of Russell and Ft Apache, Neighbors is located in the east half of a standalone building (totally thought they took the entire building until we walked in). Process is pretty simple. Go up to the counter to order and take a seat at a table of your choosing. To my own surprise, it wasn't as busy as I had expected. 

Menu is small but fairly wide in variety. My friend had gotten the 'Old School' with orange juice while i had 'Steak & Eggs' with a cappuccino. After paying, we were given a tag where they write your name vs a generic number tag to place on your table. Don't poke at the writing as it comes off easily. A regretful idea my friend dealt with.. hehe ! 

One thing we didn't know is you grab your own waters, utensils, napkins, and accompaniments (sauces) next to the order area. Didn't find that out until we got our food and asked the waiter who delivered. 

The 'Steak & Eggs' is a 8 oz ribeye topped with chimichurri sauce, smashed potatoes, farm eggs, and toast. 

Mildly splurged a little due to the rare occassion. Of course the steak had to be medium rare with over-easy eggs. Toast? Sourdough ! Steak was pre-sliced and stacked w/ layed chimichurri sauce. Not a perfect cook but still tender and juicy. Chimichurri sauce is one of my favorite sauces to go with a steak, if any sauce is used overall. The smashed potatoes was surprisingly yummy. Small boiled potatoes w/ skin cooked again on a skillet (this is all a guess) and pressed to break the skin and create some crispy fried aspects to the edges. This is something i've been wanting to try and it was pretty yummy ! Eggs were perfectly cooked. Sourdough bread was amazing ! one of the better sourdough breads i've had. Crispy but not too hard exterior with a soft chewy interior. Great top mop up some of that chimichurri sauce w/ the rich runny egg yolk

The 'Old School"" consists of 2 farm eggs any style, choice of double smoked bacon or sausage, smashed potatoes, and toast

Over medium eggs w/ choice of half smoked bacon and half sausage, and sourdough bread !  She said the bacon was a bit overcooked and hard to eat. The sausage was really yummy. Reminds me of a style of breakfast sausage. Very juicy and flavorful.

We both thoroughly enjoyed this bread and is highly recommended to anyone who tries this place out. The plating of the food is amazing (IG worthy hehe) and the portion size for the price is good. As another reviewer had said, cali style, vegas prices ! Heck ya ! 

Oh ! forgot to mention our drinks. OJ was nice and yummy. Drank it after having my cappuccino so made it taste sweeter than it should be. Nice amount of pulp too ! Cappuccino was pretty decent with a nice heart design in the foam. Fairly strong but tasty. Size wise of the cappuccino was mildly on the smaller side though. OJ was pretty good in size. 

I wanted to order coconut pancakes too but being two people and our small stomachs for the first meal of the day, yeah that definitely wouldn't work. Next time maybe? 

Friend had mentioned people complaining about the overall noise of the restaurant. I feel like its fairly normal. Open kitchen. Open dining room. What you expect? A library?",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,4,gTIYMcgm3tQ8VTBd2zT5Bw

The location is interesting. If we didn't find it on yelp, we never would've never noticed this place and could have easily just driven right by. It looked like a closed building at first glance. 

I was surprised to find that it's not one of those places that has a cool atmosphere but not so great coffee and food. We LOVED our breakfast and the coffee. Generous portions, everything tasted like it was made from scratch and they knew what they were doing. 

Love that they have take away coffee cups and to go boxes right at the counter. Makes it so easy!

Food came out really quick and the staff was really friendly. Clean bathrooms (which I have to note, because it's important!), nice spacious open and well lit restaurant.

1404714,2018-02-17,2,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"went yesterday and got a capp, avo toast, and side of smoked salmon for $19. it took about 15 minutes and it was good. everything about the experience was pretty good, but i'm disappointed that this has become the standard, especially considering how it has an almost perfect rating.

the concept is order at the counter and they bring it to you. i asked the woman at the register what was good since it was my first time. she recommended a dish and the only description offered was that it was gluten free and vegan, which it stated on the menu. i ordered and paid, and she flips the screen around to have me choose a gratuity and sign. the four options are 25%, 20%, 18%, or ""other."" in no way do i blame employees for trying to get tips, especially when establishments pay employees as little as possible. but it's counter service. and we live in a world where 15% is the standard, and 20% is for good service. 

the food comes and it's the wrong order. not by much - instead of a side of smoked salmon they brought the whole salmon toast dish (perhaps explaining why it took 15 minutes for a minimal order). i said i didn't order the dish, just a small side, and asked if i was charged for the dish or the side. he apologized, took the dish back, and said he'd find out. 5 minutes later he brought back the side of salmon. he didn't say anything else, and the portion was one slice of smoked salmon (nicely 
presented, kind of wrapped around itself), and if i had to guess, it was about 1.5 oz. i guess they threw out the rest of the dish or an employee ate it. 

i started to look around and saw a few dirty tables, two guests who had been done for awhile with dirty plates in front of them, and A LOT of employees (maybe 12 guests seated total). i then watched some employees gathered at the expo line enjoying themselves, and one appeared to be a manager since he was dressed in regular clothes and was standing there the entire time. 

like i said, everything was good, and overall the place was fine. but for those prices (and the expectations of significant gratuity)... is this the standard for what we think is great? i've been in hospitality for 20 years as a server and a manager, either working for gratuity or supporting my servers to get as much gratuity as possible. this newly opened restaurant, its employees, and (i am assuming) it's manager, had maybe 3 or 4 opportunities to make this better and they chose to not take advantage of any of them, which will probably make it harder to swallow paying $19 and (a somewhat forced) tip of 15% for a capp, avo toast, and 1.5 oz of smoked salmon. and everyone else thought it was 5 stars. ?",BRMeJFzX8AyHbNkiB04fbQ,3,1,3,WLTDLBjTNiKBCFSBlCbjOQ

The process is pretty much like a cafeteria, you order, get your own utensils/sauces, find your own seat and place your name on the table so they know where to bring your food.

We ordered the avo toast, french toast, lavender latte and the white mocha. Even though it was Saturday brunch, it wasn't hard to find seats at all. We sat down and got our food pretty quickly. Everything was soooo delicious! I especially loved the lavender latte. I've tried many lavender latte and I've got to say this one was comparable to the one I had in NYC! The avo toast was great as well with a poached egg on top! The french toast was tasty, especially with the added granola!  

I cannot wait to come back to try more! Really looking forward to try their other lattes.

I was very impressed with our selections.  We ordered a breakfast sandwich with my choice of sourdough bread.  Now I don't know where their sourdough comes from, but being that I am from the Bay Area i am a bit picky with sourdough, and this was some of the best sourdough bread I have had, imagine that.  The sandwich consisted of more like an omelette than a scramble like it states in the description and included sausage, bacon, greyer cheese, and arugula. Pretty sure you could request your eggs to be made to your liking, but it was perfect for me! I also selected the potatoes which were incredibly delicious, some the best I have had!!! I also had a bite of my husbands steak and eggs and that was also incredible!  

When ordering at the counter take a look at their display case immediately to the left full of delicious sweetness.  We tried their Snickerdoodle, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chip cookies warmed up which went well with our tasty Lavender Lattes... so delicious.  

Service was great and everyone looked happy to be here!  I can't wait to come back and try some of their other offerings.  Kudos to the kitchen and to all staff! Very impressed!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,4,4,5,-BIOVCyYFdQwhhkQkjvR8w

I'm not a morning person, but I woke up an extra hour before work and drove across town to have breakfast here two mornings in a row. Clearly they're doing something right.

Love the decor, IG aesthetic hashtag in full effect with open space and lots of plants, along with ample natural lighting for great photos. Their menu is thoughtful, with breakfast and lunch choices from healthy to indulgent, as well as a range of specialty coffee, tea, and juice beverages. 

EATS: If you're in the mood for a hot breakfast or a an early lunch, try the shakshuka. I'm a huge fan of this dish and there aren't many places to get it in town. For lighter fare, try the Pacific salmon toast with a side salad. They also have a small selection of baked goods to the left of the register. Will probably try a breakfast sandwich next time!

DRINKS: Lattes, cold brews, and drip coffees galore. The Queen Bee latte has so far been my favorite, though the iced matcha is a close second. They also offer lavender, almond, hazelnut, etc. Check in for specials like their Love Potion (dark chocolate and strawberry latte) that was available for Valentines Day.

They bring your food to you, but everything else though is self-service: you get your own water , utensils , napkins , condiments , etc.
I ordered their ""shakshuka"" for brunch. Their shakshuka has two poached eggs in tomato sauce along w/ red peppers , feta cheese and choice of dipping bread. I chose their multi-grain bread option. Sounds very simple meal , I was thinking it would just taste like tomatoes out of the can but I listened to reviews/recommendations and this dish is actually very flavorful.
We also ordered the ""mushroom burger"" - sadly , the bun was on the colder side and the patty that we ordered medium rare made the bottom bun VERY soggy. Recommend getting the patty well done here - having mushrooms , arugula , crispy onions & herb aioli in the burger made it taste better but for the price it could've been a better burger. Sweet potato fries were delicious though.
Atmosphere is too loud for studying or getting some work done. More of a social place. Also they don't serve alcohol here but mimosas would be a nice touch.",qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q,1,1,4,oOe9UeDv5pQqtVfgL6YXig

When we got inside, this tall blonde girl gave us four menus and told us to sit wherever. After about ten minutes, we realized we're supposed to go up to the cashier to order and pay. I wish the girl had told us instead of us waiting and awkwardly staring at her. She didn't come to our table to ask us if this was our first time, what's popular, nothing. After we ordered, we waited for our food and it was pretty quick. The food was really good and the presentation of it was really pretty. We got steak&eggs, BLAT, and coconut pancakes. Pretty good I must say. Right when we got our food, the blonde girl asked if we needed anything and that was it. She never came to us again until the end to get our dirty plates. Towards the end of the meal, my mom asked her if we can get refills on our drinks while she was taking the plates away. She said yeah and walked away. Yeah and then she never came back. So my mom was trying to get her attention and even yelled excuse me once (embarrassing lol) and she didn't look at us at all. Even when she went to the area where she grabs the food to give to customers, her back was to us the entire time. Kind of felt like she was doing it on purpose. So I felt like she ruined the whole experience for us. In the future, I feel like this is a to go type place bc the food was so good tho!

I feel like it would have been a lot easier if the waiter took our food order. I placed the order at the counter then the person behind the counter asked if the sandwich my boyfriend was ordering wanted it on sourdough white or while grain. So I had to go back to the table we were sitting at and ask him his preference. I get back to the counter and then she ask what he wants for his side on the same order. I wish she had asked me all the options before going back to the table for a second time. I finally just got him to come to the counter. You have to get your own water which is annoying especially when I'm having to leave a tip for the waiter whose only job is to bring you your food and bus your table. I'm knocking off a star for the major inconvenience of the set up. Food was quite tasty and at a good price for what you got. All and all I'll probably come back but would rather the server take my food order in the future and fill my water  


Came back for a second time and it sounds like this place is transitioning to a better setup. I'll be real happy when that finally goes into affect.

When I visited, it was on a super busy Sunday afternoon. As some reviews have mentioned, you walk up to the counter to order first then find your own table, much like how Panera does it. I wish they would change this because it does get quite chaotic when it's busy like how it was when I visited. There were a bunch of people standing around eyeing for the next open table, and it was confusing as to where the order line started. 

Onto the food!

Matcha latte: Omg. I'm in love with this latte. I want to marry it...that's how good it is to me. I'm super picky when it comes to matcha and this place definitely got it just right. It had a nice hint of sweetness and a strong green tea flavor. You just have to try it especially if you love matcha!

Shashuka: this is a dish of 2 eggs poached in a sauce of tomatoes, red peppers, and onions. Feta cheese is also sprinkled throughout. Comes with slices of your choice of bread for dipping (I got sourdough). I pretty much ate the whole thing because it was just that good! The flavors of all the ingredients were wonderful and the red peppers gave it a nice little kick.

2013517,2018-04-02,1,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"I've struggled with this review for a while now since my visit. 

I'm stuck between 3 and 4 stars because, while the food was great - exceptional, even, for cafe food - the overall experience was frustrating enough to deem it disappointing. 

To the venue's credit, the space is beautiful. The interior is bright, crisp, and clean with ample seating. It's insta-perfect. 

However, the space is so open that, when crowded as it was when I visited, it becomes unbearably loud. I'm talking crowded bar loud. I'm talking so loud that that my voice was hoarse by the time I got home from straining to make conversation over eggs. 

Furthermore, they are not the least bit equipped to handle peak hours. When not busy, approaching the counter for a menu and to place an order, self-seating, and grabbing your own utensils is a non-issue. However, when I walked in, I felt like I was thrust into the Hunger Games. I wasn't sure if I should camp out for a table, elbow my way to the front of the line for a menu, or hang my head in hands and stand by the restroom where the end of the line had formed. 

After a few breaths, my family and I settled at a table. I then managed my way to the front of the line to snag a menu. This happened to the chagrin of the person who was in the middle of ordering and had completely blocked access to all of the menus available. Menu in hand, I scuttled back to the base we formed at our table and tried to piece together everyone's selections. Ready to order, I made my way to the end of the line, which was still next to the restroom. I know I stood in line for at least ten minutes before getting halfway to the register. I then watched as several guests in front of me struggled to order from a menu they had just set their eyes on. Add to this the fact that there was only one cashier who was also struggling to keep the self-serve water dispenser filled, and, well... 

What makes all of this so frustrating for me is that I can't write this off completely because the food was great. My in-laws ordered the Old School. There really isn't a lot to expect from bacon or sausage, eggs, and potatoes, but I've never see plates of classic breakfast as well-prepared as the ones served that day. I had the shashuka and gobbled it up. Perfect yolk. Great flavor. Feeling like I needed to order more food than I wanted to make up for the wait, I also chose the coconut pancakes. Damn. Also, good. The pastry case was lovely. We picked a coconut chocolate chip muffin from the bunch. While it could have used more coconut flavor and less chocolate, it received high marks from the table.  

It's such a shame that the visit was so frustrating. The combination of the lack of service (someone helping to seat or direct guests to the flow of the room would have helped a great deal), the stress from other guests, and the noise made the experience feel as far as possible from neighborly. 

Maybe it's a me thing? Maybe I need to just avoid peak hours? Maybe it'll be better next time now that I know what to expect?",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,6,2,3,u1sBWKHfhDVTA7X0y7_9qA

The decor is pleasantly comfortable with hanging air plants greeting you at the front door to the front desk where you place your order.

I gotta admit, at first I was a little dumb struck and confused if I had to wait to be seated, seat myself, order, or just stand around the entrance like an awkward deer in headlights. Lucky for me I always choose the latter.
The hostess was nice enough to call me over though to the front and explain how their system works and handed me a menu.

I ordered the shroom burger with regular shoe string fries and my friend ordered the steak and eggs (medium rare, with eggs done over easy).
The steak comes with a chimichurri sauce on top that has a slight sourness to it. The steak was very tender and juicy, while the side of potatoes have a good crisp and soft Center to them.

The shoe string fries I got were nice and crispy, but a little cold unfortunately. I'm guessing they were probably cooked first and were sitting on my plate before the burger was cooked. The shroom burger was really soft and juicy and the fried onions on it had a pleasant crisp to change up the texture of the soft patty and mushrooms.

I wasn't really into the buns though, they were kind of cold and doughy. I would have really like it more if they had cooked it or something, because it just kept reminding me of bread buns you would leave in your fridge and they would get slightly soggy from the condensation and temperature of the surrounding food.

With that exception though, the food tasted good and guilt free.. almost

When I brought it to the staff's attention, the employee's response was, ""What do you want me to do? You want a quinoa bowl?"" No, I just wanted Caesar dressing. 

Today when I went with my toddler, no one assisted me in carrying a high chair from the back of the restaurant to my table. (I am obviously pregnant, too.) The staff gathers at the counter with their backs to the customers. Customer service leaves something to be desired!

When you enter you are greeted and handed a menu to begin looking over. The line wraps right next to some delicious looking desserts and cookies. Once you order they give you a little metal tag to put on your table with your name. Very personable touch. 

The wife chose the Shakshuka which is served in a skillet and comes with farm fresh eggs, sunny side up so you can break the yolk, tomato, bell peppers, feta cheese and fresno chilies. On the side of the plate you get 4 pieces of thinly sliced toast. Delicious meal and fun to scoop onto the bread with every bite. I decided on the Breakfast burrito this trip but almost went with the Old School breakfast. Both sounded good. The burrito was stuffed with sausage, smashed potatoes,a blend of cheeses and avocado crema. I had some sriracha mayo on the side which accompanied the burrito well and onions and diced tomatoes were sprinkled atop the plate. Definitely a 5/5 burrito. They give a 10% military discount and water is located next to the register; we made a couple trips to refill. I also ordered a sprite thinking it was a fountain drink but was delivered a can and glass with ice after inquiry a few times with the server. Next time just water or try to lemonade.

We ordered avo toast and shakshouka, sweet potato fries and fruit bowl for my little one. The side salad that came with the avo toast was nicely dressed! Very flavorful. The supposedly star of the dish (avo toast) wasn't everything. I've had better. The shakshouka was delicious! But I've had better. Wish it came with a few more slices of toast. The sweet potato fries was everything though. My son loved it! I'm definitely willing to come back to try other things on the menu like their drinks perhaps?

You start at the counter to order then take your seat, the food is brought to you. 
They have a water station with a lemon, lime and strawberry water or just cold water, self serve. 
They had a bogo coffee special, so we bought an iced white mocha with almond milk and an iced queen bee with almond milk. It was smooth, not bitter and so yummy! 
We also bought the breakfast sandwich with potatoes (which are so soft and crispy!) and a breakfast burrito sub the sausage for bacon. The food was absolutely amazing and the sauce  oh gosh.

My bf ordered the coconut pancakes, OMG let me tell you I've never been a big fan on pancakes but this was amazing. The zest of lemon, the sweetness of the coconut, and the tartness of the berry syrup. It's like a vacation in your mouth. I'm just blown away on how it tasted so good. I highly recommend it! They had a variety of teas and lattes to choose from. I also saw they had some fresh juices to choose from as well. I ordered the Queen B latte which was the perfect taste of honey and cinnamon.

The Chai Latte was weak and  only warm not hot. The pour your own refill was great, food came fast and staff was friendly.

3229757,2018-03-02,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"Stopped in for a quick lunch and I was kinda let down.

The ambience of the place is quite nice. Open floor plan and relaxing colors abound. 

The menu looked to have a number of interesting dishes but I went with the Pina burger and a iced been tea. For those two things it nearly set me back $20 yikes! I would not have guessed that judging by the location and the actual portion size of the food. 

The burger was not bad, the pineapple and charred burger patty was tasty, I just wish it was bigger for the cost. The sweet potatoes fries didn't have any seasoning that was detectable. 

The biggest let down though was that all of the waiters was standing at the counter with there backs to the dinning area 95% of my meal. 

I needed napkins bc the egg told had got in my beard lol... after waiting for a few minutes I noticed these gilts never gave the customers and I just walked up to them to ask for them.

Next when my ice tea went empty not one person ever came by my table the entire meal. If your going to charge $3.5 for a simple glass of ice tea. Please refill it. 
 
Interestingly this place solicites tips before you get your food. I hate this as most of the time the service is really lacking because they think, hey I already got mine!!! Funny thing on the screen the options was 10% 20% 30%.

Well I did want to try the pancakes but I doubt that will happen. If your in a burger mood Bachi nails the menu better. And if you want a coffee well maybe this place is for you.",D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew,1,0,2,W7aSHQ22eU4cJPwkRZZ_Uw

The decor is minimal, there is a beautiful back wall with shelves. The shelves are decorated with trinkets and (you guessed it) more plants!

You order at the counter and take a seat wherever. The menu is fresh and exciting. I love that you can go on the healthy side with an acai bowl, avocado toast, or spruced up parfait. Or you can go the savory and not quite so waistline friendly route with sandwiches and decadent dishes. Even the non healthy selections are made with quality ingredients.

I ended up ordering the queen bee latte (cinnamon and honey) and it was fantastic. A little on the sweet side, but after a hike I very much welcomed the sugar. I ordered the avocado toast and sweet potato fries. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich.

My  avocado toast had a poached egg on it along with some red and yellow cherry tomatoes. The only thing I thought it was missing was red pepper flakes (but I put red pepper on anything). My husbands breakfast sandwich tasted amazing. There was bacon AND sausage, plus their sourdough is a delight. 

All of the servers were very nice, especially considering that it was Easter morning and I'm sure that they would have rather been home or with family. They made me feel completely welcome.

The restaurant itself is really cute with wood tables and plants at the entrance as well as a wall of plants and succulents which are my fav! The reason for the 4 stars is the lack of variety in the food for all people weather you eat meat or not as well as healthier options and a tiny bit over priced.

3352499,2018-03-31,2,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"Went for a breakfast here on a Sunday morning. Got there around 9 AM to avoid the long line (the place started to get super busy at around 10.30ish) and got ourselves a corner table by the pretty wall with all the planters. 

I wouldn't sit there again the next time I visit though. As the line started to form, and it continued non-stop, it wrapped around the aisle where our table was at. It was uncomfortable sitting there having our meals, while being constantly surrounded by people's sides/butts lol I felt like I was in Hong Kong during a busy meal time, where you have people waiting for your table literally at your side. 

I love the beautiful decor (airy, bright, and green from all the planters; very LA), but I think the place is not set up well for the long line it's having. 

The food was good. I had the steak with scrambled eggs and smashed potatoes. The steak was prepared medium rare like I asked. Not the best cut of rib eye, but what do you expect for $16. Love the chimichurri sauce, limey, zesty, and fresh, and how it coated the crisped smashed potatoes. The scrambled eggs was kinda blah. My friend had their pacific smoked salmon and gave it a thumb's up. We also tried their vegan peanut butter cookie and lemon scone. The cookie was delicious, but the scone was a bit dry.

For drinks, I had their Americano and my friend had their matcha latte. No complaints about our drinks. Our total bill for all these food was around $45, so yeah, not the cheapest breakfast. Can't say much about the service as this place is mostly a self service place. Plenty of parking as it's in an office strip mall, so it's the only place that's open on the weekend. Overall, I'd recommend to check this place out, even if it's just to get some coffee, admire the decor, and maybe take some insta-worthy pics lol.",A5RC8s-n2FEbAR5GRUNHDA,2,1,3,u4AcSKdvkZej_C81wCJzOw

Very flavorful & the FRIES were thin & crispy just how I like it! Perfect place for caffeine lovers.

It was filled with sausage, egg, cheese, bacon, potato, avocado creme and spicy mayo. MY GOSH DID I WANT TO TAKE A FEW HOME. This was probably the best breakfast burrito I had ever eaten and I swear I'll probably never get one from Roberto's or Egg and I again... it'll never compare to this one.

The girlfriend got a mushroom burger, which i had a bite of, and it was very tasty also. We had also ordered iced coffee that just didn't taste quite right and I'm not a big fan of no refills for any drinks other than water. The staff is very friendly and attentive as well.  

I will say as a side note that because of the acoustics in the building a large party can easily encompass the whole room and it could get annoying to try and converse as it became a battle of who could talk louder.

Neighbors is a casual brunch/ lunch place with a very modern and chill vibe. You order your food at the front and seat yourself which would be my prime complaint- I definitely don't think this would be an effective practice especially if it's super busy, people may be discouraged at the fact that there are no tables nor specific waiting area. 

We ordered the avocado toast and the old school. The avocado toast was very light and refreshing but definitely not filling as it only comes with one slice and a small side salad. The old school was your typical breakfast plate with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and your choice of toast. Overall, both were good- nothing exceptionally notable, but still good.   

We ordered 2 coffees- an iced caramel latte and a regular drip. The regular coffee was very acidic and hard to drink even with an excess amount of half and half. The iced latte didn't have much of a coffee taste- I'd compare it to milk. 

Overall, I'd return. The menu had a number of items that sounded delicious, the dining area was very aesthetic, food was good, and the service was great.",xFIJOdPk3SQWUm4wadPnUg,1,2,4,d2lLr3bMHo2DdVCZL3CFXw

To save you the hassle, follow these important helpful tips:

1)As you enter, head towards the wall of plants
towards the ""ORDER HERE"" sign where the cashier is, take a look at the menu, place your order, then pay for your order...simple, right???

2)While paying, you'll have an option to leave a tip(10-20%) AS WELL AS A NO TIP OPTION...In no way are you being pressured to leave a tip up front like some reviews state. You can also leave a tip on the table after your experience instead. Duh???

3)BEFORE YOU FIND A TABLE TO SIT AT, and depending on what you ordered, grab your personalized nameplate, silverware, napkins, water, and condiments, etc.
*Yes, it's a self-service concept, and  if this is too much for you after reading these three steps, because you feel it's the waiter's responsibility, go elsewhere...

While waiting for our order, I observe the kitchen and front of the house hustling to get the orders out, and something you almost always don't see is the floor manager bussing tables, and the Executive Chef Tom running food to tables. Great to see a team effort such as this where everyone works together towards the same goal to provide a great experience.

Our order arrives 15-20 minutes later: two Lavender Lattes, Breakfast Sandwich, Ribeye Steak and Eggs with Chimichurri, and some warm chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and peanut butter cookies. Wifey enjoyed her sandwich and my steak and eggs were perfectly medium rare as I requested. We finished our meal with our cookies and lattes.
Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Waitstaff bussed tables and refilled waters accordingly, and honestly,  the quality of the food served to the price point is very reasonable.

Other reviews complain about staff hanging out at the counter and not tending to customers. They were referring to the floor manager and executive chef(who I mentioned earlier)oh, and the waiter ""doing nothing but facing his back to you the whole time"" is actually THE EXPIDITER, whose responsibility is to STAY THERE, communicate with the kitchen, and control the flow of the tickets, so that each order comes up in a timely manner.

Great first visit after only being open for four weeks, stellar service, and already looking forward to coming back soon. Another tidbit...
By looking at most of the 1 to 3 starred reviews, they should tell you a few things and raise a few red flags...

1)These people are probably regulars at Mickey D's drive thru and comfortable with the  dollar menu complaining about wait times and prices, SMH....

2)These are picky people that are very set in their ways, not open to change and new, different concepts, and have NO CLUE on how a restaurant operation works...

3)NEVER trust reviews, especially those with single digits(and no real pictures). Yelp Elite reviewers are much more accurate. Let those reviews help you decide if you want to plan to dine here...

RECOMMENDATIONS:

-Ribeye Steak and Eggs with Chimichurri Sauce and Smashed New Potatoes

-Get the Sourdough bread to wipe up all that chimichurri goodness

-Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies (get 'em warmed up!)

-Lavender Latte (great with the cookies!)

Downsides- almost no vegan options if you can't tolerate avocado/banana like me. The cashier made a very poor suggestion of the Shakushka minus the eggs, cheese and bread.. which leaves basically just tomato sauce and garnish. Tasty tomato sauce, but not much else. I went back up and ordered potato's to bulk it up, but it ended up being just rather pricy sauce. My partner's mushroom burger was tasty but on the soggy side. 

If you are omni or just vegetarian, you'll definitely enjoy this place. If I go back I'll stick to coffee and a side of fruit, thanks.",8utnkSN-xcA-UjkPkCGPSA,1,0,4,xgppyepkE7Nhl06S2v0Kxg

This place is literally my new absolute favorite brunch spot in Vegas. I first fell in love with PublicUs in downtown Las Vegas, but since it was way too far from where I live in town I needed to find a new spot and I'm so glad my gf took me here one weekend. The inside is really open and sunny and great for a small gathering or a date. The vibe of this place is earthy retro with a very endearing hipster quality to it. The servers are all super nice and so helpful. 

Now to the food. OMG their breakfast sandwich is absolute heaven in my mouth. I crave it more often than not now. It's a very hearty and flavorful breakfast sandwich that just hits the spot. I like to get it with their sourdough bread. Their fries are super delicious, crispy, and thin just the way I like them. I have also tried their Hawaiian burger and it was really tasty as well. I also love their sweet beets salad with extra beets.Their cookies are very spot on as well. 

I tried their breakfast burrito today and well I wasn't blown away. Only in one small corner of the burrito was a small portion of avocado crema and cheese was randomly scattered in large chunks. There were no evenly dispersed ingredients. I would like for them to add much more avocado crema and correct the uneven parts. I also wasn't a huge fan of the huge smashed potatoes that took up most of the burrito.  

I'm also in love with lavender anything, so I'm also obsessed with their lavender latte. I'm sure all their drinks are equally delicious.",WU9eoIz9KCcSB4bAxhOHXQ,2,1,5,m0tutBmynPVkvumsdhO_rA

It was so good, I went back and got a second cup in the same sitting.  I've never done that at a Cafe, ever!  The Mushroom burger was very good, especially with the Sweet Potato fries.  Everything was very good!

The atmosphere was energetic and lively.  The room was well lit and open, making the space feel huge.  It wasn't too noisy, but loud enough to know no one could really eavesdrop on your conversation, sort of the way that happens at parties.  The decor is gorgeous and almost ripped exactly from my Minimalist Pinterest Board.

It located on Oquendo and Forte Apache in a small lot that can be quite easy to miss. There is tons of parking, however I noticed when I went on a Sunday it got pretty crowded and cars were parking in the dirt lot next door. 

Menu is not big but quality is always better than quantity. So far I have tried their Shakshuka, Salmon Toast, Coconut Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito and a little bit of my friends Steak and Eggs. I have also tried their Queen Bee Latte, Lavender Latte, Chai Latte and Matcha Latte. 

Shakshuka with sourdough bread has been my favorite. So good that I went there two days in a row and ordered just that lol. I feel like there just isn't enough bread to eat it with though :( also there is no meat included but my bf ordered sausage on the side and it was even better with the meat. 

Coconut pancakes would be my second favorite. The lemony syrup they use just absorbs into pancake nicely and the berries and toasted coconut go great together. And I'm not even a fan of dried coconuts. 

Breakfast burrito was delicious and Salmon toast was just ok. It was pretty much a Nova Lox bagel replaced with a slice of sourdough. 

Now the lattes. I would rate it as Lavender, Queen Bee, Chai then Matcha. Lavender had the most flavor and was the best tasting IMO. Queen Bee was also really good. It was a slight taste of honey and a lot of cinnamon. Chai latte wasn't anything special and Matcha lacked in flavor. 

Service was good all the times I've went. Nothing bad to say there.

You walk in and find a lovely light space with lots of plants. It's very clean and open. Walking up to the counter, the lady behind it was very friendly and helpful, she gave us menus and helped talk us through it when I had some questions, as well as offer me a taster of their in-house lavender syrup as they have a lavender latté that I'd never tried before.
We ordered the breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito and lavender latté and they all arrived in good time and the burrito in particular was a good size. The latté was very good - I could taste the lavender but it wasn't overly sweet. The food was also good. I was disappointed that the burrito arrived with about 4 pieces of diced tomato as 'pico de gallo' and nothing in the burrito itself, but the lady (manager, I assume) who was maintaining the floor offered amazing service and brought some more over with some cutlery and a takeaway box for us straight away.
The only things that led to my 4 star review rather than 5 was that it is a little pricey. For 2 brunches and 1 drink it was nearly $35 and for a casual café, this seems a little steep. Also, the open space is lovely, but with a lot of people enjoying lunch, it can get very noisy and difficult to hear yourself think.

Their menu is kept simple with a few healthy options, griddle toasts and traditional breakfast fare. I was a particular fan of the chicken and waffles and enjoyed the cornflake crusted tenders with the sweet chili maple drizzle. The savory chive waffles were a bit disappointing with how soggy the waffles got, and how I didn't particularly taste the chive element. But, I was very pleasantly surprised by the breakfast diversity with the shakshouka, a traditionally Middle Eastern and North African dish. 

For sweets, I loved the coconut pancakes (mostly because I'm a fan of coconuts). The stacks were fluffy and there was a generous amount of blueberries, lemon syrup, and honey whipped butter. As for their specialty coffees, their lattes are more on the sweeter side, but the lavender did taste good.

The place is well lit with lots of green plants spread around. A little art on the walls could really make it pop, but let's get right to the food.. Menu looked very unique, a mix of classic breakfast items with a few twists.. we ordered the chicken and waffles, breakfast burrito, breakfast sandwich on sourdough, and the French toast. Arriving at the table all portions were large in size and tabled to considerably please the eye.

French toast was out of this world. I'm not even a sweet breakfast food person and it blew my mind. I loved the subtle crunch of the added oats.

Breakfast sandwich and burrito were phenomenally executed.  The burrito was packed with hearty meat, potatoes, and a spicy mayo alongside, while the greens on the sandwich gave a very healthy crisp I wasn't expecting from a breakfast sandwich. 

The chicken and waffles could have used a little work, as the waffles didn't really shine, but the breading on the chicken was amazing! I'd suggest a 
chicken portion(s) with more meat? It came with two wing portions which made it feel a little weak. 

Overall we loved it!!!! Friendly staff, bright open atmosphere, clean look, AND less than a block from my house?!?!

-BIG windows = natural light
-So when you come in, you order/pay & then sit down. They serve you your food HOWEVER they ask for your NAME instead of giving you a random number. It's admirable that little things like that make people feel special!! :)  

FOOD 5/5:
-Pacific Smoked Salmon ($11): They had a good portion of salmon on this. And the salad that came with it complimented the fish.
-Wild Berry Parfait ($7): Although this is kinda pricey for a parfait, there was a lot of fruit + the yogurt was thick & delicious! 
-The Fun Guy ($12): THIS IS A MUST-GET BURGER. I'm not a vegetarian but i LOVE this burger. It has a fried parmesan eggplant with peppers & grilled portabella (mushrooms) + it comes with CHOICE of fries, sweet potato fries or greens

Yet for picky eaters or vegans, those who have high service standards and concerned about pricing to satisfaction, you won't be impressed.  Lately many of these places have done this, setting, and presentation is best, and service is subpar and food is average and overpriced.  Depending on what you value most or what your preferences are, Neighbors will fancy you differently.

The music, the ambiance, real plants, open space, large windows for sunlight, the fancy and small centerpiece plants, plates and silverware, the cool chalk board name plates for your orders are all pretty welcoming and neat.  I really enjoy a sunny and home feel to restaurants.  Especially these new and niche places that seem like home.  The funny thing is lots of the younger crowds don't have nice homes, or cook, or anything, so that's why nowadays a lot of these business just look and cook meals that represent something your family cooks.  The food comes out pretty and nice.  For younger people in the teenager to late 30s, you won't be bothered and will be satisfied with every aspect of this business.  Anyone who cooks or shops often or has a high standard of service, you'll constantly be asking yourself, or the staff questions here and there about, ""where's my order again?"" or, ""I didn't ask for that.  Can ya remake it?""  
 I personally dislike wasting food for them to throw it away cuz of a mistake.  Yet it happened a few times in one visit and other visits.  Its cool cuz they compensate the wait or the honest mistake with more food.  

For those who seek vegetarian options, this place is very friendly.  They still have steak and eggs for the others.  For vegans there are few, very few options.  Whenever you ask to make em that way they say they can't.  You watch them make it from scratch and wonder why they can't.  Sometimes when they do, they'll still botch or forget.

I don't wanna ramble on but the verdict is, I had mixed feelings on my visits here.  If you're here to chat to a friend it's perfect.  Semi health concerns, wanna eat steak and eggs but wanna make it kinda healthy?  Sure, it's great.  Vegetarians that want to have a quick meal?  Yeah it's dope.  Vegans, people who want the best in the food and the price and service, will be whatever about it.  You'd go here if someone wants to, but you, yourself, will never recommend or decide to come here on your own.

My coconut pancakes were really good but at one point the compote got to be too sweet so I just ate the pancakes and the coconut flakes and some sort of cream on top.

First off, there is literally two gluten free vegan options on the menu, so I was forced to choose between the two. An açaí bowl without the granola as it wasn't gluten free. You're really losing out on business with such a limited menu for people that eat vegan or gluten free. Even if you're just vegan you have about two options. For such a new place I was surprised of the lack of choices. Either way the açaí bowl was just ok, already a bit melted when it got to me. The service wasn't great either. The cashier was super friendly but the guy that brought us the food barely said two words and didn't offer silverware or napkins. When we went to grab some, there were no napkins or silverware left. I just think that when it's busy they may get a little bit distracted. It's also super loud in here if there are a lot of people due to the hard floors, I literally could barely hear my mom over the screaming kids.

Don't get me wrong, the inside is absolutely exquisite and airy- totally feels like you're in California. 5 out of 5 stars for atmosphere. As for the pastries and coffee.... the barista recommended I try the vegan peanut butter oat muffin and I don't think I've ever made a worse choice. This was literally the driest muffin I've ever had- i dont know if it was stale or what, but it was disgusting. I know vegan stuff is sometimes more dense and dry but this was not your normal vegan pastry. It was just a dry piece of bread basically. It had no flavor whatsoever and made my mouth extremely dry trying to chew it. My boyfriends coffee cake was also dry. Maybe it was just a bad batch of pastries that morning? 
I ordered the honey bee latte - it was mediocre. He ordered the americano with vanilla. Not sure what happened with that either, we got the drink and the espresso and syrup was not mixed whatsoever. The bottom of the cup was an inch of clear syrup and when drinks are not mixed before being served, that's nasty.

They were all super excited about the opening of the restaurant and being able to serve the community a healthier food option! No matter what you order you'll get a deal. 

I had the breakfast sandwich which was absolutely amazing. The presentation just added to the experience. It was by far the best sandwich of any kind I have had in months. I'm not big on spice, but this sandwich had a little kick to it which put it over the top. Not too strong, just enough to throw your taste buds for a loop. I chose a side salad with it (yea I know it was breakfast but I'm trying to be good!) the salad was super fresh and had a unique spin on it. The dressing was fantastic!! Wish I had the recipe but I guess that means I'll have to come back in for more!!

Overall the experience was fantastic and I will be going back! My advice to the employees and managers is to keep it up and keep it about the food experience. Don't get caught up in the penny pinching as your food is too good to cut corners with ingredients and effort. Quality over quantity will win every time.

I'm not a fan of burritos and it's definitely not my first choice, but the breakfast burrito sounded good and the pictures on their Yelp page made it look good. Ended up trying it and loved it! I put some Tapatio sauce on the burrito, which made it even better. It's a huge burrito and I had to take the other half home. I also tried their iced matcha latte. This is probably my new favorite matcha latte that I've had. I've been to places where I could barely taste the matcha green tea and it would be just mostly milk, but it was a good balance of matcha to milk.

Services: 3/5
Environment:2/5 

It's so great to have many brunch options now in the southwest area. However, this one is not my favorite unfortunately. I heard some great things about this place among friends and yelp but I'm sorry to report it did not meet my expectations. Due to the fact that I was so underwhelmed of their coffee, this place is 2 Stars for me till next time. 

Service: it's alright basically non-existent. No one to greet you and let you know how the system works till you ask. You can't get a table till you order at the counter, so I would not recommend to come with a big group. 

The guy at the counter not only couldn't spell but also couldn't take the order right. My friend ordered the B.L.A.T.C and the guy put breakfast sandwich instead. Also, they are now charging $.50 on sweet potato fries according to the updated menu. However, they charged her $1 instead. I mean, it's fine if you wanna charge for fries but make up your mind how much you want to charge your customers. 

Environment: Way too loud in here. I could not hear anything my friend said who sat next to me. Don't expect you can hear what the other end of table is talking if you come with more than group of four. 

Food: overall, it's a meh place for me in the food aspect as well. I was highly disappointed in the lavender latte since it's their signature. From there, it just went downhill. 

1. Shakauka (2/5): a new brunch favorite in many trendy breakfast places. It's a middle eastern vegetarian dish. Both of my friend and I ordered this and it came out so differently. Mine was really watery saucey skillet, and hers was more dense and lack of flavor. It was like eating tomato sauce out of the can. I also wish there's more herbs in this dish either more cilantro, basil, or parsley. 

2. B.L.A.T.C (3/5): the chicken in the sandwich was good. However, there was too much sauce that made the sandwich soggy. The sweet potato fries was good though. 

3. Old school (4/5): this was probably my favorite dish out of everything we tried today. The sausages and potatoes were both good. I would get this next time. 

I would probably try this place again till they work out some kinks and get their consistency down. For now, I will go elsewhere for Sunday brunch.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,5,4,2,SZ3SXlM1JO5Ec4RN2ri--g

The French Toast presentation was definitely five star worthy, however the taste was underwhelming. The syrup was minimal and the overall taste was just okay at best.

Shakshuka was a pleasant surprise to the menu. Saucy, a little spicy, seasoned with cumin served in a skillet full of messy deliciousness for the win!

The space is gorgeous! Open floor plan, cute wooden tables and the decor is very clean. Love the greenery in the room. The big windows for sunlight makes for great pictures.

Food was decent. I ordered the pancakes which were very light, fluffy and flavorful. Definitely didn't need syrup with the house made sauce they put on it. 

My friend's steak and eggs were greatly presented. Never been a fan of precut steak as I love to cut it myself, but their presentation of stacking it like a jenga stack was a breath of fresh air from the nornal sliced at an angle and fanned out on the plate like most places do with precut steak. Chimichurri was good. Their rainbow smashed fingerling potatoes reminded me too much of CRAFTkitchen's smashed breakfast potatoes. However, theirs could not hold a candle to the aforementioned restaurant. The potatoes lacked the crunchiness and creaminess. And the marinade made it look messy, not clean on the plate.

My friend who ordered their breakfast burrito, I am just a person of aesthetics... for the price he paid, I'm sure the cooks could've rolled that burrito tighter and actually put more filling... you can definitely tell there was no care put in to that burrito of how flattened it looked. I've rolled enough burritos and sandwich wraps to know how much filling and care goes in to making one.

All of the food was overshadowed by service. I'm sorry, if you're going to provide a refill service your tea, at least be attentive to your floor. Just as it was pictured in another review, servers still had their backs towards their guests. I understand it's not a full service restaurant, but if I'm going to pay for a $3.75 glass of tea that isn't that big to begin with, people do expect a refill. I'm fine with refilling my water. I do it whenever I am at Crepe Expectations.. but even if you moved to refillable teas as the server made a point to inform me, ""Oh I'm sorry, we just changed from non free refills to free refills,"" then please don't keep your back to your guests and just stand there with your elbow on the counter chatting away with your coworker. 

On another off the subject, I now understand their 15% option on their payment for tips. Here's a tip for those complaining about the service after paying: don't pay the tip on the card of you're hell bent on complaining why the tip option is available (based on another reviewer complaining about it). You can easily put no tip and just leave money on the table. 

I'll still come and check out the rest of the food, because it was great. Just like Pho Saigon 8 in Henderson: you know you're going to get bad service but you suck it up for the good food (however, their service has improved as of late - the server who ignores you doesn't work there anymore haha). I am in the area frequently so yes I will still support because of the good food, but I hope service standards get improved upon.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,1,0,3,YYnimd8SJMOQ4LlldqN1nQ

I liked that they pre sliced my steak. And the sauce they used. And the potatoes. Wow. 
My mom and her friend shared the breakfast sandwich. That thing is huge! And they said it tasted very good. 
My dad got the muesli and he enjoyed it too. 
We are all super happy about our meals and coffee.

I got the breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend got the mushroom burger. I got the side salad with my sandwich and he had the fries. I loved the food!  Both were great but the breakfast sandwich in my opinion was my favorite. It's a huge portion for only 8 bucks!  Thee chipotle mayo on it complemented the egg, sausage and bacon. The salad was light and went perfectly well with the heavier sandwich. 

The mushroom burger was also super juicy and flavorful and the fries were super thin and crispy.. exactly the way I like it. 

Will definitely be back to try more of the menu.  It's currently my favorite brunch spot in Vegas!",CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q,2,1,5,yzJg-uNG0kxOPL9xRcBr9A
5018581,2018-02-18,2,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"I'm generally surprised by the high ratings for this.  It was ok. Fine. Pricey for the level of service - you have to go get your own coffee accouterments (a disaster waiting to happen as people run around in an already tight space with large mugs of hot coffee fighting to get the last bit of creamer right next to the front door), you have to self serve for your condiments including salt and pepper (nice awkward moment having to ask to take them from another table because none are left up front), yet still charging full service restaurant prices.  I had the ""Old School"" - standard eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast.  It's served in a bowl which made it kind of cumbersome to eat, but fine. My boyfriend had the breakfast sandwich - both were good.  Nothing amazing, but good. Coffee was very good. 

A couple of other things - it's insanely warm in this restaurant.  Do not sit by the windows.  Not sure what they will do come summer.  Also, there are these out of place plant fixtures throughout which I suppose are designed to create a break in the dining space, but they are a hazard!  Lawsuit waiting to happen.  

Hope they work through some of these kinks.  I can walk to this place and was excited, but I think the concept needs some work.",K7W2UaUGJvpbqiqObRhQQQ,0,0,3,pO2L1t0zIozWq9MrFuGNOQ

Seriously, probably the best one I've had period. It was slightly sweetened to not over power the matcha flavor and that's what I want when I order one.

I'm a sucker for anything lemon. Seeing that their coconut pancakes had a berry lemon syrup it was a must order for me. This entire dish tasted so fresh, which sounds crazy to say about pancakes, but they were light and fluffy & the berry lemon syrup, packed with blueberries, had me wanting to lick the plate clean.

Officially open as of February and immediately making itself 'known' via Instagram, a giveaway requesting guests ""tag their Brunch Squad"" or some such nonsense drawing onlookers to a collection of Breakfast and Lunch items available from 7am to 3pm daily, it was along with a friend that Saturday around 10:30am found the space packed, one screaming child near the doors dragging the average age down from a population largely comprised of Millennials starring at their Smartphones and Soccer Moms.

Tucked away off Fort Apache and clean in design, potted plants dividing the largely communal seating area from a small foyer where guests are greeted with a menu, Neighbors encourages diners to step up and order from the counter once decisions are made, the prices of presumably housemade Pastries not disclosed save for a small laminated sheet at the register where money is exchanged for a stand featuring the party's name and number.

Busy but not particularly loud, the vibe essentially the same as Panera with inoffensive music overhead, it was shortly after exchanging $25 including tax and tip that a party of two found seats at a long wooden table, a trio of Cookies staff had offered to 'warm up' arriving shortly and merely room temperature with the Snickerdoodle pleasant and buttery inside a crispy rim while both Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip were unremarkable save for a price tag of $2.50 each, just a nickel less than all three would have cost for better quality at Sweet Addiction up the road.

Passing on Coffee, the fact that Neighbors uses Beans locally roasted by Vesta a feather in their cap, it was after perhaps ten minutes with Water self-filled and even utensils not delivered that a $12 plate of French Toast arrived featuring Granola, sliced Strawberries without their tops removed and a round of unmelted ""Honey Whipped Butter,"" the meal's  most memorable moment occurring when a young man nearby ate the whole thing assuming it was ""Fruit,"" the humor likely lost on him both as a result of the shock and subsequently being forced to eat Bread that is poorly permeated and doughy without much Syrup and almost no flavor on its own.

**Featuring 2018 paint-by-the-#gram design and plates that look better than they taste Neighbors seems to be exactly what it sets out to be and nothing more discerning palates need to waste time or calories on, the same quality and better service offered at Panera or Kneaders for less and a far superior Breakfast available at CRAFTkitchen, Served or Kitchen Table in Henderson or even Squeeze-In, Mimosa's Gourmet, Babystacks and Bite just a few minutes away.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,4,2,0oA3sbjUqlfrjQ9yLLrMzA

5349095,2018-06-04,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"I have been meaning to try this place out for a while now so my husband, brother, and I decided to come here for lunch today. 

I personally really liked the style of the establishment. Everything was very modern and clean. It's almost as though you walked into a cafe opened by Ikea. Best of all, it's cafeteria style almost. You order, get a sign with your name on it, pick a table, and get the utensils, water, and sauces yourself. They will deliver the food to your table when it's ready. 

My husband went with their breakfast burrito, my brother got their avocado toast, and I decided to go with their mushroom burger. 

The mushroom burger has arugula, swiss cheese, tomatoes, and pickles in it. The combination of flavors was really tasty. While I think the meat is slightly under seasoned, the sauce makes up for it. They use a balsamic vinegar sauce. But I still think it would be better if it was seasoned more. The pickle do add a nice flavor to it as well. The burger came with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or greens. I went with fries and they were really good. Nice, crispy, and just enough saltiness to it. 

It was actually a ton of food and I had to take a majority of it home. I was quite full afterwards and was about to lapse into a food coma. 

Aside from that, we also ordered a chocolate chip cookie. They gave the option to have it warmed first and you bet that's what the road we went down! But ... unfortunately, I would not recommend anyone to get it. The cookie was dry even when it was warmed. And when it cooled down, it was really hard. 

While I understand that they do have an open kitchen and it isn't a romantic type of establishment, it was really noisy. I could barely hear what my brother was saying and he sat directly across from me. It's a little tough to socialize ... 

Overall, pretty decent. It's great if you want something new, fresh, and different.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,0,0,4,0ju2_10U61EM9ofzlqYoTg

They have a smaller menu but what they have on the menu will blow your taste buds way. I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area to try some delicious food.

The cafe was very open and spacious. The decor was very minimal but was very green because of all the surrounding plants they had in the vicinity. You order at the counter and they'll give you a little stand with your name on it where you're able to pick any table of your choosing. 

I got the breakfast burrito and was amazing. Inside the burrito was lightly smashed potatoes, sausage and eggs and on the side was a chipotle ranch sauce which really enhanced the flavor of the potatoes and sausages very well.

My only complaint is that it can get pretty heavy and that they only sprinkle the pico de gallo on top and on the plate for decoration. If you need something to cut through the heaviness ask for more pico de gallo/salsa.

I had a taste of my friend's french toast and it was amazing. Super soft and pillowy, and  generous on the cinnamon but it's not overwhelmingly sweet.

Besides that, I asked about the kale salad and the vegetarian burger. The server suggested both were good, but vegetarian mushroom burger didn't come with a veggie patty. 

So I went with the kale salad. It was good, but could of added more veggies since the plate to filling ratio wasn't enough.

Visit1:
London fog not to sweet:prefer Starbucks version
Salmon toast:delicious and the side salad was awesome with pumpkin seeds really nice flavor
French toast toppings on side: came out cold too sweet
Shaksuka: was cold kinda heavy on the tomato really thick not saucy like you get in Israel needs salt

Visit2:
Flat white: served like an espresso with a small amount of milk prefer Starbucks blonde flat white
Blueberry muffin: dense and flavorless almost stale tasting the blueberries were good
Salmon toast: delicious just like the first time side salad was missing pumpkin seeds this time
Museli: very very sweet and very mushy 
Side of fruit: poorly prepped strawberries still had the white and top after the leaves were pulled off the cantaloupe and melon were not cut uniformly and were flavorless with rind  raspberries were mushy

Overall I would come back for the salmon toast everyday the rest leaves a bit to be desired. To be fare they they slammed both times and they have a well oiled machine as far as ordering and bringing stuff out.

Love that they bring you your coffee while you wait for your food!

Love having a new quick breakfast place hope they can get the flavors and execution together a little bit more would love to see this place succeed!

Lol It's always fun trying out a cute new brunch place in town, decorated with such a modern type feel with a whole wall of plants, white walls, and bistro bulb lighting to make the eating experience Instagram-worthy. 

What keeps me coming back is the fact that their coffee is from Vesta Coffee Roasters, one of my favorite coffee shops in downtown! I'm obsessed with their white mocha latte and their lavender latte which are definite must tries! 

Their food is delicious and comes in pretty big portions. I typically get ""The Fun Guy"" which is a meatless burger but is just as yummy filled with a grilled portobello mushroom, a fried eggplant Parmesan, arugula and balsamic aioli! The French toast is also a great choice for something more sweet than savory and will leave you feeling stuffed!

I do wish they had more variety of foods; it's pretty much just sandwiches, salads, and burgers so the menu is limited. They also only have one vegan option which is the avocado toast without the egg - a heads up to fellow vegan friends. Prices are somewhat fair due to the size that you're getting but do expect to spend at least $12+ on just one item. 

It's an order at the cashier and seat yourself type place, making it a great choice to have a lunch with friends or a quick coffee pick me up. Service is great and definitely would recommend for your next brunch spot!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,8,3,4,yOMihI4K8vkaGaGjLwtwMQ

Highly recommend! Also there's lots of good vibes from all of the greenery. I loved it here.",7k7rF6voco_FhjRKVEeg2g,0,0,4,9mBZaMKA6m27lqT2gMYpWA

We had to figure out that this is a place where we have to get our own utensils, water, refills, napkins, and whatever we may need with our meal, after the food order is placed at the front counter. The confusing part is that there is usually one or two food servers that seem to only drop off the food and drink at the table without any utensils , then never come back, but are still tipped. Besides the semi-service, this place closes at 3 p.m. It would be nice if this place extended their business hours, at least on the weekend.",1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,0,0,3,pYx0UXhTOFsv8syXtE0MfA

5674457,2018-06-27,0,R_fQGSUQv0L_fRiuua47dw,"Wow, I hate to be a party pooper here, but I was really disappointed in this place.

It was Father's Day and my Hubby and I found ourselves on the other side of town in search of brunch. I opened my trusty Yelp app and came across Neighbors. I saw all of the great reviews and thought it sounded great, so we headed in. 

I dig the idea of this place - fast casual, order at a counter, open seating, etc. The food sounded good too so I was excited. I ordered the steak and eggs, which is and 8oz ribeye with housemade chimichurri, smashed potatoes and eggs. My hubby ordered the breakfast burrito, which he really enjoyed. I ordered an iced chai and he asked for black coffee and then we ordered the frittata for our daughter with an extra side of potatoes. We were given a number and found a seat, but weren't really given any instructions other than where we could find a high chair.

We took a seat and a few minutes later my latte was delivered. We mentioned to the server that we also ordered a black coffee and he pointed to a self serve station near the register (this would've been nice to know).

Our food was delivered and everything looked amazing! That is, until I cut into my steak. It was way undercooked - to the point where I was almost afraid to eat it. My Husband felt horrible and told me to send it back. I probably should have, but I ate what I could and enjoyed the potatoes and eggs and then just gave up. Nobody ever really checked to see if we were satisfied, so I also didn't have the opportunity to say anything and I didn't really want to wait forever for my meal to be remade.

Our breakfast (after adding a tip, which I don't think we should've done) was almost $60, which is more than we would spend at a traditional sit-down place. This just adds to my disappointment, since we had to get our own silverware, fill our own waters and coffee and my meal was not cooked properly. As I mentioned, my husband loved his burrito, but that is not enough for us to return. Although everyone we encountered was friendly, nobody ever checked back to ensure that we were satisfied with our food and that is unfortunate. Maybe I am being way too hard here, but I just didn't have the mind blowing experience so many others have mentioned.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,0,2,W5ZbHtWOYKkWs1PoBYdy0A

My friend and I shared the steak and eggs and lox toast. Everything was fresh and yummy. I loved the dressing on the mixed salad. The lavender latte was superb. Will definitely come back again to try their other items.",SDgrUDEdWNFBlC4ufVk1PQ,0,0,5,MvYtmThcXKncAAFqbUU20g

They close at 3pm. I wish they would stay open later and hopefully they will at some point. I wish more little restaurants in Vegas had the style that this place does!

In the past I have ordered the avocado toast for breakfast. Damn, it is SO GOOD. I got that with a latte and they did a cute design in the foam. 

I shared a B.L.A.T.C (Bacon, Lettuce, Avocado , Tomato, Chicken) with my mom. We also got a side of sweet potato fries. The sandwich was pretty standard but what made it stand out was the pesto aioli that left it with a smooth and nutty flavor. If you have a pesto allergy, get it with the avocado crema (it tastes just as good!)

The sweet potato fries were crispy, salty, and satisfying. I couldn't stop eating them!",lmRCyM2Rx4xNm4wFd_ba1A,1,0,5,pRUZ1ysNKok2sUT-1YLvDQ

I got the Old School and orange juice. Pleasantly enjoyed my orange juice considering I almost finished it all. I don't usually finish my drinks. I got over medium eggs, sourdough bread, and half half bacon & sausage. The bacon was overcooked and hard but everything else was good. The small side of salad with its dressing was considerably delish and we both enjoyed our sourdough bread. 

My friend got the steak and eggs and the steak was nice and moist. 

When you place your order they write your name on the tag. Order didn't take that long for us but it also wasn't jam packed. I only noticed the noise after reading some reviews but that doesn't bother me at all. 

The food looks very appealing when it comes out. It's like they're telling you to take nice pictures for social media. ;) 

Overall, I really enjoyed it and will be back with my sister. I will be trying out the coconut pancakes next time!

Edit:

Breakfast sandwich - super good. 

Coconut pancakes - different than I expected but not too bad. Love the coconut flakes.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,1,1,4,ShTb7jeBCvSOMO6PM84XFw

The match latte is quite nice, slightly sweet but not cloying, balancing well with the slight earthiness of matcha.

The steak and eggs was solid though I wouldn't say it was spectacular (hence four stars and not five). The steak itself was ok, just not particularly memorable. The accompanying eggs and smashes potatoes were nicely done though.

Overall, it is a nice breakfast and lunch spot that I would definitely go back to again.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,1,0,4,Zv0t96HFSAAZ9yW3yH5Jug

All together we spent about $40. The smoked salmon definitely wasn't worth $5. The food was pretty tasty though. The sweet potato fries were just the right amount of crispy and the burger was really unique. The salad was alright though because it was missing some flavor by itself.

I ordered the Chicks and Waffles and a Matcha Latte. The Chicks were perfectly fried, not too fatty, and came with a fluffy waffle and a sweet chili maple syrup. The Matcha wasn't overly sweet and they were able to substitute almond or soy milk instead of regular. Yay!
