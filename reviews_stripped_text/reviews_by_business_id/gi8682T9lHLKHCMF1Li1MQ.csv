200214,2017-04-23,0,gi8682T9lHLKHCMF1Li1MQ,"Krazy Chicken just opened in our neighborhood near Trop and Hualapai. The restaurant, tucked away in a small strip mall next to Rustica Pizza, is clean and modern. The menu is mostly Mediterranean. I ordered the chicken kabob combo to go which came with a fresh salad, hummus, pita bread and rice for just $10. It was delicious. Because each order is freshly prepared, expect to wait about 10 minutes or so. But it's well worth the wait. The friendly Armenian family who owns and operates the restaurant hope to have other locations across the valley in the future. I wish them good luck as this eatery shows a lot of promise. I would definitely recommend it.",3uo4eqWcuGt9nd_LGln8CQ,1,0,5,OmBllCMQUNozCg1kaMk98w

to Krazy Chicken. It had just opened
for business a few days back and I
decided to check it out. In my opinion
their prices are too high for what they
sell. I had their four (4) small chicken
quesadillas for $7.00. They were OK,

at Taco Bell and Del Taco's better.",MPlMQddB2VlkpE7DtxJh9Q,0,1,2,-wQ1keZuxO7BaCHzj8ie3g

Easily one of the best rotisserie chicken I've ever had. It comes with hummus, garlic sauce and pita bread. The hummus is fresh and not too heavy. The star is the garlic sauce though! Not too garlicky but a perfect combination with the chicken and pita bread. I wish I could by a bottle to take home.

The place is very clean and the people who work there are kind and attentive. I really hope this place makes it cause we'll definitely be stopping by every time we're in vegas.",K4mYru8lrfCOIo3_68jaSw,3,1,5,GCN8_uOYRg9kissHMC9vnQ

1420438,2017-05-02,10,gi8682T9lHLKHCMF1Li1MQ,"Krazy Chicken specializes in rotisserie chicken, more similar to Nevada Chicken Cafe than El Pollo Loco, but most comparable to Zankou Chicken. When you first walk in, the aroma of fresh grilled chicken is amazing! They have chicken plates by the quarter and half, with whole family meals, as well as kabobs, salads, and burgers. 

Half rotisserie chicken meal was a huge, beautiful piece of moist chicken plus a big scoop of hummus with pita and a dish of radishes and pickles. While what I had was good, I'm perplexed as to why there wasn't rice included, as the menu seemed to indicate and would actually complete the meal. Bomb garlic sauce, though. 

Grabbed a grilled chicken salad to go. Portion is large and topped with shredded chicken, which was a touch dry. I'd prefer to just get the chicken portion (still on the bone) intact and pull it off the bone myself to ensure it doesn't dry out, staff seemed friendly and might accommodate. Greek dressing was good and produce was fresh.

Location is clean and staff were polite, prices are reasonable with most meals under $10. My only beef with Krazy Chicken is that they serve all orders, whether takeout or dine-in, in styrofoam boxes- it's cheap and awful for the environment. Invest in plastic plates for diners at least, finding an eco-friendly box alternative would just be a bonus!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,21,15,4,fAI5sLN1GLW9rXyHy14l0g

2013497,2017-08-13,0,gi8682T9lHLKHCMF1Li1MQ,"Having hailed from LA, land of the rotisserie chicken and pollo a la brasa, I've always found it strange that there aren't many rotisserie chicken places out here that weren't grocery or big box stores. 

Even with the addition of Pollo Inka (an LA expansion), the selection is still slim. 

That said, I was pleased to find that Krazy Chicken opened near me. I've eaten there three times now; twice dine-in and once for pick-up. As I type this, I am awaiting a delivery order from them. All of my experiences, to date, have been great. When we dined in, the service was attentive and kind; my one complaint was the use of disposable dishware and cutlery. We we ordered pick-up, the food was ready on time; hot and fresh. 

The family meal is a great value - 1 whole chicken, 1 large (we're talking served in the same sized box as the chicken and filled completely), hummus, garlic sauce, and a whole bag of pita bread. Plus points for the extra steps taken to warm the pita before serving the meal. All in all, this is priced at $17.99. My husband and his parents enjoyed this meal, supplemented with a kabob platter, and had leftovers. 

While it may not be Zankou-level, it's still a great choice for a clean, healthy, and affordable meal.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,3,2,4,P7hjFQ8qqt5HSfsNhVETcA

I was expecting this place to meet the standard of Zankou Chicken in Southern CA.  The meal plates almost look alike.  Having the combo is a must.  

Some lost strikes on their chicken portion to cost comparison.  And their chicken wasn't juicy; didn't separate from the bones like magic.

They were good.  I'd rather pick up a whole roasted seasoned chicken at Smith's though; and purchase pickled veg, hummus and pita from my friend's friend.

The restaurant is clean.  The huge chicken outside the front doors is a can't miss eye catcher.  Their ice machine was out of ice.  Their online business app had a glitch with delivery fees (cost more than or almost the same as the order).

Honestly I think the 'family meal' should come with  rice or a side because without the rice, the meal totally would've been missing something.
