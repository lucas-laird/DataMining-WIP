It's usually parked outside Sand Dollar (corner of Spring Mountain and Polaris) from 10 PM - 2 AM. Nice that it's right outside the bar since Sand Dollar doesn't serve any food. I tried Tacos Zopapan tonight as we were starving. The service was super friendly and prompt! We split 3 carne asada tacos, a chicken quesadilla, and a ginormous steak burrito for $20. The gent who took our order was polite and everything came out in less than 10 minutes. We went back inside the bar to enjoy a drink while waiting for our meal to be freshly grilled.

There's a large variety of tacos to choose from for $2 each. Quesadillas are $6 and burritos are $7. Tacos for $2 are a little pricey IMO but the $7 burrito was huge and worth every penny. The $6 quesadilla was decent in size and absolutely delicious... The avocado made it complete. We agreed next time we'll just order 3 of those.

Great food truck with tasty Mexican bites. I've seen it outside Sand Dollar several times and am glad I finally tried it tonight!!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,10,8,5,SGIllrzyLwkvI5PZsC2m4g

The seasoning of everything is so goddamn on point and it's been delicious every time I stumble out of the Sand Dollar. But I swear it's not the alcohol talking.",BJt5rHl8ETUsWZmdwJnS1g,0,0,5,3V1adbOKp2hwdkd5hgkbGA
