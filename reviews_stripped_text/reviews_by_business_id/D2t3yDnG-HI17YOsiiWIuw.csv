1114094,2017-07-23,0,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,Worst Dairy Queen I have ever gone to. The manager was sour and really disrespectful when taking my order. He seemed annoyed by me even placing an order. I ordered a blizzard and it didn't for at least 10 mins. And when I got it he didn't flip it! I didn't even want to tell him because I knew he wouldn't honor the DQ code. Never go here.,ahClGCc7XQG2DpK68D-x7Q,0,0,1,c3mS2hbfpviPRrLu1xabVw

Tonight was final straw, I won't be back. Seems like they just over charge for you to only get home to realize you can't even taste anything but ice cream. What a waste.",G2WSZrlN1od72NnMZZs5Tg,1,0,1,awiFBytOCQHHuEZfgJYdig

It's about 15 mins away from my house and I would rather come here than the one close to my house. Josh thank you for making my experiences great!,HihKZXoxWtQdEGubCMVmNA,0,0,5,XgjijSTtTHXB5BNemmCXcQ
4035479,2018-05-08,3,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,"Picking up a pre called in cake for a life celebration party and decided to have dessert before lunch. We got to the store a little early since we thought opened at 10 am, but it is really 10:30 am. The staff shooed is out for about 15 minutes but I totally understand since we're so early. Besides the cake pick up I had a small strawberry sundae with whip and nuts. My son had a small hot fudge sundae extra fudge. There ice cream always takes me back to my childhood too. The service was great even brought them to our table, such a sweet place to enjoy more now that it's going to break 100 mark.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,6,5,5,R6HPwqH7BdQShcaZ4yfWBw

4667395,2017-11-08,0,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,"From the greeting to the way the word blizzard just zazzled off his tongue Delvin owned the drive through like the bank owns the car I drove through it. He brought the blizzard to Vegas circa 2007. I thought I was watching David Blain when he flipped that blizzard upside down and all the ice cream cowarded in fear of following the natural laws of gravity. Delvin Lord of Ice, Savior of the drivers through I hope the eyes of management see your true hidden late night glory shining through like my phone receiving a text through a tight pair of jeans. Delvins thorough devotion to the creaming of ice insured my cheese cake chunk mining experience produced adequate rewards even when deep below the depths an inferior Dairy Queen would say no such things dwell. May we meet again Delvin Lord of Ice.",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,2,1,5,YapiEH4miieX1NvcO84PlA
4713957,2018-04-19,1,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,This place smells so bad. It's like sour milk and raw sewage mixed together! You can even smell it out in the parking lot. You open the door and it hits you like a brick wall in the face.,AGIT1PU9RtT8ExJRiGXcog,0,0,1,U47gtS-UBcGocdI-esk1dw
4815062,2018-04-13,0,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,Don't bother coming here.  We ordered 2 simple menu items and waited more than 20 minutes.  Finally I went up to the counter and asked where our order was.  Turns out they didn't even have it.  Waited another 10 minutes and got 2 different items we didn't order.

5666682,2017-07-23,0,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,"The drive through lights and all the business signs we're off so the place looked closed when I pulled up at 9:50. It's a good thing the hours in this Yelp page show it should be opened until 11:00  PM. I would be very upset if I were the owner and the manager decided to turn off the exterior business lights an hour early. 

The drive through was empty when I pulled up and it was 6 deep when I left, I guess anther customers saw me in the drive through and decided it might be open. 

The service was fast and the ice cream was delightful.",e2LtHijFAXy4RNTDL5IELw,0,0,2,BsEvurtl0D6879Qaa1Faaw
5803464,2017-07-18,1,D2t3yDnG-HI17YOsiiWIuw,"This is my first Yelp review, and I'm writing it because of marshmallow sauce. Yes, you read that correctly. I have been to this Dairy Queen location several times since moving to Vegas a few months ago (how else is one truly supposed to survive these satanic summer temperatures) and my experience can best be described as consistently inconsistent. When they get my order correct it's great, but they don't get my order right often. Most recently I repeated my order of 2 blizzards to them 4 times over the drive thru, then again once I pulled up to confirm they had heard me correctly. I was assured they were preparing what I ordered. As I pull away from the drive thru window, I bite into my blizzard to taste- vanilla. Now folks, I can assure you I did not move to Las Vegas to live a vanilla lifestyle. I ordered a blizzard with chocolate ice cream. And they forgot other ingredients that I paid extra for on numerous occasions. My tipping point with this location is when I went to order a blizzard with marshmallow sauce and the employee responded they had ""got rid of it"". Well looks like y'all got rid of our business at this location too. Now I'm not some kind of Dairy Queen, but I was a shift manager at DQ back in high school & I have to say, get your drive thru employees' hearing checked or something. If you can't handle me at my 2 ingredient blizzard request you don't deserve me at my peanut buster parfait. I'll be sticking to Yogurtland where I can add my own toppings, because if you want something done right apparently self serve is the only way.",XRq0ca7iDooQwZKFM_1Hqw,0,0,2,vW7tPXM-sIiLtYI45pPHAw
