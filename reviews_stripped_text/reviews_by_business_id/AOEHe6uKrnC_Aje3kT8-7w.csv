28221,2014-05-13,0,AOEHe6uKrnC_Aje3kT8-7w,"After becoming bored with the typical chain pizza, I decided to give Angelo's a try and am glad I did. I ordered the pick up cheese special and added sausage, mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes and it was very good. The women in the store were friendly and polite, the bathroom was clean, and the ranch dressing cups I ordered on the side were better than most. The reason it's not getting the 5 star rating is because I feel they skimped a bit on the mushrooms - for an extra $1.75 there could have been a lot more on the pizza. But overall, it was good and I will be going back again.",D6Svy1ujwTRwjYRBWWOyow,0,0,3,VQRhMuqce-1UiSbPgtTP3g
479506,2013-09-04,0,AOEHe6uKrnC_Aje3kT8-7w,"We ordered delivery from Angelo's last night after seeing a coupon in a mailer.  We ordered 2 hamburgers but wanted them on hoagie rolls instead of bulky rolls.  We had a coupon for subs.  They have meatball subs on the menu (so we figured they would charge us for a meatball sub but instead just chop the hamburger in 1/3rds & put in the sub roll).  Well, after spending 15 minutes with the fellow taking our order, come to find out the coupon won't apply because the coupon only applies to subs listed in the menu (recall, we are basically ordering a meatball sub without the marinara).  

We say, ""ok, just bring us the order without applying the coupon"".  Delivery time was 45 minutes (long, but not ridiculous).  But then, the order was completely wrong!  Instead of  hamburger meat on a sub roll, Angelo's put hamburger meat in a tortilla wrap (which of course, we never asked for).  It was a wet, soggy mess.  I called back and spoke to Sam (who it turns out is the owner) and he had such a bad attitude.

He said, ""no substitutions are allowed on the menu.  The order taker should never have said we would put hamburger on a sub roll""  He then explained that we could come down ""right now"" for a refund or have it applied to another order.  Well, we already decided we would not order from Angelo's again so we said ""just bring us the correct order"". 

 Sam said it would be another 1-1/2 hour wait because they are ""slammed"".  But, I said, ""why should we have to wait behind other order when your establishment messed up the order in the first place.  Our order should take priority.""  Sam said, he could not do anything about the wait time.  Reluctantly, we agreed to wait for the delivery.  Finally, our correct order arrived - nearly 10pm (our original order was made at 7:30pm).  

The delivery driver complained that he wastes so much money on gas deliverying replacement order because the kitchen is constantly messing up. He gave us a complimentary dessert & I felt sorry for him.  I told him I spoke to ""Sam"" and asked if there was someone else in management I should speak with.  The delivery guy said it would do no good because ""Sam is the owner"".  We will never order from Angelo's again.  What a headache!",cYihtf2v0PA4VcDLAZ6nmQ,2,0,1,b5p8yIKqB0PQJ2dbSbpXhg

So I called Angelina's back to let them know and the old lady was so rude to me and was like there's no way there would be a bug in your food container. So I drove all the way back up to the restaurant and showed her the live bug crawling all on my food. All she said was oh wow there really is a bug. So I wanted my money back from there being a disgusting live bug crawling all over my food and for having to drive all the way back up there and for the lady's rudeness towards me. The lady said I would have to call later when the owner is there. So I went back home and called Angelina's (Angelo's) and the lady answered and said the owner was busy and would call me back.. The owner never called me back. So the next day I called and I was able to talk to the owner Sam. He was so rude to me and told me he could not refund my money! I told him how there was a live bug in my food and how unsanitary that is and how his front desk old lady was rude to me and he still did nothing for me. He is a very terrible owner and should be treating his customers kindly. How hard would it have been to refund my 9 bucks to make the customer happy and want to maybe come back after there being live bugs in their food! Sam obviously doesn't know how to run a business because the main thing is THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT! If Sam wants business he should treat his customers better and have a cleaner restaurant!!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!!! I personally don't like live bugs in my food or rude workers or a rude owner!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!,SBw735f1Ilz-F1us42Jdyg,3,0,1,dRcwBiQ3dptw6-tswlltxQ

I got a leaflet menu on my door and after a long day of work decided to give them a call. I got about 1 minute into the call and here is why: 

The young lady on the phone refused to exhibit even basic customer service skills. I asked for the #5 Combo Deal. Pizza + Wings + Chicken wings + 2 Liter. Good deal for the money, except I wanted boneless wings, something they readily have available on their menu.  It seemed like a pretty simple substitution but the young lady on the phone just said ""Yeah I can't do that."" ""Why."" ""Its just the computer I can't do it."" 

Excuse me? Okay, your computer is set up weird. Talk to your boss, a manager, call your mom, anything. 

I offered to pay extra to substitute. 

Nope. 

The least she could have done is put me on hold and go to talk to a superior and get things worked out. I didn't ask for the impossible or the outrageous, just boneless wings. 

I didn't feel respected as a customer so their leaflet is now in the trash and I'm eating some mediocre chain pizza. Sorry Angelo's! I tried to give you my money, but you wouldn't have it. Better luck next time, but there won't be a next time for me.

Good value, the toppings very plentiful and tasty but the overall product was nothing special and it took way longer than they said.  I suspect since I called in the order they didn't start making it until I arrived.  What other reason would it take 45 minutes to get a 14"" pizza with 2 toppings?

If it wasn't for they're great food, I probably wouldn't go back based off their customer service.  There's this older lady that works at the front counter and every time we go to pick up our food she seems so unorganized, she's rude and she has the worst customer service!! Don't bother calling every time I have called I've been put on hold for several minutes at a time. Usually I will hang up and call back and they would just place me on another longer hold. When I go inside to pick up our order, i just shake my head watching her scramble around! Multi-tasking is not one of her strong points LOL

Since ordering over the phone is obviously not an option, my bf and I  usually order online. Besides the crappy customer service and long delivery times ordering online is the way to go.

Their food on the other hand is delicious!! We usually order their pizza or calzones. Our first time we ordered a calzone we ordered a small and were shocked at how big it was! It was sooo yummy. My second favorite item is their deep fried mushrooms. They melt in your melt and are nice and crunchy. They make their own dough, sauce, and ranch dressing. Each time we order we make sure to get their ranch. Its to die for! We always order a few large sizes of it.

This place is definitely worth the try, food wise. But don't expect the best customer service. It sucks! Food is 5 stars but the service brings the rating down for me. I always leave frustrated!",tmqpMKWH06ClAg16AxPC6A,0,0,3,yWSYb8zNHGojq65M37Gdpg

Angelo's Pizza Kitchen not only left a menu on our door, but when we did some digging we found that they offer a 10% discount when you order through mypizza.com, so we decided to try it out.

Now, to be fair, the wait was a little long, we waited about an hour and ten minutes for our food, but when I called to ask about it the girl who answered was very nice and apologized and informed me that they were running behind but that our driver had already left with our food. He arrived within five minutes so I believed her.

However, the wait was DEFINITELY worth it! We ordered the Angelina's Special pizza (basically a supreme), a dozen traditional buffalo wings, and a cheeseburger for our picky five year old. To start, the cheeseburger was delicious! Our daughter is extremely picky with her food and she ate the entire thing, and this was no small burger, it was one that would keep either my husband or me full! The pizza was so so good and reminded me of better quality Costco pizza. Not too saucy, fresh tasting ingredients, and a beautiful crispy crust. The wings were actually traditional buffalo! They were deep fried and came with a butter/home-made hot sauce mix that was amazing! The food was all so well made and delicious that we will definitely be ordering again. Not to mention the price was great! And they have awesome family meal deals so we know who we will be ordering from when it's football season!!!",kHdG837nQo7Mr02ptlCJIw,2,0,5,J7HZbzdwq6U6YTN4YAEccA

I waited another 20 minutes and called again...I was told it was already on it's way.  I waited another 5 minutes and then called again.

I then got my pizza inside and tried a piece and it was not even close to being hot...I called back to complain and the manager hung up on me.  I called back and the owner answered and said that it was crazy that I kept calling and that there was no way the pizza was not hot.  Bottom line....I had to cook the pizza in my own oven to get it hot....at that rate, I should have gone to Papa Murphy's!!!

4147132,2013-10-09,0,AOEHe6uKrnC_Aje3kT8-7w,"I can't help but long for the days of this establishment as an Angelina's.  I don't know when it changed and I don't know why.  All I know is that it isn't quite as good as it once was.  I ordered a stromboli with pepperoni, spinach and mushrooms.  That is a rather typical order for me.  It was still good but there were some things wrong with it.  First of all, it was hard to cut through as it seemed to be over cooked.  Parts of the bottom had gone beyond golden brown and into the realm of being burnt.  It was dark but it did not have that burnt taste.  Yet.  A few minutes more and it would have.  On the inside was a lot of cheese which I appreciate.  But what it had in cheese it lacked in everything else.  There was pepperoni, spinach and mushrooms as requested but not in the quantities that I was used to receiving from Angelina's.  On the other hand, when I ordered a pizza from here in April and it was Angelo's, the pizza was quite good.  So it hasn't gone completely down the drain when it comes to the food.

As for the inside, there is not much to it.  It is small with only a few tables to sit at.  There are two TVs usally with sports on.  And then there is the music.  Two speakers in the corner last night were blairing some loudness that was starting to irritate me.  It wasn't background music.  It was Genesis and Godsmack with absolutely no bass and far too much trebel.  It sounded tinny and hurt my ears.  Had the sound quality been better or the volume turned down, it would have been alright.  This was just downright unpleasent.  I'm glad I ordered my food to go.  Its just too bad I had to suffer for the 15 to 20 miuntes while my stromboli cooked. 

I don't know if or when I will be back.  I get frequent fliers advertising other pizza places near by.  Maybe I'll give them a try next time.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,2,3,DqJ7_jyseaAbkSdZH2uoWQ
