Unfortunately I have come to this location far too many times that I should have with the poor service that I constantly receive here. Today was the final straw.

I spent 25 minutes waiting after I ordered to reach the window at which point the cashier did not even have my order in the system. It has now been 32 minutes and I am still waiting for my food. Two sandwiches and a drink...

Having managed multiple restaurants similar to this chain, it was easy to see that they were understaffed. I understand that things can happen and you can lose a certain number of your staff in the day which makes it difficult. There was however no sense of urgency and buy any of the staff. It was clear that all of them were upset and it definitely showed. Will never be back to this location again.",ltUb21ZilinnvIjGbO9FAQ,0,0,1,M9pnxYMYI26fqzPAbEVdHQ

Maybe 1 cars in front off the guy however just to order the food through the drive thru first off all the girls sounds like she didn't care.
Then by the time I got to the window was 1;20 am and I was already annoyed to bad I can't drive away and straight home instead because I was tired and hungry.
So all in all I got my food at 1:25 which is like way out off mcdonald's league right? I mean is that not fast food place? Shouldn't that not go quicker?",DgS1_iYo9Y_8bOlBeJl6DA,0,0,1,FEi-K72j1Tk4jrevh9MWIA

Let's just say, not the best.  I've been 4+ times to this location.  3 of the 4 times, they had my order wrong.  Once, when ordering chicken mcnuggets via the Drive-thru, they asked me to pull around the corner and park...and they would bring it out to me.  I waited 20 minutes!  

On a positive note, if you order and decide to eat there, the inside is actually pretty big and kept clean.  It's also offstrip and has easy parking.  

P.S. In-and-Out is just one more block up the street!",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,1,0,2,RVgO3a-TqYylDfpxiKoZOg
