I had a very good Chicken Quesadilla.  My husband liked his Chicken Burrito.  Both dishes came adorned with very fresh tomato slices and shredded lettuce on the side.  Great nachos, hot salsas, and ice cold Cokes rounded out the rest of our meal.  Fine ingredients and no grease. Unfortunately, they serve food as if it were ""to-go"" using plastic, paper, and styrofoam instead of more durable ceramic plates and metal flatware.  This is a huge turn-off for us.  This restaurant is WAY better than Pepe's Tacos though, which is right around the corner with great signage.  Go beyond Pepe's and try the more hidden Jarochos if ""to-go-ware"" doesn't bother you.",qTllTILQ6JVifkO-5ezm2Q,2,0,3,1nm0PI_vJV4godn_OQwgsw

simply place - order at counter then sit down for food to be delivered.  I was ordering lunch to-go.

Went with an asada taco ( $1.99), carnitas taco ( $1.75) and al Pastor ( $1.75) along with a beef empanada ( under $2) 

Food came out quickly, took home without thinking about salsa bar.  Luckily, server provided limes, green and red sauce.

The empanada ?  3 words - Where's the beef ?!?!  For some reason it reminded me of a puffy taco because it was 90% air and maybe, and it's a stretch, maybe 1 tablespoon of meat - not happy.

The tacos - all were decent - fair amount of meat but a slight ding for only one tortilla - and yes, the 2nd tortilla makes a difference.  I give a slight nod to the al pastor.

Will this be my go-to place ?  Not sure yet - I need to try a few more items and ask if they can add a 2nd tortilla to the taco.  overall, not a bad experience.

I prefer the salsa verde over the mole enchiladas and do not forget to wash it down with some jamacia drink.

I liked the meat, it was more lean and less greasy but kind of mild in the flavor I was expecting. It was topped with fresh onion and celantro. Most my tacos never held together and the fillings burst out the middle of the tortillas, I just picked them up with my fingers.

2798951,2011-05-03,2,kiU9C58n7dgygdrpjOQXMQ,"I was so excited to see this place open up recently. I live close by so having a taqueria in my hood meant that I might be a regular visitor. Unfortunately, after two visits I'm not thrilled with the quality. And, I hate giving bad -- or even average -- reviews to mom and pop shops because I want them to succeed. But, here's the lowdown...

My first visit I got four tacos ($1.75 each). The carne asada was tough and chewy, the two pastor tacos had tender meat and were well seasoned (so hot I kept reaching for my drink), and the carnitas were the best of the bunch. Each taco only had one tortilla, but were filled with plenty meat, onions,  and cilantro. They didn't have any bottled water, but had bottles of soda for $2.

They had a spit/rotisserie set up but the manager said they wouldn't be using it until business picked up.

The second visit I got a chicken empanada ($1.77). It was a large empanada filled with chicken and a tomato/onion mixture. It could have been more crispy, but it tasted really good. I also got a carnitas burrito ($6.75) which was filled with plenty of pork, rice, beans, cilantro, and onions. Unlike the carnitas taco on my previous visit, this pork was bland and way too fatty. I'm usually easy to please and will eat everything in front of me, but I could only finish half of the burrito. Not because it was a huge burrito (it was big) but because the carnitas weren't that good.

I really want this place to do well and I wish the owners the best of luck. But, I just can't say that I'm a fan.

My favorite Mexican food is Casa Zapata's over in N. Las Vegas but it's a drive if I need a mexican fix. 

Let's use Roberto's as a benchmark. If you like Roberto's (which I think is a great value, and I think super-nacho's are a masterpiece at 5AM) then stay away from Jarorcho's. It is twice the price, and not even close to what you can get at Roberto's.

The restaurant was sparkling clean (Well, It is brand new...) and the order taker was nice.  

 I ordered a marinated pork burrito, and Gayla ordered the mole enchilada's. 

We were greeted with cold, overcooked unsalted chips, and homemade salsa which saved the chips. I won't go into the salsa because we expect it to be good in any Mexican establishment.  

The pork sits on a rotisserie, and I ordered it because it looked unique and might be delicious. What I got was flat top cooked bits of pork drowned in a sea of rice and beans. The ol' chipotle gimmick. 

I have been spoiled by Roberto's in the fact that they put nothing but meat in their burritos, and I like it that way. 

The taste was ok, but the hard bits of pork made me wonder where it came from.

Gayla's enchilada's were the size of taquito's and got lost in all the mole sauce they put there. It was really dry and tasteless. 

Total cost for 2 entree's and one soda, $22 bucks.

3599510,2013-03-14,6,kiU9C58n7dgygdrpjOQXMQ,"I seriously disagree with the three star average Los Jarochos has gotten...probably because the majority of these two star and below reviews are from two years ago.

Fast forward to 2013...we were in the mood for some tacos, and we have our favorite spots we frequent, but instead of hitting the streets, this time we decided to give Los Jarochos a try since we've driven by countless times and is also heavily favored by Duchess and fellow Yelper Alison Y.

As you step inside, the place is spacious, clean, and inviting. You have a wide selection of items-Tacos, Tortas, Burritos, Soups, Tostadas, Empanadas, and Combination Plates, the list goes on and on...Another good sign is the homemade agua frescas up front. Not out of a machine, or a nasty pre-made mix, and whats even sweeter about it? FREE REFILLS! Who does that???Los Jarochos does!

We decide from the plethora of items to go for some tacos and empanadas for our first visit. We ordered the Crab Empanada since it sounded good, and we decided to share a Tostada de Pollo. For our tacos, we each got Tripa(ask for it bien doradito, or crispy)and Borrego(lamb). You heard me right... Lamb Tacos? Who does that???Los Jarochos does!

Out of all the items we ordered, everything was delicious, but the Crab Empanada was just blah...now what we expected.The tacos are about the size of El Gordos, and these are fresh tortillas, another plus which wil automatically make me a fan. I found a little piece of bone in my Lamb Taco, but that ain't gonna cause me to be critical and ding them a star. These were so good, we ordered up another round of Borrego and Tripas tacos and a Cheese Empanada. A little note on the empanadas here-these aren't your flaky dough, baked type of empanada, these are fresh masa filled goodies that ""poof up"" when dropped in the fryer, so the filling may not look plentiful, but is still a simple, straightforward treat. Overall, a great first visit, and we will be back for more!....ALOHA!!!

What they do have are in little tiny 1 ounce cups that you have to ask for, and when you do, they bring you one. Really? That's enough for maybe 2 bites. Don't skimp on the salsa!!
A bottle of Tapitio on the table, ok not bad, but how about a few other options?
I tried the empanada, there was a warning on the side: ""Contents may have settled during shipping"" There might have been 2 tablespoons of filling. Yes it was only 1.75 but still...
The pastor burrito was huge, but it was mostly rice and beans. The few chunks of meat I did taste was ok.
i can't forget the horrible music playing.

4074244,2014-01-17,0,kiU9C58n7dgygdrpjOQXMQ,"Yelpers, you steered me wrong on this one! I found this place highly rated and decided to stop on it. I wanted to love Los Jarochos based on the reviews and the atmosphere but I was super disappointed in their tacos. 

This is obviously a family run establishment and it pains me to write a 2 star review but I have to. The warm greeting when I walked in was lovely, as was the delicious smell coming from the back of the kitchen. The charming older Mexican ladies cooking my tacos made me smile and got the foodie in me thinking ""wow, these are going to be some seriously kick-ass street tacos."" When my food was ready, I was more than disappointed. 

I ordered a carne asada and a chicken taco. The meat was poor quality, with a slight edge going to the carne asada. The chicken taco was HORRIBLE. The meat wasn't white meat or breast, it was more like rubbery, chewy thigh meat -- the kind of ""chicken"" you get at the worst Chinese restaurants. That's not my cup of tea, so beware. The prices were cheap enough (we both ate for $12 total), but the food wasn't good. 

The chips tasted like something out of a bag and the salsas were really thin and runny. Don't attack me for liking a bit of chunk with my salsa. The flavors were okay but nothing I wanted to finish eating. The homemade corn tortillas were good. The tacos were fine but they are very heavy on the cilantro and onions so if you want to do some kissing later, skip the toppings. 

It looks like in the past they had a more extensive menu but now, half the signs are covered up or scribbled out with magic marker. Maybe their more ""exotic"" meats are what's good here, but I really just wanted a chicken taco, not a tongue taco. The restaurant was clean and pleasant. 

I was just so let down by this place.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,1,0,2,WMXZ6oBh9ylVWz6yAURifw

Their no frills menu looks something straight out from those authentic hole-in-the-wall places I frequent whenever in Mexico City. I usually do my test with the basic: if you have good guacamole then I can only look forward for a delicious meal. Jarochos also serves one of the best tasting camarones (shrimp) burrito in town--their burrito is crammed with beautifully cooked shrimp that you can taste with every single bite (no skimping there!) and mixed in with rice and pico de gallo. Get a side of roasted peppers and you should be set! Other dishes we've tried and loved includes their tacos de tripas--simply tasty and worth trying if you haven't already and also their empanadas which come filled in your choice of succulent shrimp, chicken, or cheese (I recommend trying all since they are small enough).

4251182,2013-01-17,2,kiU9C58n7dgygdrpjOQXMQ,"Holy cow, I thought I had already written a review of this place! I've been coming to Los Jarochos ever since they opened (I was sad that the kabobs place closed though). I had read an article by local food critic Max Jacobson where he said he had really enjoyed the food. 

My husband loves this place. So much so, that when I suggest we check out a new taco tand or head to an old favorite, he feels like he is cheating on the place. Really. When I come here I always order the tostadas de pollo, you can order individually or an order which comes with three. I always go for three, but really two are sufficient. Hubby gets a variety of tacos, lengua, birria, asada, etc. and he loves them all. 

The reason I was compelled to write this review today is because we recently went and I was craving something other than tostadas. Hbby recommended a torta, which he sometimes gets and also loves. HOLY COW! I ordered a torta de asada and my goodness it was extraordinary. The meat had that special sazon that you get when eating food in Mexico and the bread was sooo good! I don't know what they do to it but I dare say it is the best torta in town. The only thing I've ordered and haven't liked were the shrimp empanadas, that had weird little shrimp in it and were off tasting. Also you can get better tacos al pastor elsewhere.

Your best bet here is going for simple dishes; I noticed someone used Roberto's as a comparison, someone also mentioned the tacos have one, not two tortillas. If you are looking for an authentic, inexpensive Mexican restaurant, this is the place.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,2,2,5,zuHw_Aft10RjVyQxs_BOSw

Best torta I have ever had.  Nice soft bread, avocado, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato and choice of meat.   I always get the pastor because it is sliced off the spit and is mixed with pineapple.  

Everything is always fresh and the family that runs the place is always so nice.  I will always eat here if I crave some south of the border.",vlc6EN9zb66D01fLE8ehPQ,1,1,5,0aOySVZK13VB5mJ15N9OHg

The place is very very clean and orderly. Bathrooms were immaculate. Tables were quickly cleared and wiped down. It's even nicely decorated. I love the neon sign on the outside. Very tasteful! Dining area is a nice size as well. Tables are well spread out so you don't feel like you are sitting on top of someone. Although, every time I've been here, it's been pretty empty.

Staff was friendly. I ordered the lingua tacos. The linqua was cooked to perfection, and they didn't skimp on it either. A lot of mexican restaurants I've been to, will throw a couple of pieces in there and then fill the rest with cilantro and whatever else.

Chips and salsa were super tasty - not greasy. I don't know what their house salsa is but it was so good. I couldn't get enough.

I will say that the food was under-seasoned, but still delicious. It just needed some simple salt or authentic seasoning to complete it. 

I'll def be coming back here as an alternative to Roberto's. The food seemed fresher and less greasy.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,3,1,4,uUF8Wv_P4jRpJnbZ0wIlEw
