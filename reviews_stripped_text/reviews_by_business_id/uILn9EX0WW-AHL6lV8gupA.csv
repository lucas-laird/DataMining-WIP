Its conveniently tucked away inside the Gold Spike pretty close to the door.  The ladies behind the counter were nice and cheerful.  We were pleasantly surprised at how yummie the grilled cheese sandwiches were.  They use 4 different types of cheeses (not that gross american cheese).  We thought it was grilled to perfection.  We both got tater tots for our sides.. yum!  We went there thinking it was a one time thing.... but after glancing at the rest of the menu and our yummie experience i would go out of the way to return.,wqry2RbeN7DTvBZrW7QjAA,1,2,5,60NRuJhr0zJog9fDEY0nQQ

The service extremely friendly however a bit slow.  Really that is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, because honestly, the food was ON POINT!!!  My boyfriend got the chicken & waffles which were more savory with just a hint of sweet due to the sauce covering the dish which consisted of cheese, bacon, scallions and other delights.  I ordered the breakfast burger with shoestring fries.  Probably the best prepared shoestrings I've ever had. Then the burger, which can only be described as an absolute dream!

I arrived on a Sunday with a friend of mine and entered paradise. Oasis at the Goldspike is located in the back of this place, a childhood dream come true. There is so many games, tetherball, twister etc. It was like entering elementary school without being as insecure and awkward. 

Now to review Fiddlestix, it is a small fast place to grab something to eat while drinking at multiple places inside. They have burgers, grilled cheese (unicorn), tater tots, pastries, coffee etc. 

I purchased the unicorn grilled cheese with tater tots. It came out and I must say it was delicious but tasted a little sweet. I spoke with an employee and was informed they sprinkle sprinkles on top of it so it is salty and sweet. It was an instagram worthy picture/presentation. I will be back there to try more things. 

They did have complimentary tablets that were attached to the wall where you could check in on social media. The staff was friendly and even gave lighting advice for taking photos. The food was great for being in a bar area and quick service. I was impressed and will return to try other options including their alcohol infused milkshakes.",cqy-OvaSX5fCiL6F6_Rffw,3,1,5,20n6xN2h958DG-_Xz7eFCw

The restaurant was pretty hard to find.. We walked around 2 or 3 times and finally found it inside Gold Spike hotel.
We ordered the steak lovers breakfast skillet & the açai bowl.

The steaklovers breafast was very good. It was $12 with an egg, steak skillet and two pieces of bread - they also will ask you how you like your egg.

The Açai bowl was pretty good- they offer 4 toppings which is alot for $9.
I had the açai bowl with granola, mixed melons, strawberries, and crasins.

Overall this place is worth trying out if you are around downtown vegas.. It was about 5 min walk..

I only write reviews when I have really great or really off-putting experiences, and I had the latter here today for lunch. I have a feeling Fiddlestix is more geared toward the late night crowd when other sandwichy options are closed. The food is fine--in fact, it's yummy, but there's plenty of similar, also fine food downtown in the same price range at lunch time so I won't come back here unless it's late, and there's booze involved. 

The main offense was the only employee with whom I interacted. She was rude to the point of seeming pissed off that I had dared order food from her. My assumption is that maybe she was having a really bad day, or maybe I came off as unfriendly to her on accident and she was just returning the favor.

The nachos plate was a hit with everyone, the portions were perfect and it seemed to be the first dish to ""disappear"" before we even touched out own personal dishes.

Presentation to all the food was nice and appealing creating that anticipation to bite in!

Caprese flatwich: just right, not overwrought with too many topping leaving the bread to soft, here it rightly portioned and still had that crisp!

Fish tacos with Alaskan cod: The tacos were great, light and crispy battered cod filets topped with a nice slaw and cheery tomatoes. It was good but it could use perhaps a mild aioli with a maybe a slight kick. Just some feedback :)

Chicken and waffles: chicken was very good! The breeding was crisp and the chicken nice and juicy. Not to happy about the waffles. They seemed too flat and soft, when I cut into them, they actually came a part, perhaps ""crumbled"" may be a better word. 

Most of the dishes were served with a side of potato tots, like the Nacho, they were hit also!

I'm going to come back in a later time and give this place another chance.

One thing that always draws my attention to this place is the bold and colorful decor. The floors remind me of those geode rocks - all sorts of swirly colors. They also have scrabble tiles on the wall spelling out food related words, and also funky fake animal heads sticking out of the wall. 

The service was quick and friendly. As for the unicorn grilled cheese, I definitely hyped it up in my head. It's good, but not the magical experience I was anticipating. The sprinkles also threw me off - I wasn't expecting them, and the sweetness clashed with the savory. That being said, I loved the rainbow cheese and I mostly came for the experience.

I had an issue that needed to be resolved, so I called Fiddlestix on the telephone. For whatever reason, they are essentially unreachable. I have called approximately 25 times over the past five days trying to get in touch with someone who can help me since I live across the country and can't just run down the street to the restaurant. I have called so many times that I assumed they must have been closed until I recently checked their business hours... apparently they're open 24/7. ONCE out of 25 times my call was answered and they took down my number to call me back... no call yet. If you call the Gold Spike main line, three of the four different extensions redirect to the same line and after four rings (during which you have approximately a 1% chance of your call being answered), it cuts off your call. If you call the number on Yelp, it doesn't even ring, just sends you to a mailbox that has not yet been set up. I can't for the life of me figure out why I can't get in contact with Fiddlestix, but it is extremely frustrating and unfortunately the food was not good enough to risk dealing with this ridiculousness again.",T88y73qdOSutuvzLlhWtqQ,7,0,1,6o8CN_MEvFzvDzAh998tSw

My wife saw a video on YouTube feature Fiddlestix's ""Unicorn Grilled Cheese"". We couldn't wait to have our daughters, ages 8 and 11 to try this item. The video advertised this as a ""Secret Menu Item.""

So we arrived and our daughters immediately noticed the electronics on the wall and took to that. The restaurant looked very inviting to us.

 My wife and I were viewing the large menu on the wall. We saw the Unicorn Grilled Cheese advertised.  So much for being a hidden menu item.

She decided to try a Southwest Chicken Wrap, advertised as having avocado, the wife said she could hardly taste it. She also wished it had a little more spice to it's taste, that's what she expected from a Southwest Chicken Wrap.

I tried the ""3 Way Pig"". No complaints, except that it did taste a little burnt, possibly over cooked.

Both daughters tried the Unicorn Grilled Cheese. The older daughter didn't care for it. She says her bread and cheese were both burnt. But she did eat it all.

The younger daughter had the same complaints. She didn't like it from the first bite.  as he and her Mom traded half the Unicorn Grilled Cheese for half of the Southwest Chicken Wrap.

The floors at FIDDLESTIX had a neat design, but needed to be mopped. 

Service, my 3 Way Pig was served before anyone else's meal. Not good. At least bring out the kids meals first.

Not once did a staff member approach our table and ask how things were.

Sadly all four of us left disappointed.

Wow!  We were at the Mob Museum and needed lunch.  My husband looked on trusty Yelp and the Cafe Market across the street had terrible reviews. He kept looking and this place came up with great reviews. We walked five minutes in the rain to it. The location is a little confusing because there seems to be an entrance in a parking lot but you actually have to go around to the street side and enter the Gold Spike Hotel and Casino to get in. 

My kids has burgers and my husband and I split the chicken pesto panini.  When I asked about what kind of oil they used they girl behind the counter seemed a little clueless. My son has a life/threatening peanut allergy so it's a tad important.  She went into the back and found out vegetable oil so we were all set. 

The Burgers were huge, melt in your mouth monsters. And the fries uber crispy and tasty.  Our panini had great flavor and was big and juicy.  They also have one of those crazy soda machines that has a ton of variety. 

The atmosphere is a little weird.  I had my doubts going in.  The floor is cement. You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. There's a salad and pastry display right up front to encourage you to be good and then bad in your choices. The seats aren't comfortable and don't encourage you to hang around. Service is okay... They forgot the panini and we went to the counter to get it. 

The music is great too! 

I completely recommend this place. If you're at the Mob Museum it's a don't miss for us now whenever we are in Vegas.",SS_PMxi0tJA5tim27T7qBQ,3,2,5,VkUGRVk8sD1hUohVatgUNw

Batter on the fish was really crispy and good though. They hit the spot, but they're definitely not the best fish tacos in town. The BBQ tossed chicken strips were your typical chicken strips, so they were good. Tots and fries are great at Fiddlestix if you like them really crisp. 

Service is lacking. The two times I've gone so far, it's taken a few minutes to be acknowledged by anyone, even standing a few feet away from them at the counter.
