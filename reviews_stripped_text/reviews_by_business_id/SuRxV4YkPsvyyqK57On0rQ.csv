85304,2011-11-28,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Terrible service. Discriminatory service. I will never go here again. 
We went for brunch on a Saturday morning two weeks ago. We were sat at 10:50am. We waited on our server for a while before we could order at 11:05. I wanted to order an item that wasn't available until 11:30, but I was told that I could not. I told our server (whose name started with a J and contained some 'e's) that I wanted exactly the short stack with berries that was featured in a picture on the menu. ""Is that the short stack?"" I asked. She said, ""Well, the short stack has 6 pancakes."" I said, ""Yes, and the picture has 6 pancakes, so it's the same, right? It comes with berries?"" Server: ""Sure."" Me: ""Ok, I want it just like the picture."" Not too confident that she really knew the menu. My husband ordered a 3-course brunch meal with a wrap, soup, and salad. 
Meanwhile, another table had sat down near us. They ordered, from our same server, at 11:20-- 15 minutes after us-- and the server told them that they COULD order off of the post-11:30 menu. Wow. I could have waited 10 minutes if I'd known that was the difference... in the end, I ended up waiting over an hour for our entrees, anyway. The soup came out fairly quickly. We waited another 25 minutes for the salad. Meanwhile, the table next to us was receiving their food more quickly than ours-- brought out personally by the chef herself. The chef passed by our table and only smiled, never stopped or spoke to us. 
Our server came by again and  asked confirming our wrap order, except she asked me about it, completely forgetting that my husband ordered it, not me. Even later, she came by again and said, ""Let me check on your entree order"". Even later than that, she came by and said, ""It should be 5 minutes, the chef said."" During that time, the chef brought out a complimentary sample dish of apple dessert to the table next to us.  Then our waiter came back, 5 minutes later (when our entrees should have arrived) and brought us the same dish of apple dessert, because, in her words, ""sorry for the delay; here is something that the chef is working on."" 
It was only at 12:25 that we finally received our entrees. Completely inexcusable. The table next to us received theirs less than a minute after us, yet they ordered more than 15 minutes after we did. AGain, the chef brought out their entrees. They were the only table that received visits from the chef even though their server was actually our server. It seemed completely fishy to me.
After we'd finished our entrees, a different lady (working the register) came over to our table and asked if our food was ok. She must have seen that we'd been there an hour and a half. She did not offer us anything or offer to discount our meal or anything. Neither did our server. Or the chef. Instead, when we received our bill, I was charged an extra fee for adding berries on the short stack. They were not even good. And, there were only 2 rasberries, the rest were strawberries. In the picture, there were raspberries, blackberries, blueberries. 
We were planning to come back there every day that we were in LV because the desserts looked so good and we were excited about the food. The whole experience was so disgusting that we refused to return. I highly suggest that you go elsewhere for vegan food in LV. We had a fantastic experience at Komol Thai Restaurant. Delicious AND fast, friendly service.

After the waitress seated my wife and I at the one decently lit free table, and we were ready to order, Mayra decided that a party of three which had just entered deserved our table more than we did and told us that we were sitting at the ""wrong table"", and demanded we move.   Now if she had said, please, or, excuse me, or sorry, or do you mind, we would have cooperated.   But there was no reason that the threesome, (which turned out to be there for take-away and NOT for a table)  should have had priority over us.  When I told Mayra that we would rather leave, she pointedly replied that this was a community restaurant, implying that our behavior was inappropriate.  So we got up to leave.   At that point someone told Mayra that the threesome was there for take-away, which should have been her cue to apologize to us, offer us a free drink, and invite us to be seated, but nooooooo.

296207,2014-01-04,8,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Had an appt at UMC nearby so thought I would stop here for a quick bite afterwards.
Wrong thing to do.  

I came here a couple of times when it was first opened and was seated right away.  Now, what's this nonsense about needing reservations?  I can understand reservations at one of the strip hotels and/or fancy schmany places...but this hole in the wall needs reservations at mid-day?  Even when there was something like 5 empty tables?  

Somehow I convinced the waitress to seat me.  She gives me the convoluted menus and starts explaining whats not available, what's being substituted etc.  So I ordered a glass of water and the empanadas.   After waiting almost 45 minutes, I finally got my food.  The order of empanadas were so small, it's like she took one big one and cut it up into 4 little pieces and that's it.  There was more garnishes on the plate than empanadas.  Scarfed it down and waited almost a half hour for the check.  

Mayra has not changed one bit since she opened this place.  Still a screaming control freak without an ounce of business or customer service sense.  She was like that years ago when she was the pastry baker for Sunrise Coffee and decided that she would only bake banana nut cupcakes, nothing else.  It's her way or no way.

I paid the outrageous bill and left, vowing to NEVER return.  Mayra is a legend in her own mind.",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,8,2,1,b_q2fSZaVXJnxkkLMCoahQ
303454,2011-12-18,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I truly wanted to love this place.  I would love to see more veg-friendly and all-veg restaurants in this town.  I make sure to thank the ones that I visit for thinking of us when planning out their menu.   But my experience at Pura Vida was not pleasant and I've had better vegetarian food elsewhere.

There were a good bit of customers at the restaurant when we arrived for a late Sunday brunch, but the place wasn't packed.  We were seated quickly and I started off with an apple agua fresca to drink.  It tasted like water with a splash of apple juice thrown in.  It was barely tolerable to drink.  Although a roadblock, I didn't let it get me down and still kept my hopes up for a good meal.

While looking at the menu, I noticed what another reviewer below had said: there is a lot of soy and starch.   I was honestly expecting a lot more veggies on the menu.  Well, whatever, it was brunch and I usually get starchy things anyway.  So I ordered the The Latin'Tude burrito combo meal while my husband ordered the The Dark Choco Waffle.

The wait for our food was pretty long, especially considering the place wasn't at capacity.  While waiting, we ended up noticing that the restaurant didn't look terribly clean.  The table seemed pretty dirty as well as the wall we were sitting next to.  Not a good thing to be looking at while you are waiting around for your food.

First they brought out my chips and salsa.  The chips were the absolute bottom of the bag teeny-tiny broken up bits of chips that are impossible for dipping in anything.  Being a small place, I felt bad asking for new chips and used what I had as best as I could.  The salsa that came with the chips was a ""warm salsa"" and tasted exactly like black bean chili to me.   It wasn't bad, but not at all what I was expecting.

For my next course I had a salad with a citrus dressing.  It was leaps and bounds better than everything else I had up until that point.  The veggies were fresh and the dressing had a nice light taste.  There were edible flowers and even some corn shoots in the salad that made it pretty to look at.

My burrito was good.  It was presented nicely and even though there were a lot of ingredients, everything blended nicely.  With all the soy and potatoes, it filled me up quickly.  I do think it could have used some more vegetables and the fake cheese wasn't really necessary at all.

My husband's chocolate waffle was good- if you like eating dessert at any hour of the day.  I was thinking it would be a waffle (crispy on the outside with a warm doughy inside) with some cocoa in the batter.  It, however, was a chocolate cake in the shape of a waffle.  Literally imagine a chocolate cake the size of a large dinner plate and you will have the consistency of this waffle.  It was super rich and had waaaaaaay too much cocoa.  To top it off, it was covered in chocolate chips and chocolate sauce (want some chocolate with your chocolate?).  He was pretty disappointed with his meal.  I took a few bites and it hurt my stomach.  This is a dessert, not a breakfast item.

After immediately leaving, I considered giving this place 3 stars since my salad and burrito were good and we had a friendly server.  But about 10 minutes after that initial thought, I started to get a really nasty stomachache with cramps.  It was around 1 or 2 in the afternoon when we got to the restaurant and it was the only thing I had eaten so far that day.  I can't imagine I could get food poisoning from a vegan restaurant, but whatever happened left me ill the rest of the day.  

Needless to say, I'll be finding vegetarian food elsewhere.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,5,0,2,Asse3nniPQofvNYWImqSVQ

427061,2013-04-24,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I haven't been to Pura Vida in quite a while and based on the more recent reviews, service has gone considerably downhill.  It seems that most of these issues are related to wait times, stress out chef/staff, and the price of the food.  Honestly, as much as I love a discount, I think the groupons were a HUGE mistake for chef Mayra and Pura Vida.  She had a thriving, successful small restaurant before offering groupons and I really don't how it has benefited her business.  I had heard that they were extremely busy all the time, and that the wait for food was even worse than it had been.  I am using my groupon tomorrow to pick up a to-go order, which I placed today (that was a first).  I can deal with that, so long as my order is ready to be picked up at the arranged time.  

It really saddens me that Pura Vida got caught up in bringing in more and more people via groupon.  The space is simply not large enough to accommodate the kind of numbers a groupon deal will attract.  This used to be one of my favorite places because it was all vegan, quaint, the prices were reasonable for the amount of food served, and the chef and staff always made us feel welcome.  I truly hope Pura Vida remembers why its patrons loved it so much, and return to their roots, asap.  

p.s.  My rating may change depending on how it goes tomorrow.

*UPDATE*  So, my food was ready, exactly as requested when I came to pick it up.  The food was hot and delicious (as always).  I am not sure about dining in at Pura Vida until they get a better handle on the wait times, but as long as you have an idea of what you want, calling in for pick-up is definitely an option.",SVVmfF8e9VkrWYuVbzuY6w,2,0,3,6UZ6TvsXayJDS1JR02Ig4g

454168,2013-03-28,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I want SO badly for this place to work. Let's break it down: 

Pro's: 
The food is really great. 
The Chef is passionate about food 
There is a lot to choose from. 

Con's 
The wait - it can take 1+ hours to get a simple dish. I've been on a few occasions and the host has told me that if I called a day or 2 ahead of time I would have got the food faster. 

The price - for two of us at lunch we paid 56 dollars. That is more than what you'll pay at Wynn. We got 2 lunch specials and an appetizer, no drinks. At Wynn we got 2 appetizers drinks and entrees and paid 60 dollars. Even with the Groupon it was just too expensive for what it is. 

The service. The staff is very kind, when they come around. It can take a long time to even get a menu. 

The menu - what would work great here is a fixed menu. Just 2-3 things that the Chef decides on every day. They bring you 3-5 menu's and then have all of these add ons, restrictions and things to let you know. Like ""This dish is great, but avocado is not in season so we use something else, and you can't get berries in this dish anymore, but you can get bananas, and you can't get this dish anymore, but the chef made something else up, but we don't remember what it is"". I think the Chef is brilliant - so let her be brilliant and offer 2-3 things a day that she loves. Rather than a huge confusing menu that takes hours to get through. 

The atmosphere. They could easily get away with the eccentricity, weird menu and long waits if the place was really nice inside. It  is definitely a hole in the wall kind of place, plastic thick table cloths and all, which works if it's an inexpensive and fast diner. 

Like I said - I really want this place to work, and I think it could, but there definitely needs to be some improvements and some price adjusting, I'm still shocked how much we paid for a meal. For that, I'd much rather do something super fancy.",lpxFHWDGh8l9K81Z9f68Og,6,1,3,2cRdeKbbvckNrdEZeWB85A

We were actually coming to taste a sampler of sorts for a potential catering opportunity, and ended up trying the best of the best that the amazing Chef Mayra had to offer. We first started with some breakfast, I had a waffle the size of my head, which was incredible. It had a hint of cinnamon with the texture of a really good carrot cake. My friend had the breakfast of vegan champions, and because I can't remember exactly what it was, the meal consisted of ""eggs"", ""sausage"", and ""potatoes."" Just kidding, the potatoes were real live potatoes and super delicious.

Several hours after our initial orders, we had gone through plate after plate of different veg-tastic food and could barely breathe. My friend ended up ordering a jillion empanadas, pastry puffs, buckets of bean salsa, and cupcakes for her cocktail wedding reception. At said reception, the guests had no idea the food was even vegan but very  obviously enjoyed every single meat-less bite. By the time I even got to dessert, a friend had to force-feed me half of one lemon cupcake and half of a chocolate cupcake (my fav, btw) because they were just too good NOT to eat; even if my entire body had to shut down to digest all of that delicious food.

If the idea of vegan food excites you about as much as a slab of cardboard with a side of newspaper mush, then Pura Vida will certainly change your carnivore ways. There is something about the spices Chef Mayra has so effortlessly conquered that really work in such a way that you forget you're not eating meat/processed foods, but instead fresh and eco-friendly meals that just make you want to throw your head back and praise the vegan gods.",ngWl_gELk-CvPPeKe8bPKw,5,3,5,au9NKT1hEZzwqEIfzzyUvg

The burritos were great except the potatoes, which were flavorless and took away from the rest of it. The entree alone gets four stars. 

BUT! Dessert was awful. We had the carrot cake. I love Chef Mayra's carrot cake normally, I've purchased it at Rainbow Food prior to my visit to Pura Vida. This time the cake was stale, and stuck to the paper they served it on. The chocolate sauce didn't go at all well with the cake. It also had an odd astringent taste, perhaps too much of one spice?

The service was worse. It wasn't that my server wasn't trying, but she was obviously overwhelmed by the amount of customers. It took forever to get our food. We were in the restaurant for almost two hours, for just one entree and one pre-made dessert.

The restaurant didn't look very clean, it was extremely cluttered. I also saw an employee handle the phone/computer/etc. while wearing food handling gloves, I sure hope she changed them when she went into the kitchen! The paper towels were on the floor in the bathroom, gross! Parking was nearly non-existant and I was worried I was going to get towed. The location was also hard to find.

I called the day before and made a reservation for two and said one of us would be having the gluten free frenchie. I received a very lovely call the following morning from the chef herself. She said she was delighted to have us try her restaurant, and she will have all the ingredients ready so that way when we arrive she can start cooking. I was touched to receive such a friendly call. 

When we arrived, the chef came out and greeted us and took my friend's order. Our waiter was friendly, and she was checking in enough to make sure our water glasses were full but not overly doing it either. 

Our food took some time to cook, but I didn't mind because I knew everything was fresh and being cooked to our requests. When the food came out, Mayra stopped by and asked how I liked it. The french was amazing. It was the first time I had gluten free french toast outside my own home. It was sweet but not overly so. The presentation on my plate was wonderful with orange and banana slices. I loved the mixed fruit syrup in addition to the regular syrup.

My friend ordered a short stack of pancakes with the berry syrup. The short stack was huge and she only ate half. I cannot wait to try the pancakes the next time I go here. 

Overall, it was an excellent choice for Sunday brunch. The service is personal and great. The food is excellent. I am already making plans to eat here next month!",3MuxtbJf63r1IzOoedGh7A,0,0,5,vyvwPFFUEuZjWW5NdGYdqA

Definitely good for an intro to vegan food with lots of 'comfort' vegan food. Bakery was a bit bleak to non-existent when we stopped by during mid-brunch.

They are very friendly and also direct in letting you know how their establishment works.  They weren't real busy, although since we were waiting for one person, the chef did warn us that if they became busier it could take much longer for our food because they cook every order as it is ordered.  I expect if they are busy, it could be a longer wait than other places.  If you anticipate that I don't think you'll be disappointed in this place.

They went over the menus with us because it was a little confusing.  Because of the way they source their ingredients, some items are not always available and they have different specials each day.  We figured it out without much trouble, although it did seem a little overwhelming at first.

The food was amazing.  I'm not vegan, although I eat meatless frequently.  The flavors Chef Mayra creates are wonderful.  She had chili that day, which she mentioned was very spicy so she brought samples first.  I love spicy and didn't think it was too much so.  I had a bowl of it & split a wrap with one of my friends.  I don't remember what it was calls...  something with Love.  It was very good! I also tasted the Latin something or other ""wrap"", which was more quesodilla style (I think because she had the gluten-free version with a rice tortilla)...  that was AMAZING!

I'll be back.  It was great.  Just go in knowing it might take longer for lunch than a chain that wants to herd you in and out.",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,0,0,5,1PzjWLlFpOMpFL6kGMTybA

They adopt animals and are environmentally correct. She doesn't use any animal products in her cooking. I know whoever eats there will have an awakening and lively reality that eating without animal products is the way to go. Eat to live, not live to eat. Animal products cause cancer and numerous other ailments. Remove these products and you'll feel amazing. Now, back to Pura Vida...I haven't had better food anywhere. The flavors she is able to develop are unmatched and inventive. I ate there on July 2nd, twice! I had a berry kisses smoothie, chili cheese potatoes, and the latin'tude. Beautiful presentation and out of this world flavors. I hope she opens a restaurant in Los Angeles, until then, I'll go to Vegas just for the deliciousness.

Being that I'm vegan and she's not, it was important to her that I felt accomodated while I was there- and let me tell you she loved this place as much as I did! In the course of 9 days, we ate here 3 times!

I still salivate over the Sunday brunch chocolate waffle I practically licked the plate of and also the short stack of chocolate pancakes- both of which completely hit the spot for my craving of real breakfast food. While initially the service was slow, the waitress was super friendly and the place was packed (everytime we were there). My friend enjoyed the McNeil bagel with Daiya cheese a little too much but when I  finally ate it, I too understood why she wouldn't stop talk ing about it.

Chef Myra is involved in every aspect of the resturant from start to finish and is super chatty with the customers. I can't wait to go back to see my best friend but most importantly to eat here!!!

If you are in a hurry or expect a high end decor, then go to the Wynn. If you want great food in big portions come here. Our breakfast at the Wynn Tableau restaurant cost us twice as much as here. It was good and the portions were smaller but for food, I pick here.

743217,2013-05-13,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Groupon users - BEWARE!!

First of all, we were visiting Vegas for the weekend and tried to plan ahead with Groupon meals.   On Saturday, we tried Pura Vida at 10am.  Pura Vida WOULD NOT take the Groupon because of the ""Holiday Weekend"" exception.  The Holiday in question - Mother's Day weekend.  The Chef came to our table, flopped down her laminated groupon to discuss the ""fineprint.""  She told us that Mother's Day weekend is HUGE and that she absolutely could not honor the Groupon.  I love my mother and fully support honoring all mother's every day and especially on a particular Sunday in May, but I never ever thought that a ""holiday exception"" would include Mother's Day.

She then REFUSED to honor the face value of the Groupon.  Flat out refused.   She did instead go around to the 3 other tables (the place was half empty) and try and sell our Groupon to the other customers.  It was extremely awkward and unsuccessful.  The golden rule of Groupon, generally, is that the merchant will accept face-value.  Not this place.  She actually laughed at us at the suggestion.

We did stay for the food - which did take the 30 minutes + that our server warned us it would take.  The menu was a joke.  Actually, menus.  Lots of exceptions, restrictions and prices covered over with tape.  

The LATIN-Tude was exquisite.  Simply wonderfully delicious, satisfying and enormous.  But not worth the $11.  The small cup of coffee was $4 (outrageous).

The empanadas were tasty.  The chili was also tasty but not exceptional.   Lots of beans, as you typically find with a vegan chili.  Not worth the $14

So, yes the food was delicious.  The experience was horrible.

After all of the fuss and nonsense and rudeness and lack of professionalism over the Groupon, the service was poor.  The server did tell us that he was new.  He was polite and attentive until the food came.  Then he basically disappeared.

The Chef came to our table several times in a loud fussy manner, almost daring us to not compliment the food.

When it came time for the bill, we had to wait over 10 minutes.  This is while there are a total of 3!! other tables.  The place is tiny, dingy, and sad.  The Chef was sitting down eating and couldn't be bothered with our bill either.  When the ridiculously expensive bill did arrive it was  - $37!! 

I understand that a vegan organic item can cost a dollar or two more, but this was beyond ridiculous.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall, in an industrial area.  Why pay that much for this place?  I have been vegetarian for many years and nothing at this place justifies the prices.

Poor poor poor management.  No professionalism.  Wonderful food.  Ridiculous prices.  Dismal location and service.  Overall, Absolutely NOT WORTH IT.",FQY7TjCaeywOp1jsZcPKMg,1,0,2,RT7d0rzdeHBdbVp4rK2n_Q
780896,2013-05-01,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"My friend and I came here for the first (and probably last) time because I saw a groupon and thought it would be cool to try some Vegan food.  The place is very small and almost looks like it's from a movie taking place in old Mexico, from the outside, but that's beside the point.  We entered with open minds.  Upon seeing the inside of the restaurant we noticed the entire place had about 10 tables, most of which were 2-tops, and I wondered why a reservation was required.  A woman at the register seated us with no mention of  a reservation, so I didn't worry about it.
While we were looking over the menu, this very tall, overbearing Latin woman in chef-type attire came to the table next to us with a man dressed also as a chef.  It took a minute for me to realize that she was the owner/head chef reprimanding the other chef for his portion size using the 2 customers as living examples, IN FRONT OF the customers, WHILE they were eating the food!!! Very strange and uncomfortable for the customers, and unprofessional in general.
I ordered a wrap that said it should come with either chili or a side salad or soup but was told there is no soup so I was instead offered a fruit salad.  This came first and although the variety of fruits on top and the portion size looked very good, I soon realized that all the apple slices at the bottom were bitter from aging.  So I left the whole bottom of the fruit plate untouched.
After about 40 min. from ordering, and watching the head chef woman walk around all over the place but not in the kitchen, we asked the server if the food was almost ready.  She THEN explained that due to ""macro cooking"" processes, they cook at a super low heat and it takes longer than a regular restaurant.  Would have appreciated knowing that BEFORE we ordered.  Maybe we would have gotten a quick  appetizer or something.  Anyway, a few minutes later our entrees finally came out.  My wrap ended up looking different than I expected, with the ""tomato slices"" being 2 tiny pcs of tomato as a garnish, rather than inside my wrap as the description made it sound.  But it tasted good and I was hungry so that was fine.
My friend had ordered basically a veggie sandwich with garlic and peppers.  What she got was a glorified grilled cheese sandwich.  We brought it up to the server who seemed confused and went to the kitchen to verify what she had told them.  Then she went to the chef to ask.  (Why didn't one of the only 2 servers in the place know what the menu item was supposed to consist of?)  Then the chef comes over and proceeds to give a laundry list of excuses as to why the food was WAAAAAY different than described in the menu.  She says there's a disclaimer at the bottom that we missed stating something about chef changing menu items as she sees fit, that she hadn't been happy with the integrity of the sandwich as it was or something, that she had a new baker whose bread was now 2x the size so we got a great value, that the sandwich actually does have tomatoes as promised (though they were just 2 little slices on the side), that my friend was confused and should've ordered a different item if that's what she wanted.  Then, after forcing excuses on us in her overbearing way, for like 5 minutes, she asks ""but is everything good?  Does it all taste ok?"".  It was so awkward.  So my friend and I both said everything was fine to get this very tall, overpowering woman away from us.  
Both of us agreed the food tasted just fine, but was misrepresented.  I think if nothing else had been different, at least the simple paper menus in plastic sleeves could've been retyped to reflect that certain menu items were COMPLETELY different than described.  The customer service by chef/owner woman was terrible, and by the servers was just ok.  I feel that the people here put out the minimum amt of effort possible until you ask questions (that you dont' know you should have to ask) and then when an issue comes up, it's like it's the customer's fault.  No apology or discount was offered to rectify my friend's meal.  So we will probably never go back and spread this info to everyone we know who may be interested in Vegan food.  I'm sure there are other better places out here in Vegas.",z30l6lrUl5htn6Br4Cmd4g,3,1,1,9v-Z9hnOlgK9oQmPBrlyIg

Chef Myra you should be ashamed of yourself and Pura Vida. You need to take responsibility as an owner and listen to your patrons complaints or CLOSE!!! 

Dining room: hot, stuffy, smelly, dirty, dingy, ugly, sad, depressing!! 

Staff: annoying, bothersome, engages with customers too often, most importantly INCOMPETENT on every level. 

Food: low quality, cooked to death, sloppy presentation, or shall I say thrown on your plate. Servings are very large and one note, comes with INEDIBLE, UNNECESSARY, Hard fried potato swirl, how are you suppose to chew on that? LARGELY chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and non organic chips. Is that why the cost is so high? IF SO PLEASE LEAVE THESE ITEMS OUT NO ONE EATS THEM THEY ARE NOT PLEASANT AND FOR GODS SAKE LISTEN TO YOUR PATRONS.

Hey aren't you some Sort of health conscious vegan, don't you know ACRYLIC NAILS ARE TOXIC ESPECIALLY WHEN PREPARING FOOD!!!! Her coolers are made
From jarred ""juices"" and Nectars, nothing special about that. Water comes from
A big Plastic Jug of ""drinking water"" aka questionable tap water. I've also seen non organic packaged food In the back while looking at deserts, I wonder what is organic in this place ?

I called for take-out and got ""Tha Frenchie"" while my friend got the ""Pura Vida Empanadas"", it was so good (my food and what my friend ordered..

In addition to delicious food, the customer service is fabulous and the lady who took my order, Sande, was great, she gave me the eta of my food and called when it was done early.

Saturday: I had 'The Latin'Tude"" breakfast burrito and my husband had ""My Love"". We were barely able to finish everything! It was a very wonderful and savory breakfast. I also had an iced coffee (i forget what it was called, but just regular, no flavor) and it was delicious. We split a Chocolate Banana Dream smoothie with almond milk. I was then rolled out the door. 

Sunday: I had ""Tha' Waffle"" and it was a monster waffle covered in gorgeous fresh berries and served with a very tasty maple syrup on the side. My husband cant remember what he had, but it had the name ""George"" in it and was also offered gluten free (although he didn't have it gluten free). Had another Chocolate Banana Dream. 

Both days, Chef Mayra came around the dining room and checked on everyone and talked with us. I rarely get that in any restaurant.

The multiple disorganized menus are a mess, and if it's your first time there they have a long speech about the entire thing.

I have been coming to this place since it opened and have watched the chef gradually become a stressed out rude diva which the waitresses are clearly stressed and irritated with. The waitresses seem like they want to sit down and join you, so forget a quiet brunch. I have watched many patrons endure the manic environment for the food.

I wanted to so bad to like this place, I am all about supporting the vegan community and when we planned our Vegas vacation and found out about this place I was very excited!  We drove here this past Sunday morning, was surprised about the location but didn't bother me, as long as I got to eat good vegan food.  When I arrived I saw that a friend of mine was also at the restaurant with a party of about 8 people, I walked over and said hi and my friend informed me they had already been waiting over an hour for their food.  Slightly concerned I  sat down to wait for our server at our own table.  The server was very friendly and brought us juice samples and began explaining the menu.

Ooooh the menu...  This is the first problem with this restaurant.  When the server started explaining the menu I cringed... hasn't the owner of this restaurant ever seen Hell's Kitchen?!  lol.  It's too complicated!!  There are too many options, too many combinations of different ways you can order the same thing and frankly it's confusing.  When it comes to a restaurant menu the best way to go is KISS, a few fresh things which are made really well and are not to complicated to get in and out of the kitchen.     We both ended up ordering a lunch or brunch combo with some wraps and a salad and each got a juice.  It took the server a good 10 minutes just to explain the menu to us.

The juice came quite quickly so I was happy.   About 15 mins later we were brought our salad dressing, no salad just dressing.  30 minutes later (a total of 45 minutes later) we were finally brought our salads.  The salads were not some fancy mix, just lettuce with maybe some shaved carrots, and this took 45 minutes?  At this point my friends in the other party were STILL waiting for their food.  It had now been over 2 hours for them and no one had apologized, brought them something to nom on, NOTHING!  I told my boyfriend then and there, we are canceling our order.  I could see the tickets on the window and they had not even started preparing ours yet.

We went up and paid for our 2 salads and 2 juices and they charged us $12.97!!  They didn't apologize for the wait, explain anything and how in the hell does a bit of lettuce and 2 juices cost $12.97.

I have heard the food is good here, but I can not recommend it.  They need to re-do their menu to simplify and offer dishes that are easy enough for the kitchen to prepare to get in and out in less then an hour to service their 8 tables or however many they had.  

Vegan or no vegan, as long as they make their customers wait 2 hours for food, people will not be coming back!",ybzuQcB4JVI05qgxW2gCDg,6,1,1,mpnAw_aDAV-ZvAza_B6prw

My chai latte came out almost entirely soy milk with no spice or sweetness.  I usually don't like to make a fuss about things like that, but it was really icky to me so I asked for a new one.  They were really friendly and brought another one out along with a side of extra chai in case I wanted it spicier.  It still wasn't sweet and tasty, but maybe that's just their style?

I was told the menu was limited because they were about to close. 40 minutes before closing? The sign on the door says last call is at 1:45. So right away I was annoyed. 

The waitress further explains to me that I should have made a reservation. I told her it said no where that I needed to make a reservation to come to ensure that I am served a full menu. 

She then explains to us after ordering that the chef has 8 orders before ours and its going to take awhile. 


I asked about the gluten free menu, was told that ""it takes longer to make, so if you really do have the allergy, we'll make it"" I'm not sure how Chef Mayra would feel about how the waitress was relaying these messages, but I just felt extremely annoyed.

I really didn't want it to come to this because well, as a vegan there are very few places I can go to eat, but after disappointment after disappointment I'm sorry to say I will not be coming back to Pura Vida any time soon. This was my letter to Chef Mayra after the Titanic x Hindenburg disaster that was their Valentine's Day dinner. 

""I hate to say it but I am livid and a bit appalled after tonight's Valentine's dinner. We paid $75 for 15 courses; you gave up after 12, and a couple of the courses were thrown & plated together last minute instead of being the separate courses they were advertised as. When you pay for something, you should receive it. Not only were we denied the extra courses, but it took forever to get them - you asked us to come early and that dinner would be served 6-9 PM; the first course wasn't even served until 6:40 PM. We left at 10 PM (we had plans at 9:30 - oh well!) confused as to where the rest of the courses were. There was very little explanation or communication and definitely poor planning. As a vegan I was excited for this opportunity and have eaten at your establishment many times, as well as referred you to others, but this will most likely be my last time. My husband really wanted this year to be special, but it was a huge headache. If you do this next year I hope you severely edit the menu and the prices so everyone leaves satisfied and at the designated time. You knew how many people were coming well in advance and should have had a test run of some sort. The only semblance of apology came from your servers when the food was not being served in the beginning. My husband is now even complaining he's still hungry as we didn't eat earlier in the day to fit this event in! This is one of the worst of not the absolute worst restaurant experiences I have ever been privy to and I hope to never repeat this episode of Vegan Survivor ever again.""

I appreciate that everything is made ready-to-order, but when you're serving FIFTEEN courses to 40 guests who you asked to arrive early and did actually have a definitive ending time of 9 PM, you have to make sure it goes smoothly which it did not. My husband and I were starved for over an hour before the food started coming. We estimated our time of exit by how ""quickly"" the food was coming out and it should have ended past midnight! Completely awful. A bunch of people left (and I wish I were one of them), and I'm pretty sure every single person left unsatisfied. 

This establishment has absolutely 0 business acumen and it is going to hurt them. You don't even have to watch a couple episodes of Kitchen Nightmares to realize Pura Vida is doing it wrong. If you have to come out and explain every menu item as well as feel the need to put pictures of the food in the convoluted menu, as a diner you should run immediately. 

Now I was going to give Pura Vida the benefit of the doubt since they did email the patrons and offered the rest of the courses, we just had to email & give the time we're coming in. Which my husband did. And apparently he had to confirm back which was not explained whatsoever. So he is currently at Pura Vida waiting for them to make the final meal we will enjoy from there. 

I sincerely wish Chef Mayra luck (she's going to need it!) but I will not be back. 

P.S. To the servers - good luck, you were the best part of the place, always trying to make it work when you are as confused as the customer, and I hope she supplies plenty of aspirin for the hourly headaches you have to have from working there.",-fzk0slIjoFQD1eWjx1uWw,22,6,1,c6R692z5E1lGH0J9vfqhfg

1561715,2013-11-25,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Pura Vida Vegan Restaurant is a FIVE STAR restaurant with a FIVE STAR chef that will be understood only by FIVE STAR diners.

Let me explain ... 

Don't let the location and decor confuse you ... this restaurant is a high-end, gourmet establishment with substantive, complex recipes, execution and presentation by an extremely talented vegan chef; as talented as any of the big shot vegan chefs in Los Angeles or New York City.

So ... 

  5 star diners DO NOT bring in outside drinks from other places like Starbucks. It isn't appropriate.
  5 star diners DO NOT expect to receive freshly prepared and cooked gourmet food quickly.  This is not fast food.
  5 star diners DO NOT tell a chef of chef Myra's caliber how to cook her signature dishes. Pomegranate seeds, peppers, cucumbers, pepitas ... everything she uses ... is included for the dish to come out right according to the chef. Telling an artist like Myra how to cook her dishes is like telling a high-end wedding photographer now to do their job. You just don't do it.
  5 star diners understand that this isn't Burger King ... specials orders upset them. Let them cook for you.
  5 star diners understand that professional, high-end chefs are not willing to use out-of-season fruits and vegetables for their dishes. They don't taste right and they are more expensive. therefore, certain items aren't available during certain seasons.
  5 star diners DO NOT arrive at the restaurant 15 minutes before they close and when they're refused, get angry and write shitty Yelp! reviews. The food takes time to prepare.  Setting these limits enables the restaurant to keep the balance between caring for their guests and caring for their workers.
  5 star diners expect to pay good money for good food.

Pura Vida is not Dennys. They aren't corporate. They can't afford to hire busboys and prep chefs and pay rent for a fancy building.  So everything is a little quirky. Only a quirky person would attempt to open a gourmet vegan restaurant to serve Las Vegas vegans healthy and delicious food. Restaurants are not generally highly profitable. Gourmet vegan restaurants that serve fresh organic food needs to be priced fairly and it is.

Before setting off to Pura Vida this morning, we read dozens of the Yelp! reviews, especially the ""bad"" ones. So we went there expecting to wait as long as it took for our food. We left our drinks in the car.  We discussed beforehand that we would trust the chef to deliver delicious food (even the reviewers who left bad reviews never criticized the food!) and that we wouldn't get offended by any quirkiness from the chef and / or server. We like quirky.  We are pretty quirky ourselves.

In the end, we had a fantastic time at Pura Vida. We enjoyed talking to Chef Myra and her server. They are sincere, wonderful, extremely hard-working people. We were there almost two hours trying several different dishes and drinks and talking and laughing.

We started with the chips and bean salsa ... incredibly tasty and plentiful!
My hazelnut coffee was delicious with soy milk. Refills were plentiful.
We ordered the ""My Love"" burritos/wraps with Chipotle cream and hot salsa ... OMG.
We ordered the Sandwich Break with all sorts of incredible fillings inside ... a grand slam home run!
We ordered the empanadas ... well ... there are no words for this amazing dish. They were out of this world.
We ordered the Peanut Butter short stack. This was a rich, delicious meal that was special indeed.
We sampled some of the agua frescas and ordered two, but they never came out and we were not charged for them.
They treated us to an incredible chocolate donut that was very sophisticated. It tasted like very lightly unsweetened cacao chocolate that was impressive.

The portions were ample.  The presentations were stunning (see my eleven photos)

So go.  Go to Pura Vida when you're not in a hurry.  Go there and relax and trust a world-class chef to impress you and treat you to special food that is animal free, cruelty free and tastes like LOVE.

Pura Vida is about Pura Amor.

Pure Life.  Pure Love.

Enjoy it.  Support it.

We will be back.",ncxAgG2xFSC_WItpLex5jA,2,2,5,WefqB72XJ1F82kp-PrTp5w

1707188,2012-12-21,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"What a unique cafe...

Unless you've been here before, you don't know why. But it's true. Unique is the best word to describe it. So here's the rundown:

- 100% vegan (animal-free)
- 100% cruelty-free kitchen
- All gluten-free options are prepared separately in their gluten-free kitchen area. So awesome!!!
- GMO free, organic, & fair trade whenever available 

I know you meat-lovers & non-vegans out there are thinking. How can this food be delicious? It is. Trust me. In my quest for better health & attempt to be vegan (ok, I'm probably vegan 95% of the time, I can't lay off dairy! Err!) I am saddened by the fact that Pura Vida is not in my neighborhood. Far from it, but I still attempt to come whenever I can.

What's on their menu? Waffles, French toast, pancakes, scrambles. Their newest items this week: PB + Banana + Chocolate + Raspberry Mini Pancakes. Or Cinnamon Walnut French Toast. In the mood for lunch? You can have sandwiches, quesadillas, create-your-own wraps, chili, & empanadas. They make daily bakery items, chocolate cakes, muffins, etc. I tried their chili, empanadas, & one of their gluten-free Latin'tude (posted pics). Yum :)

Pros:

Service - incredible. Their servers are very knowledgeable about the menu & will try to accommodate any dietary requests or allergies. Very friendly & helpful.

Yumminess - I love the efforts they make to provide great tasting food, using organic whenever possible. They prove that you don't need to eat any animal products to have a fulfilling meal. 

Portions - huge! Took home leftovers every time!

Cons:

Location - not the most convenient wholesome neighborhood. I think Cheetah's is right down the street. I'm glad I'm here during daylight hours.

Timeliness - this isn't fast food. It's good wholesome food made to order. They ask customers to give them 40 minutes for take-out orders, and it seems to be the same when you eat there. That's why they urge you to call in ahead of time. You could even call a day before (I can imagine most people can't plan that well like me, but I love that they offer the option) They will reserve a seat for you if you give them notice. They did for me, table for one.

Price - good ingredients comes at a cost. Most complete meals are $11-18. I'm more than happy to pay for quality, but I understand some people want to spend less on breakfast or lunch. The portions are well worth your money, in my opinion. One dish has always lasted me for two sittings or more. And I don't know about you, but knowing you're eating a great healthy meal, feeling good about what you ate is worth the extra dollars. 

Consistency - availability changes daily. So do the specials. The gluten-free chocolate cake you got one day is not there the next time you visit. Bakery items sell out fast. They've informed me though that anything can be available if you call. You want vegan pumpkin pie? I called a couple days before Thanksgiving & they made it. Plus, she'll prepare it to any dietary specifications you want.

Possibly the meanest thing I can say about a local business in this city. I'm counting the days till this place goes out of business...and it will, here's why;
- Disorganized; menu, kitchen, and staff.
- Poor customer service.
- Consistently poor customer experiences (Most of the 1 star reviews are consistent and accurate, I should have read them before)
- Overpriced specialty menu.

These people obviously have ZERO clue how to run a kitchen or a business. I don't know if they are out back harvesting the wheat and soybeans for their tofu but seriously, I could have birthed, raised, slaughtered, and cooked a cow in the time it takes them to make a goddamn waffle!

We (2 of us) were the 3rd table sat. NO ONE had food. The other two tables had already placed their orders. We placed our order on what appeared to be a menu designed by epileptic 9 yr old with a sever case of Aspergers syndrome (note: As someone w/epilepsy, I find this menu design  VERY insulting).  We attempt to order Tha' Waffle and their  insanely overpriced breakfast burrito. 15 mins later 4th table fills, then eventual the remaining tables slowly fill.  25 mins later the 4th table gets all their food. The 3 original tables are still without. Some polite banter between us the waitress to see what the hold up is and never a clear response.

The waitresses are now telling people who are slowly filing in that there is an hour wait and that, ""we're closing at 2:00...that will only leave 15 mins, so don't bother waiting."" (yes, this is an actual quote)  ""They all just came at once"" (which is total bullshit, I've been sitting here for over an hour.) At this point it had been an hour SINCE we placed our order. We walked out 

Went up the street to Omelet house. We were seated, orders placed, and served in 20 mins and spent $20. If I had actually paid for what we order, bill would have been about $32.

We had the bean dip w nachos, cupcakes, empanadas, waffles, cinnamon raisin french toast, poblano salad, tofu eggs, and more (I can't recall the exact name of everything, there was a lot). And ALL of it was delicious. 

A word of warning: Chef Mayra's ""Signature Dishes"" (there are a few on the menu) are just that, her ""signature"" dish -- she will not make changes to it. But don't worry, after ordering two of these dishes we understood why, they are great!  

Plus, when things slowed down I got a chance to meet and speak with Chef Mayra. She explained to me about how she got started (she was always a chef), gave me some cooking pointers, and encouraged my love of vegan-ism. I left this place feeling inspired. IMO, Pura Vida is worth checking out. Enjoy!",sdNJ_WQzxpG6P6LkfFdJFg,2,0,5,I8tB7cwykD2kcwo3--_peg
1844067,2011-09-27,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Hallelujah, a vegan brunch place in Vegas!!!  

They're still pretty new and working out the kinks, but overall, the food was amazing and service even better.  The chef came to personally welcome us and chatted for a few (I love this new trend with start-up restaurants).  My mom and I had the WOW tofu scramble, and my dad had the waffle with strawberries inside.  For non-vegans, my parents were impressed, so that says a lot.  I would LOVE to see this business thrive.  For them, and my own selfish reasons, because it's the only vegan brunch spot I've noticed in the 2 years or so I've frequented Vegas.

DO ORDER the APPLE CHEESE FRITTERS.  OMG wow.  I brought one home and heated it up later in the day, and I'm already craving more.  The choc chip cookies are perfect, too, so soft and chewy.

There was no waiting, and we arrived around 11am on Sunday.

Some improvements I'd like to see - 

- a thorough menu that I could hold at my seat.  We had to decide what to eat outside in the scorching heat, then go inside to order.  Also, some of the menu items were vague, and hard to know what you'd actually get.

- a less spicy, more savory tofu scramble.  The spice was a little shocking when we weren't expecting it.  Tough on a morning tummy.

- better quality seating & tables, three of us had to squish onto a little table, and the chairs were tiny, kind of like elementary school seats.

I'll be back soon, and hopefully my next review will get that fifth star :)",ACgEltoQKn4B0n9hLzYg4Q,4,2,4,P6zJs_rcFIPowo3_91NDiA

Vegas needs more places like this however when it came down to the food. It just wasn't healthy and more importantly Its taste was edible but nothing special. 

Its like a place for vegan newbies or something. I'm not even vegan but I am very much in to health food (unless its phenomenal tasting unhealthy food, haha. )

Anyway massive portion of starch, pasta, potatoes, bread ect. The salad I got only had balsamic vinegar as a dressing, not even balsamic reduction.

People need to realize that this is not a fast food restaurant but a sit down joint with food that is fresh, flavorful and personally prepared with extreme care and love. The staff was extremely kind, fun and welcoming. They took all care to make sure we were comfortable and happy, giving free small samples of their drinks and just conversing with the customers. The restaurant is also extremely clean and well laid out with lots of vegan friendly decor including photos of adopted turkeys from Farm Sanctuary, vegan pamphlets from Vegan Outreach, magazines and more. The food also did not disappoint. My husband and friend got the quesadilla which showed up on a massive plate, piled high and truly a Mexican lovers delight. I ordered the eggless salad sandwich and that also did not disappoint. It was loaded with veggies and stacked really high and came with an amazing fruit salad and drink.

This is where locals eat, and we don't want to be on the strip dealing with tourists, so having this little place tucked on Western is perfect!

I really love the Latin 'Tude burrito. It's so savory and sort of spicy, and surprisingly meaty tasting. I also really like the empanadas. 
If someone is thinking of venturing into vegan cuisine, I recommend that you give this place a shot. I think you will be surprised at how meatless eating can be delicious!

This place is small and super casual, and the wait staff is very nice, but often seem stressed out. They get really busy during lunch, especially on the weekends, and that may be the reason why. But they are never rude.

I prefer to order to take out because it takes a long time to get your food. I've waited as long as 30 minutes to get my order because everything is prepared fresh, but there has to be some way to streamline this process. It just takes too long. That is my only complaint: the wait time.

I am not vegan but I wanted to try PV because I adore Chef Mayra. I interviewed her for The Sausage Factory and my friend Derek was on her cooking show.

The restaurant is in an odd place, but close enough to my downtown office to stop by. Hopefully in the near future they'll be able to deliver because that wait for take out was LOOOOONG, despite not being busy, at all. 

I ordered the The Latin'Tude which was delicious but extremely over-priced at $10.99 and Almond Banana Smooth which was also very delicious but very expensive ($5.95) for just 16oz of smoothie.

After reading some of the reviews here I look forward to going back in the very near future. It's very rare that you find vegan or vegetarian food that satisfies your craving for ethnic flavors and Chef Mayra does a great job of making healthy food that is packed full of wonderful flavor!

2265668,2012-04-11,5,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"The only good thing about this restaurant is that it's in an industrial area with no other businesses nearby so parking is easy and plentiful, but as a restaurant...???!!!

first, the concept behind this place is great....they support local produce/farming and supplies. I can get behind that.   But as one of my close vegan friends told me, the biggest problem with the growing number of vegan restaurants is that they tend to be run by vegans but not by business people so they do not know how to properly run a restaurant and oftentimes feel like by just existing they are somehow doing you a favor.

Simply put, waiting 2+ hours for food is unnacceptable, especially when no one alerts you to any delays and food shortages they are experiencing.  And this restaurant is very small, inside holds less than 20 people and there are outside tables for another 8.  so at full capacity it holds less than 30 people and when we were there they were not at full.

The chef had a condescending attitude towards my friends who inquired politely where the food was, and tried to somehow pass off that it's normal to wait 2+ hours for your food??!! WTF?!!

Long story short, half of our party got our food, the other half did not while we were there.  The restaurant was finishing up 2 of the orders by the time we left so they packed it up and gave it to us for free, but the ironic thing is the one person who never got any food ordered the simplest easiest quickest thing to make on the menu. Pancakes!

Speaking of the menu, when the waitress comes and says she needs to explain it, you know you're in trouble.  No menu should require explanation, that means it's too convoluted and needlessly complicated.  Personally I didnt think it needed any explanation, tho it was quite large, and maybe they would  be better served editting it down to half the items, do them well, and get it out to the tables in a timely manner.

I felt bad for the waitress since she seemed frustrated too, BUT at the same time she is the liason between our table and the kitchen, so where was she in being proactive about getting our food prepared. Also in 2+ hours she NEVER refilled our waters.  Sure we could have asked for refills, but really, at that point we really shouldnt have to ask.

As for the food itself?  Nothing great going on.  We've had much better vegan food elsewhere that employed finesse and technique and managed to be full of flavour.  Our soup was very bland and needed a lot of salt to get it edible.  Our cheesy potatoes could have been good, but the potatoes were not cooked all way thru so a bit hard.  We must have literally gotten the last half of potato since our other friends who never got their meal was because of running out of potatoes.  Our quesadilla was ok, but the basic point of a quesadilla is tortilla and melted gooey cheese inside, anything else is an afterthought.  Almost no cheese, just a bunch of veggies stuffed into a tortilla.  The grilled cheese we got was really good tho.  The vegan cheese melts and has the same texture/taste as real cheese.  Sourdough bread really good.  But a grilled cheese sandwich shouldnt take 2 hours to serve.

Even my vegan friends in town know of this restaurant's reputation and said they could have told me not to bother with Pura Vida.  I'm not their prime demographic (not vegan or veg) but it's not doing them any service when the vegan community knows to stay away.",c9m7rg-JO-GT2CXifcaZ4A,8,4,1,AbG6r6_oONdBxYu7kSooUA
2318827,2013-01-08,2,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian or vegan. I love meat and I cannot deny my usual distaste for vegan eateries because of my experience with foods that lack of flavor and have strange textures. Having said that, the meal I had at Pure Vida today was one of the best and freshest lunches I have had in a long, long time!

I read through their menu and website prior to arriving, so I was well aware that everything is prepared fresh and can take 30-45 minutes to prepare. No problem for me, because I enjoy long and quiet lunches. When I walked in, Cindy directed me to a table and gave me an abundance of information as well as about 5 different menus that had specials and drinks and other specials and lunch and breakfast and dessert, etc. 

I immediately ordered a lime-mint blended essential oils water ($3: NOTE: they no longer offer free refills as of Jan 13, 2013). It is free of sugar and home made and unbelievably refreshing! For food, I settled on the lunch special (a little pricey at $14.99, but it came with so much food that I cannot complain at all!) and chose a salad with creamy garlic dressing and the ""My Love"" burrito. The ""salad"" was a GIGANTIC plate of fresh veggies including spinach, sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cucumber, etc. and the dressing came on the side, which was great. 

About 20 minutes later (it wasn't very crowded), my burrito was served: sun dried tomatoes, cuban black beans, vegan cheese, spinach, roasted garlic potatoes, avocado, chipotle peppers. Let me tell you, it was one of the best burritos I have ever had (AND I LOVE MEAT, AND IT CONTAINED NO MEAT!). There was a little kick to it, but nothing that made my mouth burn or detracted from the wonderful flavors of the fresh veggies and toasted tortilla. 

If you aren't a vegetarian or vegan, who cares? Support this little gem because it supports chemical free, organic, healthy dining options that do NOT skimp in flavor or portion size. Absolutely wonderful. The ambiance is also very relaxing and peaceful. Cindy, my waitress, was extremely helpful and friendly and made me feel like we were old friends. She even gave me a sample of one of their apple cookies and made some recommendations for my next visit (which will likely be tomorrow, lol).

I regularly order a Mocha-Con-No-Leche (always an excellent choice!) to begin with, I highly recommend it. Very different from any other mocha I have ever had, definitely a great, unique taste.

I also recommend the short stack; the pancakes are delicious. They have a bit of a 'spiced' taste (which grew to my liking). Or if you're in the mood for something else, their soups are absolutely scrumptious, fresh, and healthy.

And I had the My Love burrito ---- really delicious. Mr. L had the Latin'tude, and while it was good, neither of us like it as much as My Love. The flavors they're able to get from no butter, no bacon, and no cheese (I can't believe I'm even saying it) are just incredible.

I finally went with friends this Sunday to check it out. We stood for 15 min waiting for a table. The restaurant seemed to be very understaffed, as they only had one waitress and they were out of many things on the menu.

When we finally did get to order, they seemed to be out of things so I said that I'd take a waffle or pancake just to try anything. We received comolimentary chips and salsa since we were waiting so long,
At this point we were starving and couldnt take it anymore! After being there almost 2 hours we left.

2907080,2011-11-30,2,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"If you're on the hunt for a new favorite restaurant, look no further. Within the heart of the Las Vegas Valley, nestled between long forgotten buildings, rests a sunny yellow restaurant by the name of Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro. The name literally means pure life, or plenty of life, which is appropriate as this restaurant uses all-natural ingredients and serves 100% vegan cuisine. But what really matters is how the food actually tastes, and trust me, you will not leave disappointed. From Sexy Pancakes with fresh fruit, to Jambalaya and Cuban Puff Pastries, there's something for everyone here. Pura Vida offers a wide array of vegan specials daily which makes it affordable to eat great food on a budget, while staying healthy and mindful of the planet at the same time.

Not a vegan? Have no fear! For those that are not familiar with vegan cuisine there are sampler plates available with some of the most delicious items on the menu. You can tell that every dish is made with your health in mind so you won't have to shy away from foods you normally lust after at conventional restaurants. The vegan substitutes for dairy and meat-based products used at Pura Vida are exemplary. Some would say even better than the real thing! 

The restaurant is not large by any means, but that only adds to the charm and warmth of the place, giving it a small town café sort of atmosphere. The servers are incredibly welcoming and more than happy to answer any questions you may have about the menu, and Chef Mayra comes out to greet you to make sure you're enjoying the food she's especially handcrafted for you. Regardless of your dietary restrictions, or lack thereof, I'm sure you'll find yourself head-over-heels for the compassionate cuisine and homey atmosphere served up daily at Pura Vida Bakery & Bystro!",MYAI5Hx5Zj2ixBHy9j1wDg,5,2,5,UbWGeyFMfr1hO5HVGVG3hA

2983357,2012-04-08,2,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"First of all I am really sorry to be giving anything but 5 stars to a place that I was so excited about coming to - so excited that I told 9 friends who visited the place also. We searched for vegan places to eat in Las Vegas. The pluses are that I wanted to eat yummy and healthy food when I was hungry and that this place supports important things. For that I am thankful we went there.

However, we met with our friends at 12 noon, and we ordered by 12:15. They very nicely gave us samplers of two different teas and we chose one. The drinks were brought out - followed by waters eventually. 

Then we started chatting and chatting and chatting.... until I realised it was 1:30!
... One of our friends asked where our food was and the only answer was that there was an order placed before us. Meanwhile, a couple who came in after us got their food, and another couple left after complaining their order took too long.

Then I started to feel edgy, hungry and annoyed. During the entire time we were there NO ONE came over to apologise or recognise the problem, no one filled up our now well-finished drinks or waters, no one brought a complimentary basket of chips or bread to compensate for 7 hungry people wondering where their food was.

At 1:45 we started to get seriously annoyed! No sign of food coming out. At 2pm : *almost TWO HOURS AFTER ORDERING* I got mad and went to ask where our food was. There was no answer. One dish of cheesy potatoes came out to one of our friends. Fifteen minutes later two more dishes came out to another friend. Our friends finished their meal. 

I finally got up and asked what on earth was happening. The chef came out and I said it wasnt very nice that no one even came over to us to acknowledge the long wait. At first, she tried explaining the demand today was too high (but not all tables were taken) and she eventually apologised for the wait, and I told her I appreciated that apology, but then she explained said: 
""Well I didnt even want to open up today, ok?!""

HOW IS THAT A REASON FOR MAKING PEOPLE WAIT OVER TWO HOURS FOR FOOD?????????????????????

So I responded (had been nice until now) : ""I have never been to a restaurant and been made to wait over two hours for food!"". 
She responded: ""Really?""

??????????????????

I said ""This is crazy"". She responded ""Well we ran out of potatoes!""

??????????????????

It was like being in a surreal movie. How do potatoes affect my friend's simple short stack pancake order? He never got his pancakes!!!! Why did no one come tell us there was a problem? 

After over 2 hours of waiting for his pancakes, my friend asked if they had STARTED to make them, and the answer was no..... completely unacceptable.
He canceled his order. 

I asked about our two simple veggie burritos and they said they had just started them. After ten minutes and a grand total of 
TWO HOURS AND TWENTY MINUTES of waiting, I finally said enough and told them to cancel the order. We still paid for our drinks.

As we were leaving they gave us our burritos free of charge which was at least a nice gesture. But by now I was already starving when I showed up, I was shaking from hunger and had to drive, it was the worst experience I have had in a restaurant.

The waitresses were nice and we didnt blame them for the issue, and to be fair the food was very good (burrito in green (Spinach?) tortilla was bland but the wheat tortilla with cauliflower was really good).

What a shame a great idea like this and wonderful food was COMPLETELY let down by a complete lack of business sense.

Get staff rules about refilling drinks, offering free chips or bread (to keep hunger at bay if you know you are slow) and touch base with your diners. There is no point having compassion for animals, if you do not extend that compassion to your fellow human animals.  I had even hoped my meat eating friend might discover vegan meals can be yummy too, but he never got his food in 2 hours and 20 minutes to try it for himself (pancakes? 2.5 hours??). And he did get a negative experience to turn him off ever trying again.

I was going to give this 2 stars based solely on the free food we eventually were given, but since we were angry, hungry and heading out the door, I can't justify it.

I almost only bother to review places I love, and I so wish this had been one of them. Great concept, but get some professional business advice, so your vision can come to life. In the process, you might avoid alienating the people who would otherwise be fans.",lzEsdxzTcGkISelYG4cAOA,10,4,1,wT4OSf9BZgZeTwrSYD0iSA

- Read a few books on the subject of restaurant ownership

- Grow an entire crop of fruits and vegetables

- Get a restaurant business license
- Get a small business loan and lease a suitable property
- Grow a full, luxurious beard

I had a lunch reservation at 1:45. At 2:30 they called me up to tell me that they could not have my food ready until 3:15. I ordered a quesadilla and some soup, not The Great Pyramids of Egypt.

3275939,2013-12-02,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Came here for lunch on Thanksgiving eve about an hour before they were to close.

The chef (who we did not know at that time) told us right when we walked in that there was a limited menu and our server would let us know what. We ordered only to have the chef come out and insist that we needed to get the pastry puff. She sold it well so we agreed.

The food was excellent! Beautiful flavors and made well. Here's what we had:
1. Chili + empanadas
2. Burrito
3. Pastry dish
4. Raspberry lemonade

Because we agreed to order one extra dish we had not planned to but believed her about the goodness of the dish we ended up having to take home so much food and had no room for dessert. Everything tasted great though.

We had plans to visit another place for dessert but chef Mayra was very ""hard sell"" about having dessert or buying a pie. I would agree with reviewer Molly from Berkeley. She needs to chill and let her food do the talking. One chef visit was good, coming back a second time was overkill. Suggestion: They should have a ""chef's favorites"" or ""chef's recommendations"" listed so diners know what food to order rather than have the chef come out.

Would recommend this place for the food and service but the chef visits needs to be toned down to make it a more un-coerced dining experience.",_lSIWh5wZ2Vb_wHM47iIpw,4,0,3,RwmxfV3CHIQL7SxEWAn_4A

We visited early in a several-day decompression stopover after Burning Man 2011, and loved it so much that we had to come again on our way out of town.

When entering, you are faced with a cozy little mom and pop type of diner environment.  Janee, the serving staff, will greet you and right away tell you what is available today.  She is friendly, warm, and engaging.

There is no menu besides the two boards (specials and favorites), and the dessert case.  We had on our first visit a jace wrap, a quesadilla, and a pasta dish, all were excellent - deserving special notice is the bean salsa.  The limeade was great, too, and the ""Kangen Water"" (water with a lot of Eco-friendliness and balanced stuff).  And the desserts - brownies and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate syrup - were fantastic.  

Pro-tip: if you drink 3/4ths of a limeade and have Janee top it off with their apple water, the mix is fantastic!

On our second visit, we got waffles and ""two loves"" burritos.  The burritos were great - the waffles were great for vegan waffles, but I would not recommend them to omnivores (waffles are tough to do vegan, they really need that whipped egg white froth to form a light and airy structure).

Chef Mayra is enthusiastic about her food, and is passionate about making sure diners enjoy it.  Our first visit, we
were the only ones here (we came just before close - we did not realize it, and they did not pressure us at all, but we ended up leaving an hour after close), and she spent some time visiting with us. More impressive was our second time - even in the middle of the lunch hour rush, she made sure to visit with every patron.  She is really engaged with her business, and it is clearly her calling!

You do not have to be vegan to enjoy the food here - I am not (though my partner is).  If you have the time to go just a few miles from the strip, you owe it to yourself to try the food here!",FYjQm_BQRlQZRFto43FXsw,2,3,5,PFH8LQRAVlJPwbB8Pvm2Tg
3508532,2012-12-15,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"First I will say that the food was very good,  However I feel like this restaurant has some fundamental issues that need to be addressed.  

1.  I feel like the price is too high.  We paid $65(before tip) for 3 adults for breakfast, which I think is a bit high.  I get that it is a niche market so I can sort of forgive the price a little bit.  A basic cup of black coffee is $4 which seems pretty high to me.  I also did not appreciate the way that the waitress kept urging me to order additional food for my not even 2 year old who we generally share our plate with.  She kept urging us and saying I'm sure the baby would like this or want this and I didn't appreciate that at all.  The waitress urged all of us to order additional food and get things we didn't ask for.  

2.  We were the only ones eating at 10am and were told that food would be approximately 40 minutes to come out.  I don't have 2 hours to spend eating breakfast.  As I said before I have a 2 year old who simply can't sit still that long.   The  waitress was at least helpful in helping us choose items that might come out more quickly.  

3.The location is in an industrial area which is probably why they seem so desperate to sell you up on whatever you purchase.  There is absolutely no foot traffic in this area,  Perhaps if they had a better location they might do a little less upselling etc. 

I don't see my family returning any time soon,  If you have a couple hours to kill the food is great though.",6iXprsLxlX40_ee-5N7p6w,2,0,3,dg2mFQNMv9nKzpQoKzfxzg

The food was excellent and really an eye opener for how good vegan food can be, but the extremely confused staff / owner and inefficient service are serious problems they need to fix. The owner was super sweet and obviously knows her food, but not how to run a business. She wants to personally hand out menus and talk to customers before taking orders (which sounds really awesome and can be if they are not busy), but in practice she is so scattered brained that it took us 20 minutes to get menus and another 20 to order food. The waitress who took our order didn't seem to know much about the items and would randomly serve whatever table she fancied. Lots of other customers were also having bad service.

In fact the only person who looked like they knew what they were doing was a young man (teenage boy? maybe the owner's son?) who was really on top of things, but was not allowed to do anything that would help them move things faster. He could not give out menus or take orders even though he knew exactly what was going on and wanted to help.

3618236,2013-04-03,8,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"What tempted me to drag my babygirl onto The Deuce, then proceed to walk, nearly a mile to the ""wrong side of the tracks"" to eat brunch at Pura Vida? The fact it's the closest all Vegan restaurant to The Strip, is all it took to get me excited. I'm thankful my girl is a trooper because it was totally worth the walk.

Once we arrived starving & tired, the waitress informed us they may not be able to take our order, despite it being more than an hour before closing time. She was nice about it and once she realized we walked all the way there, she offered us water, a comfortable table outside, and told us she would try to fit us in. Ultimately it was up to the chef, who we later learned has a specific system for making each dish individually as it's ordered, so she knows how long each will take. 

We were eating with our eyes, so we ordered the huge combo plate to share, and a tuxedo waffle. There seemed to be confusion between the two waitresses and the chef, as to what she could make for us. She said if she picked our meal, that she could get our meal finished on time. If we picked, she probably couldn't. My sweetie was adamant that there be waffles & a scramble since that was mostly what we wanted and it appeared throughout the menu.

The waitress returned with a complimentary glass of the most delicious hibiscus concoction I've ever had. Sweet, yet not too sweet, with a hint of hibiscus and something else I was unable to distinguish. She also dropped off a bowl of chips and a curious looking chili that she referred to as black bean salsa. Either I was in a fit of ravenous hunger, or that black bean chili dip, was the best chili I've ever shoveled into my mouth. It was definitely the best part of the meal and pretty much a meal unto itself. At this point we weren't sure if they were just giving us a snack to tide us over, or was this the beginning of our chef-chosen meal?

She ended up making us a semi-combo plate that was half the size of what we originally ordered. Probably a good thing because any more food would've been way too much. The potatoes & tofu scramble were quite good. The only thing I wasn't feeling was the Tofurkey tasting ""sausage"". Especially since everything else here appears to be made from scratch. I also slathered what was left of the black bean salsa over everything on the combo plate. It was that good!

Neither of us are fans of chocolate pancakes or waffles, so when the waitress dropped off a large plate of chocolate covered waffles, we shot each other the ""WTF look"". One bite later, and I was a total convert. I ended up scarfing down the majority of the plate, it was so good without being overly sweet. Hell, I think I may have inadvertently eaten a fruit fly that mistakenly flew into my zone... ""Bad Vegan""!

The Empanadas are a must try with their flaky crust, generous amount of spiced filling, topped with a tasty cheezy sauce. It was even good when we ate the rest of it later at the airport. Even the pico de gallo was better than most restaurants around. You can tell lots of L O V E goes into preparing this food.

My only one real complaint other than general lack of organization, was the bill. I assumed the chili dip was comped since we didn't order it. It was an extra $10 but we didn't feel like arguing, and it was pretty damned good anyways. I guess we helped offset the rush of Groupon-ers that filled up the small diner. 

The tiny shack of a location might scare off anyone that has watched their fair share of horror movies. It appears bad things could happen on this side of town. However if you stick it out and try their food, you'll be amazed by the taste & presentation befitting anything you'll find on Las Vegas Blvd. The food is FIVE stars all the way! This was the culinary highlight of our visit. Just be sure you're not pressed for time or specific about what you want to order, and you'll be satisfied.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,13,11,4,qJiFT1v_ctsqafYZMRMc8Q

A FEW mins later the chef came out and caused a scene about how she is a small business owner and can't afford to give  out free food. explained we had called and would of cancelled groupons and we spent  Alot of money just to get here. she looked real hateful to waitess  i thought she may beat her. so i told chef it wasn't her fault. now Im angry because everyone is starring and Im not on welfare. my friend said we are going way over groupon.they spent over 30.00 over groupon making lunch for 2@ 50.00. no way is that free. menu... we 1st ordered frozen coffee drinks. it was out of service along with smoothies. ok. then i ordered Glutten free pancakes and was told i would have had to order those when i made reservations because it takes time for her to make batter. come on who knows a menu and preorders pancakes? i ordered Glutten free quesadillas
.they were ok but now Im totally upset about the whole situation and know  Im going to wait at least 45 mins for them. to the manager*... if you want your slum location holein the wall to make it... then step up your menu... have available what is on your menu(accommodate your patrons) and never come out and complain about your groupons that you offer. my sister sent my groupon to me as a gift, meaning you could buy a additional groupon.never treat your guests as they are welfare recipients. I've never been treated like that from any groupon. 50.00 for lunch is not free. 10 tables and you still can't make some batter. really?  reservations ha! i wished i would have took a picture to post for what this Bipolar chef is wanting reservations for. save your money and go somewhere else.

Random crap on the ways, pictures of turkeys, bad pics of what I presume is the chefs mom, and a weird slide show on a random monitor. Four or five really unorganized menus that are explained to every detail. Many items are unavailable or don't have all the ingredients. Food takes forever to get to the table and when it did it was cold. I got the tofu scramble which comes with cheesy potatoes, sausage, and random cucumbers.  I have never heard of cucumbers with food that is supposed to be hot. Anyway, as I said before the food arrived cold. The potatoes and sausage were cold and not to mention the sausage tasted like rubber. The hold plate looked like they just threw everything on the plate. No technique and no real concept of an actual meal.  

I could only manage a few bites until I had to tell the waitress that the food was cold and quite frankly, not very good. Before taking it back she mentions the window might have made it cold. This shit was cold when it arrived.  I've eaten vegan food plenty of times and this place is no where the other places I've been.  I eat at Native Foods in Southern California often. Their food has never been cold even when I'm actually outside.

But I digress, the chef comes out and makes some passive aggressive comment about the window.  Bitch it has nothing to do with the damn window.  She tells me,"" everyone else loves that meal. Next time I see your face I will make sure I cook your food at a 160 degrees and bring it right out to you."" She continues with excuses like I don't know shit about food. She says,"" we don't use a microwave and the food gets cold at the pass.""  A few minutes later she brings my girlfriend's food at and says some other bullshit as she sets it down,"" let me make sure it's out of the way of the window."" It's not the window!! You gave me cold ass food which was also disgusting. The food is all over the place. Well I know I will never be back. The food was shit and as soon as I let them know that I was served bad/cold food the service became bad as well.

I wish this place would was chosen for Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares. He is the only who could save that place.

I strongly advise against going there.

Down sides are the fake cheese, (not my preferred brand, not very melty, also i prefer to just skip the fake cheese and add tofutti sour cream for cheesey like things) and the limited menu,  We were quite surprised to find no tofu-scramble on the daily breakfast menu, HOWEVER the chef was very sweet and i get the feeling you could ask for anything and she'd make it.

3875136,2013-02-13,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I would love to give Pura Vida 5 stars but taking some issues into consideration that people would likely find important definitely knock it down a bit.  How much the rating should suffer would depend on your priorities.  I would give it 3.5 if possible because despite the issues, I still eat here.

First I would like to say that the food is excellent.  Chef Mayra does a wonderful job bringing a fully vegan menu with tons of flavor to Las Vegas.  The price is hefty but not when considering the quality of ingredients, freshness, and LARGE portion size.  I've had both breakfast and lunch here and neither disappoint.

This place has a wonderful concept of cruelty free dining but there are flaws in the execution.  The menus (yes, you may be given as many as 4 different ones) are confusing and it takes the wait staff an excessively long time to explain everything.  It also seems that Chef either cannot afford or does not allow anyone else to be doing cook/prep in the kitchen.  Meaning that even though the place is tiny, if it is full (which is likely at meal times) you could easily wait an hour+ for your food.  I have had smoothies and other drinks fail to be delivered because Chef was too busy.  If you can't trust anyone else on your staff to make a coffee drink then you either are way too controlling or you need a new staff.  ***Please watch a few episodes of Kitchen Nightmares and take the advise to heart!***

There is so much potential for greatness here.  I think with some consultation on how to more efficiently run things, I would be more than happy to award Pura Vida the full 5 stars.",QPbCUI6WokFgvBryLxgSkA,2,1,3,wafeOhz4YrnMJ2A5i7Q-3Q
3887896,2012-05-25,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I really want to give this place more stars but I just can't. My husband and I visited in April hoping for some delicious vegetarian vacation food. Well, I was hoping for veggie goodness, he's a happy carnivore so it can be difficult at times to find a place that we both like to eat at. 

First impression: The area is a bit dumpy, awkward to get to and has semi's rolling past. The place is TINY and hot inside so we sat outside to admire those awesome trucks rolling past. 

The service: Ummm, they need some serious work here. SLOW and unapologetic. (There were only 2 customers in the place at the time.) We were told to sit anywhere and it took the gal 10 minutes to bring us menus and water. Again, only one two-top in the place. As we were handed the menu it was explained to us. Nooooo. . .let me browse the selection to see what you offer! Let me ooohhh and ahhh over the yummy items. A restaurant really shouldn't have to explain how the menu ""works"" to the customers. It should be simple enough for a drunk to figure out. This IS Vegas after all. Sadly, I was NOT drunk while eating here.

The Food: We ordered beverages that took 20 minutes to arrive to our table. Then our salads took another 30 minutes. The salads were beautiful and interesting and the dressing was super yummy. (By this time, had I arrived drunk, I would have long sobered up. I was really wishing this place served booze about now.)  I think our food arrived about another 30-40 minutes after we had finished our salads.

I got the empanadas and my husband got some wrap type thingy. Or maybe it was the other way around. Both were AMAZING! Except for the eentsy teensy tiny bugs crawling out of the greens on my plate! ACK! I sucked it up, brushed them off and ate my food anyway - I was THAT hungry. I even had my Mr.'s leftovers late that night when I finally did get my drink on and he was ready to eat some meat type thing. The food was still good even after sitting in our hotel room for a few hours.

I really want to eat here again but I don't want to watch my vacation pass me by while waiting for food. I have Vegasy things to explore damnit! Felt like we were there 2 hours to have a quick lunch.

The food is amazing and the presentation beautiful! Complete detail placed upon every dish; each divine meal being its' own little piece of heavenly art. Even my carnivore friend loved the grub and discussed how Pura will be a regular stop on our weekly lunch outings.

I can only rate this cafe' as a 4 because all of the comments about: groupons, reservations, appetizers, abrupt chatter from staff, weird decor, limited menu, avocados and bananas are true. But as far as I'm concerned, the quality of the food outweighs the negativity.

The dining area could be spiffied up a bit and DON'T go there if you are in a rush. They REALLY need to get more kitchen help, a hostess and a more cohesive website. Although the server was sweet, she could only bring out the food as swiftly as it was prepared. Clearly Chef Myra is a perfectionist, but delegating to competent staff would really help to grow and solidify this business to a needy base of health-concious locals (who can't spend more than an hour and a half on a work day lunch hour). The time and reservation issues need to be resolved, as it is ridiculous to expect that patrons should wait that long, even if the food is amazing. 

The prices are very high, but the servings are large and oh so YUMMILICIOUS! Pura Vida is totally worth the money, but they need major improvement on the wait issue. Hopefully they will get that worked out before turning too many people off.",wB-ebDppZjl8nnpC3n184Q,2,0,4,uWCrizeVdpooSc4ZbKx9-g

There was obviously a lot of time put into the flavor profiles of the dishes and the flavors and textures are full of mouth watering goodness. I'm not a vegan, but I am Lacto-ovo vegetarian and I love the fact that there is a delicious vegan restaurant in my downtown area. Ok, so since the food is so good, the owner does not need any help with her food design, because its frickin' great, but they do need some serious help with the service and menu layout. The servers are nice, but not efficient. The menu design is horrible and very difficult to navigate. The efficiency and timing of the kitchen is horrible and be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour for entrees. I see this a lot in mom and pop local restaurants, great food, but they have no idea how to be efficient and create a dining experience that is as good as the food. I really hope that the owner pays attention to these reviews be because there is so much potential here. Let me give a specific example of the lack of efficiency with this place. They were on a wait because they were holding 4 tables for reservations. I'm fine with a little wait, but there was no reason for a wait. I watched 3 tables stay dirty for over 10 minutes while 3 parties waited to be seated. In the mean time, nobody was showing up for the reservations, so now there were 7 tables (almost half the restaurant) not being sat because 1)tables were not being bussed because if the lack of staff and 2) they were holding tables for people that were not there yet. What should have happened was the tables that were ready should have been sat right away with walk-ins and the 3 dirty tables should have been bussed i a reasonable about of time to accommodate the reservations. When you have reservations, you have to be able to use tables like puzzle pieces and not hold specific tables for specific parties (unless its a large party and only certain tables can accommodate them). It's as if the people running this restaurant have no experience running a busy restaurant. They need help with organization and help with the basic day to day functions of running an establishment that wants to grow and thrive in a competitive market. Also, I've eaten here probably 5 times and I've always felt the wait for food is wayyyy too long. They need some help in the food prep organization to execute food in a timely manor.

4010971,2012-12-04,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"On the day of Black Friday, after an extremely long and fruitful shopping at the North Las Vegas Premium Outlets, mom and I were so famished that we decided to just hit any nearby restaurant that's open. Luckily yelp stepped in, and we found ourselves at a vegan joint.

The place was a little off the track so pay attention to the signs or you might miss it. The place was quite small as well, with six tables inside and two outside. However, it has a very welcoming feel and the waitress was extremely friendly.

Their menu selection wasn't that big, and price can be leaning towards expensive, however, considering they are a vegan place and lots of the ingredients are more expensive to start off with, I'd say it's reasonable and expected. Gluten free is available to order for some of the dishes, but it does require advance notice.

Once we were sat, the waitress informed us that the chef cooks by the order, which means long wait time, especially if you have a bigger crowd in front of you. While it can be inconvenient and different from the normal restaurant, I find this refreshing. Just be prepared  for the wait, and don't come with a hungry stomach.

Tried the Wow Pastry and the Chocolate pancake with boysenberry syrup. We did have to wait for close to half an hour for the food. Mom was so tired from the shopping that she dozed off while waiting.

When the waitress bring out the chocolate pancake, I can smell the aroma from miles away. If this is a drug, I'd die a happy little death just by inhaling the wonderful aroma. Every bite of the pancake filled my mouth of chocolate, yet flavor wise it's not overwhelming at all. Coupled with the piping hot boysenberry syrup, I think I found myself a dessert heaven.

Mom's WOW Pastry came out piping hot, and was decorated with fresh and edible flowers. The puff was so crispy, yet so light, the filling was mostly the scrambled tofu filled with all different spices. One bite and I was transported to an exotic country dining with the royals. Ok, that might be a little too much exaggeration, but trust me when i tell you, the WOW Pastry was SO GOOD that I wish I live in Vegas instead of just visiting for the weekend.

Pura Vida is a wonderful restaurant with extremely tasty, yet healthy food. The only reason I didn't give them a five star is because I wish they can get better than better with local support. Upon leaving, the waitress informed me that you can now call ahead and order your food, and it'll be ready when you arrive to dine in the restaurant! I guess it's their way to work around the long cooking time.

Check this place out if you are in Vegas! Even if you are a meat lover, you'll find this vegan joint very refreshing. And who says you can't have some vegetables in between the meat?",R2JIyDE_GQ-DdBwPvix9gQ,0,0,4,8aegflrdr7Bk3xdUlXnZig

What prevents me from giving this joint 4 stars is the high price for the amount of food that's served. They charge you for every single thing you want to add on to your meal like 3 slices of banana or other fruit is $1 or more extra. 

I'd understand paying a buck more for a whole banana, but when your giving me 2-3 tiny slices and want to insist on charging me, it feels like your penny pinching for every tiny thing and that's one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to eating out.

We had a reservation on Sunday at 1 PM, but we went in at 12: 00 PM. Oh Boy, was Chef a bit angry at the Waitress because we came in earlier lol. But hey, we got in and sat down anyway. There were 2 more tables filled out of 8 tables. We were 3 tables with customers at that hour.

We ordered a Sampler meal (forgot the name. It had a main dish with empanadas,potatoes, zucchini noodles, cucumbers and salsa. Side dish was 2 pancakes). This was delivered at 1 PM, 45 mins after we ordered.Idiotic! It tasted alright..a little bit char taste in potatoes. Maybe because carribean food is in BBQ style?

Then, we decided to order Quesedilla. While we waited, a group of 4 came in for a take out and the Chef came out and outright denied to serve them. I felt it created a BAD vibe to all of us to shoo away others that way with no valid reason. The restaurant still had 1 more hour to close!!!

Quesedilla was served after 45 mins and had a burnt taste to it. It was stuffed with peppers/onions. Again, it had Zuchcni noodles on the side, Chipotle sauce dip. At this point, Chef came and stood next to us expecting a pat on her back from me. I did not pat her nor compliment her. I said the food is alright and not bad. I asked her why she shooed away some customers who came in 30 mins ago.  She said ""I cannot accommodate them because we are about to close"". My foot. Then, I asked what her aspirations were & her vision for her restaurant. She said ""I do not intent to serve in this location"" (which was shady by the way) ""& I am meant to be at a bigger place"". Good luck lady!

That condescending attitude never helps anyone become successful in any business.

if you do not mind getting bad vibes while you eat there, give it a try. Or else, you are better off trying a new vegan dish at home & be happy.",eMy1RwoErz5fU2V2wBDYTg,4,1,2,yzl4arr0GdOuWHTgMyW-KQ

The food was fresh, innovative and very flavorful.  The chef was clearly very passionate about her food and it was reflected in her dishes.  Beautiful presentation and delicious.  The reason I feel unable to  give them more stars are a couple of minor things.  First the menu's were very confusing.  They handed us three menus and it was overwhelming to read through them and figure out what to order.  The kitchen was out of at least 25% of the menu which was confusing when we were sat down.  My other beef is that they charge for literally everything.  They have their dishes as is on the menu, and then they push to upsale you on extra's such as onions, salsas, sauces.  The chef even came out and stated how a sandwich would be amazing with certain added ingredients.  The prices were already a bit steep and then with any with additions, you can very easily take a $12 sandwich and pay close to $18 for a sandwich!  The way I feel is for the price, make the sandwich with all of those ingredients and allow the customer to omit, versus add and pay the cost for it.  The staff continued to suggest trying sauces and salsas with our food and my husband unknowingly agreed until I warned him that they were all $2 each time.  We had $10 of extras to our bill :( Otherwise, fun and interesting vegan food.  Worth the drive off the strip to find it.  I just feel they need to lay off the upsale, it felt a bit like a car salesman.

It is very small, no fancy bells and whistles, but the food and service are tremendously AWESOME!

I will definitely go back, and they seem to post groupons quite often, so check there for good discounts.  I was happy & full, & excited. :)

Also, everything is organic (which is incredibly important to me), so the fruits and veggies are seasonal and change - FARM FRESH people.  There are quite a few things that I wanted to try, but needed to be phoned in before-hand (GF items & pastries).  So take a gander at their menu first to see what you might like.

After buying the groupon, we looked over the menu and placed our order over the phone, for dine-in.  i imagine, it takes quite a bit of time to make fresh vegan food, and so it does take awhile; however the best part is that they will suggest a better time for you to come so that they can accomodate you, rather than have you wait. This, once again is if you call in ahead of time.On their website, they do advise you to call in your order, but if you're just stopping by to see what they have to offer, you'll be frustrated by their long wait time. Some people looked angry at me because i seemingly came in, got seated and got my food, way ahead of a lot of people, simply because i followed their instructions on the site and called in ahead of time

The service, was warm and authentic. I had no mean servers, everyone was warm and everyday people. I won't say that they were wearing insincere, fake smiles, but they were genuine, pleasant servers.

I ordered the pura vida burrito, my girlfriend ordered the empanadas which came with cranberry chutney. She didn't care for the empanadas, but loved the burrito. I thought the burrito was great, and was reminscent of chili and I ate her empanadas. They weren't bad, just not as great as the burrito, but I made them work with the chutney and they were real satisfying. The presentation of the food was great as well.


Overall, it's worth checking out. it's a small vegan spot in a very intimate setting. I mean, i made my order over the phone and the head chef knew who i was and what i ordered.

I had the lentil soup and salad, my date the bagel with onions and we both shared an amazingly delicious red velvet cupcake.  Everything was gorgeous, delicious, and you really could taste the heart and soul that the chef/owner puts into the food.  The service was excellent, this is not a fast food place, but our dishes were out in no time at all.  the dessert was absolutely fabulous, negating all the healthy food we ate prior.

It is located in an industrial area, very small place but cute. The staff is friendly and knows the menu well. They were a little slow when I dined there for a late lunch on Saturday 9/3 but they were training two other chefs from Le Cordon Bleu and I was not in a hurry so no big deal. 

I ordered a mug of this pineapple infused beverage. It was not sweet, very light and refreshing on a hot summer day. I ordered the gluten free Latin-Tude burrito. It was served more like a quesadilla but it was delicious. It appeared to be made from a large brown rice tortilla, was grilled evenly and stuffed with potatoes, peppers, soy cheese and chili beans. It was a huge serving and I had to take half of it home, but it was just as yummy for breakfast the next day.

I was worried Pura Vida would fall into this trap but I was pleasantly surprised. I had the chili and a banana cinnamon waffle, and both were fantastic.

Small place, stuffy inside. The waitress is overly friendly. She called me sweety and touched my shoulder, got into my personal space too many times. She argued with the cook about what table number we were over us. Yes over us, one on one side of us, the other on the other side. The food took forever. Their 'coffee' was disgusting. It was sickly sweet and tasted like some kind of chocolately cinnamon goo. And I didnt even order the mocha one. 
Our food was weird. I have eaten at several vegan places and liked the food. This was just super strange combinations of ingredients that dont compliment each other. And it was really expensive for what it was. I went to the bathroom, scary bathroom! And then when I came back from the bathroom, there was the server in my personal space again.

The high point of the visit was the chance to meet and talk with owner/chef Mayra about her vision for vegan food in Las Vegas and the restaurant she finally opened to share that vision.

4665963,2012-07-01,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out while we were in Las Vegas for the weekend. The menu looked good, so I was pretty excited about eating here. 
We had to wait a little while for a table (maybe 15-20 minutes), which was no big deal. But then, it took 30 minutes for us to get coffee (also, you can't just order a coffee; you have to get a foofy, sugary espresso drink) and over an hour for all of our food to arrive. There were only about 10 tables in the whole restaurant and at least 5 employees working, so I can't see any reason that it should take that long. When the people sitting beside us asked about their food (they had received half of their food and waited 30-40 minutes for the rest, which never came), the owner gave them a condescending and long-winded speech about how she ""refuses to have"" industrial kitchen equipment and that they ""should know"" that her food comes out slowly. She even argued with them when they (very reasonably and politely) asked her not to charge them for food they didn't receive. She also talked about how she ""refuses"" to prepare food in advance-- including mixing batter or cutting vegetables. While I appreciate the sentiment of all of this, it is totally impractical. I get small-batch food prep, but there is absolutely no reason for a breakfast joint not to have, like, a waffle maker that can make more than 1 waffle at a time. I don't mind waiting a bit for good food, but 1-2 hours is ridiculous, especially when it doesn't even come out at the same (or even close to the same) time.
The food was pretty good, but it was really expensive for the portion size.
This is a place that is run by a woman on a high horse who has no idea how to operate a business. 
I will say that, aside from the owner, the staff are very, very nice. They work hard and are very kind/polite, but they are stuck working for a very poorly-run business.",w7TZ6ujuf4-bykxZGi5svw,4,1,2,e-BVlQaGDEDVHxFvtQXGMA
4677890,2013-04-29,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I'm with others-- I have kind of a love-hate feeling about this place. I was really torn about how to rate it, so here goes.

The good: 
I went with 3 other people and all of us LOVED our food-- even though I was the only vegan. I ordered the chocolate pancakes, my husband got the PB and banana stuffed pancakes, my friend got some other type of pancake, and my other friend got the french toast. The servings were HUGE, as in, I could have easily shared with someone and we would have both been full. I ate less than half of my meal, as it came with 4 or 5 very large pancakes. If you are going to have pancakes or french toast and don't tend to have a monstrous appetite, I would recommend ordering with the syrup on the side so that you can take a to-go box. Ours were pre-syruped, so they would have gotten soggy if we would have tried to take our leftovers. If I was rating this restaurant just on my food that I ordered, it would be 5 stars. Delicious.

The bad:
1) Menu selection: This is one of those vegan restaurants that is able to be vegan because they use lots of fake meats, fake cheese,  and soy. If you are soy sensitive or trying to avoid soy (or just don't like the fake meats and fake cheeses), you may have a hard time finding something to eat unless you are there for breakfast. 

2) The wait: HOLY COW. Unreasonable doesn't even begin to cover it. I called about an hour ahead and we were seated immediately when we got there (there were about 3 or 4 empty tables left, which is a lot given how small this place it), but waited literally an hour and 20 minutes for our food. They told us it would be 45 minutes and asked if we wanted a snack while we waited. My friend ordered a fruit plate, and that took 35 minutes to come out (yes, we were timing it). It was obvious that the fruit was pre-cut (the apples had that browning around the edges from sitting after being cut), so why on earth it took 35 minutes to throw some fruit onto a bowl is beyond me.  Also, 3 of our meals were done about 15-20 minutes ahead of the 4th, so we were almost done eating by the time the last person at our table got his food. 

3) The coffee: This is a little thing, but the coffee was WAY too strong (or had been sitting for SEVERAL hours, which I don't think is even possible given that we were there at 11:30 am). My friend ordered the coffee and used 3 servings of creamer, and it was still too strong to drink. We all tried it and agreed on this. 

4) Don't judge this place by its location or its exterior. It looks very shady, with bars on the windows in a neighborhood that is obviously less than desirable. My friends were clearly nervous when we pulled up to the building.",uYnjK07gmwoiQUhJl5odow,1,0,3,ZmYdu6QTy6UhYw_PGnKWVA

I fared no better with Tha' Waffle - a big waffle that I upgraded with seasonal fruit (same overripe  bananas) and a dollop of whipped cream for $1 - heavy and tasteless.

The menu: it's pretty confusing. A lady helped walk us through it, which confused me more than I already was. 

The location: I didn't mind driving to it at all, but the location seemed to be out of the way a little bit. The place itself felt more like a taqueria than a restaurant; which I also didn't mind, but then again I'm a young dude used to army living conditions.

The price: it cost me nearly $60 after the brunch sampler, a coffee drink, and the tip. I picked one of the pricier things on the menu, though. They had many cheaper options.

I'll put a disclaimer first. I was not in a happy mood when I came here. Annoyed that I was losing money, and annoyed that we weren't going to Ronald's Donuts like we had planned, instead went here. 

The service itself was okay, but very slow. They had four people in the prep area, but really only one person was serving and actually doing work. She was very nice, but not too attentive, and needs to learn how to multi-task.  I ordered the orange-apple water which was quite refreshing, kind of like vitamin water or really diluted sunny d. 

The food was pretty good, though on the pricey side. I had a chile relleno burrito. I was expecting a chile relleno inside the buritto, but really it was more like the flavors of chile relleno. A pepper was stuffed inside a burrito with some daiya cheese. It was good, but something I could replicate at home easily. It did also come with a delicious serving of beans and rice. And the portion was huge. It came with two ""mini"" burritos cut in half, so four half burritos. I had enough for dinner later.

The first three items are just different kinds of tofu!!! followed by vegan sausage (not sure what food group this would be) and three kinds of starches. What happened to VEGETABLES?!?!

There *were* several spinach leaves and some sliced green bell pepper - more of a garnish, really. Everything else, short of potatoes and the strawberry, was something pretending to be something else. WHY???

It tasted ok, while it was hot. But we ended up waiting for over half-an-hour (do vegans not have to be places?) and by the time our food came, it was just warm, which left just a small window of opportunity to try to enjoy it before it began resembling soft rubber.

Well, yes.  You got me there.  But sometimes, I actually want a little protein or maybe a waffle too/instead.  Is that so much to ask? Apparently so.

Until now.  

I'm gonna be honest.  I had tried some of Chef Mayra's catered food before at events and had not been blown away.  They were fine, always just a bit bland.  Not so with the brunch! Fortunately I went with three friends, so we just got one of everything on the brunch menu and shared.  I'm usually not a big fan of sweet/carb-y breakfast food, but the waffles and french toast were outstanding.  OMFG, that chocolate waffle.  It was like the most delicate delicious brownie... I don't know if I could eat a whole one, but 1/4 was the perfect breakfast dessert.  I also loved the regular waffle and the sausage with peppers that came with the French toast! The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the breakfast burrito.  It was a bit cold, with unmelted Daiya cheese, and the flavor profile just didn't hit me right.  But the side of beans that came with ..... damn.  One of the best things I've tasted in awhile!  I admit I probably took more than my fair share... 

Great coffee, with lots of different flavors of coconut milk creamer.  And the ultimate in refreshment - citrus cucumber water. Yum.

We had very attentive service, the chef even came out and spoke to us personally.  Our total bill for 4 with coffees, an entree and fancy waters was under $60.  We all left completely stuffed and quite happy.

Can't wait to come back and try the lunch menu; if it's as good as my favorites on the brunch menu, I'll probably round this up to 5 stars.  So thrilled to have an organic, all vegan place that's close to home!",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,10,9,4,2sdkPP9KoCDDfJ9zd54wVQ

It was busy and service was slow and there was a tv crew doing some sort of review as well. So this amped up the busy factor. I am also pretty sure they were taking pictures of our food. So it took a while but they came out with coffee, lattes, juice, salsa samples, bean dip salsa samples, etc. It kept us busy while we waited.

The bean dip salsa thingy is amazing. My mom and I just kept eating it. Fairly addictive I must say.

The food was huge and delicious. my father and I got the pancakes with fruit, fiance got the chocolate waffle, mom got a waffle with fruit as did my brother and sister in law. My father was a champ and took down the pancakes pretty well but they were enormous. I got it divided neatly in half and tried some sausage and potatoes. The sausage was spicy but good and the potatoes needed salt and a touch of oil but were good too. My pancakes were delicious and sooo filling. The waffles were reviewed to me as good in flavor but a little crumbly (these were all non vegans but me so I was impressed with good reviews). My mother declared the sausage nothing like real sausage and moved on. 

The coffee lattes were like candy bars to drink. They are more dessert-like but I had no complaints. I got the mocha and my mother the caramel I think.

Juice was great and everyone was very happy with it.

The cake tasting also went well. We decided on a lemon cake and it was super moist and spongy. The frosting was decadent and sweet so I am considering a fruit filling with it at this point to calm the sugar but it was so good.

My only touch of an issue was the location is a little strange, the wait for food was a bit long, and the fact that wedding cakes are not quoted easily. Its a process to get an estimate and that can be frustrating but its nice that the Chef doesnt overcharge instead. Its just a toss-up I guess. As for the staff, they are so sweet and nice.

I have nothing to say about Pura Vida's food because we never got to try it since this supposed community-friendly small business would not serve us at 1:45 because their clock said 1:50 when their hours clearly state they close at 2 pm.

Here's the story... my vegan friend is visiting so i bought the Groupon deal. On Saturday we planned to go for lunch and thankfully we called first and they said they close at 2. So on Sunday we tried to look at their menu online and were going to call in an order to pickup but their site had a bandwidth error message and so we could not see the menu.  As of right now you still can't see their website.

So we drove all the way across town and arrived at 1:45. As soon as we walked in the woman called out while we were still standing in the doorway that they were closed with an obvious grateful tone to turn us away. We tried to explain that we had tried to come for two days and it was a special treat for my vegan friend. She carelessly dismissed everything we said saying that they take the last order at 1:45 and that it is ""the policy of the kitchen because the food takes so long."" We practically begged to be served by this place and the woman had no care in the world.  I wanted to talk to someone else in charge but then I thought why bother this woman obviously doesn't want our business. So, I told her I would NEVER come back and she is very bad for business. Of course she couldn't care less. As we left I was further annoyed as I noticed a flashing open sign in the window. UGH!

Between my friend and I we have lived and worked in the service industry in Las Vegas, Miami, LA and Portland and have never experienced a small business having such audacity to turn away wold be happy customers. It was such a bad business move in these modern times of such high competition among businesses and the great opportunity for online reviews and word-of-mouth. Shame on you, Pura Vida.

It seems this place has good reviews and good food, but we will never know since we refuse to go back. We are all in favor of supporting local businesses, I am a Las Vegas native. In Las Vegas where the competition against big corporations is so great. We should all be supporting our community establishments, but when they make it clear they do not need our business what are we to do? Dominos pizza got our money today, again, Pura Vida, shame on you.

We will be refunding our Groupon and telling everyone we know to not bother going to Pura Vida before 1:45 pm, or ever.",L-kqU1VNAKqt0vXdn0AjHQ,18,1,1,36KBIj1tj2Pus4jHpke7gQ

I have tried using my Groupon and tried making a reservation, but they don't even have reservations available on certain days or at certain times that would work for my schedule and theirs.  
Plus, I have been put on hold for over 15min. one time waiting to get a reservation for the next day since they didn't have availability.  So, I hung up and then tried calling back just to get the answering machine.  
The person that answers the phone is the owner.  
Tried to call again today and make a reservation and they had NO availability.
Asked her to honor my Groupon when they had a reservation I could make & she blamed Groupon and said she would not be able to honor it for me (only what I paid for it $10, but not the discounted portion full $20).  Really??  Over $10, you can't accommodate someone that is trying to make a reservation that can't get in and has never been to your restaurant?  

Then, she tells me I can walk in today??  Really!!? I told her but your Groupon says that I have to make a reservation!  Thanks for telling me that ahead of time.  

WOW WOW WOW!  Not a place for me, so I have contacted Groupon to help me out because I don't want to every step foot in a ridiculous place like this.  

If you can't handle the Groupon load, you have no business advertising through Groupon! 

PS to the Restaurant:  A lot of Groupon people are also YELPERS, so I would be a little more accommodating to those that review your restaurant!

This isn't my first foray into Chef Mayras food as she's catered a Yelp party prior which gave me hopes for something spicy, zesty and flavor filled for brunch.

David S. and I came before volunteering at Three Square and shared the large portions. We've both wanted to come on a weekday when it wasn't so busy. I think what we had was very meat eater friendly and hearty. Unless your family eats only meat, it's good brunch eats for any person. 

Sexy Shortstack - we added blueberries (+$1) into the pancakes and it came with bananas on it (I guess on weekends it gets fancier with fruit medley and an extra pancake...Don't get why toned down on weekdays?). Vegan or not, these are some of the yummiest I've had. I like very light and fluffy cakes and not enough places serve good syrup that compliments and not overpower into a saccharine coma. I always share sweet breakfast foods since it often is too much sweet, but I can see myself actually ordering this and being able to eat it with maybe a side of sausage. 

My Love Burritos were spicy, zesty, and flavor filled like I was hoping for. The two burritos were perfect for sharing and there was all kinds of spiraled veggies garnished but I ate those too....maybe that could be like a ""salad"" with some dressing on it? I like that the tortilla was grilled....I always get disappointed with sandwich wraps around town that just hand you a cold tortilla. This was filling indeed so it could be for a big man appetite to go at it alone. 

Of course, keep in mind this isn't fast food. Everything is fresh made and did take a while.It wasn't completely packed but there was a constant flow of people.. probably was 15 minutes for our pancakes then another 10 for our burritos to come. I thought that isn't unreasonable. The staff was nice and our server was friendly, attentive, service with a smile. 

The reason why I haven't been, even when my BF and I were eating 100% plant based is the times. It really sucks being night people and these breakfast places are closed before we even wake on weekends. 2pm Saturdays seems too limited for a city like ours...and it's also closed Sundays.  It'll probably be a while before I can come back, but not because I don't want to.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,3,4,3jKjCqInAcc6Dy1HJAtqSg

The majority of my diet is vegan. Well....""whole food plant based."" There is not any vegan places closer to me, but this one is about 15 minutes away. And I'm so thrilled I finally tried this place!

Vegan is very hard to do...and a lot of people veer from it because some people don't know how to cook vegan or make it taste great. Chef Mayra is an amazing cook and has such an awesome variety on her menu. Everything is made to order and fresh for that day. 

I went here with a friend on Saturday morning for brunch. We had - 

Pura Vida Empanadas - filled with vegan meat, cheese and veggies. I don't even know what the cream sauce was on top...but it was delicious. All very good flavoring with Pico de Galo on the side. 

Course 3 brunch sampler- fruit empanadas, tofu scramble, chili potatoes, soy sausages & pancakes with bananas. 
The Chili potatoes are amazing. She uses yams in a lot of her cooking too, which I love. 
The wheat pancakes are awesome too. 

I also had the infused water - Apple Orange kiss of Mango water. Loved it and so refreshing!

The staff is awesome and friendly...as well as the people in the restaurant. It's just one of those ""good vibe"" type of places. 

Everything was SO good. I cannot wait to go back for more breakfast and lunch items. The Northwest side is DYING for a place like this. I would be eating out all of the time...so maybe it's a good thing there isn't one too close to me.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,5,4,5,VfCHauyfDD_wDZE3DM5vwg

5176341,2013-07-08,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I have been eating at Pura Vida since they initially opened. As a matter of fact, I have been a customer of Chef Mayra's since BEFORE this restaurant opened-- my father hired her to bake me a vegan cake for my 21st birthday.

In terms of Pura Vida, the food at this establishment has been consistently good. Yes, the wait is long; yes, the menus are all over the place; yes, the place is run in a discombobulated fashion; yes, sometimes the staff is short with customers. But the food has always been tasty. 

My visit earlier today, though, will mark the last time that I patronize them. Ever. Please read of my experience below:

My friend and I walked in around 11AM and were briskly told to ""read the sign!"" Looking around, we were unsure of what sign to read. When it was pointed out to us, it stated plainly that no Groupons would be accepted this weekend following the 4th of July, and that if we have a Groupon we can come back tomorrow. [This immediately gave me a flashback to Father's Day weekend '13 when I came in with a different friend and, upon attempting to redeem her Groupon, were told that they would not accept it due to the holiday weekend. Even though it expired that weekend, and no where on the Groupon did it say that it was void on holiday weekends]. 

Continuing on... Not having a Groupon on this visit, my friend and I didn't worry about the sign. We were then asked, rather shortly, ""So do you still want to eat here?!"" I could barely get the 'yes' out of my mouth before we were then asked, ""Well, do you have a reservation?!"" Having not EVER made a reservation, save for Mother's Day '13, I said 'no'. We were then met, pretty much, with a, ""Let me see if we have room for you"". Thankfully, after a brief time, we were seated. 

Upon choosing our meals, our orders were taken. I decided on 'Tha Frenchie', which is a french toast dish with syrup, bananas, fresh berries [when they are in season], and ""A DRIZZLING"" of chocolate syrup. Having ordered this dish on Mother's Day and not able to eat more than two bites because it was absolutely DRENCHED in chocolate syrup [and had no berries, since they were not in season], I politely asked three questions this time: 1) Are berries in season? (yes) 2) So there will be berries on my french toast? (yes) 3) Can I please order the dish with no chocolate syrup? (yes)

After some great conversation with my friend, our meals arrived. My french toast had no chocolate syrup on it, but neither did it have any berries. Before the waitress walked away I said, ""Oh! It looks like the berries are missing. May I please have my berries?"" to which she replied, ""Let me check"".

Puzzled by this response, my friend and I exchanged looks.

Chef Mayra, the owner, then walked abrasively up to our table and lectured me on how my choosing to get no chocolate syrup messed up the flavor profile and, essentially, how dare I think that I could further ruin the flavor profile by enjoying berries on the dish with no chocolate syrup (?). It really made no sense at all, so I then said, ""Well, the menu says that the dish comes with fresh berries...I just didn't want the chocolate..."" Chef Mayra then continued and stated that I am ""lucky"" that she is here today, else her chefs would not have even altered her ""Signature Dish"" to the extent of not putting chocolate syrup on it because they are trained to not alter the Signature Dishes. 

Oh, but this is a special day--- so she then handed me one large strawberry, sliced up on a plate. ""Here is your berry this time. But we won't be able to do this next time"".

Wow. 

I felt like that was a huge slap in the face. And the whole deal still doesn't make much sense to me. Why was she in such a bad mood? Why was she so offended that I didn't want chocolate syrup? To be sure, I didn't mention the thirteen wasted dollars on Mother's Day due to the french toast being ruined by a gallon of chocolatey goodness. Maybe I should have? 

In any case, I felt like a very undervalued customer today. In the time since Pura Vida opened its doors, I have brought A LOT of varied business to them-- business that would have, initially, never even considered this restaurant less I suggested  it.

It really is too bad to see such a good restaurant idea not live up to its potential because of bad customer service. As a vegan, I loved to eat here. But my money (and my partner's, and my friends', and my family members') money will be spent elsewhere. At restaurants where we aren't treated like annoyances.",5746cvWPCA6PNorA_cSEIg,10,1,1,8WAYaDZL3uF3iKvlBz7rgw

I loved it. 
My husband loved it.
You have to make a reservation to get in. 
Many yelpers have complained about wait time or being turned away - but this just a place that requires a reservation. Get over it.
We made a reservation, we were warmly greeted by the chef as we entered - as if we were in her home and she had been busy cooking for us in advance. 
The prices seemed high on the menu - but once we got our food, we realized the prices were perfect for the HUGE size meals we got. My husband and I shared two meals with our two small kids and still took home enough food to SHARE for dinner that night.
I really HAVE to go back to try some of the sweeter options on the menu. We had more savory lunch items this time - and i don't think i've ever had better food at a restaurant - ever....

As for the Groupons - you have to read the fine print on those things. A shop owner makes just about nothing off the sale of a Groupon - so cut em' some slack. 

Wait time for your meal is around 30 minutes - more or less. Expect that. But once you get your food - you'll forget about how long it took and realize it was custom made for you and it is amazing.",QmL43PUTElLxi32nIVSD8g,1,0,5,itRy1jlyFpl8kl3FbMuLRQ
5199211,2012-08-01,10,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I am in love with My Love. Yes, my love is an Asian violinist extraordinaire, but My Love is also a delectable burrito that you can share with me at Pura Vida. Pura Vida is a must-try for all the vegans, vegetarians and gluten-free among us. If you're looking for meat, you will sadly have to miss the delicious offerings served by the kind Chef Mayra.

I stopped in for lunch, although I am also eager to try their breakfast (note: Mayra said that Monday mornings are best). I must say it was very hot in the dining room, and I am not sure if that was a one off thing, but don't show up in a coat! Either way, I still enjoyed my meal. Mason, the waiter, was a complete charm. 

I ordered the combo lunch that comes with a wrap/sandwich and a choice of soup or salad. My choices: the My Love Burrito and a salad. It is $14.99, which may seem expensive, but the portions are huge. The salad is the size of an entree salad at some places, and I ended up taking half the burrito home for dinner. 

I also ordered the hibiscus tea with strawberries and more, and it was the perfect refreshing beverage. It was a tad sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.

The salad is  beautiful: broccoli, cucumbers, zucchini, fresh mixed greens, spaghetti spirals of carrots and squash, and probably more that I am forgetting! It was a sight to behold. And, as I mentioned earlier, I love the My Love. It is chock full of beans, spinach, potatoes, peppers and avocado. It was truly a flavor explosion. It was the type of dish that you want to stuff as much as possible of into your mouth at once in hopes that you can maximize the deliciousness. You know that feeling?

For delicious meat-free options in Vegas, this is definitely as good as it gets! Woohoo!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,25,16,5,s3DXLqbS5BKhwjKRi5Yb-w
5250907,2012-07-27,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"Went on weekday - around 11:30 am.

The Good:
1) Once the greeter/server realized I was a first-timer, she gave a brief overview of the drink and food menu.
2) I ordered the Puffs (like large empanadas but pastry is more like a turnover e.g. lighter, puffier, thus the name) with a side of chili. Server meant to tell me there is no chili (other choices soup or salad, but no soup, so salad was the only choice) with apologies. I really wanted to try the chili. She suggested that I order the side dish of chili potatoes ($5), that way, I could try the chili that way. I did, and still ordered the Puffs (stuffed with vegan items, soy meat, cheese and spices). Two large puffs ($10). The portions were big, and I had planned to take leftovers with me. Either I was hungrier than I thought, or it was so good I couldn't stop eating - it was the latter. I left absolutely full with vegan yummy comfort food.
3) I did not have to wait for a table (it did fill up around 12:15), my food was promptly delivered, and my water glass was promptly filled (when I asked and other times when I didn't).

The Bad: 
1) Difficult to spot on Western Ave. - passed right by it (signage only on building) - good thing I had the address so, did a u-turn. 
2) Parking lot is small (went on a weekday - other nearby businesses open - so could not park in their lots). 
3) They use a spray bottle to clean tables. When they cleaned the table next to mine (close quarters BTW, it's a small restaurant with maybe 8-9 small tables), I was concerned about ""the spray"" hitting my food. Luckily, Chef Mayra sprayed into cloth and wiped table (other workers did not do this during my meal, but those tables were a further away). However, I did smell the cleaner though, kinda like chlorine, not pleasant when you are eating.

Overall, the food will keep me coming back.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,2,1,4,SNy4-1OWBbFve39OrPG9eA

I am neither vegan nor vegetarian and the concept of tofu made into meat-like-product generally disgusts me, but with that said I do harbor a soft spot for high quality baked goods and breakfasts - vegan, veg, or otherwise - and perhaps as a result of limited ingredients and a need to innovate or perhaps simply because they use a lot of sugar, great produce, and top notch chocolate and maple syrup my experience over the course of much time and many cities has shown me that restaurants eschewing meats (and sometimes even butter and eggs) tend to produce some really excellent sweets; a fact that led me to Pura Vida for breakfast on Christmas Eve 2012.

Small, well off the strip, and homey/shabby in a pleasant way that is entirely anti-Vegas Chef Mayra's Pura Vida Bakery and Bystro is billed as ""Las Vegas' First & Only 100% Cruelty Free Restaurant!"" and with only one server plus Mayra herself running the small space it is certainly not a place to go for a quick bite as wait times for one of the twenty or so seats can top an hour and each dish can take up to an hour to emerge from the kitchen but those with patience (or time to spare) will certainly be rewarded with what I personally consider the best Vegan food I've ever tasted - and perhaps the best breakfast in Las Vegas outside of Bouchon.

Setting aside the anti-meat propaganda (an interesting way to spend your wait time) and focusing solely on the food and service every aspect of my nearly ninety minutes at Pura Vida was excellent - an appetizer of dense banana bread that was easily 50% banana coming first followed by three dishes emerging from the kitchen as they were prepared; the French Toast a bit less custardy than I generally prefer but light and not overly sweet while the chocolate waffle took an entirely different route by arriving entirely over the top; a crispy chocolate disc topped with dark chocolate, perfect bananas, and resting in a pool of maple syrup - a must order, but perhaps something best shared as it ranks amongst the most decadent breakfast dishes I've ever tasted.

Truly impressive and not only worth the reservation (or wait time) but also the hassle of getting there from The Strip Pura Vida is a restaurant that stands up for what it believes in and does those things very well.  While Veganism may not be a lifestyle for everyone I'm confident to say that Mayra could satisfy any palate if given the chance while the small staff does everything they can for each guest, even going so far as to plate my bread pudding because she noticed I was taking pictures before boxing it up to go, the dense cinnamon bread soaked through with spicy cider and skin-on apple compote proving a perfect dessert after Lotus of Siam that afternoon.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,5,_milS3YYTEgmJSLKobyySQ
5288444,2013-02-19,5,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I got fooled by Yelp reviews!

My boyfriend, his mom, and I had not only the WORST experience at this restaurant, but also the most UNCOMFORTABLE experience!

We decided to dine here for breakfast when we saw the great reviews and noticed that the location was walking distance away from the outlet. We took a taxi from our hotel and arrived to the restaurant at 9:20 AM on Saturday. The restaurant looked closed. My boyfriend tried the door and it was locked. I decided to be resourceful and call the restaurant to see if they were open. (I wish I never made this call! We should've left and eaten elsewhere!) They answered and said they were open and had forgotten to unlock the doors.

The restaurant looked dirty (typical whole-in-the-wall type of place). We were seated and menus were distributed. When we rummaged through 3 different menus, we were horrified at how haphazardly the items were placed and completely confused on how to even order. To make matters worst, the server tried to explain the menu to us - even more OVERWHELMING and EXHAUSTING! Items that had fruits and avocados listed will now only come with bananas since avocados and other fruits were ""not in season"" for the restaurant. Some items would take over 45 minutes and other items you can't even order unless you made a reservation ahead of time.

Crap, we're stuck here. The taxi driver already left. So we decided to order a WOW, french toast with a side of WOW, and Tha' Waffle. However, we asked for the WOW to be made without potatoes (my boyfriend's mom is severely allergic). The server was completely confused on how to place the order. Apparently, the cook can't make that dish without the potatoes. So she suggested to order the items that come on that plate as a la carte. Fine, we ordered as a la carte. We were tired of looking at that puzzling menu.

15 minutes later the ""Chef"" decides to come talk to us about how the WOW plate would be prepared. (Wait, she didn't even start on the food yet?) She said she wouldn't be replacing the potatoes for something else since the potatoes are the bed of the plate and everything else goes on top, but rather she would be removing the potatoes and adding extra bit of this and that. So she was trying to UP-SELL us because my boyfriend's mom is allergic to potatoes? My boyfriend had to clarify to her that we are not going to pay extra. We don't care if she adds more of whatever she wants or doesn't add anything at all, just take out the potatoes! She continued talking and moving her hands and flailing her arms trying to describe us the plate. She kept emphasizing how she WOULD NOT REPLACE the potatoes but would be REMOVING them and adding other stuff. What in the world? Does this person know what the word ""replace"" means?

We say fine and she finally goes back to the kitchen. A table near us receives their food in a timely manner (15 minutes after ordering). We've been waiting 30 minutes now. The server says ""THEIR FOOD CAME OUT FIRST BECAUSE THEY ORDERED YESTERDAY."" What in the world?!?? After 45 minutes of this grueling wait, my boyfriend's mom's food comes out. The chef comes out, too! (Not again, stay in the kitchen please!) My boyfriend's mom is displeased and when the chef asks how her dish is, she says ""So-so"" (my boyfriend's mom's English is very limited, I'm surprised she didn't spit out what was in her mouth back on to the plate). Then the chef says, ""All I want is a smile from her!"" The audacity of this lady!!

There was a yellow flower placed on top of her plate of food. She took the flower off the plate and placed it on the table. When my waffle came out a few minutes later, the chef came out again! Then she takes the flower off the table and places it on top of my waffle and says, ""You get a flower too!"" Is this place that cheap that they have to reuse garnishing?!??

Overall, our experience was horrifying! I've never had vegan food before and if this is the best that a vegan restaurant can offer, then I can never be a vegan.

If you still want to dine there, here are some tips:

1. Order your food the day before you plan on actually eating it
2. Be ready to wait for at least 45 minutes for your food if you didn't order yesterday
3. Don't get an explanation of the menu
4. Stay away from talking to the chef

The bill was $49 before tip - we ordered only three plates and no drinks. A little pricey for disgusting food and even worse service.",IIFUSAByx3fLmpe4h8tJ4g,12,2,1,MKRtlXTvuOhj5Ersb_kCEg

It's an extensive menu with a ton of options. Ingredients are all fresh, and every dish is so creative and flavorful. 

Portion sizes are great (for table sharing) and beautifully presented. We tended to over-order just to sample more dishes (the servers were great in helping us pack food to go).

The building and decor are basic...but Tell Chef Mayra that you found out about her restaurant from Yelp and she will really go all out...she loves people who are as passionate about food as she is !!

This small restaurant is always packed with loyal customers. It is nice to see waitstaff and regulars interact because you know that service is a top priority.

A minor inconvenience is the wait. The small grill is often occupied with pancakes and french toast, so if you place an order after a large party there is a wait. Not having much to eat, running errands, driving across town, and then waiting a while I was starting to get antsy. Somewhere along the line, the conversation stopped and we were squirming around in an uncomfortable silence. Chef Mayra must have sensed the mood change and sent some of her carrot cake bites. It was not necessary, but a kind gesture, and appreciated. They were definitely healthier than any carrot cake I have had. I enjoyed them more than my companions, because the frosting was not a thick cream cheese style, but looser and closer to a glaze. The cake was mostly moist with nice bits of carrots and raisins throughout.

When our My Love Burritos ($9.99) arrived, the two burritos came with a few flax seed chips and a side of salsa. You did not read wrong, there were two large burritos stuffed with a mixture of beans, potatoes, onions, peppers, and spinach wrapped in a spinach tortilla. This dish was one of their soy free offerings. On a regular day, I would probably eat just one, but I devoured both. The salsa came with nice rough cuts of cilantro.

5390443,2012-05-28,8,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"As I stated in my Red Velvet Cafe review, I think it's essential for me to point out that I'm not Vegan, nor in my wildest or tamest dreams could I ever become Vegan.  My love for the flesh of cows, pigs and chickens rivals that of Romeo and Juliet, McAdams and Gosling, and Kim Kardashian and (insert current boyfriend here).  

In seeing the great reviews for this place here and on John Curtas' blog, I was skeptical to say the least.  Upon seeing more and more pictures of the My Love burrito though, my skepticism began to fade, enough so that I decided to call in an order.

I'd read here about the wait and their website made mention to give plenty of time for an order to be prepared, so I placed it accordingly and was told it'd be ready in 35 minutes.  The location isn't the greatest and neither is the parking lot for a parking challenged individual for myself.  The food came out from the kitchen right when I arrived (perfect timing!) and the woman running the front of the house graciously allowed me to try some of the flavored waters they had available that day.  Wasn't too crazy about any of those but got some blended tea drink they had that was tasty.

Upon getting back to the office and finally getting a chance to see the food, it looked as remarkable as the pictures I'd seen of it online.  It was one of those things that I could almost tell was going to taste amazing before even having a bite, vegan cheese notwithstanding.   The following bites confirmed this, and the medley of tofu, beans, veggies, potatoes and yes, fear in my heart striking vegan cheese tasted blissful.  I wont get into my vegan cheese exploits of the past, but this experience erased those past experiences quickly.  The My Love burrito is quite simply the best vegan meal I've ever had, and I'd put it toe to toe against most meat filled burritos I've had.

At $11, it's pricier than your average burrito, but then again this is no average burrito.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,10,7,5,iphUiwrAJ35ExykvGfb73Q

With this in mind, they will only seat as many people as their chef can handle. Yes, there may be tables outside, but they won't really serve out there if the restaurant is full inside. While you wait for your food, I hope you brought some company that can engage in great conversations. Your best bet is to make a reservation and even order your food beforehand. Since they try to use local and fresh ingredients, their menu may be limited at times. I hope you're understanding and not all stuck up about this. I can appreciate Pura Vida's ideology of an old school restaurant supporting our local community. And I can definitely appreciate fresh ingredients.
With that being said, you'll definitely enjoy the food. They can be a little on the pricier side, but the portions are big. It's worth it. To my surprise, the chili was awesome! Quite spicy, but awesome.

It was saddly lacking in taste and moistness and amount of filling and it DID NOT have fresh flowers on it!!!  Only mediocre ,too small for the cake, icing flowers!  Too bad Chef Mayra, that you did not deliver what you promised!! I wanted to create a beautiful wedding , a delicious dinner, and a yummy cake for ourselves and our guests.

The look on my partners face was priceless once she saw me take a left below the under pass on M.L.K. since in not quite the nicest area and can make any normal human being throw on their crook brows with a quickness.  It's kinda like that movie scene in  Judgment Night, with Emelio Estevez and Jeremy Piven, as they took a wrong turn into the ghetto...except the dude in House of Pain don't squeeze off no rounds at you.  

Pura Vida is the epitome of what ""mom and pop"" shops signify.  The location and building provides an added unique feel as if you are in Cuba (entertaining three idea of what it would feel like if I ever visited Cuba).  It almost feels like I may get kidnapped and thrown in jail for saying the wrong thing, not to offend anyone.  Again, my partner looked skeptical about the whole situation while I assured it was worth it, as far as vegan dishes go.

Went with the Pura Vida pumpkin butternut yam chipotle chili with a side of 4 empanadas and their famous salsa chips.  Our waitress offered some samples of their naturally flavored water which were all delicious and very refreshing.  Fortunately, the meal was shared since it was very filling.  We both enjoyed the flavorful offerings that made us forget the dish was meatless.

The owner did her round as usual and very friendly.  Our waitress is very peppy and some say she can be a little particular, but was very informative when explaining the menu items.

I had breakfast at this little joint two Fridays in a row. Suzy H. is a fan, so I know it's got to be good. For my first visit, I was wowed by the vegan marble waffle, which was covered with strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, and chocolate sauce--this is vegan?  Sign me up!  The dish came with a side of tofu scramble, but just too much food for me to eat alone.  I ate half the waffle and two bites of the scramble.   Along with breakfast burritos made with veggies, vegan cheese, tofu, etc., the menu for breakfast is also loaded with a lot of sweet stuff, which was surprising to me.  Among other things, there is French Toast, short stacks of pancakes, waffles,  and dark choco waffles, many of the dishes served with fresh fruit.  This is a tiny place and it feels like being in Chef Mayra's kitchen, really.  She's the half Lebanese/half Cuban/ vegan cheerleader/owner/chef and this is her little kingdom. And, it is a small space--if you want to dine here with a party of five or more, you should call to reserve a table.  Chef Mayra is a warm, friendly soul who greeted us and also served us our meals and chatted for a bit.  
My second visit, I went with the Sexy Short Stack, pancakes made with organic flour, cinnamon, vanilla and banana with vegan maple syrup to drizzle over it.  This serving was more realistic for one person to finish and I almost did-hah!

5629681,2013-04-26,1,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"After only one visit, I already have a love/hate relationship with this place.

I'll tell you what I hate: the wait! The company's website encourages ordering ahead, and other reviewers warned of half hour wait times. Still, nothing could have prepared me to showing up for brunch, being handed 1 menu for our party of 2, and being told it would be at least 15 minutes before we could even have our order TAKEN. After finally ordering, we waited an additional HOUR AND 15 MINUTES for our food to arrive. Meanwhile, other tables who had only been there 30-40 minutes started to receive their orders. Luckily, our poor, over-worked server could not have been more of a saint, and she visibly looked pained every time she'd have to tell us that we'd have to wait ""just a bit longer."" Eventually, the Chef had to come out and apologize. Apparently she had re-arranged the tickets, and ours kept getting pushed back in the mix. She wound up comping our bill, which left me feeling less cranky about the horrendous wait time.

But, enough about that--- here's what I love: the food. Dear lord, it was amazing. Here's a list of a few things we ordered, and my thoughts on them:
-The Chili: Amazing! It had this lovely balance of sweetness (thanks to succulent chucks of yam) and spice (peppers, I presume). Easily, it was the best chili I've ever had in my life.
-The Side Salad: Huge. Easily a side salad for 2. Loved the surprising, fresh ingredients, like sliced oranges. We had the creamy garlic dressing, and it was quite tasty without being over-powering.
-The Latintude Burrito: Massive. Soyrizo is my favorite, and this one had just the right amount. The Vegan cheese was super convincing, and my taste buds couldn't tell the difference. I loved that the burrito was nicely grilled, making the tortilla crispy and delicious! Despite being packed to the brim, I think this is the 1st burrito I've ever had that didn't fall apart/turn to mush.
-The Empanadas: Crust was flaky and golden. The contents were a little too creamy for my liking. With everything mixed/blended together, I had a hard time making out individual ingredients. I can't even tell you what was in it. The boyfriend loved it though. 

So, there were things I loved and things I hated about this place. Would I ever dine there again? Never. Though, I can certainly say I might place an order for pick up.",ioAxaAZTOIfa-3AkwixF-Q,1,1,3,ZwSJ-oVGCEUTr4LTisf1Vg
5685169,2013-11-04,3,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"This is a tough one.

After reading through all the other reviews more thoroughly *after* my experience, I was glad to see that I'm not crazy and that my experience wasn't unique.

My boyfriend and I arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday.  My mistake - I thought they were open until 2:00pm as per the Yelp app, but the Chef vigorously and almost frantically informaed us that they closed at 1:45pm, therefore they only had 5 items available. We mentioned that that was fine since we only had an hour anyway since we were headed to the airport.  This invoked another frantic explanation about how she needed TIME to prepare the food and couldn't be RUSHED.  This whole encounter was stressing me out...

I asked if we could get anything to go and she pointed out some vegan cupcakes then mentioned she could get us some chili! Awesome!!  Chili it is!!  We ordered two servings of chili to go.

We sat down at an empty table to wait for our chili.  There was only one other couple in the restaurant and they appeared to be done with their meal - i.e. no plates or silverware, enjoying coffee.  We continued to wait.

After about 10 minutes I stood up to clarify our order with the guy behind the register.  We ordered chili to-go, right?  The guy called out to inquire about the status of the chili and the Chef burst out of the kitchen saying, yes, you ordered it to go, right? Right? I'm preparing it to go.  Right? That's what I understood. To go!!

The whole experience was just kind of bizarre. And dramatic. And borderline rude.

Not to mention that while we we waiting a group of four came in.  They got the same frantic explanation about the limited menu. They chose to sit down.  They made the mistake of bringing in outside drinks (iced coffees).  Now, while I was waiting I spied the signs about outside drinks not being allowed.  I then watched the chef approach the table and just take the drinks from the customers and put them in the garbage. No verbal explanation. No, ""Hey, would you like to finish that? We don't allow outside drinks."" She just took them from the customers and threw them away. REALLY?? The customers were kind of playing along with the drama, but you could tell that that action was a direct hit.

Finally the two 16 oz containers of chili come out.  Yay! Then he rings me up. $10 per serving??  I'm sorry, that seems high to me. $21.62 for two medium sized containers to go??  Whatever, just give me my food.

And now onto the food!  The one thing I ordered.  It was a pumpkin, squash, black bean chili.  It was excellent! The mixture was seasoned really well, the flavors and textures were well combined... it was some of the best vegan chili I've ever had!

I really wanted to have a great experience.  The cool, divey exterior, the photos of adopted turkeys on the walls, the fact it was a fully-vegan shop... but I didn't. And honestly, I don't think I would go back.

Footnote: as we  were leaving and getting ready to pull out of the parking lot, the group of four has decided to leave as well.  I don't blame them.",j1_TZCrY0THJ3mJArN7Rag,5,2,2,mnkp9-_LoajfN-U_xkSAqA

Went to try with the family after hearing a lot of good things about the food.  We arrived exactly an hour before they closed and after waiting a few minutes(although we were seen by employees upon entry) at the front were asked if we had a reservation by someone running helplessly back and forth behind the counter.  We replied  that we did not and she stated that they would not be able to serve us then because they were "" way backed up and would be closing in a few minutes"" (even though we were there an hour before listed closing and there were at least five tables open).  We advised the lady that we had a Groupon that was expiring that day and maybe we could use it for take out or at least the bakery.  She declined but did inform us that THEY would still allow us to use it for the original value we paid.

5746397,2012-05-02,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"I wanted to like this place but the wait for food was unacceptably long. There weren't that many dining at lunch time and there were 2 of us in my party. My friend's side dish was brought out so I got excited that I would be eating soon as well. Wrong! Never assume. That side was turned into an appetizer. It took maybe 20 minutes for her plate to arrive while I waited. The waiter explained that they accidentally served my dish to another table but were making another for me as quickly as possible. 

Meanwhile, a cook and some other staff were busy at the next table working on a catering order. The cook even asked what I was waiting on, but rather gruffly and out of nowhere so I didn't realize and register right away they were talking to me and what they said. (Tip: if the cooks are going to walk into the customer area, please don't walk out all dirty. Thankfully this is a vegan place so there's no blood on the apron but such a messy looking cook makes you wonder how messy/clean the kitchen and your food will be.) Finally, after 50 minutes of waiting since placing my order and starting to write a yelp review on my phone, they delivered my plate. Consequently, I had to redo my review.

There was no sense of urgency to correct the mistake, provide a snack while I waited, ask if I wanted something else that can be prepared more quickly, etc. My dish was an uncomplicated burrito (beans, soyrizo, potato, tofu scramble). Judging by the products used that I could see, I doubt anything too complicated is made in house only and I actually didn't see or taste everything listed on the menu in the burrito. The chef owner was there when we arrived but left shortly thereafter. I couldn't help but wonder perhaps if she had stayed the service would not have been as slow. The flavors were ok but lack of ingredients or lack of balance was disappointing. (menu said avocado, potatoes, etc and I didn't see any avocado and only one piece of potato)

When I had almost finished my plate, a waitress offered free dessert to make up for the wait. That was nice but I would've really preferred more communication and effort whilst waiting during the mistake that caused such a delay. I really wanted to love this place, have it be a place to frequent when in town, but now I have reservations about it.

Cut to a couple days later and we decided to go back and give them another chance for our final meal of our Vegas trip--this time it was for breakfast and the chef owner was there the entire time. Our food was delivered to our table roughly 15-20 minutes quicker than previously and was tastier, however we were disturbed by the attitude of the chef owner. She was condescending to her staff in front of us. She would ""apologize"" that the waitress didn't explain something on the menu or take our order, but there was a mean tone about it and it was right in front of the waitress who was helping the next table and it's not like we had been ready to place the order and was waiting. The timing of it all just worked out that way. Then when the chef owner was giving suggestions as to extra items to add to our food, it was very forced and not suggested like how it's usually done at restaurants so I would suggest a little more customer service oriented training on that one.

We learned from the chef owner talking to the next table that this restaurant is an experiment in pantry stocking, management, etc before she opens another location. Here is a suggestion: since it turns out that a lot of menu items aren't available at the moment, please note on the menu that those items are seasonal and perhaps put on the chalkboard what seasonal items are currently available. That will save staff a lot of trouble, management headache, and customer disappointment. (It makes you wonder, well what is available? and why bother putting it on the menu? and is that why my burrito was so empty the other day? and if so then why am I paying full price?)

Perusing the dessert case, the chef owner pointed out the items and even a fresh whole batch of brownies, as opposed to the ones cut in half and decorated. We asked the waitress if there was a price difference between cut in half or whole so she went to check. She reported that it's the same price so we requested a whole brownie. We didn't even want decorations. She went back to get the item but we could clearly hear the chef owner state that she didn't want to serve the fresh brownies just yet. The waitress had to come back to us and fib that the chef is too busy to decorate the brownie right now and brought us half a brownie at full price. It was not so tasty. If you want to sell day old goods, mark and price them accordingly. For the record, all 3(!) tables (5 patrons) had received their food and there was a table that had not placed their order yet so unless they were working on a phone order or another catering job, the kitchen was not busy.

My advice, stick to the savory food items and phone in your order to go.",KPkOFo9T1SIV45xOLLId2A,3,0,2,1e0kTMhlVnosusaRGJEMxw
5809610,2012-06-06,0,SuRxV4YkPsvyyqK57On0rQ,"OK, so let me start by saying that I have been looking for something like Candle Cafe in NYC (one of my all time favorite dining establishments anywhere) or Source in San Francisco here in Las Vegas. In two years I had not found anything until now.
Pura Vida does a lot well, and a few things not so well. That being said, I can imagine going back there many times.
What was good: 1) I believe the staff genuinely cares about the food, the cleanliness, and that they understand how important food is. They use great ingredients, treat them well, and I felt good about what I was eating there in every way. And today, in a world where most food comes from Sysco in all restaurants from the low to high end, where most everything is factory farmed, and is part of a system that is toxic from start to finish, finding an establishment like this is a REAL gem. What was also good; the quesadillas, the salsa, the burrito, the rooibos tea and the FANTASTIC chocolate chip peanut butter cookies.  We are going to go back and try more of the menu. 
What was not as good. It was slow, too slow for me. They are understandably still working with the challenges that surround serving fresh organic and raw food that has no preservatives. They could also use an expediter to make sure the customers' experience is better. People do not like to wait too long, even in Las Vegas.
Chef T was awesome, Cynthia Jean was awesome, and I can not wait to go back. If they can make the experience a little bit crisper, and if the recipes for the other dishes are as good as what I had today, I will update this to a five star review.",5fefSJ8gFQd_nANLezdfpw,2,1,4,QlA9CJjizU8TiVGp3LJreA

I walked in with my girlfriend, my mom and my dad right at 9:00 when they opened on Sunday. We were told that since we didn't make reservations to take a card and make reservations next time.(I tried to call them at 8:30 to make reservations that morning but there was no answer). The chef was pretty stressed that we had no reservations but she reluctantly  sat us in the ""VIP"" area. 
There was one other table of people eating when we sat down. A few more tables came in while we were eating but it never got full so I didn't get the whole reservation thing. 
The first thing out of the mouth of our waitress was, ""let me tell you what we don't have"". Not the best way to start. After a loooong and confusing  explanation of what we could and could not order, we decided on a few things. 

The food took a while but when it came out it was awesome. Really fresh and super yummy. The chef came over to talk to us at one point about animals and why we shouldn't eat them. I'm vegan. I get it. I respect her passion and generally like quirky, eccentric people but my advice would be to take it down a notch and chill. 
Everything is going to be alright.",1Y2OIcjK7bOpSlA8CRZVdw,6,1,2,9cLdmq2iErJe-GDUKOkMkg

If you'd have told me I was going to eat vegan food and not just like, but LOVE it, I'd have laughed in your face and said something like ""Oh, you,"" while walking away shaking my head amusedly. I mean, I'm a card-carrying carnivore, and there's no way vegan ""meat"" or ""cheese"" could ever satisfy like the real thing, right? While the vegan versions might not be exact matches, Chef Mayra proved to me that they can also be enjoyable.

I had the bean salsa to start, because the meal I ordered didn't include beans, and I was craving them. The description for the salsa online says ""A meal by itself made with pinto beans, black beans, chunky tomatoes, vegan cheese, refried beans, lime cilantro, avocado in season & Chef's spices. Served with chips."" I definitely could have eaten it as a meal by itself. It was also super frickin delicious (if you like beans).

I can't find the entry online for what I got as my main course, but it was some kind of puff pastry smothered in ""nacho cheese"" sauce with a filling similar to that of The Latin'Tude burrito (black beans, refried beans, soyriso, tofu scrambles, vegan cheese, avocado, veggies, onions, garlic, cilantro, tomatoes, roasted organic potatoes with poblano peppers), minus the beans. SO GOOD. I was so surprised I liked it as much as I did that I forgot to take note of exactly what it was. To drink I had the Cafe No Leche, which uses a blend of soy and coconut milk instead of cow's milk. I'm not a fan of soy milk, but the coconut milk gave it an amazing flavor and an awesome frothy top.

The meal definitely wasn't cheap -- my total bill plus tax & tip came to around $30. That's a lot more than I'd usually spend on one meal just for myself. However, I was able to take home half of the starter and the main dish so I could make a second meal out of them later on.

I'll definitely be going back and bringing some people to share with. Chef Mayra -- a complete honest, down-to-earth sweetheart of a woman -- and her food have won me over. (Forgot to mention the place is also adorable on the inside!)",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,1,5,tsVOKngBoT3aFYUfc1aCcg

Las Vegas is filled with wonderful wonders - small owner operated places that are totally unique for any city. Pura Vida is one of those unusual special places.
I know how frustrating it can be to deal with wierd locations and wierd hours, but realize that it is difficult owning and operating a small business. Please be patient and understanding and you will be rewarded. If in doubt about hours of operation - ALWAYS call first and verify!

Very interesting and tastey veggie fare. The prices may seem a little high when you look at the menu, but when the food arrives, you will find plates piled up high with quality food. And depending on how much you eat - there's probably enough for a another full meal.",-rW_Q9pknwudToXWfRNZsg,1,0,4,VoRgZ9zSF3SEoJQex5gh_Q

The food is impeccable, fresh, flavorful, beautifully presented, & the chef only uses local produce that is in season. Wonderful, friendly staff, & the chef is warm, charming & funny!  The 'my love' burrito & breakfast pastry puffs are a must try. The chefs signature bean salsa and chili are also must try staples. The chef is always switching the desserts weekly, & I've never tried one that didn't blow my mind.",2rIOC06QezS71w5Evh_z9w,1,0,5,CD3UroggI5CR56-uplanuQ
