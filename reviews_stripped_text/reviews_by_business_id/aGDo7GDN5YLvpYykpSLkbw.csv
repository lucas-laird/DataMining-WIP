106008,2006-05-27,1,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"Very easily the most authentic Cuban restaurant in Las Vegas...and if you want to gamble on it, in Nevada.  My Cuban family is EXTREMELY picky about Cuban food, and claim that nobody can cook as well as my grandmother - but I must confess, some of these dishes were even better than hers.  Oh hell, she thought so too!  The ropa vieja was sweet and tender, the yucca with the perfect amount of lemon juice and garlic (too many places leave them oily), and cafes con leche that are better than some places in Miami.   If you're a vegetarian, you won't really find anything to eat (the congri has pork, the vegetarian sandwich is less-than-stellar...), but meat eaters will be very happy!

It's only downfall - and for this level of flavor, it's minor,  is that Florida Cafe is located in a not so stellar location inside the HoJo's (the Howard Johnson).  

[edit: and as for Linette's comment below, I just have to say (as a fellow Cuban-American) that I disagree!  We always run into random relatives and such here, all born and raised in Cuba.)]",5pkKmvYlcxQNag1ym6gaEg,1,5,5,2xw5D1rIBGV0D7tYD7PkZg

290269,2007-12-28,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"Picture this... Christmas Eve... a family of 6 (5 Cubans & 1 Mexican)... traditionally Noche Buena we have a very nice cuban dinner planned,,, this year, we decided to spend it in Las Vegas.  Found Florida Cafe via internet.  Called the restuarant, they indicated RESERVATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED.  (Strike One)  We arrived at the restaurant, approx. 8:30 pm.  The restaurant was packed.  We waited for approx. 45 minutes at the bar.  Restuarant closes at 10 pm.  Within those 45 minutes, we had to wait for an unexpected large party to leave, and for the restuarant crew to clean up the tables.  As we waited patiently, had a few drinks at the bar, another large party shows up.  Remember: Reservations are not required.  The large party that showed up while we were waiting at the bar, was seated first before us.  Hmmmm!?!?!?!?!?!  (Strike Two)  Shortly thereafter, we were seated and were rushed to order our meal.  To our surprise, and it shouldn't have been, they ran out of Pierna de Puerco Asada.  (Strike Three)  We ordered Croquetas, Papas Rellenas, Ropa Vieja, Chuletas de Puerco, and Masas de Puerco.  Before we finished our meal, which now it's approx. 10:15 pm, the restaurant shuts off the music.  They started the restaurant closing practices.  Which I thought and everyone else at the table, is rude.  When we finished our meal, we asked for coffee and capuchino, and the our waitress, same as hostess, told us the coffee makers and capuchino makers were OFF!  So no coffee, nor capuchino!  OK!

Overall, our first experience, was not so great.  Food... good.  Price... ok.  Service... so-so!  Will I return to Flordia Cafe?  NO!

Will be a memorable experience... because the couple in this party, chose to come to Las Vegas and have a sort of traditional noche buena dinner for the 50th Wedding Anniversary.",e7dVAPbffEjff-3w-AbL-g,0,0,1,PY_6wtu7NLdCPjkQ45-H0g
291777,2011-12-06,1,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"I love eating lunch here!  I always get the same thing -- sandwich de ropa vieja (shredded beef, #63).  The sandwich is delicious and comes with fries.  The servings are also really substantive.  I usually only end up eating half the sandwich, and take the other half back to work.  (This is sort of dumb because I don't think the left over sandwich tastes as good.)

Although I've never had it, my peeps from work have also had the Cuban sandwich, which they really liked.  Other must orders include tostadas cubanas (toasted bread with butter -- sooooooo not healthy, but soooooooo not relevant or important when you're having some) and maduros (sweet fried plantains).  

The service is admittedly slow; the food takes times to come out and the waitress may not be back for awhile to refill your drink or for you to ask for the check.  But, as someone else pointed out, it doesn't matter because the food is damn good and makes up for it.

Also, the location looks sketch but is totally fine.  The restaurant is located inside the Howard Johnson lobby facing LV Blvd; the HoJo is a bit dilapidated.  Parking is limited either along the driveway to the back parking lot, or the back parking lot.  Once you park, you then have to walk along the driveway (short walk) to the HoJo lobby.  Easy!  

Although it was not entirely clear, last time I was there, I saw an open lot to the right of the HoJo on LV Blvd that had a Florida Cafe banner.  I think that may be a parking lot for the restaurant, but it looked like the lot was unpaved.        

Overall, the restaurant is really good and definitely worth a visit.  It's brightly decorated and has good music playing.  I especially love the ambiance.  Almost every time I've been here, I've heard Cubans speaking spanish while eating lunch near my table.  To me, that's a grade A sign of a place with good Cuban food.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,1,4,4,_6sO0EJz0t7vzpP1dAYhzQ

i've had a $10 restaurant.com coupon for almost a year and finally made it there.  i was looking forward to their buffet so i could try a variety of Cuban dishes.  i've never had Cuban food before.  they said they wouldn't take the restaurant.com coupon!  server said they only take Groupon coupons for the buffet, BUT they stopped the buffet two weeks prior!  the server walked away with our drink order, we were baffled, so i check their website on my phone and it advertises a buffet!  i called restaurant.com and easily got the certificate refunded.

my friend (female latina) read them the riot act and asked to speak to the manager.  they said the manager had just left to go shopping.  they eventually called the owner who said they are in a lawsuit with restaurant.com, but they would honor $10 discount.  now on to the regularly scheduled review.

the menu is HUGE!  almost 150 items!!!  no, i didn't count them; thankfully they have everything numbered!  i ordered the Sandwich Cubano ($7.99) which came with a small bowl of fries and my friend got the Pollo a la Pancha ($12.95) that came with some very dark rice and beans.  they served warm (fresh?) bread that was pretty good.  once it finally came, my sandwich was awesome!  i was a little worried about the combo of pulled park, sliced ham, cheese, dill pickles, and mustard but my mouth was in heaven!  the pressed Cuban bread was pretty tasty, too.  The pollo was, um, bland.  i thin, smallish breast that had little taste.  the rice was a little salty but pretty tasty.

so, there customer service is good, waitstaff is fairly attentive and my sandwich rocked!  their advertising and speed of service needs some work.  i also enjoyed the Cuban music they played, although it was a bit loud for lunchtime.

PS:  the buffet is still advertised on their website.  :(",uftVgvFArubrcsuXu7fEfg,1,1,3,IuhcSdESn8WWBUAnZ0qjdg

The food is amazing; so much that I went there for dinner the first night and breakfast the following two mornings. If there was a rating for service I would give it a 1. The first night we arrived at around 9:20 pm (they close at 10 pm). We got our appetizers, but still had not gotten utensils or napkins. We had to ask for water twice, once when we got there and once when the appetizers arrived. Note we were the only ones in there. For breakfast the next two days, the service got worse. On the third day we waited for 15 minutes after being seated until we ordered. Our waitress seemed to avoid us every time I tried to make eye contact.  Make sure you ask for water when you get there cause we waited about 20 minutes to get water.  Our food and coffee arrived first than our water; how do you explain that?  Bottom line, this was the worst service I have ever received, but for me alone the food was worth the lack of sevice.

It took about 5 minutes for someone to offer help even though the staff saw us walk in. I looked around saw only 3 tables with patrons with 4-5 restaurant staff. When we were done and ready to pay it took 15 minutes to have someone bring us the check. After it was brought to us no one picked it up and I walked it up to the lady at the register who redirected me back to my seat and told to wait for my server. The server did not return to the table for about 20 minutes.

The location is kind of out of the way.  Their sister restaurant (Havana Grill) is much more convenient.  The restaurant is located in the Howard Johnson Motel in the sketchy stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard that no one ever talks about (north of the Stratosphere).  I only went  because I had a Groupon. 

The Good:  the arroz con pollo and tres leches cakes (chocolate and traditional) are very good.  The staff was friendly.

The Bad: pretty much everything else.  Be careful when grabbing the serving spoons, some were hot enough to burn and some were cold just like the food in the trey.  So a lot of the meat was dry from sitting at too hot of a temperature or was cold because it was not held at proper temp.

My wife and I love Cuban food.  In our hometown of Los Angeles we go regularly to Versailles on the westside.  You can imagine our delight when we came to Las Vegas and discovered the Florida Cafe on Las Vegas Blvd south inside the Howard Johnson Motel.

The owner, Sergio and his wife,  are the most gracious hosts you could find anywhere.  We love the food so much at the Florida Cafe, we have come back through the years and we have eaten there  many times.  We visit  Las Vegas every year and our first stop is always this wonderful restaurant.

Through the years, Sergio has not just maintained but upgraded the beautiful decor--including conga drums for bar stools in front of a well-stocked bar, and the quality of the wonderful food.

Our favorite breakfast is Desayuno Cubano #5 for $8.95:  two eggs any style, two mashed potato balls stuffed with picadillo, sweet plantains and Cuban toast.  For a small additional fee, we usually get
rice and their wonderful black beans.  

Also recently we discovered their ham croquetas which are to die for.

All their delicious foods, their decor, the Cuban music playing softly in the background, all transport you back to Old Havana.   

For locals, this should be a a regular stop; for tourists to Las Vegas, it's a wonderful alternative to the noisy strip where you can enjoy great food at reasonable prices with attentive service.

If you have a car, try Sergio's  newer place in Henderson, Havanna Grill with live music and dancing  on the weekends .",NCUzrAMODu-aMyXrUttTPQ,0,0,5,UjRyv-Be7s9VfW0snWCeRQ

The bread sopped up all the grease and oily goodness.  Second we had fried plantain cups filled with shrimp and topped with more cheese.

916501,2008-03-21,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"Though I sooo don't look it, I actually am half Cuban...and I loves me some Cuban food!  Hard to get where I live unfortunately, so when I travel, I usually try to do a search to see if any can be had in my destination city.  Did I do it before my recent last minute trip to Vegas?? Uhhh, NO!  But luckily, the sister stumbled across this little gem in the back of a magazine...yay for us!

I was dubious about this place due to its location.  I mean really, how good could it be?  It was part of a crusty old Howard Johnson's in a rather run down (dare I say skanky?) part of town...not exactly inspiring!  But, for me,  the lure of platano maduro cannot, nay, WILL NOT be denied, so off to Florida Cafe we went!

The restaurant was cute enough inside, with a nice tropical feel - perhaps a bit tired but had a relaxed, easy going vibe.  Our waitress was gracious, accomodating and the service was fairly prompt.  No complaints.

We started off with the ensalada de aguacate. A large portion of avocado and a nice presentation...it was served dry and I missed the ubiquitous yummy garlicky dressing that I've come to expect.  We made due with the oil and vinegar available but it just wasn't the same. Still tasty though.

For our entrees, we both opted for the black beans and rice and of course, my all time fav, platano maduro!!   First off, the beans were cooked perfectly...dark, rich and flavorful.  Deeelish!   As for the platano, I was in sweet ripe fried plantain heaven!!  They were uberyummy...soft, sweet, dark, dark brown (almost looked burnt, but trust me, that's a good thing!!) and had chewy, carmelized edges.  God, I live for those crusty edges!!!!  Yea, I'm weird that way!

Oh and the bread was yummy too!

So, is this the best Cuban food I've ever had?  No, that is reserved for Versailles in Miami and, to a lesser degree,  La Cubana in Glendale.  But it was really good...reasonable, tasty and very satisfying.  And though I cannot vouch for any of their other offerings, I was more than pleased with the experience and am looking forward to my next visit to Vegas and Florida Cafe!

And yes, I did take 2 additional orders of platano maduro home with me!!!  God I love that shit!",X1_UUSe_exDAWu-Z3H7g9g,1,3,4,BpKZahD07dHJ8NOSk7l3CQ

922022,2014-07-05,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"We went here around the holidays last year. I am very familiar with Cuban food and this place is mediocre, to put it kindly. They would not survive in Miami. Visit there and you'll see. 

For starters, they use low quality ingredients yet charge full price. The steak that we ordered did not even have grill marks and the fillet was very skinny. One could find a similar quality steak in a Mexican restaurant for 1/4 to 1/3 off and they'll stuff you with fixings (e.g. chips and salsa), which compensates. 

I ordered a salad and all of the greens were iceberg lettuce and it was very pale, almost white. They could have thrown in a few pieces of romaine, butter and/or green leaf lettuce(s) to add some life and color. I'm not asking for escarole or French leafy greens. Even buffets do better for less. What I paid for was mainly the meat in my salad. That's so disappointing because even my homemade salads are better than this. 

Though I don't eat bread, my relative told me that it tasted okay, but she's had better. She had to ask for real butter because they gave her margarine. The waitress stated that it was butter, but my relative explained the difference between margarine and butter in Spanish. That's when she got the point. The meat and accompanying sauce was very flavorful. That's why I didn't give them 1 star. 

I get the sense that they nickel and dime everything because they're on Las Vegas Blvd. Technically, the Strip has not yet begun in this location because it is still considered a part of Downtown. This only means that the badlands are only a few blocks away. If drive around at night, you'll see what I mean. Location is everything.

The bartender was friendly and made us some wonderful drinks! Granted, they were only Captain 'n Cokes but hey, they were some MEAN Captain 'n Cokes and hit the spot.

So I drove to the Howard Johnsons and navigated the extremely narrow driveway to park in the rear.  I then sauntered into the restaurant where I was promptly and warmly greeted by a man I shall refer to as ""Julio.""  

Julio promptly seated me and then asked me the cursory restaurant questions and I asked that he tell me what was good for lunch.  Julio said ""everything.""  He then asked me about an appetizer and in typical Cuban fashion he spoke so friggin fast that all I caught was fried...potato...and beef!  So I said, ""sure.""

He brought the appetizer out so fast I thought he may have pulled it off another table.  It was surprisingly very good and tasty.  I'd love to tell you the proper name but again, all I heard was ""fried...potato...and beef!""

The waitress came and I ordered a chicken breast marinated in citrus and garlic covered with grilled onions.  She also spoke very fast and with an accent so thick that apparently I ordered an avocado salad as well.

The food came out rather quickly and the avocado salad turned out to be a fully sliced and pitted avocado and a very small plate of greens.  The marinated chicken breast was covered with grilled onions and served with white rice and black beans.  Needless to say, the food, although not what I had expected, was actually quite delicious.

The decor was very Caribbean themed as was the music.  In a nutshell, I'd promptly go back there again just to try something else off the menu.",Tb1AFoP1o2a4LN73aCZyzQ,5,2,3,kWzK6hAd77g_AXWKPqp6LQ

Can I compare their Cortadito (or the Cafe Con Leche) to one served street-side out of a styrofoam cup in an isolated Miami-based Cuban neighborhood where you'd swear they imported the high-octane bean directly from Cuba? No. Not even close. But their Pan Con Tortilla was pretty damned amazing.

1588538,2017-02-26,1,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"We sent a scouting party, my adult son and I, to check it out on Sunday, February 19, 2017, to make sure there would be seating for a group of 6-10, check out the area since it's in a shady part of town, and to check out the parking.

On Sunday evening, about 6:30pm, my adult son and I parked behind the restaurant, and proceeded through the hotel lobby to the dining room.  There were about 20+ people in the restaurant/bar drinking and eating.  Our order was taken by a gentleman and then served by a waitress.  We ordered masitas de puerco ($8), Cuban sandwich ($10), moros y cristanos ($5), yuca mojo con chicharo ($8), an expresso ($3) and a fountain soda ($3) (and a flan de carmello, that was never served).  The food was served fairly quickly.  We tried several times to get refills on the soda and expresso.  We sat there for at least 45 minutes just waiting for a drink refill and the check.  They finally offered to bring the check, and offered to send the flan to go because it was already on the check.  We said, ""No, we wanted it with our meal, just take it off.""  I don't like carrying wet food in my car.  They brought the check, we paid and left.  

On Saturday afternoon, about 1:00pm, our club members showed for lunch.  There were seven of us total.  We were the only ones in the restaurant to eat at that time.  We were seated together and we asked about separate checks.  We were told they could only do three separate checks.  We said fine, and placed four people on one check, two on another check, and one person on a check alone.  We wanted to try a variety of the Cuban foods, so on the check for four, we ordered two chicharon ($10), croquetas ($6), mezcla de aperitivos ($15), empanadas de ham ($6), two Cuban sandwiches ($20), moros y cristanos ($5), yuca mojo con chicharo ($6), flan de carmello (but it was never served), and for drinks we ordered te caliente ($3), Caribbean drink ($3), and a batidos ($6).  The other two tickets had a couple dishes and drinks, including a cranberry drink that also was never served.  During the food service, we asked if they could turn down the music because we couldn't chat over it, it was fairly loud.  The music was never turned down, so we just shouted across the table at each other.  Every food item was brought out and placed in front of the wrong persons.  We traded it around until we got it right.  The cranberry juice and flan was never served.  Once the majority of the food was delivered, we did not see the waitress or older lady again until we were very ready to leave.  They never checked back to see if we needed anything else, no returns to the table at all, and offers for refill of any drink, nothing once again.  We finished eating and sat there for about 30 minutes waiting on a check.  During that period of time another group of six people came in and were seated across the room. 

Finally, the waitress came and re-read all the ticket items off again, asking which items for which checks.  She had it divided up on the tickets correctly the first time, and we stated that, yet she now was switching things from one ticket to another for it to be rung up.  We also pointed out that we never received the cranberry juice or flan, so it would have to be taken off.  She finally came back, and again, read it off, and of course, had it wrong because she had switched things, but we just accepted the tickets the way they were and exchanged money across the table between us to make it right.  But we pointed out AGAIN that we never received the cranberry juice or flan, so it would have to be taken off.  The waitress said we had to pay for them, so they would box them up for us to take home with us.  The ticket holder with the cranberry juice said forget it, and she would just pay for the juice because she didn't want to wait longer for another ticket - and she paid for it and said just pour it down the sink.  I said I did not want the flan to go, and this also happened earlier in the week and seems to be a scam or just very poor service.  If you can't remember to serve something then just take it off. The older lady argued that they were very busy with so many people to serve (remember 7 of us and then later, 6 other people came in, that was it).  Then she said the waitress would be penalized for it and have to pay for it.  At this point, I was getting pretty angry.  I said ""that sounds like a personal problem that is not mine, but screw it, just give me the check because I'm tired of waiting too and I'll just pay for it, but I will never be back here again.""  I finally received the check, minus the flan, but they had added 18% gratuity to it for the crappy service - added to my check alone for four people, not the other checks.  This was absolutely ridiculous.  They didn't deserve 1% tip let alone 18%.  I paid, left and will not ever return to this scam artist practice again, nor will I recommend this problem business to anyone else.",jvmB9pym9-VVf-TBOUMGeg,5,0,1,w51-i0aCweNVRBQq92z0XA

I was raised in Miami but unfourtunately live in Utah now so the closets thing I have to get my hands on real cuban food is Vegas.  Anyway,  I went back to this restaurant and actually brought my bestfriend with me.  I was exhausted from walking the strip(big mistake)  and we both looked exhausted.  When we arrived there,  I noticed they had a wedding going on and the staff was taking care of them. I thought it was going to be great because besided the party we were the only other customers there.  The prices went up on the menu but it didn't bother me that much because I thought the food was worth it.  Our waitress was the most HORRIBLE waitress I've ever had.   I think we had three different people taking our order and one was trying to rush us in ordering our food when we barely got the menu.  Let just say that we ordered and no one ever brought my food out.  They brought my friend's plate out but not mine and no one ever came back to check up on us.  I also ordered a mojito and our waitress was so bad that the bartender brought it to our table.  I was furious especially after I bragged about how great this place was.  My bestfriend let one of the staff member know that I never got my food..  This was one tab too. They wanted to take my order again( after I've already repeated it to the third person) and after my friend had already finished eating her food.   I told them I didn't want anything except my tab.  I didn't leave a tip and I'm one of those people that ALWAYS tips.  My father in law decided to email them about the horrible service I had and they never responded back.  Luckily, I found a way better cuban cafe( 2055 east tropicana ave) with great food, great service and great price.

I told her I didn't see any sign and it wasn't posted anywhere and that it was wrong to charge us when we were going to add a tip to the bill anyways. Tips are not mandatory and are given voluntarily for good service. She was extremely rude and walked away. My friend received a refund for the double tip and as we complained we asked for a manager.

Waitress took our orders, and 1 hour and 15 minutes later we get our food COLD and we did not all get our food. Some of our guests had to wait an additional 20 minutes to get their food. I was so embarrassed. After all I had hyped up this restaurant!! Mind you the plates were hot, but the food was cold. We sent the first plate back, and one of the waitress gets upset and gave us an attitude about. We ended up sending 6 plates back and the rest of us did not eat our food. One of my guests asked to speak to the manager. Managers customer service was HORRIBLE. She stated that since we had not made a reservation they were not expecting a large party. My friend stated that there was a reservation made and manager stated she was lying. She then stated that the best thing she could do was give us a cake. Really? Finally she stated she would give us 10 percent off our bill. Then another waitress came out and was so apologetic. She stated that there had been a reservation, and they had just missed it. She apologized and stated this had never happened. I stated that I knew because they had always had exceptional food and service. I stated that what made things worse was her managers attitude. This waitress did make up for her manager. She was sincere and handled the situation well.  The manager never came over to our table to apologize or ANYTHING. Mistakes are made, we are all human, but to have an arrogance the way she did was horrible. I am sincerely sad to say that I will never be going back there and all of our friends who are usual customers will never go back. They ruined such a special occasion, due to their lack of professionalism.",QlGTHljFQB7Oq2jJtU3M2Q,0,0,1,QVOpnzJZ8nN-cJ61hROpzA

2491880,2012-06-11,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"So we got married down the street at Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel and needed somewhere close by for our 30ish visiting guests to eat after the ceremony, without worrying of them getting lost. I live in San Diego and therefore had to do all the planning over the phone, but I didn't think it would be a big deal.

I called Florida Cafe well in advance and alerted them to my large party of 30 and said we'd just want to eat the buffet, but I wanted to make sure they had a big enough space for us and that it was okay to bring our own cake. The owner was very agreeable and said they could definitely accommodate us and offered to have me come down to the restaurant and talk to him about the plans. We were having sort of a language barrier, I think, but I told him I lived in California so I wouldn't be able to come and chat. I re-confirmed that he had us set for 30 people at the buffet (since I wasn't sure he was getting what I wanted) and he said yes and that was it. I called again a few days before the wedding to make sure our reservation was still in order and everything was great. I also confirmed that we could drop the cake off beforehand and they had no problem with that.

After our ceremony all the guests walked over and started grubbing. My husband and I lagged behind and took photos, etc. When we got to the restaurant everyone was thoroughly enjoying their food and we tried to get some, but even when you have a chapel wedding in Vegas, you're still overwhelmed and have people coming at you from every direction, so I barely got a chance to eat anything. What I did eat was very tasty. The restaurant provided my husband and I two free glasses of champagne, which was very nice. Everyone raved about how great the food was and we pretty much had the room to ourselves. They even helped coordinate when we wanted to cake brought out. Overall it was a total success.

Here's my only complaint and the reason I mentioned what I did in the second paragraph: While we were sitting there in the middle of all our guests, the owner walked up to my husband and I, congratulated us, and then proceeded to scold me for not coming down to the restaurant to talk about food options because he could have given us a better deal or something like that. First of all, do NOT scold me on my wedding day in front of all my guests. Secondly, I think it's tacky to talk about payment for the food the guests are eating, in front of the guests. His tone was so, almost accusatory, that it created an awkward moment of he and I staring at each other and my guests all looking back and forth between us. I didn't even try to hide my annoyance with him and reminded him again that I live in San Diego and wasn't able to come down and talk to him and we were just fine with the buffet, thankyouverymuchnowgoaway.  

Other than that, I totally recommend using this facility for a fun location for your post-Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel reception. If you're able to, though, I guess you better go sit and talk with the owner. Jeez.",QExDVuut0SnRgyIDqqKASg,4,6,4,pRzs8rdQ0vM4vbykpjs8PQ

(Note: My family and I speak Spanish, so this entire visit should have been easier for them since it was said in their native language)

This used to be the hot spot for the Cuban community to get the best food, and within the last year it has gone to $h!t. 

The biggest complaint is the service:

-Ordered a rum and coke. The waitress gave me a coke in a regular cup (took a sip to make sure) and I asked where is the rum. ""Why would I put rum in it? *laughs*"" UM. Because that's what I asked for? She said she would fix my order, then went to the bar to chit chat with the cook and got herself a water to drink. I had to remind her again about my drink. My drink was a watered down coke with rum. Whatever.

-They usually give you bread with butter to start off while you wait for your food. When we finally got our food we had to ask for the bread,  and they acted like it was an inconvenience. 

-The yuca was not even cooked all the way. Dry. We complained that something was wrong with it and they said that's how it always was. Later they gave us the mojo that should have already been on there.

-They forgot my daughter's food completely. They didn't even get her anything to drink. Actually..

-They never brought us water. Or asked us for a refill. We had to chase them down just to get a drink. I knew they had water somewhere because of that watered down cocktail I mentioned above.

-When they brought our food the waitress didn't say the right name of the plate. We send it off and then found out it was our food but she didn't know what it was called- so she called it something completely different. Shouldn't you know your menu?

-The food was served cold. If I wanted cold food I can open my own fridge and be too lazy to heat it up myself. 

-The waitress began to show frustration with us when we kept having to get on her to do her job...shocker. Not surprising there is an attitude behind the laziness. 

-Our food came out sporadically. She kept forgetting our orders so it was never all placed at once. 

-The waitress gave my 2-year old a knife for her fries. Let that sink in for a moment. 

Here is the kicker, are you ready for this? 

The owner was watching this the entire time. He didn't care about the issues going on in front of him. He ignored us when we wanted to talk to him about the issues.

Soon after our first visit we decided to go back a second time. Now on our second time back, our experience was different. Service took a lot longer than when we went the first time. Not sure if it was because we went on a Sunday but it was a lot slower. We ordered the same dishes because we were so blown away with them from the first visit. Now, when we finally go our food, we started to eat and noticed that the flavors were off, Didn't taste the same as the first time we came. We still enjoyed our food but still wasn't the same.
Now on the 3rd visit, the experience just went way down. Not only were the flavors of the dishes way off again but the level of service also went down. Our first server seemed frustrated. After she took our order she walked off and we never saw her again.We ended up being taken care of a guy that kept forgetting dishes from our order, forgot our drinks.  Usually they give you a little basket of delicious bread before your meal. Well this time we got our bread while we were eating our main course already. we must have been half way through our meal when we received the bread basket and it wasn't fresh. It was hard as a rock and not warm at all. We were so dissapointed. We wanted to really love this place but the sudden plunge in the level of consistency in both food quality and service just completely turned us off. We haven't returned since.

The buffet is about 10 bucks and it is pretty incredible! They had empanadas, yuca con chicharron, platanos, tamales, arroz con frijoles negros, salad, and many other options which I can't name that were authentic Cuban dishes. They had at least 10 different options in their buffet and that's not including the dessert, which had about 5 different dishes plus ice cream! Did I mention, the buffet includes drinks? Where else can you find a deal this great!?

The food was so full of flavor and mouthwatering! We both got at least 3 plates, which was a little insane, but soo worth it! I've never had authentic Cuban food like this before. Being able to try their buffet was an awesome way to try many different Cuban dishes all at once.

After attacking the buffet, I went to the dessert section. I got like 2 plates of flan, some ice cream, and 2 plates of arroz con leche. Everything was delicious! 

I HIGHLY recommend trying out this buffet. You definitely get your money's worth and it's a great way to try Cuban food if you've never had it before. Although, it might spoil you for life!

2931815,2010-11-21,2,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"After driving around Vegas a little bit, I passed by the Howard Johnsons on Las Vegas Blvd and against my friend's better judgment, we tried out a little Cuban restaurant attached to the hotel: Florida Cafe.

Excellent little place. Well, excellent if you're not vegetarian. While my friend indulged in the one vegetarian entree, I had the chicken over rice with pimentos and peppers. Pretty sure it wasn't the healthiest meal in Vegas, but the taste of the fried yellow rice was enough to put the restaurant on my permanent list. And while the rice was stealing the show, the chicken (I think it was roasted) fell off the bone when I pulled at it with my fork and produced a simple and yet flavorful combination.

Cuban food, at least as done by Florida Cafe, is sweet and slightly spicy, but with a totally separate spice that other Latin or Caribbean food. It doesn't overpower like jerk (Jamaican) or feel dusted in cumin (Latin). Instead, it offers a subtle sweetness mixed with a slight spice.

While I'd heard a recommendation from someone at work, I wasn't expecting much since the restaurant was attached to a HoJos. I think the best way of explaining how good the place was is to tell that they screwed up my first drink order and served me Jack Daniels instead of Jim Beam. And I still have not a bad word to say (about the food--service is a totally different story and not what I talk about here).",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,3,7,4,OjVW-MvbDmoY3JtyKgigkA

Food was pretty good, but I have a complaint that is not just for the Florida Cafe, but for all restaurants in general.  If your menu lists what is on a sandwich, typically diners assume that is all that comes on the sandwich.  Please do not list the things that come on the sandwich, and then not include certain ones.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich, which came with lettuce, mayo and tomatoes.  There was no mention of the grilled onions, of which my sandwich was drowning in.  I don't like onions.  Learned my lesson, I guess.

Overall, the restaurant was nice.  Service was very mediocre.  At one point, I watched our waitress have a 5 minute conversation with her boyfriend in the waiting area.  We were the only people in the whole room, so I know she wasn't busy.

Food was good.  My wife ordered a salad for 8 bucks...which was some chopped up lettuce, one sliced tomato and an avacado.  Not sure she got her money's worth on that one.

Also, for those of you visiting Vegas, this restaurant is technically on the strip, but don't expect to walk there.  Take the bus.  You will thank me!",2E7m4Vj2DvxLYMs92Hobyw,0,1,3,PhdBG6kVAKp-4Ng_OXsxIg

The service is great if your Cuban or a regular, and it is just so-so if you're anyone else. 
The waitress had her hips showing, and I thought that was classless. She also refused to make eye contact with me when I needed something. (she wasn't MY server, but it was clear I was in need) 
The location, music, and décor is exactly what it should be. Maybe a little run down and some new booths are in order, but overall not a disappointment.
I have had Cubans cook me authentic food, and this is pretty close, just made in abundance. They do cook your food to order of course, but they use cheaper ingredients and it leaves you wanting a touch more of something. Not sure what, but it ALMOST hits the spot. 
They have been around for years, I would not suggest changing the menu, but simply upgrading a few things. Maybe have a specialty of the week or a secret menu. 
This is a solid average 3 star place. Nothing super amazing, but nothing truly lacking. 
They also offer live salsa music twice a week.

I keep reading about this $10 buffet which I must come back for but I will write on some items I had for lunch.

The place is located in the Howard Johnson motel in Downtown Vegas on LV Blvd.  It looks pretty seedy but there's something I like about it.  

For food, I ordered the Ropa Vieja, which is shredded beef stewed with tomatoes, bell peppers and onions.  Very flavorful.  

My friend ordered the Pierna de Purerco Asada - oven roasted leg of pork marinated in mojo of lemon, galric, lemon, lime, orange juice.  Very good too.

Some other friends ordered some items that they weren't pleased with but it could be because they just don't have an adventurous palette.

The cuban pork sandwich was pretty darn good.  It's not what you'd get in Miami but it s hard to find great Cuban food anywhere.

The menu is intense -- I'll def be back for buffet which seems to be the best pound for pound value.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,3,4,4,brg79LDKQ28nWeBD2uH2vg

Anything with chicken is awesome here! The meat falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth. I think I ordered the ""Pollo Asado with Cuban Spices"". It also comes with black rice with black beans. They told me it was just Cumin and Parsley, but it tasted a whole lot better than that. 

Me and my friend also had the Mojitos here. Both of us drink a lot frequently and we are surprised that the buzz creeped up on us so strongly. I had another half a glass and I got pretty hammered.

Prices are a bit expensive for the portions they give you, but the money is worth it for the quality of the food and drinks. It's really close to my workplace, just right up Las Vegas Blvd.

A common complaint is slow customer service. I thought the speed of service is alright, especially since I came on a slow day, Christmas Eve, where they are plenty of folks rushing to the mall to do late shopping instead.

Will I always come down here? No, I can't afford a weekly habit, but it's a really chill place for a date and I like the atmosphere.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,0,0,5,TWED8jFL5NOvgp6c0n2tiA

So I will admit, up front, that my review is likely tainted by this dilemma. Let's call it, the my-dining-companions-order-better-then-me-envy. 

I'm guilty of this at Florida Cafe.

We started out the meal with the delicious buttered bread, tostones, and yuca. The fried plantains came with a yummy garlic butter sauce. I would have drunk that sauce straight if I wasn't eating with company.

As for my entree, my favorite dish at the Cuban restaurant back home is vaca frita. I figured I would try it out here for a comparison. It is horrible to come from one place with a magnificent version of a dish to go to another with a mediocre (at best) execution of the dish. The meat, while heavy in quantity, was dry and tasted tired. It was difficult to find any flavor layered in the dish aside from fried beef. C'mon! Instead of the red beans I ordered I was served black beans which was no big deal since I appreciate both kinds. But with a heaping pile of dry vaca frita, I was left feeling let down by my plate.

Thankfully my dining companions ordered better then me or else I might think worse of this place.

One person had the bistec de palomilla empanizada. It was tender, juicy, crispy happy times. I stole a fair share of bites out of that one. The Cuban sandwich looked fantastic and was gone before I could even consider trying it.

We finished the meal with fabulous Cuban coffees. Creamy, sweet, and bold. Ahhhhh. The perfect way to end a meal.

The location is sketch. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired. But if your timing is right you can peep on people getting married across the lobby and the service in Florida Cafe is incredibly friendly.",ygO1cO77BvQtU2FutLBFtQ,0,1,3,MdD8p61dSXZdbYdBIWfFvA

In fact, it is in a rather seedy area, but it is located within a Howard Johnson's so we checked it out. Across the street is all-nude dance place. Maybe next time....

The food was very good. We started with mini-Cuban sandwiches which came with a plate of fried plantains. The plantains were not greasy at all and the sandwiches were delicious. I got some kind of chicken dish in borth (#94) and the chicken was excellent. The wife got pork from the leg and it was so soft (#81). Can't remember how to pronounce the names. Anyway, it was a really good meal. My main complaint is that although the meat was super tender and moist, neither dish had much flavor, which to me was surprising since I assumed Cuban food would be very flavorful. but both dishes were rather bland. The black beans and rice were flavorful and excellent, but the meat not so much. I would go back because I like ethnic food, but I would ask the waitress for a recommendation that had more flavor.",eZGoPMRfq2hw5LfwJg0uTA,0,2,3,0v3C53csA-pQrRtiXbBM2g

3752788,2009-04-10,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"The Florida Cafe in Las Vegas is an adventure. It's north of the Stratosphere and south of Downtown on Las Vegas Blvd, attached to the Howard Johnson Hotel (who knew these still existed?). There are lots of sex shops and wedding chapels in the area (apparently, the two things go hand in hand in Vegas - a more honest presentation if you ask me). You pull through the entry way and into the hotel courtyard/parking area and walk on into the lobby entry. Go into the Spanish style entry way off the lobby, and be prepared for the BEST breakfast in Vegas. The Desayuno Cubano is simply heaven. Eggs, Cuban Toast, fried plantains and stuffed potatoes, mashed potatoes that are filled with ground beef and some olive, shaped into balls then rolled in panko bread crumbs and fried, either served on a flat, plate sized piece of ham or not. Heaven! The staff is somewhat unattentive, but them's the breaks. You're at the friggin' Howard Johnson Hotel, not the Four Seasons. For the folks who say it's too expensive, I say go get your dollar hot dog at Slots of Fun or your average prime rib buffet, and pipe down.

3775412,2008-08-28,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"Went here with a few co-workers, including a Cuban girl. She loves the place and says she forced her husband to come with her every week when she was pregnant.

The location is pretty shady, inside a Howard Johnson on Las Vegas Blvd North. Parking is behind the motel and it's a bit of a walk, but once you get inside, the atmosphere in the hotel lobby and restaurant are nice enough. 

Service was very slow, and our waitress wasn't knowledgeable about the menu. She tried to help my friend figure out what she ordered last time, but most questions were met with an ""I don't know"". One of my, uh -- less inhibited -- friends started questioning her background - ""are you Cuban?"" ... ""no"" ...  ""are you a white girl?!"" ... ""yes, but my mother is from Peru"".

The food was good, but very overpriced. I ordered ropa vieja ($12.95), a stew of shredded beef with tomato and spices. You can choose between white rice with black or red beans, or moros y cristianos - a tasty mixture of white rice and black beans with pork broth and a few stray cubes of pork. The side of moros almost dwarfed my saucer of ropa vieja. Another friend ordered a Cuban sandwich, also overpriced at $12.95. Another asked for extra cheese on her ground beef dish and was given one of those stainless salad dressing boats full of uncooked shredded cheese, and charged $2 for it.  They did remove it from the bill when she complained, though. The total for five of us, including two sharing an entree, was $75 before tip.

Overall, the food was good, but I definitely had to dock a couple stars for the service and pricing.",g0hpMcW5zJgJHMR32f-W0g,1,1,3,e_jVQjgQPFAmZ1vs3O7s7Q

Of course he came back with the incorrect order, and I waited till the end of the meal for the mojito I ordered finally arrived. When we got the check, about 6 employees went by with their head down.

The food was uninspiring as well. We went tapas style,will say the empanadas were light and tasty. The ceviche was advertised with large shrimp, and it came with tiny cocktail ones. The cubano sandwich had a weird un-flavorful hunk of pork. The croquetts  were previously frozen. I will say the orange mojito was decent and stiff.

I looked over the menu and I also asked her suggestion.  She pointed to an oxtail stew that's not on their online menu.  I opted to take her advice.  

I started with their papas rellenas--mashed potatoes stuffed with picadillo beef and deep fried.  Presentation was very nice with two very thin plantain pieces deep freid and stuck in the papas.  There was also a small salad.

The menu said all dinners come with red or black beans and rice.  I specified black beans.  That was the first language mixup.  Not only did I get black beans with my meal but my server brought me an extra bowl of black beans because she thought I ordered an extra dish.  It was good so I ate both!

The oxtail stew was very flavorful.  I think some people might have thought the broth was salty, but it was just great for me.

Dessert order time.  I asked about the size of the tres leches cake tower with flan and coconut.  She assured me it wasn't that large and then she brought me the normal flan and not the tres leches cake.  Language problem number 2.

She asked if I wanted more Coke and I said, ""No, iced tea.""  She then brought me a Coke.  I didn't notice, but I soon had a table side science experiment.  You have no idea how Coke foams when you put artificial sweetener in it.  I managed to keep little Vesuvius from flooding the table, but I didn't drink the Coke.  Last language error.

Finally ordered the Churrasco con Chimi-Churri and it didn't disappoint... I love meat and this meal was delicious. The meal included rice and some type of sauce that you spread over the rice... the value was excellent (although we used a Groupon deal).

I ate them sooooo fast. I definitely recommend them. I got 3 cups of Cuban coffee to try to kill my withdrawals. For being outside of Miami, it was heaven in a little bascito. Then we got to the entree. The ropa veja was generally good but, as comfort food usually goes, not the way abuelita made it. The biggest problem I had with my meal was the rice and beans. If you are Cuban you know, the rice and beans are sacred. I was disappointed that the rice was hard and the beans were missing. It was basically just the black bean sauce. Very disappointing. I grabbed some pastilitos and left. It wasn't a horrible experience because I'm trapped in vegas. It still brought me home.",zKAwyRCGNpZ0fHu67YBUrg,2,1,4,pcTMkNpATjkkB98FMCo6Bw
4484145,2014-10-03,0,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"I've been to Florida's Cafe Cuban 3 times over the past several years.  The food is very good and authentic.

Why do I say it is authentic?  My husband was born in Cuba, his grandmother and sisters are excellent cooks.  While we haven't had everything on the menu, what we have had was delicious.  i loved the bread, so crispy and light.

My finicky Uncle scraped his plate clean.  My mom, who is a picky eater, was quiet throughout her meal.

I really enjoyed the picadillo empanadas.  Very tasty, the pastry crust was light and flaky.  We had the arroz con pollo and it was very well seasoned and was way, way better than what we make at home.  

We also split the pan con lechon.  The sandwich was so good.  For American palates, the meat is a little dry, but you could ask for a bit more mojo for the sandwich, I suppose.  

The yucca was well seasoned, cooked to a soft consistency and served with onions and chicharones as well.  

There was no food left over, but my mom, aunt and uncle are up there in years and don't eat that much.  

We didn't get dessert at the restaurant, but did buy some at the bakery to take home.  Flan is really good and is not heavy.

I would highly recommend including Florida Cuban Cafe in your meal planning.

I must add that the service was exceptional.  Dealing with 3 hard of hearing older people who eat very slowly and don't always understand what is going on around them can be difficult for the waitstaff.  They never blinked an eye, and were polite and understanding.",m6HaiTWI-OcfD9z0WdoPqA,2,0,5,6ZN7YxqGR0TOuMp9qKGlgA

Parking: 
easy since its located in a hotel

Decor/layout:
Its a bar with a restaurant seating area. Kinda divey but maybe thats the vibe they want to give off?


Food:
I ordered the ""el americano"" and wow was I shocked. Eggs cooked good - over easy. Toast - dry no butter and cold. Ham 2 pieces - deli sliced like something you buy at your local meat market, thinly sliced. Hashbrowns - deep fried patty, like what you get at a fast food joint. Say what!? And cold. 
Husband ordered the Cuban sandwich (recommended by our server) that same thinly sliced deli ham with cheese and avocado on a small roll. With fries - decent but cold. I tried his sandwich and it was good but small portion. 

Service:
Excellent

We were the only ones in the restaurant and they couldn't get the food right? Maybe for dinner it is better.. I really don't get it. It was overpriced and not very good. Big disappointment.",BJ90REqniYlrguVJutB4kg,3,1,2,1x1cNMTxafGRs19XnQiNAw

I would go to Florida Cafe once a week until I moved back to Portland in 08. Every time I visit Vegas I have to go back, and I bring everyone who is with me lol. My fave is the pollo a la plancha with black beans.  I hate a yummy skirt steak dish though this time at the recommendation of my waitress.... and oh how good it was. My BF and his brother ordered my usual and we're blown away at how fresh and yummy it was(it was the first time for them). My girlfriend ordered her usual Cuban sandwich and was happy as always.  I also ordered the side of sweet fried plantains and a coconut water.  Every thing was devoured, no take home boxes needed and all for $57!

4884716,2010-09-10,2,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"I was not impressed by Florida Cafe.  Many of the reviews I have read from Yelp and other review sites said it was the best cuban restaurant in Las Vegas, but I highly disagree.  My roommate and I came in for lunch on Sunday, and were a bit confused by the location, which is located inside of a Howard Johnson a little north of the strip.  Location is not a big deal to me, though, so I didn't think much of it.  

We ate in the cafe section, because the other section was closed off for a buffet, but we wanted to judge the restaurant on their everyday menu, and not a special weekend buffet.  The service was very average, and didn't put our order in until about 20 minutes after being seated.  But service isn't a big deal to me, as long as the food pulls through.  

We ordered an order of Croquetas, and an Empanada.  The croquetas were the worst I have ever had.  Very small, and lacking in flavor.  The outside was a little bit crispy, and the inside was dry and flavorless.  The empanada was pretty good, but nothing too special.  For our entrees, I ordered the Roasted Leg of Pork (pierna de puerco), which is a staple at any cuban restaurant.  My roommate ordered the steak sandwich.  Neither of us were very pleased.  The sandwich was okay, but didn't have much going on.  The leg of pork was tender, but overly oily, and did not have much of the bitter orange and garlic flavor that Pierna de Puerco usually has.  

Overall, we were very disappointed, and will probably not come back because there is a better cuban place closer to me.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,2,1,2,MdnPAxBd0fou10sLJ1RCHQ

A few friends suggested coming here as they haven't been in a long time as well and a few in our party never been. 

We shared appetizers of - 

Jamon Croquettas - so think of if ham were fish sticks, then that would be this. Interesting, but I wouldn't get it again. 

Chicarones - these were served warm and were nicely crunchy. Solid chicaron. 

And they serve you white bread rolls slathered in butter. 

The BF and I shared - 

Cuban Sandwich with fries - This was a decent sandwich, but not the best I've had. Get it with the plaintain chips if you're into them as someone in our party got those and I thought that was better as the fries are standard. 

Pernil de Cerdo Asado - the pork was pretty tender and the red beans were pretty good. I feel it was missing something like a sauce though. I order something similar in LA and it's in a mojo sauce and I could have sworn eons ago when I was here last my meat was more citrusy. 

Service was just OK. Sometimes it seemed like they didn't really care and seemed to mishear us a lot. ""Okay, french fries"" ""No, chicarones."" ""Oh okay"". ""Chuletas de Cerdo"" ""No, Pernil de Cerdo"" ""Oh'. Someone got black beans instead of what they actually ordered. 

It's a unique place with some charm. I feel it was slightly better years ago when we used to go. I remember really loving the pork back then, but I didn't feel the love as much now.

Note to the reviewer who wants to know how to make ropa vieja, get a copy of ""The Coumbia Restaurant Cookbook"", and a crockpot. You'll have what you need to do it.

Really like the food here. Its the most authentic I've found in Las Vegas. I am from Tampa, FL, my father was from Latin America, we lived in Cuba pre, during and post Castro. I grew up on this cuisine and can rattle those pots and pans with the best of them. 

I introduced my friends who live in LV to this cuisine, and they are hooked. Every time I visit, I get takeout for all of us at least once. Big favorite is the picadillo, which is outstanding.  Nice big olives, and tons of flavor. Ropa is also wonderful as is tbe chicken and yellow rice. You can tell with that dish the rice was cooked in the broth of the chicken. It wasnt made with one pot of premade yellow rice, add sauteed chicken pieces. Nope, this is made homestyle. The stuffed potatoes are excellent. They are nice and crispy, not greasy. The filling is excellent, and they use real mashed potatoes, not instant. If these are frozen, I'd be shocked. 

Cuban sandwich is authentic. Its too bad Cuban bread isn't available in LV. Fricasse de pollo is suck your fingers good. Last time I got food they were out of this dish :(

Florida Cafe seems to be comfortable staying with what they do best; serving up Cuban soul food. Last time I was in town I tried to get takeout from some of the other Cuban restaurants.

Cassava root has the texture of potato or yam. Sticky. Stringy. It was possibly buttery as well and the garlic sauce permeated throughout. It added, I believe, to the flavor. 

But it was the crispy curled pork skins that offered that porky bacony hamesque pork deliciousness flavor. All together the tastes and textures, crispy mushy garlicky, merged to make a unique edible. I do not regret my decision. I will remember fondly Yuca al Mojo con Chicharrón in Las Vegas.

5373596,2011-04-08,1,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"After seeing all the advertisements around town, I was determined to give Florida Cafe a try. A friend had passing the qualifying tests to become a PhD student. What a perfect opportunity for a celebratory lunch. 

Attached to the Howard Johnson on Las Vegas Boulevard, you can easily miss the parking lot if you don't read the sign quick enough. The turn into the motel leads to the parking for both establishments. The decorum is dark and most of the tables are set up for family style eating. It does not matter if you are a party of 1 or 10, you probably will be sat at the same size table. If it is busy, do not be surprise if you end up with a random stranger sitting next to you. This can be nice if you are a social person and don't mind small chat. 

There were two people serving in the entire restaurant. It was not that busy, but one guys was running around doing everything. Although service was lacking, and the food was slow, he was friendly. It took a little more than half an hour for our order to come. We thought it was just us, but everyone around us were complaining to themselves as well.

The food is nothing impressive. I know I ripped into Mi Peru, but Florida Cafe makes the former seem perfect. Still confused about the difference between most of Latin cuisine, I ordered the arroz con pollo. I am out on a quest to at least find the best version of this dish in Vegas. The rice was fluffy, but greasy and overly salty. The mixed in pieces of peas and potatoes were a nice addition. The bell peppers tasted like they were pickled, but oily at the same time. I have never came across this combination before. At this point, I missed the pickled onions that I got at Mi Peru. The dish came with a side of beans, three pieces of plantains, and two chicken drumsticks. The overall temperature of the meal was cooler than room temperature. It was not cold, but was getting there. My favorite side dish to any Cuban meal, the plantains were old and chewy instead of hot, crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. My friend ordered a Cuban. It was also really salty and the pulled pork was dry. 

I was told that they open the buffet on the weekends and it is a better deal. I am just glad that my group is going out again tonight, because this was more of a punishment than a celebration of a job well done.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,2,uL7TCMbnJRrJNS0WqTemjQ

I must admit, we had a nice-sized party of around 17 people. I understand that this can be stressful for servers and cooks but a restaurant on Las Vegas Boulevard, connected to a hotel as well as being adjacent to a ""Little White Wedding Chapel"" should be prepared for something like this. 

The starters took forever to arrive which consisted of a plate of bread and some plantain chips. We were HANGRY by the time this made it to the table. The food was reasonable. I might be biased because I grew up in cuba around authentic food so I didn't find it fascinating. To make things short, our food took way too long to arrive and they got most of our orders wrong. Some of the stuff they brought out, nobody had ordered. 

For being a Saturday night, they were dead, which is also why they shouldn't have gotten so many things wrong. There's no one else to tend to! 

After dinner they charged us for a bunch of stuff that they brought out that nobody in our party ordered, so we had to analyze the bill and explain to them what we ordered and what we actually got (because keep in mind some of the stuff I actually ordered never made it to the table).

The Florida sandwich a la locura is a flattened chicken breast served on a giant round roll and topped with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, cheese and mayo - even skipping the cheese and mayo it winds up being good for two or three meals. 

The arroz con pollo is delicious and I'm wishing i had some right now - the chicken is flavorful and the yellow rice with pimentos and peppers is incredibly flavorful, made all the more so by the fact that there's a bit of crisp to the rice like at the bottom of a paella.

Appetizers worth seeking out include the tostones with ropa vieja and the chorizo frito. As for the sopa de frijoles negros, I have cravings about this ridiculously good soup, topped with pungent slivers of white onion. I recommend liberally spiking this hearty soup with the green habanero hot sauce on the tables.

So then why am I only giving Florida Cafe three stars? Because it may have the most consistently poor service of any restaurant I frequent in Las Vegas. Slow, unaccommodating, absentee service is frustrating when the food is this good.

Actually, I thought the inside was pretty cute-- there were palm trees painted on the walls and the bar had bongos for stools.  

Our waitress wasn't the most friendly person and another waitress kept bringing us drinks and food and sounded like she was apologizing for the slowness of the first waitress, but I couldn't really tell.  For drinks, the husband had a gin and tonic and I had a mango mojito (which took a long time to make).  The tostones (fried plantains) and shrimp  sounded good for appetizer, so we ordered that.  There were six plantain patties and we simply couldn't finish the app.  My husband had his standard ropa vieja for dinner with rice and beans and I had the arroz con pollo.  My dish, although savory, had sweet plantains on top of the rice, which was a little strange and didn't fit very well, but since I love plantains, I didn't mind too much.  The portions were very large and I could only finish about a third of my dish.  In addition, the arroz con pollo came with a black bean soup.

Pros;

It is a unique place.  It has it has a charm to it.  It's different.

The food was tasty.  I had roasted pork with red beans and rice.  It did seem to be missing something like a sauce or something.  It was meat - rice - beans... I was wondering if Cuban food comes with some type of condiment or something...

One major plus was the Mojito!!

Cons;

It was not very busy but they had the few guests jammed into 3 booths in a corner of the restaurant.  I am sure this is for a server convenience thing but I would have like to spread out a bit.  Also,  The booth was missing half the padding in the back and it was just covered over.  

The appetizer was a fried potato thing.  It was 2 golf ball size fried mashed potato balls with a little meat.  Not exactly generous.  Maybe if they had some cavier on it or something.

This place is in a terrible location.  I was confused as hell.  The parking is in the back of the Howard Johnson.  Then you walk through the hotel.  It was weird.  Luckily my friend knew how to get into this place.

Service was ho-hum.

The manager approached us and asked, Did you find a cell phone here.""  I am okay with helping someone recover lost property.  I would have preferred if the manager said, ""exceuse me for interupting your dinner, but someone lost a cell phone do you mind if we look real quick.""  I guess it isn't a big deal but it rubbed my rhubarb the wrong way.

The prices seem to be pricey too.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,1,2,JtRz_BZKH6-QzWJ-0yYCfA

If you're stuck up or too good to eat at a small restaurant that serves authentic food, then it's your loss. Don't be stuck up and miss out!",IUMZPb307ORS9YcWb6xYMw,0,1,5,2e_LnhY6aXkK_V0a8nT-wQ

...Florida Cafe turned out to be a huge letdown for me.  For years, I've wanted to try this place that I keep hearing about from people, seeing ads for on bus stops...

So one night after CES, we made last minute reservations to go.  They weren't busy...I mean, seriously, who goes to a HoJo (Howard Johnson) for dinner?  (Apparently, they're also big on weddings - saw a wedding party and huge limo milling around the parking area.)

As I said, our starter, the potato balls were great.  That got us even more excited for our actual food.  We shared the following:

FC's ""Famous"" black bean soup - Served not quite hot, which was strike #1...and basically it was just...beans.  A big ole bowl of black beans cooked for a long time.  They weren't great, flavorful or anything. It congealed as it cooled and after about 10 minutes, was no longer in the realm of appetizing.

Cuban Sandwich - Unlike the soup, this dish was served lava-hot.  Even 20 minutes after it was served to us, we still burnt our tongues on the cheese.  Though not as disappointing as the soup, the sandwich was still underwhelming.  There was no real flavor that stood out.  The ""pickled"" veggies that they put in the sandwich weren't nearly noticeable.

Beans & Rice - Ok...really?  Cubans make their rice with Uncle Ben's boil in a bag dealio?  Really.  The description of the dish mentioned black beans mixed in with pork bits.  Delicious right?  Wrong.  I got myself a big plate of terribleness.  It smelled like instant rice and tasted like it.  I like how the rice comes served molded in a bowl which they lift away as they present it to you. My, how that Uncle Ben's rice scattered as soon as the bowl was taken away.  What's the point of molding it?

Service was decent and for that and the potato balls, I'm giving FC 3 stars thought I quite believe I'm being very generous.",ENgL9AxV7uu-v5EUCpF69Q,1,2,3,I6-Xj-RdApGCzW4ZsUvGAQ
5642489,2017-09-10,1,aGDo7GDN5YLvpYykpSLkbw,"Where to start.  I come from Miami Florida.  I haven't been for a whole and miss Cuban food.  I heard about this place from an Uber Driver who is Cuban himself and decided to try it.

Boy do I regret it.  I will say the place is clean. And good atmosphere and service decent. The little things.  Ask for desperate checks before we ordered.  In English and in Spanish.  I saw waitress desperate when wrote order down yet brought check and all was mixed.  She said oh yeah I forgot.  Yeah small I know.

Food ordered a tamale it tasted weird and was gooey not what a Cuban tamale should be like.  Again I'm use to places in Miami.  Rice and beans in one plate with plantains or yuca.  And then mail protein on another plate.  Well was disappointed here.  I ordered Ropa Vieja (shredded beef) rice and beans and small bowl with beef on same plate.  The beef bowl would be considered a cup of soup in most places. A side of yuca was bigger.  Now as I said in Miami all would be a meal and just looked it up in nice classy Miami Cuban restaurant 10.50 for ropa Vieja and 2.50 for soda.

This place?  Ropa Vieja 14.00 side yuca 5.00 soda 3.00 $22 plus tax plus tip.  So cost way more for way less.

All that equals thanks but never again.... Sad and the search continues for decent Cuban food",9wbwgpcUbW7FECxXDv6jMw,3,1,2,3_Y0TkDfUg_PosJaxjIDKA

The place was really clean and the staff was pretty much on top of things. We came on a Saturday at noon.  
The food: we have had some authentic Cuban down in Tampa. So I have some good Cuban to compare the food to.  My husband and I got different dishes and an appetizer. The appetizer was the Papa rellenas con aioli !! Omg this was really good and flavorful.  My meal was ropa vieja and his was arroz con polla.  We tried each others and they both were really good.

Would be a lot better if some of the items were cooked to a higher temperature, but I digress. There's a good looking bakery next door  but sadly no one to sell us any of the items.

Sometimes the foods great and the service sucks or vice versa. I can never seem to get both at the same time. The past couple of times I've eaten here I've found that the food was bland. The maduros tasted like it was fried earlier that day then microwaved when ordered. The beans were lukewarm along with the dish. It seems like they cooked all the food earlier and reheated it when I ordered it. The Sangria was the only thing that was decent. The service was good AFTER the waitress decided to come to our table to help us which took a while.  The Yuca con Mojo used to be really good here but the other day it was dry and tasteless.
