Don't ask for a custom order because they rarely get it right the first time. If they got an all new staff it might be worth it to eat inside but until then drive thru works just fine.",8w0WHaqx6X2Etr96G1qT4A,1,0,2,wJvAc7a3M6nQdNcQM44Onw
620209,2017-11-18,0,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"When in Las Vegas NV. Do not eat at this Taco Bell. They are rude and arrogant to the point of not apologizing, refunding or offer to replace the meal when the order is incorrect. No offers to replace the order or refund the money even with a receipt. They blame the customer instead of their staff when an order is incorrect. The management staff when asked if this was a franchise or corporate store the answer was a franchise. When management was asked for the franchise name and contact information he (Manager Andy) said he did not know that information. He said he did not know who he worked for or who pays him. Imagine that! Called 800-TACO-BELL to find out who the franchise owner is and to get the contact information but Taco Bell's corporate customer service is only available 11am-7pm eastern time. Imagine that. A world of slackers and they are proud of it.",hvXl5aiT9f9-yXt-R2B46w,0,0,1,a5FphdM8OwAQJxltrKzFig

I always order the spicy potato soft taco! It's a soft shell with crispy potatoes, lettuce, shredded cheese, and a creamy chipotle sauce. The original potato soft taco was good but I love spicy foods so the creamy chipotle sauce really makes it. The spicy tostada is also good! I tried the new cheesy bean and rice burrito the other day. It's a new $1 item too. If you like refried beans, rice, nacho cheese, and a creamy jalape√±o sauce then this burrito is for you. It is definitely worth a dollar, it's pretty big. I will be back because this location is great. All of the staff I have encountered have been nice and my order was right every time. The food is also yummy for fast food! It's also open until 2-3am which is convenient.",f1XbbdfPcBz7JeF1RzMG_A,3,1,4,1dFzlYHvNyPJJ0rbP-XSSw

803450,2016-05-10,0,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"Best taco bell ever!!! As a young man, fast food keeps me alive so I eat a lot of it. I have been to Taco Bells in about every state in America and many in other countries. I don't usually yelp about it. But his place was like a world class taco bell. 
I went in Monday May 8th about 1:30pm. Orders a very large take out order. The girl at the cashier was so sweet and kind. She was patient and precise.  
The order came out in like 4 minutes. I was shocked. The lady who brought it SHOCKINGLY (never has this happened to me before), she took the time to compare the food against the receipt in front of me to show me how everything was there. And it all was. The cashier was quick to get sauces and offer plenty of them. 
The food was all made correctly, great flavors and tasted better than normal. 

Best Taco Bell ever.",D7fqBHhpSTX4tpCcvqQkAQ,0,0,5,CzDpBIhgtvRxxkRTMbbDYQ

1340386,2015-10-29,0,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"I went into taco bell today Oct 28, 2015 between 2:30 and 3:00pm one by meadows mall.  I asked the cashier for two boxes of tacos with the cool ranch an mix tacos. Before I removed my food off the counter I told the manager who gave me my food and the cashier my order was wrong. Apparently they didn't care about customer service. So I want your Cooperate number because here at the taco bell you  service customers what you want, you didn't listen when I told  you the order was incorrect the tacos are not the same you telling me they are. A manager an the cashier customer service unprofessional. My incorrect order was $40 dollar's and some cents.

It's a shame I have went to Taco Bell today 10/29/2015 and spoke to the supervisor Miss Rita she was RUDE know better then the employee that was getting rid of me yesterday when I said my order was incorrect. Apparently it was a problem rita ""tells me why you didn't ask for yesterday""  I said excuse me why your employee didn't listen and just change my order? know response, your cashier rung up what i ask for you employee should have check it again are apparently wasn't able to read that we'll. And Rita had a problem she had to stop and whisper something in another employee ear. Rita didn't apologize didn't try to fix the situation do everyone there have bad customer service? We'll I place a call to cooperate let's see what action takes place. That was money wasted and bad customer service both days

Well the supervisor don't care either one call she didn't apologized and another supervisor never return my call",tqKcZQcPFOxdRHy19agRVQ,0,0,1,RHcJsiOz0l5D64dfGHzncA
2010536,2014-08-15,11,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"I can't even begin to understand the sense of power and responsibility that must come with being entrusted with a squirt-gun full of sour cream, but apparently they don't give lessons on calibration.

Without fail, no matter what specific burrito I order, no matter how many times I say ""light sour cream"" or even ""NO sour cream"", there's inevitably one end of my burrito that is absolutely filled with the stuff.

I usually order twice as much as I actually want to eat, because I can reliably take a bite at one end or the other, determine which end doesn't have a mouthful of sour cream, and eat half of it. Then proceed to the next one, do the same, and toss the cream-soaked halves.

It's exhausting and wasteful but luckily one only gets a Taco Bell burrito craving every couple of months, when one's life is going on a spectacularly bad turn and you just want to eat the pain away.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,1,1,2,PmrDaL_Jeg4X7dAS_A4VrA

He is amazing! His personality, his demeanor, his excitement, and manners make for such a pleasant experience. His name is Patrick(fluffy hair, glasses) and he deserves a raise.

I think of it as a high end slurpee!  If you catch it right, you can get a med for $1 between 2pm and 5pm.  The reason for the three star is 3 out of every five orders is wrong or incomplete.  You really have to check you bag carefully before you leave.  I believe this may be a training location.

4036752,2018-04-14,0,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"Sometimes you just get a craving for Taco Bell and guess what I was so glad that there was one around to fulfill that need. I placed my order as usual at the front counter and the clerk was very polite and knew his job. He seemed to be fulfilling multiple positions and met his goal too with a smile. He took orders at the front counter and then excused himself to the drive thru to take care of that customer. With the precision that he handled the front counter and the drive thru they should give him a raise or promote him.

Bravo to the cooks since they made my Mexican pizza to order and looked like it should, appetizing. I was so glad to be a customer at this Taco Bell today and will be again when the itch comes around.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,0,0,5,qGJ_cZ0zHVCLN5o60eK18w

The service here has been great on the few occasions I've visited, which I think is pretty cool. I mean, these places don't pay their guys the best which sometimes leads to not the best service. However, it's great here. Everyone was cool taking my orders, the food came out quick, and there were smiles and ""thank you""'s all the time. 

The food here was awesome by Taco Bell standards. It was pretty good, the food was hot, and it came out quick. Really, nothing to complain about at all.",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,1,1,3,kqs_X7of9yY61S1ykyYDmQ
5000772,2016-02-15,2,kvxSYzWonG0Gf0TlOF0nkA,"There was a homeless guy snoring, laid out in the only large booth here. They took turns trying to rouse him as he yelled curse words at them. The final time he did get up and had cookie pieces stuck all over his face. I won't count any of that in this review, though.
 I ordered Nacho Bell Grande nachos and Mexican Pizza, for here. The pizza didn't have any visible sauce on it, and o knew it wasn't hiding under the cheese because there wasn't much of that either. There were a lot of anemic  tomatoes that looked and tasted like Bunnicula the Rabbit and attacked the garden. 
 The nachos were freezing cold, which didn't matter because the A/C would have gotten it anyway. 
 After the homeless guy was roused they cleaned every vacant table like they were afraid he may have left the herpes virus jumping like said Bunnicula from flat surface to flat surface.
 It is very clean in here and even in the face of being mistreated during the removal of Sleepy they maintained a pleasant professional manner.
 Next time I feel like sub par fast food I'll return, in  a year or two when it sounds good again.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,2,2,3,4wveaZt_HU-p2GlJY_s68A
