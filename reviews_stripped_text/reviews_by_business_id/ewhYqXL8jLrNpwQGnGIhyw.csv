339680,2013-07-30,1,ewhYqXL8jLrNpwQGnGIhyw,"my girlfriend got a carne asada burrito here Sunday and I got to finish half of it.  sooooooooooooo yummy!!!  everything inside worked so well together, making my mouth very happy!

so I stopped there on my way home and got the ceviche (shrimp) tostada (only $3.50!!) and camerones ranchero (at $10.95 the most expensive thing on the menu).  
the ceviche was excellent!  a good sized serving, I would have been happy to pay $6-7 for it! 
the camerones ranchero was also a good sized serving with plenty of shrimp. very tasty.

they have a very large menu, including breakfast and desert items.  prices run pretty cheap.  burritos for $4.95 and tacos were around $1.50 each.

good + cheap + good portions + open 24/7 = 5 stars!",uftVgvFArubrcsuXu7fEfg,2,1,5,_LDMWE-mjsLWxNA1sAACgA

The staff are super-nice, the food is almost always excellent, the price is right, giant portions, it is super-clean, etc. I have three faves: 1. Pollo asado nachos. It's not even on the menu, but it's amazing. Rather than nachos with carne asada, the grilled/griddled marinated chicken is fantastic. 2. Pollo asado burrito with lettuce, chz, and sour cream. Fantastic. and 3. Bacon/chz burrito. Make sure to ask if you want the bacon crispy. Really good stuff.",5sDwUoGQqGh_Xsn7yZR0QA,2,0,4,Zc_-M3Xw9U5kip1De1BbAg

I understand they messed up and the guy was really nice but the girl who was the cashier was very rude and condescending. She treated me like I was trying to steal the money they over charged me.

Not dissimilar to Roberto's, Gerardo's has roughly the same basic menu and comparable (if not a smidge lower) pricing. Staff is polite, but it's a one-man show so if you go with a group be prepared to wait. More of a grab-and-go kind of place.

Didn't notice a chile relleno on the menu, but they have tons of burritos (including breakfast), tacos, menudo on weekends, and a low priced daily special.

I'm a Southern California girl. When I'm hungry and short on time, my first restaurant instinct is naturally a taco shop. And trust me when I say--I know my tacos.
Since I was having a formal dinner not too long afterwards, I ordered a beef taco and enchilada plate combo with rice and beans. I wasn't too impressed with the salsa choices, nor the enchilada sauce, but everything hit the spot the way Mexican food always does. The rice and beans were standard tasting, but the lady behind the counter was super nice and patient as I searched the menu for my favorite dishes.

I bit into bits of onions, but that's not pico de gallo. There were no tomatoes or cilantro in their ""pico de gallo"".  

The meat was a bit chewy and I could tell it had been sitting around. It had the taste of old meat. It was passable if you add hot sauce to mask the flavor. But, next time IF I go back, I'd rather just have the rice and bean burrito (not sure if they have one).  BTW, the hot (red) sauce was neither spicy nor salty enough for me.

5543390,2014-10-16,0,ewhYqXL8jLrNpwQGnGIhyw,"So after a few days in Vegas and doing everything we could to give the hotel/casino a shot... We simply realized that in hotel foods are just a bit too pricy when it comes to quality vs quantity vs price. Soooo, trusty old Yelp by our side, we click that Nearby button.... 
We see a bunch of thins pop up (duh it's vegas)... But one sticks out. Mexican place names Gerardo's... Decent reviews, seemingly decent price... And we are moving to El Paso Texas in a few months...why not? Let's try it. Plus they had a wal-Mart and petco in same shopping center. Needed some sundries and wanted to look at ferrets.. And fish... And maybe a rabbit... And a super cool climbing post for the cat that I don't even have. Win-win-win. 
The place was small. Bright colors on the walls.. Big mural. Black and white tiled floors. Few people inside, nothing fancy. Food was served on styrofoam plates... Cut back on overhead maybe? The tv was playing shows from a channel that spoke only a language in which neither my Japanese wife nor I can understand! What is this place?!? Who cares... FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! Wow. And fiiiiilllllliiiiinnngggg! It's been 3 hrs and I'm still full! Wow. I loved it, wife loved it... We will be back. 
My wife ordered the chicken taco with cheese enchilada. It came with beans and rice. Lettuce, tomatoes, maybe some onions? Salsa verde or rojo.. Cheese of course. She loved it. 
I'm a simple guy.. Looked up at the daily specials, Thursday says ""rolled tacos: 5 and drink for $3.99"". So I asks the lady... Hey girl, is a rolled taco a fluata? She said Si, and explained it in detail. It was a fluata, or at least what I know it as... 5 of them and a drink for $4? But wait, ya'll know I hate veggies or anything green... So I asks the lady.. Orale señorita,... Can I get sour cream on top instead of guacamole? She said Si.... Then hit me with a pregunta of her own... Oye guedo, you want beef, or chicken? 
I ordered the beef and said you know what, lemme get a cheese quesadilla... Cuz I'm white and hungry and a fried Tortilla filled with one cheese is right up my alley! 
But seriously... Place doesn't look like much... Food doesn't even look like much... But TRUST me it is very very tasty. Very inexpensive. Very filling. I finished all 5 of mine and the quesadilla... But it wasn't easy.. And I sat for about 5 before rolling out. Wife didn't finish hers.. That's normal though. The entire meal including tax cost us $17 exactly. So those of you vacationing here should know that, that is a deal. $17 to feed two people and good portion size and taste? Yea... A Vegas must! Unless you own the Wynn or Encore or Trump Towers... I mean the windows are made of gold... Pretty sure Donald doesn't give a Fuhhh about Thursday's rolled taco special. He is pretty thrifty though... Maybe I'll see him there? Hmmm 
Now being from Cali, living in El Paso, and visiting Mexico; naturally I've had better. But, my wife has had limited experience with authentic Mexican food and she said this was best she's ever had. And ya know, while I've had better, this was FOR SURE good. I liked it a lot and while in Vegas, I'll surely and gladly go back. All 2 staffers were very nice, food very cheap, taste very good. Menu selection/options hella decent. Please, if you're a tourist in Vegas like me.. Check it out... The food will fill you up so you can eat a light dinner and fit into that ridiculous sequined outfit you brought with you... And the money you save you can use to lose at the blackjack tables that you don't actually know how to play at... Winning situation all around... And it starts at Gerardo's... 
P.s. They have menudo too... So get your drunk ass down there and cure that hangover. Take a cab though... Drinking and drive is more than stupid and illegal, it's dangerous for you... And me... 
Vamos ala comer guay!

It was not hard to find, if you just follow your eyes toward the flashing neon lights to the left Walmart (at night).

The place is kept clean, I saw the lady working there mop the floor like hourly.  The yellow floor might be wet hazard warning system is stationed just inside the door like a sentry.  This Mexican fast food restaurant was also not very busy when I arrived just after 9pm on a Monday. There was a couple finishing up what they had ordered, and another person came in as I was getting ready to head out with my to go order.

I glanced over their menu, which was pretty standard stuff compared to their peers and eventually settled on the Carne Asada Burrito (not a big burrito, but the taste was good and the price is very reasonable at $4.95) and a Strawberry filled Churros (fried nice and crispy and dusted with a lot of plenty of sugar, the strawberry filling was just okay). The entire bill with taxes came out to $6.43 exactly, so it was definitely a budget friendly meal without the frills. 

Their Salsa Bar is also kept very clean and the ingredients all look fresh and appetizing.  I took samples of the four salsas available and they were all decent to good. Just writing this brief review and looking over their to go menu, makes me want to drive back now to try out their Super Nachos ($7.30) or one of their soft tacos ($2.25 each).

What do I look forward to next time I drop in?  If I plan it right, I will be back on another Monday and get their Monday Super Special (Chicken Burrito Combo with a soda for just $3.99) or their 99 cents Chicken or Ground Beef Tacos on Wednesdays. For those that needs a hang over cure, Menudo are available on weekends.

Service:  Friendly and quick.
Price:  Good price to value ratio
Taste:  Good (but only based on the 1 burrito I have tried thus far)
Ambiance:  No frills, except for the nice wall mural.  If you stare at their wall mural long enough, you too can magically transport yourself to East LA with a little imagination.

Accepts American Express but not BitCoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Ripple, and countless others related virtual currencies.

Tony's Trip Tips:
There is an Alkaline Water self serve filling station just next door ($2/gallon), you can get your Mexican fix and healthful water on the same trip.  Very time and eco-friendly.
