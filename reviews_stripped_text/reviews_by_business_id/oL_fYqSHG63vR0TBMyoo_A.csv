79570,2017-10-09,0,oL_fYqSHG63vR0TBMyoo_A,I was really grossed out to see the cooks in the back eating their own sandwiches while leaning over the food they made for me. I actually threw it out after one bite. I had the Pesto caprese and it was basically all bread and their food in one sandwich. The smoothie I had was delicious but I really hate that they are not descrete about eating food. At least TRY to hide it from the customers! And it took them 10 minutes to figure out who was going to help me. Each worker would say hi and walk away but not actually stand at the register to help me. That was really weird. Would not spend my money here again. I also wanted to give feedback with the survey provided on my receipt and the survey wasn't even available!,AVoec6PiUfKuqJPeHVbFwg,0,0,1,ZB4CQe-4lzOUG2ymPlPdaw
823418,2015-06-09,3,oL_fYqSHG63vR0TBMyoo_A,"Im making a public complaint toward the manager in this location. She is a white female adult with blonde short hair. 

The cashier made a mistake. But fail to even say sorry. Calls the manager and tells the manager something else.

My bill totaled $6.04 I gave $5 Cash and eith that cash I gave my card and asked the cashier ""can I put the rest in the card?"" She takes them and nods her head yes. 

Later realized she did something wrong. Tells me ""what did you want me to do with the $5 because it went through your card anyway"" I smile and try be polite. But am disappointed. 

She and the manager confront me. Manager says,"" So you gave her the card first?"" I said, ""No. I gave her both cash and the card and told her to charge the rest on the card."" She looks at the cashier and says,""You took both?"" 

Its obvious she lied to her manager or some miscommunication. Regardless what disappoints me to put her on blast here is this. 

She tells me ""I dont understand it already went through. It will take 3 days til it refunds back to you. "" So i respond ""I dont have sufficient funds on the card that is why I gave the $5. Just refund my money back."" She says ""but it already went through? Do you still want the drink?"" I said ""No. Just please refund my money."" The she says ""Well just letting you know itll take 3 days"" 

Fuck you! You disrespectful bitch! You dont deserve to be a manager! You dont even have any decency to apologize! Its not my fault your cashier made a mistake. If she didnt understand she should have asked me to assure it. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE is a priority!! I will write to the company. It seems like your so use to treat customers the way you do. 

Well, Im not letting this slide. You ruined my day! No wonder your cashier doesnt know how to apologize she gets it from you!",8Yh9WteuOxYLCRnLkREfyQ,2,0,1,6JtoAK7tlR7fmuBCVH6P6Q

Terrible customer service.  I'm standing in line while a staff member is talking about her nails with a couple other girls who are buying a smoothie.  She had already given them the smoothie to them.  She makes eye contact with me and walks to the back. She totally ignored me. 

Then some guy buds in front of me and they serve him.  Then another guy comes up to the line and another clerk proceeds to ask him for his order.  I interrupted him and said I'm next.  Both guys were apologetic. 

The manager told me I shouldn't be afraid to approach the counter. I called him on that BS,  he didn't even acknowledge me and I was where the waiting point for the next person is supposed to be and I knew what I wanted to order.  All I can say is WTF!

Terrible service.

I ordered turkey cuban panini and being that i used to work at a food joint who serves this sandwhich i knew exactly whats suppose to be in the sandwhich. Just my luck, when i got my sandwhich it was basically a turkey and cheese sandwhich. NO pickles or mustard when its suppose to have those two main ingredients. To make matters worse, i went back with my sandwhich and politely (even with a smile) asked if i could get some pickles and mustard added because there weren't any. The cashier was nice to accommodate me and even offered to make me a new one. She said, ""you deserve what you paid for"". I appreciated her for that, however, the lady (hispanic middle aged) employee gets mad at me for asking for pickles and mustard, and to top it off looks to her co-workers and starts talking in Spanish. They all glare at me with ugly looks as if i was the one at fault. I just wanted a properly made cuban sandwhich! The hispanic lady rudely drops the pickles at the counter and sends me on my way. She tells the cashier not to make my sandwhich and even argues a bit with her. I lost my appetite after that. I've never experienced such poor service. I paid $12 to get this crap.

Management needs to get their stuff together or they should just close down already. Don't display a menu you can't make correctly. False advertisement. Very very very disappointed.",JkSMnRFq4a-VkYhhgwSKXw,2,1,1,LOCln7_njamEbvVGrxWP_A
1757305,2014-11-23,3,oL_fYqSHG63vR0TBMyoo_A,"Review for adjacent Banana's Smoothies counter- if you view the receipts posted in pics, the two places are separate lines that merge to one register.

Salad counter has cafeteria-style buffet of toppings- four toppings seems to be standard, with $1/additional topping, which is absurdly high. At the least I'd expect the menu to have a few set salads to choose from rather than being exclusively build-your-own. 

Other counter is smoothies: the superfruit smoothie is my pick, with strawberry, blueberry, and pineapple, for a sweet taste but no added sugar. Price difference from small to large is less than a dollar, so the large makes more sense at just under $6.

Service is pretty nonexistent, teens without social skills who toss your drink at you and can't answer menu questions. Typical mall food court restaurant in that regard, but this is probably your healthiest option.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,3,ywdmyvvaa1tqkwZplj_Jjw

Ok so I didn't realize it's NOT FRESH when he was grabbing me my Caesar and Thai chicken wraps. I said to myself to still give it a shot. Paid $19 for 2 NOT FRESH wraps (keep in mind I came at 7pm on a Sunday, and they close at 8pm) and a bottle water. Still my bad on judgment I guess 

So I gave it a go; it was cut in half and I started on the first. So far it was decent, can definitely tell its
Not fresh and not worth the money.. But even the husband thought it wasn't good and the tortilla wrap was hard... I bit all the way down to the first half and it tasted a little funny. I thought to myself it's just my thoughts... Then I took another bite and I tasted rotten something, I was eating Thai chicken.

Incongruities tongue second half and then took another big bite and BAM it was ROTTEN. It had an old, hard boiled egg taste and again, I'm eating THAI CHICKEN

They have 2 lines, one for salad and one for smoothies and yogurts. Stood in line for yogurt which only had one other person in front of me. Salad line was super long, about 8 people in line. Waited for a long time. Person in front complained that she was standing there for awhile. After taking her order, cashier totally ignors me and the growing line waiting for smoothies and yogurt. I ask loudly if there were 2 lines or 1. They replied 2 seperate lines (one for salad and one for smoothies) so i question why the salad line cashier was able to take care of 8 people compared with 1 in the smoothie line. Asked for a manager, Chris (the manager) does not apologize and does not take my order, rather he defends his cashier by telling me that everyone goes their own speed and that I assume he thinks it was perfectly fine that she couldn't even handle taking more then one order compared to the cashier next to her taking 8 orders. Another women worker steps in and handles the situation, takes my order and then does not take my money. She should be the manager, not Chris. Chris does not know how to manage his employees nor how to give quality customer service. Filed a complaint with Green Leaf's Beyond Great Salads with my email and phone number, no follow up.
