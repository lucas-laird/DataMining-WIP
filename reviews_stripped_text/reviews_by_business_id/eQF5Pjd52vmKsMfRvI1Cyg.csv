Came here with my girlfriend (who is Russian), she really liked the borsch and chicken cotlety, which is similar to meatloaf.

I ate the lamb shish kabob, which was very good. Friendly owner/wait staff. Menu is in English, which is good since I am American and don't read Russian.

Worth a trip if you want to try some good Russian food!",FNhnnkhFVu51NaueDTBAnw,2,1,5,FNphiD3RQg2eSzpt5sOgrA

So friendly, handcrafted food, the kind of place where the chef comes out, explains what you ask with a big smile as though he's so happy you came. Some accents of course because they're from Moscow and Kazakhstan. The food is as authentic as their delightful cuisine. This is a slice of another country. Since Kazakhstan is close to China expect some fusion.",mwYVPvK93YcOzE2H6i-uNw,3,1,5,4dntssY0pyhizCsRGsNikg

 We had the marinated Georgian eggplant, beef stroganoff and the Pelimeni dumplings.  So good. Reasonable prices too. Their Grand Opening is June 9 and they are having a party!",FhkZk24n_Dh-pVLpBKUwEw,5,4,5,YFKG5UuGDxJdcDhbOi1PDg
