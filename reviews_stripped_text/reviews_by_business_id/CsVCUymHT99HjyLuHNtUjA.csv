1025383,2017-05-31,1,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,"I have been eating at this Subway weekly for at least the last 3 months now and have done the receipt-survey several times but after seeing previous Yelp reviews on this Subway I see that I need to put my 2-cents in as well.

In contrast to previous reviews, I have received very good customer service at this Subway location and the food has always tasted great for me and been of good quality. Even if there is a line, it has always gone by very quickly and before I know it my sandwich is done and I'm on my way. My favorite subs are the Tuna and also the Buffalo chicken ft. longs which I rarely stray away from. The manager Alex is a friendly, patient person and is bilingual (English/Spanish). Personally, I have not experienced anything inadequate or unsatisfying with this Subway location like some of these reviewers have in the past 1-2 years, and definitely would recommend this Subway to any of my friends or family (or strangers) who are in this area and looking for a quality sandwich at an affordable price!",8-bBLp1JibyXsqm-uy0XtQ,1,1,5,t732F9pGtxYDMOpAwOJUmw
2221503,2018-05-21,0,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,We were all sooo hungry and found this subway close to the house and rushed over there knowing that google said CLOSING SOON ( it was 11:45pm ) we get there and it was closed! So disappointing! And still hungry! Had to drive to the 24hr location on Maryland pkwy...other than that their service and sandwiches are to my liking! Only subway that doesn't ask me ( toasted?!!! ) after I have already ordered ( TUNA MELT ) YES OF COUSE! ITS A TUNA MELT!!! Just ranting cause they closed early! But I will be back this week I'm sure!,mYWi5mJj6FdatyxvKGUVCw,0,0,1,zDXXWpho6SGIehqqQKghyQ
3067089,2015-10-20,0,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,"Quite possibly the worst subway I've eaten at. It's not in the best part of town. Neither one of the employees could speak much English. They just tossed everything on the sand which without spreading it out or evening it up. Just ingredients clumped together then she forced the super dry bread shut. 

Then, while I was eating. A homeless man blocked the door with his shopping cart and filled a big gulp cup up with the fountain machine. No one said a word to him...",Kki3yVMhb7BPmu_vUUCPwQ,0,0,1,Io-mXC9k__zIHweuJANPDA

3415280,2015-09-20,1,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,My boyfriend had a horrible experience at this location. He went through the entire process of making an order just to find out that their debit card machine was not working. The employee mentioned to him that they've been having problems with the card that day but wasn't able to explain to him why she didn't say anything before he ordered nor posted any signs. He didn't have any cash on him so the employee just apologized and took the sandwich back. I'm hoping they didn't waste food by throwing it away. He left and just went to another location down the street on maryland pkwy and Sahara. The employees don't care for the place and it shows.,S2pt8jKF_SKXAOeB8ESdXA,1,0,1,-WPI4Vp0fxkagt6QbGjKHA
4088501,2016-02-29,0,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,"The service is terrible, I came here for two sandwiches and after my first one Gloria just started taking everyone else's orders. I understand it got busy, but if you can't handle working somewhere then don't do it. The other lady was very sweet. Them skipping over my other order caused them to have to work around me and they seemed very unorganized attempting to work with numerous sandwiches at once.",e-WTKcxfHPciIJQRpnHEIw,0,0,1,B0_rjPtFkveTxPjJEsbgZA
4297225,2018-06-25,0,CsVCUymHT99HjyLuHNtUjA,"We ordered three platters for thirty people. There was plenty for all. Alex the manager was friendly, accomodating and efficient.  The sandwiches received good cooments, some took home the extra.  We really enjoyed the steak sandwiches.  Alex had the platters ready at our specified time and they looked great.  The condiments were plentiful too.  And he took great care to make sure the steak sandwiches weren't soggy.",-_STNI3Bv5c28Jq8ggufzA,0,0,5,L9PstSRtd6JXnErJQNjllg

If your use to eating at subway then you really wanna skip this location! Staff put way to much sauce on the subs, usually everything has freezer burn, staff lack English, and the place is filthy.",eynu0uJEon1ORH1nIf4pTA,1,0,1,EaVVBTj2ney7jBX-gg3rYw
