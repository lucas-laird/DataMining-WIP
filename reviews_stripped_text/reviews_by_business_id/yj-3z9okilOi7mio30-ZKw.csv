504659,2014-10-14,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"My husband arrived at the D gates of Terminal 1 at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas with not much time prior to boarding and STARV-ING. There is a serious lack of decent food options that are quick at this terminal. One pizza place, a place to by box sandwiches, chili's too with a 40 minute wait and Quizno's. 

We avoid fast food like a plague for its general low quality, high fat/calorie counts and poor nutrition. We figured a sandwich would be better than pizza, I mean how can you mess up such a simple thing as a sandwich? Ha...ha!

Now I will say this, my husband ordered some sort of cold cut variety on whole wheat that had a lot of ranch dressing on it and he said it tasted pretty good. He was so hungry I think he downed it in 4 bites. I tried to go a healthier route with their veggie guacamole and had it grilled, or was that toasted - I'm not sure - on parmesan bread. Here's my review:

Service: friendly and quick. No complaints here.

Food: Ugh. My bread was spongy, tasteless, really gross. The veggies on this veggie sandwich were black olives, TONS of diced purple onions, mushrooms and shredded iceberg lettuce. Does that sound like a veggie sandwich to you?? Does that even come close to sounding appetizing?? Where are the peppers, spinach, tomatoes?? Two layers of cheese, swiss and cheddar with a little squirt of what I think was Italian dressing and barely detectable guacamole all mushed into the lettuce. It just had no taste. A pile of tasteless unappetizing vegetables on spongy, tasteless bread. Odd thing is the sandwich looked great but did not match the flavor. I ate less than a quarter of it just to tame down the hunger pangs and the rest went in the garbage.

Two stars is for the quick friendly service, I would give zero for the food if I could. Believe me, I am one on yelp who consistently gives the benefit of the doubt to places but I advise you to go elsewhere for food.",q8OLnD0vkRYif06fhn5rhg,0,0,2,jBfi1C5OC9_YFEp7bA1KXg

I stop here hungry at 5am and she assist me with my order with a great early morning attitude. That is the best way to start a fly. Thanks Srisi,MZRwmHcC3pBNCrPwasZW5Q,0,0,5,6wbUPL7VMTE0mLDWPmhmCA
1344801,2016-03-02,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,Yuck. Ordered a tuna sandwich. Pure slop and didn't even taste great. Everything fell out the edges. I found bits of bacon in with the tuna. I heard this company is going down the pan .... hardly surprising. I ate half on my flight and threw the rest in the trash.,iFoyT7lmT7UDxLV3botlKQ,0,0,1,KpNEJ6w5baTuV7_6W53l_g
1561367,2009-08-12,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"I wouldn't normally consider Quizno's to be comfort food, but there's something comforting about having a sandwich here before boarding my flight home to Atlanta.  There are lots of other options for food on this concourse and I always bypass them all for a sub.

It's unfortunate that you pay a premium for eating in the airport.  A regular combo costs more than $10. Sometimes I guess it's worth it, though. Especially when it makes you feel sooo good inside.",NZba-Q-Fp10iF77CTQt24Q,1,0,4,qsHTA_s5v2b1Ppnl_2Acyw
1984156,2017-08-21,4,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,I needed something quick to eat before I boarded my flight back to NY and there was slim picking at this terminal.  I haven't had Quiznos in years and probably for good reason.  I had the chicken carbonara.  It was pretty much exactly what I expected from a Quiznos located in the airport.  The bread was mediocre and everything was overly salty. Good thing I had lots of water for the flight home.,59qPUhPO6l498iCuvRy0Ig,4,4,2,hyZ0hgPxYL7Y6KoA66iU5A
2179751,2017-10-09,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"I only ate here for breakfast so I can't speak to the quality of their lunch/dinner food, but the breakfast sandwich was good. Egg and cheese, with generous quantities of both, and it tasted good. At $5.49, though more expensive than non-airport food and/or airport food in other locations, it was still a much better value and better flavor/quantity than comparable food in the same terminal. And they actually had a breakfast option without meat! All in all, I was satisfied.",PrttI3BL_IpML7jaNSo-kQ,0,0,4,6YgFtkU2WUa4umP5f6oXMA

Everything was falling out of it. Also, they didn't have everything on the menu that Quiznos usually has to offer.

2290422,2014-02-19,3,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"As of Feb 2014, all prices at this airport location have gone up by at least 30% across the board. $11 for a dinky 7.5 inch Quiznos sub? No thanks. Very disappointing!

I used to always grab a chili and a sandwich from here for non meal service flights, but I refuse to support the new price gouging going on here. There's even a new handwritten sign above the soda fountain that reads ""Refills are 85 cents"". Come on, man!",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,2,2,2,eNZcs6WAxwoovt9clU0EEQ
2584502,2016-06-11,2,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"This place is a sad excuse for a place to eat. Because everyone is forced to choose to eat here or at a few other over priced eateries at the airport, the customer service doesn't have to be up to par. I mean I wasn't expecting much especially for an 11$ sandwich. I'm so used to eating at subway where u get a whole footlong for 8-9$. Instead here u get an 8 inch. Plus there is NO- Make it your way. All is preset. 
We ordered the Italian on Parmesan bread. Combo of what I would similarly order at subway aka the BMT. 
When we got our sandwich, the bread was all burnt(see picture), there was way too much Italian dressing so the bread was all soggy and as we ate it, it was dripping a combo of the dressing/oil from the oily/fatty meats all down my arm.
I mean I don't blame them for bad customer service, why provide good service if you don't have to?? Most places to eat at the airport have a monopoly so yea. 
Not bad, not good. Hard to compare when all you have else to eat is cookies, ice cream and Baha fresh express.",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,2,1,3,NCNeydM9PSQXuc_B8Ywj-g
2672676,2017-04-01,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,Awful!!! Prices are more than normal Quiznos and taste awful. No where near the taste of a normal Quiznos. Do NOT go here.,ME-NTQF-sZu1GnGVU42tmg,0,0,1,TwrnmtLNtmaaSXLBpQlWVQ

4276648,2015-07-02,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,The worst 10 dollar sandwich I ever did eat. The lady working the counter was nice. The bread tastes like subway (before they took out all of the chemicals) and the meat is just not right.,-EmL0p-vK7d1RdKC2sfFng,0,0,1,Ea-MfcRxn2emiY_JWDlB9Q
5132659,2016-04-21,9,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"Yuck. Yuck. Yuck.

Double Yuck. 

Remind me to never ever again get a tuna sub from this place. It was like eating slimy cat food on a tasteless roll. 

Bad on me for even attempting this. As I do not eat red meat anymore I needed something to have for dinner on the long flight back to NYC and tuna seemed like a decent enough choice. Service was pleasant and quick enough. Basic airport prices.

I ate basically half of the sandwich and wanted to hurl. Left the other half under my seat on the plane. I bet that was a fun surprise for the cleaning crew!

How the heck is Quiznos still a thing anyway? Do your stomach and taste buds a favor and avoid this place.",YttDgOC9AlM4HcAlDsbB2A,7,6,1,oeq2Y5x1cKhc0lXI5CqXew
5261979,2018-05-05,0,yj-3z9okilOi7mio30-ZKw,"The Bottom Line: It's an airport Quiznos. Be smart about what you pick here, get the chicken, and keep it simple.

Pro:
It's quick, the service is nice, and it'll keep you going.

Con:
Quality ranges from ""eh"" to ""dear God"", so... choose the safest sandwiches.",muNBd72RI-WhHLlwIYaWRA,0,0,3,hVBd6A0C3AyPc9ormD32xw
