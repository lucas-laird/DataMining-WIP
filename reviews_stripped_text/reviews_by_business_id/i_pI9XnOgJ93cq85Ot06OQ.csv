As my friend and I entered the establishment we were not greeted at all but there were three hostesses standing behind the podium they just looked at us blankly. We smiled and nodded and we asked if they were open. (It was dinner time) one of them said ""yes"" and proceeded to take us to a table.  The server brought us drinks which was fine and then our waiter seemed a bit disturbed.  We proceeded to talk and order our food which was also fine. The waiter didn't seem to pay attention to us once the food came.  Though there was a brief moment he just stood beside out table.  Additionally I witnessed him take a piece of fruit from the bar and eat it.  Then a loud conversation between the manager and one of the blank hostesses took place at the bar. It was about shift changes and didn't really seem appropriate for a restaurant.   Overall, the food was fine but the staff needs better training.",siyUlesVQSfg-ZtmFlq_Rg,0,0,3,C4S3DKJIOvor1L-SkdjhyA

Considering that's the only job she has; really what else is she there for, you would think she would put a little effort in it.  My wife actually asked how she was with no reciprocation from her; really. Then once seated, the waitress coped an attitude because we didn't opt for their bottled water or for any cocktails. Never mind that we bought an appetizer and two entrees. The food was good but not so much to compensate for their attitude. One and done...",EBdTzH2ZARu_mBfi1ULkAA,2,0,2,VqpTiasfJnra1dPmZPq1CQ

From the moment we waited in line and watched the hostess leave the podium to seat guests leaving an unattended line; to the extremely Poor service, understaffed for a concert night,  disorganized, cold food, wrong food brought to table, check presented uncorrected, what a mess! Had the food been served hot it would have been good. One dish was finally served after we had finished everything else. We thought the waiter forgot but couldn't find him tomcatch his attention. When the busboy finally delivered the fried shrimp it was lukewarm! Terrible to bite into deep fried shrimp and not even warm. I'll never return and sadly the server was very nice but not a nice dinner experience!",_aEflTnGjlpcyQWI3FppUw,0,0,1,rLWWzwiAjtgBfJaKTaiQ4Q

Our Server Adrian was absolutely amazing....he was attentive, kind, funny, informative, and knowledgeable about the History of the Hot Pot Special.

There are not a lot of descriptions on what the Hot Pot Special is but I would describe it to be very similar to Fondue in that you pick two ""broths"" or ""sauces"" if you will to cook what you order. It truly is all you can eat and you pick what types of produce and veggies you want to the type of protein you can pick and choose whatever you want. I have to say surprisingly the Tofu was by far my favorite though. It has a sweeter taste to it.

Definitely try the Orange Chicken and Mongolian Beef too those were outstanding.

And they have this Chili Oil sauce that they make in house which is to die for.

We finished off our feast with their Special Coconut Ice Cream which is out of this world. I wish they would box it up and sell it by the carton.

So when you try this place as for Adrian to be your server and I promise you will definitely come back.",UPbjcftSCbDG4AGlJ3_uqw,2,2,5,ODM_U7BPqg6Fnt9pWOz9TA
1855247,2016-07-02,0,i_pI9XnOgJ93cq85Ot06OQ,"Service was fine, prices were what I expect in a tourist joint. 

Scallion pancake - perfectly fine, but this is a hard dish to mess up.
Soup Dumplings - also perfectly fine but this is one of the weakest Chinese dishes in town so perfectly fine beats a fair number of other joints.
Tea Smoked Duck - cut by someone who doesn't know how to do it properly, this is dry and overcooked with nothing to it that hints at the tea smoking and not just an over roast.  I suspect this is done in a fast high heat manner as most of the duck fat had rendered away, leaving nothing to cover how dry the meat was. And again, no smokiness to speak of.",6aJ_WRWa3C3o0A3EXYyEmw,0,0,3,WdYqj0v3iXlBZXY8PUMDaw

I came here with my family and their friends, party of 8. And we did the all you can eat hot pots. Boy did I get full really quick. Hahaha. Anyways, half of us came early so while waiting for the rest of the group, we were seated right away. It wasn't busy when we first arrived, but did pick up really quick right after. While we were waiting for everyone, we did order our drinks and started ordering what we wanted with our hot pots. 

Everything came out perfect. Our waitress checked up on us constantly to make sure we got everything we need. I never once wondered where my server was because he was always present. 

I'm not an expert on hot pot or anything but all I know was my belly was satisfied and I had no complaints the whole time I was there.",mG-q2qtWVAxDEW5Y7BwcCw,0,0,5,KqnKLEJY64HHcIOf24UiOw
2435993,2017-06-05,2,i_pI9XnOgJ93cq85Ot06OQ,"I decided to try this spot due to me staying at the Palms Hotel & Casino and having a $25 a day allotment with Groupon.  The hostess sat me and my hub down with no issues.  The server Rachel came over and took our drink order with no issues.  She seemed alright at first however when she came back to take our order it went downhill.  I informed her I wanted an order of crab Rangoon, veggie fried rice & wanted to know what came in the orange chicken & also that it was a decent portion.  She informed me that she was not sure how much much I eat being a big boy, then laughed about it.  I informed excuse me, then she said it was a family restaurant but she didn't know if that was gonna fill me up.  I placed order but then I acquired a bad taste in my mouth for her rude comments.  We left table and went to speak with hostess & informed her of the situation which she apologize and brought out this manager on duty Name Michael Martin who didn't properly introduce himself but stated that he was covering for Cathy the regular mgr on duty.  I informed him of situation and he looked at me like I walked off the street though I am a guest there.  After going over facts I informed him I prefer a resort mgr.  He escorted me & my hub to the front desk which we waited & spoke with Shelby Masacek.  She seemed much better than the arrogant Michael.  I informed her of situation and she also apologized but informed me that they are not affiliated with Palms Casino & Hotel.  She took my info and said the food & beverage director Stacey will get in contact with me.  I will update review once I get a resolution from this situation.",tPIK3B7-Epk1JKe9GSJx2w,1,0,1,KslzRfZo-WMzdmAjEY7vKg

Place has a really nice ambiance but I've gotten wind that this place isn't doing well. It's got a really beautiful dining room and a very nice bar but maybe the lack of tourists during this season makes places look even slower. This place was slow but the food didn't take long at all.

Ray the bartender took great care of my partner and I. Great convo and laughs. He made me a very good cocktail based off exactly what I like.


The food was so and so. The pot stickers and spring rolls were better than the Mongolian beef. I'm a sucker for mongo beef and maybe that's why I shouldn't have ordered it. The crispy noodles were good. Nothing over the top but good meal. The appetizers shouldn't out shine the entrees. 

When you check in on yelp you get free spring rolls",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,3,2,3,0U1AKrSFjeEnUcd_kW4Vew

The food was actually OK just standard hot pot items for $29.95 per person which is reasonable. However, the service was pretty bad especially for restaurant inside a casino. The server was very busy and when he finally came to our table, he kept talking Chinese even though it was obvious that not all the guests were Chinese. We waited for more than 40 minutes before getting our food. The server was always busy and other staffs pretended they didn't see you when you call, they rather clean up a table then response to you. It was a challenge getting service in this place and the server forget about you coz they are under staffed even though they are not too busy. They also missed some items we ordered since its all you can eat. Dropped off the check when we were still eating. Will not recommend.

Shrimp with lobster sauce had tiny shrimp. Their noodle dish did not have much of anything. The sea bass was okay. The war wonton soup was grossly overpriced.  Want chinese food. go across the street to Ping, Pang Pong, at the Gold Goast.  10 times better, witht more reasonable prices.They charge for hot tea, and white rice..The service was very good.

My wife is a diabetic and we asked the server if we could get the Mongolian Beef without sugar.  She came back and said she would have every dish made without sugar but would let us know if we chose a dish where that was impossible.  We had a great meal and when we got home came the real test.  So many places lie and say the food is without sugar but it is.  My wife took her blood sugar and it was normal.  Truly a meal worth repeating.,kRKKMTkn5qBDIwkTKL0c5w,0,0,5,m4lwi1K4fdSQbZAXj0zNHQ

Ordered spring rolls and General Tso chicken. Spring rolls so greasy I sent them back after taking 2 bites. I told waiter they were greasy, but they remained on the bill. Ordered my fave, General Tso's, which was composed of hard, deep fried ""chunks"" of chicken, and no broccoli. White rice was perfect. Cursory, silent service. Ample servings.
