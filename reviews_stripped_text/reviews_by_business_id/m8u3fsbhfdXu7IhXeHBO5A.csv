The side of potatoes was under cooked, but if you like raw greasy potatoes then yay! No napkins! Only gave us 1 small cup of ranch for all the food we ordered and when I asked for more ranch he said ""yeah sure"" then started helping the person behind me without ever giving me more ranch. Lots of other choices at the food court we won't be picking this one ever again!",ufbEaTy5TdycUdQWlIcgaA,0,0,1,dND2t3poI2zOWcrc8vQMfA

Plus the employees have been super friendly and helpful both times ..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,3,4,5,h1vQQBJXdvqwKjrrj3gmAQ
