3624556,2011-10-24,0,6c2Xxt3DCXdvd3wc8vj7-w,My friends and I eat here at least once a month.  We always get the pupusas revueltas.  Love their curtido (cabbage slaw) and salsa roja to go with them.  The fried yucca and chicharrones are also a must to go with our pupusas.   We've made it a point to try pupusas around town and we always come back to Esmeralda's.  You can't beat the price!  I've also gotten a few pupusas to go and they're great heated up the next day as well.,0knL9QPQ1DHBJoOTT-Az-w,0,0,5,mNdf5Nk_VZu1wezjbC6_jg

They're very nice and take care of you well. They even help me work on my spanish, I appreciate that. 

The salsa is runny. This is a Salvadorian place so I'm guessing that's how they make their salsa. It's still good. 

The pupusas are FANTASTIC! I always get the rubuelta. It has everything (pork, beans and cheese). One pupusa, rice and beans is $4.50! Can't go wrong with that.",-xm0IbbB0lfp5CGnfIIWZA,0,0,5,xH4VIsi_Oi3PhL9mBE5uIA

Our favorites are the yuca con chicharrones and the pupusas revueltas. Great stuff. You should go.",DjsS89nD3eaoUuFhrkc5Ig,1,0,5,mH6cEs8Fn_h65gxjaxmVgg

It should have ""hit me in the head"" to think that maybe this restaurant would NOT have good Salvadorian food since they were serving ""Mexican"" style tortilla chips.   Fresh Salvadorian hand-made tortillas with butter or cheese would have been BETTER!  Oh Well!",1sMsIQHqQEDS0etoI-Zqug,1,0,2,P4LgNCRjQZHK4CjeinUd0g
