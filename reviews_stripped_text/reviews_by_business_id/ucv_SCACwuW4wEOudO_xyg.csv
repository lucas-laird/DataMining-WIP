Cant say no to anything, small menu but they cook it perfect!",IAhOlCvSJVDyDkRqfOSScA,0,0,5,uN46EcvTnQlc2AOkk11R_g

The breaded cutlets are sliced thin and are just true perfection. Also the salad that comes with the meal has some muscle and includes big tomatoes, olives and pepperchini's too with homemade dressing. Rice Balls are also great too.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,1,1,4,V6h4dFWS9qeqZM0nXsu9tA

Pretty good pizza, they have other Italian specialities, and also Italian Ices.
Cugino's is definitely better pizza-wise than Chicago Brewing Company...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,2,1,3,o6QK-eObYbO_EPXehwUpcA

I spoke with the owner, and learned that he broke from the franchise because he would not conform to their cookie-cutter pizza recipe, thus had to change the name.  Thank god he did because this pizza is superb.

Authentic New York Style pizza-- what more is there to say?  The crust is thin, but not too thin; both crunchy and doughy; and the perfect  balance between cheesy and saucy.

Best pizza in Vegas, hands down.",Ci4HqTd370VSTa4DbF5Yvw,1,0,5,ERCDUqf6Kjn2biL0zX6vmw

(pizza pie that is).  If you know New York pizza then you know what we mean.  If you like NY pizza then you will Love Cugino's.  If you re looking for a great Italian deli, these folks do way more than pizza and everything I have tried has been spectacular.",RgHZiJQVz2bCZTvSPKD3gg,1,0,4,LYAKSxwUjkyRNSNAKXiCiw

As a kid I remember walking in to what I would call a typical dive pizza joint.  The owner/manager was an avid Jeopardy watcher, a trait for which my family has coined him ""Jeopardy man.""  

Although the ambience leaves something to be desired, the pizza is remarkable.  Thin crunchy crust topped with a smooth, understated pizza sauce and just the right amount of salty, gooey cheese makes for the best  texture, flavor & craving satisfaction.  Without a doubt the absolute best pizza in Las Vegas.",4j_9v0CA6Ke1KmWFYXge2w,1,1,5,htiUe8owVy39oUD8PCIpsg
