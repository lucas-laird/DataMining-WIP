Encountering really salty-greasy dishes at some places/ family parties.

Their food appears ""clean"" and I mean as in the dishes are not saturated in grease and over salting. I like how their dishes are made with love. I mean as in their food is fresh and the dishes are all uniquely carried out. I like the variety this restaurant carries. This place has Vietnamese and Filipino cuisine. It's nice to offer variety. The Lechon Kawaili is delicious. The prices are affordable and portions are perfect. 

The service is wonderful, clean restaurant, nice decor. It's the hidden gem that goes missed because it's in a shopping area.",giKWIwJ8q8W2VPNaCpgr6w,0,0,5,rzyx0zRoHQz3BFTQDSFqNw

331704,2016-05-24,0,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"lol my first review. 
anyways customer service is horrible here but they got some good food. 
a bit pricey for a regular dish but i dont mind. 
i dont normally write reviews but what just happened earlier was horrible. not the first tho

the first time was ok, it was a few months back, the lady who served me doesnt work here anymore. so anyway, she just forgot to place my order. i waited 15mins and wondered why the food wasnt here yet so i decided to follow it up. so she told me she forgot to place my order, idk what really happened (if the cook forgot to cook my order or she really just forgot to place my order). so basically i waited 40mins for my food. that was horrible, she didnt even ask me if i want water or anything. she apologized ok but then again shit happens so i let it go

so earlier today, i called to place and waited for like 30secs for someone to answer. not really sure what happened but i heard a male robotic voice so and assumed it was transferred to voicemail, but when i was about to press the red button, i heard a girl's voice. it was too late to pull my thumb away. so i called again, the girl answered, and when i was about to say my order, i was about to say sorry that i hung up but then she hung up. i knew she meant it cus i heard the bang of the phone. i wont let that one slide lol. its really horrible. i come here a lot to buy lunch and dinner but that was fookin horrible lol. i knew that was the new young lady employee who did it cus i know her voice over the phone.

im pretty sure the servers remember me, not maybe by name, but face and voice.

welp not gonna come here anymore lol you have my word on this one. terrible service, real talk. good food, not bad, not great, just good lol oh btw this is not my real name but it sounds like it.

oh i forgot. the other reviews about more fat and less meat are true. when i order pork i always get 65% fat and rest, meat. but i never really asked them to put more meat, so my fault. next time, go ask more meat than fat. if u want more vegetable than meat, ask them. they might do it for u",Cqhhi21Fbu1t2KzjyolOVA,0,0,2,vXYTDT80HTrsDAucdRs_qQ

1034546,2016-02-22,0,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"I don't usually like to write a review when I'm upset but I think this one was warranted. Service at this place has always been whatever. Inconsistency is the only thing that is consistent if you catch my drift. Today I think the one person was in training - so I can't fault her for anything but the main server was a bit obnoxious. Anyway, my wife and I came here for lunch and we ordered 3 things. Chicken Tinola (Pretty Good), Garlic Fried Rice (Pretty Good), & Chicken Arroz Caldo (Meh). I placed my order with said server in that order and when I said garlic rice, she said, ""No, tinola only comes with white rice."" I said ""OK do you not make garlic rice anymore?"" She says, ""Yeah, it's ala carte $8.99"" I said fine before I really let that sink in, but $8.99 for garlic fried rice??? It's rice and garlic!! and probably rice left over from the day before!

At the end of the meal I ask for the check. Sure enough $8.99, ok whatever.  When the server comes back with her iPad to sign for my credit card it's on a screen for gratuity. There's a blank space to enter a custom amount and 3 buttons, for 18%, 20% & 22%. What happened to the 15%? That's it, no other numbers. The nerve that they expect 18% as a minimum that put me over the edge. 

So 3 stars it is. Food is good enough (which for me is always the most important part) but the service, attitude, and gall of the restaurant loses them 2 stars.",iMYz7rdyhma74hK6SyYQVg,2,1,3,f1aYR9uyvs_Nqp9ywUESLg

On this visit, I ordered the Tapsilog. It's a traditional Filipino breakfast dish with Marinated Beef, somewhat similar to a Beef Jerky, Fried Rice, Eggs and Tomatoes.

The issue is that by no means is this a difficult dish to prepare, but I was left waiting 40 minutes for my order. Comparing this to my last visit, they seem to have an issue with table management. The only other table occupied in the establishment was a party of 10 that received their orders consistently. If the idea was that I'd have to wait until after the table before me has been served completely they might as well have had everyone after wait to be seated which would still be unacceptable as a restaurant should be able to handle more than one table at a time.

And after all that, the food arrived under par compared to previous trips which shows a lack of consistency. Undercooked old fried rice, and slightly overcooked Beef. The eggs were perfect, I'll give them that, but not enough to salvage the dish. Unfortunate.",ZGuFr1zM967HE6elvcXVJg,0,0,2,Tun-ROQkF78N5o-Ewcd91w

2.  Chicken Adobo - this is our kids favorite dish.  However after their 1st bite, kids asked if they can just eat the rice.  The adobo had too much garlic and the kids said they didn't like it. After having the tokwa't baboy, I was hesitant to try this one.

Service is always great and food is always so good but last night we took my family, which was a party of 7, and everything was good as usual until it was time to pay. We understand that most restaurants automatically add on gratuity on the bill after a certain amount of guests at the table, and in this case they automatically tacked it on to the bill. We would've been completely fine with that if they disclosed this to us when they handed us the bill but out of the 3 servers we had working on our table, none of them felt the courtesy to tell us when we paid. So when we were paying, they take care of the bill on an iPad so we had to ask how to add tip on the bill properly and they had an open chance to tell us it was already added on the bill but the worker stayed quiet and watched us add more tip. Our issue was they decided to keep that information from us and still allowed us to tip on top of their mandatory gratuity.

Believe me, I have asked around and I have confirmed that he doesn't own this business. And if he did, I would be the first one to know. And I don't know, which means he does not have anything to do with this restaurant. Thank you.

This spot around my house has been many different types of restaurants. Before, it was a pizza place. And before that, it was a barbecue restaurant (just kidding, I don't remember what type of restaurant it was before the pizza restaurant). The latest incarnation seems to be a combination of a Filipino restaurant and a Vietnamese one. I went with the former rather than the latter because I felt like it. I was also reading on the internet about crispy pata, a dish I had never had before, but was intrigued to try anyway. LJ's had it, so you knows Mike had to go get some!

Crispy pata is basically a part of the pig that has been cut up, most of the time the knuckles, braised, then deep fried until crispy. Let me go on record saying that, I am all about that. And then some. The one at LJ's was OK. The skin was crispy, but really thick in some areas making it sometimes too tough to chew through. And, I thought the meat was OK too, but some areas almost had a ""gamey"" taste to it, which really didn't compute in my noggin. 

On another visit, I ordered my favorite Philippine food, Lechon Kawali. The guy on the phone said that on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after 4pm, they have roasted lechon kawali available, rather than the deep fried version. I was like ""Whaaaaa?"" And he was like ""That's what i'm talking about, Michael"". And then I was like ""Oh, how did you know my name?"" and he was like ""Magic"". (That conversation didn't happen as well. But he did recommend me the roasted one, and I said ""Ok, I'll try it"") 

I thought that the skin was a little bit too thick and hard for my taste. I also thought that the meat and fat tasted a bit too strange to me. Some were really tough, others were right on the money, and for some, it was meltingly 'too soft'.

It was a pretty cool place and I wish them the best. They have a wide variety on their menu and the service staff seems friendly and helpful. Not my cup of tea, but it was an OK experience. I know that LJ R. is smiling down on me from his little yellow Dragonball cloud in heaven, approving of this review.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,27,24,3,9N4asZB9ywYJFNQ9T408Lg

Coupled the pork candy with the Vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp. The rolls were fresh and the sauce served with them was amazing. Do yourself a favor and get  your salad rolled up in a nice rice wrapper a great way to get your fiber on while waiting for the decadence of the lechon.

My husband (who is of white skin color/descent) walked in to order some take out to food for dinner for our family and after about 10 minutes of standing there looking at the menu (2) servers walked passed him several time and NEVER acknowledged him.   Not even a simple ""hi welcome, I'll be right with you"".   Shortly after a Filipino family walked in and immediately the servers acknowledged them and made themselves available to them.   

I'm sure if I (of Filipino descent/brown skin color) was standing with him this would have NOT happened.   Mind you if it did, I would have ripped them a new *sshole.   I have eaten there before and so has my family, we have even held big family parties there!   never have I ever been ashamed of my people or my culture until now.   How embarrassing!    

We also know the owner also runs the Filipino Market next door that we frequent a lot!   We WILL NEVER visit their businesses again.   I feel sorry you, and the shame you bring amongst the rest of our Filipino heritage.   All races and all colors love our cuisine and what ""we"" bring to the table.

Like they say, ""word of mouth"" is the best or in this case the worst type of advertisement you could ask for.   Good luck.",QUBpVA8VCD4Ymn_WMFohow,7,0,1,74W5YRKcX0oZEouFLWqIeQ

We frequent the restaurant because we love their beefsteak and roasted lechon and our kids love their lumpia (which is the reason I put 2 stars instead of 1). We had out of town guests today so we decided to order carry out and ordered kare kare, chicken adobo, and lumpia. It was past my kids' dinner time but they insisted on waiting for the lumpia for dinner. As soon as my husband got home (we live 25 min away) we dove right in only to find a container of kare kare, chicken adobo, bagoong, lumpia sauce...... And a small container filled with sliced onions and tomatoes... What the heck?No lumpia to be found. It was partially my husband's fault for not checking but LJ's should have also put the correct food in our bag... it's not like they were super busy. Anyway, so that left me having to cook up something last minute out of a box for my kids who were anxiously waiting for their dinner. We called and they expected us to come back for a new order but there was no way we were gonna drive another 20 min for some egg rolls. They agreed to a refund but insisted that it be refunded in person. After a good 10 min my husband convinced them to do it over the phone. Not once did they apologize for the major inconvenience for our family especially my kids. My husband had to be the one to ask if we could get an additional discount for the inconvenience and even then they were hesitant at first. The manager wasn't in and we were being helped by the ""acting"" manager. They need to step up their customer service game if they expect to keep their local customers. Any other restaurant would have been super apologetic and would go out of their way to make it right and go above and beyond to remedy their mistake by giving a full refund or a significant discount. The most they offered (with my husband having to negotiate) was a measly 10% off and a refund for the lumpia we never got and if we came back, free dessert. They left such a bitter taste in my mouth by the way they handled this matter and aren't sure that I'll be giving them my business, my family's business and our out of town guest's business anymore...",6CPJdaGi6wSCyu4AMEgELw,0,0,2,6LeWBstNIAqL590CjwGmwg

I ordered fish sinigang to go. When I got home the fish still had scales on it! Like the whole fish had ALL its scales in tact!! It was horrible. So I never ordered with them after that. 

Fast forward about a year later. I was craving Filipino food but I didn't  want to drive to my other go to places since they're so far. I ordered Chicken Tinola and it was AMAZING!! One of the best I've had.

One thing is consistent, their service, it's horrible.

1777823,2015-07-07,2,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"Well first off I am so glad they opened a nice sit down enjoy each other's company style Filipino restaurant near us. (Kusina ni Lorraine is good but the whole mixed with a market just kills it for me). we only ate the Filipino side not the Vietnamese side. I'll l be reviewing all the things we ate. I had brought my family of 4 here. And let me tell you, plenty of food to bring for baon. 

Item #1 Binagoonan Fried Rice - I wish I had a picture! The taste was just amazing and with bits and pieces of really crispy lechon running around the rice was a song in my mouth! Definitely a must try! The waitress said its about 3 scoops of rice. NO, it's a lot more! Enough to feed all 4 of us AND have left overs.

Item #2 Bulalo soup - It was almost as good as my dads and grandpas. But it definitely was neck and neck. The meat was so tender melt in your mouth! The vegetables were soft but still had their bite. Not to salty but the broth definitely had that good flavor. It was just really good. 

Item #3 Ginataang Sitaw at Kalabasa -This is my moms specialty! She makes it all the time and is definitely proud of her Ginataang. But a few bites into this and even my mom said it was better than hers! The Squash was just nice soft, the shrimp was cooked perfectly, the coconut sauce was just creamy, the green string beans were still crisp and not soggy which was a huge plus. It was very yummy!

Item #4 Bistek Tagalog - I'm not a big fan of Bistek but my brother is and he hate half of the portion that was given to us. His only complaint was that the onions were just placed on the plate not necessarily grilled or cooked like he is usually used to. And the onions are his favorite part because that sweet bite of onion plus that  savory from the melt in your mouth beef would've just gone all together. 

Item #5 Kare Kareng Oxtail (My FAVORITE & my moms #1 specialty) - the oxtail fell right of the bone! I love to just eat the bone clean off the meat! You were able to use your fork to pick the meat off. But because I am so filipino I ate with my hands and cleaned the meat till that bone was naked. The peanut buttery sauce was good but wasn't as peanut buttery as I would like. My he tripe was my favorite part. The eggplants were nice and soft and yummy! The only part I would've liked if they added some crushed up peanuts to add some texture to it and that's how my mom does it. But no complaints we all devoured it!

Overall I gave LJ's a 4/5 because of the small complaints that my brother had about the Bistek and I had of the Kare Kareng Oxtail. 

This is a great place to bring your family. And it is definitely family friendly. They have TVs around no sound which is fine because you're their to eat not stare at a TV. And if you can't read the scores or headlines then you need to go back to school. 

Our total bill was $70! And we had so much food to take home! I think what really impressed me about this place is that my parents said they have a new go to place when they don't want to cook because they really enjoyed the food. They could taste how it was well seasoned and fresh and fast! Me and my brother love food so it was soooooo good to us. 

SHOUT OUT TO MY NAIL LADY KATIE AT NAIL TECH LV FOR TELLING ME ABOUT THIS PLACE! It didn't disappoint at all!!!

1815074,2016-04-15,0,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"Most times I've eaten here were all dine in's and the service is usually good. At least from what I can remember. Today, I felt like getting take out so I decided to call in my order.

I've had many bad experiences with take out so I've been checking my orders before I leave the establishment (regardless how tight they make the double knots on the plastic bag). I ordered lechon kawali lunch special, pork sinigang and halo halo for dessert and requested the ice cream on the side. Anyways, glad I checked out my orders before I left today cuz I repeated everything to the girl before i opened it and she nodded yes but I checked anyway. There were no lechon sauce or lumpia sauce in the bag so I asked her for some. (If I would've found out I didn't get any sauce when I got home, I would've been really upset so make sure you check your orders) She also didn't add any utensils or napkins. I went in around 3 pm and there were nobody in the restaurant so I can't blame it on anyone being busy at all. She also forgot to put my ice cream on the side like I requested.

I'm still giving them 4 stars because their food is 5 stars in my book as far as authentic Filipino food but the service seems like a hit or miss. I would stick to dining in. Also, their pork sinigang usually comes in a bigger serving when you dine in and you basically get half of that when you do take out. 

Some of the dishes I've tried here : 
(Family style sharing size when you dine in)

Lechon kawali- very generous with skin! And crunchy! Best one in town!!!

Pork sinigang- tasty and sour like how it's supposed to be. Yum

Pancit luglug- also known as palabok is very good. Ask for extra calamansi :)

Chicken arroz caldo - Sooo good. They put like 1/4 of a chicken in it not just little tiny shredded pieces of chicken. 

Garlic fried rice- perfect to pair with lechon kawali. And anyone who loves garlic would love this

Bistek Tagalog- it's ok I feel like I've had better

Halo halo- really good not too sweet. Real halo halo ingredients not just random fruits like some Filipino places

Sago't gulaman- tastes just like the one they sell in the Philippines 

Turon with ice cream- not the best I've had but if you've got a craving for it, it works.",j-6jv6z2TsvdHH9j5IqrYg,2,0,4,yllHxx71Apk4gQCLKNQBIQ

For starters we've been coming here somewhat often... maybe once or twice a month since they opened. We even go to their Asian market next door which is very convenient.

One Sunday we decided to order takeout for once...  Football was on and figured why not just pick it up this time. After calling in my order I was told to give them 15 minutes.  15 minutes seems quick so I showed up a half hour later instead.  Ended up waiting for more than another half hour after I arrived while my wife patiently waited in the car.  No apologies or even an explanation were given.  If they told me originally it would take one hour I would be okay showing up an hour later but don't tell me 15 minutes. It's obvious my phone order was somehow neglected, skipped or forgotten until I showed up as the servers avoided any eye contact but instead ran into the kitchen with their heads down. Doesn't help watching everyone's dish come out of the kitchen while you sit there knowing you called in an order ages ago.  Felt a little burned by an establishment  that you want to support.  A message to the owners... Mistakes, incidents or hiccups happen every single day...  What makes or breaks that customer satisfaction  though is how that problem or mistake is handled.

My son who loves Filipino spaghetti ($9.99) was so thrilled to see it on the menu!!! I have to admit, the spaghetti was cooked to order and made from scratch.

This place was ehhh ( I can care less for eating filipino food outside my home). Food was kinda greasy. Sooo do you want to take shots of oil and grease? Dont need to, just eat the damn calamari! AGAIN, READ OTHER REVIEWS FOR FOOD.

 Let me talk about service.

DO NOT go to this place if you have a party of around 10-15+ people. Service is SLOWER than a newborn progressing towards adolescence! You would think it would be appropriate to serve the same dish to multiple tables at the same time right??!? At this place, that is a HELL NO. They served 3 dishes to our adjacent table before we got our first dish. Idk if that specific day they were understaffed but its common sense to serve the same dishes at the same time. What a damn shame. Definitely no where near proficient at any Chinese restaurant that had better service with groups of 40+ people, and we only had 20. 

I am being modest with that 3 stars!!!!

2698426,2016-02-03,4,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"LJ's for carryout has been consistently pretty good regardless of what I have ordered so far so it was about time see if the in-dining experience would be just as good.  What initially began as a search on Yelp for a good bowl of Pho nearby ended up leading us to try their take on a Vietnamese staple despite first specializing in Filipino culinary dishes.

The dining space is very spacious and clean and we were greeted and seated quickly.  Separate menus for Filipino and Vietnamese dishes were presented but I already knew what I was going for.  

Pho dac biet (combination Pho):  Large bowl.  Check.  Plenty of noodles.  Check.  Meats galore?  Check. Check. Check!   The bowl was filled with sliced rare and well steak, beef tendon (my favorite!), tripe, beef balls, and beef brisket.  The quality and quantity of their soup was great for their slightly higher than average price ($10.99).  

We also ordered their fried pork belly (Lechon Kawali).  Tastes great the once again the portions were meant for sharing.  We had so much leftovers for the next day.   It comes with a sauce for dipping, I'd google ""mang tomas"" sauce, but basically it's like a liver-based sweet sauce.  It's Filipino's all-purpose sauce but it goes really well with the pork belly.

The shanghai eggrolls we ordered come in 12 pieces.  Maybe a little overpriced at 8.99 but they're good.  Little kids love these, my daughter is no exception.

On another return visit, we also ordered the Chicken Arroz Caldo (Chicken Rice Porridge).   It's a very soothing to the soul type of dish.  The porridge/soup is accented with roasted garlic, sliced ginger, green onions and some other greens.  Then there's pretty much a half chicken thrown in the bowl cut up in four pieces.  Another shareable entree or great for taking home for a second meal.

The service is very good, the staff is friendly, and they check to make sure we are enjoying our meal often.  Fairly happy to have a great Filipino restaurant nearby and will definitely be frequenting here often.

2742055,2017-08-04,0,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"I decided to take my (visiting) Mom to have a taste of home, and enjoy what I used to enjoy, some good Filipino cuisine specifically at LJ's Pub. I actually figured the place to be declining in business since it was anticipated to be busy based on the time I visited, not a soul in the house. 

8 weeks ago, I have decided to make a change in my lifestyle and become a Vegan. I have enjoyed many of my favorite dishes such as Sinigang and create it into a Vegan way - nothing animal based, no patis, nothing. Since I can do it at home, they should be able to. And while I did inquire first, I was also told they were able to. I clarified, and clarified, and clarified, that it can be done, but the charges would remain the same - NO BIG DEAL FOR ME. The server even asked if I had any allergies, I replied with No, but that I have since changed my eating lifestyle. They would benefit from this actually, but keeping the charges the same. While my meal came, it smelled so wonderful, my mom enjoyed her meal, as did I. 

I became VERY livid when I was sipping thru my broth after having enjoyed all the veggies from the deep bowl, only to find that there were 3 beef chunks at the bottom of my bowl. 

This made my very angry and upset. I was lied to and felt so deceived. I thought to myself, why would the server bother to ask if I was allergic to any meats, and what if I really was. They still may have served me beef anyway. 

Example, if I ordered pancit and mentioned that I was allergic to patis (fish sauce) I feel as though, the cooks would add it in anyway. 

One thing's for sure, I'm never going back. There isn't a single most deceiving restaurant like LJ's. What a shame that I have to give a star to proceed, should be half a star.",iHHlC_uW_yLPSAgiY_sW-A,1,1,1,eCnHxci0eZOwDR-6oJ9gIg

Growing up on Guam I've been spoiled by some of the most memorable, delicious Filipino cuisine. I daresay the Filipino food on Guam is better than in the Philippines...Just kidding! But it's really that good out there.

In any case, I came to LJ's and had the pork sisig. Gotta say it's pretty good, I love how it's served piping hot. Like most places they serve it with a raw, uncooked egg in the center so the pot and the pork eventually just sizzle-cooks it to perfection.

However, I don't like how there's too much fat and oil on the sisig. After you keep eating you'll notice it's about 70% fat and 30% actual pork meat. I feel like this should be more balanced because towards the end of the meal you just grow tired of digging through the plate for the meat. I know sisig is pretty fatty + oily in general but it's a little over the top here.

The service is good and friendly but the place was pretty empty so it's hard to say for sure how it is once it's busy. I like this restaurant but I just wasn't blow away.

It reminds me of going to my Auntie's holiday parties when everything is served family style with the flavors of home. I love the food here so much that I had my big birthday dinner here a couple years ago. (Which honestly even then the service was subpar)

But like many, MANY of the low star reviews here, my main gripe is with the service. Like HOLY CRAP is the service terrible. I'm super patient when it comes to food. I understand making something from scratch takes time, but when cooking and serving food is LITERALLY YOUR BUSINESS, you need to take some pointers from the multitude of negative reviews regarding it. 

This one particular visit I not only experienced bad service, I watched it happen to other tables! 

First off, it was only me and my bf having dinner, TWO OF US. We were seated immediately (by an employee or family member that was at the table next to us with her high school friends?), but that was the last thing that was timely. 

After our order was finally taken about 15 minutes into our visit, it took another 15 to get a Calamansi juice, after we called the server over to remind her... and that was the last contact I had with ANY server until I finally said something AN HOUR AFTER ORDERING OUR FOOD. There were no refill offers, no check ins, no apologies, until AFTER I got visually upset. This is unacceptable. 

The family across from us received their food in 10-15minute spurts and also had to keep asking about their dishes. The table next to them was even worse! Their Halo Halo was sent to them before they received ANY OF THEIR HOT FOOD. You literally brought out their FROZEN DESSERT FIRST. I mean, isn't that embarrassing?! Letting their Halo Halo melt before they even get to have their hot food? 

Needless to say, unless I see some improved reviews on here, I doubt I'll be coming back for my Filipino food fix. At the speed of your service I could literally drive to the market, go shopping, and cook my own meal before I'd get my food from you.

Never setting foot here again. Not quite as bad as Salo Salo and the other Filipino food spots giving our food a bad name for their uh, lack of cleanliness but close. The only saving grace was your food.. and well even then that's not saying much. Basically I had a gang of my co-workers come over to join me for LJ's kamayan dinner like 15 heads deep and when it was all said and done service was hard as hell to come by -- like pulling teeth just to get a glass of water, not authentic as we had wanted, the kamayan plates were completely uneven (some missing items thinking perhaps we wouldn't catch it) and to top it off we were over charged. 

Mind you up until this dinner I'm trying to get a menu listing out of the server hostess (again pulling teeth), calling them several times in advance, telling them we are coming. Its like the didn't take my reservation for 15 heads seriously.

It was weird, everyone getting a separate tab for drinks... then like 15 minutes later getting another tab for our food. Say whaaat? Yeah. Then towards the end of the meal the manager tries to sweat us talking about we failed to pay for one person. Manager realizes he fucked up and falls back after further inspecting the bill.

We dropped a good amount of coin on the place and it was a nightmare. How are you gonna take us for granted with nearly all of us being CULINARY PROFESSIONALS.

Sidenote - Still having had a hankering for real Filipino food, fast forward a few weeks later me and some frustrated but determined Filipino co-workers gathered to throw down our version of what a real kamyan dinner was like and we rocked it.",E19IMURE4WEoCnvDx-bylg,8,6,1,6HehR_7qLRzem83WlaVYTQ

I am always only interested in what can be done!

Filipino food is my favorite cuisine so I'll return for the food! As for the service, perhaps it's time to phase out the old and update it along with the menu!

We were the only people in the restaurant.  The menu is so confusing and hard to understand.  They have the word ""Pub"" in there name, where was the pub?!We had to ask for another menu with pictures just to comprehend what the items looked like and even then they didn't describe what it was.  There was also way too many choices to chose from.  Less is better!

On to the reason for the review...I ordered crispy chicken from the lunch menu for $6.99 and it came with steamed rice.  The squash had no flavor at all and neither did the chicken.  It was actually smothered in grease.  The server brought out the rice that I inquired about but ultimately decided on the crispy chicken; brought out the fried rice dish anyway.  I felt there was a communication barrier and just a lack of competence altogether.  My wife's dish didn't even look half way descent with raw onions just thrown on top of her pork dish.  The pork had so much fat it was ridiculous!  She had to literally sit there throughout the meal picking the fat off the pork (yes it was that bad).

Bottom line I don't think I'll be coming back here and there's a reason it was dead for lunch.  Menu is overloaded with choices; no pictures on the menu to see what you're getting, food is bland bland bland, and service sucks.  I feel ripped off that I spent $51.51 to feel sick afterwards.

3933120,2016-05-08,0,pooAgpZJn79L7JTgcK-o-Q,"The quality of the food is pretty good here; prices are a bit higher than many other Filipino places because they prepare food as you order it rather than having it sitting out buffet style and you point (turo-turo). But for the serving size it's comparable to other Filipino restaurants in the area (check prices when you order a large meat dish at other places and you'll see).

Usually we get food to go because the service is somewhat slow, but the servers are always very nice, if somewhat spread thin by the ratio of diners to servers. The restaurant itself, however, is always very clean and you don't leave smelling like your Lola's kitchen when you're done eating, unlike many other ethnic restaurants.

The bistek bangus (milkfish fried and served in a lemon soy sauce, with onions) is delicious but if you order it to go, they cram it into a large soup container, which in my opinion screws up presentation. It still tastes really good, though! This is probably our favorite menu item here.

The insarabasab (like sisig but more lemony) is good, but then again I've never seen it at any other Filipino restaurant so far so I can't compare it to anything else. The pork sisig itself was just okay, and I wasn't a fan of the dinakdakan (sisig with mayo).

Their lomi (thick noodles in a sauce with veggies) is delicious!

The pinakbet is great; nobody can really screw this dish up EXCEPT they cannot make it without pork, so if you're vegetarian you may want to go someplace else.

Overall: not a bad place to go if you've got a hankering for Filipino food, but be prepared to wait a little for their delicious food.",Tc5A5a5fDpPt8stps6cAHQ,1,0,4,GkEwBUios1lhqABj_H1CuQ

The one star is for their great pho. Everything else gets a big whopping 0! 

When we walked in we were never properly greeted. Instead the waitress just pointed at a table that was available. We read a sign that said their food options for the day. The waitress came to our table and just stared at us with her iPad in hand. We assumed she wanted us to start ordering, but she never vocalized it. Just stared until we started to order. We tried ordering off of the sign but the waitress said those options were unavailable. I was with my extended family who are Filipino so they translated what she was saying to us. But we didn't need a translation to see that she had an attitude. It was clear that she did not want to be there. We then tried to order off of their lunch specials menu. She again gave us attitude while stating that they did not have lumpia because there was a wedding party that reserved the lumpia. I don't understand why they just didn't make more lumpia, enough for the wedding and for their restaurant patrons. They knew that the wedding party was coming because you need to reserve those things in advanced. We finally ordered bangus, lechon kawali, fried rice, and soup. She asked us if that was all. My friend responded ""oh, and chicken adobo"". The waitress said ""okay"". We then asked ""did you get the chicken adobo"" and she did not respond. My friends father asked if she can make sure there was no msg in our food. She again did not respond and just walked away from our table. We get our diet cokes 10 minutes later and they were lacking fizz and syrup. We told the RUDE waitress and she said in Tagalog that there was nothing she could do about it and practically blamed us for not enjoying it. We then talked to the other waitress and she said that she would change the soda machines. Finally our food comes out and it was disgusting. Yes, lechon kawali can be very greasy but it was overloaded with grease and hardly any meat. You could feel the grease sticking to the roof of your mouth and clinging onto your uvula. Our fried rice was coated with thick grease. What oils are they using in the back? Must be a vasoline, crisco, bacon fat, and corn oil mix. We ate most of our food while still awaiting the arrival of the chicken adobo. We then called the waitress over to remind her of our order of adobo. She said okay and left. At this point we were starting to get full but waited 10 more minutes. We called her back and asked about the adobo. She then said that we didn't order it and it's not on her iPad. We told her we did order it and would still like to get some. She of course gave attitude. This chick does not need to be employed by any company until she goes to attitude classes. This chick was rolling her eyes at other restaurant goers and just did not care to be there AT ALL! Go home then lady! I'd rather serve my damn self then have to deal with her again. Anyways, we received the adobo about 20 minutes later. We then received the check about 30 minutes later, and received boxes for our food about 20 minutes after we paid the bill. The waitresses during our waiting time were just stocking cutlery. Overall this experience SUCKED!

when we ordered, our first 3 things we ordered...they said they don't have.  this too, happens very often at DTs.  pretty terrible to have 6 pages of a menu, but have numerous items not available.  also, for 12 of us, they gave us 3 menus!  wow!  I had to get up myself to the front to get more menus.  

we asked if we could change the channel on one of the 2 tvs to Monday night football - janet said that the person who can change the channels is not there!  what?!?!?!  so we're stuck w/ tmz for dinner...wonderful.  amazing how they don't have a 'the person there who changes the channel' - I can't even understand this...  so I asked, when you leave for the night, the tv stays on and she just looked at me and walked away. 

we ordered over $250 worth of food and they forgot 1 item.  they said it was still cooking but we were already done and she said we can't cancel it.  I went to go back to talk to her by the kitchen to say that's unacceptable, but I was able to overhear her talking to her cook in tagalog that they forgot the chicken dish and to cook it quickly!  once she walked out, and saw me, she ran back in the kitchen to say, nevermind.  she then came out to say bc we ordered so much, she will be happy to cancel the order.  apparently, she's doing me a favor by canceling the order they forgot.  

very sad that this business is ran like this.  similar to DTs, food is good, but the business aspect of it is terrible.  unfortunately, I see the owner pretty often either at DTs or his Filipino store on rainbow and he could care less, he definitely is about the money and not representing his wife's culture well.",GZsDson951e0NKvWWMukGg,1,0,2,AnO5YPJZUzpfU_5_ofLIMA

If you like bagoong, there is a dish here you MUST try! It's called the Crispy Binagoongan. Surprisingly, I have never had this before. It comes with fried crispy pork (sliced like lechon), sliced jalapenos, onions, garlic, and yes oil. It is very oily, but worth a try, on your cheat meal of course...if you're a healthy eater like me. It comes with fried talong (eggplant), we ordered it with extra eggplant. 

Another must try here is... If you love garlic like I do, you'll LOVE the garlic fried rice here! They added a lot of fried minced garlic. 

We also ordered pork and more pork. 2 more pork dishes. Don't ask me why, I wasn't ordering. haha. Crispy Pata and Lechon Kawali. I didn't like these. Both of these dishes, the pork skin was hard and the meat was dry even though it was drenched in oil. I'm not a fan of either of these dishes in general, so I wouldn't order it again. The Crispy Pata was mostly bone. 

They also have a Vietnamese menu, desserts and boba drinks. And their specials can be found on a menu at the front door. 

Service was great! There was only one waitress working that day and she handled it flawlessly. There must have been 5 other groups of people that came in after us. She was kind and friendly. The interior was warm, inviting, and homey. It's got both a Filipino and Vietnamese flair to it. 

It's located in a private lot, and there's always tons of parking. 

I will be back for the Binagoongan, just thinking about it my mouth is salivating. I will be back for you and to try other items on the menu.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,4,5,4,JCCirDuY20TwMstAH5iQKw

I ordered the lechon kawali, chicken adobo, garlic rice and bihon guisado and i ordered to go
The lechon came in a styrofoam cup closed with aluminum foil..not even a proper lid and the lechon itself was extra greasy, gelatinous and gross
The chicken adobo was the worst if them all, it was just riddled with jelly like chicken fat and the chicken part themselves were dry and flavorless. And on top of that, it came the same way the lechon came but with only 5 pieces..for 10 bucks...
The bihon guisado was tolerable at best, it was basically just drowned in oil and veggies, taste was probably like a 5 from 1-10
And the garlic rice was probably the best thing, and thats not saying a lot cus for 9 bucks you get a whopping serving of rice with garlic and oil...
This place is such a rip off for not just the quality but also quantity. I paid a total of $43 for some sub par food. Never coming back, never recommending anyone to go.

P.S when i walked in, i had to wait almost 15 minutes before someone greeted me..and there was NO ONE in the restaurant...what an establishment....",edzi4cn5uB5QOlGwA7ckEA,1,0,1,Dclgt9d4segkT59Vl2YhCQ

1- I was looking at the menu on the counter before taking my order and the waitress just throws more menus on top of mine. So rude of her
2- I ordered Thai Tea w/ boba along with my food. She came out after 5 mins and with the most rude tone and stare ""Thai tea Boba!"" -- I was waiting for the lady in front of her to finish ordering before I took my drink that was set in front of her. 2 seconds later, that rude tone and stare ""your Thai tea boba"" -- I heard you! 
3- I only ordered 3 food items (appetizers). 3 people who came after us, received their BIG orders within minutes.
4- after waiting an hour, I kindly asked the waitress ""is our order ready?"" while looking inside the kitchen door window I see her grab our food on the table, all ready and packed, then she hands it to us and we leave
5- Lastly, no utensils came with our food, not even one napkin.

So I initially came into LJ's with an open mind that the food wouldn't be like my grandma's home cooked meals or any other Filipino restaurant I've been to. It wasn't busy so I walked right in with my family, and just picked a sitting area. Someone came to give us our drinks and another lady came in to take our order. It being our first time there we asked for some recommendations, there weren't really any help since it was already labeled on the menu when she pointed out chicken dishes, pork dishes, rice dishes, etc. We ordered the pinactbit, fried rice, and a pork dish (forgot the name of). To describe the food, salty, very salty. I would try to balance out the saltiness from the food with white rice, especially how we ordered fried rice I had to add additional white rice to that as well. Flavor is good but the saltiness overpowered the dish. It seemed as if shrimp paste was heavily added to the pinactbit, which in my opinion was problematic. I didn't order pinactbit to just taste salty shrimp paste, I was hoping for the soup flavor of the dish and the veggies pop out.

This was my first Filipino food experience so unfortunately I don't know much about how it compares to authentic Filipino plates. 

I had the SINIGANG, with pork belly. It has a sour flavor to it but I thought it was pretty good. I added some sir racha for spice and also added some white rice to the soup.. The veggie combination was awesome. We also tried LUGAW which I'm told is similar to rice porridge, along with an appetizer of lumpia.. I couldn't have been more satisfied.

We came to this restaurant on Saturday around 2pm with my family. My Aunt raved about this place. There was 9 of us and we really wanted to eat there for halo halo but after looking at the menu some of the family decided to order. 

We ordered the Tapsilog. OMG, it's was delicious! From the eggs to the rice to the tapa everything was well seasoned and cooked. Def a must!

My cousin ordered the meatball pho and I took a bite and have to say the portion was HUGE def good for 2-3 people and the broth was very flavorful. 

We ordered 2 appetizers. Chicken wings which was okay and Shanghai. The Shanghai was not bad either except in my opinion it didn't have enough meat inside. 

We also ordered 4 halo halo. It was good. The ice was nice and smooth and it was decently priced for the size. 

Lastly, my Aunt ordered grilled Pampano (fish). It took them over an hour to serve it. When we followed up on it they said it was taking a while bc it was being grilled.

Roll up your sleeves and wash your hands. Let's dig in on some Filipino food! We ordered 2 platters that could feed 10-12 people, and there was only 6 of us. The platter is set and you can't sub and swap items. The menu doesn't say what kind of stuff comes with the platter and the servers can't help you either. It should have been called a SURPRISE platter! You just wish it has everything you like and not allergic to. You get clam chowder, crispy pata (fried pork leg), garlic rice, white rice, binagoongan (meat cooked in shrimp paste aka bagoong), fried fish filets, lumpia Shanghai, ampalaya (bitter melon), chicken wings, chicken skin, pancit, and lengua (beef tongue).

The clam chowder was weird. You get whole clams - shell and all. There was a lot on the Kamayan platter I don't eat: binagoongan, ampalaya and lengua. The crispy pata was good but the rest were just ok. The garlic rice was too oily which made it hard to eat with my bare fingers.

The whole set up was FAIL. They don't give you banana leaves or a plate to put your food on and the platter was not big enough so you could eat off of it. 

The service was pretty bad. It took us 3 hours from the time we got there to the time we left. There were only 2 servers - only 1 was helpful. The other person doesn't even care to know what's on their menu. They were not attentive. They keep forgetting what we ordered. 

It's half Vietnamese, half Filipino. You'll see pho, boba tea and then Filipino dishes. I ordered mais con hielo for dessert but they ran out of creamed corn. I ordered a Thai tea with boba instead. It tastes nothing like Thai tea. It was more like burnt caramel. The group ordered leche flan which happens to be my favorite Filipino dessert. It was alright - it wasn't creamy enough.

Based on the disappointment written all over my face that evening, I was told we should do ala carte next time because the dishes are better. I don't know anymore...",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,6,2,3EYrTsnxxVPwZQt0-kB8iA

My reviews 

I called the restaurant to placed my order thru phone. I was greeted by the guy but I would like to say that he sounds like he wasnt working there.. Im sorry cause he is being slow to list or punch in all my orders..

Total Price : $67 .. a lot expensive than what I expected

I ordered 2 Oxtail Fried Rice; the eggs is both overcooked. I love the rice actually its just too oily .. My husband is an american and he doesnt like it so much cause it has a really strong flavor.

Ginataang Langka w. Green beans (Coconut milk with unripe jackfruit and green beans)
; The Jackfruit i think its not fresh the color is too dark (maybe frozen), and the slice is so thick. I dont taste any flavor of jackfruit i feel like i paid for the greenbeans. It has 3 pieces big shirmp and I dont understand why it taste so sweet and please next time fill it up all the way to the container mine has a 2-3 inch space from above..

Grilled Liempo (Inihaw na Pork Belly) 
I love the tenderness of the pork.. But its so different from the usual grilled pork. The liempo i ordered is kinda similar to a pulled pork and i think it got boiled for several hours and they grilled it. And it doesnt have a sweet taste. But i like the flavor. they added fresh tomatoes, fresh onion n cilantro..

Chicken Inasal (Chicken Skewer)
Im so disappointed .. I think they fry it first before they grill it. Very unusual way of cooking an Inasal. Its a lil bit dry and bland.

*Desserts

Sago't Gulaman is too sweet (i added a lot of water so i can drink it) i like the flavor ..thank you mine has a lot boba and black jello)

Halo Halo is just okay ... It has a leche flan n ube..and very few toppings
