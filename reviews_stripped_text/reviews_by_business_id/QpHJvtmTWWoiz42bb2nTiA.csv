There were 2 other trucks there, at the first the food just sounded odd so skip that, the 2nd truck I have eaten at a few times already, so we skipped straight to Flowrider as I have been wanting to check it out.  I didn't have much money to spend so the $6 deals were my best option although I wasn't sure it would be enough food.  Both me and my partner got the mini philly combo with just meat, cheese, onions and bread. It came with fries and a 12 oz can of soda.  We found a place to sit down and started grubbing.  The sandwich was so hot and gooey, the cheese sauce complimented the meat so well and it was hard to believe the roll could hold it all together.  The meat was well seasoned and tender, there was the perfect amount of cheese and grilled onion on it.  I was shocked, this was the best philly I have had here and I eat them everywhere.  It was so good I went to Capriottis the next day to get a philly cause Flowrider's made me crave them but the 9"" sandwich I got from Capriottis didn't even compare to the 4"" sandwich I got from flowrider.  That little 4 inches was so filling and delicious I could eat one every day if my arteries could take it.  The fries were kind of plain and I didn't see any type of sauce or seasoning available for them so about half of them got thrown away but it was okay, I was stuffed and got my moneys worth.  A big plus is that they sell Coke from Mexico which has less carbonation than the American version, the drawback -they charge $2.50 for one. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu now.",02Qbod85rFWE1xZrvUdu6w,1,0,4,E6ZVLzQ1uOMGnQCCJdog3A

The first thing you will notice about Flowrider is their Portions, let's just say they're BIG, and every order includes fries and a drink.

The menu is pretty expansive, I had D Porker, which can best be summed up as a deli that exploded and ended up on a bun, D Porker includes: Fried pork, beef, bacon, ham, sliced hot dog, beans, egg, muenster cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, served on a grill french bread.

It was a huge sandwich (camera on my phone doesn't work so I was unable to snap a photo), but trust me it was impressive!

The fries were rather forgettable, but it's nice that they were included along with a drink, other trucks are a la carte and the price can add up quickly.

My friend had the 12"" Loco Dog which includes: A 12"" beef dog wrapped with bacon, grill onions, jalapeno relish, special sauce, and guacamole on grill bun

He said it was really good, a little messy, but good.

I liked Flowrider, they still have a few kinks to work out, but given time they could become a contender for the vegas food truck crown.

Ok...here's my few complaints so they can work on improving and getting 4 or 5 stars on my next visit.

1- The fries are weak, they were under seasoned, a little soggy, and were rather blah. I may have just gotten a bad batch, but they were pretty forgettable.

2- The Toppings, there is a point when you reach overkill, when a sandwich has more than 10 items on it you might be going a little overboard, all of the ingredients in my Porker were great, but they got lost when they were mixed all together, I actually dissected my second half and ate it piece by piece, all of the meats were amazing, but it may be a little overkill.

3- Location I know finding places is hard when you start you, and the place you were at had a ton of traffic (rainbow and russel), parking was ok (hospital lot across the street), but there were no tables, benches, grassy areas, or anywhere to sit, I don't mind eating in my car, but if a group of people want to eat it can be a little hard.

4- Your Hours, I know you're new and you are still getting things worked out, but being open 3 hours a day 11a-2p is not enough time for people to get a chance to try your grub. I really think with your portions and prices, you would be a better late night truck than a lunch truck, you could corner the post bar greasy food market if you found the right location and got the word out!!!

I will give flowrider truck a few more tries, and hopefully they earn a few more stars, the more quality trucks this town gets, the better!!!",hyIVFPfm3TyPWQf0Xh9u1Q,8,5,3,2IY26ikKilpRuYqXOydUzQ
3617660,2010-09-10,1,QpHJvtmTWWoiz42bb2nTiA,"Due to my incurable desire to try all the food trucks in Vegas I had to stop by  Flow Rider truck since it was not too far from where I live. Flow rider truck's design is interesting, you can't see in the pictures but it has a background of the strip to go along with its sin city theme.

First off I would like to say that their portions puts pretty much everything to shame. I'm thinking that goes along with the sin city theme, giant proportions that are not good for you, but you can't help. Food can range anywhere from $4.50 to $20. The $20 item is this huge burger with 8 sirloin patties and many other things. 

Anyways I only ordered two lunch specials, the mini loco dog and the mini hydrolic, but man for $4.50 it makes me regret touching subway. I believe that there are four specials, which are mini versions of their regular menu, comes with a McDonald's medium size of fries and a 20 oz soda, great lunch deal if you ask me.  This is not diet friendly food, but you only live once. Moving on the mini loco dog which is 6 inches, its a California street dog of giant proportions. The huge beef dog is wrapped with bacon and top with avocado, lightly grilled onions, relish, some kind of sauce, and maybe parsley and jalape√±os? The only nitpick I have with it is that my bread broke in the middle so it was a bit messy, but good nonetheless. 

The fries were lightly crisp and nice, but were unseasoned, which is ok for me since they provide a station of the side for you to add your condiments and seasonings. 

The lady who took my order was nice, told me how although flow rider truck is new they have been in the mobile truck business for a few years.

Overall I like flow rider truck and hope to visit them more often in the future.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,5,4,4,0G0_uXHRXQRjhWfBpoNiug
5051502,2010-09-09,3,QpHJvtmTWWoiz42bb2nTiA,"My BF just left home and I'm getting a call from him. Uhoh. 

Nothing to worry about- he was just letting me know that he saw Flowrider right by our house. He knows how I love my food trucks, even way before it was cool to go curbside. Gotta love a thoughtful man. 

I grabbed the Philly Rider which is Beef  with grilled onions, mushrooms, green & red peppers, topped with melted cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and jalapenos on a 9"" grill french roll. Comes with fries and you get a choice of bottled drinks (the usual sodas, water and some Jaritos) for $10.  

Wowwweee this was huge of a sandwich. I grabbed a fork to work it out and I definitely think they should stock a lot of fork and knives! LOL I liked my sandwich a lot and thought the flavors work well. I do like Philly cheesesteaks but I'm not a ""cheesesteak person"" because it gets too dense and rich with just a whole lot of meat and cheese going on. I like their take because the crisp lettuce gives a crunchy texture and tomatoes and jalapenos lightens up the flavors a bit. I might be stating blasphemy for some right now in saying that I will probably get this philly over Pops. Pops is good but too damn rich that I always have to share a sandwich and get other sides and another sandwich to break up the dense flavors.

 I ate a good amount of fries first and I thought that it was lightly crispy and good. They weren't seasoned, but apparently before they put seasoning and some people thought there was too much so they're trying without. I added a packet of salt to get it to where I want it. Since they are sitting most under the sandwich, I think that's really where it can pose a problem with losing its crispness since the weight of the sandwich is on it.

The ingredients were fresh and quality so they weren't skimping quality to make their big quantities. Some of their options are wild like the D Porker, but I think a lot of people can get into some of the other offerings. You can always strip it down if you're not a ""topping person"".  Theres also some ""mini"" options for smaller appetites and really nothing is stopping anyone to share some of these. I got maybe a 3rd of my food it before I had to take it to-go to eat a little later. 

As I was eating I got talking to the crew about food truck culture, randomness and a bit about themselves. Apparently they're not new to foodtrucks- they ran a taco truck that went to construction sites for 2 years and have gone this new route into the ""culture"". When it comes to this business, personable people go a long way. It's no secret that I go where food is good, but I frequent places where the staff/owners are people that make you feel at ease and makes me feel like I'm eating at a relatives house. In fact, ""Pelon"" reminds me of  one of my Tios.  It was very comfortable talking to Gigi who runs the orders and ""Flaco"" and ""Pelon"" manning the line. I normally never let businesses know about Yelp or that I'm a Yelper, but it was really easy to talk to them and they were very receptive to wanting to know what people think and what can be done better. I also rarely give suggestions while I'm at a business since I never want to put my mouth where it don't belong and cause tension, but since they were receptive I threw out some ideas that might help like putting fries in a paper bag on the side and maybe leaving the french fry seasoning out so people can season or not to their liking. Maybe see some locations where people can sit curbside or on some grass since that lot is really rocky (I suggested to check out the Centennial Hills Park/Library/YMCA area). I really want to see this truck succeed. 

After reading Chris M.s review, I can see where he's going with the night time venue. Don't get me wrong, I would eat this for lunch, but I'm just a late night person so I just woke up and threw on clothes at 1:30pm to catch them in the 3hour slot that they're out for the day. A few longer days or maybe a day where it's late night might bring more customers. A late night honker of a sandwich to end the night....hell yes that would be lovely. Fuku does it and they're always with a crowd. Perfect nightcap (dinner often times for night owls like me), drunk food, stoner food....and that's not a downer comment coming from me, it's a high compliment since I usually want a lot of things while in a ""altered state"" but at the same time get very oddly picky of what I would eat. This would be a good one to go to First Friday and those Thristy Thursdays bar crawls. 

I think for them being open only for a week they are doing good. Every truck here that's doing well had to work kinks out.  I see some promise here and hope they do well. Since they used to do a taco truck, I have to try their tacos next- The Super Tacation.

Once they get more into their Flow I can get into following this Rider.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,4,4,V90GLGwd5jhueEp5vYdGWw
