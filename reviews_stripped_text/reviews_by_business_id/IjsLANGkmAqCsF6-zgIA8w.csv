Steve the owner was great to talk to, very helpful and responded quickly to any questions I had. Steve also did our reception. He did great with all our song choices and music genres we wanted, including extra requests we had. He also paid attention to everything I wanted (the bride) and made sure not to go against my wishes. The only thing I wasn't pleased with was DJ steves attitude towards my guests. He was quick to deny guests of song requests and had a rude demeanor. We had signed a contract for 7:00-11:00.. when we actually had the venue space til 11:30 ( my mistake)... Everyone was having a great time so I asked him if he could continue playing until 11:30. He quickly responded no, then rudely stated, I need $100 right now. I'm not upset with him requesting additional money, I just didn't like his tone or attitude with my guests or how he responded when i requested additional time. He was not very personable or friendly to anyone. His attitude needs to be more welcoming and friendly during a wedding where everyone is looking to have a good time and in great spirits. Other then his rudeness, the music he played was good.",6MOYr32ZL7IaB3xthJzAUw,1,0,3,bulmxVZSMsEfuaS9CbM3_g
1766377,2018-01-25,0,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,Choosing these DJs for our reception was the best decision we made!! They were wonderful!! Super easy to work with and the music was fantastic!! We had several children at our reception and they even played a little children's music for them to dance. It was such a cool and the kids loved it! They made our reception perfect!! I would definitely book them again if I needed a DJ for an event!!,EhGTRDAyVEZsFXdVev0IbA,0,0,5,__eF5SNR3GE4tG2lFnHRZg
1777719,2015-01-16,1,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,"im not one to complain but DJ Steve SUCKED.... as a regular dj he knew how to keep the music going but for a family/wedding that likes newer club (turn up) music he did not do well. he nagged us for 3 weeks to compose a list of songs and once we sent it to him on the day of our wedding only two..that's right 2 songs from our whole list of at least 200 songs were played the whole reception. many of our family and guest started to leave 2 hours before the reception was over because nobody was feeling the music. he completely ruined our wedding reception. 

THANKS FOR RUINING OUR SPECIAL DAY.....

if you like newer party music then PLEASE do not waste your money.",puh8-UYJNu80cGXMrVc0pw,1,1,1,iEFLDjxjbJP8glqU93TTVA

He treated us with the most respect, was super easy to work with, and did such a great time getting the dance floor moving! He knew how to read his audience and play a song at the perfect timing :)
My favorite part you might ask.... he let me sing karaoke because I was the bride hahah :)",EJXUHkai6FLEIBTNpLx7BA,1,0,5,QmvChrFA8TZ5exGAgmURbQ
2558403,2015-10-29,2,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,"Yikes! Unfortunately, our DJ was the one and only AWFUL thing about our wedding. We were so displeased with DJ Steve (yes, the owner) I couldn't believe it-- even with the 5 star reviews on The Knot and the positive video testimonials.

We had a small, intimate wedding but Steve DJ-ed like he was at a club. A lot of shouting, a lot of aggressive remarks, it just made us all uncomfortable and not what we were expecting. As a DJ, you should feel our your crowd to see what type of audience it is... that didn't happen. 

- When asked if we can meet with Steve before the wedding, his assistant said he's a pro and hasn't met with a couple in over 10 years, so we didn't meet with him. Wish we could have, because it would've been clear our personalities didn't mesh.

- We filled out four repetitive papers regarding our music taste and wedding reception timeline. We also spoke with Steve a week or two before the wedding to review everything. All of this was disregarded the night of our reception. As we arrived to our reception venue, Steve pulled us aside to ask what the timeline would be, would we be doing a bouquet toss, etc. He was jotting down handwritten notes on his papers, but these questions had all been answered previously.

- Steve would say remarks that made our guests feel bad/guilty for not dancing, which it should've been clear he wasn't playing good music. ""YOU will make MEMORIES for the bride and groom if you dance and also if you don't dance. AGAIN, I REPEAT, YOU will be MAKING MEMORIES if you dance""... or ""I still see some people sitting down over there... COME DANCE!"" Either take a hint that people are enjoying conversation with their families, or play better music to get people to dance! Don't shout at them and make them feel guilty!

- His music shut off at least 4-5 times and his response was a look on his face like he didn't know how to fix it.

- There was a song played that had a tambourine in it... Steve played that part of the song longer and brought out two of his own tambourines and shook them in front of the stage for what felt like 2 minutes. Is this a circus?

- He played music we specifically asked him not to play.

- When we didn't smear cake over each other at our cake cutting, Steve shouted into the mic and asked our guests ""Who wants them to do that again!??!?!"" Aggressive!

- He realized at the event that he didn't have some of the music we requested (i.e. our last dance song) so he picked his own song and followed it up with the Warner Bros ""That's All Folks"" clip... SO TACKY! And something he should've seen beforehand and told us to pick another song.

- At the end of the reception, he hounded me and the groom to fill our a survey so he can win an award. He also emailed us twice on our honeymoon saying ""Sorry to bug while you're on your honeymoon, but we're up for this award...""

Spend your money elsewhere and DO NOT book this DJ. And I'm sure DJ Steve will reply to this note and say ""We can only be as fun as your guests allow us to be..."" but take accountability for your poor reviews and make a change. People were uncomfortable with your antics.",UmP7uumUkg3rXVSyDGm0hA,6,0,1,kgWHzysLze5JwewJVPvTCw

3567907,2018-06-18,0,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,This is the second year we've used Best of the Best for our corporate event. Steve was great to work with! He was professional and provided great entertainment. I didn't have the time to pre-select any songs but he did an awesome job of working with his selections to get our group dancing and keep them on the floor. He wanted to make sure I was pleased as the host and made sure to check in with me regularly to play anything that I or my group might want. I would highly recommend best of the best as you won't be disappointed.,QmMjyqEqxMtuRipjtd9_zQ,0,0,5,CTfZ6riS-Zp7oMwn_vTiNQ
3918072,2015-10-29,0,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,"Do not book them unless you have it guaranteed that the owner, steve, will be your DJ.. not another Steve, who does absolutely NOTHING for your reception. While he played good music, he did NOTHING to move our reception along. He barely spoke on the microphone. He was not watching to make sure our grand entrance worked.. he didn't even announce us. He brought a microphone and sound system that made it impossible for toasts. I was so looking forward to using this company. I planned on booking another one until I talked to the owner and he told me about his DJ style and how many weddings he had done, and so on. He had a personal tragedy that weekend and was unable to work, but his replacement was terrible. Absolutely terrible.

UPDATE: in response to the owner's reply.. my guests did all the work. We had a good time, because WE had a good time.  Not because the DJ did anything to move it along. Our guests yelled their speeches because of ineffective equipment. It's also interesting he cites a death in the family because he told me that he was sick. ?",SQLmKJ1ke9LD-XNmoLw5Tg,0,0,1,bJd3itIal440aPiv_FlEIg
5451268,2016-10-05,0,IjsLANGkmAqCsF6-zgIA8w,"Best of the best DJ was chosen for me through my booking of the Mob Museum for my wedding. I had a great conversation with Steve early in the year to ensure he knew my style and expectations for the biggest night of my life.
Two weeks prior to the event, I sent in the four pages of paperwork that they requested. This included the entrance songs, our preferences of special dances, types of music we wanted, etc. I followed up to suggest a phone conference to ensure that the evening went off without a hitch and to make sure that Steve was well equipped with the details I was looking for. Carolyn responded that Donny would now be my DJ and no conference was necessary.
I met Donny when I was headed up the elevator to the ceremony. I have to say that he was polite and professional. My best guess is that the company threw him into the situation with nothing to go on.

We had to wait an extra 10 minutes to enter the reception because Donny didn't know what songs we wanted to come in to.

Later he asks who will be doing the blessing, which I indicated would not be a part of the reception on our paperwork.

When the dancing finally begins, he then announces that the group should form two lines for the ""money dance"" - also something we opted out of. I spun around and said ""NOPE"" and he moves on to the bouquet toss...ANOTHER thing we said we didn't want. HOW EMBARRASSING.

At this point he clearly found our paperwork somehow because about 30 mins before our wedding was over he finally played songs that we requested rather than the ones we asked them NOT to play. 

I received an email today asking how things went because the ""feedback has been positive so far"". I can't imagine where any positive feedback came from. I asked for a good time to talk to them personally and have not received a response as of yet.

The 5 star review on here is clearly a plant.",y_XgW02VKRwDKGhHq17yuA,2,0,1,jlOMeCP6zSezkSz_96KUVA
