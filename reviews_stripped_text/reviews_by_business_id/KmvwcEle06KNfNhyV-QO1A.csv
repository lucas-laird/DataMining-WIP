I got a little bored with the restaurant delivery options that were in the Northwest area and discovered this little place from GrubHub.com. I wasn't in the mood for pizza, but they have a ton of other options on their menu. So I decided to order from them! I ordered their wings, a side of meatballs and their Chicken Casa. Everything was absolutely delicious, tasted fresh and had a great bite at the end. Much cheaper than other locations in the area and tasted much better.

I had my first visit there yesterday after driving by it for years.
I had the double hitter pizza, and yes, it was the best pizza I've had all year.
Butcher bought meats and cheeses, homemade dough and sauces, nothing premade so you won't ever see the dreaded Sysco truck anywhere near this place.

I tend to hit the small independent joints and only go with chains for feeding people I don't care much about. hah

Anyway, they have a full on legit menu.
If a self-claimed Italian joint doesn't have tira mi su, I don't go back. They have it. Cannoli too.

I will be going back, definitely for pizza, and today I plan on testing their chicken parm sammich.",mfh0N8JSVtLudPZ_tC_Ofg,1,0,5,zvW8BqqRrERu8RHCQPeNWA

Ever since I found SNY, I don't like to go anywhere else for a pie, but there is a pattern to my madness.
I would call the stainless steel counter for a seat a little tacky, but with me working in industrial kitchens for 20+ years, it actually felt really good to sit at one and not have to measure out flour and yeast.
The pizza was way better than Metro's but still not up to Street's pizza. I also  had the steak strips which were a delight- perfectly cooked and accompanied with 3 sauces because I couldn't make up my mind. 
I'm definitely coming back, but more than likely for a burger because I'm a burger kind of person. My pizza pie is spoken for. But if I have a craving for Mark Rich's, I don't need to travel anymore, because La Bella's is a little further than Metro, but worth the extra 2 minutes, plus I don't have to wait more than 20 minutes.

We came here on a whim as I wanted to try a new place on our side of town that was on restaurant.com. We used a $15 gift certificate here and ordered a bunch of food. It is a small pizza shop and feels like you're eating in somebody's home. It was very nice. It was nothing fancy, the food was very tasty and the service was very good.

It appeared that the owner's wife and I have their son or worker were there. They took orders cook the food within view of our table from scratch and as I said, it was very tasty.  My wife and I agreed that the garlic knots for the best ones that we've ever had as they were white fluffy not too dense or two greasy. I had the caprese salad which was also very good in the balsamic reduction was delicious. The pizza was very good also. The sauce was a little bit on the sweeter side but appeared to be homemade.  My wife and I both had a Stromboli for dinner. She had an eggplant Stromboli and I had a grilled chicken, basil, sun-dried tomato, garlic Stromboli. They pretty much give you creative freedom for certain dishes if you would like to have some sort of custom Stromboli or calzone etc.

I would definitely come back here as it is a small mom and pop restaurant with fresh food and great service.  I just hope they stay in business as they are tucked away in their shopping center.",LMU20NC9aCIa6ROQd-LHmA,2,0,4,iNuzGIz9YYsMff2KSkQmIA

I said no please have cooked now.  It took 20+ minutes for us to get our pasta. My husbands spaghetti was awful, it was spicy and bitter tasting and the meatballs were ice cold. My pasta sauce was suppose to have sundries tomatoes, non were present but instead there was a huge amount of salt in the sauce. So much salt that it could not be eaten! The waiter admitted he tasted the sauce and  and noted it was terribly salty, but he served it to me anyway.  After sitting there for an entire hour... you'd think our meat lovers pizza would be ready ... we waited another 15 min for it.

2288298,2013-09-25,4,KmvwcEle06KNfNhyV-QO1A,"2.5 star. Got delivery tonight, first time trying LaBellas. First impression, wow big menu with cheap prices. We ordered fried calamari, garlic knots, caprese salad, chicken champagne, a ""Jersey"" sandwich, and a tiramisu.

Delivery was quick, however one of the bags was dripping in what I'll refer to as champagne broth... Not sauce. But more on that later. The delivery guy said ""it was really hot and it was from the stream..."" I didn't care, it smelled good so I anxiously paid the guy, awaiting to begin my feast. 

First up, fried calamari... yum. Super crispy and seasoned well. However the to-go marinara looked like someone crushed it and it had broken open getting over some of the calamari making those soggy. And the marinara was gross. I don't know what it was about it but it was definitely funky. I grabbed a lemon from my fridge (don't know why it didn't come with at least a wedge) and began to devour my crispy, juicy, awesome calamari.

Next up garlic knots. Meh, doughy and not enough seasoning, glad I only got a 6 count order.

Third we tried the caprese salad or ""caprisi"" as the menu we ordered off of from grubhub said. This was middle of the road... Definitely no points for creative plating lol  (not why I took stars off, I know we got delivery I'm not being picky on the plating )there were five plain piles with mozz, roma tomato, and basil. Balsamic vin. on the side. A little salt and pepper would have gone a long way. No seasoning here what so ever, so I tried one as is with the vinegrette. It was alright but then again is hard to mess up caprese. I added some salt and pepper and gobbled it up.

4th my wifes sandwich, the ""Jersey"" sandwich. It's basically a philly cheesesteak with a garlic spread shmeared on the bread. She ordered it lettuce, tomato, and mayo (personally I thought she was weird for ordering it with that but she's preggars and to each their own, right?). Well it turned out being decent, certainly this sandwich need only apply to garlic lovers. Still had harsh raw garlic flavor.

Now my entre, this is where it really went down hill. Chicken champagne, the description on grubhub reads ""Fresh asparagus,  prosciutto, mozzarella, champagne sauce, and fresh mushrooms. Served with choice of pasta with marinara."" Sounds freaking delicious, but where to begin with all the wrong... First, I didn't get and pasta with marinara sauce... but after tasting the marinara from the fried calamari I'm almost glad I didn't have to suffer through that. However since no pasta I did feel a little ripped off. Second, holy shit with the garlic... whoever is the chef take it easy man... good god, enough garlic in this thing to send an army of  vampires straight home to Transylvania. The ""fresh"" asparagus and mushrooms look and tastee like they came from a jar. I'm not saying they did but how they were prepared was was lacking. I don't know if there's a grill in there but blanch your asparagus, take it out and cool it. Little olive oil, salt & pepper and throw that on that grill... Would make this dish 10 times better. Lastly this champagne ""sauce.""... Super soupy, and it's strong with alcohol flavor and not in a good way. And if it wasn't bad enough that it was a garlic infested soupy chamagne ""sauce"" they drown this thing in the stuff.... litterally, it was all over the bag when the delivery guy gave it to me, which means it's all over his car. I spilled probably a cups worth on the floor and there was still like a quart of this garlicy witches brew from hell left in the to-go container. Amongst this diabolical concoction that festers everywhere it goes is what seemed like a butterflied chicken breast cut to look like two breasts. All I was hoping for was a well seasoned chicken breast with prosciutto wrapped grilled asparagus, some nicely sauteed mushrooms, and a sexy buttery REDUCED champane sauce over it... alas, there were so many things wrong with this single dish it probably ruined my opinion of LaBellas. To be honest without this dish this restaurant is probably a 3.5-4 star.

Lastly is the tiramisu, my wife's favorite dessert. Any where that has tiramisu she had to order... This is the first time I can recall her ever not finishing a tiramisu. Kind of small but for 3.50 I'm not holding that against them, alcohol was a little harsh, but the big gripe was that the bottom layer if lady fingers was frozen. I don't care if restaurants have to buy desserts and then resell them at a higher price... I get it, save labor. But c'mon at least make sure it's thawed out before you serve it. 

Over all even though I gave it two stars its one of the few places that deliver where I live... so I'll probably give them another shot. Our atleast stop by and get an order of fried calamari since there's a 15 dollar minimum delivery. I'll be sure to bring a lemon.",p08DIheTHs1DyO7Ijuncxw,1,0,2,fEJ3vvJF8yT8cByBp1fQiQ

My order was cancelled and now I have to wait 24 hours for funds to be released back in my account and I have no food. They are rude and I will never ever do business again. Unreal.

My cheeseburger was amazing, came with golden french fries. The cheesecake was devine. Also tried the pasta salad with italian dressing... loved the dressing and all the veggies in the pasta.  I have the lasagna for later but I nibbled on the cute as heck garlic knots... Loved em.. OVERALL Excellent first visit.. 5 stars.

3972226,2016-09-29,1,KmvwcEle06KNfNhyV-QO1A,I literally found this gem when I was taking night classes. Their chicken garlic calzones are to die for! When I told the owner that I always shared with my husband they always cut the calzone in half and packaged them separate for us everytime I ordered from then on out. I love that the couple that owns this awesome place is dedicated to hiring teens to show them good work ethic.  Tonight is my husband and I's wedding anniversary and knew...that ordering from here would be amazing while staying at home relaxing after a long day. They did not disappoint! White pizza w sausage..omg so delish. And chicken marsala?! Get out...my favorite! They even added my absolute fave tiramisu....I can't rave enough about them!!

4051522,2016-02-11,0,KmvwcEle06KNfNhyV-QO1A,"This place is great. If you're looking for pizza that tastes like someone put a little bit of tomato paste on cardboard. When I say the crust tastes and feels like cardboard, I'm not exaggerating even a little bit. Their sauce is okay but it's not even close to the best. The cheese is probably the worst part though. It's plastic like and it's incredibly oily and it tastes terrible. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Big pizza chains are higher quality for a lower price. I'm sure the people who own the place are great and the atmosphere is okay but I went there to eat pizza and I was so disappointed with my pizza.",AGC_Cy6Sk_z4Z8ITQUvGjQ,0,0,2,YEh0NUr_hnIj6r8g7NQZPg

4137747,2011-08-13,0,KmvwcEle06KNfNhyV-QO1A,"Yay!!!!  Another place to eat just opened up near my work. It's a pizzeria that serves not only pizza but sandwiches,pasta,wraps,wings/fingers,salads,calzones,strombolis,burgers and dessert. The menu is filled with all kinds of yummy stuff....
The owner came into my place of work and told us that lunch would be on him and that tomorrow he would bring some pizzas,garlic knots and zeppoles. He was a nice man who shared with us a little about himself and his love for his kids. 
Well, today was Friday and he did come with what he promised.... First off, I always thought that I would like zeppoles (fried dough, how could I not like it) but everywhere I've tasted them, they always were either too tough,fried too crunchy,covered in too much sugar ect.. But I actually really liked the Zeppoles from here- I liked the cinnamon sugar the best. I think Zeppoles should always taste like these. He brought 2 pizzas that were halfed into cheese,pepperoni,veggie, and Grand Slam (mushrooms,green peppers,onions,sausage,ham,olives &pepperoni). I tried a slice of the Cheese & Grand Slam. 
First off, if you like a chewy crust then you will like the crust here. The cheese pizza had a light tomato sauce - I would've liked more sauce. The Grand Slam was tasty however I normally would never order this pizza as I'm more of a Margarita or Barbecue Pizza type of girl.
The Garlic Knots were good.....
I want to try more items to really have a feel for this place. I want to try the Shrimp/sun dried tomato pasta dish next. I really appreciated the nice gesture of the free food. Thanks LaBella's it was a real treat!!!",_ijx1PqANQVFLGNWCibdig,4,3,3,JK0YPeV0HGzioZOO3zAL_A

My white pizza was good (I'm a fan of more ricotta, where the pizza is oozing with deliciousness. This one was thin and crispy, but still good). The margarita and pepperoni pizzas were SO good! The pepperoni had a bit of a kick to it! The garlic knots were AMAZING!!! I was going to give this establishment three stars (again, the food really is good)... but the fourth star comes into play because of the people who work there. They forgot my cannoli and called me back later to let me know they were on their way to deliver it. I told them it was ok... but they insisted! So nice to see establishments maintaining accountability and doing right by their customers, even if it's just over four mini cannoli.

Not only did they tell us it would take 45 minutes to deliver our pizza and then delivered it an hour and 45 min later,not only was it wrong, they then blamed one of our kids for the error (they accused our kids (3 and 2 1 year olds)of shouting Hawaiian when my husband said plain cheese pizza, they then refused to do anything about it. Oh wait they said they would send a replacement pizza in an about hour because they're  ""just too busy."" I love shopping local but NEVER again will I order from them. And everything was ice cold.
This isn't he first time they have messed up our order, usually they have messed up toppings but in the past they've always fixed it and we're apologetic so we gave them another chance. Never again. We wasted $40 and have to figure dinner out for our kids.

Ordered a pick up order of a gluten free grand slam with extra cheese and my wife got a small olive and extra cheese. When we got home we had a gluten free cheese pizza and my wife's. Called back and told them, we were told they'd make us a new one and deliver it. Great!  Got a call at 845 saying our pizza was ready, said ok, you said you'd deliver it,Madison said ok, took our address and hung up. 10 minutes later we got another call from her saying we were outside the delivery zone and we had to come pick it up. I said I'm not driving there again, only said we'd take a new one cause you said you'd deliver it otherwise I'd have taken a credit!  I get it, it's 5 mins to closing time and you don't want to deliver it, but shouldn't have said you would, now refuse to do so. The best part was the girl who said they'd deliver it, Rosie I think, then said she didn't say that!!!!!  I would never have agreed to come back out to get it, would have taken a credit. Very disappointed cause this is one of the best gluten free pizzas out there but I hate that kind of nonsense, do not lie to me.  After a lot of arguing They finally agreed to deliver the pizza and gave us free dessert


I would have eaten the cheese pizza and taken the credit and let it go but treating customers poorly gets 2 stars

They are the nicest people I've EVER dealt with when ordering takeout. A lot of restaurant employees seem annoyed when you ask questions but not at LaBella's. They welcome the questions and don't rush you at all. Tonight they were running a little behind because they are so busy but when I called to get an ETA, the man who had initially taken my order immediately apologized saying the order just left and that he realized it had been a long wait so he added extra chicken/broccoli fettuccine Alfredo to the order. When it arrived, it was another order all together in a separate container so not just ""extra"". There were also extra garlic knots and zeppolis. I had never ordered zeppolis before but we were pleasantly surprised at how amazing they were. We've always been huge fans of them and their food but words can't describe how much I love this place! If you're questioning whether you should try them or not, don't. You won't be disappointed and if you are, for God knows what reason, they are quick to apologize and make it right.
