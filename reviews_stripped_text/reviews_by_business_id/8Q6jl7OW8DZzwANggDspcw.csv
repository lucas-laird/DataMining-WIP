The bartenders are so friendly and make the most amazing drinks; we especially loved the bartender KC. We had the Twinkie drink and it is our new obsession, you must try this! The food is delicious; we had salads, appetizers and dinners. You should defiantly go to the Sugar Factory on your next Vegas trip for dinner and drinks.

6598,2011-05-01,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I ate here 3 times while staying at the Paris Hotel in Vegas. Twice for breakfast, once for late night dessert in the chocolate lounge.

Everything here is delightfully delicious. First time, I had the 4 cheese omelet with hasbrowns and rye toast and a big cup of coffee. Perfect and scrumptious. Dining companions had waffles with chocolate chunks and whip cream and berries on top. Delicious fun. Dessert for breakfast!

When we came for our late night dessert we sat in the chocolate lounge area which is very cool. Had a huge cupcake. Dining companions had chocolate sundae and cheesecake. And we had some wine.

The only negative i would say is that just like everywhere else in Vegas, the hostesses/servers dress like prostitutes. The skin tight stretchy dresses/skirts that barely cover their private parts. Can i have my breakfast without looking at your hooha s'il vous plaît? This town is definitely a man's town.

I was looking forward to this place but left with an icky feeling in my belly. 
Service was OK..
Water was pricey. 
Cherry tootsie pop cocktail, if it were a little smoother I probably would've enjoyed it. 

Menu overall wasn't anything impressive. Mac n cheese burger - Ate half as it was reeeeeallll stodgy with not a lot else going on flavour-wise. 
Classic burger - really disappointing pattie. Chicken fingers - mediocre.

We had reservations paired with a show. Read the reviews. Expected the fancy drinks. Getting to the entrance is a nightmare due to the remodeling. No signage of where the entrance is. After getting seated, then they tell us no fancy drinks. New owners. The menu choices associated with the show was limited and not that fancy. chicken and waffles for an entree? We couldn't pay the difference to order something else off menu. So, we ordered caesar salad and french onion soup for appetizer. The entree was chicken and waffles and baked rigatoni. The salad was wilted and the soup was sweet. the baked rigatoni was disgusting and the waffles was bleh.

Came here cause I originally wanted a crepe. I asked to see the crepe menu and I was told only breakfast items were served at that time. Waitress wasn't helpful neither fast.

We had the banana grilled toast. Grrrr banana bread was so dry and tasteless, topped with caramelized bananas that were hard to eat and a tiny bit of berries as the side. My friend order an extra side of sausage links awwww how cute 6 bucks just for 3 small sausage links that were also gross.

Seating outside would be nice when its not peak season in Vegas otherwise you seat there and hear all the noise and crowds walking by, not enjoyable.

If you want to pay for atmosphere rather than the food then this is the place for you. Overall, everything about this place is trendy and chic except for the staff's attitude which is a bit too casual. The bus boy came over to place set some glasses and he actually told us, ""these are glasses."" Thank you. 

Breakfast is not served after eleven. The crepes listed on the menu sounded delicious but I had to turn to the lunch menu. Sandwiches & salads and some hamburgers. The patty melt was eatable but the bread to meat ratio was the size of a quarter sitting on a saucer. There were extras added onto it that were not listed in the menu's description. 

I did not delight in the desserts or specialty drinks as they were as much as a meal themselves, however, I think this is where you should spend your money if you decided to walk into this place.",k0KI7QgLFzUsZe1iZBgBOQ,1,0,1,F9uzkzLrpyjke2ZEGqt7mA
66342,2014-10-12,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"After a 4-star worthy dinner at a restaurant in the Bellagio hotel, my party of four was looking forward to a delicious dessert and some prime people watching across the street at the Sugar Factory, located in the Paris hotel. We asked the hostess how long we'd have to wait for a table on the large patio overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and musical fountains of the Bellagio. We were told 30 minutes, provided a cell phone number, and proceeded to explore Paris until our name was called. Within 10 minutes we were called, headed back to the restaurant, and taken to a great table with fantastic people-watching potential. When I asked if we could have dessert menus, we were told the patio was for dinner dining only. When we explained that we were not asked or told that when we submitted our name, the lead hostess was summoned and we were informed that, since it was their mistake for not informing us, we would be granted an exception and be allowed to stay at the table. We promised to order lots of dessert! 

Unfortunately, that was when it all went downhill. The staff handled our seating situation appropriately, but the dessert we ordered fell woefully short of our expectations for, what appeared to be, the best place in town for a late-night sugar fix. Indeed, the dessert was so bad, we each took a couple of bites and couldn't go further. 

Two in our party ordered coffee/decaf, which  impressively arrived with warmed half-and-half on the side. This classy touch was not indicative of good things to come. The other two in our party ordered cocktails and they enjoyed them. Much of the cocktail menu was comprised of huge sugar-laden drinks, which, although not for our taste, seemed appropriately Vegas and well-suited for a restaurant claiming to showcase sugar. 

We thought it would be fun to share one outrageous dessert rather than order four smaller ones and the dark chocolate fondue fit the bill. It came with brownie bites, cake pops, strawberries, bananas, rice crispy treats, two kinds of cookies, and (oddly), pretzel bread bites for dipping. The platter arrived in a most unappetizing display. The chocolate was not particularly high quality and was not served in a fondue pot or other warming bowl.  The fondue forks provided were actually short wooden skewers.  Whipped cream was not provided as one would expect with dessert fondue. Moreover, the rice crispy treats and pretzel bread was stale, the brownies and cookies were cloyingly sweet, but otherwise tasteless, and the cake bites looked horrible and tasted worse: like raw sugar dough balls covered in smashed sprinkles. The entire platter looked and tasted like leftovers or day-old scrapes that never sold (and clearly should have been discarded). We pondered whether we were being singled out for ""taking"" a prime table with a dessert-only order, but the consistently bad taste of every item on the plate and the hideous way in which the food on the platter was displayed led us to conclude that the Sugar Factory likely (shockingly!) cannot deliver high-quality dessert items.  We got the impression this is one of the places in a great location with a super view that feels it can skimp on quality and charge a lot for inferior food just because it can. We paid nearly 30 dollars for a plate of dessert that left a bad taste in our mouthes.  

Fortunately the pink-faced street performers and endless Vegas tourists provided just enough distraction to sweeten an otherwise disappointing experience. There's absolutely no way to sugar coat it: The Sugar Factory is not the place to go for a high-quality dessert.",bEekquwMTpauTMnADNc6NQ,0,0,1,MHOH14pnUJ1F1nebJio5Tg

89526,2014-01-07,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I used to like this place, and now I HATE this place! I would rather be starved instead of going back!

I came here a year ago and the experience was good. This year I came again and it's totally worse than last year. The service was lacking. First of all, we made a reservation through Open Table, and we were very sure it's made because at first, the hostess was able to see it and be able to say my husband's name correctly. So after we got seated down, we notice that the points weren't added to our open table account yet, so my husband asked the hostess about it to see if they have checked us in. But then at that point the hostess said he didn't make any reservation, I guess they deleted it after we got seated, as we couldn't even see the record on our open table account either. The record was there before we got seated, and then disappeared after we were seated. So we didn't get to have out points on open table and it's definitely their fault, not ours.
At the end, when we got our check, we forgot to show them the Total Reward card to get the 10% discount, and my credit card has been swiped but I haven't signed yet. So we asked if they can redo the bill for us. They said no because the credit card has been swiped. I got too upset that i didn't argue with them and just paid them and decided not going back. I know that it's not final as long as I don't sign the receipt, they could have voided the one that I haven't signed, and redo the bill with my total reward discount. I know other restaurants would do that as that happened to me in the past. They just needed to void the charge on my card especially I haven't signed. I still give them 15% tip at the end though I am totally dissatisfied with their laziness and wrong doing (including messing up our open table reservation). They don't deserve tip but I gave 15% anyway, as this is the last time they would see me setting foot at this particular restaurant.

I want to note that the service at the one in Town Square is way way way better than this one in Paris Hotel. The Town Square doesn't offer Total Reward discount (of course as it's not in the casino) but their price is lower than the one in paris hotel. Unless you really really really want to look at Bellagio Fountain while eating, otherwise, there is no point to eat at this one at Paris Hotel. You don't really see much of the Bellagio Fountain anyway if you are not sitting at the outside patio.

I am not going back to this Sugar Factory in Paris Hotel ever again. I think it's either the employees lacking training, or the management of this particular one is not doing their job well in training their staff, or maybe the management didn't treat the employees well making them staff not doing their job well. 

If you want to ask me about the food, the food is better at the one in Town Square as well. I always like their red velvet sundae but this time they have changed it to something that tasted so nasty in SF Paris Hotel. While the red velvet sundae at the one in Town Square is still good. I visited both within the same week, so the comparison is a fair one. And yes, I had red velvet sundae twice within the same week but at different location. The one in Town Square is much better than the one in paris hotel!!!!!! At the one in Town Square, the server and hostess are way better, they didn't mess up our open table reservation, greeted us nicely, always have smiley face. The staff (including the management, not just the staff on the floor) at SF Sugar Factory requires a lot of improvement.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,2,1,1,QfurDGAI4S4doTke0RoZgg
107559,2013-10-30,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Sugar Factory was the ""official"" dinner place for our bachelorette party- and a good choice as well. 

I loved the candy shop - it felt like a Japanese version of a toy store - but sweet and overtly sexual, even if there weren't toys of that kind, there definitely had that vibe, if you looked close enough. 

The restaurant itself...the first 17 pages (yes, 17) were drinks, and the remaining couple were food stuffs. I split a club sandwich and salad with Mrs. Jacobovitz, while we drank and then nursed and then drank more of our goblets. Because that's seriously what they were - and for me, a woman who loves sweet things and should've prepared better given the name, the drink itself was too sweet. 

The food was good for as expensive it was, and it was definitely a place I would return to (and did, only to the bar). Our server might have been slightly overwhelmed with the amount of cleavage and masks (yes masks), but he was an absolute wonder and always had a great smile on his face.",vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg,3,1,4,6s3rBT-MxxHNwz0RxcRN7A

Started out on a warm, sunny Vegas Tuesday around 3 pm.  We had been walking around for awhile and decided that some coffee on an outdoor patio would hit the spot.  We came upon the Sugar Factory, saw they had coffee, open tables, and a patio...perfect (or so we thought).  We go to the hostess station to get a table.  They tell us it will be a 10-15 minute wait...that's weird considering there are numerous open tables but whatever.  So we wait and eventually they buzz us and take us to a table outside.  The waitress comes up and asks for a drink order and we ask for water while we decide.  Well they don't have just regular tap water but they do have $6.95 bottled water...annoying but again whatever.  So we pass on the water and just get the coffee.  A minute later our waitress is back telling us that if we only want drinks then we have to sit at the bar.  REALLY??  So we said sure no problem then walked right out the front door and I can guarantee we will never be back.  I could have understood if it were lunch or dinner rush or even a weekend when you wouldn't want a table used just for drinks when you could have people dropping way more cash for a whole meal.  But it was a half full patio at an off hour on a weekday...they should have been fellating us for bringing our business there.  Instead they are busy enforcing arbitrary rules.

I ordered their signature burger made with a white chocolate bun - amazingly yummie, the sweetness of the bun complemented the burger perfectly.  The second time I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza, which was so big I only ate half of it.  I also had 2 goblet drinks which were just as good as the food.  Both visits were made during late night hours and the ambience of the restaurant is like a nightclub.  They have an in-house DJ who pumps out really good music although the noise level can make it hard to have a nice conversation.  During the night, the place is very dark - dim lights and candles provide the only light. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that they're pricey.  The goblet drinks I ordered cost $36 each - on one occasion my drink alone was more than my friend's entire dinner.  Also, they do not serve tap water - you have to buy it and I've heard they charge $3-5/person if you want water.

We got the Banana Split Waffles and each got a glass of wine. I'm not going to complain about the price because I live in Vegas and know that when you're on the strip... you should expect higher price. Overall I would say that I liked the Banana Split Waffles. There was a lot of chocolate with waffles though. If I ever decide to go back, I will ask for no chocolate syrup with waffles. Bananas were caramelized and there strawberries were sweet. The dessert went perfect with our wine. 

I was probably there for about 45 mins to 1 hour. I saw my waiter about twice I would say. The service was ok overall. They don't really give you much attention unless you call for them. 

The environment was really nice. We sat near the outside area. You can see the Bellagio show across the street. Since we went around midnight in January, the weather was perfect. I would say I had an overall great experience or at least that's how I remember it (the alcohol helped! :D).

382603,2013-03-17,5,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I completely take back my original 5 star review and apologize to anyone who wound up eating here recently due to it..

As you can see from my previous review I really loved this place. We come to Vegas probably every two months at least and have made it a point to eat here at least half the trips and always recommend it to friends who ask for places to try. 

So fast forward to this weekend- we haven't been to Vegas since this summer due to a lot going on in our lives so felt a little ""out of the loop"" on some new stuff happening on the strip in between this time. I guess one thing we missed was this place getting new owners and chefs. I happened to browse yelp before we headed here for breakfast today and noticed how terrible the recent reviews were but shrugged it off because I had been here so many times I thought I knew what to expect.... How wrong I was!

I really hope the new owners read and take all this recent negative feedback seriously- I cannot believe how much they are shunning and insulting their fans! First after being seated we were told about the new water policy ($2/person for basically tap water in a bottle- apparently to ""save the environment and bla bla"" but it screams desperate for as much money as they can take from customers and cheap). 

That kinda pissed off my boyfriend but we went whatever and tried to order- boyfriend asks if he can order the $20 steak and eggs but substitute the home fries for something else and we are told ""sorry we have a new chef and no substitutions are allowed"".... ""Even if we pay extra?"".... ""No sorry"". That was the final straw.

We told our waitress (we had already been served coffee) we would finish our coffee and go somewhere else to eat. She wasn't surprised and was pretty honest about how upset so many customers have been due to the new policies and completely understood our feelings- so the 1 star is credited to her nice service/honesty. 

I have eaten at restaurants that don't offer substitutions but they are either extremely cheap or high end with quality ingredients and creative menu/dishes the chefs don't want the ingredients compromised on. The fact this place- which is basically a Cheesecake Factory with more flare-- has the nerve to act pretentious like their Denny's quality over priced steak and eggs dish is too good to have a substituted side dish is ridiculous and insulting to the customer who wants something healthier with their entree. 

So never again and definitely won't be recommending this place anymore to anyone- which is disappointing because we really did like coming here. However, there are SO MANY food options in this area it's unnecessary to frequent if not enjoyable. We paid ($18 after tip for two coffees and our water- ha) and went to Mon Ami Gabi and the experience there was so much better,classier, accommodating.... and cheaper (a few similar things on the menu and about $5 less than Sugar Factory was asking and I guarantee better quality food)!

I took my niece that lives in Vegas here as a Christmas present during our recent visit. I told her to pick out any dessert she wanted and, luckily for me, she chose the fondue and a malt shake, perfect for splitting :)

It's dessert, not something you can easily mess up, so it was good. Lots of goodies with the fondue -- gummi bears (which I thought would taste nasty dipped in chocolate but was surprisingly good), brownies, some type of fruit bread that was also delicious covered in chocolate, strawberries, banananas, marshmallows...it was good. The chocolate malt was also delicious, but turns out that I can't keep up with a 9 year old and her chocolate eating habits.

My friend and I were satisfied with the burger. We expected more from the ""Signature"" burger, but I guess it is what it is.  

The Belgian Waffles were really disappointing.  For $10 a plate, I was expecting more than two small 3x3 waffles with a meager amount of chocolate syrup. The waffles were really nothing special and I believe that I could have gotten better for cheaper at Ihop. 

We finished with the Banana Split Sundae.  This dish was what saved our experience.  Heaping portions of delicious ice cream, our only gripe was that it didn't have a cherry on top!  It was amazing and there was so much ice cream that we couldn't finish it.

The candy store part is attractive and full of neat stuff-- the lip tattoos are especially unique, and they also have very cool ankle socks with photographic designs on them of cupcakes, donuts, etc. I paid $8.95 per pair for these (bought two pairs), which didn't seem that bad for the Strip. But when I got up to the ITSUGAR store at the Venetian Grand Canal shops a short while later, I saw they have the exact same socks for about $5 per pair. And ITSUGAR isn't exactly a discount shop. The staff were very cheerful and nice, but they packed up my purchases in a somewhat soiled, nondescript blue gift bag, like the kind you get at Dollar Tree. For a markup this extravagant, they should at least package your purchase nicely, like in a bag that doesn't have splotches of crusty stuff all over it. 

I wouldn't say it's a bad shop, but if you're planning to visit one upscale candy store on the Strip, I recommend you hold onto your money until you get to ITSUGAR (and no, I'm not affiliated with them in any way).

Red Velvet Pancakes.  The creamy topping is sinful.

That said, their claim to fame is that you have a front seat to the Bellagio fountains/fountain show, but this would only be meaningful if the ground underneath them were raked or they had a second floor. As it is you have lamp poles, people, street traffic and more people blocking you so you see the tips and vertical glimpses of the fountain; big deal. (we were on the patio outside!) 

It's all about what you ordered, yes? So it feels absolutely right to give a two star to our specific food, but having been there the one time and trying three dishes I do feel a little bad giving the experience a two star.

 I didn't care for the hyper too large menu (""unfocused"" -yep, thank you Susie Q for nailing this). 

Service from our waitress was a 2 also; our bus person on the other hand was a 5!  He kept her accountable when she wouldn't check in with us.

We had crepes: a dinner crepe which name I can't recall and two dessert crepes, berry and banana split. The dinner crepe was said to come with with greens as part of the dish, but it was a garnish not a featured ingredient. It was so salty it masked the subtler tastes of the many ingredients. The berry crepe- single one- was excellent but too small a serving for the price; the larger banana one was okay, but don't expect a crepe tasting treat because the more generous filling overwhelmed the single crepe. The whole single crepe thing was mystifying. If you are going to be generous with the filling, provide more than one crepe--this is the cheap part remember? It's like serving Fajitas and getting one tortilla. 

Wouldn't go there again- a $66 bill for a small not-great meal; will gamble elsewhere.

The busboy came by frequently to refill our water, at least. But it was getting upsetting that the table next to us got their pastas before my club sandwich, even though they clearly got there at least 15 min after we did. In fact, at least 2 other tables arrived after us got their food before us. 

We flagged down a waiter to try to find our own. This waiter took the responsibility to serve us from then on. But even after speaking with the manager later, we never found our WHAT THE HELL happened. We got our food about 50 min after sitting down. The club sandwich was not bad, but the steak was fatty and of poor quality. Very disappointing. 

We were comp'd a free dessert for the lack of service. But still, for a $50 (2 entrees, no drinks or appetizers) check, that was some shit service followed by insincere apology from management. Maybe we should have order the $50 monster dessert for our comp'd dessert!

We watched at least 7 Bellagio water shows from the restaurant. It's kinda neat to be able to see that. But I wanted to be across the street with unobstructed view! Stupid Sugar Factory took too much of my time! 

P.S. The Sugar Factory ice cream parlor right next door is NOT 24 hours. We learned it the hard way. And they're the ones with reasonable service and a variety of ice cream and cookies to create your own ice cream sandwich.",IAiR-OONIT9qClLHX4f7Gg,1,0,1,jwPA8XLdwR47UYJgH2n6_g

The Sugar Factory in the Paris hotel was the best we found.  Yes, we still paid nearly $20 for each entrée, but they were worth it.  At the Flamingo, we had to pay the same amount just for bacon & eggs.

The Sugar Factory American Brasserie & Bar is supposed to look like a French café, naturally.  There is seating that opens right out onto the strip, but we had to sit at an inner table.  My girlfriend and I split the eggs benedict and chicken and waffles.

The eggs benedict came with asparagus on top and a rich but not overwhelming Hollandaise sauce.  Instead of an English muffin, the eggs came with creamy scalloped potatoes on the bottom.  The waffles were two large Belgium waffles.  The chicken was crispy, honey flavored.  I've actually never had waffle house chicken and waffles, but I already know I prefer the French twist.

YUM!  Thanks Valerie!  because it was so worth it for the fried Mac and Cheese pops!  So, so, so good!  mac and cheese much like Kraft, breaded nicely (not sloppily like a mozzarella stick would be) then either deep fried or baked.  Though it says fried, they seem baked.

We also got the Philly Cheese Steak, which was quite good.  The bread was a little hard for me.  It is served on a long chibatta type bread, so it's just enough for one person, but the side serving of fries is generous.

Service was amazing.  She was pleasant, and seemed to enjoy her job.  No one was moping about looking miserable, and the clientele wasn't loud or obnoxious.

Beautiful decor.  Not what I expected, mostly black and red.  All the dishes sparkling and the tables clean and crisp.

1023084,2013-01-23,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"As my first review for the 2013 year I would like to start by asking, WHY have I not been to Sugar Factory during the last four in a half years that I have been living here??  That is the question of the year so far!  Or WHY has no one ever taken me...until now? 

I was fortunate enough that someone invited me to go with them to this fine establishment. Who doesn't like a place where you can peruse through an assortment of sweet treats and candy, a bar with amazing drinks and  staff, a restaurant area that serves delicious food and MORE sweet delectable desserts? Anyone? Nope, did not think so. There is something for EVERYONE in this beautiful factory. 

I really enjoyed this place. Like I said the staff was friendly. Molly the bartender is down to earth. The drinks were nothing short of gratifying and scrumptious. One of the managers suggested a drink to me that had pineapple, but I hate pineapple, so he insisted that I trust him. He showed me up big time. I could not put that drink down for a second. The flavors blended very well. I bow down to you sir. :)  

I had the french dip, which was delicious. I saved half of it for work the next day, because I wanted to savor it. The person I was with had this giant, and I mean GIANT burger that had white chocolate within its bun...what...yea. He devoured that thing. I was impressed. 

Then we had two of the dessert dishes, an ice cream castle of strawberry shortcake and shortcake bites and this TO DIE FOR chocolate crepe creation. I do not pay attention to names well, but I can describe that dangerously delicious dessert from each bite I took. 

I would say that I would most definitely be coming back. A place with great people, great service, great good, great drinks, great sweets, no doubt has my heart for sure.",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,1,2,5,mtQkLsh41e1OY0CdSSbL7w

20 minute wait for over-priced mediocre food.

I ordered their steak sandwich medium rare and it was really tough to eat. The steak came out more rare (at least it wasn't over cooked) and was so chewy the whole slab came out of the sandwich. I had to use a fork and knife to eat this. To top it off, the steak had NO flavor. I guess at least it wasn't over salted? More like no salt at all lol. Oh, and I paid $20 for this almost inedible sandwich, but at least most of the fries were good.  Some were definitely soggy :/

Last night I went there for the first time ever and it will absolutely be the last time I go there. A friend of mine had complained about a food item he ordered which the menu clearly states is TWO veggie patties. Not only did it get served incorrectly, but then on top of it when my friend had vocalized his concern to our waiter, he then proceeded to get the manager. Now I have been a manager for a company for four + years, and I have to say the way this manager not only approached our table (which he had his hand on our empty chair and was slouching) and then instead of introducing himself and asking how our meal was he said ""Whats wrong with your food?"" REALLY? I honestly was dumb founded. After a few minutes of his bantering with my friend (who granted yes he was getting upset) But on top of it the manager said they had been changing their menus and and the menu did state that it came with TWO patties, but then when we asked to have what the menu stated he claimed his chef ""would not allow that,"" which makes NO sense. Then he proceeds to tell my friend that sarcasm will get him nowhere.... I'm sorry, my friend was not being sarcastic, I then put my opinion on the table and reexplained what my friend had said he then stated all he could offer was 50% off the meal. Okay, so let me get this right... instead of just letting the two people who want an extra veggie patty like your menu clearly states (which is probably $2) you then instead say you will give them 50% off their meal? Makes no sense, they just want what they ordered. Then not only that, but religiously through our entire meal, the manager was gossiping to all the other waiters and waitress' who kept staring at us. Then our waiter also went to another waitress and started gossiping. This was BY FAR thee worst experiences I've ever had- being in management I am IMMENSELY disgusted by this managers behavior and I will do everything in my power to make sure it is known. All this manager had to do was approach our table and say, ""I'm sorry, I heard you had inquiry about your menu choice, I've very sorry for the inconvenience, but we are in the middle of changing our menu, and I am aware it does say two patties, but at this time I cannot give you two patties, however we can make you a different meal if you like or you can pay the extra for another patty, and furthermore I am very sorry for the inconvenience.""

After walking by a couple of times, and every time commenting on how amazing the food smelled (from the sidewalk on The Strip), we opted for dinner one night.  The hostess greeted us promptly and though there was a bit of a wait, we went into the candy shop.  Once seated, I asked if the large panoramic window could be opened since there weren't patio tables large enough for four.  Once the couple seated by the window on the outside left, the staff promptly opened the window for us.  Our server was extremely funny and fun.... the first time he came by.  After that, he got incredibly condescending and sarcastic in his ""jokes"".  We asked about using the Groupon (as it said one Groupon per table, but asked if since each couple was paying separately if we could each use one).  It went downhill from there.  It was 15 minutes before the server came back with our drinks.  Our food took another fairly substantial amount of time to arrive.  

The server checked back once during the meal.  At the end, he brought us our bill, asked for the Groupon code and rather than writing it down to apply it to the bill, he took our phones with him (hope he enjoyed the pictures on there...!)  When the final bill was returned, he had conveniently handwritten gratuity amounts on the bottom (for a party of four total).... Of course beginning at 25%.  I don't want to start the ""don't be an @$$hole, tip your server"" debate, I don't... but they work for their tip. I've worked in the service industry before and get how it works.  But what it comes down to is that you earn your tip. Period. If you're amazing (or even decent), we will tip you well.. if you suck and do a crap job, guess what.... we're not Democrat!

The food WAS delicious, my husband and I shared the Cuban and the French Dip sandwiches, both REALLY good.  The drinks were also fun and delicious, between the four of us, we had the (I can't remember the name of ours) spicy cucumber margarita and the regular cucumber margarita (both refreshing and really interesting).. and the Jolly Rancher Martini and Blow Pop Martini.  

The prices were reasonable and on par with the rest of the casual dining on The Strip, we weren't shocked or upset by that one bit.

Lets be honest here people. It's Vegas. And the only thing I really have the ability to comment on is their drinks. Our group's drinks of choice were the goblets. We had four. Four of which I can't remember their names, but they were something along the lines of Fruit Punch, White Gummie Bear, Sweet Tea, and the Lollipop one (which I nicknamed the Ravetastic Goblet of Fire). Typically they are $36 each, but with the 'buy one get one free deal' how could you just have one?! All of them were equally delicious and packed with alcohol. Besides the libations we enjoyed a few of their appetizers. (Mac & Cheese Balls, Spinach Artichoke Dip). Although they were both delicious I would of preferred bigger portions. Something like $10 for 3 small Mac & Cheese Balls, YIKES. Then again it is Vegas.

I highly recommend this place. At least for Happy Hour.....",DUFvzoP60ZCWz7n54T7fIg,0,0,3,Dzpd8uZSCRfkjPN18a5WWw

1274368,2012-09-23,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"If you take away the sweet desserts and confections, this restaurant is sub-par, broken-down version of Cheesecake Factory.  The atmosphere is similar to what you would find with its competitors (Cheesecake Factory and Grand Lux).  It's a casual restaurant with flashy decor that makes you feel that you are at a slightly more luxurious dining establishment.  Other than this, the menu is less to be desired.

(Note that If you sit on the patio, you face the Bellagio fountains.  Note that I said ""face"" versus having a view of.  The problem with is that the view is blocked by trees, a bus stop, etc.)

As for the menu, we ordered a number of things to share for the table.  I always feel like it's the best way to sample a restaurant's menu.  We had the:

-  Fried Macaroni Cheese Pops:  Probably the best thing I had that night.  It's accompanied by a marinara sauce that is pretty legit.  Without the sauce, I wouldn't have been impressed.

-  Chicken Fingers:  Overcooked and lacked much flavor.  It reminded me of frozen chicken fingers you get from the grocery store.
 
-  Bruschetta:  No flavor or seasoning.  It would have been delicious had there been salt and pepper, and less olive-oil on it.

-  Grilled Mini-Burgers:  Just your typical slider... nothing special about these.  I would have rather had an In-N-Out burger.

-  Ham & Cheese Crepes:  Eh, nothing special here.  Crepe was cold and didn't have much flavor either.  It needed seasoning or a sauce at a minimum.

-  Cookie Jar Sundae:  Where were the cookies?  There was more whipped cream than ice-cream as well.  The presentation was nice but the dessert left little to satisfy/

The service was good and perhaps saved them an extra star on my overall rating.  At $10 - $15 a dish, I expected the food to taste better than what I perceived to be microwaved frozen food.  I wouldn't recommend coming here and will personally never go back myself.",qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,0,0,2,-8QtVPqlGS336nei2Nk0Dg

Place and order for two because I figure the 3 wouldn't be enough. Got a red velvet milkshake and a blowpop drink for myself.
Our order comes and I'm sadly dissapointed. Sitting in the basket were 6 triangle shaped cheese things. I bit into it and blah. No rich creamy orange goodness. It was white cheddar and very non creamy.  Apparently my boyfriend enjoyed the last time because he made the comment ""the last ones didn't have noodles in it, did it?""
Waste of money. If I would have known I would have just ordere one order, considering we had a big breakfast 3 hours before.
The milkshake was good and so was the blow pop, but I noticed they cut down on the alcohol and rim decorations as well. My drink came out 10 mins later.
They also seemed a bit pushy, my asking several times if we would like to order anything else, was this all for us. etc.. Even the manager came by to ask how everything was and commented if that was all we ordered.
Sorry, unless I read better reviews on this before my next trip to Vegas, which is soon, I think I'll pass.

Food
The food was decent, my pizza was good. However it was not $15 good. I've had $15 pizzas and this does not hold water when it comes to quality and ingredients and personal touch of the chef. The price is jacked up on food that should cost $7-$11 to starting at $9-10 up to $15-$20 or more. So I know it's Vegas and since nothing is real prices are high. Because people are there to have a good time and burn holes in their wallets. 

Service
Outside of the service from our waitress, we had a terrible experience with a rude hostess and the General manager, Earl I believe his name is, who has major difficulties with properly dealing with incidents that occur. We were called up by the not rude host who asked us for the name of our reservation and our party number. He asked 12? We corrected him only 9 or maybe we were 10 originally. We were then directed to our tables, given our menus and ordered our drinks. Good times! Then 25 or so minutes in the Rude Hostess comes and asks, ""Is this your table? Are you a party of 12?"" Of course since we were seated by a host we affirmed it was our table. She then asked us ""What name is your reservation under?"" My friend who is the bride to be told her the name. Then she walked away. First of all, this is not how you handle a situation. She obviously did not know what was going on. Maybe the host who sat us, gave us this other party's table wrongly. So she has to deal with that among her fellow co-workers, not attack us like we just walked ourselves in, stole a table and were served without prior incident to her interrogation. Maybe she was trying to impress the other customers who were supposed to have the table because she couldn't admit that they had a mix up? Either way she approached it all wrong and we were very offended. 

When my the bride to be then asked for a manager and explained to him the situation. She is a J.D. mind you with a sharp mind and one of the most accurate memories of anyone I know, and she repeated verbatim what this Rude Hostess said. The manager replied saying he was sorry and that he would go talk to the hostess to see what happened. Which of course made my friend ask if he didn't think that this incident was of any concern or happened. He repeated that he was going to ask the hostess and see what happened. This is not how you communicate to resolve problems. Sure there are those customers that come in and lie and make up things. He of course came back and gave her excuse that she was with the customer and just wanted to find out why we were sitting there when she thought or saw that there was a reservation for this other party. wtf?? We never questioned what she was doing, we said it was rude and disrespectful. He just apologized. My friend directly asked him how he could make our experience better since we had been mistreated. He responds ""I have already said I'm sorry four times."" Wow! this was all he had. I mean he should have comped something. Not because we want to fish for freebies, but because we don't come to a business establishment to pay and have the staff be rude to us. So he either practices this kind of rude behavior and or trains his staff to be that way, or he is just a poor manager, who has difficulty managing. 

So I gave one star for the one waitress, and 1/2 star for good decent food, but not a full star for over pricing. And another 1/2 star for service again since one host was not rude, and the other was. The rest of the stars are missing because the General Manager does not know how to deal with accountability and create a safe and fun experience for customers when things don't go smoothly.",ozcX40hANlb4QEJVTe-Drg,3,0,2,9jHhyjLtYKOa1Xwaaj7N7Q

The food comes out in weird orders - like my co-workers ice cream sundae coming out before the appetizers.

We went down for the new After Hours night before heading to Chateau. We sat at the bar and  the bartender, one for the bar patrons and the other working the well, was swamped with only 6 people at the bar. Really? The menu was limited to one page front and back. I suppose they chose the easiest items to prepare to speed up service. The prices were out of control! $11 for chicken tenders- no fries, $15 for a burger and $10 for 3 sliders-no fries. A side of fries is $4 and the 4 salads to choose from were sad to even consider at $15, on average. 

A 24 hour restaurant with no late night specials to reel people in? Instead they choose dancers and a DJ.

The food was tasteless. Four homemade chicken fingers came out in a basket. They were dusted with a flavorless flour, but good considering the technique. Id suggest they at least use panko breadcrumbs for the price. The sauces came in plastic ramekins. How f'ing cheap! 

The sliders and fries were worth all of $4 dollars. Bread, spread, ""Angus"" burger, burnt cheese, bread. No tomatoes, pickes or even lettuce. The whole thing was dry as hell! OMG why do kitchens insist on upc-harging for Angus in slider burgers? The fries didn't come on the side but in the same basket as my sliders as if that's how they always arrive.

We sat at a high table at the bar and already had an idea of what we were going to order. We sat for a while and had waitresses pass us a fair amount of times, but got no service. We actually had to stop one of them and say we needed to order something. After ordering it was maybe another 10 minutes or so before we got our drinks. I think there was only one bartender making everything, so I'll let that wait time slide a bit.

There were 3 of us, so we decided to share the drink. It was alright. They pour it out at your table so you can watch it fog up, but it wasn't too extraordinary. Taste wise, it was too sweet for my taste, but what can you expect from a place that sells candy haha. However, the price didn't quite fit the experience. $40 for a drink (it's about the size of 2.5 normal drinks mind you), but still a bit steep in my opinion.

1430970,2011-06-21,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"My friend & I ended up here on a Friday afternoon because we didn't want to wait for a table at Serendipity.

I guess service here is hit or miss.  The hostesses, looked like there were about 4 of them, welcomed us with smiles and sat us outside right away.  We sat there for a few minutes before someone came up and poured us water and handed us menus and walked away.  After about 10-15 minutes and no one coming to our table we pulled the guy aside and asked him who / where our server was.  He had to ask someone else and maybe another 5-10 minutes later she showed up.  I will say the booklike menu and sitting along the sidewalk for some people watching helped pass the waiting time... just a bit.

After she finally came to our table, the service was great.

I got a chicken club sandwich & it was enormous.  I had to break down the layers and eat them separately.  My friend who kept insisting on going to a buffet couldn't finish the burger he ordered, I think he only got through half of it.  But they were both good.

We saw another table order a Goblet and decided to get one after confirmation there was alcohol in it.  We got the lollipop one from our servers recommendation, plus I wanted the big lollipop & candy necklace that came with it.  The drink actually came out before my friend came back from the bathroom and she actually waited to pour the drink at our table til he came back to give us a little show... bc we're tourists like that.

That thing was delicious, but I felt my teeth rotting from all the sugar-y-ness.  I was pretty full from the actual food so I didn't drink that much.  My gung ho friend did his best, probably a gulp or two left.  Food / sugar coma ensued afterwards.

1520346,2011-08-22,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"So this place was a tip from a fellow friend of mine. He said that he often frequents here after a night out on the strip. So, what we did was eat here twice during our stay here. I was definitely impressed both times. I ordered a Sundae - the Cookie Jar sundae to be exact. The icecream was pretty much amazing and they make it pretty decently priced. The whipped cream was heavy and the toppings were just layered on and on. 

The best part was that my friend ordered a goblet drink to share between the both of us. I believe that we ordered the berry one - as suggestion from our waiter. This drink was pretty strong. Especially from drinking all day... This was a really good top to the night. The service is nice, though I guess it's in typically LV fashion to come by the table when we don't need the service, but we have to wait for days on end when we requested the check. 

The ambiance here is nice. There will always be a mixed crowd here. I remember being here at 3am and seeing an elderly couple, it was quite sweet.

We got really bad service and bad food.  It took a long time for our food to come out and then when it finally did, it was the wrong dish.  It took another 20 minutes for them to bring the right dish and when that came, the pasta was undercooked and hard!!!  At this point I was so livid.  The manager did come and apologize and assured me my meal would be ready within minutes and it was.  They finally got it right.

The only pleasant thing I can say is that the dessert was amazing.  It was some sort of red velvet cake and ice cream monster.  It was humongous and soooo delicious.  They also cut our bill in half so I'm happy for that.  Hence, the two stars.

Overall, the restaurant is loud with dim lighting.  It opens right up to the Sugar Factory store with candy and sweets galore!

We did see about three famous people; however, we didn't know who they were, not that famous..Eek...but they had their pictures taken. I'm not a star struck person, so do not really care about celebrities. They are just like us...normal people! =)

Anyways, what we ordered at the restaurant:
1. Spinach and artichoke dip with pita chips-The spinach and artichoke dip was a bit salty to me, but the artichoke was very refreshing and the cheese was not too overwhelming. The pita chips definitely accentuated the dip! Crispy and light without any salt added on them! 
2. BBQ chicken pizza-Thin crust pizza, which I love so much! The pizza was not even anywhere near oily! That was a plus! I loved it, but it was a bit rough to tear apart. The chicken was a bit dry to me and the sauce was not too bad. The cheese was fresh and good. 
3. Smore's crepe-The crepe was made perfectly because it was nice and crisy; however, the bad thing is that it was drenched with chocolate syrup which made the crepe soggy afterwards. They should put more graham crackers though, because then it would have balanced out. The marshmallows and the chocolate chunks were just mouth watering! Yes, we did add vanilla ice cream on top for $3 more and it was the best decision! 

The service here was terrific and that would deserve five stars!

Overall, I think that this place is ok, not the best though. The plus side is that this restaurant is always open! =)

FYI: Be careful ordering water...tastes like tap. Also, what I didn't like was that the table was made of marble and of course whatever you place on the table, everything would slip and slide. So every five to ten minutes you hear utensils falling from left to right, back to front. The floor is made with mini tiles and the chairs move so much every time you try to adjust yourself. So ladies, please be careful especially with heels, because I almost fell and twisted my ankle due to the slippery tiles. I think they need to change this because it was very scary.

I should have asked myself this question before entering how could a candy store possibly be skilled at making food? They even failed at making good dessert, which is surprising since they are called the Sugar Factory American Brasserie. SUGAR is in the name of the restaurant how could they mess up on that?

I got the frozen hot chocolate. Powdery and not exciting at all this drink is not worth ordering. The appetizers my table ordered were just ""ehh"". The spinach and artichoke dip was served with pita chips. The dip itself was sour and we only finished it because we were starving.

Service was whatever. Our waitress lagged in giving us our dessert. She came over to our table and when we asked about our dessert she had a surprised look on her face and admitted to forgetting on putting in the order. Dessert was the most disappointing part. I don't know if it's because we had to wait a long time for it but the chocolate fondue? It's just a tiny pot of melted chocolate kept warm by a little tea candle (the candle surely wasn't hot enough to keep the chocolate in a liquid state). The toppings that accompanied it were interesting... gummy bears? In the future I think i'll go to Melting Pot for my chocolate fondue.

I've been here twice now on separate Vegas trips. My first visit was for brunch about a year and a half ago but I seem to have skipped the review that time. From what I can recall, the meal was good.

I returned to the Sugar Factory for dinner on Friday night. My boyfriend and I were in Vegas for the weekend for a friend's birthday and we began our trip with a meal here. After finding out that there was a 30 minute wait for a table, we decided to keep our seats at the bar and order from there. 

The menu is quite extensive but the baked mac and cheese caught my eye. I love homemade mac and cheese (not Kraft) and I was hopeful that this dish would satisfy my carb craving. Plus, we had just driven six hours in the rain from San Diego and nothing sounds better on a rainy day than something hot from the oven. Thankfully, the dish's flavor did not disappoint. I dug into the edge of the bowl and everything was hot and delicious. But my boyfriend took a bite out of the middle and found that it was just lukewarm. He got the bartender's attention and she quickly took it back to the kitchen and brought us a fresh, piping hot mac and cheese within minutes. 

My only complaint is that $17 seems a little ridiculous for pasta and cheese, even in Vegas. We also upgraded to include two slices of garlic bread for $3 extra but I didn't think the bread was that good or very garlicky. 

We also got a couple drinks, a beer and a pink moscato, which were both $8. The moscato was perfectly sweet and bubbly!",hHgNg6u9P_Ym5wLXmnoBcw,1,2,4,dT7dXSSYwlOkFL1MWkT0eA

My boyfriend and I were tired from wondering the strip and decided to stop at this location because I have a really bad case of the sweet tooth and the name of the place was just too alluring. We opted to sit on the patio next to a heater because it had the most amazing view of the fountain show at Bellagio right across the street. 

The food: We shared the Asparagus dip, chicken&waffles, and fries. I should have gotten those big ass goblet of sweet alcohol, which combined the dreams of a sugaralcoholic, but I resisted because it was a Sunday, and I was kinda sick, but next time. The dip was a different texture than I was used to, maybe they used different cheeses? It was gooey cheesey and it had awesome asparagus chunks in there. I also liked that they had pita chips instead of chip chips. I think pita chips are healthier...because...they're baked? right? well, that's what I told myself. Chicken&Waffles were awesome. The syrup tasted like...melted ice cream...it was magical. Fries were crispy, but we took most of it to go because we were pretty darn full. 

For dessert, I just really couldn't do a sundae, so we asked the server if I could get macarons from their desert case next door. We got 4 macrons of different flavor: chocolate, vanilla, passionfruit or mango, and raspberry. Unfortunately, 3/4 of those macrons had the shell where it was empty on the instead, which is just...no bueno. One had the chewy inside and crunchy outside though, so I'm guessing that was the one that was baked most recently. Empty macaron shells make me sad. :( Maybe macarons aren't their forte.

Overall, great experience. I'm pretty sure sitting outside for that long even with a heater made me a little more sick, but it was worth it. It was a beautiful night with indulgent food. Our server was busy, but really accommodating and friendly. I thought it was funny, lolsy, and slighly tacky to have pictures of celebrities at the restaurant on the menus, but it's Vegas. I understood why they were there, but kinda off-putting for me personally to look at pictures of Kim K. and Paris Hilton while looking through a menu.

Open 24 hours.  Bye bye Denny's.  I'm going here every time I visit Vegas.  Most items are served 24 hours.  Some breakfast items are served from midnight to 11am.    

They've got everything on their menu that you could crave for any time of day.  Red velvet pancakes, Nutella crepes, Fried Mac & Cheese Pops, Chicken & Waffles, or Fondues...is your mouth watering yet?  Not to mention numerous desserts, shakes, and cocktails.  My boyfriend usually orders a club sandwich at every restaurant we visit and this place is by far has the best club sandwich he's ever had.

The menu items are very affordable!  Since this place is always crawling with celebrities I expected this place to put a dent in my wallet, but to my pleasant surprise you could buy a meal for less than a drink at a nightclub :).

The service was fast and the staff was friendly.   I'll definitely be back soon :)",lqpMr1u15v20pfanPq-qlg,2,1,5,gz0UGHqxhB5AIeRH3SatwQ

For an appetizer, my sister and I had the fried mac and cheese. It was heavenly. Unfortunately, they messed up and didn't put the order in so it came out with our entrees. ho hum.

I had the ham and brie sandwich which was delicious. It had this amazing fig spread that paired so well with the brie.

My sister had the Chicken and waffles. Good portion and very tasty as well!

We could not leave without dessert, after all the restaurant is attached to a giant candy store. So we opted for the banana sundae. The sundae was good, although it's hard to mess up a sundae, and for $15, it better be good. Nothing fabulous about it though, just good.

So it was a perfect time to let our hair down and start the fun.  We usually head to Mon Ami but wanted to try this place.  We asked for a seat out in the patio to people watch.

Drink ordered: Goblet gummy bear.  They can be shared.

Plates ordered: Salmon with asparagus-fair
And Bacon Blue Cheese Burger-fair

Our server was nice. 

Here is why they get the 1 star. The burger came with a long hair on the bun.  Our server was very apologetic and immediately returned the plate which was awesome! But never once did the manager approach us to apologize for the lack of detail and unsatisfactory presentation. I'm sure they have a front and back of the restaurant manager, someone could have acknowledged this mistake beside the waitress and honestly comped the burger. It had a hair!   While we waited for the burger we both shared the Salmon.  

Maybe a manager didn't feel the need to come out because we had a Groupon.  But really the Groupon was for $20=$40 and that meal was a lot more than that.",bihxEp-eois1T9oTLQbfuQ,0,0,1,6u2hRfysTZPYDnaKNsrWgg

After much debate on my entree choice, I settled on the bleu burger which was delicious, juicy and huge. I ate every bite, and it was well worth it. For dessert we had the cookies sundae which was good, though I wish there was more ice cream and less whip cream.

I have tried multiple things on the menu but the French onion soup and New York strip are fantastic! I also get a side of grilled asparagus and it is sooo good! Not only is the food good, but it is just an overall fun atmosphere and I think that's why we end up there a lot of times. The Passion Punch goblet is my favorite, not too sweet, more citrusy. But if you are looking to get a buzz I would recommend getting you're own. When we split one neither one of us feels buzzed at all by the end of it. 

For the most part we have had great service at the bar or a table. However, we did come across one bartender recently that was rather rude.

1774749,2012-08-21,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Ok. So I realize this place is called ""Sugar Factory"" and we're in Las Vegas, but dear god. I could smell the diabetes in that place, and the novelty was kind of lost on me. A group of us traveling together for a friends bachelorette party came here for breakfast, and I was kind of disappointed by the food. 

I ordered a cappuccino to start off, which prompted the server to ask ""just a regular cappuccino?"". I was kind of confused by her confusion, but I confirmed a wanted a REGULAR cappuccino. What I received was some kind of melted fudge sludge that resembled a cappuccino in no way whatsoever. It didn't resemble coffee of any kind actually. It was HUGE, covered in whipped cream and white chocolate, and tasted like carnation hot chocolate mix with extra sugar added. I am not one to ever send anything back to the kitchen. I just feel like too much of an ass. But this was so far off base from a cappuccino, I couldn't drink it. That and I have a profound phobia of developing diabetes, and this thing was like eating spoonfuls of white sugar. I told the waitress that I suspected that perhaps my order was mistakenly made to be a hot chocolate, because it tasted nothing like a cappuccino. She said that she didn't watch it being made, so she didn't know for sure what it was. I kindly asked her if I could replace it for a black tea. She brought me one mug of hot water and a tea bag in a package. No saucer, no spoon, no honey or milk or sugar. Later, when the bill would arrive, the server had not removed the ""cappuccino"" charge, and replaced it for tea. So I ended up with a $6 tea.  

Realizing I wouldn't be interested in any of the sweet options on the breakfast menu, I decided to order the ""Manhattan"" eggs benny (smoked salmon). At $18, the price was pretty steep. When it arrived, the hashbrowns looked bland, and the plate was generally underwhelming. Looks did not deceive. The hollandaise tasted like it came out of a package, the eggs were overcooked, and the hashbrowns were boring. 

Bad food, bad service, and hideously overpriced. My final word is don't bother. I think you'd be better served scavenging your hotel's breakfast buffet.",TGYYVbWal9mfqdg3u-6IMg,2,0,2,Y1H91RbgVYsEbftksz-bcA

It was such a nice ambiance! Our server, Jennifer was really friendly and knew exactly what the groupon was.

Both pastas were just okay - good portion sizes, and I found my pasta pretty salty and spicy (which wasn't described in the menu). We shared a side of garlic bread and my boyfriend had a house margarita - also just okay. We were thinking that we would be just a little bit over $50 with our total bill, however with gratuity, taxes and the CNF fee we ended up paying $23 out of pocket.

It was extremely busy Friday night around 11pm.  I hadn't made a reservation because I wasn't sure when the rest of our party were going to be available to meet up for dessert.  However, we were seated right away.  A WARNING: On Friday and Saturday nights they play super loud DJ music!!!  It was way too loud!!!  We had to scream to be able to talk to and hear each other!  I really don't see the point of the super loud music because this is not a club!  People come here to eat dinner and dessert!

I came here on the recommendation of a couple friends who told me about their amazing desserts.  I think this place is a bit hyped up and the dessert was good but I've had better.  Also a bit pricey.  The sundaes which are 3-4 scoops of ice cream are around $16.  Alcoholic drinks cost the same.  They also have super huge 30 oz drinks which are like $30 something.  We ordered the Cookie Dough Sundae and the Dulce Delicious (Dulce De Leche) Sundae.  

I also came for breakfast around 7am on a Saturday and had a reservation since I didn't know how busy it would be.  It was not busy at all.  I came specifically because I wanted to try their chocolate stuffed French Toast which I had seen when checking out their menu online.  Their lunch and dinner selections seemed average and not enticing.

Anyways, the chocolate stuffed French Toast was a cinnamon roll cooked like French Toast which chocolate on the top and on the side but not stuffed inside.  It was decent.  Like eating a nice little cake for breakfast.  However, the white chocolate raspberry French Toast at THE Cafe at THE Hotel at Mandalay Bay is far superior.  My husband got and egg, sausage, and potato plate which was just average in my opinion.  The one he got at THE Cafe was again, superior.",yQnXysBD7xTmElBuZXydEg,0,0,3,j1Zs-j874mtFZ8Ej7T5t8A

After we were done they came and cleared all of our plates and refilled our drinks. That surprised me because normally restaurants just drops the check and tries to get people in and out.

This is a fun restaurant for a group to dine before going out. There is inside and outside seating.

We ordered dishes to share family style so everyone could try a little of everything.  

We ordered 3 goblets to share ($36 each) and a few entrees with sides.  The goblets were overly sweet so I would say skip out on them unless you really want to experience a drink fogging up at the table.  For appetizers we ordered the buffalo chicken croquettes, mini burgers, and the fried mac and cheese.  Everything was great!  For dinner we ordered the chicken, salmon, New York steak, the tomato basil pizza, and the bbq chicken.  The chicken was a little dry but everything else was good especially the bbq chicken pizza.

We got there around 3pm for a late lunch and didn't have to wait. Our server was really great and offered a lot of good suggestions, some of which we decided to try.

Upon her recommendation I ordered the turkey and brie crepe since it seemed like something you don't see on an everyday menu. It looks small when you get it, but it was very rich and filling and I didn't even finish it even though I was sooooo hungry. The arugula salad they put on the top balances the richness of the cheese out nice, so overall I thought it was a very simple, yet sophisticated dish. My friend had ordered the grilled chicken and spinach crepe and it was tasty too. 

Again, on our waitresses recommendation, we decided to share the vanilla creme brulee and raspberry crepe for dessert. I wasn't too blown away by this dessert and felt it sounded better on paper than it did on my palette. The raspberry sorbet I felt was the best part, but the vanilla creme in the crepe wasn't to my liking. 

I also ordered the Sugar Factory Cappuccino, which is made with white chocolate, and it was huuuugggee! It was sooo delicious though and I was sad I was so full I couldn't finish it. I would come back just for this.

Overall, I think they have an amazing selection of desserts, it was just so hard to decide. I would definitely want to come back just to try some of the other things on the menu.

They seated us inside even though we specifically asked for the patio. We politely told the hostess & they quickly moved us outside. However, they're seemed to be some major drama/miscommunication at the hostess stand. I had the chicken and waffles & it wasn't good. The chicken was chewy & the waffle was just ok.

2063328,2012-08-06,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,Excellent Food over all. Had Southern Benedict for breakfast one day was very much different. Was eggs over fries over biscuit covered in country gravy. Also a side waffle which was just the right size to accompany the meal. The Waffle was to write home about very much one of the best ever. Second time coming here on trip had the Steak and frites those fries are really top notch. The steak I asked to be done medium was closer to rare but was a really good steak so I was happy. Also had Shrimp cocktail which was the freshest shrimp I have had especially surprising since we were in the middle of the desert. My friend had the chicken alfredo   which I tasted and was really good for such a basic dish. The only down mark on this place is the service I came here on several occasion in past trips to Vegas and always the same issue. This time I sat at the bar for breakfast and the bar tender was more concerned talking about her love life then helping me place my order. The bus boy was the most helpful think he felt guilty about the poor service. The second meal was much the same they tried to seat up in front area where people walk through even though the main part of the restaurant was near empty (we got moved). Then the server questioned our orders and seem like he was in a hurry to move us out mind you this is a 24 hour restaurant that never closes. Overall it sucks because the food here is always on point and worth the trouble. Maybe that is why the shoddy service since people will come back for the food anyways.

For desert, I got the Creme Brulee crepe, which was our waiters recommendation.  He said it was the most popular.  I was unimpressed, it smelled funny and the taste wasn't anything special.

Out waiter was a little spacey and took 20 minutes to get change for a 100 dollar bill for the table next to me, which prevented me from ordering anything once I was seated.

Came here for brunch on a Friday afternoon in January.
We were seated very quickly.

I ordered the southwestern omelet came with toast and country potatoes.
I was dieing of hunger and hoping the omelet would be fulfilling.

When I got my food i was amazed at the huge ass omelet (fluffy and thick) with the perfect amount of bell peppers and cheese.  I quickly added a bucket full of Tabasco to my ketchup cup and dove in. So freaking good I think i just passed out for 5 mins. 
After I came back to life I quickly tried the country potatoes (and I'm not a potato girl, I don't really like french fries) but these were really good. Crispy and warm on the inside.  I inhaled the whole plate in 20 minutes flat - and I tend to never completely finish my food.

My friend got french fries with her sandwich and those were outta this world CRISPY till the last one.  No soggy sloppy mess here; crunch crunch all the way through.

This place also has some pretty cool drinks that are served in these huge goblets with clouds of something coming out of it (like a science experiment). Their cool to look at, but didn't get a chance to try them!!  

Atmosphere is really casual and cool!!

On the upside;
-food is great! You almost can't go wrong with a menu like there's-from pasta to chicken and waffles!
-service has been great on both occasions that I've been. The hostess staff is some of the friendliest 
-great and convenient location, I love that you can browse the candy store while you are waiting to be seated
-it's open 24/7!!!!

On the downside;
-their full menu isn't available 24/7 which can be a bit disappointing if you want the waffles for dinner  

Overall do recommend. They have some pretty crazy drinks you can't find anywhere else and it's awesome to finish your dinner and dessert(dessert here is a must!) and be able to browse the candy store and take some to go.

The outside seating at the Paris was almost a two hour wait, so we tripped around to see what else was available and walked up the strip to the Sugar Factory. Figured on a wait - had none for a window seat (no glass, just a straight shot view to the Bellagio fountains and all of the people that walk by on the strip!). At least five people tended to our culinary needs (including a truly handsome young man who delivered the birthday dessert to our 17 year old daughter!). We were allowed to taste four different wines before settling on a couple of delicious northern California flavors. 

The atmosphere there is very, well, Sugary. Too much volume in the overhead music while trying to eat, overbearing at times, a lot of chocolate in everything, much attention to detail and good food. Not the best Angus steak I've had - but a good portion and cooked to order the first time. The Mediterranean chicken pasta was very tasty.

As you see, I'm a Las Vegas local and usually going to the Vegas strip isn't my favorite thing to do because it's always busy, loud and so touristy. The people that work on the las vegas strip are always obnoxious and rude because they think everyone are tourists. Why come eat on the strip and pay high prices for mediocre food when I can go some place local where it's cheaper and we will be treated better. But like I said we come here only on special occasions and for out of towner friends. 

Anyway, we ordered a New York steak thinking that ""how could you go wrong with steak?"" The steak came out rubbery, over bloody and not cooked long enough, but the sauce was not bad. 

Besides that... Not only the food was bad, (our other friend had to return her salad because it was so plain) the service was bad, our drinks never refilled and the waitress was non existent.

To finish off dinner, I enjoyed several libations including the rootbeer float with rootbeer gummy bears & a large goblet of passion fruit liquor with slices of liquor infused oranges. Finally, I sampled desserts ranging from a chocolate and peanut butter milkshake to the radiated crepe with raspberry flavored gelato.

She gave us a few suggestions and I finally decided on the turkey pot pie and my bf had the chicken and waffles. The pot pie was really good and nice and boiling hot but the chicken and waffles with the bourbon syrup was amazing. Me and my bf were happy with are choices but I was sad that they didn't have that syrup bottled and for sale because I would of bought a couple bottles. The waitress bought me a birthday shot.

1st star off: Unatentive ""Pretty Princess"" Waitress ( other reviewers seemed to have problems with the staff ), the ""busboy"" had a better attitude and was 10 times more attentive than her. 

2nd star off: Do yourself a favor and save your money and don't order any of their ""signature"" 30+ dollars drink ( the daiquiries that they sell on every corner of any hotels are tastier and stronger ) We order the Passion Something & the Blue Something with gummy sharks in it... Such big disappointments !

And now The Worst Food Experience In Vegas: 

3rd star off: We were 5 of us (4 adults & a 3 years old) SURPRISE ! A place called The Sugar Factory does not have a Children's menu! Ok, order the  Chicken Fingers from the appetizer menu $11. Oh... they don't come with French Fries that's an extra $5 

4th star off: The rest: bland food, cold food and just extremely bad quality food. 

The Ribeye was cooked properly but lack any seasonings ( no salt or pepper) the golden Yukon mashed potatoes could have come from an Idaho brand instant powder mashed potatoes packets and was just extremely cold.

A $22 Alfredo Pasta with Chicken that a Chillis wouldn't even dare to serve you. Bland and soggy pasta, the chicken under cooked and still seemed to be frozen inside.

$17 Pasta Carbonara that tasted only of heavy cream and nothing else ( barely you could taste the bacon on it ) 

The $22 Chicken and Waffles...  The $9.95 one from IHOP taste like one that Michael Mina or Joel Robuchon would make compare to that piece of garbage!

2482922,2015-01-12,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I feel like I have to disclose when I use a groupon in my reviews and this is one of those times. I didn't mention ahead of ordering that I had one (sometimes I think the service is dependent on whether I'm using one or not) so everything I experienced is based on a standard visit. 

The waiter came over and asked if we were ready for drinks, I knew I wanted a mimosa but the bf wasn't sure what beer he wanted so he asked for an extra minute. Even though the bf didn't know what drink he wanted the server proceeded to ask if we knew what we wanted to eat then... Before ordering drinks? If we haven't figured out our drink what makes anyone think we would have decided on food? I did order the chips and dip app and it was delish!!! 

We waited around for probably 15 minutes before he came back to ask for our food order so we ordered that and the beer. A Caesar salad with chicken, an Asian chicken salad and a cup of onion soup. Another 15 minutes passes before we get the beer, meanwhile the table next to us already has their food. Whatevs we thought. 

When the food arrived I got my soup and salad at the time and although that is far from ideal, we made it work. The Caesar had absolutely zero flavor to the dressing while the asian chicken salad and soup were good. The service was seriously lacking though and that's probably my biggest complaint!!

The server never said thank you or your welcome anytime we engaged with him. Lunch ended up taking an hour and a half even though they weren't busy and our plates weren't bussed once we were done. Also the beer wasn't stated as being a bottled beer which would've been nice to know for $10! When we (finally) received our check the tip was circled with thank you written on it... Very odd. We then stated we had a groupon so he came over and scribbled off the thank you and wrote my groupon info on the receipt... Again very odd. 

The lunch ended up being $90 for two. The food was meh but the setting was pretty as the patio has a great view of the vegas people on the street, hence the three stars. I REALLY want to give this place two stars so that's it's saving grace. $90 for two salads, two drinks and an app is pretty steep so I say skip the groupon, skip the wasted meal and find somewhere much more worthy of your hard earned money and time.",Jvpe59-dYiWx_jwPlI_TCg,3,1,3,iRkmXQ7m3M260j3uIx2rZw

Our drinks were well attended to and the service was pretty quick, but then again, we were there at noon on a Monday and there were maybe 10 other tables to attend to. 

I liked the atmosphere. Dark wood, dark walls, white marblesque tables. The adjacent candy store was neat but skippable. 

BF got a Cuban that came on a french roll, I think and was loaded with peppers. I wasn't a fan but he liked it. 

People seemed to complain a lot about the service; that wasn't the issue here. This was a very basic, TGIF/Applebee's kind of dining experience. Everything tasted processed and prepackaged. For reference, the tortilla soup was a smooth bisque with cubes of colorless ""chicken"" and lacked seasoning. It was salty, yes but nothing interesting or complex about the flavor. 

The burgers came without ketchup or mustard.

I wanted to go to Mon Ami, but the long line was too unbearable.  Plus Yelp reviews didn't give high marks to that place.  I decided to head to Planet Hollywood and walked outside and saw this place.  Sure, I saw it from the inside, but it looked like and sounded like a candy store.  Much to my surprise, it was a full fledged restaurant with a great view of the strip and the fountain show at the Bellagio.  The menu was mostly sandwiches with few entree selection.  But nonetheless, I was happy with the choices, even though it seem like family oriented selections.  I could see myself heading back here.",7dnh9OrD8LekBwvachGH5Q,0,0,3,tz1HRuevOdefNk2Yg8yRkQ

After being told it would be a 2 hour wait at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, we went to Sugar Factory because we were so hungry, we couldn't wait any longer. So, after a 20 minute wait, the 4 of us got seated at a tiny table (and they're all squished together). I'm a small girl and I even had to squeeze to get to the table. Our waitress was very slow, and pretty much just took our order and brought our check at the end. That's how little we saw her. Other waiters/waitresses brought us our food and filled our beverages.

I ordered the mediterranean salad, which was disgusting. wilted and overdressed lettuce, the most bitter olives ever, way too much feta, and quishy vegetables. The best thing on the plate was the pita. It was bad, and expensive, about $20. I was so unhappy with it, I took like 5 bites and just ate all the pita. It was that awful.

My brother in law got a tiny cup of tortilla soup and that cost him $9 alone!

The chicken and waffles were just okay. The waffle was standard but well made, the chicken was a tenderloin piece with a wet breading. However, the dish seemed under seasoned and was lacking the sweet salty combo.  

My onion rings were the right amount of crispness and not too oily, however the parse amount of chipotle aioli gave the dish a very oily aftertaste.

No offense but who are you people to walk into a packed restaurant, see your waiter/waitress running around like chickens with their heads cut off & STILL expect them to massage you as your take your order? OH. You must have never worked in Vegas before. So long as your waiter isn't cussing at you and is apologetic about maybe not checking in every 20 seconds, as most of you expect- stop busting their chops!

Everytime we come, we're friendly with the staff and make jokes & we have never had bad service. Instead of being so rude, maybe be friendly and they'll send their buddies to come check up on you as they do us. Try it out sometime. 

ANYWAY. The food here is AMAZING. I'm no self-proclaimed ""foody"" but I am picky as all hell. The drinks? TO DIE FOR. This is what makes me come back. Those goblets are.....amazing. Nothing short of heavenly. 

The food is your typical all-American food with a smidgen of something different to make it unique. It's good. It's not going to make you dive into the Bellagio fountains across the way but it'll do this review justice. The red velvet sunday......my God I want to put my whole damn face in it. 

It's a place to go to HAVE FUN & ENJOY YOURSELF. And  IT IS WHAT IT SAYS IT IS- an American brasserie. 

DELICIOUS. Atmosphere is fun & there's ALWAYS some kinda celebrity eating in there. You can also people watch as it is RIGHT on the strip. We always have a good time here! Yeah, you may have to wait a little for your food or another refill, etc but once you see how packed it is on any given night- you'll understand, it's not out of malice- it's just genuinely busy.

I went for the first this past Friday night and my cousin and I had a 7:30pm reservation for 5!! Of course we had to wait an additional 20 minutes when we got there, while watching people who came after us with similar party sizes go before us! It was not until we asked again they said oh your next! (Of course) The hostess were rude and had the attitude they were above looking at anyone while speaking to them... 
After being seated it was 15 minutes before our, no personality server came to our table... She then explained that there is a $2 fee per glass of water (which is insane) it is tap water in a glass bottle!!!! Who does that?!?!?
We ordered an appetizer (fried macaroni) which came out cold and besides this she gave us no plates or utensils (guess we should use our hands and lick our fingers)....

I received the wrong drink (which I was still charged for when the bill came). We were finally able to order entrees, which again took forever. Ok I understand it is a Friday night, but being at a restaurant for over 2 hours just waiting for majority if the time is ridiculous. When the entrees came out the turkey burger I ordered had the red onion mayo on it which I had asked her to take off. When she came back to the table I asked her how long it would take to remake it (because the mayo was smothered on the top and bottom bun which made it impossible to wipe off). She said she would have it out within 5-10 , minutes. I agreed to have to remade but after 15 ,minutes I asked her how much longer, she said it was coming out. It took 25 minutes to get a remade turkey burger!!!! Really!!! That's not the worst part. This time it came out without the grilled onion (so wrong again)!! 

I called our server over I explained to her it came out without the onions (do you think she offered to bring some out) absolutely not she just looked at me like she had no clue what to say. She says don't worry I'll discount your bill (like I was just looking for this the entire time). I think not!! I don't need your discount, how about the right order and some decent service!!!! Remind you by the time I got the food everyone else was finished eating. Dessert was out of the question at this point, although it was never offered anyway!!!

To finish the night our server brings the bill, wait for it!!!!!!! With a $3 discount of off my $16 burger. Hahahahaha. All I could do was laugh... I called the manager over (he never gave his name or acted like he was remotely interested in what I had to say... He was a middle eastern man if the management reads this or cares)
He listens to what I have to say the says okay!?!?!?!?
Okay what? I'll talk to her! I don't know what you want me to do!!! 
Absolutely nothing sir! Please let your server know her tip was the burger she brought out wrong twice and did not in anyway attempt to fix and the $3 discount she thought she was doing me a favor with.... I will make sure to never come back and advise my friends the same...

I dine out regularly and never expect comps, free food or any special treatment. The only time I bring it to the attention of management is when  the restaurant is at fault and providing the type of service they say they provide. Especially with strip prices...

Sugar factory get it together!!!!! What a joke! I have friends who I have shared this experience with and they said they have had similar experiences and no longer go here also!!! 
I'm sure sugar factory does not care because they rely on out of towners and not repeat business....

I ordered the French Toast which were very tasty. Could have used more powdered sugar (hence sugar factory) but overall it was good. My friends has the blueberry pancakes and said it was really good.

2628031,2012-01-13,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I'm obsessed with candy... a bonafide sugar freak.  I love the Sugar Factory candy locations so I was excited to go to their restaurant for my birthday luncheon.  My boyfriend called to make a reservation for 6 people at noon and they told him to just come in-- no reservation necessary.  Cool, right?  Not so cool when there's a 30 minute wait.  So do they not take reservations or was the person on the phone just too lazy to take our reservation?

Either way, we finally sat down and waited... waited... waited for our server.  Finally, she came to the table and we ordered our drinks and food (since we had 30 minutes to review the menu before waiting for our table and another 20 while waiting for our server).  My boyfriend asked for a virgin root beer float (they only had an alcoholic root beer float listed on their menu).  The waitress frowned and informed us that she would see what she could do.  Ummm how about ask the bartender to just NOT ADD BOOZE?

The food tasted outstanding.  One of the best burgers I have had in Vegas actually.  However, as my boyfriend got down to the last few bites of his pasta, he found a cute little black curly hair.  DISGUSTING!!!  Poor guy almost threw up and couldn't even look at the bowl any longer.  That pretty much made everyone else at the table lose their appetites.

Our waitress checked back with us (after we had finished eating) and I asked where our drinks were.  Yes, we still hadn't received the drinks we ordered from the bar.  She said something like, ""Yeah, the bartender still hasn't made them.""  I looked across the room at the bartender and he was chatting with several customers.  I don't know if the server forgot the put the order in with the bartender or if the bartender was just lazy... either way, I was thirsty!  Finally, the drinks came (ironically, just a few minutes after I asked about them).  I ordered the Swedish Fish.  It was good, but didn't taste like a Swedish Fish... more like tropical punch.  

The manager walked around to all the tables asking how everyone's experience was.  I told him about our lousy service and the nasty hair in my boyfriend's food and he was very apologetic.  He comped my bf's pasta and all of the alcoholic drinks.  He even gave me his card and said that the next time I want to come in I can e-mail him and he will make sure we don't have to wait and have a better experience.  If only our server would have had his sense of customer service!

Even though he offered to ""take care"" of us the next time, I don't think there's going to be a next time.  Although the food was superb, there are too many other options in Vegas that offer great food AND great service.",9NmyPV_MuUn3AwcLhkafXw,1,0,1,NRsdm7bzZ-ambk6SLo71tA

2629578,2014-06-24,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"The Sugar Factory candy shop was closed when we got there after late dinner but fortunately we were able to sit in the main dining area in the Brasserie, which is connected to the candy shop! We wanted some desserts but only saw cocktails, drinks, and breakfast in the menu. You'd have to ask for the dessert menu. So I got the S'mores crêpe. It was super chocolatey topped with mini marshmallows and the best part: it's drizzled with caramel! The crêpe itself was slightly drier than the one I had in Sawtelle but only VERY SLIGHTLY and the whole ensemble was a perfect medley of sweet and fruity. Add fresh berries and vanilla ice cream for additional 3 bucks because they're so worth it. The crêpe is pretty decent sized and I definitely had to share it with another person.

I also ordered French onion soup for dessert (strange choice of dessert I know xD). The soup itself is on the smaller side (like a side soup) but who tries to get full off a soup anyway? It had a thick layer of yummy white cheese that looked like mozzarella, but I could be wrong as I'm not a cheese expert. You don't get much soup and the small amount of soup in the bowl was beyond salty!! I kind of expected that because the French onion soup I had before at a different restaurant was this salty too, but it was kind of too much and I was actually glad that the soup wasn't too big lol

It was a Monday night after midnight and the place was still packed dining and drinking customers. It might be a little hard to flag down your server when the place is busy so try to order or ask for things all at once. The service was pretty good though. Also, they are known for their bigass goblets of candied and gummy candied cocktails. Most tables around us had one of those. They look mighty awesome! I would probably stop by for one of the goblets next time.",K1yXgn4yAXt0ttxoBgQAPg,1,1,4,yPPYFAZ9P45GsH8jjmTmiw

I've tried the mac & cheese pops which are pretty good but not the best fried mac & cheese I've ever had... the steak sandwich however, is out of this world. Truly in my top-5 meals of my life, it's THAT good. I've also had the chicken fingers appetizer and those are delicious too. 

The real reason to go however (steak sandwich not withstanding) are the goblet drinks.They are simply outstanding. The lollipop and white gummi ones are my favorites, not such a fan of the shark-bowl one but it's just VERY candy flavored so that's a personal preference thing. In any case, with at least 8 shots in each goblet, they'll get you messed up in a jiffy even if you share (and you really should-they're HUGE). 

It's definitely a really fun option if you're in Vegas with a group of girlfriends and you want a reasonably priced (for Vegas, anyway) nice dinner before going out. It's also great as a romantic dinner, I've been with my boyfriend before going out to a show (Absinthe) and had a wonderful time.",NCtqaGU-8xhAo9G0d0vv2g,0,1,5,Pnj17KRvzW-uA8b_U0e5wg

It was so loud that the waitress was yelling at me all night just so I could hear her. The decor is swanky and romantic, but romance is the last thing on your mind when you're almost sitting on your neighbors lap. Its unfortunate that there are so many tables crammed into the place because it could actually be an enjoyable space. Now that I bitched about the lack of any kind of enjoyable ambiance, lets get to the food. Five Stars ! Really, the food is top notch and there is a pretty large variety of it to choose from. The Sugar Factory is open 24 hours so you of course can find lots of Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner items. Simone choose a savory crepe stuffed full with fresh grilled chicken, sauteed mushrooms and artichokes, topped off with a creamy Bechemel Sauce and spinach. The other ingredients were overshadowed by the taste of mushrooms so If you love them, like I do,  then you'll love this. The spinach was oddly piled on top of the crepe making for a rather messy and unusual presentation and it didn't add anything to the dish. For my meal I ordered the Mediterranean Parpadelle Chicken Pasta , and for an extra two dollars a side of garlic bread(frigging Vegas up-charges)This dish was much better then I expected and probably the best pasta dish I have had in the past few years.  The pasta tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly el Dante. Red Pepper infused Olive Oil with Grilled Chicken, Artichokes, Tomatoes, Olives and Feta cheese all married together in a perfect hot and salty food orgy. The dish had a nice bite from the oil and it left me wanting more. I finished off the rather large portion with ease. Unfortunately we did not try any dessert ( and yes I know its called the Sugar Factory- I don't care)  My headache was starting to get the best of me and I was tired of being yelled at by my waitress so away we went.

I will say that for the expensive price, you do get a lot.  It was good but the portion size was too large.  Perhaps if they lowered the size in proportion to the price it would be better.

My friend and I split the lollipop passion goblet.  It was sinfully delicious.  The sugar rush from consuming this drink felt like a sugar tsunami!

The service was decent.  I felt like our server was hurry us out.  He didn't even ask if we wanted dessert.  The restaurant was empty too, so I don't know why he gave us the bill so early as his shift just started.

I sooo wanted sweets, but I thought breakfast was more prudent and maybe there would be room for a crepe afterwards.  After checking out the large menu, I went with the open faced fried egg sandwich.  It was pretty good, but not really what I expected exactly.  It did say skinny fries on the menu, but I didn't realize that it would be smothered with them.  And it was a little dry until I ordered extra gravy.  But, overall, good flavor.  I probably would pick something else next time.  

The husband ordered a BLT and he said it was great and my friend ordered chicken and waffles and that was HUGE.  They give you a LOT of fired chicken with it and both she and my husband who helped with the big portion said it was very tasty.  

For those three items and an iced tea, our bill was $56 before the tip.

My friend and I shared a 36 Oz white gummy fishbowl drink.  I really liked it.  A lot of the previous reviews say not to waste too much time or money here but if you think about it is $1=1 oz.  A lot of these martinis in Vegas are like $7 for 6-8 ounces of alcohol, plus ice so it's a good deal.  I also read that they can't taste the alcohol.  Which is bull. I definitely tasted the alcohol - on the first sip.

 I rambled about the alcohol because... well... Vegas.

I arrive last and I already see the rest of the group (party of 6) waiting in the lounge area to be seated to a table.   I couldn't help but notice other groups getting greeted and then seated promptly.

Host up front right next to us does not check to see how we are doing nor update us.  People dressed in business suits come in and receive a warm greeting and get seated.

We eventually (and good for us) decide to leave and go to Bacchanal for their breakfast buffet instead.  Good  move on our part.  We give our menu back to the hostess and they don't even ask us what is wrong or try to get us to stay or apologize for anything. 

Unfortunately, because of the lack of service or attention, Sugar Factory, you have lost 6 customers and probably more from us no longer recommending the place to anyone.",Mho2GibREwsPesKEyQbt8w,2,0,1,PGSvOPMfMTjzpnyafNV_Hg

We also eventually saw some of the food...  Not 3/4's of it, given the service issues that I may have mentioned, but a few bites here and there.  Needless to say, we didn't actually eat the food, as it was time to take our business elsewhere.

Anyway... I came here 3 time during a trip to Vegas.  Once just for shakes and candy with the kids.  The shakes were prety good but definitely not worth $10 each.  Then we came for brunch with a groupon.  Again, nothing special.  Food was mediocre and priced too high.  Service was ok, not teriffic. It's a crowded place so that could affect attentiveness of the staff. We were underwhelmed but I forgot to use the groupon so we had to go back again before heading home.  Once again, nothing was special, nothing was delicious, nothing was terrible.  Still, $10 for a shake, $30 for a coctail (albeit huge) and $25 for chicken and waffles (obviously not homemade) isn't worth it.

2729858,2014-04-08,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Had Sunday brunch here yesterday for a birthday celebration.  One of the worst experiences I have had in a while.  You know how they say ""If you have a good time, you will tell one person, but if you have a bad time you will tell 10,"" this is one of those instances.

The main reason we came here was for the ""bottomless"" Mimosas.  The service was so slow that at any given time, half of our table did not have any drinks. Unacceptable.  They serve the Mimosas out of very tiny 3 oz. glasses. I mean come on... thats like three gulps.  

The server could sense that we were semi-annoyed, and then gave us a little attitude.  In her defense, she was serving 5-7 other tables.  But still.. After the 3rd round, the ""Mimosa"" was 90% orange juice and 10% Champagne.  We had the busboy take the drinks away in hopes that the next round would be stronger.  10 minutes go by and we are still drink-less.  After asking three more times, from three different people, the busboy walks by and says ""there was alcohol in those drinks.""  

What? Why are you even telling me this? I am pretty upset by now.  I watch restaurant impossible and mystery diners.  I must emphasize I do not think I'm better than anyone, but from a business stand point, why is the busboy telling me I am wrong?  I mean if you advertise ""bottomless"" Mimosas, thats what I expect.  So after exchanging words with this busboy. We spoke to the owner. Explained the situation, and he went to go figure everything out.  

The review is purely on service.  I had the eggs and bacon, can't really mess that up. Actually now that I think about it, I asked for fruit instead of the home fries, and guess what? I got home fries.  

I didn't want to deal with the situation, so I just gave my friends money and left.

I will not be returning to this place.",0idpso6G1o1H_aaMfF2YgQ,2,0,1,qkNZZD2fLjeINDiRlZg4lA
2732938,2011-04-25,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"This place was definitely A-OK, as the three stars implies.  If Yelp allowed me to give half stars, I'd even give em 3.5 stars.

The Pros-
The location - right across the street from the Bellagio - so get a good seat and you get to see the fountains go off....and I'm a sucker for a good dinner view.
The salad - my Caesar salad was light and refreshing and not drenched in dressing.  
The portions - definitely looked like Goldilocks-sized portions..not too much, not too little. I think just right for the money.  
The service - our server was prompt and friendly and seemed eager to help us out. 
The ambiance - it reminds me so much of a place we have here in Pasadena (in terms of decor) called Pop Champagne Bar - kind of hip, romantic/gothic, dark, candles everywhere, etc. 
The variety of desserts and milkshakes and 'fancy' drinks - need to give in to that sweet tooth of yours? It seemed like endless possibilities were available for that sort of thing - - milkshakes galore!
The fact that the Sugar Factory candy store is just across the way - so you can REALLY indulge that sweet tooth of yours.

The Cons-
The theme of the restaurant seemed really at a discord with the food of the restaurant.  I mean, it's an American Brasserie.  
My soup - My French Onion Soup, which I usually am a big fan of, was really salty and all the cheese was gooped up at the bottom, instead of being nicely melted and toasted at the top.  It still was good...but for me, definitely not good enough to finish my little cup portion. 
The reminiscent-of-Cheesecake-Factory feel - while the ambiance was pretty, everything about the place, decor, book-style menu, an unfocused menu...made me feel like I was at the Cheesecake Factory. Eh. Not my favorite of restaurants. 
The salad- yeah, I know this was above in the pros section. And I stand by the fact that my Caesar was pretty good.  I just wish the salad was a bit crisper.

All in all, it's one of those places you come because it's ""there""...or you need to entertain your children by sending em over to indulge in the sugar side while you try to enjoy yourself in the 'brasserie' side.

My club sandwich was mediocre. The dessert pizza was a huge disappointment because the crust was just awful: it tasted like overcooked Boboli pizza crust with caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and marshmallows poured on top. We chose this restaurant because the desserts looked good so it was almost unforgivable that our chosen dessert was so bad. 

I will say this is probably one of the more affordable restaurant choices on the strip. The simplicity of the menu choices and the huge number of menu choices make this a good place to bring kids, much like a Cheesecake Factory.",vSTi9G85c5c8RNPFIEMETQ,2,1,3,n2h-dY3c3yzVYUGSMZZruQ

Ate kinda early (530 pm) so there was no wait.  Server was super friendly and the whole staff was attentive.  Our water glasses were never more than half empty and one of the managers stopped and talked to us for a few minutes.  Decor is elegant but fun, and the outdoor patio is a nice touch, although your view overlooks the road...

I got a thin crust cheese pizza and my husband got the Signature burger with pepperjack, sans their special sauce because it had tomatoes and he hates tomatoes.  Pizza was awesome.  Nice and simple and the crust was excellent.  Only complaint is that the bottom of the pizza crust was a little soggy.  I was hoping for crispy crust all the way through.  My husband loved his burger.  He loves pepperjack cheese so I thought that was going to be what he was most excited about.  However when I asked him how the cheese was he said he couldn't even taste it because the burger was too good. He especially liked the crispy onions on the burger.  And the fries were to DIE for.  If we go back I'm getting a basket of fries just for myself.

And since it was Sugar Factory we decided to get dessert.  Yes $10 for a sundae is a lot, but A) it was worth it and B) it was gigantic.

A M A Z I N G. This place is amazing. Besides the fact that it's open 24-hrs (including the candy shop and even the bar, I believe) the food is awesome.

I was in Vegas this past weekend for five days, and I came here three times. The first two times, me and my mom ordered the chicken and waffles. They were so good! The flavor was well-balanced, and the chicken was crispy and delicious on the outside, juicy on the inside. My mom's boyfriend had also tried the club sandwich, which he enjoyed, and we split a side of bacon. Bacon is always a winner.

The third time we came was purely for dessert. We ordered the fondue for two, and I ordered another side of bacon (which I proceeded to dip in the fondue as well). The fondue was quite good. It was smooth and didn't taste like the kind of chocolate you find in a regular old candy bar, probably really high-quality. They give you a nice little assortment of items to dip in there: strawberries, bananas, brownies, lemon pound cake, white chocolate bread, gummy bears, and marshmallows. Honestly, the marshmallows were more like sugar cubes in texture though. I definitely recommend getting the side of bacon to dip in there for a nice salty-sweet combo.

Our new go-to spot, we'll definitely be back.",lWzggVjPgC7YPpoesdPo5w,0,1,4,53fCoY5IcCwVWae91mHBfw

The Jolly Rancher martini is really really great also. Their happy hour is really awesome - two for one, I think?

We split the chicken fingers and sliders to leave room for a sugary dessert, since that is the point of the place.

Chicken fingers were pretty standard. They tasted good - crispy and came with some ranch dipping sauce as well as some yellow one, mustard I think. You can't go too wrong with Chicken Fingers. The sliders were less than good. The bun was dry and the meat patty looked not that cooked and had a tasteless rubbery texture. Well, that fulfilled the 'real food' category of lunch.

Next we ordered the Red Velvet ice cream sunday. I love red velvet and was expecting something really good... No, it was sub-par blah-ness. It was scoops of mediocre vanilla and strawberry ice cream interspersed with cheap-o whipping cream, raspberries, chocolate sauce, and a few little soso-tasting squares of red velvet cake. It should have been called berry sundae. The red velvet was so minimal in it, it was pitiful. Nothing about it even tasted like red velvet. 

I wished so much that I spent my calories on Ghiradelli.

Ive tried several new drinks since then, including two goblets -- the gummi bear and the green one (forgot what it was called).  I had been dying to try these forever and boy were they a HUGE dissapointment! I didn't care for the flavor of either -- they were both WAY too tart for my taste.  On top of that there was zero alcohol in them.  Now I understand why they wouldnt load something like this up on alcohol, but their regular cocktails are much stronger than these are which is pretty ridiculous. And at $36, I'm expecting it to be somewhat stronger than that.  I drank the entire goblet by myself in about an hour and didn't leave with any type of a buzz.  Seriously?  Huge rip off all around.

Service is depressing. I'm getting the feeling that people in these jobs just really hate their lives. Hmm let's see, I wait on line at the sign that says order here. Place order. Receive gelato. Proceed to end of counter where the register is at with a sign that says pay here. Then I wait. And wait some more. But wait, there's more! More waiting! Finally the same dud (yes I left the e off the end on purpose) comes over and mumbles that I can go pay at the middle kiosk if I want. I'm sorry I could not understand you; is it because your tongue is too big for your mouth or do you have a really hip tongue piercing in there?  My reply...I'd prefer to just walk out without paying. A quick scan of the ceiling...yep cameras, damn. So I goto the kiosk and guess what? I waited 5 minutes more to pay for this substandard gelato!

Finally I'm on my merry way to the counter between the candy shop and the restaurant to have a sit down with my gelato. Decided to scan my receipt. Wouldn't you know it...a mystery charge titled CNF. Whats CNF you ask? Well here's what they do; they charge you the advertised 5 bucks for the gelato then tack on the mandatory 8.1% sales tax and then take that total and tack on 3.5% more and call it CNF. Yes the tax on food here is now 11.6%!?!?!  Such B.S. just increase your prices 3.5% so everyone knows what they are paying instead of tacking on mystery charges.

1) It can be incredibly slow. Even if you come at a time that isn't packed (which is most of the time) it takes what seems to be too long to get your food for what you order. On this most recent visit I was alone and ordered a sandwich and it look about 30 minutes.

2) Price. This place is wicked expensive for what it is. The food is good, but not amazing. But apparently you are paying for atmosphere and location because my simple sandwich was $16. 

Drinks can get out of control too if you stray away from anything other than iced tea or sodas. A milkshake can run $8-10 or more depending on what you put in it. And their cocktails are ridiculous. Most are $15 or more, and if you order one of their goblets you're looking at $40!

As for the food quality, it's fine. My sandwich was a little dry, but tasty. The milkshake I has was expensive but awesome (bug chucks of peanut better and chocolate chucks). But you kind of expect their desserts to be better than the food with a name like Sugar Factory, right?

They have a massive dessert menu with incredible options. They are all crazy expensive as well ($5 for a small basic cake pop, $10 for a fancy decorated one) but I will say that each of the items I've had here so far have been really good, even though some are slightly too sweet or rich for my taste buds.

Bottom line: If you want great food, go elsewhere. If you want a fun place to have desserts and drinks, and don't mind paying extra for atmosphere, this is a great option.",Br8LOacyANG7nI9r0DRqLQ,3,2,3,pBOk-Zfy2rlX8SO157iWGw

Their menu is pretty small with traditional treats.  You can find a basic eggs plate along with burgers and sandwiches.  The service is on the slow side.  I realize they were packed, but I would think they are packed regularly so their timeliness should be a little better.

I would skip the restaurant and just enjoy the treats at the bar.",lml6FykyqAxURGJaGA8tdQ,0,0,3,s94md0Odcc0_5tO3ffulYw

They make pretty fruity drinks that taste like candy, but a half filled martini will cost you $16. I paid less EVERYWHERE ELSE. Also, the goblets they have are deceitful... as they are $40 in a logo glass but you cant keep the glass. BUT if you go to the sugar factory bar in Planet Hollywood, you CAN keep the goblet. Hmmm! Eating dessert is the ONLY reason to come here. It looks really alluring on the outside, but the pretty 20-something girls they hire are typically not too into having a job... mostly just talking at the front. 

The food is overall pretty flavorless and the service is absolutely awful, so if you are on any sort of time crunch, go elsewhere. The view from the patio (Ballagio water show), and the Froot Loop Pannacotta are what earned this place its 3rd star. That pannacotta is legendairy... see what I did there? They use froot loop infused milk to make it! Yum!

What was ordered: french dip sandwich, pizza burger, steak & frites, salmon (don't remember the exact name, but came with asparagus), waffle (came with fruits, chocolate, whipped cream & ice cream), and Chinese chicken salad.  

Out of the 6 people who sat at our table, only 2 of us were somewhat satisfied with our orders, both of them ordered dishes that were sweet in taste.  The waffle & chicken salad.  

Fortunately for me, I was the one that ordered the salad, and although it was good, it wasn't bombdiggity.  And I've had salads from other places less trendy and expensive that tasted the same or better.

3034970,2014-06-03,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"The food here is definitely tasty, but not tasty in a fine-dining, high-quality sense.  The reason this food is so great, in my opinion, is because sugar is a main ingredient in EVERYTHING!  I ordered the Signature Burger, which has a white chocolate bun.  When I bit into this burger,  I could taste the sugar in the bun.  Like I said, it was delicious.  But when I actually took a look at the burger I was eating, I could tell it was low-quality.  I would compare it to the cheap, frozen hamburger patties at the grocery store.  

The alcoholic beverages on the menu are really interesting and unique, but they are extremely expensive.  I couldn't bring myself to indulge in one, so I can't comment further.

I was really looking forward to dessert, because I love sweets.  I ordered the Chocolate Torte and, to my complete surprise, I did not love it. Flourless chocolate cake is my absolute favorite, but this one was extremely thick, sticky, and sweet to a fault.  I actually felt like my teeth started to hurt and I couldn't finish it.  The other diners in my party had the Milk Chocolate Mousse Bar and the hot fudge sundae.  I had a bite of the Mousse Bar, and it seemed to be less sickly sweet than my Chocolate Torte, but not by much.

All in all, definitely not a place to go for a healthy meal... but you could probably figure that out by the name of the restaurant.  Decent but obstructed view of the Bellagio fountain, mist to keep you cool while eating outside, upbeat and youthful music played throughout, and inventive, unique (if expensive) alcoholic drinks.   I feel this establishment is too pricey for the quality of food it serves, but it can get away with these prices due to the unique experience it offers customers.

If you were looking for a better quality alternative in Paris, I would recommend Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis.  In the same price range, but higher quality food.",dnW2jx1ZbkzymzQS2LRhxA,0,0,3,DR_AYpC3rBIYtvNNL3tt3g

our waiter was okay. not that helpful, but friendly. the menu is huge so be prepared for lots of choices. that is the downfall i had. i hate having so many yummy things to choose from.
the ladies of the table decided on a nutella crepe to share along with a chocolate cookie jar milkshake while my grandfather opted for a lemon meringue tart. we waited probably 15-20 minutes for our desserts while admiring everyone else's around us. i must get back here to try the goblets. perhaps a birthday party dinner?
our food came out and we were all in shock with how amazing it all looked. we def should have ordered more between the ladies, but holy sugar factory heavens was this delicious. the milkshake came in a mug that was larger than my head. i can't even make this up. i could taste so many cookies in there. i had a bite of the lemon meringue tart and even that was amazing.
this place won all of us over. the prices aren't too bad either which is a great thing. typical strip prices so don't expect 6 dollars for a crepe.

I came here for a birthday party (late at night), so the majority of us only ordered drinks and desserts.  

I ordered a glass of red wine and the Nutella crepe. The cabernet was okay, I would recommend the drink goblets, but the Nutella crepe was yummy.

A little expensive for something I could make at home for $3.00, but when you go here, you pay for the atmosphere and view.  Sugar Factory has an AMAZING view of the Bellagio fountains - one of the best in the city, in fact. Gorgeous french doors opens the restaurant to views of Bellagio, Caesars, and the Cosmopolitan.  During the day, I would imagine this location being great for people watching.

The restaurant was extremely loud, and it was difficult (to say the least) to hear across the table.  Even the waiter had to yell at us in order for anyone to hear him.  

The service was okay.  The server was not as attentive as he could have been (it took forever for us to get our bill/drink refills). 

The store connected to the restaurant is pretty neat.  They have just about every type of candy you could imagine (and of course, the world famous lollipops).  - Pretty cool, I must say.

Pro: Restaurant food and drinks were AMAZING! Well Priced! Open 24 hrs

Con: Desserts are TERRIBLE! Don't bother trying them.

This was one place on my trip to Vegas that I definitely wanted to stop in because of their amazing looking drinks. I also wanted to check out the crystallized lollipops just to see what they looked like.

In a great location across from our hotel, this was the perfect location to start our trip. We had lunch here around 2 pm, and we got a good view of the Bellagio water show (daytime version). Cozy, not over air-conditioned like most places in Vegas, and reasonably priced.

I had the Turkey burger with sweet potato fries and it was DELISH! My 3 other friends enjoyed their meals, as well. The drinks... were... PHENOM! They were also HUGE so we split 2 drinks among 4 girls. We had the lollipop signature drink, and the gummi bear drink. I preferred the gummi bear. It was just sweet enough and tasted like juice. Just the presentation of the drinks was awesome... they bring out the ""fish bowl"" like glasses with ice, and pour the drink in front of you so it gives off a dry ice effect. So worth it! 

Now for the bad... we returned here for dessert before our flight home. This must be where the bad reviews for this place come from. The gelato was chalky, I personally had a ""Barbi"" smoothie and it was TERRIBLE... tasted like pure strawberry syrup. For an $8 shake, I couldn't wait to toss it out, it was that bad. We also brought back the little cupcake cookie jars, and the cookies were stale and not tasty. My cousin tried the Red Velvet cupcake and it was dry, hard, and tasteless.... so basically, all their desserts are a no go... from the gelato, to shakes, cupcakes, and cookies.

It is beautiful at night because you can see the water show at the Bellagio across the street. 

They have these amazing, and giant drinks which are colorful and sugary and full of alcohol.  I didn't try one, but if they taste as good as they look, I would say that it is a must do while in Vegas.  I also love the dark atmosphere of the restaurant. 

It is attached to the actual candy store which was fun to look through afterwards, they have a lot of hard to find candy and vintage stuff.  Pretty cool place.

Food was decent, but definitely over-priced. Didn't have any drinks, which seems to be the main appeal here. Dessert however was impressive; they make a mean panna cotta. 

The restaurant itself is very nice looking, it's pretty spacious and spread out with fancy black chandeliers and such to make it look very up-scale. Yet at the same time it seems to attract a very...different type of clientele! People who are looking to drink entire punch bowls of alcohol, to be exact. I mean, it's Vegas and everyone wants to get wasted, I get that. But what I don't understand about this place is how they can charge $40 for a drink and you don't even get to keep those gigantic goblets? That seems ridiculous to me.

Anyway, as for the food, it was average but nothing too special. Our group of ladies came right around brunch time so a couple of us got breakfast and others got lunch. Another girl and I ordered the carbonara, two girls ordered pretty basic looking $13 omlettes and another had a ""classic"" $15 burger with decent fries.

Everything was alright but one strange thing was that the two carbonara dishes we received looked totally different. The one I got seemed to be a bigger portion than the other and the top was covered with green peas while the other dish didn't have much green on it at all. I'm definitely a stickler for consistency and when our friend mentioned this discrepancy to the waitress, she just brushed it off with a ""Oh, well yours is just tossed"". That didn't really explain the size difference but clearly she didn't want to deal with us. Customer service here is obviously not their forte.

While my dish did look better, it needed more salt/pepper since it was pretty bland. I ended up doctoring it myself to make it more palatable. For a $17 pasta dish though, it should have been better than it was. I will never understand how people can charge so much for probably one of the cheapest foods there is. C'est Las Vegas though, I guess! 

The fruit loop panna cotta was a redeeming dish, it had a great flavor and consistency but I still don't think I would return in the future. There are just so many other worthy restaurants in Vegas, even Mon Ami Gabi right next door would be a better choice in my opinion.
And if you just really want those drinks, go into the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile. There's a counter that serves the Sugar Factory goblet drinks AND you get to keep the glass!!!

Why you would ever come to the restaurant is beyond me...maybe people just want to sit on the same seats where celebrity asses have been? Meh.",p3e9i4tlHM7EhvvUKJyqzg,5,3,3,TWKESIGEPqcedsjtjKMJoQ

I went here for a dinner around 10:00 p.m. last Saturday night.  When the waiter came over, he only greeted my friends, and did not glance my way.  I didn't think anything of it, until it continued throughout our meal.  At first, I thought I had committed some error such as lining my eyes with my fire-engine red lipliner, but when I went to the bathroom, everything was normal.  When we ordered, the waiter stared fixedly at my friends (a male and a female couple), and would not look at me, would not even look my way.  He took my female friend's order, and then asked my male friend what he would like.  My male friend, aghast at this waiter's actions, said, ""There's another woman here at the table.  Perhaps you should take her order before mine.""  Finally, I'm thinking, the waiter will look at me.  Nope.  When he asked me what I would like, his gaze was askance.  Unbelievable.

3233575,2011-07-23,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"This place BARELY gets 3 stars. I'm sorry, but this is basically a knock off of Dylan's Candy Bar and then add a restaurant to it. I went for dinner as part of a bachelorette party (I did not pick the restaurant). It was picked because ""one of the Kardashian's had just eaten here"". Ok, we're from LA - who gives a shit who has eaten anywhere. I'm sure they were paid to eat there to boost this new restaurant. Ok..moving on.

We entered from the hotel side through their Chocolate Lounge - I wish I could write a separate review of the lounge...so just scroll down. Our reservations were available on time, but the hostess looked like she could have cared less that anyone, let alone customers, were standing in front of her. Walk back to the round table where they squeezed 7 of us between two four tops. The menu is huge, think Cheesecake Factory. Specialty drinks are....special. Great ideas but honestly too sweet to actually consume. Everyone but the bride got wine and her specialty drink was finished but not so much enjoyed. 

The food was fine, hence the 3 stars. There was nothing wrong with it, but also nothing fantastic. Everyone's food was just - average. 

Our poor waiter, was great for the most part. Then, while clearing the plates, squeezed between the tables, he accidentally spilled some of the dressing off a salad down one of our friends' dresses. The oil, of course ruined the cream dress. Now, she was able to dab it off and it dried pretty clear so it didn't ruin the night - but here is my problem. The waiter was great, he was super sorry - and it was obviously an accident. IT TOOK 20 MINUTES FOR THE MANAGER TO COME OVER. Even when he did, he was barely sorry, we had to coax him comping the meal and some drinks, and then he (begrudgingly) offered to pay for the dry cleaning of the dress. I'm sorry, but that is pathetic. You may so, oh well I'm sure it was because they were so busy. Sure they were busy, but he saw him wondering around checking on tables...and talking with our waiter numerous times. He knew where we were, and what had happened, and was just to pathetic to come over.


NOW FOR THE CHOCOLATE LOUNGE!! Omg I want to give this 5 stars. After this fiasco, and a lil walk through the candy shop, I suggested we go next door for some champagne and chocolate (hoping it would be a lil mood pick me up). It was amazing. There are lots of different chocolate and fondue options so you can get something pretty small and inexpensive, or ridiculously opulent. Our waiter saw our 7 person bachelorette party coming and fixed us up at a nice booth and bumped up our original order. We ended up with the 3 chocolate taster (white, dark, milk chocolate) and then 6 options (white chocolate bread, bananas, strawberries, pound cake, gummy bears and...HOMEMADE MARSHMALLOWS). The marshmallows made up for the entire evening in my mind. 

So skip the restaurant, go straight for the chocolate lounge and stay there.",9EWFblLiRtv5nEbvFEuM8Q,1,0,2,MBAuOxY47TJar2lqpyXHPw

While we weren't able to sit in the same area, we were able to make two separate reservations for about 20 people each for a 1pm time slot. Parties of 30 or more will have to do some expensive buffet arrangement. We just wanted food. 

After a night of going out, the need for food was real. With such a large party, our food took a little while longer but once it arrived, it hit the spot. I ordered the Signature Burger and a side of fries, with a beef patty, tomatoes, cheese, and fried onion straws. Not healthy at all, but it's Vegas! Not a place known for healthy lifestyles.  

Looking around the table, everyone's portions were HUGE. Club sandwiches piled high with turkey, a grilled cheese BLT with TWO grilled cheeses. I definitely took half of the burger home for a snack later on. 

With their prices though, it made sense to have big portions. Extremely over priced, but expected. Especially on their drinks. While the drinks were tasty and fun to drink, very expensive for the volume and quality you got.

With a large party, would go here again. Solid selection for lunch, a good amount of space to fit big parties, and central on the strip.",-nkf1EI9VjW6MucS1b7VdA,7,4,4,fKsLYYvjj8-P7EkuKdgAuw

I've been to Sugar Factory several of times, but this last visit will have been my last. It use to be my favorite restaurant, when I lived in Las Vegas and then also when I was just a visitor from out of town. We got a Groupon $25 for $50, which was a great offer because its very overpriced. We made a reservation for 8:30pm but went over about 8:00pm to see if they could get us in sooner. We went through the entrance from inside Paris and the young kid at the front desk was just so rude. He walked us through to the front host and I noticed there was a table open in the bar area (which is open seating) and he gave us a hard time for that. We stood and waited for 5 minutes for him to talk to the front hostess when anyone could have just walked in and grabbed the table. Once we were seated, it took about 10 minutes to even be approached. The server clearly couldn't handle her section which was not even terribly busy. About 30 minutes after being there we finally got our WATERS. We ordered all of our food at once to help the server out since she looked overwhelmed. We got the food and let me just say, that was the first time Ive ever had such horrible food there! Sugar Factory is constantly changing the menu and its starting to get annoying. I ordered the crispy buffalo which was horrible, i was hoping for the buffalo wings they use to have. I also ordered the bbq chicken pizza which was dry, i had to drench it in ranch. The server didnt come over one time to check on us while we were there, I had to constantly keep asking the busser for the extra things we needed. The server finally stopped at our table when I flagged her down, and even then it took 10 minutes to get our check. She didnt offer us ANYTHING until it was time to pay and give her the tip.

The smell of chicken and waffles hit him in the perfect moment and made the call to screw Mon Ami Gabi and grab lunch at Sugar Factory instead.

Well, not the best decision in the end.

We were seated pretty quickly for a table for five.  To start we ordered fried mac and cheese appy to share.  That was pretty good as it was gooey mac n cheese that's deep fried in a boxy triangle shape with a marinara dipping sauce.  It goes downhill from here.  

My husband and I shared the chicken and waffles (of course) and others ordered the French dip, a tomato sauce pasta thing, and tater tots to share amongst the table.  The chicken and waffles here are the worst I've probably had.  I would hardly even call it chicken and waffles!  You're paying for overpriced ok tasting waffles and chicken strips that sit on top.  And maple syrup on the side.  For $23 I expect much more than this.  I know I'm paying for convenience for location but it is pretty unacceptable.

3405508,2014-05-12,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"To begin, I first gave this place a bad rating due to bad service and the way my food was served. 

But I came back today and was given the best service and when I mean best service, I mean the ""Vegas life"" you would see in movies and on billboards. I made a reservation and was seated immediately after giving my name. Usually it takes a while to be seated even if you have made reservations. Other than that, out beverages were served immediately as well. Their Goblets are one of the greatest drinks I have tasted. The way it was served was pretty colorful and full of sweets! Other than serving beverages, our food was served quickly! It didn't take 15 nor 30 minutes. It took about 5-10 minutes. Also, our host kept checking back on us which was very kind. 

Next thing I would like to comment was the food. Their steak was amazing. It was chewy and tender. I had a side of mashed potatoes and it was the greatest mashed potatoes I have ever tasted. It was not too dry, it was mouth-watering. I also have to comment on their fondue. I'm in love with the milk chocolate and the sweets they provide on the side. 

Third, we chose to sit outside. I have to say, the scenery was beautiful. Which gave it more of a ""Vegas life"" feeling. A few people were amazed by our Goblet drinks and asked if they were able to take a picture. Eating outside made it more relaxing and enjoyable. We ended up staying for a good 2 hours.

Out of the whole experience, the best thing was the atmosphere. It's obvious that large parties accommodate seating, and you get a nice view of the water fountains from Bellagio across the street.

I would suggest even the smartest of trendy tourists to avoid this place. Everything has a candy or sweet theme to it, which is unique in itself and interesting (a twinkle flavored alcoholic drink? What?), but this is obviously a classic tourist trap for overpriced food (and they go beyond what is overpriced!) I didn't see a single thing under $10 for food, and even the drinks were $7 and up. They have a good variety on the menu, almost every category you can think of (salads, soups, chicken, pasta, pizza, burgers, etc.)

Our server told us drinks were half off for happy hour. Apparently drinks are half off at the *bar* area, not the restaurant area. The whole time we were under the impression that all the drinks on the menu were half off, so I ordered the root beer cocktail that was $14 (might I add it wasn't too bad either). When you think you're getting it for $7 because someone assured it was half off and see your bill at about $20 (including gratuity for our large group that night), you're definitely going to have an issue with it!

The manager was very nice in making adjustments. Apparently it was buy one get one free, and even if it wasn't half off in the restaurant, I never got my second drink. Food was nothing special, you can have better elsewhere for over half the cost. The fries were ordinary, and my friend said the pasta wasn't anything exciting for the price he paid. 

One of the high selling points are the goblet drinks, but they're $35! Personally, I didn't see what the hype was all about. I guess if you have money to burn, this place seems like another fast-food restaurant to the rich.",ks7yFvUxYK0R7TFOam3-KA,0,0,2,TfcBAPtdhqbvlcClzbtMBQ

They had a pretty cool looking menu of mixed drinks, in particular those with vodka. I'm a beer fan and stuck with the tried and true sculpin, a San Diego based beer that was on tap. 

They have indoor and outdoor seating along the strip, and while it was 100 degree hot during the day, our evening dinner hour resulted the weather to be nice enough to sit along the outside patio and people watch. Our server was fairly quick and attentive. Once we got the food he didn't come around too often though.  So service started out good but defintely took a hit as the night went on.

Ordered the Mediterranean salad and the Sugar Factory burger. The salad was ok., nothing special that stood out. The burger on the other hand was delicious. Definitely would go back for it. That chocolate bread went perfect with everything else inside. Fries were ok too, almost slightly soggy. Whatever, it's all about the burger. Price are high of course ($12-18 avg), but if I am stumbling down the Vegas strip I would have no problem dropping $20 for a legit burger.",UGU7tw4NkiqGlOt77_o5mQ,1,1,3,rjMhFlLrZkcm5rzpw1KjEg

We went right in the middle of the day and it wasn't packed, which was great for us.  They had some really fun drinks and I wish that I could have just sat there all day and tried every drink.  I think one day, once I get down to my goal weight, I will do that.  Just go and hang out all day trying their drinks.  The Lollipop Passion looked really fun for a group of people!  I want to try that next time.  Since I could only have one drink, I chose the Blowpop.  It was SO yummy.  It wasn't too alcoholic but it also wasn't too sweet!  It had pop rocks on the rim which I licked this way to Sunday and had a Blowpop in the drink.  I liked dipping the Blowpop in the drink and then licking it.  it had the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol.  Sometimes a drink looks fun but when you get it, it's disappointing, not this place!  They are as delicious as they look.  Their mixologist did a GREAT job creating these drinks and their bar tenders execute the creations to a tee.

The food was so delicious too!  We had the fried macaroni and cheese which was a hit  with our table.  It came with this sauce that everyone loved.  My husband said, ""I don't know what this sauce is but I know I need to put it on everything!""  The spinach and artichoke dip was so creamy and seasoned perfectly.  Those two were definitely my favorites.

This place is just really fun and great for a group of people.  I can't wait to go back and try all of their drinks.  I really want to try everything they have because I know that everything is going to be an orgasm in ma mouth!",NknWFPAxaGxx_OJIEYVXWA,3,3,4,hDXnVKG2SkQjGi38RPU9Hw

I've tried a burger, spinach artichoke chip, white gummy bowl, berry basil mojito, fondue for two dessert, & apple blue cheese crumble type salad. From what i've tried so far, I've really liked each dish & cocktail! Good sized portions & great flavor. Not too sweet or not too strong of drinks. The male server I had two nights ago could have been less awkward but he wasn't bad. The only thumbs downs are how they keep the doors towards the strip open. I understand it invites customers to walk in from LV BlVD, but each time I came, I was pretty freezing from the outside wind or weather. Please seat me farther away at least. Also the tables are too close together. It's a real pet peeve when restaurants try to fit too many tables together.

For appetizers we ordered the crispy pork sliders and the spinach artichoke dip. The pork sliders were so good and different than I had expected. They seemed like little Hawaiian rolls that were stuffed and completely enclosed with the pulled pork, then fried and topped with this slaw that was also really excellent. I'm not really a slaw kind of person, but this one had me sold. The spinach artichoke dip however was lukewarm and tasted like something from Chili's that was reheated in the microwave.

3517623,2011-08-22,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Think of the Sugar Factory as a beddazzled Cheesecake Factory on steroids. It's got a large menu with just about everything on it. But, I can't tell you if it's good or bad because I only stopped by for a couple sweet treats with the family.

This place is actually broken up into four sections. The Sugar Factory American Brasserie is for dining, either indoors or on their patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains. The Sugar Factory Chocolate Lounge is a more intimate space with sweets and drinks. The Outdoor Café, located right on the Strip, is a small outdoor counter serving up sandwiches, ice cream, gelato and other sweets. Finally, the Sugar Factory retail shop is the place to get sweets and merchandise (similar to their other shops around the Strip).

The retail shop was sensory overload -- not only with the desserts, cookies, ice cream, and gelato, but also with all the crap, I mean merchandise, to buy. Plus, the place was packed with tourists. Not the place to be if you hate crowds (as I do). We purchased three items (for around $12) and found a small, quiet 4 seat counter near the Chocolate Lounge to relax.

The wife got a peanut butter cookie that she called average (and not enough peanut butter). The kid got a small cup of chocolate ice cream, which he loved. He's 3, so of course he wasn't picky about his ice cream.

I went with a key lime cupwich. It's a great -- albeit old -- concept that I'm surprised hasn't caught on with more cupcake shops. They take the bottom half of the cake portion of the cupcake and put it on top of the icing, making a sandwich. I'm a huge fan of the concept. Their version allows for a better icing-to-cake ratio and is easier to eat than most cupcakes. It looked beautiful with additional icing garnishing the top, along with a sugar-made flower and some sprinkles. It had a strong key lime flavor without being too tart. Unfortunately, the cake part was dry. 

I'd possibly come back to try other sweets. Maybe even the food. But, if you just want desserts I'd recommend heading to Jean Philippe Patisserie at Aria or Bellagio before this place.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,1,3,H38n-4XVXRc7bXAcd-uUzA

The drink tasted good and I liked the banana sugar that rimmed the drink, but the banana gummies were so rock hard that they couldn't be eaten. Bummer. Hubby ordered a ""Reese's Martini"" also priced at $16 and it was rimmed with peanut butter. I tried a couple drinks and thought it looked much better than it tasted. 

We ordered the ""Sugar Factory Fondue"" priced at $21.95 and was disappointed. You can choose white, milk or dark chocolate and we decided to go with the milk chocolate fondue. It came with gummy bears, homemade marshmallows, white chocolate bread, brownie bites, strawberries and bananas. The gummy bears were so hard like the banana gummies that we didn't bother with them. The homemade marshmallows and strawberries and bananas were actually good, but the bread and brownie bites were dry and bland. 

We sat near a window so the Bellagio water show made for a nice view.

Oh my goodness this was so good, I wish I would have ordered it too but I snuck in two bites before he wolfed it down.  It is a burger that is cooked to perfection and the differences of this burger compared to most other burgers are that it has munster cheese, crispy fried onions, their own spread, and the best part a white chocolate bun.  Which gave it just a hint of sweetness that was not overpowering but enhanced the burger.  In an attempt to be on the healthier side I order the Chinese chicken salad which was everything you would expect a Chinese chicken salad to taste like.  It was definitely a great choice.

However, the Sugar Factory will stay as a nice gimmick to let people see on the strip. I have had 3 visits here and I can truthfully conclude that it is not my favorite place to be.

1st- Just trying it out and had their pasta. It was overly cheesy and it left me feeling disappointed, but my friend enjoyed his French Dip. Frozen Chocolate however was delicious.

2nd- Bought their ""New Years Package"" to ring in 2012 and this time was probably the best time out of the bunch. The manager was handled all of the booking and payment answered every email I had with inquiries very diligently and I appreciated that. For about $175 per person we were able to dine window-side inside and had a fantastic view of the strip. Our table was beautifully decorated with many fun adornments for us to use when it came time for the fireworks and also a complimentary glass of champagne for celebration time. Our server that night, however, was NONEXISTENT! The only things he did was bring us our drinks and took our food order. The busser was who came out to give us our food. This completely pissed me off because gratuity was already added on to take care of him. Of course there were times where we wanted to order more, needed refills, or something else and he was either on his phone near the back of the room or nonexistent. The food was seriously lacking with tasteless angus steak and the best thing was the crabcakes. Nonetheless, when it came time for the fireworks, we went right on outside and counted down with everyone else on the strip.

3rd- We had a party of 8 and I attempted to get a table for us around 9 PM. Plenty of open seats and the rest of my party went to the ""treats"" section to look at everything since I had people visiting from out of town so this place intrigued them. I was told by the hostess to go round up my party again and we would be seated immediately. I rounded them up after they just started looking around only to be told it will take 5 minutes to seat us, but it ended up being about 10 minutes. I am not trying to be picky, but if you are going to tell me to do something then also follow up on your promise as well please. I was told from our server that they no longer had Frozen Hot Chocolate so I opted for the Cookies and Cream Shake which I honestly have to say was even better! 

Overall, if I can avoid going here again.. I would definitely avoid it. High prices for sucky food and desserts. Best things are their expensive shakes, lol.",E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw,3,1,2,a-A1qU-TOD4UfU97hWarXA

We basically went here because we tried the Groupon deal. But even with a 25 for 50 coupon, we ended up with an extra 30 dollars with tip to pay. And we didn't even have two entrees. The server made very sure that we would tip the full amount by circling clearly the tip chart and the total bill. Honestly the service wasn't that good.

First off, the ambiance is nice, but what I got a kick out of the most was there were workers outside flashing the menu, trying to get people to enter... lol... taking a cue from those non-english speaking ""stripper"" promoters eh?

Their menu is, for lack of a better way to put it... too expansive for its own good!  Haha, there were just so many choices, including desert, which they are famous for.

I ordered the Bacon Club Sandwhich, my friend the open faced tuna melt, another got a french dip, and another a burger.  We also split deep-fried macaroni.

The club was pretty good...nothing spectacular, as was the tuna melt.  The French Dip was pretty tender, and the burger pretty tasty... but nothng to go crazy over.  The Fried Macaroni appetizer was pretty good. Hot, fresh, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside.  However, $9 for 3 golf-ball sized clumps? Wow.  The fries (shoe string style) were cooked well, very crispy and tasty.

Their deserts are really good though.  My friend got the Nutella Cream Crepe... and it was so awesomely sweet, I went staight into 3rd stage Diabetes.  I wouldn't call it overly sweet, since it is called the Sugar factory afterall.

It is a really cute but expensive candy store attached to a lovely modern ""brasserie."" It is located in the front of Paris across from Bellagio and the Fountains of Bellagio. 

The decor is a bit too dark and black for me, especially in the daytime when I'm ordering from their 30+ breakfast-brunch items, but it's nice in a modern way -- and also a bit generic. 

Our server was really nice but very busy. It took a while to get refills on water and to get checked on when we needed to get extra condiments or whatever.

We ordered the chicken salad, the steak sandwich, hamburger and banana split waffle for lunch. 

The hamburger was okay. I like the bun, but the patty was underseasoned. The fries were really good, though. The steak sandwich is recommended and was pretty tasty. 

However, the banana split waffle was sub-par. For one thing, my waffle wasn't crispy, maybe it was a bit underdone or stale, because it was pretty rubbery. The toppings were delicious, though -- milk chocolate sauce with rice crisps, bananas, smooth vanilla ice cream (or was it gelato? I can't remember), and strawberries. Delicious; I just was disappointed by the waffle.

We also had the chocolate fondue for 2 people, which turned out to be more than enough for 5 people, although three of the people didn't eat that much of it. 

The fondue was delicious (we had chocolate and chose milk chocolate) with the following things to dip:

Bananas (yum)
Pound cake (terrible -- too dry, kept breaking up when you tried to skewer it)
House-made marshmallows 
Nut bread
Strawberries

All in all, I did have a  great lunch, but I was surprised at how expensive everything was. Yeesh. We'll come back for a treat the next time we're in town. Thanks.",UnzUYnYbZn5wbyZwQPID9w,1,0,4,ERbNgqhZt9Ti48_YZarv_g

Not only of the desserts (sugar) but, THE FOOD!!!

The menu is extensive and is, literally, a book. Kinda reminds me of the menu/book at Cheesecake Factory. YES; THAT much food!
Had the crepes with chicken, feta, and spinach. And nooooOOoo, I wasn't on a diet kick, I just like those ingredients.
Friend had the turkey club crepe; and another friend had the chicken and waffles.

The crepes were good but, after having tried the chicken and waffles; I wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish, I had gotten something more substantial like their pastas or their bigger entrees.

I know one of the chef's there so, he comped us our dessert(s). Plural =)
Had the banana split sundae and the...get this: ""everything chocolate pizza,"" which was dark choco syrup, chips, brownies....ughhhhh, it was delicious.

The service was spectacular. Our server was soooooo nice. And when he didn't bring my drink in a timely manner because he forgot; he bought my next drink. Amazing =)

BIG MISTAKE!  Due to a lack of happy hour, I left for the second time and went somewhere else.  I think this place is over priced and way too loud.

3698174,2012-12-19,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Ok. With an open mind (that means locals have to set aside their local criticism...) I think this place is fun. THIS PLACE IS GREAT FOR VEGAS VISITORS AND TOURISTS. Most people are looking for a fun experience and it could be in the most cliche way as possible. 

I think the main point here is the EXPERIENCE. The experience of an extensive dessert menu and the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vibe. It's super fun, and such a cute interior. They've got a nice bar inside the restaurant, and right next door is the Sugar Factory dessert and souvenier shop that you can look around in.

Ok so here's my food critique:

SALMON AND ASPARAGUS- Honestly, it SCREAMS over priced. You get 7 pieces of asparagus and a like a 1/3 slab of salmon for $25.00. The salmon was TOO salty, but I must admit that I did like that nice outter crisp that it had, and the tender inside. The asparagus was on point as well. It had a nice smokey flavor with bacon bits, and it was really crunchy. Seriously though, the price versus quality and portion was just plain (ROBBERY). 

If price isn't your main concern I'd still recommend you try it AT LEAST once for the experience. 

FRIED MAC AND CHEESE- that was actually a good appetizer and it was tasty. Of course it had the nice crispy outter breading with the soft cheesy mac and cheese interior. It comes with five pieces and pairs their special sauce. I'd recommend this for an appetizer. 

The best part here are the goblets. YOU COME FOR THE GOBLETS AND THE DESSERT. I think. The goblets are $36 for a 32 ounce drink (you don't keep the cup but for $15 more you can). 

We got the WHITE GUMMY GOBLET and the BLUE OCEAN GOBLET. The WHITE GUMMY GOBLET was very fruity and tart so if you liek that type of flavor I'd suggest that one, and it comes with fun creey crawly gummy worms inside! I ordered the BLUE OCEAN it has that very strong HYPNOTIQ taste to it (duh...janel because it has Hypnotiq inside) It's not too strong, and not too sweet. It also has fun swimming shark gummies in there (Careful! They bite!)

The fun part about that is, they pour your drink into the goblet when it reaches your table then a bunch of fog comes out of your goblet like a witches potion so you enjoy the thrill of others looking at your drink and saying ""oooo...ah...I want what they have..."" (because that's basically what you're buying.)

They also have small martini concotions as well and I'd grab that chance during happy hour where it's buy one get one on drinks. And...that's it!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,3,0,3,sO7tR2GHpgHP-Rh8RTq4xA

When we got there we did not get a warm welcome. We felt like we interrupted a conversation all the hostess' were having. A conversation that did not seem work related.

They asked us if we were going to have dinner. We said no, just dessert. Then they asked if we were going to order drinks. We said, no, just dessert. None of the servers wanted us because they felt like the bill will be too little for a large tip. The hostess said we could not sit at the dining table because we were going to just have dessert so they sat us in the bar area. 

It took 10 mins for someone to serve us. When someone finally came, we ordered a ""Birthday Confetti Cake"". Right when we got our dessert, we got the bill.

I tried to start off with positives, but I only came up with one. When you're in Sin City and your friends never sleep, you end up settling and that's exactly what we did. My two friends were starved because they hadn't had much to eat during the day, and so while they ordered appetizers, I opted for a dessert and had one of their novelty goblets. What we gathered was:

Crispy pork sliders ($10.95): 3 small sliders topped with coleslaw. Filling for what they were, but MEH!

Chicken fingers ($10.95): Oh, is this real chicken? This was actually thoroughly enjoyable for my friend. Glad the birthday boy was at least happy!

S'mores Crepe ($12.95 + $3 extra for ice cream): MEH! The crepe skin was soaked, the insides of the crepe was just marshmallow glop, and the ice cream was forgettably mediocre. Overly sweet, that's all I can say. I only had several bites before the server took it away.

Fried mac & cheese ($9.95): Edible. Next!

Lollipop passion goblet ($36): Cute presentation. When the server poured the drink over the ice in the goblet, it was like a mini-show at our table. I'm not sure if it tasted like the ""tropics"" as advertised, but it was pretty yummy. Most of it was ice and since the drink was weak, I didn't taste nor feel the alcohol. Make sure to take the lollipops before you start sipping.

The server who took our order was extremely curt. He wasn't patient, and he seemed to always be in a hurry even though they were only several tables occupied. My friends were trying to be friendly and even joked a little with him, but he made zero effort to return the favor. In the middle of our order, he would already be walking away. Luckily the rest of the staff we encountered were friendly...although some of them were complaining about having to work that night? The hostesses had the same attitude as the server. Eh, if I wasn't in such a good mood, I wouldn't have tipped them for such horrendous attitudes and meh food. 

I'm usually a sucker for cute concepts even if they're insanely overpriced, and I have a major sweet tooth. But Sugar Factory, for $93 (+ tip = $110), I won't return and I will not be recommending this place to friends.",MF2hyQHEu1Kzyb2IgcLuPg,3,2,2,jVKVzGleR_ZhYNlL-F1cXA

CONS: Their specialty drinks are a bit on the pricey side. The fishbowl sized drinks are $36, and the other sugar themed cocktails are $16. There is also a tax added on to your bill of 4.7%, not entirely sure why but it didn't make a huge difference to our bill.

If you are ok with super sweet, sugary drinks the bowls are definitely the way to go, plus they are potent!

We went there with a party of 3 last night and let me tell you that this place needs to close it's doors right away before they make somebody very ill.

The waiter was non-existent and completely useless in recommending entrees. He didn't even know what salad dressings the restaurant offered...I mean come on!

One ordered a meat pizza ($18), one ordered the burger ($18), and one the Jambalaya ($25). 

Food comes out and Jambalaya was like old dried fried rice with dried bits of chicken, one piece of shrimp with the shell on it and the benefit of having an entire shaker of salt emptied into it by the chef. The chef who by the way was earlier recommended by the waiter for having amazing Jambalaya because they came from New Zealand. WTF? New Zealand? Didn't know that Jambalaya had roots all the back to New Zealand LOL.

Needless to say, I sent it back and got the burger instead. The burger tasted like a rock hard bullet with gooey hot sliced tomatoes on it with the juices from it dripping everywhere - DISGUSTING!

I suppose this place does well because of the young Hollywood wannabe's and their 58 ounce alcoholic drinks for $36; by the time their food arrives they are too drunk to realize that they would have been better off eating a street hot dog wrapped in bacon down in good ol' Tijuana.

In finale, remember that the Sugar Factory is just that, a Sugar Factory - specializing in over-priced ice cream sandwiches and NOT food of any kind.

The drink tastes like a Midori Sour; it also comes with lollipops and a candy necklace. 

We also ordered some fries and fried mac n cheese! The fries were mediocre but the fried mac n cheese was really good!

3771259,2011-05-01,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I just went to the candy shop side of this place, so my review is only for that. 

A 24 hour candy shop in Vegas? Seriously, how did it take so long for this to happen? I have to admit, I do have a huge sweet tooth, so this was a great find for me.  We decided to try their candy bars which were good. My favorites were the S'mores, Dark Chocolate with Raspberry, and the White Chocolate with Key Lime.  The Pretzel and Chocolate was a nice combination as well. They were 5 for 10 bucks at the time, so I'm not sure how long that special is going on, but it's a good deal.

Besides the chocolate bars, they have bins with candy, cupcakes, brownies and a bunch of other sweets. 

There is a restaurant next to it, that has some really good looking food, so maybe my next trip will include a stop there.

The workers there are super friendly and really nice offering to help you find the treat that will help meet your sweet craving.

It's under new ownership. Half of the things on the menu that used to be there are GONE! The things remaining are changed and they are BAD.

I had baked macaroni and cheese (cause I am really a 10 year old trapped in a 40 year old) and it was gooey and creamy and cheesy last time. What I had tonight was not something I'd bother to fight traffic on the strip for.  And hey throwing stale Ritz crackers on top of microwaved Mac and cheese isn't fooling me into thinking its baked! Disgusting.

My handsome partner in crime had sliders and the buns were burnt and he had pork sliders(??) anyway they deep fry those and include sauerkraut inside them. More disgustingness.  He couldn't stomach the deep fried bun, I tried it, it's like a bland flavorless donut. 

Basically this place has diner food with swanky food prices. $18 for a pizza. $22 for meatloaf. $18.00 for a burger. $17.00 for Mac and cheese.  Dessert ranges from $10.00 to $50.00.  

The service was not terrific. The bill comes with the math for you.  We left 20% because its Christmas time otherwise we'd have left 10%. And it was an empty Monday night...

My advice is, if you've been here before treasure your memories don't go back. If you are thinking about coming here for a first time, keep on thinking and move along!

Arrived and had to wait a couple minutes which was fine, the hostess asked if we'd prefer a booth or a table and we asked for a booth only to be seated at a table???....when we informed the seating hostess she just gave us a blank stare and we just took the table. Our server was very friendly and nice we started with drinks first, 2 bloody marys and a gigantic fishbowl white gummi bear drink complete with dry ice and gummi worms. The bloody marys were really good and the white gummi was decent,  for $36.00 its just a one time thing to try though.  We skipped on appetizers and ordered lunch one steak sandwich, chicken strips, roast beef dip, and a patty melt. While waiting ordered a blow pop martini, the hubba bubba martini, cinnamon toast crunch martini and a grape drink thing. the blow pop was my favorite but I had to sip water because it was soooo sweet as was the hubba bubba. The cinnamon toast was like an eggnog drink and the grape was eh. Service started to slow but I could see our server was dealing with alot of tables so it was fine and food didn't take too long. After trying the food I probably would only return to have drinks honestly or visit the candy store, for the prices I expected decent food but everything was blah. My patty melt the beef  looked like those burger patties you buy frozen from the store and looks like a hockey puck just weird. The fries were probably the worst I've ever had...boring and just exploding with grease, I love all fries and these were horrible. The steak sandwich was bland also, my husband added salt but it was a let down, which is funny since my sister said her chicken strips were super salty. Really disappointed with the food so we skipped dessert. Received the check $200.00 for 4 guests but on the check noticed a  $7 cnf charge which I've never seen before, apparently instead of raising prices on the menu the owners charge this extra fee.

3832978,2011-07-29,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"The Sugar Factory is a rather confusing place to visit late at night.  The hostess led us through an intricately decorated, lightly attended nightclub of sorts, but after a few turns we wound up at a service counter in a store packed with teenagers.  What is going on here?  While the nightclub was sedate, this store was almost riotous with bored youth standing around stoically not doing much of anything, not even buying anything.  

We surmised that there was really no line at all, and put in our order for some ice cream.  I kept it pretty simple opting for a ""small"" cup of straciatella; I was just here accommodating my girlfriend's craving for some ice cream.  We quickly left the store and had a seat in the nightclub area.  I guess there they have a menu where you can order elaborate ice cream dishes at $16 a pop and enjoy them in sleek club chairs in dimly lit rooms.  Meh.  I was happy to have the same ambiance with my $5 takeaway cup.  

The ice cream was creamy and very sweet, perhaps too sweet.  They fill up the small cup beyond overflowing, so you might be forgiven for thinking that you ordered a large by mistake.  Overall, the ice cream was good and worth having.  I especially liked the rich selection of choices too.  Another thing they have going for them is that there are really no other ice cream places open late at night nearby, so they sort of have the monopoly.  The clear downside is that it becomes a de facto hangout for the underage crowd which doesn't pair very well with the nearby go-go dancers, gambling, and open drunkenness.",xTGpw0x5EUj11YFhwr6m2A,4,3,3,Ev9b51U6tqrNcyRikpp-XQ

Indoors is darker, with chandeliers and tin-mirrored ceilings in a large room. The music can get loud, as it's pitched to be heard above the diners' conversation din. Marble tables and small cafe-style chairs.

Wait service is slow, sloppy, and not particularly warm. (One server was downright rude; the other was ""slick"" and glib, but very obviously upselling to increase the tab total.) The best service comes from the unnamed busboys, drink refillers, runners, etc.

The magic that keeps the restaurant busy is that it's 24-hours, with a broad menu. It also gets a big boost from the many celebrity endorsements. (Though the thumbs-up are for dessert, not food!) 

Club sandwich was very good -- nice touches like herb mayo and three choices of bread to show they care. The mussels are huge, but blandly seasoned. 

Desserts are the real draw, of course. (2/3 of the breakfast items were really just dessert, like red velvet pancakes, apple pie waffles, nutella pancakes, etc.) The rocky road muffin was stale and not nearly as sweet as expected. The munchie waffle was even more unappealing -- piling on four different kinds of sugar/syrups didn't help.

Helpful tip: appetizer mussels are the same size as entree mussels, but without the french fries. So, they're charge $8 extra for mediocre fries! Better to steal off your friend's plate. :)",--WLHsm-AC4jcol2gOkmCQ,2,0,1,1RQCIp14cx1mWVDTlpLRBg

I had looked over the menu online before going, but I still looked again and was torn among three or so items.  I ordered the chocolate French toast which the menu described as dark chocolate stuffed brioche, strawberries, and chocolate syrup.  My server, Mariela, asked if I wanted maple syrup or chocolate syrup.  Hell, in for a penny in for a pound--I'll take the chocolate syrup.  She then asked, dark, light, or white chocolate.  I went with the dark.

The breakfast was not long in coming but it was long enough that I could enjoy watching the tourists think sitting on the patio was OK for this cold morning.  I also watched as the fountains at the Bellagio just shot upwards steadily for about 2 minutes.  The crew were out there doing maintenance.

The French toast was delightful.  It was a small portion, but for something this rich, that's exactly what you want!  I found myself breaking a small piece of brioche off and dipping the bread into the chocolate sauce.  Dessert for breakfast!  That's the way to go!

Service was OK but it could have been better.  It wasn't until I was done with my French toast that I was asked about more coffee.  Considering how few people there were this morning, Mariela should have checked back with me long before this to see how things were and offer more coffee sooner.  Still, I rate the breakfast 4 stars because it was great tasting, the people watching was good, and it was a good choice to go here.

Then we tried the onion soup which wasn't that great. It had a layer of cheese on top of the soup and I had to take it off because that's was just way too much cheese. The soup was very rich and strong, but it wasn't as good as the one I had in West LA.

The mac and cheese lolipop was very creative and I did enjoy it. It came with a side of marinara sauce. My bf really enjoyed this one and I really like the concept of it as well.

I ordered some chicken fingers which were yummy!!  The prices here are definitely reasonable. Lots of different food options which is great.  Love the way it's laid out...you can even sit on the patio outside which overlooks the strip (right across the street is the Bellagio, so great fountain shows)  

The candy store portion is wonderful as well...yeah you might spend $8 on a milkshake, but it really is worth it! Delicious!! I actually order mine rather plain because a lof of their shakes have a lots of glitz and glam and I'm not the biggest on uber sweet things.  They have lots of gelato flavors too!  A great place!

My only complaint was the lame CNF tax they added to the bill, on top of sales tax. I've never seen this before in my life. I asked the server what the CNF tax was and she said it's an extra tax added to checks to help pay the Sugar Factory's rent. What a ridiculous concept. Hey Sugar Factory, if you can't afford to pay your rent, perhaps you should not be in business on the strip. At least include your absurd CNF tax in the price of the drinks, instead of surprising customers when they receive the bill. That way patrons will know what they are getting into prior to entering your establishment. Also, most reputable establishments put disclaimers on their menu regarding extra charges and whatnot.

my gf's pasta was too salty, and the pasta itself was dry and stiff. my steak salad was over dressed, though, the steak itself wasn't too bad. 

I think that if you stuck to a few things on the menu like the steak or the burger, you might do okay, but really, for the price, you can find a much nicer experience. a bit of a disappointment after the other meals I had in LV.

Bigger fan especially since this is the only place that was open past midnight on a Sunday evening.  In Vegas, I found this slightly alarming, but after a stiff night of walking around, dessert came calling.

Sugar Factory is a restaurant/dessert bar that is open 24 hours so it was perfect that we were looking for something sweet and caffeinated.  I ordered a coffee and the Turtle sundae.  A plated affair of coffee ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce, pecans, and brownie bites.

Our waiter was very nice and quite attentive, given it was past 1 a.m. and watching the people that frequent the strip around this time of the morning makes for an interesting observation.

Still, I decided that I wasn't going to spend too much here, and I settled on a creme brulee and raspberry crepe since it had a slight not-pure-dessert thing going. It was quite nice. I wasn't that impressed by the flat-seeming crepe with all the goodies layered on top, and indeed it did little more than soak up stuff and hold some sort of subtly flavored filling that I suppose is the creme brulee filling. However, I really enjoyed the raspberry sorbet on top, and I was presently the honey that surprisingly adorned the crepe. The only other nit I have to pick is that my last bite of sorbet was a little bit icy.

... and that would have been around 4 stars had I not re-read the menu afterward. The menu said that this crepe white chocolate covered almonds. Where the heck were the almonds on my dish? I couldn't even find sliced almonds or almond flavor. Did I somehow indicate that I have an almond allergy, and if so, why the heck didn't I get some sort of substitute or mention on my receipt?

-Monte Cristo- This was my choice and it was really small as compared to all the other dishes on the table. However, it did taste really yummy and I really enjoyed the sweet tomato relish. I would order this again but I just wish it wasn't minature.

*Every dish except for the pizza had a plentiful amount of french fries*

Fast service in the beginning but slow service in the end. Our dessert took forever and we ordered the Chocolate Fondue for 2. I kept inquiring as to what the heck was going on and the waitress kept saying that the chocolate takes time to melt, hmm.....

Well, finally the dessert came and just to let you know even though we were a party of 4 the Fondue for 2 was enough for us. You can save money that way- You get brownie bites,gummy bears,bananas, strawberries,pound cake, marshmallows and bread. It was fun and messy!!!! Everything was good except for the pound cake- Sara Lee Pound cake from your local supermarket tastes way better than theirs...I informed the waitress of the yucky pound cake and she said it's because they freeze the pound cake but if you don't like any of the options you can double on the ones that you do enjoy like double marmallows instead of the pound cake option. So I thought that was good info to know......

1. specialty drinks were $16 each.  We're not opposed to paying more for drinks that are exceptional and potent.  As a matter of fact we will certainly return to the Cosmopolitan to have drinks - they are expensive, creative, very tasty, and quite  potent.  Here - not so much.  I had a pineapple martini.  It was quite weak.

2. service - we ordered our drinks - it took over 10 minutes to get them.  I clearly looked perturbed, the servers response ""I'm really busy.""  Apparently not busy getting our drinks.

3. CNF fee on the bill.  An additional 3.5% to the tab.  I asked the server what it was.  Her reply ""it's a franchise fee, I'm just the messenger.""  Actually it's not a franchise fee, and you're not really just the messenger.  You're the one I'll be tipping.  Sorry.

4. the cookies suck - we each got a cookie in the candy store.  Snickerdoodle and S'mores - they were both very dry, smaller, and lacked taste.  

So - for 2 weak drinks + tip + tax + fee = $40.  yep I know - my bad!  Last time we'll be going there.  I'm not looking for walmart prices on the strip - but we don't feel like getting hosed with lousy, overpriced, poor products and services.

4242959,2012-06-03,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I think the Sugar Factory is a fairly recent addition to the Paris casino, because I don't remember seeing it on my last visit 2 years ago.  It's on the front corner of the casino, near the fake Arc de Triomphe, and is split into two parts (three if you count the outdoor seating).  We walked through the candy shop part, but didn't spend any time there as our goal was to find out if there was a chance of fulfilling one of my long-term Vegas goals: Strip-side dining.  Usually I visit in winter when, even in Vegas, it's too cold to eat outside after dark.  And at warmer times, it's too crowded to get a table.  But at 11pm on a warm Saturday evening in May, we found success!

The menu is huge, reminiscent of The Cheesecake Factory, and with about the same level of healthful choices (or lack thereof).  We were pretty much just after dessert and a nightcap, so the sister ordered the Swedish Fish - one of her all-time favorite candies - and I had a spiked rootbeer float.  We shared one of the sweet pizzas which came with a caramel type sauce, nuts, and whipped cream.  I didn't care for my drink, as the root beer was far too bitter.  I'm not a huge fan of root beer to start with, so it's mostly my fault for making a bad choice.  The pizza was pretty good and very sweet.  Given the sugar content of the drinks, we probably could have done without.  But my sister's drink was fantastic.  She loved it, and I - not a fan of the candy - wished I had ordered one as well.

Service was fine - not overly attentive but not ignoring us either.  The view of the Strip was fantastic, and we saw the Bellagio fountain show across the street go off several times.  The trees blocked the lower part of the view and the restaurant's music drowned out the fountain music, but we could clearly see and hear the big water blasts go off.  Very cool.

I wouldn't go out of my way to stop here again, and the prices are what you would expect for a casino mid-Strip, but we had a good time and it was a great way to cap off our evening.",Xsuv6bKcPUVDWih0DtEBbA,2,3,4,VgZEZNMcjuG6GmDP9wBhng

I used to share a goblet and would already start to feel a buzz. This time however I had one pretty much to myself and at the end it felt like I was drinking koolaid... 

The near $40 price tag for a goblet used to be justified because they would use like 4 different top shelf liquors but now... either they are only using a few drops or watering it down.

Not to mention that they jam pack the glass to the top with ice. So you are probably only paying for a tiny baby cup of alcohol.",A-hccTjf_oZOXsPFRCirmQ,4,0,1,LUD3K8nhhL66HiH24tpEpw

The food was ok. We split the white gummy goblet, which was really sweet. It was a cool concept, but I'm not sure whether it was worth the $30-something. I had the Sugar Factory burger, which was different. According to the waiter, it is served on a Hawaiian roll bun that has white chocolate in its ingredients.

The service was horrible, which is why I took off two stars. First, I'm not sure our server grasped the concept of better service tends to mean better tips. We just asked for an extra plate and ketchup. After ten minutes, I got some ketchup from the bar. He never refilled our water cups even though we asked him to. 

Verdict: Don't come here expecting good service - plan for some extra time between this meal and your next stop. It's an interesting experience. Worst case, you can always grab a ""quick"" drink.",OIcK6jAubaSkt5HciU_5xA,1,0,3,W2fB-rSBJ0MgAlx8xq58FQ

The menu had a lot of interesting options, but I went with the Grilled Prime Steak sandwich.  It was one of the better steak sandwiches I have ever had.  The meat tasted very high quality.  I also loved all of the toppings that came on it, especially the onions and peppers.  My mouth still salivates thinking about it!

The fries that came with the sandwich were not that memorable.  However, my wife and I order a side of fried macaroni and cheese to share.  It was fantastic, and I could have easy ate two more orders of it.

The final part of my meal was the Rootbeer Float that I ordered from the cocktail menu.  It was an alcoholic drink containing vodka and with a root beer flavor.  I loved it!  What made it even better was the root beer gummies that were included on top.  I am a huge fan of root beer and gummy candies, so it made for a superb combination.

Sugar Factory was a great choice for lunch!  I can't believe that I had been to the candy store so many times without trying the restaurant.  I'm glad that I finally did.  I was not disappointed!",YWWDhFvemd93HKof8D-QoA,4,5,4,ecxqFfkQGk1TPGF0NI0oRQ

She was not dressed as the servers nor as the hostess staff...no name tag, so perhaps she was the manager. She asked for drink order first thing. My wife asked for a glass of iced water. Sorry, we serve no glasses of iced water here, only $2 bottle water. When my wife said, thats ok, I dont need a drink, this woman just stared at her. I let her know that if they cant bring a glass of water to the table, Im also fine without.

Lots of empty tables.  We sat on the patio which was perfect for people watching on the strip.  I mean where else do you get dinner and a show like the drunkards and entertainment of people walking down the strip?!

The food was good enough.  Not the best i've ever had in vegas but still quite tasty.  I started with the mac and cheese pops which were my favortie part of my meal.  They are served in almost a tomato bisque sauce that was very tasty.  It seemed like they were in more of a corn dog wrapper rather than usual bread crumb style of other fried mac and cheese i've had.  Quite tasty.  Then we had a peanut butter frozen hot chocolate, which was had chunks of ice that were a little too big.  Kinda ruined the flavor, which was a little peanut butter heavy and not enough chocolate for my taste.  Then we finished off with a rattatoullie crepe which was also decent.  I was a little too full to order dessert but will be back for sure to do so.  I saw some other peoples sugary temptations at the tables next to us.  MMMMMMM.

My grievance was that the table was a little too small, and the dishes came out to quick for us to quite finish them comfortably.  But friendly enough staff, and got off cheaply enough with three things for twenty bucks split between my and a friend.

Once again the decor is much more pleasant to stare in awe at than the actual food! It looks like you're in a glamorous room this time instead of a kid's play room like in Serendipity. My girls and I came here for our last meal in Vegas. Wasn't too hungry so we got the 2 appetizers and a main dish: Ahi Tuna Sliders, Mac & Cheese Balls, and the BLT Sandwich. 

The sliders were alright. The ahi tuna was not the greatest because it wasn't entirely fresh. The sliders were also super DINKY! 3 sliders for $20? rip off..... It sort of lacked a certain taste I was looking for. Almost too savory! 

The Mac & Cheese Balls were okay. Clever! Fried balls with mac & cheese in the middle? Once again it was like 3 balls for like $15. 

The sandwich was pretty good! Took a bite out of it and it was HUGE! Almost too hard to bite into. The fries were addicting! But then again you can't really mess up on fries. 

Their fancy goblet drinks are what makes this place known. If I had a bigger appetite that day, I probably would've opted for an actual meal with a drink! Like Serendipity 3, I think I even saw some frozen drinks!

When there are so many negative reviews on the service that's a red flag I don't usually ignore.  My husband and I came in for lunch early afternoon and they had three hostesses and one other guy-manager maybe?- and the welcome was meh, and the young girl who sat us didn't seem to want to be there.  Plus, when you have a restaurant that's not even a 1/4 full why would you sit people right next to another table? Twenty-five other tables to choose from, even one over from an already seated one would be nice.  She just seemed to not care.  The waiter came and had the exact same attitude as the hostess.  If I'm paying $16 for a burger I expect excellent service. Long story short-he sucked, couldn't have been less apathetic and the managers need to read these reviews and talk to their staff. It seems to be the running theme.  The food was pretty good but not good enough to overshadow the service. Or lack there of. Not going back.",Rbaq5sFuUGJliVCu1m1JsQ,1,0,2,U9gYDtcXTpTYCQVcwvSA7A

If you're walking the Las Vegas strip in the morning, basking in the afterglow of a night of fun partying, come here for a non-traditional breakfast.  Located right next to the Paris hotel, the Sugar Factory is a candy shop, bakery, and little restaurant/café all in one.

Julius & I walked in out of curiosity, when a huge Reese's Peanut Butter Cupcake stopped me dead in my tracks.  So we headed to the bar, where I enjoyed breakfast consisting of selections from my 2 major food groups (alcohol and dessert lol.)  I had a Pommery Pop Mimosa (a cute split bottle of top of the line champagne with OJ) and the Reese's cupcake I was coveting.  Unfortunately, despite the little chunk of Reese's and crushed Reese's Pieces adorning the huge swirl of frosting, the cupcake was a little bland, dry, and did not taste like a Reese's at all.  Julius (who had just a beer) liked the subtleness of the flavor though.  Not me -if you're called Sugar Factory, give me bouncing off the walls sugar!  I think I just ordered a mediocre cupcake, while the woman next to me devoured her Red Velvet.  So based on this one dish alone, I dock Sugar Factory a couple stars.

Clearly expensive since it's right on the strip.  But in a place like this with so many other restaurants serving GREAT food, this just isn't right.

Service was acceptable, the place was clean, etc.  But again, you can do a lot better within easy walking distance.  I wish we'd have just done Hard Rock or something instead for this meal.

The Bloody Mary was fantastic--they make their own spicy infused vodka (but then used a generic BM mix??) and while it tasted fantastic, they were super stingey on the alcohol. Zero buzz achieved (and I'm a lightweight).

Their coffee is AMAZING. So amazing we asked what brand they use because we wanted to buy some. No one knew. So that was a bummer.

I came here with my friend for a girl's lunch during the middle of the week. It's late autumn, so of course it's chilly, but the sun was peeking out. We sat outside to enjoy the awesome people watching from the patio.

The first thing I noticed was  the tiny, itty bitty, little outdoor tables. Yes, It was a disaster waiting to happen!  More about that later...

Our server Kevin, was really  fun, a bit snarky, and he made us laugh quite often. One of the food runners (a female) walked around with a scowl on her face like she hated her job more than life itself, but overall everyone was quite pleasant and affable.

We decided to share all of our food items, and we started off with the broccolini appetizer. It was delicious and cooked exquisitely, but the sauce was a bit cloying with its sweetness. Next, we had the Asian Chicken Salad and a BBQ Chicken Pizza. These items were right on, but the pizza needed more bbq sauce, which the was presented to me ice cold :(. For beverages we had the unsweetened tropical iced tea.

With all of the dishes on the tiny little table it happened: CRASH!!

My plate went flying out onto Las Vegas Blvd and i pelted an unsuspecting stranger with a mandarin orange upside the head. Oops!

I TOLD YOU THE TABLES WERE TOO SMALL!

Kevin teased that I hadn't even been drinking, and everyone  was really nice about helping to clean up the mess and bring me new dishes. A  nice  gentleman on the Strip  even walked by and picked up my fork and handed it to me as well. My bad!

Anyway, we didn't try any of the deserts or candy, but I am in love with the fact that they have a Jelly Belly vending machine in the attached candy shoppe. As a card carrying member of the Jelly Belly fan club this detail is not lost on me.

Of course the prices were a bit lofty, but it's high dollar real estate in a tourist trap, so what do you expect? Thank goodness for Groupon to make things more accessible!

I will definitely be back, and I want to sit in Kevin's section again. This time, I promise not to break anything!",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,1,1,4,T7x8jVDyNf2oU7bzRfA0QA

3.7. A four star would be quite an overstatement. 

The sugar factory is well, a sugar-coated bling-aroo located at the Paris Hotel and Casino. Think Kardashian and glam celebrity life, definitely different from the usual places I hang out at. Anywho, my girlfriends and I wanted to try something different for a birthday celebration. 

We landed a good window spot indoor that overlooked the strip. 

Order consisted of:
- The Sugar Factory club sandwich and fries
- Half chicken/shrimp pizza with mozzarella cheese and artichoke
- The red velvet sundae

Overall, we liked the food. Although the club sandwich and pizzas were nothing more than ordinary, the red velvet sundae was a hit. Abundant and bursting with flavor, we were three impressed girls and yet, we were still unable to finish it. 

What we didn't find so impressive was the service. Waiters seemed a little lethargic and when I asked about special birthday treats, the hostess told me that they could add in candle sparklers to our red velvet sundae for the celebrant. But when the dessert arrived, the server had but one small candle on it, lit it up and shoved it on our table. My other friend and I raised our eyebrows a little and continued on to sing anyway. Other people joined in and we forgot about the candle sparkler promise. 

Also, pricing put a hole in our wallets. Only come here if you've got money to burn. I'm probably not going here any time soon - and temporarily disabled to visit other restaurants too for that matter.",QJMOgjRYeogK43kyfX6PKw,3,1,3,hUuNVuenx_hGvAcrCJ3pxg

4666531,2014-05-27,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"After spending a long holiday weekend in Vegas for our first time we tried numerous restaurants while there.  We only had one bad experience the entire trip and it was at the Sugar Factory.  While walking by from the strip we noticed there were several empty tables outside where people were relaxing and watching the strip and people going by.  We were staying at the Paris and had already tried the other places so the Sugar Factory was a perfect next choice.

So we go up and ask how long for our party of four and were first asked if we planned to order food, which we were starving and happily agreed.  This was a bit odd, but I guess they have many people wanting to sit outside just to relax on the strip.  OK so we were escorted out to the outdoor area and were left standing near the empty uncleaned tables.  We were told to remain there and the hostess would find a busser to clean a table.

So after 10 minutes we start to hear waiters going by complaining that we are standing there and that they don't have anyone to bus tables.  My wife goes to ask about what's going on and she was told rudely they can't help us as they have no one to bus tables.  So we continue waiting where we were told to wait. 

After a while at this point I go to ask a waiter nearby if they can ask about our table and the person made it very obvious that we were bothering him and he didn't want to help.  He basically storms off to the manager with me following.  He says something which I assume is he can't bus the table and then angrily leaves us. 

By now my wife was fed up and left.  So I explained to the manager what happened with their horrible service and we left.  

We continued down the strip a bit, found Gordon Ramsay's Burgr restaurant who happily sat us nearly immediately and we enjoyed our best meal in Vegas with nice friendly staff and excellent service.  So lesson learned avoid this place like the plague, who wants to deal with horrible service and drama like this on vacation?  Sugar Factory needs to clean house on their staff (starting from the top).

As we walked, there it was, a magical place filled with candy, chocolate, sweets and ice cream!  insulin party...here i come!

We first got greeted by the pastry case filled with beautifully decorated cakes, cupcakes, and pastries.  Then we skimmed through the merchandise, accessories, and colorful candies!

Banana Split Sundae- caramelized bananas, strawberry, chocolate and vanilla ice cream, chunky strawberry preserves, candied pineapple sauce, chocolate malt balls, caramel sauce, walnut, whipped cream, pure melted chocolate, powdered sugar and a ""cherry on top""

Raspberry Lemon Brulee Pizza- raspberry cream cheese sauce, lemon custard, red velvet cake chunks, fresh raspberries, melted white chocolate.

Lemon Meringue Tart- candied pistachio nuts, raspberry sorbet

Warm Chocolate Lave Cake- lemon cream, cinnamon chips, coffee syrup

Everything was exceptional, minus the chocolate cake.  It tries to be too fancy pants and fails at it.  The rest of the desserts were delicious!  My favorite had to be the Lemon Meringue Tart!

4696662,2014-05-02,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"First: the CNF charge on the bill, aka ""Concession & Franchise Fee"" which we couldn't seem to get a straight answer about what exactly we were paying for... appeared to be a 3.5% charged on the bill (which, for our large party was a substantial surprise), and is supposedly related to fees charged to venues by the casinos they're attached to, sort of a surcharge for a restaurant having a prime location. According to my research (and thank you Anthony Curtis), there are very few places in Vegas that do this, and Sugar Factory was one of, if not THE, first to do this. This fee was not disclosed to us and I did not even notice it on the bill until another person pointed it out. 

The waiter, who provided fair service, could not explain it to us so he asked an associate to try to explain. She couldn't explain it either so we asked for a manager. A very nonchalant 'manager' (at least I think he was a manager, as he didn't introduce himself or formally state his position) said the disclaimer didn't make it onto their new menus. He said the tax was 4.75% (huh? 3.5%, 4.75% which is it?) added on separately so they wouldn't have to raise the prices of their dishes. And that it was ""normal"" because Cabo Wabo down the street charges it too. Did we ask about Cabo Wabo? Is there value in what we're paying for? No and no. 

We asked if there was anything he could do for us, as this started as a happy family gathering but at the end of the dinner we all sat around talking about this BS fee and feeling very dissatisfied. He did not care about our level of dissatisfaction, would not credit anything, not even give us a coupon for a future visit, or a free dessert (which I can see why, as their sundae is $49.95).

Sugar Factory at Paris, we hope you're listening to your customers, because not only have you made a party of 8 unhappy customers, each of us and ALL of our social media connections are hearing us too. Trip Advisor, Twitter, Facebook...

All you had to do was make us happy customers when we were there. Why is that so hard for you to do?

Second: the lighting kept going from blinding-bright, to dark-are-we-having-a-blackout.

Third: the food? I don't even remember. We were so upset about the customer service. Oh yes, they brought with our bill a little dish of complimentary yogurt covered mini pretzels: 4... for a party of 8.",Z1g3_X8wTyTsRsTuEDv2qA,16,2,1,Zbee69iE0eQzoVLoXX8VtA

Came here on a Saturday evening for dinner. The hostess I came up to decided she was going to ignore us and didnt make any eye contact at all. Now I have been to nice restaurants all over the world, so I can tell when people are being rude or not. As with rude help, wait staff, and sales people, it's a case of ""noblesse oblige,"" and you just have to excuse them. The other hostess caught this behavior and quickly greeted my friend and I. Told us that the wait will be 10 mins and she will be texting me when our table is ready. 

30 minutes have gone by, I finally received a text. Went to the rude hostess again to give her a chance to redeem herself. Again I was ignored, the hostess that helped us, once again, intervened. We were seated promptly. From this point on, it went very smoothly in terms of service. Our waiter was very obliging when I had to change my drink order. I had their root beer drink with an added liquid nitrogen for an additional cost. The drink was 20$ and was a total downer. It did not taste good. If you like milky medication taste then this drink is for you. But for me, it was just disgusting. I barely touched it. I had the chicken and waffles for my entree. Sorry to say it was pretty abysmal also. It was not flavorful but the chicken was very hard. It gave my jaw a workout. My friend and I decided not to finish our entrees as we both had the chicken and waffles.

This one is way bigger and serves food and desserts (although I didnt get why anyone orders food in here)!!! Its a dessert place- let them do what they do best!! Eat before you get there!! Lol!! I asked the waitress why they even have food on the menu and if she gets to throw people out when they order food or salad in there - she laughed. They had everything on the menu- sweet crepes ( I got the s'more crepe), frozen hot chocolate ( I got the peanut butter), and we also got the chocolate pizza. The crepe and pizza were amazing, The pizza was very rich- a MUST for chocolate lovers. The crepe had marshmallows, graham crackers and fudge inside and out of it. The chocolate pizza had brownie pieces, chocolate chunks, hot fudge,etc. The Pb froz hot choc was ok. It wasnt nearly as sweet as it should have been. Also- their fresh whipped cream isnt sweet. Kept bugging me because I wanted it to be. I guess its to cut the sweetness in the other foods. 
The service was great. We didnt even wait for a table. It was lunch time during the week. Service was great. Everyone was very nice. Prices were reasonable and we got to sit outside with a full view of the Bellagio fountains.
After we ate, we shopped in the huge gift shop. I got a cute SF t shirt. Prices for gift shop are $$$. Cute though. $24-30 for T shirts, $40 for hoodies (real cute too) and they had other accessories and loose candy they sold by the pound. They also had gelato. Beautiful location, We are def going back there b4 we leave Vegas because at night starting at 5pm they open the chocolate lounge and you can get chocolate fondue at your table ($26) with whatever you want to dip in it. Cant wait for that! I saw the celeb couture lollypop things but they didnt interest me. Took lots of pics in this location. Cant wait to go back!",rhBT5AQi8LPTc3Mk2Qpxpw,1,1,5,9tu4dgFpurysR2pWwEsalA

For lunch we had the Ham and Brie served with fries and Fried Mac and Cheese to start. The Fried Mac was to die for!

We asked for check and left the restaurant but before leaving we talked to the manager who 1st didn't apologize , 2nd : he denied that the Waiter talked to him about our table and said "" this wasn't the case even though we saw him talking to our waiter and that the Benedict was taken off the bill 3rd he doesn't deserve to be a manager in such an industry as he has no sense of hospitality , problem ownership and guest recovery.

I didn't think we'd be that satisfied with our meal but my Chicken & Waffles ($20) was pretty damn good!  I can't decide whether or not it's better than Little Farmerbrown's Skillet in SF but the chicken was crispy & the meat was moist.  The waffle could have been crispier though.  The portion was huge, good thing I'm a sharer!  He got the Steak Frites ($23).  It wasn't as good as at a legit French restaurant but wasn't bad at all.  For dessert we got the Red Velvet Sundae ($13) which was huge!  Though it did have a lot of whip cream (which I ate around) it came with many scoops of vanilla ice cream, mini chocolate balls, chunks of moist red velvet cake, raspberries, & warm fudge.  OMG it was so good, but definetely hard to choose between the wide assortment of sundaes & desserts!  

Loved the food, decor, even the store, the only thing that could be improved is the service.  Our waiter pretty much ignored us most of the time after we placed our order until we were done with our entrees when he asked us if we'd like dessert.  Both the outside hostess and one of the ones inside though I told them my name and reservation details still didn't check me in on Opentable!

4755044,2014-06-20,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I heard a lot of hype about this burger so I bought the groupon to share with my good friend when we came out to Vegas to celebrate my birthday.

The location is cute. I liked it immediately. Since it's named Sugar Factory, it has lots of sugary/candy like items on the menu which will satisfy any sweet tooth. Service is quick and professional. We were seated immediately even though it appeared to be busy and even got a booth with a nice view of the strip and the fountains. Very pleasant for lunch. 

For lunch, we both decided on the signature burger and even though the drinks looked and sounded good, we passed on those because of their high sugar content. I love sugar but don't like anything overly sweet. The signature burger is pretty standard except it comes on a white chocolate bun with breaded onion strings and American cheese. I had high expectations and didn't make any substitutions even though I really wanted to switch out the cheese. Who puts American cheese on a burger? McDonalds?

Much to my dismay, the burger was just OK. Fries were good but the burger didn't really impress. The bun was sweet but I couldn't really taste the white chocolate and it didn't really make or break the burger. 

Since we had to use up the whole value of the groupon, we decided to split a dessert to make up for what was left and opted on the adult milk and cookies. The ""milk"" was actually a liqueur and the cookies, sadly, weren't all that great. Once again, another let down. 

Overall, service is really good and this is a fun place to hang out. I would maybe come here for a drink, something that isn't sugary and maybe another menu item.",VjzK7jhmyC5KManY_z-x0g,3,1,3,OlZbcxSVITNgBiqn8futeQ

The first time I went there was with a group. We had just saw Janet Jackson at Caesar's Palace and were hungry after, so we decided to check this place out. It was fairly new at the time. We got there and were seated in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was a little.. ehhh a lot slow. She expressed her feelings to us as she had several tables. We then found out the Janet's nephew was coming and all the waiters were freaking out; especially her because she told us so. which we told her if she planned on working at a restaurant on the strip, she needs to get used to waiting on famous, or somewhat famous people  We had to ask for the same condiment 3 times before it was brought out as well as refills for our water. I swear she forgot about our goblet drink, we didn't get it until after we asked for it, again. after our meal, We spoke to the manager. He exclaimed she was new and was still in training. But yet she had several tables to wait on. Uh, something is not right. Then he went on talking about him and his wife eating there and how they had good service. Of course you did, you're the manager!The food was alright. a bit pricey if you ask me. I paid $11 for 3 tiny mac and cheese balls. The goblet drink was really good though. There was dry ice at the bottom, so it looked much like a goblet.

Another time I came here was for a friends dinner. We had slow service too. Kourtney Kardashian was there that night with Scott and some other people. I ordered chicken fingers and french fries which were a bit dry. The chicken and fries were two separate orders. I don't know why. The fries were good though. Then the waiter went to take my basket, even though I was not done. 

The third time I came here was at 4 in the morning with some people my friends and I met while at Jet Nightclub (RIP). The service was actually good. Maybe cause we were the only ones in there? Three orders of Belgium waffles were sent back because they were too dry. I stuck to chicken fingers. The chef sent out an order of chicken fingers made of dark meat while we waited for their other order. They actually like the dark meat better than the regular chicken fingers. 

I don't plan on spending another dime or any of my time there in the future. They have bad service and dry, overpriced food. No, thank you.",2MtL65B0hy5L41TFBRIdYg,1,0,1,farjY59-bhhcmWUsME6cKA
4789749,2013-01-09,3,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I really didn't want to like this place because I really don't care for The kardashians.  We were staying at the Paris Hotel Casino.  After playing for awhile, we got hungry.  I have not liked any of the restaurants in Paris, not even Mon Ami Gabi.  My husband suggested trying Sugar Factory.  I hesitated but I was too hungry to care at this point.  

I decided to just order a Greek Salad and he ordered the Signature Burger.  I took a bite of the burger and was so surprised how much I liked it.  Keep in mind, I am NOT a burger lover at all.  But I LOVE this burger!  

We've been back here many times since then as we visit Vegas quite often.  For one reason - THE SIGNATURE BURGER!  The buns are made with white chocolate so it's a bit sweet.  The patty is perfectly cooked.  The savory patty with the slightly sweet buns are such a nice combo.  I am craving it as I write this review!  I wish they have one in LA or OC somewhere!  

Service is always friendly.  It can get really crowded on weekends but I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes as I try to avoid going during peak time.

4805597,2011-08-16,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Disappointing...

I am sooooo glad I waited until a second visit to review this place.  My first visit was great despite the service being a bit shoddy.  Food was really tasty and I couldn't wait to try out some of the other interesting stuff on the menu.  So with five hours or so to spare before my flight, we all decided to make the trek down to Paris from the Venetian in 100+ degree weather for another bite of the luscious Sugar Factory apple.

We got there around 12:30 - peak lunchtime, but the wait wasn't too bad.  Our server was really nice and promptly took our drink orders.  We looked over the menu and decided on 1) the Giant Banana Walnut Pancake, 2) the Breakfast Crepe, and 3) the Spinach & Artichoke Dip appetizer.  The pancake comes with your choice of chocolate sauce; I went with milk chocolate.

The crepe and spinach dip looked and tasted like micro-waved leftovers.  The dip was dry and chunky and the cheese on top had hardened into almost a hard crust.  It also had a kinda sour taste - not just cuz' of the artichoke, but like it had been sitting idle.  I suspect they probably reheated a mistaken order from earlier in the day.  The crepe tasted OK, but looked like it was topped with nacho cheese sauce.  It tasted like a couple of Kraft singles were thrown on and nuked at the last minute.

The pancake was actually pretty tasty - the highlight of the meal by far.  But we had eaten well over 2/3 of it before we realized she had forgotten to bring us the milk chocolate sauce.  Thought about saying something but our server was nowhere in sight at that point.  It took forever for her to bring the check even though most of the restaurant had cleared out.

I should also mention that we bought a bag of miscellaneous candy while we were waiting for our table.  Everything tasted old and stale.  [sigh] Will Sugar Factory turn out to be another one of these horrible tourist traps that tries to hide behind a trendy look and a few celeb endorsements?

4807211,2014-02-02,4,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I came here for my girlfriend's Bday dinner. It was just not up to expectations. Our party of 8 wasnt all there, but they seemed to want to keep us at the bar. Finally after 20 minutes, they finally gave in and let the 5 of us sit down since our other few weren't eating. I found this sort of annoying as the bar was pretty full (we were all in heels) and we asked to be seated a few times... But OOHH well. 

Server: Our server was pretty darn occupied with the hostesses. I am in the industry, so I understand how this works. But COMMONNN pay attention to us!! The people in our party had to go up to the bar after we were seated because he was so busy trying to meet the ladies!! 

Food Quality: Mine was decent. I had the filet. I felt the mashed potatoes were missing something, they were dying for truffle or something savory. My steak was a little over cooked. 

Issue: A girl at our table's steak was WAY undercooked. Our server didnt come around for awhile, so she watched us eat. They re-cooked the same steak to re-cook it. I think this is NASTY. I would expect this at an Applebees, but not here. EW! Dont but a steak that was on a persons germy fork back on the grill!!

Prices: For the food quality... You must be joking! There are much much better places to eat for the same price. 

Drink Prices: $16-$40 for their drinks. Pretty pricey, but they are tasty. I dont think they are very strong, we had two BIG ones and we were still sober afterwards... $80 for two. 

They also didnt do ANYTHING for her Bday!! It was a little awkward. I wasn't expecting a song or dance, but a free shot or a comped dessert would have gone a LONG way. Each person in our party left with a $60+ tab. I probably wouldnt go back, its just too pricey for the quality in my opinion. I really wouldnt want to repeat that. 

I did meet a super nice club promoter for the club next door. He really hooked my group of friends up, you can message me for his info if you need it. He really saved the night since dinner was kinda Blah.",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,5,4,2,WNyhfzfurX4NC1xl0PuBuA

4837850,2013-11-12,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Our experience, overall, was pretty bad. We stopped by The Sugar Factory midday to check out the menu and decide if we maybe wanted to come back later that night for drinks and dessert. We didn't see a menu posted, so we approached the hostess and asked her for a menu. After she scoffed and acted annoyed at us for asking to see a menu, she gave us a short, brunch menu (front and back piece) which didn't have the full amount of dinner items offered on it. So, we went back and asked a second hostess if we could look at the full menu. She practically shouted at us when she said, ""We're only serving brunch right now!"" We had to explain to her that we weren't there for brunch; we were trying to plan out where we would go that night. She rolled her eyes at us when she finally handed over the full menu.

We decided, despite our hostess experience, to go back and get dessert and drinks with our friends. The service was great and the ambiance was cool. The only thing I would change about the ambiance is that we sat inside because it was a particularly cold night on Veteran's Day in Vegas and none of us had outerwear on. We came to find out that they had their screens to the outside down so it was as if we were sitting outside anyway. We were freezing by the time we left. 

Other than the service and the ambiance, the rest was only OK. The food we ordered was sub-par. The drinks were delicious and unique. However, everything was way too overpriced.

1) the hostesses at the front have no idea what customer service is. I'd be happy if they could just stop rolling their eyes and giving their customers attitude. Come on, who's paying for your paycheck?

2) Our waitress (an African American woman) was extremely un attentive. I ordered water, and she ""completely forgot!"" really? Who takes the order and lies blatantly to your face saying ""It'll be out soon, I'm making sure!"" and then.......15 - 20 minutes go by and she walks by you like nothing happened?

First, there were tons of people waiting for tables. As I approached the desk to list my name, literally no one even looked up to acknowledge I was standing in front of them. So after a few seconds I said hello and then was lead off to my table on the patio. 

I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant with smaller tables. They were tiny!! I needed to answer some emails so I had my laptop with me thinking that a lunch break would be the perfect time - only to notice that I couldn't hold an appetizer and an 11' laptop together. 

The food was overpriced and subpar. Actually scratch that, it was just gross. The server highly recommended the chicken tenders, but I could have probably gotten better chicken tenders at sonic. Maybe it's my fault for ordering his recommendation.

At the conclusion of the meal - I say my card out on the table to hint the server that I would like my check - he never even came back by. I had to ask another server for my check that he promptly brought to me. I of course put my card in the visible slot at the top and waited for it to be picked up - 25 minutes later my original server comes and finally processes the card.

When I wake in the morning I still dream of having the same breakfast I had here....and then I do the math and realize that if I left now, I wouldn't get there till lunch or dinner anyway....sigh. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Applewood Smoked Bacon instead of Canadian Bacon. It was the most delicious breakfast I have ever had. The flavors were perfect and the bacon melted in my mouth. The poached eggs are atop a bed of scalloped potatoes....mmmmmmm. The mimosa on the side was a perfect beverage and the icing on the cake. I am actually thinking of staying at Paris again, just so I could be sleeping above the kitchen that made this breakfast....and if you have read my review on the Paris Hotel, you would know how much of a sacrifice that is. 

If you have a Harrah's card you get a discount on your meals here, so I recommend stopping by the players club which is steps from the Sugar Factory, inside the casino. 
I also recommend their Happy Hour at the bar. The drinks are dazzling, but way over priced unless you are there for HH. The drinks are buy 1 get one free at that time which is a life savor when the drinks are $16-$24 a piece.

The desserts are great and so is the food. They recently re-did their menu from when they first opened it and its still great. The one thing that I miss is the ability to order breakfast 24/7. What is awesome about this restaurant are the variety of drinks you can order. My favorite is the jolly rancher martini. It tastes exactly like a cherry jolly rancher! The only downside to the drinks are the prices. The large goblet drinks are $36 and most of their martinis are $16. Since this is Vegas the prices are what you would think but it would be nice if it was a little cheaper. As far as food goes their burgers are great! Their pasta bolognese is also very good as well. If you are in the mood for desserts I would recommend their fondue. They have a variety of things to dip in their different chocolates. My favorite is dipping strawberries into milk chocolate! If you are a tourist I would say you should go here. If not for dinner at least for a drink or two.

And I obeyed the sign and did what it told me to do and it did indeed open up my eyes...and it changed my life!

What was this sign all about Carrie D.?

The sign had a picture of what appeared to be a smores martini complete with a toasted marshmallow garnish. That alone would have made me gasp, but it was what the sign said that made me gleefully scream and jump...

""Happy Hour 4-7pm Drinks 1/2 price""

Oh hell yeah...thank you Jesus!!! The four of us looked at the sign,  looked at each other, and then looked to the bar on our left...it was the backside of the bar in the Sugar Factory. We walked over to the bar...who am I kidding, we ran to the bar. We were greeted by two lovely gentlemen who quickly handed us the specialty drink menu. OMG!!!!! Candy themed drinks!!!! I was in heaven!!! This is like my best Willy Wonka dream come true...it is the big candy room with booze!!! There were several candy themed martinis (Hubba Bubba Bubble Gum, Pop Rocks, Swedish Fish, etc.) but what caught our eyes were the 36 oz. candy themed goblets. Giant goblets of booze??? Ding ding ding, we have a winner. 

We ordered the Lollipop Passion and the White Gummy at the bar and then sat ourselves down on the leather couches in front of the bar, out in the casino. We were so excited we could barely contain ourselves, and then it happened, the two lovely bartenders walked out to where we were seated and the presentation of the drinks began. What? There is a presentation too??? Awesomesauce! They placed two glass goblets filled with ice and dry ice down on our golden tree stump tables, poured the glorious liquid out of the shakers into the glass, and garnished them with candy. They were bubbling, smoke emitting, visions of glorious boozey goodness!!!

Lollipop Passion - A beautiful green concoction of Melon, coconut, and general yumminess garnished with rainbow unicorn lollypops and candy necklaces.

White Gummy Bear - Tasted just like a white gummy bear and was garnished with, what else, my favorite...gummy bears. Fantastic!

The couches were tall but the golden tree stump tables and straws were short, so we did what any self-respecting grown adults would do when faced with this dilemma...we sat on the floor of the Paris hotel casino and enjoyed our drinks. We drew quite alot of attention what with the floor sitting, giant bubbling smokey drinks, and constant giggling. But we had the best time ever...and the drinks were delicious!

Martinis - Reg. $ 16/ HH $8
Goblets - Reg. $36/ HH $18

The drinks were so awesome that Brian V. and I had to bring our friends Larry L. and Cher M-L. with us a couple of days later to try more drinks. We stayed off the floor this time but ordered two more goblets:

Twinkie - Tastes just like a Twinkie and is garnished with, what else, an actual Twinkie. The only problem with this drink is that the cream inside the drink mixed with the bubbling dry ice creates a volcano of big, creamy, seemingly never ending, bubbles that erupt out of the glass and on to the table, floor, you. Very messy, but yummy just the same. And did I mention it tastes just like a liquid Twinkie? Magic!

Ocean Blue - Looks like the beautiful blue ocean, tastes like Hypnotiq, and comes garnished with gummy sharks. What more is there to say except it was amazing!

I love candy and I love booze and the bar at The Sugar Factory serves both...together...at the same time...in giant goblets...with dry ice. Is it boozey candy...or is it candy booze? Whatever, it is a Carrie D. dream come true.",QmH5O1JHDOBvUqzr4vz5-Q,7,7,5,sfVdPz64XuF0TTRyHz9pcA

The odd part was even though it a place that serves a lot of sweets and alcohol, I had neither. It was 11 in the morning and I was more looking for food.

I ordered The Sugar Factory Signature Burger and it was pretty good, nice juicy piece of meat, decent flavor and definitely a huge portion size.  Burger came with fries that were also crisp and tasty.

I wish I would have tried a sweet or a drink but wasn't really in the mood for either, I will definitely be making a return trip next time I am in Vegas to try something a little more special than a burger and fries.",JkyZ_0wVGoyYka5Pbw6Z6w,2,2,3,lxlWbUYFvV2BXYI0jRnBEA

seated outside in the patio, weather was sorta chilly but i enjoyed the nice street views.  I had the Sugar Factory Egg Benedict, which was super delicious, because unlike usual, the Egg Benedict came with a bed of scalloped potatoes rather than the boring English muffin!  i loved the ham, the poached egg, and the Hollandaise sauce! Just gorgeous, and i would highly recommend it!  However, my boyfriend got the Ham and Swiss Cheese Crepe, which sucked big time!  the crepe was so dry and thick and chewy!  Just dont waste your money on this crepe!  We also had a White chocolate raspberry frozen hot chocolate that came in a mega-sized mug for only 8 bucks!  My boyfriend thought it was a little bit too sweet, but i thought it was just perfect!  Last but not least, for dessert, we shared a Raspberry Mille feuille that was made up of three layers of puff pastry, alternating with two layers of fresh raspberry and yellow custard, served with whipped cream and condensed milk.  It was not highly sweetened and tasted just good :)

Service was great! Everyone at the restaurant and the gift shop was pretty nice and friendly.  

By this review, I'm giving only 4 stars because of the ham & cheese crepe that sucked :'(   anyway, again, I love Sugar Factory!!",Qb8sDTzr54wRtT9hm1ZBCg,1,2,4,CbGpEczWeNlz7ScBdk30zg

My friend had a reservation for 7:15..they wouldn't seat us until all of our party was there..so we waited. When they arrived we still waited for over 15 minutes and the hostess was rude. 

We sit down and I know I'm not a cool 20 year old anymore but it was so loud !!  I couldn't here anything but music bumping in my ear. As I looked over the menu I was dissapointed..it was very small and very expensive. I ordered the cobb salad and it was the worst salad I ever had. 

How can you mess up a salad?? Wilted lettuce..huge strips of soggy bacon and no dressing..gross!!! And for $16...I was so annoyed at this point. Still hungry after the salad disaster, my friend orders the club which was no better. I had a bite and had enough.  

So, onto dessert. I was looking forward to it since my dinner was so gross.  My friend and I split a triple chocolate sundae for $14, it was nothing special and certainly not something I would go back for. The only positive thing about my night was the server was friendly and he provided good service..other than that I will never go back.",oNMSGUU0g8zFfpfSh--xyQ,3,0,1,V8ctc2qpmHEs3rHCxGWqkA

4981425,2012-12-01,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"This review is based on the restaurant at Paris, not any of the candy stores on the strip.  Unfortunately a disappointing experience, here's my breakdown.:

Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Service: 1/5
Would I eat here again? NO!

Food:
This restaurant has simple cafe food.  I had the club sandwich and my wife had the burger.  It's pretty hard to mess-up either of those.  My wife said the burger was good and my sandwich hit the spot.  Nothing to write home about.  For dessert we had the milk chocolate fondue.  It was a nice change of pace dessert.  It included things like gummy bears and marshmallows that you dip in chocolate.  Nice... but not spectacular.

Atmosphere:
The restaurant is modern and right on the strip.  There's a lot of noise, but I would have expected so.  It's good for all ages...kids, adult, seniors.  In fact there was a meeting of the Ladies of the Red Hat Society going on.

Service:
Absolutely horrendously dreadful!  We arrived at our scheduled reservation and were promptly seated...on the other side of the room away from any other guest, as if we were lepers.  It literally took 20 minutes for a waiter to show up to take our drink order.  We told her that we're ready to order appetizers and meal at this point.  After waiting another 20 minutes our meal shows up minus the appetizers, btw again no one has stopped to see how we're doing during this time.  The next time we see the waiter we mention that the appetizer never showed up and to be sure to remove it off the bill.  He came, apologized and said that he was able to remove it off the bill (as though this was a favor to us).  Later on the manage came by and asked how the food was.  When I replied fine, a bit angrily, he asked what was wrong.  I mentioned about the appetizer he acted like ""hey, it's ok, we've taken it off the bill"" unapologetically.
I also noticed the staff were VERY young, no older than their mid 20's so it's clear they are not experienced with providing a high level of service.  There was also a group of teenagers that went barreling through the restaurant from the adjoining casino, creating noise and bumping into everything in their way.  A normal restaurant wouldn't stand for this.  But the leadership here had no issue.  
I assume that much of the hospitality leaders are educated at UNLV in Vegas.  If this is the case for this restaurant, parents don't send your kids or your money to this school.",ixU4fKwrwfgm2SaYyemHAA,1,0,2,AAHlrfPRbypxAdOriZ7BwA

It is wonderful to sit with one of their signature fishbowl drinks steaming away and people watching as the crowds go by.  Service was excellent and handed out with a sense of humor. The food is average Americana, but interesting.  We ordered tapas style to try several different items and all 3 of us came away very full!  do ask about dish portions as there are extreme variances in the size of items ordered which depending on the size of your crowd could make a difference.

5085803,2011-12-30,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Terrible experience.

Went for a late lunch around 3pm today. Checking in at the hostess stand was normal but it wasn't a good vibe. All the employees seemed very stressed out.

We were told it was a 5 minute wait and we were seated within 10 minutes.

We were seated directly next to a giant table of children. As a well dressed modern couple with no children in tow of our own, most restaurants have the decent sense to seat us away from misbehaving hellions using their silverware as drumsticks.. Ok well the restaurant was on a wait you say... deal with it its a table.. But the restaurant was far from full, the wait was due to being understaffed. I would estimate 20-30% of the tables in view were open.

Water glasses were brought to the table as soon as we sat down. They were still steaming hot as well as wet on the inside and out... awesome :rolls eyes:

So we pick up a menu that weighs over a pound and see that they have some really yummy sounding stuff, from drinks to dessert we found multiple items we wanted to try. We picked out martinis, and decided on splitting an app, soup, and crepe so we could save room to sample desserts. We even picked out stuff to try for next time. We can walk here in 5 minutes from where we live, this menu had so much stuff we wanted to try, as well as being 24hrs a day, we were really hoping this could be a go to spot for us.

I checked my watch when we sat down. After closing our menus I checked it again, and it had been almost 10 minutes and the only person who had be to our table was the busser delivering the empty glasses.

We sat with closed menus and heads scanning for someone to notice us for another 5 minutes. After 15 minutes in total had gone by, we decided to leave.

We both decided to give it another try down the road, the menu looks great. But for now I cannot recommend this restaurant anyone. The service here is terrible.",SIrzzcfgC6Rx5A8DUa7S5A,1,0,1,02ziBwH5eT9zrYtzZ0cQOg

The restaurant is clean and intriguing. The management and wait staff are accommodating and inviting.  They act like your friend dying share a secret treat with you. They know they have something good to offer. 
I left the Vegas strip for something less commercial, slower pace and higher quality, man I am glad I did. The prices are reasonable enough you could bring your family. The ambience is quality enough to bring your workgroup for a near-the-strip get-away.

Recently came back for a friend's birthday lunch and to much disappointment - the service was absolutely horrible. We had a party of 7 - didn't get our waters when we sat down, we go our appetizers and drinks in a timely manner. But, we weren't checked on or receive an update on our food for almost an hour. We had to flag down staff to find out what was going on, and even then we still had to wait an additional time for our food. We spent a total time of close to 3.5 hours in the restaurant. The goblets are still great tasting and the food was decent. One of our friend's later on in the night got really sick from the spaghetti marinara. 

My boyfriend and i were disappointed in the revisement of their menu - he really enjoyed the monte cristo sandwich & i enjoyed the turkey burger; both items had been taken off the menu. While the items we ordered this time around were just as good, we were extremely turned off by the lack of attentiveness and decrease in service quality. 

We had three servers in our party & all of them were very disappointed in the service. It's unfortunate because when we did see our server, she was pleasant, but didn't even acknowledge that we didn't see her for up to an hour.

We happened upon this restaurant for dinner one Saturday night, and at around 6:30 PM were able to score a table near the sidewalk, perfect for people watching and observing the Bellagio fountain show.  Score! 

Based on the food and drink menus, this place walks the fine line of being a bar that happens to serve food as opposed to a restaurant that serves alcohol.  It's all about perspective.  

The food menu is surprisingly limited, some appetizers, salads, burgers, pasta, pizza -  nothing that stands out.  

- Chicken and Waffles (I am a total sucker for 'em).  Their take on it includes signature bacon waffles, buttermilk fried chicken, whipped butter, and cinnamon bourbon maple syrup. I said, bourbon maple syrup!  I was disappointed to be served chicken tenders, rather than whole pieces of chicken, but otherwise the dish was okay.  The presentation was great, but the dish was priced a little more than its worth.  
- Side order of Tater Tots - I know, I know... tater tots??  Seems so elementary, right?  But that's exactly why I love 'em.  They're a personal fave of mine and so rarely do I seem them on the menu that I order them nearly every time I see it offered.  The tots here are perfect.  Well seasoned and perfectly cooked, providing just the right amount of crunch and tenderness.  
-  Pizza - Good amount of toppings, not overly cheesy.  Crust was perfectly cooked and overall tasty eats.  It wasn't extraordinary, but a solid dish nonetheless.  

Can't vouch for the drinks, though they look and sound delicious.  And at $16 for a martini and $36 for a goblet, they better damn well be.  I do appreciate the creative mixology going on.",Ci5aHpAdMGlhXpN_LI7qaw,1,2,3,TvivT_p5BOQ7cGPeV7K0Vg

5146719,2012-02-28,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"My boyfriend and I ate here for brunch one morning (we were staying in the Paris). We made an open table reservation, but the place was surprisingly uncrowded for Vegas (and quite large), so we were quite happy to be seated immediately. And then 20 minutes went by with no server, no drinks, no attention at all. I wanted to leave. We finally pulled another server aside, and after a minute conferring with the hostess, she returned to tell us our server had not come in that morning. I can't believe a restaurant would be so disorganized that they didn't realize one of their workers was not there; and allow people to be seated in that area! The food I had (Eggs Benedict) was just horrible, soggy and limp. 

I do have to say that the server who did take care of us very professionally covered for this other waitress and did try to get to our table - though she was clearly overextended and it unfortunately showed in the service.

A chocolate crepe followed that was WAY too sweet - the 4 types of chocolate killed any delicate qualities of the crepe or intricate flavors. But i guess it IS called the Sugar Factory so I should not have been surprised.  I did enviously eyeball the giant sugary cocktails (For 2-3 people) at other tables, and my boyfriend's Bloody Mary was great. 

Just stick to the drinks here and skip the food. And hopefully they can get their employees to come in in the future.",7ol-2yN9azxsTC9go-SwNg,0,0,2,w8gNDVnS1Tvs6DKr7Bjl6A

They work around tourist all day, and I understand that they can be really foolish at times but why get nasty with every face you see? 

I was beginning to inquire what was in a certain favor of ice cream I have seen at the counter, and as I am in mid speech she turns to talk to an employee, and I had to quit talking because she was now ignoring me. She was being playful with them sticking out her tongue and about five seconds in, she finally looked back at me. I go to ask what was in the ice cream. She told me, but with attitude. She asked if I wanted a sample, and I said no and got another ice cream favor. She dropped my cup of ice cream on the counter and walked away. 

Wow, I made her pretty upset just by asking what was in the ice cream? Alternatively, she was already moody about dealing have the day with people asking her that? Had another experience with a woman cashiering a few weeks before this one. She was an older lady.

5193572,2014-11-14,3,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"We got a $20 for $50 Groupon for this place, so my husband and I tried it out for breakfast Sunday morning.  We wanted to sit out on the patio as it was a beautiful day.  They sat us at a tiny table, and as we both ordered breakfast, we wanted to move across the aisle to a bigger table, that could actually hold 2 plates, 2 coffee cups and 2 glasses of water.  And then.. they started playing techno music, LOUD!  Now, I'm not a fuddy duddy, but I was not in the mood for ""UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ"" at 11:00AM.  Nor was it that kind of crowd, as we were one of the younger ones.  Most of the people there were well in their 40's.  So we decided we'll go sit inside, where there wasn't any music playing.  So we tell our waitress that we want to move inside.  She says ""I'll fix it.""  By which she meant she'll CHANGE the music to rap music, although she did turn it down just a smidge.  So we said eh, screw it, we'll just move to the larger table.  The waitress came by and said ""Oh, you still moved?""  We moved all the stuff on the table ourselves.  We didn't ask her to move them.  By this time, the husband is PISSED!  He says ""If you tip her anything, I'm not talking to you for the rest of the trip"" because I have a tendency to feel bad for the waitstaff and so I usually tip, no matter how bad the service (see my review of Yard House in Orange County).  Seriously, if you don't like people and don't want to deal with people, DON'T WORK IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY!  I did sneak her a few dollars for tip just because my conscience won't allow it (shhh, don't tell the husband!)

Long story short, the food, even with the Groupon, is still overpriced.  Maybe if we caught the water show at the Bellagio, it might have helped, but as it was in the morning, that didn't help.  All the other reviews regarding crappy service are 1,000% accurate and spot on.

5316281,2013-04-08,5,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I am appalled by the customer service I experienced at this establishment on the morning of April 7, 2013, with a server by the name of Charlie.  This was my first experience eating at a restaurant on the Las Vegas ""strip"", and now I know why.  As a server myself for over 10 years, I am all too aware of the ins and outs of the job of a server. 
 
          My first complaint is how on Gods Green Earth can a restaurant located in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip not serve BREAKFAST after 11:00am!? You are aware that there is an abundance of alcohol served in Las Vegas. There is also the possibility that the patrons of your restaurant may be experiencing the after effects of said consumption of vast amounts of alcohol, such as sleeping in past 11:00am and all they want is a great breakfast and some strong coffee, and from your menu it appears that your establishment does in fact serve a great breakfast, but only till 11:00 am!  WHY THE HE LL  DO YOU STOP SERVIGN BREAKFAST AT  11:00?!?!?   That is just despicable! 

           My second complaint is the utter lack of care and concern taken with our table once our order was taken. When our food was delivered I just happened to be in the restroom with my daughter. There were two orders of Steak and eggs delivered to our table, the food runner neglected to ask who had the order of steak Medium Well with the eggs cooked over medium. When I returned to the table, I realized right away that I had been given the wrong order of a Rare steak and eggs cooked sunny side up, I am pregnant and can not eat my steak rare, nor can I stomach my eggs sunny side up, which is exactly what I had in front of me. My friend who had clearly been given my order of a Medium Well steak and eggs over medium was clearly disappointed with his (MY) order, which he had already eaten half of. I went ahead and just switched plates with my friend and ate the rest of my half eaten meal. I did not have the time to waif for a new order, nor did I see my server anywhere to even attempt to ask for a new order.  Had the food runner been aware of the two different orders of steak and eggs I would have been much happier with my meal, considering the amount of money I paid for my half eaten meal! Also, once we ordered our steaks, how does a server not bring steak sauce to the table? My friend got up and walked over to a group of servers just standing around and had to ask for steak sauce...a good while AFTER our food was delivered. 

We never had our sodas or coffees refilled by our servers' own free will, we had to ask him!!!! That is Server Responsibility 101!!! CHECK ON YOUR TABLES!!! ""May I get you some more coffee....some more water...some more soda...some more tea, how does everything taste!!!""  I mean come on! That's was absolutely pathetic!!  

      My third complaint is the negligence on the part of the server when it came time to pay the bill.  We were a table of 10 people, we made it VERY, VERY, VERY easy for him to split the bill up. The three adults took the time to add up our meals, drinks and gratuity, Nevada tax, etc, etc for our server. We wrote the last 4 digits of each credit card and the total amount to be charged to the three separate credit cards.
 
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?!?! WE LITERTALLY SPELLED IT OUT FOR HIM:     
  Credit Card # 1234- $85.00
  Credit Card # 5678- $45.00
  Credit Card # 9101- $90.00

AND YET HE STILL MANAGED TO MESS THAT UP AND HE CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD TWICE!!!!!!!!!!  
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! 
 THANK GOD WE CAUGHT HIS MISTAKE, HE DID FIX IT, BUT I WAS TOLD IT COULD TAKE UP TO 3 DAYS FOR THE EXTRA CHARGE TO BE TAKEN OFF MY CARD.
 BUT HOW MUCH EASIER COULD WE HAVE MADE IT FOR OUR SERVER?!?!? IN MY 10 YEARS AS A SERVER I NEVER HAD IT THAT SIMPLE, WHEN IT CAME TO SPLIT PAYMENTS ON ONE LARGE TABLE!!! 


Other than all that I will say this, the food was good. My daughter ordered the baked apple waffles and they were delicious.  

Thank you for taking the time to hear me out.

5319744,2013-12-02,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I've been here a few times but never for dessert which doesn't make sense since it's SUGAR Factory and dessert is one of my favorite things.  The first few times I've been here, I got steak frites. The most recent visit, I stepped out of my comfort zone to try something else.

Steak Frites:
NY strip with garlic herb butter and lemon aioli. The thin salty and buttery steak and the crispy fries were quite good especially after a night of clubbing and drinking. 4/5

Fried Mac n Cheese:
Breaded and fried mac n cheese served with spiced tomato sauce. The sauce tasted sweet to me and the mac n cheese lacked flavor. The crisp breading was light though. 3/5

Artichoke and Spinach Dip:
Comes with tiny tortilla chips. The texture of the chips was great since they were thin - so they're light and crunchy. The dip was good and thick. 3.5/5

Pan-Roasted Salmon:
Comes with asparagus and bacon on top. I love salmon but this was just ok. The asparagus spears were wrinkly and salty. Holy sweaty balls! 2/5

The interior is nice and you have a nice view of the Bellagio Fountains. The problem is they're pretty inconsistent when it comes to service and using salt. Some nights the steak frites wasn't uber salty, some nights it was. They're open 24/7 so, the best time to go would probably after getting drunk when you're craving something salty. For the quality of food, the price is a bit high...which I have not noticed until my friend pulled out her Groupon.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,4,3,3,8JH0t21cBcYXvZ87qy-IwQ

Large lollipops and candy necklaces sticking out of the fishbowl of a glass. They pour the liquid into the glass at your table so you get to see the dry ice fog out of the glass. Very cool! http://su.pr/1YG4xW

I ordered a Sugar Factory Salad minus the bleu cheese and asked for candied apples on the side. It turns out, that evening they were out of candied apples anyway so I basically just had mixed greens, tomatoes, and cucumbers mixed in balsamic vinaigrette. It was large, it was good, but not worth $12. Perhaps the bleu cheese and candied apples makes up for how it's priced.

I also ordered a side of of Roasted Mushrooms. At first I thought that $6 per side was kinda high up there but I really wanted to ""beef"" up my simple salad. The portion for this side was HUGE and maybe worth the $6 but I also wonder who would need such a crazy amount for a side dish? I'm not hating though, it was tasty and mixed well with my salad.

The food has exponentially gotten better. I ended up getting the roasted chicken the last time I was there. It was moist, tender, and flavorful. The green beans on the bottom were cooked to perfection. It was not just tolerable so that I could continue to down drinks.

The desserts come in overkill portions. It is safe to say that you can share most items.

I was served the chicken and  waffles and I was unhappy with it overall. The waffles were original with bacon cooked in, but the chicken was dry and flavorless.

Somehow, when we came in here, it was pretty empty and there was no wait. We decided to sit at the bar to grab some dinner and sadly, I can't say that the service was particularly great.

The bartender was a little moody and didn't seem to care about us at all but made a beeline for the older couples who sat down after us and gave us more attention. Maybe they didn't think we would spend that much since we're younger? Still, not okay. Also might be because the Kardashians were supposedly coming in later and they were preoccupied. Whatever.

Anyway, I had a pizza burger and the french onion soup while my husband had a plain burger. I was surprised by the soup - not the best I've had but definitely pretty good for this kind of place. I was having an odd craving for it so was glad to see that they had it. I never order burgers out at restaurants but the pizza burger intrigued me.

I tried my dining companion's fluffer nutter milkshake and it was so sweet, rich, thick, and creamy with a strong fluffer nutter taste to it - in other words, delicious!!  Had a table inside right by the patio so it was a great spot for taking in the view of the Strip and people-watching.  Overall I was really satisfied with my experience here and would definitely come back again!

Edit: I went back in September and once again I got the Pasta Carbonara and my dining companion got the Tomato Basil Pizza (so good but also so huge!).  We split the Classic Sundae with caramel sauce for dessert.  The sundae was just ok, I've definitely had better and it could have had more caramel.",KxRf-umHzdz5noKH5Cg6Mg,0,0,5,Ohi7bnY9wLfiv9YFLwk1LA

We ordered the red velvet cake sundae to share.  It was awesome.  3 scoops of delicious ice cream, pieces of red velvet cake, homemade whip cream, fresh raspberries, and sauces.  It was plenty for 2 people to share.  Only complaint is that it could have used more cake pieces

If you like the Cheesecake factory you will like this place.

1) they have a wide selection of crepes which I suggest the ratatouille crepe as it's fab and priced right at $13 
2) they have a plethora of sugary sweet stuff that are served in glasses and called one of my favorite words ""martini""
3) they have breakfast everyday of the week till like 1 or something

It's located on the strip, there's an outside dining option, and there's typically a small wait.

Also, the Bloody Mary's are deliciously devine, so if you need a big girl cocktail that's my suggestion.  This place is also Kid approved in my book!

5471048,2013-10-30,11,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Let me start by saying that this is all based on our waiter, Sloan.

My friend and I came here for lunch one day, at a time when the restaurant was not in any means full- maybe like four tables were occupied. Let's get the pros out of the way, since there were only a few:

PROS- We both got the veggie burger, which was fantastic. It is made with real veggies and on a bun that is purple. PURPLE! And tastes great. For dessert we got the crepes (Nutella and Smores) and they too were very delicious. But, not even this great feast was enough to make up for crappy service and lackluster surroundings.

CONS- Who came up with the idea to cover every inch in tables and chairs, and in such a way that even Janga would be shamed? Seriously, not only was there no room (and I cringe at the idea of how it really would have been with a lot of people in there) but our table was lopsided, and kept rocking back and forth. The hostess who sat us even knew it- she moved it around a bit and said it would be fine. No. It was not.

Next up prices; yeah whatever, it's expensive. I get that. 100$ for lunch for two.

Now for the main one star review: Sloan, our waiter. Yeah, I remember his name. He was that bad. 
The first sign was the fact that we waited 20 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, the person (who was not our waiter but some random chick) just dropped them off and ran away. Literally ran away. That's ok. Not like I was going to ask for ketchup. Oh wait, I was. So I waited for our actual waiter to come over so I could ask for some sauce. Ten minutes later out of the hole of hell he came up and I started with ""Could I get some ranch...."" and he turned to walk away. My friend had to yell 'wait' for him to return since she too wanted sauce.
Next up, after eating and ordering dessert we waited another 20 minutes, all the while our dinner plates were in front of us and never cleared. Not until the crepes came out did our waiter walk over and clear it off. 
Finally, the wait time for the check was ridiculous. Not only had we been there for an hour and half already, we had to wait even longer for Sloan to notice us.

And where was Sloan this entire time? I shit you not, speaking to the bartender. THE ENTIRE TIME. Seriously? You only have like three tables to take care of and you stand around and talk with a bartender for the entire day? 

My friend had to wave him over to get a check, and even THEN we were forced to wait until he picked it up from the table- SINCE HE WAS RIGHT BACK WITH THE BARTENDER!

Not one person who works here seems to care about anything but standing around and talking to one another- there were plenty of other workers there, but I never saw one, NOT ONE doing anything. Well, except for the only other waitress there, who was actually doing her job. But she was the only one.

I don't ever expect to come back, at least not at the same time since that seems to be the shift where all the lazies are put on.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,10,3,1,-rWtUra4160QGOMXRKq1Ew

I ordered the White Gummi Goblet (after inquiring if you could get the drink in non-fishbowl size--you cannot).  My husband had to point out that he thought it was supposed to be for like 4 people---I said, ""Do you want an 11th Anniversary? Shut your face.""  The drink was delicious.  It tasted like a citrus/peach Sprite with frozen gummy worms ice cubes. Yum.

We started with the onion rings. They were fine--just a normal onion ring, nothing special. For my main dish, I had the fish and chips. They were boring and sad-no flavor at all. 

For dessert, we had the red velvet cake sundae (with a birthday candle). It was tasty. 

The view was amazing. We sat on the patio and were able to see the Bellagio fountains three times. Gorgeous.

I also had the spicy jambalaya. It was tastey but I couldn't eat a bite without taking a sip of drink. It was to hot for my taste. I couldn't even enjoy it. I loved the ambiance. It was sexy and fun.

The standout for us during our three times here is their SUGAR FACTORY
 SIGNATURE BURGER *
 which is a:
white chocolate bun, shredded lettuce, crispy fried onions, sliced tomatoes, american cheese, muenster cheese, sugar factory spread

It's really such a great burger. I'm surprised more people aren't raving about it.

My husband also loved their take on the eggs benedict with scalloped potatoes in place of the English muffin. 

The water thing is a little odd, but our waiter told us each time that it was unlimited after the initial $3 fee. I do believe we were not watching too closely the one day and she charged each of us the water fee. Oh well. When in Vegas.

Their cherry Tootsie Pop drink was insanely spot on. I don't like them enough to eat them today but taking a sip took me back to my days in elementary school, for sure.

Lastly, I loved their little spiked candies in the store section. Especially the s'mores treat.

The place was pretty crowded and we sat outside on the patio which we all enjoyed, great view of the bellagio fountains. Our waiter Isaac, came to order our drinks within 5 mins or less, good speedy service I thought. Than we were giving time to order our entrees. I order the TBG pasta, spaghetti, tomato, basil, Garlic and Parmesan, I added shrimp. Sounds amazing right? So I thought. I get my pasta and it looks like straight up spaghetti with marinara sauce and the shrimps still had their tails. I was really disappointed with the dish and when Isaac came back to ask how our food was I let him know I did not like pasta dish and would like to order something else. Instead of being gracious about it, he actually got offended and asked me ""why don't you like it?"" I was pretty surprised I explained to him nicely that there was no, basil, garlic, very little Parmesan and that the shrimps still have their tales, his response back was ""oh yea, we keep the tails on our shrimp"" 

I think to my self AND I'M suppose to know this how? As a waiter if it's not common to have something in a dish, it's his job to inform me that --hey, our shrimps still have tails on them, just letting you know... But he didn't and got offended when I didn't like that. Hellooooo it's a pasta dish. When I'm paying $22 I don't want to have to go digging around for the shrimp in my pasta and having to take their tails off! 

After that, he gave me the menu to reorder something else and than decided he was going to take a long time to come back to take my order. What Great customer service... After putting in my simple fried Mac & cheese order it took about another 15 mins to get to the table. When it did and I started eating he purposely went to the table behind us and asked how their meals were. I made a comment to my friend saying how nice of him to ignore us and ask the other table about their food, thinking he might of heard that he came around to our table and ask how my Mac & cheese was... Like really dude? C'mon you totally suck. And this is why sugar factory is getting a sucky rating. Sucky waiter and sucky pasta. I'm truly disappointed.

Sugar Factory ""American Brasserie,"" you let me down so hard. After careful consideration, this was probably one of the Top 5 Worst Dining Experiences I've Ever Had (future Yelp list, anyone?) 

I'm all about eating well and paying a high price for it-- especially in Vegas-- but, after eating here, I wished that my dining partner, David, and I just went to a normal cafe or even McDonald's on the way back to our resort.  I'm typically lenient with this type of fare, but our foul experience is just beyond my comprehension.

Granted, we came in here very late. Around 4:00 AM. However, the restaurant was still busy and seemed well-staffed. The menu looked appealing enough, so we were sat immediately for a table for two. We were just desperate for some supposedly decent food (Yelp here had it at 3.5 stars, cumulatively...what the hell). 

Waited a while for water...okay. Waited a while to order...okay. 
Now, never to see our waiter again. Well, correction: we saw our waiter, but he never came within a 15 foot radius of our table. Cool, thanks.
The lone highlight of this disaster: we waited under 30 minutes for food. It never should have taken this long to begin with, but whatever. 

I had just a simple burger. How hard is that, right? I could barely stomach half of it. I'm pretty confident that the bun was made back when the Paris resort was actually built...completely inedible. I took the bun off eventually and even the rest just wasn't good. I know that's not descriptive, but I was just turned off by it. Seemed almost as old as the bun and I've had better cheese and bacon toppings at a Denny's. 

Now, the worst: David had their basic chicken sandwich. This made my burger look like a star. The grilled chicken was probably rolled around the Strip like some hockey puck, picked back up, grilled into oblivion, then smashed between the same, nasty bun. He had a quarter of it, tried to just eat the meat, and couldn't. The waitstaff couldn't come by quick enough to scoop it up, not once asking our opinion.

Ohh, it gets BETTER. We couldn't get our check. I mean, really, REALLY couldn't get our check. Our waiter was still M.I.A., the other members of the waitstaff were snobby and just kept saying ""K"" to us, like they were 6th grade girls. Never in my life have I considered getting up and walking out, but it kept running through my mind in the TWENTY minutes we waited for our damn piece of paper stating the damage. 

Well, well. Still no check. The manager comes by and asks us how things were. David didn't say much. ...But I did. Every detail of our atrocious meal escaped my mouth like word vomit (+5 bonus points if you catch that reference). He seemed a bit surprised, and loosely apologized; and, instead of comping our meal (the right thing to do if he had any hope of having repeat customers), he said he would fetch our check. UM, NO.  He came back and dropped off our check with a 20% discount. Normally, fine. But this was just ridiculous. Never, EVER again. 


The Sugar Factory Brasserie attempted to emulate that of a high-class, Vegas restaurant...and miserably failed. I would never come here again even if I was paid; there are so many other better options in this fabulous city.",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,12,3,1,irH_WuYPdzsdOX0T7GCoEA

This place was definitely built with teenagers and teenager-wannabe girls in mind and I am none of the above so I was mostly annoyed by the bad top 40 music and the cheap-chic decor.  My daughter, of course, was mesmerized.  

What they did here at the old SF is pretty apparent, they melded several different concepts together to form one big, awful monstrosity that is less than the sum of the stolen parts.  Part ""brasserie"" to poach customers from Mon Ami Gabi next door, they serve French onion soup and mussels and croque monsieur, part Serendipity 3, they serve big, gut-busting ice cream concoctions and frozen hot chocolate, and part Hard Rock Cafe due to their large retail element selling $35 dollar sparkly t-shirts to unwitting parents and douchbaguette rubes.

Whatever.  It is what it is.  My problem was with the service.  The server was rarely seen since I had a couple of kids in tow.  You see, their game is to sell these tooth-achingly sweet cocktails that start @ 18 bucks.  Our server didn't think we'd be ordering any of the fancy cocktails, but she thought wrong.  When she finally made her way to our table to take our drink order and heard me order a Blow Pop she perked up real quick.  Constant upselling and pushing of more cocktails ensued.  When the time came when most people would be ordering a bathtub full of ice cream treats for dessert and we passed due to our profoundly bad experience up to that point, she rolled her eyes and disappeared again.  Just turned and left.  Wow.

I was noticing the same sort of behavior at the tables around us.  The loud, obnoxious drinkers were getting all of the service and the families splitting $22 club sandwiches and not finishing their awful candied cocktails were ignored.  I mean, we spent over 300 bucks for 5 people and the place was barely half full.  It's not like we were drinking ice waters and taking up space.

We asked one of the cocktail girls and she flagged down a pit boss to escort us through the casino floor over to Sugar Factory which, to be honest, looked like it was closed.

Not only was it open, it's ALWAYS open. 24/7. Of course, I had to order the Sugar Factory Steak & Eggs ($18) -- grilled rib-eye steak accompanied by two eggs and a bearnaise sauce. Sunny side up eggs, tender and juicy rare steak... I was in heaven! All of the dishes in the Eggs & Omelets section are served with home fries and your choice of toast. White, wheat, or cranberry challah. Wait, what? Cranberry challah?! Yes, my friends, cranberry challah. It was pretty awesome, although suspiciously buttery like a brioche.. not very pareve.

Our server Skip was very friendly. After a quick conversation over the pronunciation of ""challah,"" we learned that he hailed from LA as well. :) I think it takes a certain personality to be able to serve obnoxious late-night drunk people with smiles, so mad props to him! (Can't say the same about the hostesses though... the ones we encountered were gave off an impression of snootiness...)

A bit pricey but, at least in the case of Steak & Eggs, totally worth it. Perfect hot spot for satisfying those late-night munchies!",exVzet9UvEY69NPMyG9AMQ,4,4,4,mUggpPePMzq21rV9CP9RYg

5680931,2012-08-20,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"Worst experience ever! Will not ever go back, will not ever reccommend anyone I care about to go.  Here's what happened:

My friend's Girlfriend was having a bday party there. They hada reservation 2 weeks prior, but when we got there they had ""lost"" the reservation.  Anyways, we get seated... all 11 or 12 of us.  Our waiter was horrible, and had no personality.  Not once did he smile, or make any one of us feel welcome.  I want to let you all know, the majority of the people in our party are in the restuarant business.  We all figured it was going to be great service because the prices were so high and because they were busy.  That was deff. not the case. 

One of the people in our party ordered the Shrip cocktail... it was like 15 - 20 bucks, and only had 4 pieces of shrip in a large cocktail glass. Very lame.  My gf ate half of her food (Club Sandwhich) and got food poisening. I ordered the turkey burger and the middle of it was not cooked all the way.  I waited for about 20 minutes to see our server again to let him know. some of the people ordered a bottle of wine, that did not show up on the tab, but the server (his name is Alan) told them ""if your paying cash just add the $32.00 dont worry about the tax."" Did this guy just try to get a much larger tip then deserved?! Did this guy also just steal money from the company?! WTF.  Who does that?!  Obviously Alan did, and he seemed pretty new to the company, so apparently he learned that trick from possibly someone else who works there.  

The next day I call, speak with a ""manager"" I believe his name was Greg Waters or something like that, he didnt make his name very clear to me over the phone.  So I explain to Greg my gf has food poisening.  He didn't seem to care at all.  Matter of fact, his first few words were, ""Sir, we are very busy right now, can I take down your name and number and call you back."" That upset me.  Here I am, trying to let him know that his server/servers are stealing money from the company and my girlfriend is sick because of your food.  So what am I supposed to do?  So I left him my info, and waited for a phone call back.  Never got one.  The next day I called and asked to speak with him again.  He gets on the phone, and I was again told he was the only manager on at the moment, and he would have to call me back.  I told him something like, ""you said that last time, can you make a couple minutes of your busy day today and call me back."" So he finally did.  He called me back, I explained everything to him again. 

He said he needed some kind of doctors note, I laughed, found it to be very funny, because my gf was in fact at a doctors office earlier the day and told him it would be no problem at all to get a note.  My girlfriend was in the office, many people around, and got the feeling she was going to throw up again, ran to the bathroom, and barely made it in time.  Luckily for the other people there.  So I told Mr. Greg Waters or whatever his name is, and he figured out a way to weasel out of ""needed"" the doctors note to refund us our money.  I guess he thought I was lieing about all this, and just assumed we wanted to get a free meal.  I told him it was only 39.09 and it's not like I wanted to get the whole group refunded, I only pay for my gf and myself, so we should only get our food comped... (other people will be writing their side of the story too, so you will see that everyone should have gotten their food comped as well.)  No biggie right?! You have a horrible server/food/experience you expect to get your food comped in order to hopefully keep you coming back.  Well not this guy.  I was wrong, appently this guy is such a tool that his manager has him on such a short leash he doesn't have the authority to comp 39.09.  I told him all I wanted was my money back, he said the only thing he could do was ""invite us to come back and the meal would be on him"".  What a total retard. Who is going to come back after that?!

I can not believe my turkey burger was 16.00.  I ate 2 bites of it, sent it back for being way undercooked, then about 45 minutes later ( 20 minutes of waiting to notify my M.I.A. server Alan, and about 25 minutes for the P.O.S. cooks to make another.)  When it comes back to me, the fries were the same fries that were on the fucked up plate.  A couple of them half eaten, cold, and soggy... REALLY?!

So my food right then would have been comped at probably 80% of any restuarant.  But not this place.  They are so strung out on the MILLIONS of tourists that will most likely only go to this place because they walked by, got the ""GREAT IDEA"" to ""CHECK IT OUT"" and unfortunetly being sadly mistaken that anywhere more than likely would have been a better idea.  

Luckily Capital One dispute department knows how to keep UNHAPPY customers. they refunded us the money.  Took a little bit, but im sure glad I saved my credit card reciept. Mailed it in, with their dispute form, and poof. Got my money back!",N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA,1,0,1,3Zz1V2xxS5S_fNRXpuAB3w

I can't believe this place doesn't have 5 stars! First of all if you have a sweet tooth and I mean major sweet tooth then this is your place!!!! 

This location not only has a store but a restaurant as well. The store is quite large and carries a lot of fun stuff, starting with candy and chocolates(obviously), clothing, accessories, etc. compared to the mini versions of this store found around Vegas. 

Now for the real review which is for the drinks... They serve cocktails that tastes EXACTLY like the candy/chocolate. No joke. At first it was weird for me to digest in my head the fact that I'm drinking a liquid version of bubblegum watermelon pop, or an almond joy but its soooo good that its almosttttt as good as the real thing.

As for the food: (this is what I remember having but I've tried more things) 
-Turkey burger wasn't bad, but too big to finish by myself
-Mac & cheese balls were AMAZING
-Steak sandwich, steak was prepared perfectly and sliced thin so it was easy to eat

My friends & i had the S'mores Martini, Hubba Bubba Martini, Blow Pop Martini, & the Lemonhead Martini
ALL the martinis we tried were amazingly DELICIOUS!! its hard to pick a favorite.

the S'more Martini: it was really heavy & kind of hard to drink fast because of the creme but it was still delicious & i think id come back to get it again next time. it was kind of like drinking hot chocolate with a hint of alcohol

the Hubba Bubba Martini: as much as i love bubble gum this one was just too sweet for me

the Blow Pop Martini: it was the perfect mix between sweet & sour. not too sweet & not too sour, definitley something you can keep drinking without getting sick of it

the Lemonhead Martini: tasted EXACTLY like a lemonhead, kind of lemonadeish too but i little more on the sour side, but the sugar on the rim kinds balances out the tartness of the drink

oh! & the Happy Hour is only at the bar, not on the tables but we didnt have any trouble finding 5 seats for us at the bar when we went.

Atmosphere - 4 stars

Background - Wanted a big sit down breakfast before we hit the road home to Reno.

Atmosphere - The restaurant was only a quarter filled when we sat down.  Nice contrast of color in the place.  

Food
  Appetizer - none. 

  My Main Course - Banana bread French toast covered in berries and banana slices.  I got to say it was not very French toasty.  You had to search for the egg wash on the bread.  The bread itself was at room temperature and tasted as if they just put fruit on top of it.    The fruit was very fresh and tasty, the best part. 

  Dessert - none

Service - Okay 15 minute wait for a quarter full restaurant, fine I get that you are not staffed for a crowd.  But then take us to a table with three chairs for a group of four and not have all the place setting there.  Shame, you had plenty time to make sure that table was ready before taking us there.  How busy can two hostesses be?  Our waitress was good.  She had to explain to me that the picture on the menu in the breakfast section is actually a dessert, which the menu did not include a dessert selection.

But looking at the menu, they had some interesting, expensive drinks.  All the drinks in the menu had a candy theme to it and the prices ranged from $14-$35.  None of my family got anything from the menu. We just ordered regular drinks (i got a jack and coke which cost $9). haha.  And they also have a $99 king kong sundae. which can feed 11 people and consist of a lot of stuff.. you gotta be crazy to order that! lol

The bartenders were cool and made sure the drinks came out to our liking.

The Sugar Factory store was interesting. My sister wanted to buy a Hello Kitty lollipop holder for her daughter. Until she found out that they were $25. Waste of money for sure! 

And honestly: The sweets that they had on display didn't look appetizing at all.. They looked way to sweet and also looked like they were sitting there for a long time.

We came here late at night and had milkshakes.  Nothing special, though I must admit I'm not a big milkshake fan.  I thought it would be what I consider a malted but it was thicker and more like whipped ice cream you get out of one of those machines.  Not great.  The service was good and our server was helpful and even a bit apologetic about the quality of our milkshakes.  I limit sweets and so when I do indulge i want something that's a guilty pleasure.  Perhaps something here would fall into that category but I doubt I'll come back to find out. With so much to do and so many places to eat in Vegas it's easy to skip the Sugar Factory.",sOugrgm7sb5hQY-WDLWIOQ,0,0,2,vzmen5Aq1pp2q_d5di7FWQ
5859264,2011-04-18,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"We wanted to treat our son to something different and fun and decided to check out the newest place at Paris Las Vegas, the Sugar Factory. It was really great! The store is really fun with lots of great treats and shirts and souvenirs. 
We enjoyed the Tomato Basil Pizza, Open Face Tuna Melt and Chinese Chicken Salad. For dessert the boys enjoyed a trio of sundaes, which was unbelievable!  I (of course!) enjoyed a delicious glass of Eberle Chardonnay, buttery with apple and pears and lovely dry finish. 
Our server, Cheryl was sweet and the service was fast and efficient.  Probably, the best thing is, we sat outside to people watch and fountain watch and we weren't disappointed! The weather was just perfect!
We will surely be back with our frequent out-of-town guests!",T-3n3LgvJQuIZI_0AyF3Uw,0,0,4,PSZH2VH-9TEQFmkgno44Eg

5864496,2015-01-04,0,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"This review is for the LATE NIGHT eater. We headed here specifically because it advertised a late night menu - which is limited for those seeking good food after a late night out in Vegas. THIS is not the place to go. I can't say if the food quality is better during the day - I hope so, since I've seen this location brimming with patrons during regular hours. However, I can say that the quality of food was below any food expectations anyone can have when we visited. Everything from the apps, pizza and Caesar salad felt like it was either reheated from a pre prepared version in the kitchen or put together with the lowest of standards. I can only hope that the lack of taste and presentation is due to the restaurant's assumption that patrons at 4 am are either too drunk or too desperate to care about good food. The only reason I even give this a 1 star is because our waiter was nice, helpful and accommodating to our needs. He - not the food - get the star.",e1sXJhBh8PEW_3uwtFL_dw,1,0,1,cS3sxuEKVs4fnXtRNtt-Aw

My chinese chicken salad was pretty good, the outdoor patio had a great view of the Belagio water show, and service on a Sunday night was friendly, albeight slow. 

I went in with low expectations and came out satisfied.  Bonus points for being 24 hrs.",NKeKoFBQfYUA0zNSZCrIzA,2,0,3,wvivXjCPEE5dS4Bo7UVpqw

+Awesome operating hours (24/7)
+Location, location, location (conveniently located on the 1st floor of the Paris hotel and you can see the Strip from most tables in the restaurant)
+Pretty good customer service
+Milkshakes are large in size and flavor
+Sugar Factory candy store is connected to the restaurant

CONS
-Limited late night/early morning menu (mostly appetizers and only a few desserts are served during the off hours)

This isn't a bad place to satisfy your sweet tooth if you're on the Las Vegas Strip.  The only problem was the limited menu they have for late night hours but the customer service was pretty good and it's a nice restaurant with a cool view of the Strip.  The milkshakes are monster-sized so you can actually share it with someone if you don't think you can drink it all.  The food was alright, not the greatest but I would definitely come here for the dessert, milkshakes and candy!",-WYbVngIGDQ81MY12UtwnA,8,6,3,KEFSlc2ieEoaIITc8Ej-_A
5899843,2013-12-18,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I like this place! I was recently there for lunch. We had a Groupon that was for 40 dollars worth of food for 20 dollars. I admit I probably would not have picked this place otherwise, but since we were staying at Planet Hollywood and it was close we decided to try it out. 

I was pleasantly surprised. I had the Sugar Factory Burger, which was delicious! I dint usually order cheeseburgers when I go out to eat but the description said it had a white chocolate bun and I was sold. My boyfriend had the BLT and it was on cranberry bread it was delicious! (of course i had to try it lol). 

Then for desert we shared a Red Velvet milkshake, it had chunks of red velvet cake in it, it was delicious! 

I would definitely eat here again. Try to get a table by the the strip so you can people watch.",wnlzBWPLydYDNLhrXTR85Q,2,0,4,9xSmJcq52x842_8Lk-EPtQ

here, we had to wait over an hour for a table.  This time, we waited
about 5 minutes.  The alcoholic drinks and desserts and unique.  The
drinks, according to my friends, had a ton of sugar in them so they
hid the alcohol content very well.  The desserts were delicious!  We
got a chocolate covered pizza which was really good!  I thought it was
had too much chocolate on it, but I loved the dough (keep in mind, I'm
not a chocolate person, I prefer salty foods like chips).

This was a fun place to try.  I'll come back here.",sg5Djj61dR1cuhqj7P9hrw,5,2,4,8na8cCGW71Wk7Sl7ehuE7g

5916578,2012-04-14,2,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"The Sugar Factory restaurant is located right in front of Paris next door to their store. It has a dark but colorful almost serene setting. The bar area is spacious. Walking up we got seated right away.

The menu is 75% sweets and colorful pricy drinks. Looking at some of their drinks makes my eyes diabetic. But I was here for dinner and their dinner menu is limited to sandwiches, salads, soups, crepes, pasta, pizzas, etc. Nothing too elegant or feast-y. You're not gonna get a rack of ribs here.

I went with a ham & cheese savory crepe. I was disappointed. It was bland tasting and just lacking the oomph! It was nothing special.

Service was exceptional on the other hand.

If I come back here, it'll only be for the sweets and desserts. I did try the cake pops at the store next door and they're good.",tPJ1g7cErzV4Rlfpaef4Zw,4,4,3,f1eF7fTh2Df5LoZOGF-VYA

5948149,2014-12-05,1,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"We came on my birthday( a Tuesday) for breakfast.  The restaurant was really not busy, however, they refused to seat my cousin until we arrived.  Yeah, whatever.  Not impressed.  Really, really overpriced and to top it off, you'll pay a special ""fee"" or tax because the restaurant is not part of the casino.  WTF?  Never heard of that before.  

Ok, so I had a groupon for 50.00.  You'd think that 3 people would have a problem spending  50.00 for breakfast, especially since we're not big eaters.  Well, you'd be wrong 

I had the ""eggs benedict"" with scrambled eggs.  I asked for the hollandaise on the side.  Their version doesn't have an English muffin, if you want one on the side, it will cost you 3.95( wow).  The eggs benedict was 15.95 or 17.95, I cant remember.  It also came with 4 stalks of really tough asparagus.  The hollandaise was served in a tiny cup.  This version also contains scalloped potatoes.  Very weird and those were not cooked thru. 

My cousin had banana bread French toast which was just that.  A really thick, hard piece of banana bread that was made into French toast.  It was hard to eat and crumbled with every forkful she took.  

My wife had 3 tiny little waffles( I'm sure they were frozen) that were supposed to taste like a cinnamon roll.  They didn't.  It was not worth the price. 

My cousin also had a 5.00 hot chocolate that they charged me 6.50 for and called it chocolate milk.  I told the waiter it was hot chocolate and he said yes, that's what we charge and I had to show him the menu where it says "" Hot chocolate"", 4.95.  Jeez. 

So,with that, we still had to pay another 18.00 for tax, tip and the fee.  Crazy crazy expensive.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,5,0,2,l15QW8BZASGK1catawVFDg
5973584,2013-04-15,5,8Q6jl7OW8DZzwANggDspcw,"I think I am getting old. The music was just way too loud and as the evening progressed, I swear the music was getting louder and louder.  If you are looking for a meal with great conversation- do not come eat here. You will spend more time shouting and saying ""What?""

I have been here a few times now, and for the desserts, drinks, Bellagio fountain view, and people watching-  I'll give it 4 stars.

But, for the actual food- only 2.  My most recent visit was last night with some friends who were visiting.  We made reservations for a party of 8 (4 adults, 4 kids).  We had already perused the menu and so were ready to order right away.  But unfortunately, we just sat there for about 10 minutes waiting to order. When our waitress finally came, we were reading her lips to understand what she was saying, and unfortunately i couldn't lip-read her name.  So we place our orders, and then played the waiting game for another 30 minutes.  Finally our food came out- Rejoice! Wait, stop rejoicing.  Where are the fries I ordered? Didn't I ask for the salad dressing on the side? Are these the Chicken N Waffles? Note- they use chicken tenders in their ""Chicken N Waffles"".  So after finally getting everything corrected, we dug right in. My ham and brie sandwich was very tasty.  My husband's burger was OK, and the chicken tenders were a little dry and bland.  Because of the wait, the sub par service, it just was the opposite of my previous visits.  

I won't come back for an actual meal.  But if I do return for fun expensive drinks and dessert, I will remember my ear plugs.
