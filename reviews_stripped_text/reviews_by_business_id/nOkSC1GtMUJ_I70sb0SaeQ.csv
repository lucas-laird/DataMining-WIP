25169,2013-05-11,0,nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ,"Best pizza I have had since moving ""out west"" 8 years ago. Had the chicken pizza and all I can say about it is FANTASTIC. This pizza was made with care and the maker should be proud of his product. Coming from Michigan we had lots of local pizza parlors each with their own take on the pizza. Most of the pizzas we have had out west were blah and pretty much the same. Not so with Pizza Natali. I guess the best compliment I can give them is that ""Its worth driving 80 miles each way to get one of your pizzas"". The are opening a dining room mext door to their current location so ""dining in"" will be more comfortable as they now have only 2 tables for their customers.",vm-krY_4TEecncrqEAGWQg,0,0,5,uMWjZqXtva96KC_NmfQTZQ

The crust is what really puts this place over the top - chewy, a little bit sweet, great flavor. The toppings are generous - their gourmet pizzas are a little pricey, but tasty. The only bad thing I can say is their ""imported ham"" that's on the Hawaiian pizza isn't very good. My husband wouldn't eat it at all. 

All in all, great pizza place. I'm so glad they're basically across the street from us! We've lived in Vegas for 10 years and it's been difficult to find a decent pizza. Happy to have found one within delivery distance.",SanP0bP0rR63m7Ti7GOl6A,0,0,5,voNW3GCaRBx14TeZ4DTnzw

What about the food? It's pizza! Takes a lot of work to mess up pizza, but it also takes a lot of work to make it stand out from the rest. Nice crispy crust and no holding back on the toppings. Great tasting sauce as well. Their pasta dishes were very good too. Hot wings were nicely fried with just that right combination of tangy and spicy. Chased it down with a salad, to try my gut into accepting all of that yummy, greasy goodness. :)

The restaurant was taken over very recently, so much so that they spent the whole of last weekend cleaning it out. 
So after chatting to the main man on Thursday night (who swore that he had just finished making up a new batch of pizza dough and was about to start on the sauces) i decided to force my family to try the place tonight.

All i can say is i have died and gone to pizza heaven; i have to admit this is a total two sided sword, as i have just managed to fit into a size 2 pair of jeans, but because of the total yumminess of the pizzas here i think i'm just going to head to Wal-mart and pick up a lovely MuMu in a couple of shades of Bud Red and Coors Blue...because darling i am going back for seconds!!! 

The dough was gorgeous, and cooked perfectly, the toppings were fresh and placed there by little cherubims....i am not making this stuff up, seriously it was a brilliant pizza!

I brought a large veggy pizza and it cost $9.99 

If you are a meaty fan they have a WWWWWIIIIIIDDDDDDEEEEEE selection of flesh on offer! 

Try this place out, and spread the world.......Mama Ciminos is dead, long live Pizza Natali!!!

1670128,2014-04-27,1,nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ,"The first impression of this place seems a little sketch, as others have noted. I had this place bookmarked for a while, as well as some others, since living with a pizza connoisseur (further known as PC) so check out my other reviews for local pizza joints in the area. 

Breadsticks: 3/5 stars. They were good, but nothing to rush here to get. The dough was really well made; soft and fresh, topped with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and garlic. I didn't like the amount of butter left on the pan; it seemed wasteful and just looked gross. I also thought it was strange that the pieces weren't really uniform. 

Pepperoni pizza: 4/5. A good size for a medium, I think the serving size would be good for 2 alone or 3 with an appetizer or wings. The crust was really good; soft, chewy, and buttery with a slight crunch (if you like that sort of thing). The sauce didn't seem to have an enormous presence, but the toppings were plentiful. We usually order pepperoni pizza (yeah, we're adults- so what?!), and I'm usually pretty disappointed by how sad the pepperoni looks but here they were abundant and tasted great. Cheese was generous and tasted fresh. 

Service: (3/5) The service was a little timid. The gentleman as well as the young lady that took care of is during our meal were very soft spoken but kind, and seemed eager to make sure our meal went well.

Overall, if I lived closer to this place, we'd probably order delivery every now and again, but since Natali's isn't close enough to deliver, I don't think we'll be back unless we were in the area.

They have a limited delivery and a 10 buck minimum order but they have pretty good specials.  In fact my daughter and I just order a 2 slice and soda special for $4.99 (I think or 5.99). Each slice was the size of 1 plate (a smaller plate) but it was a great size and 1 slice filled me up.  My daughter loved that she could get glass bottled coke, she thought it was delicious.

Edited in response to the owner: 

Christine,
I'm not bringing drama to you. I'm writing an honest review about my experience at your business and why I will never patron there again. That's what Yelp is all about, right? 

If you want to discuss livelihood and children, I'm happy to. You wrote a BAD CHECK to my son who delivered food for your business. You NEGLECTED TO PAY HIM for his work on top of that. I helped him file his complaint with the Bad Check Division and the Department of Labor. 

His father approached you about the issue and you screamed profanities at him and kicked him out of your restaurant. 

I will never patron your business again for several reasons: you mistreated and stole from my family, your restaurant is dirty, your food is mediocre, and your lack of integrity is profound. 

It's a shame that people like you are in business. Las Vegas is a small town and it will be a relief to me when I see your poorly run business CLOSED. If you can't afford to pay your employees, my guess is it won't take long.",KDNXgwGM_qEyIj-5NQr-mw,1,1,1,Dz0J2j9ePTbJtWp6_3oBmw

This place is great and with the yelp deal it's half price.  You have to opt for pick up only with the deal so we got a chance to check out Pizza Natali.  This place is so cute, its a small and cozy hidden gem for sure. 

The quality and quantity of this place for top notch.  We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and seriously it was almost too much chicken for a pizza.  Ranch tasted homemade and delicious.

5031010,2014-03-13,0,nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ,"Just finished up a workout and was super hungry and craving pizza for some reason. I don't know any pizza places in the area (just moved here from out of state), so I jumped on yelp and found the highest rated pizza joint in my area. Luckily Natali's is only a mile from my apartment. 

So I drove over and was a bit skeptical at first. It was in the right corner of the shopping plaza and at the front it said ""Pizzeria"" I wasn't sure if I was at the right place but decided to walk in and check it out. I walked in and saw the menu said Natali's so I knew we were in business. The shop is divided into two sections one for ordering/drink station and the other half is the dining area. I ended up ordering the Natali's special which had peperoni, sausage, bacon, green onions, mushrooms, red onion, and olives. 

This is why I gave my 5 star rating:

Food: 
Was up there with some of the best pizza I've eaten. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful, the consistency of the cheese was perfect and not overdone like some places and the tomato sauce was also on point. But I think the best part of the pizza was the crust and dough. The bottom of the pizza had the perfect texture in my opinion, it was the right combination of crunch with out being hard. The dough was fluffy and had good flavor, didn't taste like pre-made dough that was frozen. 

Service: I came in about an hour before closing and I could clearly see the owners were tired. I forgot to mention the shop is owned by a couple, the wife takes the orders and handles the register, and the husband makes the pizzas I think. Both were very friendly despite from what I could tell had been a long day for them. Friendly attitude and answered my questions about the different sizes of pizza, certain toppings, and suggestions. I was eating alone so I asked what size they suggested, and went with the small for $15 dollars. I ended up only eating half so I took the other half home. Great deal if you think about, two good meals for $15. Pizza only took about 10 minutes to come out which was not a long wait at all and well worth it.

Ambiance: 
Nothing fancy, but I like the decor. As you walk in you see to the left a Pittsburgh Steelers collection on the wall with a tv showing the NFL network. I liked it since I'm a football fan. The dining area is nice, a bit small but has a cozy home feeling to it. Clean and nice decor, no complaints. I sat there eating pizza and watching football, not a bad combo.

Overall I really liked the food and people that work here. They're a couple who opened this shop 2 years ago and are willing to have a conversation with you which is nice, I'm rooting for them. Highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for really good pizza at a great price. Don't hesitate by the outside of the shop, just walk right through the door and get yourself some damn good pizza.",-PbNKMZ7df3ZvrPSvM94iw,0,0,5,Gcwxg2Ckqu1skqYZotLpVw

5396963,2014-07-02,0,nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ,"I have eaten here nearly every night the entire week I was in Vegas. Everytime it has been fantastic, on time, and fairly priced. Try this place out for take out, you won't be disappointed. Haven't tried delivery or dine in, but I'm sure it's equally as good. . I love the Italian Calazone and their hott wings, but the pizzas are great too. It's not an upscale type of place, so if you walk around with your nose in the air and bitch about the decor or something, you are missing the fact that the food is what you came for and that is excellent. The owners operate the place and they have always been friendly and gave the usually informal process at most places a personal touch which I like because I try to support small businesses whenever possible. The only one small suggestion I would make to them as a previous business owner myself is always keep the entry and front lobby impeccably clean even if some kid finger paints on the front window every 10 minutes. Some snazzy uniforms would also help just for image reasons. I mention this only so that if the owners read this, they get some objective constructive criticism to improve their place because I definitely will return when back in town next year for the World Series of Poker.",xD1TSAWf1E81kZc9izTQKQ,1,0,4,QLc9LEDQqj5Vm2uWRMIv-Q

All in all, great product. That combined with the excellent management will keep me coming back and spreading the word to my friends to try Pizza Natali!",SwHo_-cyGPdxlvE41vFv3Q,4,0,5,8gki6TLBiUMzF9lr5zbUIA

Recently I ordered and I saw a great improvement. The Buffalo strips were much better, less greasy!  AND what seems to be real breast meat.
The ranch is perfect , my favorite kind! slightly runny, homemade i think? but not made from a Kraft bottle yuck.  
Pizza as always was good! There pizza can never be wrong.

Same guy who delivers to my house each time. Very nice guy.

5959354,2013-07-25,4,nOkSC1GtMUJ_I70sb0SaeQ,"I have to update and upgrade this place. I've been back on a number of occasions (with Groupon and Yelp deals in hand) since my initial review. I wasn't impressed with their pizza on my first visit, but since then I have tried quite a few other menu items and their prices, quantity and quality is pretty darn irresistible. 

The service has always been very friendly and hospitable. Great mom and pop shop and they always have my food ready in a reasonable amount of time. The restaurant is tiny, so it's pretty impossible to eat here, but it's great for take out or delivery. I usually call in my order as I'm leaving work and the food is ready when I get there. 

I recommend a number of their pastas. I haven't met one I didn't enjoy and their portions are ridiculous. I was able to enjoy one order of their Mediterranean pasta for three separate meals. You just can't beat that. Their chicken fingers and garlic cheese bread are pretty darn good as well. They have a pretty extensive menu, so I'm excited to try more options soon. I have it on good authority from Jaime W that the pepperoni handrolls are a must, so I'll be trying those next time for sure.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,9,4,iZYNoyup5LlfzBvAm2h67g
