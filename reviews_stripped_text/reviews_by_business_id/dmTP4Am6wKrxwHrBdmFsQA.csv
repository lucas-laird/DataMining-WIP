It was so disgusting that I called and I think the manager talked to me and he was rude about it so I hung up. Plus when I was ordering it in the drive threw they were rude when taking my card so I recommend not to go to this location!,vifWYb28rQqiAaVOcYTfDw,0,0,1,Vk838yIUg6AIDjyLXf0nSw

2583622,2016-08-14,0,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,I was here and I ordered a large drink and a large strawberry smoothie. I got my cup right away but it literally took them 30 minutes to get my smoothie. My girlfriend said she'd wait for me so I can go eat and my food so it wouldn't get cold. The staff was working hard but they were so slow. A man came charging in from outside saying he was in his truck for an hour waiting and then another man started complaining saying he waited over 45 minutes for his burger and fries. I don't write reviews unless they're exceptionally great or really really bad and I'm so pissed with Burger King right now that id rather just eat at McDonald's for the rest of my life whenever I want fast food.,dMJe7vcCe3mDZnW6iet4qg,0,0,1,0hBCGHYxBM0ngtQPclfdWg
2625307,2017-07-21,0,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,"It started pretty good - the order taker was friendly and fast, I paid and was asked to pull around to the front because my food was being prepared. I went to the drive through - so came home before eating (to the apartments less than a block from the store - so not far).  

First, the burgers were barely room temperature. They were crusty and crunchy on the outside and so not fresh or warm that the cheese didn't melt. There was kind of a smear of mayo on less than half of the sandwich - the rest was bone dry.  I requested heavy pickle (it was on the screen and on the ticket) but there were no pickles on the sandwich at all.  It was absolutely horrible.

My nuggets were fresh and hot, but had an off-putting smell. I originally thought they'd accidentally given me onion rings - but it was just the chicken that smelled like onion rings. 

Overall terrible experience. Second time at this store (usually I don't even get a receipt to submit the survey!) so I doubt I'll be back to this location. Maybe there's a Burger King near work where I can get my flame broiled cravings satisfied, but I don't think I'll be going back to this location.",EZEezH2Im29jXd6l0W3PfQ,0,0,1,NJuDemUdudH4vzxQHL1Qtg
2768091,2017-01-20,0,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,"I really enjoyed my whopper that I was craving. The food was about the only thing good here, the burger was good and the fries were actually hot. 
But the service in here was really slow. Came in there was two people in front of us in line and two people behind us. The guy in the drive-through kept taking orders nobody said hello to us when we walked in and nobody told us we were going to wait. About 6 minutes went byand then all of a sudden three people walk in and start working. Finally got our order taken, but then we had to pick out a table and all the tables were dirty. Decided to come into the Playland for my kids, and the tables are still dirty. As a matter fact it was freezing in there. 
When I received our food there was mayonnaise all over the chicken sandwiches that we ordered. Needed to go get napkins and there were no napkins buy the drink station, had to get them from the front counter. The drink station was dirty you husband wanted water, but it was yellow, so Jewett for the Sprite. He took a drink and it was only carbonated water. So we all had to drink Coke, but only from the second fountain, the first fountain's Coke was yellow as well, well at least it wasn't soda. If I go back to burger king it won't be to this location.",e3T9PP79lQCfu5luDoJDIw,1,0,1,BzrBQqWkFGCu0Cwuf_dR-A
3140331,2015-07-18,1,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,Some people might look at my review and wonder how on earth is he ranking a fast food place 5 stars! Well.. let's start with the fact that each and every time I visit this particular location the wait time is never more than 5 minutes!  The drive thru moves pretty quick and if need be they actually will have you park if your food is going to be more than a few minutes. Who doesn't mind fresh food? I know I don't! Customer service here is CONSISTENTLY great! All the workers I have encountered have always be very pleasant to deal with. I couldn't ask for more! Needless to say that this Burger King will remain my GO TO location whenever I'm in the mood for some extra calories :-),qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,1,5,xk1FsFQKcj5g8RoHBnAE3A
3571964,2015-02-23,7,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,"I rate this burger king as a 5 star for ONE REASON...every time I come here they have me pull forward and wait for my chicken sandwich. Most people would typically get frustrated with these actions, but I appreciate the fresh chicken and not giving me a reheated patty. 

I don't mind waiting two min for fresh food...instead of choking down a dried out microwaved chicken sandwich. 

Either way...I rarely eat fast food, but this location is bearable.",yZpzRSK00hFeLNnwOf8R1g,7,6,5,rVqj4LuHBqKfFMyWXO7aiw

This is my little sister's favorite place to eat and we try and come by at least once a week. It's always clean and everyone's nice I just wish the service were faster.

4170656,2015-08-04,1,dmTP4Am6wKrxwHrBdmFsQA,"I'm so used to getting shitty half assed service when I get late night fast food, that I really don't know how to process this.

When I got to the drive thru order box, the clerk was polite and courteous, using customer service verbiage that I had just assumed went the way of the dinosaurs. When I pulled up to the window she asked if it was ok if I pulled up to the front and waited another 5 minutes for fresher food. Of course that's ok!

After only waiting about a minute up front, the clerk ran (RAN) to my car with my food. The entire order was correct and hot. As my mouth was hanging open in surprise, she wished me a good night. 

The service was so good that I didn't even trust it. Seemed especially suspicious. If this was a bad sitcom, I'd be waking up out of a dream.

The clerk's name was Heather. Give her a raise.",wFL2RrJvTsOVRU6gnRd2WQ,1,1,5,crvEDwQhe7oXx1X4rj1zYw

The first time I didn't check and I drove all the way home and found out that I was missing a burger. Today I went and I went through the drive thru to order food for my brothers and sister and I had to wait in front of the restaurant....which was just fine. However, I checked the bags when I got them and I did a double check and a triple check. Yep, I was missing a burger....and then I checked my receipt to make sure it was on there. Yep, still missing a burger. I had to get my lazy butt out of the car (hence that is why I was going through the drive thru) and walk inside the store. They were very accommodating and I needed that burger with 3 teenage boys and a growing girl....I needed all the food that I ordered.

Upon arriving, the drive thru wasn't open, so looking like a hobo inside will do. The service was great actually and the food was yummy as always.

The last time I went there (about four days ago) I was asked to pull around and after waiting fifteen minutes I gave up and went inside to find out where my order was. They had no idea.

I see no reason to tell people to pull around the building when there is no one behind them. And what really frosted me the last time was watching other people who came later through the drive thru get their orders at the window and drive away.

Burger King in NV! I ordered a cheeseburger and as I was eating it 
I looked down and seen a weird long 
String? Type looking thing? I still don't
Know what! The hell! It was? It was really 
Thin and sort of clear looking. I freaked 
Out a little and hurried up and tossed it 
In the trash, as I didn't want to scare my young children who was eating there chicken nuggets. I then grabbed the nuggets and tossed those also because I was scared that maybe someone working there either drop something in our food or the food itself was decomposing! Ecck!!
It makes me want to vomit just thinking of 
It. I wish I would have taken a picture of the unusual long string like particle in my food it was definitely something not normal and I should have made a complaint. The store is filthy inside and I will never go back in fact I might not ever go back to any fast food place again. Also the people who work there seem like they do not care about the customer or the food they almost always get the orders wrong and they themselves look filthy as well. their uniforms are covered in stains and they look very unsanitary.",K-H4cQK-glL0DMSf8iI-tg,1,0,1,oSLc72LhIXzSd2e3WOFNKw

So going back to Burger King and trying the whopper after a few years of having skipped them, was a bit disappointing! I don't know if it was the late night order, we went around 8oclock at night, or they have lost some of their flavor. 

The bun was dried out, the burger had no flavor, and the best thing about the meal was the french fries. I know that consistency plays a big role in any fast food place, but I don't know if I want to try again, I was that disappointed.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,0,0,2,u8ywptHk1BvZGrFjGkstoQ
