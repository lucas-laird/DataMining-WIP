Lots of local Hawaiians you see. One night playing craps the hottest Asian girl assumed she was from Hawaii got on the table and played her father was teaching her. Reason why i think she was from Hawaii she was talking Pidgin local style. "" Ehh u 10 dolla horn.""  Reason why she is hott is she was close to 6feet.  Maybe a hapa bloodline gave her height.   Back to gaming, slot machines are ok.  Play a lot of keno the most I won was 75. By design I always miss the 1000+ payout by one number. I don't really play slots.  All you can drink if you playing table games. The Chinese restaurant isn't real Chinese.  However if your drunk enough it will taste like real Chinese food.

The point of this review, is to mention the fact that for the last few years you can get:  

$2 Corona at all casino bars 24x7 at the Freemont and The Cal!

The table minimums hover in the $3-$5 range most times.   The odds on Craps are not the greatest (maybe 5x, if that). The game at The Cal is a bit better.  

You can ask the pit boss for a 2-for-1 buffet coupon while playing nickel Texas Tea.  He may say, ""No, not at that level of play"".  If he does, go to the Players Club booth.  They will give you one for free.",V15zULSb4YRR0MaPPtuBBQ,0,0,3,6l2M27_3vk6xWHGT3LI_bA

At 1:30am called customer service, was connected to the front desk and requested a different room, none available, try in the morning, which we did and got a room on the 10th floor. The noise was still there but not as loud and we got a good night sleep.

The rooms have the smallest bathrooms but large flat screen TV""s. 
WiFi costs $9.99 for 24 hours.
The buffet is only 5 from 1-10 but inexpensive.

Checked out after 2 nights because the cards at the tables where not generous to us so our gambling fund was gone.

See views from room 240 and room 1036 in the photo section.

The dealers where friendly, the drink servers attentive. Tony Roma's Prime Rib special ($8.99) from 4:30-6:30 brings the crowds so get in line early.

Sadly I had a horrible experience and it has permanently changed my views of this place. I was playing at the Craps table ($3) and this very loud group next to me was playing and the man next to me on multiple occasion kept thinking my money was his. So in my mind I am like why aren't these people doing anything to prevent this? So it got so bad that they actually had to go look at the tape.

So here is my real issue. The man argued to the staff that it was his money on the table and I was nicely sad that it was mine but the game in no way could be stop while the conflict got resolved. So Money that no one could confirm sat on the table when all I wanted to was grab my money and leave. The Manager on duty Monica  was so rude to me she did look at the tape (for 10-15 mins) and saw that it was my money and when I asked for my $3 back YES $3 that they couldn't confirm that was mine she tried to tell me I was trying to get over and scamming them. I WAS LIKE ARE YOU SERIOUS you guys make $3 in 0.02 seconds and you can't afford to give me $3???? She told me I had to make an appointment to speak to someone higher than her. the customer service was TERRRRIBLE and it did not stop there.

The next morning I called and asked to speak to the Operations Manager and he got on the phone and told me he would take a look at it and give me a call back and pretty much said what do you want and we cant give you anything more than $3. I NEVER HEARD FROM THIS MAN EVER AGAIN! 

and I made it clear if you would've given me the stinking $3 I would've given it right back to you at the craps table. 


Just be careful at this place... I am so sad that this happened to me at my FAVORITE place.",zMa0fHSknBe0QQsVjfIgmg,13,2,1,p18uVgo_tSDuca3EdPa5wA

This was my first encounter with bed bugs. We just checked in room 729 started unpacking our stuff.  My husband was on the bed and right on the edge of the sheet by pillow we see a bed bug.  I had my husband trap it in cup.  Notified the front desk packed our stuff and bolted out of the room.  Went down to show them the bug and they threw it in the trash without killing it.  In few weeks the front desk will be infested. We got a new room a mini suite which was better but didn't make me feel any better.  I told them my concerns about bringing them home and they told me I could go file a report with Security.  I did after we checked the new room.  Which took about 30 minutes.  When I went down to turn in the incident report the security personnel said he didn't find anything.  I told them the evidence was in the front desk trash can.  Not sure if they well even contact an exterminator.  

I should of known the moment we walked into the room the furniture was stained, the room was not vacuumed, and there was barely any space to walk around. From beginning to end the situation was not handled properly.  I'm going to contact the Clark County Health Dept.  I feel they didn't adequately take precautionary measures when I gave them the bed bug.  I would not want this to happen to anyone else.  We had to bag up all our belongings before we left and put it in the back of the truck hoping the heat would kill any hitchhikers.

Stayed for (technically) five days, four nights.  We booked with Vacations Hawaii, so everything was set for us already. Usually, we'd stay with family but we wanted to stay where all the action was. We got in around midnight on the 10th so the hotel wasn't as crowded, just the sound of thousand of slot machines going at it. During check in, you can only stand in one line because they only have one Vacations Hawaii representative. That's fine, I guess. There were 3 more desk help, which would've been convenient to help the rep to get us to our rooms faster.. I mean, Hello? We're jet lagged! And some people want to gamble already! 
Our room number was 804. Average room with two full beds, perfect for 2-4 people. We had a view of the mountains and the canopy of Fremont Street Experience. The room was very clean, cleaner than some of the reviews on this app say it is. The only thing was as soon as we got in the room, it reeked of straight cigarettes. Gave us all headaches that night but the smell was gone by morning and the rest of the stay. The bathroom is fairly small, but we didn't mind. Deep, long shower/tub combination- I'm 5'1""/5'2"" and I could stretch my legs out. The toilet is right by the door, which was weird but whatever. Sink water is super cold, my face would feel numb every time I wash up. Other than that, big mirror with good lighting. Perfect for women to do hair and make up.  Housekeeping is amazing, such nice ladies! If you go out for a cup of coffee at Dunkin Donuts downstairs in the morning, your room will be clean and neat by the time you get back up. Don't forget to tip!! 
I'm only 18, so I couldn't do much in Vegas. But my parents had fun gambling and we enjoyed the Paradise Buffett on the first floor! Gets full every time. Right out the doors is Fremont Street Experience with 4 Queens, Golden Nugget, and Binions right next door. California, Main Street and Golden Gate is probably a 3-7 minute walk away. The noise isn't all bad, but then again Im pretty high up. It calms down by 1/2 AM so you'd still get a solid 5-6 hours of sleep or more. Just close the blinds on the windows and you'll be fine.
We leave tomorrow, but I wish we could stay longer! Overall, I've enjoyed my stay at the Fremont and would definitely stay here again!",A6m-mbdwDDrSykKSjROpSg,7,0,5,7IaFzBS3HYiBrKDAZQg7IQ
412112,2006-12-26,0,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"The Fremont has a great seafood buffet for under $20 a person. The seating area is gaudy as hell with emerald green everything accented with gold - it's SO Vegas. Service was great - it was super busy but we were never out of something to drink and the plates were cleared before you came back with your next round. 

The seafood buffet has snow crab, king crab, oysters, shrimp (scampi, cocktail, deep fried, and cooked with shell on), mussels, clams, smoked salmon, and sushi. To be honest, the sushi isn't that great but are you really going to a buffet for the sushi? There's also really great prime rib but get there when they first  bring out the meat because the medium rare part is the best. So it's not the BEST buffet in town but it's cheap and good so I would say it gets the job done.

Our room was clean, nicely decorated and comfortable, but a bit on the smaller side. We stayed on a higher floor facing Binion's and did not have any noise issues. No honking cabbies as I read about on other reviews. 

The sports book was large enough for me to kick back and enjoy myself for a couple hours on a Saturday morning. The table minimums are lower than on the strip, though the tables were pretty crowded most of that weekend. Easy to find $3 BJack still paying 3:2 downtown. 

Food at the Fremont Hotel was decent and there are many other options close by. One of the appealing aspects of Fremont Street is how close all of the food, drink and gaming options are. 

Service at the Fremont was very good, especially from the housekeeper and front desk staff. A waitress at the buffet was rude and unfriendly, but we didn't let that bother our meal. In-room safes are always appreciated and provide a little peace of mind.

Overall, we had a blast staying here and definitely recognized the value it represents. Sign up for Boyd's B-Connected Card and stay here for $31 on weekdays, $39 most weekends! Seriously, this is a steal for such clean, stylish rooms located right in the middle of all of the D'town action.  Use the savings to fatten your bankroll. 

Our trip was here for two nights and then a week at the Venetian. We have stayed on the strip many times. Next time we might stay downtown for our whole stay and shuttle to the strip and back. 

The Express Shuttle bus service is a quick and painless way to go back and forth from the strip. Much, much, much better than the Deuce. The Express to the strip loads outside Binions and returns outside Golden Nugget.  We will definitely come back to The Fremont.",BDL-6q8pWHAKbYOAo50svQ,3,0,4,MsOPnvvV2EMPM5b29Pp9yw

The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable. Housekeeping was excellent. The location is good if you're looking for a hotel in the Fremont Street area. 

The reasons we will never be back: We booked the Fremont Hotel for New Years Eve to be on Fremont Street for the Fremont experience!!! In past years, we took a cab to the area and patronized the hotels, vendors, etc and left. This year, however, there was a massive charge to stand on the street? WTF? I'm not sure how much kick back the city gets for this, but it was totally unreasonable. So since we chose not to purchase the 'tickets,' we were stuck in the hotel unless we wanted to exit a back door into the ghetto. 
Secondly, we went to the buffet, which we did daily. This time there was someone in line that had an issue with credit for a discount or something. Literally, we waited 25 minutes and the line was out the door. They didn't open another register, ask him to step aside, or anything. It actually became more entertainment and shit talking between the customers to see how long this would continue. Meanwhile, breakfast time had ended and lunch started. We were there for breakfast. We were told the breakfast prices ended but there may be a couple items remaining in the dining room. No, there was not. 
I went to the front desk to talk to a manager and she said she would talk to someone at the buffet restaurant...and thanks.

First, the room was terrible. The hot water sink handle was loose and broke off while we were staying there. The AC button was also loose and was actually broken too!! The towel rack in the bathroom was nearly hanging off the wall and slanted. The tile around the bath tube on the wall was also peeling from water damage. Also, the shower would pulsate warm to HOT. Let's just say the quality of the room was TERRIBLE and GHETTO. 
Speaking of the casino, our first night the backage boy left our hotel room wide open!! And who knows how long that door stayed open. The bar by the front of the doors had the rudest bartenders. 
Betting at the casino was also terrible. The dealers were absolutely rude,especially this lady named Yeishi. She not only singled me out while playing at the black jack table but straight up said ""You dont know how to play"". 
Overall, the Fremont sucked. We are definitely staying at the California or any other lovely casion with workers who dont harass their guest.",fQoeRj2ixiwo7eYSvYkYrg,8,1,1,HzzbTPCc_OUC1rqJL8PSmw

  ""Table 32 is ready at Tony Roma's.  Table 32, Tony Roma's.""  ""Table 33 is ready at Tony Roma's.  Table 33, Tony Roma's....""

The announcement bellows through the ENTIRE casino.  Could the blinky buzzers utilized by other restaurants be put into play?  Certainly.  But then, the rib joint wouldn't get the free ads to casino patrons.

There are too many other casinos just a few steps away.  The unnecessary, aggravating, loud announcements start...and I stop at the Fremont.  Ugh.


UPDATE ON 10/25/2013:  It seems the Tony Roma blaring, annoying loudspeaker announcements are not just to alleviate any ""unsafe"" crowds gathering around the restaurant.  I met a friend at the Fremont last night.  We had to stop our conversation every time the loud announcements for the restaurant were made...and they are frustratingly often.  Then, a few minutes before 10 pm, there were TWO blaring announcements:  ""There is currently no wait for tables at Tony Roma's.  Immediate seating is available now at Tony Roma's.""

Please, I'm begging you, stop it!!!  Figure out another way to promote the damn restaurant.  Give people blinky buzzers, as is the case with other restaurants.  Don't pretend those horridy, obnoxious announcements are necessary.  They're not.  And they sure don't make me want to go to the rib joint or spend much time in the casino!!",oYZBpdMRk8LX_i-0GQz0Jg,2,1,3,seyLl54anwybytHCupzpZA

Since my Dad wanted to go to the Freemont Street Experience (which actually is awesome) our whole family flew in from different states, met at the airport and drove a rental over to here.  Parking was free and very easy to use, nice and close in their own garage.   And since it was near his birthday we were treating him by acting a little more lavish.  Since none of us gamble we never spend much in Vegas anyway so we decided to splurge here and I had reserved two entire corner suites near the top.  

When arriving at the check in counter, there was a huge and I do mean HUGE line of people ranging from bewildered and mildly confused, to pretty pissed off.    Apparently the credit card machines went down, and they were manually writing down card numbers on paper (that sounds real safe huh, to leave your card number on a piece of paper in a Las Vegas Casino Hotel?"").   Well, whatever.  After standing in line nearly an hour I was just glad to get our keys.   

The rooms were in fact HUGE with a great view out three sides of the building (both suites combined).    We had a great time the whole weekend, really enjoyed the Freemont Street Experience.  This is the perfect place to stay as when you walk out on the street, you're there at the center.   

In checking my credit card bill over the next few months I never saw the charge for our rooms.   And in fairness (maybe I am too honest for my own good), I did call there and asked for a copy of my receipt, letting them know that they never charged me.   And after waiting on hold for about 20 minutes a lady came back and told me that she had no record of us having ever stayed there.

Then, we were given a smoking room which smelled awful and when we called the front desk to tell them that they made a mistake, they rudely told us they had no other rooms available and they had given our non smoking room to someone else ( I believe her name was Nora.)  We had to have the drain in the bathroom fixed twice, the tv didn't work until we called for maintenance, and the handles on the sink were broken and falling off.

Indeed... It's two spoons of micro shrimp over cocktail sauce over shredded celery. Tasty snacking, but not the same as up the street... and the loose celery in your system will come back to haunt you, I found out later.

I also ordered a saimin, to compare to the grill in the Plaza up the street, and immediately regretted it when I saw them unwrap it and jam it in the microwave.  All in all, the eatery is meh.

After failed attempts to reprogram our keys, the hotel had to call an Engineer to fix our door; I think it was a faulty mechanism.

1441205,2013-01-27,9,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"Stayed two nights here just to try it. Overall, it was a good stay. The best thing going for this hotel & casino is the location. It's a very short walk from the room elevators to the middle of the action on Fremont Street. I'd say literally 1-2 minutes from elevator to Fremont (depending upon how fast you walk). 

But be forewarned, the rooms are very tiny and you've got almost no counter space (see photos). Put it this way, I'm a guy. I shave my head. My counter space needs are about as minimal as they come. But I found navigating the bathroom extremely challenging. I almost had to use the bathtub ledge to place a few items. 

The toilet is right there by the sink, too. You could literally sit on the toilet and shave in the mirror at the same time. I didn't, because it would be creepy. But you could. 

The room is pretty much a bed and TV. The bed takes up more than half the room. The closet is adequate. So all in all, just a very tight room but it serves the purpose. I slept well here. Staff were professional and had no issues to complain of. 

Again, the major advantage of staying at the Fremont is the access to Fremont St where everything happens. If you just want a room to crash in, this is a good option.

So I would probably come back alone. But it's definitely not a place to impress a date.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,9,0,3,MiPg7JKUuxj3VBB1UOq-5Q

It reminds me of hole-in-the-wall bars that I wpuld go to back home. Not a lot of people or chatting... just add in the sound of the slot machines that surround you. 

There is a Tony Romas near by and what I believe is a buffet behind the bathroom area (kind of weird).

This is a no-frills hotel and casino but the nicest staff anywhere.  The room was simple-standard but very clean and security was almost always at the elevators watching who went up which insured a sense of safety.  My room was on the opposite end of Fremont street but of course I could hear the sounds from the street.  I'm a light sleeper but because I didn't go to sleep until after 1 am, I was fine.  If you have on the a/c or heat, the fan noise will drown out a lot of the street noise.  Walls weren't paper thin, the bed was comfortable, so I slept like a baby. 

There are some food places downstairs inside the hotel casino.  The sweet shop looked tantalizing!  The Asian restaurant was cafeteria style. It was reasonably priced and the food was ok. The souvenir shops on Fremont street are dirt cheap so that's the place to stock up if you're into taking souvenirs home to family and friends. The light show is fabulous.  It's a giant carnival atmosphere.  A lot of homeless populate the area and walk the beat continuously - some asking for money, especially in the day time so be careful with money, purses, wallets or other valuables. 

There are numerous cheap eats along Fremont street, even a White Castle but everything here costs more than in local areas.  For example, regular size White Castle fries were $2.59.  However, the prices are still cheaper on Fremont than on the strip.  If you want to save a bundle on lodging and don't need the upscale atmosphere, I recommend the Fremont.",-ek7r-XzDSwPFXwiEmqdlA,3,0,3,6aoJ0Y9bDCzuUTboPepUdA

1608921,2016-06-06,1,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"- Everything's faster than strip
We stayed here before our flight back from our road trip. We found Fremont hotel to be very convenient. Away from strip traffic. Check in was very quick, about 5min at 8pm, strip hotels usually take 30min. Valet and bell hop were also very prompt. 
We booked via third party site so they gave us a room way in the corner and AC wasn't working. However they promptly changed it to a better room. Room was decent bed, AC and average shower/bathroom. They have a dunkin donuts downstairs which is reasonably priced. 
Location is great, The Fremont street experience is right down and has grown a whole lot over the years so there's plenty of stuff to see and do. Parking is a little tough to find and its valet only. Be sure to note the parking location as Fremont street will mostly be closed to traffic on Friday and Saturday night. But you can then walk everywhere and get drinks, dance or gamble without the hustle of the strip. 
Downside is it gets very noisy with EMS and police about every hour. Crowd is average, no elites here but minimum bets on the gambling tables are low. 
Casino smoke filters are awful, I instantly got a headache in the casino area. I'd book this hotel for like $60-75, I'd go to strip area if the price is over $100. Wifi is $10/day and no in room coffee.",jCEPqPBIWLCW0c9jVGbAPg,10,1,3,RkCGMQ38eeiNUMzGluDl_A
1611660,2017-07-14,0,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"To begin, we knew when we booked the place that it wasn't going to be the same experience one might get at the Venetian, Caesar's or even Sam's Town.

This hotel does not have a resort fee and that is part of what drew us to it. My husband and I came to Vegas to get married and we wanted to stay in downtown/old Vegas because the hotel is close to the marriage bureau and the chapel we chose. Neither of us has spent time in downtown Vegas before so that was another reason we chose the Fremont.

Positives: the housekeeping staff was super nice, helpful and very accommodating. Our housekeeper, Angelica, was so sweet and even thanked us for staying and gave us well wishes for our nuptials! 

Additionally, we loved that the elevators were all functional and very quick. I have stayed at many places where it can be a major pain if the elevators aren't all working or they are slow (especially when you are traveling with luggage or buying souvenirs, etc.) 

It's also a great location if you want to be at the center of the Fremont experience! We were also able to check in early (before 3pm and we were able to check out late at 1pm.) 

Negatives: Upon arrival, we waited more than 5 minutes before we were even acknowledged by someone at the front counter (and I promise we were in clear view.) We continued to wait patiently though they seemed to think having two people checking in was enough to accommodate the lengthy line. One employee stood over another on the computer ""helping her"" for a good amount of time before they helped the people in front of us. It was pretty bad customer service all around but we even shrugged it off thinking maybe they were short-handed or were in the midst of training someone new. 

I also asked for a complimentary upgrade (using the $20 Bill trick) by stating we were getting married and it would be great to have a better room if one was available. They barely acknowledged my request and didn't even tell me or my husband ""congratulations.""

When we got to our first room, it was TINY. Now I don't need a ton of room but when you feel like you are always on top of the other person in the room something is wrong. The A.C. was also barely even blowing cool air. And I mean barely! We turned it on high thinking it had been on low earlier and so that is why the room wasn't cool when we got in there. The sheets appeared to be clean and in order but there was a WET, mystery stain on the one chair we had in our room. The drawers also smelled musty so we had to hang most of our clothing.

We stayed in the room one night before I followed up with the front desk about a complimentary upgrade. They still seemed really bored and annoyed with my request so I finally said I would pay for one and Miracle of all Miracles they magically had one available. So on Monday, the day of our wedding, we moved rooms but due to timing issues between my husband and I getting ready I had to relay the room change to him via FB chat. I DID inform the front desk that it would be some time before we could get our stuff moved from room to room because we had a set appointment at a chapel for 7. My husband had to go downstairs to get a key for the new room not realizing they had already turned off his key to the first room! So he couldn't even get into the first room to gather all our belongings to get them moved. My husband had to go back down to the front desk and the lady was extremely short and rude with him about not having our belongings out of the room! 

While the second room we purchased was a ""mini suite"" the A.C. situation was just as bad as the first room! Though there was a fridge and much more room and sitting space the bathroom was just as small and run down as our first room! We had to pay an additional $50/day for this upgrade. In addition, they don't tell you that because they don't charge a resort fee it's $10/day for Wi-Fi! Crazy. 

Upon checking out, we had to split payments between two different cards for the difference in the upgrade charges. The person I dealt with and the person my husband dealt with were saying completely contradictory things that caused so much unnecessary confusion. I still don't think we were even charged correctly after looking at the itemized Bill and comparing to our bank statements. 


In conclusion, don't stay here if cold A.C. is important to you! (I'm being very serious here.) Also, double check your billing statements for the room and get to know the housekeeping staff. If you can afford to splurge on another room I definitely would (the D is fairly new I think and is probably one of the hotels in better condition.)

He checked the cash register and said that it wasn't possible because if we gave him a $10 and he gave change for a $5, OBVIOUSLY the $10 bill would be in the $5 slot. Right.

He then offered to call surveilance. We said, ""Please do."" After waiting for about 15 minutes, the bartender returned, held up his hands with a fake apologetic look and said, ""Sorry! Surveilance said they saw a 5.""

So, I stopped in at the Fremont, because lots of locals shoot dice there and its kinda ""Hawaiianish"". Right off the bat, I lost $150 on the craps table in about 20 minutes. OK, next game..... Hmmm black jack sounds good.

I checked out the open tables and found a SINGLE deck BJ with a $5 min bet. Sounded good to me. Sat down and gave the dealer a Benny for some change. She told me, ""OK, you have to wait till we finish the deck then you can join."" 

I was like WTF, they deal the deck down to bottom and don't let new players in until they finish the deck. You know what that means, huh?! 

Whoa, yeah! So I sat down and played for about 5 hours and kind of tripled my stakes.

***** I give this place 5 stars for the Black Jack tables,  * * * * * 

Sidenote: 
They pay only 6/5 for a BlackJack and not 3/2. So if you have a BJ and insure it you wont get even money but at least you'll win. Otherwise its a push and you'll get nada.

The room though a bit smaller than what I've been used to, is very clean and comfortable.  The carpet is updated and so is all the furniture.  Having a refrigerator in the room definitely helped.  Plus, the additional lounge chair and area, allowed just enough room for four dudes to catch some shut-eye.  

The restroom was tiny but very clean.  The fixtures looked old but you can tell there had been an honest attempt to freshen things up, as I noticed the quality wall paper that was probably put on within the last 5 years or less. 

I must add that staying on the VIP Level Floor (#10) was perfect as you I did not hear any noise from other guests.  The only issues is, that since you're right on Fremont Street, you will hear the music blasting from about 10am-2am.  

Remember to tip well as people work for tips in Vegas... ask and you shall receive. 

I enjoyed the freedom of being to be able to walk out of your room and only be a few steps away from all the action as well as the other Classic Hotels as the Four Queens, Golden Nugget and Binions.

We stayed for 5 nights in August and had a great vacation. It was my first trip Downtown, and I was warned at how small the hotel room was, and it's true. However, for the amount of time we were in the room, the size didn't really matter. The room was in need of a little TLC, there was a spot with loose wallpaper, but other than that, everything was clean, neat, and in working order. 

The bed and other furnishings were very comfortable and perfectly adequate for a room of that size. Housekeeping did a fabulous job of keeping the room clean and stocked with towels. 

The room had a flat panel HDTV with your typical cable channels, and a small safe was on the wall just inside the door. 

The best part about the room was the air conditioner, which worked famously for the August heat! Absolutely no complaints there. 

The shower head is a bit low for those who are taller (My sweetie is 6'3""), but water pressure and hot water were plentiful.  The bathroom sink has a very small bit of counter space, and I mean S M A L L. But I managed to get all of my girlie stuff up on the shelf above it with no problem. If you travel like the Kardashians, you are probably S.O.L in that department. 

Check in was quick and the clerk was friendly. I redeemed my B-Connected card at the Players Club desk with no wait. 

The casino itself is well stocked with a ton of slot machines, and I was pleasantly surprised with how not smoky the casino was, since I heard that the ventilation downtown wasn't as good as on the strip. Not so, in my opinion. I am a non-smoker and I was never once repulsed by the stench of smoke in this, or any other casino downtown for that matter (Except Mermaids, that place is disgusting). A great bonus is location, location, location! You can walk across the street to Binions, The D, and Golden Nugget in no time at all. (Hash House is just down the street at the Plaza, which is a MUST when staying in Vegas)

The food choices were great! Dunkin Donuts, Lanai Express, Rocky Mountain Chocolate, and the best one.... Second Street Grill- which is truly a hidden gem. (I have a separate review for it). Now, I must say that the Paradise Buffet is mediocre at best, but there are far worse buffets around. (We had free buffets for length of stay, so it wasn't too bad)

Friendly staff, clean, neat, comfortable rooms, great casino in a fabulous location, awesome food... what more could you ask for in a $32/night room? 

We have another trip planned for early November, and I'm sure we'll enjoy it just as much as we did in August.",Cvz4v8jRj7Z1cgz8WJuqtw,6,0,5,0BkskFEmcTRdSFgOieekZg

We were staying at the Fremont from 1/6-1/11 for CES, as most of the strip hotels were booked or super expensive. Valet staff (you have no choice but to valet, btw) was kind and helpful, and check in was pleasant. 

However, there is one angry, overweight woman with gray/blonde hair who is the absolute worst. There was a murder or violent crime one night and we couldn't get into the required valet parking due to the street being blocked off, so we were forced to park elsewhere and pay. 

When we asked if the hotel could do anything for us afterwards, said angry woman snarled at us, saying ""good luck with that"", and proceeded to hurl abuse as we walked away in shock.

Staff were very nice and professional.  Security guys are bright and witty.  Fremont is a fun time and I enjoyed myself.

For Vegas these places are poor but if they were raking in as much coin as this in our/your hometown you would expect 5 star treatment and facilities.

The Downtown experience's namesake is in a great location. Centralized on Freemont Street makes it the perfect for stopping in as you cruise up and down Old Vegas.

$2 Heinekens and Coronas 24 hrs a day at the bars inside mean I stop 
in every time I go down town. The people who work the beer well bar obviously don't get tipped as often as they should because they are more than gracious with even a small tip. (tip them $1 for each beer on 2 beers and they will normally remember you for a while and make sure you are served a little quicker.)
There's not much to see inside and this place is pretty cramped because of how the floor is laid out. The food selection as far as places to stop in for a quick bite are really limited and not very good at that.
However they also have a Tony Roma's (You can tell this used to be their cafe) that serves a steak and lobster dinner every day from 9pm-11pm, which is a great place to stop in and take a break from the crowd, and unless there is an event there is almost always seating.

The gaming always seems pretty active though, and although I've never played table games here the craps pits are always 2 rows deep with players and onlookers, which livens up the atmosphere.

The Freemont has obviously gone through a tad bit of renovations and they are trying to keep up with the other markets in the area. The Freemont is trying to change their atmosphere & clientele to a younger, hipper, more business type of crowd but work is still to be done in all of the avenues just stated. 

I am a very picky eater and I have yet to chance dining here. The dark vibe that I get when entering this place is not one that I even entertains allowing me to eat at. 

The gaming areas are table's minimums of $5 & $10 in the evening which is something I always look for when choosing where I am going to gamble. The Sportsbook is small with a vibe of Old School which I dig. 

I will continue giving this place a chance but if they do not spend some serious cash to keep up with the Golden Nuggets in the area they really stand no chance of surviving the constant changing market of Las Vegas.",QSA05SquUKJZnxasypxvjg,4,2,3,nHHPYv66HQyMLJLK32Y2eQ

The rooms there are relatively small but comfortable enough for two.  Our room was recently rennovated with contemporary decor but lacked flat-screen hi-def tvs (no biggie, I wasn't there to watch tv).  The bed was actually pretty comfortable, the room was clean, and the noise level (outside in the hallways) was very quiet.  Room goodies were ample for two people for two nights.  They included two bars of soap, shampoo, conditioner, enough towels for two, hair dryer, safe, plastic cups, and a plastic ice bucket.  

One thing I appreciated about the Fremont is how the elevators are near the actual rooms--no need to walk five miles from the room to the elevator like at Golden Nugget.  They're also close to the front desk and casino.  Valet is also near the front desk, elevators, and casino.

Valet is quick, however I should preface that they only have valet and, their valet lot is SMALL.  Get there early to ensure you have a place for your car.  Otherwise, you'll end up parking at Binion's and carrying luggage across the street (and up/down garage stairway, their garage elevators were being maintanenced that week).  TIP: If you park at Binion's 3+ hours and hand your ticket to the guard it will be $18; if you ""lose"" your ticket, it is only $12 (make sure guard doesn't see ticket).

Inside the casino, there's a myriad of dining options.  The only venue I patronized was Lanai Express.  It is good, fast, cheap, and open 24 hours.  As the name entails, the food is mainly Hawaiian, Asian, and American.

I was very comfortable staying at the Fremont and recommend all to stay there if you aren't looking for as many ammenities and luxuriousness the Golden Nugget offers.",g89D3f_9GnTzHPNoxIpuKQ,1,0,4,c1VoLr39x1AYHToxF1VKTg

2921741,2015-01-17,6,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"First time staying at Fremont Hotel and Casino. Arrived at the hotel late Sunday night almost midnight.  Checking in for hotel registration was really quick.  It helps with a Vacations Hawaii package and seeing one of the agents from Vacations Hawaii. 

My co-worker and I headed towards the B Connected Players Club booth in which I received a Ruby card (yes I am a newbie to gambling) and she received the Sapphire card (occasional Vegas visitor).  I swiped my card at the kiosk and found out that I earned a promotion deal for a free caramel covered apple from Rocky Mountain Chocolates.

We then headed to the fourth floor to drop off our bags and luggage.  I noticed right away that there was no small refrigerator.  ""Really...how the hell we going keep our bottle waters cold"" was my reaction to my travelling companion.  Her reply, ""we can use a bucket ice and use the sink as a cooler."".   All I could do was shake my head.

After dropping off our bags we headed back down to the first floor.  As we were walking around I noticed two ATMs, few kiosks to check points or promotions on the B Connected cards, and a few redemption machines to cash in vouchers or break down a $100 bill.  I also noticed Dunkin Donuts, Lanai Express, Rocky Mountain Chocolates, Tony Roma's, Second Street Grill (I think), and Paradise Buffet and Cafe. There are a lot of slot machines....there's the penny slots, the nickel slots, the quarter slots, and the $1.00 slots.  I can't forget about the card machines, the card tables, the roulette and craps table.

Throughout our stay at the Fremont my co-worker (Emily K.) and I have been donating our money to the slot machines.  Lost plenty money and won a little.  LOL....at least we enjoyed ourselves.

Back to the room....there was dust on the ceiling,  Emily K. says that her bed was uncomfortable (my guess everybody likes the bed next to the bathroom),  and even though there is housekeeping every day it seems the maid does not dust the furniture or clean the bathroom mirror. Also when we first tried to turn on the television...it did not go on. We had to call the customer service to have a maintenance worker come to the room to turn on the power for the television. Who knew....we thought if we use the remote the TV would go on.

We were a little apprehensive after reading some of the negative reviews on here, but were committed to the stay since family was in.  But we found none of those reviews to be substantiated.

I called Fremont reservations and made the reservations within a month of my arrival.  This was my second time staying at the hotel within 6 months.  The hotel itself is old but the guest rooms are decent.  I found no problems at all with the rooms.  Very clean room and bathroom was small but clean.  The housekeeping people are really nice.  They always greet you when you see them in the hallways.  There is also always a security guard by the elevators going up, so always show your room key to them so they will allow you to go up to your room.

The casino area isn't very large which is very good so you don't have to walk far in between machines.  I have never played the tables so I can't give a review for that.  Surprisingly, not too many people were smoking in the casino so that was another big plus for me.  The only bad thing I have to say about the casino is that it's a bit dark.  It should have more lighting. 

We only went to one of the three restaurants in the hotel, which was the Paradise Buffet.  We went to the Champagne Buffet on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  For only about $13.50/person, you get a really decent buffet.  Its not as large as the buffets on the strip but it was a decent size for a small hotel.  Everything was good and even came with all you can drink champagne! 

We had problems checking in to the hotel.  We had to come back two other times to get our reservations resolved.  In the end, we were overcharged.  I tried to speak with many people from reservations to the hotel manager. Everyone was pretty helpful until I had to speak with the manager Jeff.  He was very uncooperative and was not listening to me when I was trying to talk to him. In the end, he could not resolve their mistake they made with my hotel bill so I am currently working with other authorities to deal with my overcharge on my credit card.

Room was very clean, a tad dark but very quiet. I requested something facing away from Fremont Street and they happily accommodated me with a 3rd floor room facing north toward the Downtown Grand. King rooms have plenty of room but I would imagine double bed rooms would be a bit snug. 

At first glance the bathroom seemed so tiny but really it worked fine. Plus having the counter area over the sink within arms reach of the shower made it really easy to grab shampoo, etc. 

The best thing about this hotel is how close it is to Fremont Street. It was literally 100 feet off the elevator out the door to Fremont Street. Compared to the strip where you may walk a half mile to get to your room, that made it so easy to run up to the room when needed.

Some might argue that The Strip is where it all happens, but old Vegas, IE the downtown Fremont Street Experience, is the real deal. Walking around old Vegas is like seeing the Blue Man Group without their makeup. This isn't the part of town for high rollers, it's more of a low(er) rent part of what used to be the go to place in this gambling mecca. In the heart of this beast is the Fremont Hotel and Casino.  Its front doors open onto the Fremont Street gala, a parade of would-be rappers, aging Elvises and all the tourists that couldn't afford to stay on The Strip. Not to say that the Fremont is cheap (about $70/night for a single), but considering its proximity to the all encompassing light & sound show that is Fremont Street, it's reasonable. 

 The rooms are newly redecorated and small, but functional, besides, how much time do your really spend in a Vegas hotel room when you have a world of excess only a few steps away. The staff for the most part seemed agreeable, but remember, they see it all, everyday, so if they are sometimes less than cordial, maybe you should try another dealer.  If you want to  take advantage of the Fremont's wifi, bring an extra $9.95 for every 12 hours (or just use your smart phone hot spot and save the fee). The casino, adjoining eateries and shops are all the same as everything else in the area. Maybe you'll get an especially good, or bad, blackjack dealer, but that happens everywhere. If you're looking for something a little older and more gritty than what The Strip has to offer, The Fremont might be for you. Vegas, baby.",fBkrenzBGpjUDiql5hxyGw,3,1,3,kQQ7y47qpqXYZDMrO9MkxA

I found myself wandering into the Fremont Casino to get my gamble on.  Though I am not much of a gambler (I know.. why even go to Vegas right?) I was enticed by the $3 blackjack they advertised.  I felt comfortable spending what I wanted to here... at a buy in that would make my money last for a while and allow me a decent amount of entertainment before I was broke.

In the end I came out even... but I was able to get a good couple of hours worth of play with just $50 or so.  Blackjack is blackjack... but what made this an enjoyable place were the dealers.  Having sat at a few different tables over my visit (not only here but at many other casinos as well), almost all of the dealers here were friendly, personable, and a joy to interact with.  This was not the case at some of the other places and as a newbie to table games, it is not so enjoyable when you have an intimidating dealer staring you down as you add up card totals in your head.  I want to win money... but I also want to have fun doing it.    

It is not terribly smoky in here... and the drink girls make their rounds frequently so you are never without something in your cup!

I did not stay at the hotel here so I am comment-less regarding that aspect of this establishment.  If though, you are looking for a laid back casino in the Fremont Street area with the option of spending as little as $3 a hand... this is the place for you.  (And this is straight up, $3 bets.  I visited some other places where part of your $3 had to be placed on special side bets that you were far less likely to benefit from.)  Some may ask, what could you really win when spending so little?  A good deal in fact!

3273050,2017-09-25,0,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"I have visited Downtown Las Vegas a couple of times now. But this was my first time staying at the Fremont Hotel & Casino. I did not know what to expect when staying at a Hotel Casino downtown and it definitely wasn't 4 or 5 stars. I guess I would've expected 4 stars. 

The room we stayed in was not anything special, the bathroom was worn down, and there was also no necessary amenities (I.e no fridge or updated safe for our belongings.) The safe has a key which didn't seem to be very secure.The bed is definitely not comfortable and after 4 nights staying in the room, our backs and neck started to hurt at the end of the trip. If you already have back or neck pain (as I already do) this bed will not help at all. 

There are no curtains in the room but it did have shutters that were not very helpful with keeping the sunlight in the morning. They also do not fold towards the wall to have more window ambiance. Some of the flaps wouldn't even shut all the way or stay up to let light in and look out. 

The bathroom was again worn down. The counter shelf in the bathroom was about to break off as well when we placed items on it. 

If you need WiFi, you will have to go down to the casino for free. If you would like to use it in your room, you must pay for it daily, which I find odd nowadays, especially when we are already paying the resort fee. 

Would I stay here again? Maybe. Depending on pricing when booking a stay.

Some rules/tips for playing table craps:
- when holding the dice, don't bring the dice above the craps table
- shoot the dice all the way across the table (both die must hit the opposite wall)
- drinks must remain below the table on the ledge and not above the table

Seems they lost the budget when it comes to the bathrooms.  The toilet is so tiny, and is like a urinal from a public restroom with the flush handle one uses their foot to flush.  The caulking job was done poorly with areas that were not wiped away cleanly as if done in a rush.

This famous street is second only to the Las Vegas Strip. The Fremont Street Experience was constructed almost 20 years ago and the Fremont Hotel & Casino is in the heart of the area.

Like most of the older hotels in this area, the casino is full of older machines. Some slots even return nickels and quarters, rather than tickets. Beware if you cash out with lots of winnings! It can take a while!! We have fun on these older machines. Most new ones don't take change so it's nice to walk by and put in the last quarter in your pocket or the dime you just found.

Great food deals can be found in Fremont Casino. Tony Roma's restaurant is in here, as well as some fast food places. Drinks can be found at casino bars or from cocktail service while you gamble.

I've stayed at a few of the downtown hotels, though never at Fremont. I generally don't stay downtown. It doesn't seem as safe to me and the parking garages don't have valets running by the cars all night. I instead stay close to the strip and drive to Fremont for the fun.

This time around it was nice and warm, I went for my friend's wedding, and we stayed at the Fremont.

Have you been wanting to go to the Phillipines? 
Do you enjoy cheesy-ness?
Have you been craving some Dunkin Donuts?

Well you have found the right place! Come on down to Fremont. It was really cute. Walking around the casino, seeing all the Filipino lolas gambling and complaining in Tagalog to their hubbys. Reminded me of my BFF's family parties.

I don't ever recall going to DD's so that was cool to try it. 

We finally get to the hotel at like 1 or 2am, we pull up and it's valet only. It was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because we didn't have to drive round and round, park, and lug our luggage 5 miles like on the Strip. Bad because it piled up and sometimes we'd have to wait long but oh wellz.
We walk in and the lady at the Counter is as SWEET AS CAN BE. Very nice, helpful, and just plain sweet.

This hotel lacks consistency. During my first stay, I was shoveled into a teeny-tiny room that reeked of smoke (the whole casino and lobby smells like smoke, but I learned quickly that some of their rooms do too). I left this experience with ALL of my clothes masked with a smoke stench (if someone closed their eyes they probably would have assumed I was a cigarette in the process of being smoked, I stank so badly). 
Anyways, the next stay, I got placed into this lovely non-smoking room. It was the same tiny size, but it didn't smell like smoke. It had a clean aroma. I preferred this room WAY more than the first. So if you don't like school maybe you should make a request for a non-smoking room.

Next, their staff is inconsistent. Sometimes the front desk answers the phone, other times they have you on hold for twenty minutes. So it really just depends on how busy of a day it is and the actual workers working. Also, this hotel only offers valet so you pretty much have to tip them every time you leave. But there's a lot of places near the Fremont so you don't feel like you're trapped with nothing to do. 

Overall, super cheap hotel, but your stay depends on the will of the almighty Vegas/Fremont gods. You literally roll the dice on Fremont and hope you get something good this time.",rJnAjH5cPyPs75DOJjCx7w,6,0,3,tWmNn_XolbBY5aQ0GkDc0w

Just got back from Vegas and my wife and her cousin had a really bad experience.
The whole trip they were excited to get crab legs at Fremont on friday night. They couldn't wait so when friday came, you could see the excitement on their faces.
My wife used my coupon from vacations hawaii and her cousin just paid full price. $15.99. Super cheap..
They started to get down to business and piling on the crab legs and clams. Well half way through the dinner, the cousin bites into a clam and finds a STAPLE in the clam. Yes, a staple. They both were like ""What the hell is this?'.
They call over to the manager that was standing there and told her about the situation. The manager had the nerve to ask the cousin if she put it there. They both were shocked at what she had said. They said 'no' but the manager didn't believe them. Come on lady, are you mental?
My wife and her cousin wanted just an apology and everything would of been okay but manager wench wasn't giving in. Okay, talk to the chef.
The chef comes out and was really sorry and kept on apologizing but I'm don't think he was using his noodle when he said"" Oh yeah, this kind of thing happens all the time. At least once every other month"" STUPID, you just admitted to having this problem and you're not trying to fix it. My wife and her cousin was laughing because they couldn't believe what these peolple were saying and doing. Nutcase manager and Stupid chef.
The manager is so pissed at my wife that she finally gives them a refund but not the $15.99 but the coupon. THANKS!!!!!!!!!! I guess she wants us to come back the next night.

We were going to be arriving at 2:00am and checking out at 11:00am and not one hotel I called would wave the ridiculous resort fee! I did a search to find one that did not charge and the Fremont came up and included free valet parking, $50.00 room rate, NOON check out, optional $9.99 wifi in your room (there is free wifi in the casino). 

We arrived at 2:00am and my husband checked us in and they actually gave us another $5.00 off the room rate as it was so late! We asked for a room on the quiet side of the hotel with no issue at all. The room was clean and the sheets were soft (and I loved the brand of shampoo and conditioners). The casino has a 24 hour cafe which was surprisingly good (at 3:00am) and the portions are very generous, a Dunkin' Donuts (breakfast) and a Rocky Mountain chocolate store where I had one of my favorite Carmel Apples. :-0 We also took the time to walk out to Fremont Street that is adjacent to the hotel. The only negative, there are no black-out blinds (a must for a Vegas Hotel) so it was very bright, very early. 

Now to all the other Vegas hotels who are short-sighted when it comes to a situation like this and won't wave the resort fee. Of course, we went out when we got there! We gambled a little in the casino and ate at the 24 hour cafe in the Fremont as well as breakfast in the morning, allowing the Fremont to make extra money off our visit.

The hotel definitely delivered on all of those promises. The greeter/security guard was friendly and helpful, directing us to where we need to go and giving us tips on the public drinking laws in the Fremont Experience area (get a plastic to-go cup and you're solid).

 The decor definitely has that old Las Vegas feel. Dark (I would even say dank), loud and with the smell of old cigarette smoke permeating the building. The patrons were mostly elderly slot jockeys and tourists like us who wanted a taste of that old Vegas sleaze from the mafia days.

 We hit up the Paradise Buffet and for a reasonable price we were treated to a very extensive selection of breakfast foods, including an omelette and pancake bar (made to order). The unlimited champagne and coffee/juice/water was continually delivered by friendly servers who regularly checked in on the status of our drinks (a contrast to more expensive buffets we visited on The Strip). We left them a generous tip as they certainly earned it with excellent service. The food quality wasn't anything very special, and I do question the lack of bagels when cream cheese, lox and capers were available, but that's a small quibble. After deciding that we've probably had enough champagne, we left to check out the rest of the casino.

 We stopped by the bar and got margaritas. As promised, $2 with $4 for doubles. Make sure to leave the bartender a generous tip on your first drink, they'll remember you and provide more generous pours when you come back. You'll know you've done it right if they're filling up your drink from the cheaper (but still just as alcoholic) dispenser liquor. 

 Seeing as we're not really gamblers but still wanted to say we gambled in vegas, we hit up some penny slots for fun. The payouts were up and down, but we ended up winning enough to buy ourselves another round of drinks. If I return to Vegas, I'll definitely be coming back here.

4387308,2010-10-18,3,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"Have you ever spent some time in Downtown Las Vegas?  Not the Strip but actual old-school Downtown?  This seems like the epitome of a Downtown Vegas casino.  

The Fremont Hotel and Casino is right there on Fremont Street...right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience.  We actually decided to stop by because during the show outside there was a sign that said something about texting a number to get 5 bucks in free slot play.  We texted the said number and got our confirmation number and headed over to the casino.  We got instructions on where to sign up for their club, waited in line and talked to one of the nice women working behind the counter.  This is the part that makes me realize its Downtown Vegas...all the women were the grandma type...even down to the little strap that holds their glasses around their neck.  

Here's the strange thing...to get your 5 bucks they had to actually call a supervisor on a radio.  After a couple minutes he came down and had to verify everything and enter a bunch of stuff in the computer for each of us.  If you have ever been to a place on the Strip this process is usually automatic and takes 10 seconds.  Not here, apparently they really need to regulate what little money they give you to play with.   They are also a casino that does not allow you to use your free slot play on certain machines.   Oh well...no sweat off my back.

The only thing that pissed me off was the fact that I really wanted to play one of the new Goldfish machines...the ones with the reels instead of the boxes.  There were three machines and one of them had a woman's husband just sitting there watching her play and then maybe once every 5 minutes spinning once himself.

Dude I don't care if you have no money but let someone else get in there and lose their money too!

I do not think I will be returning.  There are lots of other choices right next door that are not such a problem.

But then after the first night we regretted staying there and I was tempted to spend the rest of our budget on a room elsewhere.  

First the room does not have drapes.  It has shutters which are cute but they don't close fully so basically 24/7 the room is lit up.  The lights from the fremont st experience and other vegas signage lit up the room at night and early in the am the light poured in.  

Second, the air quality was horrible, this actually ruined our trip.  Every time we went to the room we would get congested and our throats would get sore.  Basically the hotel's filtration system wasn't working well enough so it poured smoky air into our non-smoking room.  We would be fine in newer hotels on the strip, when we were outside downtown etc.. but the minute we got in our rooms we had a rough time breathing.  Our luggage came home reeking of smoke.  

Third, the tv.  It wasn't the fact that it was an older small tv but it had only 3 stations with actual programming!!  I have never watched so many TBS movies in my life!  Our first sleepless night was spent tossing and turning watching Father Of The Bride over and over again.  The other channels were hotel advertising channels, spanish, and gambling channels.  We tried to rent a pay per view movie one night we came in early and it wouldn't work either!

I was excited at the deal I got but honestly our trip would have been so much better if we stayed somewhere else.  We came home tired, not from partying but from not being able to be comfortable in our own room.  Couple other annoying things were:  we were on floor 14 but the ice machines stopped at floor 10, the staff was rude in the gift shop and they were annoyed at the front desk that we interupted their conversation about lunch when we went to check out.  Also the cab rides to the strip were $20-$25 each way!  It was a lot further than we expected.

At $2 a shot, figuring inflation from the early 80's, 25 cents to $2 isn't bad, only this time you can actually win some of your money back.  I played for maybe an hour on $20.

The 2's company at the Cal coffee shop or the won ton min comes close, but nothing is more satisfying (and worth my 4 hour drive) than the Fremont's oxtail soup.  

The coffee shop in the Fremont is tucked in the back of the casino, where It shares the same location as their buffet.  

Our waitress told us that the California hotel and Fremont compete to see who's soup tastes better.  Take it from this transplanted Hawaiian, the Fremont wins every time.  Your bowl arrives full of meaty oxtail with a broth that is so addictive, it rivals a great bowl of pho.  

Take my advice and give this a try.  There are few places in Hawaii that serves oxtail soup everyday.  Be thankful the Fremont does, but only until 11:00pm. (i know, bummer)

ALL THE staff here is NOT friendly. NO self parking just VALET so expect to keep tipping. I went here during EDC week because this was sorta close where the venue was taking place & i got a good deal. However, during my check in i notice already off the bat the workers here are just not friendly. The second day being here the key card didn't work and i went down to request a new one at the front desk. They refuse to give me a new one and claiming my old one works -__- when i clearly told them it doesn't. They called the janitor to go check it out and the janitor kept telling them it doesn't work after several tries and i needed a new one. For a good 10 mins i finally got a new one, now was that hard? The third day i was short $1 to tip the valet driver handing her only $4 which clearly she was pissed about because she said a smart remark which i just ignored. Sorry not my fault this hotel doesn't have self parking then you wouldn't had to work your ass off hard enough to make ends meet. Honest truth. Overall i didn't have a good experience here because the staff is just not nice, i'm surprise the janitor who works a lot harder was the nicest one here. The rooms however are clean and nice but the bathroom is small. So save yourself the money and find a hotel that does self parking because just keep tipping valet drivers gets excessive.

The roulette table was incredible. We had a dealer from Ethiopia, who was a lot of fun and constantly put up with our rowdiness as the ball bounced around the wheel. We met a lot of fun people!

There was 1 outlet by the foot of my bed to charge my phone, which is annoying. I would have love the lamp on the bedside table to have an outlet. My coworker's room had no free outlets. And anothers room didn't even have a mirror besides the one in the bathroom.

I responded and asked what could be done to make our son's party great and if there were any complimentary upgrades available. No response. We arrive at the hotel and I send another email. No response. The last day of our trip and I send a final angry email. No response.  

Seriously, by the day after we got there we figured they didn't care about our party, just that we already paid our money and we were staying there. Fine. We decided to just have a good time. I did want to mention though that we reserved three rooms, two with a king bed and one with two doubles. What we got was three rooms with two doubles. The beds were extremely cramped and most of us ended up sleeping away from our significant others. The damn beds were too small for two people. Non-existent view. Smokey smelling rooms.

The Fremont Hotel is a short walk to the California, which is where we spent most of our time gambling in. You can also easily access the Fremont Street Experience from one of the hotel's entrances. 

We didn't get to expedience most of what this hotel and casino had to offer, like their restaurants for example, but as far as their hotel rooms go, it was a pleasant stay. You also can't beat a free room!",tmk9UysAEwAj0PA1icTJsw,1,2,4,Nvy38VGzJ1tX7zT3MRMrrw

Eric (whose last name should be I need training in hotel hospitality ) was working the front desk on October 17, 2017 at around 6pm. His rudeness towards me and inability to accommodate me should be an example of how hotels lose business and how you shouldn't judge someone by how they look. I have been coming to Fremont since 2004 because the service and casino is friendly and fun. Because of the actions of one employee using poor judgement I will now have a bad memory of a place I loved coming too. I want to say thank you to the lady who assisted me with my situation she should be commended for her thoughtfulness and good use of common sense. I will be contacting the hotel directly about my issue because as a local and downtowner we don't need people in the hotel business or downtown area making bad judgements to patrons who love their establishments. This was an avoidable situation and if the front desk of a casino doesn't have change or can't get change for a customer something is wrong! Like going into a bank and saying I'm sorry ma'am we don't have money. I do hope Eric gets some diversity and common sense training very soon!",ftdv1qPJqJ2ECgNdyO2J1A,1,0,1,IF-zHF2hTSbAuzRhpmvidQ

5644594,2011-03-29,7,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"I had never been to Downtown Las Vegas, I mean, why would anybody want to come all the way down here when they have all the nicer, more expensive, and swankier resorts on The Strip? Well reader, let me explain...

My boyfriend used to live in LV and he wanted to show me a side that my Orange County based ass had never seen. I came to see the Fremont Experience when I was a kid, and I remember it being dingy, old, and smelling of cigarette smoke. And despite the huge screeen-projector-roof thing above all the casinos, I remember never wanting to come back here. After some persuading (mostly having to do with the prospect of cheap games and fried twinkies), I caved in, shelled out the $25 cab fare and went.

To my amazement, they really cleaned and spiffed up the place! We arrived around 1pm and didn't leave until way later. We came directly to Boyd's Fremont Casino and found some awesome games, notably a $5 double deck blackjack game that paid 3:2! Good luck finding better rules and odds like that on The Strip! Other than the better gambling, the thing I liked about Fremont is that all the casinos have open doors, so if you ever get bored of one casino, you can literally go next door and see what they have without having to deal with a cab ride. Most of the casinos here are within a large outdoor promenade covered by a huge screen that projects cool shows at night. I had so much fun casino hopping and checking out the smaller stands in between that sell everything from sunglasses, spray paint artwork, souvenirs, frozen drinks, and fried food. After 6pm, there are even more drink stations, a stage is set up with go-go dancers and a DJ spinning music, and the entire area becomes a giant party!

Whenever you want to skip the haughty pretentiousness of The Strip, head over to Fremont Street for some awesome low roller fun! The people here are a lot more fun and down to earth, and the dealers here also love to have fun, talk to you, and are more than willing to help you if you're wondering whether you should hit on 16 or not. 

Just beware of the giant chilli cheese dog though. Coupled with copious amounts of cheap drinks, it seriously made me regret it in the middle of the night.",FzCEMuQZBD712YD2OvPJng,8,6,4,FdyOWYIYn8GtRnuVg-V-1g

5765518,2013-01-25,0,Ey1iEY8yAQG5MEBZPQ_niQ,"I've stayed at the Fremont Hotel & Casino a ton of times..........this is my parents all time favorite hotel. 
My mom especially loved to stay here, due to the location.........as the hotel was centered around many other hotels, and she just loved to hotel hop to do her gambling. 

Rooms are small, but clean..........nothing fancy at all. 

When I stay at budget hotels, all I ask for are two things.............

1. That the hotel room is clean. Check!

2. That the place is safe, & you will not get robbed. Check!

Boyd gaming runs 3 hotels in the downtown area.........the Fremont Hotel, California Hotel, & Main Street Hotel. All three are very popular with the Hawaii crowd.

Besides all the gambling & fun...........part of the Las Vegas experience is the eating too! 

One of my all time favorite things I like to eat is the Fried Chicken from the Fremont Hotel's buffet.

The buffet in the Fremont hotel is not as large, but has enough section of things to choose from. 

Last night - it was Steak night, and I went with my dad to have dinner. I wasn't there for the steak..........I was there for only one thing..........the FRIED CHICKEN (see pic)!

Ummmmm........Fried Chicken! What can I say............they know how to do it right! 
Big Meaty pieces of chicken, fried to perfection, & seasoned just right! If I could eat this everyday without any health ramifications.........I'd do it! :)

Front desk receptionist Melanie was unhelpful and rude. First, we had inadvertently made the reservation under 'Alex' while the name on the license is 'Alexander'. She gave us crap. Then, she gave us attitude when we asked for an extra room key. Later, we tried calling housekeeping for a rollaway cot, lo and behold, melanie picks up. Front desk plus housekeeping, guess her job does suck. Anyway, She told us it would be a ten dollar charge. I said hold on While I was consulting with the group, and she just hung up. Wtf. 

We were only here because my dad/his friends have status here and had ""free nights"". Although, as it turns out, a week night stay here only costs $36. No wonder they give out free nights like candy.

Ps. The place doesn't even have Internet. Seriously?

Newsflash: The older casinos smell like ashtrays - people smoke in there and have for decades! The buildings are very old, that's part of the charm of Fremont Street
If you don't know how to play the games - push the button that says ""Pays/Info"" - can't blame anyone else for not reading the directions. Do you think the employees have time to learn every machine and then teach every person that comes in how to play? 


We love it here!
Downtown is perfect for us! We love 'old Vegas' and spend most of our time here. Everyone has always been very pleasant at the Fremont, from the Chocolate Factory, through the casino and back to the restaurant. 
We go to the Fremont every time we are in Vegas, more than once.
This visit we had a waitress named Norma in the Paradise Buffet, she's been there 30+ years! The happiest my child looked the entire trip was while she was talking to him, making us both laugh hysterically!
When we left, we tipped her and folded up our receipt into a paper crane. She told us she keeps everything her customers leave her and that she has tons of folded paper birds, hearts, etc. that people leave her with her tips. We'll be visiting her specifically, every time we go back to Vegas.

Personally, I love the old style of the casinos downtown. People downtown are very low key and calm. The Strip seems to be more of a bachelor party, but downtown seems more family oriented. The bands interact with the kids, as well as everyone else. Except for the (mostly) naked people, this is our favorite place to be in Vegas.

I've never talked to anyone that was rude, short or unpleasant at the Fremont. In fact, quite the opposite!
Next trip, we'll be staying here for a couple of nights so that we can be close to the casino, which is our favorite place to play, the shark tank at the Golden Nugget, and my very favorite, the light show.
