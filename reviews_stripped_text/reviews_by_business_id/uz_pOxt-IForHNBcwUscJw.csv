Bartender came over & served promptly, but didn't introduce herself and didn't offer menu. We wanted to eat, but no menus out & bartender never came back. People loitering outside in and out of running vehicles (sketchy). Graffiti all over bathroom mirrors is a major bad sign for such a decent neighborhood. Read good reviews but didn't see evidence of why. Too many other places near by to take a chance again, sorry.",QnmGLFcTXkVR85YQBIJaXA,1,0,2,r11KlJ3swe17o9LmZ47mwQ

This is a gem of a place with reliably great food, service and menu selections.  If you're in the area - be sure to give them a try.

We sat ourselves in the restaurant area per the sign at the entrance. As we did, an employee at the far end of the room made eye contact with me and smiled so I knew he saw us in there, and let's face it, my daughter isn't exactly the quietest child on the face of the earth, so even the bartender in the next room heard her. We sat and waited, and waited and waited some more but nobody came...not one person. After waiting for 15 very long minutes, we decided we were hungry and it didn't look like we were going to get fed there so we walked out. I don't think we will be back, especially after 2 employees ignoring our presence.",Mao2y86IOhZFUBoRcJkJAA,3,1,1,OS7kXWrIRRJ3y3R4T6kkaw

I started with a house salad. It was great. Radish, cucumber, croutons, onion. Fresh. 

My only issue was that I ordered a chicken wrap and it literally had about 1oz of chicken. Like... Diced. Next time I'll definitely ask for EXTRA chicken because the wraps overall flavor was on point. 

I also had the asparagus, which I enjoyed. However $7.50 is too pricey. let's be real.

I would def come back- I just hope the owners read this and make note.",TfofCo_xEwY4am19d8lGYw,1,2,3,lADn_5fI1Qmq3VZrAcooaw

We also had the meatloaf with veggies and potatoes; the meatloaf had a nice flavor and the veggies were tasty. My husband had the California Melt; he liked it, it was good but he didn't love the waffle fries; he thought they  were too crispy. I thought they were good. They seemed like they were battered and then fried and i like that. Our server was attentive without being annoying. We love that this place is within walking distance of our home.

There has been some turn overs with the Bartenders here past few years. Food selections are above par, the machines are were lot more ""forgiving"" in the past compared to now. There are some relaxed bartenders here and some tight bartenders but once you get to know them they are all chill here. The shuffleboard is a great amenity here. They also have darts, buckshot and pool. Pretty good music sometimes depending on the bartender. Love the stiff drinks!! Kudos to you know who.

And has nothing to say other than ""it's the bartenders choice"". Well guess what if you don't like the music playing take it off the jukebox! I payed money for that. Terrible service for a local! This is prob why they keep changing names cause they suck. Their pool tables are crooked and the sticks are warped hiding behind the buck hunter machine and if you wanna play darts you're in the way of the people playing pool. Poor setup and crappy bar.

First off, they didn't tell us that they changed their large pizzas to ""all one size"". The large pizza is now a 9 inch personal pizza!! Are you kidding me?!? 
That barely feeds one person! 
They didn't give us our extra ranch for our chicken fingers that we asked for(and were ok with paying).
They gave us hardly any fries--the bartender was rude as hell too! He acted like he was being bothered. So sorry dude. 
We are in the food and beverage industry as well, we are great tippers and have been loyal customers that have spent a TON of money there this past year. 
New management--No Bueno!
