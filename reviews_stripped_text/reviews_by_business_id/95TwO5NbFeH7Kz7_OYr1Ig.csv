They look like shoestring fries, but they're battered and fried dill pickles!  So yummy!  Also loved the deep friend mac n cheese.  Are you seeing a theme here? These people know how do deep fry.

We came for the cheesesteaks, though (thanks to the Yelp recommendations), and they did not disappoint.  Tasty meat, nice fresh soft bread... juicy and cooked just right.

The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the EXTREMELY smokey bar attached to the restaurant, which you have to walk through to use the restroom.  Any time someone would open the door to go use the restroom, plumes of smoke would waft in and practically gave us black lung.  It was really bad.

But I'll be back!  I'll ask for a table as far away from the bar as we can get next time.... but I'll be back!",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,2,0,4,rd4dWdkr3-l6zj_ffAfKdQ

Eating the sandwich at Boodles wasn't the greatest idea either.  It's small and appears to have a regular customer base.  I've been treated on a contiuum ranging from indifference to hostility on earlier visits to Boodles.

1264268,2014-10-14,0,95TwO5NbFeH7Kz7_OYr1Ig,"Good news, bad news. Good news is that Triple Play is BACK! Bad news is that it's not QUITE the same Triple Play that I remember.

When I learned months ago that the Triple Play on Oakey and Decatur had closed, I was heartbroken. GONE was a great, smoky Vegas bar with beer by the pitcher. GONE was a pretty tasty cheesesteak.  And, worst of all, GONE was the best club sandwich I have ever eaten. 

But then I learned through Yelp that -- like the phoenix -- Triple Play had risen from the ashes and had been rechristened as ""Triple Play American Grill."" It's taken us some time, but my husband and I stopped by the new location today for lunch. And while the ambiance leaves a little to be desired, it's still the same great food that I love, even if the portions are a little smaller than I remember. (And no pizzas or ostrich burgers, old timers.)

Of course I ordered the club sandwich. And while it tasted as good as ever, it seemed a bit small. (Maybe that's just a false memory, because I still ended up taking home half the sandwich like I used to do.) The steak fries tasted the same, but that portion seemed a bit skimpy, too.

My husband had the patty melt with curly fries. Same great sandwich; same great fries. But, once again, the portion seemed a little smaller than before.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, but we were the only ones in the small, brightly lit place. How I miss the days of waiting for a booth in the darkened back room on Decatur! But this is now the Triple Play AMERICAN Grill, and you can sure tell by the decor. (All I can say is, USA! USA!)

We didn't order drinks from the adjacent Boodles Tavern, so I'm not sure if they offer beer by the pitcher. And we didn't order a cheesesteak, although that seems to be a popular item, if the menu is any indication. (Lots of different versions are available, and the restaurant's branding proclaims itself Home of ""THE CHEESESTEAK."") But our food was great, as expected. I just miss the smoky goodness (and tiny beer glasses) of the original Triple Play. 

I'm sure I'll be back; I just need to move into the future and remember the past with fondness. I'm glad the reincarnated Triple Play exists. But I still miss you, old-school Triple Play. (Sad tear. And ... scene.)",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,lNcx15GEtHVppt2nKf-rtQ

The Saturday bbq ribs special is beyond delicious. The ribs fall off the bone. The sauce is flavorful. It comes with coleslaw or potatoe salad and fries. I'm not normally a big coleslaw fan and I'm very picky, but this coleslaw is delish! It also comes with a pineapple delight/ambrosia, which to me is a perfect after meal type of dessert. 

The Saturday burger special is another great deal with a very tasty burger, with your choice of fries (steak, shoestring or curly), and your drink is free. The fries come unsalted, but they come out hot enough for the table salt to stick.

In any case, this place now specializes in cheese steaks- so we tried the 5"" Moe (grilled onions and mushrooms, my favorite combination) with curly fries and a 6-piece order of the buffalo wings.

Cheese steak was tasty- very literal interpretation of the dish, with plenty of shaved steak and melty cheese sauce woven into the entire sandwich. Onions and mushrooms were perfect, fresh roll it was served on held up without being too hard or too soft.

Wings were also decent- hot here would be considered mild anywhere else, but they were decently sized and had good flavor.

Mom had the crab melt sandwhich,  and shoestring fries. These days Mom doesn't have much appetite,  but she plowed her way through that sandwich like a champ!

I had the fried zucchini,  for starters. Best I have EVER had. Fresh zucchini,  hand battered right there, and deep fried. No frozen crap...amazingly good and crunchy. I could eat that every day. (But I won't :-)

I ordered the fish and chips, and again....best EVER. SO light and crunchy...not the slightest bit greasy. My mother is from England, and she declared them ""perfect"", and she's right. 

Jim, the owner, used to cook for The Triple Play on Decatur for many years until they closed. That guy can COOK. Then he made us (ha!) try his fried blond oreo's with salted caramel ice cream. Oh. My. God. When I die I don't need any food in heaven :-) except that.

My wife and I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE coming here for lunch.  Portion size for the money is on spot for starters.  Ive now tried the philly steak which I must say is awesome!!!!  The bread that it is served on is right on point!!!  I have also had the grilled chicken cheese sandwich with grilled onions!!!  Woah!!!!  I had that on the Kaiser bun instead of sourdough and lets say it's the best in Vegas.  Simple and full of flavor.  The chicken is made of breast meat and NOT dry!!!  Sides I have tried have been the steak fries and they rock!!!  Also I order most of the time as my side and that is the coleslaw man oh man!!!  It is made fresh, crispy crunchy cabbage not that bucket stuff but he makes this home made!!!  Served with a pickle wedge with your order.  Another point I must say on sides is i have had the onion rings.  They are a tempura style onion ring and hands down the best in Vegas!!!!  Wife has shared her burger with cheese with me and I must say, that Kaiser bun, 1/2 pound patty grilled to perfection is bursting with flavor!!!  It's a hole in the wall type of dive but the food is bigger than the place!!!  This is a must try!!!!  Dining room is not very big, but the owner just may need to expand if the trend of filling the place continues. We discovered this joint in December 2014 and go twice a week now for lunch.

I was looking at places near me with traditional american food.  Surprising to find out very few had a French Dip.  My first hit with one near me was here, so I ordered.

This was THE Best French Dip I have ever had!  Seriously, ever.  I always add cheese, they had a white swiss american sounded good so I went with it.  I also found out not all of the sandwiches or burgers come with fries, mine did!  I got the shoestring fries, yummy.  I brought my sandwich home looking forward to it but wasn't expecting this.  Opened up my box to a nicely packed meal.  One of the things I liked best about the packing is the sandwich was wrapped in paper so it wouldn't get all mushy form the steam from the fries my pickle was also wrapped to keep it crisp as well.  I opened my package of sandwich I have been thinking about for 2 weeks to a burst of the smell of roast beef.  Open my Au Jus to a nice clean broth the prettiest broth I have ever seen, it did not have a sticky layer of grease just beautiful aromatic broth.  

The sandwich was good it had a good amount of meat to bread ratio and then the angels sang into my ears as I dipped my sandwich into that amazing looking broth and tasted possibly the best Au Jus I have ever had in my life.  I grew up in the midwest and French Dips are a big thing out there so I have had more then a few french dips in my lifetime.  This broth was so rich and flavorful I closed my eyes and dreamed for a moment.  This sandwich was so good I have been back a second time in a 1 1/2 weeks time.  This Au Jus is a serious  thing, like Pho and Ramen if you mess up the base there is no coming back.  This Au Jus will make me become a regular, I am looking forward to trying other things but right now it's all about the Au Jus...

When I am ready I am looking forward to trying the Ruben next.

The Five Stars are for this sandwich and togo service.  The waitress on the phone was very nice and suggested this particular cheese.  When I came in to get my grub the cooks was an older man supper friendly and nice.  The restaurant part was like an old school dinner and had quite a few people in it eating a bit older but who cares.  Seemed very clean and you don't have the smoke from the bar attached to it because of the glass wall.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,11,6,5,0m3cR-uoFpUXRyNsHgtF-A

4764567,2015-12-12,1,95TwO5NbFeH7Kz7_OYr1Ig,"The staff was really nice, but the food was mixed.

My friend and I went here one night, because I had a half off coupon. When we walked in, we noticed the place was a bit smaller than we expected. It was quite intimate and quiet. I was sort of uncomfortable, because the other guest didn't smile at us or anything. They just stared and looked out the corner of their eyes.

The waitress saved us. She gave us a welcoming greeting, but then she swiftly walked away to check on her table, and we felt just ass awkward as before. I was confused on whether we were suppose to seat yourselves or wait for her to come back.

It took her a couple minutes to walk back over, so we went to the front and sat down. The waitress then came over and I asked if it was ok that we sit were we had sat. She told us it was fine and then passed us some menus.

The waitress was really nice and motherly. I felt like she wanted to TAKE CARE of us. I wish she had put the order in correctly and then she would have really taken care of us.

The waitress was confused on the coupon we had. It took her a few minutes and she even had to confirm with the man that was cooking the food. She mistakenly told us that we had to eat at the restaurant verses us just carrying the food out. The man/cook (possibly the owner) told her that there was no stipulation to where we ate. (It wasn't a big deal anyways, but she made it slightly a big deal)

So we ordered a 10"" cheese-steak with bacon Combo, with steak fries. It took a few minutes to get the food, but once we did, we paid and left.

In the car, where we usually eat, we figured out that we actually had curly fries verses that steak fries we originally ordered. It wasn't a really big deal because I like curly fries too. But, I was a little disappointed that my peppers were not on it.

The sandwich was pretty good. I like the bacon addition. I have never thought to add bacon and I wouldn't have ever tried it, if the waitress didn't tell me that a lot of people get it that way. Either way, I'm glad that I did, because that's what sat the sandwich aside from the rest.

I liked the curly fries but they tasted like any other restaurant. I would compare them to Arby's. They were nothing special.

Also, I ate the sandwich without mayo, I didn't notice until the end. It was that good, I didn't notice that it was plain.

In all, I would go back if they promise to give me what I ask for.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,3,1,3,i6F9FPCjuOqBhk8dE9_6lQ

This is the same Triple Play that used to be at the corner of Oakey and Decatur, until the buildings owners decided to worship at the godless altar of capitalism, and sold out to put in a garbage slot machine parlor! Just what local Vegas needs: more Jackpot Joanie's & Dotty's... But I digress!

I was in Philly this last winter, and ate the top local rated sandwich in town. That cheesesteak was great, and to be honest, I can't tell the difference from the downtown Philly sandwich to the Triple Play sandwich. Thin sliced steak, provolone cheese, onions and peppers. They have a fairly wide array of other food you'd expect in a bar. And of course there is a glass barrier that splits the restaurant from the bar, so smokers next door aren't an issue. 

I spread the word to a few co-workers that Triple Play is back, and all of them were super excited to be able to grab lunch here again! Bottom line, this is the Las Vegas Philly cheesesteak to have. Enjoy!",2cuoUfAC3rhRS3nj9cf0Cg,2,2,4,uhU4XTofiXlnd7xDeEuMLQ
