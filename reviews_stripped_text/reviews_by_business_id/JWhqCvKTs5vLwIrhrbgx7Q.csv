I came here thinking it would be nice to catch up with my brother and have a couple of drinks. We got here just before midnight and realized that happy hour was about to start. However, we ordered literally TWO MINUTES before and the waitress put in our order.  We then ordered other stuff that was on the happy hour menu thinking it would be all good since we were going to be here DURING the freaking time stated. Unfortunately, when we got our check, all of the drinks were not half price like they should have been, and when we asked the waitress, she said her manager quote ""said there was nothing they could do"". What kind of s**t is that?!?!?! Very disappointing. And speaking from someone who came here since they were a teenager before the place was a bar, I'm very upset on what this place has become.

However, their food is not that great... We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it sucks. and definitely wasn't worth 20 bucks for a pizza. Call me cheap, but I happen to find pizza places like hungry howies or lil caesars WAY better than this. We were even there at happy hour and our bill was still 20 bucks for just a pizza. Unless the pizza was originally 40 bucks, then i guess i got the happy hour discount, but i'm sure it wasn't. But after as long as it took for us to get our check, I didn't want to deal with the waitress because i didn't want to be there all night. Pizza took over a half hour to get there, and another 45 mins to get our check. It wasn't even worth 20 bucks in any way. It was flavorless, plain, yuck. We couldn't eat all of it so we just started giving them away lol.

The same thing with our buddies. He advised us to not order thru a waitress and go to the bar because it took forever to get his pizza and beer, so when we went to the bar instead, they wouldn't take out order because we weren't ""technically"" sitting at the bar. Way I look at it is... We were still in the bar area, so who gives a shit!?! so we had to order thru a waitress.

Moved out here close to 2 years ago and was looking for that pub or bar close to my home, somewhere that I can call home, and somewhere that would treat me well.  This PT's is located fairly close to me and was actually one of the first PT's I've been to.  My first couple of experiences at this location wasn't so good. I had experienced everything from bad food to poor service.  Nothing is worst than sitting at a bar and never being acknowledge.  At least twice, me and friends just walked out. We almost felt like they didn't care about new customers.  Then I started hitting up other PT's around Las Vegas to realize the issue was just this location. I had great service and a good food experience at other PT's.  I'm even at a PT's located in the southwest at least once a month.  Why can't I get that type of service here?  I almost swore that I would never come back to this location. 

Fast forward almost 2 years later and I decided to give this place a try again. Honestly, I was hungry one night, was in the mood for their ""Mardi Gras Chicken"" and didn't want to do dishes at home.  I told myself that if I got the bad service like I did the last couple of times, I'd never come back.   Well, PT's didn't disappoint this time.  Not only was the service 10 times better, but the food here was just as good as the other PT's.  I'm not stating that PT's has food to die for.  The food at PT's consist of your typical bar grill type food, which means usually fried food.  This is food you are to expect at a pub/bar anyway.  Their Mardi Gras Chicken, Wings, and Nachos are a must try though.   

6 times a charm I guess!  I just hope my last visit wasn't an anomaly.  We'll find out soon.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,2,2,4,6VITbeMxH7ASKk-hi0HYVA

I would like to give them 4 stars but their corporation is way too proud of their mediocre food and portion sizes. Food prices are way too expensive for what they serve you. If you want to run a good business then have your prices match your quality and portion size.",IJydtJew4wG9hKK9-AzI8g,0,0,3,cXNvofdIV5BFFeGNWTPbqg

Whenever my Air Force buddies are here form out of town, this is the place we meet up at. Everyone loves it because the ambiance is perfectly dim (to set the mood), there's always tables available (so far at least), never loud to the point of voice raising (I scream enough at drunks at work), and they provide two pool tables to throw down at. Happy Hour is very convenient to me (5pm-7pm) since i'm usually off the base around 4. Plus i have never seemed to have a problem ordering drinks here by far.

If you're around the area, let me know! :D",A1yK1QyPaahfwp38zqn2Bg,3,1,4,u3TMW1Z_Av-_svTMIKSSTw
4436880,2017-01-22,0,JWhqCvKTs5vLwIrhrbgx7Q,Poor service. I was excited to go and take my husband to this location for the first time. We understand it's a Sunday and playoffs were beginning to start at 12pm. We walked through the door at 11am and placed a order To go and for one bucket of chicken nuggets and fries. The waitress got the order wrong and only ordered a basket which was not what we wanted so we placed a second order for the same thing and waited or a whole hour. Nothing was done I finally asked the bartender to just cxl my order and refund me my money. She said she doesn't have the cards for that and her manager would be there in the next 20-30 min I finally get my order and the bartender says I don't know if you still want this but here is your order. We took our cold orders and left. This is the worst PT's I've ever been to. I would recommend you spend your time and money elsewhere. The bartender stated to us there was only 1 COOK on duty and 1 BARTENDER. That's why our wait was so long. FYI-not my problem or the other 30 patrons waiting for orders.,zmhRt4Sp1OAlQLbrM4RVBg,0,0,1,cCzV__GmCMNlnLt4Ts2bYg

All the staff is super nice and on top of your drinks. Beers are served on tall blast chilled beer mugs; super cold and crisp. Their food is sooo yummy. I personally love their pretzel bites with cheese and honey mustard sides. The burgers are also super juicy and delish. 

PT's has a Beer & Bites point program; a reward program based on dollars spent, points earned. I think the program is a cool thing because you get special discounts. My friend had her card with her and my humongus beers were like $5! I really enjoy my beer and watching TV at the bar. The TV screens are not huge and view sucks in certain angles but they always have a variety of channels playing.",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,3,4,4,JjOBtychVvPQQ1ack7tjOw

I'm generally the DD, so I don't usually drink and order a water, maybe some food. We stopped in around 930 PM on a Wednesday and it wasn't super busy but just enough to keep the lone bartender and server steadily moving. 

JD ordered a small summer shandy and some wings with curly fries. I just had a water with lemon and decided I didn't feel like eating much. This seemed to slightly annoy the bartender. The food took about 15-20 minutes to come out with the wrong type of fries, but the bartender realized this after a moment without anyone mentioning it and curly fries were brought out a few minutes after. The wings looked good! Decent in size and nicely sauced. Fries didn't seem soggy. No complaints from JD. 

A little 4 card keno while we waited and watched whatever was playing on their TV's. We were in there for maybe an hour. It's not a bad spot to unwind. I just can't stand how it wreaks of cigarettes and that I do after coming here too. The ventilation needs an upgrade.",mFHbNX5qhG5CREr9PqQqGQ,2,2,3,wz_uajMVj_iFEG6-1wImPw
5278153,2015-07-16,5,JWhqCvKTs5vLwIrhrbgx7Q,"This PT's location is quite popular with my previous co-workers, and I've been here a few times to attend late-night going away parties. Located off Centennial and Losee, PT's Gold is a solid local's bar. The bar is updated and always has plenty of seating. It's never smoky in here and the people that come here are the relaxed, quiet variety. My get-togethers here usually are timed perfectly to coincide with PT's Late Night Happy Hour, which runs everyday 12AM - 2AM with half-off drinks and select $5 appetizers. I've never had the food here, just beer! On my recent visit I enjoyed a humongous draft of Heineken for only $4 (HH)! Service is great here, even with a large group of people. I'm sure I'll be back for another bon voyage party.

When management has 1 waitress on hand at 730pm on a thursday? Pts sucks-but this was even bad for them. They make buffalo wild wings look like a 4 star establishment.

5837426,2015-12-13,0,JWhqCvKTs5vLwIrhrbgx7Q,"I was introduced to my first PT's experience by friends quite recently.  Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages, I cared only about the food.  And my experience was mixed.

I opened with a Fry Bucket of very good Beef Chili drenched in Cheese Sauce with Twister Fries, along with Port Stickers.  The Pot Stickers were pan-fried Pork Pot Stickers on a bed of Asian Slaw.  Both were very good starters.  But the appetizers were originally delivered with no silverware, plates, or napkins, and one water short.  I counted 10 televisions in one dining room, but all were silent.  

Alas, for the next round of eating, something was lost in translation concerning my ordered entree.  Instead of initially receiving Pastrami Reuben Sliders, I was presented with a Reuben Sandwich.  Since the latter sammie was prepared on Marbled Rye Bread, which I do not at all like, I elected to send it back to have my original order honored.  Eventually the sliders arrived, sporting mostly lean pastrami, sauerkraut, Swiss Cheese, and Thousand Island Dressing, along with a side of Onion Rings that were mostly batter.  The sliders were tasty and each bun had a nice soft split top.  

The Fry Bucket was almost a meal itself, and I discovered that good comfort food is served here.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,3,3,HnHAzJpg0RPBGY0K9rvGcw
