We had the traditional eggs benedict and the crab cakes benedict, with a delicious side of bacon (of course) and mimosas to drink. Everything tatsed amazing and our server Daniel was very nice and attentive. With no crowd at all and a great view and breeze from the pool it makes a great breakfast spot. The drinks are expensive but they give you your money's worth in strength.",QSgqFYswgG30nkBmauBzfg,1,0,5,UY3Lv7C5HzXUdNfZxDVlzA

The club sandwich is what I always get, I sometimes have them make it in a wrap which is also delicious.

1552386,2016-10-14,0,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"Poolside, small menu, and attentive wait staff. 

Love heading here for breakfast each morning. Recommend the breakfast Sandwich. Order it with extra aioli to dip your breakfast potatoes in. The omelet is also cooked perfectly daily. 

The drinks selection is standard for any pool bar and therefore doesn't effect my rating. However, the bar staff is consistently excellent. Have never felt like a drinks was over or under poured. Great quality and consistency.

Why a 4? There's really nothing that blows your mind. They meet expectations and are a great outdoor venue. Some make look at the small menu as a downside, I like that it keeps it simple and focused for my wandering mind.

If you're staying at the mirage, make the time to enjoy the meal and the setting.",nExd1MbKSD_SUP_5gueXLA,0,0,4,UoBnqwJ1PIBDZj6poQKmaw
2045248,2015-05-24,0,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"I read all the reviews and wondered if my husband and I had gone to the same place.  Granted we only eat breakfast there when we're going to the pool.  We've eaten there several times over the years and this year they changed the menu a little adding and subtracting items but it's just plain boring food.  Recognizing that scrambled eggs are just that, the other choices are limited to breakfast wraps and so on.  I tried the pancakes one day and that was a mistake.  They were heavy and tasted like cardboard.  This visit we went to the Roasted Bean inside and split a bagel instead of going to the cafe.  Way less expensive.",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,0,0,2,TxPF1bLkuHt_vdjb7ZJZ9A
2172267,2010-11-04,3,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"I grabbed a quick lunch here with a co-worker after we were traveling for what it seems like FOREVER. Since it was already after two when we sat down, we decided to get one appetizer and one sandwich to share. We started with Tempera Spicy Crab Roll and then moved on to the Triple Decker Sandwich. Both were very good and HUGE! The Tempera Spicy Crab Roll was my favorite. The only problem I had was that the roll was so big. It was so big that I couldn't fit the whole thing in my mouth - I literally had to cut it in half. The Triple Decker Sandwich was just as big, I had to eat it in sections. Great place to come with an appetite.",-hxUwfo3cMnLTv-CAaP69A,4,1,3,lRzn1gNanYAX3I2gXaja3A

3339583,2012-09-04,1,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"Its really this or another lame-ass option called dolphin bar if your by the pool at the mirage. Or you can put on a shirt/shorts and trek to the deli, cpk, etc. inside hotel. I know, too much effort.
It says don't feed the birds, but they are so hungry and cute, couldnt resist.
Food is pricey, big suprise. 
Ordered 2 items:
Shrimp and avocado salad: (1 star) not good shrimp, they are the tiny kind. It has bacon in it, very cold, fatty, nasty bacon. Never tasted such an awful bacon on a salad. Salad itself kinda limp so hard to find a nice crunchy salad. Its like 18 bucks too. RIIPPPed.

Steak sandwich was actually good, (4 stars) $16, came with a side of your choice (ask for the onion rings; they were puffy and tasteee. Horrible 4u but at least tasted good.
Steak was on a ciabatta roll, with arugula, mustard, cheese. A few unchewable parts but tasted like a rib-eye cut. Top with A1 and this is your highlight of the day presented by AT&T...
Another 50+ meal for 2 plates and 2 non-alcoholic drinks...goddamn this city...but those baby birds are soooo cuuuute!!!!",3YK7REruC4FwDTOj8zUYcQ,1,1,2,RYd4zSCh0gnEn7omCTBvUg

3613626,2015-09-27,0,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"This pool side restaurant is conveniently located amidst the Mirage pool for your dining retreat. My friends and I dined here in April 2014 after visiting the pool, not to swim but just take photos. It's open to Mirage guests only so we had to present the room key. We were seated immediately on a weekend with a good view of crystalline waters. It must've been at least 90 degrees out but we kept cool. I ordered a frozen strawberry smoothie that tasted like a slushie. I was hoping it would've contained yogurt or something to give it a thicker consistency. My entree was the club burger with bacon, not sure if it had avocado or not. Their potato salad is really good! Flavorful but not over the top in its richness. It was a welcome change from regular fries, which were tasty as well. My friends ordered the volcano burger featuring a whole fried egg, the unique veggie burger made with a messy mix of black beans/corn/onions, and the fried yellowtail tacos. 

As far as I remember, our waitress was very patient and checked back regularly to see if we needed anything else. Lunch poolside is quite a treat!",IQ1c1pePjdru5pc8hdsdVQ,1,1,4,Wi8FuXzSUUGtG7_Ve164DQ

Is there such a thing???)!   I had my usual ""American"" breakfast....two eggs scrambled with extra crispy hash browns and sourdough toast (the bacon was donated to my husband).

I was promptly seated with a good view of the pool area and the waterfall there.  No sooner than I sat down, my server Cathy arrived with a tall ice water.  She also broguht me an iced tea that I wanted.

 I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich and I mentioned that I could always take half the wrap home with me.  Cathy pointed out it was a ciabatta sandwich.  I asked her if they could do it as a wrap and she replied that she didn't see where that would be a problem.  For a side, I got fries.

The wrap was excellent, filled with much turkey and bacon and the fries were a good accompaniment.  I did not get dessert.  Instead, I got a to go box and took half the wrap and some fries home.

It was so pleasant sitting there and watching the tourists--one of my favorite things to do in this wonderful city!  Even though the temperature was in the high 90s, the outdoor restaurant was pleasant.  They have a very good misting system.

Since I have a year's pass to the Secret Garden, I think I'll stop more often during pool season when I go to visit the animals.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,5,4,u0FPXuUlPX6blkGKTyXgVA

4248174,2018-05-11,0,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"Absolutely LOVE this place. Located adjacent to the Mirage pool, this is a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch. Personally, since the pool gets crowded I like to ""hold"" my chairs by the pool by putting some towels and personal belongings on them (sunscreen and water cup) to save them, then head here for meals. There's plenty of shaded seats for when it's warm and uncovered spots for when you want to continue your tan. All servers are attentive here but Brandon is exceptional. If he's your server, you're lucky!

All meals are decent portions, reasonably priced and they have a fair amount of vegetarian and gluten free options for those with dietary restrictions. 

Of all pool restaurants, this one is my favorite (just beat the MGM pool) thanks to the service. If you're staying at Mirage, you need to stop by!",vzPR2TyOumxXClEMGI4s3A,1,1,5,lGDIIJOsAWIC8Q5iPkjwmw

We ordered the Cuban Panini. It was served very quickly. And it was delicious. They are thinking about adding it to their menu but right now it's just a Special. It was good, tasty, and the cheese was melted nicely. It came with black beans with cheese and French fries or plantains. I got the French fries. 

I would eat here again. Good food and good service.",dXCcQD7RyStWmmG-8hkiPA,2,3,4,twZeJ2yAxjdiknTCUpa1Hg
4847423,2017-11-18,3,AKBSPjk_H_w8RCqCE_vUuA,"On our first afternoon at The Mirage, we came here for drinks & shade on a still-warm October day. Later during my stay, I realized there's a separate poolside bar where service is much more prompt. However, here at Paradise Cafe, service was definitely lacking. In spite of many empty tables, we waited at least 15 minutes for a server to approach us after we were seated by the hostess. And then we waited another 20 minutes for our cocktails. At a resort where even the free casino drinks are quickly served, that kind of waiting seems unusual. But the drinks were decent and the ambiance ideal, so we ordered a second round and enjoyed the afternoon.",lUO6ba9f952pc-wlIpnpVA,8,6,3,e0o9TkQ105dnFM6Nt-l2hA

Typical Vegas restaurant just like the rest of the the strip all pricey and but the food was excellent and the service was perfect. I ordered the Buffalo Wings $12and French Fries $8, onion rings $8 and glass of ice water. $0  

After the waitress took my order, I received my glass of water right away and my food came 15 minutes which isn't too bad and the servers were always checking up on me if the food was ok and if I needed a refill. The buffalo wings were perfectly cooked an the sauce was just right and not too spicy, the onion rings were deep fried and very crispy and so were the French Fries. I felt very taken care of and looked out for and that left me with a good impression on the Paradise Cafe but the price is a little to high for the kind of food ordered but hey    IT'S VEGAS!!  

The waitress said we are allowed to bring food from the hotel restaurants (BB Kings, BLT, CPK, Carnegie Deli and Blizz from Yogurt) and not every hotel allows you to bring hotel food to the pool or even bottled water. So that was a good tip. =)",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,2,0,5,RSyKNJNruHGfM2jOHfFYIA
