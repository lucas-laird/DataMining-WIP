Every time I order the Mexican Pizza I always ask for Light Sauce and I end up getting Light on Everything! But this time they actually did it Perfect!! DELISH!! Made me want to order another one.

I don't eat meat and they were very easy about making anything on the menu with beans instead of meat. The food is fresh and very clean which is important in fast food.",-6sK3CL1g1OP1FMawX2hxA,0,0,5,6gZb2Yl_XbPdtpw-JX7w6w

 My son wanted some tacos so we went to taco bell.

 What can I say it's a brand-new taco bell. It's always nice to eat in a restaurant that's new. Just what you would expect hot fresh and fast. Hasn't changed much some new items. Still the same taco bell. Quick fix for food",K3pn8ImP4Q31ZrthJXJRHA,0,1,5,diwhqMGVsvsgd_WiQlPGBg
4035549,2018-04-16,1,wK9FufvwR6LGhpts8o_ayA,"I absolutely love Taco Bell's breakfast, it's a secret passion. I ordered the egg grilled burrito with hash brown and an extra hash brown on the side. It was so delectable and nice and fresh. The staff was at the counter when I came in and believe it or not this restaurant has more foot traffic this morning inside than in the drive thru. In fact there has been no drive thru cars since we were here. 

My twins are with me and wanted regular tacos lucky for them the whole order is available. They were so good I had to have a bite . They even have gotten classy here by asking ones name to call out the order. They even brought our food and other patrons orders to them. Bravo For the highly specialized service",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,1,3,5,1KumlMtMfm9k_k-MWYlktA
5283132,2018-04-27,0,wK9FufvwR6LGhpts8o_ayA,"American Taco Bells are light years ahead of Canadian ones in terms of quality, variety, and value. For under $9 including tax, got two cheesy potato burritos, 3-layer nachos, beefy fritos burrito, and an apple empanada. Everything was freshly made (although I've had even fresher, like piping hot ""they just killed the cow"" fresher). The cashier was friendly with a big smile but she seemed to be beefing (yeah, I went there) with a customer and sarcastically said ""thank you"" at her. Lots of parking at this location as it's part of a bigger plaza.",VDzKTMdqSz-BZ3lVYqmJNA,0,0,4,opahSREGr5OucIRcczM8vw

Also hire people that actually has experienced in the kitchen. When I was ordering my food I lean over to see who was making my food. That guy likes like he was on crystal meth like wtf!,7DgYqBMwENXqNA0grUxVaQ,0,0,1,PSZEsLvnoQRvxy9URJW8tQ
