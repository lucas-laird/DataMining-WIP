45519,2010-08-24,0,ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag,"Zabas is a fast food joint leaning towards the more American Mexican food. I am never disappointed when I go here because they are quick making your food and they have more of a variety to choose from. For instance, they have tacos and not just chicken or steak but shrimp or fish. Not only that but you can make it into a Zaba bowl. A Zaba bowl is your choice of meat with white or brown rice, beans (pinto or black), salsa (mild, medium or hot), sour cream, cheese and lettuce. Sounds a lot like a bowl at Chipotle, which yes they are very similar but Zaba's has more to choose from which is a plus. 
The prices are cheap ranging from a $1 something to $7 something. 
I highly recommend the bowls, fish tacos, and nachos. Might I add that the nachos is with white cheese sauce, it's really different from any queso I've tried and your choice of meat.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,1,0,5,-QN1VVO6Ow6Uh5VQDscPCw

Plus, they serve beer. Definitely not attempting to be authentic Mexican, so if that's what you want, go somewhere else. But, they're really good for what they specialize in. Also have lots of options being my gf is vegan they have a all vegetable burrito and you can add potatoes or even sweet potatoes. They also have an option for fish tacos or fish burrito which is great. I usually got to chipotle but this is a great second option esp if your looking for fish or potato tacos.

Atmosphere is relaxing, and it's a clean place and is decorated brightly.

I had the burrito with the whole wheat tortilla which was much better than expected. Had the usual ratio of fillings and for me I wish all these places were heavier on the meat, but I guess that's the way it goes. It also got very messy which is why I guess people order it in a bowl instead!

I have eaten here as many as four times in one week. Four! I highly recommend the shredded beef salad with hot salsa, fajita vegetables and guacamole. It is paleo-friendly and delicious.  They raised their prices a few months ago, but this is still a great meal at a reasonable price. They don't make their tortillas like Cafe Rio, but I don't eat the tortillas anyway. I don't care for the chicken at all, because it includes the leg and thigh meat and I prefer white meat only. It is a little thing, but I just can't stand it.

3829643,2010-10-13,4,ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag,"Was going to do an afternoon study session at the Starbucks next door and stopped by this joint for lunch.  If you close your eyes and walk in the door, you couldn't tell if you're in a Zaba's, Chipotle, or Q'doba.  What the hell are these chains doing?

Back to the experience....I ordered a Steak Burrito w/Pinto Beans, Rice, Cheese, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Salsa, and Hot Sauce on a Whole Wheat Tortilla.  Of course the Guac was extra.  I also ordered a side of Chips & Queso Dip.....yeah, I was hungry.

They make it in front of you, so there's no wait.  Had a bottle of Water to wash it down.

The Burrito is so/so.....it ranks a distant 3rd behind Q'doba & Chipotle for me.  The Steak was a little tough and didn't have much flavor.  The Hot Sauce/Beans/Guac had all of the flavor.  The Whole Wheat Tortilla was tasty.....don't know if it was healthy, but I'm going to just tell myself to believe it was OK?

The Chips & Queso Dip were very good.....but I was gaining poundage with each bite.....started to regret ordering it.....tasted awesome, but felt guilty consuming extra calories.

Overall, it was OK.

Will I return?  Eh....maybe.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,7,8,3,K4sSh8eTOUHuhhqvhpWkfw

4054635,2013-06-18,3,ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag,"I'm in this area a lot for work and can't believe I never seen this place.  Zaba's is sort of hidden, but once you find it, it's on.  You can pretty much get the same dishes that a Chipotle carries, but in my opinion, it's fresher here.  I love restaurants like this where the service is good, the ambiance is chill, and the menu is easy.  Because it's my first time, I ended up getting their shredded beef taco, chicken taco, and steak taco.  All were wrapped in corn tortilla.  I kept my tacos basic, with just a hint of cheese on each and that's it.  No lettuce, no sauce, no guac, no anything else.  Okay, I lied.  I may have had some sour cream added.  My tacos were seasoned and full of flavor.  Out of the 3 tacos, I think that the steak held it's flavor best.  As for price and size, these aren't your small street tacos.  These tacos are bigger and the prices are well in my budget.  Lets be honest, I think I could have eaten 3 more not because of the size of these tacos, but because these tacos were so good.  One day I will be back to try their nachos loaded with chicken or one of their ginormous burritos. I think it's obvious, I am a fan. Need to thank the GF for this one.  If it wasn't for her, I'd still be missing out.

I know it's not ""authentic"", but It doesn't stop it from being good.

What I really like about this place is the healthy options.  Whole wheat tortilla, brown rice, sweet potato's and so on.  So until I go visit home again and I'm in the mood for some Mexican food well this is the place I will keep coming back too.",30Apfs9u9-kqQE4qHEWqUw,2,1,4,deD6apEOWlYpqxNcdhkmKA

4623692,2012-08-31,0,ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag,"I love this place for quick bites. I first came here when I had a groupon, but that was more than a year ago, and I haven't been back since. Why? I love a good deal: coupons, specials, sales, etc. however, zaba's doesn't offer any of these things (to my knowledge), so it took me a long time to return and pay full price.

Speaking of full price, their prices are pretty hefty for a fast food joint; I spent about $17 on a chicken salad and a massive shrimp burrito. 

Each of the items were large and filling. My sweetie pop and I shared them both and still had leftovers. The shrimp was cooked fresh, but the chicken tasted a bit old and dried out.

All of the other fresh ingredients that you can add (think Subway) are both healthy and delicious. Of love their sweet potatoes, black beans, fajita mix and brown rice most of all.

I don't know if this is just how they do the beef, but while it had decent flavor, I'm not in a giant hurry to eat cold tacos again. Besides that, the carnitas are pretty good (and warm) and the steak is quite good (also warm). The have an assortment of salsas, including a corn salsa. Since the others appear to be fairly heavy on the cilantro, I only ever get the hot. I can't speak to how good the others are, but I really dig the hot. It's got a good balance of heat and flavor. I'm a little bummed that they don't offer chopped onion, jalapeños or black olives, but that's just me.

5390848,2012-07-22,1,ZtdCS8XjmL4P6BvMOIQWag,"I've been a fan of Zaba's ever since my college days when I used to visit the original Flamingo location by UNLV on a weekly basis, and sometimes much more often.  Later after I moved out of my parents house the location on Eastern and Silverado Ranch became the location of choice as it was close to my house (nothing says freedom like driving yourself to get a massive burrito).  I still find myself going to that location quite often, and now I mix in the Rampart location for lunch as it's closest to my work.   The moral of the story: I've been eating Zaba's regularly for over 10 years, and have no plans on stopping anytime soon.

Zaba's vs Chipotle is a no brainer to me.  I find Zaba's meat and rice to have much better flavors overall, though I will admit I'm not much of a fan of Zaba's carnitas and that's the one thing I prefer at Chipotle.  The chicken at Zaba's usually has this salty crust on the outside of the chunks that I just love that Chipotle doesn't replicate, and though I love the Barbacoa at Chipotle the Shredded Beef at Zaba's is a slightly superior version in my opinion.  Never been a fan of the steak at either place, as I usually find it overcooked.  I love that Z's has a wheat tortilla option and has always had Brown Rice as long as I can remember, because I like to feign like I'm eating healthy when I'm shoving a 3 pound burrito in my mouth and washing it down with a bag of chips and a giant Barq's root beer.  Those are my own personal choices though and the point is you can construct some healthy offerings here if you so desire.

I do tend to do Zaba Bowls however when I go and don't wish to gorge myself, with Brown Rice, Black Beans, Chicken, and either the medium or hot salsa.  The medium salsa (it's green) is the best salsa available  Then I like to take the chips (which are FAR better than Chipotles chips) and make some sort of super nachos out of the bowl by generously scooping.  I've also been known to occasionally get shredded beef in the bowl, and sometimes tacos, and if I'm really hungry, burritos. I like nearly every option except for the salad because I avoid lettuce whenever possible, and I tried the quesadilla years ago and found it very greasy and difficult to eat (they probably have improved)

All that being said, this specific location doesn't quite get the full 5 stars from me because sometimes they seem a little less prepared than I'm used to at Eastern, and the guacamole has seemed a little runny the last few times I've eaten there.  I'd still take it over Chipotle any day though.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,2,1,4,b87bcGGzAT5TPW2QfeWgow
