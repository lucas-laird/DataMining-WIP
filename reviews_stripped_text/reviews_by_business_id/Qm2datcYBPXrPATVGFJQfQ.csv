This place has everything from burgers to pizza and, of course, kabob. We got a small pizza to go with our kabob plates and it was so worth it. The pizza was simple yet so satisfying. The kabob plates were full of flavor! The beef kabob plate was thoroughly seasoned and comes with a salad, grilled veggies, hummus, pita bread, and of course the kabob itself ($10.99). All the items we looked at were priced just as reasonably. The service here is also great. The server AND the cook both took the time to cater to whatever we needed. They checked up on us often. They were super kind and friendly. The environment is also really clean! I definitely recommend this place for when you've got people who are craving different things. I'm definitely coming again in support of this local business!",i1PPLOF5Bc7_mVx__5k_xg,0,0,5,D1RHKiaUwhjqDZ_cyYCctg

2557569,2017-11-02,0,Qm2datcYBPXrPATVGFJQfQ,"I have ordered off eat24 about 5 times now.  The food is fresh, not greasy (not even the fried food is greasy) and everything tastes natural and wholesome, not processed.  The pita bread is great but goes stale within hours sometimes. Some of the items I have tried are completely addicting and I could eat them every single day.  

I would love to give this place 5 stars but with every single order there has been something wrong or missing, usually minor, but the last order a couple of days ago did not have the extra topping I had ordered (and paid for!) on my pizza, which left the pizza kind of bland and just simply not what I had asked for, so I didn't even want it anymore ($ wasted).  Again, fairly minor but hugely disappointing.  

Food is great, but this place would probably be better in person so if there is a problem it could be corrected right away.",dEX7N3idbwcEb18l6Oifug,0,0,4,DJ0Nxz4nMXCAy7UGK7YfTw

Their employees are friendly, their prices are very reasonable and their menus have a large variety. Their subs are delicious and their chocolate cake was amazing. I recommend this new joint to anyone on the eastside of town.",kxKL3lwgCHFzqMUnt37pkA,0,0,5,aSmMnJZSo-uOMnpawZDivA
3200408,2017-09-19,1,Qm2datcYBPXrPATVGFJQfQ,"Eating here for the third time in three days!  My wife had the wings again as she was craving them. I tried the Beef Kabob plate. I know absolutely nothing about kabob's so I really don't have any reference to judge them. That being said, I found them very tasty. A little bit of zip to them, but not overpowering. I'll definitely have them again. I'll be trying the chicken too at some point. The hummus is real good. Not runny, not too pasty, a real good consistency. Still 5 star!!!!",LXLpxQAUz2Nu4o_OjOWl_A,4,1,5,WNKOnhJbOSICJnv9e2cVpQ

Could not eat it. I will give it another shot for chicken kabobs and next time I will try the wings people always deserve another chance. I hope it's better next visit.",4pc_EyanaC3ARh0MZZyouA,1,1,3,WqPoGbY8w8awtOXcv4OVjg

I've ordered the Gyro with Lamb and it was really good and the ingredients were fresh and I would order it again.  The place is small, clean, and is new to this area.  The food is reasonably priced and was served quickly.  I would recommend this place for a quick bite to eat.  They are located behind Arbys and hard to see from Nellis.  I plan to return and try other items listed on their Menu.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,0,0,4,T1PTg-IinOZytvkqTWDqtw

I feel confident I will enjoy other items on the menu. Seems this place is known for the kabobs. My second time around I tried the shrimp and breaded cod with potato wedges. So good!!!

I didn't care for the wings, but probably would have liked a different flavor better, they were a bit bland (mild). Look forward to trying the kabobs.
