Service - 3 stars. Our sushi chef spent most of the time we were sitting in front of him watching the game on the TV. Our waiter was fairly attentive. 

Drinks - 5 stars. There was a nice list of sakes including flavored sakes such as apple, Asian pear, and plum. There were also a range of other cold sakes. You can also get a tasting flight for a very reasonable price. 

Food - 4 stars. The presentation of some of the dishes we ordered was sloppy and lazy. But the flavors of others were fantastic. My husband had a cajon roll and I had the fire roll. Both very tasty. We also ordered the tempura vegetables (delicious and not greasy) and Mongolian beef (okay flavor, but mild).",Tso_fYB9HX_O0rj5Jl8W4w,0,0,4,ifIANflLI13Lj-R854KyFQ

Bitter melon with beef on black bean sauce is a mild flavored dish the way I like it, balanced but not overwhelming. You can eat it straight without rice. The Hong Kong style noodles seafood combination hit the spot especially the tender scallops but not a fan of the chicken. I didn't try the lamb pot but it look fantastic! 

The service was friendly and accommodating. Very nice ambiance and layout. Overall a very present dining experience and would like to come back again to try other items, especially the sushi on the menu.

We are particular about our Chinese or Asian Fusion food. The service was outstanding, with our waiter at one point taking the time on a busy eve to sit down and explain the ingredients in some of their dishes.

Sushi presentation and freshness is up there with the best of them. We almost didn't want to eat the sushi as they were true pieces of art. Their hot dishes screamed of freshness. It was a pleasant surprise tasting the food without the overuse of oils or brown gravies. 

I was not surprised to find out they were union as they seemed well trained and schooled in the art of fine service.

964268,2008-09-26,0,6s7uduX1Q1KSjOKvwxYkRA,"Color me impressed, at least with the Chinese food.

We first ate here on impulse, after catching 2 movies in a row at their theaters upstairs. This place opens till 2am, which is really great!

The best thing here IMO is the double pan-fried noodles. It's not often that the chef successfully creates the crispy outer edges while the rest of the noodles have just the right ""mouth-feel"" to them: a little bite, a little chewiness. The sauce is just about perfect, not too cornstarchy. 

A close second is the hot and sour soup. Trust me, it really is above average, almost better than my mom's (heh). 

The kai lan (Chinese broccoli) was also very good, plump and juicy. My less adventurous companion likes their lemon chicken, which is alright, but not great.

They have some good lunch specials and late night specials (half-price on some items after 11pm, including hot and sour soup, yay!).

In all, a better Chinese dining experience than some on Spring Mountain, which is a very pleasant surprise!",0QWFZv01CFfUvpcnhQBfLA,2,0,4,JXXQH9ZPB8mRcWgbOCwv9w

I also had this delicious chicken lettuce wrap appetizer. It is chicken, mushrooms (which I could not taste thank goodness), green onions, and water chestnuts all mixed in this type of sauce that tasted like teriyaki and something else I couldn't quite think of. I forgot what the menu said, but it was all on this leaf of fresh lettuce, finger lickin good !

I also had some black tea, which is not something I normally like, but this was not too bad. Their sake selection is pretty decent, though I did not try any this time. They also have some creative beverages on their mixed drinks section. 

The price is pretty steep depending on what you get. I would say look at about $50-60 for three people, if you do not get sushi. Our waiter was very nice and honest! We had asked him what something had tasted like and he said he has never tried it, which was interesting, but at least he was up front about it.

Well, no.  This place is waaayyyy overpriced for what it is.  It's not surprising, since it's Vegas.  Seriously though, the prices were similar to NYC and this is not NYC, mmmmkay? Plus, the spicy tuna did not have the mayo.  It was just straight up tuna.  We also got the spider roll, the crunchy roll and the unagi roll.  They were all pretty meh, except for the unagi.  

Also, since we found this through the AAA book my dad had, we discreetly asked if there was a discount for being a AAA member.  I don't usually ask for discounts, but my little brother was hungry but was hindered from ordering more because of the prices, despite my assurances that I could cover it.

Walnut Shrimp - crispy, fresh, large shrimp with a very good slightly on the sweet side mayo based sauce.  

Seafood and tofu hot pot - it's actually ""clay pot"" but they call it a hot pot on the menu, I think.  This one is solid and super tasty with lots of seafood, fish, shrimp, calamari, veggies, peapods, baby corn, big peices of fried tofu.  Always tasty and consistent.

Sautéed baby pea shoots - tender, garlicky and yummy.  Most places don't pick through the leaves well and leave a lot of tough stems in there.  This place does it right.  It's all tender and good.

Beef Chow Fun, Dry - tender, well marinaded sliced beef and wide rice noodles which the perfect texture, not too soft and mushy and not dry and undercooked.  We always order this and everyone loves it.

Dragon roll - It's a pretty good sized roll with a lot eel on top.  Very good made well.

I find their service is fast, friendly and great.  Food orders are accurate and water glasses are topped off.  Can't ask for more than that.",wysnwzsy0EcPHw-5a4mAUw,1,0,4,SyZJk5ruuq9AmKO3w9FuNw

They were talking about how the Orleans needs to have a VIP section for them. Really? The Orleans? Come on ladies, this is like a C-list hotel, and D-list sushi restaurant. 

So on to the the food. I ordered 2 rolls, the Who's Your Daddy and the Domino Dynamite. They were pretty Americanized rolls, which was fine really. They weren't bad at all, no qualms there. My boyfriend got the Orange Beef, and was surprised it didn't come with vegetables. But it was very tasty.

The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chicken and shrimp and onions and peppers were cooked perfectly and tossed in the noodles. One of the top Singapore noodles dishes I have eaten. They also include a colorful red dipping sauce that can bring the heat if you douse too much on there. No soy sauce should be used on these noodles.

Or almost have too assume with the popularity of AYCE only way sushi joint stay in business. It not only sushi/japanese food other half of the menu is chinese food.

We ordered food family style. We got little bit of both sides mention earlier. Lettuce wraps (come different choice of proteins; we went with shrimp) actually pretty solid dish. I like the crispy fresh lettuce. the filling was nice, nice portion size, and the sauce put too taste brought it all together. The beef with chinese broccoli. Ok. Sushi special or basically assorted sushi. One order of spicy yellow tail cut roll. The sushi rice was ok had better. The quality of the fish felt was just ok. If wanted too have chinese food was go too favorite chinese or sushi same case.

We both felt like the restaurant was kind of hot. Maybe the a/c was broke or the fact the place has really low ceilings so not much breathing room. Service was definitely five stars our waitress was on it. She apologizes few times since our beef with chinese broccoli came up late late. She really nice, and made sure never had empty glass came too my soda. They have few widescreen television on sports at the sushi bar.

The sushi itself is pretty good - nothing too inventive but a couple off the wall rolls.  The tun on the rainbow roll was super fresh and the wasabi was pretty delightful as well.  I've only had rolls here so I can't comment on the Chinese portion of the menu.

Service is usually hit or miss but I think they do their best - could just be an understaffing issue.  The prices are a little high - I mean, the restaurant IS in The Orleans, not on the strip.  I expect them a little higher because they are located in a casino/hotel, but I just thought they were a touch too high.

To be fair, this is strictly on the sushi portion. I haven't experienced the chinese food so I can't say, but the sushi was below average. Everything just tastes so bland, not very fresh, and each roll or nigiri is just TMR(Too Much Rice)!

Why anyone would go here for sushi is beyond me. There are a ton of other venues to go on and off the Strip. The sushi may be decent for most, but I would pull my hair out if I had to pay for what I ate that day.

Generally we would just be here for the Orlean's buffet but since we were sort of buffet out we decided to give this place a try.  It actualy pleasantly surprised our party!

First of all, we were here little before noon so the place was only occupied by 3 tables...  Then as time passes by, a good amount of crowd actually were building up so I'm glad to see that happen with any restaurant large or small.

Checked the prices out and it was slightly steeper than what I was hoping but with the craving for sushi we decided to give it a try...

Here is what we've ordered...

Who's your daddy roll:  Totally delicious!  Yes it was more expensive than other places but man it sure was good.  Delicious tempura shrimp & I believe avocado wrapped in sushi rice topped with sashimi with sauce... so delicious!  I think I can just get this only next time around!  

Tried a couple of dishes on the menu too! (aside from the sushi)  It was actually really good!

--Braised Pork Belly with Chinese Mustard Greens:  So bomb!  The pork belly were so tender, soft, and perfectly simmered in a soy sauce based soup that is actually not overly salty.  (If I only had some BAOs with me this would of so made my day!)  The portion of these pork belly were huge too!  Easily 8 slices of 1/2"" of porky joy!  I can still conjure the image of how it was melting in my mouth!  WOW!

--Steamed Tofu in lotus leaves with shaved Scallops:  Another awesome one!  The tofu itself was light, airy, fluffy, and hot!  The sauce that goes on top of the freshly steamed tofu was just the rigth balance of flavor once again with the melody of mushrooms + shaved scallops... what a perfect balance to the pork bellies!!!

--Pan fried beef noodles:  You know, this dish is actually quite good but I'm not a pan fried noodle type of guy (I don't like it anywhere but others love it so I just have to deal with it)  It was tasty but just not my type of dish to enjoy.

Service was attentive and effective.  No problems here!

So after finally tasting Koji for the first time after so many trips to Orleans would I go back?  Yes!  Who's Your Daddy + Pork Belly truly got me hooked!  Unfortunately it is a casino environment and cost will be much higher than say at Chinatown area, but if you are doing your gambling here at The Orleans, I would definitely recommend you give this place a try!

(P.S.  Pork Belly I believe it's a special that comes and goes... so if you are into juicy, tender, and absolutely pork belly cuts, you better get some now!)",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,8,9,4,69Mfw-rL_K3FRWn7f5jy-g

The main reason was eating here was convenience. Really didn't won't to go looking for a place to dine.

The wait staff was slow and at times just disappeared. The manager had to bring out our drink orders and then go find our waiter to take our orders.  This should have been a clue to us.

I figured I'd go for the quick and safe, I had sushi rolls, Philly & Alaska, nothing fancy.
The two rolls were actually pretty good, probably the best of the dishes we ordered.

Chicken Chow Mien was too soupy and just okay. It was nothing to write home about it.

Szechwan Crispy Beef actually looked and tasted more like Pepper Steak, we even had to ask the waiter, he ensured us it was the right order.

The service was very disappointing, because they were not very busy at all.  Overall, dinner was slightly over priced for the amount and quality of the food, along with the lack of service.

If I were to come back, it would be solely for the sushi bar which was actually pretty good.  I did get to see some of the specialty rolls that were at the sushi bar and they appeared to be spot on.  But again, I didn't actually taste them.

But anywho, we decided to stay at the Orleans for the week and it was just great.

The first night that we got there, I was already home sick and was dying for some sushi. (The week before, we went to Imanas almost every night so I was on a huge sushi binge). We arrived pretty late and since we didn't want to leave the hotel looking for food (hello! crazy people!) we decided to find something within the hotel. 

The bf was pretty happy finding this place. Imagine dragging a whiny five foot girlfriend literally dying for sushi all around the casino searching for sushi. So relief was immediate.

Koji is one of those Chinese/Japanese fusion restaurants so I was kind of skeptical at first because when I think of the mainland, rice isn't usually on the good side of my list. 

We sat at the sushi bar and ordered a lot of salmon sushi(for me) and some chinese food off the menu. Bf ordered spicy tuna, which wasn't that bad; not Genki but still does the job. The salmon was yummy or it could have been because I was starving. We ordered fried rice and yakisoba.

My tip, I wouldn't order the chinese food only because it's overpriced and the serving size is small. The taste was... alright. I just came for the sushi.

The man in charge of making the sushi was very nice and made small talk with us.. The servers always kept my drink filled and made sure we were alright.

Pricing.. it was kind of meh... about $6 dollars or so for two pieces of salmon sushi and it goes higher with the different order. Their toro was almost twenty dollars so I was just like F That man!!! and their uni was about the same price as well. Marketprice I guess but that is just ridiculous.

The California rolls were actually kind of bland and a little dry. The Las Vegas rolls made up for it. Salmon, crab, cream cheese and avacados in tempura and eel sauce make one fine roll. The edamame and spring rolls were pretty good too. 
The prices were average to a little high for the quality and service, which was alright. 
3 stars for average overall.",o-4hscT3jFOq_LQkjGhGeg,2,0,3,Agoo1gojCHs7DcO5ssmULQ

There is a lot to choose from. We had three different sushi rolls (raw and cooked) and three different Chinese dishes (chicken, shrimp, beef). We also tried three different desserts, all good. There was a dessert that had flavored ice cream wrapped in a gelatin covering. It was interesting and worth a try. I did not care for the chocolate cake, it was very rich and had a different taste. For being in a casino, I was pleasantly surprised. The server also did a good job on checking on us and keeping drinks full. Worth a try if you are looking for good sushi/Chinese.",fs-xRX-JAzRSmpAbHheiew,0,0,3,Ey8O5GkgoeNFDlJtstlCIw

They had a good variety of lunch specials, and their food and sushi menu was very extensive. Seemed to have almost every kind of seafood, even some things I have not heard of before. 

Our orders were brought out quickly and the waitress was really nice. The food we got was ok, it wasn't bad by no means, but it wasn't that great either. Although their sushi and rolls looked like they are delicious. 

If I ever find myself back here I am definitely gonna try sushi next time.",meKIO3vJRW_-W7rVnD8U3Q,0,0,3,IoFsOFpw4fHFnuZWsxV-Dw

5568383,2013-12-30,0,6s7uduX1Q1KSjOKvwxYkRA,"We had dinner here recently.  The place was busy but we were able to get a table right away.  We started with two glasses of wine and the mixed tempura.  The tempura was really good - nice and crispy and not too greasy.  Good mix of shrimp and different veggies.  I had the leftovers the next day.  They did not warm up very well and got soggy but they still tasted good.

For our entrees, we had the honey walnut shrimp, tangerine beef and house chow mein.  The chow mein were my favorite.  Lots of noodles and not filled with cabbage like some places do.  The shrimp were tasty, a little too much mayo but still ok.  The beef was a little too strong for me but my mom liked it.    She will enjoy the leftovers later in the week.

Our server was good.  Came around often and checked on us.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,0,0,4,GFugECM9wI23uXWjiDs2hg
5643070,2011-12-26,1,6s7uduX1Q1KSjOKvwxYkRA,"Koji has Chinese food (we didn't take a chance on the sushi) on par with the better restaurants in Chinatown in Honolulu and far superior to the Chinese restaurants on Maui.

My parents (who are from Maui) and I (from Oahu) ordered the gai lan, aka Chinese broccoli, my favorite Chinese vegetable; the spicy eggplant, one of my ""must have"" dishes at any Chinese restaurant; the Mongolian beef, a concession to my less than adventurous parents; and half a crispy deep fried chicken, again a ""safe"" choice for my parents' taste. All dishes were scrumptious, though perhaps unnecessarily laced with MSG (?). The gai lan was cooked expertly, to the point of being al dente, if I can use that term to refer to a vegetable rather than a pasta. (As an aside, note that gai lan is NOT the same vegetable as choi sum, as some would think. Just check on line or verify this with your friendly neighborhood Chinese restaurant.) The spicy eggplant, Szechuan-style, had just the right amount of ""heat."" The Mongolian beef was surprisingly tender. And the chicken was top notch -- the skin was crispy but not oily, and the meat was succulent and not dry.

The waiter was most attentive and informative. He also tolerated some playful ribbing from my father, all in good humor and spirit.

The price was very reasonable, as with most Chinese restaurants. I agree with some other reviewers that the ambiance needs improvement. Overall, however, this is an excellent Chinese restaurant in a most unexpected location -- tucked in the corner of the Orleans casino.",rhsqIPT48_AtB0Z_FiJnwA,2,2,4,lpIfHP0LCSLjYeEtssmXxA

The sushi was soooo good and sooo fresh. My gf said that it was her favorite sushi roll ever.  And we're sushi fanatics.

The food and service were so good we went back the next night and ate even more sushi.

We were seated and the waitress came right away to get our drinks and answer our many questions. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, which was refreshing. 

We ordered the Peking Dumpling appetizer, steamed. I would go back just for those. Wonderfully succulent packets of pork dumpling, with a great dipping sauce. 

My entree was the Mongolian Beef, with fried rice, soup and one veggie egg roll. Normally I'm not a fan of veggie egg rolls, but it was pretty good. Egg drop soup was nice and clean/fresh tasting. My Mongolian Beef was very tender with a good flavor. Rice was so-so, a little on the dry side. One other small note, the iced tea was very weak. 

My husband ordered the half duck, and I'm sure will be writing his own glowing review shortly. He was in heaven. 

Wish we'd taken pics, but it was so good, we just dove right in!

We'll be back for sure!",ER4VikNscGAqk8O2pX61WQ,0,0,4,GbqT2OntrfLU4vLOb84Vcg

It is in the mix of all the hub bub of the Orleans Casino and we were unsure of what to expect. Of course the place was beautiful and setup perfectly for dinner. We were a bit early by Vegas standards - It was 6 PM - and the place was very empty. I want Chinese I said t myself and in we went. The Hostess was friendly and playful to my humor, asking her if she could possibly fit us in for dinner. Well a beautiful booth was ours and the wonderful, speedy and personable waiter, Antonio, was there to help us with drinks and menus. I just wanted a simple meal f cucumber salad and vegetable lettuce wraps, and Anet had a Schezuan chicken dish. Wow! they came out so quick and beautifully prepared. The cucumber salad had a beautiful tang to it I liked a lot. The lettuce wraps with the hoisin sauce weretp grade. Then the chicken Schezuan had a colorful mix of vegetables, was piping hot and had enough spice to get the lips buzzing. All in all I am ready to go here again and try more items as this visit was a winner.",3XzhO2aJdvVtYhKOCJsPrg,1,0,5,I1LmhertzgU9QmRfuWaBJg
