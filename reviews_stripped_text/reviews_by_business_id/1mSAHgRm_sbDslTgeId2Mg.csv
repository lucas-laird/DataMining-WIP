I had a to go order of tacos/quesadillas/huaraches all with al pastor/asada. 
When I got home and opened my food I was reallly disappointed. The meat was sooo black on the asada and al pastor I didn't eat it.. These stingy folks seriously gave me some leftovers from the previous day. With so many taco shops you would think they would up their game..",2mYpFAReN-dW6oerQVzjAA,0,0,2,l2YiBUAOyg6fslMDxRog7w
1611872,2016-07-23,0,1mSAHgRm_sbDslTgeId2Mg,"Maybe they changed a bunch of stuff since the previous reviews.  The tacos were just kinda meh.  A bit too salty, a bit too dry. Still on the search for the ultimate east side taco stand.",9PLDiKZqqVmelPMrBfAgwQ,2,1,3,1Q98Sp0bIcyJuIvxig5f6A
2082472,2018-01-06,0,1mSAHgRm_sbDslTgeId2Mg,"I've traveled near and far to find an authentic Mexican taco stand  and when one finds herself/ himself on the east side, this place is a go-to must .
Broken dialects, al pastor slow fired & charred to perfection, the subtle sweet from the pineapple then the slowly but surely intensity from the habaneros salsa( if it makes me sweat, I dig it ) I definitely left feeling some TYPE-OF-WAY. I don't know if it was primarily the salsa that had me sweating or looking at the beautiful array of meats and fixings ..Maybe pork is the new aphrodisiac ? I must admit that the best tacos/ burritos come from in fact a taco stand . Fast Forward.... Definitely order 

AL Pastor Burrito - pineapple optional, al pastor ( sweet & spicy pork) rice and beans and all the lovings.

To quench your thirst like I did -Squirt or a Mexican bottled soda 

Cheers !",mg8z-d-4ziWnCGyw8veuxQ,0,0,5,rAba2ETEgkpaoFd_HrOLQA
2216715,2017-07-14,0,1mSAHgRm_sbDslTgeId2Mg,BEST taqueria spot in Las Vegas!! They always have great customer service and the food is delicious! The tacos de asada here are a prime example of what a taco de carne asada should taste like and the green salsa is amazing! Taqueria El Buen Pastor is a MUST!,RCFF8zNQaaWTfLwHNzkZrg,0,0,5,3GyPG00PoKQPaOrc23tvqg
2988483,2015-08-03,1,1mSAHgRm_sbDslTgeId2Mg,"Ordered tacos, between the four of us we had pastor, asada, and lengua. The meats were all delicious the only thing I would recommend would be better tortillas because they were dry and falling apart. Each taco is made with two tortillas so I just took one out so that I could better enjoy my tacos. I like that they're open late and staff is friendly. Oh I also like that they give you the choice to add in pineapple to the pastor :)",pcA1OAR30sMQFgl_7YWOpQ,1,1,4,zxfhct6d1wTGR8g3SVGh8w

3332486,2017-03-11,0,1mSAHgRm_sbDslTgeId2Mg,"Tried the asada tacos and am completely satisfied. They are seasoned so well. I would suggest taking a bite before adding salt because its pretty flavorful. My onllllly wish is that the red sauce had more of a kick, but it still tasted great.
