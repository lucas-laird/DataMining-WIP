The decor in the restaurant is misleadingly casual. This place is just as expensive as everything at Caesars Palace, yet it's less of an experience/atmosphere. When the food arrived, it was lower quality than a greasy diner. The sandwich patty I ordered was not even cooked and looked like mushy cat food on the bun. After sending that back, another plate with substitute/powdered eggs and half a potato was brought to our table. This was basically the equivalent of a cheap greasy diner $2 breakfast plate, but was unfortunately priced at over $20. With a bill close to $70 dollars for such low quality food, I recommend that you take your money elsewhere. There are plenty of delicious places nearby, so if you're going to spend that kind of money on a meal, you might as well go somewhere with tasty food.",Wk4sTWxjuMO13dIccqfLKw,0,0,1,ZFVNKNkkAIjNUoMopGcMqw

When I looked at the menu, I didn't see anything that I would want to eat at the time so I thought I'd just order an appetizer and a drink. We received a great service from our server who was very attentive. She suggested that they have ""mean mojitos"" there so I asked what would she recommend and she said that her fave was the Blackberry Mojitos so I ordered that. When I had my first sip, I thought it was good but tasted like there's no alcohol there but a few more sips later, I was buzzed! I loved it! I also ordered the Boulevard Nachos and it was so bomb! The steak was soooo good 
And it was a HUGE portion! Even hubby enjoyed it and he's not the type to eat nachos! Hubby had the Stripside Sliders and Island Mojito he said his was good too.

I had the BLT with a side salad and was very happy as it was a large portion.  We split the texas fries and the onion rings to start.  Huge portions!  My colleagues had the chicken panini, seared tuna salad, and a salad with steak.  Everything looked amazing and the tuna must have been from Nobu!

The desserts were definitely the best part.  The Carrot cake looked like it was from a french pastry shop and the cookie dough Sunday was amazing.

Before there was a restaurant called Serendipity.   Serendipity had it's own style that targeted a lot of customers.  In Las Vegas if you don't have something unique, or different then you might as well close the doors.

Prices are reasonable only becsuse a drink is included  with your order.  Average cost per person is 20.00 and that includes the beverage (non alcoholic).

My wife and I ordered eggs benedict.  Poached egg on a warm English Muffin with a bland tasting hollandaise sauce.  Basically something you can easily make at home.  The breakfast potatoes also very bland and over cooked.  Used a lot of ketchup and hot sauce.......

I'd only recommend this place if you have a Groupon and / or 25 % Yelp discount.   If you neither I'd personally recommend Hexx or Sugar Factory.

We sat in a booth. They have both inside and outside seating. The menu has a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Many of the meals include a soda or regular drink, and most of these meals were $19.66. I choose the Classic Benedict. It was a good portion size-3 eggs/English muffins, and crispy home fries. More than I could finish. 

My friend ordered pancakes, which were Huge, and sweet potato waffle fries. The fries come sprinkled with powdered sugar and were super yummy. Basically tasted like a dessert. 

For drinks we ordered a prickly pear margarita, mule mojito, and raspberry mojito. Prickly pear was ok, tart and our least fave drink. The mule was tasty and I found it to be a good mix between the mule and mojito. The raspberry was sweet and refreshing. All drinks were around $15 each. This is vegas, and we definitely overpaid for our food, but its to be expected. The hotel, Caesars Palace is heavily promoted Stripside tho, and was giving 20% off coupons.

What we didnt expect were 2 big roaches.Yes I said roaches.We were not even 1/2 way into our drinks & wings when something caught our eye.Immediatley called our waiter to comment to him what we saw.His response indeed was not what we expected.He said its expected since we are outside.We could not understand how casual he was about it.Never bothered to ask if we wanted a manager or anything. We were so disatisfied with the entire expierience quickly asked for our tab & walked out leaving.Would never recomend this to anyone except to the citys health inspector.,wwZ0nmLMiCeNYaoDO6NHzg,1,0,1,N3D04LNhJlRU8RUncVsxBA

4520156,2017-02-10,0,uR2GNRdrkY2KeYggp4bCUg,"This replaced Serendypity. Smaller portions. Food isn't as good as Serendypity (they tell you it is the same chef and that might be true, but it doesn't matter. This is all just basic diner food now.

This almost has the feel of eating in an ""I love Vegas"" t-shirt shop. 

Prices are the same or more expensive than Serendypity (for example, two shakes with like a 15% tip came to about 40 dollars. For two shakes. Decorating a mug doesn't justify that price for a shake that doesn't taste any different then a Dairy Queen shake). 

The staff is very friendly. 

But, I wouldn't recommend this place--there are too many better options in Vegas. I am a little skeptical of all the 5 star reviews because there has been a push to make this place work and overcome people's disappointment with losing Serendypity, and so I wonder if those reviews are from staff or friends of staff. Who knows. 

3 stars because the food isn't horrible. Just basic and overpriced without any actual experience . Nice location and friendly staff.",Bg0vuJD7xZE_HhZzzqWGMg,3,0,3,SNtM-Agmoy4Hidv4wZRK2A

I was seated by the hostess inside the restaurant where about 5 tables were taken. Servers continuously walked by and not a single one even glanced at my table. Finally a busboy noticed I was frustrated and said he would send someone right over. Another 7 minutes go by, and I still had not even been brought a glass of water. I decide I've had enough and walk out, but first I stop by the hostess station to politely inform her of the situation. You would think she would apologize and offer to have someone come take my order, but all I got was ""oh, no one came?"" as she looked at the door for me to leave.

Waited in line at the outside to go area and were told that they ran out of wings but the inside had some. Asked the manager if they had wings and he said they did so we decided to dine in.

After waiting another 30 mins, the food finally comes out and the quality was below average for the price.

5451760,2017-04-30,1,uR2GNRdrkY2KeYggp4bCUg,"Recently made a trip to Vegas for vacation anticipating the traditional visit to Serendipity for another taste of unsurpassed greatness. Suffice it to say my hopes and dreams were shattered only to find our favorite stop to be long gone and replaced with a new Caesar's restaurant venture. Stripside Cafe is a nightmarish shadow of its predecessor akin to the poorly packaged imitation store brand version of your favorite quality name-brand products. Nothing about this place is original. The d√©cor is even the same only dirtier, faded, and worn. The menu offerings are patterned after a typical American diner with all too familiar comfort food cravings and hangover nursing grease drippers.  Don't let the rundown appearance and simple menu fool you, the price tag is way outside the realm of a divey American Diner. They are proud to offer their ""combs"" all day for $19.66. This means you pay $20 for a mediocre burger, fries and a drink. This place is Carl's Jr.'s marketing department's dream. Milkshake mugs and New York Cheesecake are among the knockoff items offered to make you think Stripside could be as good as Serendipity, but you'll be disappointed. Service is terrible. Host staff is slow and rude and the waitstaff is illusive at best. Breakfast items are served all day. My bacon, eggs, and breakfast potatoes arrived cold and flavorless. How do you mess that up? I will give credit where credit is due and their adult beverages are done correctly. I sampled a specialty margarita and a mojito and my friend elected to take advantage of the bottomless mimosa. When we were finally able to track down an employee willing to bring the bill, we were nauseated to discover that we were about to pay $80+ for what was easily the worst dining experience of our trip.

The food didn't look too appetizing on the plate when they arrived, but I wouldn't have minded that if they tasted good-- which they didn't. The potatoes were too dry and the Eggs Benedict were not anything special. I expected more for the price and the location. There was no ""wow"" factor in the food, atmosphere, decor, etc.. It was very basic and I would not go again, as there are so many other delicious options on The Strip.
