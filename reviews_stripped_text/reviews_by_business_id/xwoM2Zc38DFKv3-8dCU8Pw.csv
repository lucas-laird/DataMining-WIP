127863,2014-12-06,1,xwoM2Zc38DFKv3-8dCU8Pw,So about two weeks ago my fiancé who is a tattoo artist went into the store to place an order due to all the good reviews an things we have heard. He proceeded to watch the cook touch everything without gloves or washing his hands after touching each individual topping. He then asked the man if he would put gloves on an he said we'll I washed my hands in the back. My fiancé then pulled out his body art card an told the guy you are cross contaminating the food. Bottom line I will never go to this place if they can't understand or be cleaner then a tattoo artist. Considering tattooers are extremely clean I feel people who touch you're food should be even cleaner.,KA09rQE6DNRG8bQPZqhPdA,0,1,1,sO-A6iIvql7qTU4SPHY9SA

Don't know what happened, but I went from a medium char to a raw pie. The calamari was not round rings as this is 9999.999% of the time when ordered. No, it was in sticks lake a fried zucchini or fried cheese.

The manager would not even listen to anything. He said that he checked the order when it left and it was perfect. He would not listen to the folks that I used to place my order.

Well today I gave  it one last try and I asked for xtra sauce and made sure she heard me, took pizza home and disgusting. No sauce very dry. My daughter said little Caesars was better.

We ordered the lemon pepper flavor wings, the base flavor was ok but was over powered with way to much salt, and for me its very difficult to over salt anything. I keep 3-4 different types of salt in my cupboard, so to say something is too salty IS saying something. 

I'll probably give them another shot & just ask them to hold off on the salt otherwise would have been fine for the price, I'm sure you can get better chicken wings at another wing specialty place.

Wings good.
Fries good.
Gyros..etc..good.
Usually throws in free soda with large purchase.
Good fast quality food.

Guy who runs the shop is a guy who runs a pizza shop. He's not Sam Malone of ""Cheers"" ready to listen to your problems and give you solutions. 
He makes good pies and food at a good price. What more do you want.

The first few years we are at this location a couple times a week, they were just so delicious! Then, about a year ago it all changed. I called on my order and went to pick it up 40 minutes later as instructed. When I got there, they said my pizza was almost ready. We then watched the teenage employees chat with the older couple dining in the restaurant (they were the only other people in there). Finally, 30 mins after that they decided to start making our pizza. By then we had waited almost an hour and a half total for pizza that hadn't even gone in the oven!! We were so irritated that we swore we would never go back! After not visiting this place for over a year, we decided to give them another chance (because the food always was really good). I ordered through Grub Hub (as the owner/manager guy suggested). I got the food and drove it all the way home only to flip open the lid and....all wrong!! Neither pizza was correct at all. Back to the pizza place we go, totally expecting an I'm sorry maybe a free dessert...wrong! First, I was asked if I was sure I didn't just type it wrong online. Wth? I'm pretty sure I know what I ordered. After clearing up the confusion with how they misread the order, the owner seriously tried some swap meet wheel and deal crap with us. He offered for us to take back the wrong food and a free 2 liter if he just made 1 pizza over. We said no, we want the correct order (I think this irritated him). Then after waiting the whole time for the new pizzas to be made, we mentioned that the sampler was now cold and soggy and we would like fresh as well. That made the owner take attitude with my boyfriend, he claimed the food was still warm and fresh enough (yum, cold soggy onion rings)! After a small argument, he did remake the sampler as well. In the end, we did get our correct order and the food was good...the whole experience just ruined dinner as a whole. It's just not how you run a business properly! Well unfortunately for this Manhattan, 2 strikes and you're OUT!! Now we need to find another neighborhood pizza place that's actually good (hard to find here in Vegas).

I saw that beneath all the cheese were piles of sausage, pepperoni, mushroom, onion, olives, and bell pepper.  All fresh toppings on a bed of sauce with a blanket of cheese.  The flavor was great.  The crust was the perfect balance of chewy and crispy.  No soggy bread here.  I was pleasently surprised at how much I enjoyed this pizza.

I've ordered from these guys a few times. I've mostly stuck to the basic lunch items they carry, so it's mostly been wings and burgers and pizza. They have other things on the menu, too, such as lasagna or salad, but I haven't strayed from the core ""bad for me"" fare. Also, their lunch specials are like $5.99 and you get food plus fries and a Coke.

Their pizza is pretty good, though I assume it would've been better if I hadn't waited almost an hour to finish it while I finished up with emails. My friend who ordered it seemed to like his, too, so that's good. I also just had the cheeseburger, which was pretty damn good. It was a lot better than I expected it to be, and larger, too. I was expecting slop like comes out of certain fast food establishments, but this was something better. I'm not prepared to compare it to Smashburger or In N Out, but I'm more than willing to recommend it. 

Still, it's not all roses with these guys. I recently ordered the buffalo wings lunch special and asked for mild sauce. They delivered it promptly and all, but the wings had ZERO sauce. They were naked. They were still ok, but it's not what I wanted. Totally ruined my lunch. My neighbor, though, got her wings made perfectly, so I believe my one bad experience is more of a fluke than anything. That's the only thing that stops me from giving these guys a full-on Five Star review. 

Like I said, this place is good. They deliver, prices are solid, and delivery is cool.

The wings are pretty good, nice and crispy, with a hint of something...maybe dill? Anyway, if you're looking for spicy, you might need to go 'extra' for a little kick.",t1XqFax8auTUDfe4kxBJDQ,0,0,3,rQORxax8HMnLRSDfjdCcpw

One of the hardest things about having Celic disease is not being able to find an edible pizza.  It's not exactly the same but part of the problem with most of them is that they are hard like rock.  Not this one though.  So go ahead and order one with your favorite toppings, finally.

Awesome neighborhood pizza place. The employees are always nice and very welcoming. 

The colossal slice special is my go to and the garlic knots are my personal favorite. 

I believe everything is hand made which is awesome and does cause some wait time which is fine cause it's delicious!!
 
I definitely recommend",x5v594-JdXQW-JfwVCp16g,0,0,5,rEUSHJHprQ3WEQv3CtSkAg

Every time I come to Las Vegas I make sure to stop by here. The food is always consistent, fresh, and of course delicious. The pizza is soo good and tastes very homemade. Not like the other places that taste like all their ingredients come out of a can. Every pizza I have ever ordered has been thin and very manhattan style(I know this because I have visited manhattan and pizzas was all I ate lol). They make a gyro pizza! It's so yummy! Who does that???? They do cause they're awesome! Oh my god and the BBQ chicken pizza is supper delishhhhh too.

When I don't order a pizza I usually grab their gyro sandwich which is phenomenal. The gyro meat is so succulent and flavorful, I definitely recommend you trying it out. Also they make really good bacon cheeseburgers! I know it's not the typical thing to order at a pizza shop but hey everything they make is super good so why not:)

Whether you are in the mood for pizza, burgers, sandwiches, wings and other fried goods, this is the best all in one stop shop to go to!

5908594,2017-03-13,0,xwoM2Zc38DFKv3-8dCU8Pw,"Honestly, I'd have to say that their pizza is slightly below-average..  I have been ordering from their direct competitor down the street, Brothers Pizza for about a year now... I've driven by Manhattan Pizza a dozen times & always wanted to try this place.

First time I've tried Manhattan Pizza today on 03.12.17.  I ordered the Carry-Out Special which is their 16"" cheese pizza for $7.99...  I also added an extra topping ($2 for ea additional topping) and ordered my pizza ""thin crust""... 

I read some of these comments before submitting my own and I think it's pretty mind-blowing to see actual consumers using verbiage like: ""delicious"", "" really good"" , and ""solid"".  Really?  How??

Not that Brothers Pizza is ""soo much better"" or anything, but there are a couple of deal-breakers here..

1).  *Cleanliness...
When I arrived and waiting to pay for my food, I noticed that the same man who was taking payments & handling money, just put in a freshly made pizza in the oven w/out washing his hands (yikes!) :/ 
(Although I do not know who made my pizza, I'm still hoping for the best).....

2).  *Thickness / Salty...
My pizza was no where near ""thin crust"" - it was more like a ""regular crust"" pizza..  Geez, makes me wonder how thick their regular pizza is???  :/
Secondly, the crust was sprinkled with garlic salt im guessing, making the crust near unedible :(   
My fingertips were drenched with grease and Garlic Salt...  It looked like I stuck my fingers in a salt container just after eating one slice.

3).  *Surprise Toppings(?)...
Whoever made my pizza put the toppings on first, underneath the cheese, which I absolutely hate because I like to SEE & KNOW what I'm eating..  (I understand, this may not bother alot of people, however, this is a pet peeve of mine)...

To each his own, but I do not think that I'll return to Manhattan Pizza.  Anyone thinking of trying this place- maybe opt for their $3.99 Special instead of committing to a large?  I wish that I would have done this first- now knowing I'm not going to eat the remaining slices...  

Sincerely,
Disappointed consumer.

Did I mention it was greasy?!?",Rds1bjM7aSRme7cetpiCUQ,0,0,1,q3Dau9BQLqBYnMhl3RKm2g
5973578,2013-06-20,2,xwoM2Zc38DFKv3-8dCU8Pw,"It's my own fault. I didn't read any reviews before coming here.  My daughter had just finished her swim lessons and my husband and I were undecided on where to eat dinner, so we let our 5 year old daughter choose.  Another mistake.  She wanted pizza, and since I had fantastic pizza over the weekend, I didn't want pizza again.  But, I remember seeing this place in the same strip mall as her swim school- and seeing a sign that they had more than pizzas: they also had gyros, and philly cheesesteaks.  That should have been my clue that this place couldn't be that good. 

We walk in and there are gyro posters everywhere so I decide to get one.  My husband decides on a philly cheesesteak and I ordered 2 ""colossal pizza combos"" for the kids.  The lady at the counter warned us that the pizza slices were huge so we nixed one order.  And I'm glad we did. That pizza slice was ginormous. And what a great deal it was: $3.99 and it included a drink. But the flavor of it was just OK.  My poor daughter almost chipped a tooth, the outer crust was so hard.  And the cheesesteak and the gyro were OK as well.  Our meals came with fries, and I could have sworn I saw the cooked fries in fryer basket when we arrived, and were put back in the fryer for us. At least it saved me from consuming a few hundred unnecessary calories. 

That's the last time I enter a restaurant without consulting Yelp first!
