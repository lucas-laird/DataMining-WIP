Being a newb it's pretty obvious I was ignored on purpose, got that... You're a hassle feel.  Got a beer and a burger,   Beer was cold and comped as I was playing poker.  Burger was pretty bad as were fries.

It was EMPTY which is sometimes scary when picking a restaurant but it was really good American food. My husband had the French Dip based on another review, I had the Club and my son had the chicken strips. All of it was really good. And the ranch is excellent!

420250,2013-07-23,1,60YMDriyoqeimFOjHXCUoQ,"My favorite local neighborhood bar!

Open and serves food /alcohol 24 hours a day on top of live gaming if you want to test your luck and drink for free!  There are 2-3 TV's on each side of the bar usually on ESPN or whatever game's on and a jukebox in the corner if you want to play DJ.  (If you hear ""Free Bird"" and ""Hotel California"" back to back look for me!)

If you go late at night expect some locals, on-break or off cab/limo drivers, and some neighboring Palms employees coming to enjoy some cold ones.  The bartenders are always laidback and I never have any issues here.

I would highly recommend the nachos/hangover skillet if you are looking to grub!

Still, went back again to try something different.  I ordered the club without ham because I just don't care much for ham.  We sat in the dining area near the kitchen entrance & heard the cook shouting in a very angry, irate tone, asking the waitress ""Does she want bacon?!  Well bacon is pork! Why doesn't she want ham?""  She sounded like she was being put out to make it as I ordered it.  Geez!!!  Who knew wanting one less ingredient on a sandwich would be so inconvenient?!  Also, it was not busy at all.  We were the only people in the dining room so being busy or overwhelmed isn't possible.  She kept going on loudly & we could hear her clearly from the dining room. It was extremely unprofessional and a huge turn off.  My bf was so angry that she kept going on about it, he wanted to leave...  which was fine with me because I lost my appetite & was a little concerned to eat anything made by someone so pissed off by a minor request.",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,3,0,1,6G_iAxpTRtqO3Dz_RymzDg

We got a wide variety of the menu, and we all shared each others food, and every single thing I tried I would highly suggest.

Sadly, we just went to the 9 and spent 200$ for 2 of us. I spent 30$ here including apps, and I thought the food was just as, if not better than 9.

This is not the place to go if you're visiting Vegas and you're looking for lights and action and a ton of people. It's an off the strip divey type place that never looks too busy (I pass by it on a daily basis) but it's got some good prices and good food.

I loved the pretzel bites, the cheese that came with them was good! The pancakes were good and only 2.50 for a short stack and my bf got the hangover skillet which he enjoyed ... quickly.

We like bar food and, beer, pool and good music. Little sis flew in from Connecticut, I flew in from Los Angeles and my parents came out from San Diego. We go to Vegas every year to celebrate my lil sis birthday which happened to be the day we came in. She had her cute little birthday crown on. 

When we walked in we weren't greeted by anyone, but just walked up to the back area by the pool tables. There were only a handful of people and all were sitting at the bar chatting with the bartender. It was Monday around 11am/noon PST. The place was pretty cute. I liked their decor and the way it was set up. The first area was like a normal bar and around the perimeter of the bar was a lounge area for different groups. All empty at that time of day. There were probably about 6 people total in there including the bartender. 

We had an amazing waiter (not the bartender ) who came up to us in the lounge and made sure our drinks stayed full and we were good. If it wasn't for her amazing service and the yummy bar food, it would be a one star. 

The food was great. We had chicken strips and pretzel bites and some excellent fries. Drinks were cold and inexpensive. 

Now, this was the ""KILLED THE MOMENT AND EXPERIENCE"" incident. After being there for an hour we decided we loved it and wanted to stay for a few more rounds. At this point we hadn't had to deal with the bartender yet much since the waitress was taking fully care of us. So Pops walked over to the juke box and put on a handful of old school Johnny Cash songs that we love for little sis birthday. 

After one song played and the next one started up, the bartender shut the juke box music off and put a game on all across the lounge and bar area speakers that hadn't been on to begin with. It had been all over the TVs for them prior. No apology, no hey how many songs do u have left so I can put on the game that no one is watching onto the speakers. It was done purposely. We were like um what the ... The waiter caught this and mentioned it to the bartender girl behind the bar...and nothing. A ""hey sorry about that"" would have worked for me. Waitress came over and said I hope it's ok the bartender turned off your music that you JUST paid the juke box to put on.  I said nope not ok it was pretty rude actually. So... we got the check and went on to the next bar.",VbZpfGj4u0swvo8KPjlyIA,6,2,2,LBp8v-54V0AZ5isYVzjPEw

It's got a full bar, but nothing particularly different or unique. The menu has several options, including all-day breakfast.

It's a neat place to check out just for theme. It's next door to the Palms, so it's a good spot for stopping before or after.

I ordered the hangover breakfast skillet the first time. The portion size is huge and everything you would want for a hangover. The second time I ordered the steak and eggs. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the steak it was the size of both my hands (granted I have small hands so probably a man's hand, but still pretty big). It was the most perfectly seasoned piece of steak I didn't need any additional sauces or anything.  I ordered it medium rare, it was a little more on the medium side, but still very tender.  The eggs were ordered medium, it was a little on the softer side but I didn't mind because the English muffin tasted delicious with it.

The place is seemingly just another rundown local bar. Being right next to the Palms in all its glory doesn't help it set itself apart from its first impression. Get past that and you'll find some delicious food combos that'll satisfy any late night craving. Well worth the stop, all aboard! 

Every time I've been, it was a ghost town compared to the hustle and bustle of the palms/rio nearby. That is a definite plus. Great food at an awesome price on top of getting to avoid the masses of drunk patrons..win-win! Let them eat their stale toast and plastic eggs at the respective casinos' cafés and waste some money at the machines while waiting for a table, you'd already be eating by then :)

Ok, so you might not want to be particularly concerned with being health conscious, this is not the place for that. It would probably 'derail' any diet.
This is food, fried and delicious and filling. Portions are way too big. Don't take a 'loose caboose' home with you! We always split a meal with two or more...seems like there's still some left over for later.

The food was great. Interesting assortment of comfort foods with over the top kind of combos to include the best parts of each of the usual favorites.
The portions are HUGE!
Though not many employees are there and may take a minute to find one, service was prompt and efficient. Everything ordered was correctly served.
The price is inexpensive, especially with its proximity to the strip.

5830337,2015-12-09,3,60YMDriyoqeimFOjHXCUoQ,Used to come here all the time. Was in last Sunday morning my bill came to $19 my friend and I left $60 total. On the way out mark the bar tender stopped my friend and said we need to tip more. I used to go to this place at least once every weekend. Mark was drunk and disrespectful I will never return again. I would leave no stars if possible.,5fqchfmFKHvmTctWm8n9NA,3,0,1,hAZmKz1mAw8aj-U6lmThtQ
