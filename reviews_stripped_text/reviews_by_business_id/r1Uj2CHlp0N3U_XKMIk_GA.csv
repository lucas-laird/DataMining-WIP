I call them on my way to work all the time and make my order to pick up -- way better than waiting in line at those other coffee places. 
They have great prices and a great selection of coffee and tea. They offer a breakfast and lunch menu, and they deliver when they have the available staff.

This was an absolutely horrible experience. 

My friend and I stopped by here out of curiosity. Well, that's the last time we let our curiosity make decisions... No, just kidding. Then how would we ~live life~? 

So, you know how it says ""bakery"" on it, right? When we went in, there wasn't much in the baked goods. The guy's excuse at the counter? ""Uh, well what time is it? Like 6pm? We make all out stuff in the morning. What do you expect?""

Snarky, eh? Well, he didn't get a tip.

The coffee. Cold cold cold. It wasn't good at all. The cream was empty and the sugar and milk area was unkempt.

Ice tea? I think I ordered the ""Passion Fruit Iced Tea"". He didn't even know what bag to pull. Seriously, man? I know you were joking about smoking a little somethin' on the side, but REALLY?

On top of that, there was another man that ordered coffee. The other employee just kind of wandered around the store holding it. He gave up finding him (THE PLACE ONLY HAD LIKE, 5 PEOPLE IN IT) and set it on the counter. The man was upset, his coffee was cold also. So they brewed a new one just for him. 

Please avoid this place. It was not worth it. There's a Del Taco in the same mall. I'd rather have a taco over this place any day.",SQwzKHogENH6V13032Mikg,4,1,1,akzA_tQ7Na9oHQBQNQ8xmg
670654,2015-07-03,0,r1Uj2CHlp0N3U_XKMIk_GA,"I went here to see the coffee roasting equipment and green coffee beans. The owner was very friendly and took the time to discuss the roasting techniques used and had some green coffee beans available for purchase which is very difficult to find locally in Las Vegas.  The owner went out of his way to provide a variety of different coffees for me to taste. I ended up going with the Guatamalan coffee beans over Columbian or Brazillian beans but Columbian was good as well.

The muffins there are made fresh daily and very tasty. I've roasted the coffee beans twice already and it has turned out wonderful with no bitterness and goes down smooth.

They are moving to a larger location soon which I have not seen yet but would like to recommend based on my experience so far at previous location.

A friend and I had lunch there today and she is a regular patron so she ordered. We split a 12"" eggplant sandwich Pannini style and shared a pot of oolong tea. Awesome! We sat in those cushy chairs which probably isn't a good idea for lunch. Way too comfy!
The staff was very helpful and stopped by to apologize for the wait - but we already knew that making a good eggplant sandwich from scratch takes a little while.
Having our own little pot of tea on a warmer and served with nice cups was a real treat. I love tea so I could spend a day there working my way through the menu.

I just got back from Vegas (again), where I visit frequently, and as promised in my last review, made sure to stop by Chieti's.  I really wish I had not.

Being that I am on a strict, no carb, no sugar diet, I went in and asked if I could get a sugar free frappacino and was told I could get one in hazelnut or regular coffee flavor.  So I ordered a regular coffee and was super excited.  However, as soon as I took the first gulf off the straw, I knew there was no way that drink was sugar free, because it was sweet and I hadn't added splenda yet.

I went back and told them so and they said, ""Oh, what you're tasting is our frap mix."".  

""So it's not sugar free then?"" I asked, 

""No, we can't do them sugar free entirely.""

WTF.  What if I had been diabetic?  Are you trying to kill someone?  

Unfortunately for me or them, or whomever, I don't take idiots well, and that's what that entire situation was.  Idiotic and lazy.  Three girls working the counter and none of them know what they are doing.

Sigh.....I should probably give them another try, but honestly, they are so far from where I stay in Vegas that I have to make a special trip and I just don't know if I'm willing to do that since there is a Starbucks a block from my house.

I'm not a huge coffee fan, but my skinny caramel vanilla latte gets made quick and hot and I love the huge selection of food here! Breakfast sandwiches and paninis, toast and jam, yogurts and parfaits, along with smoothies and pastries-- and that's just their breakfast options! Various subs, sandwiches, soups, salads, and even pastas are available for lunch and dinner. Heads up, the sandwiches are huge.

Services is friendly, wifi info is on menu board by register, and seating/dining area is spacious and well decorated-  I especially like the couches and leather chairs, and the potted fake cactuses in coffee beans on the tables! Very cute.

I wasn't blown away by my cappuccino (any place that offers 16 oz and 20 oz sizes makes me suspicious) but it was better than I expected, cynic that I am.  My coffee wasn't bitter, but it didn't have a memorable zing to the taste.  Maybe too much milk?  I was actually famished, as I had just biked 30 miles and my ham sandwich was devoured in seconds.  It was good.  The decor is nice, nothing to write home about, but the place is large with a goodly amount of seats and is clean.  Bonus points for roasting their own coffee, but I'm hesitant to give this place a full 5 stars, if only because of my average 16 oz cappuccino.",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,3,1,3,5ukPA76TwoXwVpNni1YXlQ

We had a large table with comfortable chairs to hold our books and our drinks.  There were enough chairs and tables that we could have added more space if more readers had attended.

The only drawback was getting the drink I wanted which is an important thing.  I ordered an iced mocha and the young man behind the counter had this blank expression on his face of, ""What?""  Eventually, he got the manager/owner(?) who was seated with some people with whom it appeared he was discussing business.

My drink was eventually ready and it was tasty.  A bit more pricey than some competitors, but good nonetheless.  The same routine played out during the evening as more people came in.  An order was placed, a blank look ensued, and the manager had to come over and help with getting the drink done.  It was a hoot!

I would have given this only 2 stars but it was such a good spot for our meeting that I award the extra star.  I may stop by again because the sandwiches on their menu board looked good and it is probably a great lunch stop.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,4,3,3,pv4rN1_b-77-eZA7VCHwqg

I got a soy ice chai latte. It was fine, just a bit heavy on the cinnamon spice in it so I wasn't a particular fan of this chai, but it was prepared well enough. 

The one thing that is cool about this place is they have a selection of whole coffee beans and can fresh grind coffee by the pound and also had a good selection of whole leaf teas for sale. Of course, you can get these same beans and teas in their drinks so you get a lot of selections in that aspect compared to most coffee shops.

This place is rather large and wasn't busy. It's a good quiet place for those looking for a work study place away from the popular crowded spots. 

I'll probably try it again and give a chance to more of their drink selections involving the said coffee or teas. The chai wasn't my particular jam, but perhaps something else on the menu will be wonderful.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,3,io_TGzGXAIMIevHkT0KqRw
