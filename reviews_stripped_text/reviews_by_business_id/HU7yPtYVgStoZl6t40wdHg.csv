I had to repeat my order several times. 
Food turned out well.",ks50CxaraDXVx5QStj-ObQ,0,0,4,NREH2NOtkdbzI2qbpKRiSA

I realize that the elderly are working longer these days due to the economy but they must understand they did this to themselves. A friend and I visited this store and the elderly woman was so rude to my friend that I cancelled my order mid-sandwich. He started by asking her if they had the rotisserie chicken and she rudely said no. She started my order while he was still deciding, he asked her 3 times if they had more of the chicken breast and I never heard her answer and she mumbled what I thought was ""unbelievable"". I asked her what she said to him and she told him that she already answered him 3 times. That is when I cancelled. While we were walking out she told my friend he should clean his ears out. Wow! Terrible customer service. The draw to an already inferior sandwich shop is low, this drags them down even further.",6JVtRFR2ycrqvzuiAXjpow,0,0,1,ZXfDRk6ACewCQJ7nN416yQ

Everything was made exactly as I specified and it was delicious.  The guy working was super nice too so that was a plus considering it was at like 7 in the morning.",_X4SS3-0oXnaUj7u4zRsvA,0,0,5,LdKYpVk-JUU8tQfbcCqjkg
5403531,2014-04-02,0,HU7yPtYVgStoZl6t40wdHg,It's a Subway. Its food requires no review. The location though is this Subway's downfall. I would not be comfortable bringing my family to this location.  The staff is friendly and bi-lingual.,ghwqimFsDVMEUOYVDTdmxg,0,0,3,5wvjcFtihIFBMdLvCf5n3Q

The lady in front of me could not have been more of a pain in the ass.  She was ordering 5 different sandwiches at the same time and was on the phone with the rest of her family getting their orders.  Her conversation went like this...""OKAY SARAH ASK JOEY IF HE WANTS PICKLES!  OK HE WANTS PICKLES. *subway guy puts pickles on it* WAIT WAIT WAIT HE CHANGED HIS MIND HE DOESN'T WANT PICKLES *subway guy takes them off* 

This went on for an excruciating 19 minutes and I've never felt sorrier for a person in my life as I did for that poor subway dude.  Kudos to you, Mr. Subway Sandwich Artist, you're the real American hero.  

I enjoyed my tasty $4 six inch meatball sub with cheese, toasted of course.  The meatballs were fresh and soft, the sauce was hot and tangy, the cheese was melty and gooey.  I was in meatball sammich heaven.  I guess they don't have the five dollar footlongs anymore but now they have a different sub each day for $3 for a six inch.  That's still a pretty good deal.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,12,12,4,AXlGv8Bh7k1w8vna7c8ZfA
