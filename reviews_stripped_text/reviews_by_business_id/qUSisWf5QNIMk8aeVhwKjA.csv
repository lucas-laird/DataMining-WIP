But boy was I wrong. If all vegan food is this tasty I'll gladly make the switch. But I can still have bacon right?  But for real try this place.

I've given this place 3 tries (2 at the other location and then this one today) My first visit I was really excited, and tried a popular favorite that had pecans and other stuff on, but definitely disappointed. The second time I returned earlier this year for another try at just the regular cinnamon roll, since we had received some of the mini ones at the office over Christmas and they were really good. That time was a total let down too, wasted calories and money, Cinnabon would've been better. Today I said I'll give them one more try, and I ordered the mini ones (because I liked those when received at my office) I ordered 2 with original frosting. I get to my car about to eat one and it's COLD! Cold frosting, cold roll. Who would ever want a cold cinnamon roll??? I called the establishment and they said they serve those rolls room temp.

1183627,2017-05-05,0,qUSisWf5QNIMk8aeVhwKjA,"I'm glad this place exists. Mainly because it's vegan. But I do have mixed feelings about it.

The cinnamon rolls are good. But you won't enjoy them if you don't have a pretty big sweet tooth. I'm not much of a fan of sweets but I can easily appreciate a cinnamon roll every so often.
These rolls are just sooooo sweet. Almost too sweet. It's the icing that really does it for me so I try to remember to ask for them to go light on the icing because if not it tastes like I'm just eating globs of icing.
I can never get more than halfway through one of these until I'm not able to eat anymore.
In my opinion they're a bit pricey. I got a cinnamon roll and a tiny little carton of almond milk for almost $10.00. 
I know they have a rewards/points program and they never reminded me my last visit so I totally missed out on getting my points for that visit. I don't come here often so it would have been nice for them to remind me (anyone) that they have a points system. 
There are a lot of seats for you to chose from and most of them, if not all of them have outlets next to them for you to charge your phone. 

Overall this is a nice little place to stop for dessert but definitely not somewhere I see myself more than like once every couple months.",XMV1L5NNButqMCxmWCFOkg,2,0,3,kc3Br5SD_kUgjEj3CVXwdw
1194779,2017-12-04,0,qUSisWf5QNIMk8aeVhwKjA,"I was among the people who stood outside of the Centennial store when they offered free Cinnamon rolls. I thought it kind of silly to wait so long instead of just buying one at another time, but my companions thought it would be fun. We waited in line for two hours - making the best of it by getting to know others in the line. We inched up a little at a time. I was wondering if anyone would come out and communicate with us to let us know our status and if we should keep waiting, but nothing. At about 12:45 a.m. we got almost up to the building and they turned off the open sign and said they were out of cinnamon rolls. Needless to say, we were very disturbed by this realization - especially since they haven't said anything. We entered the store and they pretended not to see us. I thought for sure they would thank us for coming and maybe give us a voucher for a cinnamon roll at another time. After all, that would just be good business. An angry group just stood there in shock. A guy gave some people some cookies after they complained, but not everyone got one. I am so disappointed! Not because I didn't get a cinnamon roll, but because I felt we were treated badly. I don't see myself going there anymore. Too bad. Oh, and by the way, one of the people in line said that they guy didn't care if we gave a negative Yelp review. Nice.",HbiouB1eEWNuB8yfgnKfkQ,0,0,1,9iUyX4ExJpC2Jq_jztxjCg

But once the fams found out they were vegan, they quickly suggested something else. So sadly, I didn't get to try this place out til recently. But ohhhh am I...no wait...WE are so glad that we finally did. I just wished we came here sooner.

The menu is pretty simple for the cinnamon rolls. You pretty much choose your frosting and toppings and that's it. They do charge for each topping so try not to go overboard with your choices ;)  Now, if you can't figure out how you want your bun, then they do have some popular combinations that you can go with.  Or you can do what we did, and ask the gentleman what he recommends.  

The cinnamon rolls are of good size, soft and gooey.  I love how their frostings are not overly sweet and the flavors are not overbearing.  I personally love whipped frosting and their frostings are so much better!  They're light and airy and not heavy whatsoever.  

This is definitely a great place to go to help cure your sweet tooth or as a dessert option after dinner.  The rolls are not too heavy and you can easily share one between two people (or get one each, noone's watching lol).  The price is a bit more on the higher end, but then again, they are gourmet cinnamon rolls and VEGAN!  And if you're not vegan, no worries!  They're still oh so delicious.

You start with a delicious cinnamon bun which is vegan. You can choose what frosting you want, and they have soo many choices! Then you can choose any toppings you want and they have tons. If you are indecisive or don't know what would be good together, they also offer an extensive menu for pre-designed buns which is where I picked mine. 

The bun was a little overcooked, not too gooey but it did taste delightful. I absolutely love frosting so the more, the merrier and there was plenty! The pricing isn't too bad either, about $7 a bun which I thought was reasonable. 

The only con I had for this restaurant is that the person who was helping us at the counter didn't crack a smile and wasn't friendly at all in helping us. However, I will be back to enjoy another cinnamon bun in the future!",i6YHXZfcdtDzZSeEF9Wo3w,0,1,4,9lL5D8r4qJ5-dv8x7fJHQw

1787499,2017-04-15,2,qUSisWf5QNIMk8aeVhwKjA,"Let's start off by saying I was so excited for this place to open I went on a Tuesday just after grand opening, which is 5 days after it opened. I was greeted but a young gal who told me all the things I needed to know. I ordered a ""Regular roll with Cream cheese frosting and Carmel. And I was charged $5.95. Just after we got our order my husband asked the lady why it was so much and she said, I was charged for an ""old school roll"" ($4.75) Cream Cheese frosting ($.50) and the Carmel ($.25) plus tax. The problem is the ""old school roll"" (4.74)  comes with vanilla frosting. The plain roll is $4.25 and then you get charged for any frosting. I paid for double frosting but I didn't ask for it AND I didn't get it. I know I only over paid by $.50 but that's still a rip off. I didn't care that much because I really wanted to eat what I thought was going to be an amazing roll. Sadly, it was not that great. It's lacking in the cinnamon department. It's more of a sweet roll with frosting. It's not worth $5.00 each! I'll probably give it some time and try again when they are more seasoned at running the place and not over charging for nothing. Also we went on Tuesday at noon and it was EMPTY! It doesn't open until 10am so good luck staying open.   

****Update******
I was contacted by the owner and was told that, I was charged correctly. So I'm going to give it a 3 stars which is a so-so review. I was also told that they would take my lack of cinnamon in the rolls comment and review it. 
The roll was soft and the frosting was good but at that price I can not justify getting them very often. If they add more cinnamon to the roll then they might really have something great. With that being said, when you add all the ""crazy"" topping on the roll, like chocolate and peanut butter and things like that, I can understand not having a strong cinnamon flavor which might not work well with all those flavors, but when you want the classic, and it's $5.00 each, you really want it to be the BEST classic you've ever had. You should give this place a try if you want the crazy flavors, who doesn't love having choices? 
Like I said in my first review, I will give it another try, but I'll be hoping to have the best cinnamon roll ever!",PoyelrkIHcDxVZWOtvu6-g,5,2,3,6bO4nILW0rJCgEqP8gvqCA

best to go here if you got a coupon or something, but to pay or outright, no way. $5 each for a cinnamon roll...I can get 8 of them from Costco for $4. #smartshopper",Px6w_kTNBuy0GceThHnccw,2,0,3,xN63wzA4H52JxviS58Vy1g

If you have a sweet tooth, which some people may not have (especially after reading some reviews) then this place is for you! I feen for sweetness and this place hits the spot! Every roll we've tried has been delicious. My personal favorite is the captain america roll.

This venue is bigger than its sister shop south. The service is great and the employees are friendly.

Although i would love to give this place a 5 star i just cant. The prices are high and i get it.... they are premium cinnamon rolls but still. And their variety in drinks are not so great either.  Again, i get it. Its a healthy-ish snack shop, but I love my rolls with a nice cold coke. So my wife always brings a can of coke with us. Minor right? Nope, not to me... a coke is a must!!!

The roll was warm and soft from inside to the outter edge. I went for old fashioned frosting and a Carmel sauce topping because I wanted to compare to cinnabon. The frosting was night and day better. So light and airy. It wasent thick and rich like cinnabon and I much more perfer it this way.

The dough outer area was hard and seemed stale. The frosting was all a weird texture and had a weird hint of something.... almond extract? Not sure. But there wasn't much of a discintion between frosting flavors. The rolls were barely warm. If you're looking for a cinnabun, this is not your place. Will have to go to cinnabon to get my fix.

Before all you vegans shoot daggers at me, let me explain...I am not vegan but my daughter is. Some of the food tastes different than what I am used to so I was afraid this would taste off. It tastes so much better than the non vegan rolls.  It was soft and moist on the inside and a little crispy on the outside. It was perfect, just the way I like it.  They make when you walk in so there is a little bit of a wait time but nothing major.  There is a variety of toppings to choose from and if you aren't sure what you want they will give you some ideas and even let you taste a sample. Both times I got the larger roll and I can barely finish it.  Not too sweet. If you aren't vegan, trust me when I say you can't even tell the difference.

Try the Banana Foster Cinnamon Roll, it's my husband's favorite, and is quite amazingly delicious!

The menu is super overwhelming and I probably held up the line asking to sample frosting (Yes I was that girl today)!

I settled for a create your own roll with cream cheese frosting, pecans & caramel. Did I mention it was Vegan? I don't live a plant based lifestyle but I admire this sweet spot for considering my plant based peeps when it comes to yummy treats.

I love having a Cinnaholic close to home. We actually did a run there with our running group (we have done one to the other location in the past) and everyone LOVED it! The new location is much more spacious than the one on Flamingo (which I also frequent). It's basically like Cinnabon but only better since it's a) vegan and b) there are WAY more options! 

I've found my favorite frosting so far to be banana. Seriously love it. The marshmallow is also good, along with the original cream cheese. Generally if I don't feel like having a lot, I opt for the baby buns - they are cheap and 2 of those little guys hit the spot!

This is great place that we are lucky to have in Centennial Hills! They are ALWAYS nice when I go in there - but having worked retail in my life... there are good days and bad days for anything. I've never had an issue there and the owner is always super friendly. If you are looking for budget-conscious cinnamon rolls... try the day old ones.

As one of my friends told me as I gushed over my excitement of the grand opening last week, I'm probably going to get fat (or at least put on a few extra pounds). The only thing that saved me before was the fact that the older location was way across town. There's no saving me now. 

Of course I have to give a vegan shout out. Do you know how rare it is to find vegan baked goods? Harder than it should be, that's for damn sure. The rolls are warm, fluffy, and deliciously sweet. I tried the cookie monster and loved the icing, but the cookies were a bit hard for my liking. It's best to go with the cookie dough. The roll is best shared between two people. Whenever I try to eat a roll myself I feel uncomfortably full (but sooo satisfied). 

Service is a bit lackluster. We waited about 15 minutes for a specialty roll and the cashier was pretty unenthusiastic. This newer location is spacier which is nice. For a specialty roll and a smart water, the bill came out to ~$7. I'll definitely come back, probably at least once a week. :)

In making my selection, I got the roll with peanut butter frosting and raspberry jam. It was heaven.

After just one bite I knew that this was the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. The flavors are good and the roll is not overly sweet. These rolls are way better than the mall Cinnabon rolls I grew up on that can be sickening sweet. And I read that they're vegan?

I don't know if they have to bake each roll from scratch after you order it but I think that's what they did for us.  They should ask you if you want to wait or have a day old one or something because I would have opted for the latter.

I didn't want the globbed on super thick frosting and asked for light frosting.  (Less frosting apparently costs 50 cents more)   I asked for a roll with pecans... apparently pecans are an upgrade but because I asked for pecans I was given a crumble crust that is also an additional upgrade.  What I thought was a 4.50 roll ended up costing 6.50.   To top it off it really was not that big.      To recap, for taste it is good (But not OMG good and comparable to most others you can buy) but for value, this was a one time curiosity purchase.   The kids working there were super nice so too brings it up to 7.50 for a medium size so-so roll.

We had a party of 4 people in front of us which we figured was no big deal. Upon entering you're overpowered by a super sweet scent that I kept thinking had an odd chemical smell to it as well. The cashier (who also had to stop waiting on his current customer to answer the phone) took our order and stated it would be a ten minute wait.  Again not a huge deal since the rolls are baked fresh, but the place wasn't busy so I was a bit surprised yet happy to have a freshly baked product. That was at 6:42 pm and we didn't end up getting our two rolls until 7:15. While waiting I kept noticing the off putting chemical smell as well as the fact that the dining room was not the cleanest. Also noticed the employees wear gloves to handle the food which I thought was a good practice until my husband and I both witnessed them touching pretty much everything from the register to the counters to the actual rolls..ewww!! The cashier even used the gloved hand to fill the fork container and when they started to fall out grabbed them w/ the ungloved had so no idea what the point of the gloves is.  Finally got our order (1) lemon blueberry and (1) turtle to see that both boxes looked a mess on the outside as if a child had played in chocolate and proceeded to stick their hands all over the boxes, there was even chocolate inside the box w/ the lemon blueberry roll.  
Ok on to the taste, the chemical odor I was smelling the entire time we were there was the OVERLY sweet vanilla frosting. I expected sweet, but these things were too much along with the frosting being gritty w/ the chemical taste. On a positive note, I had never had anything vegan before and you'd never know these are and they were served hot, but were so sweet and chemically that we didn't even finish them and the poor things ended up in the trash.
