I'm originally from California and ever since my husband and I moved to Las Vegas, we've been in search of places like the ones we would eat in California.

I also order their fried plantains and it comes with 5 pieces. The last time I ordered, it wasn't ripe, but the second time, it was perfect! 

The employees are very kind to their costumers and they are very friendly and good people. And, the food comes out pretty fast.

One of the employees actually asked me if I had a Yelp, which I did, and there's actually an offer which gives you 1 free soda and 1 free rice pudding. They were extremely kind and since there was 3 of us, they gave us all free sodas and rice puddings.

The rice pudding was really good also. It tasted like cinnamon. It was small, but by the time I was finished with the lomo saltado and the cilantro soup, I could barely eat the rice pudding.

Overall, the food was very flavorful and a good portion to fill you up for the price of $8.75. Very friendly staff. I wish the best for their business!

I will come back to try the other dishes cause the only bummer was the chicken.

Also the employee was horrible with customer service. When we would ask for items she seemed confused and looked at us like we were weird. When I asked for inka cola she looked at me like this girl - who doesn't speak Spanish isn't gonna like this - ( I'm fluent in Spanish ) and I had to repeat myself and confirm with her that I did want inka cola.

We ordered the family package two whole chickens, four sides , two soups, hot sauce and a soda 

Most of the sides have an up charge as premium sides.  The sides are all very small and I ordered extras because the sides are just really small compared to how much chicken you get. 
The cilantro rice was tasty but mushy in parts and hard in others.  The mixed vegetables were just frozen veggies that were heated up. Plantains were delicious with nice caramelization.  The beans were just beans.  We paid the up charge  for all white meat. 

The flan was ok. Yes just ok 

The cilantro soup was plentiful unlike the sides. What it lacked was cilantro flavor. 

The specialty of the restaurant is the rotisserie chicken. The advertisement says its marinated in citrus, spices etc. The chicken had no flavor or any marinade. The disappointing part was that it was dry. 

All in All we spent over $45 on the family package and extra sides and dessert. Everything went in the trash except the cilantro rice and flan.",_UwZg-ztV7gc9u0zsRSHxA,1,0,1,Jr1mHlwZNVltPnUSxXCFoQ

1761217,2016-02-26,0,O0DxNujKaN-KIfcgbV3MgA,"Flavorless -- That is the word used to describe Pollo Inka's food, Just a few hours ago i stopped by their location with some family; I was in a mood for chicken and since Church's was a few miles away i thought i would try out something new. I order an combo #4 which comes with Chicken, Rice & Beans and a Salad, then added a #8 Noodles de Carne this all ran me at about $27 with a Mango Juice & (1) canned Inca Cola. Lets start out with the price, Their food is unusually expensive for NO REASON their drinks run you about $2.50+ a pop and these are just store bought ie; Mango Juice/Inca Cola etc. paying $2 for a CAN of Inca Cola is just ridiculous in my opinion considering you can get 12-pack for about $4.50 at Marianna's.

So here i am in their parking lot starving i open up the foam tray and am EXTREMELY dissapointed by what i see, I was served half a plate of White Rice which was tasteless and literally the equivalent to you putting rice in water and cooking it in the microwave; I would've been better off by going to the 99cent Store and buying some Uncle Bens ready rice - at least it would've had some seasoning to it. I felt like i was being treated as a child, Take a look at those portion sizes below; Where's the chicken? All i see is a fatty, burnt piece which upon tasting was just bland and the other half is just an empty foam tray.. 

Thinking perhaps it might've been a mistake and somehow i might strike gold with the noodles, I crack open the foam tray for the #8 Carne Noodles and visually they seem appealing and the portion size was pretty good (forgot to take a pic, was too hungry) but upon tasting them again extremely bland; as if these people never learned how to use seasoning, there noodles definitely couldn't compete with ANY $5 lunch special Asian noodles. 

I will give them a (1) star simply because their ajillo green sauce is very spicy and flavorful, Other than that i think this place needs either better cooks or to close its doors. Inka Pollo Express should learn more from other local food chains such as Roberto's, Tikal, Taco Mexico, La Cabana etc. those places serve ADULT portions at an affordable price and still manage to have beverages at under $2, amazing right?",-m5GK6m4hQiZwl8fpSJkYA,4,0,1,HxA5B_hjv5VkvNCWvcZpZw

This is a fast-food style restaurant, and they are new, so perhaps temper your expectations.

POLLO A LA BRASA: Half chicken meal comes with two sides, the cilantro rice is tasty and the chicken initially looks good. Unfortunately on both of my recent visits, it was dry. Get fried yucca as one of your sides and dump on a bunch of aji!
LOMO SALTADO: Probably my favorite dish, stir-fried beef strips with onions, tomatoes, and French fries, served with rice (I like substituting cilantro).
CHICKEN SALAD: Solid portion for $4.50, choice of ranch or a raspberry vin dressing, topped with shredded chicken, tomatoes, and cucumber. If you gotta go healthy, this gets the job done. Unfortunately, the bagged salad blend was not in it's prime.

Had a few service issues during our visits, mostly stemming from staff being unfamiliar with the menu. This place is new though, so I get that.

2263282,2016-02-16,8,O0DxNujKaN-KIfcgbV3MgA,"I've anticipating the opening of Pollo Inka Express in Las Vegas for four months! The official grand opening is tomorrow, but I visited yesterday for lunch and everything on the menu was available, except for chicha morada. This is a fast food-style restaurant with counter service and a dining area, as well as a drive-thru option. It is a franchise with several locations in California.

The menu is easy to navigate and inexpensive. Individual meals cost less than $10. The main options are the popular pollo a la brasa, saltados, chaufas, vainitas, tallarines saltados, salads, sandwiches, and salchipapas. New to Peruvian cuisine? Let me translate. House specialty pollo a la brasa is rotisserie chicken marinated in traditional Peruvian seasonings. Saltados are meats or vegetables stir-fried with french fries and served with rice. Chaufa is Peruvian-style fried rice. Vainitas are saltados with green beans instead of french fries. Tallarines saltados means stir-fried spaghetti. All four of these options can be made with beef, chicken, or mixed vegetables, and are served with with a cup of cilantro soup, which is not suitable for vegetarians. The soup is made with rice and chicken and served with a lime wedge to squeeze into the broth. Salchipapas, a favorite dish for kids, are french fries mixed with sliced hot dogs and three sauces (watch out for the spicy mustard.) It's also worth noting that they do not serve seafood or ceviche at this time.

I ordered the vainitas con vegetales and brown rice and was impressed with the large serving of well-seasoned vegetables. In most Peruvian restaurants, the reliable vegetarian dishes are papa a la Huancaína and tallarines verdes, which are delicious piles of starch and cheese, meaning a lot of bad calories. I'm so happy that Pollo Inka Express has a healthier vegetarian option besides a boring salad that's not 80% carbs. The Huancaína sauce here is not my favorite and the ají verde is all you need to flavor your food. This spicy green sauce is worthy of its own fan club. I've tried it in many Peruvian restaurants, but a small taste usually sets my mouth on fire. The version here is the most taste bud-pleasing one I've found.

A second trip is in order to try more of the menu and to sample the desserts, which look delicious. I hope that this concept will do well in Las Vegas and expand to the west side of town.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,13,12,4,widg_mRbhIz6hTVvzdN2nQ

It was interesting to look around what a combination of cultures sitting down at the place, 2 business men in suits, and Latin America melting pot from Cubans to Mexicans and the lady next to me was polish.

The menu is not too big here, and it's a fast food establishment, but food is still made to order. I ended up ordering the Peruvian classic, lomo saltado, which came with sauce and cilantro soup. I love soup so I think it's great that the meal automatically comes with soup. =)

I also got a free drink and arroz con leche (rice pudding) thanks to the check-in offer. Two freebies for one check-in! Quite a generous deal.

The cashier lady said the portions were small but I would likely still be full. I thought that the portions were actually pretty generous for the price (less than $10 after tax), and don't forget that it comes with soup! I found the food incredibly tasty and satisfying, but I've always been a fan of Peruvian food.

It's fast food so service and the interior decorations are nothing spectacular. However, the food is tasty and inexpensive, so I highly recommend trying it out! They have a decent number of seats for dining in, or you can get takeout like I did today.

My friend accompanied me and she is Peruvian and mentioned now nothing tastes as good as homemade but she gave it a shot. She got the Inko gold soda which brought back good memories as sipped it on ice. My friend had also ordered the purple corn drink and fried rice aka chaufas. I would say it was worth the price for what we got. I really enjoyed the soap; it's one of those things that every culture has to get you by when you're feeling a little under the weather. My friend thought the fried rice was pretty good in taste and quality. I would say that's a good thing coming from a Peruvian. Though, she also got charged twice and there was a bit of a mix up. 

May or may not come back. For the price, I would probably eat here for a nice hearty meal if I'm in the area though I don't feel like Pollo Inka showcases the best of Peruvian food. It's a good start.",UCjsKncHPTmLOH9sCkjQtw,0,0,4,4aYXXuK1yI0-jHuk_D3MXQ

The size was pretty good. The bolilo rolls were firm and made a good foundation for the sandwiches. But a few bites into it, I found the chicken to be a bit dry. I asked my husband but he said it must be the bread. The other flavors (mayo-based sauce with parsley and thinly sliced red onions) were very good, almost masking the dryness. But then towards the end, I noticed there was chicken skin in it. I almost ate it but had to spit it out, because that really grosses me out. Hubby got two pieces of bone, yes, bone. Ok, that is worse than chicken skin, but then he pulled some chicken skin off of his sandwich too. I couldn't finish my sandwich, I hate to waste food, but I lost my appetite. 

Hubby reported his stomach not feeling very good not too long after dinner. I felt fine for the time being. A different story with me today, not good. I had to take a sick day today (composing this review on my cell phone app while laying on the couch). I'm not going into messy details but tummy trouble is never fun. 

Hubby said the ladies working there were very nice. The interior resembles what could've been if Taco Bell and El Pollo Loco merged and had a baby. Hubby also noticed two men in the back whose sole responsibility was slicing raw pieces of beef. Hubby also said the other menu items looked interesting, like the fried rice, but after last night's reaction and my morning, don't think we will come back.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,4,2,1,8E8CbQBw7O8ww71SIpidWQ

I did like the beans and the salad was fresh.  The green aji/sauce was tame for my likes but again in remembering it was fast food I do have to give credit for the consistency.

It's housed in an old Taco Bell Restaurant. It was blinding bright which triggered a migraine. Lots of red and yellow everywhere. 

I had no idea what to get and he ordered for me. It reminded me of Carne Asada fries. It was the 1/2 chicken meal with cilantro rice. I had a bottle of Oriundo Purple Corn drink which was fantastic. It contains purple corn, pineapple, quince, apple, cinnamon and clove. It may be my new binge drink. I liked it but for me it's probably an acquired taste. My kids devoured the leftover when I got home and keep bugging me to go back. That's a good sign. 

The counter employee was a bit gabby but I think just because I asked a lot of questions since I'd never had Peruvian food. I have lots of food allergies and I was fresh out of benadryl. 

My only complaint was that when a homeless man came in to use the restroom, a male employee came from the kitchen and rudely told him to leave! It doesn't cost anything to be nice to somebody. It really broke my heart to watch that. I would have bought the guy a meal if they had not shamed him and ran him off. It was a big, ugly scene. I probably should have called corporate.

Perhaps two workers at drive thru, one taking orders and the other taking money and passing out food. 

I ordered the vegetable Peruvian fried rice. The portion size was generous but with too much rice and not enough vegetable and egg.  Flavor was just okay until I added the green sauce which comes with the order, spicy but not too much.  I also had the fried plantain for the first time and loved it. 

Because this is a new place, I will give this another try. I would like to see the drive thru operation greatly improved. Will try other menu items.  Hoping this was just because it is new.",QJ-fh9FVHf2iKQ96mFb71A,3,0,2,xU5FHy-xMVazFlfobJiDKw

Additionally the staff was superbly friendly. Lastly, Terry personally walked around and had meaningful conversations with the patrons. She actually cares. Not the standard today.

It also comes with a green soup I don't know what it's called but it's so flavorful and spicy. The chicken combo is a great dish too because the portion of chicken is just  right and it's not dry!!

The inca chicken is good, but not great and the sides overall didn't make much of an impression. The green sauce saved the meal and made the yucca extra tasty. Unfortunately, as much as I root for the small business, inca pollo just can't replace the convenience of the ubiquitous crazy chicken.",PQAR1z013WjtH6bMl5295A,0,0,3,_FpFvLDxlrfhmHF5W26cbA
5647829,2016-09-12,0,O0DxNujKaN-KIfcgbV3MgA,"Honestly, I drove past this place for months thinking that it was a knockoff El Pollo Loco, and that didn't sound appealing. However, after reading about it in Desert Companion and some reviews here, I went and checked it out. It is a gem for the neighborhood. Clean, with food made to order so it's express compared to a restaurant but not compared to a true fast food place.

I've only had the chicken so far. The rotisserie combos are good, the chicken has wonderful flavor. I had plantains which were on point and fried yuca which was good though I personally like Viva las Arepas' better. The aji sauce is wonderful. I had leftovers the next day and it was even better.

The chicken fried rice is an excellent value, lots of food with plenty of chicken, very yummy and the aji goes good on it. 

And now the best for last: the cilantro soup. It comes with pretty much every meal you order, it is super flavorful and hearty with chicken, potato and rice. Also, you can order a large soup for 5.50 and that's like a meal of its own. If you're sick, order this soup. If it's cold out, order this soup. If you're anywhere near this place and want delicious soup, order this soup.

Don't expect a 5 star restaurant, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by your experience here.",hIbAQxgFaebQMmHez0udlA,0,0,4,t0nLV5Hbdvp3prd2JkrKNQ
5689565,2018-06-01,0,O0DxNujKaN-KIfcgbV3MgA,"Pollo Inka is a chain of Peruvian sit down restaurants.  I have only been to those and this is the only express one I've been to.  I don't think it has the full menu but it has the most important dish:  the saltado.  It's a meat stir fry with onions, peppers, tomatoes, and fries, all seasoned with soy sauce and comes with a side of rice.  If you are new to Peruvian food, I suggest you try this dish first.  I think you'll be hooked.

That being said... I prefer the sit down Pollo Inkas.  I'm not sure what it is but it just doesn't taste the same.  Hopefully next time I go it will be better, but the good thing is, it's served up super quick!

The employees are all very friendly and the manager made rounds to make sure everyone was comfortable. The chicken salad is huge and healthy for $4.50. I'd get that on a budget everyday! 

I didn't try the chicken specialty, but it was not dry in the salad. 

The slight bumps that they will likely work out are little things. Understanding that ordering a cup of water means the customer is not trying to buy bottled water or a drink. Or giving a plastic bag when requesting a to-go box. There was also a homeless person wandering the interior begging, which the employees weren't sure how to talk to or ask to leave. But some customers ended up buying him food so that he could stay and eat.

Drove through this place after a long day of moving. The menu was exciting and the voice behind the speaker was friendly. I went for the Chicken Saltados (Stir-Fry) with, wait for it. french fries! The chicken was tender, the flavors surprising, the wait time was a just slow enough that you knew it was fresh. I'll wait an extra five minutes at the window for that feeling any day.

The stir-fry comes with their signature Cilantro Soup, which was a nice surprise. The green sauce is spicy with fresh flavors and is a nice touch to add to your dish. I ordered a bottle of the Mango Juice and it was delicious. I've got the Chicha Morado on my beverage radar for next time. It's a sweet punch made from purple corn and spices. Say what?!
