I was going to stop in but my son fell asleep in the car so I decided to do the drive thru instead. Do they not have to-go containers here? My sandwich was wrapped in paper only and not even covered all the way. My baguette was just sitting in the paper bag. The lady taking my order and the one who gave me my food were both extremely friendly, but I'm a little disappointed with how the food was ""served"". I've order take out before from other Panera's and it hasn't been like this. If I had waited until I got home, my sandwich might have been dried out. But because I ate in my car, it was a little messy not having anything containing my food. Wonder how they would have served me soup if I had ordered that!",OuwxgnQLsC2o_mmkecrKSQ,2,0,3,DdobF5N-MbPqV4-lpXGWyw

When we get there, (at about 2:15) our order isn't in the shelf, and the man working informed us it would be ready soon. Then, after a few minutes, they call us back up and tell us the bread choices for the sandwiches we chose were not available and what we wanted instead. Instead of calling us with the phone number provided, they waited until we were there to let us know and prepare our food. We ended up having to wait until 2:34 for our food, where our side bread was sloppily thrown into our bag. I'm not sure what the point of rapid pick up is when it isn't ready 5-10 minutes, but instead almost 30. I could have just ordered the food there, or went through the drive thru, and it would have been faster.

I ordered my food to which she helped me decide what to get and suggested I try the chili which I never had and I end up loving it! She was so kind she brought out my food and continued to check on me throughout the time I was there which I thought was incredibly nice! I even noticed how well she ran the cafe staying on top of the orders and even going to the kitchen to help out, I was very impressed!

The 2 bread bowls come with a side. I chose bread again. But of course, no sign of that bread either when I got home.

2643839,2017-10-23,2,Zbjl53pR2W0jMrGFPM0Ssw,"For the record - my wife and I have never had bad experience at Panera Bread in the past.  But we will NEVER go back to this location (Rainbow and Warm springs)

We recently visited the Panera Bread on South Rainbow for a casual dinner on a Saturday evening.  We walked in with no special expectation thinking it would be just like any other visit. 
 Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The first negative vibe happened at the cash register.  We noticed the young man there chatting and joking with the customers before us - perfectly normal.  However, once my wife and I stepped up, he gave us a blank stare and failed to utter any sort of basic customer-service greeting to us.  We ignored the silence and said hello and proceeded with placing our order.  He seemed to have some difficulty managing the POS system - not a big deal. Although, none of the 4 employees we observed standing around throughout the restaurant (doing absolutely nothing by the way) were by his side helping him out.  

Once we found a booth, we noticed that a pastry we had ordered had not been given to us at the counter.  We decided to wait for one of the employees to deliver our food, at which point we would ask for the pastry.  After a longer than usual wait (which was interesting because they had more employees than customers, yet we still had to wait a long time for our food), our food was brought out to us and we kindly requested that the pastry be brought out as well.  

The response we received from the employee was, ""Sure, but for future reference, you are supposed to pick up your pastry at the counter.""  To us, we thought that was unwarranted attitude; as she said it with such annoyance.  We have been to Panera Bread plenty of times before and we knew normally they'd give us pastry at the front counter.   And if it was forgotten, it was never a big deal for any server/runner to bring the forgotten pastry to us at the table.  My wife really did not appreciate the attitude from the server.  If anything, that comment should have been made to the employee manning the front register to remind them to NOT forget to give the customer pastries they've ordered.  That was bad customer service.

After 3-4 minutes, the employee finally returned with our pastry and sourly asked if we needed anything else.  Once we said we were okay, she then proceeded to head over to the kitchen and talk/laugh with other employees for the duration of our stay.

About half way through our meal, while one of the managers was leaning on the counter in the lobby texting on her phone, we heard an argument erupt in the kitchen.  One of the employees was distraught and yelling profanities at what I can only assume was another manager.  The employee removed their uniform and apparently quit on the spot as far as we could tell.  The entire restaurant fell silent briefly and tension filled the air for the rest of the evening.

As I observed the employees from this point on,  all I saw them doing was laughing with each other, texting, and doing absolutely nothing work related. Managers again were observed texting on their phones in the lobby and doing nothing to apologize to customers for the disturbance.

It was also amazing the sheer number employees working at the time versus the amount of customers in the restaurant.  The ratio is wayyyy off.  Whoever did the work schedule certainly did not do their job correctly.  It would also appear that large amount of employees were ""on break"" concurrently and sitting/eating/socializing in the main dining area.  That was strange to us because at other restaurants, if employees were on break and eating, they would normally be sitting away from the customers and behaving in such a way that would not disturb the customers.

I have managed restaurants in the past and I always went to great lengths to ensure that the customer always had a pleasant experience,  and if they did not, I would go out of my way to ensure that they knew I was aware of their situation and that I would do everything I could to rectify the bad experience and encourage them to return in the future.  The management team at this location did no such thing.  It was the most unprofessional dining experience I have ever had and I would be very surprised that any of the current staff will be around much longer if reviews like this keep cropping up.",e8MJiWlhzcEGwSMC5QOj2g,9,1,1,-yUWepo2ILIp_K8trkymJg

The Steak and White Cheddar Panini is one of my favorites, as well as the Broccoli and Cheddar Soup, but Panera's menu is loaded with a plethora of healthy and delicious options! 

Considering this Panera opened not too long ago, and also considering the fact that a Panera having a Drive-Thru seems like an oxymoron, I was genuinely impressed with the speed in which we received our food! I honestly think we received our food faster in the drive-thru than we ever have dining inside of any Panera we've ever visited! 

Also, Laura was working the drive-thru window that day, and she was such a delight! So full of happiness and positive energy, you can't help but smile while in her presence! If you're visiting this Panera, I sincerely hope you encounter her so she can make your experience that much more memorable. 

Overall, it's Panera...with a drive-thru...and one of the nicest ladies to ever grace this planet. Craving sandwiches, soups, or salads? Go!",Y6vjvB86Uc7isMoowPkU8A,0,0,4,d30by__zgenWMVQPpNbijw

I got half  a sandwich and French onion soup with some apples .  The meal was underwhelming .

In the early days of this location opening, they would forget items almost every order. Whether it was a ladle, bowls, or even the bread. Once they forgot my smoothie. I liked the food enough and they were nice about. We kept going back. 

We used to have them deliver a lot, but those were the orders that were always missing stuff. Once we started just going there, the forgetfulness got a lot better. Still something occasionally but not much. Plus the delivery might be available one day but not the next... hate looking it up to be disappointed. 

I really been enjoying their chili, so a couple days ago my wife went to get us dinner. She ordered for the family and spent over $50. 

She gets it home to me and there is a long hair in my food. We called them up, and they said we can get the whole order replaced on our next visit (my wife even spelled her name over the phone to them), they would put a note in the system.  this was 3 days ago.  

Still craving my chili, my wife texted me today asking what I wanted on her way back from Walmart. Chili!!!

So she orders the same exact same thing, tells them we have a credit. They asked her to pull forward and they would look it up. 

Well... it turns out they never wrote our info down. Called the manager over, and she was rude, acting like we were making this up. Offered us a bowl of soup, which we refused (I'm not eating anything from people that treat us like that). How dare they treat a very regular customer this way. The manager should be replaced, unacceptable, a manager should know this. Her name was Asia and extremely rude. Seemed like she came to the window wanting to pick a fight. 

We left with no food and no doubt in our mind, this place is on the never visit again list.

I proceeded to ask what's in the Superfruit smoothie and she was like ""uhhhhhhhh....."" are you kidding me? I said just give me Greek yogurt.

No one welcomed us as we walked in, so we decided to order with the kiosk. It went smoothly, but there was really nowhere to seat in the restaurant- they were either occupied-which were only about 5 tables- or dirty. So we decided to wipe the tables ourselves and sit down. Then, when we headed to the drink station, nothing was stocked- No lids, no tongs to grab lemons, no napkins, no knives for butter. Okay, so we asked the employees who were just chillin' at the food expo line to get these for us, then they did- but no one seemed to care to clean the tables. 

When we got our foods, we were even more disappointed. Our tomato bisque in a bread bowl had barely no soup because there was so much bread left in the bowl. The french onion soup was alright, but still not enough cheese, or flavor to it.

The overall experience was subpar, and I would rather go to the one in Fort Apache since they have better customer service, friendlier staff, and better food.",s01liMq8lG4G3f3AvJMi5w,2,0,2,edpGkQla2phvKhES5-TVcA
