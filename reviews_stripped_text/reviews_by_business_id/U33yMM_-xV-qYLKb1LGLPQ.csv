They always tell you AFTER you order and finish and get to the register that their credit card machine doesnt work. Then they dont apologize about it. Horrible place to go dont waste your time or money just find a different one to go too. I've been coming here for years (its close to school) and ive never had good service",yQuEw5dp9G3Uac5XaSogQg,0,0,2,tpg5Nhd8NrBA-pKOiyeLcA

The first time, i went in and there were 2 employees. Both were on their phones. Didnt even know i was there. 

Second time.. i had been waiting at the drive thru for five mins ready to order. A lady walks in and a male worker tells me to ""wait"". 10 mins pass and the lady walks put with her order. Then the worker goes to the back. 

Really? Come on now.",Z5DI3y-g9QJ0-5Vw183K-g,1,0,1,HesE2GP4-XYOdaCY6Y_FtA

I asked for basically all the veggies on it and I had no lettuce ! A few leafs of spinach and they put 4 tomatoes on my whole sandwich .  When I regularly go into the restaurant they give you a sprinkle of the veggies not just an amount where you can count .. I asked for banana peppers and there in none on the sandwich .. I also asked for my bread to be toasted ... I feel like they took it out fast or never even toasted it because I went in the drive thru . This subway has low ratings and I just tried calling to speak to the manager about a refund or something because of my satisfaction , no one answered!  I will try tomorrow but this is Terrible for the amount of money I paid for",MtXHFFE9S_ZvvsPZ3DqPeA,2,0,1,21qpxwORe46YBPgBTTt1vw
1993514,2014-03-02,2,U33yMM_-xV-qYLKb1LGLPQ,"Worst service, no room to stand in line, and crappiest sandwich I've had in a while. 
For starters, the drive thru means there's only 4 parking spots for this tiny place. And once you make it inside, there's really only room for about four people to be in the building at one time- there are chairs and counters along the perimeter of the dining area for those who want to dine in, but there really isn't a way for people standing in line to NOT constantly bump into the seated diners. Bad floor plan.

Service was crappy and borderline nonexistent- I was asked what I wanted, and if I wanted it toasted, and if I wanted veggies, and then told my total. Employee was female and young and rude. After paying for my order, she handed me my receipt and walked off- no thank you or good bye, and she didn't even hand me my sandwich, which was practically behind the register. Awkward.

Add to this that there are several signs up promoting their jalapeno cheese bread, and they were out of it when I went in-- at noon on a Sunday. On top of that, when I finally ate my sandwich, there was hardly any meat on it and it was clumped in the middle with bites of bread and veggies at either end- of a six inch. 
Tried the chicken enchilada sandwich and it was underwhelming. I'm confident that I had around seven Fritos in the entire sandwich, and I am not sure whether she forgot to include sauce on my sandwich or chose not to put it on- because it was really dry.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,2,rcEmR7mERGQIxPe5zz0HvQ
2323051,2013-10-10,0,U33yMM_-xV-qYLKb1LGLPQ,"This is one of my favorite lunch spots while I'm at work. Even though I work downtown, I make the drive up Charleston to eat here when I'm craving a sub. Even though it's super tiny and looks like a shack from the outside, it is probably the best location I've been to in town because of the efficiency of the staff. There are usually only 2 people working during lunch and still they are able to serve a small line of customers, man a drive thru window and still get orders out quickly. Most people take their orders to go since there are only 4 or 5 seats at a counter, so I'm usually the only one eating in the restaurant. The manager here is really nice and always seems happy to be there even though he's at work! The only downside is the parking...since this is such a small location, there are only about 3 spots in front. If those are full, you have to park in a nearby shopping center and walk over.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,tBpPT4gbS0n6FucOVBoeqg

I came to the drive thru. First a young lady asked me how she could help me I stated I wanted a turkey & bacon avocado foot long. She ask me if I wanted a cheese bacon. I told her no and still had to repeat myself two more times before she put someone else on a young man to whom I had to repeat the first part of my order to again. 4 times in and I'm really hoping I get a turkey & bacon avocado footlong. He told me he was going to toast it and come back to me. Nope. The young lady came back on.  After asking her to please tell me the vegetables so I could decide a few times she disappeared and the young man came on.  I asked him for everything except olives, pickles (the worst), banana peppers, and jalapeños. I repeated nothing spicy, no olives, no pickles and asked if he got it he said yes. I asked for a large drink Dr. Pepper. He said okay pull up to the window and I will have your total. I pull up and he asks again what size drink. This is where I should have just left. He charged me gave me my drink and sandwich. I drive home and find pickles and banana peppers in my sandwhich. 

I call to complain. Hi I was just there I specifically said no banana peppers, nothing spicy, and no pickles and my sandwich has banana peppers and pickles. He retorted well you said no olives and no banana peppers. I told him again I said no olives, no pickles, nothing spicy (just in case they didn't understand the next 2), no jalapeños, and no banana peppers. So now you are telling me that I indeed did not want banana peppers that you at least understood that yet my sandwhich still had them. Him:Yeah well I didn't make your sandwhich ma'am. ME: BUT YOU TOOK MY ORDER! Can I speak to the manager to get my sandwhich redone and go pick up a new one or maybe a refund? Him:yeah if you come in the morning, there's nothing I can do for you. 

Seriously I've purchased sandwiches at this subway drive thru and others. Never once have I had an issue. Today these kids either had a shitty intercom and not enough sense to ask me to pull up to the window to take my order or they didn't understand English (which thwy seemed to understand) well enough. Either way neither one of them really gave a damn. 

I am beyond dissatisfied and would recommend this place to anyone. I at the very least expected him to offer to redo my sandwhich, but nope. Now I'm out $12 and still didn't get dinner. Stay away if at ask possible.  There's one with a drive thru on rainbow and Washington. They actually understand the word customer service.",H1GpHM80hC5ySAV1E17bVw,0,0,1,aOOLFWjOYip0n4vB_W0VVg

2996871,2015-01-05,0,U33yMM_-xV-qYLKb1LGLPQ,"The wait was ridiculous inside and outside. Keep in mind there was only one customer inside the Subway and one customer at the drive thru window. The sandwiches were barely filled with any toppings. I waited 35 minutes until I was even greeted. Normally I wouldn't wait that long because 35 minutes just to be greeted is ridiculous. Shortly after the worker said ""I'll be right with you"" another 15 minutes passed. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Worst Subway experience ever.

I went to in order the $2 Customer Appreciation sandwiches actually ordered 5 my order was 4 meatball sandwiches on two of them cut the meatballs in half because they were for children and then the other three sandwiches were just regular.  The girl seemed to know what she was doing.  She is my order gave me the amount that I owe which is fine, until I said thank you and started to explain to her that this other subway on rainbow didn't have many balls do you know she closed the window in my face????!!!!

The egg white omlet breakfast sandwiches help me avoid doughnuts at the office.  Two great things about this spot: (1) This location has a drive thru so my lazy, half-asleep self doesn't have to get out of my car in the morning and (2) the guy in the drive thru might be the nicest guy on the planet.

Then the girl actually tired to put only two slices of pickes! By the time she was done none of the veggies even spaned across the bread even after I asked for extra veggies.

It was the saddest, thinest, most anorexic looking footlong I have ever seen... Not to mention that the sandwich had a strange salty/sour taste even though I ordered it exactly as I always do.
