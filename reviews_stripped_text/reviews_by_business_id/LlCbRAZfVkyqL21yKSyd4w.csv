I'd never given the spot a second thought but my interest was piqued and my expectations raised when I found out they are affiliated with Ellis Island, whose food I've really enjoyed. Unfortunately the couple of meals I've had here aren't quite up to that standard.

Steak and egg breakfast was decent, but the chicken fried steak version was overly battered and the breading was soggy rather than crispy. Even more disappointing is how thin their ""country sausage gravy"" was. I added on a side of their garlic green beans and though they smelled amazing, there wasn't much garlic flavor.

Returned for their famous fish and chips dish when working in the area and was similarly underwhelmed by fries that were overdone and a disproportionate fish to breading ratio. They seem to get steady business though, and the service is friendly.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,26,9,3,t_H_vfuUIsjjYicWvXuFSg
1818210,2016-06-14,0,LlCbRAZfVkyqL21yKSyd4w,"This is a review about the Village Pubs Restaurants. I am writing in special reference to the Village Pub on Gipson Road in Henderson. I had been going to Village Pubs since the 1970's and loved there food. When I went to the Gipson Village Pub recently I experienced the waitress from HELL!  I was there with my family and we wanted to watch the NBA basketball games on the TV. I first asked the Hispanic waitress to put on the game and she said, ""When I get around to it, you'll get it!""  After 5-10 min. waiting I went into the bar area and asked the barmaid to change the channel and was informed, ""Your waitress will change it for you!""  So I sat down and waited and with 2 min. to go in our meal the waitress changed the channel, but it was not the basketball game! (another sport's channel) The waitress kept giving me dirty looks and I decided to speak to the Village Pub  management to find out why we were treated that way. I was informed by Danny (Management) that their pub had a priority to gamblers and  sports fans wanting to watch TV was secondary. I wasnot pleased with that answer and went to Ellis Island Casino the parent company of the Village Pubs. After trying to push my way into their corporate offices to speak to someone in charge I spoke to the new Marketing Manager and was assured she would look into the matter. I am now waiting weeks for an answer, but I hear nothing from Ellis Island Management. I guess I will take my sports dollars to another casino that appreciates their customers. We eat out every night for dinner and we spend a lot of money on food and drink. I guess Ellis Island / Village Pub wants only BIG gamblers and could care less about avid sports fans.

The only time that they seemed to remember us was to drop off the check, in the process ignoring the fact that our drinks were empty and that we were still eating our meal, and not even asking if we wanted something else (like desert). The location was also smoky as this location doesn't have a separate dinning area.

I ordered fish and chips and it was disgusting.  The waitress dropped the food off without asking if I needed anything else and I did.  When she came back to check on me I told her the fish was burnt and the fries were greasy, and she asked if I wanted the cook to make another order, but I told her I did not have time.  I tried to pick around it.  A decent waitress would not have allowed it to hit the table, and maybe even bought me a soda while I waited for it to be cooked again.  She did not come back to give me the check or check on me again, and I saw her sitting at the bar. I left $15 on the table, tried to get anyone's attention in the dead bar, but really, they are focused on anything but customer service.  While waiting for the food, I sent a text to my friends saying instead of going to Ichabods next time, lets come here.  There is NO WAY I will ever return.

I ordered the fish and chips, which were reasonably well priced at $9.99. After waiting for the cook to fly to the coast and catch my fish, I finally got my order (about 25 minutes), I got a plate of over cooked, dark brown batter balls. The fries were cooked well but the fish looked and smelled like it had been cooked in grease that was a month old. The batter was very thick and the fish inside was VERY dry. Dipping the fish in Tatar sauce, I was able to eat a piece of fish but could not do any more than that.
Overall, NOT a good place to eat. Bad service, bad food, and a bad atmosphere. 0 for 3. Try it for yourself and kick yourself later or read my words and avoid a bad meal and bad experience.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,2,3,1,4gySYlu6Z5OiQ7RZoUEoIw
4186293,2011-10-25,2,LlCbRAZfVkyqL21yKSyd4w,"If you want to cut the shit and have a great, cheap meal this is the place. Kelly is my favorite server, she greets us with a hug every time we come in (we go there a lot) and lets us know how she is. Most servers truthfully can't stand their regulars, but she's actually genuine. 

It's dimly lit and quiet and OFF THE STRIP. Every time I pick somebody up at McCarren I take them to Village. Sick of noise and douchey Vegas types? I know my guests will be in a matter of hours after checking into their hotel, so I do them a favor. I first take the to a place where they can relax, and hear the people around them. Tough to find in this town. 

I always get the apple pecan salad - it comes with two really big slices of garlic bread so I don't feel all ""healthy"". (My parents come to visit from Chicago and have a fit when I order a salad, like I'm all ""healthy"" and ""not eating"")  Onion rings are the best skip the sweet potato tots for those instead, california burger, awesome. Meatloaf special on Wednesdays is spectacular. Oh! And the chicken penne. Get it with extra cheese. 

The Flamingo location is my favorite because of Kelly. It's worth the risk of walking through that parking lot at 1a.m. Whenever I go to the sunset location I feel like I""m bothering the people that work there because I want to order, and their always either under staffed or the staff is fighting. Awkward. But I love this place and the food is the same at all of the locations. Hope this helped.",-KXvfQ2kxxDSIljmryYGTw,3,1,5,E6gb3AyzFhdYGgdGT9LHcg

Rude, pushy, and when asked for a way to contact her superiors over her attitude, she became extremely belligerent. I had to actually contact another location to find out how to get in touch with ""Annetta""'s boss. 

The woman pitched a fit on myself and my fiance for disagreeing with her opinion that the smoking ban is a horrible thing that will crush all restaurant business in Nevada. She informed me that I've OBVIOUSLY never worked in the industry (which is false) and that I had no right to say that eating in a pub/restaurant is better without people blowing cigarette smoke all over, and that it's ""People like you who cause 3500 servers a month to lose their job in Las Vegas."". 

She also allows her regular customers to flaunt the ban and smoke anyway.

When asking if they had any drink specials, the waitress (not Annetta) was very kind and polite, however after I ordered a drink, Annetta had to pipe up ""You ask about specials and all you order is a F*&$ing Heineken? Jesus!""

I feel the bartender was far to interested in her patrons at the bar to be bothered with even mentioning our server would be with us shortly and if we even wanted a menu. This, Lori (bartender) seems to lack the full spectrum of customer service.

We received our server who was pleasant and did apologize for the wait. 

We ordered the Fish n' Chips and each got ice tea. 

The ice tea, was amazing. Fresh, not too strong nor was it week. Very refreshing. 

The fish and chips, while yes they were not light and golden as they should be, they did not taste like old over used oil. The fish itself was light, flaky and beautiful in color no fishy odder but did have a slight fishy taste. I thought it was me but my lunch partner also noticed. The chips are nice country cut potatoes fresh out of the fryer and were as tasty as to be expected from French fries. 

Outside of the wait to be addressed and the slight off taste of the Fish not a bad experience per se. I Will although continue to visit the Sunset location.",R4erj-G4KuJ91L4fXHfJLQ,1,2,3,dqmFZCB2hWlqvN2GsbbaaA

On top of that, they didn't have a kitchen to order food and they suggested I order from the pizza place next door. I settled up my tab and left. 

I decided to go Village Pub instead. This was a winner. The food was terrific, the machines were fair (I broke even) but most importantly, the service was exceptional. I need to mention my bartenders Lori and Kelly were terrific. Both of them were extremely friendly and attentive. 

I'm in town for march madness with a bunch of friends and I plan on taking the fellas to village pub for a few drinks.
