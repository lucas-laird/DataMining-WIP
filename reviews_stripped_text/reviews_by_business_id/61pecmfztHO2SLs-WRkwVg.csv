I ordered the Vietnamese dry noodles(mi kho ),usually it had oyster sauce on it,guest what,this dry noodles had nothing on it.I asked my server why it doesn't have sauce,he give me a funny answer ""it had sauce on it,but is white sauce "". Wth is ""white sauce"" I never heard that,I try one bite, it is salt & water mix = white sauce. 
I highly recommend people do not go to this place, you'll waste your money on to this restaurant with a horrible food & service. I don't want to give even one star.",nPcl431geSEZgDFrDf9qgA,1,0,1,nQcSpXuMi3V1SNmysqbkwA
41054,2010-05-18,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"This is my current favorite pho place in Las Vegas.  I go once every week to 10 days, or so.

Pho hung never fails to satisfy my cravings for noodle soup.  I always order the same thing:  pho tai, with the beef on the side (so I can drop it in to the broth at my leisure, and keep it rare), and an order of spring rolls - shrimp only, hold the pork. 

The broth is always perfectly seasoned, with a rich beef flavor - never greasy or watery.  Each bowl is generous on the noodles, and comes with the customary plate of bean sprouts, limes, herbs, and chili peppers.

Sometimes, when I've got a big appetite, I order an extra plate of beef slices for $3.  Even with this addition, my meal never costs more than $15 total.  I always have left overs.  Pho makes a wonderful meal on the cheap.

Pho Hung is also good for late night dining.  They're open every night until 2am.

Like many eateries of its particular genre, the service can be quite lackadaisical.  I'm personally willing to overlook that for the quality of the food and the low price.  

The dining room itself isn't what I'd call attractive.  it's harshly lit, and a little gaudy - though always very clean.

If you love pho, give this place a try.",Of9UCq61gd2ehoN337taKQ,2,1,4,9WzqC8_7hWI5QAqrERt0ZA

the decor looked really nice so i was expecting some bomb pho. pretty much all pho tastes the same to me except for maybe the slight differences in the meat balls they serve but regardless im not one to complain about my pho but omg...this place sucks. i was seriously craving something warm and soupy and pho 99.99% hits the spot. the pho here was not hot at all maybe warm to give it some credit. normally when i eat pho i have to blow and blow to cool it enough to eat. over here it would be a joke for me to blow on it.  the broth is also way too sweet. my dad is a pho junkie and in all the years hes dragged me from pho shop to pho shop, i never had pho that tasted so crappy.....serious....how is this place still open?!? haha it must be a cover shop for some underground gambling ring in the basement because no way would a person in their right mind come back here again.

344879,2011-03-16,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"I haven't tried too many other dishes from this place so I can't really rate them. The only reason I go to eat Vietnamese food is for the rice noodle vermicelli, either with the beef broth soup or the dry noodles on a bed of vegetables with charbroiled pork. 

I have tried those two same dishes at three other locations in Las Vegas and in Reno trying to find THE ONE, and this is by far the one with the best service, taste, and freshness. 

I have no idea why its never more crowded. Business seems modest at best so there is always someone available to render quick and prompt service. The pork on the dry noodles is juicy and flavorful, and the meats in the soup are all just the right texture and taste. 

Unlike some other pho places, the soup and pork doesn't leave me with dry mouth afterwards so thankfully they don't dump MSG or salt into their dishes to compensate for their taste.  

The restaurant is spacious, clean, and comfortable. Prices are very fair and portions are big. My search for a pho HQ is over and I can't seem to go back enough.",VssuU5Ni6g455MTx3Y7YWg,0,0,5,9oXPbpKiouhPe1BHnk0ZmA

1692127,2013-10-10,1,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"So after I realized (yet again) that Pho Bosa was closed on Wednesday, and Hue Thai was closed due to a power outage, we ran across the street to give Pho Hung a shot.

Special Combination Pho (Large): The soup was pretty bland, but was edible and passible for Pho. 
Soup with Shrimp, Fish Balls, and Chicken Leg: chicken soup with egg noodles, 2 small halves of fish ball, 2 overdone shrimp, and 2 small (quail, I think) boiled eggs. Hmm.. ""Where is my chicken?"" is what I would have asked had the server ever come back to check on the table. 

When we went to pay our bill, that we had to chase down the server to get, we were charged $3.75 for a soda that on the menu read $2. When we asked to have it corrected, and I finally pointed out that my soup didn't have the chicken leg that was described in the menu, we were fought tooth and nail about the price discrepancy. Apparently, the menu items and prices had changed and they no longer offered the chicken leg, and have since replaced it with the 2 small eggs, ""didn't you see the eggs I added to your soup?!"" Sure I saw, but I would have appreciated to have been told when I had ordered that the menu item had changed and I would have changed my order. We were also told that they were forced to raise the prices on their soft drink offerings (by almost double?!) when there was no service to provide refills. They eventually caved on the soda, but never apologized for any of the inconvenience. I left pretty hungry- I barely had any protein in my soup. 

I was in between giving this place 2-3 stars while we were dining, because of the ordinary and bland food and lack of service, but the interaction afterward really left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't ever go back, and wouldn't suggest this place to anyone I know. I don't know that I'd ever been so infuriated by a restaurant before.

Pho Hung is a little bit farther away from all of the hustle and bustle.  We were here in the morning around 10ish.  The restaurant was practically empty which was not a good sign.  We should have ran out of this place right away but fools that we were, we sucked up and sat down.  

Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  But that's about it.  I ordered beef stew with baguette, but they didnt have any baguette.  They didn't have time to drive to Lee's Sandwiches.  So I ordered their spicy beef noodles, our waitress said they didn't have it today.  I ended up with crab meat noodle soup per the waitress' recommendation.  

We also ordered rice with grilled pork chop and eggrolls, beef noodle (pho bo), crab meat noodle (bun rieu), chicken noodle (pho ga).  The pork chop was burned and dry.  It looked like it's been around for a few days.  The eggrolls were very funky looking and orange.  My crab meat made it into little patties and deep fried.  I've never had it deep fried before and it just did not taste good.  Their beef noodle was ok.  However, it didn't make up for the rest of the order.  I have to give it 1.5 star.

4228562,2010-01-06,4,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"this place is a real disappointment. 

the restaurant itself is decorated very nicely and the waiters are very nice and sweet but i've honestly never been to a restaurant where they messed up on EVERYTHING.

first off, we came in with a party of 5 and she placed us at a tiny booth. we did sit down but we stared at each other awkwardly and then began to position ourselves at a regular table. 

secondly, she came to take our order and i asked if the shakes were ""fresh"" meaning if they use real fruits and not the nasty powder that is used at pho kim long and she said YES it's fresh, so my friend ordered one. when our drinks came out (which came out AFTER our food...) there was 1 avocado shake with pearls and 1 without. there was a total of 6 drinks brought out and only 5 people. she said that we ordered it....now why would we order 6 drinks? when there's only 5 people? the waitress came out and said that I ordered it. i was a little surprised because all i asked was ""are the shakes fresh"" and she assumed that i wanted an avocado shake with pearls LOL. 

third, i asked for limes and the limes brought out were SO DRY!!!! i seriously had to squeeze the shit out of it in order to get 2 or 3 drops. this is why i asked for MORE limes and still the second batch were dry as hell!! 

fourth, they messed up on our bill. they charged us for big bowls of pho...which is correct because that's what we ordered BUT they brought out SMALL bowls of pho. and they also charged us for that extra pearl drink. -_-

now for the pho: we seriously could not eat it. the only reason why i asked for so much lime is because the pho soup is SOOOOOOO SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!! too much msg???????? all of us were dying from a bad hangover or lack of sleep and we really needed pho. we skipped pho kim long because their service sucks and the pho is okay...we wanted BOMB ass pho but we made a big mistake coming here= [. we all agreed that the pho is too sweet so i'm pretty sure it wasn't just me (who happens to be just a little bit picky...) the small pho is really small and i'm pretty sure i would have finished it but because it was too sweet and the noodles were over cooked, i wasn't able to finish it.

4341554,2009-10-06,2,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"This restaurant was opened in 2007, in the height of the Vegas boom times and housing bubble, when pricesof everything was going up and up, and money was flowing easily. Million dollar condos going up everywhere, speculators betting on housing prices getting lucky more than rolling the dice at the craps table. IThe time was like rolling 11's consecutively and parlaying your bet....the odds were long (18 - 1, but pays 15 - 1) but it just kept coming in to pay. 

So a great Pho restaurant owning family from the Portland area, (they own several popular ones in the Pacific northwest) decided to roll the dice in Vegas, They spared no expense in the decor. It is decorated with all high end materials, with marble-like tables, 2 large flat screens, and a lot of quality to make a very clean and pleasant restaurant. The problem is, it is too far from the Strip, out on Spring Mountain a mile from the strip at Decatur in the A&M strip mall. And that long odds 11 crapped out, the housing bubble burst, and Vegas is hurting. 

One of the owners was the cashier the night I went, and she was very friendly and accomodating, asking what I wanted to watch on the flat screens.  We had a nice long talk after my meal about Vietnam, Saigon back then, where her family is from, now Ho Chi Minh city under the communists now. They own a restaurant back there, called Pho 99, at 139 Duong Nguyn Trai, Phuong Ben, Thanh Quan 1, T/P Ho Chi MInh, Viet Nam. There is one in Portland called Pho Hung.

I ordered my standard over the past year, Pho Tai Nam. The beef was good and the broth was, too. Plenty of fresh greens to go with it.

The price was more like glitzy Vegas, not the grungy pacific northwest.

So I said why not, lets try it. We came in, it was very very slow. We were the only customers. And this is during lunch time which is normally noon. Right as we walk in we were greeted by a lady that could barely speak english let along understand english. 

We got to choose our seat, the booth. We were given menus and 3 minutes later the same lady came back and took our orders. I wanted a small at first but when she came back with our waters that definitely tasted like tap water....I changed my mind to get a large because I wanted to take some home for my boyfriend. She couldnt understand me at all, I said it at least five times that I wanted a large and then she just walked away and got another lady that could unserstand...so I told her what I wanted. So probably five minutes later we got our sprites which is pretty much filled with ice to the top..and we got our orders as well my friend (shrimp pho) mine (vegetable pho). 

Our food got to our table pretty quick. Like it wasnt even ten minutes. As I was taking a sip of my soup and eating my vegetables I noticed at least 10 of my vegetables had dirt on them, they were literally turning black already like they were rotting in the fridge and the kitchen still wanted to serve these vegetables. I picked them out and put them on another plate. I could say out of all my vegetables I didnt eat one cabbage at all because there was black stuff on them....like how unappealing! No one wants to eat food with black stuff on them. The broth was good but what really grossed me out was the vegetables that were already turning black!!! 

I don't think I'll come back here again. It's way overpriced for bad pho, with vegetables literally rotting in my pho. I don't want that and I dont think people should even be eating that!! that's not healthy at all. Yes they do have an A rating, but that's useless and basically fake if your vegetables and food in the kitchen are rotting and you still serve it to customers! That's just a health hazard!

4974868,2007-09-14,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"A new Vietnamese restaurant that opened up on Spring Mountain about half a year ago or so, we were pleasantly surprised by the interior decorations of this restaurant.  It doesn't look like your typical Vietnamese joint with fancy booths and furniture.  This is actually their second location, their first being in Portland, Oregon!

We started off our dinner with #21 Tau Hu Ki (""Fried tofu wrap stuffed with fish, shrimp, and crab. 2 for 1 order"") $5.50.  It came with fresh greens and pickled carrots and radishes with a dipping sauce.  Pretty tasty stuff.  And we chose this based on the picture! 

We also shared the #39 Banh Xeo (""Vietnamese pancake"") $7.00.  It's labeled as a meal for one, and it definitely is!  It's loaded with lots of bean sprouts, shrimp, and some other stuff. It's also served with greens and a dipping sauce.  Pretty tasty and I would suggest sharing it with someone and getting an additional dish as well.  It's a hardy order of a pancake.

For my own dinner order, I got the #1 Tai, Nam, Gau, Gan, Sach (""Eye of round steak, well-done flank, fat brisket, soft tendon and honeycomb tripe.), size small $6.50.  It was loaded with lots of noodles, which is a good thing.  I actually didn't finish my order because I was so stuffed (from all the appetizers too).  Another friend ordered the #2 Chin, Nam, Gau, Gan, Sach (""Well-done brisket, well-done flank, fat brisket, soft tendon and honeycomb tripe.""), size small $6.50.  She was pretty happy with her order overall.  The BF ordered his favorite, the #35 Mi Bo Kho (""Stewed beef with egg noodles."") $7.00.  He finished up his whole bowl and I must admit, pretty good flavor in there.

The BF also got the #78 Sinh To Bo (""Fresh avocado shake"") $3.50 to go, and it was yummy! 

Service - our original waiter was coming around a lot to make sure we were okay.  Then I think we were forgotten about after that.  We had to wave the waiter down when we wanted our bill as he couldn't see us in our booth.

Food was pretty good overall and the ambiance is quite nice.  They refill your water with a pitcher that has orange slices in it, which is a nice touch.  I think we'll be going back!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,2,4,cbmwR3WiCQDB_aKgSZNofQ
5051440,2011-01-12,2,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"They are now open late til 2am. It was one of the few reasons why we haven't been back is that it used to close before we can ever get there. We just wanted to try something different and not go to Pho So 1 or Pho Kim Long. 

We ordered Cha Gio ($5)- it's okay, but it's not quite cha gio and more like Chinese eggrolls. The meat (chicken, pork and shrimp) was shredded in it with carrot instead of more of a solid cake of ground pork, carrot and mushroom. I think I prefer it more traditional so I don't think I want to order this again. 

We got a broken rice plate with bbq pork, egg casserole and shredded pork ($8.95). Everything was pretty decent. The pork was flavored nice, but the consistency reminded me of Thai pork jerky dish which I like, but wasn't expecting.  

We got a combination meat pho in large ($7.50). The broth was good actually. A bit sweet which I like and I can taste anise. My one thing was that it was a bit skimpy. A lot of broth, but the not as much noodles and toppings. 

We also got 3 color dessert (I think it was about $3.99) which was pretty good. 

Service was friendly and alright. Food was alright. I think it will be on the rotation for late night eats for us, but daytime there are some options I think that are much better.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,4,3,klgmy21vThHx0qqbqvOekw
5093191,2014-04-17,4,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"Service: Bad

Food: 

Goi Cuon - Bad!! There was a hair in it!! Server said it's ok because she showered,  took the hair out and gave us back the same one expecting us to eat it. We said no and still got charged for it still too! !

Egg roll - Ok. The extra crisp was a good touch

Pho - Soup was bland

Pork chop with shrimp and egg - So the server recommended me this dish saying it was the best thing they had. Pork chop was so tough and dry that I couldn't even cut into it!! Adding to that they gave me a butter knife smh Regardless you could tell the pork chop was old and not fresh. Came with some super over cooked grilled shrimp that was super dry as well. 

Pickled veggies - Horrible!! It was old. Veggies were all soggy and tasted like band aids.  Gag.  

SAVE your money.  Don't eat here. That coming from a Hardcore foodie this is a place to pass.",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,5,1,1,7YlqoUjDd371ryXSbZkxLg

5192135,2008-03-04,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"This probably has to be the prettiest pho restaurant on Spring Mountain. It's cute how they have bed panels (or something that looks like it) as table dividers. 
The pho is just okay though. Service was ... okay. I'll forgive them since they look like beginners at waiting. 
What really made this pho experience a bit below average was how the amigo was working his behind off cleaning up tables while the waiters were just lounging (and sitting..?) around chit chatting.",2QKg3LZWOCWNZhKNulShHA,2,0,3,S7AiqoZUNv7pEQlX_QP7-w
5242994,2012-10-02,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"Out of many pho options along Spring Mountain Road, this is a good one, particularly because it's open later than most (until 3am) and offers a few Vietnamese beer options (Saigon red - yes!) Very large bowls of hot pho with lots of meat. The meat isn't the best quality - a bit stringy in some places, grisly or fatty in others, but there is plenty of it and enriches the flavor of the broth. You don't need the finest cut of meat for a good bowl of pho, and the broth is rich and the plates of vegetables and herbs that you add-in yourself are fresh and aromatic.

The traditional Hung bowl is a combo beef standard including tripe, liver, flank.

Pho ga is a great chicken-noodle, plenty of chicken. 

The spring rolls are huge and fresh, though not the most flavorful. One order gets you four generous pieces.

The menu is expansive and includes not only several types of pho but also extensive non-pho options (rice and meat plates, curry, etc). These can be hit-or-miss, quite honestly - the meat tends to be overcooked or dry at times, but it's all fairly authentic to what one is offered in Vietnam itself. Simple, filling, delicious, and plenty of spices and rice to fill it out. (I like the menu here because it also includes an interesting article on the different food regions of Vietnam). 

As for location, this is a spacious and clean area, brightened by fish tanks, plant age and various Southeast Asian gods and decor. Flatscreen TVs broadcast authentic Southeast Asian programming and music which is entertaining and experience-enhancing. It's definitely comfortable enough to spend a leisurely meal if you have the time. 

Service can be rather slow. Again, it's a cultural thing.

Overall, I enjoy getting an authentic, full cultural taste and experience with my international fair. Pho Hung does a pretty good job of it, and in that regard I have absolutely no complaints.",bpTMsVz-mLl8-0QOcT8gpg,1,1,4,Wk6PwW57C1JmytCo1P6LLg

But pho is pho...walked in and it was completely empty. The service was OK, but I can only imagine how slow it would be if there were actually people dining in the restaurant. It had parking too!

I got the regular rare steak pho...and eh. It was OK. Not the worst pho I've had, but not the best either. Definitely just...OK.",a9MX33fs0IWc-o8tDTh7gw,0,0,3,0iEqxjgpkDK44GFPDWzQYQ
5435938,2014-05-19,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"This place was good but it had an air of being a disappointment. The owner, I think, or the chef made an extra effort to please us. He took the time to show us how to eat the Pho with meatballs. He mixed a small plate of sauces for us and instructed us on the proper way to eat the meatball in the Pho. It was thoughtful. Then I log into my Yelp and I noticed the bad ratings... I think they were trying to make an effort to be a better place to dine. As for the food, the spring rolls where not the fresh spring rolls we are accustom to having. The soups were fine, I like it quite a bit, lots of noodles full of flavor. I liked the people who ran it, they seemed genuine, but unfortunately with so many options in Vegas we will probably be skipping this place in the future. The significant other didn't like it as much as I did and was a little turned off by the aquariums they had.",HLY9oDcVBH9D25lU4X_V5Q,0,0,3,jQ70G0mwrzgNdYgQchtAGg

Over the next four visits, I noticed that the pho just wasn't as good as some other places.  Soup wasn't so flavorful, the tendon was kind of overly mushy, noodles undercooked.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me four times, can't get fooled again. They get points for a clean restaurant with good service and being open late, but given the numerous other Vietnamese restaurants in the area, you might do better elsewhere.",XOSjRes1mDv5H2e3mWKCOw,0,0,2,lleh6xD5qXhFyRyoEmr8bg

5778573,2014-02-08,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"Maybe it's the secluded location or perhaps the strange after taste of the broth left on your tongue.

Whatever the case be, I really am not a fan of the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious with a karaoke stage to your left upon entering. There's a big ""fruit tree"" located in the middle which is a nice sight. However, the wait time for food is rather long. I went here with a group of 7 and had to wait about 40 minutes for food? Nothing comparable to Pho Kim Long (my go to place for pho).  

I'm pretty easily fulfilled with pho from any place, but I was just thrown off by the after taste of the broth as stated above. My final verdict? If you can get pho somewhere else - go for it.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,3,0,2,k-YNJexmiyvQJibe6O9ToA

5915779,2012-07-24,3,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"I used to go to this spot on a somewhat regular occasion. When me and a few of my girlfriends would get to together for our Pho dates we would come here because two of them really liked the place. 

I recently went last week because a new friend loves this place and it was nice to be reacquainted. I quickly remembered why never minded coming to this place and I also remembered why I stopped coming.

I got my typical bowl of Pho. The special combo, extra tendon. They slacked on the extra tendon. They were very skimpy with my extra tendon, you never would have thought that I had asked for extra tendon. 

But they win almost hands down for their flavor of broth. It was perfect for me. It is intense with its aroma, delicious in its taste and if I had to it plain with no condiments I would and could. But of course, I always add a ton of siricha, fish sauce and sambal. 

Where they lose me is the funky tinge of silver, green and purple on their meat. Maybe I am over picky or too sensitive to this. But this is completely unacceptable to me and my standards. 

I also ordered their charbroiled pork spring roll and I am not a fan of how they are open on the ends instead of being closed in. 

I would come back here again. I just wouldn't order the Pho which is sad for me because I LOVE their broth. Maybe I could order a beef ball Pho instead.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,5,2,3,ceo26B_K3BvHLm9fJNMJRQ

5986261,2013-12-04,0,61pecmfztHO2SLs-WRkwVg,"I decided to try this place for the first time, and I am very disappointed. It was a cold, rainy night and pho sounded soo good. The man that greeted me and took care of my to go order was very nice. The vietnamese karaoke was very loud upon entering, but being vietnamese myself... I'm used to this sort of thing. I ordered a pho Tai and two orders of egg rolls to go. I figured the egg rolls had to be bomb because it is very difficult to mess up vietnamese egg rolls. My mistake for assuming... within the first bite I was immediately disappointed. They were burnt, chewey, and had a very distinct funny smell. Maybe they had gone bad already? I had my bf taste them and he was disgusted by them as well. Without a doubt the worst egg rolls I have ever eaten. I ended up throwing away two orders of egg rolls within only taking two bites. The pho was mediocre and tasted like it had an overpowering aroma of cinnamon in it? What the pho?!?!! 
After finishing her vietnamese version of American idol, the hostess/owner?/singer gave the Mic to another employee to sing... but as she walked back to her hostess stand and grabbed her bottle of Hennessey and proceeded to drink while giving me a dirty stare. Which made me feel a bit uneasy. I have no problem patronizing a place that enjoys entertainment and the occasional employees getting faded at work, but being a customer... I'd like to be acknowledged by a warm, hospitable, and friendly environment. Just to be fair, maybe her Hennessey was hitting her just a little too much. I will not be returning, and I strongly advise everyone to spend their hard earned money elsewhere.",khXwaOAkgSaM1T3O_TCpKA,1,0,1,vfZjvh9Qx36CRhIInkVgAQ
