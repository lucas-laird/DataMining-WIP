Little bit of each of the dips... still too much for us.  The kabobs were great.  Tender, juicy, flavorful- delicious.  And the rice it came on was awesome.  I needed the to-go box to come sooner so I would stop eating it.

Overall, loved our meal and had enough leftovers for at least another meal, probably 2.  Good vibe, small place with only a few other tables occupied.  Will go back!",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,0,0,4,C4_YMqQnbNiqmAZ6mbfJMg

The first time I eat there the service was slow (one waitress who tried her best) but I wanted to give the them benefit of a doubt. We waited 35 minutes for the main course.  I came home and had a VERY BAD stomach ache.  In my opinion the meat was NOT fresh.  I eat meat on a regular basis and being from the middle-east I am used to it.  So I went there the second time and order a FELAFEL SANDWICH. Not only did it take LONG TIME to get the sandwich, it looked NOT FRESH. I barely touched it. 

To make matters worse, the waitress didn't even care that I barely touched my plate and presented me with a $15.62 check.  WHAT A JOKE !!!!

Cant even imagine how long that would have taken. Told her we waited long enough and we were leaving. No excuses for that TERRIBLE service. It was after 2 and there were plenty of employees there.

I think she's Middle Eastern or Italian...on second thought, she might be some kind of Spanish.  Anyway, the food is great - especially the Shwarma and lentil soup.  The hummus and pita can be described in one word: totally awesome.  I realize that's two words, but I got excited when trying to come up with a description.  

Oh, and if you're a fan of classy interior decoration, you're in for a treat.  If you've ever wondered to yourself ""who buys the broken crap in the sale bins at Home Goods"" - now you know.  It's an elegant mix of Middle Eastern, Country, and random.  

They even have a deer made out of stone near the cash register - classy.  They're mixing exterior lawn decoration, with the interior.  Am I inside?  Am I outside?  Who knows?  Once you get your food, you'll stop caring and your mind will focus on the awesome flavors and smells.  Which by the way, make your fridge smell like a Persian carpet salesman if left overnight.  Not complaining, just stating fact.

227621,2012-10-17,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"Last saturday night, my wife and I had the dinner for 2 (39.95.) before ordering, i questioned the server about the size of the portions, she assured me that they were only slightly smaller than the portions  on the ala carte menu. Our dinner included: freshly made pita bread, soup or salad for each of us, 
1 appetizer to share, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. 
Everything was wonderful until the entrees were served. The beef shwarma was fine, but the chicken was an outrageously small 1/4 of a chicken accompanied by very greasy roasted  potatoes and carrots. In my 60 + years I have never seen a chicken that small. It should be against the law to slaughter a chicken  that young. 
When i told the server about my dissapointment she told me the  ala carte entree was the same size, but it included  2 pieces of chicken. Since i inquired about the size of the portions rightup front, she should have warned me about the size of the portion when i was ordering. She also dissapared for quite awhile toward the end of the meal. aside from that the service was good.
Very good greek salad, grape leaves, beef shwarma, baklava and pita bread. 
Decent lentil soup and rice pudding

289100,2013-03-18,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"I will not ever go back to this place...

My out of country relatives were about to leave the town and we decided to take them out for a dinner at Khoury's. Place was absolutely empty that evening so I thought we will get full attention of server and the kitchen staff but it turned out that they didn't care for us bringing them business that night at all.

We ordered $40 dinner specials and it was a worst disappointment ever. Bread was stale and turned into dried up pieces within 10 minutes. Soup was OK. The worst part was the entrees. Lamb shawarma was dry and had a funny taste to it. Rice looked like it was re-heated after sitting in a container for a while. I really tried to eat the meat but it was so unappetizing that I gave up after a few bites. My relatives were not happy eaters either. After a bit of a hesitation I tried to explain to the server that our food (especially for the money we paid) is far from acceptable. She was apologetic but told us that she cannot do anything about it and she has to call the manager. 
After some time so called manager showed up (he claimed to be a manger but I know he is the owner) and gave us ""I don't really care"" look and offered 10% discount and some food to go. This is a slap in a face! We didn't like the food in a first place and now we are being offered same horrible food to go! 10% discount - please.... I don't want to pay for it at all the way it was prepared! In the end I didn't want to argue  (especially in front of our relatives that don't speak much English) and settled the bill as it is.

P.S. Upset stomach for 3 people in our party till next day...

On the 4 occasions that I have eaten here we have had to wait for over 20 minutes just to have water brought to our table. On a few occasions the owners son was serving tables. This would be okay if his son were not 10. I'm sorry, but I do not go out to have a 10 year old serve my food to me. His hands were dirty and his manners were very poor. 

The owner also does not seem to care about the service. On our last visit when I mentioned that we had to wait so long to be greeted and brought water at our table, he simply smiled and said that if we didn't like it to never come back. I smiled back and told him that I would take him up on that suggestion and while I was at it pass the suggestion on to a few others along the way.

551128,2012-01-04,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"So I'm probably biased because I've actually lived in the Middle East and worked as a cook while living there, but I wasn't impressed by anything that I ordered.  I went here because I miss a lot of the food that I used to get while living over there, and was hoping maybe this place could alleviate some of that.  Alas, it was not to be.  So I ordered the lunch meat combo as I wanted to try out the sujuk and kibbi, and was rather disappointed in it.  The sujuk came out dry, while the kibbi was rather tasty so I was happy with that.  The rice they served with it was fine, but they went and raw onion on the plate that kind of overwhelmed whatever you tried to eat it with.  Also, their ""grilled"" veggies that they served with it were pretty much raw, not appealing.  I would say that the biggest issue I had there was with their pita, it was overcooked, period.  Even the fresh pita I got midway through my meal was crunchy on the bottom!  Pita should NEVER be crunchy!  Also, it still had flour or something on the outside of it that was kind of grainy and not particularly appealing.  I was also somewhat annoyed to find out that I got charged for the side of pickled veggies that I asked for without being told that first by the server.  Normally at Mediterranean restaurants those pickles come with everything, so kind of surprising.  Overall, if I do end up going back to this place, I'll probably try a pizza as I've heard better things about them.",0D5WAgaOM1M00t3KIEf_Fw,1,0,2,CsfPzpyifd0FJFCLaxBGTg

The prices seem a bit steep for what you received. I enjoyed the variety on the menu and found it interesting that they served raw lamb.  I was disappointed when we asked for an eggplant dish after studying the menu judiciously and was told that they did not have that dish and that ""eggplants were hard to come by"" which is news to me. They served some sort of puffed bread which I found unusual and enjoyed. The quality of the food was good, not outstanding or even that memorable, but good enough that if I were in the neighborhood and they had a special I may come back.

But my litmus test for any middle eastern place is falafel and they nailed it.  If you can handle the heat, order a side of hot sauce - it's lemony blended jalapeño and it's really tasty.

The portions are really huge, so it makes it a fun place to go with friends so you can share and try many menu items. The decor is really pretty and they play fun music that adds to the ethnic atmosphere.

I agree with the other comments that the service is hit-or-miss. I've been there before and the service was great. We went here last night and had horrible service. The server was really friendly but she basically ignored us the entire time. We were sitting out on the patio and we had to go into the restaurant multiple times and ask the server to bring us stuff, because we got sick of waiting for her to come and ask us if we needed anything or to check on us. This included drink refills and even just getting helped right after we got there and were seated. what really ticked me off was that there were more servers in the restaurant than there were customers, and i could see them all congregating and messing around and talking while we were sitting out waiting to be helped. Annoying to say the least!

We decided on the Dinner for Two, a great deal because it offers choices from almost everything on the menu.  Well, either I don't understand Lebanese food or we didn't make very good choices.  We had lentil soup, Greek salad, baba ghanoush, baked chicken, and lamb chops.  With the exception of the lamb chops (which were excellent and served with homemade French fries), everything was so overwhelmed with lemon juice that all dishes tasted the same and it was impossible to distinguish any of the other flavors.  The soup, salad, and baba ganoush were all served at the same time, which was fine.  However, aside from the obvious differences in appearance and texture, there was no flavor differences among these dishes - only the overwhelming taste of lemon.  Isn't baba ganoush supposed to be smoothed out with a little tahini?  When my chicken arrived, tasting exactly like the previous dishes, I was already so saturated with lemon that I simply couldn't eat it.  Thank goodness my husband's plate had lots of lamb chops, so he was able to share.  The two stars here are for the lamb chops and the wait staff.",VS0GAtsa3CdoQ11fkz8JpA,1,0,2,DLUlFBNUVS6dYB5fEod_Nw

Our server Dan was great, even though it appeared as he was new (several questions were responded to in a way you would expect of a new server).  This was perfect for families.  My two young children were with me, and they were setup to accomodate.  The tables had white paper covering them (did not detract from the ambiance).  This made coloring a breeze, which kept the kids busy as we enjoyed the amazing food!  Highly reccomended to try the House Meza (aka ""sampler plate"").   Enough food for three to four people, it gives you a great overview of the type of food the restaurant has to offer.  We also did the Farooj (amazing chicken dish - cheicken was perfectly cooked), Kibbi (meatballs effectively, but tasty!), and Sujuk (beef sausage).   My ONLY complaint would be the favored use of lemon juice and a large amount of dishes.  If you are sensitive to acid as I am, this can cause some issues with the food.

In speaking with the server he told us that they have live belly dancers on Saturday nights. No mediterranean restaurant could go without the Hookah which they have on Wednesday nights with a DJ that sometimes goes till 3 in the morning. This is something to check out for sure.

Khoury's is a good place for lunch or a light dinner, or for a party of friends who don't mind sharing plates.  Their appetizers and tapas style dishes are their strong suit.  I never did enjoy an entree, here (dry and bland seemed to be a theme).  

The fresh bread is outstanding, and excellent for scooping up hummus, babaganoush, and the cucumber yogurt dish they offer.  

For someone like me, who wants to order one of everything, the bill can get out of hand in a hurry.  But if you're with friends, or at least one similarly minded companion, then the prices (again, for the apps and small plates) are perfectly reasonable.  

Service was always friendly and prompt, though since the bread is fresh from the oven there can sometimes be a wait for more. 

Seating is comfortable, inside or out. They have no problem moving tables around to accommodate parties.

For $40 we got a dinner for two, which included an appetizer, soup or salad, entree, and baklava. $40 isn't bad for a sit-down meal, but it is quite pricey for take-out, although we did get a lot of food.

We got the pickle plate for the appetizer, but there were a lot of the pickles on our entree so I wish they would have told us so we could have gotten a different app. My husband got the lentil soup which was good and I got the greek salad. The salad came with a lot of feta which is always a plus and I liked the dressing that came with it.

My husband got a gyro plate and I got a chicken shwarma plate. I was very underwhelmed by my flavorless chicken. I had to dip the chicken in the garlic sauce that we asked for just to give it flavor. I also thought the rice was bland compared to other Mediterranean restaurants. My husband was satisfied with his lamb plate, however.

The pita bread here is amazing. But the lamb shwarma wrap is wrapped in some other sort of homemade bread that is similar to a tortilla- only crappy. Maybe it's their version of laffa, I don't know. Either way, it wasn't great.
Also, the flavors inside the wrap did not go well together: choice of lamb or chicken, plus tomatoes, onions, pickles, and tahini. I did not care for their tahini and the pickles and lamb flavors clashed horribly, plus the lamb itself was dry. Would imagine getting this with chicken would be several times better.

2134571,2014-03-30,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"Lastnight was the first time of going to this restaurant. It was recommended to me by a friend. My cousin was craving good Mediterranean food, so I was like why not. As we entered the restaurant was quaint and looked presentable. We stood by the hostess station for a few minutes, the lady in a white shirt noticed us but ignored us and continued to help the seated guests. Then finally a nice woman in a black shirt asked if we were helped and handed us a menu. After looking through the menu my cousin finally decided on what she wanted. So the woman in the black shirt took us to the cashier area to take our order. While she was taking our order, the lady in the white shirt (she wore glasses , on the hefty side, and have glasses) was so rude and didn't even say excuse me and told her to stop checking us out because she 'doesn't like for her customers to wait for a check'... In my head I was like what are we?? And then she was rude and pushed that girl to the side after she voided our order and the woman in black told her ""she's ordering"" and the lady in the white shirt was so rude and talked down to her and us and said ""well she doesn't care. I think she doesn't care! What I say goes..."" So from that comment I knew immediately she was either an owner or a manager. 

After that experience, the woman in the black shirt was nice and pulled us a chair. While we were sitting there all she did was whine and complain. My ears were literally hurting from her negative behavior.   I have never experienced such verbal abuse to other employees and to waiting customers. I honestly think the woman in the white shirt was racist, only helped people that were blonde or looked Caucasian. She seemed to treat the people with background that is different of her own with such distaste. After that we got home and glad we didn't have to sit through being around her negative aura. 

 I can't believe I gave them a 1 star but I did because there was no other option. The food was mediocre. Kudos to the women who wore black t-shirts and have to deal with the woman in the white shirt every time they work there.",qPFxrxy90lAwbnrsqT_6Hw,0,0,1,o1nTHgBX9ZVGE0zhgPeEFA

2178482,2010-06-04,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"The Skinny: great pita bread and hummus, everything else is not so great (3), solid service (2).

Khoury's is a Mediterranean restaurant tucked away in a strip mall close to Southern Hills Hospital.

We started with an appy of hummus and freshly made pita. This was a delight. Really, half of it is the show of watching the pita lady knead the dough and place it in the woodburning oven. My only gripe is the serving size for hummus is a little small for $6. However, this appetizer alone is worth the trip.

I ordered the Khoury's Salad with Chicken and my hubby ordered the gyros plate. (I wanted to try the moussaka but they were out.)

The salad was okay - the vegetables were great but there was an overabundance of a bland dressing. The chicken itself was singularly uninteresting. It was cut so small that when cooked, it left the meat too dry. I was expecting something similar to chicken from a kabob placed on top of the salad but I have no idea how they cooked this.

My hubby's gyros was ok - the gyros meat was well seasoned. However, the problem lay in the tzatziki sauce. The yogurt was not strained enough, leaving the dressing a little thin for my taste. I also prefer a little more garlic in my tzatziki. The fries served with the sandwiches are homemade - good but not great.

Normally, a place like this would get only maybe a 2.5 from me, but the pita bread really put this place over the top. Maybe I ought to have tried a pizza instead.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,1,3,0rdpeAEUNP01WAz2-ceCgA

2223018,2010-08-29,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"Our dinner here was the sort of solid experience where, perhaps with the menu in the hands of different people with different tastes, it may be worth bumping Khoury up a star. I would call it ""a three with subjective potential.""

We sat indoors where the tables are covered with paper, but tastefully so. (I thought the owners were just being extra clean; then I saw the pile of bones left on the table by the people behind us. Ah!) Most of the tables inside allow for an attractive view of the brick oven where the pita is made.

We started with the falafel appetizer, a genuine highlight, although - ironically - the falafel themselves weren't so amazing. I prefer falafel that are cooked to a light crisp, but most places seem to serve falafel pretty well done, so no surprise that ours were this way. What was delicious were the picture-perfect chopped vegetables filling the rest of the plate. We both liked the pickles, and I actually liked the Kalamatas, which are normally my least fave olive. These Kalamatas were only slightly bitter with a nice tang. The big surprise, though, were the pickled beets: very crispy and sour. A lot more ""oomph!"" than the pickled beets of my past. (Of which there have been, um, two? So I'm not an expert, but these were really satisfying.)

Mike ordered a soda, which was always replenished as needed without any waiting. I asked if they had lemonade. The waitress said they did, and that it was freshly squeezed. Count me in! What she neglected to mention was that it was the very best lemonade ever served west of I-15... maybe even west of the Appalachians. It was terrific. 

Of course, the lemonade wasn't subject to refills, so when - despite my attempts to nurse it all the way through - I emptied my glass during the meal I decided that *if* the waitress asked, I would splurge and have another, whatever the price may be. (It wasn't on the menu.) Otherwise, I would take it as a sign to stay frugal.

Well, she didn't ask, and when we got the bill I was glad. Eight dollars for two lemonades wouldn't really be in line with this particular dining experience. As for the rest of Khoury's pricing, it's difficult to judge. Many items are pretty reasonable compared to similar places, but some prices seem high for what you get. Like, my husband ordered the ""Meat Combination"" for $19, and what he got on his plate would've run perhaps half that in most other casual moderate places.

I ordered the lentil soup because of the description on the menu. The soup had a pleasant, pebbly texture and was obviously prepared with care, nut I also thought it was bland. This is where personal tastes may come in. I'm used to spicy (Indian) lentil soups, and of course it isn't fair to judge a Mediterranean restaurant by those standards. 

For the main course I was embarrassingly unimaginative and got... garlic pizza. Do you hear that thud as I hang my head in shame? I was really craving a salad, maybe the fatoush which I've had elsewhere and loved, but the salads are all entree-sized, and I was also craving something heavier for the main dish. (I never have good luck with taking leftover leafy salad home for later once it's been dressed.) A half-salad (at half-price) would've solved my problem. I did eye someone else's salad, though, and it looked great. Oh well. I only look like I have the stomach for all these things... :)

The garlic pizza, whose copy claims that ""you will need mints after this,"" was decent enough. I did appreciate that they weren't lying about the amount of garlic. Again, though, I think it just wasn't my thing. The pita crust was a nice change but not something I need to have twice.

Speaking of pita, before the meal we were served fresh pita in a basket, the bread so hot we couldn't touch it. (That's not a complaint.) Miss Noob here had never seen pita when it's spherical; I've only ever seen it in its pocket form. It was served with an olive oil and thyme mixture, which - as inviting as it sounds - was pretty flavourless, alas. But the pita itself was good. But then, warm bread is usually a sure thumbs-up from me.

Mike thought his meat plate was okay, but like me, he was left wondering how much of the food was ""meh"" and how much was just him.

I don't think Khoury's will let you down, but how much they lift you up just depends on what you like. If we go back, it will be at lunch prices.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,1,0,3,p7XB1yiJkEav-t-QkX-dGQ
2232729,2011-03-13,2,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  It took a while to get service at the beginning but service was good after that.  The hummus was pretty tasty as was the garlic mint yogurt.  The pita was ok.  I like that the pita comes out warm, but it has strange wheat taste to it that I'm not used to with pita.  And it does get crunchy fast.

They were out of moussaka, one of my favorite dishes, so I tried the stuffed cabbage.  It was ok.  Cabbage leaves stuffed with rice and meat, then cooked and covered with roasted garlic.  I couldn't finish it all.  The texture was a little offputting.  Very watery dish.  

My husband had the meat combination.  The meatball that comes with it is pretty good but everything else was a little dry.  The meat combination comes with rice and that part was very, very good.  They offer tzatziki and tahini on the side with entrees so take advantage of that.  The tzatziki went well with the meat.

I like that they offer Lebanese and Moroccan beers.  It's nice to try something different.  Also, they have a full bar and a lot of creative drinks.  But there are a lot of restaurants to try in this part of town.

2323319,2010-08-13,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"After having read many of the reviews here I figured I would add my opinion and experiences to the list.  My wife and I started coming here after we found that with her Las Vegas Athletic Club membership card, we get 15% the bill.  We LOVE it.  We have eaten here probably 10 or 15 times in the last 6 months.  

The pita bread that they bake there is divine.  It is soft and flavorful and the oil and spice blend the bring to dip it in is excellent.  The hummous is fantastic, especially when they put some chickpeas on top.  It is not overly oily or super dry.  We also enjoy getting the mezza platter, which is basically a little bit of all their appetizers, and we often each that as dinner for the two of us.  The lentil soup is also very good, although getting a cup is pointless, as a bowl is $1 more and is about 3 times bigger.  I LOVE kibbi, and get it everytime as an entree, as it is tasty and filling.  I have brought a few friends here and all of them have told me they continue to return on a regular basis.  

As for slow and rude service that some have mentioned.  What restaurant are you going to?  Having eaten here around a dozen times, I have never had a rude waitress or unusually slow service.  Never.  One time I did see a teenage boy back near the kitchen in the restaurant, but I did not see him waiting tables.  They do have some items that are decidedly un-Lebanese, like pizza, but most restaurants of this type I have seen often have things for more Americanized palates.  I find the portions to be more than adequate and my wife and I usually leave STUFFED for around $35-40 with tip.  She often comments that she enjoys the food a great deal because it just tastes ""fresh"" and feels healthy, calories and such aside.  Overall, one of places we frequent the most now, and the fact that it is on Opentable is nice, so I get points just for making reservations.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,0,0,5,66--LF3LVhOOd4V6AMr_Uw

I'm guessing one of the servers called out for whatever reason but one server and one hostess or busser for the whole restaurant on a weekend?! It took forever for everything. Good thing we didn't have plans after dinner. 

We went with the four course meal for two for $40 which includes soup or salad, one appetizer, two dinners, and one dessert. You also get complimentary pita bread and a thyme and olive oil dip. The food was not something I would come back for. I didn't like their lentil soup. I only enjoyed the baba ghanoush. Their signature dish, Farooj (baked chicken) was cooked well with the garlic, citrus juices but it just didn't do anything for me. It wasn't terrible and it wasn't out of this world. My husband liked their baklava. 

The server was visibly overwhelmed by all the tables and people kept trickling in. The hostess or busser wasn't much help. She would just tell the server someone needed her instead of asking us what we wanted.

2473798,2010-05-03,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"I found Khoury's on my nifty BB yelp App this weekend during my annual Vegas trip. We were sick of QUICK food between our pool parties and clubs, so we decided we wanted something healthy, wholesome and delicious. We love Mediterranean food and the ratings looked promising so we decided to try Khoury's. Could it have been written in the stars that Khourys was only .5 miles away from the Vegas house?! Perhaps! 

A dimly lit restaurant where you can see the wood fire oven as soon as you walk in and feel the warmth emanating from it upon entering the establishment. The music was middle eastern sounding, and the familiar aromas of Lebanese cuisine pranced around my senses. We sat and looked at the menu that was rather full of variety. 

The salads were enticing, but when I saw the pizza choices I became curious as the descriptions were beginning to win me over. The BF wanted a Gyro, and suggested we share two meals. It was a great idea and I decide to order the veggie pizza, which came with feta and kalamata olives and TONS of veggies. We ordered the hummus to start. They brought us seasoned olive oil, FRESH pita bread that was DIVINE and some INCREDIBLE hummus. It was RICH and creamy, you could taste the tanginess of the lemon, the olive oil and the parsley. I LOVE the pickled beets they use to adorn the hummus. Absolutely fantastic. The pita was grainy, soft and fresh. It tasted amazing in BOTH of the hummus and oil. I couldn't decide which I liked better so I kept switching. 

Our food came out and the pizza smelled even better than it sounded on the menu. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. Not to crunchy or firm and not soggy and overcooked. It was bell peppers, squash, mushrooms, tomatoes, feta, kalamata olives and tomato sauce. The crust was awesome. Thin and soft. I was VERY impressed. I loved the feta cheese and kalamata olives on the pizza. It was different and the bold flavors always strike my palate. 

The gyro was awesome. It was sort of ""pressed"" instead of in a soft pita, so the outside was crispier. Definitely a texture we appreciated. The gyro meat was flavorful and complimented the flavors of the cucumber on the tzatziki. The fries were softer, they tasted EXACTLY like potatoes. Weren't over seasoned and appeared to be BAKED instead of fried. 

Overall this place was lovely. The ambiance, the staff (who I didn't elaborate on but they were VERY polite and didn't miss a beat with our service.) The food was excellent. Mediterranean food is definitely one of my favorite types of cuisine, and this one is a place I will SURELY revisit.",8c7Myt-C38P89VWUygM24Q,3,1,4,2oPgLb1sNYNoqDXqnLNcFA

The bread is delicious and soft. It is the best rice, chicken, hummus and salad I've ever had and 15 staff all agree. Not many places do it all so we'll...they do! 

Baklava was a hit too! Brought a platter to my family's for 4th of July BBQ and everyone loved it. I didn't think the kids would like its complex taste in the midst of Oreos and chips ahoy, but I was wrong! They devoured the whole thing.

I've gone to Khoury's once maybe two years ago and I barely remembered the place so we gave this place a try again.

Let me say that the food was very good.  Their fresh bread and hummus was an absolute pleasure to eat.  We all ordered a mixed plate of Beef Skewers and Kafta - which is like a seasoned ground beef in a shape of a sausage / hot dog.  For the food, I would give it a 7/10.

The service, however, left more to be desired.  This place seemed very busy from the lunch crowd but they all left by the time we got our food.  We came to this place around 1:10pm and were seated immediately.  5 minutes later we got our drink order taken.  5 minutes after that, we got our drinks and our order taken. 

Our food finally came at 1:45pm.  It took over 25 minutes for our food to show up.  We all ordered the same thing.  There were some notices under other menu items that it would take 20 minutes cooking time, but not under what we ordered.

Also, since we were starving and digesting our own backbones while waiting for the food.  We got bread and hummus which lasted about 2 minutes.  Another bread refill was needed and acknowledged by the waitress, however it took about 10 minutes before we received more bread.  Service is a  3/10.

We opted for the salad and it too was full of pickle, olive and feta briney deliciousness. The dressing was light and lemony and brought everything together.

We ordered takeout and tried:

Hummus: very decent, I really liked the lemony taste
Baba Ganoush: my favorite thing we ordered (easy since it's one of my favorite foods, but it was pretty good baba)
Grape Leaves: not the best, wouldn't order again
Lamb-over-hummus: I didn't love this because it was pretty oily, and we ended up with so much hummus, but this was my husband's favorite thing
Kibbeh: Not quite as good as I was hoping for (they make it with beef instead of lamb), but still pretty good, and grilled instead of fried which makes it a little healthier!

Lamb should be medium-rare in my opinion. Oh, and they also make their pitas on the spot with a wood-burning oven. Delish!

For me the food merits five stars, however the service is lacking. The first time I came here I made a reservation on Open Table. Once we arrived and I informed the waitress we had a reservation she was like, Wha's open table? Reservation, huh?

DO NOT ORDER THE GRAPE LEAVES. THEYRE DISGUSTING (sorry they are. They were soggy and flavorless. And the portion was insanely small for $9)
I'm love grape leaves. I eat them at least once a week so I know (for the most part) what decent grape leaves should taste like. These were barely stuffed and they were soaking wet and soggy. Literally, I ate a piece of one, spit it out and called to let them know there was something wrong with them. Their response was ""it's becz they're homemade"" I'm not sure you want to take credit for these being ""homemade.""

I got my order to go and everything was just soggy and undercooked. The fries were cold and the falafel sandwich had sooo much sauce dripping from it. Just not worth it at all.

The original menu item, farooj, costs about $15.95 and comes with a side salad. After you show the lady the yelp deal, the resulting check comes out to this: $7.96 after the 50% off but then charges you for the side salad $3.95. Then I asked the lady about the extra charge and she said the deal was only for the chicken and not for the salad and if it's an issue, then next time I order the farooj, I should tell them to not give me the side salad. The funny thing about this whole situation is that if I ordered the farooj without the Yelp deal, the salad would have been FREE. This is NOT about the extra money but the principal of the matter. The purpose of a deal is to get people to come in, try how good the food is, and come back - not the opposite. This was my first time and regrettably the last. I thoroughly enjoyed the food but the service was extremely slow and we weren't even given water or pita bread until after another table seated after us was served first.

5049643,2013-06-28,0,q5sa3zjAwIYMAgfPVxOdHw,"The BF and I came with our friends who live on this side of town. I've heard good things about the food and they said there were certain things they order that is quite nice there so we decided to give it a go. 

We decided to do the dinner for two. Its' $39.99 and you get a choice of a soup or sald each, a shared appetizer, a entree each, and a dessert each. It seemed to be the way to go for dinner, since the prices are more during dinner than lunch...but it seems the portions look to be the same in pics? I don't get why places do that. 

Lentil Soup - pretty good actually. Lighter type broth and had some spinach and the squeeze of lemon made it quite good. 
Greek Salad - pretty plentiful and the components were fresh. A bit overdressed, but still good. 
Our friends got other kinds of soup, chicken and a beef and rice one. 

For appetizer we got- 
Baba ganoush - pretty solid, a bit smoky and nice texture. I like that there was a bit of pink pickles, I wish we ordered a plate of pickles. 
Hummus - our friends got this and it was decent flavor and consistency, but the baba ganoush was the winner. 

They handmake their own puffy pita which is a plus, and ask for refills. They give some olive oil with zaatar. 

Beef kebob - it was just OK. It could use more flavoring and was rather small pieces to be charging what they do. On pictures, it seemed that kebobs were much plumper back then. 
Moussaka - it was a vegetarian one, and wasn't like a traditional stacked style but more a stuffed eggplant with chickpeas and tomato sauce. It's their own take that reminds me of Lebanese stuffed eggplant. It was good for vegan version, but disappointing that I was expecting it to be something else. The thing that was crappy is our friend LOVES their moussaka here and always ordered it - when it had meat in it. He was so disappointed he sent it back because it was not really something he was aware changed. I don't get why they would get rid of a classic. I know they got requests for more vegetarian options, but that sucks for everyone else. Could be in addition to, not instead of. Stuffing a eggplant with meat mix vs the chickpeas isn't too difficult. Please, don't let vegans ruin a good thing. 

We got the baklava to go. It was a plentiful serving of 4 little rolls each which was nice. It was pretty decent and oddly we got two different batches of one crispy and one not as crispy and we all had different opinions which we preferred. 

Service was odd. She was nice in a kinda awkward way of trying to make chit chat, but was definitely struggling to serve 3 tables with basics. We ordered fries and hoped for bread ASAP since there was a slightly cranky baby with us too. Our bread was sitting on the pas for a while so it was more crunchy than fluffy when we got the first batch. Boo. It was also a wait for the bill even though it was clear mom and baby were gone, my BF was getting fresh air and we needed.

For having spent $100 for dinner for 4, we expected far better. It seems my friends who are regulars even seem to be a bit upset and don't want to be back when that particular lady is working (they seem to only get bad service with her) and hope that the moussaka will be back. I live far enough that I'm not sure if I will make the effort to come back, specially since DW is next door. Maybe to-go of some baba ganoush.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,8,0,3,CNFSTvn0Twqj0JDC17qxoA

Thanks to a particularly inviting review from Robyn L., I made my way over to Khoury's. Of course, it is located near another restaurant I have been wanting to try. Oh well, one at a time. 

Khoury's has a cozy intimate feeling with rich colors that soothes the soul. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant gave us a perfect view of the oven fresh bread being made and the kitchen window. There is no viewing into the cooking area, which is a bummer. Between my friend and I, we had ordered the hummus to start. With a check in on Yelp, it is free. +1 for the pickled vegetables and whole chickpeas garnish. My friend ordered the Kafta, a ground sirloin sausage, which they grill and serve on a bed of rice. The starch was cooked perfectly and possessed so much flavor. The Kafta was good, but not moan inducing. I ordered the Lamb Swarma and it got illicit in the dining room. The noises were almost pornographic, at least in my head. The meat was tender, not gamy, and packed with complex flavor. Served with a side of rice and tahini, it was good with their warm bread. For $3.95 each, we added a Khoury's and a Greek Salad. The namesake greens was a simple lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber number, but the dressing packed a tart punch. The lemony bite is what I crave in a salad. Forget using all that oil, just give me a pucker inducing dressing. The Greek was just as good. It had a similar base as the first salad but with feta, olives, and the classic vinaigrette. 

Add a couple glasses of red wine and we were chatting up a storm while enjoying the atmosphere. Around dinner time, it got busy quick. With one hostess and one waitress, they handled the crowd well. While they alternated seating and greeting, no one was left unattended to. 

They have a $40 four course meal for two which caught my eye. This will have to be investigated on my next visit.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,6,3,4,HXQsgU-vKE8J37rU--4xlA

My wife arrived before me, ordered hummus, water and our lunches. I arrived a few minutes later and the waitress, Elissia on our ticket, conveniently ignored me and me needing a drink. She never asked how the hummus was, pretty good actually, and she seemed completely disinterested in our dining experience.

She brought us our meals with limp, barely warm fries to go with our gyro and chicken schwarma sandwich. Again, I had to ask her for ketchup to go with my fries, isn't that basic server stuff, along with more water. I also had to ask for extra gyro sauce, tzatziki, as it's quite watered down tasting and should be much thicker. Along with that the gyro had maybe 1/2 the meat that one would normally associate with a gyro.

We were definitely unimpressed and I asked my wife to remind me the next time I mention going to Khoury's to prompty tell me how much I disliked our first 2 attempts dining at this restaurant. Over priced, mediocre food and garbage service.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,4,0,1,2a_1K_Xawa96im3bLIdR_w

We had the grape leaves for appetizer, I am not a fan anyhow so I did not partake, but the girls did not finish them and said they were not very good. I ordered a Shwarma, which here is different than any I have had before, just meat and onions? I packed it up to go. My friends ordered cabbage wrapped meat...I am not sure what they are called. They packed everything to go as well, no one was really a fan of anything we ordered. We asked for some containers to take our tzaziki sauce to go, instead the server brought us out three large to go sauces and charged us each a dollar fifty for them.

The fresh baked pita, hummus grape leaves, whatever we have ordered we loved. But the Sangria is the BEST. We love to sit outside on the patio to relax and enjoy the food and drinks. 

The service at time can be slow, but we actually enjoy this aspect of the restaurant. We are never in a rush or feel rushed to place our order or leave as soon as we are done. We normally sit there for 2+ hours.

Came here for Valentine's dinner. 
They had a set vday menu... 4 course meal.
Everything was on point from the pita bread, hummus, kafta, baklava and everything in between.
The Greek salad was heavy on the dressing and my mint tea was a little weak but they were accommodating and gave me more fresh mint. 
I think there were under staffed for vday dinner, service was okay.
If I'm in the area I wouldn't mind coming back for lunch and trying stuff from their regular menu.

It is without a doubt THE BEST chicken that I have ever tasted!  Then smother it in gyro sauce (if you are a saucy kind of gal like me) and you have perfection in your mouth!  Your taste buds will be pleasantly satisfied!!  Then there is the GREEK SALAD, ahhhhhhhh!!!  The service is usually good.  My only complaint would be the inconsistencies.  The first time we visited they gave my kids unlimited lemonade and they brought baklava instead of rice pudding then the next time we visited they said that there were no refills on lemonade and the kids had to have rice pudding.  It has changed many times since we started visiting and it can be a little annoying.  Other than that I love this place!!",1dWLN4Mr4hKhu8MQUCKqXQ,3,0,4,9kE5t6nGFViWso4wOhP62g

I like the bread better here, however. The free pita that they give and the dipping oil with spices is fantastic. The two definitely have better Mediterranean food than other restaurants in town, like Paymon's. I've had their specialty baked chicken, sandwiches, and moussaka so far. I've always been satisfied with what I order. The only time that I wasn't so impressed was with the house salad. It was rather plain. Otherwise, they serve good food and I agree with the other reviewer that their rice is delicious!",jk969jHhllucGa6w8Unr9w,0,0,4,C-GaYhCQWnxouXOUta5sSQ

I'm always happy with the food, although it's not as good as their sister restaurant Hedary's. Their service is a bit slower as well. I do like the ambiance in this location, but it's a bit out of the way for me sometimes. 

The sandwiches are filling, but I'm not a fan of the pickle they sneak in there, so keep in mind if you're ordering as you might want to have that on the side. Just not sure it works with all the flavors. As always I stick with lamb schwarma or kabobs. I also often get a salad or hummus. The hummus is just ok, but it does the trick when you're having a craving.

Every time I've ever been here they haven't been extremely busy, but the service for refills tends to be a bit slow, so drink accordingly.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,3,Mr7ifBWNH4sXtFwg0G5LPw
