93298,2016-05-28,0,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,Tried this new restaurant today for lunch with a friend from Bangkok and another from Vancouver. Had the Pad See Ew and it was delicious.  Ordered it with a level-2 spice to make sure it wasn't too hot for the first time.  It was perfect. The chicken was cooked to perfection and very juicy and tender.  My friend from Vancouver had the Boat Noodle Soup and my friend from Bangkok had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup and both said it was very authentic and fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for traditional Thai food.,gYauBXTFvIqR881KFGULaA,0,0,5,nJR4VVr001XqZD8Q3IjIcQ
414582,2015-11-13,3,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,I ordered Lunch special Padthai Shrimp with Chicken satay and Spaghetti green curry on Wednesday. Their foods are very small portions. Padthai for lunch portion seems like I had only couple bites and then all gone. I know it's only $7 for lunch but the portion is too small anyway. Amd I think they should have lunch special like 7-10 things for choosing. They have like 3 things for lunch and everyday is difference. Like if I want Padthai shrimp and chicken satay I have to come on Wednesday only. So I don't think it's good choice. So I don't think I will come back.,5E_jlZN9wDciEvRGzc1TsQ,1,0,2,95Tnf7KBn5uGscx8gTSeqw

1559534,2015-11-08,5,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,"When you're located in the same block as Weera Thai, you're going to have a hard time if your kitchen isn't up to par- the dining room is nice and going for a more upscale vibe, but they have cheap ($7) weekday lunch specials. But unfortunately the food just wasn't up to par for me.

FISH CAKES APP: 5/$10 Small, oily, and a bit bland. I enjoyed the cucumber dipping sauce but this didn't pop needed a hit of acidity or something.
PAPAYA SALAD: BF requested this and devoured the entire portion. Sauce was slightly spicy, did not like the half-frozen green beans used though.
CRAB FRIED RICE: This was listed on the board as a daily special. Portion was large enough, and I like that the extra bit of attention and effort were put into presentation even though this was a takeout order. However, I asked for a spice level of 5 (on their 1-10 scale) and this had no spice whatsoever. I ended up dumping two cups of chili paste and some red pepper flakes into the dish to give it some heat. It's a huge pet peeve of mine to be asked for a spice level and then not even take it into account when cooking the dish. It was even on the receipt so I'm not sure who dropped the ball.

Located in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it spot on Sahara next door to a leather goods shop, it's not necessarily a place I'll return- the food was fine, but didn't have anything about it to stand out from the sea of other thai places on the block.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,7,3,6BxQY4IyUm-hq7qL8EysAQ

Very nice and they are very quick to refill waters without asking, checking back often, if you even make eye contact at all, they'll likely come over.  And the food is great too.  I'm not able to handle a lot of spicy and I ordered a 5 thinking that's middle of the road, but it was a bit too spicy for me.  It was doable and still good but I was chugging water.

My meal started off with the owner approaching us and introducing himself to us, Ken. He talked with us and let us know that everything was made in house. The recipes they used are traditional and after tasting them, you can tell it is different than most other Thai places. Ken recommended to us trying the fish cakes and chicken wings. The fish cakes had a slight crisp on the outside and a chewy inside. The chicken wings were marinated overnight with their own recipe and had the fried outer layer and a nice tender inside. After came out main dishes. I ordered the panang curry and the rest of my party ordered pad thai. The panang curry was really good. It was a bit sweet and had a nice strong curry flavor that was aided by the coconut milk. The pad thai was good as well, but different than most commercial Thai places. The fried egg roll and dumpling that came with the the lunch special were fried to perfection and were nice and crispy on the outside, with a soft inside. After out lunch, we had dessert, a chocolate cake. Ken let us know that all the desserts are made in house by his wife since his wife has a baking background. The chocolate cake was absolutely delicious. To say the least, it was a great ending to our lunch.

They do a 1-10 sliding scale; I got an 8 and it was an eye rinser - delicious and deadly.  The outside and the mall outlet it's in are a little run down, but the restaurant itself is very nice and comely.

I heard about this place through my boyfriend. The first time we stopped by few weeks ago, it was closed. I  called them today but noone picks up the phone. Anyways, we decided to drive there. 

The place is small and with cute table settings. Pleasant Thai music were playing in the background. The menu looks to be authentic Thai food.

We went there for lunch and it was served on time. We ordered kinthai chicken wings, very crispy and good, comes with a sweet sauce. They sliced the wings into half which was interesting. Pad see Eww with pork was equally palatable and Kinthai fried rice was gratifying too.

The spice rating is 1-10, and it usually comes pretty spicy. So I like to down the spice a notch and get the spice tray.

We tried this restaurant with a great Groupon deal and so glad we did! It's now one of our favorite restaurants! We ordered eggrolls, larb, crab curry, basil beef,  chicken pad see ew, and thai tea, all were delicious. We liked it best because it wasn't over powering with fish sauce on everything. 
The service was great the lady that helped us was nice and very accommodating. I highly recommend coming here and we'll definitely be going back!",NFodPTpbWK7dSymxaBiUXg,2,1,5,faW2HPKFSvusZfMsbwvZ2A
4693388,2015-12-28,0,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,There was no one in the place so the chef/owner engaged us in conversation both before and after dinner including a display of his tattoos that mirrored the mural on the back wall. The menu is pretty much what you will find in every other Thai restaurant so we ended up with shared orders of Pad Thai with shrimp and stir fried basil chicken.  Both were well executed.,L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,0,3,einFcQmEcCPtTnmrCaXPJw

4934455,2016-04-03,1,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,"Wanted to have Thai tonight with our friends to celebrate a birthday and the choices were Lucki Thai, Table Thai and Bistro and Kinthai!  Since some of us had been to Lucki and to Table Thai, we decided on Kinthai as a new experience to all.

Location - East Sahara and Valley View, about one block past Weera Thai.  Some decent parking. Always an interesting area, that East Sahara strip malls.

The Restaurant - Nicely decorated, about 10 booths and about 5-6 tables. Spacious and plenty of room.  They can accommodate groups of most size and if you have a large group, it can be quite good for that!

The Service - Seems family owned.  The owner or gentlemen that comes out to greet you seems to be very concerned about quality and style of his restaurant.  We were well into our conversation with our friends, so I did not engage with the owner as I normally would.  He came by several times to check on us, and that was great. We just did not speak too much with him as we were catching up with friends.

The Food -

Tom Yum Chicken - Spice 5.  I wanted to go higher, to 7 or 8 but we had a mixed crowd.  All the soups seem to have a shrimp base, and one of our friends cannot eat shellfish.  However, my wife who doesn't like spice at all thought the soup was the best compared to her other favorite places. I thought that the soup had the right amount of kick to at least feel the heat and so i was happy.  Very excellent soup, comes out in a metal soup hotpot with the flames blasting through the top. Just the way i like it.

Pad Kee Mao - This was good but hardly spicy.  Normally a spicy dish itself, due to most of our friends not wanting spice, we ordered this at a level 2 spice out of 10 and it was good, just that I needed a bit of a kick in the spice and didn't feel it.  We had this with beef and the beef was tender. The noodles were good, but a bit clumped together.

Massaman Curry - With Chicken, spice level 2, good, rich creamy yellow curry with peanut, I thought it was very good overall.

Basil - With ground pork. again spice level 2.  Good overall, lots of meat, not too much basil.   I would order again or ask more questions like if they have eggplant and such.

Steamed Whole Fish - Not bad, liked the fish, bones and head came off quite easy and everyone enjoyed it. I tend to like steamed fish to be very juicy with lots of juice, soy sauce a bit of oil.  This was  a bit drier than I am used to but I did like it overall and I really enjoyed the amount of ginger they give you.  Of course I prepped the serving by deboning the fish and removing the head and I used my plate for all this so I can clean up the bones and the head of the meat which to me is the best part!

Loved the attention, enjoyed the menu, the ambiance, the flavors. Totally enjoyed the soup.  Would it be my most favorite Thai place? That will depend because tonight, we are going to Lucki Thai and will let you know!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,4,2,3,Hf7eR6qnfCDSBJJ1_GRfgw
5102205,2016-03-20,0,u29lf2yPd-qK5ThAS9FRQQ,"Mixed bag here.  We ordered the pad thai, chicken masaman curry and garlic beef.  The flavors on all three dishes were good, my favorite being the curry.  The curry flavor was strong and tasted sweet and delicious.  The garlic beef also had a nice flavor and the pad thai had a succulent fish sauce glaze.  The problem though was the freshness of ingredients.  The beef was super chewy, like they used really a cheap cut.  The shrimp in the pad thai was stringy and chewy like it was from a frozen stock.  The second part that was dissapointing was the portions were a bit small, espexially the pad thai.  
Hope they improve their quality a little and it will definitley be higher scores!",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,0,0,3,rTcAYjAlsHOkGTU5w2VUiA

Super clean restaurant, great theming, super nice staff, and AMAZING food. 

I recommend the Panang Chicken. Great portion size and superb flavors. 

Ken the owner personally introduced himself and welcomed us. He also told us about how he follows traditional recipes from Thailand. 

Overall, best Thai food I've had in Vegas. Can't wait to come back!",b5uG7MVEFBB21UReDEPlMQ,1,0,5,4yG6t2I_WZZm2mkJddudoQ

The Basil meat and Massaman chicken curry comes with a bowl of white rice each and if u switch the white rice to brown rice there is an extra $2 (just a friendly reminder not list it on the menu)!

Overall food are good and service are great with that said we will be back & DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU INSIDE THE RESTAURANT IS NICE",9kElsBhkHl-EzJo2gIZv2w,1,0,5,R2WMZTUvYC8DEoeoAbVakQ

The food was perfect: well executed dishes plated pleasingly and the 7 of 10 spice level I asked for left an impression but didn't linger past its welcome. Warm and inviting ambience for this hidden gem tucked away in an unassuming strip mall. Bring all your friends! This is great Thai food.

We ordered the pad Thai, masaman curry with chicken and fried tofu, and garlic beef. The pad Thai was okay, nothing special. It had shrimp in it that obviously we're not fresh. The masaman curry had a good flavor, and it was my favorite item. No complaints. The garlic beef however....was so chewy I ended up having to swallow the pieces practically in their original form. I could not masticate them if I tried. Which I did, for around 5 minutes before my jaw started hurting. The flavor was good, but the quality of the beef was terrible. Terrible. I would not return unfortunately, but I look forward to trying Weera Thai down the street from here.",ScwVhHmUFLZwVW9E5fvKjw,0,0,3,cLHXaTTWwmntpsb8EgGKew

We had pad Thai, tom yum fried rice, red curry, tamarind seabass, crab rangoons and pot stickers. I would recommend everything but the seabass - it wasn't my cup of tea. The tom yum fried rice was a highlight that I haven't had elsewhere. 

It's in a rough area but is clean and nice inside.
