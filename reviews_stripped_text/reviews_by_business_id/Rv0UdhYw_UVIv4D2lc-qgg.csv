176280,2017-11-09,1,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"I was very excited about this place when it first opened, but didn't have a chance to go. Despite the fact that my friend and her family had a bad experience with this place, i decided to pay a visit. 

The first time was good, i guess we were hungry and dying, so nothing to be complain about. 

The second time was yesterday, and the service was terrible. Even though the food is actually not that bad, I have to say, because of the waitress, and yes, I'm calling her name out: Sunny; my friend had decided that we wouldn't come back again. 

At first, we ordered oxtail soup and mini bosam, everything was fine. Then, my 2nd friend came in and we ordered kalbi-tang, which is beef short-rib soup, non spicy. The waitress asked us wether we wanted our soup with bone or boneless and even though we though it was weird since kalbi-tang never came boneless, we said yes. It came out very fast, and the soup was red. We asked them again before we even touched the soup, and they said it was the beef soup. Okay, so we dived in, ate it, and was still very confused because we thought the broth should be clear. About half way, I tasted the meat and it didn't taste like beef at all. My friend couldn't eat pork so we were very confused in that moment if that was the kalbi-tang that we ordered. The waitress came out again and asked if there were any problems and until this moment, she is still nice to us. 

However, the moment we said that this wasn't correct, and we ordered kalbi-tang which was not whatever spicy soup that we were eating, she gave us a very bad attitude. There was no apology and she started to lecture us. There was no such thing as proper customer service at all. Nothing like ""Let me see what I can do,"" or ""let me ask my manager for help,"" but instead she went on with saying and I quote, ""Just so you know, your friend pointed at the picture, so that is why I brought it out!"" Well, the fact that I pointed at one picture but said something else, she should have clarified it for us!! Indeed, i confirmed that we wanted Kalbi-tang and she still brought something out that is not we ordered. We did ask again before we touched it, and letting us know that it was the beef soup is already a lie. 

I really don't know what to say at that moment, all we wanted was to take the soup item off our check and yet we received nothing but bad service. She said that she couldn't take the item off the machine because we ate it half way already, AND because she stated it was our fault. What kind of customer service is that? No apology and arguing with the customers? I didn't want to make it as a big deal so i didn't ask for the manager and she even ended up ringing the check wrong even after we clearly explained to her how to divide it. 

I love this place because most of the food is very homemade Korean food like the kind that your mom will cook at home. But the service was without a doubt, most definitely unacceptable.

I don't usually write a review, I typically just rate the store, but this time, the experience was so bad that this type of customer service cannot go unheard of.",LozoD4X26YhLPMgAlU4W2Q,1,1,1,AtQHdTvgvG9ehboiNAdaOg

340495,2017-10-13,0,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"We were eager and excited to try TangTangTang based on the glowing 5 star Yelp reviews. The reality didn't meet expectations. We were extremely disappointed. I typically don't write bad reviews except in the case where we had a bad experience at a larger, more established restaurant. However, I think I need to leave an honest review to help offset all the suspicious 5 star reviews for this restaurant.

The Good:
Some of the food items were pretty good. Dumpling soup, kimchi, and the jap chae were better than your average Korean restaurant.

The Bad:
Their signature dish, the bone broth noodles, was the worst dish of the night. Maybe it's an acquired taste, but I thought the broth tasted like unseasoned bone water. The noodle and protein portions were also really small for $10+. We ordered both the oxtail and the brisket, and there just wasn't much there. Oh, and they messed up white rice. It was an overcooked, porridgey mess. Serving sub-par rice at an Asian restaurant should be a huge red flag. 

The Ugly:
The service was just awful. They were severely understaffed and only had 2 servers for the entire restaurant. Even with empty tables, it took forever to get a seat and even longer to order. The servers would avoid eye contact with us because they were overworked. They also have a large party 18% gratuity, which is fine, except that they don't have their POS system properly set up to apply the 18% so you have to do the math yourself. It may be proper policy but it's just crappy customer service.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,1,0,1,tB7ABoQl_ZILeiBeM1SlyA

Pork backbone soup: (5 stars) 
meat was very tender and fell off of the bone. The broth was very flavorful and refreshing. It came in a very large bowl and was plenty for one person. 

Rice cake and dumplilng soup: (5 stars) 
Consistency of the rice cakes were spot on. Cooked just right, not too soft where it was mushy but just right. Dumplings were very flavorful. Filled with a lot of stuffing (meat and kimchi veggies) slightly spicy. Very nice taste and good size dumplings and plenty of dumplings in the soup. Broth was very flavorful and became more so once flavors from the dumplings were broken into the broth.

__________________________

I just want to say that I la-la-LOVED my meal at Tang Tang Tang. Seriously, I was so indescribably happy to have eaten here. I used to avoid eating Korean food in Las Vegas altogether but this restaurant proved me wrong. Every bite was like a trip down memory lane, making me reminisce about my mom's amazing oxtail soup growing up.

So naturally I ordered the Oxtail Soup ($13.99) and my group of four shared the Spicy Braised Rib family size ($39.99). Needless to say that we inhaled every bit, the flavors were so spot on which I feel is a staple for authentic Korean food. If they end up expanding their menu past just soups and meat dishes, I would honestly live here despite the 20 minute drive.

Everything was perfect up until we got to the service mid-way through our meal, where we were without water, sides, and our additional food orders for over 20 minutes only to just give up on our requests. In the end, we just decided to close out our check instead; leaving a somewhat sad taste to our otherwise delicious meal. I will definitely be back soon regardless though because I truly would like to believe that the TangTangTang staff were just simply still trying to work out the kinks & finding their rhythm as a restaurant (having recently opened).

I recommend the Oxtail Soup with about 3 half-spoonfuls of sea salt & a pinch of pepper; it comes with free noodle refills!",-fVKgpmSu0tDnf_xBPqU4A,8,2,5,zWZWlrU4loy9YI-cOb_uWw

If I had to be picky.. I would like my potato in the soup to be cut into 1/4 instead of 1/2. One is cuz large chunk of potato tend to be more bland in the middle where the flavor hasn't cooked all the way through.  Another cuz we had 3 people and couldn't each have a potato.

1409464,2017-05-07,0,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"And here's to another visit to this place :D came here for dinner after watching a movie nearby. Arrived around 8pm and there were a few tables filled with a large party in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated at the same table last time (back left) lol... 

I wanted to try the sullungtang this time as last time they had ran out and would not serve it as it was not ready. Its great they wont serve a half-prepared broth, unlike some other place nearby. There are only a handful of places in Vegas that serves sullungtang. Aside from that fact, this place is probably the best place for sullungtang in Vegas, only 2nd to a restaurant thats not even in this city (Han Bat Sul Lung Tang in LA) and specializes in only this. Can't compare to Seoul so ill not compare with that. Lol 

Sullungtang is a ""plain"" soup made out of beef bones and/or oxtail boiled for hours resulting in a milky, beefy broth. As it is purely only bones, there is no flavor (sweet/savory) from any other ingredients. This soup is commonly misunderstood saying its plain but you HAVE to add your own salt, provided table side, typically sea salt, to your own liking. This was first to arrive and arrived quickly after ordering.  My friend had called this ""dishwater"" soup. Wtcrap man.. Then again, if ""dishwater"" was this good, id wash more dishes ! HAHAHA 

I had ordered the ""pick 2 meat"" variation ($12.99) which included choices of beef brisket, oxtail, and/or ox knee. I picked beef brisket and oxtail. I don't know what ox knee is to be honest LOL... never had it before. ""pick 3 meat"" is $13.99 and the plain beef brisket is $9.99. The soup comes with a good amount of beef brisket and 2 pieces of ox tail. Fairly generous amount of meat in comparison to another known place in vegas (E-Jo) and has the option for ""free refills of noodles"". A large bowl of chopped green onions is served to garnish your soup - add to your own desire ! i like a lot of green onions :) Sullungtang typically comes with a small amount of noodles and that's the amount in the refills as well. If I were to put it to a size comparison, its about the size of a large egg. Sullungtang is a very comforting, simple, clean soup. Good to have on a cold winter or when you are under the weather. It was great when Taeyeon's new song came on which made it even more enjoyable HAHA 

My friend had ordered the rice cake and dumpling soup as she had originally wanted the rice cake soup. I had ordered this previously with some other friends and it was really good. This time, the soup base seems much thinner and I think the amount of rice cake and dumplings varied. I'm pretty confident last time, we had 6 dumplings and a good amount of rice cakes to share. This time, the amount of rice cakes seems to be much less and only 5 dumplings. The soup base still tasted delicious and the dumplings were very flavorful. Friend had wished there were more rice cakes, as I would too. Another comforting dish. Mmmm 

Other friend had ordered the yukaejang which is the spicy beef soup. Typically yukaejang is a semi beef soup with shredded beef, mushrooms, bean sprouts, green onions, and gosari (edible ferns?). Their yukaejang is pretty flavorful and not too spicy. Good amount of spice for probably the majority. Lots of ingredients and you can add Udon ($2) or Ramen ($1) too. Very heart, ingredient filled soup. 

Aside from the varied amount of rice cake and dumpling, my only ""complaint"" this time was the service. They had forgotten to give us water until we had asked. We didn't ask until we had our food. They gave us our usual side dishes pretty fast as well as the chopped green onions for the sullungtang pretty fast so im sure they had just forgotten. 

When we asked for our bill, we had asked for split checks. According to one of the servers, that meant a even split of the entire bill. Lol. Be SURE to SPECIFY how you want to split the bill. Her English isn't the best out of the few waitresses. She had misunderstood about adding udon to the yukaejang earlier when ordering too thinking my friend wanted another order, but luckily she had came back to ask about it.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,1,4,islkFnR0VAbY4CYI6d-Vig

1670721,2017-05-10,3,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"My boyfriend and I frequent another Korean restaurant called Soyo, which is on the Southwest side of town. At Soyo, we typically order japchae and sweet & spicy pork --our two go-to items. Unfortunately, a majority of the food at Soyo is spicy and my stomach DOES NOT like when I eat spicy food. 

Anyway, I discovered TangTangTang on Facebook. A few of my Elite friends had attended the soft opening and posted mouth-watering photos of their soups. I was super excited that they had a lot of non-spicy options on their menu. Naturally, I made my boyfriend come with me that  weekend to try their dishes. :) 

The food here is ON. POINT. 

I had the beef brisket soup and my boyfriend ordered the japchae. The beef brisket was tender and flavorful without seasoning. High quality meat doesn't need to be hidden with sauces or tons of salt to taste good. The soup comes without additional flavor or seasoning so you can customize the flavor. Each table has Himalayan sea salt (I think) in a little jar so you can add the amount you like. The soup comes with a sauce mixture to dip the meat in or to add directly in the soup.

The jap chae was full of vegetables and very flavorful without being too oily. If you've ever had the vegetable jap chae at Soyo, this one tastes pretty similar but more subtle. 

The real standout though was the kimchi...OMG, the kimchi was the best I've ever had.  I've had homemade Korean kimchi before and prefer TangTangTang's take. 

The food here is authentic and really something special for Vegas.  The food is not as filling as K-BBQ, but perfect for a lunch or dinner date.  Definitely going to be coming back and trying more of their dishes!",EBbWynrvoJxKB2ykgR664A,7,3,5,VwfKMyGB7ht_39FYlXvkQA

Hilariously, I have actually not tried their sullangtang/other tangs that everyone else has been extolling. I know I definitely will try those soups out when the weather gets colder. But in the meantime, this post is all about their bossam and naengmyun. 

Both visits, we have gotten their mini bossam plate and naengmyun. For lunch, we had kimchi and radish banchan. For dinner, they also gave us japchae in addition to the other two banchans. Dinner also came with a bowl of rice to accompany my bossam. I'm not really sure if the banchan/rice change up is because we went for lunch/dinner or just because they like keeping us on our toes. I will update my findings after I come here a couple more times LOL.

Their naengmyun broth is just perfectly seasoned--honestly, I could just drink the broth all by itself without adding the mustard/vinegar; the meat that comes with it is tender and not tough at all (unlike other naengmyuns around town). You add vinegar and mustard to your liking; the spiciness and acidity make this dish so so refreshing and perfect for the ridiculously hot Vegas summers. 

Their bossam plate comes with an assortment of daikon, radishes, chives, and dipping sauces. Their meat is so so so tender and fatty, that it just melts into your mouth. I will note that the second time we went, the meat was not as tender (still good, but not as tender)--and I'm going to assume it's because the restaurant was super packed/busy. Roll the veggies in your bossam and you have a beautiful meat bundle of happiness.

This is probably my new favorite place in Chinatown. Who knows, maybe I'll visit for the third time this week.",QjZN6x1hGm2Edj95FfpKUA,6,4,5,keW-dd2imv5VBxLHk6KsfQ

1935630,2017-06-12,0,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"First, before I review this restaurant, I must make clear that I am not of Korean descent. Although I have been to Korea many times, and I have tried many Korean Restaurants in the States, my exposure to Korean food is limited to the famous Korean restaurants in Los Angeles and in Vegas. 

This restaurant is located in a strip mall. The interior decoration is relatively bare but enough for a local Korean family restaurant. Servers are friendly and attentive. However, the food may be a bit too Korean and not terribly suitable for non-Koreans.

My family came for lunch and had the following items:

Japche -- portion is small for an  $11 price. Vegetable variations are minimal in the dish.  As 
                advertised in the menu, there is no meat protein in this dish.  I like my Japche 
                warm, but this dish was served slightly colder than what I would prefer. The 
                taste is good though.  Grade B-.

Grilled Pork Bulgogi - portion is large. Spicy. Taste is good. What is not good is that they 
               use Pork Belly for this dish. This makes this dish very greasy in a way that I rejected  
               it after one bite - may be that is OK for a real Korean type dish but unfortunately, not 
               for me.  Grade D-. 

Galbitang -- Short rib soup. There is an ample amount of meat on the short ribs. The soup is 
                    quite tasty. This is not a heavy soup. However, the amount of vegetables and 
                    noodle in this dish is minimal making this dish a bit monotonous.  Grade B.

Sides dishes - Kimichi, Radish and marinated onion and pepper. Kimchi is good. Radish and 
                   onion are OK. Since they offer us only three spicy side dishes, it is a bit difficult for 
                   non Korean. I prefer some other Korean side dishes that are not as spicy, e.g. 
                   bean sprouts, spinach, potato salad, etc. Grade C-. 

For a non Korean, this restaurant is at best an OK place to eat. I do understand that Korean folks may feel differently though. Henceforth, a three star rating.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,1,0,3,R62m34-cXuXq8X4Lny5Ivw

We also got the mixed meat soup which was good, everyone liked it. Added onions and salt and tasted really good. My mom got the spicy beef soup which she enjoyed too.

Out of many hours on the stove, beautiful Sullungtang is produced! Korean options are on the rise along Spring Mountain these days, and they are great options at that! Tang Tang Tang, the name so nice they said it thrice, is offering up some quality Korean soups/stews. Specifically, Triple Tang is about Sullungtang, and variations on Sullungtang, though other soups and stews round-out their menu. Technically speaking, this is the best Sullungtang that I know of in Vegas...though there is a very similar version of bone broth in town that I still prefer...but in addition to a great Sullungtang, Tri-Tang also provides an appealing atmosphere, with wonderfully friendly service...something you won't find at all other places in town. If you're new to Sullungtang it can seem a little bland at first, but the truth is that a wealth of flavor is lurking...waiting to be uncovered. The Koreans reading this will know to add salt, pepper, scallions, and of course dadaegi (chili paste). The rest of us should try to fit in and do the same.Once you nurse this broth a little the literal hours of love that have gone in to making this broth are awakened in full-blown kraken style.  

My love ordered the Spicy Beef Soup. This was tasty as well, but for the most part I think I'll stick with my Sullungtang. After all I get a craving once or twice a year for Sullungtang, and nothing else will really satisfy that hankering.

The banchan is quite delicious and though they only serve kimchee and khakdugi. Service is quite good and the waitresses are attentive and friendly.

I'm happy bc every time I come to vegas and need soup the next day I usually just get pho but now that there's a good sullungtang place I have more choices. 

We got their side dishes and Bossam first. I must say that their kimchi and radish dish are so dang good. Which is really important bc it is supposed to complement the sullungtang (which is meant to be bland until you add all the salt/pepper/green onions). Their japchae is on the sweet side but super good. Bossam was really good as the pork had a very juicy texture and complemented well with the radishes and chives. (Be prepared if you use the garlic bc your breath will be kicking for sure). 

The gamjatang broth was so delicious. It had a strong flavor that was not too salty but had a good spicy kick to it. The meat fell right off the bone. I just wish they gave you the sauce on the side like they do in LA to dip the meat in. Idk what it's called. 

The oxtail soup was also very rich but had to add all the appropriate things to make it to my liking. 

Service: they checked in with us often and said to ask if we needed any more side dishes. Once they know you speak Korean they just stick with it. Kinda felt like I was in Ktown. Haha

Even my mother had her own recipe, and I remember the countless times she would prepare the sul lung tang broth by boiling ox bone over the course of an entire day to enrich the flavor of the soup. There's nothing like eating a hot bowl of sul lung tang along kimchi and kkakdugi (cubed radish kimchi), and I'm sure many Korean people/Korean food aficionados can relate. 

I've had sul lung tang all over LA, OC, and in Korea as well, and I gotta say that Han Bat in Koreatown Los Angeles has the best sul lung tang hands down. They have really set the bar high, so much so that I didn't have any expectations for this place. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The soup wasn't as dense nor flavorful as I would have preferred, but it tasted really clean. I don't think they use MSG either, because I didn't knock the eff out afterwards (MSG makes me suuuuppper sleeeepy). The beef in the sul lung tang was really tender, and the kimchi and kkakdugi were also pretty good.

Service was spot on. All the ajummas were really nice and accommodating, and they were happy to re-fill our banchan numerous times. Most places, the ajummas get annoyed and irritated when you ask them for more banchan lol.

The service was good. They were friendly and accommodating. They give you a pitcher of water (Just like in Korea) that way you have a good amount of water. We are so satisfied that whenever we are craving soup, this is immediately where we think of. It is a bit of a drive for us since we live North West but hey, maybe they will open one up there! But for now we will make the occasional drive once in a WHILE. 

Give this place a try and honestly if you don't know how to eat it, ask, best to have the dish the proper way and enjoy it than not and be a little bummed.",aCst736y4WZPO9Hz62D-mQ,1,0,5,adBDcVua7wOQlIvn9sykyA

3591777,2017-04-30,14,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"With Kkulmat Korean Kitchen and TangTangTang opening up in recent weeks, Korean food in Las Vegas has taken a turn for the better. While KBBQ is all over the place and recently opened restaurants have taken towards improving the scene, non-BBQ restaurants have been hit and miss and most of them lean towards being bars before restaurants.

There are a few options around Las Vegas that have good Korean food, but Kkulmat and TangTangTang legitimately have the taste of Korea in their cooking, with very little to no lean towards ""fusion."" When I eat at these places, I think of my mom's best dishes or eating in Korea or perhaps Koreatown in LA.

TangTangTang has only been open a couple of weeks, but word seems to be getting out that there is a Sulleongtang-specialized place in Chinatown. The very professional wall signs made me suspicious this was a chain or had an established base somewhere else and I couldn't help but ask and learned that there are locations in Korea. So this one probably isn't as mom and pop as a lot of the Korean restaurants, but brings with it some history and an established menu.

Sulleongtang (an ox-bone soup that is light in flavor - you add your own salt, green onions, and whatever kimchi or radish you'd like), Naengmyun (Buckwheat noodles either served with spicy sauce or in an ice-cold broth), Ddukguk (rice cake soup optionally with dumplings and such), and Galbijjim (a stew featuring braised short ribs in a rich thick broth with veggies) are among the dozen or so options that are featured on the menu (with varities of almost all of these). They also have Bossam, which isn't particularly common which is a steamed pork belly served along with condiments and is traditionally eating wrapped in lettuce, though we didn't have wrapping lettuce when we tried it. Additionally, they have some BBQ plates like LA Galbi.

We haven't had a chance to try everything (and probably wouldn't ever try it all) but the Sulleongtang is solid. I found the broth a little thinner and lighter in flavor than ideal (for the best I've ever had, nothing competes with Han Bat in Los Angeles), but when mixed all up still creates that marriage of flavors that makes it very satisfying. Don't be shy about adding salt and green onions and throwing in your rice and kimchi. One thing that is particularly nice is their brisket is the best I've had in this type of soup (it's often an afterthought compared to other parts of the dish). Oh - the kimchi here is delicious with a strong garlic flavor and a satisfying sweetness to it.

My personal favorite so far was actually the Kimchi Dumpling and Dduk (rice cake) soup. It has a ton of flavor enhancing the flavor of the Dduk and Dumplings and was very satisfying. The egg and brisket complete the dish well. 

The Bossam was quite good, though we felt the pork belly was a little overcooked. Instead of being melt in your mouth, the meat was a tad tough. When eating a piece with more fat than meat, it was a little better.

Lastly, we tried the Gamjatang in Hot Pot form to be shared. Pork neck-bone stew is not my personal favorite, but it was pretty decent with the meat falling off the bone and plenty of potatoes and other veggies with lots of spices added. Still, it's a little too much work for me to eat!

Service was quite adequate, with servers generally on top of things. However, I will note that the first day we went they were out of Sulleongtang and were running out of Bossam so we had to get the smaller portion. For a place that hasn't been open long, understandable if a little frustrating. Still, it didn't take away from our experience as we were able to try more dishes this way.

Prices are definitely reasonable - Sulleongtang alone is plenty to feed a person and is priced at 9.99. Other dishes are generally around the same price or a little more expensive with most of the individual portion sizes not exceeding 11.99, while bigger share-sized stews hitting almost 30 dollars and Galbijjim (which is normally quite expensive) nearly 40 dollars. 

I was surprised this place didn't get much coverage - but nearly every table was occupied at lunch on a Saturday so I think the word is getting out there. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some solid Korean food that isn't fusion, bar food, or BBQ and along with Kkulmat have definitely upped the quality of available options in Las Vegas. If you haven't tried this type of Korean food, you're are definitely missing out!

Pork Back Bone Soup: The broth was very flavorful with a strong pork and marrow flavor, it's not a light tasting broth like pho. I don't know if the strong flavor would be for some that didn't grow up with the flavors.

Steamed Pork: This dish is the star of the place. Nothing can beat pork belly with veggies. The meat is cooked perfectly and is really juicy. The veggies are fresh and crisp. It comes with a shrimp and fish kind of sauce that goes perfectly with the veggies and pork belly.

They take the time to air seal all of there orders (Just like the lids at a boba shop), which is amazing when you are to going soups.

Bossam- Perfect portion for sharing! The meat isn't super fatty, nice and flavorful. Comes with the traditional sides. 5/5
LA Kalbi- Comes out on a sizzling platter with some onions and jalapenos. They don't skimp out on quality meat. I've been places where the meat is all practically fat. Really good!

TangTangTang is a Korean restaurant in a Spring Mountain space formerly inhabited by a vaguely Korean-inspired concept, Buldogis Cafe. The parking area isn't great but it was far easier to park here than at the sprawling yet insanely crowded plaza just north on Jones. I was still getting over a cold tonight, including some on-and-off congestion, but I still couldn't pass up the opportunity to check it out for the first time with some friends.

I had an idea of what I wanted from the menu, and a Korean tablemate who's a veteran of this shop also suggested going for one of the Ox Bone soups (sul lung tang). Being the adventurous type, I picked the #5 ($13.99), which had all three meats: beef brisket, ox knee, and ox tail. I probably would omit at least the ox tail next time because it doesn't fall off the bone readily, but the thinly sliced brisket was delicious and the ox knee was a perfectly soft gelatinous treat.

The broth itself is white and creamy, as I know certain Japanese pork bone broths can be. I wish that they would season it instead of leaving it up to the diner. That, along with the server's advice of salting it lightly, delayed my full enjoyment until I upped the salt level to about 1.5 small spoonfuls partway through the meal. When I got there, it became quite slurpable though not addictive (and not that easy without deeper spoons).

The items presented on the side were all enjoyable: chopped green onions (to be added to the hot soup), pickled radish and peppers (not too spicy), and white rice were enjoyable. I also loved each of the small selection of banchan (side dishes): a surprisingly spicy kimchi, a not-so-spicy pickled dish, and japchae (glass noodles).

I also tried some Spicy Grilled Pork Ribs ($18.99). They were marinated well, not that spicy to me, and served with nicely caramelized onions. I enjoyed most of all cleaning off one of the ribs which the server had left after cutting the meat into more manageable pieces for us.

Service was okay, with water pitches running out at the end; I guess we were all thirsty. The orders seemed to arrive fairly quickly too. Decor was modern, similar to some other Korean places, although I didn't enjoy the atmosphere the entire time because it got louder as the room filled up. No beer is served here either.

I'm not as enamored yet with the soups of TangTangTang as I have been with such dishes as soft tofu stew, ramen, and pho, but I still enjoyed what I've eaten here so far. Hopefully I'll be back soon to try some more of the menu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,4,zFAiyR9lG6Jvx11SjunKtA

TangTangTang is a pretty authentic Korean restaurant with soups as their main specialty. I've been looking forward to trying out this place since it opened back in April and was excited to finally go! 

- Banchan (Side Dishes)
Kkakdugi, kimchi, and japchae were provided as sides with our entrees
**Kkakdugi (radish kimchi) was ripe and delish
**Kimchi (spicy fermented napa cabbage) was spicy and refreshing
**Japchae (stir fried glass noodles) had great seasoning and tasted pretty authentic 

- Bossam (Boiled Pork Belly) $13.99 for the mini portion 
I may have stalked out their yelp and instagram page and knew I had to try the Bossam here. The pictures all looked extremely appetizing so of course we had to order it as a starter (it definitely did not disappoint and lived up to the mouthwatering pictures!) The pork belly slices were boiled to perfection and super tender. The dish also came with chunks of spicy radish kimchi, pickled white radish, Korean chives, and a side of sliced jalapenos, garlic, miso paste, and fermented salty baby shrimp.  Holy. Yum. The boiled pork belly literally melted in your mouth and the different sides to pair with the meat completed each and every bite! 

- Yukaejang (Spicy Beef Soup) $10.99
The piping hot soup was filled with an abundance of meat, veggies, glass noodles, and egg. The heat was great, however, they definitely went easy on the salt. Good thing there was a side of sea salt on each table - all it needed was a small spoonful and the soup tasted much better! The broth was very hearty and overall the Yukaejang was pretty decent  
 
- Gamjatang (Spicy Pork Neck Soup) $9.99
My friend ordered this soup and asked for no bones. The Gamjatang here came out sizzling hot and was filled with pork meat, potatoes, greens, and other veggies. He really enjoyed soup and described the flavor as deep and hearty with extremely tender meat. He also thought the soup lacked some salt - I tried a bite after he added in some salt and thought the broth was extremely flavorful! 

No complaints with the service - the ladies working were very polite and replenished our banchan when requested. Food came out quickly which was great because we were starving. 

- 5/5 for the banchan (Kkakdugi was bomb)
- 5/5 for the Bossam (this dish definitely trumped all) 
- 5/5 for the service 
- 4/5 for the Yukaejang and Gamjatang

You're supposed to cook the bones and simmer it for hours until the broth turns milky but their soup was so clear that I could almost see the bottom of the bowl. They also put way too much vinegar in the naengmyeon and still gave us a bottle if we wish to add more. Bossam was average and there weren't a lot of meat. Also the kimchi and radish side dishes had a very ""raw"" taste because they weren't fermented long enough. I liked their rice though and the stainless steel water jug. However, we were really irked by the fact that they kept talking to us in Korean even after we responded in English. Just because we understand what you're saying doesn't mean we are Korean!! A non-Asian couple came in and they talked to them in English and it's quite frustrating because whenever I go to a Korean restaurant they would automatically speak Korean to you if you are Asian. This happens mostly at non-kbbq Korean places but most of the time they would get the idea if I respond in English.

Finally, a place in Vegas that specializes in gammjatang (spicy pork back bone AKA neck bone soup) and sullungtang (beef bone soup).  Before you get all excited, it doesn't surpass the legendary, uber extraction achieved at LA's Han Bat Sul Lung Tang, then again, nowhere does.  This is still very good eats.

Gamjatang - well extracted pork stock with decent amount of gelatin.  Wonderfully spicy with copious amounts of Korean chili flakes and chili sauce.  Garlic goodness tempered  by the obvious addition of fermented soybean paste and fish sauce.  Freshness from fresh sliced chilies, and the characteristic flavor of parilla leaves (Korean version of Shiso).  The meat from the bones, tender and delicious, picking up all the broth's goodness.  Noodles, potatoes, and reconstituted dried radish leaves all add substance.  This is a hearty, fiery, satisfying bowl.  

Sullungtang - well extracted, murky and gently thickened with extracted gelatin.  Beef broth accented with the natural peppery flavor of boiled radish this time accented by garlic and green onions. and a hint of sesame. Enoki mushrooms a nice touch.  Three meats on offer; boiled brisket, ox knee and oxtail, alone or in any combination.  Recommend combining the knee and tail.  The brisket is honestly, boring in comparison and lacks beefy flavor.  Soft noodles a good filler.  Don't forget to season your soup with the provided salt else it's on you.

Standard and tasty banchan.  A few non soup items on the menu (grilled kalbi, spicy pork, bossam) making it easier to drag the hold out who needs more substance.  

Admittedly, it's  kinda hard to stomach during the summer heat but on a cool fall day, this will definitely hit the spot.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,19,22,4,E6kB1s5cp1NfkmgzT5316w

At 8pm on a weekday, place was almost packed so I had to wait. There was no one in front to acknowledge me and sit me down so I had to wait awkwardly for a few minutes. A lady towards back saw me, and I looked at her, waiting for her to escort me to a table, but she just kept keeping busy around there. After like the third glance, I gave her a ""?!?"" signal and then she asked, ""how many?"" -_- So that wasn't too good of a reception. Even after I said ""1"" I didn't get seated for a while. Definitely could use some proper service there, even as a Korean restaurant greeting a Korean guest (me).

Once I was seated though, things started turning for the better. Menu was nice and clear, though I wished they had combos of their signature soups (tang) + 1/2 portion meat dishes. I ended up ordering 2 combo tang with beef brisket & cow knee tendon & a mini-bossam (chilled sliced pork dish). 

Starting with banchan, I knew this was a good choice. Japchae was al dente and flavorful (never thought i'd say this about a... japchae...), tasty jalapeno pickle (i think this was for dipping the tendon though), and legit kimchi and ggakdoogi (radish kimchi). 

Bossam came out with assorted radish wrap, radish pickle, and greens, with its three dipping accompaniment (salted shrimp paste, garlic&green pepper, and ssamjang bean paste). Pork was nice and moist, slightly fragrant and was amazing with the dips and wraps! 

When my tang came out, I dove right in with couple ggakdoogis dumped in. I put some sea salt they had on the side and the soup was very hearty and the perfect remedy for long, not-so-well-eaten work day. Nice quantity of meats and noodles inside as well. 

Food was so good that I was going on eating like I was starved for three days. Washing it all down with nice, tasty ice water. (no liquor license yet so couldn't get my beer) 

What was I doing all this time traveling here for month and a half eating shitty hotel food? 
'Beats me.' I thought as I left happy and utterly satisfied. 

Just up the service level a bit and you have a 5-star right here!",n0oAW6bE6ZIR9vFyJhq56Q,2,0,4,R7KoxUDwpw8xGs-rygIjbQ

5349177,2017-04-30,6,Rv0UdhYw_UVIv4D2lc-qgg,"If you want to try the best kimchi in Vegas, if you want to try the best gamjatang in Vegas, if you want to try the best sullungtang in Vegas, and/or if you want to try the best dumpling/rice cake soup, then TangTangTang is there for you. 

We came here to TangTangTang last night for dinner and once more today for lunch. We have tried a total of four different dishes. TangTangTang's full restaurant name is TangTangTang Sullungtang, which means that they should be specializing in sullungtang. 

Gamjatang is a spicy pork neck bone soup. They have two different sizes of this dish: individual serving and a hot pot size that could be shared between 3-4 people. There aren't a lot of restaurants that offer this dish, which is quite unfortunate. The only places that I know that offer this dish is Soyo and Mamaoh -- both places offering a hot pot size. TangTangTang's version is not the best I've had. I've had better in LA but that's usually where all the good Korean food is. However, it is very flavorful and the pork neck bones that they used are cooked quite well that the meat falls off the bones. 

Sullungtang is a dish that requires specialization. It is made out of beef bones or oxtail bones. You essentially have to simmer the bones for hours, at least 6+ hours, in order to get a milky, creamy texture into the soup. It has no flavor but it will have a nice beefy aroma. You'll need to garnish it with green onions and add salt to it to get the taste you want, thus customizing it to your own personal taste buds. It comes with slices of beef brisket and rice noodles. 

TangTangTang is no Han Bat Sullungtang, which is my favorite restaurant for sullungtang, and it is located in LA. TangTangTang, once again, is not the best I've had, but despite that, it is the best in Vegas. I can absolutely say that with confidence. TangTangTang's version comes with a hearty portion of beef brisket and rice noodles into their servings, which may or may not be a good thing. You are getting your money's worth and their beef brisket is of really good quality. It is nicely marbled and almost melts in your mouth. I, on the other hand, could do with less noodles. Sullungtang is not a noodle dish -- it is a soup that is to be eaten with rice so it will always come with a bowl of rice on the side. 

If you are curious, the only other place in Vegas that specializes in sullungtang is E-Jo. However, E-Jo's version has a much thinner base and less of that beefy aroma. Soyo also has sullungtang on their menu -- I have tried it once and don't remember much about it. I am quite happy to know that I won't have to travel 4 hours to get decent sullungtang. Their version is no different from some of the ones I've tried in Korea. 

My friends and I shared an order of their bossam. They have two sizes: a mini size and a full size. The mini size is pretty much appetizer size and a full size, well, could be a main meal. Bossam is slices of pork belly that comes with an assortment of sides that you could make a lettuce wrap with. It traditionally comes with napa cabbage as the wrap but many restaurants now offer lettuce instead. You usually wrap it with kimchi, ssamjang (soy bean paste), oysters, etc. For TangTangTang's version, you get radish slices, radish kimchi, and chives to eat with your pork belly. So you don't really get to wrap it here at TangTangTang. Their version is good but the only thing was that they over steamed their pork belly so the meat itself was a little on the tougher side. 

As for their kimchi dumpling/rice cake soup ... their kimchi dumplings were delicious. If you don't like kimchi, don't order this -- order the regular dumpling. The soup base for this was nicely done and nicely flavored. It is very clean and yet not too bland. Many places that offer this dish usually has a very bland soup base but TangTangTang makes an effort not to bore you.

As like many Korean restaurants, you get banchan, which are side dishes, with your meal. TangTangTang offers you kimchi, radish kimchi, and japchae. Their kimchi is probably the best I've had in Vegas -- its flavor profile is actually very similar to ones I've had in Seoul, Korea. The garlic is quite prominent in their kimchi and it contains a tiny bit of sweetness to it. It is VERY different from the kimchi I've had at other Korean restaurants around the valley. Their japchae deserves a mention as well. It was done well and the flavors weren't overly sweet like how many places like to do it. 

If you are looking for the usual KBBQ joint, this place is not for you. TangTangTang features traditional Korean soups and other traditional dishes, such as bossam and kalbi jjim (braised short ribs). I, for one, am ecstatic to know that the valley finally has one more traditional option for Korean food that's NOT KBBQ. While KBBQ is delicious...I sometimes crave for something more comforting. I am also ecstatic to know that I no longer have to travel 4 hours for some of these dishes.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,19,9,5,7E8zwlD6qDQaed9yHFtyzA

The pork is always cooked perfectly through, and the accompanying radish and green onions are fresh and crunchy. Really recommend!

I always manage to have some of my family's or friends soups. This time around I was dining with my best friend and she ordered the Spicy Beef Soup (#16). Man was it spicy! We could have used two more bowls of rice to help us finish it but Im sure its the perfect amount of heat for those more accustom to spice. The dish itself actually contained a lot of beef mushrooms and noodles too. 

The only downside (which absolutely does not warrant a minus-star) is the banchan. Theres only kimchi, radish kimchi, and japchae.

We had pork back bone soup, steamed pork, spicy pork ribs, and shortrib.",tbwm5iT2uK-Hz4sEYgJdLA,0,0,5,XiaGSnJZ5X69XJ_J8zvyFw

I think I just didn't order the right things, their famous steamed pork which I had twice isn't really as tender as some reviews made it out to be. BUT, ever since I discovered their spicy beef soup, I have been coming back twice a week. I love everything about that soup, and this is the only restaurant I would drive out of the way for now.",oK1v-yP9ygKWg6M19wWYIQ,0,0,5,T3bK_nKhjhWbi__3osd_cA

The city needs more non-KBBQ Korean restaurants and TangTangTang fills that void and then some.  Truly delicious cooking here, the Chap Chae might be the best I've had.",BJt5rHl8ETUsWZmdwJnS1g,1,0,5,P61AogtQnFVjdmOWtZG_lg

A place that just does Korean noodle soups and does them extremely well? Sign me up!

The food was good. Tasty side dishes. Flavorful, rich broth. Exactly what was advertised on the tin - a solid 4-5 stars for the price. Nice decor, too.

Unfortunately, service was dreadful. 

Took years to just get our water. Our waitress was extremely neglectful and condescending to the simplest requests. We requested small bowls like every other diner in the restaurant had. Far from apologizing for forgetting them, she practically sneered at us.

Getting anyone's attention was impossible. The waitresses would actively avoid eye contact. And if you did catch their attention? They would pretend you didn't.

Worse, other tables got far more attentive service, orders taken before ours, less things forgotten, etc. I did notice the better treated tables were all Korean. Hmm...

Overall, good food. But bad service colors the entire experience. Hope they improve, as it has a lot of potential.",uSDie7Nl_CZ9mFOvjXo-hg,0,0,2,5yf2lF3PBAjjtCjlOBz74w

I always get excited over oxtail soup because every oxtail soup I've ever had was extremely flavorful, aka Hawaiian oxtail soup. I knew it wouldn't taste like Hawaiian oxtail soup, but I was thinking that it would at least be as flavorful. Their signature oxtail soup was bland and tasteless. I put salt, pepper, added the scallions, and some chili paste and got something going on. But now it just tasted like salty watery gochujang? The oxtail was not tender and there wasn't a lot of it in the dish as you can see in the picture. 

The service was pretty good. No problems there. 

My friend's beef dumpling and rice cake soup was pretty good, but nothing worth coming back for. Maybe I'll try it again one day and order something different? Maybe.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,2,0,2,fo0NaU9Ec07XsCuGtVXe-g

The staff did pretty well with our many questions and requests we had from each side of the table. We chose to order a few things off of the menu and eat them family style since there was so many of us. 

We got the spicy grilled pork ribs, grilled beef short ribs, 
2 Spicy sausage kimchi hot pot, 2 grilled pork bulgogi, and braised spicy beef ribs. 

Everything was delicious ,but my favorite was the bulgogi. The hot pot looked like ramen with hot dogs in it but was very yummy and had the right amount of spice to it. The spicy beef ribs was a little tough for me to eat so I passed it off to my husband. 

Overall, the staff was very friendly and patient with us and gave us good service. The food was good. I would come back here again to try some of the other things on their menu.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,kYl4-PcV01yJVg00JucGSA
