They were out of batter and the employee said she was cleaning up so she wasn't going to make more. For reference, it was before 8pm and the park was busy.

I had one of their top selling cones which is the Pacific Sea Salt and it was so good especially with the hot weather and all. Filled with Nutella, fresh strawberries and cream. YUM!",csxC4PvCdmCFe5ajEsruSw,0,1,5,JkKXpHBod4kqCGNSDcMIMA
1436084,2017-08-16,1,KiO4n-yRhKM0SZhGpsD49Q,I found this place by them following me on my Instagram. I finally found the time to go downtown to check them out. They are located in Container Park. I went in and the place is small but a lot of the shops in Container Park are. I ordered the Pacific Sea Salt. Every thing that is a Specialty with the waffle is made to order. It truly is made with love. The gelato with the Bubble Waffle was AMAZING! The warm waffle with the cold gelato was just right and an amazing combination. I hope they get real popular and open other locations within Las Vegas!,Hv3Wc3Fn1EecCLsddrdwfw,2,1,5,i5McY58SDvoJ30CzIcn2SA
1490525,2018-04-20,0,KiO4n-yRhKM0SZhGpsD49Q,Homemade plump waffle used to make an amazing Colosseum Waffle! Nutella & fresh banana lined the waffle to receive a large scope of strawberry cheesecake gelato. It was absolutely amazing! My husband and I shared one because I didn't think I could finish it. I probably could have finished my own & will definitely order my own next time. Love this place! I forgot to get a picture of it and only remember after it was all gone. It was THAT good!,Cb4ghgsMdWkd13mwrZGtnQ,0,0,5,y_z9Tjne68spA9Vf5Bzqkg

It started out poorly when the woman (named Fatima) behind the counter snapped at my friend to close the door. There was no sign asking that the door be kept closed, and we would have been very understanding had she asked kindly. Instead she chose to be overtly rude. 

I tried the gelato, and it was by far one of the worst things I've ever had. I considered asking for an exchange for something else, but they were sold out of every flavor they had on their menu. After the poor service and the horrible gelato, I asked for a refund. Fatima was again rude, and called her manager to ask how to complete the refund. She started out the call with ""some lady who didn't like the ice cream wants a refund,"" again with a rude tone. 

I would absolutely not go here again. I'd like to give Fatima the benefit of the doubt. I know people have bad days and take their negativity out on others. But, even with a different worker or better service, the product was still terrible.",ZPhKlpS80fdKizePntfcDQ,0,0,1,0QZfuoTFBeZInuQsIZC0nA

The crispiness of the waffle and the soft interior was the perfect complement to the gelato. The woman working there was absolutely amazing and very patient with me trying the different flavors.  The place isn't that large, and it does get a little busy sometimes, but it is definitely worth a trip to for anyone.

The menu of bubble waffles and shakes suggests signature combinations or one may customize their own. The bubble waffles are griddled fresh and served hot, creating a nice contrast to the gelato. A plastic gelato spoon was a suitable utensil for separating pieces of the waffle to eat with bites of gelato and toppings. Gelato is brought in from California in eight flavors: bubblegum, mango, passion fruit, vanilla, chocolate, salted caramel, cookies and cream, and strawberry cheesecake. Waffles are made from original or chocolate flavored batter. I was very satisfied with my original waffle, cookies and cream gelato, topped with more Oreos and chocolate syrup. Service was welcoming and friendly. With individual desserts running around $8 and shakes just under $6, the bill adds up quickly for a family.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,13,11,4,eBgWJ4Z4OV7j0orSlELf8A

The waffles are yummy but it's truly the sorbet & ice cream that makes this place stand out!

To beat the Las Vegas heat, your going to want something to cool you down!

From gelato to sorbet, waffle cone or bubble cone, you'll definitely cool down the Las Vegas hotness with something kewl like this place.

Grab a cone and enjoy walking around the heat!

I recommend the pineapple sorbet or the mango.

So refreshing!!

Maybe getting a milk shake might keep you kool!

Who cares! It's frosty and delicious & you kids will want it!

Enjoy

If based strictly on flavor, this would be six stars despite the Yelp-permitted five. The pineapple sorbet was absolutely ridiculous. My taste buds have never experienced anything so perfect in their 37 years of existence. Light and sweet, this sorbet is clearly made with actual fruit and its juice, as there is is the perfect amount of pulp mixed in throughout the entire cone. 

How do I think we offer can be improved? I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to my frozen treats, so a waffle really isn't my thing. If I can get this in a huge cup, I would pay a pretty penny for it. I would love to see this option added to the menu.

So why the four stars instead of five? Customer service. The girl who waited on us seemed definitely bothered by our very existence inside of the establishment. While she was barely serving us she was busy texting on her phone (black cat phone case) and never even made eye contact with us. There wasn't a single smile during our entire exchange and we felt shafted by the digital check out system had us automatically 15%. She definitely did not deserve a tip.

Despite the bad service I will absolutely be back so that I can fill my mouth with amazing pineapple sorbet and also a lemon for the road.",uYlzvshOSWCTwNLFBELTug,2,3,4,8UHkL5XKokiv9iaAv4Jwxw
