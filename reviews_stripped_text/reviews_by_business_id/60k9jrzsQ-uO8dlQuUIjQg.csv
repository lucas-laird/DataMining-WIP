We were forwarned that they could not get a shipment of tomatoes due to inclement weather in Utah, where their tomatoes come from. So, I was stuck with a ""salad"" that was basically lettuce and cheese.  Yup, that's their today's version of salad.  
The Jr. Yelpers ended up with burgers (including a Jr. Whopper) without tomato.  They have dine-in seats but the atmosphere was unappetitizing.  Even the onion rings which I generally like at most BKs, didn't taste as good at this place.  While leaving the casino, Jr. Yelpers spotted a leprechaun walking about the casino.  In other words, a small person in a green costume.  OK, entertainment for the kids is included here.",swmrfBnaqU0nyJ3pFBfNgQ,2,2,2,c0QMHpa-ModHeXQIPA6U4g

Imagine my surprise to literally stumble upon the only Burger King on the strip being called out by a ""little person"" announcing beer pong at O'Shea's. Beer pong was our first thought, but after realizing just how intoxicated we were figured some alcohol absorption was a better bet. Sure it's expensive for a fast food joint, but when you have to have it, cost really isn't an issue. An oasis in an overpriced food market and literally in the middle of the desert, this location gets 4 stars just for being what it is, where it is, when you need it.",lgUKLRsqvhu4DbM9syzq_Q,0,0,4,tcWdfxkiszonn1fKK3l42g

Perhaps, this is mean, but I am only speaking the truth.  It is probably the smokey environment that is rotting their brain cells.  

I step up and give him my order, ""#4 with medium onion rings and a diet coke.""  He slowly repeats after me while pushing some buttons on his register.  So, I move on, ""yeah, and a whopper junior, no mayo please.""  But, he slowly repeats my first order another 2 times.  OK fine, not everyone is as quick on the ball.  So, after he gets the second part of my order, he asks me if it's eat in or take out.  I told him, ""to go please"" and he responds with, ""OK, for here.""  I seriously thought he was kidding so we just stared at each other and I didn't say anything.  

After what was nearly a 10 minute wait, our food comes out and I have fries instead of onion rings!  And the food is on a tray!  Ugh.  I did not have the patience to wait another 10 minutes to get the order right, so we just asked for a bag and bagged our order and left.  Now, I slightly feel like a jackass for writing such a mean review but I guess I need to work on my anger management issues first.",xAyZ1xeaW9zaB1faQBNroA,0,1,1,nhEzf9RRlxapf5pipWMtvg

If you make it to this part of O'Sheas, you know, the back part with the beer pong tables and the Subway and the weird Taco place and the punching bag strength machine, what really are your expectations of a BK? What are you expecting that would warrant more than 2 stars? Complimentary champagne perhaps? Red carpets? Kim Kardashian behind the register? 

I don't remember the last time I came to O'Sheas and made it to BK without being drunk. O'Sheas doesn't exactly carry the holier than thou attitude that most of the other bars and lounges on the strip do. So, most everyone here is drunk, almost drunk, hung over or drunk. Oh, and hungry. Enter this Burger King.

It's pretty cheap food. Considering how much the entrees are at Hash House a Go Go next door at Imperial Palace is, or the Cafe at Harrahs and Burger Joint at Flamingo (all within walking distance of O'Sheas and open late), the food here is a steal! We all know that, which is why we walk all the way to the back of O'Sheas to this place. It serves its exact purpose. Provide cheap, fast and greasy food. And for that, they should be admired not admonished. 

So what if you get the runs the next day. It's probably from all the alcohol anyway. So what if the employees look like the ""after"" shots of Faces of Meth. So what if the food takes longer than registering your car at the DMV. It's vegas, relax.",R12GCq7XczBpP99KzenLAQ,2,1,4,fALTboTKMoAWsWUi9FAntA

If you're looking for the cheapest option on the Strip, this is it. 

I went here on 4/29/11 with my coworker Kyle on our break. Usually, I wouldn't go in to O'Shea's because it's a hole... but Kyle's 6'5 and could probably kill people with his eyes, so I felt safe going in here. Service was fast and between the 10 lbs of food he bought, and the cone I bought (I felt like a jerk using my debt card for $.96 cents) it's the best bang for your buck on the Strip. 

Be forewarned, there's literally no cell service here so you're SOL if you lose your group or they're drunk in the casino looking for you in the food court.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,0,0,3,9E3Q-Wlh8Y8JbuV5hlhLHw
