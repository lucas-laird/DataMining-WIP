Our sweet little server was honest enough to tell us that she had no idea what the ""Senorita Maria"" cocktail was, or what was in it.  In fact, she guessed that even the bartender didn't know because no one had ever ordered it. I shall be the first. then and explore the unexplored.

Patron silver on the rocks, lime juice, garnished with a wedge of lime and a salted
rim. I call it the ""Senorita Kate"", and it is sure to get the job done. And compared the the regular margarita that the Beau ordered, mine was WAY better.  

Enjoy!",HVk1KYHooZCDp9Xtm2h6iw,2,1,4,LhG7-Rj63eR2az0LnySFcA

We received a visit from the cabana host approximately once every hour, despite paying $350 of the cabana reservation.  75% of our orders were made by walking to the bar and ordering.  The server would show up 30 minutes later with our drink order.  Sometimes, we even had to remind them that we ordered drinks and food.  

We also were previously informed that if we spent $350 on F&B, the cabana fee would be $100.00.  When the server eventually made it over, she then informed us that the F&B minimum was $400 and the cabana fee would be waived.  When we cashed out, the cabana ""host"" told us that the minimum was 450.00.  When I told the host that we had been given three different versions of the policy, she sighed and rang us up.  The entire day, we were treated more like an inconvenience.  Despite the horrible service, the servers took it upon themselves to auto-grat our check, which nobody had previously informed us of.  Usually, I don't care because other resorts provide good service, but this seemed like a case of ""we're getting the auto-grat anyways, so who cares?""  

I chose JW Mariott to avoid the strip, but I will not rent a cabana here again.  The servers rarely showed up, the drinks took a long time and we basically served ourselves.  Considering the price we paid for the cabana, we expected better.",cQZJB1XBiJtoEqz4WmX8IQ,0,0,1,6q3XuKc6xdn51whXBDXRrQ

Waited 1.5 hours for my daughter's chicken strips. CHICKEN STRIPS. Everyone else was done eating already. Also lost drink order. Was done with food before we got that. Ended up getting some of ordered comped but they could've saved themselves the trouble by being better organized",pXDi_VoY3dUuofSJJuu8lw,0,0,1,-kZd1deTIgpFQcR70yVHww

Food was good, the service good, and even struck up a conversation with a fellow patron.",8KGCt7cIMsa51DclwOgmIg,1,1,4,LRW_aK2hTgSC8RlKQfCbCw
