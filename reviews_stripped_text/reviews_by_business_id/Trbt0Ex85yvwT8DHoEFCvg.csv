15564,2014-01-07,0,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"Food was not bad - generally boring/average, but cheap and what we expected, so you get what you pay for.  The apple pie dessert was quite good, as was the service from the waiter (especially considering he was left to handle quite a large section by himself).  We sat on the patio, which was nice because you got to experience the ""thunderstorm.""

What stood out the most was the check.  

When we received our check, we noticed the restaurant automatically added gratuity. What makes this even more sketchy is that we were only a party of three and when we got the final check (after the card has been swiped), there was an empty line for gratuity and no mention that you had already paid an 18% tip.  For those people not paying attention, you would end up tipping again on top of an even larger amount.  

I actually spoke to the hostess about this because it seemed so blatantly dishonest, and she confirmed this is how they set up their system.  This is an easy way for them to rip off customers, so be aware.",E2R4WD4n7V1bGXAtLe8AHQ,1,0,2,zZllBw3TJdTBLL3Esxe5Bg
17122,2010-02-01,0,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"Horrible, food was bad, we sat at the bar, the people next to us left about 3 minutes after we sat down. The bartender never cleaned the glasses, or dirty dishes the hour we were sitting there - there were several other spots around the bar in the same sad shape. Saw several people come in and then leave since there was not a clean place to sit.

She was busy drinking shots with some friends - it was only 1pm in the afternoon on a Saturday, guess she was thinking it was the end of her shift. I am all for having fun, but not at the expense of customers. 

Food - don't even bother. much better places for the same amount of $$ to put out and get some quality food.

Place looked great when observing from the outside, but the service, food and overall experience was totally a waste of our time and money.

Their only saving grace is the location or they would be out of business. please eat somewhere else.

Tried to find a manager to talk to - but no one around, must be why the bartender was drinking and the food servers had to get their own drinks for the customers.

Foodservice is my business - I wouldn't waste my time calling on a place that does not take care of its customers...they will be out of business before long.",aOHAjmACFEMfEVLSyFC2ZQ,0,0,1,qVkVw7tPqmLXeBlDupmz9A

I was here a couple of days ago and was not impressed with the food. Lunch completely changed my mind. We ordered 4 dishes and the bill came up to $25.

The beef burrito was plump with pulled beef, rice and beans. I also had a Caesar's salad, generous slices of chicken and well dressed lettuce.

I ordered the pasta primavera and it was so bland. It had no flavor whatsoever. Btw, I am a huge foodie and flavor is everything to me. Really, the best part of the meal was the little garlic bread roll that came with it. My husband ordered the Ribeye and it tasted alright.

The hostess was dis-interested and didnt tell us who our server was going to be.  Our server did not introduce herself and instead of saying hello the first thing she asked was what we wanted to drink.  Not if we had questions or a simple hello and welcome.  I couldn't believe but our server had a shirt that said ""pink"" or ""juicy"" on the back of it, how un-professional was that?!! Did not feel like a restaurant at that point.  We did not get a managers visit throughout our entire stay and we could see him chatting with staff.  I asked my burger Med Rare and it came med well to well.  Not to mention it tasted like it was frozen.  I had asked for rice as a side and got fries.  The place looks like  your eating in a lobby as well very weird feel.  There is no music at all.  Our server dropped our check assuming we wanted it and never asked how it tasted until we had told her that it tasted like frozen meat.  My girlfriend had the marg. pizza and it was bland with no flavor.  Also, they cover up the tables with a piece of paper as if your supposed to draw on it like maccaroni grille.  If you are trying to save on linen costs don't put linen on your tables because then you make it seem like you want your guest to eat at a kids table with paper on it.

101801,2010-12-01,0,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"Like the previous reviews state, ""Where do I begin?""  

      My husband and I brought his parents to a fun weekend in Las Vegas. They are not culinarily adventurous so we looked for a place that would have standard american fare.  The miracle mile had many places to choose from to eat, but we saw this menu and felt it might please everyone's tastes. Little did we know it would only serve the tastes of those who LOVED awful food and ""rip off"" drink specials (suckers.)  
     We entered what looked like a fairly nice restaurant by a friendly hostess.  Our server promptly came up and offered us drinks and showed us menus. We asked about a two for $10 drink special offered on the menu.  He let us know the drinks listed on the menu were the only specials that evening. All were sweet and made with ""smirnoff"" flavors. I dont drink that brand so asked for my vodka up with olives. My husband tried one of their drinks and our parents stayed with water. We ordered a quesadilla to share. My father in law ordered a burger medium. My husband ordered a goat cheese salad and I ordered a ""Wild"" mushroom pizza with pepperoni.  Sounds good so far, right? 
      About 10 minutes later, our server came back with 2 waters and my martini that looked cloudy and REEKED of vermouth. My husband's ""special"" was a 3-4 ounce drink. It looked like a shot glass with a straw. My martini was supposed to be JUST my vodka up with olives. I tasted my drink and I really do believe (after 8 years of bar tending experience) that I was only served vermouth in a glass. The server came back about 10 minutes later and I told him the issue. He was confused at what I was asking, but took the drink back. I understand some servers arent as educated about this so it didnt bother me too much at the time.
     10 minutes later a food runner came our quesadilla. Still no martini. We all tried a bite and bit into a large tortilla sandwich FULL of white flour. I've had better at taco bell.  :(
      3 minutes later we received our entrees. My pizza was only button mushrooms, undercooked cheese, on a lavosh that was also undercooked.  Still no martini. My husbands salad was wilted to the point of mush with a big ball of fried goat cheese.  My father in laws burger was a hockey puck with cold fries. 
     3 minutes after that, my drink came. A martini glass that had 2 olives and some vodka and the vermouth that was originally in the first glass. We were all disgusted.
     In order to get on with our evening, we asked for the check after waiting for a manager that never appeared, even though they werent busy. On inspection of the bill, our server added gratuity even though only 3 of 4 ate. We signed, left, and will NEVER go back. I'd rather dumpster dive behind McDonalds. 
     We did try to call the next day and alert the ""manager"" of this issue. We waited on hold for 20 minutes before we were hung up on.  We tried to call back to get a busy signal for 3 hours or so.  
     Long story short, I dont know WHO or WHAT owns this restaurant, but I have a funny feeling it may have been a used car salesman that lost a job, and hired his fellow salespeople to run a ""restaurant.""
You'll get a good ""looking"" place, but get shafted in the end.  BAD SHOW  !",8QtjPtG0Kj1v0q8t5jH12A,2,0,1,VO2V3NrR4DjGRgyveTKyIg

This place gets a star for the nice seating and decor.  I purchased a groupon and did not know that the gratuity was automatically added ( maybe thats why the service was bad).  From the beginning our waitor was very high strung and kept talking over me when I was asking him questions.  I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was bland.  The waitor never came back to check on me so I had to flag someone else down.  I then ordered the cajon salmon salad which was overcooked.  Again, the server never came back to check on us.

The restaurant looks like you're going in for a nice dining experience.  Don't let that fool you.  It's horrible.  First we ordered an appetizer.  Then I ordered the club sandwich.  Everything came out at the same time.  When the waiter put down my club sandwich I said ""oh that's not mine food, I ordered the club sandwich"". it was mine alright.  Their club is on a plain old hamburger bun with a plain full chicken breast, 2 slices of bacon then covered in a gob of greasy melted cheese.  It was a mess.  Not a fresh club sandwich.  It was disgusting.  I told the waiter that it wasn't a club sandwich and I didn't want it.  He told me too bad.  I ordered it and I had to take it.  Once food was ordered it couldn't be taken back.  Apparently that was the company policy. They don't waste food and his manager wouldn't allow it.  I asked to speak to the manager but he wasn't available and my waiter was the acting manager.  I left the sandwich untouched.  
Also, watch out for the 2 for 1 drink special. Another ripoff.  My sister order a glass of chardonnay.  2 for 1, right?  Less than a 6oz pour of cheap table wine and charged $10. Oh, you get the second glass free, but the first one should have been a $3.00 glass of wine in the first place so how is that buy one get one free when both together should have been $6.00.  This place has bad food, bad customer service and is a ripoff.  I guess they think because their cliental is mostly tourists they can get by with this.  So move on hungry folks.

It is setup up like a street side cafe with lots of tables boarding the fake street in the Miracle mile Very open and airy. Just a nice atmosphere.  Prices are very reasonable.
Ocean one also has some great drink specials so you can start your day or night there and then move on to the more expensive bars which you will have no trouble finding on the strip.

Unfortunately, I had dinner here with the wife and quickly realized we made a mistake. When in Vegas, you have an abundance of outstanding culinary choices and we settled on Ocean One after a long day of shopping and we were just passing by and thought let's just grab something here. Shoulda kept walkin.

Our server was kinda funny, though. He looked like a kid and was probably a foreign exchange student or something. Instead of waiting on us, he watched World Series of Poker on the TV. 

Their 2-for-1 drink special is like any other drink special scam on the strip. Small glass and almost no alcohol. I got my 2nd one to go and it came in a kids cup.

My wife ordered a pizza. The pizzas look impressive. Looks can be deceiving. Had the basil and artichoke....and cheese. Lotsa cheese. The pizza was like a heap of cheese, shreds of old basil, and canned artichoke hearts on one huge cracker separated by the thinnest layer of ricotta cheese. Bleh.

While writing this review, I forgot what I ordered. I think it was a chicken greek salad. The chicken was meager and the flavor was greek to me.

Service could be better.  In addition to being painfully slow (30+ minutes to get our food), my friend tried to substitute a side salad for his fries.  The waitress said this couldn't be done (odd enough), but that she could bring him a separate side salad.

I asked how much it was based on the menu prices for what we had. The reply was that this couldn't possibly be determined without the computer, and if I left before paying they would call the cops!

He came back maybe 10 minutes later to verify everybody's order very quickly as if he didn't really care but he actually had it down correctly.

Menu is pretty varied from Mexican to America to Italian and of course sea food. I did not care at all for their quesadilla, but pretty much anything else is good. For some reason, their online menu is very hard to navigate through and confusing, looks like it was designed and written by a 15 yr old, with many spelling mistakes and disorganized.

I ordered the grilled chicken club with no bacon and it was spot on! Soft bread, tasty moist chicken and fresh veggies. And they actually cooked my ""soft"" fries soft and not burnt...just like I asked them to do!

The chicken pops as an appetizer we're delicious! Even the restrooms have improved. Friendly staff and the food actually LOOKS as good as it tastes! How can I articulate what I mean?

 All the lettuce for sandwiches are cut a certain uniform way. The chicken breast was a perfectly shaped patty with perfectly placed fake looking grill marks on it looking like ""Magazine Food"" if that makes any sense? lol! When you go there just look at your food closely and you'll see what I'm talking about. If McDonald's mass produced a lamb chop....it would look like these lamb chops. A perfectly shapped little fake looking chop, he he! This place is supposed to be health conscious and hormone free meat but it honestly doesn't look that way...not even close. When I looked at my tasty chicken breast before I ate it I didn't see anything that looked ""Natural"" to me, lol! But I don't care about that! I eat ""fake"" fast food creations all the time ""Taco Bell"" , he he!

I don't know WHAT in the world they are doing to make this food look and taste so flawless! I don't know if it's indeed fake food prepared by an assembly line of robot cooks in the back or if most things are ""pre"" cooked and prepaired directly from packages (which is probably the case)  BUT whatever they are doing keep it going!!!

The ambiance, look, and layout of the restaurant are as if it is fine dining. But they bring you a plastic sticky menu with very ASSORTED choices.   Pork chops, pasta, mahi mahi, teriyaki?  There arent many choices but all none of them lead you to believe that the restaurant is American, Italian, Greek, whatever. They are all over the board. But it worked for me. I had the goat cheese salad which was plentiful and delicious and reasonable. We also had the spinach artichoke dip which was good and plentiful.

My husband had a hamburger which claimed was delicious. We also had the 2 for 10 drink specials and they were tasty.

This is some of THE worst food I've ever tasted in my life. The hamburger was clearly a frozen patty even though the waitress mentioned it was NOT ever frozen to me. I asked before ordering. It was gray which shows also that it's probably old/not fresh. Sadly, even the side salad was disgusting. None of this comes even close to the grossness of the fish sandwich. Holy moley...just opening the sandwich to look at the fish was an absolutely disgusting sight. For crying out loud the place is called OCEAN ONE, and they can't serve halfway decent fish??

When ordering, Waitress would not let my husband and daughter share a hamburgar/Fry combo  Said the price was already reduced so no sharing, no offer of letting regular price be charged so they could share.  So they ordered nothing.  I order the same combo. and only thing I asked was no onions and she told me If she put too many things down the cooks would mess it up so I could pick the onions off.  I could not believe she said that lol I only asked for No onions.  Wow,  alot of confidence in the cooks. ( We really should of walked out at that point but we had already ordered and received our drinks) Anyway I said ok.  However I could taste onion even tho I picked it off, ruined the burgar according to my taste buds.   Outside advertisement it offers a choice for side item and I was never offered anything.  I just asked about fries and she said yes.  Took about an  hour to get our food. They was confused as to what food went where.   My daughter ordered skirt steak and shrimp and even tho it was pink it was tough, as if it was well done.  Quanity nor Quality Was not worth $19 for that menu item.  Salmon Sandwich that my daughters boyfriend ordered and My son childs menu chicken strip was both good.    Now back to the waitress.  Several times when my husband and I was talking she'd come over and interrupt, stood around like she was trying to over hear.  It was weird.   The frozen alcoholic drinks comes out in what looks like a childs glass rather than whats shown in the advertisement.   $76 for one hamburgar combo, shirt steak and shrimp dinner, salman sandwich, childs chicken tenders, two sodas (one was a child size but was charge the adult price) and two $3 frozen alcohol drink and one glass of beer.  Over all, the food, time it took, and most of all the service was NOT worthy of what we paid.   I personally don't recommend this place and we will never eat here again.  The waitress wasn't worth a fast food job let alone a job at a restaurant of this class.  I still can't believe she said for me to pick off the onions.  I said Huh the first time cause I truely thought I misunderstood her.  She repeated the same thing.  LoL  I actually did laugh out loud and SMH.  Beyond bad customer service.  and that's the main reason for lack of stars.  She was about an early 40's lady with black hair in a pony tail.  I shoulda got her name but that was my mistake.  I was still smh about the onion/cooks thing.

We asked the waitress for lemons which she never brought us and when reminded, she didn't acknowledge and gave a snotty look. She did end up bringing us lemons however had to be asked to refill our drinks that were clearly empty. Keep in mind we asked her politely on all occasions. 

This was a horrible dining experience and when we received our tab saw that gratuity was already included in our total! Could this be why the waitress seemed to not give a care? Earning money wether or not she performed?

My wife asked at the front to speak to the manager and guess who it was? Yup, you guessed it. Our waitress. Her name was ANTONELLA. Antonella made no attempt to accommodate our group and continued to be snotty. Causing a huge scene in her restaurant and setting a negative example for those working under her.

French toast was a little small but my boyfriend really enjoyed it and said it was very good. 

Eggs Florentine was also good, potatoes were nice and crispy. Eggs were a little over cooked, the yolk wasn't too runny. The flavors were good and they didn't try to over complicate the dish. 

Servers were friendly and the bussers were very attentive. 

Got seated quickly but the wait for the food was a bit long. Between the two I was glad to trade waiting outside with being seated. 

Service is a little slow, but I will attribute that to the fact that servers looked spread thin and (like above) everyone was seated quickly.

I ordered the grilled salmon dish, which I found to be a lot more appealing than my friend's skirt steak plate (but to each their own taste buds, right?). The grilled salmon came with a small handful of mixed veggies and a scoop of mashed potato, which was complemented with the lemon herb sauce.

One morning we were walking by with a little over an hour to spare and thought that we would dine here for breakfast.  There were only a few tables with patrons seated, so we figured we would be able to catch a quick coffee and meal for three under an hour.

Big mistake.  Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.

Our simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.  I wouldn't say that I'd be interested in coming back anytime soon.

The menu is very basic and straight-forward. There are plenty of choices to choose from: pancakes, French toast, waffles, scrambled eggs, omelettes, biscuits and gravy, fruit, etc. And the option to opt for egg whites? Hell yeah! 

I ordered the Garden Omelette w/ a side of sausage ($2.50) and a side of biscuit and gravy ($2.50). I completely ruined my nutrition during my mini vacation w/ my kids but I am back at it today. My trainer did see some of the pictures I posted on IG and bitched about it but hey.. I was on vacation! 

Service was great. Our server was fast, thorough, and super nice. Made me feel welcomed from the get go. The food came out pretty fast, too. 

The omelette was a bit under-seasoned but the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The potatoes looked simple but it tasted great. Gavin enjoyed the sausage and the biscuit and gravy tasted OK- the biscuit was a bit too dry to my liking but the gravy was thick and delicious.

2067481,2014-07-23,0,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"First off, I'm going to get straight to the point and state this restaurant's service is absolutely horrible. 

This was the second time I visited the Ocean One restaurant while being in Vegas, and I recommended the food to others. My first experience was okay, just like any other restaurant, however on my second visit i know I will never be back. 

When seated, my group of friends asked for waters, with lemons. Our waitress acknowledged she would bring us lemons, and she didn't. While we waited we finished our waters, and when she finally came by our table, one of us asked her for the lemons. The waitress simply made a ""mm"" sound as acknowledgement. She brought the lemons a bit later, and by then, our cups of waters were empty.

We then asked her if we could have refills on our drinks, and she again took awhile to refill them. Keep in mind we should not have to keep reminding her for refills when we clearly don't have any water or drinks. 

Soon after our orders arrived, and we began to eat. Again, no refills on our waters, and not once did she stop by and ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. Actually, she didn't even come near us, at all, for us to flag her down.

We talked amongst ourselves and agreed she didn't deserve a good tip, if any. We finished eating and sat at the table, with no bill. We were in no rush to leave, however if we were we clearly wouldn't have been able to since she wasn't checking on us to bring one anyway.

One of our members got up and asked her for our bill, and shortly later she brought it to us. We were upset due to the gratuity being added to each and every ticket in our group, which consisted of approximately 4$. We strongly felt as if she did not deserve that, so again, a member went to an employee and complained about the automatic gratuity, and asked to speak with the manager. The employee then walked over to our waitress, who was in fact the manager. 

We were amazed to discover this, due to the service being so horrendous and her not knowing any better on how to manage a restaurant 

The manager, who's name was Antonella, be came really snotty and told us there was nothing she could do, and that the gratuity was automatic. We realized there was nothing we could do, so we just told her the service was not worth what we were being forced to tip.    

Antonella then replied (without an apology) that it is not her fault and she had a full house.

We looked around and the place was half empty. Free tables everywhere. She then turned her back to us once we pointed this out. 

Over all, this was a horrible experience and I will be back.",wRQuSKrk-vHpxeEkUfa6BQ,3,0,1,kzc5T4UN8Fpk44v8k-Ktlg

What got us in was the 5 dollar lunch special and I must say, it is the best bang for your buck. I'm not expecting anything gourmet, and compared to what you can normally get at a fast food restaurant, this was definitely the best choice. I went twice in two days! 

The first time I went I got the flank steak: steak for lunch? Can't say much more. It came with a side of mash potato and vegetables with a steak sauce under the vegetables. It tasted great the first time, but the second time I could tell it wasn't as good. But for the price of steak and the portion, really can't beat that deal. 


The pasta was absolutely amazing and portion was huge. Make sure to get the one with the Alfredo sauce, it's not the pasta penne. Get the other one. Amazingly delicious. 

The second time I came I got 3 things: spaghetti, steak, and the lollipop wings. Spaghetti was what I was craving and it did the job, with an additional side of crushed red pepper flakes. Steak was another craving so I had to have it. And the lollipop wings was a great portion for appetizer and tasted good. 

I tried a little of the spinach artichoke dip, and I felt like it was fairly bland. Was not eating anymore after I tried a second bite of it. 

If u want filling dish that will hit the spot, go for the pasta (not with tomato sauce). If u want enjoyment, steak for sure!",pHkkTSELbwNrdwLiVV94UQ,0,0,4,U12biTW79z1f-w7YuFRXdQ

Well, but then you get what you pay for. Service is horrendous. I sat at the bar, fairly empty at 2pm, two bartenders super busy cleaning all the bottles. Food takes forever. Comes without silverware. I sit there in desolation hoping for some compassion until someone looks at me and laughs when I ask for utensils. 

They don't care. Everyone at the bar was looking at each other laughing because that's actually pretty messed up. I know it's cheap but come on, have some decency. Ironically the food (although Cary looking) wasn't so bad. Well, let's wait until tonight and see if I'll die or something.

But here's is the deal. I had a fish, a salad and a beer for $13. If you're willing to put up with the crap and ridiculousness of the service, go for it.

Anyways, service was great. Our server (who happened to serve my wife last time she was here a while's way back - small world...or planet...bahahaha) was quick, on point with all the food, and he accepted our lunch order even though we were 15 minutes before lunch hour officially started. The price: $5. Per. Dish. It's an epic conflagration of great food with good service at an unbelievable, fantastic, jaw-dropping price of epicness.

We ordered the calamari appetizer. Because it was five bucks. My expectations were low. Because it was five dollars. It came out and the crunchy breading with the deliciously soft calamari and acidity of the marina sauce was great - probably better than most places that I've eaten at in Vegas. Because it only cost me five moolah. I got the flank steak. Which only cost me cinco dinero (hope I got that right). Combined with the sauce, some asparagus, and mashed potatoes, it was a delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite that it came out medium rather than medium rare. But I'm not complaining because it cost five greenbacks. 

My wife got the chicken Caesar salad and somehow got full off salad which seems impossible to me. And the dough necessary for payment was five. So this whole delicious escape from the mile strip of people hawking at you to buy stuff that you don't want but feel like you need because it's thrust into your face cost me only $20. AWESOMENESS.

But the main reason my party came in is because of the 3 drinks for $10 deal!! But we soon found out that this deal is strictly for one person. You can't share your three drinks with anyone! They are totally trying to get you drunk and have you gamble haha! But there is another list of drinks that are $3  and kinda strong. They are really sweet especially the watermelon one. Of course it's not real watermelon! The piña colada and strawberry daiquiri were my favs.

I'd come here again but only for the drinks!

 We work in the area, and frequently took advantage of this restaurants online ordering system. It now takes over thirty minutes for a simple order like bacon and eggs and then even got that wrong. 

We really love supporting this place because it's a small business and the quality is still pretty good.

Unfortunately, and the last 6 months they've spent a lot of money on making everything in the restaurant nicer but now it takes up to 35 minutes to order and pick up from online.

Just yesterday we took 35 minutes to order bacon and eggs and nothing else. From the time we put the order in online to the time I was ready to pick up took 35 minutes!

The previous record for waiting for our meal here last week took us 24 minutes.

They've had some staff turn over, and they seem to be a lot busier than they used to be but it's a shame that we will no longer be coming here.

When we're at work we cannot afford to wait 35 minutes in the lobby to pick up scrambled eggs and a few slices of bacon.

To top it all off, they included potatoes when we ask not to have potatoes, and did not give us a fork and a knife for order.

But then again, they have a lot more TVs and spent a whole bunch of money to make it look nice inside..

I didn't get the chance to see the reviews on yelp (gasp!) but we were pretty happy with the experience. We got seated and asked for a drink order quickly and our waitress soon enough got our lunch order. We had the calamari to start, and i had the jerk-seasoned mahi sandwich. My boyfriend got the grilled salmon. The calamari came out sort of looking like a mess, in a pool or marinara and shredded parmesan but it was actually really good. I'd never had calamari like that but it was my favorite part of our meal. The mahi sandwich was great, nicely cooked and the jerk seasonings were excellent. A little spicy but not burn my tastebuds spicy. They came with seasoned fries that looked freshly hand-cut and those were great. My boyfriend's salmon was ok. It came with shredded veggies and mashed potatoes that were also sub-par. But for about $7 each entree, it wasn't bad at all.

Watch your bill CAREFULLY!  Forgot the dude's name but our shady punk server (name started with a ""K"") tried to slip one past us by charging $2 for hot water (called Flavor Shot on the receipt), and conveniently including gratuity for a party of three!!!  

What happened was, I handed him my credit card thinking the bill was a bit high, but decided to check the receipt after.  When he brings my credit card receipt, the itemized bill magically disappears.  I ask for the receipt and find the $2 charge for hot water and gratuity has been automatically included.  His explanation was that when you order more than 6 total items, the computer reads it as being a party of six.  REALLY??? STFU, right???

The first disappointment was that by the time they came to take our order it was 11:10 and they said sorry, no more breakfast.  That was a bummer. I ordered the burger and I was surprised to find that for $5 it was a good sized burger and tasted good!  The fries that came with it, though, were horrible; lukewarm and soft and dried out like they'd been sitting around for a long time or microwaved or something.   I passed on those.  The husband had an order of wings and an order of tacos.  He liked both.  The food was surprisingly good.

(i've used plenty of these certificates with alchohol) and we ALWAYS TIP 25%+ (on the original) when using these... just for the record :)  We like them because it saves a few dollars, even after leaving a really great tip... we've both worked in the industry, and wont leave less than 25%... just dont treat us like shit!    

We went in around 8ish... we wanted to get a few appetizers to try and some drinks..  We showed the bartender our certificate, and he says ""do you want a table?  you can't use that up here""   .... ummm okay sure... he obviously (and rudely) didn't want to wait on us because we had a ""coupon.""  

We were taken to a table, and given a menu... the server says ""you can't use those certificates for alchohol""  ... whaaaaat?  we looked at the menu and nothing was over the 9dollar range... meaning we'd both have to get entrees... an appetizer... maybe soup and/or salad and dessert??  lol... no way... i can't, nor want to, eat that much at 8pm... 

The service, so far, was so rude.  My husband just wanted to leave and go somewhere else.  I didn't really wanna order a feast of food either... so we got up and left... without grabbing our certificate off the table... I figured it would just be thrown away anyway, and didn't plan on coming back.  

So, i got an email this morning, from restaurant.com, asking how the experience at Ocean One was.  (this happens after the certificate is used, and validated.) ... so, apparently the server must have grabbed it , and used it the next time her table paid in cash (i guess if you had more than 2 ppl , you might get a check over $35)


Anyway, wouldn't that be theft?  I still PAID for that certificate, and could have traded it for a different one... or maybe come back when i had more ppl with us... (most likely, though, i would have just thrown it away, but its the point that the server would use a certificate that someone left behind on accident)

So, that thief server got an extra $25 for doing nothing (exept be rude to very awesome customers who tip really well!)",ZMS5bGXARL0XLF09Kz9kSg,1,1,1,bl12ckxGsEL6sTkOKNlF1w

I didn't plan to eat here but the Todai Korean Buffet was gone so I gave this place a try since I passed it by for years and years and it was nearby.

I figured for only $4.99 pricing the food might not be so great......or maybe very tiny portions.....?

I was WRONG. The food we tried was very ok and the portions were big!

We shared the Mahogany Glazed Wings. We received 8 wings that were tender, flavorful and juicy in a house made glaze that tasted sort of teriyaki-like to me. They were ok....

For lunch I ordered some sort of Salmon Salad. They ran out of Salmon and asked me if I wanted Chicken so I got that. The Salad was made with fresh greens, toasted pistachios and supreme oranges. My chicken was nicely grilled and the house made Mango dressing was delicious. All in all it was a pretty good salad that was cheap.

My husband had a pasta dish with chicken, artichokes and a tiny amount of spinach. It wasn't the best but it was ok......

The steak was prepared as ordered, medium rare but was tough. Drinks came in small glasses and there was not much alcohol  in it. The two daiquiri came to $20. Calamari was $9. Steak and mignon added up to $42. Gratuity was automatically added which I do not agree with. What happens when service is bad?. Service was okay though. With taxes bill came to $90 for two.

The first time I had the crab cake appetizer, and that was hands-down the best, most fresh tasting crab cake I've had outside of Florida and Maryland. I also got the half pound sirloin burger with Swiss and mushrooms. The burger was cooked to perfection and was thick and juicy. It was late, so I decided to get a few drinks. The Moscow mule was great, and a perfectly balanced between the vodka and ginger beer. Neither overpowered the other. The Long Island was good, but did not stand out too much. I liked the paradise punch-but if you do not like super sweet drinks-steer clear! This one is a very sweet drink. The watermelon jolly rancher was also tasty, without being too sweet. It was sweet, but the sour balanced the sweetness well. The bartender was friendly and helpful and made great drinks, and I was definitely in a ""good place"" by the time I finished here.
I came the following day for lunch, and it was a great deal! I started with the spinach-artichoke dip and it was amazing- creamy, yet still had a bunch of spinach and nice chunks of artichoke. A lot of places will have the dip kind of burned on the sides of the dish it's in, but this dip was perfect and had no burns. The next thing I had was the salmon and it was a great serving size with spiraled veggies and mashed potatoes. It was grilled perfectly! I finished wth a molten lava cake and it was exactly what my sweet tooth had been craving for the last few days. It came out warm and there was a ton of sauce inside. Each of these were only $5, so I was able to leave a $20 and felt full and satisfied and got to have a tasty 3-course meal.

My family and I were walking through the Miracle Mile Shops, seemingly for hours, on our first day in Vegas, and we were starving. We were in dire need of breakfast, and we were impressed by this restaurant's advertised breakfast prices (breakfasts start at $5.99 here! This is in MAJOR contrast to the prices elsewhere). 

Since we were there at an off-time (mid-morning), the restaurant was about half empty. We were promptly seated and given menus. They offered a lot of breakfast fare, with a lot of omelet options and other popular dishes. We all ordered a variety of eggs/toast/hash brown potatoes and pancake dishes. All were really good, not greasy (the bacon was really good!), brought to our table promptly. No complaints at all.

Did I mention that the prices were really reasonable? 

One weird incident, though: a gal came by our table, large camera around her neck, saying she takes photos of diners at the restaurant as a courtesy and the photos are free and she'd like to take our picture. Our family of four gussies up as best we can (considering we just flew in to town super early that morning and had been walking around for hours, waiting for our hotel room to be readied), and this gal takes our photo. She says she'll return with our complimentary photo shortly, and then she goes to another table to take a picture of the couple there. At any rate, we had ordered our meals and received them and then eaten them, gotten our bill and then paid, and then left. The camera girl never returned. Either she forgot, something shady was going on, or our family's photo was SO hideous that she was embarrassed to present it to us.

I guess it was decent food, but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Parmesan and it was literally getting a fork full of salt. We had to to-go it and I brought it back to the hotel and recooked it, diluting the dish with water and letting it simmer. It was pretty good after that, but I didn't pay to have to recook my own food. I had the California Wrap which was pretty decent, but nothing special either. My friend had the Talapia and a chunk of his fish was missing from his plate while my other friend ordered a pepperoni pizza that was just tomato sauce and a few pepperonis on a super thin crust. We were pretty unimpressed to be short..

The only silver lining this place has is that their drinks special is quite legit. This is actually where I'm giving it a few stars in this review. Two drinks for $10 in their special -- I tried the Key Lime Pie which tasted off, but then followed the drink up with their Almond Joy which was basically a disguised White Russian.

I opted for the Half Pound Sirloin Burger with Bacon , Swiss Cheese and  Fries  for $9,99 .

Not a bad price for Vegas .

Ocean One has a nice Décor .

When My Burger arrived they had forgotten to put the Swiss Cheese and  Bacon on it .

I visited this location while staying in Vegas this week for work meetings. Since we stayed at Planet Hollywood this was in the mall connected and easy for Lunch.

They were not very busy and the service was less than average. There was little follow up with us on the meal progress and little follow up after the meal arrived. Once the meal arrived we had limited service. Plus I have never been to a restaurant that refused to give customers a paper receipt. They only have emailed receipts???? They clearly do not want business from those traveling for business and need receipts for expenses. We can't assume everyone has email or likes email. Plus not all companies will allow an email receipt for expenses.

We had a group of five ordering. One of my group ordered the seared tuna ahi for his meal. He had only eaten some fruit for breakfast prior to lunch and felt fine. In just a couple hours he became violently ill with food poisoning. He was throwing up and major stomach pain's. He even had to have the hotel come clean his bathroom as the violent and rapid throw up prevented him from making it to the bathroom. I have experience with food safety and I have no doubt it was the tuna from the restaurant not handled properly. However, it's  waste of time to tell them because they will simply say you can't prove it was them, you can't prove it wasn't something else he ate even the day before, you can't prove blah blah blah and they will deny all responsibility.

Was looking for a nice casual and not-so-expensive bite for lunch within the Miracle Mile and found this place. It's a big attractive place with seating outside the restaurant where you can relax and watch the people roaming around the mall. 

They have these lunch specials for $5.99 (a couple of sandwich selections for $5.99) and also dinner specials for $8.99. I had a satisfying grilled chicken club sandwich for lunch that came with a nice mound of fries for $5.99. Service was friendly altho not the fastest - it was one woman with a Ukranian accent covering quite a few tables by herself but she was hustling. 

Bottom line: Nice option for a casual lunch or dinner and people watching in the mall - won't wow you but should satisfy you. And lunch and dinner deals leave more $$ in your pocket for the blackjack table.",6mMk9hO_RAbdGMEGeg3oWQ,2,0,3,nL5_sTRNprjrzgPwdC_SrA

Ohhh yeah music to my ears...err wait beauty to my eyes!  We sat at the bar which had several people already there, all of who I will say did have food and it looked and smelled amazing.  The waitress promptly greeted us and offered us up menus to see what we could get for happy hour, which was pretty much everything!  From margaritas to martinis to pina coladas!  Also, she let us know that you can mix and match your 2 for 1.  I had to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming as this is usually not the case - especially in Vegas!  A couple of us opted for doubles instead of getting something different and man were they strong.  The regular drinks were also very good and you could tell there was actually alcohol in them - again not always the case with Vegas specials.  The waitress then starting to chit chat with us a bit and upon hearing we were celebrating a birthday offered said bday boy a free shot.  Again I was blown away by this as this is our third trip celebrating a family member's journey into the land of legal drinking and the FIRST time any bartender offered up a free anything.

Upon coming in, the staff was friendly and the place was pretty nice. Nicer than usual restaurants in the mall.

We ordered the calamari to start off and it was delicious. The squid was properly seasoned and very crispy. The portion was huge and only $5. That's cheaper than so many places and that's saying a lot since I live near Galveston. 

For the main meal, I ordered the ahi tuna wrap thinking it would be good at all. It was great. The fish wasn't extremely fresh, but it was not too bad. After all, it was only $5. My mom ordered the salmon and she loved it as well.

I place my order online and is always ready in a timely manner. I go pick it up I just say my email name and they hand me my food. Every time I go the restaurant is full so I'm guessing service is good and they also have lunch specials I think it's $5 there still a great price.

3970968,2014-04-26,0,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"I was going to a show last night and Ocean One Bar and Grille popped up on Groupon and I got one.  I have walked around the Miracle Mile Shops looking at the menus of various places, but until now, I hadn't eaten in this area.  The Groupon gave me the excuse to go.

I had a reservation for 5 PM, unneeded as it turned out.  I looked at the menu while my server, Tracy, brought my iced tea.  For a starter, I ordered the sesame tuna.  It was  5 pieces of tuna, previously seared and arranged on a bed of seaweed salad with wasabi cream and pickled ginger topping the salad.  The tuna was dry.  It was just stored too long before being used.  The plating was certainly nice but the dryness was very noticeable.

For the main, I ordered the filet, cooked blue.  The server returned from another table and checked with me to make sure that's what I wanted before putting the order in to the kitchen.  See the photo to see that it was cooked the way I wanted it.  A plus vote for that.  Along with the filet were some mashed potatoes and some yellow and green squash stings with carrot strings.  The vegetables were very good--crisp and not overdone.

For dessert, I got the Peanut butter cheesecake.  It was good and had a nice peanut butter flavor.  

Overall, the meal was OK.  I'm glad I tried it once but I probably wouldn't come back.  I was disappointed with the tuna appetizer.  Without the Groupon, the dinner would be very similar in pricing to some of the steakhouses at Strip hotels.  There are better choices with nicer atmospheres.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,4,3,MrCCEGUXuhremmlo0FLHNQ

4005182,2011-03-26,3,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"Been here multiple times before. The most important memory: first time I ever had creme brûlée.

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.

The restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.

Environment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.

Waiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.

Food: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.


Drinks: only water. Sorry.

The menu was bland, nothing special. But that's ok, my sights were not set so high! However... as I've mentioned in reviews before. I'm diabetic, and to have sugar free items is not mandatory, but it's nice! Especially when it's something as easy as sugar free syrup, which is even carried by your local Denny's!!!
So this is the way we started! Not on a good foot! Let's hope breakfast is great! NOPE! The biscuit gravy tasted canned, the biscuit itself was Pillsbury... my dining companions were not impressed either, they just felt it was eh! 
The only one plus! In a town of Pepsi products, my wife was excited to get a Diet Coke!

The show had not started, so I had enough time to go hang at the bar.

It's advertised throughout the Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood, how can you NOT go check out this AWESOME drink special.  Oh yea, and there's food too, but I just went for the drinks this time around.  Kind of busy, but room at the bar.  When sitting at the bar select appetizers are $7.50 and martinis/cocktails/wine $10(3 for 1 special), drafts $3, daiquiris/soda $3 (soda free refills)  

Yea, so let's jump on this 3 for 1 deal, this is the kind of thing that you tell yourself : 'it's too good to be true, I have to check it out'. $10 - 3 drinks, skeptic at first; I've experienced deals like this where the cost is LOW and so are the QUALITY of the drinks and service, it's a toss up.  This is not the case here, I asked THE question: ""Do all 3 drinks have the be the same?""  Cody politely said no, not at all.  I just did an internal scream, where on the strip can you find a deal this good and they serving nice, skrong drinks, oh yea, they re pouring very nice over at Ocean One, so don't be stingy on the tip.

I had the Watermelon Jolly Rancher and the Black Pearl, the jolly rancher tastes just like, so I had 2.  It was really good, When I go back I 'll be sure to have some Watermelon Jolly Rancher candy on deck.  And #3, the finale was the Black Pearl, a blackberry liqueur tea, 2 bottle mix TOPPED with champagne.  A nice topper indeed, bill $10, AWESOME.  

Great atmosphere, an outdoor patio set-up, very open restaurant. The place was already full when I walked in, by the time I was paying my bill there was a line to get in.  You can honestly have a nice evening w/ self and/or w/ friends, drop $20 and your evening is smooth sailing.

Awesome customer service, I probably was at the bar no longer than 2mins before I was acknowledged by Cody.  He said he'd be w/ me in a moment, but as he was finishing up w/ his customer Casey swooped right in to greet me and ask if I was being help.  AWESOME customer service, good team work, just really nice to see that companies and their employees still treat customers like CUSTOMERS!

But the chicken chop rules here.  It was fresh, crispy not greasy on the outside and tender and moist inside.  The mash and veggies sit in a nice reduction. The chef here knows what they are doing to serve high volumes, quickly and with great quality.

We saw a lot of people enjoying their 3 for $10 drink deal and noticed that they deliver one at a time so you'll always have a fresh one if that's your thing.

Get to our table which was also strange because they had a piece of butcher paper over a white linen table cloth.   Saving on linen cleaning? 

There are some beautiful looking light fixtures throughout the restaurant but....none of them were on.  Saving on electricity?

Basically....looked like it WAS a beautiful classy steak and seafood restaurant that was taken over by someone that has no clue.

Server greeted us with 2 waters and a blank stare...then asked what she could get for us. I ordered a Pinot Grigio. My husband asked what was on tap and got another blank stare and ""um...we have Pinot Grigio....and....Stella and Blelue Moon"". He orders his beer, and we both look at eachother in awe. What on earth was that?!? Lol. Weird.

We then notice our water glasses were filthy so my husband asked for another. Then we get our beverages and my wine glass had some disgusting stuff on it. Geez. Really?!?

I know it sounds like we're drama diners but we really aren't. Just letting you know what to expect.

I ordered the Miso Salmon..$18.99 and husband ordered the Chicken Breast $15.99. All in all...pretty good. No major complaints.

Got our check and noticed they automatically put gratuity on there. So make sure you check it!! We usually tip more than what was included on there but because our server never bothered to let us know, we did not leave extra. Their loss.

We were seated on the outside patio. Lovely view of the scenery! I thought it was very annoying how customers would walk out in between our table and the table behind me (literally 3 ft away) Do people not know where the exit sign or the front door is? 

The breakfast menu is small and there are absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS for anything on the menu. What a fail. My husband and I don't eat pork and he likes steak in his omelettes but that's not an option. Very disappointing how they don't cater to their customers. I ordered the french toast (with no meat) and got charged for an extra egg as a side since they don't substitute anything. I ordered a mimosa and they have a 3 drinks for $10 deal. (Good deal if you like to drink) They will still charge you $10 even if you don't get 3 drinks...what a ripoff.
 

We waited 30 minutes for our food and so did everyone else around us. When the food finally came, the portions were so small. Our waitress was so slow. We left hungry and we definitely won't be back.

4611623,2017-01-04,15,Trbt0Ex85yvwT8DHoEFCvg,"$4.99 isn't bad for lunch in Vegas, is it?

I mean, if you're not buffet bingeing, a $4.99 burger, let's say, made quickly and easily and served within the Miracle Mile Mall can't be that bad.  Can it?  Because if you'd just lower your expectations a bit and understand that for a measly $4.99 you should in no way get your hopes up, you'd be golden, stopping in for a bite during Ocean One's $4.99 lunch special.

And that must have been the problem: we expected a little too much from Ocean One.

Although the pictures we took speak for themselves--depicting a rather sad looking burger and a very dry chicken--the service wouldn't prove to be any better.  Ours, Rufat, saw our table only three times: once to take our order, a second time (when after I'd called him over) to return with my corrected order, and a third time to drop off the bill.  Truthfully, we'd wished we had just purchased a less than mediocre lunch elsewhere.  After all, Vegas has more than enough to offer.

Besides, a $2.99 soda, when added to the bill, alters that ""deal"" you had imagined receiving.  Your meal now: $8.00.  That's quite slippery of you, Ocean One.  Nice work!  We won't be seeing you again.",EGz1NDtgVbndCJ5R3F-stw,15,14,2,Lx2JYbbXO0FuBhR47KUJew

I had been on the Las Vegas Strip for hours and walking from Ebar in Fashion Show Mall toward the south Strip my reliable hunger was kicking in. I was strolling the corridors of the Miracle Mile when this sign caught my eyes. $6.99 for a half pound cheeseburger with toppings in a full service restaurant sounds to good to be true, however, I am cognizant of the fact that Miracle Mile with Planet Hollywood have some decent deals in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. So, I thought, ""what is the worst that could happen if I gave Ocean One a try?"" 

    Upon entering the restaurant, I questioned the $6.99 burger. The friendly hostess let me know that it is available for dinner and that it didn't start for an hour (5 PM). 

    Fast forward to 5 PM, I reentered the exact scenery and talked to the same hostess. It was obvious that the burger deal wasn't a gimmicks at the exact time that they weren't going to give prime seating to that customer who came here for the $6.99 burger at a table in the restaurant. My choices were at the bar or in the patio overlooking the walking path of Miracle Mile. I chose the patio. The hostess seated me at a table visible to the restaurant so that they would know I'm there. A few minutes further, a waitress knew I was there. This waitress wasn't nasty, enthusiastic, or friendly. 

   I had done enough walking. Now it was time to dig in and do some eating. The burger I was eating was nothing like a Smokestack burger down the Strip in Shake Shack, or nothing like a mouthwatering burger at Fukuburger down the Strip in Hawaiian Marketplace, or as thick and juicy as a burger in Outback down by Showcase Mall. With a bottomless Coke this came out to $10.72 before a tip that made Ocean One a far better deal than OVERPAYING for a $17 dry Philly cheesesteak meal at Nathan's or $16.50 for a cheeseburger at the Treasure Island Cafe. The cheeseburger and seasoned fries were good. It did the job by filling me up at a good price where the only gimmick is that I was looking in at the attractive brightly lit dining room from the patio. 

     In conclusion I was satisfied just like my wallet was with the $6.99 cheeseburger meal. There are so many dining options on the Las Vegas Strip and so many nights for me to hang out here that Ocean One looks like a one time experience in the near future.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,11,3,12TJBIwJuMz4QKt8XjNCQw

We stopped in because I remember seeing an ad for a cheap cheeseburger. We didn't really want a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender lady was high or something. She didn't pay attention to us and she was frowning the whole time with her hood on her head.

We mentioned the cheeseburger ad and she said that it's 6.99 and that we could add bacon for no additional charge, so we did. I asked her what else came on the burger and she acted like it was a trick question or something. She told us that it came with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, and onion all on the side. Then she walked away.

The bartender brought the burgers out, after about 12 minutes. She dropped them and left. The burgers had bacon, lettuce and onions on it. Nothing was on the side.

We had to get up three times are ask for condiments because the bartender was no where to be found. By the time we got the condiments, the fries were lukewarm, which pissed me off. Well actually the fries was a surprise to me. I didn't know the burger came with fries. Either way, they were cold by the time I got to eat them.

The burger was dry, even with the mayo. The bacon was undercooked and the fries didn't have a lot of seasoning. Even though the fries were not hot, it still tasted better than the burger. The burger tasted like a boot.

I suggest the salmon salad, lemon pepper salmon, marinated skirt steak, steak quesadilla,chicken lollipops, spinach artichoke dip, chicken Caesar salad, peanut butter chocolate cheesecake and apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.

Beware. 

-----

If it was based on value alone, in a city like Vegas where everything is expensive, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5. 

We happened to randomly pick this place from
the Planet Hollywood casino directory based on the name, i.e. assuming it was surf and turf. When we go to the resto for a late-late lunch at 3:30 pm, we saw that it was $4.99 for any item on the menu! 

Considering that it is in The Strip and a nice place to sit - on their indoor patio - vs inside where there is loud music, bright  lights and lots of TVs. But again coming during an off- peak time might be part of the reason we got such good service from Abby & the food came out quickly. 

This trip we have eaten the whole gamut from high end restaurants all the way to basic but delicious McD's breakfast sandwiches. At Ocean One Bar and Grille there is a large enough variety of items including appetizers like calamari, to salads sucks as warm goat cheese salad with pine nuts and to chef's specialties like marinated flank steak. 

We had (numbers in bracket are rating on taste for each dish) :
- warm goat cheese salad (5/5)
- chicken taco salad (3/5)
- chicken wings (5/5)
- orecchiette chicken pasta with creamy Parmesan sauce (3.5/5)   ****Revised to 0/5 as I believe it made me sick - the chicken**** My friend had a few bites only and felt queasy -- I wish had listened. Instead I ended up vomiting on the plane ride home! 

Plus a beer each (Coors light and a Blue Moon) at $3/each. 

Oh and I got a chicken club to go for later! Ha! Always planning my next meal and airport food is so over-proved. Our total came to $33.48 including taxes (but not the tip). The portion sizes are the same as a regular restaurant, i.e. these were not sharing plates. 

We even lingered as it wasn't busy as it was too late for lunch but too early for dinner for most. 

The bathroom was clean and modern.

One of those was the Stratosphere's ""Top of The World"". After a bad experience there, we started shopping around for an exceptional restaurant to celebrate our special day each year. We tried several but found nothing that really impressed us enough to make us return. This year the Jockey Club Management had a recommendation, in their weekly events flyer, for the ""Ocean One"". Although the prices didn't indicate this restaurant to be very upscale, we decided to try it. We arrived early for our reservation and were promptly seated. From then on we were astonished by:

1. The Waiter's (Angel) positive and gracious attitude.
2. Clean and pleasant atmosphere.
3. Menu choices/prices.
4. Ease in which substitutions were allowed.
5. Food (Filet Mignon) cooked exactly as ordered.
6. Manager's concern for our comfort and his gracious attitude.

After dinner we paid the bill and then decided to stay for drinks. The drinks were promptly served and we were told we should take our time. Angel returned several times to check on our drink status. We generally provide a better than average tip for good service and this night was no exception. When we paid the bill for drinks, he questioned our tip amount two times. This doesn't happen often in the restaurants we generally eat at. If a server thinks there may have been a mistake in the tip amount being too much, they generally take the money and run.

Don't let the prices fool you. This is, in our opinion, a 1st class restaurant with an excellent Chef, Manager and service.

Thanks to Ocean One and the Jockey Club Management (Lori?) for a great evening. we will be back.

The Island Salmon Salad was my favorite.  The mango vinaigrette and marinated onion not only blended with the greens, but worked well with their salmon filet that was cooked just right.  The pistachios added crunch and flavor to this dish too.  

The half pound sirloin burger didn't look like it was half a pound, and taste wasn't all that either.  

The wild mushroom pepperoni pizza was good in size, but lacked mushrooms and pepperoni.  A crispier crust would've helped too.

I was in Las Vegas with a group of friends for the weekend and when we woke up after a long Friday night we were STARVING. We were staying right behind the mile of shops and decided to walk in there and find somewhere to grab breakfast/lunch. We had the choice of a few places, but we liked what was on the special board for Ocean One and decided to give it a try. Boy did we regret that decisions almost right away!
     The place was not crowded at all. There were customers of course, but many open seats. We were seated right away, but then waited..and waited...and waited. Finally our waitress came over and took our drink order. We again...waited. Once our waters (and other drinks) arrived we were not given a refill for the rest of our meal. I ordered the grilled chicken and mashed potatoes which were actually quite good. Four of the people in our party ordered different wraps and every single one of them said they were the worst wraps they have had. None of them took more than a few bites and we had to stop to get them hot dogs when we left. 
     The food wasn't horribly priced for Las Vegas, but we did wait a ridiculously long time for our waitress to collect our checks and bring back our cards.

The tuna was fresh and the wasabi sauce gave it a nice kick.  It was reminiscent of the Lark Burger Ahi Tuna Burger (which sells for $10, making this wrap a real steal).

Upon receiving my meal, I noticed that the pasta looked watery. There was cheese sprinkled on top, so deep down I hoped that would be the meal's saving grace. After two bites, I was immediately turned off, and glad that I had the calamari appetizer to make up for this basic entree.

My mother saw that I barely touched my food and asked the waitress to see if we could switch my meal for a burger. The waitress seemed a little peeved, but nonetheless helped us to make the switch.

However, in all honesty, the burger wasn't much of an improvement. My burger was medium cooked, since I like the moisture, but not really seasoned well. The cheese that I had to pay extra, I could barely taste.

I went for the orecchiette pasta with chicken and my mom ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables- julienned zucchini and carrots. The pasta was delicious!

A group of family and friends converged on Las Vegas to celebrate the new year and my 40th birthday.  One night my son and I decided to try out Ocean One Bar and Grille.  The prices were surprisingly inexpensive (which should have been my first clue - I mean, even the air is expensive in Vegas).  He was excited to order a virgin strawberry daiquiri, but was sorely disappointed when the waitress told him that all their daiquiri's were pre-mixed in machines.  Oh well - so much for that!

We ordered a quesadilla as an appetizer and both had burgers.  The quesadilla was certainly nothing special - even the salsa tasted like it was bottled.  Our burgers came out sans bacon and by the time they got around to bringing us a side of bacon, our burgers were cold.  My son ordered his 'medium', yet when he bit into it, there was no pink to be found.  It was 'well' as can be.  The fries weren't even good - they had a slight ""freezer"" taste to them.  

Our waitress whisked our plates off the table while we were still eating (just taking a break).  Before I could say anything, she quickly turned around and said, ""Oh wow, I didn't even ask if you were finished!"" and she put the plates back down.  

This place, while easy on the wallet, was totally uninspiring.  I won't be going back during my next trip to Vegas.",CcJAs3QyoPdnTTKKpsbA_A,1,0,2,D94tRcqUOp9zBi1Q8cq1tw

Lexi is the best bartender, she gave me birthday drink. 

One of my normal recommendations is to sit at the bar for better service, faster drinks, and fresher food. Ocean One is no different. Bombay Sapphire martini up and dirty was my first drink. Bombay Sapphire based Vesper was my second drink. Mint Moscow Mule was the third. They were all delicious and would have costed well over $36 at the Heart Bar inside Planet Hollywood. This is the best drink special I've ever had in Vegas!

As far as food, I had Ceasar salad, southwest chicken salad, calamari fritti, chicken wings, burger and fries, and grilled salmon. Everything was good and fresh. Except the burger was a bit plain, needed cheese and bacon. 

Miranda was great. She shines. But all the servers were courteous and helpful. Jason, an assistant manager, stopped by for a quick chat and check on patrons. He was friendly and helpful.",8NNaJaSD60s1rDHPo4laNQ,1,0,4,c-K3Iko2FMqD5skra19Dmw

So, lunch starts at 11:30am so make sure you get there at that time so you can get lunch. They are open for breakfast which look good too but that's for another review when I come back. :)  It's great when you come with friends because that means you get to try a bunch of stuff. Yay!  It's a win-win. :)

My entree: Orechiette Pasta - OMG! So good.  I'm not gonna lie.. originally, I wanted to order the penne pasta but our waiter convinced me to get this instead.  I know orechiette means (little) ears in Italian. Anyways, I didn't know what to expect...this had artichoke and chicken with a fresh lemon taste. So yummy!  My friends loved it too.  The portion was huge. 

I tried:
- crispy calamari: yum. can't go wrong.  I ate a lot of these suckers. No pun intended.  LOL
- spinach & artichoke dip: No complaints. I'd eat this again. Ooey gooey goodness. 
- lollipop chicken wings: these were ok. I probably wouldn't order these again.
- herb crusted chicken chop: wow! I'd order this the next time I come here.

Now the best thing about this place...3 for 1 drinks for $10. LOL What's Vegas without a little indulgence?! It's 5 o' clock somewhere! :)  I can't wait to come back. Woohoo!",lpvpL2z51kxOWWEJtILueQ,4,0,5,35wA8t6vXg1jCAYZP5GFGA

On a busy Saturday afternoon in Vegas all restaurants had long lines and the only place that had immediate seating was here. I should have taken that as a warning sign. Plus, I didn't bother reading the Yelp reviews, my bad.

 We got seated in the ""patio"" area in the mall along with 5 or so other tables. Next to us was a bridal party with a bride in her tight boob popping dress and veil along with her bridesmaids who had the same type of dress minus the veil and in black. We waited awhile for the waiter to arrive and when he did we placed out entire order.

My boyfriend and I each got the grilled chicken $5.99 lunch special, the spinach artichoke dip and waters. The drinks and appetizer came out quickly. The chicken came out shortly after. The chicken was good as was the appetizer.

The one star review is not based on food but the service. We only saw our server at our table once, when we ordered. The reason being was he was at the bridal party table flirting with all the ladies and helping them figure out the best deal for them to drink as much as they could for cheap. I do understand that when you are celebrating a wedding or another special occasion you will get some special attention. However, not to the point where you are giving all the other tables on the patio a big FU.

How bad was the service? So bad we didn't even get a refill on water. In fact, I had some water bottles in my purse to drink while walking the Strip. Instead we used the water bottles to refill our water glasses.

The total was $26 so we paid and took off. I noticed when we left the patio area everyone else that was still sitting there looked just as pissed as we were.",AV4zFJb2weSfY82g7hfibA,2,1,1,fxOhqS8sS4nqRBbxPaNxxQ
