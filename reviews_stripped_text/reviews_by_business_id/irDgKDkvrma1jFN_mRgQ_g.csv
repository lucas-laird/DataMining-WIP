Why? Because this place is ridiculously good!  Like others have said, Darrell is fantastic.  Very friendly and quick with the suggestions :)  I had the shish kabobs with red rice (8.75), and it was worth every penny.  Darrell was nice enough to put the hot sauce and salad dressing on the side for me (I didn't even have to ask) since I got my order to go and that hot sauce!!  Tart, garlicky, spicy...amazing.  Everything was super fresh and delicious!  So hurry up, don't just meander along, and get yourselves over there.

Maybe you heard of True Island barbecue then maybe also you heard it's just about the only Guam restaurant around. And if you want Guam then you got to go. 
Having been raised there, I have fond memories of the island, and red rice is one of them. Other than having someone who knows the recipe (like a person from Guam) give it to you, it is that damn hard to get ahold of some. Ive tried making it, but forget it! It just tastes like regular rice that happens to be red(orange). It'd be easier to transfer a cake onto the judge's table.
They serve the type of food that makes you tell yourself to hold back. Prices won't break the bank, and no matter with what you choose, no worries; it's not a bad choice. 
People are right. The owner is very nice and very accommodating, every visit is a welcome one.
It's as though you don't want the word to get out on this place, almost like a secret. A secret you share only with your closet friends, except that one friend that nobody likes(Bryan).
But you want them to do well and expand, it'd be great if they had another location, but until then, get a taste of Guam.",uud6ysxja35ZT1ay7sr7Pg,1,0,4,b-BIvQnGpRo1ENRSk8W8Vg

Not only did the staff and owner really rise to the challenge of handling a very loud (and quite demanding) group of Guam-food-experts, but the food was Amazing.

THIS IS TRUE AUTHENTIC GUAM BBQ.  Spot-on, satisfying, tasty, and it really brought me home.  

If you think you've had ""Hawaiian BBQ"" or other island Q's, that's cool, but you just don't understand until you've had Guam BBQ.  And this is the closest you'll get without a 12 hour flight.

I am contemplating driving back from San Francisco to Vegas just to get my red rice and finadene fix.  Seriously if I lived closer, I would be there a few times a week...at least...since my kids (who are not as accustomed to the cuisine) couldn't get enough.

All of the favorites are present, as only a true Guam-family-owned establishment could bring.

- side of filipino style vinegar, chopped garlic, and soy sauce mix - for dipping the meaty morsels of char grilled goodness.

They said guamanian's not an ethnicity it's a nationality.  There are two races their, those who are actually of Chomorru descent and those who are Philipino.

I oddly couldn't figure out where the restaurant was located (go figure...it's been a tough and busy coupla weeks...)  

Anyway, headed over today for a bite of lunch.  Had made a note of Andrew's comments about Darrell behind the register and his brother at the grill.  
 
Darrell, as Andrew noted, is a gem.  I was sold before even ordering -- actually, when I told Darrell I was a first timer, he actually ordered for me.  

When I told him about his yelp reviews, he was stunned...didn't know he was already a legend.  So the chicken thighs I had -- although since he didn't know me...he didn't realize that I'd come for the red rice and didn't need to baby step it from white rice up to red rice...but that's what he did.  

Oh, btw, that slaw really is fab -- as is the dipping sauce with the chicken -- but ya know what caught my eye was that dish that's the cold chicken, hand pulled thing -- I don't know what it is -- but Darrell will -- I didn't get to taste it today but what a smart dish to have when it gets nuclear here.  

Darrell seemed to know all his customers today -- except me -- he hugged in with everybody and they all loved him, it was clear.

He told me that his brother was the exec sous at McCormick & Schmicks for the last 10 years or so -- and went to culinary school prior, so he's got his stripes.  

This place has lots of things going for it -- for their first location.  So folks, head over, tell em BK sent ya -- give Darrell a big ol hug, tell him you're a Chamorro virgin and let him order for you, too - you won't be disappointed -- just make sure you let him know you want that red rice...it's that good (but it needs a squeeze of lemon and that sauce -- wow...)",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,4,3,5,ZCvtqgK4svOY4P57YdLoOw

Holy man...But it looks like this place is now closed...oh well.,KuGQIxKfGiHLNRuWLuPpXA,0,0,3,Cd0zpLJ5hZIBd3S7NwD2zg
5230949,2009-09-26,1,irDgKDkvrma1jFN_mRgQ_g,Any issues from the past seem to have been resolved! We're officially regulars and I love the food. Mongolian chicken with red rice is my favorite. My fiance is obsessed with the BBQ beef. Both the chicken and beef seem to be of high quality and less chewy than meat dishes at other hawaiian or asian type places around town. Try it - you'll love it. Definitely stick with the red rice!,kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,3,3,5,WGhJHKnXsAEEP8faq-DI4A

I love the tangy/garlicky sauce that comes with the BBQ and the red rice.  Love the short ribs and the chicken.  Staff is very friendly and its worth the wait.  Darryl, the owner makes everyone feel like family, island style.",I3WELucFTrb_BQOjejAbtQ,1,1,5,uGgWr95qzK7uhcYcrZgfhA
5593840,2010-02-08,0,irDgKDkvrma1jFN_mRgQ_g,"Went here the other day on a suggestion from a friend who's in Vegas a lot on business... Am I sure glad that I listened to him. I was told it was a little bit of a drive from the strip but I assure you, True Island BBQ is worth it. Guamanian food. Loved it. Definitely felt at home at this place... Let me tell you why.

One of the things I first noticed and liked while deciding what to order, was seeing some classic t-shirts in picture boxes lining the wall. Classic to me cause I had 3 of the shirts that were up there. Anyone familiar with Undefeated, Upper Playground and Undercrown will know what I'm talking about. Those are just the shirts that I had... Other nice ones were up there too. Nice touch. I immediately liked the vibe of this place.

Second and the most important was the food... My friend said to try the red rice with our entrees and I did. DELISH... I had the bbq chicken plate with red rice and small salad. Immediately tried the red rice and I knew we made the right call to come here. The chicken was very tasty. Grilled just right. Accompanying salad had a very good sweet dressing on it.. I usually take pics of my food (especially my first time there) but was so hungry that I forgot. And I regret it... Two of my friends had the fiesta plate and another had the salmon. With red rice, of course. Also ordered appetizers... The lumpia was so good. Comes with sweet chili sauce for dipping. Slightly larger than your average. Delish... And my friend ordered the gyoza. And just as I finished telling her that all the fried gyoza i order in LA is never cooked through like the ones I grew up eating in SF, we get served up gyoza JUST the way I like it. At last!!! Smiles...

Third reason is Darrell. Very personable character... He schooled us in what to order and was on point with all of his suggestions. He suggested we pour some of the ginger soy dressing on the red rice to kick it up and he was right. He said to try it on the grilled meats and we did. Winner. Thank you.

Fourth reason. Sade was playing on the radio while I was waiting for my food. To me... that is ALWAYS a sign of legit establishment. HAHA. I will be coming back here the next time I'm back in Vegas. Guaranteed.

Try True Island BBQ... Your taste buds will thank you. Then you will thank me. Tell Darrell I sent you... And order the red rice. Enjoy.",5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA,0,0,5,dMZQtD9SfafL5prAEx_8Lg
5884933,2010-04-21,0,irDgKDkvrma1jFN_mRgQ_g,"I tried True Island BBQ today after reading some of the reviews on Yelp. My usual strategy is to toss out the ""this place sucks"" reviews and the ""OMG BEST FOOD EVAR"" reviews and read the others. I had to go.

I ordered the fiesta combo, but I mentioned to the gentleman behind the counter that I have a weakness for short ribs. He suggested that I could add the short ribs as an extra meat to the combo. Genius. It was SO good. It's hard to pick any one thing I liked the most. 

The chicken was moist, tender and had excellent grilled flavor. I'm pretty sure it was thigh meat. Excellent.

The beef kabob was tasty but not quite as tender as the chicken or the short ribs. I liked it, but I think the short ribs won me over.

The short ribs were (searches for adjective) delicious and slightly sticky, just the way I like them. So flavorful. I was only introduced to this style of grilled short ribs a year or so ago, and I'm a huge fan now. 

This was the first time I'd eaten red rice, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, especially with the coleslaw/salad. That dressing could make pebbles and twigs tasty, I think.

All in all, it was an excellent, nicely-priced, late lunch. Although they were out of most of the appetizers on the menu, I didn't mind so much. I haven't had many meals better than this recently. I'm only in town for a few days, but I have to go back.",UzRhH-FecQAcVfSVYhjWjg,0,0,4,mhR9bgwtTPOhAxUhAwCW0g

My coworkers and I are regulars and our favorites are the various barbecue plates with the red rice and salad. Also, True Island recently started to accept catering orders, so that was truly a great change because they were able to cater a few meetings for us. We always have a huge turnout at meetings when we let folks know we have True Island BBQ. When I have friends or family who come into town from San Diego or the Bay, I always take them here & during each & every one of their following visits, they request that I bring them to True Island. This should be on folks' lists of places they need to stop in when they visit Las Vegas.",Qiy_1lS1gG2g_bbRiK8cvA,0,0,5,U9jRkeq_2RiB9TMliNvmjg
