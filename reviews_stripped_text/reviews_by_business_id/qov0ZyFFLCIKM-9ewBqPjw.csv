348624,2016-10-24,0,qov0ZyFFLCIKM-9ewBqPjw,This place used to be pretty good a few years back...they had good karaoke bartenders were cool all the bar games (pool darts beer pong etc) were free the best part was that they had a punching back right in the middle of the men's bathroom!! I moved away for awhile & i just moved back recently...i drove by & figured oh what the hell..I'll go in and have a drink...i went in & it has changed quite a bit..the drinks went way up the bartender was being a total douche i found out that they're under new ownership they took away the free games & took out the punching bag in the men's room...i was quite disappointed & probably won't be going back there..sad because it was a cool bar back then...,wtnLOataYL7kT3xaz9yccA,0,0,1,Ug7X5RMq0yynS5aJzpOtNw

From day one the staff was polite, hilarious, aggressive, and knew how to pour a strong a** drink.  I have been in for every shift and there is something I like about about every bartender.  I would recommend this bar to anyone.  There is a kitchen.  The food is great..try the Gyros.....my fave.",llSNrNPP6ob79Ft2CZfawg,1,1,5,-Fx8Fu2SghaVErtk5DOuyQ

Excellent service and the food was surprisingly good.  I'll definitely be back as Rush Hour has a nice relaxed atmosphere.",3T6WX37fP2Sca3309prKRQ,0,0,5,bsrGBlDhizWYWEcS0N9cww
1749423,2011-08-03,0,qov0ZyFFLCIKM-9ewBqPjw,"Used to be a regular here but as I've moved away it's far less often that I visit. Originally this was a nice quiet (mostly locals) bar with a few pool tables, some great bartenders, and decent gambling. I drove by quite a few times before stopping in on a recommendation and fell in love with the place after my second visit.

Over the years the bar has changed to serve a younger crowd (including karaoke on Friday nights), but most of the bartenders are still great and I stop in when I'm on this side of town for good times. I recommend it to anyone looking for a locals bar on the weeknights, or the younger crowd on the weekends.",O7AjVhZWhZx82jHybQDjwQ,3,0,4,Bk_XhXGJaFAXKsySvPhR0Q

Friendly atmosphere, pool tables and darts! The best wall decoration is the Jim Otto portrait!!! Go Raiders!!! 

Fred the owner, if you catch him, is A OK...Kudos for keeping the neighborhood bar around!",bVwxvvdwH0ECm8ohpWbdfw,0,0,5,5isTc-HKmOjFRastVjCThw
