Its obvious KFC is Yum brand's red headed stepchild these days. . Seriously I've seen high school dissection projects with more appeal than those tortured nephilim inspired drumsticks, does the FDA actually approve this stuff for sale to people?

The colonel must be turning over faster than his bastardized legacy products, if you don't want an overprocessed pressed chicken patty between two lifeless bread buns you're in the wrong place, cause the chicken with bones in it isn't what KFC cares about these days.

Waited an additional 15 minutes for our food to come.

The voucher isn't worth it for me to come back here again. It's really too bad because we really KFC's chicken. 

One of our complaints is that we were trying to add the chicken wings for $5 if we ordered a family meal larger than 8 piece which we did. Well they said that they can't do that because you can only get that on a fill up meal. Well if you see the picture it clearly states any 8piece or larger meal. 

Well the cashier was not only rude, but she was sassy and condescending. So I tried to talk to a manager who would not take our concern. Apparently she was talking to her general manager. Still no resolution. She finally come up to the window after waiting for 7 mins only to tell me that she can give the wings for $8 not $5. The. She proceeds to tell me. There's cars behind you so it's either you want it or you need to move! 

Really for me it's not about the $$$$. I wasn't rude or yelling at them but basically stating the facts. I feel like they were playing me for a fool. I doubt that he general Manager was actually on the phone with her. I feel like it's a complete lie!  I'm in the service industry and they were they treated me was disrespectful and very much condescending. I spoke with 800 #.

When I arrived and said that I was there to return my order, the 3 girls looked at me and began laughing.  They then grouped up and began talking and laughing and poking at the one who filled my original order.  It was obvious that they knew exactly what they had done.  When I was handed my replacement order, I began to inspect it.  I did not receive all of the pieces that are supposed to be in the order, but I did receive most of them with a few extras.

5193051,2015-08-26,0,rihKlAiPgJa5XcpZ1h9-bw,"I guess I should have read the reviews before I took the family for a quick dinner meal here. 

Ordered an original chicken piece kids meal and a chicken strip kids meal for my two girls. Specifically asked if the meals had to come with the apple sauce pouch since we don't allow our children to eat from pouches after the whole larva incident. He stated no. You can get an additional side. Great. We ordered two additional sides. We then ordered myself and my husband a meal. 

Upon receipt of our order we received two chicken strip meals WITH apple sauce. Great. We didn't receive the original chicken piece meal and we got apple sauce instead of another side for which they then said you get a cookie, a HARD STALE COOKIE at that instead of the apple sauce. Fine. We took the cookie to throw away later. Aside from my girls food, mine and my husband's food wasn't too bad I guess. 

Only foul part was later I go back up to the counter, wait 3-4 minutes while the front counter cashier AND the drive thru cashier eat their meals on the line. Yes, the same line they serve our food out of. One of the guys stuffs his last bite into his mouth and walks to the counter and I ask him for ranch sauce. I guess there wasn't any under the front counter because he then walks toward the back counter to look and the original counter cashier says in Spanish, ""Dayum, is the B*tch gonna ask for anything else?!"" I guess Spanish speaking Belizean trumps him because I understood every word he said. Needless to say we won't be going back.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,3,0,2,NPB-oQQaZG0IupD_qhkMSA

I ordered an 8 pcs all dark and received 8 pcs mixed. Being in the drive thru line I did not check my order for correctness and freshness, and that's my bad. What really pisses me off was the quality of the chicken. I ordered extra crispy which it was maybe crispy at 10 o'clock this morning (my order was placed 5pm). There is a difference in being crispy and moist and being hard and dry because of time laying under the warming lights. The chicken was basically inedible  We removed all skin from the chicken and collected about a half bucket of hard dry skin. Underneath all of the hard dry skin was hard dry chicken. The wings were a total loss. No way could they be eaten. I was going to take this mess back to KFC.
