7473,2015-10-10,0,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,Free spring rolls on the house she said as she sat them on the table.  Very friendly staff an I feel welcome even as a single diner.  I ordered the cashew chicken mild you have the option of getting it spicy spicy if you chose.  Well they brought out catfish instead of chicken.  I tried it wasn't bad but I would not be the person to order fish.  Another waitress noticed it was wrong an went an re-ordered the chicken for me.  I would suggest maybe pointing to the menu when you order.  Cashew chicken arrived undercooked veggies maybe they rushed it after getting the wrong order the first time. She didn't bring any plates so I could eat on this time.  Clearly she is mad because of the wrong order.  Kind of an attitude when she brought the chicken out.  Asked for a Togo box I can go home an finish cooking it.  Very disappointed in my first time here.  At home now finishing the cooking myself.,i1zH7hGJs_accdfjEzrwUQ,0,0,1,Ju8avdoRFd1KP5W29YvMEQ
18501,2017-01-15,0,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,"Ever since they've opened, I've been a regular here. In the past year I haven't been able to come as often because I moved to the other side of the city, but still dine occasionally and take out since my parents' house is close by. I'm writing this review because my last visit was not as pleasant. My boyfriend and I were craving thai food and since we were going to this side of town, I suggested and was excited to eat here. The Pad See Ewe is my favorite dish and I ALWAYS order it. This time the vegetables tasted burnt, noodles were overcooked, and the dish overall was a little bland. It was the very first time I've ever complained about a dish here. Since I also work in the restaurant industry, I like to avoid making employees feel uncomfortable by complaining, but I just didn't want to pay for something I wasn't going to eat. I asked the server to take the dish back in the nicest way possible. Then the owner comes out a couple minutes later saying they tasted it in the back and there's nothing wrong with the dish. We explained we're regulars and it usually tastes amazing and it wasn't the same this time, but she went on to say there's nothing wrong with the dish (basically called us liars) and told us if we don't like it, not to order it next time.. The worst part was when I told her I was a regular, she said she recognizes me but still decided to treat us the way she did. This experience was so disappointing only because I used to love coming here and I actually admired the owner because she was always so nice and hardworking. I decided to give 3 stars because I figured it wouldn't be fair to give them just 1 since I've enjoyed so much of their food until now. Their food is delicious (most of the time). I just want to warn you not to complain about the food unless you're ready to be treated like a criminal. I really hope that they change the way they handle complaints.",gj8pGDU3blpkccR6_pyNJA,0,0,3,VGZ_zdBsZPU2C39Bfr8K3Q

203803,2013-05-15,0,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,"This used to be my best place.  Something has changed and not for the better.  Last time I ordered from here someone put a ton of tumeric in white rice with some obvious frozen peas and carrots and few pieces of meat, tried to pass that off like it was fried rice.  

But this time, I won't order until things change.  The Pad Thai is a cheap imitation with a few sprinkles of pepper flakes.  The shrimp is so over cooked it's gross.  The wontons were not cooked right and the mystery meat in the middle is still pink.  Used to be able to choose what went inside.  The only saving grace was the orange chicken sauce.  Very slightly sweet and a small tang.  Otherwise the chicken was dry and tasted like it was microwaved.  The BBQ shrimp were not BBQ'd at all.  The shrimp was very greasy but not under cooked. Guess why? Because in the ordering comments I asked them not to over cook the shrimp.  Go figure.

Not sure what happened to this place: new management, short cuts, unhappy cooks or staff members, or just being cheap with ingredients.  Whatever the problem is it is coming out in the food.  Very poor quality for what ""used"" to be a great place for Thai food.",eIuITpqIeMcLgMxo3KPZng,0,0,2,kZi85_8wNa1bSyCkb4wjww

I ordered the garlic beef and was utterly pleased with the flavor.  It was just so delicious and satisfying with a nice portion of food.  I had mine with the fried rice after enjoying the delicious soup of lemongrass, tomatoes and lean chicken.  

My wife ordered the chicken curry which was so coconut rich and authentic.  Her heat level of 5 would have been at my max level of enjoyable ""heat"".  We both said that if this was a 5 GOD help anyone who chose a 10 level.

When ordering for takeout, my meal is always ready when I arrive to pick it up and staff is always very friendly. The food is awesome and so flavorful and part of the reason why I stay a loyal customer.

However, the one time I decided to dine in, I sat waiting for nearly 40 minutes before ultimately walking out. They put priority on their takeout orders and it kind of shows. Plus, last time I ordered from there, they got my order wrong. I always order yellow curry, but they have me red instead.

Let me start by saying that I read several reviews before deciding to order delivery tonight and got my hopes up. The food was so bland and sweet that I couldn't even eat it. Garlic pepper chicken had no heat and tastes like cardboard. Pad Thai had sugary aftertaste that was unbearable. The free egg rolls were over-cooked and wraps were crumbling.

Like any normal visit we were sat promptly and a waitress took our order and gave us our drinks. They started us off with veggie rolls which were alright. They weren't particularly great but it was a free start so it's hard to complain. 

And so we waited for our order. And waited. And waited. And finally over 40 (!) minutes after we had ordered a simple chicken curry I decided this was too long of a wait. After asking the front counter about the long wait and the status of our order and only getting useless shrugs in response, we walked out.

Absolutely ridiculous how long we waited and terrible service to top it off. I guess the wife can choose to still get takeout from here if she wants but any business that values their customers so little does not strike me as a place that is worth your time or money.

He refused to pay any more of his bill than ten dollars, and he was very adamant about it as he left.  There was no reason for that.  They were very dignified in how they dealt with him.  
As for the place itself, I give it one star for service.  They were very prompt and attentive.  I give it one star for price and quantity, as the lunch was an entrée, soup and egg roll appetizer, all for $6.95.  I also give it one star for the taste.  The soup was very light and the kefir lime leaves made it very bright and refreshing.  The eggroll was not very palatable, but if I ate sauces I may have enjoyed it more.  My friend had the orange chicken, which he loved.  The breading was not too thick, nor was the sauce.  I'd say that and the soup were the best things we had there.  It also wasn't too sweet.  My pahd thai was good, but a little heavy on the sauce.  I wasn't able to finish it all, but it also came with a very light fried rice that was good.

1. Lady on phone was nice as fk 
2. Delivery Man was nice as fk and actually talked to me for a minute. I'm an introvert(kind person but almost anti social), that being said it still didn't annoy me. 
3. Price was good, food wasn't nasty looking smelly and didn't taste rubbery 
4. I ordered fried rice and garlic chicken.. Both were good and I got a free side of white rice and 4 free spring rolls. Yea.. 4 free spring rolls lady and gentlemen oh yea and they charge .50 for can of sodas 
5.  And they weren't stingy with the sauce

The yellow chicken curry surprised me the most.  It was styled just the way I like it, similar to the (old) Thai Grill: soupy, but flavorful.  I was quite delighted to find another Thai restaurant that makes curry this way instead of the usual Indian style.  The curry wasn't as flavorful as the (old) Thai Grill, but it was definitely good!

Beef or chicken curry with rice always hits the spot. Thai jerky isn't bad. I can't complain about the chicken pad Thai. Their seafood soup is awesome with rice after a day of snowboarding or when you're sick.

Friendly staff. Sometimes a language barrier when on the phone. I think they were training someone ""fresh off the boat"" na eye mean?

I love that they give you complimentary egg rolls with your meal in an age where nothing is free. The curries here are bomb. I have brought a couple of friends with me and this is generally the go to when we want curry. The chili mint fried rice with any meat is just a delicious flavor to experience.

We had an errand to do on base yesterday and I was feeling Thai (like always), so he brought me last night. (This place is just over half an hour from Aliante.) My all-time favorite soup in the whole world is Tom Kah Gai, and so I deliberated over the many tasty-sounding options but went ahead and ordered it. I was worried it was only going to be regular bowl (like in the menu photo) for the 9 dollars and almost ordered a salad, too, but the server lady told me my soup came with rice so I didn't. My husband ordered the garlic and pepper beef. 

my soup came out first in one of those big hot pots, which thrilled me... so much soup! the server had given us small bowls, and I'd loaded up twice before my husband's food came out. the flavors of lime, coconut milk, bay, lemongrass, cilantro, and ginger were on point, even if my husband said the lemon was very strong. I am used to a slightly sweeter soup, but the complexity of flavors and the gently building heat were very enjoyable. (I had asked for medium to mild spice.). even with both of us having several bowls, I had an entire soup container to take home as leftovers. 

my husband was brave and had ordered off the very tasty curry menu, which I think he regretted. his beef was moist, but the garlic and spice were both rather mild, and that was after he'd asked for very spicy. there were a LOT of red pepper flakes, but I think my soup actually had more kick. 

service was deliberate and timely.

We initially drove past this establishment trusting our hand dandy GPS to get us there the first time.  When we finally made the place out and fight our way through the winds we came into a nicely set up, friendly restaurant.  We seated ourselves.

We decided on the lunch special menu, which included a all you can eat soup and spring rolls.  Don't be fooled by the mere commonalty of spring rolls.  Their's were excellent.  So, crispy and full of cabbage and clear noodles.  There are two dipping sauces, the usual sweet/sour and then my favorite vinegar based w/hot peppers. 

We ordered:

Red curry spice level 7 -- Hmn, not spicy...where da spice?  
Yellow curry spice level 0 --  Kids said it was a little spicy.  Us grown ups thought otherwise. 
Mint chicken spice level 5 -- Had a Chinese food flavor to it.  Not bad but not what I was craving.  Spice level was good though.  I don't like it so hot that I can't taste my food just hot enough to make me breathe through my mouth.
Pad Thai -- I'm not a big fan of Pad Thai and this was just way too sweet for me.

I remember it being bad and vowing to never go back because there are so many good Thai places to eat at. Fast forward 8 years and my favorite place Lao Thai kitchen a crossed the street changed owners and went down hill.

Now rewind to a couple of weeks ago I decided to give them a chance and low and behold I'm a fan 8 years later. All the good Thai food is outside of east Las Vegas but this place is good! Keep in mind just with any type of cuisine there are many variations of dishes and this place resonated with me and my child hood.

I ordered take out chicken Yellow curry, pad se ewe, and tom kha gai. It was GOOD! The medium spice was perfect. Everything was really flavorful, full of protein, and cooked well. The veggies in the curry were kind of big but it made me feel like my mom made it.

We wound up dining here for dinner a few days later and ordered the same thing and it was just as good. The plateful of veggie egg rolls that they give on the house was a nice treat. Those take time to roll and I loved that nice touch of having them on the house although they weren't particularly good. Typical casual dining mom and pop Thai food prices which means affordable. The ladies working were super nice and I just fell in love with this place. I'm glad to have found a Thai place on the east side serving up big portions of good Thai food at a fair price.

I didn't get to check out the bathrooms, but this older restaurant did look dated. It was definitely clean and that's all that matters. I read some reviews about the cleanliness so maybe I just got lucky that night as it wasn't so busy.

4347115,2014-07-27,1,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,"Quality Thai/Chinese food and great customer service at reasonable prices.  Even a BETTER value for lunch! 

So, the other night, I was in the mood for something Asian to eat for dinner.  So, I consulted YELP* once again and ""Thai Cuisine"" was the first restaurant in my area to pull up.  ""That's exactly what I've been looking for,"" I thought to myself...a good Asian restaurant on the North East Side of Vegas.  I usually have to drive a distance to my other favorite spots...

Wanting to stay close, I made my way to ""Thai Cuisine.""  They greeted me at the door (EVERYONE DID, they're very nice that way...) and the first thing I noticed was their EXTENSIVE menu.  Apparently, they serve BOTH Thai AND Chinese food, so their selection is 120+ items.

I have to admit, when I read another person's YELP* review, I was curious about their notation that ""Thai Cuisine"" immediately serves your beverage choice and four COMPLIMENTARY egg rolls (nice) BEFORE they take your order.  Those same egg rolls are priced at $5.95 (for 5 pieces) on the menu, which makes this free appetizer a nice added value to anyone's meal--and a smart loss leader for ""Thai Cuisine"" to draw is customers back in again.  Who doesn't like egg rolls, and who doesn't like ""free anything""  lol

As for the food, I thought I might choose my old standard, which is pad thai.  But this time I chose the Coconut Chicken Soup (Tom Kha Gai), which is served with a large generous bowl of jasmine rice.  And I'm glad I did!  I've eaten this dish before overseas and when I ate it again this time, it tasted better.  The base of this soup is chicken stock, coconut milk and a little lime juice, which gives it a slight sourness.  Then, the chef added plump tomato pieces, whole straw mushrooms, whole lime leaves, chopped fresh lemongrass pieces, fresh chopped cilantro leaves, a little oyster sauce and little hot sauce to taste.  What a complex range of flavors!  When Ladled over some jasmine rice, the portion is enough for three to four people (or great for leftovers).

Overall, I'm a fan of ""Thai Cuisine"" and will DEFINITELY return.  In MY BOOK, when quality food meets great customer service and a reasonable price, that gets high marks.

                            **READ THE FOLLOWING INTERESTING NOTE:**  
Although the restaurant closes at 10:00pm, I noticed a group of four people walking in around 9:45pm.  As many Americans believe expect restaurants will still seat them up to the posted close of business (so as not to lose the revenue), what these people didn't realize is that, for MANY Asian restaurants, the POSTED closing time is when the staff walks out the door...lol.  So, the manager offered to prepare the group something ""to go,"" but they declined and apologized for showing up so late.  As a gracious and generous response, the manager told the group ""wait a minute, I don't want you to leave hungry...let me send you home with some complimentary egg rolls.""  WOW.  Nice touch.  The group was impressed and promised to return with their entire family soon.

As I finished eating my meal, at 10:00pm EXACTLY, the television set was switched off, the cook walked out the door, half of the overhead lights were cut off and my check was laid on the table.  Having traveled through Asia extensively, I've witnessed this tradition quite often.  People aren't usually permitted to ""chat"" over endless cups of coffee in Asia as they often are here in the U.S.A.  If our culture would only embrace this value.

But I finally got around trying Thai, and I must say that this is a pretty solid establishment.  There is a nice open feel when you enter the restaurant, my girlfriend says this is really authentic Thai food so I guess I will have to say based on that, I love Thai!  

I tried the chicken curry and some duck fried rice with yellow curry?  I'm still a Thai newb so pardon my ignorance.  Either way, it was definitely different and it was pretty adequately priced.

I want to give this place 5 stars, but I get gun shy when it comes to perfection.  I'll go to other Thai places down the road and might come back to this one to do an updated review.

I had no problem with the service, they gave us some free eggrolls as well.  Good stuff.  There was also a lady who fell over a table when she arrived in the store, looking back that probably was hysterical.

Sorry Yelpers, no real interesting stories here.  Just a solid establishment

Ordered Chicken Curry (yellow, medium) and a Thai Salad (pretty basic), and I got the complimentary egg rolls with the delivery order.

Curry was all right. Not the best I have had, but maybe they do it better in the store? I can't imagine it would be all that different though because it seems as though the moment I put in my order it magically appeared at my door. Yes, that fast I tell you! By the way, delivery charge was... FREE! Yes, I ordered off of Eat24 and this was the only place around me that was not charging a delivery fee.

My Thai Salad was good, lots of tomatoes and cucumbers. Very fresh and of course a nice compliment to the curry. I like to eat the salad and curry at the same time. It just seems to cleanse the palette so you don't have spicy, spicy coming at you the entire time.

The egg rolls were quite yummy. I like to dip them in the spicy chili sauce - I wish they'd given me more instead of bringing a cup of the sweeter sauce.

Also there wasn't quite enough of the broth that I am used to with other places. It was more thick like a sauce. These are minor complaints about the dish as overall it was quite good.

Orderd crab rangoon and some pad thai. The pad thai could have duck added, so I decided to try that instead of the shrimp I normally get in pad thai.

Both dishes came out at the same time, nothing wrong with that, but I went with the appetizer first. The crab rangoon was frozen throughout, no cream cheese, completely filled with imitation crab. The cherry on top being that it had a horrible taste. A combination of extremely old dirty cooking oil and a flavor of the imitation crab being old to the point of spoilage.

The pad thai, while edible, didn't have any real flavor. The duck, tasted more of pork, and was extremely dry, almost to the point of being chewy.

The food is hot garbage. I should have saved my money and went to thai places that have given me consistently awesome food for years: Weerai Thai and Lotus of Siam.

My husband and I have been craving good Thai food for a while, and we broke down on Saturday and ordered some from Thai Cuisine, after looking at their overall rating. 

We tried to order online, but were told that they didn't deliver to our area.  

I called, and the lady was super nice, stating that they would deliver to us.   
We ordered a Yellow curry, Panag curry, and the 10 piece egg roll appetizer.  

When the driver arrived, he wasn't carrying any change for us to give him less than a $10 tip.  That wasn't happening, so we were forced to give him a smaller tip than we had planned on, had he had change.  

So...the curries looked REALLY greasy when they arrived.  
After stirring them a bit, they were less so, but that was kind of disheartening.  

The curries were also very thin.  Almost watery.  
The yellow curry was really tasty though.  Flavorful, and there was plenty of food in the container.,

The panang, however, was a huge disappointment.  
We ordered the yellow curry at a level 3 spicy, and it was about a 3.  Spicy, but not overwhelming.  (For me...I can't do spicy.  My husband loves it.)
The panang we ordered at a level 4.  It was more like a 7.  Spicy for the sake of spicy.  No flavor.  there was more liquid in the container than beef and veggies.  SUPER disappointing.  Even my husband said it was too spicy.  

And they only sent 2 TINY containers of rice.  And I mean TINY.  When you have that much curry, with THAT much liquid/juice, I'm sorry, but you really need to send at least one big container and one small...not happy about the fact that we have to go buy rice in order to eat our leftovers.  

the egg rolls were ok.  They're the little spring rolls, not actual egg rolls, and they had a bit too much breading/wrapper...bu the veggies inside were crisp,which was nice.  

So, at this point, we aren't super impressed.

5724868,2017-08-07,0,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,Yum this is one of my favorite Thai places on the east side! It's pretty much the only one. The food is super authentic and they always give you veggie egg rolls with whatever you order! The Pad Thai is fantastic. I suggest the Shrimp or vegetable Pad Thai. They have vegetarian options which I really enjoy! I suggest this place to anyone on the east side who wants real authentic good Thai food from a nice friendly staff!,CwYLTJU9eKbQOTlzYO9FdA,1,0,5,avSlErJqqk7_dffIiwKvCg

5840028,2016-02-02,1,eRQwgSQD1KyCmJk_PAGOXQ,"Gross! When we walked in we could sit where ever, so we picked a booth. As we walk over you notice there are tables littered with dishes, cups, food. The floor looks as if it hasn't been swept all day....get to our booth....there are egg rolls and food on the floor below us. The wall, blinds, fake plants were dusty and looked like soda was spilled on the wall. At this time I'm ready to run but the boyfriend insisted the food was soooo good and worth the gross surroundings. Then the waiting game began....wait....wait....wait....oh hello waitress. Order drinks and place our order for food at the same time. She walks off and I'm watching her she obviously became distracted with other duties. We got our drinks when we got our food. It was ok nothing spectacular and I will not be back. Took the BF to a BETTER, CLEANER Thai Spot and now he knows this place is crap.",rwxIAhvgoYQZr6VNz1lvhA,0,1,1,Wuvwm9baghLJ1d08Nxwlug
