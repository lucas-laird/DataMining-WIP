I noticed when someone asked for gluten free they were VERY careful about clarifying that they do NOT operate a gluten free part of the kitchen and contamination could occur, so no celiacs need apply.  I liked that they took this seriously (even though I'm not gluten free myself) since there are serious health consequences for celiacs.  

I got the #2 + green peppers.  Just a basic thin crust pepperoni with red sauce and sausage.  Really good pizza oven that's set up correctly.  Nice charred crust, just how I like it.  Be careful when eating or else you won't be able to taste it long (600 degrees F oven).

756926,2014-11-26,0,2Mp53KxlGeZJkodTuqpVow,"This Project rightfully earned their A+ in my books! Kind of disappointed in myself for not trying this establishment in San Diego where I live and where Project Pie originated but hey, I'm glad I made my way here.

Project Pie's crust is thin but extremely soft; I love it. I have never been to pieology before but I am sure there are some structural parallels between the two in terms of having the option to build your own pizza from the crust up and what not. However, I'd put money on Project Pies' creations because I'm sure their ingredients are quality and their thin fluffy crust will win your heart over. 

Now of course I like to be creative/use my imagination and what not but when places offer signature combinations, I like to try them before I start moving furniture around. Between me and a buddy of mine, we ordered a #2 (Pepp, italian sausage, meatballs, red sauce garlic) and #5 (Ricotta, Mozzarella, the white pizza etc...) and boy were they appetizing. We both wanted to try another one actually but knew we had to preserve our appetite for the other famous food Las Vegas had to offer. I really enjoyed the #5 white pizza. I feel the cheeses really brought out the flavor in the crust and you can never go wrong with basil. The #2 was a solid pizza on it's own but got boring well maybe out shined in this case by the #7 lol. I would order the #2 again as long as I ordered another pie to go along with it. 

I believe you can split a single pie down the middle so don't be afraid to ask the pizza makers for 2 signature combinations on one pizza.",osj3pVdEb1P-8uPUlpFV1A,0,1,5,8UO6G0m03lTldIKzcQQ3aw

798377,2015-03-05,2,2Mp53KxlGeZJkodTuqpVow,"Celiac/Gluten Free Review: 
After reading about really great gluten-free pizza done with care, a friend and I tried Project Pie for dinner. It wasn't busy by the time we got there and so I could ask a lot of questions. One review I had read said that the staff takes care to use different utensils AND that they put the gluten-free crust in a separate metal pan before putting in their oven. 

I didn't find any of this to be true on my visit. The staff did robotically say ""we are a gluten-filled environment and can't guarantee cross-contamination,"" but they honestly seemed to have no idea about what food allergies were as they used the same oil brushes and did not cook my pizza in a dedicated pan.

Because we had just gotten off the plane and were starving, I didn't have any other dinner options at the time. I was mildly sick after eating, but no extreme reactions. The pizza I had was good (hence the two stars) and the prices fair, but the lack of staff training and nonchalance is a major downside and reflects my rating.

Project Pie is NOT safe for Celiacs as they seemed to have changed their policies on food handling from the reviews that I've read online. If you have extreme sensitivities and intolerances, it would be best to go elsewhere for pizza.",lJxSofSh6m_oQG-YzBW39w,1,1,2,ISVg-VBId4Ta1_ofYniT3Q

It's real, uncooked pizza dough (unlike in Downtown Summerlin). You then can choose any toppings you want, and they have plenty of variety. 

The flash cooking doesn't burn the bottom like other places. The dough still comes out soft and fluffy. The toppings also don't all slide off (like at 800 degrees). 

As far as eating fairly inexpensively, this is the place to go on the Strip. It's delicious pizza for only $12. The only place that can MAYBE beat it is Secret Pizza. 

I also like that this is easy to get to for locals. All you have to do is park at MGM, and it's right in that entrance.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,1,4,C-Ae1QrLwmdPjVdmqDaK7A

If you're a little overwhelmed with all of your options, they do have preset pizzas you can request and always customize.

Yes, mea culpa, but as typical Vegas, you're in a hurry and not always aware of the process to order when it's your first time.  The staff could have helped her understand how to order what she wanted.

I'm sure it's not uncommon when places get busy where food service staff just moves you along versus understanding what you really want.  Prices in Vegas are jacked as it is, so you may as well maximize your enjoyment.

After this, we ended up dining at other places where we were able to get the customizations we wanted.  Maybe others can learn from our experience as there does not appear to be any reason to order an SP when you can get way more on a BYO.",PPp9AMvW3w8StV9ZsYtLkw,0,0,1,pFA2Yw3s76jE5LoMJECj3w

Now to the pizza itself.  It tasted great! I ordered the the meat lovers one and added jalapenos.  It is all made on a very thin crust and comes out nice and crispy.  The crust was very tasty (I added a splash of garlic around the sides) and the toppings tasted fresh.  

I would definitely recommend this place to friends and families that are looking for a good and easy pizza place.",QcVB_54m6o8jbq5PJBFsHQ,2,0,4,9f-DzBu2Gjv4xdv7Gi1E7g

For some context: I dined at the Bacchanal buffet last night at Caesars palace. Sure, Bacchanal offers a variety of more complex dishes, but none of them were truly exemplary. This was a simple, but exemplary, pizza. Great dough with interesting toppings served piping hot out of the oven (as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp for who knows how long). Not to mention for a fraction of the price of dinner at Bacchanal. I'm done with buffets in Vegas (or elsewhere for that matter).

I highly recommend this place.",53_6eqNUvTyJLpxzBK-xCg,1,0,5,55tAgwcjwVhTrdPA0H79fA

The ingredients are delicious and don't judge the cooks or should I say ""Pie Artist"" cause they know what they're doing. What I mean is that I was tempted to ask them for extra cheese since it didn't look like much and the people in front of me did so but I didn't and it came out perfect! I got I think it was the number #12 it had meat and more meat, lightly oiled, the perfect amount of cheese and sauce and the flavor of the ingredients were so tasty it makes your taste buds dance. The dough was thin, crispy yet had just enough carbs to hold on to and every bit was amazing.

Foodwise, the pizza is amazing. The dough is thin as I prefer and had a char taste to it that pampered one's palette quite well. I went with one of the pre determined pies and ingredients alone felt fresh and very healthy which is always a plus when dealing with pizza.

Their crust is on the thin side and you get to see them cook your own pizza to order too. If my memory serves me right, they serve 12 inch pizzas which is good enough for 1 hungry person or 2 people looking for a quick meal to share. Tastewise, its one of the better pizzas i've tasted in vegas.  The only downside i would say about this place is that they could put much more toppings on their pizzas. I always remember eating here and have at least one of my slices 70% with just cheese. Other than that aspect, the pizzas taste great and their are a lot of options to choose from.",xlynctesxBjMACgpoYqEmg,0,0,4,9Up9W21qWaIYLl9sCC7UfA

For a healthier option, you can get a kale salad also with UNLIMITED TOPPINGS. It's delicious and very very filling.

In all of about 3 minutes prepare to have your mind blown. You can get a customized, fantabulous, mind blowing, perfect texture chewing, amazing tasting, anything you friggin' want on it pizza made. Everything is fresh! Including the dough! Put all of this together and I think I may have a.) fallen in love all over again, and b.) found my (cue echo voice) favorite pizza place ever!

I love Project Pie and can't wait to go back. They have all sorts of signature pizzas or you can venture on the wildside and build your own. No matter what you order the price is the same. I went with a customized extra cheese, pineapple, sausage, and meatball pizza for my first try. I love that it's made flat bread style (not an actual flat bread, but thin crust), so you're getting a crispy pizza with 100% fresh ingredients made to order. No frozen cheese or processed ingredients here.

Honestly, is $12 a little expensive for a personal pan pizza? Maybe a touch. But let's not forget we're on the Las Vegas Strip where a pizza with far less quality would probably cost twice as much. And this isn't some mini-sized pizza that isn't enough grub for a 3 year old. This is a good sized personal pizza that I struggled to get through. So there is some value here.

The staff worked fast and was very friendly. Definitely didn't feel like I was eating ""fast food"" even though the order came out quicker than a McDonald's double cheeseburger.

We had a lot of fun picking out out toppings. There was some ""oh no! Your mushrooms got on my side. I hate mushrooms!"" LOL! They can do half & half on the toppings, but some bits may cross over a little.
Then, the whole thing is fired in an oven.
The crust was thin and tasty, crunchy on the outside & chewy on the inside. We got a chicken BBQ with gorgonzola & added mushrooms. Wow! I was pleased with the blend of flavors - salty, sweet, and savory.

Note, this isn't your good ol' thick-crusted hearty pizza - it's more of a thin crusted, quick roasted pizza, but it's nothing short of amazing! 
I've tried Pizza Studio, PizzaRev, Pieology, you name the rest, and I've never understood the hype about build-your-own pizzas... Until I tried Project Pie. 

We got one white pizza (no sauce) with double mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, and basil and one regular pizza with red sauce, mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives, garlic, and pepperoni. 

Both were AMAZING. Toppings were fresh and plentiful, the cheese was stringy and not too salty, the pizza was brushed with a perfect amount of oil, and the crust, despite how thin it is, was still chewy and doughy enough to satiate my craving for good pizza! 

It's kind of expensive for a small pizza but it's much more satiating than your typical build-your-own pizza places, just because the toppings and dough are so much better! 

The place is kind of hard to find. Basically just follow signs to The Underground (basically, the basement). It's right next to a Fat Tuesday!",fHcIDKSv5QwuzWIVMqvrNw,3,2,5,0PjE6Rje2g6q8lGJ97_OEw

The strip is a dangerous place for looky lou's so I keep your head looking forward or you'll be one of those ppl, you know those ppl, vacationers, lol.

Anyway, passed this place on way to strip, looked cool and was in mood for pizza. It wasn't opened yet plus it wasn't lunch yet so we did our thing hit the coca cola store, souvenir shop, the Adidas store, it was fun... Now we are hungry.  

Stopped by rainforest theme place, not interesting, we passed on that. Wife said, I want to take you for bbq, I am always down for bbq, that's my favorite, but in Vegas ok I'm looking at her sideways, like what?

 Then, still walking toward parking lot, seems like we're in the dungeon. I remembered this place on walk out so my wife said she wanted to always take me here cause she knows I like being creative specifically with pizza.

 I Love pizza about as much as bbq anyway so we stopped  and read menu and decided it's not too busy and we can game plan for rest of day while we wait. 

So I ordered, bye the way, it's all personal pizza size so like 7-9 inch round dough. My rule for pizza is 5 toppings only not counting cheese it's a given. Also, tomato on an red sauce pizza, pet peeve, that shit drives me crazy! Anyway, I get mine with roasted Brussels, lil bacon, onion ,green peppers, roasted red peppers and I wanted a lil brine taste but not to much so like 6 black olives and moz and parm to finish it off.  You would think too much right maybe for you but it was the bomb! Hit the spot for pizza that day and haven't wanted any since then. To be truthful today is sat that was last Sat it was really good and sometimes it's hard finding good cheap pizza in Vegas.

Every time I stop at the MGM, I immediately make my way to Project Pie because I feel that this is the tastiest, freshest and cheapest place you can get some real food on the strip.

Food:  They make all their pizzas fresh and from scratch.  You can choose to order from their pre-set menu, but I prefer to ""build my own"" pizza.  For under $10 you can choose everything and anything they put on your pizza, which I love.  The hubby usually has them pile on all the meats and cheeses, and I prefer a lighter pizza with veggies and garlic butter.  The pizzas are made right in front of you and taste so delicious with their thin, crispy crust (I'm drooling just thinking about it.)  They also offer a good selection of meats, cheese and topping, as well as a few sauce alternatives.

Price:  Their pre-set pizza items run about $9 - $11 each, and their ""build your own"" pizzas are about $10.  Great deal for the quality of food you get.  Me and the hubby usually get a pizza each and share a soda, and for about $20 it's a steal.

Atmosphere:  This place is located in the underground shopping are of the MGM.  It's a bit out of the way, so not as much traffic as the casino area of the hotels.  I actually like this because there is always plenty of seating available and there is no smoke smell.

Staff / Service:  The staff here are great!  They are always friendly and great you with a smile.  They make your pizzas exactly how you want it, and they do not hesitate if you have special requests or ask for extra cheese.

This one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas, and I usually end up eating here at least twice during my trips.  Great prices, tasty food and good service.  A real hidden gem on the strip.  It's too bad this place doesn't get more exposure as I know it would make a killing, but then again I kind of like how it's a little hidden secret at the MGM.",_NGEqqeQF9-hnyvai7OmzA,2,1,5,XltmxVpMoPmxmALHRbhypg

3081049,2015-01-21,1,2Mp53KxlGeZJkodTuqpVow,"This pizza parlor is located in the basement of the MGM (the floor they call the Underground). To get there, if you walk into the lobby the escalators on the right will bring you to the right floor. They're located right next to Fat Tuesday.  If you've had Pizza Studio or Build in the Bay area, this has the same concept. You can either do the unlimited toppings or you can pick a specialty pizza if you're indecisive for $12. Love how it's an open kitchen and you can see them pop your pizza into the oven. Takes only about 10-15min for a pizza. When your food is ready, they'll call your name. To make sure no one else grabs the wrong tray, they write your name on the parchment paper of your order (which for some reason really amused me). Long tables, stool seating and low plush couches available for seating.

I love being able to customize my pizzas w/ no topping limits. Ingredients looked fresh and I loved the slight charcoal taste on the crust. Crust wasn't too thick or too thin. The pizza wasn't greasy either.

We were staying at the MGM over the weekend of Dec 6th thru 9th (which also happened to be the Rodeo Finals weekend) I had read about this place online while making my reservations for the weekend, but didn't really remember it once we got to Vegas, but we were hungry and it was FREEZING in Vegas this weekend (everyone saying it might snow!!! wtf?!)) so we went downstairs to the shopping/eating area and came across Project Pie and I remembered reading about it.

We decided we'd give it a try, and so glad we did, this was some YUMMY pizza!  There is a menu board or you can create your own.  We went with their BBQ pizza with a few minor changes (Feta instead of Bleu Cheese & no onions) we also ordered the Pizza salad, both were delicious!!!

The first time it was cut in four pieces and the second time it was cut in six. I think it was better when it was cut in four because it made the pizza less droopy. I do understand its a thin crust but I thought that it could be a little more crunchy without burning it. The second pizza was the saad pizza. The first time I got it, it was perfect. The saad was tossed in the vinagerette before it was placed on top of the pizza. That was perfect because every bite had flavor on it. The second time the dressing was on the side and you had to pour it. It made it a very messy pizza with the dressing dripping down my arm.

There is a menu, but you can also choose to build your own pizza.  I always choose to build my own.  

You can choose regular or gluten free.  They grab some dough, put it through a machine that smashes the dough into form, then oil is brushed on the dough, and you can choose whether you want marinara sauce or white sauce.  

Then you can choose your toppings.  Other than mozzarella, there are other choices of cheese as well.  I like to add some blue cheese on mine.  My typical pizza consists of pepperoni, mozzarella, blue cheese, mushrooms, (sometimes prosciutto), garlic, and basil.

    First off you stand in line, almost like Chipotle. Not a bad thing, its fast and efficient.  They have a big machine at the head of the assembly process..... It smashes the dough into a perfectly thin, round pizza pie crust. Kind of a bummer in my mind, it takes the mom and pop feel out of the pizza experience. They then take you through the assembly process again just like Chipotle. As you pay for the meal and order your drink, the pizza finished cooking. 
   Im not saying its bad pizza, but to be honest, its hard to F($&# up pizza. If the ingredients decent, and the dough is good quality... its honestly hard to mess up.

You get in line, pick whether or not you want sauce, move onto stacking as many toppings as you want if you choose the build-your-own pizza option. If not, then there are many options on their menu and you can even get a delicious pizza salad here! It is a personal sized pizza, but I have always split it with a coworker since we are not big eaters.

$12 for a personal pizza (if you're a person with a large-ish appetite) is a bit steep, but not surprising for Vegas.

And I don't even like pizza!!!

It took us quite a while to find project pie. Tip- go straight to the back of the MGM, and down one floor to the ""underground""- it will be on the right. Better yet, there's a side entrance to the MGM that puts you right next to the escalator going down to project pie. 

I got a gluten free pizza with just about everything on it. Seriously. There was hardly any topping they DIDNT put on it. I wanted it all! Prices are the same regardless of how many toppings you add, which I love. We paid $12.97 a pizza including tax. A steal, in my opinion!

The gluten free crust is DELICIOUS!! Crispy and chewy in just the right proportions, and delicious even cold. 

The crust was brushed with garlic butter, which made it extra flavorful. Each pizza is hand fired in front of you while you wait. The pizzas are super filling, too- I could hardly make it through half the pizza that night for dinner, even though I was starving when we had arrived after walking all the way down the strip from Caesar's palace to find the place, and ate another quarter for breakfast and the last quarter for lunch. It lasted me three meals!!!

The pizza was amazing. The service was good. I would go back here in a flash. 

Be sure to get a mozzarella-ricotta combo as far as cheese goes, and extra prosciutto on top!! The prosciutto gets nice and crispy in the oven, and is amazing!!!

I LOVE the fact they have gluten free options!!!!! Thank you project pie for not making me feel like such an outcast when I go out to eat! I can finally eat pizza along with the rest of the group !!!",JgOsI4hTFBiT-_ROgb1kqg,3,1,5,6W9q6jA5ne_u17pOFx82KQ
4108242,2016-03-15,4,2Mp53KxlGeZJkodTuqpVow,"My count of visits customized personal pizza places now stands at 4. As I've mentioned before, Pieology is still hilariously absent from this list.

I've passed by Project Pie several times before while walking from MGM Grand's parking garage to the casino proper, but it's always been at inopportune times. When they announced a buy one, get one free special for Pi Day (3/14), I decided that this was a great chance to try them.

This is now a chain like all the others, but the Las Vegas store is the original site of Project Pie. It was launched in 2012 by the guy behind Pieology and MOD Pizza. Like those chains, you can pick from pre-defined topping combinations, or you can build your own 11"" pizza for the same price ($12, an unfortunate Las Vegas Strip markup).

I built my own pizza, as always. I started with a red sauce (it was a little light on that, to be honest), added ricotta and feta to the standard mozzarella, loaded up on proteins (pepperoni, bacon, canadian bacon, grilled chicken, spicy sausage), and piled on the vegetables that seemed appealing (caramelized onions, red onion, artichokes, mushrooms, tomato slices, garlic, basil). Unfortunately, due to lack of written labels and underfilled topping receptacles, I missed out on some interesting ones that I saw later on the serving paper (roasted red pepper, garlic butter).

The crust stood out that most to me. It's delicious and it's not super-thin. It's not that crunchy, but I love that it's chewy while not being soggy at all. They did a great job pulling it out of the 600-degree oven at the right time. The meats are all fine, and most of the add-ons do a decent job (tomato slices might have diluted other flavors), but there weren't that many pops of flavor until I added chili pepper flakes. I think that topping is actually better here than at most pizzerias, but there seemed to be a disturbing lack of shakers even at a lull. Good luck finding it if they're busy.

Project Pie is about as good as the other chains in its genre, so I encourage fans of Chipotle-style pizza or visitors to MGM Grand to give it a try. Personally, I doubt I'll be back very often. The regular price, the inconvenient location (although I did happen to get lucky on parking on an early Monday evening), and the relative lack of real standout ingredients all stand in the way.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,5,4,fyMhXFzQC5tsNl6fcJNpig

It is just like a Subway line, you will see the staff make the dough ( the machine will flat the dough) then you can pick all the fresh ingredients to add to the pie.The cook will put the pie to the open fire oven, about 5 minutes later, the pie is ready to eat.

We  were looking for a afternoon snack and this was just perfect, fresh made pie, the portion is good for 2 people to share. we also add a Cesar sale for $5; as I was craving for some crisp veggie after huge meals in the trip.

Positives:
-Freshly baked, fast, friendly service.  (Loved andre, he was courteous and very funny)
-They make each pie just the way you want and doesn't take more then 5 minutes.

Negatives:
-All thin crust pizza
-Line can get long, but moves fairly quickly
-Pies aren't filling for 2, but definitely for one.


Menu:
All cheese pizza is $10
Build your own $12
Pizza and some fresh salads.

I've gone to a few places like this... the build your own personal pizza trend seems to be sweeping the nation. It's such a fun concept... and I like to customize anything... So on my last trip to Vegas, I made a stop here for a quick dinner. I was staying at Planet Hollywood and MGM is only a few blocks away, so I trek'd over there... and it was well worth it! 
Great pizza, good quality toppings and a great price point. You get to pick and customize your pie with whatever you like for $12. How cool is that? I'm a meat lover, so I loaded mine up with pretty much every meat option. A few minutes later, they had my pizza hot out of the fire and served up to me on a platter.  I was one happy camper.

Friendly staff and a commitment to customer satisfaction - more than the pizza itself - is what makes this place a gem. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is pretty good, but the service is top notch.

I said it was no big deal, and he informed me that they were replicating my pie - that's right, an entire second one - for FREE for me to take. How could I say no?! 

With the build-your-own-option, you can literally put whatever you like on your 'za. The roasted red peppers and artichoke hearts are definitely winners.

Ordered up a pretty non-traditional BBQ chicken pizza, and watched as they pulled out the dough, pressed it in a machine, topped it off generously, and then finally sent it to the gas-oven to get cooked.  The final 12-inch pie that came out was super thin with a slight limp on the crust near the center, and crisp on the very outer edge.  

Flavorful, fast, and quite fresh, I have to say this is some great pizza!  While some articles have the owner maketing this as ""neapolitan like"", I'd have to disagree and say that this is pretty far from a traditional neapolitan style pizza...

But that doesn't make it bad.... to the contrary, the pizza is delicious from crust to toppings.  If only I had more free time in Vegas, I would've come back for a few more meals.

Verdict:  If you're looking for a purist Neapolitan pie, this isn't it.  But if you want some delicious pizza that's fast, fresh, and flavorful, you've found your place.  It's a shame a gem like this is hidden in the lower levels of MGM.

The pizza here is thin crust and personal sized. I could share mine on a normal day but if I'm starving, I can eat the whole pizza. You can build your own or order off the pizza menu. The ordering style here is like Subway, the worker makes your pizza right in front of you. I love the number 2; pepperoni, Italian sausage, meatballs, mozzarella cheese, marinara sauce, topped with garlic. I add in mushrooms and olives to make the ultimate Italian pizza. 

They have a ridiculous amount of toppings available ranging from ham, chicken, to caramelized onion and artichoke. You can make a Pizza Pie! My only advice is to ask for your pizza well done if you pile on a lot of toppings. Gotta make sure that doughs fully cooked underneath that pile...

For healthier options you can get a pizza salad too. They bake the dough for you and you can load it with fresh greens, veggies, and meat of your choice. I don't personally want to eat a healthy pizza but I have a few friends who've ordered and enjoyed the pizza salad.

I got half cheese with green bell peppers and pineapple, which tasted really good. The other half was bbq chicken which was not mine, but was tasty to my friend. The pizza is made thin and has crispy edges, which is something I love when I eat pizza. The crunch is not too much but just right. I'm so glad we got to eat here.

Thank goodness another patron noticed the pizzas were switched as mine was being boxed up (because mine was boxed I didn't see what it looked like). We would've wound up with ""Mike's"" pizza but his still smelled damn good!

They do have a variety of toppings and you can pretty much add whatever you want if you pick the create your own pie option. For the price I would advise the create your own and not any of their specialty pies.

And, it creates 4 substantial slices.  It's a good-sized meal.  Also, they are thin, so baked very quickly, which was nice.  They have a pretty good system for moving people through the line.

I had the BBQ chicken pizza and a slice of the ""meat lovers"" pizza.  I put that in quotes because I can't remember the name of it, but it was the pizza with a bunch of different meats on it.  I highly recommend both.  The BBQ comes with a large amount of chicken and BBQ sauce.  The sauce is slightly sweet with a good tang.  I added jalapenos which were perfect.  The meat lovers was equally good.  I like Project's red sauce, it had more flavor than some pizza sauces.  Also, they do not skimp on the toppings.

4981594,2014-01-13,4,2Mp53KxlGeZJkodTuqpVow,"To be quite honest, I was a little skeptical wanting to like this place since it being located downstairs in the Underground inside the MGM Grand. If you've been there, it's just an area you would kind of ignore walking from the parking garage to the lobby of the casino but anyway, let's talk PIZZA.

It's not an actual restaurant or cafe. It's, well, FAST FOOD. But let me add, FRESH fast food. The concept is simple. Either you can order from their pre-fixed menu or be that creative master chef that you are and customize your own personal sized pizza with unlimited toppings for $12! Yes I repeat, UNLIMITED TOPPINGS FOR $12. And good toppings at that! (browse the pictures to see what I'm talking about)

I love thin crust pizzas and not all places can balance out the thin crust texture along with the heavy toppings well but Project Pie does it right every time. I'm a cold pizza lover as well so it's also a good idea to place it to the side for a while and enjoy it at room temperature so the crust can soak up all the butter and oils for some more added flavor. YUM.

I work inside the MGM Grand and they're known for some high rated restaurants such as Joel Robuchon, Craftsteak and the recently added Hakkasan so grabbing something to eat on your break can be a bit pricey. Came here super hungry and unexpectedly found myself hating my thought of assuming that this place would be horrible. That only teaches me to never judge a book by its cover (as cliche as it sounds) and give every place a shot before placing judgement on it. And while you're at it, say hi to Andre for me and tell him that Julie from Hakkasan sent ya!

You can either create a pizza with your desired topping, or go with one of their recommended combinations.  I followed the recommendation of Kyle F (Yelp reviewer), the #5 - Mozzarella, Ricotta, Gorgonzola, Parmesan, Cracked Black Pepper, Olive Oil, Garlic, and fresh chopped Basil (white Pizza), but with no additions, it was delicious!  

The style is a nice thin/crisp crust pizza with great flavor.  We got 2 personal pies to feed the family, and it was enough for lunch, for dinner we might have gone with 3.  They also have speciality sodas you can buy, or get a cup and use their soda machine.

The pizzas are all one size, thin crust, i was able to share with friend and still was full, but if i was really hungry i could have inhaled the entire pizza myself.   They have your standard toppings and also some more less common toppings like roasted bell peppers, Gorgonzola cheese, and dates.  I thought their toppings were high  quality.  The only complaint that I had was that both times the pizza could have come out a lot hotter.  I think because I piled on a ton of toppings  it didn't get heated thru all the way in there brick oven.  I'm sure I could have brought it to their attention and they would have heated up for me, but it really wasn't that bad , it still tasted super good.  The staff at project pie were all very cheerful and attentive. Its located on the lower level between self park and escalators up to the lobby. Odd location so they don't get that busy.

First, the location isn't the best.  It's in the downstairs walkway on the way to the parking garage, so it's a bit of a walk from the rooms and the opposite direction of the pool.  However, if you're on your way from the garage, this is a great place to grab a quick meal.

The pizza was good.  Really good. Great? No way, but for what this place is, it does the trick. The crust was just ok for me.  The dough is placed on a dough press and bam, it's time to pick toppings.  We got a cheese (kids, of course) and a #7  (white pizza with caramelized onions, proscuitto, mozzarella) and they were both very good.  Each pizza came with 8 slices, or maybe 6, but at any rate, 1 pizza was good for 2 kids, so yes, it's personal sized for adults.  

$12 a piece, it was a deal compared to anything else at the MGM Grand.  Even McDonald's and Nathan's in the food court had comparable prices, and those meals will make you sick.

Granted, some nights it was closed by the time I wanted it. Anyway.. I finally stopped in the other day and didn't know what to expect. I briefly read the menu and saw that I could create my own personal pie for $12. I know what you're thinking... $12 for a personal pie is a rip off. It was my first thought too before I remembered that I was standing in the MGM Grand on the strip at just after 12am. Then I found out that included in that $12 was as many toppings as I wanted... say what?!?! It's the Subway/Chipotle of pizza!

Now I'm really skeptical as that seems almost too good a deal. Staff was very friendly and I ordered one of my favorite combinations... meatball, pepperoni and ricotta. Ordered with a little extra sauce and a little less mozzarella. I took it to go and it was gone by the time I got home.

Really enjoyed this pie.. by no means is it best pizza I've had but it was tasty, you get it hot right out the oven, it cooks in about 3 minutes and you can put whatever you want on it.

$12 for a pizza any way you want it, usually around $8 at Pieology, Blaze and others, but it's Vegas, I'll take it.
Nutella dessert pizzas, tempting at $6...
Side salads at $5, large dinner ones at $12.
I asked if I could make my own, as their options all had chicken which I don't eat.
So I used pretty much all the veggie topppings from the pizzas and made a huge, amazing salad.

Everything was quick and it was the perfect place to stop and eat in between things. I'm glad we decided to stop by! We definitely enjoyed our meal.

My only reason for not 5 starts the food to price ratio $12 for a personal pizza seems a bit over priced for the amount of food received even tho it was great tasting. But of course you have to expect it on the strip. 

If you like meat I recommend #2 with carmelised onions and roasted bell peppers. The sweetness from the onions really balanced the tart and spiciness of the meats.

The place has about 7 pre-set combination pizzas but you can make your own and even add more toppings to the pre-set combos.  And what is great about it is they only charge one price.  You can have as many toppings as you want and its still the flat rate.  No per topping pricing like most places do.  

I had the # 7- Prosciutto, Caramelized Onions, Mozzarella, Parmesan (White Pizza) - with mushrooms and black olives added.  It was delicious.  Their crust is on the sweeter side and is really tasty.

This is a great place to eat if you are looking for a quick bite to eat before going to Brad Garrett's Comedy Club, also located in the same area.

It's a great concept.  Build your own pizza.  Or you can choose from their predesigned specialties.  Pizzas run around $12, which is a bit pricey, but this is Las Vegas, and they are made with very fresh ingredients in an 800 degree oven, so I believe it is well worth it.

I had the #7, which is mozarella, parmesan, garlic, fresh chopped basil and sliced tomatoes.  It was delicious!  I can't wait to try something else or to be more daring and build my own!

The staff is very friendly and fast, and if you are an employe of the MGM, you can get a pizza and a soda for $9 by showing your employee ID. They have pretty late hours -until 2am most nights, and they seem to keep pretty busy.

But you might totally miss it if you never head down the escalator going towards the self parking garage.  They offer personal size pizzas that you can customize from their list of toppings (plus walnuts and crasins, which are not on their menu) or get one of their pre-conceptualized combos by number.

They do not hand toss or shape the dough by hand.  There is a nearly fool proof dough press that pretty much does that, before they start building your pizza to order.  On my visit, I decided to get EVERYTHING on my pizza.  The pizza took a little longer to bake in their oven, but came out tasting pretty good (bell pepper didn't have enough time to bake and wilt).  For $12 it is a good deal for a restaurant inside a Strip casino.

Besides savory pizzas, they also offer 3 salad options (Classic Caesar, Mixed Greens and Pizza Salad).  ($5 - $12)

For desserts, they can make dessert pizzas too!  Nutella & Berries sounds most enticing. ($4 - $6)

Sodas with free refills.  ($3.50)

If you want relatively inexpensive casual meal while at MGM Grand, this is probably your tastiest option.  While you wait for your pizza to be delivered to your seat, you can entertain yourself with random quotes from Anonymous to JFK.

Service was fast and friendly.  They were generous with the toppings, but next time I will try ordering my pie with ALL OF THEIR Italian Sausage (Anthony M already got dibs on their Pepperoni).

Only negative (looking out for the post-clubbing crowd) is that they close at 11pm.  Way too early in my opinion.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,11,8,3,dJlRKzBdqhn2V4KbfRNzcw

The crust is perfectly cooked and thin, sauce isn't too tomato-y.... and I would recommend the build your own option. They have a great variety of toppings and for $12 you choose anything from Brussel sprouts to bacon. 

It was a comfortable amount for me and my boyfriend, but you might want your own if you're super hungry. Would totally recommend!!",OYU0v2z07ak-TbgrUo8l0A,0,0,5,7Uw4WKf9VNuIVXTeIzMsXg
