It was a solid, cheap breakfast (especially compared to some of the sky-high prices at places like Caesar's cafe).  I'm disappointed they don't give credit towards the mLife card though.

The vinyl seats of the food court chairs are cracked and look really bad.",mvq6mTZBd3mdDg_bZRWiuQ,0,0,3,84lpwaJCKleeVYc6jn-fTw

My husband went down yesterday and was back really quick and I volunteered to grab bfast today. LITERALLY NO LINE at 8am. I was expecting lines like 6-7 people deep. Nope! Our order came out at lightening-quick speed and I was back up to our room in about 5-8minutes TOPS! Of course the cost is a little more than a usual McDonald's but hey, it's to be expected. For (2) breakfast meals and (2) extra hash browns it came to $14.66. Much better than any of the breakfast buffets which charge at least $17/pp. Might go back again tomorrow!",kiHby7Jotm24QDM3SB32LA,0,0,5,iNHW9NiAi13AvtJhr3sJtA
3532830,2009-08-17,5,duVhqYoC-wIbsgv1SoqVDg,"Dear Monte Carlo,

I wanted to love you, I did. I read up on your website and I was interested in your centered strip location and your gorgeous pools, and you know what? THEY WERE!

I never stay at the same hotel twice in Vegas, I decided to give you a try...

My fiance and I are so disappointed in your lack of customer service. There was a situation in YOUR food court area where a food court employee that goes by the name of NANCY RODRIGUEZ decided to have a personal dispute in the hotel and throw food at her boyfriend, which happened to land ALL OVER my fiance's SILK TOP. It was ketchup, and ketchup STAINS.

After speaking to the front desk about the appalling situation and making a complaint we were told that  ""the food court has nothing to do with our hotel, you were at the wrong place at the wrong time"". No offers to clean the shirt, no apologies. We came here as a group of 20 whom paid for 6 seperate rooms and have brought plenty of business here and this is how it was handled!

We went back to the McDonalds Nancy Rodriguez worked for and complained to the manager about his employee's behavior at the hotel and how she has thrown food all over a PAYING GUEST! He then asked us "" What do you want me to do about it?"". You're the manager! You tell me what you are going to do!!!

In any case, with our luck Nancy Rodriguez decided to further her public dispute at the food court, which now consisted of 5 other people looking for a fight. I approached her angrily and told her ""Excuse me, when you decided to have food thrown at your boyfriend you covered my fiance with ketchup as well!"" She shrugged it off and stated ""(Sigh) Sorry"" and went back to her fight!

The Manager all the while just watched this without interfering! There was no HOTEL SECURITY breaking up this fight! An employee from HAAGEN DAS had to leave their booth and break it up!

Sorry, when I come to Vegas I like to have a little class and expect excellent customer service. This place just earned itself a terrible review. We are running back to you, Steve Wynn! Take all our money, we don't care! We want Monte Carlo burned down!",GInwMkzPSsexJn9KAQk_WA,4,2,1,8sH32vfaE3KZWTTh9Ac8mA

Prices aren't nearly as high as to what I would expect. Which was really a shocker, but in a positive way. We ventured here twice and both times the food was fresh and hot. It's one of the few affordable choices in this food court. This makes it a great place to pick up some McDonald's comfort food if your hotel is close such as the Monte Carlo itself, the Aria, Vdara or even the Cosmopolitan. I chose (4 stars) ""Yay! I'm a fan"" because I think that this is a convenient and affordable place. And, it's open 24/7, which is another positive!",7nEnXfmm3ICIJtGtFAMMuQ,0,0,4,Azj0bjADoFqYZvKQt0cMQg
