The food was fantastic. I had the special white pizza and a chicken salad... Pretty basic huh, but it truly stood out from any other pizza or chicken salad a have ever had
After speaking with the staff I was informed that everything is freshly made in-house on premisses and nothing is frozen. You can really taste the difference here.

But I love the pizza here so I will for sure keep coming back.

It grossed me out so bad. There was a piece of fat and nerve covered with sauce that I didn't notice wasn't actually meat. It was disgusting to take a bite into a weird nerve and have it squirt grease into my mouth! OMG just typing this is making me sick of re-living the moment. The sauce wasn't really alfredo either. Maybe their pizza is better but the lack of quality control on trimming the chicken turns me away from this place. I think this is the first place I have ever given one star!

I ended up taking most of hte sauce off with a spoon so it wouldnt turn the bread into mush. The bread itself tasted and felt like it was freshly baked and was easily as good as the contents, the chicken appeared to be the real deal not the composted chiken patties some places try to pass off and the sausages were whole links not the ground up bits I have had from other places.

Toppings. 
The meat balls are delicious and may be homemade as well. And I love that they use sausage crumbles not the processed chunks most other places do.  We got a philly steak and feta pizza as well and it was amazing.

I have ordered from Prima Pizza half a dozen times now. All but this last experience was enjoyable. This review covers what just happened 20 minutes ago. 

I stop in and order the 12"" Prima Pizza. The pizza that holds the name of the establishment. After a 1 minute drive home I find that my pizza has turned to soup. All the toppings slid off and I am left with one quarter of an edible pizza. I packed up my pizza soup and promptly returned it. To their credit they refunded my money without any fuss.

I very much enjoy their Buffalo Chicken Pizza. Prima's was the first I've had of the type, and while I've ventured out and tried many others -- nothing is like there's.
The giant chicken pieces, the right blend of sauce and cheese - I'm a big fan.

Husband loves the stomboli pinwheels, the regular stromboli and calzones (funny enough he still doesn't know the difference between the two).

We both like their philly cheesesteaks. While it's not life-changing, it definitely gets top marks for a delivery establishment.

There have been some items that we won't order again (a lot of the pastas like the chicken picatta, francese) and stay away from their fries it's not even worth the buck.
Also, we weren't big fans of some of the pizzas - the mexican on, the alfredo pizza... we just stick with what we know is great.

Their delivery service is pretty consistent. We've never waited longer than 45 minutes and usually get the food within 30 minutes.

We've never had a problem. Would recommend to anyone looking for an alternative to the popular pizza delivery chains.",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,4,1,4,-zN_MEQka9w5PHp8_X0AkQ

* Service: Very friendly waitress! She was accommodating and always had a smile on despite the fact we were a large party and had tons of questions for her.

* Food:  Tasty. We had the meat-lovers pizza, pasta with bolognese sauce, pasta with pesto cream sauce, pasta with vodka sauce and a chicken pizza and it was all pretty good (with the exception of the pesto cream sauce--bland).

* Overall experience (the reason for the 3 stars): The place had a funny smell to the point where they had to open the front door to air out the dining area. This place is NOT good for eat-in customers as it is clearly a take-out place. Despite the willingness and great attitude of the girl taking care of us we had to wait a bit for the food, our first order of garlic bread was cold and the second order of garlic bread came after we had finished our food.

Conclusion: I would try this place again but ONLY for carry out or delivery.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,1,0,3,t4DY0X6_hTmyEPyYofGlog

The wings are usually pretty soft even though I order them extra crispy, and are not too spicy.  

The salads however, are pretty good for a pizza joint.  Salad is my preferred meal here now, as the grilled chicken is some of the best I have had.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,4,2,3,KzXxsfsLNIcD01VoR-Rqxw

Now their Pizza, although very greasy is pretty good. It is when I venture off and try their other menu items that I get so disappointed. Philly.Cheesesteak is flavorless as any Philly I have ever had. There is no salt or.seasoning on the meat at all and the onions, YUCK. This is another restaurant IMPOSSIBLE For me.  When I asked the guy what the difference was between all of the cheesesteaks as they offer several choices, he shook his Head telling me they were all the same when clearly that was not the case. The Blonde gentleman did not have any customer service what so ever. The Lady who usually works there is nice but you can tell she'd rather be somewhere else. As the niceness comes off as a I have to be nice and not a I want to be nice kind of attitude. If I ever order from here again it will only be pizza. I would love to try their pasta but I am scared to! I am afraid to eat flavorless mush! In my opinion it needs a REDESIGN N the Chef needs to be trained to cook with Love!",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,10,10,2,BSKiKTM2h0LcSdMjQxi-LA

They seem to always be out of something (Lids for sodas etc ). Tonight they didn't have soda cups. So they gave us little plastic water cups. I'm pretty sure we were charged for the large to go cups that they usually serve. If we needed refills we had to go to the counter to ask. Once the food was out, that's pretty much where the service stopped. The people who run the place are nice, but customer service is really lacking. Their ""office"" is set up on a table in the dining area. Laptop, books, etc etc. the food is ok. Not my favorite. Stay away from the chicken fingers. They are crispy critters when they get to you, and leave a lot to be desired. Chicken wings are decent though. I have no desire to return, the Beach Cafe next door is much better.",MV3Pfu7x205_3OBtyRIusg,3,0,3,TfWm_AGD8ehYFJnLDl4bRQ

The first time, my hubs had a hair in his food and my chicken parmesan was pretty bad, chicken was dry and sauce too sweet. Since then, out of sheer desperation we've ordered from them and it's been decent. My hubby likes their chicken wings, they are grilled not fried. (personally I like them fried) I still don't love this place, but their food is ok. I wish, as a Pasta place they would do something about their marinara/bolognese. I love some good spaghetti and meatballs or chicken parm as comfort food, and their red sauce is just too sweet. Other than that, their pizzas are pretty good. I will say when I was there in person the first time, they were very, very friendly.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,1,0,3,Y9uw6h35QNlM_Ug_8UYPXw

I always pick something different and I'm always satisfied with the quality of ingredients and presentations.  I have been going there since they opened about three years ago and I know how particular they are and feel about where they purchase the ingredients and most of it is handmade.  I usually tantalize my taste buds with the extremely good Albania pizza specialties but tonight I ordered a specialty calzone and sampler appetizer plate. The company changed their cheese sticks to rock my world and onion rings to fresh and satisfying.  The canzone had mega cheese and nice hunks of vegetables,  so healthy. The red dipping marinara was delicious as usual. I can't wait to go back and say hi again. The only beef I have is the decor. It's pretty and all but I like more decoration.
