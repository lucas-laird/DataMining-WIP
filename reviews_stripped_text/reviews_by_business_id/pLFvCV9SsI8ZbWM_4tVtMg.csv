Atmosphere is Bob Marley pandering crap, but nothing distracting. It's definitely pricey(don't expect to pay less than $10-$15/meal) considering the plastic tablecloths, styrofoam containers used even for dining in, disposable utensils and limited service, only ignoring the serving size. Aside from this, the food is flavorful and the owner is friendly.",81hIqn_Fct1IGx2NL5Gf-A,0,0,3,-80v16_T4d-toooSnSkulg

I order a small oxtail dinner with rice and peas, festival, and salad. Now I must say the food was prepared different than any oxtail meal I have ever eaten from my family , or any other Jamaican establishment. The oxtails needed more seasoning and did not have any sauce/gravy or browning. The rice and peas were okay. The ""salad"" was not fresh and the tiny piece of bread aka""festival was soggy.


 How can you charge $13 for a plate of food and not fill it up with food? I expected more for the price I paid. In other places I have lived (Jamaica, Miami, NY)  $13 can easily feed 2 people.  On top of all of that there was a hair in my food and a piece of oxtail I was about to eat seemed to have a greenish brown tint to it. Yuck!",X4AM6vN3cXY8DYKO59lp-g,2,0,1,h_OusWhIkwwqu9cNYiwIrw

1098563,2014-08-24,3,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"I checked this place out based on a FaceBook friends suggestion.

TOTAL PRICE (before tip) = $20.54
WHAT I ORDERED: Large Jerk Chicken Plate... which includes... (1) breast (1) leg (1) thigh (1) plantain + cabbage and carrots + Ginger Beer + (1) Beef Patty

The place is small and cheap looking. This was my first time going here. There was an old Jamaican dude sitting by the front door wearing a chef's apron so I assumed he was one of the cooks. Now, usually when I enter a restaurant I am greeted with a hello and a smile, but this guy just gave me a mean mugg with that ""What the hell is this white boy doing here?"" look. It's a good thing people like that don't discourage me from eating.

I was finally greeted by a Jamaican female that runs the place (I guess) and she was much nicer.

The tables have that super cheap plastic place mat that has that old plastic smell just like my grandma had in the 80s/90s LOL.

The food was decent but to be TOTALLY honest, not only have I had better Jamaican food elsewhere, I've actually MADE better Jamaican food myself. The chicken was somewhat dry and the jerk sauce wasn't anything to write home about. The cabbage was barely cooked and I was expecting super soft buttery texture cabbage. The plantain was surprisingly good

I originally wanted a ""champagne cola"" after seeing it here on yelp but they were out of it... disappointed... so I ordered a ginger beer... although the ginger beer was the original ginger beer from Jamaica, I've had REED'S ginger beer and it's better.

I think that's the MAIN POINT HERE. Although everything is authentic Jamaican, you can get better tasting Jamaican food elsewhere (including the grocery store) and it would be much cheaper.",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,3,0,3,9GL-K_Sn4Udnb81pz8bpgw

Hands down great Jamaican fare. I have been to Jamaica a few times and find that there best food is comforting much like this joint's. (Pardon the pun) Things you will find there are typical dishes like jerked items, but delve in further to find ackee or bacalao (cod). Other items that were there are , meat patties (like empanadas), oxtail, and goat; yum and yummy. Everything we had was very good. We enjoyed about 10 dishes, to taste everything. 

The only downfalls are, price and the wait. 

However, with that said, it is a small, genuine place. You pay for quality, and that is evident in their food. The wait also can be prevented by calling ahead. 

The owner and staff are very nice. Super nice, in fact. If you are in this neck of the woods, please give it a try! Keep the good local places in business.!!!",59MZqFlQ2bFkKWsF-9TdLA,2,1,4,qC00fuWR4RGuU2wKIyJVYQ

1976680,2014-04-03,5,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"Heads up to anyone checking out this business before going: I'll do the short version for you. If you've ever had Jamaican Caribbean food before, this place is not going to hit the spot. The majority of four and five star reviews are from people who don't know any better.

I shop frequently at the nearby Sprouts grocery, and always mean to stop in here.
BF picked up takeout last night for dinner, and said the restaurant smelled heavenly and took it as a good sign that all of the employees were actually Jamaican.

Got home, and as others have said, takeout dishes are splashed everywhere- sauce out of the box and in the bag, one napkin and fork for two orders (and placed UNDER the takeout boxes in the bag in the puddle of spilled sauce), etc- little details that may slightly irritate, but not be relevant for dine-in customers.

But the food, despite smelling so good, was simply mediocre. All spice and no depth of flavor. Ordered the jerk chicken plate and the goat curry- and you could tell that both meats were indeed chicken and goat, but the similarities between the high quality versions of these dishes we've had elsewhere and what we actually received, was sad.

The jerk chicken was, for starters, dry. Rub seemed to be applied sparingly, and there was only flavor where you got seasoning. Good portion, but not necessarily good value. 
Goat curry sauce had a good consistency to it, and the meat was good, but the flavor was simply lacking- lacking depth, lacking that finger-licking jamaican flavor I'd come for. 
Sides included a mixed veggie type dish that was overcooked mush, and ""rice and red beans"" consisting mostly of rice and of a few scant red beans (I counted maybe 10) that appeared to be dried. When even your sides are underwhelming, there's a problem in the kitchen.

This was one of those rare times when the BF and I didn't finish our orders. And for about $30 for a week night take out dinner, that's pretty bad.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,1,2,dPvqy16-hQmXEiYNTldKEA

So you go west of the Strip and shoot up West Flamingo and you got a spot for curry chicken with rice, plaintains and stewed veggies.

Well It was just a 3 star meal.  Has plenty of room for improvement.  I wasn't blown away by what I ordered but there's plenty more I have yet to try.  It's nice to know it's around when I'm passing thru headed towards Summerlin.

Just got the right additional push reading fellow yelpers reviews besides not sure the last time had Jamaican food. Or if ever had it before. So I was looking forward too some jerk chicken, rice and beans, and plantain bananas. All things that are common or by no means expert on Carribean foods. Just the dishes that spark my interesting thinking about that style of food. 

I ordered jerk chicken, it comes with steamed rice or rice and beans (I like if going too the islands got do it right! so got the rice and beans), vegetables, fried plantain, and some kind of bread roll. What better way wash it all done with some Jamaican Kola! I am FAN of the seasoning on the jerk chicken. It not spicy spicy but little kick but besides the spicy just well rounded flavors. I got the large not small portion. Not sure if get less pieces of chicken. The large get thigh, breast, and drumstick. The skin now that has got too be the star more so then the meat. Nothing better then crispy chicken skin especially one marinaded in jerk seasonings and adds so much depth too it. The meat inside was nice moist. The rice and beans could have just had big bowl of that by itself! The rice cooked perfect with the beans. It nice hearty rice one that like said could make meal all by itself!!! The fried plantain nothing special but not often see places use plantain on the menu. The knot type roll and the vegetables both ok. The Kola was interesting. Different. If anything thinking close too cream soda taste? 

The decor inside is all over the place set up like deli with the counter and display cases. The dining area feels pretty packed together with the booths and tables. You go up too the counter order and once done let you know go up get it. Talk about Bob Marley and just reggae vibe. If they were playing music that would be full on island style. The different colors on the signs outside and inside. Many Bob Marley posters and Jamaican theme decor you would almost think gone too the islands. The service felt was good. 

Definitely place plan on coming back and trying more of the menu. They do have lunch specials too.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,2,4,2UKl8d7LLYt2gc0Ky-hm5Q

2621929,2011-07-27,1,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"Never having Carribean or Jamaican food before, I was interested when a coworker mentioned that he went to this place and enjoyed it. I went today with him and a few others to give this place a shot, and we were all quite surprised.  I didn't really expect it to be so good.  I ordered the Goat Curry with Jamaican Roti, and the Sweet Potato Pudding for dessert.  

I have yet to have a goat curry that I have really liked.  The dish in general always seems to be served with a sweet yellow Indian curry, which I'm not a huge fan of.  This curry was different.  I loved it.  It wasn't sweet at all, nor made with coconut.  It had a perfect spicy flavor without going over the top.  There were little potatoes in it, along with very tender and moist stringy goat meat.  The roti was amazing... very flat, floury bread with a little bit of spice cooked into it, perhaps from a curry.  I dipped it in my curry sauce, and thoroughly enjoyed every bite.  There was also a little coli flower salad that came with the dish, and a whole wheat bun.  

The Sweet Potato Pudding caught me off guard.  I didn't really taste a lot of sweet potato in it, but did taste perhaps a little rum or something like that.  It had raisins in it too, and was more of a little pudding cake.  It was quite enjoyable, but after all of the food that we had, i just couldn't finish it!  

We also had some of the beef and chicken stuffed patties.  You HAVE to try the beef patties.  They are spicy with shredded beef stuffed inside a layered pastry.  Just deliciousness.  When I come back, and I definitely am, there is simply no way I could not order one of these on the side.

Personally, I think the reviews on this place are low.  The ambiance isn't much; it fees like a mom and pop diner.  The staff offers adequate service, but isn't overly friendly.  The place is just very casual.  However, I think the food is quite a bit above average.  The prices are slightly high, but if that bothers you just drink a water and don't order any extras.  The food is worth it.  I don't really like sweet Indian curry, so this curry has me hooked!  I can't wait to try the ox tail!",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,8,5,4,KX50p7DAsn8DeG--MK16vg

We were in Vegas canvassing for Obama. Just as we hit our absolute tolerance limit for casino food, we had a run of luck and ended up at Tasty Island.

It's located in a strip mall on Flamingo Rd about 3 or 4 miles off the Vegas Strip, and looks like a typical deli with a counter and 5 or 6 tables. They have a Caribbean menu and a sandwich menu, so we chose Caribbean. The lady at the counter was a good sport and explained what calaloo was, so we had a ""small"" calaloo and salt fish dinner, and a jerk chicken dinner, with coconut milk drinks. The dinners were generous and super tasty -- spicy (we asked for spicy), and served up with rice and peas and a few sides du jour (fried plantain and festival) and gravy. The gravy was freakin awesome -- spicy and naturally hearty, not your typical starch-thickened glop. Everything was served in styrofoam takeout containers with plastic cutlery (this is really a takeout place). 

When she brought out my dinner, the lady asked if I liked very spicy food...and when I said yes, she went and got me a container of extra gravy. From that, and from the other review, I wonder whether she initially held back on the gravy because she didn't want to freak out non-Caribbeans with too much spice.

The restaurant seems to cater mainly to the local Jamaican community, at least when we were there. But the people running the place -- the lady at the counter and the big nice man in back (chef?) -- are friendly and hospitable. It seems like a family-run place. There's a good selection of Caribbean dishes, from oxtails to jerk, from curry goat to escoveitched fish, and more. Decor is standard deli, with posters of Bob Marley and hmm local Caribbean flora decorating the walls. There was a mix of people coming in for takeout, and families sitting down for a casual meal, everyone talking to each other. Dinners run $8 to $14 (and that includes everything you need). 

This is a great neighborhood joint. Spicy comfort food, and cheap. Perfect for a quick sit-down or takeaway when you just can't stomach another starchy reheated resort meal. It's also nice to decompress with actual Las Vegas-ans, the people from all over the world who come to live and work in this weird mecca.",7tleziJfAQcbnEhaKVqvsw,3,2,5,508NBJ5T9VV_SVgA0Fr_-g

2. I walked in, it's a cluttered place, divey is the word, located on the corner of a strip mall. What normally would be a deli case is filled with boxes as you enter. There was no greeting from the 3 people behind the counter and towards the back.

3. I go to the table - 2 placed together - to meet my fellow 3 diners. No menu provided, no service to the table.

4. Only 5 feet from the counter, I asked the person behind the counter for help. At several points, nobody was present for service of any sort.

5. The cashier/order taker? When asked what was their best dish and what would he recommend, he basically said he didn't know. At another point, our table mates asked about the size of the dish and he strongly suggested they order the large size. They wanted the 'SM' size - they were right, he was wrong.

6. We had a lot of questions of what was what, e.g. Calaloo, Ackee, Escoveitched Fish, Roti. The responding answers were only somewhat helpful at best. Frankly, I want the person working there to have a good idea of what items are and be able to suggest items.

7. When asked about the Coco bread, he stated, ""It's just bread"" and he pointed at the loaf. 

8. We had a side order of a 'Beef Patty' which I thought resembled Cherry pie from 7-Eleven. I do not see/taste the allure of it.

9. Three of us had the Jerk chicken. The menu states all meals are served with peas - not true. None was provided.

9. On the good side, the dead Jerk Chicken was normal and the rice was good. The Red Stripe beer was good as well.

10. When the food came out, it was all in styrofoam with plasticware. Even at divey, hole-in-the-wall places, one normally gets plates and silverware but not here.

11. In the end, it took about 10 minutes to obtain the bill, apply the discount, double-check on the split of who pays what part of the bill, and then finally receiving the credit slip to sign.

4054952,2013-08-21,6,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"Here at Tasty Island Carribean, you get some authentic Jamaican food.  I was introduced to Tasty Island by the GF.  We've driven by a handful of times and she's mentioned that her favorites include the beef patty and their Kola Champagne.  Her best friend was raised on Jamaican food and even she pays a visit whenever she's in town.  So, you know what this means?...means Tasty Island is some good authentic Jamaican food.  But I had to see for myself and here's my thoughts.

-Beef Patty:  I didn't have one for myself, but I did sneak a bite or two from the GF.  When I first heard beef patty, I was thinking a hamburger type patty.  I was wrong. A beef patty here is actually quite different.  A Jamaican beef patty resembles a beef empanada.   I thought it was pretty good, the crust was flaky, and the beef was tasty.  If I wasn't trying to eat clean, I would have gotten one for myself.  

-Jerk Chicken:  This is was my meal and it came with a plate full of rice.  I cheated and had a couple of spoons of the rice and it was the bomb.  My only wish...I wish could have eaten more.  The Jerk Chicken was as expected...tasty, spicy, and moist.  What?  Did I just say moist?  The Jerk Chicken reminded me of a Flip dish called Chicken Adobo, but with a kick to it. My suggestion is the Jerk Chicken. I want me some Jerk Chicken right now!!!

The restaurant itself is a little small.  Since it wasn't too crowded, our party of 6 ate comfortably.  Your food also takes a bit to get prepared and served, but that's how it's suppose to be here.  Not sure how many cooks in the kitchen, but they do take their time.  But it's all good, all worth it.

This was my first time visiting Tasty Island and first time eating a Jamaican cuisine.  First thing, I noticed upon entering the restaurant was that no one was at the counter.  My friend had to make a noise and then she got up from the doorway where she was sitting.  The lady behind the counter was very unfriendly and uninviting.  She spoke in a very low voice and never smiled at all.  It was almost as if she didn't want any customers.  But, I was hungry and really wanted to try some authentic Jamaican food.  Later after I finished my dish, I noticed a different lady behind the counter and she seemed a little more friendly and spoke in a nicely toned voice than the lady that took our order.

On the other hand, the food was good.  I ordered a small curry chicken and some jerky Chicken wing that both my friend and I shared.  The jerk chicken was really hot like in a spicy kind of way.  And so was the beef patty.  So beware of that!  But it was flavorful and pretty good.  The curry dish was pretty good as well.  The temperature of the food was warm and rice was very dry and stuck together. I wish they had served one plantain that I could have tried with the dish.  After much though, I decided well the heck I might as well try the rum cake too and boy, did I feel drunk!  Just kidding lol.  It was okay, but I wouldnt order it again.

I ended up with a jerk chicken plate with rice/peas cabbage and a little corn bread type roll, a beef patty and a side of plantain. The only thing that didn't excite me was the little roll. The food was great. I gave it 4 stars because the dining area is shabby. The chairs are worn and the placemat rubbed ink onto my arms. It wouldn't come off with soap/water. I had to use nail polish remover.",ZiCqR23A0AZK3dOnfX7Tlw,1,0,4,1lRGct3GRCaOFwKZYiuFhg

On that note, I loved it! I am the queen of hot sauce, so this place hit the spot. I got the jerk chicken & it was spicy and tasty and just plain old good! Hubby got oxtails, which when combined w their specialty HOT hotsauce was great. Oh how i wish they sold there hotsauce. Best hotsauce I have ever tasted. I actually contemplated stealing it.

5355574,2015-08-24,7,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"There's nothing like homestyle Jamaican cooking! I don't think there's a lot of Caribbean food places in town, so it was cool seeing this place in a shopping center near my house while doing errands. The service was more on the slow side, but I think that the wait was worth it. The people working here were really friendly, too!

The interior was a little dated. There are tables and booths, but it didn't really have a set layout. When I arrived there was no music playing, the TV wasn't on, and the patrons dining in were super quiet. The silence was a little unbearable and kinda made the experience a little more awkward (especially with people lining up behind me). Thankfully, a younger gentleman, who I'm assuming worked there too, turned on the TV so that the room wasn't filled with the uncomfortable silence and the steady hum of the refrigerators. 

I ordered the the small size jerk chicken and a side order of plantains. 

The jerk chicken was pretty great! From what I remember, if you don't cook jerk chicken the correct way it gets rubbery and hard -- borderline inedible. 

The jerk chicken here was tender and juicy, with a nice chew to it.  The seasoning had the perfect spicy kick, which was enough to make me sweat a little. (Keep in mind that my tolerance for spice is a little lower than everyone else's, but that's what makes Caribbean food desirable -- the spices!)

The rice and peas (beans) is the best thing to go with the jerk chicken. It also had a good Caribbean spice to it, so it will really give you a mouthful of unique  flavors if eaten with the chicken. Yummy!

The plantains weren't like the plantains I'm usually used to eating. These were more like long, slender slices of ripe plantain fried to golden brown perfection. They had the perfect texture and they're on point with the sweet, caramelized homemade flavor.

I didn't really like the beef patties here. I think there are other better tasting ones out there but until I find a good place in Vegas, this place will have to suffice. 

The food here definitely has a personality of its own. If you're a spice fanatic and are down to taste the flavors of Jamaica, then give this place a try!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,12,9,4,ow7Jr8yBk_UtmOUiHc322A
5390860,2012-07-09,3,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"A co-worker of mine suggested this place because he knows I'm always up for trying new restaurants for lunch.  Found the menu on usmenuguide and went with the calaloo and salt fish dish.  I had no idea what exactly calaloo and salt fish were, but I was feeling like getting my Zimmern on that day.

When we went to pick up the food, there was a little bit of a wait as several customers came in after we arrived which seized the attention of the lone worker up front.  She was very friendly though and maybe we just arrived too early for pickup.  I decided to order some ""fresh lemonade"" which I believe cost $3 and came out of some jug in the refrigerator behind the counter.  I think I need to break from this narrative and go straight to the review of the lemonade.  IT WAS DISGUSTING.  Overly sweet and just not a pleasant flavor, and it didn't taste fresh to me in the least.  I threw it away immediately upon getting back to the office.  

The food was much more pleasing in every way.   First off there was a mountain of food.  The prices run a little high, but you get a lot for it.  Callaloo turned out to be some leafy substance that reminded me of spinach and/or seaweed.  Saltfish turned out to be bland pieces of chicken.  Just kidding they were (spoiler alert) salty pieces of fish.   There were also a few pieces of plantain that I thought tasted a little off from other versions I've had in the past.   The Callaloo and saltfish tasted nice (and yes, it was really salty) and I liked the preparation on the rice as well.  

I can't say I'd ever clamor to revisit tasty island, though I'd definitely give some more of their entrees a try if it came down to it.   Moral of the entire review:  When life gives you lemons, don't make Tasty Island lemonade with it.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,3,4,3,gKTp6gScbd96xGyk2DVjng

Well, not really, but my best friend since the 7th grade is Jamaican-American and her house was practically my second home growing up.  Her huge family is like my family and I've traveled to Jamaica with them three times, so I do know a little about the food.  Guess where my second family likes to eat when they're in Vegas?  Yeah, mon, Tasty Island, so you know it has to be good.  My girl was in town with some of her clan this past weekend and they wanted to have lunch here so we did.  I always get the oxtail with rice and peas and a slice of plaintain, washing it down with Kola Champagne (best soda ever)--oh yeah!  I had a beef patty as an appetizer and that thing had a slight kick-it was fresh out of the oven and it was a little spicy hot for me.  I can't do the jerk chicken because I'm too wimpy for the spicy, but my son had it and he ate it up (he's also almost Jamaican by default).  He usually gets the curry chicken, but they were out.  Service here can be on the slow side while you wait for your food, but that's why you should have a patty in the mean time: they have beef, chicken, and veggie patties, which are pastries with your choice of filling.  Some dishes are served with festival, Jamaican dumplings, and I tried my friend's, but it was kind of dry.  Other than that, we had another great meal here.

5797605,2012-12-01,2,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"First experience with Jamaican cuisine. I try so hard not to judge on the atmosphere of restaurants like these, because some of the best restaurants are truly hole in the wall establishments. It is in a strip mall in a shopping center. I will admit the location is a little run down in itself, and I felt like the two times I came here they were still under construction from the last time I first came (which was about a three months interval since the first time).

The service was alright. I didn't get much of an opinion on certain items when I questioned what they were like and what could work best for someone who is picky about their diet, just simple remarks as, ""oh, yeah, that's good"" or ""I'm sure you'll like it"" on just about everything I asked about. I went with the Calaloo. I believe this was the first time I had a Jamaican style plantain, and it wasn't bad. The collard greens were alright. A little on the soggy side, lukewarm. I'm not sure if it was the plate that I got, but aside from other reviews found about this place, the Calaloo has to be the least salty? Might not be salty, but still very greasy.

The Calaloo was the only dish I tried the times I went., so the next time I go I want to get another to feel out this place a little more. Aside from the service and appearance, I feel like there is something I could be discovering amazing from this place if I decide to go back.",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,3,3,3,FsCEhkVDX5edFyV8OImcGg
5869798,2014-11-29,1,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"This place is super far from the strip and hard to say if it's worth it. The prices are extreme. $15.50 for a large curry goat and $4.50 for some muthafriggin' Irish Moss!
And the decor of the place is extremely cheap and almost corny 80's Jamaica vibe catered to American tourists wandering the resorts in Negril. How many cliche Bob Marley posters can you get? 

As for the curry goat it was pretty good, the cabbage not so much and the rice lacked peas. It was mostly rice. Not sure if I'll be back mon.",7TNmpLss68891S1u1JUclA,1,0,3,dXAaDiOAUOHAhiXwuehgsg

5945026,2014-04-23,1,pLFvCV9SsI8ZbWM_4tVtMg,"So as I am learning the area a little better I stumbled on this place. I use to work in St Croix so defiantly use to the flavors. ordered the jerk chicken with rice and beans and came with stewed cabbage and fried banana, patties ( sort of like corn bread.) , and rum cake along with some cream soda. 

First off the chicken is good I did have a couple of top layers of the chicken that where a little dry however under was good also not raw or pink -- Great spice rub on the chicken. The rice and beans where good and stewed cabbage great. 

Patties are patties enough said lol 

Rum Cake. OMG RUM, This deff takes me back to St Croix's seeing the amount of rum on that island is insane. This is super moist not hard or store bought def. could tell homemade, I even think they soak the raisin's. This is a must. 

Also I got D&G sof drink not a spelling error there from Jamaica I tell you a blended drink with rum or tequila turned into a slushy with this would be soooo amazing. 

Strong menu items, Main's tend to be a bit pricey but you can also sides a little cheaper.Rum Cake is a deff must",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,0,4,OOEMQY0LgGZ9RWxB-l5aqA
