Within one hour of eating there, I became severely nauseated and vomited all food from dinner. I was very sick, went to sleep and am fine now. I see no other explanation (usually strong stomach, no fever, no flu, no other food or drinks to explain). I cannot say which tapa was the culprit, but food safety should be high on the list. I hope this posting leads to a review of the procedures at Jaleo. I wish I could have gone back to talk to the manager, but am heading out of town now.",ryXgT9tS9lScQn9vpM5oRw,1,0,1,nt783RmvoK3VchF5T3nhUA

tiny portions, kinda bland, and out of 7 dishes, we could hardly pinpoint any signature creations from that experience.

We had some pizza around 5, so we weren't super hungry by the time we came here, around 9. I love the tapas concept and thought the food was fantastic, but it was really expensive (e.g., $14 for a martini). We spent around $170 with tip for two people. Really steep considering we didn't eat as much as we normally would have. I enjoyed the croquetas and goat cheese.

27416,2013-04-28,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"New to Vegas, I took the advise of my neighbor and decided to give Jaleo a try because I LoVe tapas.  We went on a Saturday night, so it was crowded and loud.  It was so loud I could hardly focus on reading my menu, but nothing that a cocktail couldn't tame.

We tried what felt like the entire menu...Veal cheeks, paella with squid ink and shrimp, little grilled cheese sandwiches, stuffed pasilla peppers, a fried egg with caviar...and the list goes on and on.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the veal cheeks.  I'm not sure if its because it was the last thing we ate and I was already full, or if I just didn't like the flavor.  Actually I think it was because there was a little tiny calf mooing in my ear with every bite...I'm pretty sure that's what ruined it for me.

With as many restaurants as Vegas has I'm not sure if this is a must go back to next week kind of a restaurant, but I'm sure I will be back eventually.",UjaFrJyZh9b-NtWzW-luGQ,1,0,4,X4NNXXccajf5V5xNBNXOcQ

41518,2013-01-09,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"This was my favorite restaurant of my Vegas trip.  I've always loved spanish food since a family vacation when I was 14, so when I saw there was a tapas place in the hotel we were staying at, I knew we had to go.  We didn't have a reservation (story of my life) so we ended up at the little bar in front of one of the prep areas.  This ended up being really cool since I actually saw one of my dishes being prepared- more on that later.  
         Our server was great- she had a lot of solid recommendations, including the gin and tonic.  It's my boyfriend's favorite drink, so we had high hopes which were completely met and exceeded.  Delicious!  The sphere of ice was awesome too.
    We started with the salmon tartare and salmon roe cones, which were reminiscent of those we had at The French Laundry- not as good, and slightly fishy for my taste, but my boyfriend enjoyed them.  Next the spanish omelette and gazpacho.  The spanish omelette was good, but only average.  The gazpacho was AMAZING though.  While we were waiting I noticed the cook in the prep station in front of me delicately placing tomatoes and sprigs of something green- using tweezers(!)- into a dish.  I commented on how cool that attention to detail was, and two minutes later that dish appeared in front of me, ready for cold soup to be poured over it!  The soup was fantastic, the perfect melding of all the flavors, not too spicy and salsa-y, not to greasy and oily.   I would have been totally happy eating several bowls of this the entire meal.  We also got the shrimp sautéed in garlic, grilled asparagus and raw salmon.  The shrimp and asparagus were as expected, good, but not incredible.  The salmon was my boyfriend's favorite part of the meal.  It was sliced paper thin and spread across the plate.  I have no idea how they sliced it so thin but it was wonderful.  
     All in all a great meal- I wish I had been hungrier so I could have tried more things.",aMcImcnrZzsI_sXmlUrIRg,0,0,5,GC-i2TIhbce5xrU2IEMeHw

56222,2011-10-30,15,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I am torn between 2-3 stars.  In actuality, the food at Jaleo reminds me of being in Spain.  Their sangria is very, very well made.  I was actually surprised that it has the acidic tang with a spicy finish.  Most sangria in the States is usually watered down red wine with heaps of sugar and citrus fruit for a more exotic presentation.  

We had the carne asada which was nothing to write home about.  It was a hangar steak sliced and served with a pepper confit.  It was about 4 ounces for $14...not worth it at all.  

What was interesting is watching the chef make the paella with a wood burning open kitchen.  This created a very aromatic scent to the restaurant.  I ordered the paella iberico, which included pork ribs.  The paella was deliciously prepared and I was impressed by the saffron flavors every bite had.  I was VERY disappointed to have only two pieces of pork ribs that were about 1 inch in length and had mostly skin.  This plate costed $32 and honestly, it was really worth about $6 because it was only rice.  

If the plates were more substantial, I could have given Jaleo 4 stars.  Lack of meat in paella dish is a sin and rarely ever forgiven.  I give it 3 stars (mostly for effort) for the execution of authentic Spanish cuisine in the middle of Vegas.",jLTC4D4IrL5HPh3Vv7Y92w,23,15,3,bqgarHI_MQ_zGt7-Gtgn6Q

Semi small orders that are reasonably priced for a high scale tapas restaurant. Some of my favorites were the gazpacho with tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers, the liquid olive dish was amazing!.. I could probably eat a whole plate of just that. The fried dates in bacon were delicious but the presentation was unappetizing. (Order it and you'll see) Not EVERYTHING that we ordered was 5 stars but there were a few that were absolutely delicious and I will definitely be going again and trying the rest of the things on the menu.

Really enjoyed the scallops and beet salad. The only thing our party wasn't fond of was the fried wonton thing with cod filling drizzled with honey. The description sounded tasty, since everything seems to go well with honey.  I was expecting actual fish inside but it was more of a cream with a strong fishy cod flavor, unexpected but not in a good way. I grabbed one and it actually had nothing inside, so I was basically eating a chip with honey over it. That dish didn't ruin the overall experience. Great service, the waiter was helpful, and so were our bus boys. They were quick and attentive.

I didn't like the sangria as much as I thought I would. It just tasted like red wine to me. The gin and tonic was really good, but it is expensive. :(

We ordered the garlic soup, dates with bacon, monk fish, patatas bravas, brussel sprout salad, and the lamb ribs. We wanted to get the paella instead of the ribs, but they only make one type of paella each night and it happened to be lobster. If you have food allergies make sure you ask your waiter about it. Their seafood stock uses crab meat so I couldn't eat it...really disappointed about that, but what can you do. 

The only thing I disliked was the monk fish. It was too sour for my taste. Everything else was great! My favorites were the lamb ribs and the patatas bravas. The meat on the ribs was juicy and had an awesome crust. The patatas bravas is interesting. It's fried potato slices with tomato and garlic sauce but they are SO good...but it is kind of weird to remember one of the highlights of your meal being what was essentially potato chips.",TniUQ0s2fwpggxmAMTLOng,0,0,4,9oa9SXA0d3qJDv8rHpIPjA

The food was a preset sample menu that was around $100 per person, half of us left hungry...tiny samples...nothing memorable.  The highlight was the paella which was too salty...and they ran out of rabbit.  A couple of dishes were fine but again nothing memorable....they also ran out of a few dishes.

Drinks are overpriced their signature gin & tonic came with tonic syrup with club soda...my wife hated it as the tonic syrup was used up quickly.  She barely had any of it and asked for a replacement which they flatly denied....our bill was over $2k you think you'd be able to get the drink you want.

Our waiter was pretentious as was the whole experience....the highlight was their gin and tonic sorbet sounds good but tastes like melted sorbet soaked in gin...simply horrible.  The chocolate flan was good but of course they had to make it unique by dumping olive oil on it.  We all enjoyed our one spoon of the flan (14 people shared essentially one scoop).  I guess I'm not sophisticated enough to understand. 

Avoid this place plenty of better places to drop a few $100 for dinner....I gave it a second star because our group made it a good time.",ZvLLy8DisjZ5v1uTsX1JKw,5,3,2,2wMcbbmzF35nCooUVPLDLQ

The server explained the restaurant serve tapas - small dishes to share at the table. We had tapas in Spain and Portugal, so we were excited - and probably overexcited as the server had to warn me that I might have ordered too many dishes for the two of us. 

The food was good but could have been great had the chef been less liberal with the finishing salt. The finishing salt were big flakes of salt which overwhelmed everything. When we realized after the first dish that the finishing salt was the culprit in making our food so salty, we picked out the flakes in subsequent dishes. 

The Patatas Bravas was delicious, and despite being a pretty big portion for tapas, we finished every morsel. The paella of the day (cooked in a big pan in the dining room) was iberico ribs, and it was so fragrant and delicious, I could have eaten another order even though I was stuffed.

137618,2011-02-12,1,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"The food was okay.  VERY expensive.  Service was atrocious.  Sangria was terrible.  Paella was spat out by all who tried it.  Dried out rabbit with lots of pinbones.  Bleccch.

They make the sangria to order so you get to see what's in it.  Cheap red wine, a little brandy, and a slice of orange.  $10?  Really.  This was unlike any sangria I've ever had.  Undrinkable

It was the service that really torpedoed our experience here, though.  It took us a half hour to get our first round of drinks.  We had to flag down the manager and have hime take our order.  Our server was a frazzled mess.  He was staring at the computer in the service station literally the whole night.

I got his attention at one point and asked if I could order a drink.  We were a group of 8 and no one had a drink yet.  I asked for a glass of tempranillo and he took off without taking anyone else's order.  Another member of our party managed to flag him down 10 minutes later and he tried to do the same thing!  Take one more person's order then fly away.  TAKE EVERYONE'S ORDER AT THE SAME TIME!  It was insane.  We spent well over a thousand dollars for 8 people.

I've eaten at Bazaar in LA, Jose Andres' other west coast foray into high-end tapas and it was one of the greatest meals I've ever experienced.  This place was a real let down.

There was so much that was wrong.  The fried dates in a shoe on the table.  Not cute or appetizing.  The sangria was absolutely awful.  Service was non-existent.  We wanted to order dessert but didn't have time since it took us so long to order and receive food and drink.  Paella inedible.  The room was way too bright.  I can't really even convey with words how sucky our meal was and how ripped-off we felt when we got the enormous bill.

The manager heard us grumping about the meal and didn't offer anything to try to turn the tide of negativity.  I think he was used to it.  Most other tables in our vicinity seemed disgruntled.  One table walked out ant the manager tried to get them to pay for the food they ordered and never got.",MhGqP_htKJRIasS98BBDMg,1,1,2,NnpjTyeT6KJyGKGTeuQe7A

145590,2012-04-02,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"So yelp let me down on this one. 

I was expecting to get a trendy atmosphere, great food and good drinks. We did not get that. 

We arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation. We waited for about 15 minutes and then were seated. We were seated in the booths that were open to the hotel. They were WAY too close together. We may as well been dining to the people next to us because we could hear everything they said. We ended up talking to the couple next to us and they were very nice but still, not what I was looking for. There were also a table of people sitting at at table right outside the restaurant. They had their children playing on the foozball table and they were screaming and making noise and basically ruining our dinner. Not that it was quiet to begin with. The music was way too loud. 

So a HUGE thumbs down for the atmosphere. I guess I am just too old for trendy. 

We ordered the tomato bread, the cod empanadas, the manchengo queso, and the boneless chicken wings. Our waitress said that there was a chicken special that was so much better than the chicken wings so she would bring that instead. I did not object but I should have. 

The tomato bread was yummy. $6 bucks.

The manchengo queso was an actual small slice of cheese with some dried fruit. I was thinking I was going to get some sort of yummy dip. Nope, a small piece of hard cheese. Wow Chef! Did they teach you that in culinary school?  I suppose queso does mean cheese in Spanish so it is my fault for assuming. $9 bucks

The cod empanadas were more like wontons to me. They were fried with pureed cod inside and honey drizzled on the outside. The taste was decent but the texture made me want to gag a little bit. 

The boneless chicken wings. These chicken wings cost $18 dollars for 4 of them. While I was eating them, I was thinking..""These are not any better than Buffalo Wild Wings."" NOT IMPRESSED. If those were sooo much better than the other ones, I would have hated to taste those. 

My husband ordered a glass of scotch and I ordered a bramble (house specialty drink). They were $12 bucks a piece.

Our bill came to about $90 dollars because after those food fails and the noise, we decided to leave and go somewhere else. We were still starving. The plates are ridiculously small for what they charge. And here's the thing. THEY AREN'T THAT GOOD. I don't get it. 

We will never step foot inside that place again. What a disappointment.",rONMYLVdSph8OQBb27wDKQ,2,0,2,KQASFkCcPFNsFRYJkOMGsw

Snobby hostess: we came on a friday night with an 815 pm reservstion which wasnt needed as it was half empty.  we arrived and stood in front of the hostess as she was doing her own thing.  She looked up and gave us a greeting that felt like, ""hi I guess I have to acknowledge you because you're standing in front of me""  We told her we had a reservation and said she would help us.  Then some other lady came by and she started talking to her.  We stood there awkwardly as they chatted. Luckily another hostess came by and said, ""did you need any help"" to which I said, ""oh thanks well that other lady said she'd help us.."" to which said lady responded with disdain, ""oh yeah you can seat them.""

Decor:  we sat along the front edge of the restaurant:  one halfside of the table were chairs and the other half were cushioned benches with a backrest that went only halfway up your back.  It was awkward cuz if you wanted to rest your back you had to slouch big time.  Basically seating was awkward.

Now to the food:  my gawd it was underwhelming.  We wanted to be blown away with unique flavor combos that would make us cry.

1.  Chicken dish (see picture).  This was the waiters wife's favorite and to us it was forgettable.  Bland and boring in flavor, texture and presentation.  The jerk chicken at The Wicked Spoon buffet was even better.

2.  Chorizo (no photo):  if you're going to serve chorizo at non fast-food restaurant, It better be mind blowing.  I've had way better from Mexican fast-food.  There was some white sauce that accompanied it that didn't make it any better.  This dish was one of the waiters favorites.

3.  The lamb (see photo):  best lamb I've had.  It was refined.  Well cooked well.  Good light flavor.

4.  Patatas Bravas (see photo):  tasty but I've had different variants of this dish.  Nothing special.

5.  ""Fried chicken"" (see photo):  recommended.  It's like chicken casserole that was deep fried in bite size pieces.

6.  Goat stuffed peppers:  amazing.  Mind blowing not quite.  But finally something creative and with interesting flavor combo.

Would I come here again?  It would not be my first choice.  I would rather go to bazaar or the spanish tapas restaurant in Aria or firefly.",ZdHi2ZuvY_IXSIfI6jSVEg,1,1,3,xUfdxCoZRYZrweWSLf210g

The décor at the Jaleo in Las Vegas is very contemporary, which fits it since it is in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. We ordered the Patatas bravas, whose name and description was exactly the same as our favorite dish in DC. To our horror, instead of deliciously pan fried fingerling potatoes topped with a yummy garlic aioli and a spicy tomato sauce that we get at the DC Jaleo, out came a bowl of potato chips with a garlic aioli and a tomato sauce squirted on top of them. This was the first of many disappointments of the evening.

Long story short, we will not be going back to the Jaleo in Las Vegas.  With that said, we are looking forward to going back to DC and visiting the fabulous Jaleo there.",JB_IAfAPjiVzNnQ6bAG3bw,0,0,2,j_3Khu9Vvob4HUHOXgVs-g

I'm shocked that this restaurant is getting a 3.5 yelp average (which typically means a mediocre restaurant), as I just had one of the best meals of my life here and for a price that was incredibly reasonable. I eat out a VERY nice meal almost every week for work travel and compare this restaurant to that set. The dishes at Jaleo were creative with astonishing and successful combinations of flavors and ingredients.

I had:

1. Beet salad (best I've ever had by far)
2. Wild mushrooms with potato puree (delicious)
3. Shrimp sautéed in garlic (plate-licking good)
4. Spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and apples (simple but loved it)
5. For desert, flan (a masterpiece, sensational)

Also had a nice glass of wine and coffee. I was stuffed and the pre-tip bill was only $65, which I considered a bargain given the amount of food and the quality.

A sense of the creativity-- the beet salad was served with beets three ways (raw, boiled, & fried). Any of these 5 dishes, I would have raved about at another restaurant. To get 5 such dishes in one meal blew me away! I can't wait to go back.

Other comments/suggestions: The restaurant is busy and a bit clubby in feel, so it's loud though it may vary somewhat depending where you sit. The food comes out when ready, so if you want to stage your meal (e.g., appetizers then main), order in stages, not all at once. With such a large selection, it can help to ask for the waiter's favorites and the most popular dishes across the menu.

This absolutely deserves a 4.5 rating on yelp; I've yet to go to any restaurant that I felt deserved a 5. 

Overall - loved it, highly recommend it, and wish they'd open one in LA!",wvJsZd-s2wWIZFgDMNcS0g,4,1,5,rcELaGdH-cUgCQsojIFS9A

We came in during social hour on 9/29/16 after eating a few plates at Scarpetta. We sat at the bar and got an order of calamari and the potatoes bravas. I ordered sangria and my husband asked the bartender, Stephen, for advice on a vermouth. The vermouth Stephen picked out was so amazing I ordered one once I was done with my sangria. We had a lovely time enjoying a few drinks and chatting with Stephen. The couple next to us ordered the jamon iberico la bellota and it looked so good we decided to order it as well. I also ordered a glass of wine, since Albarino is my favorite wine style and hard to find. The iberico may be expensive at $35 an ounce, but it is absolutely worth it. The tomato covered bread it comes with is somehow equally to die for. 

We left Vegas on Saturday 10/1 on an evening flight. Since we needed to pick up our checked bags at Cosmo before leaving for the airport, we decided it made the most sense to eat dinner at Cosmo. We would up going to Jaleo again because it was that good. We got two of the iberico sliders, a few cheeses, and...the jamon iberico la bellota again...I figured, when in Rome. It's not really something we can get at home. We finished with the gin and tonic dessert which was light and ephemeral. I enjoyed a few glasses of wine and my husband tried a few sherries. 

Everything we had here was amazing. The bar service on the second visit was a bit abysmal at first. But halfway through Stephen came back into work and made sure we were taken care of.

We started our meal with the signature gin and tonics, which were the best part of the meal. They were infused with different spices, clean tasting, and herbal. Worth the $20 in my opinion. We then ordered a bunch of tapas: fried dates wrapped in bacon, house made chorizo, patatas bravas, and octopus salad, and a Spanish spring roll (rollito).

The breading on the dates obscured the natural caramel flavor of the dates. It also detracted from the usual salty-sweet combo I'm used to with this appetizer. This is the first time I have been served this dish fried, I'm not keen to try it again.

 The patatas bravas was so disappointing. They used waxy potatoes instead of a starchy variety, so it never got crispy like the dish should be. The romesco sauce also tasted more like bland ketchup than the rich, tangy, creamy sauce it should be.

 The octopus had an off flavor to it --it tasted like old tuna. It was tender but lacking an flavor. It was served with bland boiled potatoes and a dash of smoked paprika. It needed herbs or vinegar to wake it up. 

The spring roll was filled with potatoes and chorizo which needed seasoning--not enough chorizo in the filling to compensate for the under salted potatoes. The Apple mustard that it was served with was amazing: sweet and spicy. I wish I could have had it with every dish--it would have considerably improved their flavors.

The best dish was the housemade chorizo. It was seared with cider which gave it an addictive sweet, salty and fatty flavor. It was served on top of creamy pea puree 

All in all this place has dissuaded me from ever buying a Jose Andres cookbook. Very overrated. You could easily make better at home.",FbKD8A9bJHyTz00xavxFvQ,0,0,2,G2HrW9Po9W2R3Z_jxnfRAQ

Well I have to admit that the experience has been so disappointing!

At first we were very enthusiastic because the place has a really great vibe but the waiter ruined the whole experience.
I am not talking about the waiter who seated us, brought the menus and took the order who was actually very nice but the waiter who served us.

We were sitting in the main area where there is a colorful couch surrounding one side of the room. The waiter poked my wife on the back to pass the plates from behind instead of coming to our table...he was so rude, bored...he didn't say a word (Enjoy the food for example ???...). If you don't like the job, just don't do it...

We were going to order more food but we decided to pass after the third plate was brought to us by the same guy and in the same way.

I'm not a burger fan, but it left a sweet and savory taste on my palate that made me want to come back.  The paellella of the day was with duck....too salty.  I wish they had the seafood paellella, but you can only have what they made that day.  The flan has the right balance of rich creamy sweet and citrus from the ice cream and orange.

I would definitely come back to try a few more things on the menu.  The service was nice with the right amount of attentiveness.

The chistorra is the one you find in the stores in L.A., the mussels were ok but the sauce was flavorless, the croquetas ok but small and the tortilla de patatas I make it much better at home

I am from Spain and I am always looking for real spanish restaurants, this will be a little Bar in Madrid with not a lot of public due to the quality of the food.

I also experienced the same at Baazar, Jose Andres is the new type of chef that fells short in every aspect but due to the celebrity status everything works.

Tapas is not upscale is just casual over beers and wine, cheap and lot of options that you order by units.

In a restaurant like this you serve rations that are bigger than the tapas and everybody can taste.

The dishes are tiny tapas style and come out so slowly that if you go in a group, half of you will pretty much starve to death.  Food quality is hit and miss - some dishes are absolutely incredible, others surprisingly bad.  

For some reason the temperature at the restaurant is set to below freezing, which makes being there really uncomfortable.  I felt like grabbing the manager and saying: look, this is the Cosmopolitan, do you not see all these poor women sitting here half naked and shivering?  You need to shut the bloody AC off!

They have a foosball table outside which doubles up as a dining table for six.  It is a super fun idea and a super impractical one at the same time.  The seats are shaped like saddles so there is no back support- there is in fact very little bottom support - you kind of hover in mid air half the time trying not to fall off completely - much like being on a real saddle I suppose!  Best of all, the poles in the table provide a great opportunity to file a lawsuit against the establishment since you can easily stab and seriously damage the person sitting across from you if you're not careful.  

Been here twice but I don't think will be back again; at their prices it's just not worth it.  Even if I end up with a bunch of the better dishes, it's simply not a relaxing enough environment to make the experience fully enjoyable.

While most of the menu is tapas, they offer full portions of Paella.  They offer several different types, but you are limited to those that they have prepared at the moment.  It is prepared in a very large pan on the open cooking pit, so it isn't made to order unless you purchase for a group (I believe it was 8 or more).

I tried a chicken and wild mushroom paella.  It had good flavor, but was rather dry.  I was there early for dinner (5:00), so perhaps it had been on the heat too long.  The paella ran around $25.

Service was outstanding, wine list all Spanish and the best damn gin and tonic I have ever had, and I cannot stand drinking gin and tonics. 

Favorite dish (outside of the jamon di Iberico) was the Brussel Sprouts with apple, fennel, serrano served warm. I suggest going with people you know as its all shared.

My complaint - I am tired of Croquetas. They may be traditional buut no matter where I have them, I really hate them and unfortunately Jaleo is no exception.

Next we had the shrimp with sautéed garlic. I'm not a huge shrimp fan but wow. It was delicious. Is it bad that I could have eaten just a bowl of the sautéed garlic?! Lastly the spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato with alioli. My boyfriend literally said ""OMG babe what are you doing hurry up and eat this!"" He was right my taste buds were mind blown.

Also, had the empanada cod brandade with honey, interesting, probably not my favorite but the cheese had a definite cod flavor which was unexpected or if it wasn't cheese it was very cheese like in texture. Also tried the eggplant and roasted red peppers, this had a very intense roasted flavor, and was good although I would preferred this as a bruschetta. And of course had to get the Iberico ham croquettas, I could eat these all day, although my cholesterol would not be happy if I did. 

I will say that my experience this time was not as good as last time, not due to the food but as it was very loud in the dining room in part due to a loud group of tourists one table over and the loud music wafting in from the hall area. I had to yell to communicate with the people I was with. Also, the waitress missed one order I placed, but they quickly brought it over once I drew their attention to it.

The best dish of the 16 or so the group of us tried was the ""pan con tomate"" (bruschetta), which is really sad b/c it's just toasted bread with tomato & olive oil. The only other dishes I tolerated were the foie gras canalones, the mushrooms & the veal cheeks. 

Everything else was bad. The chicken fritters presented in a brown shoe was like a slap in the face. The crab and potato dish (under ""jose's way"" on the menu) was disgusting, it came served with basically with an entire jar of mayonnaise plopped on top of extremely salty crab meat. The squid was absolutely flavorless. The octopus was overly seasoned with paprika. The paella tasted like baked spaghetti. The endives didn't taste fresh.

Each one that came out lacked in presentation (the chorizo looked like sausage I could have bought at the grocery store, cut up, put on a place and set out at home), was very small (and that's coming from someone who lived in NY for years), and really, nothing we had was exceptional.  The food was alright, nothing to write home about or bother going back for and I didn't like the sangria at all. 

They also didn't have the lobster paella, which we knew we wanted to order.  They didn't have any of the paella, but said if we wanted one we could order an entire pan, which was 6 servings ($30-56 a serving).

Portions were exceedingly small, prices were high, and flavors were muted . . . not a good combination for a celebrated restaurant.
  
I love tapas and thus was excited to try lots of different plates.  On my visit I tried the King Crab with diced peppers, the Serrano Ham, the Gin & Tonic Oysters, the Patatas Bravas, the Shrimp sautéed with garlic, the Squid & Shrimp Paella, the Seared Scallops with Romesco Sauce, the Pork Sausage Stew, and the Grilled Skirt Steak with Piquillo Pepper Confit.

Most of the dishes I tried were good but not great.  That being said, The Gin & Tonic Oysters were unique and pretty good as was the Patatas Bravas.  Rather than severing traditional Patatas Bravas, Jose Andres provided his own take on the dish which consisted of potato chips covered with a romesco ketchup and aioli.  The star dish of the evening was the Grilled Skirt Steak with Piquillo Pepper Confit.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was beautifully accented by the Piquillo Pepper Confit which provided just a touch of heat and a wonderful roundness of flavor.  Too bad the portion was minuscule and gone in four bites.

723306,2011-01-06,5,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"It was the Wednesday before New Year's Eve and my family and I were looking for a place to grab a late meal, around 9:30 PM or so.  Although we didn't have a reservation anywhere and were a relatively large party (seven of us), we figured it was late enough that we wouldn't have to wait much longer than 30-45 minutes for a table.  My wife and I and our siblings have lived in Manhattan for the past several years, so we were happy to see the list of restaurants at the newly opened Cosmopolitan.  We've been to Blue Ribbon (both Bakery and Sushi), Scarpetta, and Milos in NYC, enjoyed them all, and were confident that the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan would be of similar high quality.  The first restaurant we saw when we got off the escalator that led up to the dining floor was Jaleo.  It looked great.  An open kitchen sat in the back of a bright and lively room.  The menu was interesting and the dishes sounded delicious.  Philadelphians, imagine a more casual Amada.

We settled on Jaleo and so my wife approached the hostess and asked her if she could accommodate our party.   The hostess looked at my wife and me.  It was immediately clear the calculations that were going through her head: are they good looking enough? do I like their clothes?  do I want them in my restaurant?  Just to give fellow Yelpers some context: my family and I are a reasonably good looking people by any measure and we were dressed casually but neat (ex. Business casual-jeans and no jacket for me).  The hostess glanced back into the dining room and pretended to weigh our options.  ""Sorry, I don't think we will be able to seat your party tonight.""  A large empty table was at the front of the restaurant directly behind the hostess.  ""What about that one, is that being held?"" my wife asked.  ""Oh it's not being held,"" the hostess replied, ""but that table would be too small, and also we don't have enough chairs.  And we're closing at 11PM.""  The table was set up to seat four, could obviously comfortably seat six, but believe me, in NYC, would have sat eight.  My wife pointed out additional chairs that were unused by guests at other tables.  Another hostess, trying to be more helpful, scurried off to look for a couple more chairs.  The head hostess did not move.  ""I'm sorry there are just no chairs and we're closing in an hour, I really don't think we can seat you tonight.""  We went back and forth like this for about five minutes, the hostess eying us up and down the whole time.  

After a while, we left.  I hope at some point the hostess realized that she missed an opportunity for her restaurant to make more money (a group of seven, willing to dine at a table that usually seats four, which probably couldn't be filled the rest of the night).  Actually, scratch that, I hope she stays dumb the rest of her life.  Anyway, we went to Scarpetta instead, where the food was great, the service was better, and nobody made us feel like we were a lesser class of human being.",Vb27coapWM10N1vpkKhkJg,8,4,1,wrwDeyKwT0lM7NM2hJYa1g

We ordered a paella and a carnes (Paella de pollo y setas silvestres and Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva).  Both of these items we so incredibly salty they were inedible.

The decor was very modern, which matches the entire atmosphere of the Cosmopolitan.  Even the walls have these dotted patterns on it on a white canvas.  The pillows had colorful different patterns that somehow matched together very well.

My only disappointment:  the main dish, seafood and lamb paella.  I realize that the rice is supposed to be slightly under cooked, but it also lacked in taste.

One of my only complaints is that design seems to trump comfort. While artfully designed the wooden chairs are really not very comfortable. That being said, the food was fantastic. All done tapas style, so be aware going in...small plates, but not cheap plates. We had five items off of the menu and we were only disappointed in the first one, which was goat cheese. The two wedges they presented us were laughably small, but our other items were just what you would expect from tapas size. The Serrano ham was very tasty, we then ordered the grilled hangar steak (perfectly medium rare) and grilled asparagus with romesco sause. Our final plate was more entrée size and was a stunning lobster paella. Can't remember the servers name, but she was outstanding. My wife and I are not that familiar with Spanish wines and she recommended a very tasty Tempranillo in the $45-50 dollar range.",4k7llbKSNvZTy6pKZ4pr9w,0,0,4,zJIfPhlja-26yH8OiKGd7Q

I like to try places that I don't have the opportunity to at home. Jose Andres' Jaleo is not in New York and was recently listed in the top 100 restaurants in the country. Having been to many places on the list, Jaleo was the first reservation we made for this trip. 

Jaleo is served tapas style and has many modern takes on old classics some were exceptional (the chicken wing special with sherry reduction and a blue cheese)  others fell a little flat to me (patatas bravas) and others way over salted (lobster paella). The best part of Jaleo was the table seated next to us. Terance and Alfonso, two brothers from California. We shared some food with them so we were all able to try some bites of food we otherwise wouldn't have ordered.  Boys, don't forget to get in touch when you come to NYC!

Wings with blue cheese on the rim (the best thing we ate here)

All in all, Jaleo was just very ok, and in my opinion, not top 100 restaurants in the country good. I don't think Jaleo will be on the list next time I'm in Vegas. That being said, there is another Jose Andres that I will give a try, China Pablano.

SERVICE
Pretty great service.  I can't complain here.  I was greeted by a wonderful hostess, and our waiter was delightful.

FOOD
I'm not a huge fan of tapas establishments because I never feel full after the experience + the food comes out too slow in many cases as was my experience with Jaleo.  I did enjoy the Brussel sprout inspired salad, and spinach salad, the meat items (carne asada & fried shrimp) ordered were OK, but not seasoned to my liking.

Since I've eaten at Jaleo back in my home state, I figured this Jaleo would either be of the same quality or better. I ended up feeling that the tapas back at home were better. Here's what I had:

1. Berenjenas con miel de caña al estilo Malagueño (Lightly battered eggplant Málaga style) - This was surprisingly good. It was lightly crispy and slightly sweet. The eggplant was had a great texture where it would melt in your mouth. Nicely done.

2. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamón S(errano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham) - I am not a fan of brussels sprouts so I didn't enjoy the first couple bites. However, after that, I started to really enjoy this salad and how it mixed salty, sweet, and bitter flavors together. Nicely executed. The pieces of ham were delightful. :)

3. Vieiras con salsa de romesco (Seared scallops with romesco sauce) - This was my FAVORITE of the meal. It was perfectly seared, juicy, and fresh tasting. The sauce complemented the scallops very well. Too bad you only get two pieces. :( Also, lovely presentation.

4. Codorniz a la Catalana (Grilled whole quail with apple purée and pinenuts) - Great flavor. It was juicy but the breast was slightly dry. That didn't bug me though because I imagine it's quite difficult to cook a quail (such a tiny bird!) perfectly. Nice presentation too.

5. Arroz a banda con bogavante (Literally meaning, 'rice apart from lobster,'
made with lobster and cuttlefish) - We had the 1/2 lobster. The lobster was succulent (a little sad it didn't have much meat) but the rice itself was incredibly salty. Even in small bites, it tasted very salty. I think they may have accidentally seasoned it too much, but it was difficult to finish the plate. I was also too tired to complain and the dish had such beautiful presentation.

Service: Our waiter was a mix of aloof, aggressive, and somewhat helpful. lol. He really pushed to have us order 3-5 tapas per person and specific tapas that he preferred but we really didn't need to eat that much. We also accidentally spilled water over half of the table, and I was surprised that the waiter didn't notice that we had used all our napkins to wipe up the mess before assisting. Rather, someone else (I think busboy) swooped in quickly and helped us out. The waiter then came by with two napkins, gave my husband one replacement napkin while I stared in disbelief as he walked away with the other napkin. He then turned around after about 10 seconds to give me the other napkin in his hand. I'm not quite sure what happened, but I'm thinking maybe the loud music/business of the restaurant made him tired. *shrugs* I do think the busboy provided outstanding service. He was extremely helpful and attentive. I think he came by our table to sincerely check on us more often than the waiter. We also ordered the paella with cuttlefish, not lobster, but the lobster paella arrived at our table. o_O

Atmosphere: This restaurant is VERY LOUD. Mostly from the music that is playing which in turn increases the chatter level of the patrons. The ceiling speakers are everywhere, so there isn't a quieter spot. The decor was beautiful, modern, and festive, and I enjoyed the interactive nature of the restaurant with the few open kitchens. I loved watching the chefs/cooks prepare the tapas.

Bottom line: Although I had a great time dining at the restaurant, I am disappointed by the meal because I felt that the service and taste was much better at the Jaleo in DC.",iMhVuRE1QSGBFtOtE1L-jQ,0,0,3,12meerCusI_j66WdG8gK0g

The paella with lobster was a notch above uncle bens seasoned rice, lobster was tough and the whole thing about room temp when it arrived at the table. Would avoid that one if you visit as it's one of the worst versions of paella I have ever had. Eggplant was marginal and soup my husband tried he liked. The olive oil ice cream  was nice but hard to form an opinion when it amounted to about 3 tablespoons worth. They could up the portion a bit to match their prices.

Friday night - place is hopping so we opt for the bar. Even the tables within the bar area are packed. 

Our goal - 3-4 small plates, a drink then off to the next restaurant. 

Bartender was very nice, attentive and shared her opinion on the favs. We basically sat in front of where they have the portion of the kitchen where they cook the paella over a wood pit - looked cool but how's the food ? 

Ordered a 1/2 carafe of the sangria ( $18), the Pan con tomate and added the jamon iberrica ( total cost $15 ), Chicken Croquettes ( $10 ) , the bacon wrapped dates ( $8 ) and finally the lobster Paella ($23) 

The sangria had a real earthiness to it - not what i would call the standard refreshing sangria. The bartender advised there was cinnamon and star anise in it. I liked it but it looked like a springtime drink that tasted like a fall drink. 

they brought out the croquettes first ( would've preferred the pan tomato as the starter ) - the croquettes ( 5 of them ) were very good. it was like a high end Chicken ala King in a pastry that almost looked like a pizza bite. 

The pan tomato was next with the dates. The dates ( again 5 of them ) looked like the chicken croquettes but of course, totally different in taste. I gotta admit, Firefly has them beat on the dates ! The pan tomato ( 3 slices of bread with tomato seasonings and then the ham ) simple but oh so good - the bread had a crunchy bottom yet an airy lightness above. 

The only downer - about a 10 minute delay ( possibly a little more ) for the paella. The rice was amazing - full of flavor, definitely used a lobster stock within the rice. Two lobster claws , cracked, were included - decent flavor . I was kinda hoping for some Chorizo and a few other seafood nibbles - nope. Also, was there saffron ? 

Overall, I liked the place and will definitely return to try more.

Compared to the other location their tomato bread was just meh - not enough bread, basically a soggy crust with tomatoes there were too salty. On the other hand, the omelette  apparently skipped salt altogether and was not cooked enough - the eggs inside were completely raw. Garlic shrimp was good, though and the steak wasn't bad either. And  no bread with dipping oil at this location, scandalous, ha! Service was so-so, no introduction, no recommendation,  just handed over the menu and rarely came by after that.

1192431,2012-12-03,1,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"COMPLETE DISSAPOINTMENT...RUINED MY BIRTHDAY!

I was in Las Vegas celebrating a significant birthday and was looking for a special place to have dinner. Upon reading the multiple positive reviews of this restaurant, I was completely fooled into trying it out. Had I known the quality of the food would be inferior, the customer service would be extremely poor and that I would have to fight with the manager to get a burnt paella dish off of my bill, I would have NEVER EVER visited this restaurant. I wish that I could have gone with my 2nd dining choice of TAO or for that sake, anything else would have been better than dining at Jaleo since I was very dissatisfied and they totally ruined my birthday dinner.

The night was off to a good start with our drinks. We ordered a variety of tapas including Gambas al ajillo, patatas bravas and croquetas de pollo. Though the portions were extremely small for the price of each dish, they were savory and had good flavor. My expectations were high for the grilled skirt steak (carne asada con piquillos) and the black noodle paella with shrimp (Fideua Negra on Calarmares y Gambas). I was hoping these dishes would be heartier because despite having enjoyed the other dishes I was still feeling very hungry. I was disappointed when I saw the small size of the steak that was cut into 4-5 small pieces) and at this time I started to get upset with the small portions and the price for each (just the small steak was $16). I was even more disappointed with the paella because again, not only was the portion small (and $25), the shrimp turned out to be bite sized pieces (like they'd taken a regular size shrimp and cut it into 4 smaller pieces), but the dish was also burnt! We discovered the dish was burned at the bottom because we were all so hungry from not getting our fill from the small portions of the dished we'd already eaten and were digging into the paella trying to eat as much of it as possible. We were only able to eat about half of it because the remainder of the dish was a crusty, burnt mess that was stuck to the bottom of the pan (similar to what would happen when you make rice at home and you don't add enough water and it sticks). When we brought the issue up to the waiter he said ""I do apologize, but we have some new apprentice people in the kitchen"" and asked if we wanted a new dish. We said no because it would take about a half hour to make and by this time, it was close to 11:30 pm. Plus, I was already extremely disappointed with the food and wanted to leave. I told the waiter we were upset by the quality of the food and a few minutes later a manger came to our table to ask if everything was OK. I told her (I believe her name was Andrea) that I was surprised and disappointed that a restaurant of this caliber would be serving food that was burned and of inferior quality. Rather than accepting fault for the obviously burned paella which was at the table, she chastised us and said we should have brought the issue up sooner and that we had probably enjoyed it because we got to the bottom of the pan and that's where the burnt part was. I couldn't believe she was actually making us feel guilty for eating the dish and not bringing it up sooner. She tried to make up for it by bringing me a dessert, however I was celebrating my birthday and in most restaurants, a dessert is complimentary, so I was still not satisfied. 
When our bill came I was furious to see that they were still charging us the $25 for the burned paella. I brought it up to the waiter and he was flustered and didn't know what to do. Again, Andrea came to the table and said she thought they had made good on the burned dish by bringing out the dessert. I told her that I would absolutely NOT pay for the dish that was burned and that I was extremely upset for having dined at this restaurant which I thought would be of much higher quality given its inside one of Vegas's new hotels. After practically having to fight to have them take the dish off of my bill, they did indeed remove the charge, but I was already very upset and felt we had not been given the good quality service we deserved, especially for celebrating my birthday.
Bottom line, I will NEVER EVER return to this place or recommend it to others. Prices are high, portions are very small, customer service was bad and they completely ruined my birthday dinner!",vSJaMLAE_FOZVKIHpU_SuA,1,0,1,WbKQ1klbtOtQ0_eL9HBoBQ

Though I was concerned at the beginning of the meal that the small portions would leave me hungry at the end of the night, we were practically begging our servers to stop bringing food by the time they brought out dessert.

Personal highlights for me were gin and tonic oysters on the half-shell, fried cheese stuffed dates, braised veal cheeks, and a fantastic flan for dessert.

The Tapas menu just didn't convince me to stop when paying 100+ per person and I wasn't hungry.  Very often the food doesn't meet the hype of the exotic decor and nothing makes me more irritated.  So, I look for off strip speciality spots when I have a chance. We finally stopped for lunch and had their $25 prix fixe.  Each item was Very well done!..with very clear and separate flavors in the dishes!  Well thought out flavor pairings and impeccable decor.  It was a great value, so now I'm interested in their 21 course tasting on my next visit to Vegas. The one thing I didn't like was the breadstick provided for an accompanying dish. Just didn't meet the quality of the other items. Dessert add ons were unique and above par! Service - excellent.",EN_GC97QtYi3vBZnc-t56Q,1,0,5,f2QbcqSvtx4V_nNLn7GNKg
1231983,2014-08-28,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Our last stop of Restaurant Week, and sadly not one of my favorites. If you're looking for a tapas restaurant and you're stuck on the Strip, this place might do. If not, you might look elsewhere.

One of the many definitions of ""jaleo"" is ""the act of making a noisy disturbance,"" and that's certainly the case here. This venue is LOUD. Like, you can let out a string of cuss words at the top of your lungs, and no one will even notice. (Not that my husband did that or anything ...)

That said, the service was good and the white sangria was excellent. (We tried both the red and white, and the white won out.) And the Restaurant Week menu offered nine courses, which I will rank from best to worst (not in the order we were served):

1. Pepito de Ibérico (beef slider with Ibérico bacon, caramelized onions, piquillo pepper, and aioli) 
2. Melon con Jamon Serrano (cantaloupe with Serrano ham)
3. Endibias con queso de cabra ya naranjas (endive stuffed with goat cheese, oranges, and almonds) 
4. Ajo blanco malagueño (cold almond soup with crab, grapes, raisins, and almonds) 
5. Sorbetes Caseros Con 'carquinyolis' (peach sorbet with a cookie)
6. Aceitunas Rellenas (olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo peppers) 
7. Judias con romesco y Caña de Cabra (green beans with Romesco sauce and cheese)
8. Paella del día (wood-fired rice and veggies)
9. Calamares a la Romana (fried calamari with garlic aioli)

In a nutshell, the sliders were fantastic; the paella (undercooked) and the calamari (ugh!) were forgettable; and everything else was fair to middling. Overall, everything was underseasoned--a little salt would have gone a long way.

As I said, if you really want some tapas, you can probably find something on the menu to satisfy you. But I miss the days when we could pop into Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba at the Fashion Show Mall and have some half-priced sangria and tasty meatballs. Although it is a chain restaurant, that is still my favorite tapas place, and I've even been to Barcelona. An ugly American? Maybe. But I know what I like. I guess I just didn't find it at Jaleo.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,3,bq1amFg8WvlTGkeRBueUEg

While my gf waited for her boyfriend to finish his Slot Tournament, we went upstairs to find something to eat, and since we haven't been to Jaleo and always wanted to try, we went for it. At around 6pm, we were able to get seated immediately. Our Waiter came just as soon as the Hostess seated us and offered to get drinks. He seem knowledgeable about the menu when asked, and offered great options on what we needed to get to compliment our dishes.

Pulpo A Feira Maestro Alfonso, boiled Octopus w/pee wee potatoes sprinkled with Spanish Paprika and Olive oil alone was much too salty, however, when eating with Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco, toasted ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato, it balanced out salt with the acidity of the tomatoes perfectly. 

Aceitunas Rellenas Y Aceitunas 'Ferrán Adrià' , Olive stuffed Anchovies and liquid olives was by far my favorite tapas, EVER. I absolutely loved every single bite of this dish. 

Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin', Rice w/duck confit, foie cream & PX Reduction was just so so. The rice was cooked well, but bland as well as duck. The Foie cream was on a sweet side and lack that awesome livery, minerally taste of foie I've grown to love.

The waiter forgot to put in some other appetizers and our Rossejat, traditional paella of fried pasta with fresh squid and shrimp w/a dallop of garlic aioli sauce, so we had to wait about 15 minutes for this dish but it was so delicious! Well worth the wait. I know that some patrons have had bad experience with the rice in the Paella not being thoroughly cooked, this dish is the best solution to that problem! Traditionally, paella can take up to 45 minutes, if you don't want to wait that long, opt for this dish. It has all the great tastes of Paella but less the time. I especially loved the fishiness of this dish as well as the creaminess of the aioli. So damn delicious!",-mXobpJ3z3X6nMriCklbog,3,4,5,lGIic4U6dzYh20ugxBw4zg

Our VIP host was able to book us a six person table-top amidst a booked and busy Saturday night.  She introduced us to the Executive chef (not Jose Andres) and asked that he present his recommended plates / menu for the evening.

Before I dive into the food, I'll speak of the restaurant itself.  Jaleo is located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel.  It's a restaurant that faces and opens up to Cosmo's restaurant collection (including Scarpetta, STK, Milos, D.O.C.G., etc.).  The energy on the third floor is always buzzing with a plethora of night-goers preparing for a long evening.  The energy at Jaleo is no different.  In fact, you are immersed with the crowd given that half of the restaurant is completely open.  I personally loved the high energy.  However, go elsewhere if you are looking for an intimate dinner.

The food itself... not memorable.  In fact, I don't recall any of the names of the items we had. While the presentation of the dishes were creative and beautiful in design, the flavors and taste were nothing out of the ordinary.  Given the prices, I expected much more.  I wanted to be wowed with big bold flavors and an experience much different than your normal tapas affair.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

Drinks: My husband ordered ""The Sun Also Rises"" and I ordered a glass of Tempranillo. Both were wonderful.

Food: We shared 5 plates... the Cristal bread was crispy and lightly spread with tomato and alioli... it was nice that it stayed crispy for the 20/25 minutes it was on our table and didn't get soft/mushy. There Patatas Bravas had a cute presentation with the alioli on each tiny potato on a bed of the tomato sauce. The sausage stuffed squid took a while (maybe 25 minutes) but it was delicious... perfectly cooked soft squid like a pillow and just the right seasoning in the sausage. The squid and hangar steak were our favorites. The steak we got cooked medium rare (I'm still transitioning him away from well done red meat) and it was delicious. It had just a tiny amount if blue cheese as well which I don't think is listed on the menu (but our server mentioned it). We were divided on the peppers stuffed with goat cheese and mushrooms... I wasn't a huge fan, but my husband liked it. 

My only warning sounds so dumb, but IT'S TAPAS!! While we were there a man started complaining about the price and size of the dishes. If you don't know what tapas is, the easiest way to explain is appetizers for dinner... you order 2-3 things per person, we typically do 4-5 for the two of us.

Delicious.  Really authentic light and crispy toast with a fresh tomato paste and a slice of thin manchego cheese.  Just wish we could have gotten more for the price.

CROQUETAS DE POLLO $12
My favorite.  Delicious croquetas with chicken.  They even came in a little shoe.  Strange, but definitely interesting.  Only 5 in an order.

CALAMARES A LA ROMANA $12
Eeek.  Well this popped my food-sending-back cherry.  As a server, I have never sent back food.  But even my boyfriend couldn't eat this and we both love calamari.  It was extremely chewy/rubbery which means it was overcooked.

BUNUELOS DE BACALAO $14
Yum!! I couldn't get enough of this.  I didn't really know what to expect when ordering this so I was surprised when it came out.  It is like little fried balls of creamy codfish.  The honey aioli was so good.  Very rich flavor.

PAPAS ARRUGAS $8
How can you go wrong with potatoes? Yum.

CARNE ASADA CON PIQUILLOS JULIAN DE LODOSA $18
So good.  Cooked perfectly.

MINI PEPITO DE IBERICO $8
I thought my boyfriend was going to die happily once he bit into this.  His favorite part of the meal.

We also ordered a sangria ($12) and a cocktail ($16).  I'm going against the odds and saying I did not like the sangria.  I felt like I was back in high school and had to plug my nose, down this, and then chase it with my water.  I don't remember which cocktail my boyfriend ordered, but when it came out I was very confused.  It literally looked like a SHOT.  Not a cocktail, but a shot.  There must have been 2-4 oz at MOST.  

The service was okay.  We had a really hard time finding our server to tell her about the calamari/get our check.  She took it off our bill without a problem, which we appreciated.

So all in all: I would come back.  But maybe on a half full stomach.  The portions are way smaller than tapas.  Some are bite sized.  And it is extremely overpriced.  Our bill was $120ish and we were still hungry.  Not a good feeling to pay this much and leave hungry.

 To start we ordered the pan de cristal con tomate fresco which is nothing more than crispy bread with fresh tomato. Very simple but very good, although 12.00 seems a little steep for something you would consider chips and salsa....I know, I know..""you're on the strip.""

We ordered the lunch special, bocata del dia, a three course meal for 26.00 it came with ensalada verde, gazpacho de remolacha with goat cheese and of course the star of it all...chicken and mushroom paella!
Cooked on their real wood fire pit the way paellas should be cooked. Texture and flavor was very good, I just wished it had more meat variety like shrimp, calamari and chorizo the way I'm used to paellas and yes the price would be higher but it would be be better than making a paella with half the ingredients just so they can call it a deal.
 Service was great. The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu, he was able to describe every single item and ingredient, to the grains of salt that were used, so well I could see and taste everything way before it got to my table.

Ask for a booth. A little more intimate...tables were tight and experience may have been different. 

The service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and made a lot of suggestions. Had all of us not been familiar with Spanish food, it may have been overwhelming. 

We all ordered tapas to share and then a plate of Paella. The Paella was very very good, BUT...for what we were charged for some really great rice on a dish to share, was a bit out of my comfort zone. 

We first ordered White Sangria...definitely more orange juice than wine, but in any event it was refreshing. I would go with the red Sangria instead. 

All of our tapas were excellent. We had the pan con tomate which was crispy and tasty. The croquetas de pollo which were so delish, we ended up ordering two plates. Papas bravas were excellent and the winner for me was the gazpacho! Chilled and a little spicy. The cheese and apple butter was underwhelming. It was very good, but there were only 2 small pieces of cheese on the plate with the paste. We shared a flan for dessert which was served with a mandarin orange sorbet. The flan was a little looser than I'm used to but it was so so good!

As a whole, great tapas restaurant for the experience. The food was excellent, atmosphere was loud and energetic, and the service was very good. Our bill for the four of us was $199. Hey it's Vegas baby, what do you want?",U_ru9s0j4MOvHE5WTl0PrQ,0,0,4,jDfpOBpp3qTzrWKSp4QeSQ

I came here with a colleague when we were in town for business and we split 5 dishes which were unique and delicious! Two dishes which were prepared in a really unique way were the brussel sprouts and the beet salad. I've never had brussel sprouts where the leaves were taken off and presented like a salad. In the beet salad there was also an assortment of cubed beets and shaved beets. 

This place was a bit pricey but what do you expect at a nice hotel in Vegas? Glad that I wasn't personally paying, but if I were back at the Cosmo for a personal trip I'd totally go here again.

1362606,2010-12-22,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"the mister and me SO wanted to love this place. after all, it was our BIG NIGHT OUT, meaning it was the first time EVER that we were sans canine responsibilities, having left our assorted furry posse members back in not so sunny los angeles. 

BUT, this was just an okay experience. dishes ranged in both effectiveness and price, but what unified them was the teensy portions. i understand that tapas means 'small plates', but the price-to-portion ratio needs to be improved (going to Pinks an hour after leaving jaleo--not a good sign--but that's another review). 

so here's what we ordered and how it was: 

the mister--the lobster salad for $18.00. came with 4 claws of lobster meat on escarole with shaved grapefruit slices. according to the mister, the lobster was perfection, but the escarole was super salty. this i verified--these greens were tragically oversalted. i informed the waiter of this, but he did not offer to rectify the situation. 

the mister--chorizo wrapped in potato for $8.00. now the mister really liked this, though he thought it needed more potato. each chorizo was wrapped in a super thin potato chip. 

me--sliced apple and fennel salad with sherry vinaigrette and walnuts (minus the manchego cheese) for $9.00. perfection! a burst of starry eyed delight. impossibly fine slivers of fennel and apple. but SUCH a wee portion! seriously, i doubt if there was more than a cup of finely slivered veggies in there! 

me--warmed brussels sprout salad with diced apricots for $9.00. it was okay, but again, a super small portion. and again--oversalted. oversalted and not so special. i've made more unique brussels sprouts salads at home. 

service was okay. they had some kitchen mix ups but hey, it was day four for the restaurant.",4Te5XClBnYg0MRiEjeSm8g,1,0,3,x659h7MRcBySE-Aa47Bg8w
1364320,2013-03-11,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"This is one of the best places in Vegas.  I've been to way too many big famous chefs' restaurants, and MOST of them were terrible: under deliver, and over priced.  I don't mind spending more, but it must be worthy the price.  I think Jaleo is so far the BEST restaurant in Vegas when it comes to food and drinks.  Service is another story.  But anyway, for the food, I can give in a little for the service.

1st of all, we ordered ""Jose's gin and tonic"".  Because it was labeled ""It's the best gin and tonic you will ever have..."" on the menu.  Personally, I HATE gin and tonic, but since 'it's the BEST"", I had to try it.  
They literary ""MIX"" drinks.  They used long skinny tweezers, carefully pick and put the ingredients in the glass, followed by a 2"" diameter clear ice ball (perfectly made ice ball, with no bobble and all clear, trust me, it's NOT easy to make), then they added gin and tonic. 1st sip was ""WOW, it's refreshing!""  There was no strong nasty gin taste to it, you could taste the gin, just not the overwhelming nasty one.  $16

Usually, most Vegas restaurants take average 15-30 mins to bring food to the table.  But this place was impressively FAST!  The 1st dish was brought to the table within 5 mins, then within 10 mins after the 1st dish, we received all 6 plates of food!  WOW!!!!!

The cod empanadas was AMAZING!  Same technique and concept as the Philly cheese steak from Bazaar in SLS Beverly Hills.  It was light and airy, but with a nice concentrated cod favor, not too strong, it was perfect!  And it was well priced at $10.  This is a MUST-TRY.

The grill skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit was my favorite!  Perfectly cooked steak, evenly sliced, the pepper was well seasoned.  Actually the pepper taste EXACTLY the same as the Spanish pepper from Rivera downtown LA.  

Paellas were good, touch too salty for my taste.  We ordered both the rabbit one and the lobster one.  The rabbit was slightly dry and overcooked, but over all, not bad.  The lobster was EVERY FRESH and PERFECTLY cooked through out!  And you actually get the whole entire lobster!  Great price!  

Now I'm really looking forward for my chef's table at Jaleo Washington DC.

Most famous chefs opened one restaurant after another, they stopped caring about the food.  I think Jose Andres is the next Wolfgang Puck.  (I've been to a few Wolfgang restaurants, most of them were VERY disappointing: the food was not even good, slow and bad service, the drinks were not special at all, and the prices were way too high for the quality, expect WP24, but it's still a little over priced)   Just hope that all Jose's restaurants will continuing stay consistent.",HCUmbDYVDZkzV1wyOOToLQ,0,0,5,NNKHQEyHGn3Rfvld-qaxrg

The tapas were all very tasty. Standouts were the endive and of course the jamon iberico. The paella was also very good.

The service was a bit slow but I think that was on purpose to set a relaxing atmosphere to just talk and drink. Most of the tapas were good except the one with blue cheese on grilled chicken.

Great vibe here, very open and airy, no blaring music, the focus is on the food, the drinks, and the company you keep, which was perfect. After getting some guidance on the extensive drink menu, we realized we should probably eat something, so we ordered a couple of the tapas items. The suggestions on the food menu weren't as helpful, she pretty much just suggested the most expensive item in each category. 

The plates are fairly expensive, but you're paying Strip prices at the Cosmo, so don't expect any major discounts. We had the patatas bravas, which was better than expected, and the spicy chorizo wrapped in patatas, which was more like a potato chip. They had some tapas standards, and some really interesting dishes...Would be nice to come back when we need more than 2-3 dishes. Many of the specialty dishes seem to be basic comfort foods ""reimagined"" in a more refined way, which is a foodie trend right now. 

Two drinks and two of the lower cost dishes ended up being $50 with tax & tip. That was the only shock, until I remembered where I was. Now that I know what I'm in for, I'll definitely be back. This is a wonderful, low-key restaurant with good food, good drinks, and good service.

While not being the biggest gin fan, I couldn't tell that there was any gin in the drink. It was absolutely delicious and very refreshing. The bartender was even nice enough to go over the different Fever Tree tonics they use for the other versions, and how they pair them with the spice notes of the gins. We were very impressed.

I was torn but docked a star per the price of $20/glass. We would have been happy to stay there and try their other three versions, but the price is sooo high.

While all of these things make Vegas what it is today- the best part of my recent trip was dinner at Jaleo.

On a friend's recommendation, I made a reservation before I got to Vegas just to ensure we could get in.  Getting in didn't seem to be the problem on this Tuesday night as we went early- but by the time we left- every table was filled.  Also know that Jaleo is located in the Cosmopolitan hotel at the top of the bank of elevators.  If you come in on the cab side- you will have to walk all the way through the casino and then head upstairs.

We were seated in some funky clear acrylic chairs that had us wondering all night if our ""butts looked big in this?""  Kidding . . .but those are some funny chairs!

Our server was great making plenty of suggestions and finding me a Spanish wine that would equal my beloved Cab.  They do the ipad thing with their drink selections listed on it- but for this girl- sometimes just asking is the best way.

And then-""Ta-da"" . . . . THE FOOD!  Our server suggested 6 or so things to share but there were so many things to try that we ended up ordering 8.  Not to worry, there wasn't a smidge of anything left on our table.  In no particular order we had:
-Gin and Tonic oysters
-Chicken Fritters served in a shoe.  A SHOE!!
-White asparagus with thyme served in a sardine can
-Lobster salad- very unexpected and fresh
-Cauliflower with dates and olives- a god must have created this mixture it was so good
-Scallops in a red sauce
-Steamed Mussels 
-Grilled chicken

All were amazing, although I probably would not order the chicken again as it just couldn't stand up to the amazing combination of flavors of the other dishes.

And that shoe that the chicken fritters come in was a funny story.  I saw the busser walking around with a shoe on his tray and asked just what was up with that.  He said the chef liked that brand of shoe and that he chose to serve food in it.  As simple as that , and even though neither my friend or l were eating fried or breaded food, we had an order of those darn fritters!

Went to Jaleo on Aug 25/2014 during the Las Vegas Restaurant week (party of 3) and was able to enjoy the following 9 course meal for only $50.14! A great deal all made better by our amazing server Mario L who was super attentive to my wife's food allergies and double checked everything to make sure we were fine. Atmosphere was great, on the louder side but the Spanish guitar playing in the background went perfect with the flavors and aromas of the night.

I have reviewed each menu item briefly below, but the overall experience was amazing, transported us to our various Tapas experiences throughout Spain in Seville, Marbella, Madrid, Barcelona and Ibiza.

FOOD:
1. Aceitunas Rellenas - Olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo:
These where great, very different, I usually don't like anchovies that much but you couldn't even taste them, there was an orange paste on the olives.

2. Melon con Jamon - Serrano Cantaloupe with Serrano ham:
This was amazing, thinly shaved melon with freshly cut Serrano toped with olive oil and edible flowers. Perfect!

3. Calamares a la Romana - Fried fresh calamari with garlic alioli:
I am not too crazy about friend calamari but these were probably one of the best/freshest ones I have had outside of spain/Portugal/Italy/or anywhere surrounded by sea!

4. Endibias con queso de cabra ya naranjas - Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds:
Simple and flavorful, they literally pop in your mouth as the crunchiness of the endives meets the sweetness of the orange and the creaminess of the goat cheese.

5. Ajo blanco malagueño - Malaga-style chilled almond soup with crab, grapes, raisins and almonds:
This was ridiculously good! 10/10 never tasted anything quite like it, it was the consistency of a more liquid hummus but with a light almond flavor, the resins/grapes and the crab balanced the whole  dish into an exceptional culinary experience that I didn't know was possible by having what is basically a cold soup!!

6. Judias con romesco y Caña de Cabra - Green beans with romesco and Caña de Cabra cheese:
Lightly grilled or pan friend French beans with goat cheese, excellent and again, something different from what you normally expect from French beans

7. Pepito de Ibérico - Mini burger with Ibérico bacon, caramelized onion, piquillos and alioli:
This was tasty and rich. Loved the smokiness of the Iberico with the juiciness of the beef and the roasted pepper.

8. Paella del día - The best-known dish in Spanish cuisine, made in our open-fire, wood-burning :
10/10! Again, Absurdly good! This was a vegetable Paella and it was hands down one of the best executions of a paellas I have ever  had! The rice, the sauce and the consistency of all the ingredients were perfect. Made me REALLY curious about how good their seafood paellas can be! 

9. Sorbetes Caseros Con 'carquinyolis'- House-made sorbet with a traditional Catalan crisp:
Redcurrant sorbet, a perfect end to a wonderful meal, had a hint of mint/basil, even though there was no mint or Basil used in it! Which apparently what you get when you have incredibly fresh redcurrants!

This was a 9 courses meal but the ingredients are so fresh and the preparation is so great that we didn't feel full or uncomfortable.

DRINKS:
I tasted 2 different Gin and Tonics, the Sangria and a glass of wine.

Growing up in UK and visiting Spain many, many times in my life, I consider myself a bit of a ""Gin Tonic"" connoisseur (as its called in Spain). In fact I would love to meet Jose Andres over some Gin Tonics and discuss how to perfect this drinks which happens to be my favorite.  Come on guys, you can make it happen!!!

From the Ice (a perfectly clear sphere, which is hard to make and is apparently shipped in from California!) to the choice of Tonic , the herbs and spices and the Gin itself,  both the Jose's and the Citrico Gin Tonics where Great. 

Lets put it this way, this isn't your grandma's Gin & Tonic and it's a must try if you visit Jaleo.

We started with the brochette, very good. Then the lobster salad, I tore it up, we also had the garlic shrimp which in my opinion was the best, it was in this tomato-ey garlic sauce that makes my mouth water just thinking about it, to die for.

Alright, now that I've put that disclaimer out there, onward with my review.

This place is in the uber-trendy Cosmopolitan Hotel.  It's tapas-style, Spanish fare.  The menu is pretty large and diverse - there's a little something for everybody, including cheeses, hams, soups, salads, various types of meat, vegetarian offerings, paella, you get the picture.  You should be able to find something you'll like.

We (my husband and I) started out with a beet salad, liquid olives, and chorizo sausages wrapped in sliced potato.  Not sure if the liquid olives are authentic Spanish or more of a gimmick, but interesting, nonetheless.  Beet salad was pretty standard, but good, and the potato-wrapped chorizo sausages were very good.  Next we decided to order the octopus and something that was advertised as a pork sausage stew.  This was my first time trying octopus, and I enjoyed it well enough.  The pork sausage stew was really just pork meatballs with sauteed mushrooms and pearl onions - I wouldn't call it a ""stew.""  It would have been quite tasty, actually, but the meatballs were WAY oversalted.  We had wine with our meal, but the cocktails looked quite good.

The atmosphere of this place was okay, but there was something about it that made me feel like I was at a restaurant in a mall.  Maybe it's the way the front of the place is wide open to the ""commons"" area outside, I don't know.  Other than that, it's lively and bustling inside, just as you would expect a tapas-style restaurant to be.  The service was okay.  Our server was attentive, but she didn't seem to happy to be there.  Every time she came over, she plastered on the fakest smile you can imagine (think the really angry girl from the movie ""Waiting"").  At one point, she came over, turned her back on us to whisper something to the busser at the table next to us, who then proceeded to come and wipe our table down.  I really don't know what she said - at best it came off kind of rude, at worst it felt like it was something negative about what pigs we were.  I also overheard some other servers right behind us bitching about other customers.  Might want to save that gossip for behind the kitchen door!

All in all, decent food, decent atmosphere, bizarre experience with the waitstaff.  I'd go back if someone I was with really wanted to go.",DF3o9tSyOqPT_4wZMY3Xwg,1,0,3,iH3FcZ4Xchx3s7fgIINaYg

My friend and I reserved a table at Jaleo for lunch on our first full day of vacation in Vegas last summer. 

I recommended Jaleo because it is where I came with my previous boyfriend on our Vegas trip in 2016 (we ate at é by Jose Andres in the back). I couldn't forget those delicious gin and tonics, and since it was another restaurant of Andres', I figured the food would be worth trying.

It was! We each started the meal with a different gin and tonic, I the Heirba, my friend the Cirtico. These drinks are beautiful, I tell you! Their elements are delicately folded on a slice of citrus, which floats on the gin and ice; you are given the individual bottles of tonic to adjust the ratio as you please. 

We opted for the tasting menu, which included three courses of your choosing (from a specific menu). I chose the first course that included apples, cheese, and walnuts, and my friend chose the endives. I chose the scallop for the second course, and my friend chose the spinach and pine nuts. I chose the salmon for the third course, and my friend chose the garlic shrimp. We split all of our items, and for our second drink, I ordered the drink that contains gin and egg white, and my friend ordered the spicy margarita.

The first course items were well-balanced, both salty and a bit sweet, with a good amount of crunch. I would recommend either.

I loved the chewiness of the scallop, and the blend of flavors from the sauces! 

The spinach and pine nuts were good, but forgettable. In fact, I can't remember anything I liked about them. Bitter, crunchy, fresh? Maybe.

The salmon was good enough on its own. It really didn't need sauce or vegetables to compliment it. It was well-cooked.

The garlic shrimp were the most surprising to me, because I'm really just not a fan of shrimp. Luckily for me, this shrimp was deveined and doused in yummy spices. You don't get much shrimp for the price, but at least they give you some bread with it..? I dipped the bread in the shrimp juices...pretty good.

The closing drinks were great, too. I love drinks with egg white, and their gin is some of the best! My friend loved her spicy margarita! Spicy and sour seemed to be the theme of this m",m3VudXLzVbgMw1BWy7q4Ug,3,3,4,QT6RbdogEDmVHn8AQyGa9Q

I had one of their recommended gin and tonics and while it was very good (Hendricks and fever tree tonic) it was way, way over priced. 

We decided to do the Jaleo 55 dollar tapa tasting. It came with 11 courses of their best tapas, including paella and dessert. There was not a single tapa that was a disappointment. We were especially impressed by the gazpacho, tuna tartare, and the cod croquettes. The vegetable paella was also phenomenal and came with a touch of aioli, which capped off the dish.

The food itself was too salty.  We started with a watermelon salad, usually that is somewhat refreshing, but it didn't have that kick to it.  Then I had the salmon cone, that was too oily for me.  The patatas bravas, was out first very salty dish.  Then came the warm oyster with caviar.  They had a slice of bacon in there, which again, made it salty.  I'm sure that dish would be better without the bacon.  The shrimp with garlic sauce also was very salty and the shrimp wasn't to my standards.

The espinaca a la catalana (catalan style spinach) was way too salty. 
The calamari a lo peloya were too fishy. I love calamari, even had it raw in the past in other places.  this was cooked but still too fishy smelling and tasting.  The patatas bravas were good. 

We ordered a Porrón of the one that had beer, cherry liqueur, chamomile and lemon. It sounded delicious but was not that good. Too sweet and left a tart feeling in your mouth. 

My friend ordered the lamb tapas. We thought they forgot about them because we had finished all of our 10 tapas we ordered and they still did not show up. 
They finally appeared and i will be honest, they were really delicious. So tender and not gamey at all. I usually dont like lamb or goat for the gamey taste but they were the best!

1555366,2014-06-24,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Came here over EDC weekend. Love Jaleo's open kitchen where you can see the Chefs cooking the paella! Other reviews mentioned the poor service but our waitress was great! They change their menu occasionally so the brussel sprouts that everyone raves about is no longer available! The waitress also recommended 3-4 tapas for each + the large Paella dish BUT 2 each + paella was sufficient! 

Onto the good stuff: 

*Sangria: Of course we would order cocktails off an iPad, fancy haha. Loved the Sangria here. Not sure what was in it but the added sprig of mint made it even more refreshing. Order a Carafe for ~3 glasses. 

*Pan de cristal con tomate fresca (Half a loaf of toasted, uniquely crispy and ethereal bread brushed with fresh tomato): aka Tomato Bread. Delicious! Supposedly the bread is imported.It's a great starter! 

*Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota (Made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain): So, the Chef chooses 2 of the 5 paellas to make each day. On this day, there was this one + the Rabbit one (Paella valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' A true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans). It says allow for ""45 minute wait"" because you'll be served when it's ready. They continuously make batches. Once each batch is done, they ring a cast iron bell and yell out ""Paella""! I've never been to Spain so I don't really have anything to compare it to. However, I like that the rice was ""crispy"". A little on the oilier side but it is pork. Meat was tough though. 

* Gambas al ajillo (The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic): JUST DO IT. Sauteed with garlic but there's a rich & warm tomato-like ""sauce"" on it which MADE this dish. So good. 

*Chorizo ibérico de bellota Fermín (A dry-cured chorizo made with ibérico meat): eh, skip. tasted like a dry hot dog and it was on a bed of some kind of corn/polenta looking thing but didn't help 

*Caña de cabra con higos (Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam: I don't like stinky cheese but something about this paired with raisin walnut bread & fig jam made this a winner! 

*San simón con garapiñado de frutos secos (Galicia) A smoked cow's milk cheese paired with house-made nut brittle: Loved this one because of how mild it was. It's a harder cheese but not like parmesan-hard. The nut brittle was tasty s well. 

*Manzana con hinojo y queso manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing): This was a nice palate cleanser. Super refreshing with the crispy granny smith apples + fennel.

*Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos (Sautéed cauliflower with dates and olives): Waitress said this is a hit or miss dish but we LOVED this. Sweetness from the dates. Tang from the Olives. Yum.",GmQR50bIII7gDNRYEgfXfA,4,1,4,AiNE6FIVVI4um4niQMGgIA

Salmon tartare & trout roe cone - good but the cone was overly greasy. I like fried food, and for some reason this felt heavy, like it wasn't properly drained out of the fryer.

Bacon wrapped dates - again, a potentially great taste overwhelmed by the heavy deep fried grease.

Shrimp & garlic sauce - good

Endive w oranges, feta & almonds - highly recommended!

Skirt steak - my favorite!

Paella - they make fresh batches throughout the night, so whichever kind they prepare at the time is what can be ordered, minimum 3 people, we had the chicken & mushroom - it was good but not impressive

Sautéed spinach - cant go wrong

Fresh oysters - I'm not a fan of them but everyone else at the table thought they were fantastic

Monkfish - sliced thin, like a tartare but cooked, again not a fan of monkfish but everyone else liked it

So imagine my surprise when I notice the hotel I'm staying at in Las Vegas has a Jaleo. Jackpot! But not so much...

We were able to walk in around 8ish on a Tuesday night and get a table for four. We were seated promptly and our waiter was over fairly quickly to take our drink orders. I know some people might find the cocktail menu on an iPad to be cool - but to me, it's just annoying. Why can't I see a list of drinks before the waiter gets there? Instead, we all have to huddle around the screen he's holding up and click around. I get that we're in the ""digital age"" - but occasionally, you might want to take practicality into consideration. 

We opted for a carafe of sangria to start. This was my first disappointment. It didn't resemble the sangria I used to love. It was sweet, but it also had some type of green leafy thing in it (mint maybe?) - and it just took away from the sangria I used to love. 

Next came the task of ordering food. Many at the table wanted paella, but there were only two types available on the menu that they said we could order for a table of four. So even though we saw many delicious choices, we were told only two were available - not the service I'm used to. In addition, there were a handful of tapas that they were out of already. 

The waiter kept pushing and trying to steer us the tasting menus (a whooping $55+ per person). When I said we would just make some individual choices, he pushed again saying we should get items to share (the plates are tiny enough - can we just pick what we want first). He also kept saying it was wrong to make individual choices because they come out at all different times, so one person could have food and another couldn't (something I'm well aware of, as was my party). He kept talking at us to the point we felt overwhelmed. Our party was getting frustrated and contemplated walking out (after paying for the sangria). I convinced everyone to just ignore him and order what we wanted. 

Finally, we got our orders in and the food started coming out. Just about everything I ordered was salty or bland. The bacon-wrapped dates were the best (for me), but deep fried and greasy, so they were a bit rough on the stomach. The others liked their choices (mostly), and no one cared that the food rolled out in waves.

The waiter did check on us a lot, so we were never without drinks or water. And the wait staff was quick to take away empty plates and replace silverware and sharing plates, so that was good. Still, we skipped dessert because we just wanted to get out of there. 

I hope the Las Vegas location isn't an indication of the Jaleo's back in the DC-area - otherwise, I may be done for good.",r8SEfPezm9YlhdBBWdGDPg,1,0,2,uzvdnlNwCWNY_MdkiKY6lg

Jaleo is one of my favorite dining spots in Vegas. Let me begin with a disclaimer: while they seem to be famous for their paella, but i found them sorely disappointing. the rice was not cooked to the right consistency and lacked that saffron / other spices depth that I seek.
however, everything else was pretty spot on. I'm going off of memory, but of my 2 visits here, i've tried various items such as the grilled lamb ribs (heaven on a bone, my favorite - but apparently gone from the menu on my second visit), endives with goat cheese and fruity stuff (very refreshingly light, yet still flavorful), the bacon wrapped dates (deliciously balanced - coming from somebody who doesn't like fruit in my entrees), grilled steak on top of a red pepper (perfectly prepared and bursting with skirt steakiness), the chicken croquettes (served in a shoe, deliciously fatty richness in fried breading), the taco cones (excellent!), and lots of other things that vegas nights has long since wiped from my memory.

Do not miss:
- Salchichon (incredible flavor and mouthfeel as that luscious oil seeps out of the 4-year aged meat and onto your tongue, then you'll cleanse your palette for your next bite with the dry and satisfying crunch of homemade bread sticks)
- Liquid olives (I will not ruin the surprise, but remember- there's nothing like your first time. Order this and expect your world to expand)
- Mahon con amendras (tiny plate to be savored bite by bite- take your time with this lovely earthy salty cheese and crunchy salty almonds)
- Nectarines with anchovies (this and the octopus were my favorites. A completely unexpected combination and after this dish I would have put the fate of my soul into the hands of these chefs. Each bite of juicy fruity nectarine with salty anchovy grew into a complex taste experience of fresh fruitiness, salty sea and fish, and honey stone fruit flavor. Do not miss this dish when available)
- Endive with goat cheese, oranges and almonds (bright, fresh, sweet and earthy- a deliciously crispy and fresh interlude between meatier dishes) 
- Shaved Fennel and apple salad with walnuts and sherry vinegar (clean flavors- wonderful fresh ingredients presented simply to showcase their flavors and textures)
- Grilled pulpo (octopus) (make each bite count- a chunk of smoky salty octopus + a slice of tender and juicy heirloom tomato, all swirled in the frothy and flavorful onion cream and you will probably have a Big O right at your table)
- Carne asada (served over red pepper- one of the best steak dishes we've ever ever had)
- house made sorbet (ours was blueberry with grapes- a surprisingly delightful combination and the sorbet was complex and nuanced - not overly blueberry)
Plus our wines were excellent, but it was the food that had us sharing bites, exclaiming with delight, laughing out loud in joyous surprise, and sitting in rapturous silence as flavors combined and developed and grew into their full expressions in our mouths.

The staff was very attentive from the hostess stand to the waiter that walked that fine line of enough attention to take care of you but not to annoy.  I loved the tables and great colors within the place, the unique aspect that I liked was that despite the tables being close together it's set up to still be able to not have to listen to conversation at nearby tables.

I normally don't get the paella since I'm impatient but I was pleasantly surprised that they already had the Arroz Mediterraneo already prepared.  Since I was in a good mood I even ordered the Rossejat(traditional paella with shrimp) both were very delicious and just filling without being heavy.  Given my seafood mood I added an order of Gambas con gabardina(beer battered shrimp with capers mayonnaise) which was great to top it all off.  

As usual I didn't try any of the alcoholic drinks but I did finish off with a nice Chamomile tea from loose leaf and even came with a timer for the strength you desire.",LjDSVQGLLiOO7NCfvmV_MQ,3,2,5,oo91HqJvcqXnEH6UHvJTIA

Located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan hotel you'll find the reason not to leave~ Jaleo.   My wonderful friend chose this Jose Andres restaurant to celebrate.  Phenomenal choice!

We received excellent service from Nelson from the get go.  He was full of compliments, attentiveness and professionalism.  It doesn't hurt when you're sitting in the lovely decorated dining room watching the magic happen in the open kitchen.  They really give you a complete experience.  

Spanish tapas and paella were on our radar for the evening.  If I fully describe all of the dishes we tried, it would be a novel.  I'm going to keep it short and sweet.  The Bacon Wrapped Dates had a beautiful blend of flavors with the apple-mustard sauce. The Vieiras con piniones are fresh scallops seared to perfection. Gambas al ajillo sauced up the plump shrimp which I highly recommend.  The medium rare Carne Piquillo was tender in the pepper confit. Paella Iberico was filled with mushrooms and short rib that left me speechless... until now.  Best paella ever. 

Of course since it was a celebration dinner we split the Pastel de cafe.  Wowed again.  This was a light and airy mousse covered with a hazelnut layer.  I was happy it wasn't a heavy chocolate dessert.  It was enough for us to share and get our sugar fix for the night.

I even said it like that... I just get overly excited about food and my Jose! Hehe.. yes.. it is like that now.. PLUS.. I am a bigger sucker for Spanish tapas.. any experience that allows me to nibble and share different small meals and something modern, I will be ALL OVER IT.

Jaleo is located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and it is a restaurant where it allows you to enjoy a variety of small plates, enjoy authentic paellas, superb sangria, and a wide selection of the finest Spanish cheeses, wines, and Sherries, all in a lively, casual atmosphere. It is definitely more of a casual environment, if you don't wear anything fancy, you don't feel out of place at all which is nice for tourists. 

Service- Good and efficient. Changes your plate after a few meals which I like when waiters do on their own. 

Now lets talk about the food:

Sangria- We ordered the red sangria of course full of flavor but DAYAM that stuff is strong. I don't know if they don't add enough ice or they add a ton of wine but yea.. REALLY strong. I could hold my liquour and I was already pretty buzzed after 2 drinks..

Pan con tomate with jamón Serrano Fermín- Basically a nice rustic bread with a spread of tomato sauce and a slice of ham on top. So basic, so simple, but oh so good! I would recommend you get the one with manchego cheese if you love your cheese. The pair with the saltiness of the cheese is delish!

Croquetas de pollo- Traditional chicken fritters.. this was okay. Basically taste like chicken croquettes, same fried batter as the croquettes. Nothing special or out of this world. 

Chistorra envuelta en patata frita- Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato. This is a must get at Jaleo. It is so cute! Its like little mini chorizos wrapped around by a potato chip and served on a tooth pick. I love the saltiness of the tiny chorizo and the crunchiness of the potato. Together is great!

Empanadillas de brandada de bacalao- 'Empanada' of cod brandade with honey, delicious delicious delicious. Careful when you eat this cause its all gooey brandade inside.  For some reason I thought it was be actual fish pieces inside but it is basically liquid fish. Sounds weird but its good!

Gambas al ajillo- The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic. Deliciously garlicky perfectly cooked shrimp!

Butifarra casera con mongetes 'Daniel Patrick Moynihan'- Homemade grilled pork sausage with sautéed white beans. Who doesn't like sausage with beans.. definitely homey and rustic taste. 

Paella de pollo y lobster- Lobster paella is super salty. I was really disappointed by this dish. It was just regular paella, hardly any lobster meat, and just super salty!!

Flan al estilo tradicional de mamá Marisa con espuma de crema catalana- A classic Spanish custard with 'espuma' of Catalan cream and oranges. Man.. the texture of the flat is firm custardy, it is sweet, plus the sourness of the oranges is delicious! Not too sweet which is how I like my dessert. 

Overall good and fun meal that is not crazy inventive but interesting to see his take on Spanish tapas in a different perspective. I would come back here again to try other dishes next time!",-3GwonyrKEu4tHSO11bSRQ,1,0,4,LZjP4k0AoOhQg7nSmeBtmQ

First, do not go with more than 2, maybe 4, people in your group. This should be considered a mediocre date place. This is not a big group place at all. Don't think ""oh, but it's tapas and we'll order multiple dishes""...The dishes came out one by one, not double for each side of the table. The portions are much smaller than the average tapas restaurant. I've been all over Spain and you know what? They serve larger portions. 

Our waitress was pissy, rude and we had to practically BEG for a 2 round of drinks. There were 14 of us and we said ""double everything"". She brought out each round one at a time to the whole table. Awful. 

Drinks sucked. I had 3 cocktails -- mostly soda and mixers. The ensalada russa was mayonaise. Nothing like the ensalada russa I'm used too (I grew up on this stuff). Everything was fried. The octopus was disgusting -- gooey and chewy with little flavor. The cheese platter had 2 slices of cheese per type and they were teeny tiny.

We ordered several suggested dishes only to be underwhelmed and unimpressed at the beginning of our meal, but as we branched out and tried some of the more exotic choices, the quality and experience improved sharply. Learn from our mistakes!

PLAY IT SAFE
PAN DE CRISTAL CON TOMATE FRESCO: toasted bread with fresh tomato. Tasty but very basic, kick it up to something that's actually worth getting by adding Manchego cheese or anchovies.
JAMON IBERICO FERMIN: if you're going to come here, you may as well try the famous ham. It's not all that much different from prosciutto, in my opinion. We were underwhelmed.
COLIFLOR CON OLIVAS Y FRUTOS SECOS: the contrasting flavors of the dates and olives was enjoyable, but the roasted cauliflower that forms the base of the dish was treated as an afterthought. 
CROQUETAS DE POLLO: described as chicken fritters and served inside of a shoe, this will add some excitement to an otherwise tame table of dishes. One in our party described this dish as ""like a mini hot pocket of chicken pot pie"". It was tasty, but not the standout menu item other reviews (or even our server) made it out to be.
ARROZ CON COSTILLAS DE CERDO IBERICO DE BELLOTA Y ALCACHOFA: The pig-rib paella is tasty but not particularly adventurous. This is the only paella I've ever had where the rice was extremely crispy- I am not sure if it was overcooked, if we just got the bottom of the batch, or if it was intentional, but I did not particularly like it. 

GO FOR THE GOLD
JOSE ANDRES GIN & TONIC: $20 for a G&T is ridiculous, but luckily it is also ridiculously good.
ACEITUNAS RELLENAS Y ACEITUNAS ""FERRAN ADRIA"": Olives two ways! One is stuffed with pimiento and anchovies, the other is a liquid olive using molecular gastronomy cooking techniques. It's essentially a flavored bubble and fairly fun to experience.
BUNELOS DE BACALAO: Deep-fried salt codfish with honey aioli. The sauce is unlike anything else I've had, and the crispy fried fish is well-executed without being greasy.
CAZON FRITO: AKA SHARK NUGGETS! I love this dish. Fried thresher shark with a garlic aioli. I've never had shark but now I'm definitely interested in trying other versions. This was battered without being crispy, fried without being greasy, and simple without disappointing. Would get again!
PULPO ASADA CON CREMA CEBOLLA: Perfectly-charred grilled octopus, served with green cherry tomatoes, onion puree, and garlic oil. This was fantastic, the entire table considered it a top dish. Must order!
COSTILLAS DE CORDERO MORUNO: Succulent grilled rack of lamb with parsley oil. Simple but amazing. One of my favorite versions of lamb in Vegas.
PASTEL DE CAFE: ""Chocolate, coffee, and hazelnut tart with coffee rum ice cream."" The menu description doesn't do it justice at all. The base is like a crunchy cookie, topped with pure coffee-chocolate deliciousness, then a smooth ice cream with a delicious sauce on the plate. An indulgent, coffee-lovers dessert.

We ordered the dishes above in nearly this exact order. Total with tax and tip was just over $250, for a filling dinner for a group of three. As later dishes kept impressing us, I began to get a better feel for the restaurant's strengths, and would come back to try new items.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,9,4,T_HAG34rKfibfEwugjnF2Q

When the bill came we questioned the price and why it was not on the menu or told to us by our waitress. The Manager came over and said we were making a scene (which we were not) and asked how we were going to pay the bill and insisted we pay it right away. We never said we weren't going to pay.

It was on Hulu, so why the hell not, right? I'd been aware of José Andrés for awhile, but in watching his show I've discovered that he's kind of freaking awesome. So perhaps this was the motivation for me finally trying one of his restaurants on my most recent trip to Vegas. Or maybe it's just that I really, really like Spanish food. Or both. I think it's both.

Anyway, I rounded up five food-loving dining companions and together we ventured into Jaleo on one fine Saturday night just after my 30th birthday. We were seated quickly and given iPads on which to choose drinks. I see the reason for doing this (because the wine list we were presented was a lot different than the one on the web site, so it seems they do a lot of updating), but none of us could really get it to work right (and at least half of the folks at the table own their own iPads). I think I accidentally turned the thing off two or three times. But after some fumbling, we successfully ordered our wines. I wish I could tell you what I shared with my fiance, but it is not listed on their website. So I can tell you it was dry, white, and awesome. 

Next, onto the food! We were six very hungry people and we ordered many, many things of supreme deliciousness. The canelones were the highlight for me, primarily because of the perfectly browned manchego cheese on the top. Heavenly, you guys. Some other things that were particularly ASTONISHING:

- the veal cheeks
- the bacon wrapped dates (I know this is on every menu, but the fact that they were fried made them at least 50% better than any others I've had).
- the stuffed piquillo peppers (though the ones at Julian Serrano are still better; don't tell José I said that)
- the sliders (get the Iberico bacon!) 

We ordered the olives and one of my friends really didn't care for the liquid olives, but the rest of us approved of the FLAVOR EXPLOSION. Nothing else missed for anybody. 

Service here was just fantastic. Our waiter was super helpful with lots of recommendations, and was able to help us figure out how many orders of each thing to get. I really liked how they paced out the tapas. At a lot of other small plates spots, I sometimes feel inundated because everything seems to come out at once. Here they made it so that we were able to enjoy one or two dishes at a time, and I really appreciated that. 

Yeah, everything is expensive here, but you're on The Strip. We were all quite full for about $80/person, which is well into special occasion range, but totally worth it. And some have said it's too loud in here, but the place was packed and none of us had any trouble hearing each other at the table. Maybe we're just loud. 

Oh, and José totally replied to a tweet I wrote about the restaurant while we were still in the restaurant, and I am easily impressed so it was the coolest thing ever.

With all of this in mind, I would officially like to give this restaurant a Hell yeah. Hell yeah.",Wo_ASbM3pzJ4r1Qf6CcNOA,1,0,5,_NkQreWl2FOsCKb1jqIC6g

The flan was perfect for dessert, and had amazing clean citrus notes. Our server was as good as it gets, he checked in just the right amount, gave us great feedback on the menu and was so friendly. Overall a great experience at the Cosmopolitan.",sxhB6VpGYIlyKN8cHIXMeg,0,0,5,E0IZOWKl06wPEiprofEsPA

We tried the lunch menu here.
There wasn't anything I really loved.  The salad was okay, not special. 
Their aioli was tasted like mayo with garlic salt.  The lettuce cups with cheese and orange were literally all orange, its all I tasted.  The mini burger was just that...no joke, the smallest burger I have ever seen.  You get one and it wasn't very tasty.
The service wasn't great, I came for a lunch meeting and asked the server for explanations or suggestions and he just read us the menu items.  Some of the menu items were confusing and he wasn't able to help so we didn't order them.  
This was probably the longest lunch I have ever had in my life.  Our food and service seemed soooooo slow that I was embarrassed that I suggested it.  Everyone was somewhat pleasant and they had some cute menu items in a shoe but I really wont be back.  Plus I truly hate restaurants that charge you a ton for a soda and bring it to you in a bottle.

Garlic is in the air here! It's hard to decide on what to order because everything sounds so good. Everything is fun! The food, the seating and the vibrant colors. 

Brought my mom here on NYE and we had a blast. Ordered a pitcher of sangria to start things off and I must say it was so good, very fruity & sweet. We also decided on some tapas and ordered potato bravas (spicy and baked to perfection), cheese with all sorts of delicious pairings, bacon wrapped dates and chicken pasta (super rich & flavorful). Enjoyed everything except the bacon wrapped dates. They were ok but I've had much better (hint - Fireflys). My mom chose the orange flan for dessert and in my opinion everything on the plate had one note ~ blood orange. It wasn't my favorite. 

The music is loud. People watching is extra fun at this place and the service was on it all night. It helps to have a bunch of Spanish hotties serving you :)

The restaurant is up on the 3rd level in The Cosmopolitan Hotel. Riding up in the glass elevator is a great way to start the evening.
Ambience: the restaurant is a very open area. On walking in, there is a very handsome bar on the left. Straight ahead is a large open pit area where they cook their meats and prepare Skillets of paella. Whenever a skillet of paella is completed, the chef rings a bell and shouts out something in Spanish. This adds some festivity to the overall atmosphere. In the center there is a glassed-in area where much of the food preparation is done. Try to get a table next to that area. Watching the preparation has high entertainment value.
Service: almost immediately after we sat down Mario, a server was at our table to greet us and to help explain many of the items on the menu. So many items sounded so good that we decided to order two tasting menus for the four of us. This resulted in food runners coming to our table frequently and the busboy coming to clear frequently. Additionally, Mario came by frequently to make sure that everything was going well. When we had a minor problem with one dish he corrected it immediately. Service was truly outstanding throughout the night.
Food: there was so many dishes on the menu that were new to us that we wanted to try a lot of them. We felt the best way to go was to order two tasting menus for the 4 of us. If it turned out not to be enough, we could always order something extra off the Tapas menu. As it turned out, there was more than enough food for 4 in tasting menu for two. The meal started off with pan de cristal- a tomato bread. This was followed by cana de cabra - goat cheese chorizo. Excellent presentation and excellent taste. The next dish was a small portion of gazpacho. Also outstanding. Next came the endive orange goat cheese salad. Very light and tasty, perfect for a warm summer night. This was followed by a very small cone filled with veggies and topped with an anchovy. I'm not a big fan of anchovies. My wife, who is a fan, said it was delicious. The next courses included mushroom croquettes, a watermelon salad, a halibut tomato squash stew, and Carne asada. Each dish was better than the last. Then came the chicken and mushroom paella. Phenomenal!! For dessert they serve the chocolate custard.
Value: wonderful ambience, fabulous service, and phenomenal food, all for $75 a couple. This has to be the very best value for food in Las Vegas.",GOTjwdXD6bNZ-_qjY7GYYw,0,0,5,4zbdGQLaLwqEAqhye12NHg

The marinated chicken and carne asada are literally no more than 3 ounces a piece. The carne asada was no more than cheap skirt steak and the chicken was fatty and weird. We had the pasta paella because we couldn't wait the 45 minutes for the traditional paella.

Eating tapas style is my favorite way to dine so I have some experience with portion sizes and I would say their dishes are small to average size and the pricing is what you would expect in a hotel of this caliber. 

We started with a carafe of the sangria which came spiked with blueberries, lemons, mint and orange peel, it was delicious! One full carafe gave us each about 1.5 small glasses, we only got one for our group but I probably could have drank at least half of one on my own. 

Our group of four ordered the warm green bean salad, piquillo peppers, goats milk cheese, potato wrapped chorizo, garlic shrimp and carne asada. We arrived only moderately hungry and we left satisfied but not extremely full, it turned out nice because it left us ready for the drinking and dancing we did later that night. 

As mentioned earlier the quality of the food was very good, we liked all of the dishes but I especially loved the garlic shrimp. The garlic oil/sauce they come in is to die for!

It was one of our best eating experiences in the city so when we heard Jose Andreas had opened another one in Las Vegas we had to go. Unfortunately the first time we went our favorite dish was not offered during lunch so we left. Six months later we made a return and were not disappointed this time.

Jaleo serves tapas style dishes which means the servings are small and several orders should be made for each person to be full. The menu is huge with chesses, salads, meats, etc. there is plenty to pick from.

Hands down this is their best dish: Croquetas de pollo 

These are fried fritters with creamy chicken inside served in a shoe that shows Andreas' playful spirit. Once you have these you will ask for another and another serving they are that delicious.

We also had Patatas Bravas which are small slices of potato with aioli on top and a tomato sauce on the bottom. Chistorra envuelta en patata frita which were slightly spicey chorize sausages wrapped in a crispy potato skin. Cana de cabra con higos which were red peppers stuffed with goat cheese with a jam. I have to say the cheese was a bit bitter on this one. Finally we finished with Pollo a la parrilla con queso Valdeón y mostaza which was a perfectly grilled piece of chicken with a nice mix of herbs, mustard and lemon The sauce was delicious and the lemon added a nice citrus taste as well.

We were in the mood for tapas anyway, so all it took was a quick visit to Open Table and we had a 9:30 reservation.

The place was bustling.  We showed up a few minutes late - you know how it is, walking the strip in heels - and still had to wait a few minutes for our table to be cleared and set, but we chatted amicably with the hostess (about the wonderfulness of the Mission in San Francisco, randomly) and were shortly led inside.

The decor was playful.  Our table was just beneath an enormous stuffed bull (I'm guessing it was not an actual, taxidermied one, but what do I know) wearing a silver lame wrestling mask, and I liked the  patchwork-style mixed prints on the extremely comfortable banquettes and the red pendant lamps that hung throughout the restaurant.  I especially adored the menus printed with various words relating to tapas - seriously, is ñum ñum the Spanish equivalent of nom nom?  Because that is way, way better.

To drink, we ordered a full carafe of sangria, which I found to be delicious in a spicy, more nuanced way than most sangrias (and which also seemed to be on the strong side - score).  To start with, we ordered the selection of five cheeses - Pasamontes Manchego, Murcia al Vino, Garrotxa, La Serena, and La Peral - and the Pan con Tomate with Jamon Serrano.    All the cheeses were delicious, although we counted the Garrotxa and La Peral as our absolute favorites, and although it did turn out that the cheese plate came with Pan con Tomate anyway (as well as dried apricots, raisins on the vine, and Marcona almonds), we were pleased to have the extra when the next round of food came.

Next we had the warm Brussels sprouts salad, which was so amazing I considered demanding the recipe from the kitchen, with chunks of jamon Serrano, halved grapes, and dried apricots in a tangy dressing.  The gambas al ajillo were - I am so very sorry to say - not what I was expecting...I own Jose Andres' tapas cookbook and regularly make his gambas al ajillo from it to great fanfare, and these were not in the same style.  In fact you could barely tell that they had every been in the pan with that wonderful garlic and olive oil mixture, which we sopped up with the spare Pan con Tomate.  Finally, in an effort to order at least one thing that wasn't totally standard tapas fare, we had the Tortilla de Erizos, tortilla with sea urchin - the uni was creamy and provided a nice contrast with the tortilla, although, full disclosure, I wasn't totally won over and probably wouldn't order it again.

For dessert, we had the Pan con Chocolate, which was basically like, a quenelle of chocolate flan rolled in cookie crumbs and topped with ice cream, a superthin shard of caramelized bread, and a drizzle of olive oil.  It was AMAZING - sweet and salty and unctuous.  Seriously, I'm now contemplating putting olive oil on all my desserts.  Delicious and heart healthy!...or, you know, not.

After a couple of cafe con leches we got the check and it was a very respectable $120 or so.  Overall, it was a fantastic evening with good to great service and mostly excellent food.",geeRP-gkEQmiYRp5vMJ-zQ,1,0,4,fOzvR4j3b2Xv3vKuu_EsdQ

Given the incredible flavors, I find it very easy to overeat.  My selections are the Kumamotos with gin & tonic.  While good, perhaps a little too much liquor and not enough acidity.  The highlights for me are the warm spinach with pine nuts, raisins and apples, absolutely delicious and begging to be ordered again.  Then the exceptional mini burger using the ever so long roasting Iberico pig.  I only keep the bottom brioche, too much bread and gets in the way of those exceptional flavors.  The marinated lamb loin does not disappoint, the spices and flavors stay with me long after the meal is over.

1870924,2013-09-01,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Jaleo suffers from what seemingly all Tapas places in the US suffer from. The whole idea of tapas is to try small portions of a number of different types of food at lower prices. Jaleo provides smaller portions but doesn't have as wide a variety of food as one would hope for and definitely doesn't have the lower prices. 

Jaleo then suffers from another problem - they fry just about every dish. Spanish food is not necessarily heavy or populated by fried items, but Jaleo's menu is just loaded up with fried options when it simply doesn't need to be. Even the datillos con tocino (dates with bacon - an absolute tapas staple) is fried. i've never seen that, why ruin the dish by frying it?

Because of that maybe the best dish we had was the sliced apple and fennel salad - it was just so fresh and such a welcome, refreshing change. The other dish that was very good was the skirt steak with piquillo peppers - another common Tapas dish - that was done well. I love skirt steak so that helps as well since the steak was cooked well.

Oyamel is my absolute favorite and this Jaleo is similar in tapas fashion, but their portions are much larger. My mom had the chorizo and potato chips which she was not wowed by and the hanger steak. She said the steak was good. I had the platatas bravas which were potatoes with aioli and marinara sauce- that was SO good!! I had the shrimp and aoili paella and the portion was HUGE and so yummy! It was my favorite!! For a cocktail I had the Floral Funk and my mom ordered just a classic margarita and skipped the craft. 

All in all it was okay. I love that Jaleo is central in the Cosmopolitan hotel and that it's owned by Jose, but other than that, I'm not sure I would go out of my way to go back.",TVu-9iXakpbDxyyaTI-rHQ,0,0,3,E0yeSmwS2wWvHcJtel3x8Q

We ordered...

Rosemary Lemonade - very sour and the rosemary hits you a bit later into the drink, but I loved it.

Pan Con Tomate (with Manchego) - so good. Its perfect with manchego and I just love it. Unlike some bread/tomato/cheese starters, this was easy to eat and didn't make an embarrassing mess. So so so good.

Apple/Fennel Salad - I love anything with apple and fennel. Throw in some manchego and I'm very happy. This was probably my favorite bite of the meal. 

Cod Empenadas - we were warned they were different. And they are. Its kind of like fried won ton wrappers with liquid cod and cheese inside - and drizzled with honey. (Good thing I don't write menu descriptions as that sounds disgusting - but its very good!)

Carne Asada - yum, very tender and it came with some tasty red peppers. 

Bacon Wrapped Dates - I've never had a date before and didn't know they were so sweet!  These are little dates, wrapped in bacon and breaded.  Our server recommended this dish be served last as it is somewhat dessert-like. Good call.

The service was great and his recommendations for dishes were perfect - both the specific dishes themselves and the number of dishes (2-3 per person).  

The drink menu was on an iPad that was left at the table to give you time to scroll and search through to find all sorts of wines, cocktails, and nonalcoholic beverages. It was fun, but kind of a silly concept as you were to select on the iPad which drinks you wanted - then you are supposed to hold up the iPad and show the server your ""order page""  so they can then write down your order. Then the server walks over to the computer terminal and types in your order.  Bit cooler if my iPad and order actually DID something and was automatically sent to the bar - I felt silly holding up my iPad - it would have been easier to just say, ""uh, a lemonade please?""  But fun nevertheless. 

Jaleo was the perfect restaurant for a late dinner after an afternoon of driving. I so recommend this place.",IJfJlr0BIu-dH1ie__MbNg,1,1,5,UNgcQs5214mmj-3-vRoY3w
1893175,2012-10-22,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Plenty of great restaurants in Las Vegas take themselves way too seriously. I loved Jaleo because while they serve excellent food they do it in a playful way. You're not going to find food served in sneakers (yes, I said SNEAKERS) at the new Gordon Ramsay Steak.

Located on the 2nd floor at the Cosmopolitan with a bunch of other restaurants (STK, China Poblano, etc.) the decor is modern Spanish with a mix of hightop, lowtop, and booth tables.

To order drinks you the waiter gives you an ipad to look up all their selections. The app was very easy to use and ended up being handy versus gimmicky. The Cuba Libre was one of the best ""rum/coke"" drinks I've ever had. With a cinnamon stick, bitters, and a giant sphere ice cube served in a red wine glass it was as beautiful as it was tasty. My date had the Jaleo bramble which because of the cucumber water and berry puree tasted very fresh.

On to the food!

Patatas Bravas (fried potatoes): A simple dish, but one of the best. Nicely fried with a delicious red sauce and aioli . These disappeared very quickly.

Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic sauce): The sauce on this dish rocked my world. Garlicky of course, but with a very deep flavor. We both wished for bread to get some more of the sauce. 

Rape Donostiarra (monkfish with sherry): Very thinly sliced monkfish, which tastes similarly to lobster. Light sherry/olive oil sauce which was mild to let the taste of the fish through.

Mejillones Vapor (mussels with lemon and olive oil): Mussels were very little and the ones that weren't gritty tasted excellent. Sauce was very buttery, but went well with the mussels.

Setas al Ajillo (wild mushrooms): Hen of the woods mushrooms with a side of mashed potatoes. Really liked the potatoes, but the mushrooms tasted like mushrooms with nothing on them.

Overall a wonderful meal, made excellent with a few drinks and a beautiful date. It's a great first stop before heading out to Marquee!",E_1rVCWq4NgbXhEjMC651Q,1,0,4,cxLdU3at9MFf8SY-D_C7KA
1913312,2014-05-08,6,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"After eating at Jaleo I cam away with one life lesson- all pigs should be fed nothing but acorns. Seriously. I would definitely recommend going to Jaleo at least once to try it, though I probably won't become a regular here. 

I will say off the bat two things prevented Jaleo from getting a 5 star review.

1. The Chairs- the table we sat at was one of those awkward high tables, and I sat on the side that had a weird bench instead of individual chairs. After about 10 minutes all I could think about was the 30 rock where Jack sells his awful couches to the government to be used as torture devices. This sounds like a comedic exaggeration- but seriously it was so uncomfortable, and when you are going to be somewhere for three hours a good chair is a must.

2. The service- was very slow. We had a conversation about how we probably would of ordered twice as much stuff if the server had actually come around frequently. Paying the bill from the time we requested it took about 40 minutes. 


Now, given those two things imagine how good the food was to earn 4 stars-pretty freaking good. 

Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín- this is like prosciutto I guess- it comes sliced very thinly and artfully arranged on a plate. I have often heard people say ""melt in your mouth"" but honestly I have never really had anything melt in my mouth... until now. The white, fat part of each slice did in fact quickly turn to a liquid when you put each piece into your mouth. Now, this comes with some bread (Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco-which we also ordered as an appetizer) and I have to say there is no better illustration of a tale of two cities than this bread paired with the pig- it is terrible. It was very hard/crusty, and it has what appear to be raw tomatoes just sort of mashed into it. Did not like-although the people I was eating with liked it- but trust me they are morons. 

Dátiles Con Tocino 'Como Hace Todo El Mundo'-as far as I know I have never eaten a date before. Wrapping something in Bacon and then frying it is a good way to introduce someone to new foods- try it with your kids and broccoli. 

Croquetas De Pollo- these are awesome- like a mini chicken Cordon Bleu

Chistorra envuelta en patata frita - this is a little cocktail weenie sized chorizo sausage wrapped in a potato chip and fried. They are good, but not one of our favorites.

Gambas Con Gabardina- these tempura shrimp were hands down our favorite of the appetizers- amazing ( if lobster tempura at Flemmings is a 10, these are a solid 9) and the sauce that comes with them is great. 

José's Taco- this is a play on ""taco"" NOT AN ACTUAL TACO. That is key. Its basically a little piece of the Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín with a scoop of caviar on top. It is quite tasty, but not an actual taco.

Mini Pepito De Ibérico-this was one of the group favorites, in fact one person lamented in hindsight that they should have just gotten 8 of these. Its a little ""wet"" for lack of a better word- I assume due to all the pig inside it there is a lot of grease- and that could be a turn off for some people, we call them quitters. 

Chorizo Casero Con Puré De Patatas Al Aceite De Oliva-this was one of my favorites- little slices of chorizo in a potato pure- both elements are excellent. 

I definitely wanted to try more things (like the pork skirt steak) but we decided to wrap it up after 3 hours.


Overall I really liked Jaleo but I think honestly I prefer Julian Serrano- they have a more diverse menu (like those little pizzas that must have heroin in them) better regular human height chairs, and better service. Jaleo seems higher end, and the acorn fed pig is truly delicious but the total package of the restaurant is not as good.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,5,4,r1bkVllcd3UOyyvRb1O_8Q

We had Pan con tomate (a must), Croquetas de pollo, Lomo, and Rossejat. The bread was crunchy, with salty tomato goodness; particularly good pan con tomate. The croquetas were excellent!  Some places make croquetas with a lot of potato, and very little meat filling. On the contrary, these were fully of creamy chicken filling, served piping hot in a shoe.  (I like the plastic ""shoe"" service better at Jose Andres Baazar in Miami; the shoes here at Jaleo were real, leather Camper tennis shoes; the germaphobe in me couldn't get over it...). The lomo beef was perfectly cooked, and the mustard seed was the perfect compliment.  Finally the seafood Rossejat was a great substitute for paella, since they were not offering a plated seafood paella on the night we visited. The  thing that hurt the rating was our server - she never came back! Lots of different people came back, bringing the plates, filling waters... But no one asked if we needed drinks or knives, etc. Meanwhile the server for the table next to me kept checking with her table, so I caught her and asked her if she could recommend wine. She asked me what I like, recommended a wine, then came back with the wine.  Perfect. Great food, and convenient if you want to do something in Cosmopolitan or Bellagio after.

Pan de cristal con tomate fresco: Bread with Tomato... sounds boring, but it's really fresh, crispy, salty, delicious.  Great to have and pair with other dishes.

Croquetas de pollo:  Little fried chicken and cheese fritters.  Delicious
Datiles con tocino: Bacon wrapped dates.  I had to cave and try this.  Crispy, sweet, amazing!!
Trigueros con romesco: Cauliflower with dates and olives.  Unique taste but really good if you are a veghead!

- *Watermelon Salad : very fresh tasting, and the pistachios were a nice touch
- *Warm Brussels Sprouts Salad (without ham): was a pleasant surprise, the fruit paired so well with the sprouts
-*Patatas Bravas: these mini potatoes were amazing,  especially the sauces they come with... Yum!!!!!
-Salt Codfish: this one disappointed. It just tasted like 'fried'- I expected a battered piece of fish, but instead it was a ball of fish mushed up with some other stuff, breaded then fried. Neither of us liked this.
-Gambas Al Ajillo : apparently their most popular dish, but neither of us especially enjoyed it. It was just okay- we managed one shrimp each and left the rest.

Some favorites from the meal:

Croquetas - Best croquetas I've ever had

I just happened to look right now at the Jaleo Washington DC menu and you get all six cheeses for 18 dollars. Grrrrr! haha, oh well. I've lived in DC and now in Vegas, and I guess this is the compromise I get for dining in a casino on the strip now.
My favorite favorite favorite dish that we tasted was the fried organic egg topped with caviar! YUM! YUM! YUM!
We also had the spicy chorizo wrapped in a thin potato! Which I thought was great, just the right amount of spice!
Then there were the fried dates wrapped in bacon.....hmmmm. Served in a shoe!? YES! served in a shoe. I have a picture on my phone that I wish I could upload right now. I've never eaten out of a shoe before. But, if you can get past the bizarre notion, its actually quite funny (especially after three glasses of wine) and quite tasty!
As far as meat goes, I didn't try any of the serrano ham, which I'll have to come back for. But, I loved the grilled hanger steak with piquillo peppers. It was sliced very thin, but still medium rare, and tasted amazing alongside the bread and cheeses.
My least favorite was some other roasted red pepper dish, but obviously I can't even remember the ingredients so it did not impress.
I was far too full for dessert, but instead enjoyed a cup of resh french press coffee to keep me going for the rest of the night.

For a large group we had to go through a reservation line, and it was so nice to correspond back and forth on email! Jaleo is EXTREMELY accommodating for large groups. They let you fully customize the menu, and they even printed our event name at the top! We had a vegetarian in our group, and the day of the dinner, they really took care of her and gave her unique dishes to accommodate her diet. 

I really loved our experience at Jaleo. It was very well worth the money we spent. If we come again as a large party, I would definitely want to eat there again.

Below is our menu and my opinions on each dish. The full array of dishes cost us $$105pp, and that includes tax and tip.

**Seleccion de jamones Fermin pro Jose -- the ham selection was very good! the fatty one they brought out was extremely buttery and tasty.  It came with a side of tomato bread (pan con tomate). 

**Aceitunas rellenas y acietunas 'Ferran Adria' - not my favorite dish.  the liquid olives were weird and CRAZY SALTY!

**La Serena con membrillo - strong cheese in a little cone w/ quince paste.  if you are not a fan of blue cheese or goat cheese, you probably wouldn't like this one. The aroma of the cheese is very pungent, but I thought the quince paste balanced it out.

_____________

**Salmon crudo con vinagreta de anchoas - The salmon was very fresh, and the dish was served like a tartare.  The slices of salmon were very thin, with the lemon anchovy oil drizzled all around.  Kudos from all around the table for this dish.

**Gambas al ajillo - There is a reason why this shrimp is 'VERY FAMOUS'.  The sauce is incredible, and the shrimp is perfectly cooked.  My friend wanted a straw to slurp up the leftover sauce haha

**Huevo frito con caviar - egg with egg.  DELICIOUS! MY FAVORITE OF THE NIGHT.  It was so flavorful. The egg was poached perfectly with some runniness on the inside, and the caviar on top gave it just the right amount of saltiness.  yumm!!!!!

**Escalivada catalana - roasted red peppers and eggplant.  good palate cleanser.  the smokiness of fire roasting the veggies was perfect.

_____________

Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego - LOVE Manchego cheese.  This salad was extremely refreshing, and the fennel bulb was not too licorice-y.  We ate this slowly so that we could pick at it the rest of the dinner.

Butifarra casera esparracada - pork sausage stew - it was good, but not very memorable.

Fricando de carilleras de ternera y pure de patatas al aceite de oliva - the veal cheeks were so tender. This dish would have been perfect, and I probably would rave about it more if it had come earlier in the meal.  We were getting full by this point!

_____________

**Setas al ajillo con la serena - sauteed wild mushrooms - had to get some more vegetables in there somehow :) not bad

**Carne asada con piquillos 'Julian de Lodosa' - It is very easy to overcook this cut of steak,but our steak came out a perfect medium.  Tender, juicy, yummy :)

**Arroz a banda con bogvante - lobster paella.  again, if this came out earlier I would be raving about it.  sooooo stuffed!

(when we had been to Jaleo previously we were seated in a comfy booth)

The food was great, we had the toasted bread with tomato and garlic, the endive salad with goat cheese, orange and almonds, the Jamón ibérico Fermín (dry-cured ham), and chicken fritters (served in a shoe, very funny!)

The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area. The servers were nice, attentive, and helpful with our questions. 

We ordered up the paella feast, which includes beet gazpacho, a salad with some fancy sounding vinaigrette, and a paella plate. The place decor is really nice and you could see a whole pig being roasted on an open fire in the middle of the food prep area.

The gazpacho was presented in a very fancy fashion and was served inside a neat modern cup, drizzle with some olive oil, topped with fresh-looking oval croutons. However, one bite in and the taste of salt just overpowered all the other flavors. I could still eat it but I felt as if I was eating condensed gazpacho.

Then was the salad. The salad was literally a couple large lettuce leaves with 5 olives, two slices of tomato and red onion dressed in some vinaigrette. We thought they forgot to bring out a second salad serving but the waitress had placed the bowl in the middle of our table which made me realize that it was meant to share. A bit stingy and didn't really seem like restaurant quality.

Finally, we waited on the paella. We figured the paella would be wonderful and rich and full of flavor. Instead we received plates of undercooked rice (supposedly al dente..) and extremely dry chicken. The entire place was hard to chew and tasted too salty.

Overall, I would not go back here again and I wouldn't recommend my friends to come here. The overall experience did not satisfy me especially for the price. Really beautiful place though.",lZiqaMOH-thX0t48mT0Qug,0,0,2,dAyLFiYEwxinD2ixSKkHxA

This is Las Vegas, after all, and Jaleo has set itself up to be held to a high standard that it didn't quite meet for us.  Summary to start for those who like to read the ending of a story first is this:   

Food:  5 Stars. 
Value: 4 Stars.  
Ambiance Main Dining room: 4 Stars.  
Ambiance Secondary (The Bull) Dining Room:  2 stars. 
Service: 2 Stars.   

Are we glad we went once?  Yes.  It was fine.  But not so stellar as a total package experience that we're eager to return.   

FOOD & LIBATIONS:  We're fans of tapas in general and chef Jose Andres' approach in particular.  We had high expectations for the food and they were met.  Creative menu, perfect execution by the kitchen with sophisticated and subtle flavors for each of our five (including dessert) choices.
  
1) potato croquettes (not to be missed), 
2) salad with cipollini onions - blue cheese - clementines (delicious), 
3) monkfish in parsley oil (intriguingly good),
4) saute of mixed wild mushrooms and Spanish sausage (heavy on the mushrooms so just right for us),
5) daily special dessert of grapefruit sorbet and ice cream - top notch.

Portions were perfect - we could not have eaten any more but we would not have wanted any less.

Our beverage choice was house made Sangria. Don't scoff - we're normally not fans of Sangria either, but this was  good and a perfect complement to the food, not to mention most affordable. If don't try the Sangria we think you'll be missing out.

VALUE: A nice surprise about Jaleo for us was how affordable it was, by Las Vegas standards at least.  Our total meal for two before tip was just under $80. 

SERVICE:  Here the disappointment sets in - big time.  When we FINALLY (you see where this is headed) placed our order, and asked to have the dishes delivered in a specific order, which we were assured would be no problem, our server said something about like this.  ""You've ordered unusually well for first time guests at Jaleo.  That's probably because you needed to wait on us for such a long time to take your order that you were able to really study our menu.""

TA-DUM

She may have thought that was funny.  We weren't so sure. Because it is true that after being seated and offered water by the server's assistant (more on that in a minute) we waited better than 15 minutes before we saw a server at our table, in spite of two walking by us several times.  We finally had to flag an assistant down to ask to have someone wait on us.  And it's not as if we were tucked in a corner...being seated on the banquette under The Bull and all.

Then the food items were served out of order.  Which suggests inattention to coordination with the kitchen. Everyone can have a bad night.  Maybe the poor service quality here is not the norm.  But it was our experience on that night.  And it was particularly surprising given it was not quite 7p and the restaurant wasn't even half full.

WATCH FOR BLOATED TAB DUE TO WATER SERVICE:  Seriously. When you're seated the server's assistant will ask if you would like water. Yes? Then you'll be asked if you'd prefer sparkling or flat. If you think flat means no charge, you'll be unpleasantly surprised when the bill arrives. If you want water without charge you'll need to specify, you will not be asked, ""tap"" water. We weren't the only table to feel ""had"" by that procedure. Fortunately we caught it in advance - the folks next to us had the unhappy experience of learning the charge applied for flat water when they got their bill.  Were I making the management decisions here, for purposes of customer good will I'd make sure the fee for flat water was explained at the time the orders were taken.   It's a little thing - but it is a thing.

AMBIANCE:  The main dining room is where the open kitchen and bar are, and where the action is.  Unfortunately, if you want to sit at a table in this section you'll need to navigate high bar height seating.  (Although if you want to sit AT the bar, they do provide a couple of spaces of standard height seating.)  If you want a table with standard dining height seating, the secondary dining room it is.  More sedate and actually sort of absent decor, we would have elected the main dining area but for the high seating at tables.  I'm not sure that it is with high stool dining tables - they don't work great for smaller children, shorter adults, some older adults and in general women in heels and skirts trying to maintain decorum for a business discussion.  They sure don't work for disabled people, including war veterans.  Standard height tables work for everyone.  Just sayin'.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,5,5,3,qLm_pTJJ3gaZhd0VGcBKKw

2153239,2017-06-28,1,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I wanted SO badly to love Jaleo. But it was just one disappointment after another. 

The best way I can describe the food is that it's like a KICK to face with intense flavor. Many people would think that's great. Personally, I don't like getting kicked in the face.

The service was ok. Friendly, but not the kind of care you'd hope for with a tasting. No explanations, no recommendations, just plates dropped off one after another. 

Here's the good: 
Pan Con Chocolate - A dessert on the regular menu (not the restaurant week menu) that our server so kindly gave as a replacement for the sangria ice. This dessert is what I had hoped the entire tasting was going to be like. Beautifully plated, subtle yet complex flavors, perfectly balanced. I would return just for this dessert. I'm not one to ever order chocolate dessert after dinner, but this was one of my favorite chocolate desserts ever.

Tomate Verde Frito Con Valdeon - Fried green tomatoes with PX reduction and Valdeon cheese. Very good. Not amazing. The cheese really made this dish.

Carne Con Piquillo - Hangar steak, grilled perfectly. Simply seasoned. Great!

Ensalada Verde - Lovely flavor, but very intense. Could only take one bite, but it was an enjoyable bite.

Vieras Con Mojo Rojo - Seared scallop with romesco. Delicious but extremely salty. And 3 of the dishes had the same romesco. Overkill.


The NOT so good:
Paella - Trainwreck. Half of the rice was severely undercooked, the other was over-cooked. Crunchy mush. Couldn't eat it. 

Gazpacho - I watched a table of 6 behind us chug their glasses of gazpacho and it blew my mind. I took one sip and first it was delightful. But second sip I realized the intensity of the flavor. I felt like I was trying to drink bottle of salad dressing.

Pan de Crystal Con Tomate Fresco - The bread was described as ""ethereal"" on the menu, and it was. It was light, airy, crispy, and drizzled with a wonderful olive oil, and completely covered in the fresh tomatoes. The tomatoes were good, but I found it surprising that it was served the way it was. Had the tomatoes been served on the side allowing the ability to scoop it on before every bite, it would have been a fabulous dish. But instead it was a soggy, soupy mess. 

Everything else was okay. 

To drink, I ordered their Shirley Temple made with house-made grenadine. It was lovely, but strange. I was expecting an amaretto or cherry flavor but it was spicy, like cinnamon or nutmeg. For $6 it was a better deal than the other 8oz bottled sodas for the same price. As I'm currently ""off the sauce"" I cannot review their cocktails or wine selection. However, the cocktail list and wine menu looked extensive. The sommelier assisting the table next to us was quite knowledgeable. And the different cocktails and made-at-the-table sangrias everywhere all looked delicious. 

In the end, $50 for the restaurant week menu was of good value. Jaleo is one of the few restaurants to offer an actual multi-course tasting. If you're into intense, in-your-face, overkill flavor you should give this place a shot. This is a great spot for groups and social gatherings, too, with its hopping, energetic ambiance. But if you're hoping for those subtle flavors that are new and out of this world, maybe skip this one. Or just go for dessert.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,3,0,3,4Akx8KoBZjdSykQ7BRKqGg

2173176,2011-09-05,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I'll start off with the good. The sangria is amazing and the food is delicious, the decor and ambiance really goes well together but that doesn't outweigh the things I was greatly displeased with. To start off with the restaurant doesn't even have it's name on the outside, how is it people are suppose to find the place if it isn't label? Is it suppose to be a secret that only a certain group of people know about? I only found it after walking around the third floor of the Cosmopolitan and using the process of elimination to figure out that particular restaurant must be Jaleo. Once we got our seats, I might was well be eating with the other patrons surrounding me, that's how close, cramp and loud it is!

Our waitress was very pleasant she took the time to explain the menu to us and handed us an iPad to order drinks. So what was the point of the iPad drink menu? Absolutely nothing! Basically it's a 300 dollar drink menu. You're suppose to scroll through the different cocktails, wines, beers...etc and you show your selections to your server which he/she writes down on a pad of paper. It's not like your sending your order electronically to the bar...because that would make too much sense. 

So after you waste your time trying to rationalize the use of the iPad drink menu it's time to order the food. Ironically this doesn't involve another iPad. So we ordered six things off the menu, 3 for the each of us.  Now I've been to other tapas restaurants before and when you order a couple of things off a menu the server does their best to try to get as many plates to you as possible so they can get you in and out. Well apparently that's not part of Jaleo's business model. Their model seems to work as let's wait 15 to 20 minutes before each plate comes out. Keep in mind that we had a show to attend across the street at Planet Hollywood at 9pm and I was required to pick up the tickets by 8pm, our reservation was at 6pm. So an hour and half goes by and still we didn't get our 6th plate, apparently the waitress or the kitchen staff totally forgot, so the restaurant manager reassured us that the dish would be out in a few moments. 10 minutes went by and still nothing, keep in mind it was a pasta dish...nothing super complicated! Eventually we got frustrated with the wait time and demanded the check, they of course they didn't charge us for the dish they couldn't get to us in time.  As I was signing my credit card receipt the manager came up to us again and reassured us better service if we were to come back, by that time I handed him my opinion on the ""How Are We Doing?"" suggestion pad. I pretty much wrote to him how lousy the food service was. Overall, stay away from this place. There are many tapas restaurants in Las Vegas, I still prefer Fire Fly.

2178537,2011-04-28,2,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"The Skinny: skillful executed dishes but really odd flavour combinations that do not work (3), service: was good and efficient for a place of this caliber (3.5) value: I think tapas might be a synonym for charging you more for a smaller dish of food - we ordered 6 dishes and 1 dessert for $75 prior to tax and tip(3) 

I really wanted to try Jaleo ever since I learned that Jose Andres started the whole tapas craze here in the US (although I first learned about tapas from watching the Frugal Gourmet when I was a kid - that's before all the sketchy allegations!). Plus being a Top Chef fan, I am always keen to try some of the guest judges cuisine.

First of all, I want to preface this. I do not doubt that Mr. Andres has incredible skill. I think that some of the things we had took a lot of technique to perfect (ie, Iberico ham croquettes and Cod empanadas). But technical skill does not make a great meal because in the end (for me)...it is all about flavour.

So we started off with some roasted peppers, eggplant and sweet onion which was not what we were expecting. If you check out the pics - the eggplant looked like tapeworms swimming in olive oil. Visual appeal rates a zero. Luckily, it tasted okay albeit pedestrian given the caliber of this establishment.

I think the thing that makes this place shine is their ability to take make fried food with a molten center. Both the Iberico ham croquettes and cod empanadas were surprisingly lovely and crisp on the outside without succuming to the liquid in the middle. There were problems with the these dishes though. The flavour of the Iberico ham was lost in the enveloping bechamel sauce. The cod empanadas were good but were overly fishy for my hubby's tastes (kind of like a strong mackeral - I'll admit, I did enjoy this but would likely not order this again).

Iberico ham (oh, that creamy nutty luscious goodness that literally melts in your mouth) was very small portion considering the cost. Doesn't come with bread either which made it difficult to truly enjoy due to the inherent salinity of the meat. It definitely needed something else to justify the cost of this dish.

The foie gras cannelloni was a huge disappointment mostly because of the preparation of the foie gras filling. The texture was grainy while the flavour of goose liver was completely absent from the dish. As a matter of fact, the filling had an unpleasant sourness to it that even overwhelmed the lovely unctiousness of the liberally combined shaved truffle and truffle oil. As they say, no bueno.

By far the best dish of the night - the veal cheek with morel mushrooms. Utterly delicious, the judicious scent of cinnamon gave a mild hint of spice in this earthy dish. The textures of the meat was marvelous - like the best succulent short rib you've ever had. 

Hazelnut cake was surprising lacking in hazelnuts other than as a candied garnish. For a Nutella lover like me, it's like a bait and switch and I was oh-so-sad. A chocolate mousse over sponge was okay but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere for significantly less. Toying with my affections that way is a cruel joke, my friends. A cruel joke indeed.

Like all tapas places, the portion sizes were small and definitely overpriced. I would probably go back again for the veal cheek alone (yes, it is that good and is also the sole reason this place rates a 3) but would likely order other things off the menu.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,2,3,psHA8fMeyR1vdCe0A9ix0Q

Upon arrival I apologized for being late. The hostess carried an arrogant attitude which unfortunately left a really bitter taste in my mouth.  We were seated about 20 minutes later at a table that had been unoccupied for about 15 minutes. 

Luckily we had a really sweet server who offered food/drink suggestions. The restaurant is well lit with very modern furniture. The ambiance is trendy, just about fitting for its patrons.

2247090,2018-03-08,25,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"So you're in Vegas, you've eaten at a steakhouse for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The line for the buffet wraps around the building and calling room service yields a longer wait time than Comcast customer service. Your stomach has been tag teamed by Bobby Flay and Giada so much you feel like a dirty, little Eggslut.

Your palate yearns for the extraordinary.

It can be found at Jaleo.

The restaurant excels at traditional Spanish tapas. If you want to contract the meat sweats, stop by Bazaar Meats. If you want to feel like aliens abducted you to a far away galaxy and decided to run a tasting menu by you, try the molecular gastronomy presented at É, housed within Jaleo.

The menu is extensive so for the best enjoyment keep a menu and continually order items throughout the meal. Jaleo has, quite possibly, one of the most cohesive menus considering the number of dishes offered. Honestly, there's been many times where I'm not sure what I even ordered. You can randomly point to things on the menu and the dishes will impeccably compliment each other with layers of flavor. Ask your server for guidance if you wish to be directed. They are experts on perfect pairings. Here are just a few of my personal selections. Remember, be as open minded and adventurous as possible. 

Start with the Pan De Cristal Con Tomate for a simple and delicious starter. I make sure to order this every single visit. The menu describes it as ""ethereal"" and honestly, it's an apt word for it. 

The legendary Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín is a must try for fans of cured meats. The black-footed pigs are allowed to roam freely in the forest and ""pig out"" on acorns. This imbues the meat with a nutty flavor and a buttery richness. The hand cut slices just melt in your mouth. 

The Gambas Al Ajillo is one of my favorites. Sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp swimming in a garlic, tomato broth that's rich, acidic and creamy. I nearly drink it right out of the skillet it's served in.

Then, of course, the paella. The kitchen creates different paella on rotation so your server will tell you which variety is about to be finished and you can either try that one or wait for another to be prepared. You can't go wrong with these. The auditory ruckus created by the staff signaling a finished paella is unmistakable. Each one is cooked over a wood burning fire that gives it a subtle smoky flavor.

Mini Pepito De Ibérico are sliders made with Ibérico pork, see above about Ibérico. A must have dish. My only complaint is that these aren't the size of my fist. 

I have yet to crack the surface of Jaleo even after multiple visits. One of the best restaurants in Vegas for its consistency and craft.

I had the honor of meeting chef José Andrés at a Thomas Fire Benefit in Ventura, California. His charity, World Central Kitchen, provided some of the food for the event and also helped provide meals to displaced residents of Ventura County during the devastating Thomas Fire. He's such a genuine man that has earned respect in the kitchen and beyond. 

Now, order some Sherry and enjoy life at Jaleo. Cheers!",am6s_iLpPj3KfTFWG09FhQ,35,36,5,SF6dzVzJdhPgOWl22TlW9w

My wife and I decided that it was time to go experience Jose Andres, Vegas style.  Being from the DC area we had been exposed to his Epicurean talents but were not sure what to expect from this Jaleo or China Poblano.  With Jose it is best to expect the unexpected at all times.

From the seating area directly in front of Jaleo we surveyed the crowd inside.  This place has an electric feel from hallway.  There are several different styles of tables including a foosball table conversion that seems a bit distracting.  The rest of the tables are diverse in style, and draw one's eye around the room.

In the center of the restaurant there is a small open-fire kitchen where they prepare the paella.  We sampled the lobster paella and it was phenomenal.  We also ordered an array of small plates and had an absolute blast.  The winner for me from Jaleo was the gin and tonic oysters that were so fresh and flavorful it made me wonder how they had gotten to the middle of the desert so quickly.

2261973,2012-11-04,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Part I : Cosmo Food Crawl

Being a resident in this surreal city, (think adult Disneyland) we have so much available at our fingertips; it can be overwhelming and after a while, one can get jaded over the constant barrage of overstimuli pounding at you like a sobakawa pillow repeatedly beating your face.  But, you gotta take advantage of what's available to you, so we regularly don our armor, spray ourselves with tourist repellent and trek on over to the strip (consequently we have to burn our clothes from all the smoke)... We don't normally drink so we come up with other amusements...
So instead of a Pub Crawl, we do a Foodie Crawl; where we go to several restaurants, dine on their signature dishes and enjoy multiple ambiences... which turns out to to be an entertaining nite!!

The Cosmopolitan is the perfect destination for such a night; there's dedicated restaurant floors so each venue is in close proximity, they are as diverse in cuisine as well as ambience and there's exists a perennial, 'hipper than thou' vibe that makes it conducive people watching and casually hopping in and out of venues sans guilt...

JALEO

Jose Andre's Jaleo has to be the BEST restaurant on the Strip; with Tapas cuisine winning an all-time, hipster popularity contest (probably due to its small portions so they don't overeat..those thin emaciated waifs and emos) the food served here is bar none the best Spanish cuisine you'll find anywhere (LA has the Bazaar which we love too, but Jaleo has a more casual upbeat ambience that suits us so well).

And it's our first stop at the Food Crawl, where we parked ourselves at the Bar (no reservations necessary) and thus started an evening of debauchery and culinary mayhem....

The first to do upon arrival arrive is to get a carafe of their Sangria, it's the best ever- it's got hints of Cinnamon and even Apples in it!  It's lighter than most and has just a clean finish to it (Sangria has a tendency to be either sickenly sweet or harsh from the cheap Wine) neither which you will get when you order Sangria form Jaleo.  It's memorable and quite addictive; forever ruining Sangria ordered anywhere else..

Pan con Tomate y Jamon Serrano: A classic Spanish dish and great way to open up your taste buds is the Toasted Bread with Tomatoes on top with Serrano Ham, drizzled with a touch of Spanish Olive Oil. The heavenliness is in the crunchy carbs married with soft, acidic texture and creaminess of fat. it sates all senses and leaves the appetite wanting more...

To balance the meal a bit, we ordered a Salad, the Remolacha con Citricos: Salad of Red Beets + Citrus +La Peral Cheese + Pistachios + Sherry Dressing.  The salad was balanced and harmonious with that unique flavor that Beets have with a mild acidity that was pleasant.

A great little dish to get at Jaleo is the Mixed Olives, Aceitunas Rellenas y Aceintunas Ferran Adria:  Olives stuffed w/ Anchovy + Piquillo and Ferran Adria Liquid Olives.  This little number is awesome with drinks; salty, briny and bathed in luxurious Olive Oil, both traditional and avant grade version entertain the palate, as wells the mind.

There are so many dishes at Jaleo that are so awesome and deserve special recognition; the Sunday Roasted Pig and the Lobster Paella to name a few.  But due to timing issues, we weren't able to order those, so the highlighted dish is a special favorite in the seafood category, Calamares en su Tinta: Basque style Squid Stew with Ink.  I'm a firm believer that that this may be the best, softest Squid that I have ever had; the Ink sauce was so savory in conjunction with the lime colored concoction which I wasn't' able to recognize, but relished it with fervor. I can't say I remember it with Ramps and Micro Greens but it's added value in any case.

It was truly hard to tear ourselves away from Jaleo, but we were on a mission to explore and more needed to be done.  So down the hatch with our last sip of Sangria and moved On To The Next One (Hold up freeze. Somebody bring me back some money please....)",NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A,1,1,5,5Ztnfl115dhZDxPmedyn2w

And the jamon Iberico- how can so much flavor be packed into molecule-thin slices. We experimented with how tiny a bit we could dissect out and still get the wow: almost invisible bits still sparking savory deliciousness. 

Paella rotates depending upon the whim of the chef; two types are always available. This is a bit problematic, as we have missed the seafood paella 3 times, but it does allow proper preparation in a HUGE pan over an open fire by a dedicated paella preparer or two. Thus, whatever type they make is worthy.

We were seduced by the anytime availability of several types of paella at Julian Serrano, and learned that it's just not as good that way.

The food also inspired me to visit the bazaar in LA. If you're in LA, check it out -- I think it's even better than Jaleo.

For example, the staple of tapas restaurants, the patatas bravas -- hard to describe, but included not only the traditional tomato-based sauce, but also a sort of creme part -- you'll see it when you try. But the real standout was the ensalada rusa. My dining companion, a Spanish literature PhD who has lived in Spain for months at a time, said it was the best she'd ever tasted. 

Excellent food and excellent service. But there was another aspect of the dinner that I have to comment on.

On a Saturday night in midsummer, being at this restaurant is not just a dining experience, but a theatrical experience as well. As anyone who goes to Las Vegas on a weekend quickly realizes, it's sort of like Comic-Con if Comic-Con were about cisgendered displays: everyone is in a costume, of sorts, that emphasizes the degree to which they feel they best express their gender identity. And this was just as true at this restaurant as on the sidewalks of the Strip. Seated in the dining area were a number of pre-bridal parties of all men and all women, each displaying to the max their gender certifiers and clique behaviors. One party of 16 women seated at a long table, headed by a young woman in a bridal veil (!) wearing a freaking BANNER that said ""BRIDE-TO-BE,"" was described by my dining companion as ""the Last Supper staged as a quinceañera."" Watching them gab to one another, take pictures and selfies, stare at their phones for the results, give each other fond (or cutting) looks, was fascinating. This was merely the largest party of costumed youths.

First thing I wanna say is its a very nice resto. When they lead you to your table, you will pass the station where they cook those expensive paellas. We got the Eggplant Malaga style ($9), Rossejat ($20), Gambas Al Ajillo ($16), and Spanish Flan with 'espuma' of Catalan cream and oranges ($12). The eggplant dish was pretty much 3 donuts stuffed with eggplant and honey drizzled over. It tasted good but paying 9 bucks is way overpriced. The Rossejat was like (filipino reference alert) pancit with small shrimp and a spoonful of mayo. It tasted ok but I wouldn't order that again. The Gambas were best tasting with the garlic and tomato sauce. The sauce was so good that I had to use the complimentary to finish it (hey, it was $16). The flan was good with the oranges and something crunchy that they put on the cream to give the dish some crispy texture. Would I come back again? Yes I would but only to try the paellas.

We ordered the anchovies which were on some Spanish bread, grilled lamb, bacon wrapped dates, a tiny plate of paella to sample, the roast pig and my absolute favorite the egg and cavier!

Now given that Jaleo is at the Cosmopolitan on the strip, I was already anticipating high prices. What I didn't anticipate was: finding it difficult to find the restaurant since it wasn't marked well at all, very tiny portions for what they charged, and no sensitivity to food allergens. 

First off, it took my group a bit to find the place, with the restaurant not marked properly. Our confusion was resolved when we stumbled on it and they told us we had arrived. We only saw markings for China Poblano, so the confusion never really went away. 

After we sat down and started reviewing the menu, we started asking the waitress questions about the menu. Thankfully we brought up my allergy to shell fish because the whole fried section of the menu was hands off, even if items didn't have shell fish in it. Turns out they fry everything in the same oil - chicken, dates, shrimp... not a best practice they should continue. 

The dishes I was able to eat were good, but honestly, the dishes did not go far at all. Due to the fact I was expecting a nicer atmosphere and not having half the menu eliminated from eating because of the frying issue, the lack of food on the small plates really through this place over the edge for me. I would definitely recommend other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan over this one: Holstein's - excellent burgers, Comme Ca - excellent french bistro and STK - good steakhouse.",utb6bhr1Fx7_Z5hZnPq_dQ,3,1,2,WermvVx1eCf4t0GXGgy4zw

Place is very open speed and nicely decorated. Ambiance is very hip and casual. Nice place to grab drinks or a small bite before heading out for the night. 

Service:
This is where they really suffered. Within a span of 5 minutes, we had three different servers come over to go over the menu with us and ask our drink order. We were very confused because after the first server, we thought that was our server and gave her the drink order. So to have two more people come by showed they had no sense on anything about the tables. The crazy part was it continued throughout the night. I swear we had seven different servers!! The communication between them was terrible because they had no idea about what we ordered and our orders were all messed up!
The dinner should have taken two hours tops - ended up being a three hour dinner as we sat there waiting for food we had ordered at start of the meal. 
They comped our desserts and drinks because of the delay in the orders and mess ups - which was very nice of them. 


Food:
We ordered a ton of food! The food here is fantastic! Especially after just coming back from Barcelona, Spain. I appreciated the food so much more!

Sangria - good

Tomato Bread - Bomb

Ham, goat cheese, fig bread - Bomb!

Beet salad - Great!

Scallops - Delicious! 

Shrimp - Awesome!

Dates - Bomb!

Seafood croquettes - Meh, not my favorite

We paired that with a cheese plate that had some goat cheese (dont knock it till you try it) along with some bleu cheese and fruit, absolutely delicious!

They don't fill water to the top of the glass, and the glasses are rather average sized for water glasses so that kinda sucks.
Wines/drinks are pricey for the 'most part.'
Our waiter, while initially attentive, after we placed our order, we did not see him towards the end of our meal.  We would have ordered another bottle of slightly overpriced wine, if we had seen him.  Their loss.  
Chicken wings were nothing special.  Bar food chicken wings are on average, better tasting.
Seating arrangements are not the most comfortable, as for most of our night, we were seated pretty close to two other couples.  We made friends though, but in the event we had not, it would have been more of a con.

Pros:
Great variety of wine.
Great food, especially the caviar on organic egg.
Had a few 6 dollar glasses of wine (white and red) options.  We opted for a 30 dollar bottle of wine, which was quite good.
Modern and energetic. 
Quick getting to our seats, friendly host.
Some decently priced food options in comparison to other restaurants at the Cosmopolitan/like-restaurants.

While at first glance, it looks like more cons than pros, the great food really made it 4 stars.  Fun experience to try new food and not feel craycray for ordering 6 menu items for 2 people.

Luckily there was no more delay to getting us seated at this busy, loud restaurant. Our waitress was very informative and was great at letting us know what was and wasn't available for the evening.

Croquetas de pollo (Traditional chicken fritters) - this arrived in a shoe. Yes - a shoe. Aside from the quirky presentation, the fritters were delicious - creamy and comforting, as if someone took a chicken stew and fried it up into fritter bits!

Bikini de jamón ibérico, queso Manchego y trufas (Pressed sandwich of ibérico ham, manchego cheese and truffles) - honestly, none of us said a thing while eating this. It was good, but we were probably expecting a little more. It felt too simple.

Caña de cabra con highs ((Murcia) A soft, semi-sweet goat's milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam) - I could've eaten a whole log of this cheese on a whole loaf of the walnut break with a whole jar of that jam.

Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón (Salmon tartare and salmon roe cone) - another favorite that stood out from the rest! Strong and fresh with a great combination of textures!

Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota Paella (Made with the ribs of the legendary, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain) - This plate was meant for 2, but really it would be for 1. Luckily it was enough for all of us to get a good taste of the flavorful rice, mushrooms and pork!

In fact, I was really surprised to see some of the items I've had at the Bazaar  on the menu at Jaleo.
The waitress recommended that we order 2-3 dishes per person; we had 4 girls, and this is what we ordered:

1. Tortilla de Patata: Spanish omelet with onions and potatoes. Really fluffy omelet.  My friend who loves Spain and Spanish food really enjoyed it, especially since she has had such a hard time finding traditional Spanish Tortillas here in the States.

2. Garlic Shrimp: The sauce was really good, but this dish wasn't all that memorable

3. Patatas Bravas: Jose's version of this traditional Spanish bar food. Basically potato chips topped with spicy tomato sauce and garlic alioli. Really delicious combinations of flavors and textures.

4. Croquetas de pollo:  Chicken fritters SERVED IN A REAL SHOE! just like the Bazaar used to. I was so disappointed to learn that the croquetas at the Bazaar came in 'fake' shoes now. So i was so excited to see these come in a real shoe! The croquetas were AMAZING as well.

5. Rossejat: A paella type dish with pasta, shrimp and squid. Served with an amazing garlic alioli. Definitely comparable to the Rossejat at the Bazaar.

6. Grilled Quail: served with a really great apple puree and pinenuts.

7.Bikini de jamón Ibérico, 
queso manchego y trufas: Pressed sandwich with iberico ham, manchego cheese, and truffles. BEST THING WE HAD ALL NIGHT!

8. Olive Oil Ice Cream: Another dish that is also served at the Bazaar. Really interesting combo of flavors. Highly recommend it for adventurous palates and grapefruit lovers. 

9. Sangria: Great, but nothing I haven't had before.

2508535,2012-07-29,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I hate to say this about any restaurant, but hands down this the worst overpriced food I have ever eaten. 

A friend and I had reservations for a late (9 p.m.) dinner on a Saturday night. We were a bit late, but were seated promptly anyway. The place was PACKED ... and really, really loud. We were led to a small table near the back of the restaurant.

Service was prompt and our waiter, Mario, was friendly. He offered a few suggestions, and really seemed to be pushing the (pricey, $56) Arroz a banda con bogavante (AKA lobster paella). So we bit, along with an order of the Croquetas de pollo (chicken fritters served in a tennis shoe), a Berenjenas con miel de cañal estilo Malagueño (fried eggplant), and Vieiras con salsa de romesco (seared scallops), washed down with a half -carafe of the house sangria. 

The server had warned us that the paella could take about a half hour to make and that we should prepared to wait. Meanwhile, he poured the sangria, which was absolutely yummy. Much to our surprise, the paella arrived within 10 minutes of ordering - ahead of the other dishes. Also surprising: It was barely warm, was full of charred bits and contained very little lobster (yes, there are three lobster parts presented on the plate, but they contained only a small amount of meat, which also seemed a bit undercooked). For $56, this was an absolute disappointment. We didn't even finish the dish. 

The rest of the plates arrived within 15 minutes. The chicken fritters looked promising. But, when I bit into one of the piping hot finger-shaped fritters, I was met with a molten, smooth, tan filling inside. The only thing I can compare it to was the consistency of pureed, jarred baby food (and it kind of tasted like that, too). I actually had to wait for the fritters to cool down a bit, which firmed up the consistency and at least made them more palatable. But overall, they were just gross. Revolting, actually. I'm cringing as I write this just thinking about them again. 

Same went for the eggplant: Lightly breaded (as the menu describes) they are not. The batter used to fry them was obviously thick, almost like a tempura batter (which is what the four, half-moon pieces looked like - puffy and large). Again, when hot, the eggplant was almost molten and oozed out of the breading. In no way did it resemble eggplant. Again, it firmed up upon cooling a bit, but was still sort of weird. 

The scallops (all two of them, for $15) were pretty, but I'm not sure they were entirely cooked in the center. They felt kind of mushy, which was not appetizing. 

By far, the best plate of the evening was dessert: Flan al estilo tradicional de mamá Marisa con espuma de crema Catalana (classic flan), which was one of the best interpretations of the dish that I've ever had. The flan was velvety smooth, reminiscent of panna cotta. It was garnished with a vanilla-bean whipped cream and a small scoop or orange sorbet. I could have eaten that all night. 

But a woman cannot live on flan alone! Which is why I would not ever consider returning to this restaurant. The food was terribly disappointing. And unless you're into shouting your entire dinner conversation while feeling as though you're trapped in a sardine can, the ambiance leaves something to be desired.",ETm310CbrUN9MJ5is7_gaQ,3,0,1,73tykJCHFNKoDNeHoDwRhg

Jaleo was magnificent.  I loved the modern vibe, the wood-burning fireplace, and the atmosphere in general.  Even though I was a bit jet-lagged (we had just arrived earlier that day), my taste buds were awakened by the culinary masterpieces we experienced in tapas form.  

The fried eggplant with a drizzle of honey had a delightful texture and were unexpectedly good.  I never thought that vegetable would be so good in a zeppole-like incarnation but it worked.  We had a savory spinach dish (I forget the name) which was quite good, but was outshined by the goat cheese with a bread that reminded me of Eli's raisin pecan crisps.  I wish I could have that for dinner tonight, but such is life.  The paella, our final small plate, had both rabbit and chicken, and was flavorful and not overly oily.  I tried a bite of the flan with oranges for dessert, which also did not disappoint.

There's a lot of choices at Jaleo so be glad that it's tapas. The portions aren't huge so I'd suggest ordering at least 2 plates per person. I remember the paella, croquettas, and steak being delicious, but everything else was great too.

Our experience was brought to the next level because of our excellent waiter, Justin, who explained the menu to us and made great recommendations. He finished our dinner by giving the bday boy a porron. If you don't know what that is, Google it up! In short, it's a flask with a spout that you try to drink out of while keeping the porron as far away from you as possible. We had so much fun with the porron the rest of the night!

We love us some Spanish tapas and if it's a José Andrés joint, you'd think the chances are high that it would be outstanding, right?  Well, not so much.  It was.....underwhelming at best.  Food really was average and not exciting.  Here's what we had:

Pan de cristal con tomate: similar to a bruschetta - it was a bit on the salty side

Coca con erizos de mar: interesting combination of uni and bacon but didn't blow our minds

San Simón con garapiñado de frutos secos: good cheese but didn't really pick up the smokiness; nicely combined with the brittle though!

Jamón ibérico Fermin:  deliciously porky and oily, just like a good jamon should be

Chistorra envuelta en patata frita: solid but nothing extraordinary; the chorizo was nice and spicy

Datilés con tocino 'como hace todo e mundo':  honesty, I've had far tastier iterations of bacon-wrapped dates 

Pulpo a feira Maestro Alfonso: this octopus dish was cooked perfectly but...lacked any noticeable flavor.  Almost like it was not really seasoned.

We were provided two additional plates compliments of the chef but I cannot remember exactly what they were.  Funny enough, they were the highlights of the meal along with the flan and pan con chocolate we had for desserts.

In the end, we just felt the ""wow"" flavors weren't there.  And at a fairly high price point, we expected more.  Service was professional and personable but uneven.  The attentiveness could have been a bit more especially considering we were there at 5 PM and there weren't many customers.

I still have to admit, the food was freakin' spectacular! And there was entertainment, and people watching, and flames! Every time a Paella was ordered they rang a bell and yelled out PAELLA!!!!!!! 
Between my boyfriend and I, we shared about 7 small plates, and I probably could have added 3 or 4 more, but I knew our bill was already at about $150 with our $5 sprites and $6 shirley temples. I had to try it when they said it was ""homemade grenadine"". Good, but not $6 good. 
On the menu, all of the dishes are in Spanish and some are a bit confusing, but the staff is super helpful and knowledgeable. A couple that stood out to me were the stuffed roasted red peppers with goat cheese, the garlic shrimp, and the chicken croquettes served in a shoe. There was not anything I tried, that I would not eat again. My only complaint is the prices. $20 for 2 scallops? I get it. Were at the Cosmo, it's a Jose Andres restaurant, but I want to come here and be able to drop $100 including a tip and have my other half and I leave stuffed. That will never happen. 
So yes, it is good, yes you will enjoy yourself. It is simply a matter of opinion if it's worth it to you. To me, places like this should have locals specials, or a local night. At the same time, maybe they don't want to cater to us locals. They have enough going for them to live off tourism.

Lucky enough to snag a reservation for 12 on short notice (thank YOU, Jose), we traipsed in to Jaleo and put our trust in the server's hands.

For the most part, that was a good idea.  He concocted a tapas tasting menu of literally ten plus courses, including the best of the best (marinated mussels, fried bacon-wrapped dates, and pesto-infused monkfish) and some not-so-standout (fried eggplant, goat cheese-dappled endive, and fried shrimp were all just OK).

Top this off with two - TWO! - lobster courses (an incredible steamed version with jasmine foam and marinara, and a decent-but-nothing-to-write-home-about seafood paella) and we were stuffed, satiated, and impressed.  The sparkling white sangria, though a bit light for a cocktail of its own, paired well with the salty and spicy foods throughout the meal.

If you have a big group of adventurous (read: willing to eat raw, spicy, seafood, cured meats, and any arrangement of vegetables) eaters, you will NOT miss with Jaleo.

2598010,2011-02-13,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"ATMOSPHERE // The environment itself is quite top notch, but that's more of a compliment to the hotel, not the restaurant. The slick idiosyncrasy of The Cosmopolitan continues through Jaleo. I loved all the design details from the typographic front gates to the piecework bull mounted on the wall and chicken tots served in a shoe (surprisingly cute and not gross idea). If you're lucky enough to have arrived with good company as I did, the restaurant's open layout and interesting tidbits allows for a good night of rousing conversation. My own party aside, I found the dining staff to be quite full of themselves, or rather, brainwashed by the supposed amazingness and sadly mislead by what a standard portion size is. I give them part of the blame for setting false customer expectations.

FOOD // The food really fell short of 3-stars. I've been to different small-plate kind of eateries before and Jaleo neither measured up for it's priciness in ingenuity nor taste. We took a while to figure out what to order because we were informed by our group of comrades who had a reservation before we did that the portions were fantastically small and the food not all that great. One friend honestly, and repeatedly, told us to get up and flee the place before it was too late. Could it really be that bad?
sangria :: This was a good choice. Served with fresh slice of citrus, chunk o' watermelon, and some mint. And one will need some amount of vino to make up for everything else. 
lobster paella :: We expressed concerns about hunger satisfaction so the waiter suggested the paella as a good way to fill up. The lobster paella had good flavors, but was rather salty (like most of the food). 
fried bacon wrapped dates :: Bacon wrapped anything is always good and ever better when it's deep fried. 
chicken fritters :: They're like tater-tot sized pot pies. 
garlic soup :: This was the worst. It tasted like you took the packet of Chicken Top Ramen seasoning and poured it into a cup of lukewarm water and then dropped an egg in there. The waitress gushed about how the egg is cooked at exactly 63 degrees and gave me a stony stare when she caught me rolling my eyes. I apologize that your soup sucked. 
chilled almond & garlic soup :: Interesting combination of flavors. Much better than the other soup, but that isn't saying much. 
kurobuta pork jowls & scallops :: I ordered this and it was microscopic for $14. A few slivers of unmemorable pork and maybe half a scallop total. I can get this for $6 at a Japanese izakaya. 
desserts :: We ordered 3 with components like olive oil ice cream, flan, and chocolate mousse. Again, nothing I think is worth mentioning. Do we sense a pattern?

All in all, the food didn't impress me in any way, especially factoring in the price and portion size. We had a party of 7 and with 2 carafes of sangria, 3 paellas, plus about 10 small plates, it ended up being $51/person. Jaleo is like dating a rich bitch: she may look nice and spout esteem, but it's all shallow and will set you back more money than it's worth.

The menu is vast, covering over 75 items across meat and cheese plates, land, sea, fried items and paella. Paella are made in a separate paella pit within the main dining room, allowing all diners to watch an impressive display while the paellas cook. Apparently the ventilation system alone cost $1 million, preventing all of the smoke from suffocating diners. Clearly, paella is serious business.

I've dined at restauarant-within-the-restaurant é by Jose Andres and left impressed. This would be my first visit to Jaleo proper.


Butifarra Casera Esparracada homemade pork sausage stew with mushrooms and pearl onions
Carne Asada Con Piquillos 'julián De Lodosa' grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit
Chorizo Casero Con Puré De Patatas Al Aceite De Oliva homemade traditional chorizo with olive oil mashed potatoes and cider sauce
Setas Al Ajillo Con La Serena sautéed wild mushrooms with la serena potato purée
Tortilla De Patatas Clásica spanish omelet with potatoes and onions
Coliflor Con Olivas Y Frutos Secos sautéed cauliflower with dates and olives
Croquetas De Pollo traditional chicken fritters
Costillas De Cordero Con Romesco grilled lamb ribs with romesco sauce and green onions
Empanadillas De Brandada De Bacalao 'empanada' of cod brandade with honey
Arroz Con Costillas De Cerdo Ibérico De Bellota made with the ribs of the famous, black-footed ibérico de bellota pig
José's Tuna Salad a salad of preserved tuna, mayonnaise, shallots and hard boiled eggs on flauta bread
Flauta bread brushed with fresh tomato, extra virgin olive oil and Jamón Ibérico
Gambas Al Ajillo the very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic
Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco seared scallops with romesco sauce

My favorite dish had to be the lamb ribs, imbued with a nice smoky flavor. Tender and kind of fatty, these went down easily with the subtle heat of the romesco. Another favorite was the chicken fritters served in a shoe (fun yet awkward). Crispy on the outside and hot and fluffy on the inside, these had a delicious chicken and potato flavor to them. The skirt steak carne asada was another popular item at the table, with the tender piece of steak complemented well by sweet piquillo peppers. The paella had a bunch of very crispy bits from the pan (slightly controversial among the family), but I liked the texture and depth of flavor it brought to the dish. Overall I liked the paella, but I wanted more meat - the few pieces we had were on the bony side.

Less successful was the flauta with jamon iberico. The bread was very chewy (felt kind of stale) and the prized ham got lost in the mix. The Spanish omelette was another I wouldn't order again; the egg-potato-onion mix was a little bland and boring.

We shared a couple of desserts to complete the meal.

Flan Al Estilo Tradicional De Mamá Marisa Con Espuma De Crema Catalana a classic spanish flan with 'espuma' of catalan cream and oranges
Pastel De Chocolate Y Avellanas chocolate cake with hazelnut praline ice cream and salted caramel sauce

Both desserts were simple and satisfying. The very light flan, scented with vanilla bean, was my favorite and an appropriate end to the Spanish meal. Chocolate lovers wouldn't be disappointed by the chocolate cake, however.

I found the meal at Jaleo to be good. Nothing stood out as extraordinary, but the restaurant offered a good to way sample a bunch of different Spanish flavors. I'm not sure I'd return for a full meal, but it's a great place for a few drinks/bites before heading to the club (Marquee) or a show.",WhCtEF8OyymlwMLDiIffMg,1,1,3,DiboTuxcVL0kiD6MfjwsPA

It didn't taste anything special and the meat just tasted like random meat with no foie gras in it. Boring dish in terms of flavor

Setas Al Ajillo Con La Serena (sautéed wild mushrooms with la serena potato purée) - This could have been a MUCH better dish if it wasn't over seasoned. Way too salty.

The only critique I have is that service is sometimes unpredictable. I've even had waiters be really attentive at the beginning of the meal, and then disappear half way through.

Ordered 4 dishes and we had to return one of the dishes (Rossejat negra con Cigala) because it was simply inedible. The others were still generally very salty although we were too hungry to pass up. But we are currently regretting the decision because almost 12 hours later, we are still parched from the amount of sodium in our systems. You know it's not just us when the customers sitting next to you are complaining about the same thing and returning their dishes, too. 

2. GENERALLY HORRIBLE COOKING. Saltiness aside, the food was generally not made well. 
(a) Brussel sprouts were torn apart into pieces and presented with citrus fruits as a summer-y salad type dish. Cute efforts, bad execution. The pairing failed and I was left with one of the most weird Brussel sprouts ever. 
(b) Paella rice was 3/4 of the way done and so some portions of the rice were crunchy and undercooked... If you are a tapas place, you'd think paella is like their bread and butter...
(c) Salad was way too sweet and the dressing was almost like some kind of fruit juice or syrup...
(c) Lobster? What lobster? When one of the dishes with lobster came out, we were presented the skinniest pieces of ""shrimp"" that had almost zero edible parts, that was way below the acceptable level of any shell fish presentation. Apparently Norwegian lobsters are supposed to be small and skinny, but still I think the Yelpers should be informed that this should be their expedition: hardly any meat.

We left the restaurant still really hungry but not able to go get other food due to extremely salty internal situations... Sad.",vH24B5ijlRMcG2rt405L9w,3,1,1,I53N5rhwXkfNRw6oOPpLfg

My sandwich of manchego cheese and jamon iberico was okay, but I had better in Spain where I used to go at least twice a year.  My niece ordered the veggie sandwich, and all it had was a sliver of wilted lettuce (for $18!).  The service was non-attentive.  We figured because we did not order cocktails like the waiter was suggesting.  I was embarrassed because my niece was visiting from out-of-state, and I was the one who suggested Jaleo.

2751770,2017-11-14,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I've been here numerous times because (being born in Spain,) I've never found a Spanish restaurant aside from Jaleo that offers authentic recipes without putting some type of American twist on it. Also, Jaleo is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas so I make sure that every time I'm in town I make a visit. 
Atmosphere is really cool, I love their bench seating and I love that the restaurant is conveniently across the escalator when you reach the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan. The restrooms are out of the restaurant around the corner and down the hallway so it's best to make sure you go before or after you go eat. 
Service has always been decent. Best service I've received goes to Mary because she always does an amazing job and really makes a difference in your experience. This last time I went, I had another waitress named Kristin and I'm not sure what happened but she decided to not come back to our table entirely. Not sure if she forgot about our group but she was still in the restaurant serving others. There wasn't even a manager on staff to fix the problem so that was my only bad experience here.
Now to the important part, the food! Come here if you want authentic Spanish food. I always order the Gambas a la Jillo (Garlic sautéed shrimp) and the Chicken Croquettes. The shrimp used to be better the first few times I had it because they used to add some type of tomate sofrito (refried tomato) and that recipe was amazing. Now it's just the big garlic shrimp and a small long loaf of bread. Chicken croquettes come in a shoe (it's what they do here) and they are pretty spot on if you've eaten them in Spain. 
Note: tapas are SMALL so it's best to order a few of what you want. If you want a huge plate of food you can go hit a buffet but I assure you, authentic Spanish recipes can't be beat and Jose Andres has done a great job at keeping authenticity.",lpu6r3sdT9zpiFTITBFKsw,0,0,4,iEWYEida792er9-g34dJKA

The service could have been a little more friendly, but that's my only complaint.  The wine list comes to you on an iPad, and unfortunately, I'm not a Spanish wine expert, so I picked a Rioja, one I am familiar with.  It was nice and decently priced.  We moved on the the olives - the liquid olives - you HAVE to try them.  They look and taste like Kalamata olives, but they are completely liquified.  GENIUS!

Lynn & I went with her brother, who -- despite living in Vegas -- has never eaten here.  At some point, however, he's learned to turn the ordering over to his big sister and her husband (that would be me), and so off we went . . . 

We were told that the lobster paella would be about 40-45 minutes, so of course we ordered that immediately . . . and it was the first dish to arrive at our table.  Good news:  it arrived within 10 minutes.  Bad news:  it arrived within 10 minutes.  Let me explain:  

I thought I had ordered an array of tapas, salads, etc. and it would culminate with the paella.  Having it arrive first threw the progression of dishes I had in my head out the proverbial window, but the paella was so damned good, who cares???  

Next arrived the plate of green olives stuffed with anchovy and piquillo peppers, and paired with Ferrán Adrià ""olives"" -- little ""balloons"" of liquid (Kalamata?) olives that burst in the mouth, filling you with that wonderful olive deliciousness.  Amazing!  And for someone who deeply regrets never dining at El Bulli, this was a REAL treat!

Served with that was the Selección de embutidos -- a selection of cured meats (Jamón Ibérico de bellota Fermin, Jamón Ibérico Fermin, Jamón Serrano Fermin, Lomo Ibérico de bellota Fermin, and house-made Chorizo Palacios) paired with their Pan con Tomate.  Delicious, flavorful, and indeed somewhat magical.

Next to arrive was the Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego (a sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing) that was crisp, light, refreshing, and very tasty.  

Our waitperson, Samantha, was knowledgeable and helpful, enthusiastic without being artificial in any way.  Based upon her recommendation (""I never eat veal, but this is my favorite thing on the menu!""), we ordered the Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de olive (Veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée).  OMG, she was right!  Rich, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth lusciousness that was so sensual, so . . .,  so close to being over-the-top that, were it any closer, it would be illegal!

Recovering from this silky dish of richness, we moved on to the deceivingly simple sounding Trigueros con romesco (Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce), pencil-thin -- NO, eyebrow pencil-thin asparagus grilled to perfection with romesco that we could have eaten all night long.  Major yums!

Finally, we had Rape a la Donostiarra (Monkfish with garlic, Sherry and parsley oil).  Again, deceptively simple in name, but don't let that stop you.  Normally, I'm one of those people who don't ""get"" monkfish (aka ""the poor man's lobster"").  It's never seemed like lobster to me, and most of the times when I've had monkfish in the past, it's been overcooked and rather bland.  But this . . . THIS was OUTSTANDING!  Truly, the best monkfish I've ever had, and a dish I already want to have again!  Thinly sliced pieces of monkfish delicately poached (sous vide?) with just a hint of garlic and sherry, and a drizzle of parsley oil . . . this was THE dish-of-the-night, and the perfect dish to end our meal on!

Well, OK, with had José Andres' grandmother's flan.  This, too, was the best flan I've ever had in my life!

They have a great selection of Spanish wines, too.  (They have wines from elsewhere, but to be honest, I didn't look.)

To top it off, we were seated in a private room that had spotlights on each of the place settings, so it felt like we were in an interrogation room. Weirdly, those were the only lights in the room that couldn't be dimmed.

Now if you're not crazy about Spanish food, it might not be your cup of tea.  There are a lot of strong flavors, often coaxed out of simple ingredients.  Maybe they are to your taste; maybe not.  But if they are, it is well worth finding out, because a meal like this isn't easy to find this side of Madrid or Barcelona.

We went for restaurant week which, at Jaleo, meant a tasting menu.  Yes, each of the ten dishes served was a small portion, but that's how it is supposed to be.  Hey, have you never heard of the French Laundry?  Or even tapas?  I won't try to describe each dish, except to say that 8 of the 10 were absolutely first rate.  Strangely, one of the exceptions was the Paella, which really should have been the specialty of the house.  The Paellas are being cooked with evident pride over an open fire oven in the middle of the restaurant, and I was looking forward to the dish.  Unfortunately, the rice did not have the crunchy-chewy texture that socarrat is supposed to have, and the (entirely) vegetarian ingredients were a bit mushy.  The other disappointment was the Sangria Ice dessert, which was extremely tart and not at all what you would expect when you take your first bite.  Well, hey, that's what happens sometimes when you have a tasting menu - you get something a bit unexpected.

The ambiance is obviously targeting fun, rather than than romance or class.  The room is pretty open, and the small tables are packed a bit tight.  The room was less than half full while we were there, but if it filled up it would have been pretty crowded and pretty noisy.  The wait staff knew their stuff, and they needed to since some items on the menu were probably unfamiliar to many patrons.

Jaleo had excellent presentation and a trendy atmosphere.  The room was loud with many people dressed up in preparation for Marquee.  I was excited to try this place out, especially with how crowded it was.  (I usually figure if it's crowded, it has to have good food, right?)

mmm, the food was decent, but it did dispel my theory on crowded places.  Sad face.

So let's start off with a dish by dish play:

Pan de cristal con tomate
This is their bread with tomato sauce.  The bread came out and it wasn't that hot (perhaps it was their intent?  I'm not sure).  I guess I like my bread hot.

Chistorra envuelta en patata frita
Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato.  Okay, this was tasty.  The potato helps to add texture to the dish.  

Canelones de cerdo y foie con bechamel
This dish had foie gras in the center, which provided a rich and creamy flavor.

Lomo de buey con Valdeón*
Okay... here's my complaint.  This basically tasted like any random piece of meat.  It wasn't anything special.  Both the cooking and the meat quality seemed out of place.

Gambas al ajillo
The shrimp was solid in terms of quality, but the sauce was a little underwhelming.  

The sangria
This was really sad... it tasted like sprite.  I was expecting great sangria, especially at a tapas restaurant.

Overall, this was an interesting place.  They have tables outside of the restaurant (side of the hostess stand) that actually double as a Foose Ball table!  Everything we ordered was pretty good. 

Tips:
* A must order is the Veal cheeks and morels.  It was absolutely amazing!!
* Order the chicken fritters and be ready for an interesting surprise.  I don't wanna ruin it for you...all I'll say is that the presentation is one of kind!  
* Park / Enter through the East side elevators.  It takes you straight to the restaurant floors and Jaleo is conveniently right there =)",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,1,0,4,r6t7vqU3iYShNkJXSNRFgw

-Octopus- 3 star (tender but slimy texture, flavor just ok)
-Shrimp- 4.5 stars ( tasty and good size shrimp)
-Skirt steak 4.5 stars (very flavorful)
-paella with Short rib and oyster mushrooms? 4.5 stars (flavorful but not the typical paella, meat kinda chewy but but tasty still).

A very important note. One of Jaleos most popular items is Aceitunes Rellenas y acietunes 'Ferrante Adrià'.

-chix croquettes served in a shoes - bleh
-paella which was beef and mushrooms - superb
-lamb ribs - im not a big fan of lamb but this was phenom
-i know we got like 3-4 more dishes but i can't remember. the paella was awesome though but ask for it ahead of time as it takes time and it varies. i also love the seating and lay out of the place. not stuffy at all

We feasted on:
1) squid ink pasta (more like vermicelli) with lobsters. The lobster was tasty, but it's the squid ink pasta that stole the show. I would've licked the pan clean if I hadn't been in public.

2) panne con tomate with anchovies. You don't like anchovies, you say? Are you scrinching your nose at the thought of anchovies? These are not the anchovies that come in a can. These are fresh, slightly salty, and give a nice depth of flavor to the traditional tomato toast.

3) Salad: fennel, walnuts, apple, and manchego cheese. A great start to our dinner. Would be good between the plates too, b/c it was kind of a palate cleanser. 

4) cheese plate: we got 1 creamy and 2 hard cheeses. I don't remember the names, but the creamy served with the fig raisin toast was by far the best one. you have to eat these cheeses with the paired garnish.

5) Paella: GET SOME. You don't come to a place with the only fire paella pit stand in the US and not get the paella. This is what you smell when you walk by this restaurant and why you came. You should come with a larger group so you can order a few paellas. Ours was a mushroom, roasted suckling pig paella. Mushrooms and pork were great, but again, I just wanted to eat the tender yet crunchy rice.

6) Dessert: My taste buds were done by this point; they had been overwhelmed by the above offerings. Or maybe the flan, served with creme fraiche and lemon sorbet, was too delicate to stand out after all the rich flavors that came before.

It may have been my first foray into exquisite modern style dining.  It was the perfect place to begin eating in the upper echelon.  The service was fast and the atmosphere was up tempo.  

I had the Lobster Paella.  Phenomenal!  A whole lobster on your plate with cuttle fish & chorizo.  The spices were definitely shipped from Espana.  

La Sirena con membrillo was a small cone that tasted like some kind of creamy and slightly tarty cheese that I've never tried before.  

Salmon crudo huevas salmon cones were a trip.  A salty poppy crisp from a tiny little cone shaped treat.  It fooled you because it looked like a raspberry ice cream cone but had such an umami flavor that lingers and matures into something you'll remember fondly.

At the time there was a Sea Urchin dish that had a raspberry foam.  Wow now that was a first!  Creamy oceanic Uni mixed with a light and frothy pink sweetness.  Woah!  Hope they still have that on the menu..

We had some Salmon Cream Cheese Rangoons.  They liked to play around with what you're used to and make it otherworldly.  This place was amazing when it first opened.  I don't see many of these dishes on the online menu anymore? 

Another one not on the menu anymore was a braised lamb rack.  Savory and buttery tender perfect.  

There were Crab meat Stuffed Peppers.  Also some strange olive oil pur'e horderves.  The entire experience was mind expanding.  Your taste buds will never be the same.

I must admit, organizing a group dinner for about 20 people in a city I don't live in sounded like a daunting task once my boss placed that duty in my lap. But I received phenomenal service from start to finish while planning and executing our business event at Jaleo, The Group Sales Staff at The Cosmopolitan were all very professional and organized, helping to ease the stress of pulling this whole dinner together in such a short amount of time. A big, huge ""thank you"" shout out to both Kelly and Rose!

And another big round of applause goes out to our server at Jaleo: Mary! She was fantastic and our whole group loved her. Great service, delectable eats, tempting adult beverages, fun ambiance, and the perfect setting for a group. I highly recommend this spot if you are planning a dinner in Vegas. We went with a custom menu that the group sales team put together, and our guests were all very pleased with the 13 courses (yes, thirteen different menu items for everyone to try out) Tapas style of course, but such a great idea to give everyone a good idea of what this restaurant was all about. The cocktails were flowing all night and food felt like it kept coming and coming! 

Below are some of my favorites of the evening that you have to try if you are dining at Jaleo:

The Bramble- best cocktail of all time! No for real, seriously amazing. Cinnamon infused vodka with a cranberry puree. 
Jamon Serrano Fermin- a perfectly flavored 18 month, salt cured Serrano Ham
Endibias con queso - the cutest little app you've ever seen with endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds
Gazpacho- this was served shooter-style and had some kind of amazing dollop of creamy cheese on top (not sure exactly what it was) 
Croquetas de pollo - these little chicken fritters were delish. Served in a shoe which I wasn't too sure about, but really tasty nonetheless
Carne Asada- perfectly cooked and seasoned
Paella- this traditional dish is an ""absolute must"" when dining at Jaleo! They do some kind of crazy chant in the kitchen before these go out to the tables and it gets the whole restaurant excited. They brought it out on this ginormous skillet that took two people to carry it just to show us what it was. But then took it back over to the open kitchen to plate it for us. 
Flan - typically not my favorite type of dessert because of the texture, but this flan was so creamy and I really enjoyed it.

Can't wait to come back to Jaleo! And a big THANK YOU again to all the staff who helped me with the great execution of our group business dinner. CHEERS!",Y78xL2sadoZKiQ1ZH0XUjw,5,4,5,M0GTI0MjjzTJNBLhcLm2dQ

We enjoyed how whenever a version of the paella was done, the chefs would announce it and the crowd of us in the restaurant would yell back, ""PAELLA!"" Pretty fun and the shrimp Paella was one of my favorites that I have had here.
The menu is in Spanish, so don't be hesitant to look at your neighbors and see what they are having and ask them about it. This openly social experience is probably an unintended surprise to the open concept that the designer had cause it gets strangers to talk and not be so introverted or locked into their phones. Or maybe not, but that is what we observed and experienced and I loved it the both times that I had gone.

The menu is broken up into sections, Apps, Fried Items, Charcuterie, (cured meats mainly), Cheeses, Soups, (this I did not try - but plan to), Salads, Specialties, Seafood, Paellas, Meat, large plates, and dessert.  My suggestion is go with a party of at least 2 or more and try to order from all of the sections. In the times that I have gone, we were not able to try the soups of the large plates - but all were still delicious. 

Notables for me were: 

- Patatas bravas 
- Shrimp Paella
- Jamón ibérico Fermín
- Pollo al ajillo y ajo negro
- Carne de ciervo asada

I'm sure there are a couple that are missing but so far, these are go-tos for me.

Chef José Andrés' delivers, as promised, in this Cosmopolitan Las Vegas-based branch of the original Metro Washington DC location, which has earned respect as a local institution.   You might have caught a glimpse of the chef in the Travel Channel's Washington DC episode of No Reservations featuring his exclusive artsy haunt: Minibar.  The chef not only has an incredibly passionate streak for quality ingredients, but he truly shines in culinary innovation and personality while providing an undeniably eclectic ambience that perfectly compliments the menu.         

The spirit of Spain is infused into every detail without coming across with the superfluous kitsch one may discover at any Strip establishment.   While often busy, and almost impossible to have a quiet conversation, Jaleo offers a dining experience filled with enough energy to keep your attention without pushing you into sensory overload.
    
Jaleo, in short, offers a remarkable mixture of tapas, as well as the expected paellas, a noteworthy selection of Spanish wines, cocktails with character, and a kick-ass sangria.    

Additionally, you will be greeted by enthusiastic and knowledgeable staff with terrific, and timely, presentation.  Created in 1993 by Chef José Andrés, Roberto Alvarez, and Rob Wilder, Jaleo has not only made a name for itself in DC, but it is slowly coming-of-age as a formidable competitor in the Las Vegas dining scene.  Be warned, Jaleo packs enough fiery punch to knock out any other tapas joint in Las Vegas.

I am not exactly sure how or why he gave me said money, but I remember trying to give it back and he consistently refused, eventually the dealer gave me a look that said ""leave, before he starts losing and sobers up.""  So I did.  But what to do with the money?  Well, 100 went into longer term savings, and 100 I decided to blow on a fancy dinner alone.  After wandering the strip looking for a worthy restaurant I stumbled in to Jaleo.
First things first.  Order a gin and tonic, they are amazing.  I was skeptical, given that it is a Tapas restaurant, but do yourself the favor and order one.  I also found myself drinking some wine that was good, but not mind blowing (like the G&T's).
The food is awesome, if you have not been to Spain before order a bunch of dishes from all over the place.  I always recommend paying for pork, and theirs is top notch, definitely the high quality stuff.  I like the Jamon Serrano, but find one that is in your price range and enjoy placing it in your mouth and letting it melt like butter.
Skip the Paella, it looks good and the fire is a neat little bit of flair but I wasn't impressed and found it to be the most overpriced item I ordered.  I can't really remember any of the other dishes I had, but everything else was good to great, with the Ham, and the Gin and Tonic being my stand out favorites and the Paella being good, but not on par with everything else.

Hubby had a margarita drink, strong and yummy, two salmon roe cones for us, I just love that cone! Salty with a lot of flavors in one cone, amazing! 

Sautéed cauliflower, with chopped olives and dates: salty and sweet in one plate, unique taste, very delicious, loved it! 

Seared scallops, with romesco sauce: very tender with strong flavors, we liked it a lot.

Shrimp sautéed with garlic: sooooo good! The garlic in it was amazing, shrimps were tender and delicious.

Garlic soup: it came so late, don't know why? But right at the moment when hubby needed some warm soup, he liked it. 

Skirt steak from the famous black-footed ibérico pigs of spain served with toasted tomato bread, mojo verde and alioli: the portion was huge, good for 2 or 3 people to share, too bad I couldn't eat it, hubby loved it! Juicy, tender, great with the sauces came with it! The bread with tomato spread was so delicious! 

I had a Grey Goose martini twist after gin & tonic, the food was so good, the portions were not even small, especially that skirt steak, hubby couldn't finish it, we had it boxed, didn't want to waste a $60 plate. The tab was $200 ish.

First things first- yes, prices are high in Vegas as it's a tourist location.  Honestly, if you go and visit, there are a lot of places you can go to keep it reasonable- you just have to find them.  :)

That being said, Jaleo isn't someplace I would put in that category.  I LOVE the food here, the atmosphere- everything about it.  For a foodie, it's totally worth the price- but if you're not, maybe eat a large lunch and try just a few plates and have a drink?  No matter which way you go, I highly recommend giving it a try.  Spanish Tapas is such a great way to eat.

Our waitress was amazing, and was extremely helpful in explaining how the menu worked as well as how traditional meals in Spain are enjoyed. We started off with the very confusing drink menu on their i pad- there were so many things listed, we got her advice and let her pick for us.  I had a glass of Cava (spanish sparkling wine) and my partner had two different glasses of spanish reds- all were right on par with what we said we liked. 

We ordered:
Chorizo Palacios-A slightly spicy cured pork sausage seasoned with pimentón and garlic
Sopa de ajo con huevo-Garlic and bread soup with a slow-cooked egg
Chistorra envuelta en patata frita-Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato
Gambas al ajillo-famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic
Codorniz con salsa de romero y alioli de miel-Grilled quail with rosemary sauce
and honey alioli
Salpicón de cangrejo-Jumbo lump crabmeat with cucumbers, peppers, tomatoes, cauliflower and Sherry dressing 

We also had some traditional muscles, and as someone who usually doesn't care for the texture or taste, I could have had only that for my whole meal and died happy!

We arrived at 5p to find an empty bar. We asked the hostess about happy hour, and she said, ""We don't have happy hour. Oh, you saw it on the website? Yeah, I don't know why that's there, the manager knows about it."" The happy hour pricing wasn't the driving force in our going there, but it would have been nice.

We were hungry and wanted a snack and a wine before dinner later, and we have been to other Jose Andres restaurants, including Jaleo in DC, so we went forward with our plan. 

Service at the bar was terrible. We had several different people asking us what we wanted and putting in our order, except they didn't actually put some of the orders in. The bar servers were nice about helping us choose wine and cheese, but were otherwise inefficient. We waited awhile for the cheese plate to come out, then the tomato bread never came. I finally asked one of the people behind the bar if we did order the bread, and she said, oh the other person doesn't seem to have put that in! So now our cheese plate is finished and we're done with our wine, and it's another 5 minutes for the bread to come out. The bread was amazing, but would have been even more amazing if it had been out with the wine and the cheese.

Normally we'd have ordered more food and wine, but the experience at this point was so disappointing, we bagged it and paid the check. $75 for two glasses of wine, 3 pieces of cheese, some glazed popcorn, and bread. We are big tapas fans, so it's not like we don't know that these things add up, and the quality of the food was great, but come on, that was crazy considering we didn't even get good service.

We were late for our reservation but they still accommodated us so that was terrific. Food comes out different times so just be aware when you order something. We thought they forgot a dish but it just came out later but we warned ahead of time. Our waiter, Nelson was great and if I come back in I will  request to have him if I can! Very personable guy!

2975713,2015-05-24,5,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I really hate to give lower than 3 stars but in my opinion Jaleo flavors weren't all that amazing for very high prices, small portions and pretty bleh service. My bestie wanted tapas for her birthday and we decided on Jaleo since none of us had tried them yet. It was pretty easy to get a reservation for Thursday at 9:30. I was thinking it'd be a bit busier because it was leading up to fight weekend but nope! They had a normal steady flow of people. 
Ambiance is cute, a nice place to catch up with friends or family. The atmosphere didn't feel stuffy at all. However, I will say that the spacing between courses felt a little bit too long and when the food came out, all of them could have been a bit warmer. They all were lukewarm. 
As for service, our server was nice, however, he did not offer explaining the menu, did not ask if it was our first time or even talk about the portion sizes. The only thing he did mention was specializing in Gin & Tonic variations on an iPad lol which were $20 each! The menu is very extensive and a bit confusing since all the dishes' names aren't in English! I wish he'd mention what his favorites were. I also saw $55 & $85 chef tasting options available, which I'd like to come back to try.

Cítrico Gin & Tonic $20: Oxley gin, Fever-Tree Mediterranean tonic water, grapefruit, lemon, coriander, mint. The birthday girl got this one but we all got to taste it and geeze, I've had better G&Ts from PT'S! Everyone agreed that no one could taste anything except for the tonic water. We really could not taste ANY of the supposed grapefruit, lemon, etc. And for $20? The flavor should be better than $17 specialty cocktails at the Chandelier Bar. 0/5

Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' $14: Fried bacon-wrapped dates served with an apple-mustard sauce. These were okay, very underwhelming. I'd rather go to Firefly and have their bacon wrapped dates any day. The bacon tasted a little charred and the dates weren't sweet. The mustard sauce was okay, nothing special. 2/5

Mini pepito de ibérico* $8 EACH!: Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon. These were really good! Super flavorful, soft buns and very tender! However, at $8 EACH?! What?! They're not THAT amazing, expecially for how small they were. 4/5

Rossejat' negra con Cigala $27: Toasted pasta, squid ink, sepia sofrito, Norwegian lobster and alioli. This one was my ""favorite"" but again there were some big issues that shouldn't be in a $27 dish. Half of the squid ink pasta was burnt onto the pan that it came in, I know this definitely only had enough to split by 2 people but between the 4 of us, we got basically a tablespoon of squid ink pasta each. Also the body of the super skinny Norwegian Lobster was cut in half but left the claws with no cut so we couldn't even get in them! Flavor was alright but I'll go to RX Boiler Room for his squid ink entree instead for larger portion and more developed flavors. 3/5

Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota $36: Basically the Paella with the pig ribs. I was super excited for this one but was very disappointed. Rib meat was not tender, more on the dry and chewy side and as for flavor, meh. 2/5

Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón $5/cone: Salmon tartare w/ salmon roe on top. These were super good! 4/5

Overall, I still feel bad giving a not so great review after seeing so many people love this place but the whole experience for us was pretty underwhelming and forgettable for basically all areas: specialty drink, food, and service. Maybe we just came at an off night so I want to give this place another chance just for the tasting menus but it probably won't be anytime soon.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,8,7,2,m4fKPmRsVjoj09YNgt2pjg

(and Expensive... but then all strip restaurants are)

This is more like a 3.5 star place.
The service is fantastic but the noise level is a bit too ""energetic""... (aka Loud) so it makes having a conversation a bit hard.

If you can .... and have a group... reserve the private room... it's much more intimate and quieter in there.

We enjoyed a number of Interesting plates.

The white asparagus was quite lovely.... and light.  It was a good veggie starter.

The caviar and egg dish was very good.... rich.... but the caviar is not as rich as one would expect for this dish.

The cold garlic soup was different.... good... but different... the grapes off set the garlic part which is a good contrast.

The spinach was Very Good.... it had bacon and raisins in it... I know... raisins?  Yup... raisins.... loved it.   But then bacon makes everything taste better.... so the raisins were a nice counter balace to the salty.

The veal cheek was also good but not off the charts good like I was hoping.  I wanted melt in your mouth, eye popping good and it wasn't.

The ""pigs in a blanket"" .... sausage wrapped in a potato chip were good .... but not spectacular.  It was like a little weenie rolled in a potato chip.  

The empanada was more like a won ton filled with fishy cream.  Not what I expected at all.... we ate it because it wasn't horrible... but it wasn't all that good either.

Our favorite was the piquillo stuffed with crabmeat.... good flavor and texture. The crab was a contrast yet a complement to the piquillo.

For dessert, we had the Chocolate Flan... it was quite good.  Creamy not overly sweet nor overly rich.  It was a smooth, milky chocolate.  :)",PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg,1,1,3,G2CBr9ziypG6lv8IkCRzFQ

3004865,2011-04-12,4,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Food and alcohol deserve 4 stars - very standard classic spanish/basque tapas executed well, very creative and delicious specialty cocktails.

Ambiance and service deserve 0 stars - overly loud dining room, unnecessarily lazy staff and servers.

For the details - 

Firstly, Jaleo messed up my reservation.  I originally had a res for a party of 6 people @ 6PM on Friday.  I called 3 days prior to change to 8 people @ 7 PM.  I didn't get a confirmation call the day-of which I thought was weird.  Sure enough, they never changed the original reservation and since we were ""an hour late"" when we arrived, they had already given up our table.  They did seat us immediately but had to squeeze us into a table meant for 6 right at the front of the restaurant by the bar and hotel escalators.  Yuck.  And, as noted by many here, the main dining room is certainly loud.

I also think it's ridiculous that they don't answer their phones before dining service begins.  Having to wait til 8PM on the east coast to call and make (and then change) reservations was ludicrous.  This is probably also why they don't call you to confirm.

So, we were seated and the waitress came around to take drink orders and informed us that, in her exact words, ""the kitchen is broken"" and they were doing all the cooking on the grills in the middle of the restaurant, so there were a few dishes that weren't available.  She didn't specifically mention which, of course.

We got our drinks and they were all amazing.  The famous G&T, sangria, some gold sparkly drink, a drink with instructions on how to drink it (dip this into this, then put this in your mouth, then sip this, then do a dance...)

Now, I'm a tapas whore, and the menu at Jaleo is very much standard classic tapas, nothing really out of the ordinary.  So I go to order 6 of the usual suspects for my wife and I.  They couldn't make a single one of them.  Well, what can you make then?  ""Well nothing from this side of the menu or that side of the menu.""  So...let me try again...what CAN you make?

Wound up figuring things out and placing our order, and the tapas started arriving shortly thereafter.  Except the runners kept coming to my side of the long table, saying to me what the dish was, and then putting it down in front of me.  So I had to turn into the waiter, loudly screaming across the table to see who ordered each dish and then passing it down.  I finally got fed up around the 8th plate or so and started forcing the runners to do their job and figure out who ordered each dish so they could place it in front of the right person.  For.every.single.dish.  Ugh.

Also, there were a few dishes we had ordered doubles of that we never received.  

Thank god the food was good.  We probably ordered every dish that was available and none disappointed.  Winner of the night in my book was the lamb ribs.  Fall-off-the-bone delicious.  Other mentionables - patatas bravas were potato chips which was a neat twist, and the romesco sauce had an interesting smokey flavor.  Otherwise, as I said, pretty standard stuff all executed well.",Yc3g0KMp3991QIC4Ot1fxQ,4,4,2,YpUxJ7H3JskQ-zTe5RnFIQ

- poor service from hostesses
- all around a disappointing experience

At the suggestion of a friend, I booked this restaurant to celebrate a friend's 40th bday.  

We thought the ambiance was disappointing -- it felt a little exposed and like a mall food court.  Despite our open table reservation, there was No table ready for us.   The hostesses were obviously holding a table for some VIP group and wouldn't seat us there even though it was sitting empty and we were on-time for our reservation.  

The hostesses were rude.  We could tell they were talking about us after we complained about being seated in the bar (felt like being in the middle of a mall food court!)   Our waiter was wonderful, but the hostesses and bartenders all seemed cranky/unhappy.  

The food was good, but not exceptional.  There are a lot of great restaurants in vegas and I just cannot recommend this one. 

 If however you find yourself there, we loved the mushrooms, the traditional potato/egg dish, both the asparagus and the potatoes in maresco sauce.

The seared squid with ink sauce was tender and not chewy,  the mushrooms with mashed potatoes had this blue cheese puree in it that i thought was genius.

Menu looked identical but it wasn't the same. Some of the stuff I had in DC weren't here and the portion was super small. I remember dining in DC and was completely stuffed and our tab weren't that bad. It seemed the prices were way higher here.

The dishes were good but just really puny for the price. Our server was good but she kept recommending things that were astronomical in price and she got the manipulation down in getting you to believe you had no other choice or that was the right choice.

One of the most disappointing item she recommended was the hand carved jamon iberico. It came as dried puny sliced up ham at $35. It was so not worth it. I had the jamon on the bread before with crushed tomatoes in DC, it was so much cheaper and better. It felt like a snow job in this dessert heat. What a rip. 

Also, we wanted the seafood paella and our server kept saying that wasn't available until an hour later and the one available was the most expensive one $38 which we sadly ordered because we were starving!!!

The atmosphere is really nice. The Cosmo Hotel is very new and contemporary and Jaleo continues that feel. The restaurant is live and has a very fun, energetic atmosphere. There is an open-ness to the restaurant and it blends in with the rest of the hotel (so that you don't feel closed off).

The food (as with other Jose Andres restaurants) does not live up to the hype. The food is definitely not bad, but it is basically slightly above average. I love the tapas (small plates) style of eating, because you can try many dishes. And when you look at the menu, there are sure to be several things that look extremely appetizing.

The two of us had about 6 or 7 dishes. The cones filled with salmon sashimi and topped with salmon roe were very salty. I was expecting those to be better, they were just okay.

The Brussels sprout salad was pretty solid. We had a monk fish dish which was pretty good, it had a cilantro oil on it.

The bacon wrapped dates were very tasty. I have had bacon wrapped dates at many other restaurants, the difference here is that they were lightly breaded and deep fried. I though that was a nice touch. However, at other places bacon wrapped dates are stuffed with cheese (either a hard cheese like a Parmesan or sometimes a blue cheese). Here no cheese, and adding a nice Parmesan would kick it up a notch.

The veal cheeks were very good in my opinion.

We had a couple other salads including the lobster salad. Probably too much lettuce compared to the other goodies.

We also had the vegetable paella (which was the special) and it was pretty much vegetable paella. It was on the more expensive side (around $18) of the dishes and was not worth it. I would rather have had 2 more interesting dishes.

In the end, I would recommend this restaurant to others because the experience is worth it. The atmosphere and the unique dishes make for a fun time. Keep in mind, the dishes at this restaurant are not as ""wild"" as Bazaar where he uses several techniques some refer to as molecular gastronomy. But, the dishes are interesting and very palatable. Just don't go in expecting Michelin star quality food and you won't be disappointed.

Price is fairly reasonable for this type of setting. The dishes ranged from about $8 - $20 per dish. Typically looking at about 6 dishes for 2 people.

3076799,2012-08-29,1,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Oh, Jaleo... you are great for people watching...

At the table in front of us was what looked to be a call girl and her customer for the evening. We spent some time trying to decide if she was of the ""high end"" variety and decided that she was not. She definitely looked bored.  To our right was a man in his 40s and a guy in his 20s and a guy who looked to be in his teens.  We spent the majority of our evening trying to determine the relationship here - was it a love triangle? Was he their gigolo? Who knows.. but that's what makes Vegas fun.  Other than that you had the typical bachelor party, a table with 20 dudes, and a table of 4 women in their 40s clearly trying to relive their youth.  

We chose Jaleo because we were planning to go to Marquee after dinner and they are both located in the Cosmopolitan Hotel.  We called from the pool earlier in the afternoon and were told that a table for 4 wouldn't be available until 9:45 pm. It seemed late, but we decided to show up at 9 pm and have a drink at the bar and hope the table opened up sooner, which it did (small tip).

From what I can remember, this is what we ordered:

Croquetas de pollo - Traditional chicken fritters
Mejillones en escabeche - Mussels marinated in Sherry vinegar
Chorizo Palacios - A slightly spicy cured pork sausage seasoned with pimentón and garlic
Patatas bravas - A Jaleo favorite with spicy tomato sauce and alioli
Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel - Pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce
Mejillones al Vapor - Steamed mussels with bay leaf, lemon and olive oil
Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de oliva - Veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée
Carne asada con piquillos Julián - de Lodosa - Grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit

Everything was pretty good, but nothing stands out as outstanding enough that I would say that you must order it.  The Patatas Bravas were - to warn you - just seasoned potato chips.  I chose the Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel because of the ""foie gras"" component (you may or may not know that it is illegal in California and I needed my fix) but you couldn't even tell there was foie gras in there, which was disappointing for me.

We found a reasonable wine that was quite good and started with the bacon dates and chicken croquets. Both were good, but the waiter recommended the iberco (pork), which was melt in your mouth good. The 3 cheese selection was delish and paired well with the pork.

We also tried the potatoes, asparagus and lamb which were prepared well and had unique and bold flavors. We were hesitant to try the paella because we had such a poor experience at Julian Serrano's. ($60 baked rice). We gave it a try anyway and were not disappointed!

We picked Jaleo at the Cosmopolitan because it had vegan options for me. When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and given a vegan and regular menu. The vegan menu itself was pretty small and was more of a vegetarian/vegan menu. But it's nice to see vegan options outside of the Wynn and Encore. I had the tomato bread, gazpacho, and an eggplant-based dish. I was bummed because there was a vegetable paella listed on the vegan menu, but it is only made to feed a large group so I couldn't order it. However, everything was delicious and my 3 plates made a full meal for me. I would rate the food 5 stars. The only bad thing was that it took over an hour to get our meals and the food came out at random intervals (to be fair our server warned us about this), so there would be times that one of us was eating while the other was not. At least there was some great people watching to help make up for it.

Generally the ambience is good - festive, well-decorated, signature cocktails and wines with tapas. The menu was bright and cheery and drinks are ordered by iPad. We'd had a massive brunch earlier in the day and so weren't starving, but did split a variety of vegetarian dishes. I noticed the non-vegetarian dishes seemed to be plated quite creatively (one served in a shoe, another served as little cones).

- Pan de cristal con tomate fresco - This was probably our favorite dish. Crusty white bread with a smattering of tomato and olive oil. The tomato was more flavored into the bread, rather than a hunk of tomato sitting on top of it. Good flavor and definitely not too salted.

- Setas en escabeche - These mushrooms were fine. Nothing to write home about. A bit on the saltier end, without enough other flavor.

- Coliflor con olivas y frutos secos - A dish that is usually one of our favorites. Nothing special about it. It was on the more edible side, but again, had too much salt. The over-salting even offset the nice flavor of the fruit.

- Espinacas a la catalana - We have a favorite tapas restaurant in San Francisco that makes this beautifully (Alegrias). Whenever I see this on a menu I think it'll be served like theirs - sautéed to perfection with raisins and pine nuts. This felt like a spinach salad with salt poured on. The spinach was not well-sauteed at all.

- For our last dish, we thought we'd ordered a combo of sautéed eggplant and onion. We got served some mix of what I believe was eggplant and a lot of cheese. Again, not in love with it.

Jamon Iberico - cured ham from Spain was absolutely delicious that we ordered a second round.
Manchego Cheese - four tiny slices that were pretty good. The cheese was firm yet had a buttery taste.
Gambas Ajillo - tender shrimp cooked in spicy tomato and garlic sauce.  The sauce was delectable; the shrimp could have been bigger.
Patatas Bravas - fried potatoes that came on a plate layered with spicy tomato sauce and each piece topped with aioli.  This dish was hit as well and filling.
We also had the Red Wine Sangria which was both sweet and had a bit of a kick from the wine. It was perfect.  For a moment, we felt as if we were back in Barcelona.  
Our server was great.  She checked on us periodically without being intrusive.

Food was good.  One dish was served in a shoe (yes a shoe).  The item tasted great, but the shoe was not a great presentation. 

Table top presentation here seemed to lack overall.  In Vegas you would expect over the top in this arena.  Some more work to be done with this. 

Our table was right next to the dessert action station and they were selling a bunch!  The chocolate flan is to die for.  There was a hot food action station too.  The paella was great.  That evening was rabbit and duck if I recall.

Drinks:
*Margarita donostiarra: San Sebastian style margarita with arbol chile infused blanco tequila, mezcal, bay leaf syrup, lime ($16)
*Sangria de vino tinto: red wine sangria ($12 glass)

The margarita was really good. I liked the kick from the chili. The sangria was a little too light for me. I wanted it to be stronger. Tasted almost like juice.

Food:
*Chistorra envuelta en patata frita: slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato ($11)
*Ostras 'gin & tonic': five pacific oysters with lemon, gin and tonic ($18)
*Paella valenciana 'rafael vidal': a true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans ($25)
*Croquetas de pollo: traditional chicken fritters ($12)
*Carne asada con escabeche: grilled hanger steak with escabeche ($22)
*Gambas al ajillo: the very, very famous tapa of shrimp sauteed with garlic ($16)

I wasn't super impressed with Jaleo. The paellas available the day we went were the two we didn't really want to eat. Kind of disappointing. Plus the paella was super salty. The chicken fritters were good. Nice and creamy on the inside. But having it served in a shoe kind of grossed me out. I know they're new, but it felt dirty. The hanger steak was good. Nice and tender. But it wasn't really carne asada. And the shrimp was full of flavor. I loved the sauce! Nice and garlicky.

I wanted more from Jaleo. I'm not saying our dinner was bad, but I wanted something more satisfying. Plus, I was really looking forward to trying their paella. Being able to choose from only rabbit and chicken or vegetarian was very disappointing.

I did not know what to order. The whimsical descriptions were bothering me and made  none of the descriptions clear. Our new waiter gave us a few recommendations and we chose to start with toasted slices of uniquely crispy bread and sautéed spinach with pine nuts, raisins, and apples. What does uniquely crispy bread even mean? Anyways both dishes were overly salted. The bread was a rendition of bruschetta and tasted soggy. Spinach could have been good with the combination of ingredients but once again all I could taste was salt in my mouth. After these dishes, I decided to not order anything else off the menu.

Food - I really liked the tapas style and we ordered - bacalao, piquillo peppers, chicken and mushroom paella, a sharp smokey cheese plate, scallops, and the Iberica Bellota Jamon. The paella was the best I've had outside of Spain and my grandma's house. My buddy and I almost wanted more, addictive stuff. The Jamon was crazy good.

I must say the scallops were the most delicious. Loved how they perfectly pan fired it with butternut squash paste. The tuna wasn't horrible but i didnt like all the sesame on it. It was overpowering and added additional saltiness. The sausage paella was alright. The pork was good but sausage was too much for me. By the time the shrimp tapa came out, i was all salted out.

Food was so-so.  Chorizo came in little quarter slices...maybe 8 of them on a paper towel thing.  Cheese plate was good but ridiculously meager.  

On the plus side, sliders were great and suprisingly filling.  Shrimp with garlic was good.  Peppers stuffed with goat cheese was yummy.  Flank steak was also very good.  We particularly enjoyed the red peppers and eggplant dish.  

Main complaint was not having enough dishes to cut the heaviness, grease and salt of so many of the plates.  On the whole the meal was average at best.",YEwB55NVtFQzvNclk3pH0g,2,0,2,Vqps3QK_r4X_1ePrgAVeKw

Apparently every Sunday, they do suckling pig in order to boost restaurant volume.  The pig was INCREDIBLE.  Finished over a wood grill, served with aioli, garlic mayo, sea salt, and fire toasted bread, the pig was super tender and the skin crisp and flavorful.  Expensive at $25 / serving but worth every penny.  Apparently, they also roast a whole lamb Wednesday nights.

The quail was also very good.  Again, it was pretty expensive at $15 but delectable.  

Unfortunately, the dates with bacon were pretty mediocre.  The taste of caviar was also completely lost in huevo frito con caviar which cost a pretty penny at $16.

I attempted to order the boiled octopus, however, the server informed me that they were out of pulpo. So I settled for the tun con ajonjoli y piquillos confitados, which wasn't a delicious nor disgusting dish.

The restaurant seem like a hip place with modern décor and had a fun atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we opted for the beet salad, lamb chops, paella valencian (with beans, rabbit and chicken), salmon with cauliflower, jamon iberico, and pan con tomato (bread with tomato).

The beet salad was very unremarkable and the beets weren't very tasty.  The lamb chops were cooked perfectly, albeit overseasoned.  There was a mint sauce that looked nice but didn't add much in terms of flavor.  The paella was very uneven.  The chicken was well cooked and juicy, but everything else was disappointing. The beans were overcooked, the rice was undercooked, and the rabbit was overcooked.  The salmon with cauliflower was slightly undercooked (that didn't bother me) but the skin was just way too salty.  The jamon iberico was decent, but unmemorable.  The pan con tomato was probably the best because it was simple, yet elegant.

Service was unremarkable, and overall this place was a general disappointment, especially given the prices at this establishment.

The ambience is geared more for couples and small groups than a romantic date night setting. This is not a bad thing, especially in Vegas. 

Every thirty minutes or so they would rat-a-tat-tat the pans with wooden spoons, follow it with a tat-tat, and the whole restaraunt would chant something. The kitchen was located in plain view of the restaurant and was cool to watch the sizzle snap crackle pops and flames. 

Drinks:

They make specialty Gin cocktails. Ones that you would think go with vodka not gin. I'm not a big fan of Gin, but these unique drinks were a twist on some oldies. My drink tasted like a version of an old fashioned. 

The sangria is delicious, smooth, and sweet. The ladies love it!! 

Food:

The product is from Spain but the food is given the chefs rendition. I have had tapas in Spain and it was wonderful to have the same flavor profile but the food had a modern flair! It was perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and wonderfully delicious. 

Best prepared lamb I have ever had. Tender meat with chard edges. 

Service:

AUBREY was our server and I can't say enough about how impressed we with her service. Friendly, entertaining, and over the top service. The restaraunt as a while had a great system in place which made sure there was never a gap in service and food was be being ran on a timely basis. 

We ordered a dessert, which also is states on the menu, that it takes a little longer than usual.

3257076,2017-05-11,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Once upon a time, I ate my way through Barcelona. Even managed to see a thing or two, but mostly ate. Fast forward from then through every other meal I've had that claimed to be Catalan style tapas, and we can count on a few fingers how many got it right. After Jaleo, I can happily add one more to the count. 

Not so subtly tucked away on the third floor of the Cosmo in what I call restaurant row for the God, you'll find Jaleo. This place was mobbed and lively. Not an open seat anywhere in the house, but we did manage to get seated on time for our reservation. 

Service here was friendly and attentive, and our waitress made some suggestions of a few favorites to help the nearly impossible task of not over ordering. We had a few musts that had to be ordered as well. 

Pan con tomate - seriously, the world's most simple dish that proves that with high quality ingredients and the right execution, a few simple ingredients can make a surprisingly magical treat. The bread here is imported from Spain, and the best comparison I can make of the light, airy texture with crispy nooks and crannies, is an English muffin (I mean this in the best way possible). The tomato is grated over the toasted bread and drizzled with a healthy dose of high quality olive oil and flaky salt. This is one of the best renditions of the dish I've had. 

Jamon Iberico - not the super expensive guy, but the next one down. It's a full of flavor treat that any fan of salted, cured meats will appreciate. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cured meats here. 

Manchego - I like it when my cheese glistens, and this cheese was glistening. While there are probably more exotic bites on the menu, this is a classic that when sourced from the right place will always be good. Certainly don't mind the $6 price tag either. 

Bocadillo de Cachete de Ternera - this one was a little disappointing. What you have here sounds so sexy on paper (wagyu beef cheeks), but really comes out like a pulled short rib slider. It's good, but forgettable at the same time, and not worth the $10 a piece or the room in your stomach. 

Gambas al Ajillo - you'll both love this dish and hate this dish. What will you hate? The fact that the dish consists of 5 small shrimp for $18. First glance you wonder where the rest of the shrimp are hiding. What will you love? Eating it. It's absolutely fantastic. The depth of flavor they get from the super thin, flower petal thin slices of garlic and chili is phenomenal. You will be using the bread to get every last drop of oil. No judgement if you lick the bowl. 

Rossejat Negra - this is really the dish we came for. It's fideos negra in all its glory. This was my single favorite dish in Barcelona (and at Jaleo) and I've only found one other place stateside that did it justice. The slightly oceany taste of the noodles and the super tender octopus pair perfectly together. You'll not leave a single noodle in the pan here. Just be warned, if you're here on a date, this will turn your mouth black. 

Cod Bunuelos - not sure I can fairly judge these... we were more less stuffed by the time they came out. They were super light and crispy, with a very soft and creamy inside. I just don't think we could really enjoy deep fried creamy fish balls past the point of being overly full. 

Overall, extremely pleased with the meal here and the quality of nearly everything we ordered. Top 3 items for me were the gambas, the pan con tomate, and the rossejat. At $188 post tax / pre tip for all of the food above and 4 drinks, this actually feels like a pretty reasonable meal in Vegas. This is a must return spot for me next time I'm in Vegas.",o75ucTEDF_vsjEJoiIXIAA,2,1,5,aION6Cs_3y8LCJALbE41BA

It was a Friday night and we couldn't get seated until 10:30 (We checked at 8:00) We put our names on the waiting list and went to the chandelier bar for a few drinks. Can't say that waiting for our table was awful. When you have good company and a cool place like the chandelier bar, time seems to go by pretty fast. We headed upstairs just in time to be seated. The restaurant was jam packed. It's to be expected, the Cosmopolitan hasn't even been open a year and everyone wants to know what it's all about....the stores, the bars and most certainly the restaurants! 

We were seated ""outside"" the actual restaurant. We were seated at the very last table - which leads right to the elevators and hotel rooms. This ended up being the best table possible! Far enough away so the restaurant clatter wasn't muffling our conversation, but still close enough so the staff was attentive and thorough. This also allowed my favorite Las Vegas past time....PEOPLE WATCHING! The jaw-dropping, eye-opening, laugh out loud out-of-towners are most certainly a sight to see! Our server and food runners were very polite, friendly, comical and efficient! One of the food runners picked up an empty glass and ended up dropping it and thus shattering it into pieces. Instead of getting flustered, he made himself the butt of the joke by saying ""JOB OPENING!"" I thought that was a great display of his character. 

So far all seems well and you are probably wondering why I rated Jaleo only 3 stars?! First, let me be up front with you...Mama's on a budget!! So I knew going in that I didn't want to spend a lot of money and that I would be ordering my own tapas for self consumption as opposed to the family-style sharing. I told the table that I was doing my own thing and everyone was fine with that. I can't remember what everyone else ordered, but it was quite a bit! I ordered two items off the menu. I started with Manzana con hinojo y queso Manchego (Sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts and Sherry dressing) Only $9....budget friendly, gotta love it! The size was surprising - but then again, it was meant for sharing. It wasn't small and it wasn't even medium...but decently sized. As I waited for my second item, the rest of the table had dishes coming out. I wish I could recall what the heck they ordered that came in a sneaker. YES PEOPLE....A SNEAKER! What about a sneaker suggests a food item would be more appetizing while residing in an opening of foot apparel? Yes, it was clean. Yes, it was brand new (at least from the looks of it), but why, OH WHY, would you deliver a dish in a sneaker and then say ""I thought you'd enjoy it more in my gym shoe."" I get that it was meant to be comical, but I just didn't get why it would be served in a sneaker in the first place. I was eagerly anticipating my Carne asada con piquillos Julián de Lodosa (Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit). I though for $14, it would be a decent size...especially for family-style sharing. This is where my hugest disappointment resides. The dish was horribly undersized. It was one small piece of hanger steak that was cut into fourths. The pepper was a least two times the size of the steak....would you like some steak with that pepper? I understand that the portion sizes are meant to be more of a tasting menu, but you would think that they would give you a little more, especially with a family-style setting. It was quite delicious and it left me wanting more....oh the inner workings of the restaurant business to get you to spend more of your hard earned dough! 

Overall, it was a decent experience. I'd say have dinner somewhere else (more reasonably priced) and if you want to snack later, it would be suitable.",lQlxinXz7QpuoqfRWkO_MA,0,0,3,Y6r0YNOq_WIBxOskb4XaGQ

Service was pretty nice (when we got it), but somewhat spotty.  Our waitperson was nice and attentive most of the time.. but we had one long gap when we needed a lobster cracker.

Prices:  Friends treated us, which was so special, and we had a great time.  But had I been paying I would have been horrified at what I think are expensive prices for very small (but artfully done) portions.

Tapas:   Teeny, small and verrrry expensive.  But delicious. Had an egg with caviar, some excellent Gazpacho (I normally do not like gazpacho or cold soups, but this was soooooo good).  The presentation of the tapas is excellent, but I just find it silly that they are so tiny, especially for the price.

Paella of the night was Valencia.  Our friends who were treating opted instead to order a custom Paella (serves 6 and there were 5 of us) with lobster and calamari.  I think it cost $120.  It was outstanding.  Rice cooked just right, lobster fabulous.  It was also fun to stand near the Paella cooking station and watch them work their magic over open fires.  Paella took 30 minutes, but worth it.   

Drinks:   Did NOT like the red wine Sangria... too sweet and cloying.  Asked waitperson to recommend a Spanish red wine...  She brought me a glass of Vega Escal.  Excellent!  Smooth, full bodied, fruity, just right for the meal.  

Desserts wonderful too, but again small and very expsensive.  About the time we were chowing down on our chocolate flan, the place suddenly got jam crowded about 10:30pm.   It go soooo noisy, I was glad we were almost done.  (I guess us ""old fogies"" like to eat ""early"", like around 8:30pm)

This is a Jose Andres restaurant or at least influenced restaurant. Not a lot of gastronomy, but very courageous and creative dishes. With that said sometimes they work out better than others. 

The first time here, a local friend who eats here often did our ordering. We thought that he ordered simple dishes with a lot of veggies. It was all very tasty, but we wanted to try more.

This time my fiancé was more creative and ordered our dishes. We were torn between the tasting menu or trying to order ourselves.  I think we failed.. No fault of the restaurant, our dishes were cooked well and beautiful, just not our cup of tea.

I doubt I will go back soon, not because it was poor in anyways, but there is just so much good food in Vegas, and I would rather venture out and try something new.

We wanted more from this restaurant, seeing as it's a Jose Andres restaurant, and it's nicely decorated and had an interesting menu.

We made dinner reservations here on a busy Saturday night to celebrate our 30th birthday.  We arrived and were seated promptly.

It was easy to tell the place is loud -- it's open air on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan -- and our waiter was friendly enough.  But, really, the food was just MEH.  And, not even presented all that interestingly, either.  Although tapas-sized portions, they felt like just smaller versions of mediocre food, sadly enough.

What we had:

Short rib Paella - one of the best dishes of the night, but not nearly as good as other paella I've had in LA

Chicken fritters - OK.

Carne Asada - Great.  But, $22?????

Pollo a la parilla - OK.  Not mind blowing.

Tortilla de patatas - tasted better than it looked ... but how about a side of fresh tomato to counterpart how dry this dish is?

Pan De Cristal con Jamon Serrano - quite good to start off the night

Four people with some drinks came to about $200 before tip.  Not bad, but I wouldn't say the food was even worth half that.

We walked right next door to Secret Pizza and had our fill for under $20.  I do love and appreciate fine dining, but Jaleo would not be a choice ever again, sorry.",MZxpfo6fVI7bNG6q50XZKA,1,0,3,endKUu0vV0zLSXwK0BXowA
3332749,2016-06-15,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Considering the reviews of Jaleo, I wasn't expecting much of a dining experience.  The restaurant is located on the third floor of Cosmo in their restaurant district and when I went on a Wednesday at around noon, it was literally empty.  Granted they just opened, but by the time I left at 1pm, still no one had been seated.

I grabbed a seat at the bar and took part in restaurant week.  The meal provided was the exact same as their paella lunch menu, with gazpacho, salad, and paella of the day, except it was only $20 rather than $26, per usual.  From what I saw on Yelp, I was expecting to be left unfulfilled with portion sizes and taste, but I was rather pleased.  All 3 dishes had multiple flavors and 5-6 ingredients wrapped into the food to create unique tastes.  The gazpacho was refreshing, but probably too small at a cup size.  The salad was petite as well but the ingredients kept you excited with the saltiness of the fish and freshness of the greens.  The paella is the best in town from what I've tasted.  There's not many Spanish Tapas dishes available in Las Vegas, but this paella matches even what I've tasted abroad.  I would recommend trying it no doubt.

For $20, the meal was very reasonable and I would come again.  I do wish the paella would have been more seafood oriented rather than the chicken and mushroom provided, but it was still delicious.  The service was spot on and the atmosphere was nice, albeit a little lonely with no one in the restaurant.  I have been meaning to try one of Andres' restaurants and it didn't disappoint for lunch.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,7EhY-xcpHTZ8Abm-8Yckmw

I was expecting this place to be phenomenal since it is by Jose Andres. My party and I were very disappointed by this place. We came here for lunch and found out their menu is completely different from dinner. I saw all these appetizer and tapas photos from Yelp that I was looking forward to try.. None that were served here during lunch. No wonder this place was empty during lunch.

Next:The paellas that looked good on Yelp. Our waiter explained to us that there is only 1 paella flavor per day. We had mushroom on the day we went. Not good. I advise you call ahead to find out what the flavor of the day is. 

Meats: served all cold (cold slices). They say that is the way it's supposed to be served.

I ended up ordering a sandwich and chips as my main dish besides the cold tapas. Very sad for a restaurant by Andres. I wasn't even full after this meal and had to go eat elsewhere. Smh",635IZ9fLyetirOde-G8X-g,1,0,1,N4j1kvNLIjGXO4yqLgNpTw

I really was craving paella from the very impressive open fire stove, but with four of us there was a great opportunity to try many different tapas dishes.

Favorites included the octopus (some of the best to ever pass my lips), Apple & fennel salad, bacon wrapped dates, pat stars bravado, and the chicken. The sausage tapas are really good as were the ""shoes"". Take a look at other folks pictures to see what's in those shoes!  Only dish not enjoyed so much was the hanger steak. Perfectly cooked and beautifully presented but a bit on the tough side and tended to stick between the teeth. Good flavor though.

Excellent service was rendered by server Gary and the rest of the team.

first off...its expensive...TOO expensive if you ask me...

i understand that spanish tapas and ""tapas"" in general are small plates with smaller portions BUT cmon man...how are you going to charge what you charge for this food?  

so here is what i ordered...

mini burgers with peppers and alioli...these 3 sliders tasted like sliders. normal sliders...it supposed to be made from special spanish pigs, but they tasted like normal state side pigs to me.

pressed ham sando with manchego cheese and truffles...i really cant say anything negative about this sandwich...i loved it...like to the point where i could just order 3 or 4 orders and just eat them one by one...very truffley, very buttery, salty from the ham, and very cheesy...great sandwich indeed.

spanish omelet with potatoes and onions...i make this at home all the time. its just an omelet with runny egg and 5 slices of thin potato slices in there...wth?  so boring.

homemade pork sausage stew with pearl onions and mushrooms...i really wanted to like this dish, but for as much flavor that there was here...it was overpoweringly salty...like to the point where i wanted to gag salty...

seared scallops with romesco sauce...these scallops were cooked well...they give you 2 scallops for 15 bucks...at Yardhouse you order extra scallops with their tomato cream sauce and its 20 bucks for 8 scallops the same size and taste similar...

grilled skirt steak with pepper confit...overcooked. and chewy. not great in any way.

im reading that the service there is phenomenal...our servers werent. they werent bad in any way, but i mean cmon....thats your job...so just do it...

oh yeah...not only did i get a mean stomach ache and indigestion that kept me up all night...my g.f. ended up yacking from the food as well...i dunno what it was exactly, but something was not cooked right...i eat spanish tapas all over the place and im always fine to go the next day...not hunched over the porcelain bowl the next morning...

(why 2 stars? like i wrote earlier. that pressed ham sandwich with truffle and manchego is truly a delight.  take my advice and just order 4 of them and go about your trip)",Dn2gtoQnMgf261kIXpjLvA,0,0,2,UZBpxaVvf8st3a7GTqLJMA

As others have said, the ambiance is kind of lacking. Because of the location of this restaurant and particularly where we sat, a large group of us, right near the walkway, it almost gives the feel like you are in a food court. Not completely, but almost. I remember there being some awkward coat racks or something at our table that we asked them to move. I don't even know how to describe them, but they were more annoying than anything. As someone else pointed out, the chairs were not the most comfortable.

So this restaurant is best known for their tapas which means little plates shared. If you're looking at the paella section, ask the waiter/waitress which are available today. We order the chicken and rabbit one, which to be honest made me hesitate because I've never had rabbit before but the waiter assured me that it tastes just like chicken. LOL doesn't everything nowadays taste like chicken. We also ordered the Grilled Merino Lamb with rosemary sauce, and 2 of the Wagyu Cheek Sliders. When you order the sliders, just be mindful that one order is one slider and it is mini, just a little smaller than a White Castle slider. 

We didn't have to wait long for the food to come. The Lamb was delicious, cooked to a perfect medium rare and just melt in your mouth goodness. The paella was great, and good enough for 2. The Sliders although it is super tiny, the flavor is amazing; soft bun with such crispy meat.

1. We arrived on time for our reservation.  It took them half an hour to seat us.  AND they did not mark us as arrived for our opentable reservation.

2. The staff - I understand that the Cosmopolitan focuses on young and beautiful.  I like that vibe.  But, when it comes to food, I want people who know food and love it.  The runner brought us a dish and said ""here are your meatballs.""  We didn't order meatballs, so we sent it away.  Our waiter brought it back to us and said ""sorry, he doesn't know what the dish is called.""  Seriously?  FIne dining staff should know!

3. There was a hair in my tortilla.  The manager (who was also a little on the young side) offered us a new one.  We declined, as we had so much more food coming and we found the hair towards the end.  She said ""okay we'll take it off the bill.""  That should go without saying.  If it was me, I'd give the table a free dessert or sangria, but that's fine.

4. Food was fired at a strange pace.

Okay, now the good - the food was mostly delicious.  The Ferran Adria olives are always amazing, the patatas bravas were unique and fun and I enjoyed the food overall.   The cocktails were amazing... 

All this to say - grab a cocktail and a small plate or two at the bar.  The overall experience should have been far more elevated.",ZXJ80SFdNBIIoKyTYHZ-Xg,0,1,3,9s3E7AZwYh6gLe9KgAUn-w

They are also located towards the back of the Cosmopolitan (on the third floor I believe), so expect a LOT of walking to get there. My friends love tapas and wanted to try Jose Andres' Jaleo for our fancy dinner while in Las Vegas. We made reservations for a party of 4, but ran about 15-20 minutes late. Although we called ahead to let them know, they gave away our table, which I could understand. However, once we arrived, they told us we were next on the list, but it took at least 30 minutes before we were seated. Luckily, we were able to tell our server that we needed to get out of there by a certain time, so she was able to rush our dishes. We ordered:

-Pan De Cristal Con Tomate Fresco (Half Loaf of Toasted Bread Brushed w/Fresh Tomato, $12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA): Just ok. After reading the description of this dish, which claims that it is ""
uniquely crispy and ethereal bread"", I had high expectations. However, this dish was really disappointing. The bread was ok, but too crunchy for my liking, and I didn't think there was anything special about the tomato on it. Skip! 
-Jamón Ibérico De Bellota Fermín (Hand-Carved, Cured Ham From the Legendary Acorn-Fed, Black-Footed Ibérico Pigs of Spain, $35/oz, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#IrrNUw_TOBiFdiZW3HK5lQ): Just ok. Although this jamón is supposed to be from the famed Ibérico pigs, I didn't think it was as good as some of the jamón I had in Spain. I wouldn't get this again.
-Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco (Seared Scallops w/Romesco Sauce, $18, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#IyEZzs57dp9C0AVLVY8IcQ): Pretty good. The scallops were cooked well, and I liked the romesco sauce. 
-Ensalada De Bogavante Con Cítricos Y Escarola (Maine Lobster Salad w/Citrus, Frisée, $18, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#lT7OTErDIrISaHyyi6m31g): Good, but nothing special. The lobster was cooked very well, but I wouldn't get this again.
-Arroz de pato 'Jean Luis Palladin' (Rice w/Duck Confit, Duck Breast, Foie Gras Cream, PX Reduction, $25, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#zRC4UuIfh8yaAHmdFiFoBg): Super salty. The duck breast was seared perfectly, but this dish was difficult to eat with the salt level. I think I would've really enjoyed it if it hadn't been oversalted.
-Gambas Al Ajillo (The Very, Very Famous Tapa of Shrimp Sautéed w/Garlic, $16, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jaleo-las-vegas-3?select=xRBBLam0AYhfMFYtZlFMmA#BmzG-8nYewNsvHMUqHmvBg): The shrimp were just ok, but I liked the sauce, and dipping the bread in the sauce. However, I don't think I would order this dish again.
-Rossejat Negra con Cigala (Fried Pasta, Squid Ink, Freshwater Prawns, $27): The flavors of this dish were really good, and unique, but again, overly salty. I liked the sweetness the squid ink lent to the fried pasta. I would recommend ordering this dish, but asking them to go lightly on the salt.

Overall, the dishes I had here weren't so great that I would choose to come back over dining at another nice restaurant in Las Vegas since there are so many choices. Also, the chefs here need to go easy on the salt. If you must check out Jaleo for yourself, make reservations ahead of time.",76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg,0,0,2,HgZe9OEbzx1jUdWtfdHr2w

Great service & lively, modern & vibrant setting. Everything is red and black. The menu is pretty overwhelming as with most tapas (and esp. Andres') restaurants. We were advised to order 3 dishes per person, but I'm glad I took out a few. We were so full by the end of it all. This is NOT because of portion sizes - those are quite small and quite expensive. It was because of the heaviness & richness of everything. All of the dishes had beautiful & quirky presentations, so I'm sure that added to the price tag.  

First - I ordered the cocktail that was made with cucumber water, berry purée, vodka, & wine, and it was so refreshing and delicious. Didn't taste like there was alcohol in it, though it did taste like the best spa water I've ever had.

All of the dishes that we ordered were great except the patatas bravas. 

Chicken croquettes - 5 stars. They were served in a Camper brand shoe (my favorite shoe brand - have you tried them? Their leather is so amazingly soft and their designs are out there). The presentation was odd, and I'm not sure about the relevance, but I was happy to see Campers. The clean freak in me was hoping the shoes were clean. lol. The croquettes were so creamy, rich, crispy but not greasy, and had nice chunks of chicken inside. I would have eaten all of them if I didn't feel guilty about the fried aspect.

Vegetable paella - 5 stars. I can't believe I'm giving a vegetable dish 5 stars. I was initially disappointed that the only paella they had during our time there was a vegetable one. However, it was a damn fine vegetable paella. The flavor was strong and vibrant. The risotto was cooked perfectly! There were tons of vegetables in there (and not the cheap nasty kinds) - asparagus, baby radishes, cauliflower... There was a bit too much of a veg to rice ratio though, but it all tasted great.

Bacon-wrapped dates - 3.5 stars. Good but greasy. They were breaded which was unusual, but I liked that about them. I'm just not normally a fan of bacon-wrapped dates in general.

Endive with goat cheese, oranges, & almonds - 5 stars. I can't believe this. 2 5-star ratings for 2 vegetarian dishes. There's something wrong with me. This may have been my favorite dish of the night. It was so bright and sooooo flavorful and refreshing. The creaminess of the whipped goat cheese, the sweet citrus from the orange slices and the crunch and slight bitterness from the endive - wow what simplicity and what a marriage of flavors. It was also a gorgeous dish.

Mini fried shrimp skewers 3.5 to 4 stars - these were some baaaaby shrimp. Loved the taste and the simplicity. They were so skinny and shrimpy shrimp though. Good thing they had almost 10 pieces in the basket.

Garlic Shrimp - 3 stars - this was more tomatoey than I'm used to seeing with this dish. The shrimp weren't impressive and the dish was meh overall.

Patatas Bravas - 1 star. Oh what a disappointing dish. Don't expect your usual fried potato cubes with aioli and chili sauce. These were a mess of super thin fried potato chips dusted with so much smoked paprika that you'd better not inhale too strongly. You'd surely start choking. There was some light aioli on top. All of the toppings blanketed the top layer of crisps, so you could barely eat the top ones and then the bottom ones didn't have anything. Not even salt. We left most of that bowl untouched.

Skirt steak - 4 stars - perfectly cooked. Juicy. Seasoned well. Smoky. Simple and good.

Flan - 2.5 stars. It had a nice citrus taste, but the texture was soft like panna cotta. I'm not a fan of panna cotta. 

Apple Charlotte dessert 4.5 stars - warm, crispy bread exterior. Sweet & cinnamony apple interior. Nice ice cream on the side. So good.

Overall, the portions are small, the prices are high, the food is mostly darn good. It was by far the busiest restaurant in that corridor at the Cosmopolitan. I can see why. Would return.",NEIYKki2XKFjLan4ba77rw,0,0,4,YEBE4_Xx0NUqF-kcfuBMjg

We arrived to our table, we sat for about ten to fifteen minutes waiting for someone to say hello.  After being greeted and poured room temperature water we ordered our drinks.  After about twenty five minutes our server took our order.  The menu is a bit different and thought the server should have taken some time to explain the menu and or any specials.  This did not happen.  The server looked and acted like she could care less about us being there.  One person in our party ordered Jose's Patatas Bravas for six dollars.  This was a bag of what appeared to be lay's chips topped with spicy tomato sauce.  What a joke, a bag of plain chips with the empty bag on the side.  My wife ordered the Manza salad which she did not like at all.  She found it to be bland.  The salad was also small but made no difference since she could not finish it because she could not stand the taste.  I had the spinach salad which actually tasted good but for eleven dollars found it to be very small.

We were seated rather quickly and ordered some wine to go with our tapas.  We all shared them family style. Between 8 girls, we had more than enough food. Here's some of what we ordered:

Pan de cristal con tomate fresco- turned out a little soggier than I hoped
Piquillos Julian de Tolosa
Jamón ibérico Fermín- this was one of the tastiest!
Pulpo asada con crema cebolla- absolutely heaven
Puntillitas de Cádiz salteadas con pochas- even the white beans were good
Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva- the oil was a bit much on this, but tasty
Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo'- seriously yummy

And those are just the ones I remember off the top of my head. I'm pretty sure we went through so many dishes they all became a blur of ham and octopus (I really like it) and cheese. But I do believe we had a salad in there too. I just can't recall which one. 

Overall, I was impressed that service handled a busy Friday night with ease. The food came out quickly, it was tasty, and we didn't have to wait to get in. All in all, I'd go again.",pQIADDOm1H1Yd04VDQfUbA,1,1,4,BHq1ecKSfXOuxSil_x9p3w

We got the chicken croquette- which was a little mushy for me but the flavor was amazing, the bread with tomatoes- reminds me of a mellow bruschetta but the tomatoes were crushed, the Brussels sprouts- good but I wouldn't order it again, sausage paella- I could of gone without the sausage but the paella was AMAZING, scallops with butternut squash- freaking amazing GET IT, stuffed squid-meh I didn't care for it, and I can't remember the other items.

He said its like Foodgasm/Foodporn mindblowing moment. Yes, 16 days and he still say how awesome it was.

3462233,2012-08-09,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Upon arriving at Jaleo, I was sure we were in for a HUGE treat. The place was jam-packed, I LOVE Tapas (having lived in Spain for a short time) and the hostess was absolutely AWESOME and managed to get us a private room for my sister's 21st birthday. I have to be honest: the meal turned out to be a pretty big disappointment. I probably wouldn't recommend this to anyone with limited time in Vegas, although I have to say, I'd probably go back and try different menu items. Most restaurants deserve a second chance.

SERVICE: This was one of the main reasons I didn't end up loving Jaleo. The hostess was GREAT - she worked some magic and got us a private room (that doesn't take reservations) and she checked in while we were waiting to provide us updates on timing. When we sat down, we had two servers assigned to our room. The main waitress was nice, but steamrolled our decision-making process. Having lived in Spain, I had some definite opinions on what we should order and I could hardly get a word in edgewise. She also failed to get drink orders from everyone and when I tried to speak up to order, she talked right over me. Finally, another member of my group tapped her on the arm to let her know she hadn't gotten a drink order from me. While I knew what the dishes were like, the rest of my group wasn't acquainted with many of the menu items. When asked for what she'd recommend, the waitress blew through several items so quickly that my friends couldn't even keep up to locate them on the menu. It didn't help that she used the Spanish names instead of describing what they were in English. Her initial service left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the meal.

FOOD: One thing about Jaleo - this is one authentic tapas menu. I was REALLY impressed. It's a huge menu and there are so many things on it that most Americanized tapas joints wouldn't include. The gazpacho was a HUGE hit at our table, although difficult to share because it was served in one dish. The garlic shrimp was pretty good, although a member of our table got one of those awkward bad shrimp - something I don't think can be avoided. The peppers stuffed with goat cheese (my selection) turned out to be a hit despite no one else seeming interested in it from the beginning. Definitely order that if you go. I'd pass on either of the croquettes (but I never liked them in Spain either, so that may just be a ""me"" thing). They were served in a Camper tennis shoe, which was SUPER cute. We loved that - although the waitress had zero explanation for it. Lame. One thing I would definitely NOT order again was the beef paella. It was some of the worst meat in the paella that I've ever had - another member of our group couldn't eat meat for the next two days because she was so grossed out. Plus, it was SO expensive! Be sure to check the price on paella before you order...and I'd go with more tapas instead. Or, maybe try the seafood paella.

DRINKS: One regret from our group - we wish we had ordered a carafe of sangria. Instead, some of us had wine and some had cocktails. My Whiskey de Verano was AWESOME and I'd recommend it to others. Good drink options. No problems here.

ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant, which is totally open on one side is pretty upbeat and busy. It was PACKED on a Thursday at 9:30. But, like I said - we had the  private room. It was AWESOME. It had glass doors, so the noise was kept out (and ours was kept in). My friends who were facing the doors, though, said waiters and waitresses kept staring at us through the doors, which was a little awkward. Oh well. Deal with it - the room was great. It even had a lazy susan on the table to help share tapas.

OVERALL: Like I said, I'd go back here again to give the authentic Spanish menu another try. But, I wouldn't go for a special occasion or with a HUGE group. I'd order the sangria and I'd go with lower expectations. This was just an okay meal for me in Vegas - I've had better meals.",lCCE9bD5Z833Wm0q-TEMHw,0,0,3,3FfdBw-pHzmd4-gBvLqIqA

This tapas place has an open fire pit area where they cook the meats and paella which is amazing to see. We were a group of four and seated at a high top close the the fire pit and near the bar. The service is unbeatable as they bring items quickly and are attentive. As it is a tapas place, the items come as they are ready. We ordered a variety of items which resulted in my three star rating. 

There was a tuna salad dish that was a giant bowl of way too much mayo and too little of the other ingredients. There was an asparagus dish with yet again too much mayo. 

There were sliders at $9/each that sound amazing on the menu but come with items on it not listed in the menu that impact/overwhelm the flavor: caramelized onions and two different peppers. Those additions could be great if you are expecting them when you order them. The cured meats are delicious and the steak was perfect. 

The croquettas con pollo are served in an interesting way in a shoe, yep an actual shoe, but the flavor was not on par with expectations.

We had a group of five and ordered 3 plates each to share.  These were by far the smallest plates of tapas I've ever seen.  Some barely had enough to pass around once.  Plus, the tiny plates were way over-priced.  Some dishes were better than others, but really nothing was great.  We liked the ponche de cava, the croquetas, and the apple salad, but none of the entrees were good.  

The restaurant was loud and crowded and we kind of got lost in the shuffle a few times.  The service was very spotty - sometimes they took away our plates before we had finished, and sometimes they left us sitting for way too long before checking on us. The server said she would put all our tapas in an order that made courses, but that made it so some people didn't have anything they wanted to eat for a course or two.  Also, our check did not come until we asked the manager to track it down for us.   

In all, I would probably not return to Jaleo.  Part of the fun of tapas is enjoying the people you are with.  This restaurant makes it hard to enjoy the company of your dinner companions due to the crowded and loud environment.",bhKR-RcsqZgbABImMy2IBg,1,1,2,iqg9i2nUHbiYtzI8oU8IgQ

We love Barcelona, especially their tapas, and Jaleo nailed each dish and flavor profile. We've had papas bravas all over Spain and the USA and the bravas here were THE BEST EVER!!!

The chicken croquetas were creamy in the middle and crunchy on the outside and the inside mixture mirrored the usual tuna croquetas found in Barca.

The endive and goat cheese ""salad"" was so good and simple! The sliced marcona almonds on top made the dish.

3559976,2014-04-06,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I love this place. I usually show up here alone when I'm in town on business, so I end up at either the tapas bar or the sangria bar. Some people have complained about the service here but I have found them unfailingly energetic and helpful, eager to guide newcomers through the menu. They're often crowded, so yes, servers do not always have a lot of time to hover, but I've never had anyone brush me off. And I always get the feeling they really enjoy the food they're selling and want you to enjoy it, too.

I have some special dietary needs, so I prefer small plates to the ginormous portions that a lot of people like and expect. And as a corollary, I don't have much use for hotel buffets. If you love the value and large portions of a buffet, Jaleo is probably not for you. But if you like smaller portions, you can get very happy at Jaleo. 

Every dish I've had here has been good, and some are dizzyingly delicious, though some are unmemorable. The chicken croquettes -- served in paper tucked into a sneaker -- are comfort food elevated to Olympian heights. The combination of crunchy, creamy and salty will take you back to childhood, if your mother was a gourmet tapas chef. There's a bacalao dish that is similar. Their fennel and apple salad with mancheco is a healthy option that is way too tasty for being so good for you, rich with toasted nuts. On the other hand, the house smoked cheese with nut brittle would be a good pairing with a drink but is only okay as part of a meal. 

I had one dessert that isn't on the online menu: torrijas, I think it's called. They describe it as a Spanish style French Toast, which doesn't quite convey what it is. It's like a creamy bread pudding with top note of citrus, maybe from a liqueur, served with brioche ice cream. It's not the best dessert I've ever had but right now I'm having trouble thinking of 10 better ones. 

The atmosphere is loud and a little raucous. As befits its location in the hip, upscale Cosmopolitan, the vibe is, well, upscale and hip, energized, welcoming and bright. This is not a place for a quiet, sedate experience. It's very different from the darker, more romantic La Cave at the Wynn, which also serves small plates. 

But here's the catch with Jaleo: Those small plates aren't cheap. They add up. And tapas, as everybody knows from watching Anthony Bourdain, are meant to accompany wine or beer. So if you show up very hungry and order 4-5 tapas/person plus drinks, dessert and coffee, I'd estimate you could be looking at $150-$200/person. I usually order 2-3 tapas and maybe dessert for around $50 before tip -- if I'm not drinking. I am generally satisfied with that, but as I said, I usually show up alone and I like to eat lightly. 

Bottom line: A fun menu to explore, lots of soul-satisfying treats, but the price can sneak up on you. I can't honestly call the food a great value for the money, but I love the whole Jaleo experience: the energy, the young eager staff, the feeling of fun, even the bustle and noise. No, it's not a hotel buffet. But that's a good thing.",3LtBhKZWtduNuXsFnm32yA,1,0,4,WYGYwrL6qnlHvzCrLw_SvQ

My favorite part were the small portions, that way I got to sample alot of items which is one of my favorite ways to dine!  Also, because the portions were small,  each of us could pick something that wasn't necessarily a favorite of the other.

My favorite items of the night, the brussels sprouts salad which had serrano ham, apricots, apples and a sherry dressing.  Second favorite - Deep fried, bacon wrapped dates!   So decadent and so tasty.  Luckily, the recipe for that salad, and the small wrinkled potatoes dish we got, I found online, because I was seriously sad when both bowls were gone, and Vegas isn't exactly close enough to run over for dinner..",yLZOrUg5UJhQlffSoL-j0Q,0,0,4,XFS7HyXo9C--DwyWrF7DrQ

But I have never seen a management team respond so enthusiastically to make things right.

They have earned my loyalty because they not only say they care about service, they really mean it. If you think a good restaurant or hotel never has any problems, you need to get out more. The true mark of a quality restaurant is how they deal with problems when they happen (because they always do).

Regarding the food, you'll be able to enjoy some traditional Spanish tapas, but there's always a creative twist that doesn't disappoint. Even something as straightforward as sliced ham is special when prepared properly. Bread with tomatoes - boring? Not at Jaleo! I recommend ordering the anchovies and eating those with the bread.

But by far, the tapa that gets the biggest reaction are the Croquetas De Pollo, which are served in a shoe. Look funny, but taste amazing.

PROS
- The gin and tonics really were the ""best I've ever had."" They were perfectly balanced cocktails - most people would have a hard time even tasting the gin.
- Virtually every dish on the menu is amazing - the patatas bravas, the gambas (shrimp), the jamon, the Croquetas De Pollo.

CONS
- Hard to get a reservation on most nights
- The menu can be intimidating - ask questions or get a tasting menu (see below)

TIPS
- Order the tasting menu. Don't worry about specific dishes - they'll bring out course after course of amazing food.
- If you drink beer, try the Estrella Damm - it's clean and crisp, like a Japanese beer but with more flavor.
- The location in the Cosmopolitan is perfect if you are going to have drinks in one of the hotel bars or go out for an evening at Marquee Nightclub.
- Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays are the busiest nights (aside from special events or conferences).",tvjL4BErlkBNsSyLjkEzFg,0,0,5,aV6iIVqcDZQ6fN96FQq57A

Gambas al ajillo
Croquetas de pollo - served in a shoe!
Berenjenas con miel

The Berenjenas con miel(fried eggplant) was another dish my taste buds enjoyed.  It was crispy on the outside with the nice and soft eggplant-y texture on the inside.  The cheese fritters were yum!  It kind of reminded me of the cream cheese won tons, but better!  The lobster paella had a very good presentation, but it was a little difficult to eat.  I wish they had pulled the meat out of the shell for us.  We were all dressed up to go out, so we didn't want to get down and dirty to eat that lobster.

As for the food, the tapas we ordered were all good. Chorizo and manchego cheese cut perfectly and flavorful. So too was the tomato bread.  The croquettes were as described ('a chicken pot pie in every bite"") but I do wonder why it came served in a sneaker. No need for gimmick when you have food this good.

We started with the pan con tomate, which was very good.  The bread was very tasty, as was the fresh tomato grated on top, then finished with a delicious olive oil.  

Next, we ordered the potatas bravas.  This dish was a complete fail.  Instead of the classic fried or boiled potatoes covered in a spicy pimenton sauce, this dish is a a bowl of potato chips that was emptied into a bowl and then two cold sauces squirted over the top.  The first sauce was a tomato based sauce with some paprika flavor, but seemed a little off.  The second sauce was a mayo/garlic aioli.  This dish was terrible.

Next, came the chicken croquetas.  These were pretty tasty, they had a nice creamy texture and good flavor.  They oddly came served in a shoe.

Then we ordered the Chistorra envuelta en patata frita.  This dish was little pieces of mildly spicy chorizo that was wrapped in a potato chip.  The chorizo was tasty, but being wrapped in the potato chip fell flat for me and I wasnt really impressed, not a bad dish though.

Next was the Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva.  This dish was another that was pretty tasty and largely because of the chorizo.  The potato puree that it was served on was also tasty and had a nice creamy texture.  Where this dish turned a little south was in the cidre sauce, which did not taste much like cidre and instead more like Worcestershire.  The other element that was a little too much was the amount of large pieces of sea salt sprinkled on the dish.  This dish has promise, I just thought the execution was off.

Finally, we ordered the Mini pepito de ibérico and this was the highlight of the meal.  This is a burger slider made with iberico pork, topped with iberico bacon, a roasted pepper and a delicious aioli type sauce.  This little two bite slider was great and I should have made a meal out of just these.  However, at eight dollar a piece, that is an expensive two bites.  I am glad we ordered these last because they were the best item we had.

Overall, I think this place is using very good ingredients and doing some cool things with the traditional tapas, I just was not a fan of their interpretation of the things that I tried.  Also, this place is very expensive.  For the above mentioned tapas and one glass of sangria (which was very tasty), the bill was just over $100.  The ingredients are quality, but this cost for tapas is just crazy, no doubt because of being located on the strip and carrying a famous chef's name.  We will not be going back sans some special occasion prompted by someone else.",qJXoA6sxmiJ357nLeAIlGQ,0,0,3,p7j5za0xMUMsqzacqwe1zg

With so many wonderful internationally recognized chef owned restaurants located on the Strip, we returned to Jose Andrés' Jaleo for a Spanish lunch. We had just arrived into Las Vegas only a few hours prior to our noontime reservation and we were excited for a taste of paella and other tapas.  

Our server, Jason, greeted us with friendly familiarity and described the lunch menu as an abbreviated or highlighted dinner menu that we were familiar with from previous dines. We started with cocktails and ordered their 3-course lunch special. Jason piqued my interest with a cocktail called ""Con Membrillo"" that was a Seasonal concoction of quince paste, rum, egg white and nutmeg. There were probably more ingredients in that cocktail that I don't just remember listing.  But, after a couple of smooth sips, I was transported to Madrid's Plaza Mayor in Fall. My husband ordered a Spanish beer, Estrella Damm Inedit Witbier to begin his ""journey"".  Meanwhile, our order of Jamón Ibérico Fermín with picos arrived.  It was a small plate of porky deliciousness that melted like butter as soon as it hit your tongue. The paper-thin slices were paired with crisp ""picos"" or mini breadsticks.  We both ordered the Complete Spanish Lunch that was a 3-course meal. It started with Ensalada Verde (Bibb lettuce, red onions and sherry dressing), Gazpacho estilo Algeciras (classic chilled Spanish soup made with tomato, cucumber, peppers and bread) and Paella del Dia (today's special featured chicken and mushrooms). It was a value for its price at $26 per person. Jason brought out each course in a timely succession...we weren't in a rush and had the time to savor the flavors. The food was well-seasoned and we were seated to watch the chef prepare the paella over the open-fire wood burning grill. We liked Jason's attentiveness, efficiency and positive attitude.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,8,9,5,W2U7VliVSwMIx6hZyyXYIQ

I really liked the selection of tapas here.  They had a great little shrimp tapas that was simply delicious (sorry name eludes me). 

Their wine selection was very good; lot's of light to medium bodied reds and refreshing whites to compliment most of all the plates.

The place was very, very crowded and unfortunately the service lacked a bit which is why the 3 star.  Could have been an off night for the service team or perhaps they werer simply overwhelmed by the number of people.

After two evenings of fine dining on the strip, my BF told me he's had enough of it, and he wanted something more relaxing. After I was forcibly concurred with his opinion, I immediately cancelled our reservations with Joël Robuchon and suggested tapas for dinner. Luckily, his highness granted my suggestion and told me to pick one that's good enough so I'll be able to keep my head. Of course, at first I was a bit dubious since I read tons of not-so-good reviews about Jaleo, and had Julian Serrano in mind. But then I thought to myself: I enjoyed China Poblano and SAAM (back in Los Angeles,) how bad can José Andrés' Jaleo be? As it turned out, I've made the right decision!!

The restaurant itself is conveniently located on the third floor of Cosmopolitan, which is where we were already staying at... We were seated promptly upon arrival (unlike Le Cirque...,) and our wonderful server Paul M. couldn't had been nicer. He's attentive, and made lots of knowledgeable suggestions throughout the entire meal. 

Since Jaleo is famous for its Gin and Tonics, Paul M. suggested ""Cítrico"" to me, which was light and refreshing as he described. My BF opted for a carafe of red sangria, and every sip was heavenly accompanied with the citric taste. And if none of these drinks interest you, don't panic, they have their drink menu well organized on an iPad for you to pick.

As a given, neither me nor my BF understand Jaleo's extensive tapas menu, luckily Paul M. was there to save the day. Based on our palates, Paul M. made the following suggestions: ""Vieiras con mojo rojo y polvo de almendras"" (two large scallops served with mojo rojo sauce, seared to just the right point, very juicy and tender,) ""Gambas al ajillo"" (Garlic Shrimp, at first I thought it was going to be similar to China Poblano's ""shrimp mojo,"" Paul ensured me they're total different dishes. He was right, very garlicky just the way I like it, ) ""Croquetas de pollo"" (chicken fritters, served in a shoe, I think everyone is talking about this dish here, need I say more?) Costillas de cordero Moruno (rack of lamb, we ordered it medium rare, though it came out pinker than we expected, it didn't stop me from picking up the bones and chewing the meat off. Yes, I did that at Jaleo inside of Cosmopolitan!! ) Mini pepito de ibérico (Spanish mini Bugrer, a personal favorite of mine. My first time tasting Spanish ibérico pig. Fattening, yes, but trust me, it's worth the risk of getting your arteries clogged up. ) Paella Valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' (Chicken and rabbit paella, personally I couldn't differentiate the rabbit from chicken, but the paella itself was amazing, crispy and brunt.) Bacon wrapped dates (this dish was actually deep fried and served on an alioli-like sauce, tangy and sweet,) flan (Paul highly recommended this creamy flan, and it's beyond any flans we've ever tasted before. I especially love how it's served with mango sorbet, wiped cream and tangerines. Believe me, it works! ) and lastly, the olive oil ice cream (the rich olive oil with grapefruit sorbet plus chunks of grapefruit, citrusy and creamy at the same time.)

The ambiance in the restaurant was just simply romantic yet trendy, not to mention ""é"" the tasting kitchen is also located inside of Jaleo. I cannot wait until the next time when I visit Jaleo/Cosmopolitan again and try the famous é!!",8p9OUrGi0Jf_DNdA1GKxPA,3,2,5,YgIpfZ16z1MnU8c6xOTxZA

On the bright side, Portions were very generous. The menu (Not in any specific order): 
- Gaspacho: not good, tasted too much like cucumber and not tomato
- Bread with tomato: amazing
- Manchego cones: very good
- Prosciutto grilled sandwich with Manchego and truffle oil - we did not enjoyed warm prosciutto and it mainly tasted like truffle oil only. 
- Spinach: simple but good
- Lomo: great
- Mussels: very good
- Blue cheese: french cheese, not Spanish

- Carne asada: good

My husband and I were looking for a bite to eat but nothing too heavy. We scoped out the menu and decided to try it and I'm so glad we did. 

We were seated immediately and given some menus. We were only ordering a few things and a couple drinks. Our waitress was helpful in making suggestions and commended us with what we ordered which was quite nice. 

The drink menu is on an iPad which I found amusing. I had a glass of white sangria while my husband had the Clara which is beer and lemonade. He loved his drink. I wasn't as into it but it wasn't bad. I loved my sangria. A fresh new take with the cinnamon stick, dried apricot, and basil. 

Now onto the food:
Chicken croquettes - like a fried chicken pot pie. They were amazing. I just wasn't crazy about the presentation to be honest. Food in a shoe is just not appealing. 

Bacon wrapped dates - deep fried dates with this delicious apple onion mustard sauce, what could be bad about that?! It was excellent. 

Warm brussels sprout salad with grapes and Serrano ham - I loved the tang from the vinegar with the sweetness of the fruit and the salty bite of the ham. It was perfect. 

Slider-perfectly cooked meat, charred bread, caramelized onions, and bacon?! Best ever. 

Salmon tartare cone-my husband loved this bite. Especially the dill. 

Patatas bravas- the aioli and spicy tomato sauce worked well together and the potato still had excellent texture. 

Everything was delicious and paced well and all the staff worked together and we were never without food on our plates or water in our glasses. It was an excellent meal and the price was quite reasonable for the quality. I was very impressed!",s2jkj3jh7GM4CkSCsslJ6w,6,4,5,d2nhfMmB_3t48tOd7waz5g

""Jaleo: a lively dance of Andalusian origin, or the music or handclapping that accompanies it."" - Google

For anyone who has watched Chef José Andrés on TV or met him in person, u can understand why he would call this restaurant Jaleo.

Chef Andrés is known the world over for his Spanish tapas & his jovial take on cuisines from around the world. Chef Andrés is also known as one of the first chefs (if not the first) to bring the tapas dining concept to America.

""Tapas: small Spanish savory dishes, typically served with drinks at a bar."" - Google

¡Salud! = Cheers!!

I love watching Chef Andrés on TV as he has such a passion & a desire to share his food with the world as well as learn the history & cultures of other countries so he can create fusion dishes.

Disclaimer: I have never been to Spain so I'm not an expert when it comes to Spanish food or tapas.

Luckily for us, our friend, once again came to the rescue & made reservations for lunch.

We had a hard time finding Jaleo, which is located in the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor because there weren't any signs on the casino floor. Well at least none that we could see??

After waiting in anticipation to try Chef Andrés' Jaleo... we did what any other visitor would do!!

We ordered the following:

Lunch like a Spaniard. (4 stars).

A great way to try more plates!!

For $25 per person (+$7 for paella of the day if desired), u can choose 1 item from 3 courses. This meal was a fantastic experience.

---

Ensalada verde con anchoas (Anchovy Salad). Whoa mama!! I loved this salad but it was verging on salt overload even for me.

I heart fresh anchovies & the dressing was bursting with flavor from the fried capers to the romesco garlic dressing & the Idiazábal cheese, but the mixture was potent. Good.

I had to have a beer just to combat the salt intake... Wait, do I really need a reason to have a beer??

---

Tichi's Gazpacho is served cold & was incredibly refreshing! Having only had gazpacho once before, this version was light & packed with a flavorful blend of tomatoes, cucumbers, & peppers. Very good.

---

I have to say the Carne Asada (Hangar Steak) was the highlight of my meal.

The steak was extremely tender & seasoned perfectly with a sprinkle of sea salt. I'm still having dreams about this dish.

It was prepared perfectly.

When steak is grilled over an open flame, it takes on a smokiness that can never be duplicated with any other method of cooking.

Excellent!!

---

The Endibias con queso de cabra y naranjas (Endives) were so fresh & crunchy!

A great starter.

The oranges & almonds were a perfect touch. I thought the oranges would be sweet but they were subtle & juicy. Very good.

---

Gambas al ajillo (Garlic Shrimp). This could be where my extremely uneducated & amateur palate shows brightly... or is it dimly??

I really enjoyed the juicy plump deveined shrimp but the sauce which consists of a sautéed garlic sauce was a bit too pungent for my liking.

Since the garlic was simmering for a while, the garlic became soft & extremely sweet. I am used to a more savory garlicky flavor vice a sweet garlic flavor. Decent, but I would probably pass on this dish the next time.

---

Chicken & Rabbit Paella. The special of the day. The chicken & rabbit were tender & juicy.

I couldn't taste any gaminess with the rabbit which was nice.

I LOVE & SEARCH FOR PAELLA WITH SOCARRAT!! That crispy crunchy rice is so addicting!! Now it very well could be that I shared the BF's order so I waited for him to try it first... but my few bites were not exactly mine-blowing. The flavors were smoky & seasoned perfectly but the soccarat seemed to evade me.

My portion was, dare I say, just a tad bit ""wet"" in consistency. But still delicious.

I truly appreciated the paella being cooked over an open flame which is why I would still recommend the paella!

***

Chef Andrés has proved to me why he is an ever-present force to be reckoned with in the culinary world!

Absolutely amazing service & presentation.

If I could eat like this everyday... I would be even fatter!! But the 3-4 course meal was an experience I would like to have again & again!!

Lunch Like A Spaniard is definitely worth the price! Each dish was just the right amount of food to share & still leave satisfied!!!

I was absolutely mesmerized by the paella station!! It's such a ""poetic"" moment for me to see a dish I love so much be prepared in a authentic paella pan cooked over an open flame!!

To be able to taste the dishes of a renowned chef is always a great moment in my life!!

The menu is loaded with endless Spanish tapas and paellas options. One item that blew my mind was the mini pepito de ibérico, which is a Spanish mini burger made from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed ibérico pigs of Spain with ibérico bacon.

- La Peral con membrillo de peras y anacardos - sharp and creamy, mixed milk blue cheese paired with pear gelée and spiced cashews 
- Lomo ibérico de bellota Fermín - Smoke-cured acorn-fed pork loin

Jaleo in DC was one of our top 5 favorite restaurants.  We were going to be in Vegas for our 34th wedding anniversary and thought we would treat ourselves to a great meal, boy were we wrong.  A pet peeve of mine is patronizing a lovely expensive restaurant for a romantic dinner and being seated right next to another couple when there are plenty of open seats.  We had it happen and watched it happen several times while dining.  There were 75% of the seats empty yet couples being sat right next to another couple.  If the hostess is trained that way to ease the servers so there isn't so much space between tables she needs to be retrained as there were more idle servers, bussers and food deliverers than there were employees working.  We also saw the hostess attempt to seat an elderly couple on a bench seat where gramma would have to climb over big fluffy pillows to get to her seat.  Grampa asked for a different table and after a harumph and an eye roll were moved to one of the many many open tables.  We had reservations for the day we arrived in Vegas,  we got in and settled a little early.  We were hungry so arrived early to see if we could be seated early.  We were greeted warmly and sat immediately at a wooden table that had never been properly laquered and was sticky and had a peeling paint. Looking over the cocktail and beer menu should have been a warning sign.  The specialize in gin and tonics; several different gins and tonics available but not being gin or tonic fans that did not appeal to either of us.  At an upscale restaurant I expect a wine list of at least 10 offering in each category of wine.  Not 10 total wine offerings.  The wine I selected was good and I was happy with it. My husband is a beer snob and was hoping for a nice selection as well.  He was disappointed also.  They had 2 draught offering and the waitress had to check to see if one had been restocked.  They had 5 bottle offerings with one being an NA beer.  We ordered 6 different tapas as well as one of the paella selections; the cheese plate and chorizo plate were the only 2 that we would even consider reordering.  At $10 for a cheese plate I agree with many other reviews on YELP that it should have come with crackers or bread.  The stuffed calamari was tasteless and bland, the rabbit/chicken paella was also tasteless and dry,  the potato wrapped chorizo was crunchy-about all I can say as a positive. The grilled asparagus wasn't cooked long enough,  it had a nice green color but was not tender or tasty.  We left without having dessert, which is a first for us as we just couldn't take any more disappointment.  We predict Jaleo won't be around for our next Vegas trip, as I can't imagine anyone revisiting this restaurant after a dining experience there.",bk6-wnc6ovsBpcOdW4ccvg,0,0,1,ghhhwcOTZ1qVWe8vawRZ5Q

Our waitress was very knowledgable about both the drink menu and dinner menu. Incidentally, the mixologist at this place specializes in gin and tonics. (Score! My fave drink). I started off with a delicious g&t that had mint, cardamom and some lemon in it. The wine menu is pretty extensive, as well, though they only serve Spanish wines....

Since Jaleo serves mostly tapas, we ordered 7 small dishes. The most fabulous of those were the stuffed endives, garlic shrimp and hangar steak. The only plate I didn't care for was some baked shrimp/noodle concoction that had an odd consistency. Overall, the atmosphere is super chill (comfy corner booth situation, dim lights, cool music) and we had a lovely experience.

The Good:
Pan con tamate
Most of its cured meats
Apple and fennel salad
Bacon wrapped dates

The Bad:
The lobster paella--the serving was rather small and the rice tasted like it was doused in salt
Garlic sauteed shrimp--was overcooked, not sure if it's the standard or an anomaly

The best tasting tapas were:
1. Ajo blanco con cangrejo: Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes. -TRUST ME- Just order it and thank me later. 
2. Croquetas de jamón Ibérico:  Traditional fritters with Ibérico ham and a bechemel cream sauce.  -Can't go wrong here!
3. Empanadillas de brandada de bacalao:  'Empanada' of cod brandade with honey.  -Oh so heavenly
4. 'Esqueixada':   Salad of salted cod with black olives and fresh tomato  -It's not really a salad, more like a dip that comes w/ rustic bread. This was absolutely spectacular, despite the fact that i'm not even a huge fish fan.
5. Canelones tradicionales de cerdo, hígado de pato y trufas con salsa bechamel:   Pork, foie gras and truffle canelones with bechamel sauce. - It  tastes as good as it sounds.
6. Jamón Ibérico de bellota Fermin:  Cured ham from the legendary, acorn-fed, black-footed Ibérico pigs of Spain  - We also got the cheese plate which went very well with our Sangria ;) 
7. Mejillones en escabeche:  Mussels marinated in Sherry vinegar - They serve it in a sardine can w/ olive oil and herbs..they melt in your mouth
8. Endivias con queso de cabra y naranjas:  Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds -  fun and refreshing 
9. Ensalada de coles de Bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamón:  Serrano Warm Brussels sprouts salad with apricots, apple and Serrano ham- its one of their most popular dishes...

- Fried squid with aioli - this was gone in a matter of seconds after hitting the table, and 4 friends were in a blissful, happy place. 
- White asparagus with lemon, thyme, Idiazabal cheese - asparagus was cold and crisp, but any lemon and thyme was overpowered by the cheese. Refreshing, but one of the lower impact dishes of the night.
- Veal cheeks with morels and olive oil potato puree - rich and heavenly. 
- Pork and foie canelones with bechamel sauce - again, simply decadent. 
- Vegetable Paella of the day - rice had nice toasty flavor, and vegetables were delicious. Tasty, but not mind-blowing.
- Sauteed wild mushrooms with potato puree - tasty but not mind blowing.
- Organic egg with caviar and caramelized onions - as you'd expect, runny and delicious, with grilled bread to sop it all up.

Prima tempranillo to drink, which was a nice complement.  A decent value for the price of the bottle, not great. Flan for dessert was good, not exceptional.

Service was good - water was refilled frequently. Waitress was a tad bit pushy and her recommendations were pretty vanilla - chicken croquettes, bacon wrapped dates, sauteed spinach... do we LOOK like we're from Topeka?

3853754,2016-12-30,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I'm a huge fan of Jose Andres, but Jaleo was not as impressive as i expected. We had a variety of the small plates and were very disappointed to feel so blah about them.  I have to say that we are all Spaniard and know what spanish food tastes like so had a good basis for comparison (or maybe it's a negative in this case).  

I'll start with the positives;  the cocktails are excellent and the wine selection is good.  The service and servers were all great (Thanks Kristin!).  No complaints whatsoever.

Now the negatives:

The biggest issue and by far most offensive was the tortilla de patatas clasica (potato egg omelette).  if there is one dish that represents spain unequivocably it is the tortilla de patatas.  This is the one thing anyone would expect to be good. this is the one dish every spaniard knows, every mom makes, and is on every menu as a tapa in every bar/restaurant.  Can't get more spanish than this.  What we got was a runny omelette the size of a tea saucer with two pieces of potato and one piece of onion stuck in the middle...literally that's all the potato there was. for an omelette it was fine.  For a tortilla it was tragic and we sent it back.  Anyone who's ever had or seen one would have done the same.  i hope management sees this and looks a little closer.

A few more dishes we had:
-There should have been more bread.  Was not impressed with the mini-baguette type of bread served. It was expensive and not nearly enough of it.
-The patatas bravas were fairly good and presented in a way that i never thought such traditional bar food could look.  Very tasty.  
-The octopus was boring!!  It was cooked to perfection and very tender which is a must for octopus, but pulpo should be flavourful and this was not.  it tasted as if it had just been boiled with a hamhock and put on the plate.  not good.  
-The stuffed olives and liquid olives were great. 
-The asparagus with romescu sauce were a mixed bag: the asparagus beautifully cooked but the sauce was hideous.  Again, another very traditional sauce that should have been great. 
-The stuffed red peppers were full of so much cabrales (bleu) cheese that no other flavours came through which was a shame considering how nice the peppers and sauces tasted on their own. Less would've been more in this case.  
-The scallops were cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious.  amazing! 
-The shrimp in garlic were very nice. Not enough bread to sop up the delicious sauce left at the end.

All in all, it was an ok experience, but I wouldn't go back and I wouldn't recommend it as a place to go for great spanish tapas. It's probably fair to say that if you don't know spanish cuisine you will enjoy this more than we did, so this may not apply to everyone.",ayhw6rdfYXzGzwPGs0tfbw,0,0,2,VaJTdVppMlbqwCm5Ztfu-g

The portions were quite small, even for tapas. They all seemed slapped together too...when you are paying $15-30 a tapa I expect a bit of care...

We asked to switch tables after being seated directly behind a noisy server station. We asked the server if we could keep him and he said the new table would be ""a little too far"" what?? seriously?

We hadn't even ordered any food at this point, and then our new server came over, and with no introduction, or ""sorry the other table was noisy, is this table better? she simply just said ""do you want to add anything?"" She seemed like more of an order taker than a server, with other tables around us too.

Overall, the servers seemed to be more into socializing with eachother, even the managers. We had a female manager circle around our table twice, and she asked a table of two older genteman twice how everything was, but never stopped by us once, or any other tables in the area, that we noticed. 

We felt like we were more at the Plant Hollywoood of Tapas....servers who seem to be interested more in eachother, or being somewhere else completely, and an air that we are just ""tourists"".  And food that is put together for the masses..

My husband and I have actually worked in a restaurant in Times Square, so I get the frustration of working with certain types of tourists, or especially foreign tourists that don't think they need to tip, or tip really poorly...but there are still tourists who appreciate dining, and superb service, and will tip for it.

What we got was so disappointing! To start off, the ambiance of this restaurant sucks. It's loud and the chairs are super uncomfortable. It's not a ""dressy"" place at all, it doesn't even feel like a ""nice"" place. The people sitting next to us looked like they had come right from the pool and overall the vibe was super casual.  Service was spotty at best, except that 3 times they tried to take away our dishes when there were still several bites left. Excuse me!

The food was fine. It wasn't bad. There was nothing amazing or creative about this food at all, just your standard Spanish Tapas.  The only thing that was unique was the fact that they served chicken fritters in an old shoe. When we asked the waitress about the significance of the shoe she just said ,"" I get asked that so much.

With the plethora of AMAZING other places to eat in Vegas and in the cosmopolitan hotel, Jaleo is not a place I would waste my time eating.

Gin and Fever Tree tonic, presented in a wine glass containing exactly one spherical ice cube and garnished with juniper berries, a slice of lemon, and lemon verbena goes down smooth - what's not to like there? Nothing. 

As a party of six, we headed the waiters advice and ordered 2-3 items per person - a few at a time, starting with the pan con tomate and progressing  from there to meats and cheeses, on to vegetables and seafood, and finally to some meat dishes. We ended up ordering additional orders of a few items , such as the gambas al aljilio and the brussel sprout salad. These are items not to miss.  Other standout items include the olives (including 'liquid' olives, a simple delight of molecular gastronomy) and the secreto Iberico, which we ordered at the very land, when we were still just a little hungry - and ended up devouring. All of this food went perfectly with a well-priced Rioja.

Dessert was a bit of a hit and a bit of a miss. The flan tradicional was one of the best specimens of that dish that I've ever had. In fact, self proclaimed haters of flan were devouring it along with the rest of us. The cafe solo (espresso) is the best I've had outside of Italy. The big down was the apple tart - which wasn't really very apple-y or tarty. We could have done with out this.

Well, that was a long introduction. It's also everything that's right with Jaleo. They take the finest of Spanish tapas that can be reproduced at a level equal to, or better, than you will find in the best places in Spain, and leave out the ones that can't be duplicated properly.

3946645,2012-08-14,8,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Oh Jaleo, you bring out the worst in me.

I'm one of those eaters that: (1) has zero patience to read a menu, especially when most of it is in a foreign language; (2) if I can't decide what I want, I pester the server and neighboring diners for recommendations; and (3) knows exactly what I want and how I want it.  Jaleo, for better or worse, hits all four proverbial nails.

Jaleo's menu isn't the biggest, but there are a large number of dishes offered.  And most of it is in Spanish.  Unless you read the English description.  Well, as I said before, I have no patience to read every description to settle on a handful of openers.  Which sucks because we ended up with the cod empanadas, which, oh, btw, doesn't really have any cod in it.  It's basically a fish cream that's been deep fried in thin and crisp empanada shell with some honey drizzled on it.  You might like it and love it, but my friends and I could not stomach this to save our lives.  We Fear Factored the shmuck who ordered it as punishment.  Yes, he smelled like fish after that.  The menu doesn't suck if you read Spanish.  Or you have the patience to actually read everything.  Deal killer?  Nope, because...

...I pester people to give strong recommendations.  Sucks for everyone else except me!  Using this method, we stumbled across a ginfully good Gin & Tonic.  They ship their ice sphere (don't call it a ball) from their sister ship in LA.  Seriously.  The care and attention that goes into this one drink suggests that they care about all of their products (apparently even that cod cream).  Speaking of attention, the food in the shoe definitely grabbed ours, as we promptly ordered the delectable pollo croquetas (sp?) that occupy the footwear.  Those little morsels of what tasted like really good creamed chicken in a crunchy fried shell are really yum.  Another great recommendation was that we try their off-menu paella (I don't know what it's called because we said we'd take it before the server even described it).  To our surprise it was loaded with a whole lobster tail, a giant lobster claw (a bitch to break open), a few prawns and a few muscles.  Killer good that dish, but...

...not as good as the Iberico Short Rib Paella recommended on my first visit.  It was so rich and tasty that we wanted another plate.  I daydream about it.  I drool uncontrollably.  My second visit to Jaleo was specifically to have this dish again.  Upon sitting, before ordering drinks or even water, we asked for, nay DEMANDED this paella.  To which our humble server replied they were not going to be making it.  At all.  For the rest of the night.  Once the tears stopped, I pulled myself together with a wonderful Gin & Tonic, had some pretty good dishes (like the potato wrapped chorizo and roast quail) then went over to Blue Ribbon for oxtail fried rice to dull the pain...but that's for another review.  

Yeah, Jaleo, you've got a lot going for you.  Your food's mostly good.  But I think I need Rosetta Stone and some valium to get through the menu.  And you need to get some more damn Iberico short ribs for the best paella in the world!",9aHS1o9JVm04buXN9PgE4Q,11,9,4,EjBZe7xAXiX7o6jMe0tcJA

First time trying Spanish cuisine so I didn't have much expectation. The place serves tapas style dishes, so it's best if each of your group orders 1-2 and all share. They have their paella made in the middle of the restaurant, so you can look at the whole process like a show. They only serve one type of paella for the day. We were pretty lucky to go on the day they served lobster paella.

Their lobster paella which was very delicious. Not overly salty or burnt like I've had at other places. The plate set up was vibrant in colors making my tummy growl. We also ordered their veal cheeks, which was very tender and juicy. I had this caviar and yolk bread spread too but it wasn't extremely impressive.

Here's a break down of what we ordered:

Sopa de ajo - Nice presentation, but was esstientially turkey gravy. It was so salty and nobody wanted to eat it.

San Simon con garapinado de frutos secos - two slices of okay cheese and a little bit of nut brittle for $10 (LOL).

Jamon Iberico de bellota Fermin - one of the only two things I would eat again. This also came with a soggy slice of bruschetta for everyone which was gross.

Croquetas de setas - was suppose to be fried mushroom fritters. Didn't taste any mushrooms.

Coca con erizos de mar - the only other thing I would eat. Uni and iberico bacon on a slice of bread. Thank god their uni is fresh.

Costillas de cordero con salsa romero y alioli de miel - You can't even see the grill marks on the lamb. It was barely grilled to the point that you can tell they boiled it first in water and then put on some lame ass grill with no firepower to simulate grilled lamb. It was also not tender at all.

Paella Valenciana 'Rafael Vidal' - mushy rice with chicken bone bits that hurts your teeth if you're not careful when chewing. So much tomato sauce.

Arroz a banda con gambas - undercooked rice with this bad fishy shrimp taste.

Vieiras con piniones y PX - they should use whatever they used to grill the scallops in this dish to grill the fucking lambs. 

Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' - nothing special. You can make this at home yourself and taste the exact same.

Honestly, this place is not worth even a tiny bit compared to what they are charging you per dish. Maybe if you wanted to try the jamon iberico. We left hungry and disappointed. Just go to taco bell and you will feel less hungry and disappointed.",Cg_Jg85xHMEVoDEf3bhuGg,1,0,1,87rKdvoOj4m0CqrKAMK9Fg

The initial greet with the hostess was great! Super friendly and sat is immediately.

We were greeted by Eric who brought us water and would be right back to take our beverage order. It took exactly 9 minutes for him to return to take our first round. It was frustrating so we decided to order as much as possible.

I ordered the 2 cone of the salmon tartar and asked if there was any onions. He said there were shallots but would ask if it could be omitted. He never er came back!!! The salmon came out before our wine? I guess timing was off. We then wanted the paella but were limited to two options reasoning they like to circulate the menu. Ok?

3980645,2013-05-24,4,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Just perusing some of the reviews, I sometimes find it hilariously amusing at what people say they are upset about.  ""I can't find it....too confusing.....""  Really?  Good grief.

Jaleo was very good.  In fact, borderline excellent minus one total miss on a dish.  If you don't know, or are challenged like a few reviewers who ""couldn't find it"", it is in the Cosmopolitan, if I remember right, on the 3rd floor.  We took the very brilliant route of ""reading the sign"" that said what floor it was on and took the escalator up.  

The space is beautiful, as most new restaurants in the newer hotels are.  Our server was sleepwalking a bit, but the food made up for it.  

The salmon crudo and roe in a ""cone"" was a real showstopper.  Just delicious, and what we started off with (though we ordered 2 more).  We proceeded with some dry-cured Chorizo which was also really delicious.  The ""bikini de jamon"" were very tasty (little pressed sandwiches) as well as the chicken fritters which literally melted in your mouth.  The meal was really on fire until we hit the paella, which is supposed to be their specialty.  You basically take whichever one they are serving at the time, and ours was chicken and rabbit.  The bottom line is that the meat was severely overcooked.  If it had not been for the amazing dishes before, that would have been a catastrophe, but taken overall, the meal was still great.  

We had a monster caraffe of Sangria which was solid, but that is not what you should order.  You order your drinks from an iPad they give you, and the first one you see is ""the world's best"" gin and tonic.  The server played it up, so we thought what the hell.  We ended up trying all 3 and they were absolutely outstanding.  Really delicious stuff and a must try!

Overall, very solid.  Ignore the nonsensical reviews talking about ""small portions"" and outrageous prices.  I've said this in other reviews, if you walk into a Vegas restaurant in a newer Hotel looking for a bargain, you are just a little out of your comfort zone (how was that for PC??).  They are all stupidly expensive, and in any major city you can have as good or better for less, but this is Vegas.  So either expect it or save it from your dumb review.

Jaleo was our last dinner outing on a recent Vegas trip and it did not disappoint. The food was outstanding from start to finish. A trendy decor perfectly at home in the Cosmo proved to be the perfect setting for a style of dining that encourages a communal experience.

The menu spans multiple regions of Spain and showcases some of their most popular cuisine. Jamón ibérico and paella are probably the best known dishes to an American audience but Jaleo's menu goes far beyond the staples offering a unique mix with something for every palate.

The Good: Jaleo's menu features a number of different paellas, but keep in mind that they rotate on a nightly basis, also make sure to order them early as they take 45 minutes to prepare. We opted for the vegetable paella which was packed with flavor. The rice was a perfect al-dente and had a nice bite to it. The portion was a bit on the small side so be sure to order 2 if you have a larger group. The Jamón ibérico did not disappoint either. Sliced paper-thin, the fat marbled ham had a great saltiness finished with hit of acorn. Another standout were the Croquetas De Pollo (chicken fritters). They weren't unlike risotto balls I've had in the past with a molten cheese center. They were a nice balance to the bold, spicy flavors of the other dishes. Ultimately you really can't go wrong with anything on Jaleo's menu. We sampled about 10-12 dishes total and they were all outstanding. Be sure to start your meal with one of the restaurant's signature gin and tonics.

The Bad: Nothing bad to report. We did have to wait an extra 15 minutes past our reservation to be seated, but the friendly bar tenders took good care of us while we waited. The service was also a bit slow, but that's more attributed to just how busy the restaurant was. Make sure you book a table in advance.

I thought the best part was that everybody in our party of four left happy. There were veggie lovers, seafood lovers, and meat lovers, and everybody raved about the food.

As far as I can remember, this is what we had (with english names):
pan con tomate with cheese (good, but nothing exciting)
chorizo (excellent)
endives with goat cheese (loved)
gazpacho (best ever - could have eaten way more)
chorizo wrapped in potatoes and fried (awesome - like a fancy snack food, favorite of the table)
chicken croquettes (very good - don't know why they came in a shoe and neither did the waiters)
egg with caviar and onions (very good, but I wish there were less onions - they totally overpowered the caviar)
veal cheeks with potatoes (awesome)
skirt steak (very good)
bottle of wine (don't remember what it was, but it was something none of us had ever had, recommended by the waiter)

4106026,2018-03-10,1,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Jaleo is located on the third floor of the sprawling Cosmopolitan hotel. It was packed when we arrived at 7:30 on a weekday and people kept streaming in. The focal point of the restaurant is definitely the large pit in the back where several different vats of paella and being made. (While we didnt, if you order a pan for the table the chefs shout out, and there is a large procession to the table in questions - quite a scene).

The menu is extensive, in tapas style and my family ordered a bunch to share.

We had:
Dry - Cured Chorizo: good flavor but was served with some pretty plain breadsticks.
Tortilla: a classic spanish omelette made with potatoes and onion, was delicious with great consistency.
Paella of the Day: traditional Valencian style with chicken and rabbit, rather than chorizo and seafood. I quite enjoyed it. 
Garlic Shrimp: served in a yummy, spicy olive oil. This one was gone in a flash and I even used the bread to soak up all the sauce.
Croquetas de Pollo: classic and delicious with a nice mustard sauce.
Chickpea Salad: my mom insisted on this one. She always wants to keep meals light, which this was. On the whole not bad, but you could tell it was not a speciality of the restaurant.
Aceitunas: while not my favorite, definitely the most unique dish of the night. Essentially olives two ways with a few olives stuffed with anchovies as well as 4 ""liquid olives"" which burst in your mouth.
Hanger Steak: enough said.
Chorizo wrapped in Crispy Potato: my only real disappointment of the night. Essentially tasted like a greasy spring roll. The chorizo tasted lower quality then the rest of the food overall and the potato had no flavor.
Flan: yummy end to the night with a light and airy flan pairing surprisingly well with cream and oranges and sorbet.

Service was a bit pushy but overall very polite. My parents were unimpressed that on the next table croquettes were served in a shoe, an actual black shoe. Seemed like an odd gimic, but then again, it is Las Vegas. Overall we had a nice meal, albeit expensive, paired with some good wine and cocktails.

High quality, fresh, and tasty food is abundant here.  The egg tortilla was simply the best egg dish I have ever consumed in my life.  But the prices are pretty high for small portions.  I know you are supposed to share multiple dishes, but there isn't a whole lot in each dish to share.  Splitting with two people is ok, but with a larger group?  Forget about it.

It is Hendricks Gin, finished in a large Bordeaux style wine glass (or so it seemed) and poured skillfully over a spherical ice cube.. said to ""keep the cocktail at an even temperature throughout the life of the drink"" .. and so it did. Garnished with Juniper leaves and berries, it was really the most beautiful Gin and Tonic I have had.. (ive had many, many...)and at $17 a pop, you would want nothing less. 

This was not my first time at Jaleo, but it was definitely the most thorough meal I have experienced in the establishment. Usually a bite or two of a small plate or three, and I'm golden with cocktails and good company. 

This time it was all that and more with the addition of some fantastic roasted lamb and house paella.. which this night was rabbit, chicken and vegetable. Finished with the most excellent custard dessert served aside a citrus spuma and orange 'ice-cream'.. it was a perfect pairing with glass of 15 yr aged Spanish sherry. Couldn't have asked for more in the flavor department.

So here's the food breakdown

Selection of all cheeses   18.
Pasamontés  Manchego, Idiazábal, Murcia al vino, Garrotxa, Caña de cabra, La Peral

     * Delicious! Came with Fresh Raisens on the vine, dried apricots and roasted almonds
---

Jamón Ibérico de bellota 'Fermin'
Cured ham from the legendary, acorn-fed,Black footed Ibérico pigs of Spain   22

     * This was the best ham I've ever had. And it had better be for over $5 a micro-thin slice. All 5 pieces makes up one regular piece of bacon. That's one expensive piece of bacon!
---

Ajo blanco con cangrejo
Chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes  12

     * This definitely took a bit of getting used to. I love vinegar, and that's a good thing considering that's exactly what this tasted like. Vinegar with Cream with little bits of fresh lobster and grape halves. 
---

Piquillo relleno de 'txangurro'
Piquillo peppers stuffed with Dungeness crabmeat  14

     * 2 pieces. This was pretty hearty. The peppers were nothing special but the sauce and crab were yummy. 
---

Gambas al ajillo
The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic  10

     * 5-6 shrimp. AWESOME! Favorite so far

Trigueros con romesco
Grilled asparagus with romesco sauce  12

     * Nothing special. 5 spears of asparagus. Plain sauce
---

Huevo frito con caviar
A fried organic egg topped with caviar  16

     * This just tasted like a poached egg that you dip bread into. The caviar was so light you could not taste it unless you ate it seperately. 
---

Carne asada con piquillos Julián de Lodosa
Grilled hanger steak with piquillo pepper confit  14

     * 7 slices, 3-4oz? Again, nothing special. Cooled perfectly.  
---

Canelones tradicionales de cerdo, hígado de 
pato y trufas con salsa bechamel
Pork, foie gras and truffle canelones with bechamel sauce  14

     * This was absoloutely my fav after the shrimp. A bit salty but Mmm! Warm and hearty, the truffle flavor standing out. Delicious!
---

Lobster Paella 28

     * Total disappointment. The presentation was gorgeous, the Paella tasted like rice cooked in the juices of lobster, extremely salted. We left more than half of it on the plate. We ate the half tail and claw. 


I really wanted to try the Sangria but they do not sell by the glass, another disappointment.

I had loved my previous experiences but my experience at Jaleo in Las Vegas (located in the Cosmopolitan hotel) fell short of my expectations.  The food was mediocre and REALLY not worth the prices charged... 

I visited by myself during lunch before my friends arrived at the hotel for my friend's bachelorette party weekend.  I decided to get a nice meal and a drink to while away the time, since I got there extremely early (yay for flying in from the East Coast!).  I ordered a berry cocktail, which was nice, but a bit watered down and not worth the $16 it cost.

I went with their lunch special, which was $26 for salad, gazpacho soup, and paella.  I was hoping for something substantial, but the food was disappointing.  The salad consisted of a few pieces of lettuce with not much sauce or anything special to it.  The gazpacho soup was good, but small.  And the paella?  It took forever to come out (at least 20 minutes) and it was a TINY portion!  I was not full leaving the restaurant.

Service was decent (I was one of the only ones there because it was so early), but my server misunderstood me when I said I wanted tap water and brought out a bottle of still water.  He was nice when I described the misunderstanding and did not charge me for it - I really appreciated that and reflected my appreciation in the tip.

Overall, though the service was good, I did not enjoy the food. Total rip-off. I would not recommend this restaurant.  I will still visit other Jaleo restaurants in the future (in the DC area, where I live), but I would not visit the one in Vegas again.",kKTcYPz47sCDH1_ylnE4ZQ,3,3,2,K_0aPgBIzK-8CHbCarJo9Q

This is average, uninspired tapas style cuisine.  Their squid ink calamari is sickly pungent and raw (uncooked?), the paella was overly salty and was served on a white ceramic plate instead of a rustic skillet or pan.  The other 10+ dishes we had were forgettable and either lacked or bore too much flavor. 

Lazy, unenthused service (we waited 15 mins for the bottle of wine we ordered.  When finally asked, our server informed us the bottle was sold out.  No explanation regarding the time we were left hanging, no apologies, zero level of care).  That being said, some of their younger male wait staff were polite and professional.

Mediocre value, at best. Yes, this is the Cosmopolitan and an upmarket location - but if you are going to bend me over the barrel whilst I dine, at least serve me larger portions or improve the quality of your food. 

The best thing about this place was the fact they serve Estrella on tap.

There are really only a couple that are my ""standards"" that I always go to when I'm in town.  

I spent a little time in Spain and fell in love with Tapas, but to me, Tapas is also an atmosphere and this is Vegas and its trendy and not as enjoyable as being in a small bar in Spain eating some great Tapas that were just made.  I'm used to the menu being written on a small chalkboard or on the wall and not a fancy menubook or a wine list on an iPad.

Nevertheless, there are some great dishes here worth trying.
1.  Olives/liquid olives - the kalamata liquid olive concoction was fun and tasty and we laughed when the little olive balls popped open.  As long as you like olives, you should get these.
2.  Veal cheeks - if you are weary about eating these, stop reading this, turn off your computer, and go get a plain ol' burger you loser...these were really awesome.  One of the girls in our party got really upset when the waitress took the plate and there was still a little bit of potato and sauce left in the bowl.  Bummer.  We shared this with a group of four and it was perfect because given the richness, any more than a couple of bites would have been overkill and there was more food to try.  But I would order this every time I come to Jaleo.
3.  Ham fritters - delicious.  Why would you want to get chicken here?
4.  Bacon wrapped dates - I get these whenever I see them on a menu and they were great here.
5.  Skirt steak - reminded me of when I was in Spain because a piece of skirt steak, with some roasted red peppers, and frites was a staple meal.  Would have been happy if I didn't have to share this one.
6.  Paella - it was the lobster one.  They make one large batch(of varying ingredients) every 45 minutes or so, so you can get the one just made hopefully, or wait a short while and get some after some other tapas.  We started out with this and it was just okay.  I would just rather order Paella at a restaurant that specialized in that, so you get the pan and a chance at the socarrat, because it was a little cold and just tasted okay.  If you don't know what socarrat is, google it...its important.
7.  Chorizo - tasted good but not wowed.
8.  Bread with tomato and Manchego - okay, but would rather have just had some Manchego by itself.  

We did have a nice bottle of Albarino that ran about 100 bucks.  While Patatas Bravas is an absolute for me when I go out for Tapas, they don't make them the traditional way here and I appreciate our server letting us know that.  So we passed on those this time.

I would recommend swinging by for a little wine and a few tapas before dinner somewhere else(see above list/Top 5).  The restaurant smells fantastic which is almost worth a short visit in of itself.

1) Ajo Blanco Con Cangrejo - chilled almond and garlic soup with crabmeat and green grapes    This coarse soup is very tasty; the grapes were thinly sliced instead of just a whole grape.  Highly recommend.

2)  Ostras 'gin & Tonic' five oysters with lemon, gin and tonic 
Be sure to slurp the wonderful tasting gin sauce before enjoying the oyster.

3)  Remolacha Con Cítricos
a salad of red beets, citrus, la peral cheese and pistachios with sherry dressing 

Tasty and a nice pallette cleanser between tapas....

4) pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce 
Unique way to serve foie gras - and enjoyable.  Since we live in a state where foie gras is illegal, it was so fun (yet naughty) to enjoy such a fun dish. As mentioned by others they are like foie gras cannelonis.

5)  Bikini De Jamón Ibérico, Queso Manchego Y Trufas
pressed sándwich of ibérico ham, manchego cheese and truffles

The truffles makes this a unique smooth and enjoyable dish.

We enjoyed sangria with dinner.....

and then we had their wonderful cappuchinos and desert of 


    Pan Con Chocolate

    chocolate custard with caramelized bread, olive oil and brioche ice cream

Olive oil ice cream - yum, the best.  

This is our second visit to Jaleo and the food was as good and as unique as our first visit.  Our server was good, but not as wonderful as our first visit. Our first visit the server went out of her way to recommend and delight us with her recommendations for both alcohol and tapas to order.

4253353,2012-10-18,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Probably some of the best food I've eaten ever. Seriously. There were 4 of us and we indulged by ordering probably close to 20 different tapas dishes. The bill was outrageous but worth every penny. 

A few highlights: 
- The croquettes were served in a sneaker. Yes, a running sneaker. Not sure why, but it was cool all the same.
- This place is in the Cosmopolitan which is a hip hotel in Vegas. This place may be trying to be a little too hip. It was too bright and felt like it was in the middle of a mall. You could see everyone walking by outside. Granted, it's in a Las Vegas hotel/casino so we knew there'd be some level of loud excitement surrounding us, just not so much. 
-   Service was good, but odd. We never really knew who our waiter was. It kept changing. 
- We did not eat one bad dish. Some were better than others, but none were bad.
- Bread was hard to come by. Tapas often had incredibly delicious sauces (the ""mojo"" for example) and it's a shame to waste that sauce. We asked for bread to dip and got 3 little tiny pieces (for $3). It was not enough bread, at all. We ordered a few more of them. This did not spoil our appetite one bit. 

A few of my favorite tapas: 
- Grilled asparagus with Romesco sauce - the Romesco was incredible
- Croquettas de pollo (my Cuban mother-in-law makes really good croquettes but these blew hers away!) Creamy inside, crunchy outside, so much flavor  
- Papas arugas - The mojo made this dish! Without it, this is basically just salted, boiled tiny potatoes.  Thanks to a duo of mojo's (verde and rojo) this dish delicious
- Warm Brussels sprouts salad - this had a really nice citrus flavor to it and was like no flavor combination I've ever had with Brussels sprouts before 
- Fried dates in bacon with an apple mustard sauce - like candy. Seriously. 
- Seared scallop with pine nuts - melt in your mouth good 
- Mussels vinaigrette - plump and juicy mussels with aromatic broth - another reason we needed all that bread! 
- Grilled hangar steak with mustard sauce and blue cheese - incredibly tender and great combination of flavors 
- Shrimp sautéed with garlic - it's a traditional tapas dish but it tasted better than any other version of this I've had before 
- Oysters gin & tonic - I can't eat raw oysters for a few more months but my tablemates raved about the gin & tonic sauce 

Just ok: 
- Pan con tomate with manchego cheese. Not bad at all, just not earth shattering 
- Jamon Iberico - it was from some fancy black footed pig in Spain. It wasn't bad but it wasn't all that great either. It was the most expensive thing we ordered that night  
- Homemade grilled pork sausage - I'm not a huge sausage fan in general (get your mind out of the gutter, THAT's not what I mean). This was not bad at all but just not one of my favorites  

I know there was more but this is all I can remember. We had no room for dessert. The 3 folks at the table who aren't pregnant polished off several carafes of Sangria and seemed very please with it, and with themselves.  We finished with coffee and each one came in it's own little press (Spanish press, not French I guess) and a timer to tell you when to ""press"". The concept was great but servers came over and pressed for us before the time was up. We were all disappointed that we didn't get to press our own. Silly for us to care, I know - but why bother giving you a timer and telling you what to do if they're just going to do it for you!

4294799,2012-07-13,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I came here with a group of friends for my birthday dinner. We had the 13 course tasting menu. 

Some initial downsides were: very crowded and has an ""energetic"" environment. It's difficult to get them to agree to a large dinner, and when they do, you have to do a tasting course. When you do the tasting course you have to sign a contract. If you sign the contract you guarantee the # of folks in your party.

In our case, half the table decided they didn't want to eat and so they walked out. This left me arguing with the F&B manager for the night, who produced a copy of the contract - that was oddly missing the page where I wrote that the size of the party could change (and signed off on by the F&B manager for the restaurant)

I seriously argued with this person for over 20 minutes going back and forth as to the best course of action, while all my guests sat waiting. On my birthday dinner. 

Eventually we reached a draw and decided to just eat. So the food started coming and it was actually AMAZING! It has been a minute so I forget ALL the courses but here are the ones I remember:

- the bruschetta w/ tomato - amazing. I still think about it. 
- dates w/ bacon 
- the paella of course

Unfortunately there were more issues...after the first 4-5 courses came out, we sat for 30 minutes without a single additional course coming. This was actually a good thing (wait and see). After pointing out to the waiter that no food was coming to our table, he went back to the kitchen and did something because orders started coming out, but not in the order on the menu. My guess would be that the kitchen fell behind on our table, got yelled at, and fired whatever they could get immediately. So props to them for getting things moving.

Dessert was delicious. The wine list was amazing. 

And, our F&B minimum was eventually adjusted due to the failure at the table. 

Following are my recommendations for this spot:

- it's too high volume for a large group. Come in smaller groups (less than 10) and order off the menu instead of getting a tasting menu.

- don't sign a contract because if things don't go your way, they'll be inflexible and refuse to work with you, even a little bit.

- if you do sign a contract then get the private room at least. 

I'm giving this spot 5 stars for the food and taking 3 stars away for the awful customer service.",-c9G-JHNqrPY0_UU9j7BJA,0,0,2,6r3NtMiWByCfN1QKcgijlA

We were seated immediately for our reservation and greeted by our friendly waiter, who made some great suggestions for the tapas style dishes.

We started with jamon iberico.....OMG...melt in your mouth, salty, nutty goodness of the iberico pig.  We were both in awe....we started to feel much better about our meal here after that.

We then had the liquid olives....how do they do that?  I think the liquid olives tasted more like olives than the actual stuffed olives that came with it.  Both were soooo good!

After that, we had the spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato...perfect combo.  Loved the flavor of the spicy chorizo...left a bit of heat but not too much.

My larger dish pick was the Rossejat....paella made with angel hair like pasta and shrimp.  There was ham in there as well.  Delicious!!  I especially loved the crispy edges that burned a little against the cast iron skillet.  It was served with some garlic butter sauce, which I dipped the shrimps in....just heavenly.

My BF's pick of the night was Secreto Iberico....the skirt steak of the iberico pig, which came with pan con tomate.  This was THE BEST pork dish we both have ever had.  It was so juicy, tender, flavorful....ok, I'm drooling just thinking about that wonderful piece of meat....mmmmm.  Pan con tomate was good too, but nothing compared to this piece of meat.  I think we'll be dreaming about it until the next time we can hit Vegas again.

Dessert - flan and some apple tart thing...can't remember the exact name, but also very delicious.  Apple and cinnamon wrapped in brioche with vanilla bean ice cream...so good.  Flan had a bit of a citrus taste to it but the consistancy was perfect.  

If you're anywhere near Vegas, go here and try the secreto iberico.  You will not be disappointed.  Skip China Poblano and head straight here to Jaleo...I wish we had, so we could've had time to have it twice!!!",WkG9phTuWbhAC0z4354mrg,1,1,5,_BUswj8abtyV0lZ305XkTQ

1) really fun atmosphere
2) pricy for what you get, but that's Vegas
3) decent food

Came to Jaleo really late on Friday night with a co-worker. As you expect at a nicer Vegas restaurant it was super busy so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and helped my co-worker and I pick out a few tapas. Prepare to pay between $14 and $30 per small plate, which is expensive for tapas but Vegas in General is expensive. I had a sparkling sangria coupon (woohoo!) so I ordered that. The drink was okay but like some other reviewers mentioned not as good as some of the other drinks I've had at other Jose Andres restaurants. We ordered a chorizo, and a shrimp tapa. Both were pretty good, unfortunately neither were as warm as I felt they should be but the flavor was great. We didn't do the paella which is a big deal here! I think how it works is they switch which paella they make every few minutes and when they switch the chefs ring a big bell and everyone yells ""Jaleo!!"". It was fun and you kind of felt like you were at a party! 

Overall, Jaleo is definitely worth a try if you are a Jose Andres fan and staying in the area but you could probably find a better tapas restaurant on the strip.",Q1IENmNc6bdDruACmhy4mg,2,2,4,-Yeyu_A0XvCCVZ9k2p8LIA

Started with one of each of the house specialty GIN cocktails which were to die for!!!!! $20 each. Ordered and received in less then 3 minutes. 

Started with the house special black foot ham at $35 an oz it was WELL worth it. Nutty, robust amazing! 

Chicken croquettes served in a shoe. Tasted almost like a chicken pot pie, but in a light breading. 

House chorizo wrapped in potato chips. 

Octopus served salad style and we loved it so much we had the octopus with potatoes too. One was boiled one was sautéed yet both seemed boiled. Still great. 

Oysters with gin and tonic... Yup. No seasoning needed. 

The house shrimp tapa, was a must try!! Sauce was some of the best I've ever had. 

Finished with the NZ lamb
 
 And the house pork dish which I expected a tiny bit more from, yet still some of the best pork I've ever eaten. 

Enjoyed a 06 red from Spain and fished with the flan.

Out Server Eric  failed to ask if this was our first time at Jaleos and didn't really bother to explain any specialty or popular items.  So we proceeded to order somewhat blindly .  We ordered two glasses of wine , the tuna tartare, the pork loin and chorizo clams. We really wanted the paella but were told we only had two options. We opted to not order the paella as we were looking for a seafood paella .  

Our tuna tartare comes before out wine. When we received the tuna tartare it was rather underwhelming, two very tiny cones. The pork loin was very thinly sliced . Once we were done with the first two items we were told they didn't have any clams available . At which point we decided to get the check and proceed to a different restaurant.

The food that came out was definitely interesting and generally tasty, and of a decent variety. But, being tapas, there was about one bite of everything for each person. In the end we got a good number of different tapas (needing about 2 or 3 of each to feed our table of 8). I really liked the bacon-wrapped dates, the (lamb?) ribs, and this one dish with some kind of spread with an underdone hard-boiled egg that you put on bread. I was less impressed with the paella, the shrimp, and the bruschetta-like dishes. The restaurant also claims it has the world's best gin and tonic...and while it was tasty and really well-done, I wasn't crazy enough about it to want a second one.

All in all, the food was fine, but the high price tag just didn't seem to correspond to how much I enjoyed the food.

It is a very unique menu and you can easily stray outside you culinary comfort zone and be pleasantly surprised at every turn. The veal cheeks, jamon iberico and spinach salad were off the chart good. There wasn't anything I wouldn't be willing to try here (High praise).

The service was good and the waiter's recommendations were all spot on. The only lag was before dessert and it was unnecessarily long. It was ""can we go and just skip dessert"" long. Glad we didn't because dessert was great too.

The biggest knock was where they sat us. We had a large party and they sat us outside the restaurant in a foyer area. The people watching was great but it was really loud and you felt like some drunk stranger was going to walk up and grab something off your plate.

Other than that, this was a 5 star experience.

Their other dishes are inspired by traditional Spanish plates. In my opinion, they fall very short of their mark. If you're looking for authentic tapas, look elsewhere.

4407161,2015-12-12,4,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"This is one of my favorite restaurants and I have been here so many times...I love the Bazaar in LA and that's how I found out about this restaurant, as I'm a huge fan of Jose Andres. 

The food is usually consistently good and the last time I was there it left a bad taste in my mouth and figured maybe someone who cared at the restaurant would maybe read:


To starts...the server was pretentious and rolled his eyes at me asking for something different. (I know difficult people who order, and I'm not one of them. I think I asked for no onion.. Something that wasn't a big deal...). I always order their expensive ham. The stuff from Spain that is ridiculously priced but so delicious.. I always say what the hell. 

Well, most normal servers bring extra bread when you ask for extra bread... This server literally ended up charging me like 15.00 for every few pieces of bread they brought... After over $45.00 extra dollars w tax..I HAD to say something on principle. 

Well, apparently this is 'bread from Spain..' (I don't even know wtf that even means... Unless they're literally overnighting loaves of bread in from Spain... Doubtful). And Also the server let me know that I didn't clarify when I said, ""can you bring extra bread for the table,"" I wasn't specific enough, etc'. 

I say.. Ok fine... Side note: after the waiter and manager continued to make me feel like no one else in the world could EVER make this mistake...not even flinching or offering to take any of the $45.00 Spanish bread off the bill- I debate in my mind if I should just let it go... Or again on principle.. Explain to them why they NEED to understand where I'm coming from or at least pretend to.. Because when someone orders extra bread for the table... The server SHOULDN'T presume that what is meant.. Is that they want the special Spanish bread that is $15.00 an order!!! Am I right or am I VERY right??? (At the risk of already being dubbed, that table w the annoying white girl who won't stfu about her bread... I just decided to go all the way and let them hate me... I was too far in to stop..)

So, I tell them that the last several times I've been here... My servers just act normal about it... See I'm spending like $80.00 on a few pieces of ham alone... And bring a few extra slices of bread.. Of their 'Spanish' bread... I told them this and said... I don't care what bread you bring... Just not the kind that costs $15.00 for 4 slices that you ring in 3X on my bill. The manager basically reiterated that I was incorrect for feeling any 'kind of way' about this, reminded me the bread is from SPAIN!! and made me feel like an even bigger jackass for continuing to say something. 

Let's say I was 100% wrong about this.. (Doubtful, but still..) .. They should make me feel like I am totally right cuz I'm the customer. Now... I've worked in so many restaurants and NEVER ever gave any clients or customers attitudes because that's just not the way this world works. The customer is and should always FEEL like they are right. 



After this, the passive aggressive manager showed me that he removed my Spanish bread from the bill...Then preceded to send over 3 baskets of their house bread when the meal was over, to make me feel like an even bigger jerk. The bread baskets were literally on top of one another with the black book check also on the table. 

I am not a fan of people giving restaurants 1 or 2 stars based on poor service if the food is consistent. And that's why this mark isn't lower. It should be a 1 star but the food is usually great. My problem with this experience is I wouldn't even classify this event as someone having a bad day. They repeatedly had many chances to make this bread fiasco just go away... And they enjoyed flexing their 'power' and making me feel bad/ awful about the entire situation. I used to go here once every 3 months... I haven't been back since this happened and don't intend to, as I can find equally great food with amazing service else where. Food for thought.",T-gxHfxtweNGSIKj1eDIsg,9,3,3,vnpl0Hzt7dqMqgHt6hOL2g

Here's what we ordered:
Chicken and mushroom pallella- chicken was very dry

Garlic shrimp- lots of broth and not a lot of shrimp.

So it won't come as any surprise that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal at his Vegas outpost.  Much better atmosphere and vibe than his DC restaurant by the same name, although nothing can compare to the culinary madness of his Hollywood outpost, Bazaar.

As other reviewers have commented, the plates are small, and the prices are a tad on the high side.  But as usual with Andres, the dishes are creative, the presentation is beautiful, and the ingredients are outstanding.

The pan con tomate was very authentic and the bread was great.  The seleccion de embutidos (various Spanish hams and sausages) was of course amazing (you can't screw up good chorizo or jamon iberico de bellotas).  The bacon wrapped dates were a very nicely done rendition of this Spanish classic.  The olives two ways (a la Feran Adria) are always a delight, especially the molecular liquid olives, and this version featured a black olive, very different from the green olive versions we have had before.  The high point of the entire meal may have been the veal cheeks, slowly braised until they were fall-apart tender, and served with some creamy mashed potatoes and a couple of lovely home-made potato chips.  The gambas al ajillo was the only dish we didn't enjoy - too much tomatoes (we prefer just garlic and oil).  The wine list is outstanding, and we had a couple of excellent Spanish reds with our dinner.

The tapas at Jaleo were culinary creations.  We tried the bacon wrapped figs, the shrimp, the ham, the bread, something else I cant remember, but they were all great.  My friend ordered everything for us because I was new to tapas. She's been to Spain - I didn't even know tapas originated from there - and she said that Jaleo served authentic tapas. Makes me want to go to Spain.  We also ordered sangria which was like fruit punch - I wanted bottomless refills. 

I often find that the best food is often not listed in the menu, and such was the case when we were given a complimentary special dish from the chef.  It was this mushroom/mashed potato dish that is now on my list for one of the best things I ever ate.  

The best is the scent of the food diffusing into the air from the grill and cooking station in the dining area.  We wanted to sample everything cooking on there, but I wouldn't have been able to eat out for the next two weeks had we done that. Jaleo is pricey, but everything was well worth the price.

The tapas were a fantastic option and offered lots of choices.  Here are two of my favorites:
                Endibias - this dish was full of flavor, light, and refreshing.  List 
                of simple ingredients put together for some amazing flavors.

                Berenjenas con meil - this was pure sweet and salty combined.  
                The eggplant was thinly sliced so it came out like a chip with 
                the batter making it lightly salty.  They then drizzle honey over 
                the dish to give it some sweetness.  The balance was amazing.

Some of the other items we tasted that were also very good: pan de cristal con tomate (like bruchetta, but more like tomato spread), shrimp paella, vieiras con piniones, and calamares romana (they were out of the ink alioli so we had garlic alioli instead).

We did not opt for a cocktail so can't review that area, but the service 
perfect.  We received our food at different times (as expected) but was still paced out where we didn't have too much food on the table all at one time.

We started with a carafe of their featured cocktail - Sangria, of course!  The sangria had a nice blend of fresh fruits and it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. I don't particularly like sweet sangria so this was very easy to drink.

For food we started with a Manchego Cheese Bocadillo.  It reminded me of the baguette sandwiches in Paris.  The flauta bread wasn't too tough or crunchy which was great but this was my least favorite item of the evening.  We also ordered Patatas Bravas and it was 5 stars all the way!  The potatoes were crisp yet soft.  The spicy tomato sauce and alioli complemented the potatoes nicely.  Next came the Gambas al Ajillo which was basically shrimp sautéed in garlic. Great tapas dish!  We were still hungry so we decided to order 2 more dishes.  After perusing the large menu we went with Carne Asada and Chistorra Envuelta en Patata Frita.  Sounds fancy but it's chorizo wrapped in crispy potato.  These final 2 dishes were amongst our favorite!  I also adored the presentation of the wrapped chorizo. (see pics)  Our top pick of the evening was the Carne Asada which arrived last.  Our server didn't ask how we wanted it prepared but it came out perfectly to our liking - medium to medium rare.  The skirt steak was extremely flavorful and juicy.

As our dinner begins to wind down everyone felt well-fed and satisfied. 

The restaurant, the service, and their tapas was really good! The servers were all attentive and knowledgeable about every kind of tapas being served.  The only snag, however, I will note is their Paella, which was supposed to be the centerpiece of our meal.  This fell short in the very essence of Spanish recipe, it lacked the paella taste.  I think saffron might be helpful in enhancing the taste and bringing the true character of this paella dish.  Their take on this dish is on the bland side and perhaps the rice is not the Bomba paella rice which is more suited to paella dishes.

  1 star for trying to scale and find this spot in the clusterfuck of the Cosmo in HIGH heels!!!!!

 So I've been wanting to come to a Jose andres establishment for a long ass time! We made last minute rsvps and they told us the place was booked by one party and if it was ok to dine in the ""lounge"" area. Were like sure  no problem.  So we get to the Cosmo and this whole fuggin place is CF! The valet area sucks because the signage confuses the ish out of you. Anywho there was a concert going on and this meant more of a crowd than usual, im assuming. Finally we found the place. One thing im not feeling about these hotel eateries, is the feeling of being in some high end food court. All these places next to eachother and you can people watch the hell of whats going on. Its like a mall for real.

  So tip toe over to the hostess desk and they tell us to wait a little and the wait was a little to much for me but the hostess was soooooooooo nice. I must say the staff here are top notch! When we were seated at first I was not feeling this area with straw type chairs and large wooden communal table. It was so uncomfortable but it was what it was. My inner prayers were answered because one of the lovely hostesses told me about the rich folks that booked the whole damn place were leaving YAY! She walked us to our new table and walking there she said we were nice people, im thinking no you guys are!!!! They were so nice and sweet. The best hostesses I've ever encountered!

 So now were in those comfy booths. Im sippin on an adult shirley temple and pic a rum and coke with an ice ball. We start scaling the menu and some of the things I wanted the PIC didn't , like the Bikini De Jamón Ibérico, Queso Manchego Y Trufas , he basically called that a ham sandwich and why should we get that LOL. Ok find we didn't get it. So we started with the goat cheese stuffed peppers.  Those were so BOMB but I wish they served 4 of those crack peppas instead of two. Grrrrrrr.  Next dish was the veal cheek with these CRACK mashed potatoes. The potatoes were like silk! Not one lump. Just velvet.  Ordered the garlic shrimp and those were tasty but didn't look like the pics I've seen of this dish but who cares this was good. Next dish was this sausage mushroom stew type dish and that was tasty as well. Very good sausage dish and I love mushrooms!!!!!  One dish that was a lil iffy was the fried chicken wings with this black ink moussey thing brushed around the inside of the dish. That ink stuff was salty blah!  The fried chicken was good but not black peeps good hehe.  One downer is not being able to order the paella of your choice for a small party. You can order what they're making that moment which sucked because I wanted the lobster paella!!!! Not the chicken rabbit one!  Next time I'll show up with a party of 5 and Ill get that damn lobster paella!!!!!!! 

  We ended the night with the flan. The BEST flan I've ever had NOM NOM NOM NOMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!! I don't want to share that next time :D Damned good and went well with my dessert wine!

ordered a few dishes
started with the cheese plate selection....bad
the one that sticks out was a goat cheese brie???? positively awful, kind of what I would imagine a urinal cake tasting like....had to spit out in napkin...that bad

went on to apple and fennel salad, again bad choice
not sure how you screw up this one, maybe a bit heavy handed with Sherry/vinegar?
in any case, sent this back as well

third, tried the cauliflower, which was cooked ok, but the dusting of paprika kind of killed the taste for us

fourth came the lamb, probably the only edible dish of the night, cooked well, but a bit heavy handed with the salt.....edible at least

fifth, the paella with various vegetables, which they told us into our meal was not available (went bad?)
offered us the remaining available one, chicken and rabbit, but by that time we were pretty much done with this place, and why take the second best of only two choices of paella available that night?

I can say that the service was decent, and that even though we did not have a good meal....or any meal at all, the manager was extremely attentative. It was refreshing that he came to our table after the first two dishes were taken away and he noticed we had not touched much of either. I really hate to give the place such a low rating based on his concerns. Not too many places would show such concern, and especially on the strip, most would probably have just let us suffer.

The lunch menu offers a $26 prix fixe menu of salad, gazpacho and a choice of paella of the day or sandwich(es) of the day; there is also a fantastic a la carte selection of cured meats and other small dishes; and of course, no tapas meal is complete without a pitcher of sangria (which quickly escalated our lunch to well over $100 for two).

The paella that day was a chicken and mushroom, which at first I was skeptical of. My heart is very loyal to seafood paella, but I gave this a shot and it was outstanding. The chicken (all dark meat) was tender and juicy, the rice was cooked to perfection and with rich flavors, and the whole thing was served with a garlic aoili that was spread across half the plate. Yummmm.

For the sandwich option, there were three to choose from. We opted for the chorizo/tomato sandwich and it, too, was a winner. Light, crispy and flavorful, served with Jose Andres' own pink himalayan salt potato chips. 

From the a la carte menu, we were tempted to order a few dishes, but knew our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. There was plenty of food already for the two of us, but we had to try a little something extra.

We went with the endives and oh. my. goodness.

The endives/goat cheese/orange/almonds dish might've been the single most refreshing combination of flavors I've tasted all year. I could've had 10 orders of that and called it a day.

For dessert, we had the flan. I prefer a simple, traditional flan, but still ate every bite of this creative take on it. It was served with orange slices, a sorbet and a whipped creamy something. No complaints here!

I love when a meal - unplanned and unresearched - delights and surprises. Jaleo hit the spot.",_Ve-CCUdZuUz0KPEqIfqvg,0,0,5,GEI88UfRpUk7_OVmMV7WWA

 Service 4 stars 
They offer you an iPad with a wine list to review, but it takes an offionado to know how to search the app. Wine is pricey, and though I was willing, the other couple was not willing to share a bottle over $75. Slim pickins at this point. Still they helped us find a bottle, even after my sending a few bottles back (unopened) because of the incorrectly listed vintages. (yes, I am that person.) The sommelier was kind, understanding, and helpful.

This was the first dinner spot on my most recent Vegas trip. We were staying near the Cosmo and I wanted to eat in the area so we could easily get back to our hotel and pregame. Tapas sounded good to me so I went ahead and made a reservation for 4 a couple weeks in advance for Saturday evening.

Fast forward to that night. The restaurant was easy to find as it was on the 3rd floor of the Cosmo with most of the other restaurants. It was pretty empty when we arrived for our 6:15 reservation, so my guess is we didn't really need a reservation, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.

None of us were too hungry since we had snacking throughout the afternoon, so we ordered a paella and a couple small plates (* marks my favorites):

Pan con tomate ($12.50) - I enjoyed the crispiness of the bread but thought the tomatoes could have been more flavorful

Paella ($35) - the way their paella works is they are always cooking 1-2 paellas in the kitchen. Once it's ready a bell will ring and you can ask your server for a serving. If you don't like the paella toppings, you have to wait for the next paella to finish cooking. I enjoyed our paella which had sausage and chicken, but the portion was very small for how much the dish cost. Also I wish they had given us more rice as there was a disproportionate amount of meat to rice

* Tortilla patatas ($12.50) - the Spanish omelette with potatoes was delicious. I appreciated that our server confirmed with us to make sure we were okay with a slightly runnier inside. We were, and I loved how soft and fluffy the omelette was!

* Gambas al ajillo ($18) - another tapas classic and one that was recommended by our server. the shrimp had a great garlic flavor

Patatas bravas ($11.50) - my least favorite dish from the night as the potatoes were topped with an aioli sauce. I don't like mayo in anything so I had to scrape the aioli off before eating

* Pollo croquetas ($12.50) - another favorite from the whole table. The chicken croquettes were so soft and creamy inside. Loved the presentation as it was served in a shoe. Never seen that before!

* Costillas romero ($25.50) - the lamb was grilled to a perfect medium rare...yum!

I already had leftovers in my bag from China Poblano and just needed another cocktail and snack before leaving.  No regrets with my plan but I was disappointed in my sangria.  This happened to us another time in DC.  Don't know if the drink recipe has changed or if a particular aspect was off.  It tasted a little bitter and not sweet the way I remembered it.  Something had a weird kick to it.  The dried orange rind definitely was not helping so I picked that out.  Oh well, was still a source of alcohol so I didn't waste a drop but it was just off.  The calamari was yummy but I should have asked for the regular aioli.  They served it with a squid ink aioli and while good, just was not the same.  Sometimes change is good, but why mess with a good thing.  We were supposed to go to Jaleo when I returned home but I ended up getting sick and we have not yet rescheduled.

Me and another girlfriend went to jaleo for dinner and all I can say is the service that we got from some guy named Brian was horrible. We understand that being in the cosmo it was busy but he did not once ask us how the food was, and was too busy with the couple next to us. He was too occupied with getting more money out of that couple than giving us decent service. Our food came out relatively fast but everything that came out was bland. By the end of our meal we were craving some flavor, hoping to get dessert.. It took us 20 minutes to get our check and not only that he didn't even offer us a dessert menu.

We had gotten the shrimp al ajillo, the chicken fritters, the chorizo wrapped in potato, and the tuna salad. All were bland and the portions were minuscule to almost non existent. I know tapas are meant to be small, but jaleo took it to the next level.

I was furious when I left, the food was sub-par and the service was ridiculous. I would have complained to the manager if I wasn't in such a hurry to get out of the godforsaken place. I will never go back to jaleo, I'd rather go to firelfy where the service is decent to amazing and the food is always out of this world.

The wife and I have had reservations at The Bazaar, E, and Jaleo before and each time we had to cancel for various reasons.  We finally made it to Jaleo this time in Vegas.  We were seated almost right away and the had a pretty casual atmosphere for such a highly touted restaurant.

We started out with the Pan Con Tomate which is pretty much a bruschetta.  I was like its just tomato and bread but I gotta admit that it was pretty tasty.  So far so good.  

Next came the world famous Jamon Iberico Ham.  Nicely cured ham, similar to a proscuitto, but for $18 we got 3 small slices.  Good stuff but not worth the price in my opinion.  

Got a good review of the paella from a buddy so we had to try.  The paella for the night was the Iberico Short Rib Paella.  The wife thought it a bit salty, but it was very good.  Wild mushrooms gave it a great earthy flavor and the Iberico Short Ribs were awesome.  

Then the bacon wrapped dates fried in a batter.  I guess it was okay but its not something I would order again.  Nothing special here.

The Calamares Tinta was pretty much the best squid I've ever had.  Squid usually ends up overcooked and tough or chewy.  This squid was sooooo tender.  More important, the squid flavor was not masked by some overwhelming sauce.  It comes with squid ink as the sauce and is just a great squid dish.

Last, but not least, the Carilleras which is veal cheeks.  Anyone who has had veal cheeks knows that they are just so tender, melt in your mouth good.  This was no different.  Served on creamy, fluffy, mashed potatoes.  

As an aside, the wife as very impressed by the Spanish Red Wine that she ordered.  It is called Montecastrill.  Nice and smooth, medium bodied, and that's about all I can say because I'm not a wine conissoeur.

In short, I was impressed by Jaleo.  It is quite expensive for the small portions of food that you get but although I wasn't stuffed by any stretch, there was enough food to satisfy me.",MJ0Wphhko2-LbJ0uZ5XyQA,2,1,4,ionlrKnbLuubFJDPVjzYww

My wife and I were very excited to try something different than the usual sushi or steak restaurants on the strip.  We love tapas and have some great options in Boston where we live.  We couldn't wait to try another take on Spanish tapas.

Located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan, Jaleo is very cutely decorated and lively.  Our server was pretty rushed the whole evening and was not very attentive.  

Unfortunately, the tapas are a real let-down.  We started with the lomo iberico (type of ham) and a selection of Spanish cheese.  Very small pieces and not served with bread.  We had to ask and pay for bread separately.  Who serves ham and cheese without bread.  In all the times we have had tapas, this had never happened.  Next we got the dates wrapped in bacon.  Incredibly salty.  Almost inedible.  The sauteed cauliflower was very good and the lone high point of the meal.  The mini pork burgers were pretty good but quite greasy.  The lamb skewer was so lemony it was hard to eat.  Finally the sauteed mushrooms were pretty good but a bit undercooked.  Like other reviewers have noted, the portions are small.  You could very well leave hungry like we did.  We ordered 7 tapas for 2 people!

We did not try dessert because nothing about the meal thus far had suggested the desserts were going to be any better.

Rossejat-My first time trying paella, I can't say that I was impressed because the pasta was stuck to the pan and we found ourselves scraping the pan to get something onto our plate.  Flavor was definitely there, you could taste the squid and shrimp throughout. 

Vieiras con slasa de romesco-OMG, this was my favorite!! This is not your itty bitty scallop.  It is two large scallops flavored in a romesco sauce.  2 pieces don't sound like a lot for $18...but go for it.  It almost gave the Barrymore hardrubs. 

Canelones tradicionales de cerdo de y pato con salsa bechamel-This was Pork and Foie gras canelones, cooked in cheese.  Okay they had me at Foie gras, I wanted to eat the whole thing to myself.  I was scraping everything off of that plate.

Also, I don't get the random use of sneaks as a serving piece for the croquetas (see other Yelpers' pics). It's not even a nice shoe, thing looked like it had been actually worn. Also, our first order came in a normal (mini) frying basket while the second came in the shoe.

What? Did the kitchen staff not have enough time to put on and break in a few more pairs of kicks, so they felt the need to conserve?",59QzQ3-dmOD1USV2hQpwkw,1,0,4,eyQG-ZLRf2SMxr4aFE0z1A

During my last trip to Vegas, I somehow managed to snag a reservation at e by Jose Andres the DAY BEFORE I wanted to dine there, but I just couldn't drop $250 on one meal (especially after all the gluttony  that occurred the evening before).  I figured Jaleo wouldn't disappoint.

The way this joint is set up is pretty unique.  It's inside the Cosmopolitan, and you take an escalator up to the umpteenth floor (or so it seems), and as you reach the top of the escalator (after following a bunch of signs that direct you toward the restaurants in the hotel/casino), the restaurant is right in front of you.  There are no walls.  It's just restaurant, in the middle of the casino.  We were seated promptly (as we had a reservation).  The service was excellent.  The food was good, but like I said, it was no Bazaar.  

Loved the iPad cocktail menu.  Enjoyed the carne asada and shrimp dishes.  The flan was pretty awesome as well (the flavor had a citrusy undertone, which was unique).",RmL44jsoOq6Dzcun9jhUvA,1,0,4,Gov8iSj2PdRYAWdewZUUbw

We got their Paella, which was the most recognizable word out of all the Spanish words on the menu.   They should have a English friendly menu since that is the dominant language in the States!

Their Paella tasted great after a pool party in the same place - Marquee!  We ordered up their freshly sliced up sausage.  It was fatty good!  They even showcase the whole, salted meat at the kitchen side as a display!

You can tell that this place is all about using fresh, whole ingredients and serving it in tapa, small sized!  Bring a good number of people so you can taste the variety that they offer!

Next up, was their tossed up spinach salad and then grilled steak on top of cooked bell peppers.  So-so for both.  We got their garlic chicken and that was alright too.  Pretty pricey, but you get what your pay for! 

Their signature dish that stood out the most - Gambas Al Ajillo!  Thank goodness we asked the waitress what to recommend!  Their cooked shrimp with the bomb, red sauce was simply amazing!  Don't waste a drip of that sauce!  Pour it over the Paella and it is surely a delight!

We had the following:
 an unaccompanied plate of sliced manchego
A plate of crostini with a tomato spread that was mealy and had a distinct  taste of over ripe tomatoes
A gazpacho with sliced meat that was excellent and definitely one of the best things we were served overall
An endive with goat cheese, orange slices and toasted almonds that was tasty but rather plain
A paella with very dry over cooked chicken and rabbit. Even the vegetables were overcooked and the rice was bland and tasteless
They paired the paella with red peppers filled with MORE goat cheese. At this point we couldn't take anymore goat cheese.
A salad with a crostini, more cheese, capers, garlic dressing and a tomato paste at the bottom. My husband liked this one 
Finally, the best part of the meal was the carne asada. There were two undercooked slices that were purple in the middle, but the sauce and the flavors were fantastic 
The dessert was a chocolate mousse and ice cream dish with a salted sugar topping. Absolutely hands down best thing we had besides the carne asada... Would come back only for this!

You order steak and someone's a vegetarian. You order soup and then feel guilty for eating the entire bowl yourself. 

I'm selfish. I want my food to myself.

But Jaleo changed all of that. 

Six of us ordered nearly everything off the menu and six of us wholeheartedly agreed not one thing was under par - instead, every.single.morsel satiated every.single.taste bud. A restaurant has never been so consistently delicious - so on top of their flavors and game that despite our full bellies, when two extra dishes arrived from the chef, we greedily scooped them up. (Chicken and rabbit paella and the chef's new spin on an old standby - garlic shrimp.) 

We tried the selection of cheeses and my comrades the three Spanish-cured meats. We shared spoons in the garlic and grape soup (a favorite amongst the table), we slurped oysters, severed mussels, crunched apple/fennel/walnut salad, forked fried eggplant and... more? Yes, much more. The cod and honey empanada that melted once breaking its delicate shell, the homemade potato chips drizzled with spicy tomato sauce, the out-of-this-world garlic shrimp mentioned above and skirt steak (that I can't comment on because I didn't have any). 

We devoured every last bit - not a crumb escaped our table. And when it came time for dessert? We split our waitress' two favorites with coffees and espressos.

4640674,2015-12-09,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Since I have to give 1 star, ill give it to the customer service/waitress. 
This was probably one of the worst meals (in terms of quality and price) that I have had in many, many years. This restaurant has been on my foodie list for almost 3 years since I first heard of the popular Chef Andres. I always want to eat at his restaurants because i know it will be good. His restaurant in LA is amazing! Because of the hype I give this place in my mind, i was extremely disappointed and felt really cheated in a food experience. 

My bf and i got the ""Jaleo Experience"" tasting menu. It was the worst representation of a tasting experience I've ever had. I am not trying to be mean, but i really was super sad and disappointed at the end of the meal..... PLUS it was EXPENSIVE. 2 tasting meals plus a beer, ($16 Chimay), a glass of wine, 2 espressos, and a lemonade was $220. I don't mind paying that much if the menu was amazing, so i was extremely upset. A tasting menu should be special plates off the menu that the chef is happy to serve to customers not plates that I felt like I could have made myself at home.

10 course meal included some of the following:

The beginning courses:
1 course was a plate with 4 pieces of manchego cheese: i swear i've had better cheese 
1 course of tomato spread toast: I could have made this at home
1 course of ham with some ""crouton"" bread things 
1 course of gazpacho soup: we both only had a few bites of it because it was too salty and not tasty at all.

There were a few decent courses such as 2 small pieces of lamb chops (a few bites tops) and the paella. The last savory dish was cold eggplant and red peppers. It was tasty but we were expecting something of more substance, like a meat dish to end the savory part of the meal. Maybe the paella could have been the last dish? The desert was okay but it couldn't make up for the rest of the menu. 

For a $220 menu, we just expected much more..

Andrés, you have a fine imagination and straight up BALLS, and with that... some things, just didn't work.

- Costillas de cordero con salsa romero y alioli de miel (OR) Grilled Merino lamb with rosemary sauce and honey alioli
- 'Pan con chocolate' (OR) Chocolate custard with caramelized bread, olive oil and brioche ice cream

The squid and beans were the perfect compliment to each other & the sauce highlighted the notes of seafood and gave a little more umph to the beans.

Dined at Jaleo this past Friday. Service could stand some improvement. Our server didn't introduce himself, made no recommendations, and had a little attitude. 

My friends and I couldn't wait to try several different paella. Everything sounded so good. Sadly, after giving our order to the waiter he told us that you can't actually choose from the entire menu, that they only cook 2 choices of the paella for the evening. This is where an introduction and rundown of how this works would've been helpful. Then we order the eggplant and he tells us they're out of eggplant. I let him know we'd need a couple more minutes to look over the menu and asked if there was anything they were out of or anything else we wouldn't be able to order that night. He rolled his eyes and said no. Uncalled for given it was an honest question based on the experience so far.

For positives, the food came out relatively quickly. We put in an order of the pork sausage and mushroom paella and it came out 5-10 min later/ The sautéed shrimp with garlic dish was probably the best dish of the night.

Walked into The Cosmopolitan, knowing there where several restaurants to choose from. Tried one place but they had a 2 hour wait. Then, came upon Jaleo. 
First of all, the place has an awesome vibe... it drew us in. And the fact, we could be seated right away. But that should also been a red flag. Sadly, I did not check YELP first because we were going to ""wing it"". MISTAKE!!!! 
The staff was great from start to finish... on top of everything! 
Usually, we like tapas size dining... but these prices are ridiculous for what you get... and I'm talking about the quality as well as the quantity. Nothing really stood out... just average ... just okay. And at these prices, the food should WOW! 
Not to mention the cocktails... instead of ordering the high-end menu cocktails, we ordered 3 simple margaritas... $60.00. for 3 Very small glasses, filled with ice and little to no liquor, what so ever. 
Total bill for 4 people... $300 and we were still hungry. 
LISTEN... I am an Elite yelper... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! Trust the Yelp reviews... don't except anything less than a 4 star. Clearly, this place is a tourist rip off. And being we live here now, we should know better. Thank you for reminding us locals, to stay away from places like Jaleo. So sad the food doesn't live up to the cool vibe and awesome staff.

4673944,2017-11-27,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"My fiancé and I have decided to review restaurants based on five criteria: Food, Alcohol, Cleanliness & Ambiance, Service and Value/Price.

Our last stop on this Vegas trip was Jaleo in Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino.  This is another spot we try to visit regularly when we are in town. The ratings have dropped off in recent years but the quality of the food and drinks is still as good as when they started. 

FOOD

We started with Jamon Iberico de Bellota Fermin.  This is a hand carved dry aged ham that is absolutely amazing.  This was the first time we tried it and it was fatty in the right spots and melted in our mouths. We also got a side of the pan de crystal con tomate.  Pieces of bread that are lightly seasoned with oil and tomato sauce.  A perfect side to the ham. 

Our second dish was the Bacon Wrapped Dates.  We get this every time we are here.  This item came off the menu at one point but is back on and there is no place that makes it better than Jaleo. 

The third dish was the Patatas Bravas.  As I said when I did my last review this is a dish you have to get no matter what Spanish Tapas place you dine.  It is amazing here. All the potatoes are cooked evenly and have a nice spiciness to them. 

Finally we had the Paella Mixta for the first time.  This was the first time we had Paella here and like my Fiancé said it is exactly what she thinks Paella should taste like.  The rice was not seasoned because the flavor of the ribs, sausage and chicken perfectly blended together to bring out the flavor of the dish. The rice was perfectly cooked. 

Desert is the reason we come back here time and time again. We got the Flan. It is the best flan we have had at any restaurant.  I have been challenged by a number of restaurants that theirs are better but it is still to happen where someone has a better flan.  There are a number of additions to the plate like fresh fruit, whipped cream and sorbet.  However, I always eat everything before I get to the Flan itself. It has to be the last thing I eat here. 

The food as always was wonderful and earned its one star. 

ALCOHOL

We started with straight bourbon which was good but not great. They have a limited selection outside of Gin like most tapas restaurants. 

For my second drink I had the Citric Gin & Tonic.  If there is one thing this place knows how to make it is Gin & Tonics if different flavors.  Their Tonic was fever tree which we consider a little sweet but the flavor was great. 

Overall the alcohol deserves 3/4 of a star.  Although they have a full bar it is definitely a limited selection outside of their main drinks.

CLEANLINESS & AMBIANCE 

The Ambiance is fantasticly energetic, young and hip.  The restaurant is open to the hallways of Cosmo which provides a great feel for the restaurant. 

The restaurant does not have bathrooms so you need to use the Cosmo ones around the corner by the elevators. 

Overall the cleanliness & ambiance gets a star. 

SERVICE

The service is normally great but tonight it was definitely lacking.  The hostess was low energy and the wait staff initially took a very long time to come get drink and dinner orders. The wait staff that brought the food were great and at the end of the evening everyone that worked at the restaurant said thank you as we were walking out.  So the second half was definitely much better than the first. However, that first impression and getting the guests situated is key and tonight it wasn't there.

Overall the service deserves 1/2 of a star. First impressions are really key for the experience. 

VALUE/PRICE

The overall value is decent. The bourbons were fairly priced at $12 each but the gin cocktail was a little pricey at $20.  The food is reasonably priced although the cured ham was definitely expensive. It was worth it but not worth getting again on another visit.  Again I have to allow for the fact this is Las Vegas and we are in the Cosmo. The meal came out to $165 for three drinks, three small plates, a Paella and a desert. 

Overall the value/price receives 3/4 of a star.

In conclusion Jaleo is one of our favorite spots in Vegas and we will continue to visit.  This visit however was only worth 4 stars total. Not sure if this is a one time issue or a permanent change.  We will just have to come back and find out.",1oh9rKh3FBtpoV2We6JRNg,0,0,4,smPHhp8YoFRqrMVi-B_jIw

We were a little wary due to some negative reviews, but we went ahead and gave it a shot. Mostly because they have a foosball dining table. Let me just say...I don't know what all the negative yelpers were talking about! There is no way this is the same restaurant you guys went to.

The service was great. Our server really was super helpful in our decision making. Especially the important stuff like, should we get the small or large sangria? Which, by the way, was pretty tasty. I'm not a sangria snob, I don't care if they're ""supposed"" to make it a certain way. It was good, end of story.

We each started off with salads. Manzanas con hinojo y queso Manchego for me. Borderline amazing. The only thing that kept me from being in love with it was that it either had not enough cheese, or too much salad. I'm going with not enough cheese. He had a brussels sprout salad. I was not interested in that at all. I hear it was lovely.

I moved on to the Carne Asada, and he went with Chistorra envuelta en patata frita, which is basically glorified pigs in a blanket. But really yummy. My carne asada was absolutely delicious. The only negative is that it was a little less done than I typically like my meat. I had to put the roasted peppers on top so that I wouldn't have to see the bloodiness as I was eating it. I don't eat piglets, so I can't speak for his dish. But I did break off a piece of potato. It was like eating the best Lays chip ever made.

Time for dessert! Always my favorite part. We shared a flan. It doesn't sound like much, I know. But it was topped with a mandarin orange sorbet and some kind of cream which I can only assume was infused with crack. And I want more.

But the food was outstanding. My Carne was especially good -very tender and well flavored with the red pepper. The wife loved her Salmon as well. But, we wern't exactly full. I was trying to talk her into getting something else off the menu and our server overheard... the next thing we knew the manager came over with a plate of their delicious specialty Piaya for us to share. It was so nice and unexpected (for Vegas) we were blown away. It was non-gratis and perfectly filled that small plate void. They get 5 stars from me just for caring so much about their customers that they offered something like that.

Jaleo is located on the 3rd floor of the swanky Cosmopolitan Hotel.  The decor was very modern and sleek.  It's a nice place to dress up with your girlfriends and eat out.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind shelling out top dollars for food but only if the food is worth it.  I understand that tapas are small plates but that doesn't mean you should provide us with toothpick size plates and charge us an arm and a leg.  We ordered the carne asada (grilled skirt steak) it was like 2 oz of meat and the charge was $18.00.  Um, maybe if it was waygu beef topped with some uni, okay that would be reasonable.  But a cheap cut like skirt steak for that small portion size is not worth the cost of $18.00.  We ordered a total of five dishes to share amongst three girls and we were still left hungry.  At that point, with our bill already up to $100 there was no point in ordering anything else as it would again just be sample size.  

I would have loved a place like this; however, the high cost of the meal left me wanting more.  Literally...",0CbpKSlEnGUEfOMwj0Pwtg,1,0,3,oRmjPsorv4v35CvVyIV4wQ

I wanted to write this review when it was fresh in our thoughts and hearts. It was truly an amazing experience... and we will return.

The eat lunch like a Spaniard experience at $25 per person from opening till 4 PM is amazing!

But it gets better...

At 3 PM they start a social hour/happy hour menu that overlaps the Lunch menu for 1 hour that offers a special 3 glass Flight of wine sherry tasting that is amazing!

While living in Southern California, we only get out to Las Vegas a few times a year and had never been here.

I ordered the...
Ensalada verde con anchoas...
Mixed greens with pine nuts, fried capers, anchovies, Idiazabal cheese with romesco and garlic dressing.
It was fantastic! Some reviews stated it was too salty but I disagree to the extent... that my wife who does not care for anchovies... ate most of it before I even got to it!

My wife ordered the...
Endibias con queso de cabra y naranjas...
Endives, goat cheese, oranges and almonds.
Incredible! Some reviews said too citrus, it wasn't, it was amazing!

Then it was on to round number 2 of Tapas...
We both ordered the...
Vieira con mojo rojo y polvo almendras...
Seared scallop with mojo rojo and almonds.
Incredible! They melted in your mouth...like butter...amazing pine nuts and sauce was so good I think it had raisins in it!

And then round #3...
We both ordered the...
Gambas al ajillo...
The very, very famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic...

OMG, we now know why everyone orders these and raves endlessly about them... and we agree!

We also added a Tapas size order of Paella for only $7 each and it was very delicious!
We were very lucky on this Sunday because they had made the...
Paella Valenciana 'Rafael Vidal'
A true classic of chicken, rabbit and green beans... my personal favorite!

The flavors and the Soccarat, that crusty crunchy rice that forms on the bottom of the Paella pan was excellent! So much, that we both agree, we will return and order the Paella by itself... along with the Vino of course!

So on to the vino...
The Wine and Sherry tasting was really good...
I know I may sound repetitive but everything was really fantastic!

My wife had the 
White Wine Flight...
Kentia Albarino; 
Granbazan Albarino; 
and the Hacienda de Arinzano Chardonnay
... very crisp and acidic except for the Chardonnay but all in all would definitely order again.

While I... very much enjoyed the The Sherry!
Sherry Flight...
Manzanilla Papirusa;
Los Arcos Amontillado;
and the  Don Nuno Oloroso 

... I must add it was a very nice Sunday afternoon and while they were busy, the entire staff was very warm and cordial, from the hostess Stephanie, to our very attentive waiter Tony, and the manager on duty...whom I believe was Michael.

I came here with high expectations due to the reviews.  We came in with a party of 7 people that night and left with fairly mixed reviews.

We were highly suggested to order the chef's experience, $55/$85 which included 10 tapas.  What we did not realize was that they brought out all the tapas on three plates for 7 people.  This meant we did not really even know if they brought out the correct portions or amount of food since they threw it all onto three plates.  For some dishes we only got 2 plates instead of three as they forgot to bring it out.

Some people didn't get some of the extra tapas they ordered and it was a nightmare as they paid for food they did not consume.  The waiters/waitresses made this entire experience very unorganized and unprofessional.  

The food did come out in a decently timely manner which was good.  In general I would say avoid the chef's experience.  Although it's 'ten' items, a lot of them are just filler items.  Many of the items tasted overly cooked or almost fermented.  It's really unfortunate as I enjoy Chef José Andrés' other establishments.

For drink- I had the Gin & Tonic and I was a little worried because I generally hate Gin & Tonic, but Jale's  G&T is so tasty. HIGHLY recommend in trying this drinks if you can!

I only took photos of a few of their dishes. However, the tomato bread, fried egg, and shrimp paella were so delicious!! The dishes look quite simple but don't underestimate it! The flavor was powerful and the texture of the paella and shrimp was cooked so perfect.

Headed here with my brother Edward and his girlfriend, Jackie for his birthday. I've never had tapas before really and was really looking forward to trying it.  My brother started by ordering a Perron with Cava. The cocktail menu (on the iPad) even had a short video of how to drink from it. It was a lot of fun, though we ended up wearing a bit of it.  

The food was great. We ordered a lot justifying it because they had small plates and because we were treating ourselves. (Also, I paid but my brother paid for Carnevino the next day, so I knew he'd be spending more there). We ordered both of the paellas available that day - I was super excited because I don't eat seafood and all the paellas I've seen elsewhere include shellfish (yuck). Both were perfect and crispy and complex. The pork sliders were melt-in-your-mouth delicious - they literally melted in your mouth. And the terojas dessert french toast was beyond compare. Probably the best dessert I ever eaten and the best dish of the trip. The custardy bread was so soft and the crust was so awesomely caramelized that it almost was like a creme brulee but so much better.  The other highlights of the meal included: chicken croquettes, the charcuterie, the pork pressed sandwiches, the sorgbet.  The tortilla and pan con tomate were good, but not really more than the sum of their parts - I would not order them again.

4786819,2011-02-15,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Jaleo is the third place I have been to at the Cosmopolitan. I had been wanting to try it from the day it opened; the Iberico ham was calling my name!

My wife and I made our reservation through Opentable for Android and got right in at 630pm the day before Valentines. I immediately noticed that this was a ""hipster"" type of place with a modern feel; Wood floors and white tables without table clothes. The feeling was comfortable while retaining its coolness. If you are expecting a romantic, quiet, and private atmosphere this is not the spot for you.

The Menu is expansive and playful. Chef Andres' uses a nice sense of humor on his menu to get you to eat and drink! Most of the dishes are tapas style and this encourages sharing of course! We started with the Iberico Jamon bellota from the famous black footed pig! it's a little pricey at 22$ for five shaved slices, but go for it; you can't get this stuff in a supermarket.

Next, we ordered the Soupa De Ajo which is garlic soup with a 63degree Egg. They served it tableside and it was Soo garlicky and delicious! The croutons melted right in front of you as the hot soup hit them. The soup was soul satisfying!

Following the soup we had Dungeoness crab stuffed peppers. Tasty but not monumental. Then we got the foie gras and pork cannoli's in bechamel! Wow! Yummy! Topped with shaved black truffles this dish satisfies the biggest foodie! Rich and creamy and savory; everything you could want in a dish. We didn't think that our next dish of Veal cheeks could stand up, but the cheeks were out of this world! Luscious and tender you could eat them with your fork and served on the most wonderful olive oil potatoes you could ever want. The pork and the potatoes together were heavenly. This was our absolute favorite dish!

The night we were there the paella was made with Lobster. We went for it! As I said before, the chef is cute with his menu. So to me this seemed to be his signature dish. When you walk in to the restaurant you see a huge grill surrounded by UFO sized Paella pans.  I figured if you go to Jaleo then you have to try this dish. They tell you the paella takes about 45 minutes so it actually came out after our veal cheeks. Perfectly cooked lobster rested on top of the rice. This dish was all about the rice and the seafood with a yummy garlic aioli on the side. My only problem with the dish was that the Lobster was still in the shell. I have a problem with a place that serves lobster in the shell. I don't want to wrestle the damn thing to eat it. but it was a lovely dish and very good.

Our two desserts were well done and tasty but the dessert menu is short; only about 8 choices. Save some room and share like the rest of menu!

The service was very attentive! Our water glasses were never empty and there was never a pile up of empty plates. The table remained clean and cleared throughout the dinner. Our waitress, Michelle, was helpful in selecting a nice Rose Cava that went very well with all the food. Even on a busy night they were really on top of the service.

4791386,2014-10-13,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Jaleo was one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to when considering the quality of the food and the price point.

It's not that the concept isn't intriguing. Tapas restaurants are an excellent concept which can provide fantastic flavor combinations and lots of options for customers to choose from. When you're traveling with a group, it's great to order several tapas and share.

I also want to be clear that I think the staff at Jaleo was top notch, friendly, and timely. I appreciated that on a busy Thursday night.

The problem with this place wasn't the concept or the service. The problem was the food.

I went with a group of six people and personally tried 5 different tapas during the course of the meal. We would have ordered several more if the food wasn't so underwhelming.

What I tried:

The ""pan de cristal con tomate fresco,"" which was $12, was some dry, stale bread with what tasted like a can of tomato sauce dumped on top. It was sloppy. It was flavorless.

The ""croquetas de pollo"" ($12), were served in a shoe. Literally, the food was in a paper cone that was place inside of an old shoe. Why would anyone think that's clever or appetizing? The croquetas were decently cooked, but still lacked flavor.

The ""gambas al ajillo"" ($16), were flavorful, but the portion size was minuscule for a $16 dish.

The ""remolacha con cítricos"" ($12) was drenched in the dressing, though it wasn't bad otherwise.

The worst of it all, in my view:

""José's patatas bravas"" ($6) was seriously a individually-sized bag of potato chips (you know, the one they'd sell for $0.50 in a vending machine) covered in mayo and sriracha. They even took up a third of the plate with the empty bag cut in half, as if that was something that would impress a diner. The chips weren't great (most of them were crushed), and the sauce combination was fine, but this was an embarrassing thing to have on the menu in my view. An absolute shame.

The consensus about this place from those of us who had dinner that night and tried tapas other than those I listed was that it was the worst meal we had in our weeklong stay in LV.

I'm by no means someone who expects to have a five star meal every time I go out, and I understand the Vegas expense is always higher than it is other cities. I also understand that in a busy shift, some meals don't always turn out as well as they should. But the fact that all of the tapas we ordered had serious flaws is indicative of a systemic issue in the restaurant.

My disappointment in this meal compelled to share this experience. With all of the wonderful and delicious options in Vegas, don't waste your money going here.",pi8R-Q2Zp91WDddAjMLYEg,4,1,1,GInMnPT-2-pE0H792zjJzQ

Do not be fooled by the Jose Andres name and the website glitz; this is a overpriced, lackluster tapas restaurant in a town where your money will be far better spent at any number of places in walking distance to this disappointment. Wife and I were terribly disappointed. Far from the romantic, fancy, or elegant dining experience we expected. 

Décor - Do not come here expecting an elegant or fancy dining experience. Tables and chairs are cheap with visible wear and tear. Restaurant itself is placed in the middle of what can only be described as a strip mall of other restaurants. Deceivingly casual compared to how they market this restaurant online. 

Service - While our server was friendly, he lacked professionalism, tried way too hard to be our friends opposed to our waiter, and drew away from our dining experience with cheesy lines and his life story. What's more, we had to listen to him do the same shtick to the tables around us throughout our meal. 

Food - we did like the food. The boiled octopus, Ibarra plate, cured black-foot prosciutto, and suckling pig (only available Sundays) were absolutely delicious. The paella however was disappointing and over-salted. Portions were fine, but our biggest gripe was that everything is just far more expensive than it should be for the quality of food offered. 

Bottom line, this restaurant's biggest problem is that that the casual décor and mediocre experience do not justify the price point even with decent food.

We got the Bacon Wrapped Dates, the Potato Chips with white and red sauce, Chirizo Wrapped with Potato chips, White Asparagus, and the Conejo (Rabbit). 
To make this easy, I'll simply break it down:
Bacon Wrapped Dates: A typical order for us from Firefly, so we wanted to compare. The presentation was definitely not what we were expecting, but very fun to experience. They come served in a tennis shoe from a brand that we were told is the ""Adidas of Spain"". Aside from the off the wall plating, the Dates were amazing. The difference is, they deep fry the bacon wrapped dates so the whole bite is moist and flavorful with more of a hint of bacon and the richness of the date compared to most places where the bacon wins the flavor battle. A+
Potato Chips with Red and White sauce: A simple dish with lots to love. The chips seemed freshly made and the sauces had a good contrast to each other. Being so fresh, the chips had less crunch than you'd normally expect, but I saw it as a good thing. Not mushy, just less crunch and more smooth textures. B+
Choirzo Wrapped in Potato Chips: Simple, yet delightful. It is what it is, delicious Spanish chorizo, fresh potato chip, and a toothpick. Pick it up, bite, and enjoy. Simplicity at it's best, and tastiest. A
White Asparagus: This was served inside a sardine-can-like tin sprinkled with a bit of cheese. The fresh crunch of each bite, cut by the slight bitterness of the cheese made each tiny serving seem like so much more. A
Conejo (Rabbit): Something that's definitely not on everyone's top choices to try, but should. This was a leg and ribs serving with an apricot compote that was light and rich with enough sweetness to nicely balance the supreme flavors of the juicy Rabbit. If you've never tried Rabbit before, this is the one to try. It is not off putting at all, and will make you wish you could have it every day if you could! A+
To finish us off, we figured we'd indulge and have the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. What a work of art this dessert was. I would've paid for just one bite of it. The chocolate and hazelnut combination they use is an absolute marrige commencing on your pallet. It was so good, I'd go there to just order that! A+
I thank the Cosmopolitan for choosing such an outstanding Tapas joint. I can't wait to try more of the menu. Hopefully over time, Jaleo's gets a happy hour or local's night, but even until then, this will be my new place to enjoy Tapas with friends and family.",QIrJKF0cJ04Vasv-rxOQ3Q,5,3,4,WOIjrwHcIvj_myTnu6_iVA

The standout dishes were definitely the paella (which was vegetable, i can only imagine how amazing the seafood paella is!) the Melon con Jamon serrano (carved fresh!) and the sliders with Ibérico bacon.

The meal exceeded my expectations. I find sometimes when there is a special or pre-fixe menu the quality isn't as high, but this was definitely not the case. I have had tapas in Spain and this is the first restaurant in North America that the tapas has come to par with restaurants in Sevilla and Barcelona.

I have food allergies and our waiter was extremely attentive and separated my courses from the others in my group. He also suggested an amazing glass of wine to match the paella, and was extremely knowledgeable and more importantly nice.

Prices are a bit on the high side (our bill came to $270 for three including tip.) But the quality of food is totally worth it, I'll definitely be visiting again.",Jo33pCzxuJqsEske_uPHFw,1,1,5,RAGVS4t9pPOTDPhdQBLZrw
4842366,2011-01-23,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Having been to The Bazaar by Jose Andres and loved it, I was excited to try some of his more traditional fare.  Overall, I thought this meal was fun and an overall success.  We came here on a Sunday night without reservations but were seated right away as a table had just become available.  This is off to a good start!

We started with the Aceitunas ($12 for 4 anchovy stuffed green olives and 4 kalamata olive spheres made from sodium alginate).  I've had Jose's black olive spheres at the Bazaar and actually thought the kalamatas work much better.

Next, we had the Chistorra Envuelta ($8 for 6 skewers).  The spicy chorizo  was quite tasty and contrasted perfectly with the crunchiness of the potato chip wrapped around the  skewer.

The waitress highly recommended the Gambas al Ajillo ($10 for 6 shrimps) which the menu features as one of their most popular dishes.  Maybe it was high expectation from the waitress and the menu, but I thought the shrimp wasn't really anything special.  Sure it was perfectly cooked, but it just tasted like nicely cooked shrimp with garlic oil.

My favorite dish of the night was easily the Pinchon Estilo Alcantara which was squab topped with foie gras and shaved black truffle ($22).  All the flavors came together so well.. I would have ordered this plate just for myself.. who says sharing is caring?

The Rape a la Donostiarra ($10 for a large platter of thinly sliced monkfish) was pretty solid.  The waitress said it was a brave dish.. I've never had monkfish prepared this way before, but didn't think it was anything overly eccentric.

Finally, we had the Arroz a Banda con Bogavante ($28) which is their lobster paella.  I was really looking forward to this, since we were sitting right next to the paella station.  As a quick note, they only serve 2 paellas at any given night, and could take up to 30 minutes to prepare, so be aware that not all options are going to be available.  The paella was quite rich and tasty.. a tad over-seasoned, but that's ok.  Each dish is served with half a lobster tail and a claw, which was a nice touch.

We had our meal with a pitcher of red sangria, which I highly recommend.  You can never really go wrong with wine mixed with fruit.

Overall, Jaleo was pretty much what I expected from Jose Andres - tasty, modern Spanish cuisine.  I can't wait to come back to try everything else on the menu.  Definitely come in a group to maximize the selection.  I thought our party of 6 was perfect, since most of the dishes come in groups of 6.  Also, I actually thought the price was fairly reasonable for what we were getting.

4844471,2011-01-20,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Let me preface this by saying that Jaleo still has some kinks to work out, but it has 4 star potential.  If you're vegan, and don't feel like trekking to the Wynn, Jaleo has a ton of tasty vegan(izable) options for you.  I used to live in DC and go to the original Jaleo in my pregan days, so I was very excited to see Jose Andres open a restaurant here!

I went there solo and ate at the tapas bar, which is fun, because you get to watch them make all kinds of little dishes and you can ask the sous chefs about what they're making etc.  Plus the people next to me were very friendly and we had a nice chat.  The atmosphere seems very laid back and conducive to such interactions.  (Note: it's not like a sushi bar; they don't serve you directly.  A server will come up behind you and take your order.)

You would be well-advised to make a reservation if you want to eat there on a weekend night - it was completely packed with a line when I went.  I got the only seat left in the place!

Note: the food here is VERY salty because they use a lot of finishing salts.  If you aren't into that, just request your food with ""no added salt.""  I had the pan con tomate (tomato bread), espinacas (wilted spinach with apples and shallots), papas arrugas (salted roast potatoes with red and green chile sauces - not spicy though), and the chef brought out a sample of the veggie paella!  I also had apple sorbet for dessert.  (For Bay Area people - they use the same Pacojet technology as Scream Sorbet to make an amazingly creamy vegan sorbet).

Everything was very tasty, if a bit oily and salty.  Very rich!  (I will order w/ no added salt next time.)  The folks next to me shared their sangria, which was very tasty (although not made the traditional way... they add the fruit to your glass rather than macerating in the wine.)

The service was very attentive at times, but hit or miss.  I had a great time and enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back with a group so I can try lots more things!

For you non-vegan foodies, you might wanna check out e, the chef's tasting room at Jaleo.  They do a 20-course dinner (two seatings a night) for ~$150.  They can make exceptions for some dietary restrictions/allergies, but sadly don't do a vegan version (yet?). 

Here is a list of the vegetarian/vegan/veganizable dishes:

Pan con tomate -tomato bread
Gazpacho - cold tomato soup
Manzanas con hinojo y manchego (minus cheese) - apple-fennel salad
Espinacas a la Catalana - wilted spinach with sherry dressing and apples
Escalivada - cold roasted eggplant and pepper
Setas a ajillo - garlic mushrooms
Trigueros con romesco - asparagus w/ Romesco sauce
Ensalada de coles de bruselas con albaricoques, manzanas y jamon (minus the jamon - ham) - brussels sprout salad
Remolacha con citricos (minus the cheese) - citrus/beet salad
Papas Arrugas with mojo verde y rojo - roasted potatoes

Arrived for my 8:15 reservation @ 8:00pm and checked in. Was told I could wait at the bar and buy the $18 Gin & Tonic (apparently the best in Vegas) and they'd call me shortly. about 1.5 hrs later, I finally was seated. yes. 1.5 hrs... and given the reservation was for 8:15 I was pretty disappointed. Even more disappointed by the fact that I watched a walk-in that had arrived AFTER my group and was seated before us (there were a few open tables we conveniently stood by that the walk-in's got). There's no question, the hostess just forgot about us. it wasn't until the bartender noticed our annoyance that he went and got us a table. Strike 1.

I love (and I mean LOVE) tapas. We ordered a bunch of traditional dishes, expecting them to be a little more traditional. The patatas bravas (that were around $14) was a bowl of potato chips w/ mayo & spicy tomato sauce on top of them. yes. POTATO CHIPS. This was highly disappointing. Strike 2.

Service was incredibly slow - we ran out of water and waiting over 30 minutes trying to get a refill. WOW. Strike 3.

Out of the dishes we ordered, I couldn't point to a single one that was better than the food at Julian Serrano (in Aria, just next door). And of all the dishes we ordered, all were more expensive than their counterparts at Julian Serrano. None of it tasted bad, I just can't justify the price for the taste.

During our meal experience, there seemed to be confusion and miscommunication between the staff which was appalling considering the restaurant, at such a high price point, considers themselves as ""fine dining."" This was definitely NOT a fine dining experience. 

We called the restaurant manager the next morning to notify him of our experience and collective illness, and although Dillion was sympathetic and attempted to make amends, our time Saturday night and Sunday morning (some into Monday) in Las Vegas was completely lost.

We ordered a variety of items to share between a group of 6 people.  This included Vieiras Con Salsa De Romesco (scallops), pork and foie gras canelones with bechamel sauce, grilled skirt steak with piquillo pepper confit.  

The scallops were 2 tiny little scallops that were presented in such a dismal way that would never have made it past Gordon Ramsay in the show ""Hell's Kitchen"" (you know, where the scallop station is the death of every contestant!).  They were tiny and drowing in this orange sauce.  

The pork and foie gras canelones were probably the best out of all the things we ordered.  No one could detect the foie gras though.  They looked and tasted like little enchiladas so if there was foie gras, it was minced into the pork inside the canelones.  

We didn't eat all that much, but our bill was about $900 for the six of us.  If the food had been spectacular, I would have said it was completely worth it, but the food wasn't even ""great.""

Patatas Bravas - Also quite tasty. This was by far the best 'bang for your buck' of the plates we got.
Chorizo casero con puré de patatas al aceite de oliva - The potato had better flavors than the chorizo. I don't know if that speaks to how amazing the potato puree was or if the chorizo was a little tame.
Gambas al ajillo - I don't eat shrimp, but my friends said the sauce that came with this was some of the tastiest of the meal. They were sad to not have bread or something to soak up the rest of it.

We came in a little early, around 4:30 so the place wasn't hopping quite yet for dinner. After our flight and check-in to our hotel, and then getting over to the Cosmopolitan, (which is beautiful by the way) we were ready to eat. We used Open Table for our reservation, as we weren't sure what to expect. They're on the conference floor of the Cosmopolitan, and the restaurant is big and open. I wasn't expecting such an open and airy space. They had high tables in the main space, as well as a space off to the right with I believe a mix of lower and higher tables, as well as high bar seating, and then actual bar seating along the wall of the main space. At the back of the main space was a huge open kitchen with a fire pit where they make their paellas and that was so cool to watch. 

We both ordered teas, although their drinks looked amazing. The menu is so big and comprehensive with big descriptions that it takes a little while to pick out a small handful of items to order, especially if  you're trying to coordinate with another person. Our waitress, Morgan, was more than accommodating as we read our novel menus and picked out our tapas. We decided on the following: 

Lomo Bellota: We started with the Smoke-cured, acorn-fed pork loin. It was thinly sliced, nicely presented and had a lot of great flavors, we enjoyed it. 

Gambas al Ajillo: This was my husband's choice - shrimp in a garlic sauce. It was actually a tomato garlic sauce, and came with a cute, miniature piece of baguette, he liked it.

Paella de Pollo: The chicken and wild mushroom paella was by far our favorite dish of the evening. While filling, and a decent portion, we ate the whole thing. It was flavorful, buttery, and just incredible. The best thing we had, hands down. 

Piquillos Tolosa: These were thinly sliced red peppers with sauce - they were fantastic. Soft, yet firm enough to pick up with a fork. They weren't spicy at all, and had a subtle sweet flavor. These were our second favorite of all that we ordered.

Coliflor: This was roasted cauliflower with green olives and dates. We weren't crazy about this dish, and felt it was an odd combination. The sweet with the cauliflower and the tang of the olives was a little too bizarre for us.

Atun con Ajonjol: My husband ended with the sesame crusted seared tuna and said that the tuna was over seared and tasted a little old, but over all the dish was ok.

I'm giving Jaleo four stars. We really liked the tapas experience and the restaurant was clean and pretty. Our waitress was super attentive and really nice, and took the time to explain everything to us. The paella is worth two stars on its own, we loved it so much. I'm leaving off that last star due to the Coliflor and the Atun con Ajonjol that could have been better, and we felt that everything was a little pricey. Otherwise though, this was a stellar experience that has us thinking about doing tapas again. Thanks!",amU2dHcyKLsbjKj3mGyaBQ,3,3,4,hC_42wntgutTBJ_I_p3RIQ

I did enjoy the open concept floor plan so we were able to see all the chefs hard at work.  However, the weird bull thing hanging on the wall was just that, weird.  Then there was the picture of the sleeping woman on the other wall.  I guess I felt like the decor didn't make any sense (I'm not an interior decorator so take it with a grain of salt), it was just a bunch of random stuff put here and there.  Perhaps I would have been more into the decor if the rest of the experience had been more impressive.

Anyway, the food was not terrible by any means.  The chicken fritters (served in a shoe, WTF?) and the ""huevo fritto con caviar"" were both quite memorable and delicious.  Lucky me, my hubby is allergic to fish so I was able to enjoy, or should I say devour, the egg/caviar dish on my own.  The rest of the items we ordered ranged from ok to good.  I guess where I was really let down was the high price of everything compared to the lack of wow factor.  Don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware Vegas can be very pricey but if I'm going to pay top price I want a top notch experience.  Given that we ate at my favorite tapas restaurant in Vegas the very next evening, got twice the amount of food and liquor, and still paid about 1/3 of what we paid at Jaleo, I can't give them any higher than 3 stars.

5100335,2013-02-24,2,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Dear Jose Andres,

Please stop making such delicious food. My bank account hurts.

Jaleo has one of the largest menus I've ever seen. Factor in my inability to settle on just a few items, I will get just about everything that peaks my interest... Which unfortunately for me is everything on this massive menu T__T The food here is fabulous. It's not just delicious but creative, innovative and exciting!

Jaleo has a 5-star selection of cured meats. I personally like to start my meal with these items. I consider the embutidos to be the money-waster section of the menu. Portion sizes are small. Zero bang for your buck but oh so totally worth it. If you're feeling frisky, opt for the kobe of pork products. You only get like 5-6 slices but the cured ham from the magical unicorn pig from the isles of... gotcha! In all seriousness, get the black-footed Iberico just once. It's supposedly fed only acorns and results in meat that makes your mouth water just looking at it.

Vegetable-wise, Jaleo makes an amazing warm brussel sprouts salad with apricots, apple and serrano ham. They only use the outer leaves and they're cooked to perfection so they still have a bit of bite. Its a good enough portion for 2 but you'll want the whole bowl to yourself. Also noteworthy is their sauteed spinach. And where else can you get Liquid Olives? These little suckers are a result of some sweet molecular gastronomy. Little blobs of deliciousness that emulsify on the  palate. Sounds weird but I swear they're amazing. They're served with 'real' olives too. I'm a beet addict and always looking for new ways to prepare them. Their Beet Salad prep is 1. different from every place else (no generic roasted beets with goat cheese) and #2 has pistachios in it--the junk food of nuts.

Some of my favorite fried items include the Bacon-Wrapped Dates (nothing special but still delicious), the fried eggplant, and the Cod Empanadas (they're served with honey which makes these totally addicting!)

Seafood: Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp & garlic) and the Squid w/ Squid Ink. If you're craving mussels, order them elsewhere. The ones here are pretty uninspired.

This review is getting a little lengthy so I'll just finish the food stuff by saying the carne asada needs to be ordered. :)

How much you spend is entirely dependent on how much food it takes to satiate your appetite and how much meat you order in comparison to the potatoes.  I mean that literally and figuratively. We generally spend $50-80 per person when we come here. Most dishes run $10-20 but of course there are the outliers (like the ham and paella). And drinks are pretty pricy here too. When you have that WTF moment when you see Jose's $17 gin & tonic... trust me and Jose when we say it is THE BEST gin & tonic you will ever have in your life. Juniper Berries are the business. Plus, be endlessly entertained by the ice sphere (which I like to obsess over every time).",AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA,8,3,5,iZCxrhvd3H08p0DWZeu2cA

I consider myself to be somewhat of a José Andrés fangirl so I was naturally looking forward to dining at Jaleo.  Needless to say, my expectations were not met.  The food itself was decent.  Not quite as inventive as The Bazaar's offerings but with the lower price point, that's to be somewhat expected.  Service, however, was horrifically below a restaurant of Jaleo's caliber.

When my party was seated, the waiter proceeded to give us the ""key dishes you should try"" shtick including the many varieties of paella that the establishment is famous for.  Okay sold.  We try to order the paella only to be told that we can't do so because we have a party of four and the menu states that you must have a party of six or more.  Uh, okay.  Then why did you just spend all that time raving about your paella?  We then ask if it would be at all possible to check if there were any other tables ordering any of the paellas that we could combine ordering forces with because we really wanted to try the paella.  Our waiter flat out rejects us without even bothering to check.  Now I understand that there's a certain protocol to be followed and I wasn't necessarily expecting an exception but would it have been so hard to double-check (pretending to check would have been more than sufficient)?  Oh and here's the delightfully irking kicker: OUR SERVER WAS WRONG.  While dining at é by josé andrés this past weekend, the infinitely more gracious and knowledgeable waitstaff notified me that every night, Jaleo makes a paella of the day for the entire restaurant to order individual portions from; the six or more limit only applies to parties who want to order a paella of their choice.  A waiter who's clueless about the menu at an upscale(ish) restaurant?  For shame.

Following the paella debacle, I excused myself from the table so I could surreptitiously notify our waiter that one of the girls in my party was celebrating a birthday and that I'd like to surprise her with a dessert.  I couldn't find the waiter so I told the busboy who had been helping our table who in turn said he would pass along the message to our waiter.  While giving us our dessert menus, our waiter proceeds to ruin the surprise by saying, ""and are we celebrating a birthday today?""  I wouldn't expect this kind of a misstep from a T.G.I. Fridays let alone Jaleo.

Had service been passable, I would have rated Jaleo at a solid 3.5 stars.  Were it not been for my wonderful experience at é by josé andrés this past weekend, I would not have even considered returning.",SHok9nHM1A3T6UDMusTBTg,1,0,2,ZplmnV5H5YRr5a1z1ogkZg

I like that they have their drink menu on their ipad, but our waitress knew nothing about any of the wines.  She was the only detractor from our experience.  She was extremely disinterested and had no personality.  She wasn't really up for making any recommendations and never really smiled or bantered with us at all.  We also had the garlic shrimp, which was just so so, the sauce was a little weird, and also the asparagus, which was amazing.

I've been to Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia, and one thing you cannot go wrong in Spain is Tapas. I've been to the Jamon joints and couldnt believe how good the food was...

So hearing this place had tapas and had a renowned chef...me and my gf decided to go to this place and test it out. It was free meal on a Cosmopolitan invite, so we said why not.

First to start the wine was great, and spanish wine always gets me in the food mood. Second we placed our order for several tapas.

While in Spain we loved the Patatas Bravas...and boy we were excited... Wuah Wuah Wuah... not only was it a liberal version of Patatas Bravas - it was salty...and it was pretty much like Potatoe Chips covered in Bravas sauce. MAN How the F can you get this wrong...its a standard in any Spanish Tapas joint...

Well to say the least it went downhill from there. I felt like each tapas I ate I was eating a salt cube. Yeah it was that bad, so bad that when we left Vegas I felt like I was on a salt binge. Whats worse is that the Jamon that we had was supposed to be good...man the cheaper ones in Spain blew this piece of ham out of the water. Yes we bought some from Corte Ingles in Barcelona and brought them home and they were better than this $17 plate.

The hostess - super helpful in showing us the gluten free menu for Ryan and taking our reservation for later that evening.  Recognized us when we came back that night and promptly led us to our table. 

The atmosphere - a bit noisy but it fits for Vegas.  The restaurant is in a cluster of all the restaurants at the Cosmopolitan and it's open to the lobby/gathering area.  It's a bit quirky and modern.  There's a foose ball table to sit at if you'd like although the stools looked uncomfortable for the meal.  Just a neat looking place.

The service - spot on.  In a tapas restaurant sometimes things get lost in the mix since new dishes are coming out constantly, but not here.  Our waiter showed up right after we got settled and handed me the drink menu (in the form of an iPad which you can then order your drink on. Neat!)  Their staff is constantly refilling half empty water glasses, clearing the latest empty tapas plate and doing it all without getting in your way.

The food - The menu has a lot on it which is typical for tapas.  Since it was just the two of us we didn't try paella although I'd love to go back and get it.  We had just gotten back from Spain a few weeks prior so we wanted to see how their Jamon Iberico was and it did not disappoint, granted we got the most expensive one - Jamon Iberico de bellota Fermin which for 22 dollars is something you can fit in the palm of your hand.  But it's good!  Other favorite dishes:  the warm brussel sprout salad with apricots, apples and serrano ham which I found a similar recipe for online and it's almost as good.  Can't figure out what I'm missing.  Ensalata rusa which is proclaimed to be the ultimate spanish tapa and includes potato, mayo and tuna in a way I could never recreate.  We had other dishes and all were good but those were the stars.  For dessert, something everyone should try in their life.  Olive oil ice cream with grapefruit three ways.  This ice cream was the creamiest, most delicious ice cream and when you paired it with the tart grapefruit...unreal.  Try it.  Seriously.

Overall just a fantastic experience.  It was definitely expensive but we were in the Cosmopolitan on the Vegas strip...it's to be expected.  Go and enjoy!",u2RLkpW3mjT-moj4_r4j9Q,2,0,5,0C33LbGELUp6tv_LFXjdmw

Service was slow, we had to look for our server every time when we tried to order something, ask for water or ask question about the menu, etc. 

We ordered two glass of cabinet, a regular plate of their ham selection and plus one order of their hand-carved, dry-cured ham aged 3-4 years that was $35 per oz. The lady who hand cut for us gave us a plate of fat! We barely saw any meat, 50% was just fat; we were somewhat disappointed. Although it was very great ham, it was not worth the price for the amount of actual meat we got.

The dishes I remember ordering included pan con tomate, tortilla de patatas, vieras con romesco (scallops), bacalao fritters, eggplant and honey, croquetas, and lobster paella.  I know we got more but I think it's probably telling that I don't recall the other dishes.  While I have always wanted to go to a Jose Andres place and I love tapas, I feel like tapas are so commonplace that I really wasn't sure how this place could surprise.  But I was wrong.  Some of the flavor combinations truly were unique, surprisingly, and foodgasm delicious.  The standouts were the bacalao fritters and lobster paella.  The sweetness of the honey mixed with the cod was delicate, comforting and unusual in the most delightful way.  And the lobster paella made me want to lick the plate clean.  It had perfectly balanced seasonings, juicy perfectly cooked lobster meat, and was just spectacular.  Everyone was vying for more paella.  

Ultimately we were all extremely pleased with the quality of the food and how affordable our bill came out to be.  The only notes that marred the experience were the overly sweet sangria (not worth getting) and our waitress who had a little bit of an attitude and could have been far more attentive.

It's a cool hip spot to be if you feel like some good food in small portions, i.e. tapas!  Let me just say wow. They deserve more recognition than they are getting absolutely five stars. There aren't many tapas places around and most are pretty average. Jaleo on the other hand is not average it is way above average. It really is that good. If you love Spanish food that is very traditional from Spain you will love this place. Some of the things you must try are the Pan de cristal con tomate which is amazing. They import the bread from Spain and cook it to absolute perfection with toasted slices of uniquely crispy ethereal Spanish bread brushed with fresh smashed tomato and garlic. Next is the Chistorra Envuelta en Patata Frita which is Slightly spicy Chorizo link wrapped in a Crispy Potato Chip with Membrillo Alioli. WOW seriously one of the best things on the menu. Next was the Gambas al Ajillo that is a famous tapa of shrimp sautéed with garlic. It's another amazing delicious dish. 
Lastly I would like to tell you about the goat cheese dish. It's called the Caña de Cabra Con Higos. It's a soft, semi-sweet goats milk cheese paired with raisin walnut bread and fig jam. Another delicious dish!

I thought the cocktails were good and the service was quite nice.  However, the food left a lot to be desired.  Everything was incredibly salty and nothing was a stand-out.  My friends and all I agreed that we could not even decide on what the ""best"" dish was because none of them were all that great.  The ham was pretty good as was the paella - though they only make two different kinds per night and the seafood one was not being made.  I think one of the salads was pretty all right too.

The wait because of Magic was ridiculous. Even with a reservation, we waited half an hour at the bar before our table was ready. That will not be a problem, because we were at the bar. Jose Andres restaurants are known for one drink and that drink is the best gin and tonic ever. This beverage has converted many who swear to not be gin drinkers. It is just that good. 

Once we got out table, it was an ordering frenzy. I will not even be able to name all of the items that hit our table, because we were flooded from the time the cava punch bowl was set down until it was time for desserts.

My expectations were so much higher having dined at the Bethesda location. Unfortunately, the food was lukewarm and was prepared in advance, instead of being freshly made. 

In particular, I was disappointed by the paella. The best thing about paella is that it comes steaming hot in a paella pot, with the rice sticking to the pot having a very distinct flavor. It even says on the menu that the waiting time is up to 45 minutes, but our paella came very quickly because it was already cooked in a bigger pot, and it tasted like it was reheated. Our waiter explained that it can be made to order only for parties of 6 or more, so if you are a smaller party it will not be as good.

My wife had the gin and tonic drink I am not usually a wine drinker but wanted to try the experience.  They started us off with the famous Iberian ham and cheese which was amazing and I can't remember all the dishes they were so much but the highlights for me were as follows:  The Iberian ham they have us generous portions of that but I loved the cheese also and wish we had more than two pieces.  The blood sausage was unique I had never tried it before.  Interesting flavors and the sauce accompanying the blood sausage was excellent.  The wines accompanied with these meals so far were ok for me I tried to meld the wine with the meals but for me they did not work well.  The watermelon salad was very good but I hate goat cheese with a passion lol my wife liked it a lot.  The gazpacho I did not enjoy i could not taste much of anything.  The paia was a bit of a disappointment the rise tasted way too oily and we were hoping for seafood but got rabbit and chorizo sausage on the side.  The rabbit was cooked perfectly and I had never had rabbit in my life.  The chorizo sausage was amazing and dish also came with spinach salad that tasted good also.  The wine pairing with this meal also was ok for me also.  By this time we were both very full and it was time for dessert.  The dessert was amazing amazing amazing amazing.  It was a chocolate cake and ice cream with a piece of fried bread I'm not sure what it was made of and olive oil was sprinkled on top of it which I think was an Amazing touch.

Sad to say that I was very disappointed. 

The restaurant had a great vibe.  It was promising.. then our waiter came.
Because I've looked this restaurant up on Yelp.. there was one particular item that I really wanted to get.. so I pulled it up on my phone and showed our waiter.
He seemed.. bored first of all.  When I showed him what I wanted, he just kind of nodded and said the name of the dish and walked away.  I guess since we weren't ready....

We finally placed our order - about 5 tapas.
I don't recall other than the Salmon Roe Cone and the Chicken Fritter thing that was pretty good and was served in a shoe... no clue why.

Here's what I remembered from my non-eventful dinner..
1. Shrimp in Gambas  - ehhh kind of rubberty
2. The fried stuff - Good but nothing that I couldn't get at any mediocre restaurant
3. Service - Waitier was not engaged.  Told me at the end of the meal if I didn't like my anchovy dish I should have told him in the beginning... well... I'm sure he noticed that the dish was barely touched when he dropped off the other tapas.  But I do give him props for taking it off my bill.  

Sooooooo all in all.. I should have stuck with my fav.. Julian Serrano.
Jaleo... Not worth it.

I also ordered the flauta de jamon y queso, which was like a long skinny sandwich. Also tried the pescado frito, or fried swordfish, which only came with one small piece. Both of those were served normally, and not inside clothing items. 

Despite the shoe, the food was actually OK, but not amazing. I would definitely recommend the margarita, it was smoky, spicy and delicious.",NUyvAo-bkfKPzUl8L8eAMw,0,0,3,wa9Gh6d45M45LlJSrL-o-Q

The steak was alright; nothing to write home about.

Since I didn't know much about the menu, I left a lot of the ordering up to my dinner companion. Everything we had was quite good and the prices on bottles of wine weren't completely unreasonable. 

There was one outstanding dish that thankfully ended the entrees; Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa bechamel. In case you can't translate that, it was pork and foie gras cannellonis with bechamel sauce and sliced black truffles on top. It was to DIE for and not nearly as heavy as the description may lead you to believe. We even managed to have just enough room for some traditional flan with a light mango sorbet. Perfecto!

Our server was great, very personable and helpful and only gave us her personal recommendations when we asked. It's a pet peeve of mine when servers say ""oh, that's really good"" about every single thing you order or they try to get you to order something in which you have zero interest. The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because it was a trendy Vegas spot on the weekend and so it was packed and loud (even at 10:30pm when we got there).

I've been wanting to try Jaelo for their Paella, as a friend had recommended it. The pre-fix menu consisted of Tichi's Gazpach, which was a very refreshing summer soup; it was chilled! Ensalada Verde Con Achoas & than the main entree of Paella; chicken & mushroom. I love the flavors of latin food so I of course had to compliment my meal with a beverage; the sangria! It offered the perfect amount of fruity-ness yet refreshing with their basil in it. As Jaleo is known for tapas, in addition to our order we had to at least try another dish or two. We tried the cured chorizo and their version of brushetta. The chorizo is highly recommended; definitely small bites but the flavor was amazing and a little kick as well. The brushetta, well its a bit salty for my liking and would probably pass on this. But my main dish, the paella. It reminded me of a rice bowl with protein and veggies mixed in. I've never had paella before so I am unsure the flavor I was hoping to capture. However, the production and presentation is worth it in the end. They cook this in the open flame right in the open area towards the back. Once completed, bells are ringing and people say PPPAAAEEELLLLAA!

This was my first time at a tapas place. We were having a late dinner (like 10:30pm-midnight), so we didn't want to stuff ourselves. With lots of helpful suggestions from our waiter, we ended up ordering (my english translations):

-Chicken fritters: 5 pieces served in a shoe. I thought it would be like popcorn chicken, but they had a creamy filling with a chicken pot pie taste

-Beet salad: yummy, refreshing, surprisingly filling. Beware the super strong blue cheese.

-Carne asada: this came out a little late. Meat lovers, specifically those like my roommate who love all-you-can-eat bbq, may be disappointed by the tiny portion (cut into about 6 strips). It's really delicious and quite flavorful though, worth savoring every tiny bite.

-Chocolate hazelnut cake: By this point, we were a little tipsy, so I can't really remember much. The praline ice cream on the side was the best.

We ended up paying $36 per person. Not bad for Vegas! Plus, we were surprisingly STUFFED (maybe from the sangria..) The atmosphere is very modern and hip, as is the rest of the hotel.

I love the decor and ambience of the restaurant, and the servers have been very friendly and attentive. However, their food is pretty awful. Their food is Spanish tapas but their quality is far from authentic Spanish flavors.

At this joint, they brought a piping hot omelette with eggs half cooked, so when I cut into it, the eggs were completely runny. While the seafood paella looked great (they came around to show us the pan when it was ready to be plated), it lacked flavor and had very little seafood (mostly rice). We ordered several other dishes but everything was pretty bad. For the price, it was a complete rip off and terrible food experience.

The food is so flavorful and well prepared. We had the pappas bravas, endive salad, chicken croquetas, and braised rabbit. The endive salad with goat cheese and grapefruit was AMAZING. I wanted another plate of it. 

We got the chicken croquetas for the novelty of the shoe presentation. They were yummy but the least yummy of the other items we ordered. I think they were $12. A fun photo op. Like the story behind it too. Apparently they had to design special shoes for the DC restaurant after concerns over cleanliness from the health department. (Kind of ridiculous because the food doesn't touch the shoe at all.)

The rabbit was tender but the skin had a nice crunch to it. We polished off allll the pappas bravas off in under 3 minutes between the two of us - they were so good!

I had a glass of cava and my boyfriend had a sherry flight that he seemed to really enjoy. 

The service was very attentive. The manager came by to check in too. 

The Cosmopolitan has such great restaurants. You could eat an amazing dinner every single night of your stay by never leaving the property. Just make sure you hit Jaleo up for something different that isn't your typical steakhouse or over-pretentious attempt at French cuisine.

This $25 lunch lets diners pick 3 tapas from 3 different sections of the menu.  The first section has gazpacho and various salads/veggies.  The second section has fried items including Patatas Bravas and croquetas.  The third section has shrimp, chicken, chorizo, and beef selections.  You can add one of the featured paellas of the day for $7.

For my three items, I chose:
- Manzana con Hinojo y Queso Manchego (sliced apple and fennel salad with Manchego cheese, walnuts, and sherry dressing).  I've had this kind of salad at another tapas restaurant and I liked it here just as much as the other place.  The combo of apple and cheese is refreshing and light.
- Croquetas de Pollo (traditional chicken fritters).  This dish comes out in a hiking shoe, Chef Jose Andres' take on fast food.  Super fun and the croquetas were delectable.  I think there were four in the shoe, but I could have eaten more so maybe bring me a pair of shoes next time.
- Mini Pepito de Iberico (Spanish mini burger made from Iberico pigs and Iberico bacon.)  The menu states that these pigs are legendary, black-footed, and acorn-fed, but all I know is that it was one tasty little slider.

Our party of four also shared an order of the veggie paella and ended with the flan, which I would think are two dishes you should eat in a Spanish restaurant, verdad?  Happy we ordered them to complement our meals and so were our stomachs.
We arrived at noon on Saturday with reservations, however, the restaurant was empty since it had just opened.  A nice, open space, you can see staff making the paella in large pans.  Our service was excellent throughout and the tapas came out at a nice pace.  I would highly recommend this lunch for the ambiance, price, and fabulous tapas.

The ambiance is a very relaxed atmosphere, with the staff welcoming to the trendiest of clientele as well as to the fanny-pack-toting tourists. There are 3 kitchens, including one huge wood fired stove for the paella (which is absolutely divine, worth the 45 minute wait). If you're not sure what to get, the staff asks you about your tastes to give you solid recommendations.

Here's what we had with our sangria:
- watermelon salad (trust, you'll never look at watermelon the same)
- the blue cheese, pear and raisin plate
- the lomo (which was so good we had it twice)
- the garlic shrimp (also had a second round, and dipped just about everything else we ordered in the sauce)
- embutido (by itself)
- embutido (on bread with cheese - a nicely salted pork pizza)
- the paella with ribs (they only make two types a night but you can order one of the others if you're okay with ordering a huge pan for your table)
- chicken fritters which looks like coquettes but tastes like chicken pot pie, served in a shoe (yes, that says shoe - it's the chef's homage to a famous athlete)
- flan (super good, I'd come back just for this)
- chocolate mousse 

Everything we had was incredibly well seasoned, with no one taste overcoming the other flavors. Yes, the portions are tiny, but it invites you to try multiple dishes with your dinner companions (and to have more sangria - go with the red over the sparkling).

So why does this review get only 4 stars?? Our Campers shoe was only a loafer. They brought someone else's chicken fritters in a cool looking high top. Totally got gypped! (I'll probably change it to 5 stars when I sober up; thank God for auto correct)

The one star is coming off on price alone. Yes, it's the Vegas strip, but no, it's not fine dining food. Get over yourselves, Jaleo.

Jaleo is a Spanish tapas restaurant and I was delighted to see so many authentic Spanish dishes on the menu like patatas bravas, enasaladilla rusa, tortilla, I could go on and on. I studied in Spain during college and I will say that Jaleo is about as close as I've seen to authentic Spanish cuisine in the states.

I was dining solo on this visit, so I sat at the bar and was fortunate enough to have dinner during happy hour. I tried the cava sangria and didn't love it, but it was sangria, so it was still pretty good. If I were to order again, I think I'd try to red sangria or the sherry.

I ordered the coca happy hour appetizer along with the gazpacho (based on reviews. The coca was decent but the gazpacho was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Seriously, it was delicious. It didn't have the acidic taste/flavor that I'm used to and was a bit lighter (did it have cream in it) than typical gazpacho. I also ordered the cono salmon and the aceitunas (both liquid and stuffed olives). If you haven't had a liquid olive before, it is quite the experience. I don't want to give the surprise away, but it would be a shame if you went here and didn't try them. I didn't quite care for the liquid olives, but it was awesome to finally try one.

As far as atmosphere goes, they nailed that one. In addition to the real wood fires burning in the back of the restaurant under the paella pans, they also have comfortable seating and fancy glasses for the cocktails.

This place had a nice ambiance and the sangria was spot on - light, fruity, and a plenty. The staff was also friendly but eek! Those were the only good things about this place.

Way to add insult to injury by making everything SUPER SALTY! This is some kind of ironic Vegas joke to put (actual) salt on our wounds, our bellies, and gouging us.

Items that were ordered with their online menu descriptions (5 total): 

1. Chistorra envuelta en patata frita ""Slightly spicy chorizo wrapped in crispy potato"": chorizo was underwhelming. Presentation looked like a tiny hot dog wrapped in a greasy potato chip. Probably didn't help also that it was served in a mini fry basket.  I had to have my fiancé eat the rest. 

2. Gambas al ajillo ""The very, very famous tpaa of shrimp sautéed with garlic"": Wow. I don't know why they put an emphasis on ""very"". That must mean that it's very very good right? Wrong. It was just okay. Each shrimp got progressively saltier. They provided a cute bread loaf with the dish, but I didn't want to dip it in the greasy juice. That should have been our first warning sign. Also - please spell ""tapa"" right on your website, Jaleo. 

3. Arroz con costillas de cerdo ibérico de bellota ""Made with the ribs of the legendary, black-footed ibérico de bellota pigs of Spain"": these legendary pigs from Spain must have been raised in a tight space and didn't eat much. They were 95% all fat and bone. Mushrooms were decent, but over salted. This paella was probably not the worst dish of the night, so we ended up eating most of it. 

I'm not going to get into too much detail on the last two dishes: mushrooms with creamy sauce and a lentil dish with pork (not located on their website...coincidence - I think not!) because we sent those 2 back. They were incredibly salty and surpassed the threshold of the benefit of the doubt - yes we turned into those people! The wait staff was apologetic and tried to offer us free dessert; they even told us these two dishes have had mixed reviews in the past. I'll give them credit for at least being honest and accommodating.

Came here with a group of 8 people and we got a private room in the back, away from the really loud main dining room.  The ipad drink menus were probably more trouble than it's worth.  The paper dinner menu is pretty extensive and we relied on the waitress to make some selections for us.  In the end, the food's overpriced and just alright but the lobster paella really saved the day. We had:

Chips and tomato paste. Meh.

Tomato bread with three selections of jamon. Iberico's the best.  Tomato bread was take it or leave it.

Chicken fritters that came in a shoe. Gimmicky but the fritters were good.

Fried eggplant. Very good.  Nice and crispy.

Brussel Sprout salad. Citrus-y and delicious.

Shrimp in a little pan. Since I'm allergic, I refrained. But the table had good reviews.

Lobster Paella for 8 people. It was the piece de resistance! Two waiters carried in a huge copper paella pan which cooked all the paella for 8 people. The lobster was wonderfully done and the rice was loaded with flavor. If we didn't eat this, we'd probably leave hungry!

Grilled Iberico pig - excellent.

Panna Cotta with citrus sorbet - excellent.

Jaleo was an great meal and we had a good time laughing and pointing at the chicken fritters in the tennis shoe.

7.  Braised veal cheeks,  OMG!  My server told me that they feel bad for anyone who doesn't try this.  I'll agree with that!  So tender that you can cut them with a spoon.  Also the Morels and olive oil potato purée don't hurt either.

8.  Secreto Iberico,  the secret is out!  This is the best cut of meat in Vegas!  Pork steak that is tender like filet.  It's like I went to bacon heaven!


Food great!  Service, on point and friendly.  Jose's gin and tonic is just wow!  Plus a great selection of Spanish wines that don't hit your pocket like other places on the strip!  I will definitely go back and let my friends know!

Thank you Jose!",GjVAyY5axHFdHLnRNgC3PQ,2,0,5,YiExK5fiY-WIdC7IaAObyw

Went to Jaleo with a group of 10 people. We started off by ordering a bunch of tapas. They are all very good, but came out ridiculously slow. We were all sitting there asking where the damn food was. Then when stuff finally started coming out, it came literally one item at a time. Again, there were 10 of us, and these were small tapas plates, so only half of us would get literally one bite of food and that was it.

Then we decided to get a paella. They have 5 paellas on the menu, but only 2 of them are available on any given day. The night we were there, they had one vegetarian paella and one that had rabbit. I'm not a fan of rabbit and others in our group were incredibly opposed to ordering rabbit, so that left us with one paella option, the vegetarian one. For a place as expensive as Jaleo, to have that bad of a selection is completely unacceptable.

They do get 2 stars instead of one because the food was good, but the service, selection and price will definitely prevent me from coming back. There are other tapas restaurants in Vegas that are just as good, but with better service and selection for less.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,0,0,2,knuhe37e0RV3qSG9pRN-og

We got lucky and got seated in a private room because there were 10 of us.  Service was great EXCEPT from our main server.  She was a total biatch! She got annoyed when we didn't order a mass amount of alcohol. Sh!t, with the prices we had to pay in this restaurant, we couldn't afford alcohol.  She recommended the pork paella.  It was not very good at all!!! The pork was just spare-ribs with bones in it.  It was very difficult to eat because the meat was not tender so you had to rip it off the bones. The rice was uncooked!  We mentioned this to the waitress and she made some excuses and said that is how it is cooked.  Then she dismissed us by saying ""sorry"" very sarcastically.  

Bottom line, if you guys like your rice cooked, DO NOT order the paella!!! It is NOT good.  Everything else is okay, just okay, not delicious.",bP7mHFO4PKof0Wt3rTKs-g,2,2,2,gm4LyjZUBX_PnIXv4OLYVw

This was not the best and does not compare to his others like China Pablano or Bazaar both food and experience wise. The tasting menu offered about 9 or 10 dishes to try, the most impressive thing was the very first. It was an appetizer of a special toast with fresh tomato spread, not tomatoe chunks, but a spread. It was so crispy, and not the ""scratch the roof of your mouth"" kind of crispy, and light. I would come back just to have this bruschetta for breakfast! 

I liked the cheese and 18 month old prosciutto pairing, would've been perfect with a few olives. The chilled apple soup was also nice, refreshing like gazpacho. The other dishes lacked flavor and some portions were too big to carry on with. The calamari and paella seemed to be served in full portions. It was practically enough for 3-4 people for a tasting menu. I hate to waste food. The cauliflower with olives and dates were fantastic, but I do wish our server had suggested us to eat them all in one bite. I steered away from pairing a date with cauliflower and olive, but eventually brought myself to try it. Had our server suggested it, I would've done it instantly. Sometimes it's nice to be explained how to eat such peculiar pairings in a dish. The quality of the food was on the table, I really liked the quail, but the flavor was not. The service could've been better overall on keeping a better eye on our table and cleaning it. They didn't change our plates until halfway through the meal and they were already pretty dirty after three dishes. The non-alcoholic drinks took a while/felt forgotten.

5680717,2012-01-23,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"Out of all the restaurants in Las Vegas, I think that Jose Andres has picked a very nice spot to set up shop.  From the beginning the atmosphere at the Cosmopolitan Hotel is flashy yet not overly commercial.  The restaurant has a great external appeal, with an open eating area, mostly white decor and big chunky tables for seating in the overflow area.

The wait staff seemed young and a little under experienced.  We got shifted wait staff within the first 10 minutes of being in the restaurant and the young lady we were left with was bubbly, yet didn't know quite what she was serving as in experience.  She also had a painfully short attention span and would walk from the table without warning.

The wine list was heavy on $100+ bottles with a scattering of under $100 bottles.  We opted for a $48 bottle since we didn't need anything expensive and the bottle was still excellent.  If you go, don't bother with the American wines, as those are priced way above the $100 mark per bottle and for a casual tapas meal, IMHO you don't need to spend the money when most of the wines on the list are probably good selections.

We started with a board of all the cured meats, which included both the iberrico hams, the chorizo, serrano and pork loan.  We paired that with some manchango cheese which all together was great with the bottle of wine we were enjoying. And the quality of meat was a good amount for two people to share.

Next we had the salmon roe cones, which looked like a borrowed dish from Thomas Keller's French Laundry with a play on the ice cream cone.  The cones had salmon roe on top and filled with crab, which was tasty, but the roe didn't really stand out much.

We then had the egg topped with caviar, which was spectacular, but it wasn't the egg or the caviar which made it, but the caramelized onions under the egg made it a home run.  All together it rocked, but if it didn't have caviar on it, I don't think you'd notice a difference.

Then came our seafood tapas, we had the shrimp and scallop dishes, which were both excellent and cooked perfectly.  Out of the two, the shrimp was the clear winner, and if I did it again, I'd get two of those rather than the scallops.  

Our last tapas was the veal cheeks, which were served over mashed potatoes, which was like a braised short rib without the unnecessary fat.  Very tasty, but I'd like a little finishing salt on it to bring it home and cut the richness a bit.

After it was all said and done with we signed the not so expensive bill with a couple expressos which was absolutely a great finish as the expresso was very smooth and went well with the whole meal.",SJ8MTBIMfoJS7dD00QqNtQ,1,0,4,xk4Sh_JxC5zrzPFhTivBUw

Chorizo w/fried potato - I personally liked the dish because I'm a sucker for chorizo but no one else cared for it. 
warm spinach and pine nut salad - boring and tasteless
Seared Scallop - Overcooked 
Grilled skirt steak - Ice cold by the time we received it but had decent flavor
Apple and fennel salad - Probably the best dish of the meal but it's a salad!

Shrimp skewers - Greasy 
potato and onion fritatta - We did not order this dish but it came to our table anyway and we ate it because we were so hungry. Decent, but I could make it at home.

The main issue I have with Jaleo is the small portions. $7 for a plate of potato chips with red and white sauce drizzled, my coworkers make this at lunch in the lunch room, its called lays with sirracha and onion dip drizzle. We ordered to our hearts content but our stomachs were far from filled.

Don't get me wrong, I understand quality over quantity, but if you really break it down, give me an endless supply of the minuscule tapas, so small I can barely remember what I ate, I still wouldn't come here. The plates are small (yes for the 4th time in this review, not sure if I got my point across), but the quality of the tapas are not even that great or anything spectacular. The entire dinner, I couldn't stop thinking about the cup-o-noodle I purposely didn't eat because I didn't want to spoil my appetite, bad move. 

This place is not good for groups, seeing as you have to order at least 3-4 orders of each tapa to feed a table of 9-10. One star for the creative serving style, putting deep fried bacon covered dates in a shoe, fooseball tables doubling as a dining table, and decent service is about all there is to rave about here.

5753831,2012-01-19,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"I've tried to go to Jaleo for dinner twice before, but neither happened.  I wish I hadn't pushed for a third try, because this meal sucked.  I would've given it one star, but one thing we had was really good, so it gets an extra star.  

My favorite foodie friend and I were both in Vegas on a Friday night, so decided to go to Jaleo.  He has been to the one in DC before and liked it, and I like Jose Andres food, so we were both excited.  

We were sat promptly, and the waitress came over a few minutes later.  She gave a whole canned speech about the menu (which is something I hate)...and gave us the iPad wine list.  There are some relatively good priced wines and of course lots of spanish options, so it started out good.  

She finally came and took our order, and we got a few things from each part of the menu, including the Paella Valenciana.  She told us they would group our items from the kitchen light to heavy and stage them to come out 1-2 at a time.  Great.

However, that wasn't the case.  We got three things within like 2 seconds of each other.  The first things were 1. Pan con tomate (Toasted slices of rustic bread brushed with fresh tomato). this was adequate.  not quite the traditional way, but tasty enough; 2. Some tiny green olives stuffed with anchovies and ""liquid black olives"". this dish was $14 for like 5 small green olives.  total rip off and i know anchovies are salty, as are olives, but this dish was too salty to eat...and yes, i've had them both together before and it doesn't need to be that overly salty; 3. tortilla de patata (Spanish omelet with potatoes and onions).  i'm about to get married, and this is one of the dishes on my menu, which means i've tried about 20 tortillas from caterers over the last few months, and this version was the worst i've ever had.  previously, i was shocked by how bad some of the caterers versions were of this dish, but this dish was twice as bad as the worst.  first of all, she asked us if we wanted it well done when we ordered it.  this is not a question that should be asked.  it's supposed to be a simple dish:  onions and potatoes sauteed til tender, add egg, let form til set completely.  that is it.  we got it and it was wet, and runny, so not even well done like she asked if we wanted it.  it was also super thin, with only like one layer of potato.  it was so gross we didn't finish it.  

So then we flagged her down and said we wanted to slow it down a bit, since everything so far had been rushed to our table. This was a mistake, because from then on it was supperr long wait for everything.  She told us then that our paella was ready, and we said oh no thanks - we want to wait until the end for that dish, since it's most like a ""main course"".  This is after she told us the kitchen would structure it light to heavy for us, so delivering paella with the first few things made no sense.

The next dish was Ensalada rusa (a salad of potatoes, imported conserved tuna and mayonnaise).  This was ""okay"", but not great.  It was much better than it looked - It was covered with foam.  It looked like my cat threw up on it.  I'm not a foam fan.  But the potatoes were cooked well, and the tuna was tasty.

The next dish was the Seared scallops with romesco sauce.  The dish arrived and was pretty enough to look at.. However,  both our scallops had grit.  This, is not good.  Neither of us finished our scallop (the dish had two) and we called the waitress over to tell her they were gritty.  She apologized, but didn't seem to really know what that meant. 

Then we got the last dish before our paella...the veal cheeks with whipped olive oil potatoes.  This is the only reason the restaurant got 2 stars.   This dish was really good.  Looked good.  Tasted great.  Very tender veal cheeks.  The potatoes were fluffy bites of heaven.  Very very good.  This is what I expected every dish to be like, but sadly, it was the only good dish.

So now we are excited to try the paella.  i guess i was still holding out hope it would save the meal?  but the waitress comes over and tells us that they're out of the paella.  What?  We ordered it an hour ago.  They had it.  You tried to serve it to us at the start of the meal, we said we'd wait...and now you're out of it??  She offered us a different paella, at double the cost of the one we ordered.  We said, no thanks.  And were super unhappy about it.  We were both still hungry, but didn't want to try anymore crappy food, so asked for the bill.

We got the bill, and the damn scallops were still on it.  We called the manager over to complain (we've both been in the biz for years, and if someone complains about a legitimate quality issue, that should NEVER be on the check).  So we explained that they were gritty and shouldn't be on the check.  He apologized and claimed it was an oversight and took it off the bill.  

Overall, a disappointing meal and I'll never go back.  It was so overpriced and only one thing was good.  Sad, sad, sad.",t6-0kqMXbAXWpgYM7X_wPw,2,1,2,R462MUz8JnDaS30SrZx1ng

OK, the bad reviews are due to either going in the first few weeks of opening (in which all restaurants have issues) or having never been to Spain and experiencing real tapas.

This is the first time I have gone to a Spanish tapas restaurant in the US and had it taste like the flavors I tasted in Spain.  The food is amazing and prices are actually quite reasonable considering 1. it is Vegas and 2. the prices would be the same in Spain but in Euros.  If you compare it to some of the restaurants nearby then you would realize the price to food ratio is actually quite good.

We ate there 3 out of the 4 nights we were in Vegas because it was so good and even though we live in a foodie town we can't get great Spanish tapas.  Some of our favorites - the oyster ""gin and tonic"", gaspacho, chorizo fried potatoes (chistorra envueita en patata), tomato bread with manchego cheese, ham selection, lobster paella, and seared lamb ribs.  We also enjoyed the brussel sprout salad, lobster salad, garlic soup, and rossejat (fried pasta), 

We loved everything except the raw salmon crudo (which was overpriced and lost it flavor buried in olive oil and pine nuts), the clams with lemon - which were not special and had some sand in them, and the croquettes which were the best we have had but we are not lovers of croquettes.

If you know Spanish tapas, you must try it.  If you don't, still try it but you may want to ease in with the items most Americans would love - seared lamb, garlic shrimp, croquettes, brussel sprout salad, and try some hams and cheeses.  Enjoy!!!!

September 2012

Jaleo is part of chef José Andrés' Washington, D.C.-based empire, and the second of his restaurants with that name. His Las Vegas offerings also include é by José Andrés (a paean to molecular gastronomy) and China Poblano (Chinese and Mexican).

***The Menu***
There are pages of tapas, so take your time perusing the list. When I went, there were a couple of specials; check with your server. Paella is available, either as a single serving of the daily special, or as one of several available if ordered for six or more people. Lastly, a caveat: while a few of the tapas are small, many are nearly entrée sized.

***The Atmosphere***
It's a large, open space, brightly lit. There are many hard surfaces, making Jaleo a fairly noisy place; contributing to this is moderately to loud music. All in all, pretty much what you'd expect from a restaurant located in the Cosmopolitan. I ate at the bar. It seats around 15 people; the full menu is available. The bartenders, dressed all in black, are very friendly; my bartender was glad to discuss not only the drinks, but the menu.

***The Food***
I asked the bartender whether I should order a couple of items at a time, or everything at once. He suggested I might as well order everything at once; since there were several cooking stations, dishes would tend to appear slowly, over a period of time. That's what I did, and that's what happened. In no particular order, here's what I had:
**Ensaladilla rusa con atún en conserva, with optional trout roe. Yeah, this is just glorified potato and tuna salad - but it's really good potato and tuna salad. The chunks of tuna were a lot firmer and moister than Starkist; dollops of flavored mayonnaise were a nice touch; the optional trout roe was tasty. This was one of those entrée sized tapas.
**La Serena con membrillo (La Serena cheese and quince paste cone). Think of this as a tiny ice cream cone (one large or two small bites), filled with a creamy cheese and quince paste. If you're familiar with mango paste, quince paste is very similar - perhaps slightly less sweet with a slight amount of bitterness. I'm not sure why, but I really enjoyed this one.
**Fricandó de carilleras de ternera y puré de patatas al aceite de oliva (veal cheeks and morels with olive oil potato purée). Two large chunks of cheeks were soft and rich - just the way veal cheeks should be. Just as rich were the whipped potatoes. I liked this dish a lot, but you have to like meat that is soft and fatty.
**Bacalao (salt cod; off menu special). My bartender recommended this dish. It was a special they started serving the night before. The dish consisted of a generous chunk of salt cod. Slightly chewy and salty, I liked both the texture and flavor. Accompanying it was some rich mayonnaise or aioli or some such thing. If this is still available, it's worth ordering.

***Summary***
The Strip now has two high quality tapas bars: Jaleo and the nearby Julian Serrano. I've only had one meal at each, so it's difficult to say which is best, but I'd give the nod to Jaleo. I enjoyed my dishes slightly more, and the atmosphere is a little more upbeat. However, they're both winners.

***The Bill***
The meal was about $60, plus drinks, tax and tip. This will vary a lot, depending on what, and how much, you order.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,3,0,4,lqIpGDuf3zCIsgo6IEkJ6w

5816663,2017-09-16,0,K0j_Znzin0jShXVnpvW86A,"TIP: There are better options in the Cosmo...and Vegas. 

While working PAINWeek, my company was searching for a place to accommodate a party of 5 at 2:45pm on a Thursday, during the Exhibitor's lunch break. This was the only restaurant that could accommodate our ravenous crew without a wait. 

Unfortunately, for a restaurant in Vegas, the service was subpar. While we got our water right away, after the waiter introduced us to the menu, it took him at least 15 minutes to return to our table to take our orders. We guessed that this was due to placing the orders of two larger party's who sat down before us, but we finally flagged down our water boy to see if he could hurry our waiter along. 

We all settled on their $25.00 3-item lunch special...but nearly every item (minus the specialty of their homemade daily paella) left us underwhelmed. The choices were unconventional, almost experimental but the portions were also very small, even for tapas. My ""mini burger"" was akin to half a Krystal burger and, while packed with flavor, was memorable only for its extremely petite size. I also ordered the garlic shrimp (their most popular menu item and if I had to guess that's because it's the most recognizable combination of food.) Everyone else got a mini skillet brimming with oil and garlic sauce to dip the accompanying breadstick in...except for me. And while the shrimp was tasty, it wasn't mind-blowingly delicious. 

I was shocked at the steep prices of their regular menu items ($17-20+ per plate,) and I certainly would've been annoyed at the quantity vs quality, if wasn't a company meal. 

The decor is bold colors and mosaic tiles, a swankier version of what you'd expect in a Spanish theme restaurant, but it's nothing luxurious or overtly unique.

If it's you're only option, (like it was ours) you best not be a picky eater, otherwise, I'd strongly recommend going somewhere else. Either way, you're likely to still leave hungry and unsatisfied.",kiifWjFj0hjdMST9ly_AUQ,0,0,3,zIKS3A3WAUJl3ux5s8JMpw

1. This is Vegas. Everything is overpriced. The sooner you realize that, the sooner you can accept it, move on, and enjoy yourself. Considering everything on the strip is overpriced, Jaleo really isn't that pricey.

2. You're at a TAPAS restaurant. Everything is small plates. That's the point. Don't expect a huge, Hash House portion of jamón ibérico and croquetas, and you won't be disappointed. The whole idea is to order a bunch of small plates and share among friends. It's social! It's fun!

3. This is a a José Andres place. Andres is into molecular gastronomy and generally screwing around with food to make it fun, playful, whimsical even. Croquetas in a shoe? Bring it on! And please, like the health department would let them use worn shoes? Come on.

I went for my birthday dinner with my best friend, and it was awesome. I'll admit I have a bit of a culinary crush on José Andres, so I was preconditioned to love it, but it really was great. Loved the sangria, the croquetas were practically orgasmic, the dates were magical, and that was hands down the best damn flan I've ever had in my life. And I'm a big girl--I've had my share of flan over the years. The patatas bravas aren't traditional--they really are like thick chips--but they still taste like the real thing. 

None of these things is necessarily ""revolutionary"", but they're really effing tasty.

Our waitress was great, but the kitchen staff forgot about one of our dishes, so it took forever. (No matter, I'm a fan of the slow meal.) Another busser brought us someone else's croquetas by mistake, but our waitress let us have them anyway. ""Well, someone screwed up, but they're on the house, so enjoy!"" The kicker is that in my mango sorbet, I found a tiny piece of plastic that came from the container they stored it in. Lucky for Jaleo, I'm pretty hard to piss off in a restaurant. I told the waitress, she brought the manager over--the GM, not the shift manager, he explained what happened, I said it was cool (I'd also had a fair amount of that delicious sangria), then when we got the check, they'd knocked off a more than decent portion of it for all the tiny hiccups.

Hiccups aside, it was a great meal. I'll be back, but with more people so we can try everything on the menu. It's casual, but classy. Definitely a fan!",DZaduiZ7eGCEN4Jio9kd1A,9,5,4,8f2Fv0jCiu3My-SGCw0xeA

I did enjoy this restaurant. It was fun, unique, and the food was great. The only issue I have is that we spent about $150 (did include alcohol), and we were not full when we left. I'm a big eater, and tapas apparently are just not my thing. Unless of course it includes an entrée afterwards.

The food was very good though. Every dish (with the exception of one), was amazing. The fried bacon-wrapped dates were amazing, and the paella that we ordered was fabulous.

I did like the presentation of most of the tapas, one even came in a shoe! The atmosphere is very fun and unique, I also love that you can see the food being cooked. We ordered a porrone of spiked cider, and that was fabulous! 

Overall, the price is what got me. For Vegas, it's actually not that bad. But for me, if I spend that much money, I want to leave full.",r2PsG-EqKTE2s0Zl0TS2KQ,1,3,3,ofcSQv2SAmlRAJY1EyghMQ

Gelato to tart to eat. Cooked onions to sweet to eat. Steak not seasoned at all.

The restaurant itself is very loud and it opens into the even louder second floor of the Cosmopolitan, so leave Grandma and Grandpa at home, because they won't enjoy the noise level.

The prices are usually noted as being on the expensive side, but four of us ordered everything that we wanted, including alcohol, and the bill came to exactly $200.  Every dish was great. One of them we ordered a second time because the first one was so tasty. Really helpful service. I advised of my allergies only once, and had no problems all evening.

Let's start with the layout.  there were tables with uncomfortable chairs, or these long couches which went around the restaurant.  The couch things were comfortable if you were sitting back having a cocktail, but not so much if you were trying to eat a meal.  NOT a deal breaker, but weird.

The food -- some of it was great, some of it was ok, all of it was overpriced.  They had a specific vegetarian menu which was really nice.  Made it easier to find the veggie options on their extensive menu.  My friend (the vegetarian) had a goat cheese endive salad which which was divine.  A ""warm"" spinach salad, which was totally average and these weird eggplant things which were tempura fried and drizzled in honey, which she thought was good, I thought were a complete throwaway.  Three little founds of eggplant, almost tasteless but sweet from the honey for $9.00.  We both agreed it would have been better as a dessert.

I ordered piquillo peppers with a bit of iberico pork lardon, which was probably the best value on the menu.  $6.00 and completely tasty.  But definitely better to split and because of the pork I didn't have a person to share with.  I also ordered a cauliflower, date, olive dish which was divine.  My big splurge was Iberico Pork - which I thought was going to be roasted, but was in fact cured.  It was fine, it was good - but it was $35.00 an ounce.  For $35.00 I want a little more than some dried ham.  It came with a side of tomato bread, which I didn't know when I ordered it.  I HATE tomatoes.  I tried the bread, but I just couldn't do it, so I asked for some plain bread.

When the bill came, I was charged $12.00 for the bread.  TWELVE DOLLARS.  

I asked the waitress, who had been stellar to this point, and she said they charge the same price for bread with or without the tomato  TWELVE DOLLARS.  

She apologized for not telling me, and I told her I never would have paid TWELVE DOLLARS for bread.  (seriously, 6 slices of french type bread.) and she said she'd see what she could do.  Two seconds later, she was back with the full bill. 

Did an an order of $12.00 bread ruin my experience?  Yes, yes it did.  What a stupid thing to upset a customer over.  

Oh, I also had a $12.00 sangria.  It was adequate.  There's a place in Winters, I get a superior Sangria for $7.00.  

Caveat Emptor.  Would I eat here again?  Before the $12.00 bread, yes.  After the $12.00 bread.  No.  I hope it was worth it.",wKPSHbz603kqaAXm-Fw9hg,5,1,3,S5xcip93iRSdxneO7e2Deg

We started with cheeses that 1) came out of the kitchen almost instantly and 2) were exceptional. The next dish which our server described to us as similar to a carpaccio but made from pork came out with a really unique presentation and was just as delicious. 

We then sampled the fried lobster and crab fritters which my husband says ""changed his life""... he may have been exaggerating but they were amazing. 

Lastly we had the skirt steak entree which was served with an aioli that I couldn't get enough of and the steak was cooked perfectly and jam packed with flavor.

Nothing overwhelmingly great, but the lobster salad was good, as were the gambas con gabardina, and the endive with goat cheese. The pan con tomate with anchovies and the the bacon-wrapped dates were both ok, although nothing spectacular. And we should have stayed away from the patatas bravas, which for some strange reason consisted of a bowl lays potato chips squirted with sirracha and mayonnaise. 
The real killer for the evening was the service. I realize dumb people have to work someplace, but do they all have to be assigned to my table? The bus boy kept awkwardly climbing over us or shoving himself between us trying to take our dishes and glasses when we clearly still had food and pitchers of sangria in front of us. At one point he practically tried to take the fork out of my date's mouth mid-bite. An I once had to slap at his hand to keep him from taking my plate. He's very lucky he didn't catch a fork to the hand. The waiter was really no better, and screwed up our order at least 5 times. It's 3 days later and I'm still waiting for my gazpacho.

The creamy cheese was enhanced by the salty crunch of the almonds. Followed by air bread wrapped in cured ham and tomato foam, an explosion of delicate flavor. Next came imported breadsticks with cured Spanish sausage, which was sublime. 
Next came cod fritters with honey aioli. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy inside, with a sweet, delicious contrast from the aioli. This was followed by king crab salad with salsa Rosa. It was a lot for, refreshing and delicious dish. 
Roasted peppers with goat cheese: the slightly sweet, fire roasted peppers contrasted nicely with the tang of the goat cheese. 
The shoulder cut of a Spanish pig was served with mustard aioli, cilantro aioli, and lavender stems. The meat had a nice crisp finish and was tender and juicy, and the sauces contrasted one another nicely. 
We special ordered our favorite, rabbit and chicken paella, a delicious house made rice dish. They feature a different paella every night. 
This was followed by a green salad. 
For fun, we also ordered fried chicken fritters, which are served in a shoe. Cute and delicious! After the variety of meats and sauces, the salad, with its tangy vinaigrette, tasted light and refreshing. The roasted pine nuts added a satisfying crunch and a rich flavor. 
Finally for dessert, a cherry, sherry Grenada with a vanilla, olive oil ice cream. 
When you come, be sure to ask for the server Darian. He is friendly, personable and knowledgeable. He makes wonderful recommendations and know a lot about each dish and all the varieties of wine.

It is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas - consistently fantastic food and service. Incidentally, my other favorite restaurant in Vegas is China Poblano, so maybe it is a Jose Andres thing. 

Yes, it is expensive. No, this should not be a surprise. Jose Andres is an award-winning chef. The menu is posted online WITH the prices listed. This is Vegas. The price you pay, however is 100% WORTH IT. 

I am one of those restaurant patrons that asks a lot of questions (What's your favorite dish? What's the most popular? Would you choose __ or __? How is that prepared? What's that dish over there?) and the waitstaff always answers my questions without any attitude or annoyance. They're friendly and fast. 

It is loud. Every 45 minutes or so they ring a bell and yell ""Paella!"" when the paella is ready. They are accommodating of groups, so large groups of people who have had too much sangria can get quite raucous. But it's also fun. Barcelona is loud. Barcelona is raucous. This is not a white-table-cloth restaurant, so don't expect that type of atmosphere. They have a foosball table as a table.. it has been my dream to one day be seated there, but I'm beginning to wonder if you maybe have to ask when you make the reservation. 

Now the food....

Pan de cristal con tomate fresco - tomato bread - sounds simple, but is remarkably delicious. Reminds me of bruschetta, but with a crispier bread that doesn't hurt your teeth when you bite into it. 

Jamón ibérico de bellota Fermín - fancy ham - comes with tomato bread. I am not a major ham connoisseur. I am amazed at how they can slice it so thin (by hand!). 

Dátiles con tocino 'como hace todo el mundo' - bacon wrapped dates - not my favorite bacon wrapped dates around

Croquetas de pollo - chicken fritters - I was worried this would be fancy chicken fingers. Instead, it is like a pot pie wrapped in a mozzarella stick. SO GOOD. Ultimate comfort food. I wish I could eat this once a month (if you know what I mean ;)). Also, it comes served in a shoe (a Camper shoe, to be precise), which is fun. 

Salmón crudo con huevas de salmón - salmon / roe cone - I really liked the cone part, but roe is so salty, so the overall effect was pretty salty. Good, but salty.

Ensalada de bogavante con cítricos y escarola - lobster & frisee salad - comes with a generous portion of lobster. I do not like frisee, but my mom loved this dish. 

Coca con erizos de mar - uni toast - comes with a LOT of uni. Although, now that I'm writing this review months later, I don't really remember anything that special about it. 

Rossejat - noodle paella - SO GOOD. Definitely a must-order. 

Rossejat negra con cigala - squid ink rossejat - also really good, but I like the regular rossejat better. I don't know how they get the inside of the Norwegian lobster to such a creamy consistency. Be careful about letting this touch your lips, it will stain them a lovely shade of grey. 

Canelones tradicionales de cerdo y hígado de pato con salsa béchamel - pork & foie gras canaloni - the ultimate indulgence. Really rich and creamy. If you are lactose intolerant, you might have a stomach ache after, but it is so worth it. This is such a rich and heavy dish, if you order this I recommend maybe selecting one item fewer than you would have. 

Other notes - 
I recommend the white sangria over the red.

There were so many booked tables on a Tuesday night, But the very upside to this experience was our waiter MAXWELL and his table assistant EDGAR. From the beginning of our night, it's been a pleasure. We started off by sitting on a section where the a/c is blowing right directly on our table so we respectively asked to be moved to a more warmer section were the a/c wasn't blowing right above us. EDGAR, was very quick and helped move us and also MAXWELL was there to move us as well. My husband and I ordered the ""Restaurant Week"" menu while our son had the grilled hangar steak. Maxwell was very prompt in talking to our son on how he likes his steak made and if he would like it better if the sauce was on the side. Max was always checking on us and making sure that our experience was excellent, and it was! EDGAR, who also knew that our son was cold due to the fact that he forgot his jacket, helped his chill come to an ease. He came by and gave my son warm glasses from the dishwasher just so my son can hold something warm. With this gesture, it really made me feel that these employees are very helpful and innovative.
