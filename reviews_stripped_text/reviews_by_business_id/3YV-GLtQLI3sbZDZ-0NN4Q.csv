I got a flyer in the mail for a free sandwich to use @ several locations in Vegas & chose this one cause it was on my way to work. 
Well let me tell you the friendliness of the staff there. As soon as I walked into the store I was greeted by a female who said hello to me & asked me how I was! YES, I was acknowledge!! Always a great feeling when entering a business. I showed her my flyer & she ranted what a great deal it was. I placed my order....Italian sandwich, one that I always get, very yummy!  She went over the ingredients with me to make sure of the ones I wanted, also asked me if I wanted any chips or drink. I sat down while I waited for my sandwich to be made. The store wasn't very busy when I was there. (Thursday a little after 6pm)
I didn't wait very long maybe 5 minutes if that, she offered me a bag & actually brought the sandwich over to where I was sitting ( I was taking it to go).
Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Vegas. The bread is always soft & they don't skimp on the fillings. I will def. visit this location again due to the fact of the location & the friendlessness of the staff there.",w8QdFtVKqtGn9QhkRDbAFQ,1,1,5,QBxr6uVKc09TkOaPavN1lQ

Then she was the only lady at the store so I asked the guy who was a manager who was at the register, is that the only lady here right now? he said yes, that's the DM, I was freakin appalled!!! What I'm getting at is this, you don't ever hang up on someone in the flash of an eye like she did with out giving it a second, I mean absolutely worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Then the manager went into the back to explain to her that the people she, the DM, SO rudely hung up on, we're now here in the front and very displeased with her customer service she just provided. She didn't even bother to come out and show her face, probably because she was too embarrassed that the people she just hung up on we're now there. So she never came out, however the manager of the store, a young African American male, he was top notch on the customer service he apologized and said he was very sorry, he even offered us a bag of chips on him because he felt so bad for her bad service she just provided us with. This is a bad DM and she needs to be retrained on customer service immediately!!

I always end up ordering the Bobbie, the Capastrami, or the Slaw Be Jo. On this occasion, I ended up ordering a medium Slaw Be Jo($8.39). As usual, the sandwich was tasty! 

I am psyched about having a location so close to the house!

The employees were polite and friendly. I was automatically greeted when I stepped through the door and was given great service even when I picked up my sandwich to go. I don't think a lot of people are really aware of this location yet. It was pretty dead in there. There was only one other patron, besides myself. What was funny is that I counted no less than 5 employees there at the time! Whaaaaat? Man, you guys are really ready for when the ish hits the fan!

4654902,2016-02-20,13,3YV-GLtQLI3sbZDZ-0NN4Q,"This is a CRAPRIOTTI'S

   Capriotti's is a casual fast food restaurant chain that specializes in cold and warm subs. Their signature sandwich: the Bobbie was voted the best sandwich by AOL in 2009. Regardless that the majority of the 106 Capriotti's are in Las Vegas, their first location was established in Delaware back in 1976. Unfortunately, I am reviewing a different place than Capriotti's because the place that I stepped inside of yesterday fails to abide by company promotions. This is a review on a Crapriotti's abbreviated Crap that is Capriotti's in name. 

   I have yet to try a Capriotti's sandwich. When I look at Yelp pictures, my mouth salivates because they look good. Capriotti's - THAT MEANS EVERY LOCATION-was promoting the 2 For 2. The promotion is that you get a 6 inch sandwich and soup for $2. The promotion was active til the 19th. After work, I made a beeline for this location. Squeezed in between Eastern Avenue, Serene Avenue, Interstate 215, and shops; the parking lot is difficult to get in n Out of. Ha! That's funny because In N Out is in the parking lot. If the experience was good the ordeal of the compacted and congested parking lot would be worth it. 

   Upon walking inside one of the few kids working here  greeted me. I let him know that I wanted the 2 for 2 promotion. He informed me that this franchise owner was not doing this promotion and that I would have to drive to the Anthem location. He'd tell another customer the exact thing. Interesting! Next to me was a mutant  picture sign promoting the 2 for 2. The kid went on to say that the franchise owner also took the promotion off this location's Facebook page. 

  The 2 for 2  developed into a 1 for 1. This would be my one and only visit here and I was going to rate it 1 star. This franchise owner is not a team player. It is pure greed to not abide by a company promotion and consequently cheat customers out of their time and to shove the money losing promotion on the back of another franchisee. This is a franchise owner that is penny wise and dollar foolish. Capriotti's did not come up with this promotion to loose money. No way! The idea was to introduce customers to their sandwiches and hoping they will return. In addition to the greed, I distrusted the kids making the sandwiches. When I walk in a restaurant and see all kids minus management, a mental red flag appears. And when the kid is telling me that Silverado Ranch Road, which is two traffic signals south on Eastern is Anthem that is three miles south; I don't want him making my food. In a way it is a good thing that this franchisee didn't abide by the company promotion. 

   In the future it is a possibility that I will try my first Capriotti's sandwich at the Anthem location. But never will I return to this Crapriotti's unless I see the ""Under New Ownership""  sign that could make this location  worthy of the Capriotti's name.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,23,10,1,j_Ydez3wUfH0DXOV3t5hMw

There was one customer in the whole place (also waiting). when we walked in,  they immediately told us we have to wait (well of course,  right) understaffed??? We  asked for extra mayonnaise on our bobbie and I swear they forgot the mayonnaise  all together, then they tried to give us the other guy who was waitings sandwich??? confused ?? This location also doesn't have Bundt Cakes Terrible service and sad bobbies with no mayonnaise.",wBTiTBbfhGypfABrBQ1lxA,1,0,1,53_5PaxbWQxIAt6DSDhULg

The service wasn't anything special. Not insanely good nor bad.

I mostly rate it so high because I'm in love with their turkey and the crushed hot peppers. If you haven't had this sub TRY IT. I'm actually getting hungry just thinking about it.",eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ,1,2,5,lZwX88kiLuVQnYIwvysRFA

Capistrami with no coleslaw. The last 5 times we have gone, they hand us a Capistrami with slaw and we make them do another one.

Well when I got there I realized I called in my order to the wrong Capriottis. The guy was nice enough. He took my order and everything. My sandwich was ready in like 3 minutes. He literally rung me up, gave me my change, and by the time I walked to the fridge and got a bottled drink it was ready. The only thing bad I can say is that the turkey on my Bobbie was REALLY dry ! Like it had been sitting out . It sucks because I haven't had Capriottis in so long that this was a bad Come back lol otherwise it was good .",7wpoh2s6b4KKgx5F9CN8bA,0,0,3,2x093zbd93Lzgx29HtgGPg

What for? I didn't have him make me a sandwich or anything else.I simply bought Wise Potatoe Chips.Im a Bartender and when my customers want water or anything else I give it to them ,ring in the amount of the purchase  and if they leave me a tip find and if they don't that's fine too!

Went in and picked up my order and asked if the sandwiches were labeled. They said yes and I paid and left! Mind you I had my 3 month old with me so I was in and out fast! I drove twenty mins to my husband office to find out that they had messed up the order! I called and the mgr was rude. Telling me if I wanted a new sandwich I would have to bring the messed up one back! I did mention that I was 20 mins away and it is lunch time! He told me how was he suppose to believe me!! I told him I would take a photo and text it to him! This location has horrible service! Not accommodating at all! The mgr should pick a new career,UefKNgo8xUfCu-_8b5VS0w,2,0,1,YEtVNXe0C_JzOIFG701QGA

I was expecting the usual generous portion of meat, cheese. It was skimpy.  I always add mushrooms and onion added only here they were frugal on the add ons. I paid extra for them and got a pathetic portion of everything.  For a small sandwich and small drink totaling almost $11.00, I expected a bit more of a lunch. I base my expectations off my many other visits at several other Capriottis locations. It tasted ok. Service was good.",0BOh3qCWGwSoCJmS5JxsmQ,0,0,3,bcfMuZmwrn6mg8rwCtaLWw

 I always go to the one at 9620 S. Las Vegas Blvd Suite E5, Las Vegas NV 89123.

 I placed the order over the phone. One Large Italian with extra onions, hot and sweet peppers on the side.

 I don't think they put extra onions on the sandwich, and the amount of hot and sweet peppers on the side was barely enough for half the sandwich.

They did not have a Military discount like the other store
.
Everything about the sandwich seemed fresh and tasted great, but I will be staying with the store at  9620 S. Las Vegas Blvd Suite E5, Las Vegas NV 89123.",JsnTacT_QDEoVB5hfszkEg,0,0,3,a0wH4jf9GIHeAtuMP_9Mlw
