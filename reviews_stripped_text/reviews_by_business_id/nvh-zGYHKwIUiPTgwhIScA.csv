615336,2014-12-06,1,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,Worst experience ever. They messed up my order twice. Tacos were soggy and hardly had anyway meat. Customer service was horrible to. They were rude and had no customer service skills.,XyiJj0D40kI8hkjP0aprFg,0,0,1,C5m6UzIb2NGVPnYS1u_n-g
1570639,2015-12-02,0,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,This place is so disorganized and the staff is honestly not very friendly.  First if you ask for something that is on your meal to be on the side they charge you an extra .30 per item and then they completely messed up my order.  I will not be returning here.  I guess the only good thing is the food was hot.,VvzYseV3va7nbX5umoJhCw,0,0,2,Mc4RdlKRPk45_fUoA3jJYQ

They forgot part of my food and I had to turn around and go back but then I get all the way home and the rest of my meal was missing the sour cream that I had to pay extra for ! My daughters box meal she got didn't have the sour cream either ! SMH ! Come on people it's not rocket science it's fast food and y'all had two customers and like 5-6 employees !

Obviously after coming here frequently for those 2 years not all my meals were perfect and I've had typical fast food issues like messed up orders or messy tacos or whatever but it's expected from all fast food but all issues here were handled greatly. Idk if it's because Every time I ordered my drink I said bah-jah but they always recognized me and were happy to see me which made my visits nice wether I was getting off work or drunk at 1am. They have some really
Great people working there and I hope they are all fortunate to move on to bigger and better things, restaurant can be cold if you dine in and bathroom had no mirror which are the things I noticed. Some new guys working there seem zoned out but they perform the job adequately. All in all please continue to serve fellow military members with the same service I got and people will love this store as I came too. Lastly I hate this place because I gained like 10 pounds eating here haha",prHkF6HHZXHQj6g3uTrLlw,0,0,5,2ctiM0XME4VIg4pVKn2h9g

I couldn't even really enjoy it. I can't be going back waisting my lunch time on getting napkins and hot sauce do you just use 3 sauce smh,6_AugSHouBMud2ngS-RoqQ,0,0,2,Lp81iJDPLiocm4kA9ah7IA

I ordered a power veggie bowl no beans + onions, jalape√±os, lettuce, and tomatoes. When I got home and opened it up, they had everything there except what actually comes with the bowl like guacamole, sour cream, pico de Gallo, cheese, and avocado ranch sauce. Literally wtf?

I've ordered a power bowl burrito  ahead of time, so that I can go pick it up on my lunch break, and for some reason they can't get simple orders right. If I ordered something to pick up 30 minutes ahead of time, why is my order still wrong?! This is like the 3rd time in a row they've fucked up a basic burrito so this location sucks and I'm done",mFlFMd4-Caiiza7G5s5nhg,1,0,1,GtDvSaApR6LCKSmuXUR-Vw
4103857,2017-08-09,0,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,This Taco Bell drive thru is rediclious at night. Waiting 15 plus minutes to get to the speaker and another 5 minutes to get your food is crazy! You get stuck in the line and can't to anywhere and then I'm missing a taco!!! Not the first the first time I have had this experience but it will be the last time. A manager or store owner needs to fix this. How long does it take to make tacos or burritos with pre-made ingredients in a system where the process is standardized for efficiency? Never fast food restaurant with such poor service.,bXq3gieHC4jry6c_jgihpQ,1,0,1,3G_Nmbu_GWyvgfFYT1oGMQ
4202891,2013-06-18,0,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,I really like this location.  It is conviently located near Nellis AFB but away from the more seedy area.  I eat here about twice a month and have never had a rude staff member at either the drive thru or inside.  Clean!!  So hard to find on Craig Road.  Yes its fast food but the Cantina bowl is awesome and rocks my socks!,UK_1WY6M9cXpEF-O62hlFA,0,0,4,QRFdkDFRugPZUZMGio7f-A
4451966,2015-06-19,2,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,"This is my favorite Taco Bell because it is the closest one to my house. So when I decide to fill my mouth-hole with Doritos Locos Tacos of varying colors/spices I come here.

Often I enjoy getting several Doritos Locos Tacos and turning them into a taco rainbow. I then supplement the tacos with whatever bonkers/delicious scheme Taco Bell has come up with in the past week, such as the Grilled STUFT Nacho, which happens to have a festival of basic carbs that make my blood sugar rocket within seconds, meat/beef (?), AND NACHO CHEESE AND RED TORTILLA STRIPS FOR LYFE.

Oh, also Taco Bell has embarked on putting multiple gut-bomb items in a box, so you can forgo the peasant-like plastic bag they put your ONE TACO in - but seriously, who gets one taco when they go to Taco Bell?

I am not a fan of their burritos, as I can get a magnificent burrito from Chipotle. However, I do have a space in my heart for their hot sauces that give me endearing messages.

Other notable mentions: Nachos Bell Grande, any of the items in which they wrap up another food item with a quesadilla-like shell, and the ""Meal Deals"" that come with tiny bags of Doritos, because yes, I need to eat Doritos with my tacos.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,2,4,Mtm5RABjyD8GOiji6o6cfg

I even said it twice to make sure she understood. Well, it had cheese and sour cream on it. Took it back and the girl said she didn't hear it. The supervisor took the chalupa and threw it in a trash can 15 feet away and started to talk under her breath. Not even a sorry for messing up my order. Oh, the beef didn't taste right, just wanted to finish what we had and get out. Never again. You guys are BAD!!!!",UJe8vesHhf3NyfBzaoMbbw,0,0,1,64CdmEuupAiN5ssEw-5T6g

Not no booty shorts w/ her ass cheeks hanging out, REGULAR SHORTS. Whether that person was a boy or girl he/she said ""r u trying to look for a husband is that why you coming up in here dressed like that"" WAY TO GREET A F'n customer huh?!

5603178,2015-06-27,0,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,"I eat here more than I like to admit in public.  Mainly because there is such a limited selection of vegan options around nellis AFB.  Gotta love the Ghetto and the junk food that comes with it. Lucky for me their beans are vegan. Can I get a whole foods out here please?

But back on point.  This is probably the best taco bell in the Valley for lunch.  All the tables are always clean, service is prompt, and orders are always made right if you are there when the manager is present or during lunch hours.  I know places don't have their A team work late night, and the quality shows if your getting a burrito fix after the sun goes down.

One cashier kind of rubs me the wrong way due to an unprofessional attitude, haven't seen her in a few days so she may have been reassigned or fired, but again...  It's a taco bell.  

All in all, great during the day, but quality slips later in the night, so 4 stars, rather than 5.",8VMvdpLOHPTu_-QGZkjwlA,0,0,4,lx3Uc4h1CRpnEHDSOcO7Eg
5715827,2015-05-05,2,nvh-zGYHKwIUiPTgwhIScA,"Today 5-5-15 Taco Bell offered a free breakfast biscuit taco for Cinco de Mayo! 
I went this morning and scored one of these bad boys (a $2.59 value!).  Not bad, actually much better than it sounds.  Imagine a warm, flaky, buttery biscuit with fake powdered eggs, sausage, and cheese.  The biscuit is flat and then they put the ingredients in a fold it like a taco.
Restaurants that that have special promotions like this but don't tell you something is free is a pet peeve of mine...I expected to drive up to the drive-thru and hear ""Good morning, would you like to try a biscuit taco for free?"" but nope...they wanted to keep it a secret I guess. 
Thanks Taco Bell! It was yummy.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,1,4,Sgtr-k-6f7z5F8PmuRYvVQ

Again, a satisfying Crunchy Taco Supreme with fresh and cold tomato pieces and Mild Hot Sauce followed by a Burrito Supreme that was a nice contrast of warm refritos and ground beef melding well with cold sour cream.

This time, not arriving famished, I ordered and ate reasonably.  Again, XXX-1/2 stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,1,2,3,F0D5bn9slxWgf7EaWCi8Rg
