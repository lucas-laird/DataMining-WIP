Very good customer service. Definitely I will be back. The decoration is great. 
It is a new place but I think nothing to envy to the big restaurant chain. Keep it up guys.",hTUvO33yAAHiSwepon4mXw,0,0,5,1eGuTEbytCLjMlErniJpEQ

171776,2017-09-18,0,dSjzFrUbIjqlhd2cJp-zSA,"Chicken wrap was BOMB.... I haven't written a yelp review in awhile but I was moved to do so thanks to the very nice guys working here but more importantly the AMAZING wrap and salad they made me.

$8 bucks for a huge healthy wrap, I recommend the Green house made little spicy sauce, and a Spinach salad, AND a bottle of water or soda.  

Can you beat that nowadays?  Forget Greens and Proteins next door, their salads are BLEH!

1824091,2017-05-18,0,dSjzFrUbIjqlhd2cJp-zSA,"It's okay, but... a half chicken plate with a drink and tax sets you back about $20.  No bang for the buck.  And there's lots of places for a full meal well under $20.  I don't mind paying for a nice meal but if you're gonna charge me big bucks, don't give me styrofoam plates and plastic ware and make me stand in line and bus my own table.

On the plus side, good service, clean, comfortable, and fresh salads.

On the neutral side, the sides are on a steam table and covered. You never know what you're getting until it's scooped.  The mac and cheese was left open and looked dry.  The server stirred it up to look better just before he took my order.  They seem a little stingy on the salad fixings with 3 options.  I'm sure having an open salad bar has it's drawbacks, but the current system seems to gouge you for more $$$ to add extra toppings...and as I mentioned, it's expensive enough as is.


On the negative side, the chicken was seasoned well and the skin had great flavor.  That flavor doesn't make it to the inside of the chicken.  Therefore the chicken is rather bland and maybe a tad dry.  The dipping sauce certainly added flavor but I think the chicken should have some kind of cooked in seasoning.
Again, $20 for a full meal seems a little steep.  Nevada Chicken Cafe and others do a much better job at a much better price.

Two stars because, Meh, I've experienced better.  It's has potential.  in reality it's just fast food at gourmet prices.  I have nothing against the place other than seasoning and price.  Perhaps if they had daily specials where you really got bang for the buck, I'd return.  Perhaps they could do something to promote the salads as a deal and use good chicken chunks instead of that god awful shredded stuff they use.",OW4B7pknQ5znZP5t1esanQ,2,0,2,4C_h9QNmcQ5U8kYLgC3JQA

4403576,2017-04-13,0,dSjzFrUbIjqlhd2cJp-zSA,"Great concept but needs work. The chicken was little dry but decent & the mashed potatoes were good. The negatives are:
1. No kids menu which I would expect from a place like this. My son had the adult portion chicken fingers which he said was good but to big a portion & you pay an adult price for your kids. 
2. Drinks need work. Literally they have a few different brands of canned soda & bottled water. No ice tea, fountain drinks etc. such an easy fix especially with those multi flavored machines that take up very little space. 
3. This one is nitpicking but no music playing which makes the atmosphere kind of weird when you eat there. You're listening to the air-conditioning running the whole time. 
That being said it's worth trying. They've only been open for a few days so I will try it again after a month or so when they work the kinks out.",wXwquz8zJo4HDxQidEQgIg,4,1,3,3iwlhqlXQQ0iW4P6827sqg

4991144,2017-04-12,1,dSjzFrUbIjqlhd2cJp-zSA,"Guess what Rotisserie chicken sell?  Rotisserie Chicken!

They're located in a strip mall near Rainbow and Sunset, which has plenty of parking.  I saw that they finally put a few chairs outside, which told me that it was time to try a new restaurant!

The restaurant is set up chipotle style, where you walk down a queue, order along the line, and pay at the end.  They have a huge sign showing the combo plate options - (1) choice of chicken size (2) choice of side (3) salad options.  The chicken comes in quarter, half, and whole sizes.  I got the quarter, which is essentially a large sized leg and thigh.  I suppose that you get two legs/thighs for the half size and four for the whole (but a Chicken only have 2 legs?? idk). 

Being a new restaurant, the staff struggled a bit to get me through my choice of sides and salad, but I'm sure they'll get that down in no time.  Drinks are not included in the meal and they only had bottled options, so I couldn't even ask for a free water.

Since this place specialized in Rotisserie Chicken, I certainly had really high expectations for the Chicken.  I'd give it a 7/10 in juiciness and 8/10 in flavor.  It was good, but not el pollo loco good. 

The sides were OK as well too - nothing really good or bad about them.  However, I was super disappointed with the piece bread.  The cashier took it out from a huge plastic bag.  It was stale and boring.

I do like how the restaurant encourages the cudtomers to sort our trash into paper/plastic, glass, and waste.  Its a good thought, except the cycle goes ""reduce, reuse, and recycle"".  100% of the stuff I got was disposal, which kind of defeats the cycle of ""reduce and reuse"". Oh well.

Overall, the food was ok, atmosphere was great, and staff were friendly.  I think the food will get better as they refine over time.",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,3,0,4,WcG5lUbRiuNOjIb1nkZrlg
5154904,2017-05-15,1,dSjzFrUbIjqlhd2cJp-zSA,"NOT BAD AT ALL. 
This place recently opened up so I had to try for lunch.
It's a small place that is still airy with nice big wooden tables to sit on and a simple line to order that leads across the front of the food area. The lady serving food is always very pleasant and helpful. I found their chicken to be quite juicy and delicious - in a way an honest chicken should taste like - with no gimmicks. I like their slaw and corn to accompany the chicken. (you get 2 sides with 1 being either salad or slaw) You also get a biscuit and can treat yourself to free lime/lemon drinking water in the back. 

I found the 1/4 chicken meals to be filling without being overpowering and now it's my go-to lunch spot while on assignment out here as this place can stand toe-to-toe to good rotisserie chicken lunch spots in my home, NYC.
