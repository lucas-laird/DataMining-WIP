Food was good I had the lunch special, shredded chicken tacos. Chicken was a little bland but that's what salt and pepper is for. The tacos are really big too! I'll definitely be coming back here!",1nvX6QJBsSgi-xqqNLJiSQ,0,0,5,f-z7eNy6tum9TGJHsTkraA

Oh yeah lunch special amazing honestly this place was pretty cool

Our waitress was very fast, however, she didn't speak very much English. That was was kind of interesting. Overall, very yummy food with fast service. Also the chips and salsa was some of the best I've ever had!!!",MvopBhTTSN0DAc03bI0GdA,0,0,4,9eM8gxRFKSY7yG-fBA7e0Q
3465481,2018-02-25,0,8sFRqawo8bDDWiaC9wkA5g,I was a little hesitant at arrival but was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. Im so happy I found it and gave it a try. One of the best cheladas Ive had and such great food and so much of it. The service was excellent especially since they only had one server running the floor. Ive been looking forward to going back ever since.,mSR_aMs_EhRWvHOjRBq3sA,0,0,5,SY3rmL327I28GnPu0ie_lg
3494213,2018-02-03,0,8sFRqawo8bDDWiaC9wkA5g,"This by far the best Mexican food restaurant in Las Vegas. The food is very tasty, the drinks are good and the service is great. We got the lunch special with the chicken enchiladas with the red sauce. The enchilada was filled full of chicken, the red sauce was very tasty but did not drown the enchiladas and the beans were awesome. We got the 2 for 1 marguarita special on the rocks and they were big and great. There was a generous bowl of hot tortilla chips at the beginning of the meal and the salsa that was served with them was mild but very good. This is a great place to enjoy MX food",Os4xct_bJoake5XrAncZ6Q,0,0,4,oMJuxuaAVtsjPsMTkSL89Q
3755276,2018-04-24,1,8sFRqawo8bDDWiaC9wkA5g,"4/24/2018  I revisited Las Micheladas for lunch and it's still great food at a great Price.  I took 3 pictures of my Chicken Enchiladas that is served for $6.95 (plus tax) for lunch.  The Enchiladas came with rice and beans and a cheese sauce with lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and it was delicious.  They have great TV screens (11) and play great Mexican Music.  They are very accommodating and if you tell them how you'd like your food, they will follow your instructions.  It is a great place to have a semi-private lunch at very reasonable prices.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,2,2,4,6HRnXEpcqCDuRfDBSTiWbg

3970748,2017-12-28,1,8sFRqawo8bDDWiaC9wkA5g,"Well, I am still looking for a go-to Mexican restaurant in this town. I really wanted to like this place. I ordered a burrito. I asked for it with no beans, but the menu did not mention it had rice so I didn't mention it to our waitress. It came with rice. :'o( The tortilla was dry and hard, like when tortillas get old; I couldn't eat the outside edges. It also said it came with guac; it came with maybe (underline this word and make it bold) two tablespoons in a little cuppie, and the cheapest side order of guac was $7. This is just a personal pref, but I do not like it when the burrito is grilled (like a panini). We also did not get any chips and salsa. Our server was nice and friendly, but we didn't see her after she delivered our food; we had to go get her for extra water and the check.",eLOLEOTp9c1gTdOY4fWPUw,1,0,1,p6fqw1iPwJWEPOfNUZw3cA

We waited for about 10 mins or so and food came out i was impressed big plate and looked very colorful the queso fundido was awsome one of the best i ever had my shredded beef in the enchildadas was very soft and good taste i really liked how it was just the beef and no veggies in the meat and it came with rice and beans on the side i will come back! 6.99 lunch totally worth it!

I cant say anything about the food cause i didnt get to try anything, not cause i didnt want too but my order came out wrong and by the time the waitress came by to check if everything was ok (15 mins later)  my lunch break was about to end so i just paid my drink and left. i gave my credit card to my waitress (Ines) she looked at it and said if i didnt have any cash to pay with insead.

Great food, staff and owner. All of that combined with affordable pricing (check out the $6.99 lunch specials) and that = success. 
I've been there alone, took a friend and went with a group of 10 and each visit was without a hitch. I just discovered that they open for breakfast. Can't wait to try it.",y-lwSVyY5IxN8lB5pvGmXA,13,2,5,v8NbeHY8HmCR3lM_ivfV9Q
