1783797,2017-03-23,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Ever since they posted the ""coming soon"" banners, I've been excited to try Moo Woo.  But now that I've tried them, it's going to be my one and only visit.  I think I'll take a little extra time to drive over to the Spring Mountain area or other locations where the Korean BBQ restaurants are a little more seasoned in impressing and retaining their guests.

My trial was during a quiet lunchtime.  It took a while for someone to notice me and then, even though I said it was ""just me"", they still sat me at a huge BBQ grill table.  There were other smaller tables available nearby.  They were gracious about redeeming their Yelp offer--either a wet towel pack or facial.  And, they brought a nice amount of banchan, with fresh types of kimchi.

The lunch menu isn't huge, but there is good variety. I ordered the Galbitrang ($13) the short rib soup which had an adequate amount of boneless short ribs and a modest amount of noodles  The broth was nondescript--mild with salty undertones--which I had to amp up with some kimchi. I wasn't expecting a rich simmered ramen broth, but had hoped for something with more umami.

Service was forgettable.  Maybe they do a better job with the actual Korean BBQ grills in the evenings, but I would hope that any restaurant would set higher service standards no matter the time of day or size of the group.  I had such hopes for experiencing this place, especially since this area of the valley can use more diversity.  Unfortunately, Moo Woo turned out to be fairly average, especially compared to what you can get if you're willing to take a short drive elsewhere.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,0,0,3,FU-RE-JgafQ6WPBFY7IAfg

Personally I am extremely picky about the way my bibim bap is made, (spice, proportion:price, flavors and presentation) It has exceeded all my expectations.

Reasons for five stars:
- Excellent service, not only to our table but to others as well
- Price, seems a little too much but sides were limitless, and portions per serving were generous, even if they were to cut down it would still be worth it.
- Quality is exceptional, bright red meats no sign of freezer burn or marks.
-Atmosphere is moderate, nothing to flashy, but the place is clean and well kept. 
-Service time on a slow day is great, as per a busy day as well. Its understable to have  slower service on a busy day especially at Korean Bbqs, I am most impressed that they handled all the tables with only 3 people on the floor.

All in all, If I am ever in the area, this will be my go to, as well as if friends or family need recommendations. Great job guys!",1MLDG3lxKa8rFbVpnWJ2Mg,1,2,5,JT2I5cS6FCry32gKbBQq6g

When we arrived the establishment just opened, there were 2 other couples seated in the front and we were given a table at the very back next to the doorbell and soda fountains. Anytime someone walked in the bell would go off, and it was literally right next to our heads. There should probably be a better place for that doorbell. The other problem was that red wine (merlot, cab, and Pinot) were all refrigerated. The staff has mentioned to the owner that it shouldn't be, but he insists it should.

Once my friend arrived we ordered the Woo combo and a peach Soju and everything was wonderful. My biggest pet peeve about Kbbq places that cook for you is their cooking pace. Some places take forever to cook the different meats but Moo Woo didn't seem to drag by, everything was cooked in a timely manner to where I didn't get full fast or get bored.

They have a lot of unoccupied tables in the middle section and on the other side of the wall. There was only one family aside from us who was seated down. We were dressed decent coz we came from work. So why so rude to ask your customer to give up a table for another customer who made a request to be seated particularly that  table?

This made me think that Moo Woo discriminates. We're the only Asian-Americans there. We walked out.  This is so dirty. I summed up our first experience as Very Dirty, Dirty Dining!!!

We walked in, the dining area smelt great, and they sat us quickly. The menu was simple but I personally thought pricing was to high. 

I posted a picture to my Instagram stories and this was the text I sent a girlfriend who asked what I thought: 

 It looked good but it smelled even better. Sadly the pork burned while we waited for our cook. We also weren't sure if we were supposed to serve ourselfs or wait for someone to plate it for us. Another disappoint ment was the pork tasted like it had soaked in Mexican chill spices for days. It was just way way too much. 

And the beef was just OK. Not great, just ok, but I will say it was much more enjoyable than the pork. I have a hole in the wall place here in Las Vegas I love. It is hands down the best damn Korean BBQ I've ever had and it's $15 to feed 3 people. It's an hour round trip to eat there so I was hoping to find something close to home but no such luck yet. Tonight we spent $50 for two meats, didn't eat the pork because it was not enjoyable, didn't get any rice with the meal, and they forgot my pot stickers lol I was so over it and ready to leave.

2956077,2017-09-05,2,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Moo Woo is a good choice for Korean BBQ (no AYCE here btw) but unless you live in the immediate area, there are better options in Spring Mountain. Nevertheless if you decide to go to Moo Woo then you won't be disappointed.

First off I love their current check-in deal. As of August 2017, you can receive a wet towel or facial mask. Sort of different than your plain 'ol free drink deal, isn't it? Seriously +1 for uniqueness!

The interior is clean and looks pretty cool. I like how simple the place looks without screaming kbbq too much. Moo Woo is located in a shopping district and has plenty of parking spaces as well so it's very accessible.

The meat choices are pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless. There is a variety you can choose from and the portions are decent. I'd say most of the choices were fresh and very filling. I think my favorite was the beef briskets but the marinated chicken was great as well. The banchan is good, especially the kim chee.

Overall my experience at Moo Woo was enjoyable. It's good to see a Korean BBQ joint in this part of town. I think it's a solid choice but I will say that since it's à la carte you expect high quality meats because you are paying a premium. The meat is good but I've had the same quality at even AYCE places such as Gen BBQ in Henderson. Moo Woo is faaar from where I live so I probably won't be back for a while but I'd recommend it to anyone that is around its vicinity.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,6,2,4,Q4eybIjiT_GlYP0tH3SHDQ

2993250,2018-05-14,3,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Another victim of 4.5 star rated restaurant. This is literally the worst kbbq experience I've had and this restaurant can get away with it because they have no competition in this side of town. 

I came here for Mother's Day with my family of 3 for the first time based on good reviews. Me and my sister ordered the moo combo to share and my mom got the bibimbap.

The moo combo said it feeds 2-3 people for 53 bucks but I'm surprised if it can even feed one person. It came with 8 thin brisket, 1 strip of pork belly and 1 strip of pork neck, 1 sirloin,  bulgogi and spicy chicken in the smallest possible portion I've ever seen.  Keep in mind these are not even quality meats either and are usually in the lunch or cheap price at ayce places.

Next is service, there were 2 guys helping us, an Asian and a white guy. I honestly think something was wrong with the white guy because all he could say is ""here's that."" Everytime he would bring our food he would only say ""here's that."" When they forgot our steamed egg and bulgogi for 20 minutes, and I asked about it the guy brought it out and just said ""here's that,"" and when we paid and he gave us our check back all he said was ""here's that"" and nothing else. He was obviously new because he was always asking the Asian server but they should train him to be friendly and teach him manner words like ""thank you"" and ""sorry"" before teaching him anything else. 

Next is the ventilation. This place has some serious ventilation issue compared to all other kbbq places. My mom couldn't breathe halfway through the meal and had to go outside for fresh air. I also got a headache in the middle of our meal because of the terrible ventilation.

Overall, this is probably the worst kbbq place in Las Vegas. Hugely overpriced, tiny portion, horrible service,  and ventilation issues. This is the only kbbq place in this area so they know they can get away with it. For people thinking about dining here, don't make the same mistake as us and drive a little further for a better kbbq experience.",bmmgelxV1eBpWmT32F3xhA,4,0,1,i8V2p_8xRBNkkS4NOCYdsA

The food was flavorful and all together delicious. They offer to refill any side and provide rice if you want it. I tried the Korean raspberry wine and it is amazing. I am not generally a beer drinker but I tried the Cass that my husband ordered and I liked it.
The sampler which you can get to feed 2-3 Ppl or 4-5 is more than enough food.  The wonderful thing is you can take extras home with you.  We will definitely be returning.

3114621,2017-04-16,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"First off, I'm really glad I found a K-BBQ place that's not located in or near Chinatown. I came across this place by accident when my siblings and I were driving around the plaza to see what new businesses have opened up in the area.

The main thing I noticed about this place was the cleanliness and how modern it looked. Everything still looks brand new. Majority of the seating are booths, which I like, because it offers a lil bit more privacy. Plus, the coziness. lol

They do not offer All You Can Eat (AYCE), but the quality of the meat was great. No problems there. Our server did all the cooking and cutting of the meat. He made our first visit more personable by having little convos with us every time he came back to the table. The rest of the food's taste, such as the side dishes and mini appetizers, were good too.

I really like the fact that this K-BBQ is set apart from the rest. It gives options to those who live in the northwest part of town and who don't want to travel all the way down to Spring Mountain.

Despite all of the above, I gave this place 4 stars due to a few things that could use some improvement. Our server didn't come back to us after the last set of meat was cooked. Someone else took over and... well.. that was it. 

Also, they were mopping and cleaning around the tables/booths right next to us while we were eating. They should worry about the side that has no customers first, before going around the entire restaurant. They close at midnight, but they already started cleaning up around 11 pm. I don't want to smell the aroma of a mop and cleaning products while I'm eating.

Other than that, we all had a great time and would come back again if we're in the area.",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,8,5,4,NdkcTRCj2PwfvrJJG_hHiw

The Moo  combo are pork dishes $45 for small and $75 large and the Woo combo has beef dishes $53 small which is good for 2-3 people and $85 large for 3-4 people. We were hoping the combo would have both pork and beef but you have to order MooWoo combo which is $140 or 4-5 people. You can order individually but that would have been way too pricey compared to combo dishes.

We went with small Woo combo because we like beef more than pork.  It comes with prime brisket, bulgogi, rib-eye steak or boneless short rib, Joo Mul Luk (which is premium cut beef seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt) and kalbi.  We went with the rib-eye steak. The dishes were accompanied by house salad, steamed egg, your choice of stew (soon tofu, kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese. I liked the bean paste stew.
We also ordered spicy chicken wings which was ok, the chicken was soft.

3568393,2016-12-01,1,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"AMAZING!!! I am so happy this placed opened. No they dont have AYCE (all you can eat) but honestly why would you want to stuff yourself so full of meat? We ordered the small beef combo for my husband, myself, and my son ($53 before tax). It was Plenty enough, we had to pack some to go. 

SERVICE: Perfect. Our server was very attentive, friendly, and nice. They cooked the meat which I loved cause finally I can enjoy my meal! The owner even made her way to greet us. 

FOOD: High quality meat. Makes all the other AYCE restaurant look bad. The side dishes(banchan) were a good variety and delicious. Coming from a Korean myself, it was authentic. Loved the soup (duangchang cheegae) and the fact it came out with our food and not in the end.  I don't know why people complain about it not being AYCE, I'm sure you really dont need all that food.  

INTERIOR: Clean, spacious, and the tables are big! The dishes and water cup is not all cluttered in front of you. Great design!

Seriously has made me a regular. Love this place and if you want a great meal, this is the place to go!",aCst736y4WZPO9Hz62D-mQ,2,3,5,fo3kyLJ-RntxkocuHlcvPw

I got the bibimbap (since I have been craving) and my boyfriend got bulgogi . My food was too delicious I didn't bother to take a picture before I feasted.

3700707,2017-08-26,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"First of all, 3 stars seems too little, but 4 stars seems too many for this restaurant. The atmosphere and the service are close to 4 stars.  The price, meat quality, and menu selection are close to 3 stars. 

I have always been curious about Moo Woo because it is about the only Korean BBQ place in this area. Though the restaurant has close to 200 Yelp reviews with 4.5 stars, it's still a ""hidden spot."" Not many people know about this restaurant simply because Chinatown has a ton of great KBBQ restaurants. It has a relatively quiet atmosphere. Unlike many other KBBQ restaurants with loud music and crowed set-ups, Moo Woo has less noise and uncongested table set-up. Is it because not many people know about the restaurant? Maybe. Even then, this is a more family friendly KBBQ spot than most. 

The service was great. The servers were friendly and helpful. One of the servers brought wrong dishes to our table, but he realized it and quickly took them back. He seemed new. No biggie. We did not have to cook ourselves because the server grilled the entire combo throughout the meal. In terms of service, no complains. 

Now, the price and food... the meat quality is not much better than AYCE KBBQ places. Some were too fatty... some were too dry... the rib-eye steak was cut wayyy to thin to be grilled... (anything less than medium-well is almost impossible) For the combo that serves 3-4 people, it was close to $90. The price would have been reasonable if the food quality backed it up. **The quality is NOT bad. It's just not as good as it should be. Better quality or price would have changed the entire experience. 

Overall, Moo Woo was not bad. Nothing exceptional but nothing too disappointing either. It is a kids-friendly restsurant. If you want to have a family KBBQ dinner with kids, this is the right spot.",vsZy481c3AVrl1ht-qwMuA,0,0,3,wRjnnaimGeFMxZ4T9PH8FA

A great addition in an area that has been gaining a variety of delicious restaurants. Moo Woo is not an AYCE BBQ joint but they have combos in various sizes depending how large your party is and the option of adding more items to your meal. The quality of the meat is really good and notably I enjoyed their Banchan(side dishes). I recommend the melted cheese corn, this was one of our favorites of the evening and the kimchi was fresh and well seasoned with a good amount of heat.

The staff is friendly and they actually assist in helping you grill the meats in a timely manner while having a pleasant conversation with you. I thought I would be hungry after my meal but I was really satisfied with the food and was full.

Pros:
The place looks great, very modern and nice. I love that they have big screen TVs that are easily viewable from anywhere.

The staff were very attentive and pleasant. Best service I've ever had at a Korean BBQ, or even most restaurants.

The meat that I had was good quality. Servings were of good size for solo or two, though for a party of three or more, you'll definitely want more.

Lots of complimentary small side dishes.

Good to finally have one in the Centennial Area.

Cons:

Holy schneikies its pricey! I ordered only two meat dishes with water and it was $48 (Marinated beef and unmarinated pork belly). That's absurdly expensive for Korean BBQ and will, unfortunately, keep me from coming back unless the prices go down.

The staff cook the meat for you. Definitely a sign of very good service, however, at least for me, it takes away from the experience to not cook it myself.

No smaller or half orders if you want to mix and match more.",v0QQFY3i8IkCMHtGik4rTw,3,1,3,hxf_CoAgEPaeMzlTn3LttQ
4054602,2017-01-18,22,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Centennial is coming up!!

Soon, there will be no reason to ever leave the Centennial area.  Moo Woo Korean BBQ is the first KBBQ that I know of in the area.  The good news...we no longer have to drive 25 minutes to Chinatown to get our KBBQ cravings taken care of.  

Moo Woo KBBQ is new and right now, it's still almost a secret.  I drive by this location at least once a week and rarely do I see tons of cars outside or lines of people waiting.  This place just doesn't get enough hype or people out here just don't do KBBQ.  Regardless, they are missing out because Moo Woo is pretty damn good.  

Here's a quick menu breakdown:
Moo Combo (All Pork) - Small $45 (2-3 people) / Large $75 (3-4 people)
Woo Combo (All Beef) - Small $53 (2-3 people) / Large $85 (3-4 people)  
Moo Woo Combo (Pork & Beef) - $140 (4-5 people)

All combos come with an App, a salad, steamed egg, choice of stew (tofu, Kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese.  You can also order your meats a la carte.  Just keep in mind that it will cost about the same as a combo since it's a two item minimum.  Chicken and fish is also on the menu in case you're wondering. 

I'm not a huge pork lover, bored of chicken, and didn't come here for fish.  So, we ended up getting the Woo Combo. You're given the option to cook the meats yourself or have one of the servers do it.  I'm all about relaxing and our server ended up doing all the work.  If I had to rank my favorites in order, it would be the Bulgogi, seasoned beef, and Kalbi. All were cooked to perfection and had that taste of quality beef.  The only disappointment for me was the size of their corn cheese and steamed egg.  This came with our combo and is only enough to serve one person.  But it's really no big deal since we came for the meat, not the sides.  Overall, I recommend this restaurant if you're in the area and in need of some good KBBQ.  The quality is as good as Chinatown's minus the drive and long wait times.

4447971,2017-03-24,7,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Moo Woo may be my new favorite Korean BBQ spot. Note: Not AYCE.

The Woo Combo AKA red meat lovers galore is my personal favorite and my recommendation:

** $56 for an order to feed 2 - 3 people 
** $89 for an order to feed 3 - 4 people

Servings of:
- Chadol (Thinly sliced brisket)
- Kalbi (LA style short rib)
- Bulgogi (Marinated beef)
- Jumulleok (Precut lightly seasoned pieces of steak)
- Seng Dung Shim (Prime ribeye steak)

The combo of course comes with salad, a variety of side dishes (love the fish cakes here and the kimchi is always ripe and tasty), as well as steamed egg, corn cheese, and soup (bean paste, tofu, or kimchi). 

Food: 
- Quality meat! Their meat is also never frozen, always refrigerated and fresh 
- Marinades are delicious. The best marinaded Kalbi and Bulgogi I've tasted in a Las Vegas Korean restaurant 
- Brisket is incredibly tender and juicy
- The Ribeye Steak literally melts in your mouth. Recommend eating medium rare - medium 
- Kimchi Jun (Korean pancake - not part of the combo) is simple yet delectable 

Service: 
- Every server is friendly and attentive! We've had multiple servers come by our table both times I've been to Moo Woo to offer additional side dishes, water, check if we're enjoying our meal, and also assist with grilling. Super friendly and welcoming - excellent service all around! 

Ambiance: 
- Very open; great lighting and ventilation 
- Love the seating!! The bench style seating is incredibly roomy and makes a very comfortable dining experience. Usually Korean restaurants can be a bit crammed (seating and table size) and it's the complete opposite at Moo Woo 

Highly recommend Moo Woo!! I wish it was closer to where I live (it's so far north!) but it's definitely even worth the 30+ minute drive.",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,16,10,5,ERBdsK_K1P-sBrAoZd3zng

It is NOT AYCE. However, I thought that the Moo and Woo combos were reasonably priced at around $60 and they are appropriate portions (they feed 2-3, and we were a group of 3). Along with sides, you also receive a steamed egg, cheese corn, and your choice of available soups. 

They do the cooking for you, which is a nice change of pace. However, I wish that they had disclosed this information when we informed them that it was our first time eating at Moo Woo. It would have made things slightly less awkward and confusing. 

If you like to eat a lot, if you prefer and can handle AYCE better because you like the wide range of things you can order, this is probably not the place for you. It's more along the lines of..a casual date with a friend...a romantic outing with your hubby...or maybe you just wanted Korean BBQ but you're so lazy that you don't want to cook it yourself. 

I was pretty impressed to eat here. For a location on the NW side, Moo Woo would probably be getting a 5 star rating if it weren't for the many neighbor's meats I saw that the attending cook let overcook on accident.

We've tried the Moo Combo, Woo Combo, and the Moo Woo Combo. All three comes with brisket, rib eye, banchan, steamed egg, corn cheese, and your choice of soup (sundobu, kimchi stew or bean paste stew). Moo Combo also has pork Belly, pork collar butt, sweet chicken or spicy chicken. Woo Combo has premium cut beef, marinated beef, and short rib. Moo Woo Combo has pork Belly, short Rib, spicy pork, pork jowl, sweet chicken, and butter garlic shrimp. The Moo Combo and the Woo Combo serves 2-3 people. Moo Woo serves 4-5 people.

Their bibimbap is good. Everything we've tried so far has been good and I simply cannot find any flaws other than the somewhat grumpy guy that greets you and takes you to your table - like a host but he also buses tables. He's got RBF perfected that he makes me look like a very cheerful person. However, they have this super awesome server and I can never remember his name but he remembers us. He knows the drill: that we come here post workout, and that I don't eat animal fat so he cuts it off the meat so I don't have to. Good memory, friendly, and attentive. He's a real asset to Moo Woo.

They change out the grill often unlike some places that wait until the meat gets caked onto the grill. So, if ever you're in this area, be sure to check this place out!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,11,7,5,7v-kjXkOg3a_5JZbJ2kn3Q

5398762,2017-04-09,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"Last night I ventured to our first (in centennial hills) korean bbq restaurant. We arrived a little after 5 so the place was about half full. We were seated shortly after we walked in. We ordered the Moo combo which included pork belly, pork butt, brisket, ribeye, and sweet chicken. We also ordered steamed rice for 4. The ban chan were all freshly prepared and the vegetables maintained their crunchy texture. The bean curd soup didn't smell that great but packed in the flavor regardless. The first grill on the table was like a mesh grill. When we were left with our plater of raw meats we started piling them on the grill, only to have a random waitress come over and pull off the beef brisket slices and seemingly admonish us for putting them on the grill. We couldn't understand a word she said but I got the point that we weren't supposed to be placing meat on the grill. Shortly after she left I saw her do the same thing to another table nearby as they had filled their mesh grill with meat. Another male server came by and explained the smaller pieces of meat go on a different grill that they change out after the ribeye is cooked on the mesh grill. Anyway, the meats were all delicious, my favorite being the brisket and pork belly. The sauces were refilled upon request and we all got face masks and wipes with my yelp checkin. I noticed they have lunch specials so we will definitely be back to try them. They even have ramen! 

My only suggestion is that they give you instructions on the platter or raw meat prior to leaving it on your table and walking away.",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,2,1,5,Zn41J8h_kH5aKXtT8XC6cg

We can in on a Friday night and there was only one other party in the restaurant. My party was seated at a table that was preset with food... We ask the server why there was food already at our table and if they had changed their surfing methods... we were told it was for another party who either left or hadn't shown up for dinner. 

We all found this to be odd to say the least.  Having asked the server to bring us fresh dishes kimchi and salad. The waiter told us sitting there on the table for no more than 25 minutes and was unwilling to provide us with fresh salads.

I'm fairly certain there's some health code violations with that tight there...

I'm sorry but think what you may of me but I don't go to a nice restaurant to pay money for someone else's leftovers.

We walked out when the waiter decided to argue with us rather than bring us fresh food.

With that kind of care and concern for their customers and the food they serve I would be very cautious about eating here as someone's going to get very sick.

The owner was contacted about our experience and found no issue with the service we received.

As far as the surroundings and the atmosphere- I was very much jealous of the table next to us! They were having the best time. Sake bombs and some cheering. I was with the kids so I couldn't partake or else I would have reached over for a pour!

Located in the very busy Centennial area that's made up of mostly chain restaurants, Moo Woo is a spacious and bright alternative and is perhaps the only KBBQ restaurant for miles.

Service started off slowly since we were sat immediately and then left alone for longer than I'm comfortable with; I actually got to the point where I wanted to walk out.  However, after we were noticed, things improved.  Our waiter took our order and the food started arriving.  We went with the small Moo Woo order because we like beef more than pork.  It comes with prime brisket, bulgogi, rib-eye steak or boneless short rib, Joo Mul Luk (premium cut beef seasoned with garlic, pepper, and salt) and kalbi.  We chose the rib-eye steak, which was the first cut on the bbq.  Banchan dishes were accompanied by house salad (very tasty dressing), steamed egg, your choice of stew (soon tofu, kimchi, or bean paste), and corn cheese.  Unfortunately, I never got our waiter's name, but he was very attentive and checked on us often.  My favorites were the seasoned beef (Joo Mul Luk) and the kalbi.

I legit have nothing bad to say about this place.",xCnx4jhceUdmzPummoBwrw,0,0,5,LgTSjLxuSrW6E7WIk8Izlw

Service was fantastic. Our server/cook explained what everything was and was eager to answer any questions we had about the food. 

Dinner itself was awesome.  We got the Woo dinner for two and it was a perfect amount of food.  We were asked how we would like our rib eye cooked and it done to our request which was great!  

We also had a choice of soups and we got the Tofu soup per the recommendation of our server. The broth was so flavorful and we were so happy to try a new soup.  Kudos for the recommendation - we'd definitely order it again. 

All in all, Moo Woo's has a lot of good things going for it and I would highly recommend checking the place out - Especially if you live in the Northwest side of town.",minw2oFzGzHmtUUe4EdB5A,1,0,5,aT-A52qKhUEWUX20r4V2vQ

The food is great quality, and the flavors are amazing. The small plates of kimchi and pickled vegetables are made in house, they are fresh and VERY TASTY.

We ordered the Woo Combo, it was filling and left us satisfied..

We will be coming back for MORE!",nVNG_EGrrES_KaZx3USxZg,1,0,5,bZa0x9LzC1erS7WIVbLEPA

5826769,2017-09-21,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,"I have been looking forward to try this place because of their great reviews and when I finally did, it was a big disappointment.  Their combo meal prices were a little expensive and the quality of meat they served were mediocre.  We tried the Moo Woo combo; the ribeye was small and chewy (felt like I was eating a jerky), brisket was bland same as the pork neck.  Finally the chicken that tasted like a glazed BBQ flavor.  The banchan dishes tasted weird.  The only thing my family liked was the soup, I forgot which one it was but we tried the most popular one. Sadly to say I will not be back and cannot recommend this resto to friends and family.  Try Hobak instead!!!",vtAoWCbViQnWU1muHrgt4A,2,0,1,4Xx-wFgwZ9rurAE9cFScGQ

My party of 4 tried the combo that served 3-4 people and we were disappointed. Portions were small, meat was well flavored but not enough for all of us. We each left hungry. And it was weird that the 'server' wouldn't let us cook our own meat. For $3 more at Hwaro and a 10 minute further drive, I can eat all the meat, desserts, appetizers, and rice I want.",WzgAFIonfQZpArNuqrHYkQ,2,0,2,c7RNLFbmLvRfOd0G7SsuBw

Next thing you know we're inside eating. We ordered a Moo Woo Combo and a bibimbap to share with 4 people. And it def could feed more than 4 that's for sure. I enjoyed the part where our server actually cooked everything for us! That's a plus! We were all ready to cook our own food, but that was a great surprise. Also, we checked in & got free facial masks + a water bottle thing that looked like it was for soju.

5953758,2017-05-06,0,dWw7M_JsAVUprR86--89ZA,I can't say that this is one of my favorite nor I dislike it either. It is one of those restaurant that we tried and it was ok but won't come back because there was nothing special about it. I love Korean BBQ don't get me wrong but we told the server that it was our first time and did not seem to personalize our experience nor offered anything in menu to try or anything that stands out in the menu or restaurant's famous dishes etc.,4YG3CmhBFYajaxa1L2mIRA,0,0,4,z17dybVB-kC-kb7cMmqHJA
