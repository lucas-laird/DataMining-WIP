Do yourself a favor and do not order from Sorrento's. EVEN IF ITS LATE NITE and all the good places are closed!!! Its that bad, and they don't care.

We asked for white sauce on the pizza since my boyfriend and I have hard time to digest tomato sauce and we actually got tomato sauce instead of the white one. Also, the cheese is almost absent and tastes absolutely nothing. The crust remind me a piece of cardboard box. Really not worth the price and the delivery fees. So I suggest you to avoid the pizza from here.

UPDATE 10/31/2015: The chicken wings are as bad as the pizza, no flavor. My boyfriend asked for mild spicy and he got plain wings. Apparently this place was good a few years ago, we wonder what's happened. Very disappointing, we won't let them a chance anymore.",PL6EwT55wEMJ9yQsLQptUQ,3,0,1,TsrIhtYe6viy0kC0R65l1A

436488,2014-06-14,0,dFmaYj3_cZpmEaL4WSOkPg,"I will never, ever order from here again.

I picked this place based on the Yelp reviews through EAT24.  I ordered the large pizza with fingers, an appetizer sampler, and fries.  I always complete my online purchases through Google Wallet and do so with this.  Order submitted at 8:11pm, 45 minute delivery time.

I get a call at 8:40pm from a guy saying he needs my credit card number, I explain I already paid through Google Wallet when persists that he still needs my number.  I give him the number and again state I've already paid when he says ok, I just needed the number, they should have the food out in 40 minutes.  40 minutes?  But I ordered half an hour ago?!  Oh you did?  Food is almost done the driver will be out soon.

I contact EAT24 because the card thing doesn't sit well with me.  After 20 minutes of negotiating with this place they realize I was being charged AGAIN even after I made sure and said I already paid.  The lady at EAT24 tells me they are refunding me and just confirmed it will be another 45 minutes.

Ten minutes later, I get another call this time telling me they're out of fingers but instead of five fingers they'll give me 12 wings for the inconvenience.  Here's the thing, the deal comes with either five fingers or 12 wings, they're not doing any favors.  When I start to say I don't even want this anymore because of the extreme lateness, being double charged, and them not having fingers, she says she'll throw in a two liter for the inconvenience.  Whatever.

Food gets here: pizza is cold, chicken is ridiculously dry, appetizers are burnt (all except for the mushrooms which I can't eat).  The only thing that tastes good, not just barely edible, are the fries.  I waited two hours for some of the worst delivery in my life.  Fantastic.",sJ7MCqdDuk_kW6QAcYC1Dw,4,0,1,y_Vu62ZvkeXNKHoUPg8Pmg

If you are looking for halal pizza, ignore this review. If you are not looking for halal pizza, I would ignore all the other reviews, and don't expect any pork on your pizza.

When I learned there would be no pork, I considered just walking out without the pizza, and writing off the $12.

We work right nearby and at first they said they would give us 20% off then they said that was too much and they will only do 10% off.  Now, when I ask for my 10% discount, they try and tack on the difference somewhere else- ""credit card usage fee"".  Really shady.

I read the reviews & as soon as I placed the order I called to make sure the pizza would be delivered within the hour, & the person who answered the phone said it would be at least an hour because the driver wasn't there. So I looked for other places that were open, and decided to cancel & reorder from Napoli's but when I called to cancel, the same person said they didn't know how to refund, and they would make sure the pizza would be delivered in 30 mins. It's 12:54 when we got it, we ordered at 12:15. So a little over but better than I expected. The two stars is for the speed of delivery & the pizza was good.

2402299,2018-01-16,0,dFmaYj3_cZpmEaL4WSOkPg,Hands down worst delivery I've ever had through the Eat24 service. I ordered at about 2 in the morning they're one of the only pizza places open. I ordered a chicken Philly and mozzarella sticks. In the special instructions I told them to call me when they arrived at the door. I received a call from the delivery driver saying he couldn't find the building asking me what number it was. I'm not sure what my building number is who really is. So I gave him instructions on where to find the house at which point he was very rude and told me to come out into the street to get my food. I told him to do his job and go back to the gate and look at the map to find my apartment just like every other delivery driver has in the past. I had given him clear instructions on how to find the place and he had my address. Finally I received my food and I opened the bag to find no napkins or condiments. No marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks or Ranch. No ketchup for my fries. Cold soggy chicken Philly. And cold hard mozzarella sticks. Needless to say after this experience I won't be ordering from this place again.,qtkvZU9PW-xTgb8JpEbAXw,0,0,1,W_LHpD7kJtkO5oy48uAWXg

Sorrento's pizza and its owners are crooks who tried to scam me by voiding my order, but not refunding the money I was charged.  So now instead of them just simply refunding my money, I have to file a dispute with my bank. Over $13...

On April 23rd I ordered a cheese pizza and wings for pickup. This place is about a half of mile away and I was told my order would be ready for pickup in a half hour. So I show up after a half hour and I was told that my order wasn't ready because they didn't have any cheese. They said the cheese was ""on its way"" and they would deliver my order free of charge for the inconvenience. 

So about another 30 minutes passes, it's getting late and my kids are getting hungry. I call and I was told the cheese still hadn't arrived but it would be there shortly and my order would be ready in another 30 mins. I waited an hour and called back and was told that it was almost done. At this point, I had already ordered pizza from somewhere else and wanted to just cancel my order. 

About 30 mins after that, 2 and a half hours after I initially placed my order, I hear a knock at the door. We're already sitting down eating pizza from the second the place I ordered from. I open the door and the general manager of Sorrento's pizza is at the door with the order I canceled. 2 and a half hours after I placed the order. He said he wanted to personally deliver the pizza. I told him I had already gotten pizza and I just wanted my money back. He offered to give me 50% off which I declined and told him I just wanted my money back. 

I placed the order on April 23rd. My bank processes refunds fairly quickly so after a few days of not seeing the charge reversed, I went in to Sorrento's to see what was going on. The general manager assured me that he voided the order and even printed out a receipt stating the order was voided and the hold up must be on my bank's side. 

So it is now May 4th and the charge still hadn't been reversed. I called my bank and was told that Sorrento's pizza had just voided the order, but never issued a refund and I would have to file a dispute which would take another 2 weeks. All over $13.
