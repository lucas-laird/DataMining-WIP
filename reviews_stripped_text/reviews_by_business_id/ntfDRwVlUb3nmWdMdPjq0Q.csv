89516,2012-04-12,0,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"This review is based on the only 2 items I've tried from this restaurant.

My husband and I got a take out order of Char Siu Bao (bbq pork bun) and vegetable fried rice. The Char Siu Bao was very very good! I haven't got such a good one in a very long time! The bun was soft and warm. The char siu (bbq pork) and the sauce inside was good. It was as good as what I used to have when I was a child in HK. 

The fried rice was good too. It didn't come out greasy at the bottom, and the rice was in good texture. It was jasmine rice too. The rice wasn't too hard or too soft. It's way better than what I get in Honolulu. I normally don't eat much fried rice (because most places don't make a good one), but this fried rice was just so good that I can break my rule and eat more fried rice. 

I know the price is expensive at this place if you compare to the price in China Town. But good Chinese food does worth more money. Not all Chinese food has to be cheap and not all cheap Chinese food can give you satisfaction. I don't mind to pay the price at Grand Wok to have such a good Char Siu Bao and fried rice. I am not eating there every day anyway. I only do it once in a while and it's worth to pay more to have a higher quality of taste.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,1,0,4,fJppu6Mfr_t1RenL-feutA

Service: Well, I ordered hot green tea, pot stickers for appetizer, and a roll. Waited for quite a while, the roll came first. I had to remind about the pot stickers. Seriously, serving an appetizer way after the main dish? What about the tea? The tea never came at all.

There we found The Grand Wok & Sushi Bar.

What we like about it is a somewhat ""fine dining"" feel yet has a casual vibe. 

We ordered sushi...of course. Great sushi! Fresh-which is good! :) I love that they just dont offer Japanese food. They offer Chinese, Korean, Indonesian...etc fare.

I also recommend the Honey Glazed BBQ Pork-Yum! 

1 thing that really bothered me and the bf (days after we dined here)...Sake. So we ordered sparkling sake (Hou Hou Shu) really refreshing and ultimately became my fave. For about 300ML, it was $30 a bottle. We just decided to splurge since it was our anniversary and all. A few weeks after, we went to True Sake in SF, CA...found the same bottle, same size for $14. dannnnnnnm.

493611,2010-09-30,0,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"My boy-friend and I were craving sushi but the Vegas Strip prices almost made us loose our appetite. So we turned to yelp for help. Sushi buffets seemed more reasonably priced, but they were a part of larger buffets, which had all sorts of food in one. This made me unsure about the quality (I am not the shampoo + conditioner = two-in-one kind of person). 

We came across Grand Wok reviews. The menu offered the desired sushi and the prices were not frighting. We decided to walk to MGM and check it out. We were ready to go elsewhere if the place looked like an Americanized Chinese fast food joint. To our surprise the place looked very cute, cozy and refreshing with the bamboo columns and riverside stones wall. 

The sushi turned out to be delicious with a 5 star presentation. We ordered three rolls to share for the appetizer and I was full before our entrées were presented. Once I tried my coconut curry chicken, I couldn't stop and almost finished the dish. Poor me:)

Most importantly, the service was outstanding. Our server was very intuitive and when my all-American boy-friend ordered some interesting sounding dish, she took time to explain what it was and to make sure that it was exactly what he wanted. Turned out that my sea-food lover ordered an oatmeal soup. She recommended another dish, which he ended up ordering. If not for the attentive waitress, he would have not enjoyed his meal whatsoever. I wish I could remember the name of that nice Asian lady. She was an incredible, positive, fast and smiley server. 
 
Three sushi rolls and two entries came up to about  $80.  Next time we are in Grand Wok I will skip the entrée and just have sushi. I was feeling a little too full for a late dinner and got sleepy, which you can't do when you are in Vegas:)",mQJ9Y1fG0kICoUjhyb3o-w,1,0,4,tW4pmSclNx1yFhhXD0pFgQ

One night, we were craving Asian and there was a Japanese restaurant in the Tropicana, but there was NO one in there.  We ran away as fast as we could.  NOT a good sign when a place looks empty.  Because I saw this place so much, I opted to go here.

We were promptly seated at the bar and I got a rainbow roll that was delicious.  It was nice to sit at the bar and watch everything get made.

505860,2012-09-27,0,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"This restaurant is generally good service and flavorful food.  At times, the service can be a little slow or mechanical.

The last meal that I had was flavorful and delicious.  We started off with the shrimp dumplings with bamboo shoots.  The dumplings were very pretty to look at.  There were four dumplings to the order and the plate was oversized, making them seem smaller.  They were served hot and were tasty.  The waitress commented that she liked the hot sauce so she brought it out and put it near my non gringo friend.  I moved it over to my side, and true to form, it was delicious.  My friend burnt his tongue on the spiciness of it when he tried a little.

We also had the shrimp fried rice and the beef with broccoli.  The fried rice was average, and the shrimp were plump and moist.  A little more ginger would have gone a long way.  The garlic shaved over the top was delicious. And appreciated.

The beef was tender.  Melt in your mouth tender.  I don't know how they make meat that tender, but a friend of mine said it was corn starch.  If it is, you may want to invest in corn starch futures when I start cooking.  The sauce was comforting.  It imparting a delicious flavor to it.  Not too salty.  The broccoli was Chinese broccoli.  It was leafier than what I have typically had, but it was flavorful, and I am sure it was better than regular American broccoli.

Did I mention that I ordered dessert?  We had the sorbet trio.  A scoop of coconut sorbet, a scoop of raspberrysorbet, and a scoop of mango sorbet.  Or at least on the night I went.  The coconut tasted like coconut, the mango tasted like mango (and had a piece or two of dried mango and some pineapple on top), and the snozzberry definitely did not taste like snozzberry.  Actually, the raspberry sorbet had a very flowery flavor.  It tasted like perfume.  Or Bigelow tea.  So, I asked our server, ""Hey.  What makes this taste like perfume?  Or Bigelow tea?""  She responded that the chef used rose water when making the raspberry sorbet.  It immediately became more palatable to me.

It's really not bad here, but nothing really to write home about.  It's a combination Chinese and Japanese restaurant which means they serve everything from combination fried rice and wonton soup to premium sushi cut rolls and sake.

Hey, I know its Vegas so I expect things to be on the steep side.  But feeling like you have been completely ripped off is another thing.  The Famed Red Dragon roll?  A smallish $17.50 cut roll with stale, cold and rubbery shrimp tempura in it (I didn't even know shrimp tempura could BE rubbery).  A hand roll is $11.50.   A 10oz sake is $18.00 and they were short pouring.  No wonder the waitress was pouring our drinks for us!  4 small cups per bottle- seriously about half of what the bottle holds.

Our waitress, while friendly, misunderstood our order several times.  She also was quite condescending, pointing out the standard tourist fare when we are really into experimenting with new foods.

The staff here is jaded, and clearly know their food and service sucks.  They act like they are used to complaints on a regular basis and just don't give a sh*t because they know you are never coming back, but they also know it's Vegas and there are fresh suckers every day.  Why should they care?

I'm actually being really nice here, because I am trying to be fair, but my wife and I were quite upset after leaving here, feeling like we were treated like crap and robbed.  Who wants to eat someplace like that?  The other reviewers mention that you can go to Panda Express and get better food- I would say that Panda Express ROCKS in comparison.

I wanted so badly to have a serious chat with the manager at the end of my meal but didn't see the point like it would change anything.. so here's the scoop on this waaaay overpriced dollar strip mall Chinese food spot. I had the black pepper beef, my girl had the pad thai, we both had a diet coke... total bill including tip.. $80. The black pepper beef tasted good, but there were huge (steak fry size) chunks of chewy beef and ton of pea pods. The beef was tough and chewy too bite through, and no knife was provided to cut it... so im sitting there chewing like cow to eat this huge hunk of meat that I can't bite through. Portion size wouldn't fill a panda express two item combo Styrofoam box but the price was large enough to buy 4 of them. Her pad thai was soggy and flavorless. I live minutes from north Hollywood where there's a Thai restaurant ever half mile. The waiter did do a good job and kept the drinks full and was nice, not his fault the food was crap. Oh, and in this fancy upscale overpriced restaurant the lady sitting next to us was straight blowing her nose like she had the flu every 15 minutes.. Disgusting, and not very classy.
IN MY OPINION: A complete waste of money! Do not go here! Spend half as much for twice as much food at pf changs or something.. grand wok is hella wacked!",DleDaJwKb777FF9SFNCf8Q,3,0,1,HK6n6gWmjQ-20pP2qRRqww

* definitely more on the pricey side though..

- Philadelphia roll: good amount of salmon and avocado, but too little cream cheese. The amount of cream cheese in each piece didn't even make a difference to the taste of the roll.
- Nevada roll: shrimp, avocado, and cucumber. Skimpy on the filling, not much shrimp on the inside and it seemed like it was more rice.

- Fish, chicken, egg fried rice: the dominant flavor was egg, this dish was okay-tasting as well. I feel like I could make it at home; I liked this rice a little more than the sushi.

I even saw some older Asian guy eating a boatload of noodles in this small glass concealed room in the middle of the restaurant as though he were some type of exhibit.

MGM needs to re-evaluate of they want this place tied to their name or just trim it to what they're good at -- sushi; lose the wok.

I actually tried this place twice, both at corporate events where a few of set aside some time to have some private dinner.  BOTH experiences were practically identical.

Technically it's edible, though if someone is going to charge a minimum of $22-$30 per dish, I'd expect you could do better than Panda Express (I don't even mind PE sometimes, so that should tell you how sad this experience was).

- Wok Seared Pork w/ Udon Noodles & XO Sauce: $22 - Overcooked chewy/slimy pork (""seared"" is laughable. ""Boiled"" is more accurate), overcooked noodles, bland sauce.
- Kung Pao: $23 - Overcooked chicken, sauce was below average. Even the rice was dry and thin.

1920341,2011-06-14,0,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"Las Vegas has some great dining, and it just keeps getting better. No matter where you stay, you are surrounded by the next venture created by that celebrity chef that you might see on TV, or by some kitschy type of eatery that lures you in, and in some cases, will disappoint you.

I'm staying at the MGM Grand, and I'm surrounded by some FANTASTIC restaurants, Craftsteak by Tom Collichio, Joel Robuchon, and Seablue by Michael Mina. Sometimes, some of the OTHER great restaurants are often overshadowed by the great names. Last night I decided to take a chance on something new, and less ""popular"" if you will. I went to The Grand Wok & Sushi Bar.

Outside, all you see is giant glass windows with a lot of tables. The inside has a really cool, contemporary design, paired with a great lively energy. This place is energetic, yet not too loud, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. The servers are very attentive, friendly, and fast. I mean really really fast.

Our menu consisted of miso soup to start, followed by a red dragon roll and beef lo mein, and finished with the honey walnut shrimp. Of course we had an ice cold Kirin to wash it all down.

Their miso soup was really good. In fact, it actually stood out to me from the rest that I've had. Usually, miso soup is just a salty broth with some tofu and seaweed. You know, that one thing that helps curb your monstrous appetite during that lengthy period from when you order the sushi until it hits your table. The miso at Grand Wok was really hearty, and lacked the massive salt infusion. The seaweed was of the highest quality, not paper thin, but had good substance.

The red dragon roll was insanely good. I mean, how can you go wrong with tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, spicy masago, and eel sauce? The texture and the finish of eel sauce is what made this sushi amazing.

The beef lo mein was another winner. Perfectly cooked spaghetti noodles with just the right balance of crisp veggies. The beef itself was a bit thicker than you would usually get for this dish. I liked very much.

And now onto the winner of the evening, the honey walnut shrimp. OMG, this is a great dish. It's sweet, sour, crispy, and soft. This dish makes you want to abandon everything you're doing and become a Chinese chef so you can spend years on end perfecting this dish as they have. The shrimp were huge, and evenly coated with the honey sauce, served over a bed of microgreens and crisp, sweet roasted walnuts. When this hit my tongue, I just wanted to shove the entire dish in my mouth and chew for hours. Amazing!

My conclusion of the evening is that sometimes when you're in Las Vegas, you may just have to take that chance and choose one of the less-popular joints. You never know, you may stumble upon that hidden gem.

I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express = More Authentic Experience.

For a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant (always a big negative in my book). Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes.

I ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead.

In lieu of another buffet or heavy American meal, our group of 14 agreed to meet at Grand Wok for a family-style Chinese meal.  Our dishes included:  Yang-Chow Fried Rice, XO Style Fried Udon and Beef, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Tom YUm Noodle Soup, Fried Spicy Calamari, Hainan Chicken Rice, and Sauteed Green Beans.  The food was a solid 4 stars all around!
The only bad thing was that each item was so small, that even doubling up on each dish only alloted for about a sampler taste for each person.  At about $18 avg. per dish, this quickly added up for a not very filling meal.  This was okay with us since we had a buffet planned for dinner, but it's definitely something to consider if you are going ""family-style"".  In all my past experiences at the Grand Wok in smaller groups, everyone ordered their own dish + some appetizers.  
Service was good.  We were seated immediately and attended to at all times.  It's a mainstay at The MGM that I can appreciate!",CjnD1j3fV5lPTyGMY-WWeA,0,0,4,GEwMF2XJ4qiX2iC0ZokDcQ

Cons: Food, Price
Overall: Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express.

My fam and I were craving some Chinese food so we went here at the recommendation of my cousin who frequents Vegas and says this is the closest Chinese restaurant and pretty good (we were staying at the MGM anyway)

Wow, was he wrong! First off, I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on that - which dominates a lot of their menu items.  But here's what we did have

Mongolian Beef - This was the only good dish I sampled. However, this is NOT mongolian beef. They're like mini steaks. It tasted good, like duck actually, and it was very tender. However, it was nowhere near Mongolian beef. I did like the sauce that came with it since it was infused with a slight hint of habanero. But this was not Mongolian beef in the slightest.

""Chow fun"" (Beef rice noodle with soy sauce) - they weren't kidding. It was just that. No other real flavorings, just soy sauce. No attempt at making a delicious sauce. Just take some kikoman or something and pour it over noodles, fry it for 5 seconds and serve. Wow. bad.

Combination Fried Rice - What the hell is with all these beans? There was like no meat in my dish. Who does this? Really????

Honey Walnut Shrimp - My cousin's favorite dish. He enjoyed it. I enjoyed the walnut.

Additionally - no free refills on soda. I mean, I'd expect that at a Pho restaurant, but not a crappy expensive Chinese restaurant. (I guess it's not really Chinese, but ""Asian Fusion"" - Asian fused with crap)

For those that enjoy Chinese food, you know it's about the large, family-sized portions. I didn't expect much of that here, but for the price they make you pay, they surely don't delivery in either quality or quantity.

Overall this place sucks, and it left such a bad memory in my head, that I went to Panda Express the morning after and had a much more satisfying meal for less. Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express.",ZABoX8_9iMuLa3OAl2Pt8Q,0,0,1,79deCGNumTlmj5EGqrIAdQ

Sushi wasn't bad; fish was fresh enough but absolutely nothing special (""meh"" came to mind), especially for how much it costs and how much you get. Appetizer was extremely small. Mainly what turned me off to this place was that the service was terrible. The server hardly spoke to us, did not bring us another pair of chopsticks after nicely requesting them several times, and when we asked for the check, we were brought an empty book. This all could have been smoothed over with an apology, but alas, there was none.

I was in a party of 4 and we all split the Orange Chicken, Pad Thai, and Kung Pao Chicken. (Chicken dishes came with rice in a very small bowl.)

For the price of each (and I know it's Vegas) but I do feel that they were over priced for the portions you get. It was quite expensive for a little bit of food. I was still hungry when I left.

Orange Chicken: Delicious!!!! It's hard to go wrong with this dish. It's one of my favorites. The sauce was gingery with great orange flavor with real orange peel and the chicken was perfectly crispy and wonderful.

Kung Pao: Great dish. Had a kick of spice to it and a lot of peanuts. Very good.

Pad Thai: It was alright. I know that Pad Thai has egg in it, but this dish was just extra eggy and lacking in other flavors and texture of classic Pad Thai. I wouldn't get this one again.

After reading some of the other reviews it seems the reasons behind my bad visit were shared by others. So it's clear it is just the way the restaurant is vs a one off situation.  What's a little more disheartening is that each negative  situation was responded to by some sort of management with the implication that it would be addressed and corrected, clearly a cookie cutter reply. 

We were greeted by the hostess and seated right away, soon after we were greeted by our server. She took our order which consisted of 2 appetizers (calamari & pot stickers), a California roll and Tom Yum soup. After 35 minutes our appetizers and california rolls finally arrive, about 10 minutes later i ask where the soup is (mind you it's been 45 minutes since we actually ordered it)..yes irritated I cancel the soup order and ask for the check. What bothers me the most is I asked to speak to a manager and one never came. The server gave us the check, apologized since she could clearly sense my annoyance. 

I understand restaurants can run behind but not once we're we even told, explained to or even addressed with the fact the kitchen may have been running behind and we had clearly been waiting over half and hour for appetizers. Not that I would have believed it anyways considering the table that was next to us and seated after us, was half way through their meals by the time I cancelled the rest of our food. 

Honestly, the food (what we actually got) was pretty good. The calamari was very tasty. 

As far as ambiance it does remind me of an Asian inspired cafe. I do feel the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. Shibuya was my absolute go to for but sadly it closed so I think we will wait for Morimoto to open if we want Asian food at MGM.",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,5,2,1,nnoRK7w_-O3C76KVVjrugw

He kept our waters filled, brought our food out less than ten minutes after we ordered, and overall just took this place from a slightly pricey Asian restaurant to a place I really want to come back to.

I ordered the pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup because it sounded comforting and easy on the stomach.

The best part were the wontons, with half pieces of shrimp in them.  They were super plump with a good firmness.  The broth was a little bland, but they offered chili garlic sauce on the side.  I added some as well as some soy sauce, which made it a lot more savory.  Still, a very simple broth though.

The boy ordered the Mandarin beef noodle soup, which was full of beef and delicous melt-in-your-mouth tendon attached.  It was so tender that it was almost like fat, but without the fat.  The broth was five-spice based but good, especially with the chili garlic sauce.  I secretly wished I had ordered it, and it caught the attention of our neighbors, who asked what it was.

2728847,2017-01-16,0,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"We came here on the first night we arrived at the MGM Grand for an extended weekend stay.  I was craving sushi so we decided to give The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar a try.

Service was good, and probably the only good thing about our experience here.   When they ask you if you want to eat at the sushi bar, don't expect to watch them make it for you.  We noticed that the refrigerator in front of our chairs simply had some ornamental items in it.   We decided to order potstickers and sushi.

Potstickers were ok, a little bland but the excellent chili sauce helped change that.

The sushi however was a different story.  All the rolls came out at once so there really isn't a point to the sushi bar, you'll be more comfortable sitting at a table.

We ordered:  1 order of unagi, a Las Vegas Roll, Red Dragon Roll and a Sea Dragon roll.
The unagi was decent, good flavor and cooked well.

The Las Vegas roll (deep-fried tuna, salmon, crab and yellowtail) was downright disgusting.  The 'deep fried tuna' tasted like day old overcooked microwaved chicken.    It made for a odd and unpleasant experience.  

The Red Dragon Roll (tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, spicy masago and eel sauce) was about the only roll we enjoyed.   The fish tasted good but the rice was the same strange tough consistency.  The roll, again, was loose and just fell apart.  The tempura on the shrimp was mushy, not crispy so I assume it had been sitting there before they made the roll.

The Sea Dragon roll (tempura Shrimp, eel, roasted garlic, spicy masago, and eel sauce) was not appetizing either.  Tempura shrimp was mushy and the roll had actual garlic cloves in it which I didn't think was a great idea since they were somewhat bitter.

We had a glass of plum wine and a tall Sapporo and the bill was north of $100.  

Moral of the story - there are plenty of good places to eat at the MGM Grand - ""The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar"" isn't one of them.",6i7XsIdjmExkLJJ8RggRyg,2,0,1,ato0Nr95YvmeXjRzn1ICnA

After a long afternoon walking the strip, bearing the July heat, Sarah E. and I decided on a clean and refreshing sushi dinner for the night, especially after doing well and walking away with a little extra cash from a fun run at Pai Gow Poker.

Sushi might not be the first thing to come to mind in the middle of the desert, but its Vegas.

We stepped into Grand Wok & Sushi Bar rather than seek out the better-rated Shibuya (also located somewhere in MGM). The place was busy with people, though being a Tuesday evening, it seemed like everything was winding down a little early.

The host was congenial, seating us at the [sushi] bar with a smile. While one member of the waitstaff brought by hot hand towels, our friendly waitress eagerly awaited our orders. 

First order of business, as ever; sake and beer.

Browsing the menu, we ordered the Sea Dragon, Negihama, and Aloha rolls [ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q?select=w-AVf1Ie6e7VzXxR1KQtzw ] to accompany our sake/beer/sake/beer. The sushi itself isn't particularly rave worthy, but its decent in quality and quantity. The Aloha roll (Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon - over spicy Tuna) satisfies, the Negihama (Yellowtail over scallion) is simple and clean, while the Sea Dragon dances on the tastebuds with both garlicky kick and sweet sauce.

On food alone, Grand Wok/Sushi is okay, but the treat of the evening was sitting at the bar and watching the mastery of sushi-preparer Yoshi [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q?select=lidb5EFyc-cEwfsK-kq-hw ]; we sat there, watching in admiration, as he prepared order after order of sushi and sashimi. At the end of the evening, as Yoshi was preparing and order of glistening, fatty toro, he noticed our awe (drooly want!) and treated us to a couple of melt-in-your-mouth slices.

Ending the evening on a high note and an unexpected morsel of fatty tuna goodness? Fourth star.

Friend: Can you tell me what's in the Singapore Curry Rice Noodle dish?
Server: Shwimp and Hahm.
Friend: Ham?
Server: Yes, Hahm.
Friend: I'm sorry, did you say Ham?
Server: Yes, Hahm.

Does the Singapore Curry Rice Noodle dish (which could be mistaken for a vegetarian item) have shrimp and Logan's Farm Honey Baked Ham? Or is it shrimp and pieces of Hormel cold cuts? Perhaps it's simply shrimp and pork, which doesn't sound quite so odd. In any case, we decided to steer clear of the ham and got some sushi and pad thai.

Our server was a sweet older Asian lady that made me enjoy my time there, but she was a bit hard to understand at times.

The steamed pork dumplings were soft and had a sweet flavor to it rather than savory. The Aloha roll was okay. The spicy tuna had a nice kick to it, but the quality of sushi was just okay. There were too many sesame seeds on the roll that it overpowered the other flavors. The wonton soup was half egg noodles and the other half was wontons, which was to my surprise.

Their chili garlic sauce that I added had a really spicy with a nice garlic aftertaste.

The plate was filled with little rings, not one tentacle in sight.  boo.  The second dish I ordered was quite enjoyable.  I had the dried scallop, duck, and seafood e-mein.  All of the seafood (shrimp and scallops) were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all.  This was exactly what my stomach was craving.  After filling up with the yummy noodles, I was satisfied and had the energy to go attack the tables again.",275LU0YLfAQPNsamNql4mA,0,0,4,D4Sr7sGRCDooK3FpHPQrrA

There was a wait, even at 8:30/9 pm, a mere hour before closing time! We had to wait about 20-30 minutes D:  But, good thing - they give you a buzzer that allows at least, for you (those over 21) to go sit at a nearby slot machine while you wait. 

It was busy, and our waitress was so rarely seen. We had to constantly keep an eye out for her, because she was MIA a lot. 

This restaurant is posh, and nice. Dark interior, with bamboo pillars. I liked it! It was a nice atmosphere for a reasonably-priced-for-vegas restaurant. 

We got the hainam chicken with rice, a shrimp tempura roll, a spicy cali roll, and tuna shashimi. Damn, that was expensive! $13 for two pieces of raw tuna on rice !! Wow. My dad didn't like it much, but then again, he is spoiled ;P 

The rice for the chicken was soggy, which was weird. There were all kinds of sauces on the side, which were all yummy. It also came with a small bowl of some sort of broth that was tasty. 

Our sushi rolls were about $11-13 each but they came in at least 6 - 8 pieces. They were delicious! I'm very picky with sushi, but these were, without a doubt, perfect! The rice had a great texture, and they were very flavorful. 

We did have to order more food, though, as it wasn't enough. We got the wok fried noodles with udon and XO sauce. It had a kick to it with its spice, and the udon noodles gave it a tweak to normal wok fried noodles. It was deliciously unique, having firm yet still soft udon noodles! They had lots of bite to it. 

Overall, yummy! It's a bit pricey, but what can you expect from a restaurant inside a casino? If you want cheaper(ish) asian food, go to spring mountain road in chinatown (it's not that far!).

We ended up ordering a fried rice, a noodle soup and a roll.

First off, the fried rice was not a serving size, it could have served 3 or more people. Second, the roll said it had tempura which was nowhere to be found. An ant would not even be able to find it.
Third, the food was just watevers. I've worked in many sushi restaurants and to pay triple the price for something that doesn't even taste half as good is pretty saddening. Never coming back here again.

We also ordered Bbq pork, steamed rice and Kung pow chicken.

Conceptually, it's weird to have a sushi joint w/ soup noodles.  I tried both and was satisfied.  Once we found this place, we ate here whenever we wanted to grab a quick bite.

This is the problem I have....the sushi chefs were making different size sushi.  Eating at the bar, we observed the same seadragon roll that we ordered in a much larger size!

I mean, really, how hard is it to slice up some freakin salmon, right? I know for sure doesn't take half a freakin hour. Bah, so I called the waiter and had my order cancelled - he did apologize - then gave me a bowl of miso soup with rice. WTF. I thought that was pretty insulting so I got a little more pissed - who the hell eats rice with miso soup? I know I don't. Asked for our bill, two minutes later - guess what? Here comes the waiter with my freakin order - that I clearly asked to be freakin cancelled. AND I was gettin billed for it! Now at this time I just really honestly wanted to cuss him out but thankfully for him, I'm not that kind of person. Kept my cool instead.

After splurging all over Vegas. Our wallets needed a little break. Thank goodness for the food credit that accompanied our reservation. The credit only applied to certain restaurants. I am happy to say my family favorite was on the list...The Grand Wok.  Woo hoo. 

Through the years my taste buds have evolved and has learned to appreciate food even more.  For over 15 years now, I can honestly say GW has been CONSISTENT day in and day out. Save yourself some time and money and stick to these two MUST HAVES: 

SHRIMP & PORK WONTON NOODLE ($16)
--Savory and clean light broth with thin egg noodles cooked to JUST the right consistency.  Al dente egg noodles had the perfect bite!  
--Wontons were filled with big shrimp pieces and ground pork. You get at least 6 pieces.  
--Chinese broccoli and black mushrooms to enhance the flavors.  DELICIOUS. 
--Big portion.  Enough to share for 2.  

HONG KONG STYLE PAN FRIED CRISPY NOODLES: 
--crispy thin egg noodles topped with seafood, vegetables and a gravy like sauce. 
--I don't see it on the menu anymore, but I believe you can still order it.  

My most recent visit I deviated from my norm and went for something lighter. 

-Chicken lettuce cups ($13): decent, but nothing to talk about
-Rainbow Roll ($17): I usually question how fresh sushi in the middle of the desert can be.  Can you say, stomach ache?   Enough said!! 
SERVICE: A bit slow and understaffed. But friendly and polite. Lady apologized for the slow service, but did not make excuses or put blame on anyone.  Very commendable of her!

TID BITS: 
--Over priced Asian food. What do you expect, it's Vegas. 
-MSG rating: 1/5
-Kid and family friendly
-They thrive on classic Chinese dishes....stick to those!

Hoping Grand Wok sticks around for many more decades to come.",loXavxKqdcIgrQeX1GSWUw,8,7,4,IyS6MlEkL-VZeLLFsim9Uw

We waited nearly 30 minutes before we saw any more food. Then everything came slowly, starting with the sushi. A few minutes later, another dish would arrive, and a few minutes later...another. We finally had all of our food, and not very much time to eat it all. 

The sushi was really good, and was very nicely displayed. The pieces were quite large. The pad-Thai was fairly good, but not the best I have had. The chicken pieces though, they were large and tender. Very good. I also tried the sweet n sour chicken, which was loaded with pineapple pieces. I really liked this dish.

After asking the waitress for the check, as we needed to get to our show, she proceeded to continue filling up all 9 of our water glasses. That was so frustrating, as she did not realize our need to leave. 

Again, the ambiance was nice, and the food was decent. If you do have a lot of time to spend, this place is quite nice.",bnk8hI3N5tprKm_lMK4I-w,5,6,3,Pd0HsZXljUXggSQuYaUvMQ

For two people, our check was a hundred dollars after gratuity.  I don't remember how much each dish costs, but I know the broccoli with beef order was a whopping $23.00.

We ordered two bowls of hot n sour soup, a dragon sushi roll, a pork pad thai, a broccoli with beef, and a large beer.

The hot n sour soup was extremely salty. So salty that I had to dilute it with water. The dragon roll was okay. It's basically a regular California Roll with avocado and eel added to it. Nothing fancy,  and it's no big deal.  The pork pad thai was also okay. It had enough flavor in it, but the rice noodles was a bit too clumped together. The order was tiny, not enough to feed two people.  The broccoli with beef was probably the best tasting. The oyster sauce made it really good, and the broccoli was fresh. Yes, this order was also very small. And finally the beer was cold and refreshing. 

The service was not too good. We had to keep flagging down the waitress before she came. She probably had a bad day since she was on the grumpy side.

The restaurant is really nice. Very comfortable setting. I could have enjoyed my dinner more if we didn't have to sit in between obnoxious people.  Boy, they were loud the whole time.  

Since our dining choices are in abundance at Sin City,  I probably won't be back to this place.  A hundred bucks for a meal that is probably 30.00 elsewhere is not worthwhile for me.

Like all restaurants in Vegas any Asian restaurant will price up their asian dishes. Since I am Asian, I know that these noodle dishes should be a lot cheaper, especially because it is so easy to make....BUT the quality is actually a lot better considering you're paying double the amount. 

We went with the: 

Dragon Roll: Yes this Asian place not only offers a bunch of noodle dishes, but sushi as well! The rolls were so thick! I like it like that and I love when the unagi pieces are thick too so you can actually taste the eel. The ingredients on this roll were so packed that it tastes so delish with the Teriyaki sauce.

Many of my best night in Vegas began here, no matter where on the strip I was staying I would go to MGM for sushi. 

However this last visit was a disappointment.
The staff was slow and seemed confused. 
They seated us with only one menu, which I still cannot figure out.
Many times my water glass was empty and I had to ask for a refill. 
Our food took over 45 minutes to come out, while other groups who were seated after us had already eaten and were signing their checks. 

Usually we get Orange chicken and sushi but this time we went for more Chinese food, big mistake. 

The portion of the Orange Chicken seemed to have been cut in half while the price increased, since July. The chicken was okay but it use to be better. The curry rice noodles were more bland than curry. The shrimp in with the rice noodles were not marinated and had no flavor.  

At least my favorite bottle of sake is still worth the money, however the price of that has almost doubled in the last year. 

All in all pretty disappointing meal for $100.

But the caveat is that you have to find a babysitter for the kiddo beforehand - c'mon people catch up here. ;)

Anyways, aside from that - this place still gets 5 stars! Why? Because on our first night in town with the baby, we got a craving for Chinese food. 

Strolled down Restaurant Row, and here we are. Hmmmm, dressed up Asian Fusion, with a great selection of all regions of Asia (well, except for the Philippines.... I suppose we are PI after all). 

When looking in the windows, we saw a family with 4 little ones under the age of 7 - OK this is OUR place. Great food, doesn't mind the kiddo making a mess, and even folded up the stroller for us when we walked in. 

The design and layout of the regular restaurant was very nice. WE never really sit at the Sushi Bar, unless it's date night. Doesn't seem fair to let the kiddo take up a stool where somebody could order their fix of unagi and toro, etc.

Anyways - the quality of service - SUPERB. From the hostess, Host, Manager, and of course waitress. 

We ordered 3 rolls to split between us and they were so tasty! I'll post a picture, and edit with names. 

Best part - they serve ORION. Finally - a place that understands it's not always about Asahi or Sapporo, etc. 

The evening ended with the waitress talking to Rachael in Chinese and her actually cracking a smile at a stranger. Now that is the magic touch. :)

But I think the best part of the experience, is that we didn't truly realize or appreciate it until after we left, but the beautiful glass walls that make the restaurant front, also serve as noise proofing for the casino traffic right outside. Now that's classy ;)",yt94lMP-3UxDgRM2wX-WyA,1,1,5,sH0LOoKEaHQOMNWlmhdTpw

Service: I sit down. Server asks what I'd like to drink, I say water and she quickly runs away even though I already know what I want to order.

Waitress takes another 10 minutes after water is delivered to come back to take my order even though the restaurant is more than half empty and I try to give her a visual que by closing my menu and placing it way on the other side of the table. Food takes an unbelievable 25 minutes to arrive and is disappointing (see below).

I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Shrimp, which is a dish I've had in several Thai and asian fusion restaurants across the country. It's sort of the Thai version of pho. The broth barely had any taste in spite of the fact it's marked on the menu as spicy. And lacked the depth of flavor of citrus, lemongrass and chilis that Tom Yum normally has. Really it tasted like water downed chicken broth with a hint of lemongrass flavor. I had to ask for some chili paste to spice it up to an acceptable level. The shrimp tasted like it had been cooked separately and added as a garnish after the dish was plated. It hadn't even been salted and lacked any hint of taste.

For $14 I expected the Tom Yum to be at least as good as if not twice as good as the versions I've had in the past for $6-$7.",GHZdMggvuYk1fsVWcyy0JQ,0,0,1,K5OXO6yXLAkHsSxi5g9Ybg

I ordered their shrimp pho and kimchi on their appetizer menu.  I was actually really surprised that they even had kimchi on their menu, but I was even more impressed on how the kimchi tasted.

Maybe the other fusion dishes are a better deal but I was dying for sushi and it was the closest place that was actually open.

Ok, so back to the price, I suppose that price is fair, we're in a desert.
Let's say I'm just to used to west coast pricing and sure, the fish is from extremely far away, that is NO excuse for $8 edamame! 

EIGHT DOLLARS. We're already helping them churn a profit on drinks, marking up edamame like that is insane, all one has to do for 'perfect edamame' is boil little pods or even microwave them in hot water! There is zero culinary skill required to make edamame. Sorry for the rant, it's actually quite funny. 

That is double the price of the most expensive, 5 star restaurant I've been to. Heck, in some places it's free. 

Then I went to the NY NY Hotel the next day, also expensive but during lunch hours you can get buy 2 get 1 free roles. Still high and a bit small but I was definitely satisfied after gorging myself on all of that.

More than a few people had recommended the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Spiced Fried Rice with Chicken Satay) so of course we ordered that.  We also ordered a Spider Roll and the Rock and Roll.

The sushi rolls were really mediocre and definitely not worth the price they charge but whatever, it's Vegas.  The main star of our dining experience was the Nasi Goreng.  Even though people said it was good, I didn't expect too much from it.  But literally, my reaction when I first bit into the chicken skewer was ""OOOOHH MY GOD!""  Yup, it was that damn good.

It did not disappoint it was cooked perfectly tender and the fried garlic and diced chili toppings were just like corner 28 on Main Street. Chris ordered the roasted duck with peanut sauce. The skin had a great glaze to it, although it could have been a little crispier. The meat was excellently tender. I order two rolls that came out about twenty minutes after Chris' food. The waitress told us the sushi table was backed up. They should ave held off on his food so we could eat at the same time. We ended up sitting at lunch for almost two hours. Their was too much rice on the rolls for my taste. The fish was super fresh tasting but my avocado was a little too brown.  All in all everything was pretty good but we would not go back. There are far too many places on the strip to go back to one to eat separately.",ohkA3vhJ3X2XSVY8dJ3qUw,1,0,3,eRjppkW_TO0sbtQVTHuu4g

It was a dish that I've been craving since we left Las Vegas (three weeks now).

The only real critique I have is that the wait service was running very slow. Our little waitress was trying very hard. She buzzed around our table and asked tons of questions. She was very friendly. She just had a tendency to disappear, and it was a LONG time before her initial visit to our table. When you order spicy food, you need water, and we had a heck of a time getting any.

The hanamiese chicken rice ($23) was bland and just not worth the price. It was small chicken pieces on bone. It basically was chicken scrap which comes with water down soup and sauce. 
We also ordered sake. I thought it would come in a sake bottle with two glass. Nope! My sake came in a wine glass..... IN A WINE GLASS!

The first time, we ordered the fried rice, eggplant and chinese roast pork (char siew). The egg plant was very well done, we absolutely loved it. The fried rice was too dry, it might be because they were not using the right grains. The roast pork was pretty average and too dry. We told the waiter we were in a rush and asked about the waiting time for the food. He assured us that the food would come very fast, and so we decided to order Chinese food instead of some simple sushi rolls. We waited about 15min for the food, which really felt like forever, but I guess is a rather reasonable time :S

The second time, we ordered the fried calamari, hainanese chicken rice, and steamed sea bass. The fried calamari was very well done. The batter was tasty and the calamari chewy and soft. The sea bass was just slightly overcooked in my opinion, but this could be my personal preference. 

The hainanese chicken rice was disappointing for me. Being a Singaporean tasting this Singaporean dish, I had high expectations for it. The chicken, sauces and soup were ok, but the rice was wrong :( The real chicken rice served rice cooked with chicken oil and pandan leaves. This one replaced it with coconut milk rice instead. I guess it could still work, but I'm not a fan of coconut milk rice at all, so I didnt quite enjoy it :(

We ordered the pork fried rice, as well as several sushi rolls. My husband said that the sushi was decent, for LV. I thought that the fried rice was decent as well, but it did have a hint of freezer burnt taste to it that lingered - and I'm never fond of that. My ginger ale also tasted funny, but our waitress was quick to replace it with Sprite, which tasted right.

The pricing is very much in line with LV pricing - we paid $80 for 3 sushi rolls, a huge bowl of pork fried rice and two drinks - a bit much for the quality but for LV, right on point.

I ordered the sea bass, roasted duck, and BBQ pork. My guest ordered the lobster soup, and sushi! The Sea Bass tasted amazing as the skin was crispy and the inner meat was moist and cooked to perfection. I can't say anything bad about the duck and BBQ, it was heavenly. The soup was also prepared with so much tasty flavor and spices that it alone could have been a meal of its own. 

Overall, the ambience here is very calming and friendly. The smells coming from the kitchen makes you want to try everything on the menu. The service is top notch!

First thing we ordered was hot tea. Being a foodie and lover of asian food, I know that hot tea at real asian restaurants are typically free or very cheap. Hot tea might cost the restaurant $0.05 to make. So since it's in Vegas, Grand Wok charged us almost $9!!! I didn't ask how much it was before ordering since I never paid more then $2 for hot tea in my life.
I admit the Hot Tea was good. Good flavor and nice presentation. 

Also ordered as meals, Pan fried dumplings and Honey Glazed BBQ pork. Both were very good and I was very surprised how good the BBQ pork was. Very tender and full of flavor and the peanuts with it was a good touch.  If it wasn't for a decent meal, I would've given this place 2 stars.

2 appetizers and 1 hot tea cost about $30. Over priced in the real world but normal price for a Las Vegas Restaurant.

Service was good and the decor was nice. I would say this place is a good place to eat if you're with people that like americanized asian food.",WmW7Ka8QzRlSl04ejE1i_g,2,1,3,EIdOcaRFhlhOXSGswsRC-g

We've seriously been eating buffet almost everyday to accommodate everyone's tastes, so we wanted some noodle soup before catching the Le Reve show at the Wynn. Which, by the way, was terribly boring, but at least I had a nice nap! 

So a group of 7 of us decided to just try The Grand Wok since it was the only Chinese restuarant in the MGM that had noodle soup. I ordered the beef stew noodle soup, a couple others ordered the wonton noodle soup and one person ordered the tom yum noodle soup, which is not Chinese but thai. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and pot stickers. 

My noodles were soggy. The soup had a nice herbal flavor though, but could tell it wasn't stewed long enough. Also, the portion wasn't much. The wonton noodle soup though had a pretty decent portion, but the broth was bland. The pot stickers and lettuce wrap weren't bad.

We started with the Aloha Roll ($14.95). It consists of a spicy tuna center wrapped with yellow tail, salmon, and tuna. The roll was delicious, but not something you couldn't get at any other sushi joint in Las Vegas. That was ok, because the next two dishes were both delicious. The macadamia nut beef strips over noodles ($19.95) was something new that none of us have ever seen before. The meat was so tender and moist. The nuts gave a good contrasting texture to an otherwise singular dish. Then the eggplant in Szechuan sauce ($9.95) was everyone's favorite dish. The sauce was the stand out ingredient.

5466729,2015-10-18,1,ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q,"Mongolian beef was absolutely awful. As in $27 that should have been used at any other Chinese restaurant on the strip. The meat was chunky, not thinly sliced as advertised, and not as original recipe follows. The meat was chewy as is I cut In the middle of each piece and it was red and bloody. I didn't order a filet mignon medium rare. This is such a simple dish, ugh, how you mess it up? The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce-I could see it being poured right out of a bottle, that's how bland this tasted. This was just a wanky version of what I expected. Also he recommended this dish as the best. What? Seriously?

Then, I pointed out how red it was, and he remade it. And guess what, the second time around the meat was exactly the same. Red, bloody and chewy inside. 

I feel like if I went to a 4 or 5 star restaurant the server would gladly exchange for another dish or do something but he was clueless as to why I asked for the check and my bowl was full of the original dish. 

Sorry folks for the rant but I'm highly disappointed for the service and the food. 

This is Vegas! You need your a game at all times-I would not recommend.
Just got to Vegas and this is my first experience. Do not come here. And if you do just drink the alcohol. Don't get the food. 

The service was traditional authentic Asian servers. Nice, but just didn't seem to care that I did not touch my food.",FJ_Us5rDjdXCkM9TQ1IDQA,2,2,1,HrMqTyQEuOm6zBhd4fInWA

Sushi: Sea Dragon Roll - Shrimp tempura, Eel, Roasted Garlic with spicy masago and Eel sauce...yeah it was ok at best. The rice was too sticky and really all I tasted was a lot of Eel

Main Dish: Honey Walnut Shrimp- Pretty darn good...shrimp were large and full of flavor. Just the right comonation of salty and sweet. The walnuts were perfect. Just wish this dish didn't cost $27

Side: Abalone Congee- Had high hopes....really bland. No flavor at all. big disappointment! 

Jasmine Dusted Chicken - yeah this dish sounds good. However....what a wasted $22. The chicken was chewy and way over cooked. After a couple bites I pushed it aside. The green beans were good....but I wasn't pleased with paying $22 for green beans. 

Sevice- Had to keep waving down the waiters. They would drop off food or drinks and not return for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sorry....but I could have sworn someone told me this was a fine dining establishment....meaning, I shouldn't be getting Denny's quality service....thanks. 

About $125 after tip for 3 people and no one was really happy when we walked out. Not my idea of a good time. Maybe we should have gone to the buffet.",x5nXteWvGXT_1-HqJyMIbw,1,0,2,DK0JvC_w0hjxeki7tUmsRw

sushi was just passable.  poorly made but good ingredients.  for example, i had a spicy tuna roll and found fish scales in it.  quite gross.  

shrimp and pork wonton soup was nothing special, exact same thing you can get for $4 at a cheap chinese restaurant

the cantonese roast duck was well seasoned but suffered from being very skinny, as the waiter described it.  very little meat, very little fat, the skin was not crispy at all.  mostly bone and cartilage.  

I agree with Alexander C, this place is EXTREMELY over priced.  The day that I went, the live lobster was $148 for a 2 lb lobster.  $148???  That's steep even for a Vegas restaurant, and this is not some fancy place.",wqZiFiqD0IwZvVHq9Rg7eg,1,0,3,oG2M47crQAtSyH0iyPdMfg

Yes, Grand Wok isn't a restaurant that one would go out of their way to dine at but it's convenient if you're staying at MGM Grand and appreciate (or in the case of my in-laws, need) Asian food. MGM is not without its Asian options (Shibuya, Hakkasan), but Grand Wok is more affordable and I would argue that the food here is even better than at Shibuya. The menu covers Chinese, Japanese (sort of), and Thai/Singaporean dishes--and while nothing was spectacular, nothing was awful either. For a lot of Asian tourists, a restaurant like this is necessary because burgers, steaks, and pizzas can get real old, real fast.

I recommend skipping the sushi altogether and sticking with the noodle-based and rice-based dishes. We liked the beef chow fun, fried rice, ramen, and honey-glazed walnut shrimp (soo much better than what we had at Shibuya!).

Even though they said that there was about a 30 minute wait, we probabaly only waited for about 10-15 minutes!

The service is a bit slow here, so expect to wait for them to take your order, refill tea/water, and for a box/check when you're done. Besides that, they are friendly, just seems like they're understaffed. 

Don't order the tea!! We ordered 3 cups of tea, they gave us a little pot, which wasn't even big enough to fill all 3 cups. Each cup was $4.50... way too expensive for a cup of tea that they seldom refilled!

Food- this review is only for the cooked food, we didn't try any sushi. For appetizer, we ordered the calamari (yum!) and for entrees, we ordered the Malaysian noodles, Singapore noodles, garlic shrimp fried rice, and the nasi goreng fried rice. They were all tasty! The rice and noodles were cooked so that they weren't clumped together and there was good flavor. I'd say that the most bland one was the garlic shrimp fried rice. My favorite was the Malaysian noodles because it had a lot of seafood in it!

Overall, a nice place for dinner with your family or friends! The prices are expensive for fried rice/noodles, but in Vegas, this was cheaper than many other places.",ZLesqkkzb-VCL-f6-9BZmQ,10,11,3,HvFOZPex7Pm3_XDavjklhw

Vietnamese Spring Roll : I wanted something light and fresh so i ordered this and these are not the original viet fat spring rolls.
There was like 6 pieces to the order and each piece is the size/diameter is the size of your finger....maybe a fat FINGER! i was basically eating rice paper.... 

what else.. what else... fried rice and pad thai is pretty standard... malaysian stirfried noodle tasted exactly like pad thai other than the fact that the malay noodles were round/thick....
