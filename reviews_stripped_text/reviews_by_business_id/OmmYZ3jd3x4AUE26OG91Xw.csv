I have to honestly say, I tried almost everything. Can't complain about food, it's all you can eat. But there is a sign, stating to take food only what you can consume. Overall experience..6 out of 10.",oeLfNTex0PL_kYYUiJqYYw,0,0,4,0eTdieORfXVqPuiStnCcHw
4041526,2016-07-03,2,OmmYZ3jd3x4AUE26OG91Xw,Stopped here with the family after a hectic traffic drive. Food was okay some of it was a little bit watery and taste less. Giving it 3 stars b/c they seated my family and I quickly and the coffee cake was great. The employees were polite. Wouldn't come here again however.,t55eb8P5Na6cBy2S-vm7kQ,0,0,3,ryyKArGj71QPYRf7bPxVVw

The dinner included sushi, some seafood, and usual Asian buffet classics.",WMN_WooRW4oN8TaFhNpyWg,0,0,4,nTjGJFF-yDPPIj3SR_mFmg

The main problem I had was that I was wanting some sushi, but not one kind was fully veggie. All seemed to have some type of fish or imitation crab. Bummed. Price was pretty good for the selection.",Xcc0K_MOu7ALwEu5Q0B7Dw,0,0,3,Y3uM_m4qrWwHA9AwEDZVCA
