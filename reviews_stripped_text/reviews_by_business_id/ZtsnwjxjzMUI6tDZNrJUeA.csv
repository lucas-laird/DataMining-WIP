So you push that aside thinking your steak will be good enough to bare the smell.  Nope, ordered a medium rare, still tough as nails.  I ordered ONE drink, the same exact drink I ordered at Tex Mex down the street, a smaller portion for literally double the price.  Tex Mex $5.00, this place $10.00 for a vodka and seven up in a smaller glass.  Then, I asked for a side of ranch, charged me for it.  This place is ridiculous.  What are you? Gorden Ramsy Steakhouse?  Get out of here, your food sucks so don't charge me extra for ranch to try and get the leather tasteless steak out of my mouth.",Rr4nRgrl3JVJPdDSz4__PA,1,0,1,aBOLg1RFvpDeCAKdPO4Rfw

Once he came by he was rude and said that the salad was half eaten and wasn't sure if there was anything he could do.  He took the salad and left.  Came back a short time later and said the manager will take it off the bill.  He didn't think it was right because now his tip would be reduced.  Not once did he apologize.

From the time we were greeted to having our orders taken it literally felt like joy and happiness were being sucked out of the room by Cherlyn. The fries are great, the burgers... ehh. From the first bite of their sliders my teenage girls said that the beef had a weird taste like one that would end up making them sick. My husband and I both tasted them and agreed that they had a weird taste. By the time we got the servers attention and explained how we felt. All she said was ""okay, I'll see if I can take it off the bill"" when she came back she took the two plates saying that she had to show them to her manager, which we thought was weird. We figured that maybe she would offer to fix it when she came back but instead when passing by us 10 minutes later casually stated  that the manager gave her the okay to take the the charges off the bill... really?? With still no attempt to rectify the situation by means of giving us an opportunity to order something different, the ""server"" over charged our card. When we asked why, she stated that it was for one of the condiments we requested, which normally I wouldn't mind paying for but considering that the condiment couldn't be utilized due to the 2 inedible dishes, we thought it was a little absurd and poor business practice.

Walked in around 10:00 AM and wanted to sit at the bar and have some breakfast.  Two patrons at the bar and no bartender.  Five minutes later, still no bar tender.  I looked around and there was no one anywhere else except for two other guys across the bar.  There was only a loud hacking cough coming from the dining room area.  Non stop disgusting cough.

The place smelled like smoke.  Not just your normal Vegas bar smoke smell, it smelled like they were using a few hundred pound of Marlboros to cure a frigging ham.  Pretty thick vomit smell too.

Our waitress was a complete ditz. We waited 10 minutes just to have our drink orders taken. By the way, there was maybe 3 other tables seated...not busy at all. 

We order our drinks, I ask for coffee and she says ""oh I don't have any fresh"" and so I replied with, ""can you make some?"" And she says "" oh ok, but it may take a while"".  How dare I ask for coffee!!! Little did I know she would be referring to the entire night. My friend orders a rock star and vodka and when she finally brings it, it's just the rock star and says ""oh I thought you were kidding"". 

At this point I knew we should have left but he was exhausted after the drive in, so 30 min in, we get to put our order. He orders the rib eye and I order steak medallions. 

About 50 min later, I, in that time had to stop two other waitresses for refills on drinks and also asked if our order was put in. She sends over my waitress and she says ""I'm so sorry we had a large group come in AFTER you so our kitchen is backed up"" 

I can't believe this. Finally an hour and 40 min after arriving there, our food comes out. His is great, mine? Cold. Cold steak, the ""grilled"" onions were raw and cold, and the mashed potatoes were cold with luke warm gravy. It takes me another 10 min to flag down a different waitress, by this time, my friend is done with his meal, I ask to speak to the waitress and I tell her how terrible the night has been. She apologized and asked if I wanted soup instead!! Then proceeds to hand us a bill for $70 for a food plate that I didn't touch! 

First and last time. I now tell everyone about that situation and I would never step a foot back in there. The food would have been better at Sizzlers! And for the service? How embarrassing for you.

 In fairness, it's about a 20 minute drive away from Las Vegas, but well worth the trip. It's very friendly and inviting, spotlessly clean and with steaks to die for - if that's your thing! If you are a dessert person, prepare yourself - theirs are about 3 times the size of ours and just can't be done. When they show you what there is, you think you are looking at the whole thing, but it's a portion!

Montana Meat is co-located with a video-poker bar, and features a separate restaurant area. The kitchen is open 24H, the restaurant area closes at 10 PM on weekdays. The restaurant area is nonsmoking, it's not sealed off from the bar area, this is a showstopper for us at some restaurant/VP bar combos but smoke wasn't a problem the two times we've eaten here.

At most restaurant/VP bars in Vegas you'd never consider actually eating the food, but, Montana Meat features memorable steaks, and it has a robust selection of salads, non-steak entrees (e.g. lobster tails, lamb chops) as well as sandwiches and other breakfast and lunch items.

Judging by the reviews, it looks like Montana Meat Company gets a lot of its business by being close to home for many. Same here. Just up the street so it's closer than Outback, and cheaper too. I've had some great steaks here and fortunately they've always been cooked to perfection. Each entree comes with 2 sides so you won't leave hungry. I ordered filet medallions and DAMN they were delicious. 

Desserts are amazing as well...I suggest the cookie ice cream sandwich. The dining area is nice where you don't feel like you happen to be eating steak among a cigarette convention. But if you like that route, the bar area is cozy too with lots of TV's.

The Good - The burger was one of the best I have ever had.  Amazing flavor.  Seasoning was spot on.  The bun was terrific.  Just a flat out awesome burger experience. 

The Bad - The fries were cold.  Not just my regular ones, but my wifes sweet potato fries as well.  I wish I could say this was the biggest issues but it wasn't.  The service at this establishment was absolutely horrific.  Not in a rude sense but slow like watching the grass grown for hours.  The server had zero personality.  It took a while to get him to come over.  We asked a question about the burger special which must have been what put him in a crappy mood.  ""Oh, great, more 2 for 1 people with no money.""  Now, I was formerly in the hospitality business for over 18 years and am a serious over tipper.  I do because I served and tended bar for years and know that you live off of gratuity.  The food comes and luckily we did need anything during the meal because we never saw the server again.  We had to aggressively plead the busser to get us a Coke refill.  It took nearly 15 minutes to get the check.  I swear I almost walked out.  I probably should have.  Needless to say I did not leave a very good tip since it certainly wasnt deserved.  I should not have left any gratuity but I just cant bring myself to do that.  I know, that is just plain stupid.  

I doubt that the management group of the Montana Meat Company is keeping an eye on Yelp to make sure that they are getting reviewed well so I doubt this situation will change much.  If they were reading consistantly, I doubt I would have had the experience I did.  

So even though this burger was killer,,,, it is still not in the same league as BJ's bar and grill off of Valley View near the 215.",9kMi8dCXhj0i08a41DSVqw,0,0,2,9vYMFeTOaaL_qC9NKazm_Q

We asked about flavored margaritas...nope no flavor and no blender either... so on the rocks it was. We each ordered one.
Minutes after the server walked away, we found an old drink menu online. I wanted to change my drink so my husband ran to the bar to catch the bartender.... and change my drink. The server came back and confronted us... like how dare we change the drink and order off an old drink menu.

I also order take out at this place at least once a week if not more and have noticed some things that have finally made me choose not to come back to this place anymore.

First of I would like to say that the prices at this place are great, very hard to beat, quality of the food is okay to good.  Some items are a great deal at a great price, that is what kept me coming back to this place.  

Now since i've been ordering take out for the past few months I've realized that they ALWAYS mess up on something in the order.  For this whole time it's been something very small (no onion rings instead of regular fries, missing bacon in a burger, no guacamole, etc.  Now this has more often then not but in my head was not such a big deal that it would change my opinions about this place. Also during my experience here I've never been charged a ""togo charge', this past order their was a ""togo charge"" and when I asked why that was there and that i've never been charged that before he arrogantly said ""we always charge togo charge"" bs. buddy, this was my first time. Okay that's no big deal though, let's get on to it.

Just recently my girlfriend ordered a salad for take out.  When she came back home to eat it there was just the salad, no dressing.  This was obviously something that needed to be brought to their attention so we called them and had to drive all the way back so that they could give us salad dressing.  Once the second trip to this place just for one order was done, we get home again and crack open the salad.  Once the salad is ""tossed' with the dressing we just got, we realize that the salad was iceberg lettuce when it clearly says on the menu that it is a mixed green salad.  Also it was supposed to have other items in it as well (blue and red tortilla chips etc) and those were not present either.  They basically made it completely wrong and tried to pass it off to us. This is absolutely unacceptable and i'm not willing to pay for something i don't want.

We placed another phone call to the restaurant this time to talk to a manager since all the other employees seem to have the heads up their asses and I wanted a resolution to fix a ""simple salad' that they somehow miraculously ruined.  The manager that answered the phone was Bryan, he seemed nice on the phone and when explained the situation he said it was okay and to come by either tomorrow or the next day to get a refund.  

Upon going to Montana to pick up my refund we were met by another manager Scott, this guy was not on the same page as the first manager and was actually extremely rude and completely unprofessional.  Upon giving us the refund he had the nerve to say, ""How I do business is to have the customer bring back the togo order to fix it"" (which we already did) ,""and he also threw in that it is the customer's responsibility to make sure that their order is correct when they pick up their order. ""Excuse me? Don't you manage a restaurant? That's not how it works, you don't say a customer is wrong, fuck you man, just getting fired up thinking about this ass and how he is somehow a manager.  Oh and by the way when he came to give us the refund, he threw it on the table and walked away!!  How mature, as long as this guy is working there, they will never have my business again.

Scott if you're reading this, get a new job, this one's not for you. Get a job where you don't have to deal with people because you've got bad attitude and shouldn't be dealing with customers.",SlojgbUNxde2tsiAzXbY2g,8,1,2,EBakUNUfcYOoo_EjBAeuDg

1462556,2013-01-28,7,ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,"I love Montana's for two very solid reasons.  

1)  It's literally walking distance from my house.
2)  Their breakfast menu.  No, really, it's bomb.  It's cheap, delish and more importantly, they wrap it up well for carry out.  It has and will always be my go-to spot for Sunday breakfast.  At least until brunch finally becomes cool in Vegas.  Now just because it's cheap doesn't mean jack.  The old saying ""you get what you pay for"" doesn't apply here.  It's a damn bargain.  

Side Note:   Owner, just because I said it's cheap doesn't mean you need to go around raising prices.  Ya heard?  Us Yelpers do have the option to go back and edit our reviews.  :-)",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,7,1,4,Q4K1Tu2BVQlMj_W3bYkVzQ

Most recently we had the country Mac n cheese and the tuna salad. I was pretty po'd when the bf wanted to come here instead of having the sushi I was so badly craving. I mean, the tuna salad sure wasn't the sushi roll I was craving, but it was pretty yummy and satisfied me at the moment. 

Looking through the reviews I'm pretty surprised to see negative comments on the waitress, Cherlyn. We have been served by her a few times and she's always been pleasant and attentive. Even when my boyfriend was adamant about no onions in his food and it came out with it anyway, she kindly took it back and had it fixed with no onions. My boyfriend always knows how to ruin a meal by fussing with the ingredients.

So of course I ordered a coffee and we were set! We both ate for around 20 dollars including tip! Saved over 10 dollars!

The service is exceptional, although not all the bartenders are very social to me. and I have been coming there for almost 5 years now and I couldn't tell you any of their names, nor they could me. As a neighborhood bar, it's imperative you find out your regulars names or at least where they work to show you care even if you don't lol.

Walked in on a Monday evening with no wait time. And was seated within seconds by a really nice waitress. Sadly I can't remember her name but it's a shame because she have fantastic service! She was blonde if that helps anyone :)

We asked what was recommended and she told us about their famous burgers and meats. She also told us about their promotion of buy one get one free for the burgers hell of a deal since the burgers are only $8 bucks and up. 

We started with an appetizer. Spinach artichoke dip which was so creamy and cheesy. The kids loved it which is unbelievable. My kid eating veggies? Or something green? It is officially the end of the world. 

Our friends got a burger and chicken buffalo strips. Around $10 each. Mine was personally $11 but came with BBQ sauce, onion rings and crispy bacon cooked medium. Delicious! Cooked to perfection and the best part was the side. It comes with onion rings or fries for next extra charge. Here's the kicker.. You can have half and half! Whoopy! Most places don't so that anymore and if they do they charge extra. I was so excited! The couple we dined with said I acted as if I won the lottery. Ha ha, meanie heads. Hey, I love my food what can I say. The onion rings tasted beer battered like the ones at yardhouse. 

The children's menu is extremely affordable. I got my daughter the cheese quesadilla, which I thought came just with a drink for $3. But instead it came with a order of fries too, which I wasn't expecting. Awesome. 

My husband loved his club sandwich. Which he said was huge and he could only eat half which if you know my husband is unheard of. Crazy talk I tell you. So, big portions are here as well.

Customer service was great. They were quick about giving us refills which we never had to ask for. And extra napkins because they knew we had kids 

This is officially my new burger place. I can't wait to come back. Too bad it's not closer to my house!",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,13,13,5,8ojTipqrrdZKnU8ictYh-Q

Fish & Chips are fine but not worth $13, more like $8. Maybe $10 if they hadn't forgotten to include cole slaw as advertised, which I discovered upon reaching home with my order.

Desserts are okay. I came with a friend on one occasion after eating elsewhere to sample their desserts and we ordered about three to four items to taste a variety. Most of it was overly cloying, or tasted like it had come out of a box if that makes sense. (Like the brownie for the brownie sundae tasted like a microwaved Little Debbie bar?

I used to go into the restaurant with the lady a couple years ago. At first the restaurant was quiet then families started roaming into the facility. Sort of like a migration. A short time after the ""migration"", it got loud as these folks didn't have any regard for other patrons. They typically showed on the weekend. My guess is they probably just got done with their prayers to an invisible deity at their locale worship center. Right afterwards they opted for breakfast to feed the ""commune"". Trust me, they don't give a sh*t about others (there is a Mormon worship center very close). The lady no longer wanted to go to breakfast at this location - not relaxing.

At this point, I started going alone for a bit of personal time, but alas took my meals in the bar! Life suddenly got sweet again. Okay, this is where the 5-stars are warranted. The bar is kickass! One of the first things you notice is the iconic ""leg"" lamp from a ""Christmas Story"". That alone is worth a couple stars. Still, it is only so far a ""leg"" lamp can hold up a place. What in my opinion really makes this bar shine are my two regular morning bartenders, Emely and Wes! These two are pretty contrasting in nature, but both damn good on multiple fronts. 

My advice for adults is dodge the restaurant and pop into the bar. If you got Emely or Wes tending, then just settle in and relax. If you catch Mark before he leaves shift then you are gold.

For the record, the bartenders at Montana's also wait tables. If you opt to roll the dice, then you might get lucky and have a stellar waitress/waiter with a quiet meal.

2984965,2016-07-24,4,ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,"My girls were hungry after the movies tonight so we decided to give Montana Meat Company a try. This experience was doomed from the start. Let me say before I get into the details that when I get a Millenial server, I always hold my breath and pray for the best. We were seated by a girl who looked to be in high school and did not greet us or even smile when we walked in. She was on her cell phone behind the podium that she was standing behind, so my impression is that we were keeping her from the latest Facebook post or possibly a snap chat that just came in. She led us to the table and then backtracked around us to get back to her important cell phone business that we distracted her from.

     We weren't greeted (because that would have required an introduction and a smile), but rather approached by our server Cherlyn. The only reason I know her name is that I looked on the receipt when the bill came. She took my girlfriends drink order and asked my 3 year old what she wanted to drink. When she came back with the drinks they were in very large plastic cups. As she was sitting the drinks down the lightbulb came on in her head and she asked if we wanted a kids cup for my daughter. Well of course, the cup is bigger than my kid was my response. We finally got the right cup and we began to order. We got the chicken fingers for our daughter from the kids menu and we asked what options she had for sides. Steak Fries was her response. What about a veggie I asked? It's whatever they have she said. Ok, I'm getting annoyed now. I finally got an answer that consisted of some mixed information. It's either green beans or Broccoli for a green vegetable, but it depends on what they have was the response. I explained that my daughter doesn't eat green beans so if you don't have broccoli then bring some fruit instead. Cherlyn seemed a little annoyed by this request and immediately began to take our order. I ordered the 10 oz Filet medium with a baked potato and my girlfriend got a burger and steak fries. 

    A food runner brought my daughters food out first and right on cue it came out with green beans. We explained that we ordered either broccoli or fruit, so we scraped the green beans off and he brought back some fruit. A minute later Cherlyn walked by and asked how the food was so far. We began to tell her the mistake, but I don't think she heard us because she never fully stopped and began waiting on the booth behind us.

     My steak came a few minutes later and I knew I was in trouble. The Filet was a thick cut and I had ordered it medium. When I cut into it, the inside was very rare and mostly cold. What a shame. I payed market price ($30.00) for a cold piece of meat. The server should have offered to butterfly cut the filet when I ordered it medium. Any decent server at a steak house knows about the meats that they serve and if the Filet is cut thick it is very hard to cook it medium or well without burning it, which is why I opt for the butterfly cut in those situations. Another surprise was in store for me when I found green beans on my plate. I had no idea a vegetable was offered for my dinner, or I would have chose something else. Amanda's burger was ok, and we payed the bill and got out of there. 

     This was a miserable experience and we won't be back to get burned again. What a shame, because this steakhouse is in our neighborhood and we really wanted it to be good.",m1-HNN4pghUqDIKr2FUcmw,3,0,1,i1ZizIKkqO0NEUHnyrPthA

I ordered the ribeye and it was okay, but it wasn't seasoned. If it was, the burn taste overpowered it. The other thing that threw me off was the crust that forms on mash when it sits for a few minutes at the window. That turned me off.

However, to get one super chilled onion ring on my burger is unacceptable and borderline bizarre.",gyTYQo6Cn4BYB4z-McRDaA,0,0,2,0ZCT7VazNn5T8bfakW_jwg

Having said that, the burger special here is ridiculously cheap.  BOGO free!  For 10-11 bucks, you can have 2 huge burgers and endless fries.

You can also get sandwiches and wraps in place of the burger.  They grind their meat fresh and it has that backyard burger taste.

It's just a tad bit more than eating fast food but so much better in terms of quality.

I looked at the grave yard specials and you can get lamb chops for 5 bucks...are you kidding me?

They also have cheap breakfast specials and a steak/egg special I will try.

If the food were healthy, I would replace Montana with cooking b/c it is so dirt cheap.

They don't make money off me because I don't drink nor do I gamble but i hope others continue to b/c on the food side, this place isn't making much money.  I hope their burger special stays for good.",ZyGrNTbnab8N3kmesYaQBQ,0,0,4,b3FCmmRzm_tRVVqs_GLpOw

My husband and I live extremely close to the Montana Meat Company and decided to give it a try.  Every time we passed by there were always a ton of cars here and after reading all the 4 star reviews, it couldn't hurt, right?  WRONG!  

We decided to do an early valentines day dinner here, so we went the night before so it wouldn't be too busy.  You would think we would have received excellent service but we sure didn't.


But let's start with the food.  

I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, but wait, where were the artichokes?   There must have been 3 pieces in the entire dip.  Ok, maybe 4.  And I promise I am not over exaggerating.  The salads came out next, unfortunately it looked like the lettuce was browning and they tried to cover it up with way too much dressing.  And finally, the steak.  My husband ordered his steak medium rare, which he has been doing for years whenever he has a steak.  This steak wasn't even rare, it was RAW.  Now my husband eats almost everything and he never hesitates to eat a rare-medium rare steak, but after he cut into it, he stopped and stared at me.    We had to send it back and when the server brought it back rudely told my husband he should cut into it to make sure he was satisfied and stood there and watched him.

The service?   two thumbs down.   Service was sooooo slow and it seemed like a rather slow night.

We lived in the meth- head capital of the world previously and could still walk to a super fun sports bar with outstanding food and customer service, and not pay much money, but were happy to return regularly.
We got to the Durango Montana Meat place at around 5:15pm on a Friday. There were stragglers in the bar and only a few booths of diners were filled.
We were greeted and our server stopped by to see if we would be ready to order. Lackadaisical at best.
You know the drill- end of shift, out of personality, Sorry folks. We were struck by her indifference.
We ordered and received our meals which were a steak sandwich and some fish and chips. Onion rings were flown out from Hampton Beach NH 1968 and heated up, it seemed. My husband had students who were fresher when he was a teacher. Steak was tender but those oversalted canned mushrooms in gravy were disdainful to the customer. Fries are ok but they obviously sat on the kitchen counter while Unbusy Server waltzed around trying to look productive. Fish was fair.
I had really thought this place would be alive and worthwhile. I rarely leave a place so daunted. We gauged that the quality of dessert may not be high either and left to go to Art Square and First Friday where there may be a hot sweet snack to soothe our despondency.

One of my stars is for the Worcestershire on the table and one is for the sports we can watch here.

The steak is sorta decent for the price, but it's no Delmonicos, na'mean? I mean, I think it would decent for the price. Read on.

I got the 20 oz Montana Ribeye, the ""cowboy cut"" steak at this place. My waitress was gushing about how big it was, I told her to re-focus on the steak and stop staring at my lap. No, but seriously, she was gushing about how big it was, and I almost took her home. Ok, but seriously, she wanted it.

No, but seriously... the steak was supposed to be huge? Maybe it started as 20oz, but it definitely shrank. Fine, whatever, it was still a decent size, but it wasn't as big as the T-bone my father got.

I ordered my steak medium, it came out well done. I DO NOT like well done steak. I think if the steak came out cooked correctly, it might have been good. Since cooking a steak well done basically renders it flavorless, I was legitimately surprised when there were moments that I actually tasted delicious rib eye and not charcoal. 

There were some decent beers on tap, the service was good, the ambiance was better than I expected. This place is a block or so away from my house, so I figure I'll be back. I have to write a follow up review for it. So far, though, not impressed. I wasn't expecting a five star steakhouse, but if you're selling steaks, you should at least have a chef that can time it correctly.

Oh, the raspberry chocolate cheesecake was incredible. That's why this is a 2-2.5 star rating and not a 1-2 star one :)",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,3,2,2,c35f8FumQy5045zFbIir6w

It's so close to my house that we have come here for that reason alone. I think the other meals are better than the steaks.

It is connected to bar so sometimes smoke can waft over to dining area.

Customer service: pretty good since each time there has only been one waiter/waitress, 2 bus persons and a bartender for the whole place. Emily is a sweetie and she's the gem of this place.

The food: I've had 3 good meals & 3 mediocre meals. Pleasant surprises have included super great bar food, wings, and appetizers. Salads are really fresh! Soups yummy and change frequently. Kids meals are great!!! I gotta be honest that the steaks are NOT as good as they could be. Cuts are thin, fatty ribeyes, and usually overcooked. I've noticed my kids serloin had better flavor than the ribeye special. Temperature can be off on food too.

Suggestions to manager: 1) hire one more staff to help out on weekends 2) please have chef stop drenching the veggies in butter - half the amount should do 3) please note chef that kids don't usually like tons of pepper...don't put it on the kids meals including their steak, burgers, etc. It's on the table after all. 4) please throw away the dried flowers collecting layers of dust - it's grody to look at a flower arrangement made in the 90s that looks like it hasn't been dusted since the 90s while eating. 5) chef please do not use an ice cream scooper to serve mashed potatoes - cafeteria tacky!

Came in with a few friends around 3AM on a Friday night. We were all a little tipsy but wanted to stay close to home so we made this our choice of bar. The bartender took about 15 minutes to come over, my friend actually had to shout out ""excuse me"" to get his attention. Normally i would make an excuse for a bartender not noticing someone sit at the bar, but he had to literally buzz us in since it was after midnight. 


When we ordered our drinks he then went over to the group he was chatting up prior to us ""interrupting"" him. 15 minutes later he brings us over our beers. No reason this should have taken so long. But we were gaming so my other two friends didn't really notice.

It then took us several attempts at getting another round. when we finally succeeded we decided we would go somewhere else. We had gamed a total of 280$ between the 3 of us and each had 2 drinks. We asked for our bill and when we received it we noticed not a single drink was comped. I'm not one for complaining when i don't received something comped but that is ridiculous. We paid our bill and still left a 10$ tip. My friend also asked the bartender for a pack of cigarettes but we noticed it wasn't on the bill so we figured he just didn't charge her. When we were leaving we walked out the door and out comes the shouting bartender. ""Excuse me!!! You guys didn't pay for those cigarettes."" My friends laughed, threw him a 20$ and we left.

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of one is because I hope to return to this bar and see another bartender. But until then... this will be my review.",z8wN6EQuw_JF-zTjcNgsLw,9,6,2,fC5iBtLfjBMgTFtaqOsKBA

The poor girl behind the bar has no help, so you can't receive prompt service. I experienced this before, so I called ahead with my order, but still had to wait 10 minutes while my steak got cold. Not the first time this has happened. I ordered a rib eye, but received what I believe is a sirloin instead, though it could have been anything else for all I care, it was terrible. It was burnt on the outside and flavorless. I called to let them know. Then instead of just replacing, she decided to tell me that this poor excuse for a steak was fine. So I said never mind, I don't want it. So now that I'm walking out of the restaurant she asks whether I want a refund. I told her to forget it, I just didn't want to deal with them any longer. I hope they have a cute dog they don't love too much to give it to. 

Never go there! Even the convenience of having them close to home isn't worth the waste of time, the poor service, the burnt steak and the annoyance.",_GMMrAktxh9GMQGJnkR3BQ,0,0,1,MaTg2STn1smsfvAqKnUsyQ

When we first walked in it took a good 5 minutes to get greeted...but as soon as our ""soon to be busser"" saw we were waiting, he came up to us...greeted us, and seated us right away.  We had automatically realized that the restaurant was short staffed...we work in the hospitality industry...so for that fact, we were very understanding. The appetizer, the blackened tuna, served rare, was delicious..and the price was shockingly reasonable for a 6 oz. piece of tuna.   After that we had a 10oz. filet, split, that was ordered med rare.  It had come out rare to our disappointment and we had asked to put it back on the grill for another minute or two to get it up to med rare....but we were also thinking that the rest of our meal would be cold by the time we called the server, sent it back, and have it come out again.  To our surprise, the server, AND the busser were completely nice, quick, and understanding.... they fixed the problem right away.  We got our steak back to perfect temperature, with new sides that we ordered fresh and hot.  Even the house red wine, was good..considering it was house wine.  I think it might have has something to do with the fact that they weren't cheap when ordering wine glasses because they were hand made and had no lip on the rim like a machine would do...I know.....  too analytical.   But it is what it is.  Overall, good quality steak, friendly service, with an amazingly reasonable price.

We were the only table left in the entire restaurant. Anyways they finally brought the food out now 45 mins sitting and waiting. The waitress did apologize but didn't seem sincere.

Went in with low expectations as I didn't get the best service my last visit about a year ago. Was very smoking inside which was not friendly to my asthma. Servers name was Cherlyn (sp?) and I was helped right away. We ordered a 10oz and 7oz filet as well as calamari and drinks. The calamari lacked flavor and was very skimpy especially for the price. The filets were much better. The server helped us with all our questions and concerns and seemed to be running the show herself and I felt bad about keeping her so busy. Long story short... A better visit this time but due to the outstanding service rather than food.

The restaurant is on the left side of the building.  We were pleased to see that it was still kept well and clean.  Many video poker bars in Vegas go downhill rapidly.

After taking our drink orders, the server told us the Lunch Special was Buy One Burger, Get One FREE.  We decided to go for the Special and ordered a BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and a Montana Peppercorn Burger.

After a short wait the server brought out our food.  I should have paid closer attention to the menu because the Montana Peppercorn Burger was served open-face with Gravy smothered all over the Burger & Fries.....not exactly what I wanted, but that was my bad.  Mom wasn't that hungry, so she was nice enough to trade with me....so I had the BBQ Bacon Burger.  The Burger was pretty good, not great....the Onion Rings that were served as toppings for the Burger were great.  The Steak Fries that came with the Burger were awesome.....they were cooked just right so that they weren't too soft or soggy.....which happens a lot with Steak Fries....they made it just right.

Mom couldn't finish the Gravy smothered Burger, so I had a couple of bites....I didn't really care for it....I'm not a fan of Gravy unless it's with Turkey & Stuffing.  I could barely taste the Peppercorn Burger under that Gravy and Grilled Onions.

My chicken nachos were just a lot of chips and my girlfriend's French dip was so dry and hard she called it ""tough"". When you take your girlfriend out to a restaurant that specializes in good meats and she describes her French dip as being ""tough"" that's embarrassing. Not only for me but for the restaurant who should have an excellent French dip.

Bottom line: service was poor and food was not great.
 Also, they grouped everybody together in only one part of the restaurant so we had people sitting there facing us the whole time easily able to listen to our conversation. Lazy service considering there was plenty of additional seating to spread everyone out

At first our server was quick to greet us and give us menus. He quickly went down hill. After ordering our meals, we told him we were going to want cocktails but didn't know exactly what we wanted yet. We mentioned we would want wine, but had to wait for him to come back around and ask him for a wine menu. 
We then had to walk up to the bar to let our server that was watching tv know our wine order and another dressing for the salad we ordered because the dressing was incorrect. 
After we received our food we didn't get checked on until we were offered dessert.
We also received the wrong wine. Which he did correct.

Food: 
The ribeye special is a great deal, 2 riveted with veggies, potatoes and and salad. 
Salads were good and fresh. Steaks were good but nothing to write home about. They were a little over cooked and lacked flavor. 
Anytime the have steak sauces pre-set on the tables it's never a good sign.

Most of the time we are there to hang out at the bar, but the dining are is very nice. A bit dark and a lot of leather. The decor is right out of a cattle ranch minus the manure smell. I like it!

Along with the good food, is a good staff. We have gotten to know some of the workers and everyone is so nice! 

The bar area is cool. About 6 plasma TV's for sports and they serve one of my favorite brews... Anchor Steam! 

The food is really good. I have been here MANY times and I have only had to send one thing back ever... The Steaks are obviously their trade mark and the main attraction on the menu (http://www.montanameatco.com/menu.htm), and they are very good. The prices are not too bad either for a steak dinner.

Now, the strange thing about this place is to be called the meat co., you would think there would be many meat choices on the lunch menu.  Besides a roast beef sandwich and some medallions, everything else was chicken or fish. LOL! 

I chose the Mac and Cheese with Buffalo Chicken, because of the suggestions on here...glad I did. 
****warning: there are strips of red onion in this, even though the menu made no mention of it.***
Anyway, after they re-cooked it without onions, and spit in it, I truly really enjoyed it. You could definitely taste the buffalo sauce, so it had a nice spicy flavor to the creamy cheese sauce. Nice chunks of chicken topped it off to yummy goodness. It was a nice sized potion, and comes with garlic bread (although mine didn't and I had to remind them to bring it).

My friend then offered his credit card to pay and the bartender had the nerve to ask me if I wanted a drink. Ended up paying $12 for the drink that was wasted and leaving. I believe the bartender's name is Reese. His service was completely unacceptable. Ended up at a competitors bar and easily put at least $500 in their machines. The owners and managers of Montana Meat should wake up and realize that service brings customers back. I'd rather drive farther to not have to deal with Reese and his rude behavior.

The steak is delicious. That's probably what you should eat when you come here; don't stray. I've also enjoyed their Bolognese Pasta (the noodles were overdone, but sometimes I love that delicious, mushy, homecooked feel to pasta), Jalape√±o Burger, Southwestern Chicken Salad, and Grilled Salmon. I also enjoy steak fries and that's what they serve! I don't care for their Bread Pudding or Calamari (I used to, but it's kinda meh now) though.

The only downside for me is the cigarette smoke, but that's what you get when you're in a bar.

Montana Meat Co is both a restaurant and a bar. We walked in to the restaurant part and were eventually greeted by the busboy, but we weren't really sure what job he had. You see, we had three different waiters tending to us over the course of the meal. More on that later. 

The busboy/host/waiter sat us and took our drink orders. The bartender from the bar part of the restaurant eventually took our orders: club sandwich on sourdough and pulled pork with onion rings. The food came out quickly but we never saw the bartender/waiter again as service was taken over by a waitress. At least we guess it was taken over by the waitress as she never actually told us that. She spent the rest of the time just filling our water glasses. 

The club sandwich on sourdough I ordered was served to me on white bread. The club was dryer than the temperance movement during prohibition. The pulled pork sandwich was served without the onion rings.

I remember settling for a martini I saw on the promotion menu at the edge of the table. It was a really good, get-the-job-done drink! Just what I was looking for at that time! I ordered a French Dip that was packed with delicious roast beef! 

This spot is hidden on Durango right before Blue Diamond, but you'll more than likely be able to smell the place as you're driving in. 

Make sure to go with good company, in case the food takes a bit longer than expected. They're just putting extra love and effort into making it perfect!",7L8utEpYiVj3pNNjZkQaLQ,1,2,4,4y77RZ0SeCLVwL78-c1JcA

Sometimes I get a craving for spicy chicken fingers - no bones - and steak fries. It's so difficult to locate a spot that has both of these things and does them well.

Their chicken fingers are large, juicy pieces of meat that never have gristle or other bits to them, just high-quality white meat. Well sauced in a reasonable variety, they're quite good. Steak fries are steak fries, and that's half the battle!

Four stars because I've had a wrap here before that was not good, and last time they forgot the ranch with my to-go order. What are chicken fingers without ranch?!",QCoBkB_m0v9smTM9voMZMg,0,1,4,XUswoBDgB2irUfzKfquNmA

5563546,2011-02-21,0,ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,"Will be forever known in my book as Montana sh*thouse.

Upon entry my boyfriend and I stood uncomfortably for a few minutes waiting to be seated. Expecting a hostess to appear, we were then told rudely by the bartender who was free to tell us this the second we entered, but chose to let us stand there for 2 minutes, that we could seat ourselves.

We then waited around 15 minutes to place our order. I had the BBQ burger, my advice is go to carls and get the western bacon.
My bf chose the peppercorn burger- big mistake! It came with a patty covered in what looked like mushroom soup, with the fries receiving the same treatment, no onion ring straws, or cheese which was on the menu. He had one bite before deciding it was unedible. We wouldve loved to replace the burger with another item except our waitress/ bartender didn't return to the table till I had all ready finished my meal.

Food was ok/unedible.

Atmosphere was stale/smokey.

Service was non existent.

Server said just enough words to get our order, was rude, and treated us as if our presence annoyed her. When someones entire dinner is untouched save for one bite, common sense says maybe something was wrong. Server said nothing and whisked the full plate away.

I've had horrible service in the past, and have never stiffed anyone. But as the saying goes, there's a first time for everything, and Montana meat co was my first.

And as for their endless fries, maybe if you went in the kitchen and cooked them yourself, we were never asked.

Rating is zero stars, but I had to choose at least one to save this review.",F8yZF-IoyZVyPmMtCOwX-A,1,0,1,4oidfaduODsUEqHJQ60-OQ

We never heard about the specials, I had to get up from the table and look myself. After we ordered everything came out lightning fast. App, salad and entree so quick I thought they wanted us gone. The appetizer was spinach/artichoke dip. Mayonnaise with some spinach and artichoke put in then heated. Horrible! The salad was just a salad. Nothing to write about. I had the macadamia crusted  halibut. It was nothing special. My husband ordered a steak medium rare, it came out almost raw. Our son had sliders. They were so dry I'm guessing they were cooked earlier and then reheated. The overall experience was completely disappointing. If it was reasonably priced I might not have even bothered to post a review and just never went back. But for $68 dollars, even for 3 people, I expect a little more.

Took my brother to Montana Meat Company as it is close to home and it had good reviews 

Well the food was average for a pub style eatery. 
The steak special was nicely priced for what we got   

Food seemed freshly prepared and the meat was cooked to order. The potatoes were a bit undercooked for my liking.  
The bread was probably the best part of the meal, hot and fresh.  

The service in the other hand was below average for what I would if excepted from the reviews 

Slow service of the staff, it was a bit unorganized between the server, hostess and the food runner.

Their salads are so fresh with the best homemade ranch dressing.  I have ordered the prime rib and cowboy rib eye and both have been excellent.  The homemade bread is so yummy that I can make a meal off of it alone.  The staff are so sweet and constantly checking on you.  You will not be waiting on anything because there are always enough waiters around helping out. We asked to see the manager which happened to be one of the owners and he was very sweet and told us how long all his waiters have been with him which was 4 yrs to 12 yrs.

5694416,2017-06-11,0,ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,"My wife and I really like Montana Meat Company and come here often.  Food is always good and portions are large.  The Chicken Mac and Cheese on the ""Specials"" Menu is amazing.  My wife always gets it.  

The burgers are really solid.  I'm a bit of a burger snob, so they're not the best I've had by any means, but they're definitely good!  Especially the Peppercorn Burger and the Rocky Mtn burger.

Overall, the food is good, very reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly.

The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it's more of a ""nice bar with better than average food"" than a ""Steakhouse or Meat Company"" that you might think based on the name of the restaurant.  

I'm from Montana and I was expecting to have at least a Bison steak or Buffalo burger on the menu.  If they wanted to be really true to the name, there should be some elk or venison somewhere.  Maybe it's harder to have wild game on a restaurant menu in Las Vegas than I'm imagining, but either way, whenever we go there, I always have a tinge of regret that there aren't actually any ""Montana Meat's"".",TVDbNGDO2jMRvnDqHLB9Ew,0,1,4,RIX4PZvo5dtaDNpFzNsmPQ
5715779,2016-03-14,11,ZtsnwjxjzMUI6tDZNrJUeA,"Went on Sunday 3-13-16 at about 7:30 PM for dinner.  This restaurant is located on Blue Diamond and Durango.  The ambiance is casual and it does have a bar inside but it's separated from the dining area so kiddos are welcome, although we didn't get a high chair or booster seat.  Imagine a 24-hour Applebee's.  

$87.28 got us a t-bone steak dinner, a filet dinner, a kids quesadilla, a side caesar salad, two soft drinks, and a lobster tail.  

Both our dinners were supposed to come with bread and butter but neither ever came.  I didn't bother to ask about it.  

Our server was nice enough but disappeared for long stretches and had an inappropriate amount of cleavage showing.  I am no prude, but if I can see your sternum you need to cover up a bit.  

She did let me order first for my boy which I thought was very thoughtful and understanding of the impatient nature of toddlers.  His kid's quesadilla disappeared quickly and I snagged a few of his crispy steak fries and they were delicious.  

The caesar salad was fair.  The romaine lettuce was crisp, and it had just the right amount of tasty dressing, croutons, and parmesan cheese.  It was a pretty big portion for $3.00 but the lettuce seemed to be the bagged variety or perhaps chopped a few days in advance because the edges of each piece were browning.  

$28.95 T-bone steak was cooked well and came with a baked potato and broccoli.  Husband said the flavor was good and boy, was it big!  The $23.95 filet dinner came with the same two sides and was thick, juicy, and perfectly cooked.  I found myself wanting a bit of A-1 but, alas, our well-endowed server was not to be found.  The broccoli was bizarre because each of us got maybe 4-5 florets but they had huge stalks still attached.  Pretty cheap veg if you ask me.  

$15.95 lobster tail was the star of the show. It was huge, cooked perfectly, well seasoned, and so sweet.  Probably one of the best lobster tails I've ever had.  It came with drawn butter and three lemons and I coulda probably ate three more.  

Food was passable but for almost a hundred bucks after tip I won't be back due to the long distance from my house.  You can get better food elsewhere, cheaper, and faster.  Their most popular item is two steak dinners for under $40 and I would definitely stick with that because they come with sides and salad or soup for that price and that would be a deal.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,19,16,3,GhKxwM0RQrMzT3Hipl8ydQ

Everything was absolutely palatable. Our steaks were cooked perfectly the way we want it. The rib eyes came with baked potato and string beans; never mind the sides just focus on the main dish! (I'm not really big on baked potato and string beans) our meal also came with salads.

My friend and I came in around 7 craving burgers. We decided to split a pastrami patty melt and a BBQ bacon burger, one with fries and the other with onion rings for good measure. 

I sampled the BBQ bacon burger first and was not excited in the least. I commented to my friend that it tasted just like a bacon western burger only four times the price. A few seconds later our server came by to check on us and commented about how much she likes the BBQ bacon burger because it tastes like a western bacon cheeseburger. Guess I was right! I didn't care for the BBQ said very much so I stuck with the pastrami patty melt, which was decent. The fries and onion rings were a lackluster way to round out our meal.

Our server who I believe was also the bartender was very short with us to begin with. I ordered a French onion soup to start, and a chicken parm sandwich. My boyfriend ordered chicken tenders with sauce on the side. The soup came out within a reasonable amount of time. We waited for over a half hour for the rest of our food. When we finally got the server/ bartender's attention and  he said that the cooks accidentally put sauce on to the chicken tenders. Knowing that my boyfriend wouldn't eat the tenders with sauce on them I expressed that to our server. The server replied to me that he had a feeling that my boyfriend wouldn't eat them like that. He sat my chicken parmesan sandwich down on the table and walked away. 
He never said that he was going to refire the chicken tenders or anything. Nor did he bring us to share plate to share my sandwich. My boyfriend and I were sitting there in total confusion wondering if chicken tenders were eventually going to come out or if we were just supposed to share my sandwich.I got up to grab another servers attention and told him that we were about to leave because we were so frustrated with our service. The other server turned his back to me and said your servers over there and pointed to the bar. He literally put his back in my face.

Before you profess on how it's hard to get those type of finger foods wrong, let me stop you.  I'm a finger food fiend and not all chicken fingers were created equal. Montana nailed it perfectly.
