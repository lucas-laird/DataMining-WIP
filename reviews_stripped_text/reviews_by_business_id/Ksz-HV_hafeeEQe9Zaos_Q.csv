If you like noodle dishes, soups, and world-class fusion cuisine, definitely give this new restaurant a try.  The food are deliciously prepared with fresh flavorful ingredients, the service is attentive, and the prices are very reasonable.

We enjoyed the Kao-soi, the World Noodle Tom Yum, and the Tonkasu (to which I added chilis and garlic).  The food was outstanding!  For dessert, try a scoop of their asian ice cream offerings.  

There were only a couple of reasons I didn't give this place five stars.  1) The calamari appetizer I ordered was not great; and 2) The portions could have been a little bit more generous.  I wouldn't normally say this but they might consider raising the menu item prices just a tad so they can be a little bit more generous with regard to portion sizes.  

Whatever the case, I wholeheartedly feel that this restaurant is one of the best in the Spring Mountain ""Asia-town area of Las Vegas.  If you enjoy World Fusion cuisine and noodl/soup dishes, don't miss this new Spring Mountain-area gem!",_d7Wy2vcdrXxr5chUgb1bg,1,0,4,1J-EH1VeCowdYzFxcEkiLw

644040,2014-01-29,0,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"I went here on Sunday night with some friends around 7 pm. Only one other party in the restaurant.  The decor was decent, nothing too memorable, but at least there was some decor and it was clean.  The waitress was very nice and we were promptly seated and she took our drink order immediately. I asked her what she recommended overall and she said the miso ramen, shoyu ramen and beef stew. I think it was beef stew, I can't remember the name, but it was the on the right side bottom of the menu on the noodle page... 

I tried the miso ramen. I didn't particularly care for it, I am used to the tonkotsu broth and I think that this was just miso based. I thought the broth lacked flavor and the noodles they used were instant. Which would make sense as that is what they were advertised on the wall. Not impressed with the use of instant noodles. 

Also, had the takoyaki - I admit I have a high standard for takoyaki as I grew up eating it in Japan. This did not fit the bill, but was a good effort, there was one small piece of octopus in the middle. I am pretty sure they balls were fried and not steamed, nonetheless I enjoyed them as it has been too long since I have had any. 

Everyone else seemed to be happy with their choices and the server refilled my husband's countless ice teas without complaint.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,3,_1Z-lCl5QkJZPCIwIUe2iw

World Noodle has Asian noodle dishes from around the world and it's perfect when you can't decide if you want thai, japanese, vietnamese, and so on. I've been here a few times and it has not disappointed me yet. The price is just right for the portion and the food is authentic. The first time I came here I was worried that they wouldn't be able to capture the flavors of various cultures; I thought their menu was too diverse and there was no way they could make good Japanese food while making good thai food, but turns out I was wrong. Everything is delicious! My one recommendation to anyone who comes here is to eat the Roti on the appetizer menu, it is my favorite!!! For dinner, I recommend the pad tai, now normally I wouldn't recommend it anywhere else, but here the pad tai is so traditional and there is no other place that makes it like this.

We ate there on 1/1/14 for lunch, and the small place was packed. We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. The waitress said only two people were working that day, but still. 

About 45 minutes into our wait, still no appetizer, they started serving tables that had been seated AFTER us. We said something and the waitress was apologetic. 

Another 5-10 minutes went by and the appetizer (pot stickers) and the main courses arrived simultaneously. That was 100% predictable, although the tables that had been seated after us received a proper sequence. My dish, my favorite Thai noodle dish whose spelling escapes me at the moment, was utterly tasteless. I mean nothing. The wife got some kind of curry with broth. The beef was tender but the broth was so salty that it was inedible. Shortly after we ate my stomach started to feel funky. 

The men's room had no paper towels. The women's room had towels but no soap. The two people working were women so you don't want to think about the restaurant not having soap in the restroom.

Their papaya salad, beef salad, and the rice & chicken dish were delicious as well! The rice and chicken dish may be bland, but if you ask for the ginger fish sauce with hot peppers, it serves as a perfect dipping sauce for it.

Spiciness level is on a 1-10 scale, with 1 being no spice and 10 being very spicy.

I noticed that they serve ramen and some sort of Korean soup stew dish. In my opinion, I think it's best to stick to the South East Asian soups since it seems like their Thai owned. Just a thought.",Gj_uWlC10B9C-oVOMdHXdQ,1,1,4,Ks9b9WI49tRKySJ3NyLAJg
4014392,2014-02-20,0,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"I really wanted to give World Noodle more stars but I just can't come around to do it.  It is kinda like its predecessor Anime Noodle, not bad but not amazing either.  What is it...the location??  I just wasn't overall super impressed for what the place is supposed to be.

We came on a super busy Friday night on a weekend where it was around Chinese New Year.  There was no parking AT ALL in the mall where World Noodle is located so we had to park in the mall right next door.  Only problem was, security was there that night to tell us if we didn't purchase anything from the mall, our car could be towed!  WTH?  Many people were doing the same thing by the way.  So we quickly went to Mr. Sandwich and purchased a #1 House Special sandwich to go.  Almost $4 later and a receipt to show the security guard we walked back over to World Noodle.

I'm not gonna say this was an omen but when we walked in to World Noodle, it was darn near a ghost town.  Only 3-4 tables were taken with patrons, the rest were empty.  This is just coming from outside now...where Sushi Kaya next door had a waiting line outside, and the restaurants upstairs were full of patrons.  What gives?  I swear it is the location of any restaurant that sets up shop here in this corner.  Bad news.

We are greeted and seated promptly then shown to a table.  The menus are very nice, I'll give World Noodle that.  Very bright, easy to read, colorful, and with pictures!  We wanted to visit because we heard the Big Kahuna here (Chef Amy) is a very good and well known Thai chef.  This is supposed to be her baby.

After getting our drinks we get around to ordering.  The little one got a regular order or Crispy Chicken ($8.50), and the wifey got the Beef Chow Fun ($7.95?).  I ended up getting the special Mini Noodle Hot Pot ($10.99) because of the flyer on the table.  I chose the Tom Yum soup with beef, and ramen noodles.  

Within 15 minutes our food started to come out from the kitchen.  I try to be more portion-controlled now-a-days but...it seemed like so little food!  That was my main gripe.  The portion of Crispy Chicken was like one row of a small chicken breast or thigh, barely enough to feed my growing 11 year old.  It tasted good and well flavored, but looking at the chicken on the inside, seemed like it was pounded pretty flat before frying.  My kid ended up still hungry and sharing our food.  The wifey's Beef Chow Fun was just how I like it, with green onions and bean sprouts.  But again, the portion was on the small side!  Luckily my wife was willing to share, it tasted good.  My Mini Noodle Hot Pot was just that, mini.  The picture makes it look bigger, but trust me, it's mini!  So yes, World Noodle is right on that one.  This hot pot is great for maybe one little person, but a guy like me, I'm looking for a bit more substance.  Bad thing is, it was good!  The Tom Yum soup was super spicy (which I didn't mind but my kid did), and the thin beef cooked well in the broth along with the other included goodies like the cabbage and enoki mushrooms.  The ramen was good in the soup, but again...so little to go around!  It was a small portion of ramen.  I wish I could have had more to begin with, but I was a bit ashamed to ask, nor was I offered it.  By the time I was done, I had so much leftover Tom Yum soup boiling away in my mini hot pot with nothing else to put in.  Such a shame.  So, so sad.  

Tasty food was a plus.  Tiny portions was a minus.  But service was prompt and very friendly, no complaints there.  Price for what you get would be more reasonable if the portions were just a bit bigger.  On our way out we were envious of all the folks in Kaya Sushi doing AYCE sushi!  Damn buggers!  So we did leave still a bit hungry.  Luckily I had that #1 House Special sandwich from Mr. Sandwich waiting for me.  Just me.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,0,3,WWxhuVVLQTxDbjTswYSXcQ

Yes, this is the old Anime place, and the maid place which I did not get to try. It is next door to Kaya Sushi. 

We ordered the Roti to start and it was one of the best in Las Vegas, next to Island Malaysian and Veggie House. It was freshly sauteed and fluffy. The sauce was slightly spicy but nothing too fancy (because the Roti was the star). 

I read the restaurant was opened by Thai people so I was hesitant about ordering anything not Thai or Southeast Asian, but my Ramen craving was still going strong, so I had to try their Tonkatsu Ramen. The ramen was the thin noodle kind, with a really tasty, savory and sticky broth. The pork was tender, sliced really thin, and was surprisingly good. The major difference was that there were fried shallots added, and that totally changed the flavor profile, in a good way.   

I was also able to try a slice of the roasted pork from another noodle soup dish, and again, it was surprisingly good, sliced thin and flavorful.

I'm always craving the combination of spicy with a touch of sweet and sour and the noodle bowls hit the spot! I've been here 3X in the last week. 

This new place should not be mistaken for what used to be here, which was anime ramen which then turned to maid ramen. Unlike the former, it actually has good food and I like that there's two sizes (small and large).

The Thai boat noodle and the roast duck noodle are really good. I tried the ramen and it was only ok. Seeing that it's a Thai owned restaurant, in my opinion, I'd recommend sticking with the Thai dishes. (Note: the roast duck is more thai flavored...not like the one you would find at Chinese restaurants).

Since I can't go to LA or SF to get my fix, this is the closest I've come to eating Thai boat noodle in Vegas that's comparable. I usually get an 8, which is just perfect for me.

They are more of a Thai/Chinese fusion cuisine, which seems to be the next big thing nowadays.  They had these Thai dumplings, wrapped in cooked mochis with either taro, chives or bamboos.  We tried all three prepared fried, and they were good to try if you like cooked mochi and these somewhat authentic dishes.  

I had their special noodle (I can't remember the name now;  I think it was the World Noodle?), and it was decent.  It was exactly how I had expected it but a bit sweeter than I thought it should be.  The bf ordered the duck noodle, and it was much sweeter than what we thought it should be since the soup was more of a soy sauce base.  

To make it a bit more harder to give it more stars than I want to, we were the only patrons there when we arrived a little past five.  We were still the only patrons there when we left 40 minutes later.  

Like I said, if you're looking to venture into a new restaurant for the sake of going to a new restaurant, by all means, go grab a bowl of noodle at World Noodle.  But if you're in the mood for some comfort-food noodle, World Noodle may not be for you...",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,2,0,3,vcHer5rHz6GMDYLyTqJJtQ

- Had the Thai Boat(?) Noodle, which was ok.  With tax it came out to $9.12.
- Nice place, decor hasn't really changed since the place was Anime Ramen.
- Good service.  Waitress forgot to provide napkins (and there were none on the table) but not a big deal.
- Will give the eatery another try, probably the dry (ie no soup) Drunken Noodle dish.",0nqshyLgABOSyTfJUTthjQ,2,0,3,BSnTGcp8UghNGTD2bLSBjA
5084117,2014-08-07,3,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"We came to eat here during dinner hours. The parking lot to the plaza was packed, but when we walked in here, the place was dead and empty. And after my experience here, I can see why. 
This place is garbage. If I could give it zero stars, I would. 

First off, TERRIBLE customer service. We were literally the only people in the place, and the waitress was bumbling about in such a rush she didn't even take a our drink order. She just brought us both water (which neither of us wanted). Also didn't ask what level of spiciness we wanted our food to be, they asked that every time we came in before and she seemed irritated when I reminded her. She was unhappy and angry we were there.

We both got the Singapore Noodle, which ""vegetables"" consisted of a lot of onions and just a few slices of peppers. How cheap. Cheap as in low quality food. The prices are anything but. A handful of salad in a sauce bowl is $5.00.

As we reached the end of our meal, I had a whole half of my meal left on my plate, my boyfriend asked, word for word ""a to-go box and the check"". She grabbed up our plates and threw them in the back, in the trash. No mediocre noodles for me to snack on later. Lame. 

This place is just plain BAD and you should invest your money in another one of the great restaurants in the area.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,2,0,1,FW1UN_ySPCW5xHAH7XwttA
5433921,2014-06-25,0,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"A pleasant guy suggested we try this place out, and I certainly was curious since it was one of the places I wanted to try out but the BF and fam love this other restaurant down the street (which i will make a review bc it actually is a decent place) ... We were in line at 99 Ranch and the guy was like ""try Noodle World""

With the help of Yelp, we located World Noodle, we didn't care if it wasn't the place that was originally suggested and we sat down to order.

I'm a fan of these thai fusion menus ... side order fiend as well ;) 

For a group of 8 we ordered a bunch of different dishes ... so let this be a review on what we ordered:

some of the side dishes we ordered we're okay but i would say $5 for 2 pieces of roti is overpriced. 

The soups were very tasty and piping hot.

I chose the spicy basil and enjoyed it ...

The waitress was very courteous and patient when we asked her to split the bill.. Of course, napkins and utensils didn't appear until a bit before our food arrived but i'm not complaining. 

Overall the service was okay, food was very good and the variety was pretty decent. I mean if I lived in Vegas and had to choose where to eat, I'd drag them to World Noodle every once in awhile. The prices overall for different dishes were very fair.",UxLiPXkpSDuj9TB6dYwbXw,0,0,4,3ZsI2PDJNo5wn_j0Xsg38w
5599527,2014-01-10,1,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"I love me some noodles, so why not give this place a shot.  The name alone says a lot, just know, there is much more to the menu than just long stringy carbs.

The joint was clean and well lit, unlike the previous owner, Anime Ramen.  Still, some manga chicks would have set it off.  The decor was also neat and tidy, incorporating straight high back wooden booths you typically see in Thai restaurants made in teak.  It's rather quiet and intimate if one is looking for that.  

So since World Noodle also dishes out  entree's and appetizer's, it offers a vast assortment for whatever your mood may be.  With the variety provided, like another Yelper pointed out, it's beneficial to have images included with the descriptions.  I also dig how the menus are in reverse, true ninja ish.  

The waiter, a quiet young gentlemen, suggested the World Noodle, apparently their flagship dish.  My partner powered the beef noodle soup with ramen noodles.  I added papaya salad as an app as well.  The waiter asked what spice level I desired, usually a tell tale sign that they packing some heat!  Also, this was another indicator that the owner could be Thai.  I got the bowl at a 7 and the salad at an 8, respectively.

The papaya Salad came out rather quick and was pretty tasty.  It was a little on the sweet side, but packed some good spice.  Once the bowls arrived, I noticed that they were well presented, hot and ready to eat.  I always test the broth and can't say that I have tarred anything like this on the past.  I was expecting something more like tom yum soup, however, it was way more sweet.  The char siu was tender and the fish balls and cake were soft.  Vermicelli noodles were included, but egg noodles can be an alternative.  Mid way through the bowl, the unique flavor begin to resonate.  It was a creeper, but was delicious with each slurp I took..  My buddy is reluctant at times with trying new places, although, once he have his approval, I knew that this place was good to go.

Solution the check with the waiter was painless and pleasant.  Unlike previous comments about the wait stash being unhelpful on the past, this was not the case during our visit.  I think the warden would approve as well and has bookmarked this spot for the future

I later found that the owner is of Thai descent, so you know they can throw down.  Just a fun find for myself, I like to keep entertained.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,5,3,4,RP7KWZJv23f5fOkWHYf0GQ
5778712,2014-01-27,1,Ksz-HV_hafeeEQe9Zaos_Q,"It's a great concept - no more arguing over what kind of asian to get, everybody can have the asian cuisine they want in one place. Unfortunately, execution...not so good. I feel kind of bad leaving 2 stars - I wanted to like this place since the servers and chefs were very sweet. Unfortunately, 3 out of 3 things we ordered were not very good, and it's doubtful that I'll give this place another try. 

Shoyu ramen was bland and pretty tasteless, pad see ew was decent but the sauce was weirdly sweet. I didn't care for the flavor, but my friend who had never had pad see ew anywhere else said it was pretty good. The roast duck soup w/ ramen had a fair amount of boneless roast duck, but like the pad see ew, the flavor of the broth was extremely sweet. The noodles in both soups were also soft and slightly overcooked. 

Other reviews seem overall positive, so maybe we just chose the wrong things to try. I won't be back, but world noodle is maybe worth trying if you research what's good. Another thing to note is that the majority of the pics on yelp are posted by the business, so they're staged, not really user pics. The yelp app doesn't show who posted pics, so I didn't know until I got to the restaurant and saw the same pics printed in their menu. A little misleading...",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,7,3,2,b75DYYlzcoioJeUlJV9K3g
