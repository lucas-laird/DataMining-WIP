1903672,2017-09-21,0,Nmka2Jw1HrC2IfuEADOwZg,First time here and this place was really good. Got the roast pork with black beans and rice and fried sweet plantains. $8.50 for the roast pork entree which comes with two sides of your choosing. The black beans and rice had perfect texture (not wet and not dry) and a wonderful flavor that didn't overpower the rest of the meal. The roast pork was sliced thin and tender with a ton of flavor. So much flavor and nothing tasted salty. Just got back to work and I'm still thinking about that meal and those sweet plantains. Can't wait to go back. It's going to be hard to order anything else. Side note: my work wife ordered the Cuban sandwich and it was huge. He loved it and he's stuffed.,day9dFcIcPr0KjcxjugKaA,1,1,5,w6mCoQh0hkr8eAL03p9Ghg

3382408,2018-03-28,0,Nmka2Jw1HrC2IfuEADOwZg,"Very disappointed with this place and the treatment, took a friend of mine there and upon looking at the menu I saw that it had quite a few Cuban dishes, as a Cuban I was on Cloud 9 only to be disappointed that no one came to our table to take our order, the place was only half full , not that they were super busy.
After about half an hour of waiting I approached the manager or cook or owner , hard to tell what hat he was wearing.
He had the nerve to tell me that this wasn't a buffet style place and every dish was made to order, I told him that I hadn't even placed an order yet and what in the world did the food had to do with service and taking our order, he mumbled something under his breath at that point I figured it was senseless to keep talking to this man , told my friend to pick up his coat and LETS GO!!!
It will be a cold day in hell before I go back over there and will make sure I tell everyone that is contemplating going there to rethink their choice.
Can't comment about the food , whether good or bad because never got to eat.....Stay Away and save yourself the aggravation...",_6ewoRtRlp31kTLgVxgkbA,0,0,1,ZG1ECjNwMxAyD_s8bSk-5Q

5362907,2018-03-26,1,Nmka2Jw1HrC2IfuEADOwZg,"Hubby says this place isn't authentic, but the owners were Cuban and everyone eating there was Cuban so you have to give them some credit! I really enjoyed the food here too. We both ordered Pollo a la Plancha con Moros y Plantains. You get to pick two sides and these were the ones we both chose. I also ordered a Jupiña because why not. :) The chicken wasn't cooked in a flat iron like it is traditionally. It was still marinated heavily in delicious, citrusy Mojo. The plantains were sweet and the moros was made well. We even ordered some guava pastelitos on the way out! These were so fresh and tasty.

We were looking for a new Cuban spot since our other go-to place charges almost $20 a plate. Both our meals combined with our pastries came to only $20. Fingers crossed Hubby takes me back here!",oQ0m7zCcppNT-8jMbPC6DQ,1,1,4,aZtXJVoKLKyauo3sERm7DQ

My mom and I sat down on a Sunday afternoon, the place wasn't busy at all. The waitress was very nice and friendly, loved she acknowledged my small daughter every time. We ordered Spanish chorizo pizza, spaghetti napolitano (cheese and marinara sauce) and a typical Cuban dish : congri (rice) tostones ( plantain) and grilled fish; also had a guava milkshake that was creamy and very flavorful.
The meal was excellent in flavor and very filling.
Lastly they have a selection of desserts on display and we got 2 tartaletas ( guava and coconut) the guava was better in my opinion.
The prices were very reasonable. Ended up paying around $33 for everything..( also included a children's meal) 
We will definitely be back on another time :)",F-InTCr2BZHQLM-jNThzBw,3,3,5,Bsh-Hi1qEEArwKoZ14dlaw
5649146,2018-03-03,0,Nmka2Jw1HrC2IfuEADOwZg,"Two stars for the employees that are nice and the place is clean.  

They were serving something not sure  what it was, maybe the rice out of a container that was just sitting out. There is a photo I took of the container. 

The food is awful. I really  wanted to come in here and love the place.  We moved from Florida and we'd get some really good Cuban food there. This is some awful food. I'm not so sure how they stay open. 

I ordered the ropa vieja it tasted old, full of salt and garlic. The rice and beans again salty and awful. My entire dish was cold and none of it was fresh tasting. 

When they brought out my plate and my sons pizza (which was hot straight from the oven) but the pizza didn't taste fresh; they didnt bring my husbands sandwich and fries. I was already done with my old stale food when they brought my husbands Cubans sandwich with cold fries.  

This place could have some real potential.",Wk--RNQokW9Jrj2vJuWBww,2,1,2,Nyx5NwgltI3vxvkc9G_EqA
