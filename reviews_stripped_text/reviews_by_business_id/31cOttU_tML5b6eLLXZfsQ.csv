They have a great lunch special (11am-3pm cut-off time 2:30pm) for $12.99 you get ramen of your choice, 1 chasu, choice of karaage (fried chicken)-fried rice or 5pc gyoza and 1 lemon sorbet. A really great deal! 
They also have a stamp card if you fall in love with their ramen and decide to eat there more than once. 
Overall one of my new fave ramen place here in Vegas.",AuIK5tF2GjO7SftHawTLKw,2,0,5,jy2hXP_dQmjKnQ-RYitnbg

The sushi cones are also to die for and perfect for a quick snack or an addition to another entree - All the fixings of an order of sushi but in easier to handle packaging. The japanese-style chicken is the best fried chicken i've ever had, miles better than most local fast food places. A Overall great experience and the Japanese staff gives it an authenic Eastern Fast Food vibe which is a nice addition in the thralls of sit down Asian restaurants in (and out of) Chinatown.
An absolute must go for the Japanese food enthusiast and a great place to go for those who want Japanese food - without the wait.",VVe84NjFL7H3wri3Qdx9nA,0,0,5,hJWlcryzgZZ5n_HeMkBTqA

Maybe I'm just used to eat tasty good ramen and karaage lol.. They are msg free they don't use msg at all maybe that's why the broth is bland but not really sure.

The decor was simple and as un-Vegas as you can get.  No glitz, no glam, just some darn good ramen.  My friend and I both got the Kome Cha Shu Ramen at the recommendation of the waitress. It did not disappoint. It was teeming with porky goodness. The Cha Shu was a combination of super soft melt in your mouth fat and pork meat.  Every bite of it was both soft and firm at the same time.  The noodles had a perfect firmness and the broth was very rich and flavorful.

Bottom line:  If you're tired of ""celebrity"" chefs.  If you're tired of gambling on food as well as table games. If you're craving great food at a great value. Please give Misoya Tomi a visit!",tK-QVgmUgoirYWPGU8yGdA,0,0,5,ZFECL6grmK8CZF5WQOS2cw

The couple times I've been here I've had the same Japanese waitress who is extremely polite. I find it very entertaining when she tries to communicate but can't find the words to say. I could say that some people might have a hard time and become frustrated when they have questions, but this is a non issue for me. 

There is also a big screen TV to watch sports or whatever you want while you wait for or while eating your food.

341609,2014-08-16,0,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"I dropped by this place as a recommendation, and I wasn't exactly impressed. I didn't think it was stellar, but it was still above average. I'd give it a 3.5 for food and 5 for service. 

My party and I started out with the gyoza appetizer. I don't remember the exact taste of it, but I didn't think it was bad. The gyoza was average. Afterwards, I ordered the Shiro Miso Ramen, and the three delicious things that stuck out to me were the broth, the noodles and the pork. Most broth at ramen places are extremely salty, but this place wasn't. I, for the first time ever, was able to drink the broth without drinking a gallon of water afterwards. The noodles were definitely the best part. Super soft and mhmm. After eating what I could of my bowl (huuuuuuge portions), I picked out the strands of noodles. And the pork. Like I mentioned earlier, huuuuuge portions, and huuuuge portions of pork. At the end of our meal, they serve complimentary lychee sorbet. With the heat of ramen, it definitely hit the spot! Sweet, but not too sweet. 

And now the bad. :( I thought this place was a bit overpriced for what we were getting. Huge portions are great, but quality over quantity. I remember my bowl being roughly $12, but  after adding the egg and seaweed, my bowl came out to roughly $15? With the price, I would have thought that the egg would have been included, but it wasn't. I would have enjoyed a smaller bowl with a variety of ingredients. They also add bean sprouts, and I found that a bit weird. I don't think ramen and bean sprouts go together. 

But all in all, there is room for improvement. :)",8u40NmUttgpEpAJr249Fcg,1,0,3,FXhqmL8DkvYC_ZPpR0uHIQ

Tried both the Cha-shu Hokkaido style and Kyoto style on two separate days and I have to say I personally prefer the Hokkaido style better than Kyoto style. Service was great and the Cha-shu was much thicker than other ramen places I've eaten at before which is a plus. The inside was not as decorated as other ramen places I've visited before but I say it's a trade off for great tasting ramen. Comes with sorbet at the end which is also great.

Las Vegas has become the ramen capital of the Western Hemisphere.  I know that sounds a bit daft, but hear me out.  I travel to Japan regularly, heck I've, sadly, been to the Ramen Museum in Yokohama twice.  I even just returned from Kyoto, where I ate what was supposed to be their best ramen.  Honestly, it wasn't even close to what I just had at Misoya Tomi.  The owners have recently arrived from Osaka, but I've never had ramen this good when I was actually in Osaka.  The only ramen that compares is also served in Las Vegas, but by a Michelin starred chef (Omae).

So there we were on Saturday night (dinner time) and the place was not busy; just a few other customers aside from us. Waitress was polite and fulfilled our requests promptly. So service was good. 

Now onto the food; I ordered Hokkaido Style chasu ramen while my husband ordered Nagoya style chasu ramen (because she said Nagoya's broth has the thickest/heaviest flavor, while Hokkaido's medium flavored). We also ordered chicken karage, gyoza, and takoyaki. 

At a few first spoons, I found my Hokkaido broth quite tasty, just a little salty. But after those few spoons, the saltiness took over and became unberable, to the point I couldn't even finish it. I can't say much about Nagoya broth because I only took a spoon from my husband's bowl and it didn't appeal enough to me to take the second spoon. I think the soybean paste overpowered the whole taste to the point it almost taste bitter. 

The ramen itself was cooked well, the portion is kinda on the small side though. The chasu was thick but it didn't have that melt in my mouth quality. 

Takoyaki was good. Chicken karage was bland. Gyoza never made it to our table.

I got the ""Kyoto"" style ramen with just one chashu and it was enough. The chashu ramen comes with three. Each slice is thick cut with a savory crisped outer skin which really adds to the flavor variety. It was almost moist on the inside which is somewhat rare for chashu.

My friend got the ""Nagoya"" style and said it was good too. Although there is ""Nagoya"", ""Kyoto"" and ""Hokkaido"" styles they are actually all Hokkaido style with the curly noodles and miso base. Don't expect actual Nagoya or Kyoto style ramen as they are a completely different ramen altogether.

First impression is a Japanese ""shokudo"" (cafeteria...but in a good way).  everyone that works here is Japanese.  First good sign.  they have menus in English...however, if you can read Japanese (including some KANJI), there are more choices. Second good sign as it reminded me of dining in Ramen shops in Japan.
Orderd the cha-siu siro miso ramen ($11.80)...a touch pricier than what I and used to and order of gyoza ($4).  Ramen portion is big (Ohmori) along with polishing off the broth and gyoza plus a cold green tea, I was stuffed!  delicious doesn't do the ramen justice...and the cha-siu (bbq pork), kudos to Japanese for making an already delicious and popular chinese item and making it their's and better!  It tasted like a roasted pork...mmmm.  gyoza was cooked perfectly as well...I couldn't tell whether they were made in house or not...I wish I lived here so I can come all the time...will try to come back @ least one more time before I leave on Tuesday.
Even got a complimentary dessert; uzu sherbet...yum!

I'm from Japan, I know what the REAL Ramen restaurant is.
I was pretending just a local customer, who doesn't speak and/or read Japanese at all. (Just wanted to enjoy their ramen without ANY prejudice.)

However, a female Japanese server came and greet me. Do you know what she said to me?! 
""Yo, buddy!""

Ha?!?! What, what did you say to me?!
Excuse me???

Have you ever been greeted at beginning from a server like that?

I should have understood that maybe she just came from Japan, going to school to learn English and so on.
Well, yet it was just a first greeting, despite absolutely it was embracing as a professional. 
Even her explanations regarding  difference between three Types of Miso ramen was not understandable at all. 

I tasted their Ramen but it was too odd.
I don't get why they are using a lot of cabbages for toppings. I think that makes soup too ""wishy-washy"".

Unfortunately I saw some of more ""unprofessionalism"" at there. Not only the server but also two male Japanese cooks kept chatting so that made me disgusted since it was overwhelmed side talks.  
My stomach was full with just ""so-so"" Ramen while the nasty loud background music and the two cooks inappropriate side talk were being kept played around me. Very uncomfortable place anyways!

The restaurant was a joke. 

I felt like after having watched cheap Samurai B-Class movie at a theater where was cheaply done. 
Meaning, yes, Japanese people are running the ramen business with no knowledge and lack of professionalism in foreign country. 
I don't think they will be able to survive this hard competition which is in the name of ""over supplied Ramen business in Las Vegas"". 

Good luck! Gambatte!

Let me start off by saying they do not know how to answer a phone. Called their twice and a gentleman just picks up the phone and says hello never stating the business name. First time I thought I had the wrong number and when I tried to explain what I wanted he handed the phone off to someone else. It happened again the second time I called as well.  They definitely need to get better phone customer service for sure.

Tried the fried goyza as an appetizer. Nothing special there. The sauce they gave you with it is super spicy. So beware. Then ordered the Hokkaido style cha shu ramen which turned out to be prety salty compared to the Kyoto style ramen which they deem being as being fruity. The cha shu pork wasn't tender enough to fall apart when trying to cut it up with chopsticks and a spoon like other ramen places. Bamboo shoots we're extremely hard and tough as well. Noodles seemed strange to me compared to other ramen joints also. Did like the fact that they gave you ground pork in there as well is that with the first time I've tried that and all the ramen experiences I've had which is quite a few.

Overall for the price it was a very large portion and through the end of July they have freebies on extra noodles and extra corn so you don't have to pay for it. Ended up taking half of it home and l'll have a nice lunch for tomorrow. I just need to remember to drink lots of water to flush the salt from my system. Service was very good despite the AC not working.

I guess over all the 3 stars is because their AC was not working and I just did not like the ramen very much compared to other places such as Monta Chaya, Ramen Sora or Fukumimi.

1691318,2015-11-22,3,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"Coming from the LA ramen scene, I expected long lunch lines after 30 minutes past their opening hour, but I was happy to see plenty of seating was available. Seeing that we weren't locals, our waitress explained their three ramen choices:

- Kome Miso (Hokkaido style) - best selling flavor
- Shiro Miso (Kyoto Style) - regular miso soup 
- Mame Miso (Nagoya Style) - they use red miso for their ""bold"" flavor

Personally, I'm not a fan of red miso because the flavoring is too intense for my tastes. So my wife and I opted for the Kome and Shiro lunch set. The lunch set comes with bamboo, green onions, corn, bean sprouts, a slice of chashu, and your choice of thick or thin cut noodles. Additionally, we both ordered the karage chicken as the side item. The broth for the kome miso was rich, full bodied, and deeply flavorful while the shiro miso broth was lighter but still very satisfying. The thick cut ramen was softer and chewy compared to the thin al dente noodle. The single slice of chashu they give you is very thick. Seriously. I think it's the thickest cut I've seen at any ramen place. So if you don't order the lunch set and get the regular ramen then they actually give you three slices of chashu.  

I was surprised to see that the karage chicken side order had four huge pieces atop some salad. The karage chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly. However, I felt that the chicken was missing some kind of dipping sauce to put it over the top.  

At the end of the meal they served a small scoop of yuzu sorbet to cap off a great lunch.

The LA ramen scene is dominated by very good tonkotsu base ramen so eating a good miso base ramen is a nice change of pace.",shy_Zu1lK_hU0SGO7IlPqQ,5,3,5,VGh3yn8fBV2LjH31zB1xRw

The ramen noodles are springy and soak up the broth really well. The add ons are great but most of the soups come with plenty of meat and veggies already!

Unfortunately the ramen here is unremarkable. It's not horrible, but it's overpriced and disappointingly mediocre. Got the ""full bodied"" mame miso cha-shu, since miso seems to be their specialty. Came with seaweed, bamboo shoots, green onion, corn, and every other condiment I don't care about but not the egg which IMO should be included in every bowl.
The broth was okay, but weak compared to other places around town. As others have said, the flavor seems a bit lighter, which may be a pro. Egg was done perfectly, thank goodness. Chashu was flavorful, appreciated the bit of char on it, but was tough and chewy instead of melt-in-your-mouth tender.

Added on a side of ""cheese"" gyoza, imagining that it was a gyoza version of Rangoon- it's just gyoza topped with shredded cheese, and it's actually not bad. Six pieces for $4.50, doable. 

Service was very attentive, as we were the only table there for dinner. With prices like this, they will immediately turn off most people walking through the door.

The most important aspect of this place isn't just the flavor of the ramen's itself but it's service. The staff are so warm and hospitable, very reflective of the culture.

The menu is divided into three sections Miso ramen from Hokkaido up north (sweet, full bodied) and Nagaya ramen from south (bitter taste) and of also course Shiro miso. They will bring out an special appetizer menu that varies from month to month. What is unique about the menu is that they have a section displaying all the health benefits of ramen which I find to be pretty Awesome! One bowl of ramen is between 700-900 calories, I can deal with that :-) I ordered the spicy miso ramen (Hokkaido) with a request for extra corn. You have the option to add additional toppings. My friend had the Chasu ramen (Hokkaido). Also, we tried the special karage fried chicken, it was a little too greasy but great in flavor. Both soup flavors were amazing, I enjoyed slurping my freshly cooked ramen. Did I mention while we slurped away, we all cheered on the World Cup game, what a great time!

There are three different types of ramen to choose from. I asked the waitress what's the difference between the three since they are named after places in Japan. She just told me Hokkaido is standard, Kyoto is light, and Nagoya heavy? Okay that doesn't make sense at all because Kyoto ramen is suppose to be thicker and Nagoya is suppose to be in lighter soup. 

I just ordered the Hokkaido style Cha-shu ramen with egg. It was not what I expected at all. The soup tasted only soy sauce and no miso at all. The soup was on the thinner side and not very rich. The chashu was very dry and cut way to thick. The noodles were al dente but didn't feel fresh. It was also a disappointment to see the egg cooked all the way through.

I also ordered gyoza and chicken karrage and it was just okay. The gyoza was fried good but the chicken was a little over cooked and kinda hard.

The service has always been very good and punctual everytime my wife and i have been there. The server's name is Kaori. She is very polite, knowledgeable of the menu, and gives traditional Japanese hospitality and service. 

If you are looking for that ""Go to"" Ramen place in all of Las Vegas, this is it. Reasonably priced, open late, great service, and awesome ramen.",KaK9ydvwfR4tH5otVo757A,1,0,5,SCPTCruUpPRTb6no1pfcDQ

I can honestly say I will never come here again. 3 times in a row we had our order messed up, and it's not only that, they keep getting new servers and ask us if we've been there before. 

They completely changed the menu, don't have lunch specials anymore, and the ""new bowls"" are actually the half portions from before. 

Today is what really did us over. We decided to come here to give it another try. Walk in and it's new servers we've never seen before. They then served me my bowl with my boyfriends toppings it in. Couple minutes later the server comes back and asks what my boyfriend ordered?

2583796,2016-01-04,0,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"Wow - with such a high average review rating, I was shocked at how utterly disappointed I was by the time I left here.  (I learned my lesson tonight - don't go by the average star ratings, and read the details of the most current reviews!). First of all, this place was recommended by a friend who admitted it's in a dirty parking lot by a gas station.  I'm fine with hole-in-the-wall establishments when the quality and service are worth it, so that description didn't deter me. Walking in wasn't what I expected...I'm not sure which reviewer described it as ""feeling authentic"" but I assure you, the ambiance certainly doesn't reflect Japanese culture or cuisine.  It's basic banquet chairs/tables, odd lighting (like an old library?) and typical table setups with cheap table settings (for example: plastic as opposed to ceramic for seasonings).  Still at this point I'm ok with this, as I've been to many cheap ramen shops...but then you look at the menu.  In this town, with so many good and popular options for ramen joints like sora, monta, etc. this price point was actually higher than most.  When I asked for an explanation of the menu, the woman tried to explain it, but unfortunately didn't have her spiel down, so I had to ask a few more questions to clarify.  The menu didn't look like the ones as shown on here (wish I took a photo so you'd be able to see where the confusion lies). They have way too many photos with minimum descriptions and there's no good flow like 1) pick your ramen base 2) pick your noodle 3) pick your topping combos, etc. (which would've been super helpful since that wasn't explained verbally).  Essentially there's set items in your ramen - and a lot of unusual toppings in even the most ""basic"" choices....things like ground pork, cabbage, seaweed (not nori), corn etc. I asked the server what happens if I don't want most of these items, if there was a basic ramen to start with to build on since I don't eat most of these toppings (not in my ramen, at least!) She pointed out the cheapest in that particular row, and said to start with that.  I told her I didn't want most of those items, but I did want the chashu pork. Then she points at the most expensive one in the row (11+) and said if I wanted chashu I needed to get that.  By this point I was annoyed at having to order this and ask for almost no toppings...after she left I realized I'd have been better off with the cheapest one and add 1 piece of chashu, but by then, I thought maybe this will be the best ramen I've ever had. Unfortunately it was average. I wouldn't say it is bad, it just wasn't amazing, and certainly not worth the price. The broth was stronger and slightly more oily than most places. I wish it was explained to us that the ramen was being fired at the same time as the fried rice, yet expedited (served) immediately, so the fried rice was presented much too late in the meal (one of us finished eating already). I understand it takes longer to prepare, but it's not hard to ask someone if they'd like their food to come out at the same time or coursed out.  In hindsight, I think the servers were trying (they certainly weren't rude at all), but I was frustrated by how many times they kept coming back to clarify my order (since I took so many items out).  If there needed to be clarification, I get coming back once....but it was more often than that for 1 dish.  It's awkward and unprofessional to not write it down correctly from the start (or simply clarify what the order is when you take it originally before leaving the table). Furthermore, at $3.50, I don't expect much from a half order fried rice, but it was certainly not worth the wait or even the price. It was oily, bland, and the rice was overcooked.  It's embarrassing that this came out, and as disappointed and annoyed as I was at this point, we asked for a to-go container for it (not that we'll eat it), because it was super awkward that I couldn't eat more than a bite before putting my chopsticks down.  If this was the only ramen shop in the entire city...I'd have given it 3 stars but eaten instant ramen at home.",yh_HDtWbTA2V-RgT9QC6kQ,0,0,1,wwvET8PCr_Boejl9a8TkRg

The place is stark, white, yellow and clean.  I wish they had painted the walls a different color to give the place a little more warmth.   The service is very friendly, but make sure you are very clear about your orders or you will get lost in translation.  We asked for a to-go box for the rice and got a rice bowl meal instead.  

We ordered the chasu Shiro and chasu Kome ramen.  I read on a review here that the Shiro broth had sweeter flavors and hubby liked that.  The Kome broth is less rich than Monta and Sora, I missed the oilier broth that chills in the refrigerator into a gelatinous form (not this one, perhaps there is more miso than bones as base).  Also, there are healthier topping options here.  On the Shiro bowl there was corn, tofu, potato, salad greens.  On the Kome were corn, bean sprouts, cabbage, salad greens.  Personally, I didn't really care for the greens (but they made the bowl look pretty). The ground beef that came with both bowls were very tasty, I actually enjoyed it a lot more than their chasu.... Which was a shame because their chasu cuts were exceptional - thick, meaty with only a sliver of fat and grilled, so it had a nice smoky favor.  Problem is it was bland.  It was, huhu.  I wish they would marinate this more and it would be the bomb.  

The gyoza was standard, nothing memorable.  We also ordered the Japanese style chicken karaage which was served with sauced grated radish and green onions.  This unfortunately was a miss for us.  It was very bland and the toppings made the chicken soggy.  We never leave karaage on our plates and we could not finish this one.  Sniff.  Thank goodness a delightful free surprise came in the end of our meal - yuzu sorbet!  YUM.  This is not as sour as most sorbets I've tried and it was a perfect ending to a heavy ramen meal.  If we weren't so full we would've ordered more.  I wanted a whole shake of this!

All in all, we left Misoya quite happy with the ramen we had.  We just asked for spicy miso paste and slathered some on our chasu and all was good.  Would we go back?  Their yuzu sorbet will be haunting me for a few more days, but I think I'll revert back to Monta for my ramen fix.  If you find Monta too salty and oily, then you will most likely be camping happily here at Misoyasplease.",b_9bJ2YjHbbvAob56f6U7A,4,3,4,uVIBeMKs2doD_RpFY-uTww

Still located in the Chinatown area, it's located in a strip mall with a large parking lot.

I was with 2 other family members and we were greeted & seated immediately. The menus were very visual, making them easy to read. Basically their selection of Ramen was based on the flavor of the Ramen that was unique to a particular region of Japan. We all ordered the Kome Miso (Hokkaido style) Chashu Ramen. In addition we share an order of Gyoza. 

We all enjoyed our Ramen, plenty of ingredients it was flavorful and delicious! They even advertised that they don't use MSG...which seemed to be true, because we all felt it had a less ""salty"" taste. We all also liked the taste of the Gyoza. The menu is very descriptive and informative about their selection of Ramen, but in addition the waitress (whom I'm pretty sure is Japanese) is willing to go over & explain the different Ramen selections. She was very nice as well as friendly. Although it may not be as popular as Monta Ramen or Ramen Sora, if you're a Ramen buff give this place a try...

She was very informed about the menu and answered all of our questions. 

Around 8pm my friend and I started to get a little antsy that we still haven't received our food and other tables were receiving theirs.... They were just appetizers though but we were still waiting over 30 minutes. My friend recieved her bowl of ramen and I was waiting patiently for mine and noticed 5 or 6 people who ordered after me recieved their ramen while I was sitting waiting on my bowl and watching my friend eat. 

I ended up getting really annoyed and cancelling my order. Their was 4 tables who ordered after us that got their food before mine. 

I can't talk about the food myself but my friend said the broth was very salty and the dish was overall mediocre.",GNz6k_zhW-hQZSjkug6GlQ,2,0,1,ET9XlU2jNhJ0gnKSAgP22g

They have free wifi, service is exceptional, and the ramen is levels ahead of all the competitors and i've pretty much been to every Vegas ramen shop.  They specialize in Miso and offers ramen specialties unlike any of its competitors.

Ended up with the Tonkotsu ramen since they were out of everything else and it was pretty darn good. By everything else, I mean there are 3 different styles of ramen to choose from.

The bowls look small, but they are pretty filling. They were inconsistent with the amount of broth in each bowl (my friend did not have very much at all and they tried charging us when we asked for more) but the taste is good.

They have stamp cards & free wifi as well. They play music as if I'm on a romantic date. Lol. They have 3 different styles of ramen which is interesting. The waitress was really nice & recommended what to order, but she could have been a little more attentive with checking up on us instead of checking her phone. Especially since me & my friend were the only ones in there anyways.

I had the Kome Ramen, which the waitress recommended since everyone usually gets that, & I thought it was ok. It could just be my tastes, but I think I was looking for a ramen that was more sweeter than sour? Probably not a taste that I'm used to since ramen is supposed taste a little salty too. As my appetizer, I got a mini curry plate. It also tasted ok. A little bland for curry though. My friend got the kaarage. I was surprised to get 6 or 7 pieces, but they also tasted kinda bland. I needed the extra salt & Japanese mayonnaise. I'm also used to crunchy kaarage. Not soft. On the other hand, the Yuzu Sorbet was amazing, but small portioned. Possibly the best tasting & most flavorful part of my meal that matches the free diet coke I'm getting for this review.

A cheerful woman greeted my boyfriend and I and led us to our seats. She presented us with a menu of miso-based ramen originating from different regions in Japan, various appetizers, as well as their newest item: miso tonkotsu ramen. 

Cha-Shu Ramen (Nagoya style - $12.50): This is what I call the ""deluxe"" bowl because it has plenty of toppings, except for a marinated soft-boiled egg that costs $1.50. The base is a red miso. Toppings are three slices of chashu, a spoonful of corn, slices of bamboo shoots, cabbage, and a conservative amount of green onions. The noodles are thicker than what I've had, and they have a nice chewiness. 

If you decide not to go with their ""deluxe"" options, there are others to choose from; though, you might end up having to pay for additional toppings.

We all ordered Kome lunch special.  

Broth:  Bland!  Maybe we're used to stronger flavor at Sora and Monta, but it's just not good.

Noodles:  Thicker noodle and el dente, but it does not come together well with the broth.  

Cha Shu:  Thicker and Grilled.  Dry, flavorless, chewy/tough!  I ordered 2 but only ate one.  It's like chewing on rubber.  At Sora, the cha shu comes together with the noodle and broth so well that it tastes like they all have been simmering together for some time.

Fries:  Why are there fries in the soup?  It's not bad but doesn't really make sense.

Veggies:  overall A-ok.  Lots of beans sprouts in the soup, some bok choy and cabbage.

Menu/Price:  One of my biggest complaints.  Over $11 for a bowl of noodle soup without any cha shu???  you'll need to add chashu for over a $1 per piece.  So a regular bowl of ramen at Sora that costs $7-8 is valued at $13 here.  Even though for lunch special the $11 includes a side with the options of fried rice, gyoza, or fried chicken,  I wasn't impressed on any of the side dishes.  

Air Conditioning:  None

Service:  Overall A-OK.  It's definitely under staffed.  It took a good 20-30 minutes to get our ramen, and we were the only customers when we walked in around 1215.  Then the place got busy at around 1240, so it took forever to get our check.  

Random Rant:  Their chili oil container is not convenient.  I got chili all over my hand.

Overall:  I was gonna give it 3 stars considering it's my first time there, but my two coworkers gave it a 1 star and 2 star...I'm going to stick with Sora and Monta.  Anyone wants my stamp card?",-p2ISrtcOFS87T2pkyIaNw,6,5,2,6fnLY3hXng7UUKk-gaq8-g

Surprisingly harder than I thought. First strike: Monta Ramen and their overflowing crowd that looked like a major fire hazard, no thanks. Second strike: Ramen Sora, their long waitlist, and the surprisingly heavy door that one does not simply 'Push'. By the time I found Ramen Misoya Tomi, all I prayed was for nothing longer than a 15 minute wait and an average bowl of ramen.

To my surprise, not only was it yummy, filling, and everything that I needed after those two sad attempts previously, I received the most welcoming and inviting service here. Not only was the waitress/waiter super attentive and quick, the waitress immediately offered to lend me her iPhone charger when I only asked if there was an outlet to charge it.

The ramen I got was the Nagoya style with chashu - supposedly the ""heaviest"" and most flavorful of the choices available.

First waking in tonight there were TWO open tables with no one sitting at them but we were told it'd be a 15 minute wait, not a big deal. Expect when we go outside to wait because there is no waiting area, the wait staff removes the chairs and tables and just pushes them to the side for no one to use.

The biggest let down was they've COMPLETELY changed the menu. The new offerings were nowhere near what they used to serve. The portion size is significantly smaller, only 1 piece of cha shu that was advertised as ""thick"" that was barely thicker than a cold cut. The noodles are completely different as well. 
The broth was just not good, little flavor and had almost a store bought quality.

SERVICE
Slow and understaffed. My group waited 30mins just to be seated. But guess what? I see 3 empty and clean tables. I stared at the empty table and one of the server ran to me and said I have to be patient. Um ok. I see tables I could sit but sure I will wait. Also frustrating that group that came after us got their food before we even got the menu. 

FOOD
I decided to get their Kome miso ramen (Hokkaido style) with their thin noodles. What is unique about their bowl of ramen is their broth. Sure, all ramen places have their own unique way to make their broth. They all have different personality. 

Misoya's specialty is miso, which is known to have many health benefits. Miso is packed with enzymes, proteins and vitamins so their broth is perfect for the cold weather when we have lower immune system. 

In addition, their toppings are different from other places. My standard miso ramen came with corn, menma, ground beef and green onions. I was surprised that it didn't come with chasyu or egg (which btw you can add on your standard ramen for extra charge). I have tried their chasyu before and remember that it was a thick slice with chew. Ground beef and corn added to the texture but I personally just like a simple bowl of ramen with few slices of tender chasyu, egg with runny yolk and some green onions. 

CONCLUSION
Misoya is my choice when other ramen places are packed. I personally like Ramen Sora and Fukumimi over this one.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,4,5,3,UjQItr-kFNgzrZ0Is_tqSA

The broth was very flavorful, top 2 at least in town. I added garlic paste, chilly powder, and some chilly oil.

Everything hit the spot in a perfect balance. The cha shu was soft and flavorful. Noodle was delicious as well, definitely not stiff like other places.

As we sat, looks like several regulars walked in, Japanese people so they must know their ramen.

Complementary sorbet!! What a delicious surprise!  Yummy.

4107051,2015-03-17,3,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"Ramen Misoya Tomi is one of the last ""newer"" ramen spots that I just hadn't gotten around to trying. I might have gone a few more weeks without it, but I suggested it to my out-of-town friend who apparently agreed because it was a convenient drive for her.

Located in the same plaza as Kinh Do, this place seems to be a cousin of Misoya in Santa Clara, a place that I'd tried once (and enjoyed). Similarities include the menus and the posters that explained miso's health benefits. Differences include the food (unfortunately), the spoons (ladle-like here, not your typical noodle soup spoon), and the decor, which is nicer at Misoya.

For my ramen, I chose the kome miso ($8.30 standalone) because I wanted to make a direct comparison to my past experience. It would have worked if I'd been cognizant of the lack of chashu in the basic ramen bowl. Oops. I will say that the thick noodles were properly al dente, the bamboo shoots were crunchy and juicy, and the minced pork was tasty. The broth had that flavor of an appetizer miso soup, with cooked seaweed to boot. It's not what I expect from a rich miso-based broth like the one at Ramen Sora down the street. I also snagged half of my friend's cooked egg, which was nice and had a soft yolk (but not liquid). It just seems that $1.50 is a lot for it.

I actually went with the lunch special for $11.50, which came with a choice of fried rice, 4 pc. karaage, or my 5 pc. gyoza. The gyoza was quite good, with a little sear on one side to offset an otherwise soft and savory dumpling. Dessert was also included, and it was a very small sphere of yuzu sorbet. Tasty enough, not overly sweet.

The ramen wasn't bad, but it fell short of my expectations. I probably won't be back here unless plans at Ramen Sora unexpectedly fall through or unless I want to try the shiro miso (advertised as a ""cleaner"" broth) or mame miso (some bitterness).",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,3,3,H7IKaX5IYrmQku_Bs4Q7oA

4265799,2015-12-30,2,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"I was seriously craving some good miso ramen after recently having had a great one in Cali. I figured why not go to a miso ramen specialty place. 

The kome miso, which is the more typical broth found in Tokyo was my preference over the mame miso, which is made from red miso paste. 

I personally love thicker noodles so both ramens were ordered in the kinky noodle woooooo. 

The side of spicy miso is not like ramen Sora where there's ground meat and extra stuff incorporated. To the least, I was expecting some mixture of miso with spice, but it was korean chilli pepper paste, which is a huge shocker. Since Korean chilli paste has such a distinct flavor, and I didn't want to taint the miso flavor, I tried adding only a little bit halfway through. 

I thought the broth is good. Unfortunately, it's not the best ever. The chashu is mehhhhh. It's a bit tough and dry. I personally like mine to be so tender that it almost falls apart when you're picking it up with the chopstick. Usually I would be so happy getting three pieces, but I only touched one. 

The only thing I would be concerned is that the floors next to our table were dirty and gross. I couldn't help but to be disturbed about my food cleanliness before it even arrived. I also found something in my ramen broth that was tough, and I took it out of my mouth, and first thought it was plastic. It turns out it was some tough onion skin that literally would not even tear apart, even if you tried rippling it. I told the waitress to ask what it was. She picked it up, touched it and said, ""It's onion skin."" She then had an awkward silence, and walked away. I find that strange. It seriously looked like plastic paper or something. Oh and I remember when my water cup first arrived, the cup was dirty and had green onion bits on it so we had to ask for a new cup. This was all before I even ordered my food. 

Due to sanitary concerns, starting from dirty cup, to dirty floor, to onion skin in my soup, I'm continuing on my search for the best miso ramen. Unfortunately, I can do without this place.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,2,2,YLl4C5QJ8Rh0K-t-DksNyw

Smokey and sultry with a slight hint of wood fired bbq char was the flavor of the pork that was included in our soup bowl. It was very bold and distinct and the subtleties of the smokiness withstood the nuanced flavors of the ramen broth. The waitress hovered over us, she wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food. She almost followed us out the door when she said goodbye. 

They try to do things a little different here at Ramen Misoya Tomi. The traditional, meticulous care is still put into the recipes and ingredients but added are the non-traditional, traditional recipes that we aren't familiar with. Did you follow that? 

The decor could use a little improvement, I'm not a fan of the huge posters hanging about that tout the benefits of miso. Ambiance could be a little less perfunctory and a bit more fun, but what's great about this spot is that it's not too crowded so I'd recommend it for groups.

1. Parking - Thanks to the not-so-busy businesses surrounding this place, it was easy to find a parking some at this shopping complex parking lot. 

2. Decor/Atmosphere - Nothing special. Simple decor. 

3. Bathroom - Nothing special. Typical bathroom. Was clean when I went to wash my hands.

4. Crowd - Busy. I think we had to wait 15 minutes for a 12:30 lunch on a Saturday. 

5. Food - Delicious. We went with the lunch special - Generous bowl of Ramen with an appetizer side and dessert. We tried the top 3 selling Ramen + one of each of the sides. All fantastic. The dessert was underwhelming, but I really wasn't there for ice cream.

6. Service - The 2 servers that were running around seemed to be pretty busy. I noticed some un-bused around us and the servers were sometimes slow to respond. Friendly though. 

7. Price - I ordered extra good because the prices were so good. That's how I got so fat.

Do not be afraid to explore this place on your own. Use these tips.  

The menu is broken down into 3 parts...Each with a slightly different broth from different regions in Japan.
1. Left side is Kome Miso (Hokkaido style) - full-bodied broth 
2. Center is Shiro Miso (Kyoto Style) - fruity and natural
3. Right side is Mame Miso (Nagoya Style) - bitter finish

You can order from any pre-fixed menu item and then add many toppings as you like.

As for taste, it smelled better than the actual taste of it. Even though I ordered it extra spicy, it wasn't that spicy. I had to put a ton of chili oil in to bring up to standard. It was pretty good overall though as far as the taste of a rich miso is concerned. Definitely a good backup option. Honestly I'm still tied between Sora and Fukumimi for who has the best ramen in town.",jOOxxPhOEmLwxLYm9zGcQw,0,0,3,BK08Toal4OPumrPu_ceHNA

My hubs kept talking about this Ramen joint saying how they have the best Pork and that he and his co-workers love this place.  I finally felt like noodles and needed a change from Monta (I really was just too hungry to wait in the line).  

We arrive to Ramen Misoya Tomi and walk into a cute little restaurant, far larger than your other Ramen joints.  At the time, it wasn't busy so we were seated right away.  

We were quickly greeted and presented with a rather large menu.  I was overwhelmed because I'm not use to a big menu at a Ramen place.  Could be a good thing, I mean, if you are looking for more than just ramen.  

Reviewing the menu from front to back, there were explanations of the different broths.  I got the Cha-su Ramen.  Wow, Jesse N.  was not kidding.  The Cha-su was HUUUuuuuuuuge!  I seriously didn't even eat it all.  If you look around they tell you how they put all that love into their Ramen.  The Cha-su is cooked for hours.  Thats how they get those bad boys so nice and soft.  

Service was great, quick, and responsive.  I thought the ramen was okay.  Yes, I would probably return, but honestly wouldn't be my first choice.  The broth was not the ordinary broth, it was a bit, too outside of the box for me.   Worth giving it a try though.",i3bLA4sEdFk8j3Pq6tx8wQ,4,4,3,Lnm75IM6I0Cxl4N_4vyHmw

4677187,2014-05-09,5,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"New ramen place in town located at the same plaza as Kihn Do and HK Seafood Garden. Thanks God that it's not quite the same as the other ramen places in town. They specialized only in Miso Ramen. No Tonkotsu or Shio Ramen. 

The restaurant has signs everywhere that telling you about how healthy their miso ramen is. Their wall and menu have information about the benefit of miso.

Each table has calories comparison of burger, tonkotsu ramen and miso ramen. Based on their note, a basic miso ramen only has 600 calories.

Misoya Tomi is located around the world. Other than U.S.A and Japan, they also have a location in Taiwan, Brazil, Thailand, and Canada. Although, the owner told me that they are not a franchise and not all of the Misoya own by the same owner. 

Their basic miso flavors are mild Kome Miso (Hokkaido Style), sweet Shiro Miso (Kyoto Style), and bitter Mame Miso (Nagoya Style).

Cha-Shu Kome Miso has fried potato, Cha-Shu Shiro Miso has fried tofu, and Cha-Shu Mame Miso has Ebi Fry (Fried Shrimp).

Their Chasu has a very mild flavor. Chasu has been slow roasted in the oven and grilled before serving. I like the thickness, texture and the tenderness of the Chasu. Flavor wise, maybe not as rich as the other tonkotsu ramen place, but it also has less fat and feels a tad more healthier. 

One thing that I noticed about their ramen, this is the first Japanese ramen place that 
I didn't end up feeling thirsty after eating ramen. Most of other ramen places in town always make me feel very thirsty. I'm not sure if that's because of the salt or the MSG. 
I actually feel good and satisfied with their miso ramen.  

Their price is a little bit more expensive compares with Sora or Monta. 

They also have a Japanese menu hanging down from the bar area kind of like Ichiza style . But it's all in Kanji, so I have no idea what they say.

There is a complimentary lychee sorbet after I finish my ramen. It actually pretty tasty, it has an actual lychee in it. Even though its rather small, but still a nice way to cleanse my palate. 

I also got a point card, a free gyoza for every 5 ramen. I'll be back to try their other miso ramen.",aIZMN-Sn90rpxOUaXAxKaA,13,6,4,kVfuITGjHw-LLtuwdSTP-w

We had what they consider their famous ramen, kome cha su. See, I'm not a fan of eating ramen, but the hubs is. I only eat ramen whenever he brings me home some, and most of the time it's from 
Jinya. 

I don't have anything much to say. The ramen was ok. It was not that flavorful as I expected it to be (Jinya was better). The portion was really huge, and there were more meat compared to Jinya. I was only able to finish half of my bowl. 

The pork tasted weird though. Lol! I don't know how to exactly describe it, i guess the best way would be, it wasn't raw but it tasted like it was.

The place is quite small and run by two people (1 chef and 1 server)-- talk about efficiency, right? :) 

Our server was very nice and patient while we were shocked that they have 3 types of broth for the ramen. We opted for the Kome Ramen (white miso) with thin noodles for our first visit. 

My ramen was served quickly, steaming with awesomeness! Took a sip of the broth and I was sold with the depth of the broth's flavor. The noodles were cooked perfectly too. Then, I tasted the cha siu..MIND BLOWN! I didnt know that the char on it makes a huge difference to amp up the flavor. I didnt finish my ramen because the servings were huge! Bill came out $12.80 plus taxes and tip:) 

PS. We came for round 2 in the same week!! Haha. Tried the shrimp tempura as an appetizer, which I found ""okay."" It's crispy, but I am used to tempura lightly breaded with rice flour and not panko.

Moseying on down, I saw the sign for this Ramen place and we love Ramen, so we decided to give it a try.  

This place was empty!  And, they had great service and it was a great experience.  Here they serve you three type of broth, Hokkaido, Nagoya and Kyoto broth.

The Kyoto is what most people normally have, so if in doubt, have this one.

They basically have 3-5 of the same type of Ramen for each sauce. 

Cha Siu Ramen - Very awesome dish with huge thick chunks of Cha Siu.  I normally go for the very thin sliced ones, but these junking bits of meat were darn tasty.

Kimuchi Ramen - Ramen with ground pork. They offer this for the Hokkaido and the Kyoto Style Miso Broth , but not the Nagoya one.    I tried to order it but they were out.  How odd, but oh well.  I think for a rather empty place, that you would have ground pork...... 

Basic Ramen - Did not try this one

Spicy Ramen - Did not try this one.

Vegetable Ramen - I think that if you are a vegetarian, don't come here. I believe all sauces are cooked in the pork bone double boil method.  So they have vegetable ramen, but it is not vegetarian...

We ordered extra Cha Siu, again pretty good.
Extra Egg Topping - Awesome!
Kara Age - Ok.

The Bowls - Loved the bowls they used, which were very deep and narrow on the bottom and wider on top.  Kept the soup hot.

The experience - They post a lot of information about Miso, it's healthy benefits and also historical information on Miso.  Very cool and a great learning.

Service- Very high level service.

I liked my ramen enough but we both thought that it was on the overly oily side.

The fact that the ramen was already more expensive than the other places in town, and the fact that it didn't really taste any better at all, really answered my question of how we could have been the only people in the restaurant on a Friday night.

Shiro cha with pork cha-shu

I honestly did not know what I was jumping in to, all I knew was I wanted soup, and have had this bookmarked forever on my to eat list. Amazing is all I can day.

The service here is A+. We were given a full run down of the three types of soups, specials, and flavors. Greeted as soon as we walked in, and sat down right away. Smiles and great vibra.

4 stars because the restaurant itself is not so apealing. In fact it's a bit plain open and small, and the ice machine was out, so they had a cooler with ice in it. Other than that, pretty clean.

I ordered the Kome Miso (Hokkaido Style) ramen #1 + miso flavored egg. SO GOOD. The first thing I noticed is the miso cha-shu pork is that they give you THREE LARGE SLICES. Most places tend to skimp on the cha shu pork to save money. This is the first time I've seen cha-shu pork fire grilled and it makes a world of difference in terms of flavor and aroma. You may think that they'll skimp on the rest of it... nope! You still get hearty portions of noodles, corn, and ground pork to make sure that you have a satisfying meal. It is almost too much! The miso flavored egg is a solid addition but if you don't have a large stomach, I don't recommend adding it. The portions are almost too large to be true. 

This is my first encounter with miso ramen and I like it a lot. I don't know if there are any miso ramen places in San Diego but I'll definitely look for some now. If there's anything from this place that I would remember, it's definitely the way they grill the cha-shu pork. That alone would keep me coming back.",aw00D2ekmDqnI425BXfTWg,2,0,4,3gSqMC9_tunXpgMxu6QLzA

I got the lunch combo which had ramen with 1 huge pork piece, gyoza and ice cream for about $13. Great deal. 

Because it's a miso specialty shop, there's a huge sign noting the benefits of miso including:
* may prevents cancer
* removes freckles
* helps recovering from exhausting 

My friend wasn't feeling well so asked if they had miso soup but that apparently was the only form factor that miso was not available in.

What's weird is that the better ramen places have less than 4 stars here on Yelp and this place is highly-rated? My faith is officially gone.

The whole experience was a big mess and the ramen virgins would probably never eat ramen ever again. The service was horrible. The servers acted like they've never served anyone before. ""Hang on a second"" was used and abused by our server who needed a notepad for an order of Gyoza...that we were following up on. Our bowls of ramen came before our appetizers...one person in our group never got his ramen. They gave us soup spoons when we were already half-way done eating. We had to get up and get stuff ourselves because the servers were not attentive at all.

The ramen was just alright. The Cha-shu is thicker and has more flavor than other places. The Kara age was ok. The gyoza was fantastic...the only thing that was done right.

They put my friend's ramen to-go and comped it. They also offered to comp our drinks but we ordered water. So, thank you for not charging us water that was never refilled. Terrible!!!",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,3,1,OfxxiVMgBzptIwKH5cOn6A

I tried the Kome and Mame and I favor the Mame broth flavor over the Kome.  There were some weird notes that keep it from being a 5 star rating, the Kome comes with fried potato...which was just french fries thrown into the broth.  I was expecting a potato croquette or something a little more Japanese.  Also, in terms of the greens...I much prefer green onions over spring mix tossed on top.  Soggy salad really doesn't taste too appetizing.  I noticed in the pictures...other people had green onions and not random spring mix.  Perhaps it was the time of day....but I'm willing to give this place another chance and hope it's not quite as odd the 2nd time around.  However, the noodles here are my favorite out of all the ramen locations.  They are thick and chewy and cooked al dente.  The chashu I wish was a little more flavorful, but it was a good ratio of meat to fat.  The Mame was my favorite since it came with a legit shrimp tempura and the broth seemed richer in flavor than the Kome.  We also tried the karaage, but it seemed a little oily and the coating wasn't as crispy as I like.  They do end the meal on a very good note, we were given free yuzu sorbet.  The sorbet was light and refreshing....I would probably order this if it was on the menu!

The broth is flavorful, fresh and hot, as how it should be. I usually get the lunch special with a side of gyoza, which I also think is some of the best dumplings I've had around town. They're very soft and tender and not fried and greasy, not leaving any unhealthy feeling afterwards. They have a stamp card which you can fill up to 5 stamps for a free gyoza, or wait and fill up 10 stamps for a free ramen...which I think is the best deal for any ramen shop. I've probably gone through three stamp cards already...partially because you earn one stamp for each guest of your party.

Shiro Miso (Kyoto Style) - very similar to your regular miso soup

Soup was flavorful and filling. They have a monthly special and this month's was free corn add-on. The other add-ons were additional charge (like egg), but it's not a big deal for me.

$40.93 got us two bowls of ramen, edamame, fried rice, a beer, and a sprite.  Visited on Monday 9-12-16 at 6PM. 

We had the whole place to ourselves which was nice.  Our server was so nice and friendly and she brought out a bowl for my toddler and a tiny cup with ice water which I LOVED! So thoughtful.  

I chose the tonkotsu ramen which came with 1 thin slice of fatty chasu and I added an egg and corn for an extra fee.  The noodles were extremely thin, almost exactly like angel hair pasta.  The egg was gooey inside like it should be but refrigerator-cold which turns me off a lot.  The broth, although fatty and complex, was severely lacking salt.  I had to add lots of salt and chili powder just to make it semi-enjoyable.  This is my least favorite ramen I've ever had.  I'd rather have top ramen from walmart than to eat this again. 

I am bumping up their score because of their delicious chicken fried rice.  It has that secret umami flavor like Monta's and Sora's with tender pieces of chicken.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Also their edamame was hot, fresh, salty and everything that good edamame should be.

1. Broth is awesome. Been to a lot of ramen places in town, and typically you have to instruct them to go easy of salt...but this is seasoned perfect for baby bear (not to salty or not too bland). 

2. Got a lot more selection, from burritos (takoyaki, rice, or yakisoba---yea you heard right)

4. Chef cares and staff is friendly and fast!

anyways, we came here because monta ramen was closed due to something wrong with their water pipes, and ramen sora had a long ass wait....

when we got here, there was no wait and only one big table sitting in the whole restaurant.  we thought we hit the jackpot, but quickly realize that it would still take some time, as only one chef was working the entire time.  It took roughly 30 mins from sitting down to get our food.

Anyways, we ordered the miso and tonkotsu ramen with gyoza.
the miso one packed more flavor, and i would recommend it.
not to mention its insanely cheap if you just order the ramen with no extra toppings.  i believe a bowl of miso came out to around 6 bucks.",PhmMWBBQda24K9z6b9R-sA,4,4,3,t_ZLSPdRpj-XeW-h7VpyXw

5893962,2015-09-27,3,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"I came here all by my lonesome after a workout. I decided that a Double-Double + milkshake just wasn't gonna cut it after running five miles. I settled for this ramen shop. Mistake!

Keep in mind I'm from Southern California and if there's one category of food I know, it's surely ramen. This was my second time here, I wasn't impressed the first time, but given the stellar reviews, I decided to give it another shot.

This shop specializes in miso ramen. There's no shio, shoyu, nor tonkotsu to be found. The three miso styles range from heavy to light. Each bowl comes with bean sprouts, green onions, corn, sea weed, and bamboo shoots. Add an egg for $1.50. The decor was simple: tables were cheap wooden foldouts that wouldn't pass the Ikea test.

+1 star for the nice waitress lady.

As any good ramen lover knows, what separates the men from the boys is the broth. Yeah, we can talk about the toppings or the chashu or the noodles, but without a great broth, you might as well microwave a pack of Cup O' Noodles.

I ordered the Kome, which was the lightest of the broths. Here's the breakdown:

1) Broth: way too heavy, way too salty. The soybean paste was overpowering and the miso was barely present. I didn't finish my broth. This coming from someone who has been known to consume unfinished broth from friends at the table.

2) Another important measure is the noodle:broth ratio. This one leaned heavily in favor of too much broth and not enough noodles. I'm not exaggerating when I say I finished all of my noodles in about 5 bites. The noodles themselves were acceptable -- they were prepared al dente, thick-cut and the consistency and texture did not offend.

3) The chashu. Oh, how did they get this so wrong? They provided plenty (3 hefty pieces), but plenty of garbage is still garbage. It was dry and cut much too thickly. Why did they dump a pork chop in my bowl? Also, there was no ""mouth-melting"", another quality I use to evaluate my ramen. 

4) The toppings were fine. Bamboo was crunchy. Corn was corny. Though for some reason in place of my sprouts, there was cabbage. Not a good trade, which means the toppings actually weren't that fine.

5) They had jars of smashed garlic, but there was no fresh garlic to be found. Strike five.

Vegas, why is your ramen terrible? My friends have a theory that, compared to Cali, Vegas has a Yelp handicap. Unless it's a buffet or Goodwich, subtract about 1.5 stars to get a good representation of the actual caliber of the food. This place is no exception.

Even the most severe of ramen cravings would not be enough to entice me to return.",dvqgxx4hFcfraHvhddzOXA,3,3,2,Z9A40RdIdE4M-bSVq2XuZg

5922525,2015-03-22,1,31cOttU_tML5b6eLLXZfsQ,"Well.. So I came back for a couple reasons. I started to feel an illness coming on therefor soup was the obvious answer, but on a Saturday night I didn't want to wait to get seated at other more popular ramen shops.  I did like the broth here from the Shiro miso and so decided to give it another shot.  

I discovered the last time I was here, they did forget to give me the chashu with the CHASHU ramen. We were the only customers at the time so can't chalk it up to being rushed. 

This time, my bf and I ordered the Mame miso chashu ramen, 2 orders of karaage, a hot tea and edamame. At 8pm on a Saturday, they were out of edamame and had only 4 pieces left of chicken for one order of the karaage(a normal order as stated on the menu comes with 5). We were told about the edamame when we ordered but didn't find out about the karaage until after the rest of the order had arrived. At this point my bf lost his appetite but forced himself to eat his measly 4 pieces. During this time another couple had arrived, been seated and was served their tea and ramen before we received anything. My hot tea arrived 30 seconds before my ramen. Why even bother? It already defeated the whole purpose. Maybe I'm not used to the Mame miso but the whole bowl was SOOOOO salty! The chashu was huge and meaty compared to others, but very chewy.  Our waiter never came back to check on us. Never refilled our water. The woman(I think maybe the owner or manager) kept asking if we were ok repetitively seeing our disdain. Well what do you really want us to say? She ended up charging half price on the karaage. Weee! A whopping $2 off!  We paid our bill with tip. As we were leaving she literally ran after us to the door still asking us if we were ok and thanking us. Sorry, but we won't be returning. I was really hopeful this time.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,2,2,1,HTTioPoIvU0an7LHjTs9XA

The noodles are chewy and delicious, the broth is hearty and filling, and the portions are generous. The owners are a husband and wife from Japan who really know what they're doing. Not many ramen places are run by the owners and this ramen is definitely worth the trip off of the strip.
