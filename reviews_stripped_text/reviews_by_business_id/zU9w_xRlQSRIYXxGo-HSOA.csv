Ordered a BLT, and it was huge! It was definitely more than I can eat, I wish the hubs and I had split the sandwich, but they charge you a extra $3 to share.  I don't understand that at all.  Hubs had the Ruben, it was delish, but again, it was huge.  Ate there late one night after a show, and the staff was super friendly and helpful.  It was close to 11pm, and there was no wait, and food came quickly.  It was pricey, just like all the restaurants in the hotels on the strip.

$17.99 for a Corn Beef and $41 bucks later, we were greeted by an enormous sandwich as expected. UNFORTUNATELY THE SANDWICH ARRIVED ON STALE RYE BREAD WITH DRY, TOUGH CORN BEEF.

146125,2010-12-31,1,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"Mmm hmm (clears throat), channeling Zero Mostel. There are way too many people posting reviews who don't know anything about Jewish delis. Big sandwiches are part of the tradition; if you don't like it, eat at the boring California Pizza Kitchen next door. I'm sure their serving size is more appropriate to your needs.
I admittedly have not been to New York to visit Katz's or Second Avenue Deli. However, I have been to Langer's, Brent's and Canter's in LA, and when it's on, this is the best pastrami sandwich I have ever tasted. Juicy, peppery, pastrami steamed just right! Fan-freaking-tastic. The smell in this restaurant makes me swoon in pastrami lust. 
But this is not a one-note deli. If you like stuffed cabbage, please try theirs. This is the best stuffed cabbage I have ever tasted (I know, I know I said the same thing with the pastrami!) Delectable sweet and sour sauce with raisins. The ratio of sweet to sour is perfect. Amazing!
I haven't even gotten to the knishes. Again, when they're on, these are the best I've sunk my teeth into. The right mix of garlic and onions inside for an incredibly perfect pastrami compliment.
Also, if you like kishke, try theirs. No, it's not homemade like Brent's, but it is prepared well, with a rich, spicy flavor. The scrumptious gravy is the icing on the kishke. Try their brown gravy with the knish as well. Woah. I am drooling just thinking about it!",rd1kcbcis6EfEBGMOnsGtg,1,1,5,bD0HeHOcnME8Inne3LvYmw

The pickles arrive (my absolute favorite) but are now some hideous flavorless green things. The sandwiches are smaller (but cost the same). Reading other reviews indicates the awesome cheesecake has also been changed. We didn't want to stand in line again to find out!!! The menu is a fraction of original menu.

We weren't able to sit near each other but after a little while, a table became available so we scooted over to be with the other couples.  At that point, the manager came over and told us we were going to be charged a mandatory 18% gratuity.  All we did was switch places to a table that someone else had!  When we told her the situation, she said it was mandatory and she would adjust all our bills. When we didn't hear back from her for approval (we paid via credit card), we left a cash tip.  As we were leaving, I decided to check our bank account (I didn't really trust the manager) and found they had, indeed, charged us extra without our approval. When we brought it to her attention, she was belligerent, quite rude, and spoke to us like we were stupid (""let me see if I can figure out how to say this nicely in words you will understand""  -Both my husband and I are business professionals and gave her no reason to question us otherwise.).  She then said she would 'fix' it since we left a cash tip and guess what?  She did.......not.

You two can split it and probably still have leftovers (if you're in a room with a fridge). The prices are high, but when you realize that each dish is at least two full meals, it seems reasonable.

I had the tongue omelet. It was monstrous. Two omelets in one. Could not finish it even though it was delish. My gf had the BLT. This was probably four sandwiches in one.

450012,2012-10-12,0,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"First note: ""This place is very, very expensive"".  For a turkey sandwich and a slice of cake, you're looking to spend around $35 dollars.  While I do appreciate the fact that they are open very late and are a somewhat cheaper alternative to room service, I'd like to point out the fact that their food is extremely over-priced.

During my last outing to Las Vegas, I decided to try this place out.  I got a turkey sandwich ($27 with cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions) and a slice of cake.  When I asked for mustard and mayo on the sandwich, I was immediately told that it would be on the side.  Now, I know this may make me seem like an a**hole, but when I'm dropping close to 30 bucks for a sandwich, the least that you can do is spread the mustard and mayo on the bloody thing for me, not give me a bunch of packs.

The sandwich itself was waaaaay too large.  I understand how alluring the 12 inch high sandwich could be, but in reality a sandwich that tall is just too big to eat.  After being unable to bite into the sandwich, I found myself in my room having to break it down into sections and unfortunately I only had 2 pieces of bread for about 2lbs of turkey.

My suggestion would be to simply make the sandwiches smaller and charge a lesser price.  I know that some people would like the idea of splitting one, but the problem is that you only get 2 small slices of bread and a couple of pounds of meat.",W6ZYDM5oEs9iGgpTA3kV2w,0,0,3,E95Jr1oYFqwylEC7jHfZog

Decent corned beefed piled high, loaded with melted swiss and flavorful sourkraut, all atop an afterthought of rye bread.  

However, everyone elses dish had me shaking my head.  The others in my party had the Woody Allen, the cheeseburger, and a turkey club.  The Woody Allen was little more than what appeared to be two pounds of meat with a couple slices of bread tacked on the ends.  That would be ok if the meat was some of the greatest stuff on earth, but it was far from it.  Dry, dry, dry.  THe corned beef, which was acceptable on the rueben, without the addition of heat is not nearly as good.  When your sandwich consists of a grotesque amount of meat and nothing else, at least make sure the meat is good.

The turkey club was piled high with DRY turkey, what appeared to be 80 slices of bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  That was it.  Same as the Woody, if you're sandwich is just going to be a showcase for a pound of deli meat, at least make sure the meat is worth showcasing.

The burger was plain and unforgettable, if at least a normal portion at a 1/4 pound patty.

622314,2015-02-10,0,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"Sad to report, but it's going downhill. They have thrown the ""Carnegie experience"" out with the trash.

Carnegie Deli has been on my list of must-stop LAS restaurants for about 7 years. Since my last trip to Las Vegas in January 2014, there have been changes, all in a negative direction. Forget the old idea of table service. You order and pay at the register and take a number-stand so your food can be associated with your table. When you get to the table, the pickle tray is no longer there. When your food ultimately arrives, you are asked whether you want pickles, and if you affirm, three pickles are brought to you. While they claim the food is the same, and that it still comes from the plant in NJ, in fact the corned beef had a distinctive saltiness that I've never before encountered with Carnegie meat, and it makes me wonder if it's been out warming for too long and become a bit less moist than intended. The sandwich was massive and tasty except a bit over-salty. Just a bit. Still better than the corned beef just about anywhere else. One would think that all of this was designed to cut costs, but those savings sure were not passed on to the customer! Prices seemed to me up about $2, bringing the corned beef sandwich to $18.95. The cole slaw was great,  but the portion smaller than I remember. The plain cheesecake was perfect, and the only part of the meal that was unchanged. 

This restaurant at the Mirage was dead at 2pm on a Thursday, and I think that's a first in my experience. Usually, it's packed.

The waitress said that the owner made big changes in October, 2014. If they don't do a course correction, I think Carnegie Las Vegas will become a casualty. That would be sad. I've really enjoyed visits here when I need my fix of Manhattan.",dYdPPlkXF6Dt9y20EZI0iQ,2,0,3,Ib6VycUaYJ9y2XqBx8Q8mg
632175,2014-12-30,1,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"2 months ago, this rating would be five stars.  I have been coming here for years, twice a year like clockwork. Not only did Mirage change this Carnegie Deli from a sit down restaurant to a pay-first-and-sit-only-after-ordering-and-paying Sizzler style place, they took great food items off the menu and they CHEAPENED the quality of the food that is left remaining on the menu.

No more knishes on the menu...and that's just a start...

They cheapened the matzo ball soup...no longer golden and no longer perfectly seasoned...it's watered down...they try to hide the lower quality with a few bits onions and a speck of carrot here and there.  I can't say that it's swill, but I wouldn't order it again...and I used to order it every time every visit.  The matzo ball itself? Well, it's adequate...a bit lumpy, a bit cold ... Nothing to be proud of...hence no reason to order. 

The portions were still large, the quality of the pastrami okay...not as good as I remember, but unless you are a New Yorker, you won't notice.  It's a step above Denny's pastrami, I'll grant them that.

And that's what they are counting on...save a little here and there, cheapen the food...and they hope you won't notice.

The really stupid part about the change from sit down restaurant to this flush them through approach is that the ordering from a waitress wasn't what took  the longest time, it's the food prep...so the wait in line, order, pay, then sit down system doesn't solve any throughput problem.  The genius who made this change needs to go back to business school and take queuing theory...or at least read the book, The Goal. 

It takes the same amount of time from start to finish just with cheaper food, fewer choices and angry patrons.  Way to go, Mirage.

Carnegie Deli in NYC should take note of the damage Mirage is inflicting on the Carnegie Deli brand.  

I hope they change it back to a sit down restaurant with higher quality food...If they don't bring back the complete menu, so be it, but the quality of food needs to improve back to its former levels. 

Otherwise this visit will be the last time I will stay at the Mirage hotel and the last time I eat at this Carnegie Deli...yes, that bad.

Since last review...
1. Order at the window from...
2. A menu that has been cut to about 50% of the items and...
3. Is very small to read, which...
4. Slows down the line behind you, then...
5. Try to find a seat when it is really busy.

Here comes the food, delivered to the table, not by your server, but by whoever is up next. 
The Reuben... about two thirds the size that it used to be and with poor quality corned beef.
The Pastrami sandwich... much fattier and less tender than in the past... and with a revised rye bread that is not good.
The fries... a monstrous portion (enough for 4 people), that came to the table COLD! 

The server tried very hard to please, and was the high point of the experience.

We went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  The wait for a table was about 15 minutes - no biggie because they were obviously very busy.  I DID think it was odd that, at 9:30-10 am on a Saturday morning, the executive chef (that's what his chef's coat said he was, anyway) and one of the managers were eating breakfast together at one of the restaurant tables instead of... ummmm... working.  That is a former restaurant manager speaking, but whatever.

When we did get seated, we decided to split one of their HUGE egg and corned beef sandwiches, a fruit cup, and hashbrowns.

Fruit cup was great - mostly melon, but the melon, fortunately, was very sweet and flavorful.  Also had fresh pineapple and crisp grapes in it.  Pretty darn good.

Hashbrowns were AWESOME.  They had pieces of onion and a great seasoning on the potatoes... they were not just crappy and bland.

And I almost had an orgasm when I ate my half of the sandwich.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the amount that they give you is completely absurd for one person.  But the corned beef... mmm... so greasy and meaty and good in the best of ways.  It only would have been better if it had been 3 am and I was drunk with friends.

I'm not sure it's ever socially acceptable to do a face-plant in food unless you're about 2 years old.  However, maybe it wouldn't be so frowned on at a drunk 3 am as it is on Saturday morning with your mom.",F9hrkaZp8nqdcEaFbZN44Q,1,1,4,3gej463-evC9FYbwJcNK2g

I reminded him that she had wanted her burger plain too.....he was visibly angry and asked why she hadn't told him that.  I said she did tell him when she said she wanted her burger ""exactly"" like mine.  He then scooped all of the toppings off the burger slammed the bun on wrapped it up threw it in the bag.  

He then started throwing dishes around (no lie) to the point that even his co-workers were staring at him.  It was all just surreal.  I can honestly say that had not/was not ever rude to this man, but I was not willing to pay $60 at a deli for burgers and fries & then accept a wrong order.

My friends and I came to Carnegie Deli at the Mirage because it was on the way back to our hotel (Treasure Island) after a disappointing night of clubbing. Long story short, the food was mediocre and the service was the worst. I expected the pickles to be good. Not the case.

As for the service, the waitress never refilled our water or checked if everything was ok with us. So when it came time to pay, I did not want to tip anything at all. I wanted to just tip the leftover change to round up to the next dollar. The waitress wasn't happy and said we could keep the change.

Also they were so busy that it took forever to get drinks, or our food. 

Overall the sandwich was okay, and it was fun to enjoy something new and a restaurant that is supposedly famous..?",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,3,1,2,a5qHxjHKlvW40bqTMkQHyA

Have been wanting to try a pastrami Reuben here for about two years, and this was gonna be my opportunity!  At 10:00 am!  While I was extremely enthused about the sandwich, don't usually stretch my guts to capacity that early.

Will get to it-

Ambiance/Cleanliness-Well, it sure ain't like any of the delis in NYC that I grew up with....it's like a coffee shop/diner as filtered though Las Vegas functionality.  Clean....nothing very special....3 stars.

Service-The hostess was lovely, but when I ordered my sandwich, the manager said that they were out of pastrami, and I got fairly nasty, fairly quickly.  Magically, the necessary pastrami was located, and we were in business.  Food came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  Since they made it happen, something that should NEVER happen again....4 stars.

Food-One of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in my life.  It was superb!  My friends had breakfast food, and I can't comment on that, other to say, I don't see the point.  My Reuben?  Perfectly toasted rye, with a nice Russian/Thousand Island dressing, perfectly drained sauerkraut and a solid maybe 12+ ounces of delightful pastrami, hand cut with melted Swiss cheese on top.  It would make a fabulous last meal!  I'm subtracting 1 star for the price of $25.00.  That's steep!...4 stars

Highly recommend splitting the sandwich with someone else - even if they charge a couple bucks extra to do it.  Great horseradish tinged mustard.  Very good sour pickles.

They have a take-out spot that serves as a good fallback on busy sports weekends - you can just eat it in the sports book while watching the game.

I came to Carnegie some time back but before I was a religious yelper. When a buddy suggested we get sandwiches for lunch right when we got into town, I had no idea we would find our way back to this place. 

All I remember are the portions are gigantic ($3 sharing fee) and at this time, I was thinking with my stomach than my head and ordered something solo (mind you, I had a MAJOR case of food poisoning the day prior so I was feeling like I was running on empty). I got the Woody Allen which comes with pastrami and corned beef.

When it came out, it was STACKED to the max. I forgot how to eat it. It went well with the deli mustard that sits at the table. 

Disappointments this time around:
- One of my friends got the beef tongue and said it was flavorless. There was nothing in the sandwich in the self that would make it ""saucy"" to eat... and the way this beef tongue was, there didn't appear to be any natural juices.

- The portion sizes are a bit wacky. A side of fries for $6 (which were cooked perfectly) was a pretty good size. For about $5 we also got a small bowl of potato salad and a small baked potato that didn't even come out with any butter, sour cream or chives!

The waitress noticed that we waited a long haul without getting any of the items we requested (sauce, extra place settings, etc.) so she came by, graciously apologized, and got us an extra order of fries. That's great customer service there.

I'm not sure under what pretenses I'll come back here, I'm sure there are other pastrami places to explore in Vegas!",bW6VMyB5r05Yze44Ora0pA,1,1,3,ZFEDl6Rqq3FoEPypW0xw8A

First of all, the bread is not as fresh. The meat portions, though still generous, are less too. The service was good, as was the location (right next to the sports book in the Mirage). However, it is also more expensive than the expensive Carnegie Deli in New York. Combine it all together, and I was sad. I had my hopes up, and it was just... lacking.

Still, maybe if I find myself up after placing a bet on some sports game at the Mirage, maybe I'll head on over (inebriated would help), and get my pastrami on rye. And then I'll reminisce about my trip to New York... and the real thing...

T0 me there are three measures for a good (Jewish) deli. 1) Corned beef sandwich, 2) Roast beef sandwich, and 3) chicken noodle soup with matzah balls. I had #2. I asked the cashier (I ordered takeout) if the roast beef was rare (there is really no other way to enjoy it). She said it was. I took her word ... my mistake. It was well done with not a hint of pink anywhere ... it was gray-brown. To make matters worse, the meat had a mealy texture ... ewww. The rye was fresh though with a nice hard crust and soft innards. But I couldn't get past the meat. No kosher garlic pickles were included in the order? Why not? IMHO, rare roast beef should be bright red throughout and have a wet texture from being freshly sliced. Some ""blood"" (not really blood0 should remain on the plate if you put a slice down for a sec.

Well, here in the Las Vegas branch of the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage that still was the case - all the male waiters were Chinese. The female waitstaff were a mixed bag. But all of that is neither here nor there I just thought it was odd but amusing. We ordered the Pastrami sandwich and ended splitting one sandwich among two people. The pastrami sandwich itself was very good and juicy. I also liked the salted pickles on the side. But even though we split the sandwich, the portions were still huge and we barely could finish our ""halves"". I'd highly recommend splitting with a friend - unless you're one of those ""Man versus Food"" folks and pride yourself on being able to finish food challenges where the portions are ridiculously huge.

Every time I come I get the famous Reuben. It is huge and so worth the money. This one sandwich ended up feeding two people for two meals. I highly recommend the Reuben if you were only to get one thing here.

I have also tried the chicken noodle soup and it was surprisingly good. The noodles were a little squishy, the way I personally like it, and the soup was quite tasty. 

The second time I ate here my family opted for the brisket sandwich, Reuben, the burger, and fries. The Brisket Sandwich was fantastic! I normally find Brisket to be dry, but the meat on the sandwich was moist and tasted amazing. I will definitely order it again the next time I visit. 

The wait staff is fantastic, and the overall vibe of the restaurant is casual. I will be back for more of their fantastic sandwiches!",Fi39OJrZR2stal_9YJ_I-Q,0,0,4,TDsIj91s_obeiwkRM6kRxQ

Make sure to split with someone ($19.95 for a HUGE sandwich) unless you want to be looking like it's an episode of man vs food at your table. We love a good deli and this hit the spot. Only reason I gave 3 out of 5 is because the prices are a little steep and the motza soup tastes too much like chicken noodle rather than a cabbage soup taste I'm used to.,v9Drwi25GhJdwGFU2fs-Pw,0,0,3,lWp5gp8KEJT2aGCOEv6iaA

Then we asked if it came with fries, she said separate - she wasn't kidding a small plate for 10.99 -- yikes! 
Pastrami was a pound of meat between two slices of bread, cheeseburger - very bland, and the fries look the same as Jack In The Boxe's curly fries. 
Not impressed -- what was the kicker is the $45 bill for those three items.

I have no complaints. Maybe a small workaround. Sandwich is 14.99. But to share you have to pay $2-3. Therefore, I order a reasonably priced cheesecake to eliminate the sharing fee. Cheesecake taste great and I don't have to pay $2 for nothing.

Being Miss Drunkie McDrunkerson, I sent the beau across the way to pick me up the fabulous sounding Bacon Whoopie (chicken salad with bacon!). He returned with the most fabulously large sandwich, and I was ecstatic. 

The chicken salad was delicious--better than the stuff I make at home--and the bacon was thick and crisp. I had Swiss added and  asked for sourdough and it turned out to be the perfect combination. 

My only issue with this sammy was the way it was layered. I get the whole 'big sandwich' theme going' on (I know they have a reputation to keep) but I've never been someone to get excited over a third piece of bread in the middle of my sandwich. The layering went like this, from the bottom up: bread, chicken salad, Swiss, bread, bacon, half a head of iceberg lettuce, one whole tomato. I promptly dismantled the thing and layered it the way it should have been: bacon and other toppings carefully crammed against the chicken salad and cheese and topped with the second (and last) piece of bread. 

I will definitely eat here again and I won't have any problem putting a little work into the darn thing to make it perfect!",3uhU_DdYjI0tmB9iOfXPrQ,1,0,5,ULXrFjVEG_Rmp3bIbe2bJw

 We got a Reuben and a Woody Allen, and an order of fries. Service was fine, we got extra bread promptly. First surprise was the sandwich was served with one sad, limp pickle! When last here, they served a separate pickle plate for the table, on which was a variety of spears, dills, half-sours, garlic dills, and all were crisp and obviously made in house. And they would bring more on request, which they still do. The pickles we were served I swear came out of a jar, so sad. Sandwiches were smaller (although quite large) than my recollection, and the corned beef was both tasteless and indelibly gristley, though pastrami was fine.

A group of us stopped to eat here since one person in a group recommended it.  If you have never been here it is inside the Mirage Hotel (the hotel itself is very nice).  

They give huge portions certainly one sandwich can feed two people and unless you are starving I suggest sharing.  

We ordered the borscht, ""creamy"" tomato soup and chicken liver with onions.  Others in the group order the Reuben covered in cheese (not sure what's it's called if it has a name)....if you're lactose intolerant stay away from that one!!

The borscht was pretty good, though they forgot to give me the sour cream.  The chicken liver & onions were very good, though we prefer beef liver.  They were nicely cooked on the outside and the onions sweet and caramelized...ummm delishhh!!

On the other hand the ""creamy"" tomato was more like boiled tomatoes thrown in a blender and a handful of sugar added.  DO NOT recommend this dish.  It did not have a creamy consistency, look or more important taste. 

The cheese covered Reuben was ok, nothing spectacular just large portions, and they rave about the ""deli fries"" which were ordinary French fries nothing specially to write home about. 

Now the cheesecake with strawberries OMG!! ah-mazing!!

The service....ehh so so.  I realize that with large groups it's more complicated but a seasoned server should have it down packed and at this point forgetting items or giving us the wrong ones is just not acceptable.  And the only reason why I know our server was season was because a friend recognized her from many times before and she herself said she'd been a food server for decades.  

Now as far as the server's assistant (the drink person) she was completely unacceptable.  When we asked about a menu item her solve all answer was ""I don't know ask your server!""...humm I'm sorry but don't you work here too?? Or do you eat at the place down the street???  Not to mention that she did not make an effort to find an answer apparently anything other than drinks is above her pay grade!!

Also, the prices are a bit steep, for a sandwich I rather spend that money on a good hamburger somewhere else. 

Overall, it's kind of a hit or miss, really depends on what your order.  So, all I can say is take your chance maybe you'll get lucky.  As far as we are concerned I don't think we will be eating here again, at least not anytime soon.",X_14Pe-kpmR_QiU-SRJvgg,0,0,3,2A5BtgEJimjF7pijIpDt3A

We've always walked past Carnegie Deli in Mirage to get to The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace. The alluring scent of smoking meat from Carnegie wafts over the whole area and we've been eyeing to try this place for awhile.

Not being able to choose, we decided to do a sandwich and did a custom meat sandwich that includes 4 meat choices. So we tried the brisket, the tongue, the chopped liver, and the pastrami. 

When the sandwich got to the table, it was shock and awe. It was something straight out of Man vs. Food in montrosity. That being said, was even that good?

The answer is not really. The brisket is pretty bland while the pastrami is surprisingly tough. The tongue is okay but really needed to be heated up with the rest of the meat-fest. The liver was well seasoned however with this sandwich - there was just too much of it to really enjoy any of it. As for the bread... what bread? It sort of gets lost in the shuffle amongst all the meat. But when you got a taste of the rye, it was rather dry.

Our service was okay. She was actually quite nice and gave us some extra bread to take home when we asked for a take-home container.

2185097,2013-04-17,0,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"It's hard for us to review a place like Carnegie Deli. On one hand, you get such a comically large amount of food that it seems like a waste. They have to know that most of their patrons are visitors who are staying in a hotel room, and many of those rooms do not have refrigerators. So you end up paying for at least 2 meals' worth of food at once only to have your (likely substantial) leftovers end up in the trash.

On the other hand, this is one of the few places on the strip where prices actually seem reasonable for what you get. This is despite the bogus extra charge we saw on the menu for sharing. I mean, you're already gorging on meat, must you also be gouged too?

That being said, the food--at least what we could eat of it--was good but not spectacular. I had the matzo ball soup and turkey burger. The burger was so large that I ended up eating the meat and leaving much of the bun behind. My husband, who wanted to try both the pastrami and corned beef, foolishly opted for the Woody Allen, which bears additional explanation:  This is not really a ""sandwich"" but rather a huge mound of meat stuck between two regular pieces of rye bread and held together by long toothpicks. It was impossible to pick up, not to mention impossible to finish in one sitting. He probably ate a third of it using his fingers and fork. Both meats had good flavor, as did the deli mustard in the bottle on our table.

Service was a little slow but we were in no hurry so it didn't bother us. We do give our server props for warning us about the size of the Woody Allen. Next time maybe we should listen to him.

Tuna sandwiches had no mayo on them. The pickles were so sour and old looking.  No cole slaw, which we enjoyed very much.

Relatively lean pastrami, and the horseradish mustard on the table is a great match.  (I made a kickass corned beef & pastrami hash with the leftovers today.)

Yesterday I tried the cheese blintzes and a potato pancake.  Blintzes... fried?  Deep-fryer action?  Very odd, but the filling was fantastic.  The potato pancake was good, not too greasy, some noticeable onion action in there.  But here is where they lose a star from me - $13 for three small blintzes.  $5 for a decent-sized potato pancake.  I think I was offended by the receipt which listed the potato pancake as ""latkes"" - as in multiple items.  Uh, no, you really did charge me $5 for one latke. 

Service was also really slow.  But this was the best deli dining I've experienced east of the Mississippi (not including Canter's in LA).",fyS8H0BNDv5du_X7ttUEqQ,0,0,3,P5Mi1Kmx2LFoUOnRgnP69g

I was looking forward to fresh homemade pastrami, since its really hard to find outside of New York City.  So i chose Carnegie dell located in the Mirage.

I ordered the pastrami hash, the pastrami was very good i like how it was toasted on the griddle, i just wish the potatoes were more crispy, more like home fries, the soft potatoes didn't do it for me.

Other people ordered a corned beef sandwich and a pastrami sandwich which were both large and tasty.  We also got an order of fries too, they were crispy, next time i'll ask them to fry some pastrami and put it over my fries with an egg on top?

Both sandwiches were good but i liked the pastrami sandwich at Stage in the MGM better.",0DnQxBz82tU--KsevUFCTw,4,3,3,pNe2SfPEP2RrkHjGU0r7hA

I did not like the format of ordering and paying at the counter first, the reduced menu selections, and reduced staffing.  

Soda was served in plastic cups with plastic lids.  No complimentary pickles.  No specials.  Waiter shamed us into our order-- ""are you sure you want two sandwiches, most people split.""  The size of the sandwiches has always been part of the fun!

They have taken one of my favorite Mirage food choices and ruined it.  I will not be returning unless they change it back to the previous style of service.",jkKtb9U1fWAAqeGUpGTDYw,4,0,2,xLVovnmlTMb0F0AcUIhlVA
2256143,2010-09-13,0,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"Okay, so I've been to the Carnegie Deli in New York, and it is fantastic. I was staying that the mirage and remembered how awesome the New York location was and decided I had to take my girlfriend there. Wrong Decision. This place was awful in comparison to the New York location.

The food was okay, which is not saying much for Carnegie, because the New York location has FANTASTIC food. I'm also a little peeved because in NY, you can get the Blintzes with their fruit toppings, and we couldn't here. That was the first strike, since Blintzes at Carnegie are amazing. I had the Corned Beef Hash and my girlfriend had the Thick Cut Ham and 3 eggs with home fries. I was really expecting a lot out of the hash because they are known for their amazing Pastrami and Corned Beef. Wasn't impressed. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. It wasn't bad flavor, but there wasn't much there to taste. It seemed like the way they cooked it took the flavor out of the corned beef. Maybe I should have gone with the Pastrami Hash, but who knows? Anyways, my girlfriends meal was definitely better than mine, much more on par with the breakfast I expected at Carnegie. The ham was cooked and had a nice caramelization going on. The fried eggs over easy were cooked perfectly, but the home fries just weren't that great. The inside was a little dry and the outside was a little soggy without much flavor. That was probably the most disappointing part for me because I absolutely love good home fries.

Next, the service. The service here is bad, especially in comparison to NY. I hate to keep comparing it to NY, but if you are going to use their name, it's gonna happen. In NY, the employees seemed happy, lots of smiles, friendly, and it was like they enjoyed working their. Here, I didn't see a single smile and every employee looked like they wanted to punch someone in the face. Our server asked us what we wanted to eat like 3 times in the first 2 minutes we were there, but we needed a bit to decide, and they didn't return for 20 more minutes. I said a needed a couple minutes, not 20. The kicker, though, was at the end of the meal. In case you couldn't tell from other reviews, the portions are HUGE here. So, I obviously had some of my hash left over (about a third of it) and wanted a box. When I asked for a box, the server asked ""Are you serious?"" and looked at me like I was an idiot. No, I was joking! You caught me! (Sarcasm).

In conclusion, don't go to Carnegie unless you are in New York. Walk the extra 20 feet down the hallway and go to BLT Burger, where you will not be disappointed.",df_wr-hXaxeb1b_KCAX3BA,1,0,2,I6c2THQi-jTCw7H3h9Tg-A

That is not the case any longer bit is still large but not what it used to be. I got the tuna salad sandwich and was disappointed.

4 of us ordered 1 pastrami sandwich and 1 corn beef sandwich + 2 basic salad. Free pickles when we sat down. One sandwich is enough meat for 4 people(we have some small eater in our group). Total cost for about $40. Pretty good considering  this is on the strip.

The pastrami sandwich is filled with meat, sliced thin and then stacked high between rye bread (very traditional). The meat has a hint of smoke, has good flavor with  a generous spice rub around the edge, but not too salty. A little bit of fat on the sandwich makes it juicy without being too heavy. I cannot help but compared it with Schwartz in Montreal. Schwartz's meat has more smokiness, while this is milder. Carnegie Deli's pastrami however a little more salty. I find mustard give a good kick to Schwartz's, but not needed for Carnegie's version. Both version are highly enjoyable.

The corned beef sandwich is also filled with meat, stacked high between rye bread. The meat is fatty but not greasy and not heavy. I am a little puzzled by how they achieved this...

The pickles are salty but not too tart. This is different from other pickles that I have. I cannot say I prefer it to ordinary pickle, but it is quite good in its own right.

Ignore the haters, the Carnegie Deli is a great place to get a huge sandwich and it's really not that expensive.  

You see, the second you step into Las Vegas you should expect to spend at least $20 on a meal and considering these sandwiches EASILY FEED TWO and mostly go for $12-17 except for a few larger for $20, I actually consider this a decent value.  

The burger place across the hall will happily sell you a meal for one for about 20d.  

Carnegie also manages a few accomplishments.   Strangely this might be the only rye bread I like.   The service is easily friendlier and faster than the ACTUAL Carnegie Deli in NYC and there was no line on my visit to boot.

Bigger sandwiches, bigger latkes, huge plates of french fries. When I go to Carnegie I can consume my weekly caloric intake in thirty minutes with no problem. They need to make longer toothpicks for the massive amount of meat stuffed into their mile high sandwiches. A classic New York establishment, right around the corner from Carnegie Hall is where I first found this restaurant, and I was delighted to know that I could escape (especially if I had already drank a lot and squinted my eyes) back to New York where I feel so at home. The service is good, and they bring me all sorts of things not on the menu that I sneak from the nearby California Pizza Kitchen nestled inbetween Carnegie and the Sports Bar at the Mirage. A little BBQ sauce and ranch on my huge plate of fries. Three deeply fried and crispy latkes soaking in apple sauce and sour cream. They're super busy after LOVE gets out, so hit it later and feed the machine before you hit Tryst where you work it all off on the floor (and in my case also on the pole). 

It's perfect when I need to see huge mason jars full of pickles to bring me right back home to the East when I've been in Cali for too long and feel like all I've been eating are sprouts and drinking organic wheat grasses. The only thing is that even the pickle jars aren't real, they're an image on a lighted box. How appropriate considering not only are we in Vegas, but also at the Mirage, and that's exactly what this place is, a NYC classic mirage, but it does it's job nicely and fixes your cravings up well.

First, as anyone knows who has been there, walked past, or read these reviews, the portions are ginormously, astronomically, ridonculously huge.  This is a great thing to me, as I am inherently greedy.  Of course, it would be better if my hotel room had a fridge to store the leftovers, but I blame the hotels for that, not Carnegie. (Jury rig a 'fridge' in your bathroom sink or buy a cooler at CVS).  First time I went there, me and mom both ordered separate sandwiches, her the turkey club and me the prime rib.  Wrong move!  You should have seen our faces slide to the floor when they showed up and set them on the table.  We both literally had to peer AROUND our sandwiches to make eye contact.  Now, as far as prime ribs go, it was decent, but I honestly don't know what I was thinking in ordering it for myself, since I'm not really a fan.  Actually, I brainfarted and was thinking roast beef but that's my fault.  Anyway, needless to say we both had like 4 full sandwiches of leftovers to take home and for her to throw away, since she left the next morning.  So that's my first tip - split a sandwich, its so worth the extra 3 bucks or whatever to do so.  oh yeah, and go early in the day so you have time to eat those leftovers that night before they spoil.  

Second time I went, I followed her move and ordered the turkey club, was smart and split it.  The thing is to ask for extra bread so when you break all that meat and bacon and stuff down you can make actual sandwiches, instead of open-faced halves.  With a little salt and pepper and some pickle juice it was golden.  I asked for bread when I left too, don't remember if/what they charged me but it wasn't much.  

So to me, the place is great for the sheer quantity of food, even at 20 bucks a sandwich.  The 'rents went back again and my dad had the huge pastrami and said it was really good, and mom had chicken salad and also liked it (but again, get extra bread and prepare for how much you're gonna get).  One of the best things about this joint is the pickles on the table.  I'm usually having to hold myself back from eating them all (and really spoiling the appetite for the ensuing sandwich).

Also, another think I really like about Carnegie is you can get an old-fashioned egg cream here, which is basically like a carbonated thin milkshake.  So freakin good.....  The malt is good too

I'm glad to see that Carnegie is now open 24hrs, because the first couple of times I went they closed at 2am and I remember wanting a sandwich so bad after leaving Jet.  So I'll definitely be kicking off my heels in there next time I go the club, I'm sure it'll all be SO much better at 4am after the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol....",-LUmRqjZdJGLB45pDaqdWA,2,1,5,isUOAFg7RsB5WaAq4u9cRQ

The soup was brought out and in the bowl was some noodles and the chicken soup in a little pitcher.  They pour the soup onto the noodles in front of you.  She loved the soup but I thought it was kind of bland.

Spread on some of their homemade mustard and take an occasional bite of their homemade pickles and everything just seems to meld with each other.  

I only ate half the sandwich and I took the rest home.  The waiter was nice enough to give me a little container to take some of the homemade mustard home so I packed the meat, mustard and a few pickles and used my own bread at home to make another sandwich and it was just as good.

Corned beef hash was really greasy and was mostly meat, only a splash of potato. Bacon was really greasy as well. Everything kind of tasted the same - there wasn't much flavor.

For once, I don't have a sweet description of the place. It's quite typical really as it's located inside The Mirage. I mean, I guess they feel the need to offer several types of cuisines for those that have different moods and appetites. And that's understandable. But when using such a name like Carnegie, one should at least match the quality and ingredients that go into a meal. Not saying that I didn't enjoy of course. 

When ordering, they were missing several key ingredients like Rye Bread and such. How can you run an establishment without a staple in some sandwiches?! I'm normally not very critical and quite understanding, but no Rye? Makes me wanna go Homer status. All good though as I ordered myself an open-bread Turkey and Gravy along with Mashed Potatoes or the Nosh, Nosh Nanette (apparently, named after a musical). The portions are HUUUUUUUUUUUGE!!!!!

....alright, I exaggerated just a tiny bit. But you guys get what I'm trying to put across. 

So other than them missing ingredients and such, I was actually pretty satisfied withe the whole experience. Adding of course that we drove the  Valley and enjoying our meal at 4AM and missing class the same morning, it was still quite delicious. I didn't get to have their cheesecake this time as I was ready to explode, put back into pieces, and blow up again!

Only one snaffu during our experience, they originally brought me cinnamon toast first and I showed the waitress Maria that I had in fact ordered the Cinnamon Roll.

Basically you order you food and pay at the front counter then find yourself a seat.

With that said about the outrageous prices, the sandwich that I got- pastrami on rye- was pretty good.  They PILE on the meat.  It's slightly obscene how much meat they put on there, I actually had to eat some meat before putting the slice of bread back on to eat it as a sandwich.  They also don't put anything on the sandwich like coleslaw or anything (which they should) so you're literally getting 2 pieces of bread around a mountain of delicious meat.  That could be a good or a bad thing- the taste was good, but I wish they'd do something else besides meat- make it more authentic, add some coleslaw or SOMETHING to it.

Needless to say, the place deserves 4 stars for the sandwich. 1.5 stars for the price and trying to prison rape my wallet and 3 stars for friendly staff and service.  So that's why I give 4 stars because I can't complain about the price- it's fuckin' vegas, and the food was good.

But just because the portions are huge doesn't mean quality is sacrificed! The salami was great, don't get me wrong, but the pastrami was deeeeeeeeelicious! Mmm.mmm...MMM! Not only that, but even the fries (5.99) were tasty and it was a huge heaping plate full!

This is a casual New York Simulated Style Restaurant where you order at the counter and seat yourself. The Real Original Carnegie Deli is Closed but they do source the Meats and Cheesecakes from Carnegie Warehouse in New York. 

*******I DO WARN YOU******** The sandwiches are VERY OVER STUFFED  (like 2 pounds of meat that feed 4 hungry people) and all the portions are EXTRA LARGE.

This restaurant is different than it was several years back. They used to serve you bowls of pickles and they no longer do that........and they used to give you the extra bread for your extra sandwiches....Now you have to ask for the bread.

We shared a Woody Allen Sandwich (Corned Beef and Pastrami) and a Potato Knish. The sandwich is ENORMOUS. Sadly the bread is very non-authenic as it's squishy like white bread with a few caraway seeds. Both meats are better than what my local supermarket sells but....Both meats are sort of dry and not succulent. They also aren't real flavorful like really good corn beef and especially good pastrami is...I also would prefer is the pastrami didn't have so much added smoke flavoring. They also only give you one pickle to share.

We also tried a potato knish. Again not the best tasting most flavorful knish but it's very large and is ok.

The sandwich is too much for two people. You need at least 4 HUNGRY people to eat the sandwich.

Ask for the extra bread for your leftovers.

I've had the others and in New York City, Carnegie reigns supreme...in my book, it is the holy grail of hot pastrami, almost a religious experience every time I dine there.  I love the hot pastrami on rye there (the only thing to order other than cheesecake) so much that I have been known to cab it there to have some while en route to a really fancy and expensive business dinner.  Yes, I love it that much.  Can you say revered?

I have been wanting to try the Vegas outlet of Carnegie Deli in the Mirage ever since it opened, but for the last three trips, I somehow just never made it there.  This time I was determined and was there for lunch within an hour of my arrival.  I ordered the hot pastrami (with pickles and mustard on the side) and it was everything I had hoped for.  

The sandwich was crazy tall and huge...you could barely get your mouth around it as it was so big.  The pastrami was so incredibly flavorful and juicy, just like at the Carnegie in New York City.  The sandwich was $15.95, but I was in total heaven.  It is exactly like that at the original location, the only difference being that it seemed just a touch spicier at the Vegas location which was just fine with me.  The service was great too.  

Struck up a conversation with an elderly couple next to me who did not know what to order and they ended up having the same thing and loved it.  The people at the other table noticed that they ordered it and started telling us how much they loved the hot pastrami here.  It was a recurring theme throughout the meal and it was as though we were all on a pilgrimage for hot pastrami sandwiches.  

Believe it or not, I ate the whole thing and was full for hours.  I actually had to postpone dinner and even then made it a super light one because of my sandwich at Carnegie.  When I finished eating, I remember saying to myself that I could die happy right now. That is one heckuva sandwich!",y3HFVx8nbNmomSc-PWOy-g,2,2,5,c5CUhPbCLO8EYgcfgrIE7A

French toast was not cooked completely and was raw on the inside. Coming from a European background I wanted to give their potato pancake a try don't do it! The pancake was very hard, and lacked overall flavor, it can be served with applesauce or sour cream I chose both but not worth the price. 
Dirty dog: too much to even bite, the dog itself was great but the bread was dry.

There was just as much meat in my sandwich...to the point where I had no idea how I was going to eat it... and at the halfway point... I couldn't bare to eat anymore... chances are, my heart would have stopped with another bite.

Overall, meh. It's a fine novelty, I will admit, but why it's at the Mirage and not New York, New York, I don't understand.  I would recommend sharing a sandwich with another person because someone with an average appetite is not likely to finish even half of their meal.

The Woody Allen is a pile of pastrami on top of a pile of corned beef.  The pastrami and corned beef play well in this sandwich.  They are the carnivore's version of peanut butter and jelly.

I ordered the bacon and eggs and got like 6 huge strips of bacon. There is no way in hell any person should eat that much bacon in one sitting! I also feel sorry for my brother who ordered the tuna melt and was disappointed that he didn't even take it to go, something that he rarely does.

There's Kosher Salamis hanging over the deli counter, drying to savory goodness.  The dessert case is drool-inducing.  It's even got the same black and white checkered tile floor as the original.

The Corned Beef is delectably packed with flavor and just fatty enough, and the spice of the Pastrami cuts through the richness.

The service here is not as rushed as in NYC, nor are the tables quite as closely packed (But they are tight.)

The cheesecake is as imposingly large as it is delicious.  I stick with the Fresh Strawberry.

It was pretty good! pile stacked between 2 slices of rye bread, it so soo big I couldn't fit it in my mouth. Sandwich was smokin' hot when I first bit into it.

The only downside is the price, obviously. It was expensive, and it was cold cut meat pretty much, so pretty raw, add your own sauce kind of thing. And yeah, they charge you a couple more extra bucks to share?! I don't understand the logic behind it. 

But, the BIGGEST sandwich I've ever had in my life! I went and tried it just to say that I did. My favorite portion is the beef tongue Yumm. And the pastrami was good, also. I was pretty happy, though it does get kind of tiresome after a while, hence I was so tired of meat afterward. They had a lot of great options on their menu also, so something here for everyone! I like their diner style booths and their pies look amazing. It does feel more like a fast food restaurant than anything, so don't expect anything spectacular. Service was rushed, also, and pretty nonexistent. 

But this review is for the sandwiches only. I would come back here for hot sandwich, but not the Woody Allen anymore. Just once in my life is enough. Is this place worth the price otherwise, though?

3421486,2009-08-13,1,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"First let me say that I was raised on good Jewish deli, homemade matzoh balls, homemade gefilte fish etc. I think I'm a pretty good judge of good deli. 

I'd eaten here for breakfast before and was quite happy. I'd say my only complaint is the portion size. They are absolutely ridiculous! The guy at the table next to us ordered a side of bacon(jewish deli,bacon?) I guess when he ordered a side he didn't realize it meant the entire side of the pig. It had to have been a pound when uncooked. It's one thing to give huge portions in a neighborhood deli where you might be able to take home your leftovers, but in a hotel with no in room fridge it means throwing away a lot of food. I guess it is Vegas, everything in excess. 

We came for lunch and were seated by the hostess then waited. . . and waited. . . and waited. When the waitress came over it was only to tell us she'd be right with us, we waited some more. Finally she came and took our order. 

I ordered the Pastrami Reuben. It's my favorite deli sandwich. I was expecting a sandwich similar to the other 150 or so I've eaten over the years. I was expecting pastrami, Swiss and sauerkraut on grilled rye. That's not how they make a Reuben here. They layed three small pieces of untoasted, ungrilled rye on the plate. This was then covered by a mountain(at least 3/4 of a pound) of the driest pastrami I've ever eaten in my life. on top of this was placed a nearly undetectable layer of kraut. This was all topped by 4-5 slices of Swiss. The entire plate was then placed under a broiler for about 15 seconds. The cheese wasn't even half way melted. $25 for a Reuben and you charge another $4.50 for the smallest side of slaw I've ever been served. 

My daughters matzoh ball soup wasn't much better. It was a decent matzo ball floating with some strange noodles in tasteless yellow salt water. I'm guessing the yellow was food coloring as I doubt a chicken ever touched that broth. 

On to what I will generously call service. Once we saw our waitress, everything came out fairly quickly, except our slaw. This we had to ask for. People have commented on how great the pickles were. I can't comment since I never saw any. We never saw our waitress again until she came to ask if we wanted dessert. Since the sandwich that I split($3.00 up charge) was hardly touched on both our plates it may have been a clue that we didn't want anything else. She left the check. It was incorrect. When we finally were able to flag her down to correct we didn't even have to tell her what was wrong. She said ""it's the two orders of slaw right?"" So she knew it was wrong when she set it down. Was she hoping we wouldn't notice? Was she thinking extra money for the restaurant will mean a bigger tip for her? 

Would I ever eat here for lunch or dinner ever again, not a chance! Would I come back for breakfast? Maybe. By the way, it was only because of my past breakfast experience that this place got two stars. 

I sure hope the Carnegie Deli in New York is better because the Las Vegas location takes the prize as the worst Jewish deli I've ever eaten in. Shame on you.",teTNl__Z0o3L6mTj5wxD8A,1,1,2,sk2Q49vtjdI3EgkuKIOz6A

The only highlight was an interesting tidbit from our server: The booth we sat in had a telephone. We were told that the owner of this place will sometimes call in and talk to the people seated at that booth to see how their experience is going... he lives on the East Coast or something.

Of course I had to experience their Corned Beef on Rye.  Yes, the sandwich was extremely expensive, but it was HUGE and I thought it was delicious.  I also really enjoyed their mustard and pickles.

Even though Carnegie is a deli typically specializing in deli meats, they actually had one of the best hamburgers I had in years.   The burger was not only moist and juicy but it had exceptionally good flavor.  Believe me, I was surprised such a burger can come out of a deli.  Their french fries were delicious as well.  Yes, everything pretty much comes ala carte but their french fries were tasty.

Lastly we ordered some dessert, yes their NY cheesecake is something you don't want to miss (especially if you love cheesecake).  But the surprise was their silk chocolate cake.  It was better than I had expected and was a fine conclusion to a meal.

Carnegie may be a NY deli cliche but they really do have some delicious selections and an exceptional burger.  If you come to LV and have a craving for deli meats, this is the place I would go.

3567179,2009-08-19,1,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"I would give the food one star, but I have to up it to 3 stars purely for comedic reasons.  

So, we came here at like 2am one night this last weekend and proceeded to order some odd items.  

Little did we know that they would take our odd orders and come right back and make it a millions times odder!  I don't think I've laughed this much during a meal in a LONG time. 

I LIKE!

So, I had just eaten ""dinner"" a couple hours earlier, so I went for something light.  Cereal seemed like a safe choice.  They had some terrible choices (Cheerios, Cornflakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran, not good options!), and I figured cornflakes was probably the least offending out of all of those choices.  My other friends ordered toast and blintzes.  

So, already it's like, yeah, that's some terrible and odd food choices we made right there.

Anyway.  We order, and then begins the oddness.

First up, the pickles.  We're sitting there, being silly animals as usual, and then the waitress comes by with 6 large pickles and just plops them on our table.  

. . .

I like pickles too, but something about seeing nothing on the table but pickles made the situation really funny.  We started laughing.

And then it never stopped because here comes more:

Our food comes.  They give me my cereal on a PLATE with the milk in some sort of large half-and-half pitcher.  

Um. . .

I flag down the waitress and ask her for a deeper bowl.  She says they don't have any bowls.  (WTF?!?!)  Er....so I'm supposed to eat my cereal off a plate??  She says she can give me another plate, and I'm like, um okay I'll take it because they gave me way too much cereal on that first plate.  I figured I could scoop some onto another plate for easier eating.  So, yes.  A giant plate with overflowing cereal, and milk sitting in the middle of all that cereal in a half-and-half pitcher.  With a side of pickles.

WEIRD!

Oh, and then we turn around and see that the guy behind us had this HUGE pastrami-looking sandwich that looked about a foot-tall.  We had to go and take pictures of that thing because it was truly monstrous.  He was a grown man, and he looked scared of it too.  My friend noted that ""even when he was finished with the sandwich, it was still 3896 feet tall!""  

AWESOME.

We went through our meal, laughing and shaking our heads.  By the end, the pickles were untouched, so I decided to give it a try.  I learned that pickles, dipped in apple sauce and sour cream (from the blintzes), are quite delicious!  Odd combination, but better than straightup sour!

All in all, one of the strangest meals I've never had, yet also one of the most fun and satisfying of my life too!

If you ever have a hankering for gigantic sandwiches where the meat is literally piled as high as your head, then you my friend, have come to the right place.

After indulging in Fat Tuesday's awesome big-ass drinks, we decided to eat here. For some reason, alcohol will imbibe some sort of food courage in you. Specifically the peach bellini with an extra shot.

My brother and sister-in-law were smart and decided to share the ""Woody Allen"", which was two lbs of meat (pastrami and corned beef, but they got all pastrami). My husband and I, alcohol in tow, decided against logic and each ordered our own ""Woody Allen"", all pastrami. Once the food came, our mouths dropped in amazement... These suckers were massive! Each half of the sandwich was precariously held together by wooden skewers. I took one bite and immediate felt giddy with happiness. Meaty, juicy, and packed with flavor... Definitely worth the $20+ price tag. We rashly ordered sides, but figured we might as well, since it was our last night in Vegas. Go big or go home, right? Two sides, coleslaw and pickles. The coleslaw was okay, but their house made pickles were delish! 

45 minutes later, we tapped out. Needless to say, our eyes were too big for our tummies because we both ate equivalent of half a sandwich... we should have just split one. Took our leftovers with us to eat as a late night snack.

I was here pretty much under the same circumstances as back around 2010, after seeing the Cirque ""Love"" show and being hungry for a deli sandwich and the legendary Carnegie Deli Cheescake, but things seemed to have changed.  The place was practically empty as compared to last time when we waited 45 minutes for a seat.  The menu is also smaller than I remember as well.  My biggest sadness was the Pastrami sandwich, no longer that huge, juicy pile of pastrami that fed 3 of us back then.  Now, the pastrami drier and the sandwich smaller, it did feed 2 of us though.  The fries it came with were pretty good, they did come out hot and hit the spot.

The biggest saving grace for me was that the cheesecake was still delicious (but also seemed smaller?)  The Carnegie Deli Cheesecake recipe is definitely on another level.  Super creamy and dense with an almost silky texture.  I'm a longtime cheesecake maker and eater and can be somewhat of a cheesecake snob and wholeheartedly vouch for Carnegie's cheesecake...as good as the one you used to be able to get at the NY deli, it really saddened my heart when they closed last December.

I'm sure at some point I'll be back to see the ""Love"" show since I'm a Beatles fanatic and will surely not hesitate to stop by here for more cheesecake, I'll definitely pass on the pastrami but that's fine, probably means I can eat 2 pieces of cheesecake instead.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,10,6,3,kqPe02b39oqmZpENLlpGKg

Yeah, it's a mountain of cheese, pastrami, and sauerkraut on top of two slices of rye bread and a bowl of Russian dressing.  I think with me going to Katz's Deli and having their epic pastrami last summer, it kind of spoiled me and made any NY style deli's pastrami inferior.  That was my take on Carnegie's pastrami.

Our waitress took our order, but accidentally forgot to get my husband's.  It took us a few minutes to track her back down to get her to take his order, too, so his food came out later than the rest of us, which was kind of weird.

Anyway, I asked to be seated and she sat me at a two top table that had place settings, but the table was still dirty with small pieces of pickle on the table....gross.

After browsing the menu, I almost left.  The prices were ridiculous!  I decided to stick it out and be a trooper and give the place a chance.  I ordered a $15.99 Hot Pastrami Sandwich on Rye Bread.....that's right folks.....that's not a typo....$15.99 for a Hot Pastrami Sandwich and it doesn't come with Chips or Fries.....FREE pickles though, which tasted pretty good.

To wash it down, I ordered an Iced Tea and Water.....the server didn't leave me any straws (I hate that by the way).....yet every other table around me had straws.....and I watched....nobody asked for them, they were just given to them by their server.  Maybe my server was having an off day....I don't know.

The food came out pretty fast.  The Pastrami Sandwich is your typical New York Style.......5 inches of meat that's impossible to put in your mouth.  Since my name isn't Joey Chestnut (Google him), I took a fork and pulled 20% of it out so that I could eat it like a normal person.

Besides the complimentary Pickles that were awesome, the other thing that saved this joint from a 1 Star was the Deli Mustard on the table.....man was it awesome!  I doused each bit with this Mustard....which made the sandwich edible because the Pastrami was dried out and too chewy.  Also, the crust of the Rye Bread was tough....had a Beef Jerky texture to it.....what?  I've never had Rye Bread like that......maybe it's normal, but not in my book.

I forced myself to finish it because I didn't want my $25 meal (Iced Tea was $3.50 for glass, plus tax and gratuity) to go to waste.  I'm not a cheapskate, but damn I can have some great meals for $25.

The bread is sturdy and helps you get all that delicious meat into your mouth.  They are big and messy - a perfect end to your night in Vegas!",xJxtHt9Rvdy75EMvVtcN9g,61,55,4,DIMGhzLAG5BgnbnFbRmWjg

But, out came only ONE pastrami sandwich!!!  Since it was huge, and the plate of fries was huge as well,  we decided to share it.  It filled us up for the time being,  but I can't believe they messed up our order.  I guess that's okay because we had a big steak dinner reservation planned for Cut later that night.

We hit this place for lunch at around 2:00 pm, I've heard of the place however since I've never been to the original in NY I can't compare it. The menu says they charge $3.00 for plate sharing??, He ordered the hot pastrami on rye and ordered a plate of fries. The server placed 2 glasses of water and a bowl of pickles on table. I'm not really a pickle fan but I was hungry so they tasted quite good not to tart and very fresh and flavorful. Pastrami arrived and all I could say was OMG WTF it's a fuck-in pound of meat on two pieces of bread???, plate of fries arrive promptly. We spit the sandwich and fries. fries were your basic fries nothing specular no fireworks etc. The pastrami was tender, fat free, no grizzle and very flavorful. nothing like what I get at the delis or the Hat. We gave it out best to finish the pastrami, we both left about 3 bites and 1/4 lb of pastrami on the plate. Service from the day crew was great. 
Damage: food $24.00, tax $2.00 tip $5.00 

We also tried this place at 2;30 AM after a night of gambling,singing dancing,drinking and who knows what else. DH wanted the pastrami again. I opted for breakfast since it was the early morning hours so I got the eggs over-easy with fries (for DH) and wheat toast for me. Pastrami arrived promptly, for some reason they gave our water and pickles to the drunk gals next to us who ordered desert??? My over-easy eggs arrived scramble, i asked the female server if these were over-easy after much eye rolling, she said she be right back. My food arrived after DH polished off 1/2 his sandwich. Asked for a side of mayo to dip my fries in which arrived after I ate 2 eggs and my fries were cold. Sandwich was good, my $8.95 breakfast was not the best I've had.

They pack their sandwiches like a mile a thick full of meat so of course they're going to charge you if you decide not to get anything else and share it. Fries aren't included!

I ate at Carnegie probably a total of three times on my last visit to Vegas. Their home fries are THE ISH and I'm not even exaggerating. I was seriously considering getting them for dinner but I thought it would be too weird. For breakfast, I've had the mushrooms & onions omelette and the fried onions omelette. You get your choice of bread (or bagel), and home fries or french fries. GET THE HOME FRIES. I don't know what kind of magical excellent crack they sprinkle on those things but they are the most excellent home fries. Their omelettes were huge. I was able to divide them into two meals both times.  The onions were sliced thick and you could tell they were fresh. 

Their combination matzoh balls and noodles soup was a pleasant experience. This was the first time I've actually tried a matzoh ball. It's on the plainer side but it reminded me of a mixture of tofu and ground beef all mashed together to make this healthy tasting meatball. They serve it to you in a plate and the soup is served separate. Once they serve it to you is when you should pour in the chicken broth and mix it all together. Very cool! I appreciate them taking into consideration the potential mushyness the noodles can get if the noodles and soup were served together. They portioned this just right. I was satisfied in the end.

Although I frequented Carnegie on my last stay, I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to come eat here. It's just A-OK in my book.",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,0,0,3,6LWbTTI6_Hv5GMGXqxMTJA

My husband and I were smart......we SPLIT a pastrami sandwich, and it was perfect.  They give so much meat, so we were definitely full.  I had ordered a side of coleslaw to go with it, and it was pretty darn tasty, too.  Cheesecake is STILL divine.  My children got the Woody Allen, which was a RIDICULOUS amount of corned beef AND pastrami together.  I raised them to know that rye bread goes with pastrami, but I failed somewhere because they ordered this on wheat.  I won't tell my dad.  LOL.  Naturally, they didn't come close to finishing, and we, of course, couldn't put the leftovers in our refrigerator because of the stupid cost per ounce to hold things in there.  Don't get me going on that one.  Certainly not Carnegie's fault.  I was happy to learn that all the leftovers are not wasted.....they get fed to a pig farm.  Interesting !!!

I didn't get to try this place in NYC but here in Vegas, you can get any kind of food imaginable from anywhere. Anyways we were stuffed from lunch so we picked up something to go later in the night. One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of two. But since we weren't that hungry, we ended up with some leftovers. Luckily our hotel had a mini fridge and we were able to save some for the next day. We ended up with a pastrami sandwich. I was eyeing their most famous corned beef and pastrami combo sandwich but just thinking of the size of that and at $20, I just couldn't do it. Although the plain pastrami was already $17. Sandwich was fixed up pretty quickly and we were on our way. Oh and we got a choice of breads but  stuck with the typical rye. Man the 'wich was huge. No way could the height of it fit in my mouth.  But wow, really flavorful without being too salty. And moist too. Some fat in the meat too which is bad for my health but makes it takes oh so yummy. A lot of deli's have either really salty pastrami or dry, no flavor meat. This was a good balance. It also came with the necessary (two) pickles and the pickle really helps with a different texture and taste to break up all that meat you're devouring. Wow, not sure I could part with almost 20 bucks for a sandwich all the time but this hit the spot this one time. And you should splurge every once in a while, especially on vacation.",shVyD312LNnLUvQEPdzo7g,0,0,3,dKeCBGgUIxCXecBS3LIi2Q

They were happy to, and wow, what a difference that made. Crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked cheese on the inside. As I said, exquisite. I have attached the before and after pictures.

We also tried their potato pancakes and potato knish. The potato pancake was even better than what they used to serve at the Manhattan location! Thinner, crispier, tastier. Really good. The potato knish was huge! (Plan to share it.) It had a very light, flaky crust and had a really well spiced, very flavorful, and not too heavy potato filling.

Ordering is quite simple. Just place your order at the counter and take a buzzer before grabbing a seat. I have no idea what the buzzer was for since a server brought our meals to the table and took our little device before it even went off. 

The sandwiches are most definitely large enough to split. My husband and I had a buy one get one offer through our MyVegas rewards, so we each bravely got our own sandwich. We knew we wouldn't have any room for sides or desserts so we didn't bother with anything else. Beware... though the portions are big, they are pricey. Our two sandwiches and two drinks cost $44. However, after using our BOGO offer and a casino comp, our total came down to just $0.00. That's my kind of bill. ;) 

I had turkey on sourdough with all the regular garden toppings and my husband had a plain turkey and bacon on wheat. Each had a full pound of meat. It was good, but tasted just like any other turkey sandwich I'd ever had in my life... there was just more of it. My husband bet me that I couldn't finish half of it and I proved him wrong by cleaning my entire plate. I'm a tiny girl with an appetite, so Carnegie definitely delivered when it came to satisfying my hunger. Now, can you complete the challenge?",Y_t5q-UsgTwUEnzAQ73u1g,1,1,3,x1RTkw8SDTQc4O783KQfUw

Now I don't mind shelling out the bucks when the food's good and the service is rockin', but Carnegie Deli had neither going on that night.  The waitress declined to state that adding cheese to a sandwich was an extra $1.50 and lettuce & tomato was an extra $1.00.  She also somehow heard ""turkey sandwich"" when I unmistakeably said corned beef.  The restaurant was *not busy* and there were tons of waiters working, but we never got our pickles even though other tables around us did, so I finally had to ask for them.  I don't know what was going on that night, but a bunch of the waiters appeared to be getting into an argument right by our table.

And then I got to watch my corned beef sandwich go cold on the service counter for 10 whole minutes until the waitress finally brought it over.  Because I'd added cheese and lettuce and was splitting with a friend, my tepid sandwich ended up costing over $20.  BEFORE TIP.  I hope this restaurant burns down!!!!

Since the last time I was here they changed things. The servers no longer take your order. You order at the counter, get a number and a receipt, and then once at a table a waiter picks up your receipt and brings you your food. You also have the opportunity to tip when you order, which I did with the assumption we would get good service. Wrong! Our waitress was awful. She saw us sit but continued to set her tables for a good 10 minutes before acknowledging us. When she did come over she got our drinks and the food came out fairly quickly. That's when the service ended. She literally disappeared. I needed sauce because my sandwich was dry. Went to to the counter and they told me to ""ask my waitress"". When I responded ""I would if I could find her"" they recluctantly handed me one and said if I needed more to ask my waitress. Well that couldn't happen because she never came back. We finished our meal, choked it down since she never refilled our water, then we sat there with empty plates that never got picked up. We had been eyeing their desserts since we walked in so I decided to order a piece of cake and a glass of milk. Even though they cut my slice right in front of me they gave me a number and said the waitress would bring it to the table. So again, we waited. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, and then I became really irritated and walked to the counter and asked for them to just hand me my damn cake. Seeing my obvious irritation the sent over a manger and when told of my experience she did apologize and not charge me for my dessert as well as gave me her card so I can return and be taken care of correctly this time. (When she saw the manager the waitresses suddenly miraculously appeared and started clearing away plates. (Seriously this woman was nowhere in sight the whole time we were eating and waiting for the cake) The managed and the food are the only reason they get 2 stars.

Not to mention the potential for inducing heart attacks is immeasurably increased. It must be part of the appeal / gimmick, but too bad larger sizes don't translate to better food quality.

We were here for breakfast at 8 AM after a long night of partying and gambling (we hadn't slept yet) so at this point everything * should * have tasted good, right?

My Grilled Cheese with ham was hearty and a decent size -- thankfully not a monstrosity. The ""Hash Browns"" were more like a plateful of overcooked potato chunks, most of which were too hard in texture to eat. The ""Side of Bacon"" turned out to be an overflowing platter of much-too-crunchy, strange looking meat strips.

Service was friendly when we arrived, but seemed more hassled as the room began filling up for breakfast.

Price - I expected to pay a lot, but I had a mushroom omelette, side of bacon, and a coffee; $29, before tip.  That's ridiculous.  There was nothing special about the breakfast.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything I'd come back for.

Food service was quick.  Waitress was sort of attentive.  Coffee was not refilled without asking.  Only two creamers on the table, no more offered, none replaced with refill.  The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full but I found myself getting up to find creamers, sugar and hot sauce from other tables.

Bacon was thin and greasy. Nothing special.  I was hoping for thick cut flavorful bacon.

So, the message is, if you need breakfast you can get it here and the service is pretty quick.  It's obscenely overpriced and isn't anything to write home about, but it's eggs and coffee and sometimes that's all that matters.",tCGDX3IyNop6jvBUpaQArg,1,0,3,JF-aYCqK0KAdmpB-s9KrDA

The sandwich was really good, every ingredient was delicious. The meat made up most of the sandwich and was piled high with plenty of melted cheese on top.

It has the Carnegie Delicatessen has the ""NY"" feel to it and located almost in the middle of the casino. Open 24hours they offer a good selection of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Prices here at Carnegie Delicatessen are on the high side. Basic breakfast items such as omelets, pancakes, and such, starting around $8 and goes as high as $20. Sides here will run you around $4 - $5. For lunch they offer a good selection of hot and cold sandwiches and things like chicken livers, hash, meatloaf, etc starting around $12 - $24. Pretty spendy for the type of food you get that usually runs about at half the price. 

For breakfast, just needed something to fill the stomach and got a basic bagel and cream cheese. The bagel, well for a ""NY"" deli, tasted something I could get at Costco. Honestly, nothing special. Everyone else got eggs and one guy got a burger and fries at 6AM and they ate it because after a night of drinking, what else are you going to do. The waitress at this time was a bit bitchy, but not sure if it was us or she was just in a foul mood. Also the service was slow and she forgot my friend's fries. 

When I came here for lunch with my brother, service here was nonexistent. They had plenty of servers, at one point I think I counted about 4 or 5 of them gathered just chatting away in a corner while several of us were waiting to get served and several tables had dirty dishes on them. 

Brother was suffering from a hangover and decided to get the mozaball soup and I got the hot dog and some fries. When we got our food, I have to give them credit for their portion size. My brother got a big bowl of soup and I got literally a foot long hot dog and a plate of fries piled up high. My brother didn't like his soup at all and this even suffering from a massive hangover when anything tastes good. My hot dog was decent though the homemade sauerkraut was excellent. It was probably a notch better than a hotdog you would be able to get at Costco as it was a bit spicy which I liked. The fries were ok. Nothing special to report about. 

The waitress on the other hand, was more interested in talking to her fellow servers than say, bring us a bill. My brother and I waited about 15 minutes before we flagged down someone else to bring us our bill and that took an additional 10 minutes as 2 other tables in our same area requested the same thing. 

As to rating, honestly the food is just average but its WAY overpriced. The service here is just plain lousy both times I came here.

Definitely the biggest of big jewish deli pastrami sandwiches Ive ever seen.  Comically big and fun experience just to see.  However, as far as taste goes their pastrami is a little bland and dry compared to Langers and Kats.  I suspect the original location may not have this problem and this may be a case of the Vegas version not as good as the original.  It is decent though and better than your run of the mill pastrami.  Here are some cool things we ordered and were unable to finish.

Woody Allen - King of kings.  Mountain of pastrami and corn beef with bread hidden somewhere in there.  Definitely picture worthy.

Jeffs Favorite - Plate of pastrami or corn beef with a sweet delicious potato knish hidden underneath.  Once you break through the meat exterior and hit the knish center youll be pleasantly suprised.  I added some sauerkraut.

I have been here before and walked out because there is no reason to wait 45 minutes for food. The service was horrible.

This time I got it to go. The corned beef had some kind of weird taste, like cinnamon almost. And the bread...OMG it was awful.

A NY deli should have the best Rye bread in the world and NOT the worst. The bread fell apart, had very little rye seeds and was pretty much cheap bread they probably bought at Costco. Actually, I have had rye bread from Costco that was much better.

$18 for a sandwich is just not right. It should be the best in the world. I call this worst Corned beef on rye I have ever had.

The server then said that you have to actually request the egg specifically - even though it says it comes with a fried egg. I guess I should just be happy that it came with beef despite my not requesting it. Also it doesn't come with bread - so it's just a pile of chopped beef and oily potatoes. Pass.

4654878,2013-03-26,7,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"On the second night of my staycation with my brother and dad who flew in from New York, we were up for a New York deli. We decided on trying the Carnegie Deli, a restaurant I must of passed by a thousand times.

  Carnegie Deli has the distinction of being one of those restaurants where a nice overpowering deli smell leads guests to the establishment. As soon as I walk in the Mirage I could smell the deli smell beyond BLT, Starbucks,  and the Sugar Factory. The issue is that everytime that I looked at their menu, the prices were overpowering. Today we'd give it a try.

  There are two cues for Carnegie Deli. One is for take out and the other is for dining in.

   The dining room is spacious.  The restrooms are outside in the casino. Throughout the restaurant are pictures showing the history of Carnegie Deli.

   Carnegie Deli has a long history. It was established in 1937 at the intersection of 7th Avenue at 55th Street in Midtown Manhattan.Throughout the years they have received accolades. In 1979, NY Times critic Mimi Sheraton named Carnegie Deli the #1 pastromi in New York City. Years later, in 2009 Dr. Phil gave a shout out that Carnegie Deli makes the best sandwiches later. On March, 26 2013 I am giving a shout out that Carnegie Deli made the thickest pastrami sandwich that I ever ate.

   The Carnegie Deli website claims that all of their sandwiches are stuffed with at least one pound of meat. Finishing the pastrami on rye bread was one of the biggest dining challenges that I faced in awhile. Part of the problem is that I am not crazy over pastrami. Especially the $17 price. Carnegie offers other sandwiches that include Corn beef ($17.99), beef or brisket ($17.99), chop liver ($17.99), roast beef ($17.99), turkey ($17.99), bologne or salami ($14.99), shrimp salad ($12.99), and egg salad ($10.99). If I return I will most likely order the shrimp salad sandwich. If they are serving me a pound of that stuff I will up my rating to 4 stars. With the sandwiches are pickles. All three of us shared a bowl of french fries-a grand portion indeed. For a beverage there is fountain Coke or bottles of Dr. Brown's soda.

  Carnegie Deli's motto is that if you can finish your meal we've done something wrong. My motto is that when a sandwich costs $17, I am going to finish my meal. Unfortunately I was so stuffed that I passed over trying their renoun cheesecake.  That could be for another time.

I heard good things from a coworker that swears by the Corned Beef here. I decided to check this out last time I was in Vegas and was not disappointed. 

The Woody Allen is a massive delicious corned beef and pastrami sandwich. The corned beef and pastrami are piled high here so sharing is definitely recommend. At $24 a sandwich I thought it was good, but just a little overpriced.

I am comparing this to Langer's and Canters in LA, definitely ranks #1 out of those three places so far in my opinion,

Fries were good, but nothing special. I ordered a Lemonade with my meal, and I don't know if it was because I was just thirsty, but it was most excellent.

It truly has the potential to be a really good and fun place but it just does not live up to the fame. The pastrami is has more fat and is not as tender as I am used to, their corned beef is cut so thin that it loses much of the flavor it had (or it possibly never had the flavor), the pickled herring is covered in way too much mayo (who covers pickled fish in may anyhow, a good dish turned awful!!!). It was just disappointment after disappointment. One of the key elements to a good sandwich, particularly an all meat sandwich is the bread the bread was awful to say the least, it was no better than a mid-priced loaf at a cheap grocery store.

I ended up getting the matzo ball soup and he got the salami & egg breakfast sandwich.  The matzo balls were huge but good and filling.  I was surprised and disappointed though that it was just the balls and chicken broth, no veggies or chicken.  There was an option for noodles to be added but that would have made this bowl of soup $12.  Good but stingy with additions for the price tag.  His salami and egg sandwich was just okay nothing really special at all.  We also didn't like how they diced the salami up so small!

My Matzo ball soup arrived first. It was heavenly and just hit the spot. I had a Dr. Brown's soda with it and it came in a glass bottle that was a first usually it is always in a can.

We stopped by The Carnegie Deli located in the Mirage Casino complex for a quick lunch bite before heading out for the afternoon.  There is nothing small about the sandwiches in this place.  The seating is tight, so we were able to get a good view of the many items being served.  The two of us split a pastrami sandwich ($3 to split a sandwich) with enough left over to take back to our daughter for lunch as well.  It was the smaller of two sizes priced at $16 and was huge.  They guy 2 tables over from us ordered the larger size for $20 with 2  1/2 pounds of meat.  He barely ate half.  We ordered fries with the sandwich for $3.99 and they came on a platter with enough fries for 5 people.  We saw others that ordered the hot dogs which had to be about a foot long.  The guy on the other side of us ordered a turkey sandwich that was at least 7 inches high.  They put New York style dill pickles on the table for a pre-meal snack.  You will not leave this place hungry.  Our check was around $27, we would definitely eat here again.",VEfJ1H1WJeo_kLM16B6xQA,0,0,4,TdlWlarDkaZfIurYUSAkJQ

I think they read my review because on this visit there was brown deli mustard on every table. I'm not sure what brand it was, but had a nice flavor. Maybe a little Dijon added to it, but still a brown deli mustard and not the grey poupon they were trying to pass off for the last couple of years. I got the $22 Ruben and had them make it half pastrami and half corned beef. Although the menu says no substitutions, my waitress managed to pull it off for me. But no guarantees that you can order it that way in the future. The pastrami side was a little more juicy than the corned beef side. This Ruben can't be finished by one person, I gave it a good go and got through about 2/3rds of it before giving up. It really is for sharing. I asked the waitress if anyone has ever finished one, she said no. Now I'm sure one of those Nathan's Hot Dog eating champions could do it. But for your normal big eater, it's not going to happen. I've even finished the Woody Allen a few times. But this Ruben and it's 8 thick slices of melted swiss cheese covering corned beef that is 4"" thick on a plate that is about 12"" long. Add about an inch of sauerkraut and serve it on 4 slices of rye bread...enough said.

Since last being in Vegas many moons ago, I reminisced about the Stage Deli in The Forums. Where their deli sandwiches were the best we've ever had and the cheesecake flown in fresh from NYC were the ultimate. 
Recently we came across Carnegie Deli, located in the Mirage and it looked impressive with their own cured meats. Sandwiches were thicker than I could stretch my mouth and it made my eyes physically look bigger than my stomach. 

Tonight we tried the corned beef sandwich which like many reviews it was very good, with perfect flavorings and very tender. We also tried the hot pastrami, it lacked flavor and was very disappointing considering the proportion of the sandwich.  I had to add a LOT of pepper to make it taste decent. Lastly, we had to try the ""famous"" burger, which they advertise that they grind the burger meat themselves. Thumbs up for making a juicy burger, but again that lacked flavor.  It's almost like going to a steakhouse and ordering a succulent, juicy porterhouse and they don't season it.",bV1qRiqEAIZNPFRd2jIhRg,1,0,2,uTDPV9WWK4Q6iX6ZtWORkg

4916441,2012-04-22,0,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"A  quick look at my photos from my dinner at the Carnegie Deli will show just how very far this place is from New York.

I'm not a huge fan of Pastrami sandwiches as big as my head.  I'm sensitive to salt, so long ago said goodbye to massive amounts of processed meat.  A few slices at a time?  Yes, please.  The sandwiches at this restaurant each hold more than a year's worth of lunchmeat for me.  

What I love are pirogue and blintzes.  Love them so much that I served pirogue on my wedding buffet, each of them hand made by my elderly Polish neighbor.  Blintzes bring me back to childhood, leaning past my grandmother's elbow as she flipped crepe after crepe.  When she died I inherited the frying pan that she used to make the crepes for her blintzes.  I realize that these childhood experiences might make me pickier than normal, but I am also lenient.  The blintz pan hasn't been used in years, and I buy my pirogue in the freezer section.  

Unfortunately, Carnegie Deli also buys their pirogue in the freezer section.  I suspect that they buy larger portions than I do, but these tasted nothing like homemade.  
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wxwEK9cfsowGRcjiYv3KSQ&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw They were deep fried, and bland.  I was so thankful that I had thought to ask for onions, because they were not served as a standard part of the meal. I'm so sorry that they were what made me happiest in my dining experience.

The blintzes were an abomination.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qp0F6LQ3Z8tRUnLXqFKrYw&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw Deep fried and filled with what can best be described as pancake batter blended with cheese bits.  It was truly awful, and had nothing to do with an actual plate of blintzes.  

And finally the only almost bright spot (at least color wise!) in my meal, the stuffed cabbage.http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=O_wCcHuL0WxqEVM2Ab5uyw&userid=dyEc-BsP_qPzIWyiMW0BPw  This was not awful, but was not wonderful.  The sauce was far too sweet, but was tasty enough.

To add insult to injury, the bill for my portion of dinner was nearly $30.  I ate as much of it as I could, but left at least as much behind.  No need to complain, because there was no quick remedy for what was wrong.

My gf and I were looking for a quick bite before our Cirque show that night at the Mirage. We decided to stop by Carnegie's since it looked cheap and quick. 

First of all, this restaurant is dirty. The floors were sticky and the table had dried mayo/mustard stuck on it. To be honest, that kind of set the tone for the rest of the meal. Anyway, I ordered the egg salad sandwich ($7.95)and my gf ordered the turkey sandwich ($14.99). The server asked my gf if she would like cheese, lettuce, tomatoes or anything else on the sandwich. Without thinking too much about it, she simply replied with ""sure"". We also had an order of Matzo balls in chicken broth ($6.95).

The soup came out first and it was pretty tasty. For those of you who don't know, Matzo balls are these giant meatballs made of dough but without the meat. It was tasty and hit the spot after a long 4 hour drive  from LA to Vegas. My egg salad sandwich tasted funky. I couldn't exactly put my finger on what it was, but it tasted as if it might have been spoiled or rotten. My gf's turkey sandwich was monstrous. I took a bite and it tasted pretty normal for a turkey sandwich.

When the bill came, they apparently charged extra for cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. $2 for the cheese, $1 for the lettuce and $1 for the tomatoes. What kind of a restaurant charges extra for lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese on a sandwich? Aren't sandwiches supposed to come with these things? We ended up paying almost $20 for a freakin' turkey sandwich. The same kind you get at Subway for $6. 

All in all, we paid about $40 for two sandwiches and a bowl of soup. I would give it a lower rating if it weren't for the tasty Matzo ball soup. If you are staying in the Mirage, you can probably find better alternatives to Carnegie's.",ZNgHbkCzBgH1qyLxtAfu3A,0,0,2,kma4Q995gzbuOHMEbpzDUA

Just as well, it saved us a $50 cover charge and now we were going to eat.  Not wanting to go far, we stumbled over to the Carnegie Delicatessen with our large party.

As we waited in line, everyone went through the dramatics of the night.  It was our turn when the host started to close off the line.  I was confused for a moment, thinking he wasn't going to let us in.  He proceeded to motion for us to follow and he had a table waiting for us already!  Sweet...except that he had only counted ten as two other people had joined us in the line late.  It's okay, we were able to have our additional party of two nearby.

Yummy pickles were placed in front of us and I wish I had more.  The menu was huge and I didn't even know where to look.  The BF wanted ""The Woody Allen"", a gigantic sandwich with loads of pastrami and corned beef ($15.95).  The waitress warned us that it was a big sandwich, as high as our water glass.  We were fine with it as we were sharing.  Indeed, it was a big one, as you can see for yourself from the photo above.  Everyone asked if I was going to get that all in my mouth...uh, hello...I'm a lady...in a dress!  Yeah, I'm busting out with a fork and knife thank you!  You definitely need to smear that mustard all up on your meat to give it a zing.  I didn't really care for the bread though.  The BF finished his half and my leftovers went home.  (They were a bit dry the next day, but if you add some olive oil and stick it in the toaster oven, it's damn good again!)  

Our waitress was a doll and so was one of the busgirls.  When a table cleared up closer to our table of ten, I asked if we could move the table over so our other party of two could join us.  The waitress said of course, but then as she walked away, the mean old busboy started taking the chairs away!  I told him we were actually going to use that table and he said, ""No! We're closed!""  Uh, we hadn't even received our food yet, so I KNOW it wasn't a problem for them, he was just a complete asshole!  The busgirl ended up overriding him and gave us the table (yay for her!) and so our party of 12 was together again.

Things are a la carte here, so no fries with your burger or sandwiches.  But with them being so big, I guess you don't really need them.  They also have breakfast served all day and specialties like ""hot tongue"" and ""chopped liver"" to entice your palette.  My friend got an ""Order of Bacon"" ($5.50), and I do mean an order, it's definitely not a side! 

Five stars for the host trying to be efficient by counting heads for our party without asking us how many we were and one star for the jerk of an ass old man busboy who hates his job.

My husband had his usual of the mile high Pastrami Sandwich, and I ingested two bowls of Matzo Ball Soup. Yes, two bowls... When you are that sick, the thought of eating on previous days was not appealing. All it took was that golden bowl of broth and Matzo to make me feel a little bit better for the day. 

The food was great as per usual at Carnegie. However, being in a smokey casino kind of sucked. The servers are also really rude but they had lines wrapped around the place. So I guess they were just worn out and short with people as per usual.",viWTEfvvM-YK-jU-gPS9FA,1,1,3,s9qDHBlRPJiw_iKV5iCjKA

Last year when we came here we were a little disappointed in the corned beef. It seemed like the quality wasn't as lean as what we usually get. We thought maybe we had a bad batch and would give them a try next time we were in Vegas. This year we went with the corned beef again and it was excellent. The beef was very lean and the portion size is huge. There's enough for two people to easily share this sandwich.

Having a deli in the middle of the Las Vegas strip is very very tricky! 
People expect to get HUGE portions, but to pay affordable price. For most delis that would work, but for a deli that I located at the Mirage casino it just can't happen. 

The food is good! It's very tasty- 
The sandwiches are big. 
Their shnitzel is crispy and good.
Their turkey sandwich is yummy.
Their matzoh ball soup is just like grandmas. 

One of the best parts is actually the service! 
Super nice friendly servers will do ANYTHING to make you happy! Especially Pam- she did a fantastic job! 
And been doing that for years! 

Another cool thing about this spot is that they give discounts to locals! 
And this thing can be an issue because this place is expensive!

Since we found out there was a Carnegie located in the Mirage Hotel, it was a perfect time to give their famous hot pastrami sandwich a try.

The chicken noodle soup ($6.99) and the chicken soup with matzo balls ($7.99) are a must order!  The noodles were small and tender.  Both soups come with a chicken soup which is flavorful and extremely comforting.  Definitely perfect for the morning after a long Vegas night.

The hot pastrami sandwich ($16.99) was a disappointment.  A large amount of pastrami is stacked between two pieces of bread (choice of rye, white, or pumpernickel) and served with a side of pickles and dijon mustard.  Though I ordered a HOT pastrami sandwich, it came out room temperature and the meat was dry.  I thought maybe I just got a dud, but my friends said the same thing after eating there a day later. 

WHAT TO KNOW:

NYC:  ""Next"".  A pause.  ""Hey buddy, get to the back of the line if you don't know what you want""

Vegas:  ""Good afternoon, what would you like to have""  A pause.  ""Take your time""


NYC:  Open the grease soaked paper wrapping and expose a four inch pile of juicy pastrami, brisket, or tongue on thin sliced rye.  Slather on the mustard.  Grab some pickles.  Get primal animal.

Vegas:  An inch and a half of over steamed, dry edge pastrami on thick sliced rye to keep your fingers clean.  Mustard in a squirt bottle and a pickle served in your personal dish.

An insult to the venerable institution that is arguably serves the best pastrami in the US (sorry, Katz's and Langer's).

Straight to it, post renovation in late 2014, things have changed.  Once known for crazy massive sandwiches with six inches of meat, a quarter head of lettuce, portions are now manageable.  All good as prices have also fallen.  They now offer a half sandwich, side and drink combo that a normal human can consume.  Great.   The menu is greatly reduced with many Jewish deli staples now gone.  Predesigned sandwiches with various meats are gone.  Sad yes, but the ultimate problem, the food isn't the same quality.

The legendary pastrami, while just as flavorful, sweet and salty deep beef flavor with the perfect oily mouth feel, has dry edges.  The brisket, suffers the same problem.  Pickles taste like they've been drained instead of being pulled fresh from a crock and brine.

While many times better than your local supermarket deli, it's just doesn't measure to past greatness.

The Vegas location never captured the true spirit of Carnegie Deli's NYC location with its gruff service and no nonsense, good eats, unfortunately the difference is now more than just its personality and geography.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,22,16,3,F-ficgWQiTXQOkH_-P03fg

It's not the best corned beef I've ever had, probably because they have to cook it in industrial cafeteria-size batches; you're really paying for the nostalgia and sheer size. Plus, when we went on a Saturday morning, the service was pitiful. There were a lot of staff, but it seemed like everyone was working the counter, and we were disappointed we didn't get better or faster service.",eZoqpGzgT4WvsEmBkVTPPA,1,0,2,mNMhT2kzR16P0BfZCWEa9A
5198993,2011-01-17,9,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"Granted, hunger makes me moody and judgmental, but my experience at Carnegie made me moodier than a New Yorker pushing her way onto the 9 train. Soup sounded like the ideal late night snack, and when you think soup, how can you not think Matzo ball? So, we arrived and ordered this potentially brilliant treat.

In the meantime, my husband was trying to find out if their bagels were true New York bagels. Our waitress had little idea, and my husband got up to ask the hostess. She said, ""Everything is just like in New York."" However, about that time, the chef showed up and said the bagels came from Great Buns. I doubt the bagels are going from Great Buns to Manhattan. The whole bagel episode frustrated me. 

Then the soup arrived. The Matzo balls were giant and yellow-tinged. The broth came on the side, and the waitress ceremoniously poured it over the lurking balls. That was the most exciting part of this experience. There was not a morsel of chicken to be found and not a single vegetable, not even a carrot sliver! After my first slurp, I pronounced the broth flavorless, but then my husband took a sip and said he kinda liked it. So, I continued to ladle it into my mouth. Honestly, however, it was pretty flavorless and an unappetizing shade of yellow. 

I thought I may be in a mood, so I decided to snap into a pickle, as pickles generally make me happy. However, there was no snapping to be done. The pickles were as mushy as the Matzo, and the flavor was the most insane combination of salty and sour. It was an insult to pickles. It made me want to cry. It was late. 

I was tempted to give one star, but out of all fairness, I only had soup and a bite of pickle. Still, I am not sure I would trust a place that can't impress me with those two simple items.

Located inside The Mirage, 24-hour New York staple Carnegie Deli had long been one of those restaurants I figured I would 'eventually' patronize - the menu featuring a few items of interest but the Las Vegas Boulevard upcharge seemingly unjustified by 'deli food,' no matter how good - an early morning breakfast finally sparked by a group of friends staying at the hotel and the result a good time with surprisingly good food despite prices I'd still label exorbitant.  Bringing the signature 7th street delicatessen to a surprisingly small space just off the gaming floor where a few trios and quartets sat basking in the glow of the prior night's escapades behind enormous sandwiches and cauldrons of matzo ball soup it was to friendly service and overhead Sinatra that we arrived and seated immediately orders followed in an equally expedited manner, a total of perhaps nine items ordered but my focus on three plus a half-dozen refills to my cup of coffee.  Speaking first to my favorite 'appetizer,' the $8.50 slice of carrot cake proved competent and not overly sweet, but perhaps as a result of our early morning visit and a cake from last night the crumb delivered slightly dry and under-spiced - the impressive cream cheese icing thankfully buoying the dish, though none of it nearly as impressive as the $13.95 fried cheese blintzes whose light eggy tones and balanced parts savory meets sweet proved excellent on their own, yet far better with house-made applesauce taken bite-for-bite.  Eschewing  meats or omelets, though all looked good, it was in a Jewish deli's Challah that I placed my trust for a 'main course' and with three thick slices soaked in batter, fried golden in butter, and drowned in maple syrup I really could not have asked for more, the stack a veritable bargain at $10.95.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,2,3,Fvi_X69-9Rf5jDnT8IrhJg

I would say half a sandwich would get you full. Anything more is way too much. But for 16-21 bucks a piece you will have two meals.. at least.

One tip I have is if you do get the large sandwich, make sure you have at least 2 different kinds of meats because it sure gets hard to eat after a while, especially since the taste of the meat gets old real fast when it's the same thing over and over again. My recommendation: corned beef and beef tongue.

The other tip is to maybe just split the sandwich with someone else, but be aware there's a $3 sharing fee associated with that.",7fZu8ud7JXFthU0jPxVf4g,1,1,4,_nRiP-lx0EHLLpoU75FJoQ

It feels like you're dining in a New York deli and designed as an authentic deli restaurant with Vegas strip pricing. 

I ordered the Roast Beef Sandwich and that was humungous. I shared half of it with my friend and she couldn't finish it! Originally I was thinking of ordering the corn beef sandwich but it was just too massive to finish and a total diet killer! 

Service was over the top and and didn't disappoint. In fact our server was checking in on us even though he was slammed with customers and that is a multi tasking skill that every server should have.

This is the same Carnegie you can find in NYC, minus the fact this one takes credit cards, NYC only cash.

This place isn't cheap but it sure is worth it.

Hands down the best Deli in Las Vegas, and one of the best in the Western United States.  The Reuben here is legendary. Understated on the menu, but good luck on finishing it'! Do yourself a favor--  don't delve into researching it too much, Carnegie's take on the Reuben is exaggerated, excessive, extra ordinary, over blown, and over executed, it's a masterpiece. Let it be a surprise. 

My gripe would be the turkey they serve here. It's above average, but it pales in comparison to the outstanding corned beef and pastram, which is as superior as any in the country. 

The diner style dishes are prepared fresh, things like Meat Loaf, fried chicken, open faced burgers are superb. 

Breakfast is excellent, and reminiscent of what you'd find at any great Manhattan deli.

I am a Pastrami lover, meat lover, and I thought the sandwich was great, simple, flavorful.  Rye bread, lots and lots of Pastrami, then I added on deli mustard.  My lunch also came with 2 pickles and an Iced tea for a total of $13.75.  That was such a great price!!!  You order at the register, they give you a #, go sit at any table, and your server will bring you your food/drink. I was very full and satisfied, my server was friendly, would love to come back again to Carnegie's deli :)   Had a great experience!

The place was busy!  Although the seating area was at max capacity, the service was still pretty good minus a few blunders [i.e.  The boyfriend getting coffee when he ordered a soda].  Blunders are forgivable; especially when the place is busy.

So the boyfriend ordered some kinda of burger with a huge plate of fries [I don't know why fries aren't complimentary on The Strip --- not American!] while I stuck with the Meat Loaf.  Portions are gigantic --- just like the hype!  Too bad everything tasted bland.

The thing that makes me give it 3-stars though is dirty utensils.  I don't care how busy it easy.  Dirty utensils at my table and all surrounding tables is NOT OKAY!",zFYs8gSUYDvXkb6O7YkRkw,4,3,3,fqwVI0oHXXgwcMZGCUKXGQ

Carnegie Deli should have stayed in New York.  Their sandwiches consist of two regular size pieces of rye bread, with what must be a pound of deli inside.  Large bamboo skewers hold everything together.  If that's not big enough, you can order the Woody Allen, which combines corned beef and roast beef for an even bigger sandwich.  You don't pick up the sandwich, you lift off the bread and use a fork.  Sounds good so far, but the corned beef was dry and not all that flavorful; same for the pastrami.  At breakfast, I tried the matzobrei, pancake style.  It was just an omelet with a little matzo thrown in - very disappointing.  Their menu doesn't even mention sour cream as an option - you have to ask for it.

I really wanted Carnegie Deli to be good, especially because I've stayed at The Mirage a couple of times.  I kept trying, and continued to be disappointed.  Potato latkes were large, greasy, and crispy on the outside, but the potato was the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Cheese blintzes were OK, but not good enough to order again.  The only bright spots: a hot dog that was huge and pretty good; a chocolate chip cookie that also was huge, and also was pretty good.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,1,XtonCm30criyXOSyJeqXsA

The fact that regardless of the place, regardless of the 14 oz of meant, $14.95 for a roast beef sandwich is BEYOND ridiculous.

And what does it come with? Meat and bread.

BUT WAIT! Thats not all!

For only $1.50 extra, you can get a slice of cheese.

And for $1 extra, you can have lettuce and tomato.

...wtf?

I LOVE roast beef sandwiches. Absolutely love them. I was not aware it was possible to make a bad roast beef sandwich.

This was definitely the WORST sandwich I have ever had, in any variety.

First of all, the roast beef did not taste like anything. It was bizarre. It tasted like water.

And the issue with Vegas is the concept of less is more is OUT THE WINDOW.

We had to completely de-construct the sandwich before we could even take a bite. There was nearly a pound of roast beef ROLLED into a huge roll and slapped on these squirrely pieces of bread. 

Not to mention there was a half a pound of iceberg lettuce and white onion. What DELI doesnt offer red onion??

It was such a disappointment. Especially since the bf had really wanted a pastrami sandwich, which is also never bad, which I vetoed because I had a queasy belly and wanted something with a little less flavor. NOT SOMETHING WITH NO FLAVOR.

It was just an absolute failure. Depression and a failure. ):",bnf7t21SCFw3HWfV_soG_Q,8,5,2,kX6ggmEMB5GkplR9vaYb-w

Just be careful what you order and make sure you're on the brink of starvation, the portions are insanely massive. You get heaping mounds of meat in your sandwiches, almost to point where it's laughable. I ordered the Reuben that was super delicious. The only annoying thing was that I had to take almost 3/4 of it to go because I was so stuffed from eating the 1/4. So I ended up having to lug around 3 lbs. of meat all over the strip in a doggy bag. We didn't have a microwave in our room either so after it went cold it wasn't that great the next day. It had become a coagulated pastrami and cheese brick. Pretty nasty, ended up just throwing it away. For a $24 sandwich that kinda sucked.",w-fkht6rk_MszTx6g9zqXg,0,0,4,myPjs_Y3TzOxHjFGOZ9hEQ

I have a couple tips/warnings: 

-The servings are huge. So either share or expect to bring food home. 
-There is only one size for french fries. So if you're eating alone, you might want to skip it because you'll be wasting a lot. 
-The place is cramp. 
-The prices are expensive. 

Weird side note - I always order iced coffee when I'm there. I usually like my coffee with cream and sugar, but the coffee plain here is super good. I can taste it right now. YUM!!! 

If you do make it to dessert, I would suggest the strawberry cheesecake. The texture is different from any other cheesecake I have tasted. It is rich in flavor. The strawberries compliment the cheesecake as opposed to being overbearing. 

If you don't mind being cramp and spending a little extra cash, then you got to try Carnegie. Try to stick to the meatier sandwiches, desserts, and iced coffee. Oh yeah, and maybe the Matzo Soup.

But after attending the awesome Yelp Night @ Terry Fator and seeing the Terry Fator Show, dining here seemed a great idea.  So Diane and I headed over, and I braced myself for Matzoh Ball Soup and a gigantic corned beef or pastrami sandwich.  To my surprise, by ordering a Woody Allen I could have both.  The name of the sandwich almost deterred me from ordering it, because I am definitely not a fan of Woody Allen.  But in the end I relented and ordered it along with a bowl of Chicken Broth with Matzoh Balls.  After I had devoured all four juicy complimentary pickles, and getting more, the soup arrived.  Two very large Matzoh Balls arrived in a large bowl along with chicken broth contained in a shiny silver metal container.  After I poured out the broth and filled the bowl, there was still broth left over.  So the portion was quite generous.  Diane ordered noodles to go with one Matzoh Ball, which I sampled, and they were thin and went well with the lightly seasoned chicken broth and really good, light and fluffy Matzoh Balls.  We also shared an order of French Fries, which arrived quite hot and filled an entire platter.

But the piece de resistance was my sandwich.  It is actually larger than the standard sandwiches on the menu, which already are enormous, and cost just under $20.00.  It was g-normous (whatever is larger than enormous), and after taking one look at it, I knew I would be taking a full half of the sandwich home.  And that is exactly what occurred.  It is definitely one of the best sandwiches I have consumed: half corned beef intermixed with pastrami, all moist and warm, likely hefting at least 1 lb. of meat per half, on supple Jewish Rye (see pics).  And, it was just excellent!  After removing the toothpicks holding everything together, I managed to eat some bites normal sandwich style before resorting to knife and fork.  And, I really had to push myself to finish a complete half.  But at length I did.

Service was very good and efficient.  I quickly received Heinz mild yellow mustard and additional pickles on request.  The place was comfortable with a deli feel to it.  And, I polished off the second half of that sandwich split into lunch and dinner the next day.  But even before that I tipped my home scale 4-3/4 pounds heavier than the day before.  Believe me, the appetizers from Stack at Revolution before the Terry Fator Show did not cause that gain.  Half of a Woody Allen did!

I will eat at Carnegie more often, but to keep my weight under some reasonable control I think I will only order the Woody Allen again on at best an annual basis.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,11,9,5,sRO93DZ52HX-V48aN238yQ

The tables are pretty small and I was rubbin elbows with the folks next to me but I was hungry so it wasn't a big deal. 

I ordered the Woody Allen sandwich and If I remember correctly it has 1 pound of pastrami and 1 pound of corned beef. 

Got a few pickles and some fries on the side, that was good as well.

With a quarter of the sandwich left I stood defeated and with that much greasy meat I can assure you I was not feeling so great afterwards. 

My suggestion if you want to get your moneys worth here is to order the woody allen, eat till your full, get a togo bag with the rest of the meat then buy a loaf of rye bread and some mustard. You'll have enough meat left to make 5-10 sandwiches.

Pros:
Massive portions (how do NY people eat this much?!)
Open till 2am
Friendly service
You don't have to fly to New York and wait in that insane line at the real location.


Cons:
Prices are stiff. 
They charge you extra for wanting to share one of the mammoth thing they call sandwiches


Like any other true fattie we ordered the Woody Allen which was 2lbs of pastrami and corned beef on 2 tiny slices of bread. I'm not insane and I do appreciate arterial function so me and the woman split this bad boy. Be warned if you are looking for taste, this is not the place for you. The meat was dry and flavorless and had to be drowned in deli mustard in order to be palatable. I have been to NY and have had my mind blown by a pastrami tower at Broadway Deli so I know that this isn't how NY sandwiches are supposed to be like. All in and all, we plugged away at it and doing so killed the entire bottle of deli mustard. 

We can proclaim that we came and conquered ""The Woody.""

I barely ate a quarter of it so I had to box the rest. I was laughing until I got my check and it costed around $40. I looked at the menu and saw that they had regular sized Reubens and was completely shocked as to why they didn't give me that one. Did I say Super size me!? All I tasted was meat and cheese. The bread was completely hidden under all that ridiculousness.

By far the funniest experience I've had at a restaurant. They should really specify what size sandwich you want before ripping you off.",o65m3ddoFQHX6fkpnWfxPQ,14,4,2,7EnuUiFbF0h5F-NoSzRucw

Costumer service was terrible! There was a tall old guy who made us move tables and he was very rude about it, and on top of that they gave us the wrong order. We ordered a cheese burger and we got a giant pastrami sandwich instead that was just plain nasty. NEVER GO HERE THEY SUCK !!!!!!!!",CLAG5k4kWD0eZdzZz4hrAw,0,0,1,pqaQP2CG_3Ydn1kuS5M7-w
5939149,2012-01-10,2,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"When I 1st came here, I couldn't believe how gigantic the sandwiches were. The ""Reuben Sandwich"" and the ""Woody Allen"" were so big that there was no way you could finish it in one sitting. Eating the Reuben at Carnegie was like a 12 round boxing match; you needed stamina, endurance, and the will the go on. Times have changed. 

Today, I finally got to meet one of my Dad's old military friends. They became friends in the early 1970s, but lost contact after they were discharged from the marine corp. The old man mentioned to me that he grew up in New York and that he is Jewish. I immediately told him about ""Carnegie"" and he was elated at the idea of eating one of those gigantic sandwiches. I googled the ""Carnegie Reuben"" and ""Woody Allen"" to show him the pictures and next thing I know he had sent me to the Mirage to buy him some good Kosher Deli. I really wanted to please the old man because my Dad had been telling me stories about him since I was a kid...but, unfortunately Carnegie didn't live up the hype. 
It appears that Carnegie is cutting corners now. The Sandwich was only about 1/2 the size of what it used to be. Back in the old days, you weren't able to fit the sandwich in your mouth due to it's practical-joke oversized gimmick. We both finished our sandwiches in less than 5 minutes. He looked at me like I was some kind of idiot and told me: "" you don't know what real kosher deli  is"". It was a drag letting the old man down.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,1,2,1,m82HicAVULgEUp0MhXDMwQ

Having had Katz's in Manhattan, I'd say that their pastrami on rye is still the winner. But, when in Vegas, Carnegie is a pretty decent substitute. 

Complimentary pickles (3 large, mostly dill and butter) were a nice touch. So was the iced coffee with free refills: almost a good deal when on the Strip; ""only"" $3.50 for an approximately 20 oz glass. Table also has squeeze bottle horseradish sauce.

Open 24 hours; slow service. Probably the best perk of them all. If you want to save room for dessert (which is suggested if you like huge cheesecakes and black and white cookies!!), split your sandwich for $3 extra. To go bags were good enough for the plane. 

Other noteworthy interesting menu items: lettuce and tomato sandwich; breakfast items; bagels and fruit cups for lighter appetites; grilled cheese for vegetarians (but no veggie sandwich); pretty much, the usual large assortment of items on a typical New York deli menu.",7Xpb51viDdOaV_89olxp5w,0,0,4,gMmhWqel_I9a6GznSK0BXQ
5954315,2015-04-16,1,zU9w_xRlQSRIYXxGo-HSOA,"It really makes me sad to write a bad review for this place, but I really feel that the remodel ruined the experience. The first time my husband and I came to Vegas, this was where we went and I've never forgotten it. He food was delicious and worth the seemingly exorbitant price, and it was warm and friendly. A traditional sit down restaurant. 

Now, it might as well have been turned into a fast food establishment and it has lost all of the charm that made it so desirable. I'm not going to stand in line and order and $18 sandwich at the counter, without being warmly greeted or treated like much of a person at all. The servers seem to have been forced to take on more than their fair share, and as much as our server was still really sweet, it seems like they have been run completely ragged. I'm sure their tips have been severely affected by the change, and that upsets me even more. You can really tell a lot by how management treats their employees. Forcing them to take on such a significant amount of work has caused a slow and decline in service.

If they ever decide to change back to a traditional restaurant, I'll be back. Otherwise, one of my favorite Vegas experiences has been ruined (I have my suspicions about mirage adding a new restaurant ""the pantry"" and wanting to make it seem more appealing) and I will not return. I'll likely never recommend this place,  either. There are too many great restaurants in Vegas to be treated like zombie cattle running through a line.

We had lunch here one day and they were receptive to my off menu order of a combo pastrami and turkey sandwich.  It was crazy big, to the point that our table neighbors ooohd and aaahd as it landed.  I ate almost half of it and wound up getting the other half to go and giving it to a homeless man on the street.  My son got a bacon and egg bagel sandwich which was equally ginormous and he did a nice job eating most of the thing.

We also had breakfast on our last day in town and again, it was pricey, with huge portions and tasty.  If I was only rating breakfast, I would have given this review 4 stars I think.

There is a $3 fee if you decide to share your sandwich (lame) and for some odd reason, the wait time during lunch is always really long.

The problem I have with this place is that the portions are HUGE. They are meant for giants from Harry Potter. I think Hagrid would go to town on this shit. When i'm in Vegas, the liquid diet commences and I can't eat much. When i say liquid diet, i mean i'm drinking a lot of booze. I dont' mean i'm starving myself to shrivel up like a supermodel. C'mon now, I love food!
Anyway the portions are HUGE. Even if you try to order a regular sandwich like I did, the amount of meat they give you in the sandwich is at least 4 inches thick. I honestly cannot eat THAT much pastrami. 
People who order the triple deckers are nuts. Has the guy from Man VS Food come here yet!?!? It's disgusting.
Anyway.. the quality of the pastrami itself is sufficient. I ate about half the meat in my sandwich but I found myself dipping it into a lot of ketchup and deli mustard.
I came back for breakfast because this was the only place close that wasn't a buffet. I had the 3 eggs [scrambled]w/ bacon from the breakfast menu. I think the eggs they were steroided out eggs or something because it DID NOT look like 3 eggs. It eggs took up more than half my plate and looked like at least 6 eggs. INSANE.
