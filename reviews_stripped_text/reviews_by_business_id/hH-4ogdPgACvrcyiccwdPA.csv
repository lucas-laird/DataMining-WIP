The sole reason I came in was to quench my thirst with their Lemonade Mixers but holy guacamole, I saw the swirling Frozen Lemonade Mixers and found myself with the Strawberry one and the Blue Raspberry one. They were both super refreshing and not overly sweet. Prices were ehhh, but they sure as hell saved me from the scorching Vegas heat. :)",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,2,2,3,KTsmuxVz4mdjThDk3BQ0NA

We got there and we ordered, requesting to have our pretzels fresh out the oven. The employees looked tired and serious. The lady said our pretzels were fresh but they just grabbed it out of the display saying it was out of the oven. It definitely was not out of the oven. It's annoying she just said that to satisfy my wishes because there was a line of customers waiting to be served. False reassurance is a crime to customers, businesses and employees alike should realize that! The Auntie Anne's pretzels are fresh at Red Rock casino and Meadows mall. Would not buy here again.",qv_bHH2bJ2hNxniS6bxJmQ,0,0,1,Xe4JaWnEz4OxAflk6YMaRQ

2241237,2013-09-23,0,hH-4ogdPgACvrcyiccwdPA,"For some reason the pretzels here are not as good as the ones at other malls I've been to. Also since this location is in a busy outlet mall, there is always a line and sometimes the line is out the door. They have a pretzel stand location near parking garage B that has limited options but does not have a line. I would recommend going there if you just want a pretzel or lemonade and don't require a full menu of items",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,3,i55b8u5QzVlubeAHM3DksQ

A pretzel and a pretzel dog later, my stomach wished I had just went else where. I guess it's not for everyone - and that everyone is me.

This location is super scummy. Even though I am an avid fan of Auntie Anne's, this location turns me off. One of the female employees has major attitude; I mean talk about very rude and unprofessional. 

You don't want your food handled here, trust me. We ordered the garlic pretzel like we always do and for some reason this location did away with the sweet mustard which was my favorite. Hard feelings aside, I immediately had stomach pain and food poisoning. It wasn't fun. I have never have a bad experience at Auntie Anne's, we love them. But this location is the worst.   

Now, when we want a snack after outlet shopping we hit up DQ since we know their pretzels are basic but won't ruin us.

Let this be your PRO TIP.

Not a happy customer. Then they start arguing and getting defensive. If I could not give a star I would. They need to fix this.

2783528,2014-09-14,7,hH-4ogdPgACvrcyiccwdPA,"Don't judge me, but I love carbs!! Especially when they come in the form of warm, soft delicious pretzels!! I work literally 20 seconds away from this location so it's hard not to come here everyday. You can smell the goodness baking from outside and since they are always busy, you know that your pretzel is going to be fresh. 

The factors that are making this review a 3 star instead of a 4 or 5? I'm not ok with paying $3 for a piece of bread pretty much. That's more than an entire loaf of bread at the grocery store. Another thing, the wait times are ridiculous. You can be in line for over 10 minutes since there are always so many people. The employees are super unprofessional and not so nice. 

But whatever. I love carbs and despite all the negatives, my fat butt will be back to fulfill my cravings.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,3,3,bAiaxbyy0BxR2mJ3VDIQPA

We waiting patiently as we watched the 2 staff personnel roll dough. It was apparent no one was at the register to take our orders. The line grew to six people and not an ounce of acknowledgement by staff. Two of the 6 customers left after realizing no one was being served. A courtesy, ""someone will be with you wouldn't hurt. It actually would have kept a negative review from being posted.

The place was pretty crowded when I arrived but I didn't had to wait too long make my order. 
But then i had to wait nearly 15 minutes for my pretzel nuggets with cinnamon sugar... not the best thing when you're craving for some pretzels! 
Finally I got what I ordered and it was basically OK, nothing special or anything, a bit less yummy than my last time in NY.",sJt7xHhgWBuQ7LJYserqiA,0,0,3,xBFzv_aChthaqCphPGnuwA

I am a big fan of soft (and hard, for that matter) pretzels- great snacks unless they have too much butter. I just don't like salt too much. Pretzels can be a healthy alternative to other mall choices provided it's not soaked in salt and butter. The other pretzel companies try to outdo Auntie Anne's but I really don't think that they can. Jeez, craving one as I am typing up my review.

Hard to believe another 1st to Review!!?!!

Great pretzels, Cheap,filling and flavorful snack for on the go at any mall.

Don't forget to get a lemonade too.

I like them all but I tried the Sour Cream & Onion this time since I had a FREE coupon I won on Twitter.

Great Stuff but I still like the Pepperoni Pizza Pretzel & the Pretzel Dog.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,4,4,4,r-QcNUP8V8bJl_OfO4gLzQ
4974402,2010-08-21,2,hH-4ogdPgACvrcyiccwdPA,"Walking through the mall, sometimes you want one of those soft pretzels with dipping sauces they are serving up.

On this particular occasion, we ordered the sour cream and onion pretzel with the nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, a garlic pretzel with nacho cheese and salsa dipping sauce, and a pretzel dog.

I can't remember much else because within 15 minutes of finishing, I was in search of the ladies' room.  Stomach cramps, chills, and the sweats...ran to the toilet and out it went.  Bad cheese, perhaps?

(I do still visit other pretzel locations when I'm at the mall, this so happens to be the only time I visited this Auntie Anne's location.)",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,3,3,1,RbEfku-y5QrUJC0NjtKHzw

The cinnamon sugar pretzel nuggets come in a tall cup, so you get a good amount of nuggets. They coat the nuggets in tons of cinnamon sugar though, that the last bits of pretzel nuggets are absolutely caked in sugar! This can either be a pro or con, depending on how much sugar you like on your pretzels.",zckLu2_HoG2UmmQzC52AZw,0,0,2,TyzlYDFzpQIpay2sIS2O1A
