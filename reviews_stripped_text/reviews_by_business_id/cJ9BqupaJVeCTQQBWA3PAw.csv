They told me it's going to be a 10-15 min wait which I didn't mind, but I ended up waiting for at least 40 min. Not only that but once I got home and opened the box they gave me the wrong order. I asked for a regular deep deep dish pizza that has stuffed crusts and I got a regular pepperoni deep dish with no stuffed crust and the worker there didn't even give me my receipt. 
Worst place I've ever been to.",WyJRhi8kp0X6pTKG9GlEQQ,1,0,1,g6RPZazt9Q0s2SfWqRGSqQ

The cashier was talking and texting while being on the register and took her sweet time to help the other cashier that was actually doing her job! I placed my order over the phone when I walked in there were 3 people in line including myself it took me literally 20 min to walk out the store and not to mention my order was ready!

1357549,2018-03-26,0,cJ9BqupaJVeCTQQBWA3PAw,"Strangely I actually enjoy this pizza cuz it's cheap, fast, and tastes pretty good. I stopped at this one cuz it's on the way home from work and ordered a 3 meat treat pizza. They do No justice with this cuz there's no exactly a lot of the 3 meats on it but it does the job for me. She told me upfront the wait will be about 12 minutes so I hung out a little bit. 

Service was okay but like all the others it's small in the lobby and plenty of people wanting fast hot pizza. My pizza was fresh, hot, and perfect just like I like it. Couldn't wait to get home to devour 2 or 3 slices and it didn't disappoint. And of course I have some left over for lunch. 

Nothing major here, no frills, just my input since I've never been to this location. If I feel the need I probably will be back again.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,0,3,uHt9H1IEFJYljzXiksOJUQ

That could not have been further from the truth. I used the app to order 2 pizzas.  It said that my pizzas would be ready in about 20 minutes.  I showed up at the store at the estimated time.  10 minutes after the time I was given, I needed to ask for a manager to get my order fulfilled.  Still a better option to go to the location located at Nellis and Lake Mead or anywhere else actually.

There was a line out the door and when I overheard the cashier tell the customer ahead of me that there was a 40 MINUTE wait for a hot n ready pizza, I left so quick. That defeats the whole concept of Little Caesar's hot n ready pizzas. I was very annoyed and will not be returning.",PHlwCy9IdiijWKNyAshsiQ,0,0,1,G_b-A7bIMoZTm3PDB2xgYQ
2023398,2014-10-16,1,cJ9BqupaJVeCTQQBWA3PAw,"Horrible, Ive had problems in the past with them treating me badly but always over looked it as maybe an off day for them. But today they told me pick up my order via phone in 20 minute which I was fine with only to arrive there for pick up and have them tell me I have to still wait... 40 minutes passed since I placed the order over the phone, I waited outside in my car since the place was packed full of angry customers already waiting on their delayed  food, I walk back in and I'm told I have to wait yet again. I then asked to speak with the manager who then blamed me for the delay, telling me I left so it's my fault it took so long. I was calm but after that I was deeply upset.Now I'm not a genius but whether I arrived early or late who's to blame for when food is done on time or not? The business or customer.
As I left I asked for cookies for the kids and red pepper flakes and the managers response to me was this, verbatim ""we're busy here ok? We don't have any so goodbye goodnight""
I've been going to this little ceasars my entire life (20+ years) and they just lost me PERMANENTLY",d-r2DiqbY3cR-GI2F13vAw,2,1,1,SbCyDPN03ItIumra90FdTA
2220740,2017-07-02,0,cJ9BqupaJVeCTQQBWA3PAw,"Horrible horrible horrible, this place normally takes calls before it is open. This time around I called the day before to place a call for 10 pizzas so they'd be ready by the time I get there. No answer, and it is 8pm at this time. The next morning the day I need them for, I call before the business is open several times and nothing. I get there, order my pizzas and they give me this frustrated look because it's so many, and they don't have change for $100. I get a nasty attitude on the matter that I need them now. I was willing to wait because I obviously didn't call ahead, but the attitude was not necessary.",QWkfm-5B9lCY-gRQHfiPEA,0,0,1,Y_zW1Arjacj3O9JoDeTZTQ

I came around dinner time, which I know is usually the most difficult time to actually get food at Little Caesar's. The wait time for two pepperoni pizzas was FORTY MINUTES. Like, are you kidding??? The place was packed and there was no food readily available!! You know dinner is your most busy time, why not be prepared? I just couldn't get over the wait time and the waiting area of the restaurant is too hot to wait in. A couple other people and I left. I can't say I'll never be back here again, because it is in a convenient location. But I really don't like this place much anymore.",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,0,0,2,w5t2ZJeSPSl2AiweTMVawA

The cooks are just walking around and screaming at each other. No organization what so ever!!! And I have to tell them not to give my pizza out because they can't read the receipts!!!

Yeah highly unacceptable and it's not like they are giving them for free and like the quality is the best. Seriously has to be the worst little caesers there is in town and the slowest. Highly under staffed. I should have gone across the street to pizza hut i probably would have paid the same about and waited alot less for better quality pizza.
