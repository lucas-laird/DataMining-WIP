I mentioned that I ordered chicken and it didn't seem like anything was going to be done about it, and I was in a hurry so I left. Bad mistake.  I don't think I had any beef in my container, it all tasted like whatever they coat it with.

They use fresh and dried peppers in their entree's, which is a great touch, especially when they charge usually around $10 or less for their entree's.  They have boba and an extensive menu.  The staff is usually pretty accomodating even when we roll deep and have 15 of us show up minutes before closing time (we didn't realize it, we wouldn't be THAT mean).  They are very fast and the food is always fresh!  My favorites on the menu are the Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Salt and Pepper Shrimp.

The kung pao chicken is really tasty.  And I agree with the other reviewer that the Mongolian Beef has a lot of veggies, which is kinda weird, but it was still quite good to me.  There's so much of it, you could easily pick around the vegetables and still have plenty to eat.  And it's very spicy!

At first the food was great, I would call up and it would be a big order and they would tell me 30-45 minutes which is pretty standard. After some time though my orders wouldn't change the time it would take to come pick up my food became less and less. Down from 30-45 minutes to 10 minutes. The food quality went down and it didn't taste fresh anymore, I even thought that the flavors and quality were so poor I would compare it to microwaved Chinese food. The last time we went there was probably about a month before the news came out about their sanitary conditions. We ordered some Hong Kong style noodles, chicken wings, and hunan beef. It was all delivered fairly quickly, but it was disgusting. We didn't even bother finishng our food, not even one dish was half eaten. The hunan is supposed to be crunchy (which we get delivery often and it is at least slighty crunchy), but this time it was soggy and greasy. The noodles were greasy and the sauce was sub par. Now the nasty... My girlfriend got the chicken wings they were dry, old tasting, and multiple pieces of the chicken had holes. Now when I say holes I don't mean maybe they poked a hole to inject flavor or the skin got burned off, more so it looked like the skin rotted or it was a mistreated low quality chicken. It was just so unappetizing that was the last time we ever ate there. I do not recommend this place. I've gone in before and a server was eating her lunch at a table from a food pan. One word to describe this place prior to be exposed is unsanitary. I haven't returned after they got a good grade, because my experience with them was disgusting.

Especially when I went to place my order the woman who was attending to me was staring at her phone watching movies. Rating out of 1-10 for customer service would be a 1. Reading out of 1-10 for food quality would be a 7. It's not the happiest place to go I would only recommend this place if you are ordering take out not the cleanest either.

The call was handled efficiently with them taking all the necessary information, our order and giving me the total in no time. We got 2 entrees [mongolian beef & chicken lettuce wraps] a spam musubi, a thai iced tea and a boba. It came out to $27 and they gave us 2 free egg rolls since we were new customers, which was a nice touch! 

The order arrived in roughly a half hour. The man came straight to our door and was very polite. 

The lettuce was fresh and crunchy with the perfect bowl shape for making the wraps. The chicken mixture was really salty with a lot of crunch from the water chestnuts. I would've liked it a little less salty. 

The mongolian beef had a lot of vegetables in it, which was nice to see. I'm not sure how authentic it was, but the boy didn't particularly enjoy it. I thought it had a lot of grease...

The musubi was tasty, though! For 1.95 it was a big hunk of soft, crumbly on the inside & firm on the outside spam with a firmly compressed rectangle of sticky rice slathered with a layer of brown sauce and wrapped with nori. I can see getting it to go on my way to a night shift at work, though I would need something light and refreshing to counter balance it. 

The thai iced tea was tasty, but not my favorite. It had a slightly grainy texture to it. My boba was good, with the tapioca at a good al dente texture. I thought I ordered lychee but it arrived as a thai tea. It was a good sized portion.

All  in all, it was a decent meal and the prices are better than some of their competitors. I'm not totally infatuated with them, but I'm willing to try them again sometime.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,3,g2i8gLjzrZVV0ZXPK_rasQ

I have ordered twice from this establishment (through Grubhub) - and both times the various orders arrived late and soggy. I ordered the assorted appetizers - they arrived in a styrofoam container (the norm) but there there were no holes punched to release steam and preserve the crispness of the fried items.

The order arrived late - beyond one hour from a place less than 2 miles away - with no apologies.

The BBQ pork appetizer had almost no sauce - pretty much just dried pork with a scant bit of flavor.

I also ordered the Wor Wonton Soup - unfortunately, they packaged it in such a precarious way that the container dropped, split and spilled on the way to my kitchen. I had to make an additional cup of chicken stock to reconstitute into a soup - not to mention the inconvenience of cleanup.

Again - the lateness of delivery ensured the coldness of my apps - the crab rangoon tasted of oil, rather than crab.The egg rolls were rubbery and soggy, the fried shrimp were less than crunchy and the foil-wrapped chicken tasted of spice for pumpkin pie.

Sesame beef was very dry - almost jerky-like - with no sauce to support the steamed rice.

I always try beef broccoli at a Chinese place because it has everything. I can judge how well they cook meat as well as their veggie skills. Golden China cooks their meat a little on the well done side, which detracts from
What should be tender beef slices. They are also heavy handed with the corn starch. However, the veggies are always crisp and tasty.

We wanted to have the food delivered so I gave them a call....the order process was very easy...my order was easily understood, repeated back to me as well as my address and after giving the girl my debit card #, concluded quickly.  She quoted my price and said the food would be arriving in about 45 minutes from the time of our call...Well, 20 minutes later and there he was.  Excellent delivery time in my opinion...

We ordered 2 lunch specials, orange chicken and the cashew chicken both for $5.55 and an order of my egg foo young (veggie) for $7;95.  The lunch specials were packed with food....I only tried a few bites of the cashew chicken but I must say that the chicken itself was very tasty...my only problem with that dish was the cashews themselves...they seemed ""stale""....

The rice and chow mein was plentiful...maybe a little bit more than you'd get at Panda Express.  I did not try the Orange Chicken, but my brother in law said it was ""ok"" but he liked Panda better.

The coveted Egg Foo Young was good but extremely ""thick"" which dropped down my rating from 4 stars to 3....The portions were huge, the taste was good but the thickness of the pattie was just too much.  Gravy that accompanied was put on the side, not on the pattie itself and that was appreciated.  I like being able to put on the amount I want..not the amount the restaurant thinks I should have.  I have to say, it was quite good. 

Will we order from them again?  I don't know quite frankly.  We have a Panda right across the street that has better Orange Chicken and gives the same portions of rice/noodles...but they don't serve the Egg Foo Young...so it's a toss up.....but if you want a lot of food for your money and want ""decent"" Chinese food, this is a good place to go.",3aoRGjx2Wl0y5U9cVi4msA,0,0,3,AP22l710fO4e8AaSryyMzQ

My absolute favorite thing to get is their chicken moo goo with extra chicken and mushrooms!! I've also tried the Mongolian beef, the egg drop soup, the egg rolls, their slushies, the chow mein and fried rice, the orange chicken, and the beef and broccoli. They're meat is always so tender and juicy, the vegetables are always fresh, and their slushies are delicious!! 
They're really good with custom made orders and their delivery service is REALLY fast when you use Grub Hub.
I recommend everyone try this place at least once.

Having said that, my meal at Golden China was pretty tasty. And, in comparison to some of the awful stuff that tries to pass as Chinese food in this city, its a nice change. I ordered the lunch special with the ""House Special Chicken"", which is an interpretation of General Tso's Chicken. The portion was generous and included both fried rice and chow mein. If you're dining in, which I did, it also includes the soup of the day.

The chicken was unique, utilizing pineapple for sweetness, there was also strong garlic and a spicy kick. Very saucy, so I was surprised that the breading on the chicken managed to stay very crunchy. Different take on the recipe. Almost felt like a cross between general's and sweet and sour, but I am a fan. The rice was delicious. The chow mein and soup were the weakest part if the meal, though both were still enjoyable.

The real hook here is the price. For some tasty lunch, I spent $5.95+tax, and that included soda. Pretty incredible if you ask me, especially considering I ended up with leftovers as I was too full to finish. Well done, Golden China.",DuTNotPWhYWb5Dpt-UAmlA,1,0,4,jVcCQEnPg1kUm684WsnJxA

I'm on my lunch break right now and decided to try this place out since they sent my office a flyer. Funnily enough, I considered in my head to order orange chicken, but firmly decided not to because I always get that at other places. And I wanted something spicier. So I ordered a Mongolian Beef. 

My food arrives, I open the box, I take a bite. It tastes great. However, what was served to me wasn't what I ordered. They gave me an orange chicken. So i speak to the cashier that they gave me the wrong food, and that it's okay, but it's wrong. He proceeds to say, ""no you told me orange chicken."" So then I say, ""no, I ordered Mongolian beef."" And he returns with, ""no it was an orange chicken sorry."" So I'm getting frustrated here because yes I said it was fine they made a mistake, but he won't even acknowledge a mistake was made. So we go back and forth a few times with me insisting I ordered a Mongolian beef, which I am 100% SURE I stated in my order. And he just finished with, ""no you told me L-9, sorry."" And walks back to the kitchen. I FOR SURE DID NOT SAY L-9 OR ORANGE CHICKEN. 

Like I said, the food is still good. I even considered ordering this dish. But the fact is that I did not order this, and he refused to acknowledge and therefore would not take any measures to correct his mistake. I know what I ordered because I know what I was planning on eating. 

Next time if a customer points out a mistake, especially I was quite nice about it until he started telling me I was wrong, LISTEN to the customer. I wasn't asking for a refund, or for them to even make me something new. I just felt it was appropriate to let them know a mistake had been made.

Again, I don't think we'll be back.",JET5zoXBcENIJgwkCpWF1g,0,0,2,16ZCSUGTFqMxewO-HenQ8w

Great neighborhood place when you don't feel like driving too far, DEFINITELY.

I live just around the corner from Golden China.  (Which yes, means I live just around the corner from Beijing Noodle which I don't like as much)  This is my go to Chinese place.  

Pros:  Portions are good, always have leftovers.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is fast.  Their dishes actually have meat in them, not just filler.  They have some menu items that aren't found everywhere else.  

Cons:  They do sometimes get the orders wrong, so I always check before I leave the restaurant.  Delivery takes a LONG time, even though I live less than a mile away.  Absolutely no ambiance, so don't plan to eat here...

Definitely order:
NY Style Egg Rolls
Corn Egg Flower Soup
Wor Wonton Soup (packed with veggies, meat and wontons)
Chinese Eggplant with Tofu
Sesame Beef
HK Style Crispy Noodle 
Taiwanese Mei Fun

Their lunch and dinner specials are great and they normally allow substitutions.

Don't order their Pot Stickers (very thick ""skin""), Chow Mein Noodles (very thick and chewy), Pad Thai (overly sweet), and some of their beef dishes have a weird texture...",sdiGHP8vk3QuMTYaVsmanw,0,0,4,GlTENESXZ-Mf7Jw8GuUu4w

Male Asian server brought our the wrong dish and said it was what I ordered?
The soup was nasty tasting and served cold 
The main dish was not edible...
When I told the server how bad the food was...he couldnt give a damm...I asked the server if there was a new owner because Ive been coming to this location for years...he said no?

I like the random crunch of green onion and other veggies in the chow mein I've had from them in the past but I got mostly noodles and chicken in this. This has great flavor however the missing veggies is a major disappointment. 

Get the dinners there for sure. Skip the party tray of chicken chow mein.",uv9VIYijUSjQHgVvC5wj4w,0,0,3,kaTzWz3oCtiJ_u2HbbRX_Q
5870934,2016-09-29,0,iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A,"Had this place for the first time the other day. Seemed like a decent little place to try something different/ local. Small place, decent atmosphere, average for noise, pretty laid back. 

I ordered the lunch special $5.95 Hot Garlic with chow mein noodles. I was served a giant portion of food. A well balanced dish of chicken p, vegetables, and noodles. Noodles were really good, as well as the flavor with the chicken. Hot garlic sauce was good, about mild to medium in spice.  Came with a cup of egg drop soup, about average in taste, and a drink. 

I would recommend this place to friends. Cheap and giant portions. Great flavor, satisfying outing.

The noodles were tasteless, the pork horrible and the orange chicken overcooked and not very appetizing.  The pictures on the wall looked good, if only I could have eaten the pictures.

On the positive side I will say that  the place was clean, the service very good, prices reasonable, and the pluses stop there.  What does it say when a chain like Pei Wei offers a better meal?  Won't be back and suggest you skip it.",c2ycyOWS2kXqJepFQeQHYw,0,0,2,7L1jDxX0AngogWZUhbicRw

This is Chinese take-out, and to expect some outstanding service is just foolish. They have a fairly priced chicken teriyaki bowl. Other items on the menu are decent, but you cannot go wrong with their teriyaki bowls.",J6TQLLy9W5GuA0HJXGLgMA,2,2,4,ih-Ni4gt4crxYFi82uO2lQ
