Now they only have vanilla and chocolate.  
(No starwberry ?!?!) And a few different toppings to add in. You also order at the counter now which is fine and I'm assuming it's to make things easier for the employee but come on why change the one thing that made you different from other people(the menu) 
My shake was served in a plastic cup instead of the diner feel glass.
I loved this place because it felt like a real diner now not so much.
I don't know if I'll keep coming here now.",Bpj4JTIMoz4YsNTm3aBxig,4,0,2,Uh3gEHGWUsw4X3Fsic1Y_A

She even kept checking on our table to make sure everything was ok. The burgers are pretty good but the side portions are way too small for a combo; almost half what you would get anywhere else. Bread is not the best but the meat tasted fresh and tasty. If you order and finish you get the traditional picture on their wall. Prices are very reasonable especially with the ""build your own burger"" option.  Fries should definitely be a bigger side for the deserved 4th star...",N6PAVmnVS24YDjvZgaXkmQ,1,0,3,Bhxwktq4SwSims3oGhqqpA

We walk in to the restaurant and no one even help us there was this older short lady in the front counter and we were just ignore after standing there for at least 4 minute she actually said hello and asked us oh i didn't know u were there, her attitude just straight sucked ass and she was rude almost gave me that feeling like she was racists tours us because of how she was treating us. it was going to be my first time there and we didn't even end up eating, we left because thanks to this stupid  lady ruined our  experience to try this restaurant for the first time.",JinJvdthv3GgZQoiYx0AZQ,1,0,1,h8KoMKmwXrhrUVLNXDNy0g
2704204,2017-03-10,9,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"Alright you guys buckle your seatbelts because I'm about to give you all the information you need to know about this place. So I'm at work thinking ""hmmm I'm American I don't wanna drive and get food for later when I'm working...let me UberEATS."" So I'm scrolling through to see places that can deliver me food and this place was an option. Never heard of it in my life; and neither have my coworkers. The pictures looked good so I was like ""alright let's see what's poppin"". So I place an order for a double cheeseburger with bacon, some fries, and an Oreo cheesecake shake. So I'm ready man I'm here at work about to get me some bomb a** burger and a shake like a true fat American. Homegirl from UberEATS comes with my food and I'm like ""gurrrrl"" and she's like ""gurrrrrl are you tracey?"" And I was like ""yeaaa gurrrrrl"". 

So i open my food and see that i got like 13 1/2 French fries...I got the regular fries, but they were seasoned with some weird a** kind of seasoning like they had a kick of spice to them (not to be a stereotypical white person who thinks like orange juice and sh*t is spicy). But they were pretty good. They're portioned like a mcdonalds kids meal frie, by to be honest, I didn't really mind I was more in the mood for a burger. So I open the burger and it's pretty decent sized. They're small, but the patties are a little bit thick so it has a taller size as opposed to like a wider burger that most places have. The burger meat was a little suspicious to me...and the bacon honestly tasted like cheap great value pork. It was disgusting. I had to take it off and I'm a HUGE bacon fan. But let's get to the point of this review man and how this place ruined my life. About an hour and a half later, my a** is a fartbox. My bootyhole was releasing literally enough fart powder to pollute the air of a small country. So I look at the time and I'm off work in 2 hours. I look into a mirror and pep talk myself to not be weak. I can wait till I get home to go potty...ten minutes later my guts twisting and making me feel sick. I need to sh*t. So I call up the front and tell the people I work with that I need to be relieved to go potty. So about 10 minutes later I get relieved and bisssshhhh lemme tell u call me sonic the hedgehog running to that bathroom fam. So I get to the bathroom and my booty become shy and doesn't wanna go. Mannn I might as well just end my life there. I just got sick belly cramps from this place man and they not even gonna let me release and be free...my belly still hurting and I haven't left work yet, I'm off in 20 more mins...pray for my poor booty and poor stomach man and I'll pray for yours if you decide to eat here.

Ps, 
They fu**ed up on my shake and just gave me Oreo instead of Oreo cheesecake smh",r0o1eLndCWujUDvaZZrncw,2,1,2,F8Vcdi-MSftx5WHp46ZF6w

2899593,2017-03-04,0,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"This place has gone seriously down hill. What a disappointment!! The new menu and policy of this establishment is less than satisfactory. Don't expect much customer service, they won't even let you PAY for substitutions. I just got about 10 fries with my meal.

3235221,2017-03-29,0,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"One of the worse dining experiences I have ever had. The burger was too small for the bun. The bum was burned on the inside and raw on the outside. I asked for A1, but whatever sauce they used was not A1. The fries came heavily peppered which meant my two toddlers could not eat them. It was so bad I could not eat my burger and ended up eating my kid's grilled cheese. Please don't waste your money. Stay away.",BOn7uQEE3pwketVTi3Uk7w,0,0,1,NOAqPUCPG9e1wpNNhPFZAQ
3255640,2018-05-09,0,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"I'm kind of sad, but not surprised, to see this place has closed. For years, this was our family destination for all celebrations, birthdays, and the place to take family coming in from out of town. This was THE spot. We loved it. Then they suddenly moved to the smaller location. At first, it was still okay. But then they went to express--requiring we order at the counter. The options and quality went down too. It wasn't the same anymore and we stopped going.

My daughter is getting ready to graduate high school. I asked her where she wanted to go eat and she said she wished we could go to Cheeburger Cheeburger--the way it used to be. All the kids started talking about how they missed our celebration dinners at Cheeburger. It's sad they had to run it into the ground.",abwO4VF4JcVYQ7CURAwsyw,2,0,2,PQbSQ_cHCAizZRrN0aUPqA

3636272,2017-05-11,0,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"This place, for the lack of words, totally sucks now. I loved coming here for the shakes, but everything is cut in half now. The employees seem like they hate being there, so in return we received crap service. We walked in wanting a shake, we couldn't see the menu too well so the lady at the front pointed down which was nice and showed us where the shakes were listed. We looked for a bit, and decided we wanted the chocolate banana shake. She looks at us with such a straight face and says ""we don't have bananas."" We replied laughing saying ""why didn't you tell when we were looking at the shakes."" All she said was ""what,"" so disappointed with the menu and the clueless employee we left. This wasn't the first time we dealt with clueless people. We walked in another time, not aware of their closing hours and walked in to order a shake. Mind you, their neon open sign was on and the doors were unlocked, so we assumed it was open. The employee then tells us ""you can't order we are closed,"" so we questioned the neon open sign, and again just a blank expression. Sadly, both times we were never able to get a shake, and now we will never get a shake from that place again. I remember the servers being so nice, but since the express crap happened that all went down the drain.",N3_zL-Uepgx4hYmvqCdTGA,0,0,1,_eD_pLWp2_z2nBok4zLXpQ

I'm a believer of Yelp reviews- probably not even 6 minutes after I ordered I called to cancel the order. Supposedly the food was already ready and the driver was there to pick it up. What the what?! Why didn't I just go to the McDonald's drive thru if I wanted a pre made burger. After spending 30 dollars and unable to get any kind of support or refund from both the restaurant or Uber eats, my husband was willing to still try it. SO DISGUSTING, so soggy and definitely premade!!! I will never ever ever ever ever come back here or recommend it to even my worst enemy. BARF. frieS are gross too. Super soggy, not fresh.

4384979,2017-04-01,0,_05kkfNQcAsj8eh-9wzI4w,"My gf & I ordered a classic burger & kids classic or whatever.

We waited for 22 minutes & then the worker said their printer is broken so no ones order was sent thru to the cooks in the back.

The cooks in the back can see through their window that there are 5 tables of people waiting.

A guy came in with a phone order & they said they haven't started his order so he asked for a refund.

The workers announced the printer malfunction situation & another 2 groups asked for a refund.

They offered us a free shake or dessert so we chose the birthday cake shake. It was creamy, good texture, tasted great.

5 minutes later, we finally got our food.

- The bun was way too big for burger patty. The burger tasted mediocre at best. Shake Shack, In n Out, & Five Guys burger makes this place a joke

- Fries were good.. tasted similar to Five Guys fries

- Serving amount was somewhat small.. definitely overpriced for how much food you get

Now that they've officially changed the name, I know I ""should"" be rating this place based on what they are, not what they were (without any personal bias) but it's kind of hard to when they really just added to the same name while cutting the menu in half. 

Their prices are what a restaurant should be priced at... but they USED to be a restaurant. As they are establishing, their not a restaurant anymore. They want to be looked at as fast food now (express). Here is the problem with that... They have $6 milkshakes... McDonald's is fast food and has $3 milkshakes about a block away. My gourmet burger I ordered here costed $10... in what fast food world? 

I loved this place for the servers. Really. They made this place. But now their employees are forced behind a counter the entire time. So they are like really nice, friendly, personable caged animals. It's sad. I wish they let them be servers again. That ONE SINGLE THING would make this difference for me to make the cost worth it.
