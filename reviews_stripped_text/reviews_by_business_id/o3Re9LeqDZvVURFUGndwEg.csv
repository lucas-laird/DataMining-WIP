Besides their prices being extremely high, they have this seafood mix in their meat department which is marked $2.99 lb and they sell a 1 lb bag.  The bag says 1 lb.  Yet the man weighed it and wrapped it up and marked it $3.59.  When I asked ""isn't it $2.99 a pound?""  He just said  ""no no""  that's something else/  But it clearly said what it was on the sign and that it was $2.99 lb.  So when I went to the front, I asked the lady at the register, ""isn't this supposed to be $2.99 lb ?""   to which she answered, ""that is 1 lb and 20"".   I was like  hmmm. ""are you sure?  It says 1lb.  Are they charging me for the plastic bag it comes in?    So I went home and looked carefully, and sure enough, it IS 1lb.  So BOTH the butcher and the cashier LIED TO ME!   I felt very hustled.  I mean if they aren't honest about that, what else aren't they honest about?  I really can't stand dishonest merchants.  I will never go back to that store again just for that one reason alone besides their prices being too high on everything else.",WIXe66z4LFZZhdzfRXLWoA,0,0,1,X_wESFPQL6ezPd6pMdn4bw

It looked like they had a huge selection of pastries? Not sure what it was.

Note: I only buy produce here, I have never purchased anything else.

Watermelon was 8lbs for $1 and roma's were 2lbs for $1. This is NOT organic like I usually buy this is the stuff that starts with a 4 not a 9! 

My fav thing about this place is all the different types of yummy fresh cactus they have.

The cashiers are nice and there is always a sweet security guard saying hi to us.

Some produce is super duper cheap and some is just about the same price as Smith's etc. 

Even though it's not organic I will keep coming back to buy cactus and prickly pears by the bags and will continue to enjoy the smiling employees.  

Check it out!",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,1,1,3,PJBbSjXfNQGUgeRvAxR-wg

With that being said I've been forced to live in this horrible excuse of a city (no offense natives) and was so disappointed with every single taco shop I went to,,, until I found this place. 

In front of a Mexican market in the hood right in front your nose will lead you to this amazing spot. Chicken, pork, shredded beef you name it they got it. Super authentic, spicy and juicy, fresh and delish!!! And only 1.14 a taco!?!? HEAVEN on earth. I go every tuesday on my lunch break and is totally the highlight of my week. Finally have a lil faith in this city",wurfvHZF2B1jzWj9QRRnGQ,2,1,5,TP0-mxV4OLsWCLbZ14X4Lg
