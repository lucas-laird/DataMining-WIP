I've always gotten the Turkey Bacon Club w/ no tomato and it's to die for.  The bread, meats, and cheeses always taste fresh. The customer service is very nice and friendly and the combo meal (which is what I get) isn't too pricey.

167091,2013-09-29,0,Jwwkt9oAKsNF4AuItTIdPw,"My wife and I went to Schlotzsky's for lunch yesterday (9-28). We decided to share a large French Dip sandwich, chips, and a drink. When the cashier said, ""$16.73"", I thought he mistakenly charged us for two sandwiches. Nope. The sandwich was $12.49 by itself. Add chips, drink, and tax, that comes to $16.73. Wow. For a few dollars more we could have eaten at the Carnegie Deli in the Mirage, and got a GIANT sandwich. Oh, I forgot to mention, the overpriced sandwich had less meat on it than a junior roast beef at Arby's (the 99 cent sandwich). I could not believe how skimpy the portion was, so I informed the cashier I was unhappy with the portion size. His only response was, ""Sorry"". I then asked for the manager. His response was, ""That's the recipe"". 
In conclusion, if you want average tasting food, high prices, tiny portions, and non-existent customer service, this is the place to go!

Thanks  Scott D. for planting the seed in my head.:)  My experience was surprisingly pleasant. I ordered the Texas Schlotzkys, with jalapeno cheese bread, ham, the works, plus more peppers, (ah, a trip down memory lane coming from Texas).  It was just as it always was, a little pricey, but very good, and then there's that smell that's uniquely Schlotzkys of buns baking when you walk in.  Only downside for me, was i ordered iced tea and the vat it comes in was down to the dregs... and tasted it.  Yuck.  Fortunately, that was corrected within minutes.

This location is a favorite of mine because the owner is so friendly & always remembers my order and even knows where I work & always makes it a point to say hi at my work. Today I decided I would get a sandwich from this location which is about a 20 minute drive from where I live. Let me add that I'm 8 months pregnant with gestational diabetes so I am forced to limit my carb intake. So I figured they would have my back. I went through the drive through & ordered a medium turkey original on wheat add jalapeños. That's it. No drink because I have water at home and can't have any sugar. I only waited a short time before my sandwich was ready & I was on my way back home to enjoy it. 20 minutes later I get home unwrap my sandwich to see that it's not on wheat bread so I can only eat a quarter of it (due to the amount of carbs in the white bread) but I realize that it's got a layer of jalapeños and no lettuce. The lettuce makes the sandwich! Normally I would have eaten it there but like I said I'm 8 months pregnant & wanted to get home. Now I'm stuck with this sandwich that I can only eat in quarter increments per hour, that's not even what I ordered.",jvC5IXM3LQ0KBGahs55_Ug,0,0,3,ik_ZOOOUkrx_xKfG_gEqZg

This one is close to my house and easy to get to from anywhere in the Valley. It's always busy but never crowded, and you can get in and out pretty fast.

I had a free sandwich/pizza coupon for my birthday as a member of the Bun & Fun eClub, and I opted for the chicken and pesto pizza. Tasty, and a good-sized portion for lunch. (Plus free is always nice!) My husband had a medium reuben on rye, and it was pretty good, too. He usually gets the original sandwich on sourdough, and I usually get a vegetarian sandwich on wheat, so we mixed it up a little this time around. All four are great choices, depending on your mood.

If you want a quick, tasty sandwich (or a personal-sized pizza), give Schlotzsky's a try. And if you go there often, I suggest signing up for the Bun & Fun eClub online.",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,plSLfoT8BUP_PDa_yOzfGg

This place is old. The building. Like 20th century old.  But they've got it going on where it counts which is back in the kitchen. Like so many others, me and Schlotzki's met up in another state. I was in Louisiana playing with my rich Uncle Sam. Found that one by accident just like I found this one by accident. 

To everyone who wrote a bad review about the food, you must be on Crack! Can't touch the bread. I took one star off because of the building. The stuff in the bag was on point. I was expecting a let down. Perhaps my memory of Schlotzki's was too much to live up to. They lived up to my memory exactly.

I'm a fan of Schlotzsky's, have been since I was a kid. 

For those who've never been, it's basically a sub shop. It's their bread more than anything that sets them apart. Their bread is sponge like, hard to explain but tasty.

I've known Schlotzsky's forever, and I noticed this place out of the corner of my eye driving through Vegas. So we stopped in. I ordered the Original, my gf ordered the smoked turkey and guacamole and our friend ordered the chicken chipotle. We all ordered the medium size, unless you're super starving or sharing, stick with the medium. The large is just huge. 

I was totally satisfied, and so was our traveling companion. My gf though, not so much. I think I know why. The smoked turkey they use is really smoking. I wasn't sure if it was turkey or johnny walker black label in the sandwich. I think if it was regular oven roasted turkey, she'd like it a lot more.

What I really liked was the different sizes for *everything*. Everything can be ordered small, medium, or large. They also put the calories next to everything.

I went with the Small Original, which was not the best but definitely not the worst. If there was one near UNLV I would definitely pop in quite often, especially with the range of sandwiches and breads as well as the menu selections for pizzas, pastas, and soups.

If I do return I'm not going to grab chips, though, because they are salted way too much. I'm a man of spice but the salt on my salt and vinegar chips were legitimately burning my mouth in a way I didn't anticipate nor find pleasant. The soda selection does include IBC sodas, so I think that makes up for the chips! (Any place that exceeds the normal fountain drinks make me happy.)

3129233,2018-03-11,0,Jwwkt9oAKsNF4AuItTIdPw,Ok so I'm very picky when it comes to corned beef & Pastrami. I practically grew up in Jewish Deli's. The Pastrami is not like good cured Pastrami that you find in Jewish Deli's. It's ok in my opinion. The Dark Rye is very soft unlike a good rye. Not my kind of Deli. But it might be someone's Deli,3tCzdXFXke958utEjcSdmg,0,0,2,BTmKi4cDOouaPn3IYWzIgg

3382285,2018-02-22,1,Jwwkt9oAKsNF4AuItTIdPw,"Schlotzsky's is one of my all-time favorite sandwich spots. I have been coming here since they opened 38 years ago. The staff has always been very friendly and knowledgeable in explaining the different sandwiches.

They have a special sourdough bread that I have not seen at any other food Spot. They also have a jalapeno Cheese sourdough,

When they first open they had a very minimal menu with just the signature sandwiches and a couple soups and salads now they have extended the menu quite a bit and here it is

These are their classic sandwiches they started off with:

My favorite is the turkey, original style but with only turkey (no pork) 

Every once and a while I'll get the one with avocado... but honestly the regular sandwich is so good I don't think it needs anything extra. I'm also thrilled that the location by my work carries China Mist Passion Fruit Black Tea (my absolute favorite iced tea) I love it!!!

But maybe that has more to do with the run down building and not-always-clean interior. Regardless, I've been a fan for the past few years. The thing that elevates their sandwiches from 'solid' to good or great is their bread. It's lightly toasted, so the edges are a little crispy, but the rest is soft, chewy and spongey. Definitely unique compared to most other sandwich places in town. 

My usual is the ham & cheese, but 'The Original', turkey club, and roast beef sandwiches are all good. Portions are big. The regular size is usually enough for 2 in my opinion.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,1,1,4,Nmg1ti5s0ika1XLJsCbVZA

The exterior is nothing special; there is a small parking lot that is in a bit of disrepair. 

Inside you'll find a basic interior that seems to be going for the simple New York deli look. Simple tables and wooden chairs.  It was not busy at all though it was the middle of the day. There is a self service soda station. 

There is a large menu board, but it contains few details about what is actually on the items (eg what comes on the turkey sandwich?). It does list calories, however. They do have a lot of different options including tons of sandwiches and pizzas as well. The gentleman taking orders had a friendly sort of gruffness (if that makes sense). He had a very stoic expression, though, so I was never sure if he was serious or kidding. Him: Do you want cheese on that? Me: Do you have Swiss? Him: Well, only for you. After you order you wait for them to call out the order from the little pickup window. 

The turkey sandwich was pretty good. I didn't realize it was going to be served hot (I couldn't see that outlined anywhere on the menu), but that was OK. The bread was sort of a light and airy roll with a somewhat glossy surface. The turkey was OK; it seemed like basic lunch meat quality. The vegetables (lettuce and tomato) were similarly OK; I did like the spicy mustard which really made the whole sandwich. There was a small bit of melted Swiss cheese.  They have their own cute brand of chips (regular and baked). The plain baked tasted like baked Lays, so nothing to write home about. 

The interior was fairly clean, although trash had accumulated around the drink station.

We ordered the chicken cordon blue and the pastrami sandwiches- both regular (three sizes, but don't bother with the small size because it's more like snack size) and split it. The chicken cordon blue was perfect(high marks for this one)- fresh baked bun spongy, thinly sliced chicken with thinly sliced ham and topped with a slice of crispy bacon (wasn't expecting the bacon but it worked). Very good and satisfying. The pastrami (on dark rye) sandwich was good but the meat was extremely fatty- even after trimming it off before eating it. My husband pulled out large pieces of fat from his half too. If you still plan on getting it, use a plastic knife to trim off all the fat. My husband loves their fresh baked bread- pretty unique as far as delis go.

The deli is well stocked with many choices besides sandwiches, including pizza, salads, soups, chips, pickles, and cookies (my husband who has a sweet tooth, enjoyed the cookie- soft and chewy). Free refills on drinks.

I dont. Well lemme say, I like certain sandwiches warm and toasty but not one with avocado. We came here a while ago because I LOVE deli sandwiches. I have never been here so I was EXCITED. Like a virgins first lay I was let down : (

I love any sandwich with avocado, alas its an add on so it more expensive so I opted for the turkey bacon club with avocado. They ask what size I want. So I pick the medium bc the small looked itty bitty, I opted for the combo but was kinda irritated when it was almost 9$!

Flat breads, salads, wraps, and even pizzas!
I haven't had the flat bread....

the Veggie Pizza is another of my favorites!",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,0,0,4,tMEQm6DmVoZNPhSXYGa5RQ
4511662,2015-11-22,6,Jwwkt9oAKsNF4AuItTIdPw,"I can't remember ever having sampled a Schlotzky's sandwich before this summer, but I heard my friend extoll their virtues many times as we planned our trip to Las Vegas.  She insisted we HAD to eat at a Schlotzky's before we left.  We were staying down on the strip, but we used our Yelp app to locate this Schlotzky's and guide us here.

The first thing I noticed upon entering were the bright red paint on the walls. It really is quite striking at first.  There was a television in the corner, and this sandwich shop is jam packed full of tables.  They were definitely trying to maximize the usable space.

The next thing I noticed was a neon sign proudly declaring that their bread is baked fresh daily.  That's certainly a good sign.  I walk up to the counter to peruse the menu and order.  I decide that I MUST try the Albuquerque Turkey sandwich (ha ha that rhymes) sandwich consisting of smoked turkey breast, crispy strips of bacon, mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheeses, fire roasted veggies, lettuce, tomatoe, chipotle mayo - are you drooling yet? - on a freshly bakes Jalapeno cheese bun. OH YEEEEEEEEAH!  It was the perfect sandwich to introduce me to Schlotzky's and I must say I immediately became a fan.

I grabbed a bag of chips - oooooooh, excitement, they have two different flavors of baked chips, regular and barbeque.  I head over to the soda fountain to get a drinkzsky (their cutesy term, not mine).  Bummer, the only diet soda option is Diet Coke, but they do have three kinds of tea: passion fruit, unsweetened, and Southern sweet tea.

Last cutezsky note: There is a sign on the wall announcing that they do catering ""we're haulin bunz"" and the restrooms are labeled ""manly bunz"" and shapely bunz prompting me to contemplate what one does if they have shapely man bunz?

In the last 2 weeks my bf and I have ordered delivery from Schlotzsky's more than 3 times and have not been disappointed yet. I've tried the turkey club, tuna melt, part of my bfs pastrami and chipotle sandwich (name is escaping my mind ATM). Plus... Cinnabon!!. And not a knock off cinnamon roll they call Cinnabon. Realllll Cinnabon. And I might be biased since I love cinnamon rolls, but it makes it any dinner two times better. 

Their salads are really good too! The turkey Cobb is delicious and their Caesar is super hearty! I also love their chips. They are labeled as Schlotzky chips, so idk if they directly make them.

We usually get the large sandwich and share it. And of course we always add extra cheese! We eat half of it and then put the rest in the fridge and reheat it late at night. The trick to reheating it is to wrap it in a paper towel and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Also put a cup of water in the microwave with it so it's steams and gets the sandwich nice and moist. Then take the sandwich and put it in a toaster oven and toast it so the outside of the bread crisps up. You will not be disappointed!,eNfbt7yJVLPhPkihr2koKQ,0,0,5,y-xEC-FlA3M82b8PFd_Fzg

Everyone got the Original and I grabbed a pesto chicken. There wasn't anything really remarkable with the sandwich despite the dining room being busy. The bread was nice soft and spongy inside with a crisp outside, but there wasn't much filling and a half a slice of tomato and shredded iceburg with some pesto. I threw their hot sauce on it to make it a bit better. A small was deceivingly filling, but I don't eat just be filled up. 

I like that their drink fountain has 3 kinds of ice tea AND two flavors of lemonade to make some great arnold palmer concoctions. The first cup of tea just tasted old. The 2nd was a different kind and it was the same. So the 3rd cup I just did lemonade and it tasted like the plastic dispenser. WTF?

This place may be old, but the owner does a good job keeping it clean, and service is VERY friendly.

5116092,2012-06-11,0,Jwwkt9oAKsNF4AuItTIdPw,"I'm the type of person who enjoys trying different things. When someone suggests eating sandwiches, I'd much rather try something out of the norm, rather than settling for Subway (although I don't have a problem with Subway at all!)

That being said, Schlotzsky's is NOTHING like subway, so I don't even think they're comparable. Yes, they both serve sandwiches, but subway serves mostly cold subs, while Schlotzsky's serves round, hot sandwiches that'll cause a party in your mouth with an explosion of flavors. 

The only concern I have with this place is the immensity of options. I can sit there wondering what to eat for hours. The pizzas are my personal favorite, but they have this new roasted turkey sandwich with avocado that rocked my tastebuds. 

I simply don't understand the previous comment complaining about avocado on a hot sandwich? It's just like any other cold vegetable that's added on a hot item. A burrito, a burger, nachos, etc. Avocado is a creamy addition that'll improve the flavor of almost any sandwich, hot or cold. 

That being said, I personally love this place. I enjoy the drink selection, their original selection of chips, even their cookies! I have had one time where I went through the drive-thru and got the wrong sandwich, I would have gone back, but there wasn't anything I disliked about it like onions or olives, so I just dealt. Other than that, I've enjoyed every other time I've been there.

It's Schlotzsky's. There's not too much to say about it, right? Yea, it's a national chain (or was), but I don't care. They make delicious sandwiches on fantastic bread. This particular one doesn't have the uniform look that I've come to know, but the food is every bit as good. The Original is just about perfection! Also, in case you were unaware, they carry their own brand of chips. With flavors like Black Pepper and Jalapeno (regular, NOT kettle!!!), they are a refreshingly addictive side...and maybe a second or third bag for homework later. They also offer a variety of baked goods and desserts, but I haven't tried any of them yet. The staff is always, ALWAYS super-friendly and helpful, too. I mean, what else can you ask for?

Not necessarily the best you'll ever have but definitely delicious primarily because of the proprietary, round, sourdough bread  that envelops the filling. Warm, fluffy, and resembling the moon's crater-filled acne, the bread is enhanced by a unique combo of ingredients plus a nice 'spicy' ranch sauce drizzled on top of your fillings. One bite wonder.

Liberally soak your sandwich in the 'cajun' Schlotzsky's hot sauce (not spicy at all fyi) til your sandwich starts resembling a taco and be prepared to experience taste bud bliss.

The pizzas are also VERY good. Surprising but true. The veggie is very tasty. Drizzle that sauce, baby!

The Vegas location isn't pretty by any means but considering there are no Schlotzsky's Delis in NorCal anymore, I'll deal with it.
