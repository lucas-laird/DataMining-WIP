The girls that work there were courteous, helpful and the food came out quickly. The place is clean with Hawaiian music playing in the background to give it a nice ambiance. With all of that being said, the food was mediocre. I ordered the seafood mixed plate with Mahi Mahi, fried shrimp and beef short ribs.  First of all, the Mahi Mahi was incredibly thin, almost paper thin. I would much rather pay a little more for a good piece of fish, than to have been given such a thin piece. The flavor of the fish was decent, but there was just not much of it. The shrimp was cooked a little too long, so it was almost on the burnt side and the beef short ribs had really good flavor, but were extremely tough. Most of the beef short ribs I had to chew up and spit out because I couldn't swallow them, since they were just too tough. Overall, I don't think I'll be coming back.",F2WE-m9JBlp92WBt_8OBng,0,0,3,Ki4E44BAPmUqY4kQcMc-0Q

My kids had chicken katsu and didn't complain about it so I guess it was okay. My husband had the bbq beef and chicken plate with short ribs and he said it was okay as well. We also ordered the donuts and there was more sugar in the container than on the donuts. I ended up drizzling honey and sprinkled cinnamon on them to make them taste better otherwise it was plain fry bread. We've had better Hawaiian food.

1687868,2018-01-11,1,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"It was a busy day leading into a busy night and so there was not much cooking going on at the camp.  After a quick ""Where do you want to eat?"" and a few ""What are you in the mood for's?""  The oracle that is yelp was consulted and this bookmark was found.  It was agreed and the GF and I were out the door.

Upon arrival...I thought due it being the witching hour that we might be in for a bit of a wait.  Not so!  I was pleasantly surprised to find Tiki's not so busy on a cold and rainy night. 

Walking in...the paint scheme and theme made me smile.  Then things got a bit awkward.  The gentleman being the counter simply greeted us and that was about it.  There was a lot of options on the menu.  I began to feel a sense of information overload while trying to make a decision.  Struggling to find that perfect meal, I was left to suffer in silence.  No customary assistance and no further friendliness. Dang it!

I soldiered on and placed my bets on the ""Bento"" ($9.75).  It came with BBQ Beef, BBQ Chicken, Fish Fillet, and Chicken Katsu.  The combo plates also come with two scoops of rice and a scoop of Mac salad.  I also ordered a side of Kimchi for good measure.

The food was prepared quick enough.  It quality is similar to other Hawaiian establishments I have visited.  Alas, there was no follow-up by anyone about the experience.

I've ordered thru Yelp and have called as well. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is there customer service. I've ordered food here over 10 times and have never been offered their stamp card. The one time I noticed they have a stamp card the person at the front said I can't have one.

I ordered the fish sandwich. The fish filet they used was super thin! It was so thin that there were spaces between the fish flakes. (Usually fish has a degree of density that even when removing the meat which flakes off there is more meat underneath it.) The fish was fried way too long and created a limp, rubbery taste.  The fries, however, were good. 

The macaroni salad had a funky pasta after taste like the kind you experience with some cold pasta salads. 

Even the soda tasted as if the syrup to carbonation was ""off.""

3617417,2017-10-27,5,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"I'd say 3.5 but rounding up to 4,  always nice to have a little reminder of home even though you're 2700 miles away.

It's pretty authentic Hawaiian plate lunch fare similar to the food you'd get at places like L&L and Loco Moco BBQ.  Authentic all the way down to Hawaiian Kine 105 Radio streaming over the speakers.  If for some reason I woke up in this this place after being in a drug haze, I'd swear I was in Hawaii.

Mark H is new to this area and we were looking at places to have dinner, he was in the mood for a plate lunch and I will never turn down rice, mac salad, and meat  (also knowing he doesn't like mac salad and I'd probably be getting his portion of salad made the decision easier.) :)  He ordered the Chicken Katsu and I got the Chicken Katsu Curry,  overall, they were both pretty good.  The katsu was well prepared, nice crunchiness from the panko and not overly breaded or heavy.  They also give good portions so most eaters will have leftovers to take home.

A few critiques I'd give about the plates...

*The rice isn't the good, medium grain sticky white rice you'd get in a Hawaii plate lunch, it's more like a cross between the looser rice you'd get at a Chinese take out and the standard sticky rice...think jasmine or basmati rice that's just wet enough to hold together with a scoop.

*The sauce that came with the Katsu was WAYYYYY too sweet, the katsu sauce at places like L&L is sweet but this one was even sweeter.

*The Curry on my Katsu Curry had a decent flavor but was too thin.  It didn't cover the chicken like it should, more like ran off the chicken and collected at the bottom.

All in all, it's a good rendition of the plate lunch from Hawaii.  The new house is only a couple miles away so I'm sure we'll be back to try some of the other things.",IfLTw-yFMpuiqAdYRxLv8Q,13,10,4,RovCMjIEaRBkhDq1QHuMYw

3754434,2017-08-09,0,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"My wife and I love trying new restaurants, and this was probably the best initial experience I've ever had. The service and food we're both topnotch, and very unexpected for a new restaurant.

The food was probably the best example of casual Hawaiian I can think of, and I've eaten at almost all of the local spots. The chicken katsu was crispy, but not burnt, and juicy inside. The spicy chicken had a great kick, and was served with sauteed onions (also cooked in the sauce) and chives for garnish. The macaroni salad was creamy and tangy, without that common curdled stickiness. The rice and veggies were also great, but to be fair those are hard to get wrong.

We were greeted by two young ladies wearing leis at the counter, and they were helpful while not being too pushy with our ordering. The menu is definitely vast for a venue of this size, and it took awhile to sort through the offerings. I ordered a half & half combo, and my wife ordered a small portion of chicken katsu (which seemed to be a regular portion, and came with rice), and out order totaled about $18! It was ready in about 5 minutes and was brought to our table.

The restaurant was very clean, and it has a cohesive look to it. It's thoroughly decorated in kitschy Hawaiian, and it's bright and inviting. There are numerous banners and menu pictures to help newcomers find something they'd like.

The staff was nice. We were helped right away. We got the BBQ mix plate and since I was with my mom she insisted that all the meat be well done. We were served at our table and right away I tried the macaroni salad. It had nice flavors to it. The reviews were right! I loved that the request was well done but they took care not to burn it.

4015854,2017-07-27,16,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"While I was cruising for my morning Starbucks crack addiction yesterday I saw this place, immediately looked it up on Yelp, and decided it would be dinner. I had to wait ALL day to go back for grub(the first world struggle, y'all).

So, this place is new, which means it is really clean and they are eager to get you food. I dig it. When I drove into the shopping center, I noticed a young lady holding a sign with the name of the business and ""Now Open"". They are trying to get their name out there. Parking lot was a clusterfuck , but this lot is always that way(I've noticed way too many Vegas parking lots that make no sense. That's another story,though). 

There were a few people waiting for to go orders when I walked in, which is a good sign. It was a Wednesday at 5:30 p.m., so I wasn't expecting anyone. The counter ladies were nice and placing my order was super easy. I went with the chicken katsu mini plate just to give me an idea of their portion sizes and quality of their offerings. I was a little reluctant to try Hawaiian BBQ again after my last experience at a place near my residence, so I didn't want to over order the first time. 

Food was out quick and brought over to me in a to go bag and I was out of there! Side note: they play nice music, the menu is on the windows at the entrance so you can see it before you enter and overhead at the counter. Prices are comparable to other Hawaiian BBQ joints. 

I raced home(not really because I was literally getting every red light on Durango, of course) and was ready to flip that styrofoam lid up. The smell in my car was strong and I was hangry. Yeah, you read that right: HANGRY!

*styrofoam lid flip* BAM! Lots of food was the first thing I noticed. The mini plate was definitely a good choice. They gave me a lot of chicken katsu and let's talk about the CK(not Calvin Klein, stick with me here). The chicken katsu was amazing. Like seriously. The chicken was juicy and the breading crisp and not too thick. It was a lovely fried shell of happiness. Seasoned well. It came with a yummy BBQ sauce that was sweet, tangy, with a hint of spicy, I ate it all and I don't even really like BBQ sauce to be honest. So good! Rice was standard scoop rice that had a slight stickiness to it that I enjoyed. I didn't get any soya sauce in my to go order, so that would be nice to get. I just put sriracha all over my mini mountain  of rice and I was happy. Lastly....the macaroni salad *queue the heavens opening up and angels singing*. Hot damn this macaroni salad was the bomb! I was so sad after my last Hawaiian BBQ experience and the fail with the mac salad(that sounds like a rapper name), so this place restored my faith again. Creamy, soft, cold, flavorful as f*ck.

5084327,2017-09-15,6,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"Little bit of backstory, I was going to cater Hawaiian BBQ for my cats birthday party (yeah you read that right. A birthday party. For my cat.) and so I took a trip around town to find the best place to do so, visited multiple Hawaiian places to find the perfect one. Tiki's won. I take catering for parties very seriously!

For dining in - I ordered the combo plate with a mix of the BBQ beef and chicken, both were good, not too fatty, and cooked well. Also came with the standard rice and macaroni salad. Also came with short ribs, which were awesome. 

Based on the one dining experience I had here and it's location, I decided Tiki's was my best bet for catering.

I ended up making the right decision for sure. Came in the morning when they first opened and ordered a tray of spicy chicken, short ribs, and rice to be picked up in the afternoon. Picked up on the dot and everything was ready to go, correct order and friendly service.

Spicy chicken was delicious, and is super spicy, for all you spice loving foodies. Short ribs were a hit, I didn't have any leftovers (my cat liked them too). They were also nice enough to through in some pastries for free, which were delicious.

Their mixed plate portion were pretty great with pricing compared to some others out there. Food quality decent enough to be full and satisfied.

Chicken Katsu (fried breaded panko chicken) is always a pretty common menu item order and most restaurants get the perfection of it! Menu items were similar to L&L hawaiian bbq.

5517565,2018-03-05,2,a09UyTP6KoaARapiMU7oJw,"The hubs works nearby so we stop in a few times a month whenever we visit for his lunch since they've opened. If it were up to my 4 year old, he'd give this place 10 stars. He loves his chicken katsu. The regular katsu plate is enough for him, my 2 year old, and I to share. Honestly, I don't eat too big during lunch so if you're hungry...don't follow my lead. Lol. Katsu is pretty good. Crispy and fresh as it should be. The chicken isnt sweating oil either. 

Overall, everything we've tried has been pretty good and satisfying. I don't live back home (Oahu) so I gotta make do with what we got on the 9th isle. Their bbq beef burger was literally the most legit bbq beef burger I've had since I left the islands. 

I have to give this place just a casual 3.5 stars as it isn't a place that gives you anything more than you can get elsewhere at similar establishments. As much times as I've been here, it could've been an easy 4 stars and I feel bad about not giving the 4 stars. But I can't do that for a few reasons...

We have ordered their beef curry a couple times and each time that beef was tough. So tough it pissed the husband off on the 2nd try and also because he willingly, knowingly, and patiently waited quite a bit for his order. The *spam* saimin pisses me off because they don't really give you spam. It's luncheon meat they use. The color and texture by the naked eye...full-on luncheon meat. May fool those who don't know spam like that. But not I. That is not legit kine saimin. Fortunately for them, I don't eat the spam/luncheon meat in my saimin anyway....lol. small kine weird island girl. But still, if you're gonna label spam saimin, make sure it's spam. Okay, okay...enough of that. Lol.

Finally, the bbq beef burger I have ordered on numerous visits...very tasty...BUT! Ugh, why must the meat be so chewy that I gotta play tug-of-war when biting into it. Peeve. It wasn't like that the first couple times. But...because I actually think it's just good in general...I continue to order it. I'm basically giving you more of a heads up.

Tiki is a pretty good option to dine at while in the vicinity. As I said, the hubs works nearby and my kids just love Hawaiian food-period. So it's a solid easy option for us. Nothing to drive across town for or for us to go out our way, though. 

The service has been pretty consistent and good to us so I can't complain. They do have stamp cards for every regular size plate you purchase. I believe it's either after the 8th or 9th plate, you'll get the next one free. 

Kid and semi-stroller friendly.

My heart still belongs to Island Flavor (10/10 check them out) but since I don't always want to make the 20 mile drive to the southwest part of town, I'm always looking for something to satisfy my craving close to home! 

My husband and I stopped by last night on our way home from the store. We both got a two meat plate, $20ish with drinks. I got chicken katsu and BBQ beef and my husband got chicken katsu and moshiko chicken. First of all, the food came out steaming hot (which seems to be rare as time goes on...) so that was a huge plus for me. The katsu was perfectly fried crisp, not too much breading. They chop up the BBQ beef into little pieces so you don't have to do it yourself, which is awesome. Taste was up to par. Mac salad was delicious. No fishy taste like the other places I've been to around here. Rice is rice, their's did taste nice and moist, though. My husband's moshiko chicken was good! It's chicken that's been dipped beer batter and fried. 

Overall, we will be coming back. I hope they reconfigure the seating situation once they are a bit more established. The way they've got it now, you'd be bumping into people left and right if the place is full. 

Things to know:
1) The place is small, if you've got a big family, you may want to take your food to go. 
2) The food is not made by Hawaiians. Everyone we saw was Chinese. Not racist (I'm a Pacific Islander) but just an FYI bc I was thrown off a bit when I walked in the door. Regardless, all the workers were kind and the food tasted great.",vTRMvxUdMU8aeFF3mSpiFw,0,0,5,r0NMB9Rkkt3sezFugeZNBQ
