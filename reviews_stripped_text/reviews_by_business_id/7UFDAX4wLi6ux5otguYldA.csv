This was delicious the sauce had good body and had real body with great taste. The large noodles were great with good portions. It was perfect did not over eat and was so good I finished every bit. I would recommend this restaurant and will go back again. Its know as steak house so next time will try the steaks. They also have a brunch maybe will try this.

Even if you get past the fact that the dinner menu is so short, and I couldn't even really find anything I liked, the first time I went there and used a new credit card I got a fraudulent charge the following week or so (I never even used this card anywhere else at that point). I brushed it off and went again on my birthday. The waiter gave another birthday person complementary dessert literally in front of me, 2 feet away, but charged me for mine even though I mentioned I was celebrating mine. It's not that I even care about that few dollars. It's just very iffy. No reason to come back here.",kwV24XuUKN5ncelesciW-A,1,0,1,0x-jUIqr56bTsko62g0ESA

We originally came for the $1 oyster special and happy hour.  We sat down at the patio area and was given the menu.  Just a few minutes later, our busboy served us water.  Great so far. 
Then 10 minutes later, no one has stopped by to take our order.  The place was close to empty, it was not busy at all.  5 minutes later, we decided to just leave. 
As we were walking out, the waitress apologized and said that she was busy with other customers, which was a lie but that's OK.  Then as we walked away, the host said ""don't be afraid of the $ sign"" 
Very condescending and down right racist (we were the only non-white customer at the time of this incident).

The service was below average though I don't fault our server because he seemed like he was looking after more tables than he should have been. 

Our steaks (our party ordered three cowboy ribeyes among other things) came out all at different temperatures despite ordering two mid rare and one medium. We had to send one back to be remade because it was way over cooked! They did that for us but I just wish it didn't have to happen that way. 

The door was also open which allowed a stiff breeze in the restaurant. We didn't ask them to close it but thought it was ironic that the hostess seemed to have a space heater near her. So they knew it was cold! 

It was good food with great company in a visually appealing restaurant. However, it was simply average in my opinion after factoring all of it together.",FWmqs6tgPuzKdrrweKBIrA,0,0,3,mBgITzblvdQjib8--17QpA
181916,2015-09-03,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I ate here with my husband, since he's been harassing me for the past month to have surf and turf... So when passing by this place, I knew we had to try it!

The environment is very clean. Walls are draped with white and the tables are set very minimally with nice floral accents. The menu is quite small, and as our first time attending the restaurant, we were a little talks back with the prices at first. But, after realizing that this place really knows their meats, and that we are also located in Downtown Summerlin, we figured it was then fitting. They also had a live singer near the entrance, which I LOVED. She was so good. (I waived on the way out and my husband made fun of me... )

I ordered the skirt steak ($30) and added on shrimp scampi ($15 for 3 pieces of shrimp) and I must say that I was very impressed. The meal came in a timely manner, and had very good seasoning and taste. The meat was very moist and tender, while the shrimp charred and grilled to perfection. 

I honestly was most impressed with our servers. They were all so knowledgable when it came to the cuts of meat and where they were cut from the animal. They also give very vivid descriptions of how the sauces and dishes taste. 

The only reason it gets a 4, is that although the experience was memorable, the food really wasn't for me. It tasted great and everything, but I wasn't blown away... Especially for the prices that we paid. It's definitely a very nice ""date"" restaurant, and perfect for a night out in Downtown Summerlin.",sEsAi7Z9tmjyTWwLG6OaDw,1,0,4,eTMd1H_avEQRRWx_TFHF0Q

The location is far away from everything else at DT Summerlin. The sun was in our eyes and the waiter said they had no way to close the blinds.

Whoever removed my plate looked down at it and no doubt registered that it was inedible meat. i think that the chefs need to pay attention to what they're serving because the price tag did not guarantee a good steak.

The best thing about going here, however, it seemed like they really wanted to accommodate us and wanted our business.

I mentioned to our waiter that our flowers were missing. Saw him speaking with a manager and then the flowers appeared. No apologies to me what so ever. The Service was so-so. At one point Elizabeth did come by and say Happy Birthday, but it would have been lovely if she would have introduced herself to us. We finished our meal and guess what... No special birthday desert!

667704,2015-06-23,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Very disappointed. Made a reservation for 5:30 PM and was sure to include that we were celebrating my wife's birthday (included her name).

Arrived on time and promptly seated. Previous reviews are spot on. With the very nice atmosphere, decor and courteous reception, I was set to be impressed. My first doubt entered when we were offered bottled water. I declined for the table. Glasses were immediately cleared and no further offer of water was proffered. OK, an oversight not to bring generic ice water - soldier on - I mean it's only water.

Ordered drinks and things again took an upswing. We all had the Frecnh Onion Soup and I must say it was quite good - now not only on the upswing but looking forward to a lovely evening.

Ordered sequentially, the Ribeye Cap Steak, NY Strip, and the 20 oz. bone in Ribeye. The steaks arrived and I will give credit for the fact that they arrived cooked to order despite our lengthy enjoyment of the soup. However, this is when things went downhill in a hurry. The quality of the meat was just barely above any restaurant in Vegas - and I would include just about ANY steak restaurant in town, regardless of price or ambiance. The cap steak was unappealing at best and the bone in Ribeye was just plain terrible. By the time I finished, there was more bone and fat left on my plate than the steak that I managed to cut away. The NY Strip was adequate, although, for the price, I would have to say ""barely"" adequate.

The sides were billed as ""family"" portions that could be shared. I will say they were fairly good but each portion was ""individual"" at best. On an up note, if you do try this place, make sure to order the waffle mac-n-cheese - certainly the highlight of the meal.

Overall, the meal was about on par with any chain steakhouse to include Claim Jumper, John Cutter's, and OK, Denny's. The problem with Andiron is that the bill came to $250 before the tip. I don't gripe about price as long as it is worth the expense. This, clearly, was not.

Andiron seems to bill themselves as a high end steak and seafood restaurant. In reality, they are a great deal of atmosphere with mediocre service and substandard food. You can park all the Mercedes and Jags on the curb that you want but the food and service must deliver.

I suppose the most disappointing thing was the fact that the waiter and bar attendant must have overheard our comments of disappointment because at the conclusion of our meal the Maître De came by for a second time. His question? ""How are you doing?"" I responded ""Fine."" (Since I was indeed fine). He smiled... and WALKED AWAY. Oh, and by the way, never once did anyone acknowledge my wife's birthday. 

If you want to spend $100 a person on a meal, please consider Michael's at the South Point or Twin Creeks at the Silverton. At Michael's you will get in spades what Andiron promises but utterly fails to deliver. At Twin Creeks you will get a little more than Andiron delivers, at half the price.

A Follow Up:

I was contacted by Andrew the following day. My guess is that my written comment on the bill that I ""will not be back"", finally got someone's attention. Andrew was pleasant and urged me to return so they could ""make up for our bad experience."" I have raised my rating of this establishment from one to two stars based solely on the fact that Andrew went to the trouble to contact me. Unfortunately, our experience was bad enough that I am afraid we will not be able to take Andrew up on his kind offer to give them another try. But, thank you anyway.",8M3BjHToPqcBHQR9imfTlA,3,0,2,bjkRAbcxvVbMGmEcRc2CFw

I love wine, but I have a hard time paying $120 for a $30 bottle of wine. I kept looking at $50-$60 bottles and the server would try to sell me a bottle that was double the price instead. Finally settled on a $75 cab (one I buy regularly for $20) from their sommelier's recommendation list, and then he came back and said he couldn't find it! If it's in your recommendation list, MIGHT want to make sure you have it! So he brought the more expensive one with him. I gave into that one because we were now almost 30 minutes in... Overall, it was NOT worth the $225 price tag for two people who shared an entree... sounds like some people really enjoy their happy hour, so I may be back for that, but definitely not dinner. So many other places actually worth that high-priced check! 

UPDATE: I was contacted right away by a manager to apologize for our experience. We have since been back for dinner and had a much better overall experience.",sh7p_gW1LUITHs1ZIR-dJg,1,1,4,MuLH3H8CPz22MqL6LDwQxQ
852608,2017-04-10,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"First time at Andiron. Enjoy Honey Salt, though the service isn't particularly good.  Pretty decor, but we found the lighting odd. Food was just okay. Carrot soup was bland and the steaks were average. What really made the for an awful experience was the service. The waiter did not notice we were out of our wine by the glass despite walking right by the table twice. We both ordered steak (rib cap and ribeye) and were not asked what sauce we wanted, just brought the steak sauce. Took a long time to get our food,  both appitizers and entree, though the restaurant was not particularly busy. Manager did not seem to be on the floor at all.  Great service might have saved the night. Busboy was the only one putting in the effort. $174 for 2 (before tip) and not nearly worth it. We won't go back. Husband is in the business and we dine out a lot. Sad because it's very close to our house and we like to support neighborhood businesses.

862828,2017-04-24,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I went on a Saturday night, and it wasn't very busy.  The place is large, so the vibe was kinda lifeless.  I was with a party of seven, and they put us in the back of the restaurant, which contributed to the dead vibe.  I think the restaurant should be a little more strategic in how they seat their guests.

I had the hamachi crudo and the grilled branzino.  The crudo was good, but not $17 good.  The branzino was served as a good portion size, which was nice, but the skin was a bit mushy.  I would stay away from that dish.

Several people at my table had a variety of steaks, and they all thought they were very good.  A funny thing is, a couple of the steak knives were dull, so they had good steaks, but had a mash the meat with the dull knife to get a bite (I'm not sure why they didn't ask for a new knife?).

The beer selection needs s lot of work.  I think they're a bit behind the times on their beer menu.  With all the great beers out there, good beer selection can really add a great experience to the meal.

All in all Andiron is a nice, well decorated place.  Maybe I hit it on an off night, but the place has a corporate, sterile feel.  Most of the food is probably pretty good, but they simply lack some attention to detail.  There are simply too many great places to try in Vegas not to be at your best all the time.",jDxifg3K9uzzXW4hFK3XQA,0,0,2,URp_-IKS6H3WHnl6MQoyGg

Service - On point and everything seemed natural to them.  All staff that interacted with us was warm and friendly.  Both managers (lady and a gentleman) were also very nice.

Food:
9oz Grass-fed Filet - Perfect temperature, unfortunately little or no seasoning.  I topped it with the Foie Gras add on!  Awesome.  Paired the béarnaise  with it.  It was a bit loose for my taste..perhaps it was thinned out with water..?  Also ordered the asparagus which was cooked perfectly and twice baked potato which was delicious.

My in laws and wife had the Wagyu burger, Farro Rissotto, and Foie Gras appetizer.  Everyone loved their dishes with the exception of the Risotto which was not their fault as the guest in my party read the menu wrong.

We all shared the chocolate dessert option and were very pleased.

Overall its a very classy place with great service and solid food.  Unfortunately for me the prices are way too expensive for being an off the strip restaurant.  You could easily spend $100+ per person here if your not careful.",5lyRtA4uRP7U13zPUr3I4g,0,0,4,7mpkNlc3cL87knyrziMlYw

After working ten years as a professional chef (CIA graduate), I've come to expect more from a restaurant that wants to command a $75-$100 per person price point. We joined them on a Friday night, the restaurant was very busy and there was only a single hostess greeting and seating parties. It took a very long time to seat our table of six, even though we were on time for our reservation. Management was nowhere to be found. Once at our table the service did improve, but the food was a let down. If you're a steakhouse, especially asking $40-$50 a steak, you better be able to get your temperatures right. Two of our party sent their medium-rare's which were med-well, back. One had to have there's done twice and on the third steak finally got their steak done rare and settled for it. So, out of six, only one in our party had theirs correct, the others, while not sending them back were over cooked. All in all, the meal was a C+.

1057563,2015-10-26,3,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Andiron Steak & Seafood provided a lovely and tasty meal.  

DÉCOR: I immediately enjoyed the open classic colonial meets modern Caribbean vibe. The soft greens and whites were crisp and inviting. And yeah, I'm a sucker for live music and had already decided I was in the right place when I walked past the band.

THE MENU: Lots of steaks and updated versions of steakhouse fare.  I was pleasantly surprised by the salad options and vegetarian selection available. Those options (along with the fish) seemed to compliment the light vibe of the space.

I TASTED: the little gem lettuce salad, branzino, rib cap, classic mac an cheese, mac and cheese waffle, polenta, the strip, rib eye, pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla and salted caramel ice cream.

Our group of seven ate and drank (our own wine with corkage fee) for under $600 and I thought that was reasonable. 

SERVICE: I wish I had written down our servers name---after a few glasses of wine, her name eludes me. But her kindness and responsiveness does not. I love when servers steer me toward (and away from) dishes. Every one of her suggestions was spot on. At one point I decided to make a change to my order and she was entirety accommodating. No attitude or annoyance (which she probably felt). We did spot the hostess grabbing a few bites of fries from the kitchen and that was a bit disappointing in a fine dining establishment, but it did not sully the service or our experience. 

OVERALL: Everything was tasty--the steaks and little gem lettuce salad were the standouts. The steaks were cooked perfectly with that fatty char that I like.  My primary issue with the food was that there seemed to be a small misstep with a number of the dishes. Nothing that kept me from eating (and enjoying) them, but certainly from loving them.  In short, there was just one thing about each dish that kept it from being great. For example, the bacon in the delicious gem salad (think modern wedge) was difficult to cut and made the dish a bit unwieldy.  In my eyes, an off note on an otherwise fantastic plate.  The same issue crept into the dessert dish--the caramel ice cream with chocolate flakes was delish--but there were icy flakes on the each scoop. They weren't terrible, they just took away from the refinement of the dish.

The dish that everyone was dying to taste--that mac and cheese waffle---didn't do it for me or many in our party. I'd order their luxurious polenta over it every day of the week. 

I'm not sure I'd plan to go out of my way to visit Andiron, but I would go back if I was looking for an upscale steak while visiting downtown Summerlin.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,5,4,4,O0WcpXJBTLHDcQi3Dc4WvA

I went for my birthday, in April and it was one of the most disappointing and inedible meals to date,(Almost as bad as chef Ramsey's steak, at the Paris). It was even louder then Steak too that's another story, and I thought I would never say this, but if you can't hear the people you're with it becomes very unpleasant. Also remember this if you get seated next to service table ask to be moved. They'll bump you, run in to you and not say anything. No excuse me, I'm sorry, nothing. We wouldn't have heard them anyhow. We were right next to them and they still wouldn't fill our empty glasses of wine, as I noticed them doing for others. It must have been because we brought our own wine that we like and they don't have. We like to hoard our wine for years, it just taste better.  

Know lets talk about the food.  The only reason I went here was for the Hudson valley foie gras and they didn't serve it at all. I'm sorry if you want to be a high end restaurant like they are trying so hard to be you need to keep up with your menu, online and at site. When you decide to change something, you should be ready for the change in all areas. With that said we order. I ordered the tuna tartare, it was slapped together with cut up dry globes of tuna on top of a salty smashed tater tot. It must have been a special, not so. My wife's and In Laws somehow burnt but ice cold crab cake was very forgettable. So was the rest of their meal, like their burnt steaks. Steakhouse?  Out of the four of us the only half descent plate ordered was my wife's burger with salty tots and a cup of ketchup that had a thick hard crusty glaze over it. Ketchup brûlée maybe?

Look and feel: I appreciated the restaurant style. I'm sure their patio is a fun place to be when the weather permits. The floral accents in uniforms, menu and tableware is noticeable and pretty.

Menu and presentation: The brunch menu was the perfect size; Not too many options, not to few. There was a good mix of sweet and savory. The presentation of the food had a simplistic, minimalist feel - very trendy. Who else can make fancy donuts holes look so kewl? An Instagram alley-oop. (Wish I had photos of the donuts, but only my sandwich *facepalm.*)

Taste: Although my presentation for my ham and eggs breakfast sandwich was a bit boring (plate was definitely too big), the fingerling potatoes were yummy and seasoned nicely. It came on a focaccia-type square bun (see photos) but super plain and a little overbearing to the yummy tastiness that was hiding inside. I was a little disappointed at first glance but opened the sandwich and found a treasure chest of a few more flavors. Still, as a whole, it wasn't a meal that makes me salivate or reminisce about. (Yes, I reminisce about previous meals, OK?!) 

Bonus: Although they have what looks like a fun dessert menu, there is a ""candy bar"" which includes not only candy, but other treats like cocoa-puff-krispies, brownies, sugar cookies, etc. We certainly indulged (as a table) in this bottomless bonus after our meal. It is FREE for guests which is a point you can bet we clarified with our waiter multiple times. [Playfully:] ""So... you just go and get whatever you what?"" -- ""Yes, anything you want, it's for guests."" -- ""So, free? We can go over as many times as we want?"" -- ""You can literally walk in, grab a brownie and leave, we wouldn't know."" :P

I am not dying to go back, but I would be open to it and enjoyed my experience rather than the meal during this visit. For brunchers: If you enjoy flavorquests, try something OTHER than the ham and eggs sandwich.",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,3,0,3,9yyaAhOgrduJOkA10I8kJQ
1260617,2016-06-09,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Stopped in for their restaurant week menu, and I have to say our experience left alot to be desired. 

To start we had the shrimp and the pea soup. The pea soup was just okay, but the ingredients were fresh enough and overall it was okay, I mean it's pea soup after all. The shrimp was also just okay, and the portion size was pretty small.

For mains we had the steak and the chicken. The steak was pretty good, though again the cut was on the small side, and thin. The chicken, however was a large portion, which was unfortunate because it was awful. It was served on top of some over cooked carelessly seasoned brocollini, (I say careless because for the most part it was blandly seasoned if at all, but a few bites were terribly salty) the chicken itself was cumbersome and difficult to eat, as it kept sliding around on top of the brocollini as we cut into it to eat it. The skin was burnt tasting, yet soggy, and totally under seasoned and flavorless. We barley touched this dish.

For desert we had the creme brulee donuts and the lemon tart. This was probably the best course, though the lemon tart was very sour, though tasty. The creme brulee donuts were also delicious, but the portion was tiny (two small ping pong ball sized donuts in one portion. 

This all would have been a 3.5 star experience (I really loved this place last time we were here) but it took them over 40 minutes to cash us out, which was extremely irritating. Overall it was a lackluster, expensive experience that will make us think twice about coming back.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,3,0,2,Z5sXXwTduutdzlHK7_lX7Q
1271728,2018-01-02,1,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I am so bummed to write this review. We have been wanting to try Andiron for a while and reserved a table for two for their NYE tasting. One strange thing before we even got there, you had to pay in advance for your ticket ($95.. ok, fine) AND 20% gratuity before the service even took place for a table of two. We had high expectations since they were doing this, and it ended up being a huge bust of a NYE dinner. 

We selected 9:00pm and were there right on time. One of us is a vegetarian and knowing what they put out for their tasting in advance, you still needed to remove some pieces of the dish to accommodate which is fine. Always better when restaurants accommodate a vegetarian option out the door when charging so much, but no issues. Since removing the meat in one of the appetizers, it was quite boring and plain. Crab appetizer was good, a bit bland. The main issue was the entree. Roasted Mushroom Risotto with Truffle. Sounds amazing, but was so under-seasoned we couldn't believe it. We asked for salt and it helped a little, but not much. We didn't see any mushrooms in the ""Mushroom Risotto"" so we called the waiter over assuming the kitchen made a mistake. We were then informed that the mushrooms were pureed and in the sauce. It was basically a big bowl of rice and cheese, with no mushroom or truffle taste (despite a few shavings of truffle on the top). They could have hit it with a tiny bit of truffle oil and it would have made that flavor come out no question. $95 for a burrata appetizer, cheesy risotto with no mushrooms and three donuts. 

The way they promoted the night was a DJ and dance floor and tons of fun. The gentleman at the front with a laptop playing music was ok, but it sounded like any other restaurant music through a typical music station. We ended up getting our deserts to go and were out the door well before their champagne toast. 

We wouldn't return based off the flavor profile and we definitely feel ripped off for this dinner with the courses that were served.",GvAc-axxNt817YfptzASEg,1,0,1,DqSp3OpoIzRLGckpXibRvw
1275590,2016-09-28,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I was looking for a place to celebrate my wife's birthday. Every year we try to go to a new place. Michael's Gourmet Room, Del Frisco's, etc. I wanted to try SW this year but my wife requested something ""casual"", she's not a fan of snooty tuxedoed servers :) I picked Andiron based on positive reviews but the experience was disappointing.

Cocktails: 
We've had a few Andiron martinis and Hennesy Passions. Cocktails are $14 apiece, but the execution does not warrant the price. The only highlight was blue cheese stuffed olives in the martinis.

Oysters:
Kumi oysters at $3 each were pretty fresh but still with a bit of fishy aftertaste. Champagne mignonette accompanying them was quite good.

Salmon sashimi:
Very greasy, drowning in oil. For $14 you get five minuscule thin strips of fish. Not worth it.

Lobster roll:
For $19 you get two small ""lobster salad""  sandwiches on grilled bread. Bread was tasty, lobster salad tasted like imitation crab salad. Very bland, you pretty much just taste the mayo, lobster was very chewy. Definitely not worth it.

Steak:
That was the biggest letdown from a place that calls itself a steakhouse. We got the Ribeye cap ($34), which we ordered medium. The pathetic thing that showed up was completely charred black on the outside and was still completely raw and bloody inside. The flavor/seasoning was ok. In all honesty, it should've been sent back but at that point we didn't care to bother and wanted to finish dinner and get out of there. The Andiron sauce that came with it is something of a cross between A1 and barbecue sauce, rather gross.

Kennebec Fries:
Was probably the only thing we really enjoyed. Best $7 we spent that evening. Very interesting smoky taste and the accompanying smoked tomato aioli was quite good as well.

Service: 
The waitor was friendly enough but seemed completely indifferent. Didn't bother to check up on us and most of the service was handled by bus boys. The kid that brought all the food out was a bit weird. Not rude, but he would kinda just slam the plates down. ""Salmon sashimi, it has fennel in it"". Just felt a bit weird.

We let the server know it was my wife's birthday. The fact was acknowledged but absolutely nothing was done about it. Maybe because we didn't bother ordering dessert after the very unappetizing steak.

Took forever to get the check and even longer to have it brought back. The host came by when he saw I was starting to get a little hot under the collar and explained it away with ""computer troubles"".

Overall, the vibe I got from everyone was that no one really wanted to be there.

Based on our experience I definitely will not be going back nor can I recommend the place to others. In this price range Echo and Rig in Tivoli Village is an infinitely better choice. They definitely know how to properly prepare a steak.",m10rudjEneRW-QthrAQybA,3,0,2,sn6uky-PVwLzE_KyWYQGCg

The big and I mean BIG problem is that the kitchen is so slow and by the time your food gets to you, you are one hangry jerk in a fancy restaurant. The waitstaff and managers are all very accommodating but the kitchen needs better time management.

1335830,2016-08-14,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I have been to andiron at least 10 times. 
It has been my favorite neighborhood restaurant, dethroning vintner grill and my favorite steak place. 
This was the second Friday night jazz visit. I enjoy the live music and the music genre fits the ambience. Our server was excellent. On at least one occasion in which I brought my 7 year old I was treated less than excellent. Other than that once they have been very accommodating when we have children with us. 
It's negroni month so of course my wife ordered one. I had a midnight rambler #2. It was strong and lasted almost the whole meal. 
We started with the matzoh balls. The horseradish makes them so good. I love the burn. 
We ordered the tuna off the new sashimi menu. The tuna was plentiful and fresh. I thought the accoutrements were a bit skinny. I think there are other apps that are superior. It was a toss up between that and the oysters which we had the night before at another restaurant and have had at andiron to great effect. They offer such excellent sides to the oysters. 
Pea soup was hot and thick. The cream additive is the hero.",x_ReVySYPFuyKSKve2yKPw,1,2,5,jwhgD9dE5jj-9KOscN_jAQ
1382202,2017-11-15,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"My husband and I wanted someplace new and classy so we went here for our 28th Anniversary.  It helped that we had a $60 Groupon.  I must say I really wasn't that impressed for such an expensive dinner.  Our reservation was messed up because we arrived late, but that was our fault.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for our booth (which was right in the middle of the room) and extremely noisy.  I couldn't even carry on a conversation with my husband because of the noise.  The waiter was nice enough, however, after I mentioned the Ribeye as my choice I was informed that is no longer a choice (although it is STILL) on the menu.  So my choices were go higher (New York steak) or lower (skirt steak) of course, the price on the New York steak was about $10 more.  Everything is ordered separate, so I asked if there would be enough for two to share, I was assured by the waiter there would be plenty!  The bus boy then advised us he would bring out some bread when it was done baking.  What a joke, he brought out 3 cornbread muffins that looked like they came out of the pop n fresh can.  They tasted dry and flaky.  No thanks.  The Caesar salad had a fish taste to it (anchovies?), I wasn't especially happy with and would have liked to be warned about.  The food was adequate, not great!  If not for Groupon we would never have come here and after paying $114 for two adequate dinners, we won't be coming here again.",CXTEm80fN8V2k4FuD5ub1g,0,0,3,-Oj5KlTl5LAPDEZnnm1Ccg
1403517,2015-04-14,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Restaurant was overall good, but not great and especially not great for the value.

We heard great things about this restaurant and the pictures looked phenomenal so we decided to try since we love Downtown Summerlin. The restaurant was so nice and I absolutely love how it was decorated and how the servers were attired. The servers were very friendly, but not super knowledgeable about the menu.

I ordered the moscow mule which was very good and I liked the introduction to the apple slices to the drink. Bread service came which I did not eat (passover), but other people ate it and said it was amazing. I ordered the shaved vegetable salad as my first course and it was the best item I had of the night. The cashew dressing was a perfect complement to the vegetables.

I ordered the filet with shrimp for my entree and it tasted good, but we had just gone to John Cutter and my steak was better there and for a quarter of the price. There was nothing wrong with the steak, I have just had better steak at a better value. The shrimp were tasty and seasoned well. I also liked the steak sauce that accompanied the steak.

For our sides we ordered creamed spinach, fries and a pasta type side that I did not try. The spinach was below average and was hardly creamy or cheesy. The fries were fine, but they were fries so....but they gave us an aioli ketchup that was yummy. Overall, its definitely a place to try, but not sure if I will go back. There are some interesting items on the menu that I may go back to try if I am accompanied by interesting eaters like myself, such as the bacon mazzo balls and mac n cheese waffle.",MHCerAmy_1TGc85p4Qr-5A,6,4,3,Wpq3VIkhLDpYvXIOLy2SFw

Great choices on the kid menu, booster seats and high chairs. Kid cups, free dessert for kids and ensuring our kids got their orders so quickly!! I am stunned and so happy. Meanwhile, the shrimp cocktail and cornbread was delicious!! Our meals were good as well. The sea bass melts in your mouth, and the Mac n cheese is always a table favorite.

I liked how everything came together decoratively, and the service was correspondingly professional and attentive.

Simple but solid steakhouse menu, everything was executed well: standard assortment of apps, selection of steaks and seafood, vegetarian options available. Beef tartare and roasted beet appetizers were predictable and a little underwhelming. Steak and lobster tail special ($65) was good quality with a surprisingly savory house steak sauce. Brussels sprouts and branzino (ask for extra chimmi churri) were typical and the oft-hyped mac and cheese waffle was a fun textural twist on the usual version (make sure you get the cheese sauce!), but the dessert was the surprise highlight: definitely get the peanut butter pretzel cheesecake! 

Overall, the food was good but not great. Andiron met my expectations for a good dinner, but knowing that this spot was voted the best new restaurant in Vegas for 2015 (even if it is largely a popularity a contest), I expected to be wowed... but wasn't.

EDIT: Dropping a star. Returned for brunch and service was largely absent. Our trio ordered several dishes to share and most were unremarkable. The shrimp and grits dish I ordered was pretty but barely seemed seasoned and the $10 avocado toast was flat-out boring. The dessert bar was a nice touch, but not enough to justify the prices for the quality put out for paid dishes.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,14,3,UBqOpZfo9tQ2k_XOIUUzug

Started with an earl grey champagne cocktail. Refreshing and delicious. 

The first dish up was the bacon wrapped matzo balls. Amazing!!! Sacri-licious. The matzo was perfectly cooked. Moist, soft, delicious. Served with arugula and a horseradish creme fraiche. 

The crab cake was also excellent. Soft consistency with juicy fresh crab and lots of it. No filler. Served with a cilantro sauce and a chili oil and frisée and cilantro on top. Light and fresh.  

Next was the 16 oz. NY strip. Not bad. I've had better though. The chimichurri was so so. 

Finally we had the Mac and cheese waffle. Yup. A waffle made out of Mac and cheese. Tasty but unbelievably rich. I could only eat a quarter of it. The cheese caramelized a bit in the waffle iron giving it a chewy crunchy texture. 

Finally - loved the flower theme. Hostess' dress, waiters' ties, inside the menus, wall paper, etc. Super fun.",st2QVG6cC6XOrYPCaIIdfA,1,1,4,pIRaZSxY6B3SH0EJaHue8w

I got the scallops and the grilled octopus appetizer. My bf got the hanger steak. It's definitely not horrible but also not amazing. The calamari was tender which was good but nothing special as far as flavor. My scallops were not that great. They were tender but I've had better caramelized scallops elsewhere as far as taste and quality. I personally feel that you pay for the ambience. The place is very modern looking and nice but the food was just average for us. Service was good. It's something worth trying once and not coming back for.

It was the worst french onion soup I've had in my life - there were no onions.  I'll re-type that for emphasis: No onions in the french onion soup.

I can't recommend anything on the menu, as the steaks were universally panned at our table.  The ""tater tots"" aren't really tots.  They're potatoes under an assumed name.

We really like this place, top notch dining with top notch service in a top notch location.

We ate here yesterday for Sunday brunch with a group of friends.  For Sunday brunch there's a live DJ spinning a mix of top 40, house, and pop. Walking in you're greeted with a large complimentary spread of desserts and candies. 

We ordered the donut plate to start which is a flight of 6 different seasonal inspired house made filled round donut holes. These were sooo goood! I would order two flights so you can share the goodness of each donut with another at your table. 

As a vegetarian I ordered the single vegetarian savory main dish and side options which were the Summerlin Omelette and side of Torchio Mac & Cheese. The mac and cheese was perfectly ooey and gooey and I would not change a thing. It was wonderful. The omelette was perfectly executed but very plain. Served along side breakfast potatoes, filled with a small amount of local vegetables, and topped with loose arugula, given how deliciously creative the chefs are with the rest of the menus (breakfast lunch and dinner included) I thought this plate was commonplace. I'm not as imaginative as the owners but an idea would be to include an acidic house made relish or pico.

When you first walk in, it's gorgeous. It has an open, airy, west coast vibe to it. It's modern yet classic and beautifully decorated. Everything from the menu to the waiters outfits  (gingham shirts & floral ties) is well thought out.

We started out w. beef tartar, it was okay. I LOVE beef tartar but it had way too much onion in it. If i remember correctly it also capers and an egg yolk on top as well. I was missing truffle which I usually love in tartar, also aside from the onion it was a little bland. Also the bread was COMPLETELY burned!

For the main course : My fiance had the bone in porterhouse which he liked and the Mac n cheese waffle which he said the waitress hyped up too much. I had the branzino, which I get quite often at restos. It was not bad, it lacked seasoning and flavor and wasn't as rich and oily as usual. It was underwhelming which is disappointing since I love branzino. The veggie ratatouille type thing on the side was IMO the worst part of my meal BUT the three little dots of the red pepper puree was really yummy.

The dessert was AMAZZZZZING though! The waitress (who was a little weird) recommended other things but we decided to go with the chocolate + banana one (based on the recommendation of a sweet busboy) and boy am I glad! It was unbelievably good, top 3 best desserts I've ever had. Definitely, by far, the best part of our meal.",8Bxcceze9dPzbqUUPB0otQ,0,0,3,hJTc98TZ0McWY_ICIe8oGw

Everything is A-la carte which can be very expensive.  We placed our orders after carefully reading the menu.

For example, he asked if we wanted bleu cheese crumbles on our steaks.  We all agreed, but he did not mention an upcharge.  When he suggested we get the steaks that are bone in, he did not mention the $16 price increase per steak.  When the bill came to us we were very surprised.  We dine out frequently but would not go here again.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff is courteous.

We asked for an appetizer and it never came, we asked for coffee and it never came. What did arrive was a bad ribeye that was so tough I couldn't cut it, thought at first it was a dull knife problem, but after getting a second knife, same thing. And what I also got was what looked to me like hair, but the waiter took it away and then came back stating it was ""corn silk"" and I can tell the difference between hair and corn silk, but okay. The dinner was supposed to come with mashed potatoes but what really comes on the plate is a drizzle of liquid potato that looks like a sauce underneath the broccolini and steak, and I thought it was horseradish sauce, but it actually was their idea of mashed potatoes. The waiter told us he didn't think the Sunday ribeye dinner comes with mashed potatoes, but after he went to check the menu he stated I was correct and did apologize and brought me a small side of mashed potatoes. Someone in a suit came over to our table shortly after that and apologized for something, not sure if it was the hair in the food, the fact we didn't get the appetizer, or the lack of mashed potatoes, but he said sorry and that he would make it right. I don't know what that meant since bad service continued after his statement. The waiter told us we could order anything from the bar, they had everything, so I ordered a passion fruit martini, which they didn't have the ingredients for that but the bartender improvised and made some delicious fruity drink. When I ordered a second one, it was totally different than the first, different color and it didn't taste half as good as the first one.

Short version: Wow, things have really changed at this place.  I love to seeing that our voices were heard, and for the front of house, it is night and day. This a great place to drop into in the Summerlin area.

Long version:
Decor/Atmosphere: 5/5
No real news under this section other than now I have gone back twice in the evening so no DJ (which makes complete since). I still love the aesthetics of the place. Very crisp.

Cleanliness: 5/5
In the last 2 visits, it has been absolutely spotless. One of the times was at the beginning of the dinner hour, and the other was in the thick of it.  Both times have been great.  There is no change.  You couldn't tell the amount of traffic that they were dealing with either time from the look of the place.  This time around, the placemats, flatware, stemware, etc were all clean.

Food: 4/5
We intentionally ordered the shrimp and calamari when we were invited back.  It was noticeably fresher.  Honestly, I'm always a little skeptical when invited back to a place because I feel like I'm going to get a dog and pony show (blame it on my career), so I had to order the shrimp cocktail when I went back. No show here. They really fixed it.  It was so much fresher! The standout to me is the beef wellington.  Outstanding! I wanted to do a happy dance in my seat.  My fiance ordered the NY Strip, which he said was very good.  As for the sided, the potato with mine was decadent.  The roasted peppers were perfect. The mac and cheese was okay... It wasn't bad. Just not my favorite. The brussels sprouts and chicken breast were both very good. The beignets were good but not a must have.  The espresso was great and didn't taste burned.  My old fashioned was great on both trips.

Service: 5/5
I got Brian both times.  He's fantastic!  The perfect touch of friendly and efficient. He is one of my all time favorite waiters.  Now if we could clone him or get him to teach others, we'd really be on to something.

It really is the tale of two restaurants. I was really pulling for this place because I love their other restaurants so much that I was really bummed when I had such a bad experience here.  Now, I am absolutely a fan of this place! We eat out so often that it's hard to come by here as frequently as I would like to, but I am glad that we gave this place a second chance.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,0,0,5,ArLIBm_OJYSvtNQYsKWxQw

I tried to eat around the parts I could but I was so disappointed. Then it appeared they had a lot of birthday because they kept bringing out the donut with the candle.

Last night I went to Andiron Steak and Sea at Downtown Summerlin. My best friend was in town for the holidays and had seen their Mac and Cheese waffle featured on the Food Network so we decided to try this place out.

It is located at the very far end of the shopping center towards Red Rock Casino. The restaurant had a very warm ambiance with a combination of an exposed industrial ceiling and white wooden paneling reminiscent of a cape cod lighthouse. They had upbeat rock music playing in the background,  low enough that we could enjoy our conversation. It also had an open kitchen, not too noisy. 

They started by brining us a few loafs of warm fresh baked bread. We decided to skip out on appetizers this trip. I ordered the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with crispy parsnip, basil , brown butter-pistachio pesto. Even though it was a small portion , it was extremely tasty and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly. It had just a touch of sweetness , nothing overpowering. 

My wife ordered Mary's Organic Chicken with 
Confit leg, roasted carrots, brioche stuffing , black truffle jus. The chicken was very tender and the jus gave it such a flavorful taste I didn't want to stop eating it. 

For sides we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with crispy kale , almonds and chili glaze & the Roasted Organic Mushrooms with shallot, thyme, croutons. The Brussel sprouts were delicious (not bitter like your mom used to make you eat growing up) and the roasted mushrooms were juicy and had a hint of earthiness. 

We also ordered two of The Mac & Cheese Waffles, the entire reason we came to Andiron Steak and Sea in the first place. It was a medium size round crispy waffle served with a  bechamel sauce on the side with grated cheese sprinkled in the grooves. The best way to describe it is it tasted like a very flavorful mac and cheese with a baked bread crumb topping in each bite, not just baked on top like you would get at a typical steakhouse. In all honesty, it didn't blow me away but I thought it was very unique and tasty.

Our server Kenneth was very friendly , funny and patient. The bussers made sure our drinks were always full and immediately took away any dirty plates between courses. It was getting late so we passed on dessert. They had no issue splitting the bill multiple ways. 

This is an upscale steakhouse and the prices were higher than I expected. 5 people with with a few sides, entrees and sodas came to over $200 dollars. I would definitely come back but probably for a special occasion. 

On a side note: the other people in our party ordered the Scottish Salmon , a steak and a twice baked potato . I unfortunately didn't get to try them but they throughly enjoyed themselves.

My wife and I made last-minute reservations for an early evening dinner and, once again, Andiron did not disappoint.  

Highlights:

- Perfect Sapphire martini, up with blue cheese olives and made exactly the way I like it.  My wife had a nice rosé.

- Opened with the steak tartare and grilled octopus.  Both solid dishes and that steak tartare - holy hell yes.

- Added half dozen raw oysters. Forgot the type but super fresh, briny, and plump.  Love the mignonette they serve them with.  Usually love the old-fashioned cocktail sauce/horseradish combo but I am becoming a fan of this sauce.  Perfect acidity to balance with the oyster.

- Double pork chop special for myself.  Couldn't have been cooked more perfectly than it was: a nice medium resulting in moist and tender bites.  Sweet Mother of God it was huge too.

- My wife had the surf and turf - perfectly sized ribeye and three huge prawns served scampi-style.  She enjoyed it immensely.

- We split an order of their delicious take on mac-n-cheese.

- No dessert this time cause we were about to burst at the seams.

And there you have it.  What used to be a place we only went for special occasions is now a part of our standard rotation of dining establishments in this city.

I know my answer to that question, or, it's VERY possible I am just coming up with excuses to return to Andiron. From the moment I arrived with fellow Elite Jessie B. and my 13 year old daughter, we were impressed. 
Starting with service, to decor, to the food, I was overwhelmed and amazed. 
Knowing this was the sister restaurant to Honey Salt, my bar was immediately set high. I really wanted to try every single thing on the menu. Between us, we went with a donuts sampler, the eggs benedict, the cranberry brie grilled cheese sandwich, the maple/lemon infused french toast, a side of sausage (made in house) the bloody mary bar, and our waiter Luis was kind enough to recommend  the most delicious, melt in your mouth, peanut butter cheesecake dessert that has ever existed! I promise, I would go back for that alone! Honestly, I couldn't only go back for that, when everything was truly remarkable. When the told us the maple syrup was infused into the french toast, I thought to myself, NO way. I figured it would still need additional syrup. I was SO wrong! The chefs here really put thought into every step of these dishes. 
The bloody mary bar was also unique. You had a bartender to give you your choice of vodka, from regular, citron, or peppar. They also had 4 mixes to choose from including a green one, and a spicy. So many options from multiple salt toppers like celery, lime, or Old Bay. Then things like greek olives, blue cheese stuffed olives, shrimp, bacon, and jerky! I was tempted to just stay there, all morning, and afternoon!
From start to finish, this place won me over. I have a feeling Andiron will be seeing much more of me, and I am looking forward to it.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,4,6,5,PAU-A3vtvz5uLzJtxUj8Mw

Prices were kinda high: but this is a steak and seafood place. Wouldnt really recommend the regular food here because their biggest steal is the happy hour, although I have been here for the regular food as well. 
- Jalapeno Churros: Not suggested- bland with just the taste of Spice
-Truffle Melt- Beef was overcooked and pretty expensive for a small sized burger

2) 1/2 off wines by the glass, specialty cocktails and beer

Oysters are def what I come here for and what I continue coming here for- There is never a wait as soon as I get off from work: 
1$ oysters are usually from the West Coast but it all depends on the Season because it can come from the East Coast. I particularly like this place because the Oysters are small to medium size and have light to medium salinity, although I have had some high Salinity ones.
On a good night my husband and I will come here and order and eat 40+ oysters. All Oysters are served with lemon, fresh seaweed( yes it is live cause I thought it was plastic until i broke a piece off and ate it).

If you add the lobster to your Eggs Benedict know they just put it on the plate.  It is not actually on your Benedict.  Not a big deal we were just surprised. We loved the Dessert Bar it had Bit O Honey!  My favorite candy.  Also some delicious Fruit Loop and Cocoa Puff treats.  
 
Service was extremely slow and I think there might have been some kind of mix up in the kitchen.  A party of 4 next to us who arrived and ordered after us got their food first.  Our server rarely checked back and had to be hunted down for the check and still took forever.  The young man refilling water and champagne was on his game though.  He kept us topped off and eventually got our check for us.  If you are looking for a delicious and extremely leisurely brunch this is the spot.",XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ,7,4,4,kWFb6YcwXikjUDKlj78bNg

I took this morning to have a relaxing breakfast and made the decision to try Andiron.  I will say it was a huge disappointment.  The ambience is nice and the wait staff were friendly and attentive, very nice.  The menu, I found was dull and lacked any type of flair.  Since nothing really tripped my trigger, I opted for the lobster roll, which was as exciting as a rice cake!  No flavor, no imagination, no salt or pepper on the table, no lemon or extra aioli to dip or spread.  I'll try this restaurant again for an evening meal to see if it surprises me.  Yes, I'm a food snob and I expect more from a place like this. I could have eaten at McDonald's and it would have more flavor.

2880423,2016-11-18,6,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"First off, I still don't know how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. Sadly, none of the workers said the name of the restaurant while we dined and I was too embarrassed to ask. The world may never know. 

I've been kind of bored and uninspired by the dining options at Downtown Summerlin as of late, since a lot of them fall in the 3 star or below category. Although I've heard great things about Andiron, it took me a while to make my way here. Luckily, a friend chose this place for her birthday brunch and WOW, their Sunday brunch is amazing. I highly recommend this place for a special event - the space itself is lofty, beautifully decorated and bright. Their floral motif that carries over onto their menu, plates, and wallpaper is tastefully done. 

The brunch menu was impressive - a variety of savory and sweet dishes and for your inner child, there's a treat yo' self dessert bar. When I went it was filled with Lollipops, Smarties, Spree, Gummies, Fruit Loop marshmall treats, to-die-for ginger snaps and brownies. Going in a big group has its perks! Our large group decided to share a bunch of apps and entrees so I got to taste a bit of everything, and none of the dishes disappointed. My main entree was the short rib hash and the meat was very tender and tasty. My husband has never had a Bloody Mary, but their DIY all-you-can-drink Bloody Mary bar converted him. Fellow Yelper Regina I. was a Bloody Mary genius and was able to concoct some phenomenal combinations using the plethora of alcohol, hot sauces, and garnishes that were available. They also have bottomless mimosas, with more juice combinations aside from OJ and champagne. 

As great as the food was and the service of the bartenders, hostesses, bartenders, DJ, etc., our dedicated server fell short and ruined the experience a bit for the birthday girl and the other guests who had service industry experience. I wasn't particularly upset since the atmosphere was fun. I had my back to the restaurant so I didn't see the goings on of everything, but other members of our party were commenting on the disorganized nature of the table service and how our server was handling tables far away from our table, which may have contributed to the lack of service. The rest of the table did get their alcoholic drinks way before me, but my non-alcoholic drink was forgotten and even when I reminded our server, she took awhile getting it. My entree was entered in wrong, so I had to wait bit longer as well (I was really trying to look on the positive side of things *cue Tyra Banks ""I was rooting for you""  gif). Due to a lack of carafes, the grapefruit mimosa on one  side of the table was served in a large wine glass instead. Later on in the brunch, it was never replaced with a carafe, and when our server tried to pour a glass with it, spilled some on the birthday girl and another guest. I'm sure our server was just having a bad day, the experience wouldn't deter me from coming back here and confirming how to pronounce ""Andiron"" correctly.

Pro Tip - don't use valet - you'll stuff yourself crazy with their delicious treats that you'll want/need to walk to your car after.",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,9,9,4,RrMaIgJURhZVvuUZR5yy3A

Oysters on the half shell were fresh and served with a champagne mignonette, fresh grated horseradish, cocktail sauce and hot sauce (all on the side so you can add according to your taste.) The shrimp cocktail came with some very large shrimp. The donut plate is a great choice for sharing as it comes with a variety of donuts; everyone should be able to find at least one for themselves. My chicken and waffles were right on point. The chicken was crispy and juicy, the waffles crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The ""hot honey"" syrup complemented the dish perfectly. Not too sweet and just enough spice to give it a kick without overdoing it. 

I also got the bottomless Bloody Mary, well worth it if you're going to drink at least 2 of them. You get to basically build your own Bloody Mary at the bar. You choose everything: the type of salt on the rim of your glass, the spice level of the mix, any additional hot sauce (the selection of hot sauces is HUGE) along with other condiments like celery, horseradish, bacon, homemade beef jerky, mini shrimp cocktail, peppers and more.

Located in Downtown Summerlin is where you can find this place right across the street from the Lazy Dog restaurant. It's always nice to finally check off one of the many bookmarks on your YELP and Andiron has been on my list for quite sometime. 

One of my friends wanted to treat me for a happy belated birthday brunch and let me pick the place. I have been in the mood lately for bottomless mimosas and a good breakfast so I thought to myself why not? I placed a reservation on OpenTable to ensure we would get seated in a good amount of time as I had already knew that they can get pretty busy. I received an e-mail from OpenTable after leaving stating that they marked me as a ""No-Show"" which was insane causing me to have to e-mail them back to prove I actually was there but I'll digress.... Anyways, when I arrived I couldn't help but notice how nice and clean everything looked! This place has great décor and I'm guessing on Sunday's a live DJ. 

Prior to even visiting on this particular morning I had decided to look at the menu and get a feel for what I would wanted  once I arrived. One thing for sure was that we definitely wanted our bottomless mimosas while waiting for the food! They offer a grapefruit sage that I'd be eyeing and my friend went with a traditional one.  Our order consisted of:

Avocado Toast ($10)- Tomato, Pickled Fresno Chile, Arugula grilled on wheat bread.

Chilaquiles ($19) Pulled Chicken, Avocado Cream, Queso Fresco, Sunny Side Egg.

""The Benedict"" ($16)- English Muffin, Poached Eggs, Spinach Shaved Porchetta, Breakfast Potatoes, Béarnaise

Overall the entire meal was very underwhelming and I can honestly say that it was just ""meh"" for what the prices are. I really had high hopes for this place but the glitz and glamour doesn't match the food quality I just really thought I'd be amazed. My friend also chimed in and told me that her Chilaquiles was not up to par.. With my eggs benedict they offered an option of upgrading it with Smoked Salmon for $7 extra or Butter Poached Lobster for $10. I went with the salmon because that's my favorite and I've had this same dish at other places countless times and paid way less for a better taste. My English muffin was burnt a bit underneath and the other one wasn't toasted enough.

Was it on the higher price level? Yes, but if you do not expect that from a fine dining establishment these days then head out beyond the mountains and out of the valley here.  Generally you get what you pay for.

I am just so happy that we didnt listen to the naysayers.  We had 4 different aps, 4 different main courses and two incredible deserts.  Everything was delicious and the sauces were exquisite.  We will definately be returning.

The hostess checked us in promptly and seated us at a centrally located table. The dining room decor is beautiful and has remained unchanged. Our server Ricki and his associates provided us with excellent service throughout the evening.
The three course selection from the restaurant week menu was inviting and did not disappoint. The shrimp cocktail appetizer was served with a horseradish panna cotta and a cocktail sauce on the side. When mixed together the flavor was tangy and tasty.
The entree consisted of Scottish Salmon with a Serrano ham crust along with artichokes, cipollini onions and a Peruvian chili sauce. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the Serrano ham provided a nice crunch. Desert was an Apple Tarte Tatin with sweet cider and vanilla ice cream. The desert was decadent. My wife selected the Strauss Grass Fed 8 oz filet of beef which was cooked exactly as requested. An Idaho baked potato was large enough to share and various toppings were available.

When making the reservation, I specified the special event that was being celebrated. The disappointment was that neither the hostess or the wait staff acknowledged the event.

As soon as we walked in the Hostess greeted us, and sat us down. No wait, it was great! She informed us our server would be Misho, and he quickly arrived, and introduced himself. He mentioned the wine menu numerous times even after telling him we weren't interested in drinking. After declining the wine offer for the third time he was a bit rude throughout the night. 

When it came to ordering our food he did not hesitate in giving his input. One of the guests in our party wanted a well-done steak and since Misho is also a meat connoisseur besides being a server he advised it was a terrible idea due to well-done meats being chewy, and that she ""would not like it. Trust me."" In which we've tried many steak houses, and she has yet to come across a ""chewy"" well-done steak. 

As the night progressed he rushed us in checking out, and only followed up with us once after having our meals served. The bus boy/assistant checked in on us more than our server did.

3250950,2015-07-09,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Service: We (my 5 year old and myself) walked in and was greeted by the hostess and a gentleman (possibly the manager??) in such a nice way. It can be awkward to bring a 5 year old into such a nice place... Anyway this was not the case! They both complimented her and chatted with her as if she was just another regular person. The waitstaff was the same! All were so very very nice and my glass never was empty thanks the the poor water guy who filled it at least 8 times! 

Food: although they were out of the cut of steak I had plans of ordering (which was odd because it had just opened for the day when we arrived), I ordered the New York strip. It was awesome, the delicious crunch of the char from the grill was just perfect and my steak was cooked to the perfect medium I had asked for. The shallots were delicious and sweet perfect pair for my steak! We also ordered the famous Mac and cheese waffle, need I say more?!? It was so perfectly cheesy and crisp, my moth waters just thinking about it. Anyway, we also had the donuts filled with custard for dessert. I personally usually hate custard but there was something about it that it was yummy. Not too sweet and not to liquidy, just right for the inside of a delicious donut that had sugar that was almost perfectly caramelized just outside the dough.

3264465,2018-06-03,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"The first time I came here was with my girlfriend about a year ago. We fell in love with the oysters and had a good experience overall.

The second time I came here was when my parents were in town back in November of 2017. The customer service was sub-par. This was a celebratory dinner and I recommended Andiron to my parents. After being seated, our order was not taken for approximately 30-45 minutes. Our cocktails were not refilled. After ordering, we did not receive our food for about an hour. There were people that arrived after us, finishing their meals and leaving before we even had our food. As repayment, the waitress gave us 3 tiny free donuts...

The third time I came here was for Valentine's Day with my better half. The waiter seems pretty uninterested in us. I figured it was because he was probably dealing with insanity all day for the occasion. After receiving our food, my girlfriend and I cut into our steaks only to see that they were rare. However, we both asked for ""medium."" They took our steaks away and brought them back. After cutting into them, the steaks were still rare.. The manager came over and gave us a free glass of wine as well as a free desert option as we waited for our steaks to arrive. This was a nice gesture that we appreciated. Finally, our steaks arrived the third time and after cutting into them, they were still very rare. The waiter and the manager agreed, so I knew we weren't over exaggerating. Ultimately, they comped about half of the bill, which was nice.

After a few months of avoiding the restaurant like the plague, I decided it was time to give Andiron one last shot. My Girlfriend was hesitant, but I told her they oysters would be worth it and that I had a good feeling about it. After arriving, we were sat outside and started off with some oysters. Funny enough, we had the same waiter as our Valentine's day meal. No hard feelings. I ordered the 14oz. New York Strip and mashed potatoes and my girlfriend ordered the 8oz. Skirt Steak. and mac and cheese. When our steaks arrived, we both cut into them to ensure that they were cooked medium. My girlfriend's was cooked medium and mine seemed to be close to medium near the end of the steak (I should have cut in the middle.. I blame the gin and tonics). After a few bites of my steak, I realized that it was not warm anymore and that it was closer to medium rare. For some reason. I get freaked out with anything under medium. I politely spoke to my waiter about the issue and he said that he remembered us and that he would talk to the manager. I then asked to speak to the manager so I could bring these instances to his/her attention. 

It seemed that either 1) our perception of ""medium"" and the restaurant's perception is different or 2) the chef(s) can't get it right. I shared my experiences with the manger, who stated that she was new, and she seemed receptive. However, she didn't seem troubled. I don't know about you, but if I had a customer that has had 3 really bad experiences in a row, at my steakhouse restaurant, I would be genuinely concerned and upset. Either way, she left and said she would speak with the chef. The waiter returned and said he would get us a free desert. I asked to be comped for the steak instead. He came back with our drinks comped and I leveled with him. The drinks were fine, the service was fine, the apps were solid, but the steak was not. So, I asked if I could have my steak comped. He seemed hesitant, but came back with the check and said the steak was comped.

Unfortunately, we will not be back to Andiron. I have never experienced any cooking issues like this at any other restaurant. Especially not at any other local steakhouses (Echo and Rig, Herbs and Rye, etc). I would recommend avoiding Andiron as it is not worth the risk and trouble. Thank you for reading through my novel.

3273257,2015-10-09,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Many highs and lows. Came here last night for an early birthday dinner with my mom while I'm here visiting. First off it's a beautiful spacious restaurant with lots of seating. Love the flower wall paper. Live music was nice as well. 

It was 530, so we sat in the lounge area so we could order a few items from the overtime menu (happy hour) that goes from 5-7. 

Ordered: 
Mule-made with lemon vodka here, really enjoyed it. 

Oyster shooters-tiny tiny oysters. Fresh and good, but barely any oyster! not really worth two dollars a piece. Didn't understand how to do the oyster shooter with the Bloody Mary mix on the side..ended up just sipping on the Bloody Mary mix ha. Would be willing to try the oysters on the normal menu if different than these. 

Chopped vegetable salad-good, nothing too amazing here. 

Hudson Valley Foie Gras-will start off by saying this is my first time trying Foie Gras so did not know what to expect and have nothing to compare it to. Enjoyed the combination of it with the blueberries and bread. Very rich, definitely something to share 

Mac n Cheese waffles-the star of this menu. Waiter highly recommended it. It was very delicious, but so rich. The sauce that came with it was cold so we had to send it back to be heated up. Sauce was good but no idea what it was and doesn't say anywhere on the menu

Hanger steak with creamed spinach and French fries- the steak was delicious and well cooked. My mom thought it was too salty but I did not agree. The creamed spinach was cold. Since we had already sent the sauce for the waffle back we didn't bother sending this back as well. I hate when food isn't hot or at least warm. Fries were nothing special 

Creme brûlée donuts-YUM. Loved the filling and the burnt sugar taste of the ""brûlée"" sugar on the outside of the donut. Very good. 

Service was super slow as well as some mishaps on cold food and some things just didn't wow for the price. But the steak, dessert and atmosphere were all wins.",K1s5rjAx9aYzHELp6eoyaA,2,0,3,ltHt-QrLCUd8o0wOcBzdDA

I loved the vibe inside so I was really hoping this could be our new spot. We ordered the Mac and Cheese Waffle which was super delicious! So glad we tried it out. We both ordered steak though and unfortunately we requested medium well and both received medium. VERY pink. Once we got our waiter we requested for them to cook them a tad bit more for us. Once brought back out mine was closer to being medium well, while my fiancés was still as pink as before and only burnt more so on the outside. We picked at it some more and decide to give up. We again let the waiters know the situation an they were apologetic but I did see a manager on the floor they spoke to and neither did she or the chef come to our table. When bringing out my fiancés cake they did not have the candles lit which was a tad annoying. Overall, the Mac and Cheese Waffle was the highlight of the night. Not a fan of the chef whatsoever.

3332744,2016-11-30,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"This is my final update as I have now experienced all that Andiron has to offer.  A true 5 star experience this time.  We started at the bar area for a surprisingly nice HH.  Until 7pm (very late for Vegas, they offer half off beer, wine, and specialty cocktails.  They also had $1 oysters all day on tuesdays.  The oysters were a little small but for a $11 and a great dipping sauces I can survive.  As usual, the cocktail I ordered, the Manhattan, was exceptional.  The wine selection was very nice by the glass as well.

We then sat down for dinner and ordered the appetizer, dinner, dessert option for about $40, plus a wine pairing for $10 extra.  The wine didn't really ""pair"" as we ordered two different appetizers and two different entrees and got the same white then red selections, but still for $10 and about a 4-5oz pour per meal (2 total), I thought it was a nice accompaniment.  The meal began with some fresh cornbread which was very good.  We then had the squash soup and caesar salad for appetizers, pasta and rib for dinner, and the donuts and lemon pie for dessert.  We also added brussel sprouts as a side, which although perhaps the best part of the meal, was overkill as the portion sizes are solid without ordering another side.  The salad was good, not great, but the squash soup was very nice and creamy; great for dipping.  Both entrees were quite good with nice sauces and big portions.  The desserts, especially the lemon pie, were outstanding.  The meal ended with a complimentary tart which was the best dessert of the 3 and just too small as it left me wanting more.

You will be thoroughly content and full after this meal.  Especially for the price, you can't go wrong with this tasting option as many of the dishes I was going to order anyways were options here.  Our only issue with the dinner was that we didn't want dessert but were unable to maneuver around the meal and either remove a dessert and add an appetizer, or upgrade an entree.

I got the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken has zero seasoning and tastes like burnt flour. So bad I returned it for steak and eggs and it was not much better.

Our server, Jose was super nice and accommodating. I wasn't happy with the steak sauce and instead of asking me which one I would like instead, he brought out a sample of all of them. Now that is true customer service. 

Lobster rolls are usually under seasoned to let the lobster flavor shine but I've always disagreed with anything bland. Here they seasoned it very well so it was great! We also had the octopus which was cooked perfectly tender and had the right amount of char. For the entree's we had the branzino and rib eye. The fish was cooked and deboned perfectly. It's not often where I don't find a single bone in fish that I order. The rib eye was also cooked perfectly medium rare. You have no idea how many steakhouses cannot get the temperature of their steak right. I was just at Echo and Rig few days ago and the steak was raw in the center when I asked for medium rare. I sent it back and when it came back only half of it was medium rare. The other half was still raw. Anyway, needless to say I have really happy when my steak came out perfectly medium rare. Out of all the sauces, peppercorn was my favorite.

We finished with the creme brûlée donuts. It had the perfect crunch on the outside and creamy filling on the inside.

3455182,2015-07-13,5,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"This review is for their 2015 Las Vegas Restaurant Week menu.

Of course, it's necessary that a high-end shopping center such as Downtown Summerlin has its own steakhouse. The menus take a spin on classic, familiar favorites and isn't limited to steak and seafood. 

Although not on the three-course Restaurant Week menu, I had to try the Hudson Valley Seared Foie Gras. Nestled upon toasted brioche with streaks of huckleberry jam on either side, this immediately became a hit at the table. 

For my first course I ordered the Andiron Caesar. It's your basic Caesar, but then again it isn't. The salad was lightly dressed and accented with whole wheat croutons and large flakes of parmesan cheese. My boyfriend chose the Old Bay Shrimp Cocktail. Andiron's take on the traditional 99¢ shrimp cocktail that you could probably still find in older downtown casinos. Two fresh, jumbo size shrimp accompanied by horseradish cocktail sauce to give your taste buds a bit of a zing. 

I ordered the Scottish Salmon for my second course, mainly for its serrano ham crust. The meat was flaky and the artichokes accompanied the fish nicely. Cooked at medium-rare, my boyfriend's rib eye cap was delicious and tender.

We finished off dinner with a third course of dessert. After devouring one of Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts, I'm convinced that this is *the* dessert that everyone has to order while here; it was basically the highlight of dinner. The donuts are filled with vanilla custard that just oozes out after one bite. To my surprise, these weren't dense. The donuts overshadow the Almond Cherry Clafoutis, dessert two. Now this one was dense and flan-like. Despite a small serving of sweet vanilla ice cream, this didn't win me over. 

Dinner was wonderful, and the service was excellent. As a local, this is one neighborhood steakhouse that I wouldn't remind returning to again.",epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg,4,4,4,mJPbgsDwI227dAmYaSlGZg

What made me go here ? For brunchhhhh duh. As if you didn't already know how obsessed I am (see other reviews).

The service is without a doubt attentive, quick, efficient and pleasant! We had a group of 6 and our glasses never went empty. They have several mixers for your champagne: cranberry, raspberry, orange and pineapple. 

I can't even formulate my thoughts to describe how amazing our experience was at this place. The decor, the food!! The food (silently drools) 6 orders and nothing amiss! Steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare), chicken and waffles was great. Another person ordered shrimp and grits and couldn't stop raving about how happy they were over this choice. I can't really remember the other orders but no one was disappointed. We also ordered some shareables. The donut plate which I thought would be mini donuts but they were more like donut holes, still delicious though. The lobster roll was fresh and perfectly seasoned.

Unfortunately last nights dinner fell far short of the mark.  We started with the seafood tower which was perfectly fine by Las Vegas standards but nothing too exciting.  We then moved onto the steak tartar and the sea urchin toast.  Both were good, the tartar lacked flavor and the toast served with it was grilled and burned which distracted from the flavor.  The sea urchin was very good and I would order again.  
The disaster came with the main course.  I ordered the bone in dry aged NY Strip.  The first one arrived at medium well. I of course returned the steak and when the second came it was cooked correctly to medium rare, but the meat has absolutely no flavor at all and was inedible.  The manager was apologetic and stated they needed to find a new purveyor for their meat! Shocking this was not dialed in before opening! The owners Elizabeth and Kim were not in attendance and you could see the difference from when they opened Honey Salt.  Maybe they have grow too fast, I know the Manager was with another unhappy guest before speaking with us. The room is beautiful and well appointed but the service and more importantly the food is lacking. I cannot recommend this restaurant and think they should remove the ""steak"" from the name Andiron Steak and Sea!",ukg0kXFqhfvqSFyWP2V2tA,3,1,2,eVsbMWgzfICaYCfhmfQqgw

We skipped appetizers and ordered the 8 oz rib eye cap (I added 2 shrimp scampi)  20 oz bone in rib eye, mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and creamed spinach. I ordered my steak well done, as a I always do. I asked if the kitchen would have a problem making it and was assured absolutely not. My steak came out, medium. Lots and lots of pink and lots of blood. That is NOT how I eat my steak. UGH. So I have to send that back. I also have to ask where my shrimp are. I'd like to eat those now while I wait for my steak. Apparently they forgot them, so they came out a few minutes later. One was warm, but cooked. The other was cool and waaaaaay under. OMG, are you serious? Now I have NO steak and no shrimp? The mashed potatoes were not yukon and were runny. Not deliciously creamy as you'd expect. The spinach was good. The asparagus were OK. The manager comp'd us dessert for the steak incident, and they did bring out 3 pipin hot fresh made shrimp after I returned the first one. The creme brulee donuts were SOOOOOO GOOD! Absolutely the best part of my meal. My fiancee enjoyed his medium steak, ate it all! Me, not so much. 
Our waiter was fantastic! Vincent I believe. Friendly, funny, helpful. He seemed upset that my steak wasn't cooked properly, he wasn't sure either how you can NOT cook a well done steak? 
In the end, this isn't a place I would come back to.

We both had salads and I think they were overall pretty good.

Entree. This place says they have great steaks and charge accordingly. I ordered a NY strip. When it came out it looked sad. Not the kind of strip steak one expects at a place like this. Thin, no nice crust and not much flavor. Quite honestly Outback would have done better. The fingerling potatoes? Overcooked. The Mac as a side. Average.

The steak was substandard vs what they promote. Rather disappointing.

The dessert was good.

3517343,2015-12-03,4,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I'm finally getting around to posting a review for Andiron. I made a couple visits during the summer and with the executive chef changes (opening chef Joe Zanelli left, Brett Uniss entered and soon departed, and now Micah Waltz leads the kitchen) some dishes I tried are no longer served. Their menu had a mix of traditional steakhouse fare like a steak tartare full of capers, bonded with mustard, and topped with an egg and more modern items such as an artfully plated, refreshingly light yellowtail crudo with preserved kumquats. The burrata and grilled fig made for a decent appetizer too, with the creaminess of the cheese, sweetness of the figs and acidity of tomatoes melding beautifully.

Steaks are as good as you'll find off the Strip. The Creekstone Farms bone in rib eye was nicely charred. It's dark exterior glistening with butter and topped with mushrooms. Simply plated on a white dish with a small side of house made steak sauce with notes of tang and spice. It was a good sauce but not needed. The Strauss grass fed filet was just as good. Cooked to a medium rare as ordered and very tender and lean. I didn't care of the peppers on top of the peppercorn sauce. Again, the steak was good enough to eat without it. The addition of Alaskan king crabs came out to about 2.5 legs worth of crustacean.

Side dishes were a mixed bag. Creamed spinach was too soupy for my liking, while the creamy and rich risotto with white truffles was excellent.

Ending the meals were two desserts. The first was a warm pecan carrot cake, similar to a muffin topped with candied carrot, sitting in a pool of bourbon cream cheese with pineapple currant  compote running alongside it. It was a solid rendition, but light on the spice and carrots of a traditional carrot cake. The second dessert was a disappointing warm chocolate pudding cake that was too dense and thick.

Everything about this restaurant is well calculated -- from the dishes on the menu to the floral pattern found throughout. While the execution isn't always perfect, the net result is one of the better steakhouses found off the Strip.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,6,4,b7Bfpf9XIQ7MfGSgavPWiQ
3526238,2015-07-27,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I really, really wanted to like this place. We plunk down some serious change eating steak around town, so having a new one open close to us was exciting. I'll cut to the chase. 

Wine - good wine selection. Unfortunately they were out of the bottle I wanted. We ended up ordering by the glass. 
Lobster salad - generous portion of lobster with the salad. Tasty
Sides - carrots were delicious. Asparagus was asparagus. Tots were not tots, just potato squares. Waffle Mac and cheese was sinfully good. 
Desserts - key lime pie was okay. The donuts were awesome. 

The main event:
Filet - I ordered it medium rare and it came out medium to medium well. I hate being in an awkward position of having to send food back, especially because we were dining with another couple. Plus, they were out of the bottle of wine I wanted earlier so I already felt like we were swinging and missing. 

If this weren't a steak place, I'd give them 3.5/4 stars. But you're a fancy steak place. I know, why didn't I just send my steak back for a new one? Like I said, I just hate doing that so long as it's edible. My husband traded halves with me and his medium rare steak was on point. However it wasn't anything out of this world to die for. 

I'm glad we at least gave Andiron a whirl. I'd happily go back and order bites at the bar, but for local steak, we will stick with our faves of Echo and Rig and T-Bones. Sorry Andiron. :(",zJM2JPFDafXxBRj90r1Klg,7,2,3,DroI63e5341flFEn2bjkNw

5 of us dined at Andiron on Saturday. I had the pork schnitzel which was delicious. This was served on a bed of cranberry sauce with a side of cous cous. Also, the Mac n Chz waffle waffle was to die for. My friends all had steak and all seemed happy with their selections. 
Now for the service.... First, we were greeted and offered our choice of bottled water or ""filtered water which is unlimited at $4 for the entire table.""  Gimme a break!!!!  This was very insulting as to say ""who on earth would opt for the free Las Vegas water straight from the tap. 
Anyway, after settling for the regular tap water it was apparent that it wasn't bottomless as never were we offered a refill.

3684749,2016-04-10,1,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"There seems to be a trend in Hometown Vegas (this is what I like to call the area that is not the Strip or Downtown tourist spaces ... where Vegas residents actually live and play), especially around Summerlin/Peccole Ranch area, where hip new restaurants pop up and momentarily become the hotspot for the trendy crowd.  And AS&S seems priced to take advantage of this ...

My wife and I were looking for a nice dining experience and we'd heard this place was from the makers of Honey Salt (a place I haven't reviewed here but we absolutely love!).

First, the best part of our evening was by the Service and the atmosphere.  Our waiter and supporting staff were super friendly and timely all night.  This is a crew that clearly has the chops to handle the high maintenance fine dining crowd, but were down-to-earth enough to put up with the likes of me.  And just like Honey Salt, they nailed it on making a visually stunning and very comfortable restaurant.

The food was also very good.  I had the Dry Aged 12 oz Rib Eye to which I added the Wood Grilled Shrimp.  My wife had the Prime Angus FlatIron and added the truffle compound butter.  We shared sides of asparagus and the mac&cheese waffle because ... well ... because Mac&Cheese Waffle!!  Everything was prepared well and tasted good.  The truffle compound butter was very good!  There was almost nothing disappointing about this meal ... 

Almost ... 

My sole complaint and reason for the 3 Stars is simply value.  If you are going to drop $200 on dinner and cocktails for two, you want to come way feeling like the food and experience were on par with the price.  The steaks, while good, were not quite at the level you'd expect to justify the $30 price tag.  The add-ons also seemed overpriced and underwhelming.  I don't count myself among those who get any personal benefit out of paying a premium for the sake of being seen paying a premium, so whatever additional value was supposed to be there for this price was definitely missing.",H-Pzp3IK_mfhQaIh9IKHvg,4,1,3,RkhzIU7CZV_Mf0FY0uVIXA

I have eaten here twice now.  This is a very fancy restaurant in the new Downtown Summerlin complex.  It's like birthday dinner/anniversary dinner expensive; it's not really just for a Saturday night date.  It is a SPECIAL place.

The first time I went, my husband and I got a bunch of little small plates and shared them to try them out.  The one thing I noticed about many of the dishes was the overwhelming taste of horseradish.  It was in THREE of our dishes.  Now, I like horseradish, so I didn't mind, but I will say there was a LOT of it.  Here's what we got:
- The bread at this restaurant apparently changes often.  The day we went, it was a pop-over (I think that's what it was called).  It was like this huge cloud that was completely airy in the middle.  This is a horrible description of what it looks like, but I can't seem to describe it correctly!  It came with a horseradish-y butter.
- Half dozen oysters that came with a shallot-y red wine vinaigrette sauce.  Tasty little buggers and nicely sized.
- Steak tartare.  This was one of the dishes with the horseradish.  Beautifully presented with a quail egg in the middle.  The meat was cut into nice sized chunks so you could really get a good texture to it.
- The wedge salad.  The bacon on this thing was out-of-this-world good.  It was the thickest, juiciest bacon I may have ever eaten.  Surprisingly, with all the horseradish in the other dishes, the bleu cheese dressing on this salad had none that I could taste!  Huh, that's where I would expect some horseradish.
- Bacon-wrapped matzo balls.  I was most excited by this app when we ordered, but it ended up being my least favorite of the night.  There was something about the matzo balls' texture that just seemed a little off to me, and I didn't think the cream sauce that came with it (read: horseradish) went well with the app.
- Farro risotto.  Nicely nutty farro.  There were dates in this dish, so every now and then, I'd be like, ""Ohhhh, there's something sweet in here!  I've got to eat another bite!"" because it was so surprising.

The second time I went by myself because I couldn't stop thinking about this Santa Barbara Seafood Pot that I had seen on the menu the first time.  And it was delightful.  A mixture of shrimp, rock fish, mussels, clams, and the most perfect scallops.  The broth was flavorful, and the crusty bread was perfect for dipping.

A side note to end the review: the wallpaper, menus, bread plates, and even the ties that the servers wear all have the same floral print.  It is a neat little element that just ties the whole restaurant together.  Andiron is a fabulous addition to Summerlin!",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,9,8,5,Q_bW6uoA-rwnJ6O1nrtAUw

Food:

Calamari - nothing special but the aioli gave it life 

The power lunch had a 3-course option and comes all together, which is great for someone rushing for work but wants a decent lunch. I had mixed feelings about that because I didn't want my steak to get cold while I was eating my soup. 

Anyways, I picked the carrot soup, petit filet served with seasonal veggies  and creme brûlée donut. 

I was concerned when it said Petit Filet lol but it was a decent size. They did a good job seasoning the filet, I didn't need a sauce!

I had high expectations because honestly, you can't help to have high expectations when you walk into this sophisticated restaurant and glance at the menu. The prices are on the high side - $20 for a burger?! $8-10 for sides? The food must be amazing, right?

First off, service was horrible. We had at least three different waiters and every time we needed something, we kept looking around for someone because we had no idea who our waiter was. After we were done eating, it took forever to get our check!! We sat at an empty clean table for at least 10 minutes until someone dropped our check to us. 

Hubby and I decided to order the short rib hash and the donut plate, which consisted of five different flavor donut holes. I give five stars on presentation for the food and ambiance, but in terms of the taste - bland and mediocre. The worst was the donut plate! It looked so good and when I took one bite from one of the donut holes, it tasted like an old, dry classic donut from the grocery store. I thought it maybe it was just that one donut hole, so I tried another. Same taste - tasted like nothing but blah. Then I tried another one and I took one bite and tasted like the last two so I stopped eating the donuts. 

The short rib hash was better than the donut hole as I took more than 3 bites, but it wasn't anything special. My friend ordered the $20 burger and his face said it all - not good. Our bill was $30 for the donuts and hash plate, and definitely not worth it. 
We also indulged in the free candy bar in front because it looked so pretty. I took a Cap'n Crunch rice krispy treat, took one bite and threw it away.

Service was attentive and pleasant. The bartender was gracious and personable. The server was informative and helpful.

We have been here several times before and enjoyed the variety of options. Unfortunately, upon being seated we were informed that there was an entirely different menu prior to 8:30pm. The holiday menu required pre purchasing a ""ticket"", which was not noted anywhere on the menu link (although all other details were listed including the price). Had we known this, we certainly would have purchased tickets and were very disappointed at the uninspired menu available to the rest of us...chicken, pasta,...blah. Our server really tried help by offering a fish dish that wasn't on the early menu but nothing from the holiday menu. Atmosphere was festive but as we were wrapping up, it was clear that they were setting up for the ""ticketed"" crowd and the rest of us were just filler. (We didn't even have a tablecloth, just placemats like it's was brunch or something.) Dinner was nice but otherwise not memorable, even for a regular night.

3970146,2015-04-04,6,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I had a 7:45 reservation and I arrived about 5 minutes early.  I was able to sit in the coveted ""private dining room"" which in fact for me was the patio area.  I was the only one who wanted to sit out on a very pleasant night when the wind had stopped and the temperature was pleasant.

Service started quickly and remained top notch throughout the entire evening.  I ordered an iced tea and it was brought with a small shaker bottle of simple syrup.

My order included French onion soup for the appetizer, the 9 ounce Wagyu skirt steak with foie gras addition for the main course accompanied by their Mac & Cheese waffle.  For dessert, I ordered the crème brûlée doughnuts.

It seemed like a long wait for the onion soup but I was enjoying the beautiful evening and the people watching the patio afforded.  I could hear the music from inside and the patio proved the golden place to sit this night.

The onion soup was brought and it was well worth the wait.  The rich broth with sliced onions and topped with gruyère and parmesan cheeses was very good.  Shortly after the soup was brought, a server asked if I wanted some bread.  I asked for some but asked for a small amount--not a full portion.  I was brought two end pieces of wonderful bread with butter that was topped with some black salt crystals.  It was excellent.  The butter had softened from the warm bread and spread beautifully.

I had asked for my steak to be as rare as possible, a difficult request for skirt steak because of the lack of thickness to this cut.  It was done perfectly.  It was accompanied by a glazed shallot and some chimichurri sauce in a small gravy boat type container.  On the side were three pieces of the mac & cheese waffle and the one server urged me to eat the waffle while it was hot.

This cut of steak is known for its flavor and it was very good.  It was tender and moist.  The foie gras was outstanding.  That was the first thing I ate, and I savored every piece.  The mac and cheese waffles were served with the same type of small gravy boat but with a cheese sauce.  Altogether, the waffles, the foie gras, and the steak made for an outstanding main course.  

Room for dessert--of course.  Well, I did leave one waffle, but the server had been correct about eating these while hot.  It lost a little something as the waffle cooled somewhat.  My server told me about a special sorbet for that evening but I had to go with the crème brûlée doughnuts.  It was the right choice to make.  These are doughnut holes filled with vanilla custard and they are so good.  None of the three was left.

Service throughout the night was excellent.  My main server, Keith, accompanied by his co-server Lewis, made sure that my iced tea glass was always filled.  It seemed like several of the servers from inside, when they stepped out for a quick breath of fresh air, stopped by to check on me.  

Two hours later, I left having enjoyed the private dining room and filled with good food.  Prices are on the high side--Downtown Summerlin pricing--but I knew this going in so there's no complaint about that.  It was a very good dinner with excellent service in very enjoyable surroundings.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,19,14,4,4M3rrbEZ8KRo9IT2TFrPiw

Tonight's dinner was a amazing experience, that is the primary reason people go out to dine, right. The Experience and Good Food n Wine. 
All three categories, Andiron Steak & Sea hits the bulls eye. 
From the ever start, a warm welcome greets you into amazing appointed restaurant, with chic bar area on your right and dinning straight up. As we were seated our server promptly and politely introduced himself and showcased their specials. We were in a mood for seafood, so he recommended the perfect balance meal for two of us.
My wife ordered the white fish (similar of Bass) and I orders the salmon with smoked asparagus for sides. To share, appetizers, our server recommended nueske bacon wrapped matzo balls which was accompanied with corn bread. 
One by one our food was being served, in a timely manner.
Bacon wrapped matzo balls, were just perfect, well backed inside with crispy bacon wrapped around. We cleaned it out in 5 mins tops. I wanted to order a second portion, but my wife said we must wait for the entree. And boy she was right. 
The salmon was one of the finest I have had in Las Vegas, well presented crispy top garnished with crackling onions and herbs supported with artichokes. Wow, Chef had done a spectacular   job, it was divine. My wife, dish was better, according to here. Both to were very distinct flavors, perfectly done and well presented. All this with polite service and ambience that is chic and royal in a way.
Andiron steak and sea, will be our top five Las Vegas restaurant defiently the best outside the strip. We will be back and I recommend this location to not only locals but tourist too. 
Only one word of caution, it is a busy spot so book in advance, tonight it was a full house. I have experience why. Good work by the team at Andiron Streak n Sea",7q1EFKcjUTQhUrmjY2ZRkw,2,2,5,4iYF_uVARkn6CYXNfdkXpw

4052847,2018-03-01,5,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Andiron Steak & Sea (Downtown Summerlin / Las Vegas)

You know when Yelpers start off a review with ""I really wanted to love this place"".  You know what's coming up next...their disappointment.  But first off, the food is pretty good.  I have tried the burger & fries, pigs in a blank, the donut flight, the bacon jalapeno churros, the Summerlin omelet, the thick cut bacon, and the now deceased waffle mac n' cheese.  The only issue with the food is the small portions and big price tag.  My favorite is the thick cut bacon.  This single piece of bacon is about the size of a typical tenderloin. If a high calorie fatty dish is what you're looking for, then this is it.  This is a dish worth having.  Like I stated earlier, the food is pretty good.  It's the service that needs improvements.  On our last visit, we waited a very long time for our orders to be taken and an even longer time for the food to be served. I recommend ordering extra water because it's going to take a while for your refill.  During this time, we didn't have a single employee check on us.  As for the check, yes that took a long time too.  I think 3 stars would be a very fair review.  Good food and poor service equals an ""A-Ok"" experience at Andiron.  However, finding hair in the food is enough to drop them one more star.  My overall thoughts...I really wanted to love this place.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,8,2,Tcf4PBvDh0z77mu3sRM32g
4057765,2015-05-12,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Although I am not a fan of Honey Salt, I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of this steak and seafood establishment.  It was worth the wait.  Attention to detail is important.  Andiron gets it right down to the very last detail.  When you walk in, you feel you are transported to the veranda of a rich, Southern debutante.  It's all sandalwood, flowing, gauzy drapes, and has a beautiful open kitchen that manages to be interesting without making the noise volume unbearable.  

Our incredible dinner started off right with oysters and steak tartare.  Both were great, but our server's recommendation to try the tartare was spot on.  It had a spicy kick that we all loved.  We had a variety of steaks and all were very good.  By far, everyone's favorite was the mac n cheese waffle.  I am not a lover of mac n cheese, but this waffle creation is nothing short of amazing.  My biggest mac n cheese complaint is the texture.  With a mac n cheese waffle, it's crunchy and cheesy all at that same time.  At the same time! Genius!  For dessert, we put a world of hurt on two slices of brown butter lemon pie.  

I have so many wonderful things to say about this place, I could write a novella.  Suffice it to say, this is an awesome addition to the Summerlin dining scene.  Be prepared to spend some $$$.  Perfection does not come cheap.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,7,7,5,E8M51sQcC3QNrV1IjiCk1Q

4093222,2015-06-13,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I dined at Andiron on June 06 with some of my friends. The atmosphere and decor are amazing. The acoustics are also much better than some of the other fine dinning close to the area. It was nice to actually go out and be able to hear the conversations happening across the table. Silvia was our waitress and she was pretty good. Very sweet and soft spoken. Majority of the food was excellent, my only complaint was that the ice tea was literally the same color as water. It was so diluted it was sad for a tea drinker and I found the yellow tail to be a bit embarrassing. She had recommended that for an appetizer and I was blown away at how little the pieces were. It comes with 8 pieces, which sounds good if you are used to eating sashimi, but in reality it was two pieces of yellowtail cut into 8. If you want to serve the tiniest little pieces of yellow tail in town that is fine, but you should serve it on a smaller plate so that it is less noticeable. I literally took a picture of it to send to a friend because it was laughable. The mac and cheese waffle was a little too salty and not a great as I had hoped but it was still a cool idea. I had the scallops and they were incredible. I would recommend them to anyone. The meal was a tad expensive, which I had anticipated but there are other places in town that are better for the money (Honey salt, Marche bacchus). We all had a good experience and I think all but one really enjoyed their meal (she had the halibut). I would come back again.",Xk2o0GKqhsm90XZSqI4lGg,0,0,4,E3uh3u3EAqDk0brncdScPg
4106944,2016-06-08,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"We have been really looking forward to coming here and have been excited about the Mac n cheese waffle. So from the start we were a party of 5 with 2 kids in our party. When we were seated first off it was a table that could fit 10 people which was very awkward our reso was put in 3 hours prior so their was plenty of time to
Prep a good table that would work for that size of our party on a Tuesday night(6/7/16). We came for the restaurant week prefix menu. To start off we ordered regular water I requested lemons for my water. These were not even brought till I was staring at one of the managers and he asked how everything was going and I asked for some lemons if he could because we saw our actual server a total of 3 times throughout the whole dining experience server was Jennifer. My wife and mother in law came in planning on ordering the mushroom pasta which, was on the restaurant week menu online. This should have been honored or something comparable rather than the excuse of we don't have that product so we can't make it. She responded this way without asking any Manager or Chef which, in every steakhouse and club I've ever managed would've been unacceptable if my staff did that. Next was the kids menu which, it states that the drink and desert were included with the meal. I did not know this which I was the one who paid but, my wife had went through the menu with our son. He had 2 drinks and we were charged for both of them. To me it's not about the dollar amount it's the principal and inconsistency of this restaurant. I haven't even touched on the fact that I ordered the Rib eye prefix meal which, I asked to be prepped at medium temp due to knowing rib eye is a fattier meat and you want that fat to liquify. Well it was medium-rare and very fatty. My sons kids meal which, the server said ""the burger would be cooked well done would that be okay"" I said of course yes please because it's a burger. Well the burger arrived 10 minutes before our food which is not an issue but, the burgers temp was a rare temperature no where near a well done temp. For the burger being $21 it should've been the best cooked burger ever to hit a grill. This place is far from the level they should be at. I think the owners and management need to focus more on the customer experience and good quality because it fell very short. I am seeing a major pattern between this restaurant and Honey Salt which, we went to about a month ago and I tipped the server assistant directly due to her busting her tale and the server just had a bad attitude and spent more time with one table with one touch than she did through our entire dinner. You need to get someone in these restaurants who knows how to train and knows how to serve themselves because these 2 restaurants have managers more concerned about the color of their tie rather than what's going on with the customer experience. To improve the customer experience it's not just asking every table how is everything because, you will get the same answer from every table especially when you can hear what the manager asked the table next to us(This is how Red Lobster trains FOH managers). It doesn't create a unique way to truly get proactive guest responses nor does it make the restaurant goer feel special. I feel these restaurants are lacking this key piece in the niche market they are in. It seemed like such a burden on the managers at both of these restaurants. Obviously me writing this long review was probably a big waste of time but, I want local restaurants to succeed not fail or continue to make the same mistakes. My final grade for now ""Needs major improvement"". The 2 stars are for location and the interior of the restaurant. The experience needs to be revamped from walking in to restaurant to leaving the restaurant which, can be fixed easily you just need the whole team to buy into this philosophy. Good luck and hope to see/hear major improvements in the near future.",Ni-OwsMtwmeOSib8n7TszA,1,0,2,3ejqTj7Oda7Uc4Xk_4boHw

Quick advice is plan to come right at 10:00am on Sunday or book a reservation through Open Table as this place filled to capacity within 20-25 minutes!  I know why now because the entire experience is uh-mazing!!

Positives
1) Brunch menu is out of this world!  I recommend the breakfast nachos, shrimp & grits, chicken & waffles, and Eggs Benedict!  We also shared the blueberry pancakes and they were outstanding as well.
2) Bottomless Mimosas for $17!  They have 4 different varieties including traditional, grapefruit, citrus, and cranberry!  Try all of them, you won't be disappointed but will need a designated driver!  There's always Uber/Lyft!
3) Bottomless Bloody Mary bar for $20!  You get to build your own Bloody Mary with a wide selection of ingredients and spices.  Doesn't get much better than that!
4) Atmosphere and decor are top class.  They even had a DJ playing music the Sunday we visited.  Nice touch!
5) Service was simply World Class!  The service you would expect from a 5-Star restaurant or high end steakhouse, you get that!

Negatives
1) It's a tad pricey but I think it's worth every penny.  You can checkout their menu online before you go so you have an idea of what the meal will cost you.  Don't let the prices deter you; the food and service is exceptional!
2) Parking can be limited so plan to arrive early enough to park behind the restaurant on the back end of the mall.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,0,0,5,w18FTKRcDmuHWI0FKazWzQ

The drink was super strong so if you aren't a heavy drinker like me, this drink will knock you out but I shared it with my husband luckily. The lobster roll came out first and it was good but filled with lots of onions (yuck) and celery so that wasn't my favorite. The creme brûlée French toast wasn't overly sweet at all and I didn't need syrup. It was on thick bread so it didn't get soggy which is how French toast should be anyways! I highly enjoyed it.

I had a glass of Brancott Sauvignon Blanc that was perfect. Brian my server was swamped with 2 large parties so it was difficult for him to give timely service. Overall very good.

I like the open interior, but it can get very loud inside from the hard surfaces.  We will be back.  Everything was good except the truffle fries, but just don't order those.  The only part that I don't like is that when they have oyster bar or some seafood night, the fish/oyster smell when you walk in is very strong and not appetizing.

This is my favorite restaurant in the city because the price for Vegas is probably 10% cheaper than the strip but the food is just as good, if not better! The service, who I just recently had Vinny as our server, is the best. They let you DINE here, allow you to drink your cocktail and eat your app before rushing you into the next course. And the best of all is that they do not clear the table until all are finished with the course, that's such a great and professional touch to me. The Sommeliers are wonderful because if they don't have the bottle of wine you ordered, they immediately bring you comparable bottles but allow you to keep the same price as the bottle before.

Ordered:
-Cornbread and butter (complimentary) 5/5 stars 
One of the best cornbread I've ever had. It was warm and sweet and the butter set it over the top! 
 
-Lobster Rolls: 5/5 stars
My boyfriend said it was the best lobster he ever had and he's from San Francisco. (sorry I don't eat seafood to give my personal opinion)

Fried Chicken Bao Buns 4/5 stars
It was crispy and tender but kinda dry. If there was more sauce it would've been a 5 star. 

Cowboy Rib-eye 4/5
Meat was tender and flavorful. We asked for medium and it was more medium rare. 

Mac & Cheese 4/5

To start our meal we shared Avocado Toast as well as Burrata & Figs. The shareables were my favorite part of the meal with both being very good. The Avocado Toast was simple, but fresh and delicious. There were four pieces which was a nice serving for sharing. The Burrata & Figs was also very fresh and had a delicious combination of ingredients. The burrata was creamy and delicious on the persimmon and pear slices. I would definitely order this again. 

Since one of their specialties is steak I decided to order the Chef's Cut Steak & Eggs. There wasn't anything wrong with this dish, but it wasn't anything special either. It was similar to what I'd expect if I ordered this from a chain breakfast spot. The steak was nicely flavored, but not overly tender. The eggs were prepared as requested and the potatoes were lightly seasoned. My friend's Chilaquiles looked great so I may return in the future to try something else.

The head chef is German and was automatically in love with the fact that they have Spätzle on the menu.  Not a fan of this by anyone at our table,  it is something that I have grown to love and appreciate.  Although it is just an appetizer, it's worthy I would think of something to have to share....although many other impressive appetizers.  The filet was perfect although they do not have Béarnaise sauce that if its something that one comes accustomed to having with their filets, it may be hard to not sigh deeply in disapproval.  I got over it and by no means a deal breaker....Apparently the Moscow Mules are a hit,  but stuck with their Malbec they offered by the glass.  Meh...good, but I see why it's the one they offer by the glass.  Ultimately this place is something straight out of Scottsdale which is always a plus.

The Mac & cheese waffle was cold and dried out and barely cheesy - the staff told me I was supposed to pour the extra cheese sauce in it to make it creamy. It was served like a breakfast waffle, uncut, on an ugly blue plate. Seriously unappetizing. 

The bacon wrapped matzoh balls were equally ""off""... Very salty and the horseradish crème fraiche only helped a little. The best part of our meal was the asparagus, cooked just right, on what I believe was supposed to be a romesco sauce was more like a red pepper paste... A serious disappointment.

Unfortunately it let us down in the most critical area- the quality of the steaks.  I ordered the dry aged prime ribeye and my wife ordered the Waygu Tritip- recommended by our waitress as being very tender.  We ordered them medium, after being informed that would be more like medium rare.  We also got their Caesar salad and double stuffed potato.

The salad and potato were very good.  Both of our steaks were tough by any reasonable standard, and my wife's was delivered quite rare.  We sent my wife's back to get it cooked to medium.  My ribeye was a surprisingly thin cut, but cooked properly- yet still tough.  When my wife's was finally brought back, it was properly cooked but very tough.

It should be noted that the service was very good.

My wife posted a review on TripAdvisor.  The next day, a managing partner sent her a message in which he apologized, and hoped our experience would not keep us from coming back.  Really?

The atmosphere and ambience are also great.  We loved the bright, open, airy floor plan. The food was delicious! Instead of the typical ""bread basket"" they serve you mini-cornbreads, which are amazing. For starters, my wife had the corn soup which was, again, delicious. I tried the Grilled Octopus, which was very unique. It's grilled and has a very smoky/charred flavor. Not chewy or tough at all. I'm glad I tried it, but her starter (the soup) was much tastier. My wife chose the Hanger Steak for her entree and it was excellent. Cooked perfectly and very tasty. I had the Serrano Crusted Salmon which is probably the best Salmon dish I have ever had at a restaurant. I love Salmon, but it can tend to be a bit boring so I only order it when I'm in the mood for a lighter/cleaner meal. This Salmon was fantastic. Not only was it cooked perfectly, the serrano crust was very flavorful and added just enough texture. For dessert we had the Custard Filled Doughnuts and the Pretzel Crust Cheesecake. Both were as excellent as they sound. The doughnuts reminded me of french beignets but with custard filling and a dusting of sugar and the pretzel crust added just the right amount of saltiness to the cheesecake.

Loved the ambiance, which is cool and comfy, like sitting in someone's living room. Two of the women I was with drank so much water that I was afraid they'd get H20 poisoning. The guy pouring the water was always there refilling their glasses; I thought he was part of our group.

Renae, our waitress, was friendly and helpful. The two water guzzlers have been there a number of times and have always been waited on by her, so that may account for the extra-good service. Or maybe she's really good!

The HH menu, like most others, has little in the way of healthy food. Here it's the entire bar menu, with the exception of the burger, which is the only thing I'd consider ""real"" food. I don't ever have a bunch of appetizers and then order dinner, so leaving out the burger didn't make me happy. We ordered avocado toast, bao buns, and calamari/shrimp. I didn't try the bao buns. That worked out well, since there were four of us and three of them. There's a limited amount of fried food I can handle, so one of the four half-slice toast pieces and some calamari wasn't enough for dinner. We got another order of avocado toast.

HH has all wines and most of the cocktails at half price, meaning my glass of wine cost about what I'd pay at any other restaurant without a discount.

I'll probably be back, since my friends love this place. It was okay, but I was not overwhelmed, at least not for Happy Hour. There are better menus out there.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,2,0,3,wRIakDcxhIiIYFskBZfRvA

The pineapple was by the far THE BEST. My friends who chose the Bloody Mary bar were very impressed! It was a self serve bar with ENDLESS options of hot sauce, bacon, shrimp, vegetables, and salts to rim the glass. You also get bottomless mimosas included w/ the Bloody Mary bar! There is also a free candy bar full of sweets which was a nice touch. The brunch itself was delicious.

All of the food was delicious, my favorite item being the mac & cheese. It is seriously TO DIE FOR. My boyfriend was disappointed with the thick cut Canadian bacon.

I thought this would be a great opportunity to try some of their seafood appetizers . I decided to take a chance on the Grilled Octopus ($15.00) . This was taking a big leap of faith since I haven't really tried octopus ...there was a piece of an octopus in a Bloody Mary I had a summer ago but that was it.  When it came out it was a bit charred on the outside but really tender on the inside. It came with fingerling potatoes , pickled peppers with romesco. The pickled peppers went so well with this dish.  I ate every little pepper on my plate! 

My second choice was the Shrimp Cocktail ($16.00). I think it's always fun to see how each restaurant will serve it. Will it be in a glass....hmmm the anticipation! Andiron Steak  serves them on a plate just so you know. The shrimp are nice in size and very fresh! I ate some of the biscuits as well which were very good!  

We ended our dinner on a sweet note. I knew that they are known for their Creme Brulee Donuts so I figured they would always be there. We tried one of their featured desserts instead. The Andrion ""Snikkers"" Bar ($9.00) is their take on a Snickers bar . It was made with 64% Vairohna  chocolate mousse, peanut nougat, and salted caramel peanuts. It was a perfect ending to a hot evening. 

I remember thinking how wonderful it was to have a nice restaurant so close rather than treking to the strip. The ambiance reminded me of the Hamptons (honestly I've never been to the Hamptons...I'm just going by what I see in the movies) It had a relaxed vibe to it.

But points off for service. Our waiter was rarely around and barely talked to us. I thought it was odd that he didn't tell us about the specials of the day and at the end of the meal didn't offer dessert and basically disappeared. We had to flag him down to get our bill. However, when we ordered our food, it came out in no time. 

Our friend Ms. L got the bottomless mimosas and the staff was pretty great about keeping her glass full. Hubby ordered a coffee and was quite pleased with the quality. They also both ordered the chilaquiles. Luckily, Ms. L shared hers with me. I got the French Toast (which hubby ate half off because it was a pretty decent serving). I was happy to have some savory and some sweet. The chilaquiles were solidly decent. I'm crazy about mushy tortilla chips for whatever reason. I loved their salsa and I loved that it didn't have any beans. I have to say the Pulled chicken was tender, but had absolutely no flavor. I was content to pick around it and enjoy the rest. 

But I think my French Toast was great! It was super moist and tender, perfectly absorbing the maple syrup. And even better that it was topped with strawberries, whipped cream and comes with a side of strawberry jam. There's a lot of very mediocre French Toast out there - thank goodness this place delivered!

At brunch they offer a complementary candy bar. It's mostly little hard candies with a few plates of chocolate chip cookies and rice krispy treats. I had to try everything, of course. But I feel everything was actually very meh. The Cookies were tender, but just not very exciting. And treats didn't have enough marshmallow for tastes, which made them crunchy as opposed to chewy.  

But I wouldn't be against returning. I can deal with bad service. I'd love to have the French Toast again or give something else a try.",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,8,4,fOEULnijOwhr9d7JA6BNkg

Everything from the greeting by the hostess to the dessert service was spot on. Food was excellent. I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer and 8oz rib cap. My wife, who is vegetation, had the chopped salad and ""cauliflower steak"". I must say, that was one of the high points of the dinner. She was very pleased with it and I even had to have more than one bite. Finished dinner off with Creme Brule Donuts! We had a fabulous meal. Really nothing to critique. Not inexpensive but it is truly a cut above the rest in Summerlin. The only thing it compares to is Vintners Grill which is another of our favorites.

It had a very modern, trendy feel. They also had a live Dj plying which was a nice touch. It was also super easy to make a reservation via open table.

Once we were seated our waiter gave us a brief run down of the new menu items, complementary candy bar, diy Bloody Mary bar and the different flavors of mimosas. The food & drink options were definitely amazing. I opted for the diy Bloody Mary option which was $24 for bottomless, some of the topping options included different flavored rims, shrimp, beef jerky, carrots, olives, lemons, limes and dozens of hot sauces. So good!

As for food to start we shared the Donut Plate. It had 5 different Donut hole flavors to try. My favorites were the peanut butter and jelly and the maple. They were perfectly cooked and had very rich flavors. (5/5) For an entree I went with the Grown-Up Grilled Cheese. I loved how crispy the Texas toast was and the fried egg on top was an excellent touch. (4/5)

Overall I really loved this place. The only reason I docked one star was for the service being a bit slow. We had to flag down our waiter a few times for refills or to grab our check, but other than that it was all good!",OXSJCjKtvZPf-YPDCXcWZg,6,2,4,jp-HRCW4qPx4OxA41ST77g

Main course: Ordered their surf & turf special which was a good size rib eye with jumbo garlic prawns. Also ordered the burrata and grilled figs.  This was an interesting salad.  Never had burrata and it looked like marscapone cheese.  It was actually more of a softer mozzarella consistency served with brown turkey figs drizzled with honey.  Their golden Yukon mash potatoes were really creamy and savory too.

4607788,2018-02-15,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Underwhelmed by my Valentine's Day experience here.

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Restaurant was very crowded and it was obvious they had squeezed in extra tables and chairs just for Valentine's Day.  Their normal tables didn't have tablecloths; and the ones they worked in had tablecloths; and we saw staff folding the tables up before we left.  It was hard to walk in between tables and chairs because everything was so close together.

Only a $79 pre-set menu was available; 3 appetizer and entree choices and 2 dessert choices plus an amuse course that menu said was ""lump crab roll""; waiter delivered something he called a lobster roll.  Um, lobster and crab are 2 different things.  Pretty sure it was lobster.  We both ordered onion soup + surf & turf.  My soup was scorching hot; husband sent his back because it was cold.  He also asked for tea, that was never brought to the table.  I asked for my steak well with no pink; and was given a steak that was perfectly charred on the outside ... and bright pink on the inside.  Wish I had taken a picture.  No idea how they cooked that.  

(The table to my right also had something not make it to their table and we got to listen the conversation as the item was removed from the bill.)

After we had our food, the table to my left turned over and the new guy at the table asked the waiter (same waiter we had!) for a normal menu and was told, sorry, our full menu isn't available tonight, but we also have a shrimp cocktail, Caesar salad, a tomahawk rib eye that you can share, branzino, etc etc and then proceeded to detail more items than what was on the pre-set menu, that could be ordered!  WHAT. Our waiter never shared this with us, at all.  I would have LOVED a shrimp cocktail.  My husband absolutely would have ordered the Caesar salad.  Never given the opportunity.

We ordered one each of the desserts and they were were just OK.  Donuts were more like injected donuts holes.  Candy Bar dessert was very similar to a Butterfinger and was very rich; I couldn't finish it.  It also included ice cream, which wasn't on the menu.  Believe it was caramel ice cream but not 100% sure. 

I've had better dining experiences here.  Would much rather order off their regular menu next time.  The Valentine's Day menu is still on their website as I write this.  If you come for a special occasion, check their website for special menus and if you see one, I recommend re-thinking and skipping this place for a special occasion.",bvnu6ts51ICEPI0p3HMm8g,1,0,2,BMAQxuF-lDq_Uxe4tG3u4w

I got a phenomenal martini with Almond stuffed olives and the chef himself came out to ask my husband what he could do instead.  Robert the bartender was so nice and engaged in enjoyable conversation.  We will definitely make this a regular spot.

Service was pretty good although I did feel the server being a little pushy on the up-selling side instead of recommending all the best things to eat.  Ok so lets get to the food.  For appetizers we got half dozen oysters, nothing too special here but some good quality oysters, but i don't believe they told us what kind they were.  The steak tartar was awesome so I definitely recommend this one.  If you MUST try the mac n cheese waffle because of the hype then go for it but it's not going to amaze you and this will be best shared by 4 people unless you don't on eating an entree.  Tried the wagyu flatiron which was pretty decent and the chimmichurri sauce it came with was awesome. 

So overall, it's not a horrible place to try, but it wasn't anything special either.  If you're looking for a really nice place to be at though, away from the strip, this place wouldn't be so bad.",gvuvcjAVl1ElyXTgU80VRg,3,3,3,nL91k_c4CzKxMDsIfEJiHg

He never removed the rancid oyster from the table.  The Chef never came to our table, nor a manager.  The nasty oyster sat on our table for another 10 minutes.  The server should have said, ""I'm so sorry.  Let me take that away for you.""  Server seemed clueless.  He then, offered to ""replace the Oyster"" with a new one.  Unfortunately, at this point, I lost my craving for oysters.  Everything else went wrong.  When the entrees arrived, the table was still full of dirty plates.

Valet attendant  was friendly, although not needed for us.

The tables are nice and I can see them trying to set a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. 

My reasons include first and foremost the menu!! The seafood was very limited. The Figi water was offered and that was a plus, however we needed to eat as well.

Okay, so my Mom could not get the seafood she desired. Moving on,  EVERYTHING on the menu is a-la- carte! Our group had a total of 6 people, so a small slab of mashed potatoes at $8.00 a pop is $48.00 in potatoes alone!! If you cut the carbs and go with the brussel sprouts it's about the same!! What if you get both?! Plus the entree, we'll you can imagine the bill NOT including the drinks!!

I have been fortunate to frequent some very nice restaurants in my lifetime and this isn't one of them. NO OCEAN, NO VIEW, NO REASON for me to return.

4805376,2018-02-15,1,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"We dined there for a Valentine's Day Dinner. When the reservation was made the previous week there was no mention of a preset menu. Day of my fiancé looked up the menu and noticed their 4 Course preset menu on their website. We looked it over and it seemed pleasing so we kept our reservation. We purposely made our reservation after 8pm to avoid the rush and possibility of bad service as we work in the industry.  

We where greeted immediately and sat right away. We purposely came early to have a drink at the bar before our reservation. The restaurant was about 65% full with many empty tables (8pm). Our server came over and was very nice and went over the wine list with us. We ended up ordering the Pineapple Cocktail. 

The server took our order, mind you the menu items had no descriptions. The scallops where crudo. I was fine with that but my fiancé had to choose from the other two underwhelming options. 

The amuse came out. It was good but it was something you could order at Lobster Me in a hotel food court. The first course came out and the scallops where bland the shaved fennel was more like chopped pieces way too big. The scallops had no taste the should have been marinated longer. The French Onion soup was decent but super hot. 

Our entrees came out immediately after the first course was cleared. They dropped the food and said something as they walked away. Remember the restaurant isn't that busy. Our busser came by and I had to ask for a fork and steak knives for our meal. For a place charging $79 per person they should be able to mark the table properly. We both ordered the same entrée Wagyu NY steak and poached lobster tail. The lobster had to have  been a 3-4oz lobster tail. Once of the smallest I have ever seen. The steak was about 5 oz and was the toughest piece of meat I have ever had. I ordered it medium rare and it came out raw on the inside where the fat was pure white. It was also charred on the outside. The potato again was child sized. The term Wagyu is completely misleading. There is no way this would real Wagyu beef. 

Then to find out they do offer other items that are not listed. However our server did not inform us of such choices. The people next to us where able to order a ribeye steak and Caesar salads. I would much have rather paid $79 for items desired. 

To top it all off our drinks had been empty for about 20 minutes. We where never offer another drink. We would have ordered a bottle of wine as we where celebrating and purposely didn't drive. 

The preset was in my opinion was a fail. For the quality and the price. I had never dined at Andiron before and most likely wont be back. I do however frequent at Honey Salt a sister concept of Andiron. I have never been disappointed there. 

This all happened in 45 minutes from start to finish. We felt rushed throughout our dinner. We eat out about 3 times a week. I have  worked in the restaurant industry for 17 years and my fiancé works in fine dining on the Strip. It should never only take 45 minutes for 4 courses. I strong recommend that the management rethinks what they offer in a preset menu and the pricing. Judging from the recent reviews I am not the only person disappointed with my Valentine's Day Dinner. 

I struggled to give two stars or one. I know it is Valentine's Day and any industry person knows it can be tough. But if you are going to do a preset and only cook limited items make sure they are done well and priced correctly.",Mt6yA523Y48fFt6Lwddl7g,0,0,2,zYEwHBBaQSmXdDmCwK6Ilg

4822111,2016-04-20,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I wish I read the reviews PRIOR to going, however it was a very last minute decision, and boy was it a BAD one!  It was our anniversary.

First off, I had my wife call and see where would be the best parking for us in reference to the restaurant.  The hostess told her to park behind the Lazy Dog Restaurant.  If anyone knows Downtown Summerlin, that is a bit of a walk.  They could have told us about the valet AND open parking right outside of their restaurant.  That should have been a clue for us...not even knowing your parking?!

We arrived about 15 minutes prior to our reservation that wasn't really needed as they were empty.  Another clue...duh!  The hostess was very nice and seated us immediately with our menus.  The table was very small.  We were then greeted by, what I will call, the asst waiter, I think his name was Mike (as he helped us way more than our waitress, Jennifer.)

Mike asked us for our drink order to which we ordered bottle water.  I made a comment to my wife that we weren't given a wine menu.  Well our water came and after a few minutes, Jennifer came with, guess what, the wine and drink menu.  Well I thought that was odd, and lost my desire to order any wine now.  As we had looked over the menu, we asked Jennifer a few questions of the menu.  She answered all of our questions, however, her demeanor was that of someone that was hurried to work and was still trying to settle.  Not rude, but not pleasant either.

We started off with the Sea Platter $56 that consisted of 4 oysters, 4 shrimp cocktail, half a small lobster, crab pieces, a small cerviche, cocktail sauce, 2 slivers of lemon, and some vinaigrette.  The menu says this is for two, but after asking Jennifer about it, we also ordered the tuna cakes $16.  The presentation of both were a solid 4 star, possible a weak 5, HOWEVER, the lack of taste with any of it, coupled with the ridiculous price, scored a nice 1 star.

Prior to us finishing our appetizers, our main dishes made it to the table.  I thought this was also odd for a ""steakhouse""...I mean, you can't check to see where we are on our apps, and fire up our main to coincide with finishing it?  Well whatever, we crowded our small table with a 12oz ribeye $29, 8oz filet $45, creamed spinach $8, mushrooms $8, loaded potato $8.  I requested my filet to be butterflied if it made it easier to get my meat well done.  Wait for it...it was not well done!  At best half medium well, and the rest medium (see pic, lots of red.)  Both of our meats were something you would find on a late night special in a casino or bar.  I must say though, I've had some much better tasting meat, and properly cooked, at casinos and bars compared to this.  Needless to say, it was so disappointing...especially for our anniversary.

Our waitress Jennifer came over ONE TIME to see how our meal was.  I showed her my filet and she suggested for me to send it back.  I was hungry, and told her no, I would just eat what I can.  I mean for $45, I should have a chef that can cook, and not have to send back food.  After that, Jennifer NEVER returned to our table, except to ask about dessert.  Mike, returned several times for our water, and to see how things were.  The manager...wait, oh that's right NO manager came to our table.  Even after my food was not cooked as requested.  Terrible manners Andiron ""steak"" and sea!

We have never balked at pricey bills for GOOD food, but this $200 bill was a TOTAL WASTE!  Here's the kicker...just as we received my paid bill back, Jennifer brought us two quarter sized cookies compliments of the pastry chef...""Happy Anniversary,"" she said.  Really?!?  We stood up, laughed, and couldn't leave fast enough.

Read the reviews here, and save your money.  There are so many other REAL steakhouses in Las Vegas that won't disappoint like Andiron did.  Won't return, and won't recommend.",0krIXTM-fNED7ozGt11UmQ,0,0,1,Zs1NOgdnxkmt3WBsVL5fbg

4946179,2017-12-11,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Food and beverage is par for the course, but there is nothing to distinguish Andiron from other area steakhouses.

I came in for dinner on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was empty with a few people in the bar area.  After sitting down, I received a lukewarm greeting from the bartender before perusing a menu.  The bar is well stocked with liquor.  If you like whiskey, you'll find no shortage of options.  Drinks are half off during happy hour which is a reasonable value.

I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon with gnocchi, roasted butternut squash, and kale as well as a side of broccolini.  The salmon was cooked to temperature.  The portion size was reasonable.  The food tasted good but didn't blow my socks off.  It was about on par for the price, maybe slightly below.

This is the crux of Andiron.  The food and beverage selection is about what you would expect for the price point, and that's about it.  The ambiance is muted.  The staff, with some exception, is unegaged with their customers.  For the same or slightly more money, there are better options (within walking distance).",QfnRnti_FolkrodhZYFP3w,0,0,3,jLmH1YBCoX1g0-tahpyM_g
4950224,2018-02-02,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"UPDATE: Managed to get in here on a WE night for Happy Hour. The menu for such is largely drink based - half off a selection of brews, wines, and cocktails. They do offer a special on oysters which are well worth it. Tried a few regular menu appetizers in addition to the oysters: fried chicken bao buns, poke, grilled octopus and one entree; grilled branzino with a side of grilled broccolini. Appetizers are a funny thing for many restaurants but not here. All three were done with the same care and attention to presentation and taste of an entree. My dining companion and I were torn over which was best. Whereas bao buns tend to disappoint in many establishments these were done with aplomb. Grilled octopus done well is one of my favorites and these are among the best I've had - even in Spain where they're highly coveted. The Poke was equally well done and comes with thin crisps and a smeer of what I think was a spicy avocado along the inside of the bowl. Delightful. I've had the grilled branzino and broccolini in the past and both were an accomplishment. My compliments to the chef. Wait service was prompt, informed and perfectly paced. Overall a dining experience well worth a five star rating. It's not cheap but if you plan on splurging for a mean then Andiron is well worth the time and money. 

Original review: Would have originally written a review about the food, service, decor, etc but got turned away. Went here for happy hour and the bar area - where happy hour occurs - was kind of busy with just one table left. Tried to sit down but was told by the server that it was reserved. A bar seat? During happy hour? Never heard of such a thing. Asked the hostess about it on the way out and she said as far as she knew she couldn't reserve a table in the bar during happy hour. Weird. Oh well. Went to Grape Street instead. Excellent!",UWWbzmO_0qTXurJq1wM_iQ,0,0,5,ZHSJyHI9Uckbig5ONKILxQ

We had the mashed potatoes and the Mac and cheese waffle. I thought the potatoes were whipped too much. I like it a bit more chunky then soupy.

We ordered two glasses of wine and it literally took TWENTY MINUTES! Everything was too expensive and they only had like 7 items and steak on the menu. Everything was over $30 for an entree. I had to settle for avocado toast, Mac and cheese, and Brussels sprouts. 

They all tasted good but I was definitely ripped off. Why charge so much for food that wouldn't even be categorized as fine dining?!

I also ordered a earl grey mixed cocktail and it sucked. No alcohol and all juice/tea. Worst service I've ever endured in a pricy/""upscale"" restaurant. It was empty tonight so that pretty much speaks for itself.",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,8,2,2,h7FBvpdUp9VAQLstSZD2uQ
5049748,2015-06-26,7,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"The hubby got off work early so we decided to go hit up another restaurant week participating restaurant. $50.15 for this particular 3course dinner. 

We were offered nice crusty bread with soft butter and black salt while we waited.

Appetizers we went with:

ROASTED CORN SOUP (king crab, micro cilantro) which was a exceptional soup. It's hot as balls outside and I wasn't too keen on soup, but it was sweet corn flavor, great light texture and nice fresh crab pieces. 

OLD BAY SHRIMP COCKTAIL (horseradish panna cotta, cocktail sauce) which had 3 huugggee shrimp pieces. Very fresh, but simple. 

For the main we both went with the WAYGU SKIRT STEAK (wood fired asparagus, glazed shallots, chimichurri). On the RW site, it was a ribeye cap but when we got there it was a skirt steak. It was still good, but that is a bit more of a chewier cut of meat which the hubs didnt like as much but that's kinda the nature of this type of meat and not a error in preparation. The flavor was there. Great chimmichurri sauce, sweetest shallots I've had roasted and good char on the asparagus. 

The one bone to pick with this RW menu is that it was not very balanced in the entree options. Price wise, the other 2 entrees were half the price so if you aren't ordering the steak option then you're maybe better off a la carte. I wish the fish option wasnt the salmon but one of the others. 

Dessert we tried one of each offered. 

ASHLEY'S CREME BRULEE DONUTS was the type of thing I could eat more of and get sick from eating beyond my capacity. Delicious creme inside a nice warm soft and crispy donut with some flambee'd sugar on the outside. More please. ALL the supply the kitchen has. 

ALMOND CHERRY CLAFOUTIS (cherry creme fraiche ice cream) was not very sweet, but had a souffle' like texture. Never had a clafoutis before so I don't know what it's supposed to be like, but I dug it. 

We both thought the desserts were the strongest of the RW meals we've had so far. 

Service was pretty good. No major snafus and after asking once for a refilled, it never occurred again and we were checked on quite often. Kitchen staff was on it as food came out quick and proper temperatures. Not a lot of lull between courses which tends to happen. 

We both did like what this place has to offer so I will be back for just a regular dinner service sometime.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,10,7,4,xrDQnvaUh39ffkPoH4hf-g

It fits right into Summerlin.  A great eatery with vibrant local energy, great food, warm open ambiance, and enough restrained creativity to keep you coming back.

BRUNCH:

Three words:  Bloody Mary Bar.

Simply outstanding.  From well chosen mixes and vodka through an dizzying array of some 12 seasoned salts and two dozen hot sauces, to bacon, boiled shrimp, olives, onions, pickles, veg.  Something is wrong with you if you can't create the perfect Bloody Mary.  

Drinks alone don't make a brunch so add a bunch of shareable plates.  The burrata and roasted peaches, watercress, drizzled with white balsamic and topped with crunchy pistachios, screams summer.  Beautiful balance that wakes the palate.  A very good, mustardy, course cut steak tartare with bits of cornichons on grilled bread also a great brunchable.  Bitter and tangy, all work to sweeten the raw beef and punch up the mineral flavor.  Throw in some avocado toast, jumbo shrimp cocktail, a couple dozen oysters, and some fire grilled thick cut bacon (no complaints on any) and brunch is complete.

Note:  There are other more traditional brunch items and a nice looking mimosa bar.

DINNER:

It's all about the steaks.  Focus on the butchers cuts for the most flavor  Steaks are charred over a wood fire imparting the classic wood grilled flavor with sweet smoky bitterness.  Great sear, even cooking, to temp, moderately well trimmed.  The flatiron has the most pronounced beef flavor, the tri tip beefy and juicy, the rib cap, tender and juicy.  

Sides are simple and seasoned in a way that properly matches the grilled flavor of the steaks.  The wood fired asparagus, slightly crisp and topped with a romesco and roasted broccolini with earthy parm and a squeeze of lemon to cut the fattiness of the steak.    Finally, the mac and cheese waffle.  Interesting, crispy on the outside while maintaining a creamy, gooey core.  Great when hot but tires the palate as it cools.

Well chosen wine list.   Relaxed local service.  Pricing of some items rivals the Strip.

All told, recommended.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,26,28,4,bXxfalKQijJQL42UWPKPFQ

We had a group of 6. And it took us 2 1/2 hours to dine. We were not sat for awhile due to missing one person. Once we got to our table, the waitress seemed overwhelmed. We kept having to get her attention just to order everything. Some drinks weren't getting to the table or some of the appetizers. They ended up giving us 2 drinks for free. She seemed much more calm after a minute. But there was about 4 different people serving us throughout the meal. It just didn't seem very organized. But the staff was very kind.

Most of the prices are pretty decent. We ended up paying about 92$ pp since we split the bill. This was for appetizers, dinner, dessert and drinks. 
The dishes that were worth the price:

The polenta side. I know it's just a side, but it's topped with truffle and mushroom. It was the best polenta I've ever had. Insanely creamy and downright delightful.

The bacon on the blue cheese salad. So thick and flavorful. 

My aged rib eye was very good. It was cooked perfectly and it was very flavorful. My husband's ribeye cap was overcooked and not so great. If it would have been cooked as asked (medium rare), it would have been much better.

Entrees were even less impressive- 
Quality of beef which is the most important thing in a steakhouse was just ok at best.

Food. I thought I would be blown away. Not so much. My husband's steak is great, it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. But we've had better steak for sure! My steak was I think over cooked, I would say maybe my fault because I ordered it medium well. But I didn't realize the cut was so thin!  The Jumbo Shrimp is delicious and I love the shishito peppers that was on the plate. 

Best part. Mac N Cheese!!! Do order if you go. Calamari is good, it has slight tang and spicy flavor, lightly breaded, on the salty side for me (but my husband who loves salt, is happy about it). I've had better for sure. The desserts are amazing! We ordered the donut creme brûlée and carrot cheesecake (seasonal) I think. Also ordered Brussels Sprouts, cooked the way I like it.

5181438,2016-01-26,3,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Hello and welcome to Andiron Steak & Sea. This review is long over due. I have made a resolution that I will post my reviews in an appropriate time so I will not forget too much of the experience. We made reservations for what has become a monthly spend more than normal dinner adventure. I have seen so many good stories and reviews that we had to go here. Plus it was my turn  to choose. I like the vibe you get as you enter, greeted and promptly sat when full party arrived. I had got a drink at bar  before our party arrived and I liked the friendliness of the bartender and how quickly I was greeted with how busy the bar was. 
I dob't usually mention the decor(I am more about food and service). I enjoyed the soft white linens and green accents made it really feel like I was being taken on a food experience. We as a group tend to sample each others meal so as to get a full example of the menu. I had The Branzino, I have always wanted to try one and this was my very first experience (nothing to compare it to...yet). This was very good. Had a chmichuri sauce and was stuffed with meat from the fish. Pretty amazing fish dish. I like to try new things and was not disappointed. Others in our group had Mac-n-cheese, mac-n-cheese waffle, polenta (really flavorful) the Strip, Rib Eye Cap. Desert was pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla and salted caramel ice cream. Price was reasonable for 7 of us. 
Since I like service, I need to get better at writing down names when my servers are above excellent. I wish I remembered her name. She was a little older lady with a small accent. She was very entertaining and was great at recommending food and rink. We brought our own wine and paid a small corkage fee. We really had a dining experience and it was in thanks to the great service provided. We had a view of the kitchen and it is fun to see how things get expedited in a well run galley. 
There were some off notes with some of the food but overall it was a great night(experience). We never felt rushed and were allowed to enjoy our meal. This is a little out of my way so I can see going there if I was in area and wanted a strong steak meal while in downtown summerlin.

5193829,2018-01-30,3,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"0n 01/13/18 I visited Andiron. The best service was received by the hostess and the second-helper - who should have been a server.. The server Misho was only interested in the tables buying wine or alcohol. 

While I had a great experience on my first visit, I can see that the service level and food quality is not consistent. While I did choose to speak to the manager prior to leaving, the remedy of coming back and letting them ""take care of me"" on a return visit is not likely to happen - because why go back and deal with that hassle? I wasn't at Andiron for a ""free meal"" I was there to have a great experience and celebrate. The embarrassing part was that the restaurant was empty for the most part. Very few tables and our server had only 2.

The great part of the meal was the scallops - cooked perfectly. My steak was ordered and I specifically stated that I want the steak well-done, no pink, and cooked throughout without being burnt. This is a steakhouse, you would think they could cook a well-done steak? 

The server warned that this would mean a longer wait for our meals, to which I told him that I understood an extended time to prepare my well-done steak.

My steak was served medium rare. I waited 5 minutes to flag down our server, and he rushed it to the back. 5 minutes later he came back and the steak was now medium-well and very pink. He offered to take it back again and cook the same steak more. At this point I actually asked for a box, and packed it to go because we were finished with our meal.

At no point prior to me asking for the manager from the hostess, on the way out, did anyone make any attempt to solve this issue or refund the steak that the couldn't figure out how to cook.",Q7IoE5m2heQKThuVq3SYFA,4,1,2,X4KjrxMyOezhWQLC_sS8QQ

No asparagus on plate, potato gratin was a two inch square and the lobster tail was cold and had a weird taste.  Still tasting it as I write my review.  His meal of just potato gnocchi was the same price as my surf and turf??! The only other entree choice was pan roasted striped bass.  The couple next to us ordered that and it was a good sized portion.  You've got this nice expensive restaurant and you sit practically on top of each other.  I could literally hear the couple next to us conversation. Dessert was decent.

5216104,2015-10-03,1,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I was very excited to try this restaurant after my husband hosted a business dinner there and brought home some delicious leftovers.  I had heard from a few friends that the food was great, but the service was not up to par.  We decided to give it a go anyway.  
We went on Friday night at 7, and it was not overly busy.  The restaurant itself is very visually appealing.  It's very open and I loved the decor.  There are large windows everywhere and the kitchen is visible through windows that divide the dining room from the kitchen. They had live music which was great.    We sat at the bar first and ordered 2 of the specialty cocktails.  It took 3 bartenders about 10 minutes to bring the first cocktail, which was mine, and then my husbands drink took about another 10 minutes. Apparently, only one bartender (the one working the service well) was able to make my husbands drink so we had to wait until she was available to make it.  It was a fall ""yam"" old fashioned.  When she poured the drink into a martini glass from the shaker, right in front of us at the bar, the drink looked short and she shook the shaker very hard to get every last drop out, which made a little mess and spilled some of the drink on the bar.    None of the 3 bartenders were engaging or friendly.  

We went to the dining room next to have dinner.  Our server greeted us quickly and went over the specials.  There were only 2 specials, a truffle risotto and an au gratin potato side dish, which our server had to read from his notes to tell us about.   I thought maybe he might be new and didn't mind this, but I did think it a little odd considering all of the other fine dining restaurants and even more casual places I have been too where servers have memorized 6 or 7 specials.  This didn't hinder my experience though.  When our server came back to take our order, we had decided on our appetizers but were still debating on our entrees, so I asked him if he could please put in our app order and then come back in a few minutes so we could decide on our entrees.  He got a little spastic and said, ""I'm trying to not send too many tickets to the kitchen and I want to put your order in all on one ticket so I don't want to put your appetizer in without your entree"".  My husband and I were both dumbfounded when he said this.  I have never been to a restaurant where a server acted this way and started to ramble about kitchen tickets to me.  We felt pressured to decide on our entrees immediately and aggravated that he rushed our decision.  Ultimately, it was because he was too lazy to have to worry about entering the the second course of our meal at a later time which would require him watching our appetizer progress and timing when to fire our second course to ensure a good flow for our dinner.  The appetizers were both very good.  The corn chowder and the burrata with figs were delicious. The bread with salted butter they brought was also delicious.   What ruined our experience the most was when our entrees came out before we were even finished enjoying our appetizers.  I was in the restroom and my husband had to hurry up and finish the apps so they could take the plates and serve us our dinner.  I still had half a glass of white wine that I hadn't finished yet and I wanted to order a glass of red to have with my entree, but since the courses were so rushed, I didn't even bother.  We like to have a relaxing dinner pace and enjoy each course with wine pairings and this was not an option here.  We shared a filet, which was your average filet that you could get at any steak place.  The sauces, peppercorn and chimichurri were both very tasty. The Mac and cheese waffle, that was touted as a ""must have"" by the server and, we were told, was featured on the food network, was disappointing.  It was very dry and basically tasted like cheesy, toasted bread.  The other side we had was the mushrooms, which were very tasty.   The best part of the meal, by far was the dessert.  The creme brûlée donuts are to die for!  Absolutely delicious!  We talked to both the server and the manager about the issues we had and they were both very apologetic about the rushed pace of our meal.  They sent a dessert because it was our anniversary.  It was the lemon meringue tart.  We both had a taste and it was good.  However, we already ordered the dessert we really wanted, the donuts, and did not need another one as we were already very full.  In my opinion, they should have comped the dessert of our choice if that's what they were planning to do, instead of sending out something we didn't want and were unable to eat.  I did appreciate that they did send something and that they were apologetic about our concerns.  I would try this restaurant again as I think the chef is very creative and the food is good.  The ambiance is great too.  They just need to improve the level of skill and customer service of their staff to bring it up to par with the food quality.",T-z5MdFnNPsRMDAg9Ei_KA,2,0,3,U2IM73tCzVuPDQHfrtZSlQ

I wouldn't have found this place if it was not for Groupon, but when you call to ask about the restaurant, making tea reservation or just walking in...the exceptional al service and experience begins right then and there. Mike who answered the phone obviously takes pride in the service they provide. He was more than pleasant before and after hearing ""Groupon"" - which as an avid seeker of new restaurant and love using Groupon deals for it, but there can be a stigma that goals along with the use and is usually quite noticeably negative.

We ordered the ribeye, medium rare and cooked perfectly and served with a delectable side of peppercorn sauce . Sides of mashed potatoes and broccolini that were good. Ordered the side of Mac and cheese (so good!!) with a kids meal for my daughter, I think I enjoyed as much as she enjoyed bits of my steak. Dessert we had the Creme brûlée donuts (which I thought were good- not amazing as I expected) and the bananas tres leche (yum yum yum!)

One tends to wonder if it's going to be any good when it's this empty at dinner time.  We were seated immediately in a corner table near the back of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive. We were offered corn bread until we were ready to order. I went with the soy braised short rib with turnip purée and parsnips. The presentation was amazing. The meat was failing off the bone delicious. OMG. I wish I could copy this recipe at home.  It was so tender I could cut it with a fork and moist, melt in your mouth goodness.

5278257,2015-06-03,9,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"This is one of those reviews that starts out like ""I wanted to like this place BUT...."". Don't get me wrong, Andiron's nails the ambiance factor and presents visually stunning food, but I thought the food was mediocre. Basically, I was turned off by the heavy handed use of salt and capers in the food. Just FYI, I hate salt. I'm more of a pepper kind of girl. Anyways, my husband and I chose to eat at Andiron Steak & Sea to celebrate our 8 year marriage anniversary. I actually picked the place because the fanciness appealed to me and I loved that vegetarian options were offered at a steakhouse.  

COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: Two rolls that were flaky on the outside and airy on the inside were served with a side of seasoned butter. These were very salty (I think the butter had capers). I am all about bread baskets, but I couldn't even finish my roll. 2/5

ANDIRON CAESAR ($12): I sampled some from my husband's plate. Again, very salty but capers were listed on the menu. I've come to the conclusion I hate capers. 2/5

PORK SCHNITZEL ($25): Visually pleasing and husband said it was ""pretty good"". I sampled the red wine cabbage served on the side and was surprised at how sweet it was. I called it dessert cabbage. 4/5

ROASTED CAULIFLOWER STEAK ($23): This entree elicited ooohs and ahhs from the table next to us, but taste wise, fell flat. The giant mushrooms were super chewy and the vinegar dressing was too sour for my tastes. I wouldn't order this again. 2/5

MAC & CHEESE WAFFLE ($11): One of the most innovative things I've seen but dammit, why is it so salty?? 3/5      

VIBE: Open and airy, cloaked in mostly whites, and accented by small floral designs and shades of green. The crowd was of the refined type and were mostly older folks. I was impressed with the ambiance, that's for sure. 4.5/5

SERVICE: Eh. I was asked 3 times by 3 different people if I wanted something to drink besides water. By the third time, I was annoyed. My husband got a coke and it was perpetually empty, although the staff were quick to refill our water glasses. I felt like the server was trying too hard to up-sell us. 2/5 

Worth a Return Visit?
My reasoning behind the 3 stars is this: If you're going to charge high prices for food, that food better be excellent. I don't know if I'll come back to Andiron because the chef in there is going crazy with salt and capers.

Owned and operated by Elizabeth Blau and husband Kim Canteenwalla, with talent in the kitchen supplied by Joe Zanelli, Andiron Steak & Sea is without a doubt the centerpiece of Downtown Summerlin's dining scene, and yet as much as some would like to anoint it a groundbreaking development...or even a ""game changer""...the reality is that the restaurant is exactly what it claims, a modern steakhouse with seafood and sides executed at a level corresponding with the associated fee.

Large in size and light in ambiance, the flowing space featuring an outdoor patio juxtaposing a sexy bar that greets the eye just as patrons enter the door, a first glimpse of Andiron occured during the restaurant's grand opening but waiting until buzz died down to sit for a proper meal it was with three friends that dinner was taken, the original plan of deferring to the kitchen quickly squashed when an order was requested with the resulting experience occurring over the course of two hours during which much food and fun was had.

Well appointed with white linen as large windows bathe the space with light it was after a short visit from Chef Zanelli that the meal began and first treated to a gift of melon and prosciutto it would not be long before the table was quickly overloaded, a duo of salads and four starters immediately necessitating a request for more prolonged pacing as chilled dishes were set aside to focus on those more temperature sensitive - the grilled vegetables and pork belly both highlights from round one while the flavor of the lobster was almost entirely lost amidst its accoutrements and foie gras trended a touch pricey considering its small size.

Thankfully giving time to photograph, chat, and exchange opinions of plates before queuing up course two it was again that the service structure at Andiron saw a plethora of plates arrive shortly after those from round one were cleared, and having opted to pair three entrees to four sides the results were surprisingly similar to that already experienced, both the Tomahawk Chop and Crispy Pork Schnitzel prepared as good as any off-Strip while the Linguini was texturally mushy, the carrots proving the high-point of the sides mainly as a result of the ginger puree beneath while the clever macaroni waffle was far better than the first time around in part due to the cheesy sauce added tableside.

Never one to shy away from sweets, though admittedly a bit disappointed that the tarte tatin and ice box cake listed online have been deep-sixed in favor of chocolate pudding cake and an admittedly impressive cherry clafoutis, it was with a quintet of complimentary desserts that the meal would end and as much as the crème brûlée donuts may indeed get all the press it was actually the aforementioned almond cake alongside the Brown Butter Lemon Pie that saw everyone smiling in agreement - the later a dessert ranking high amongst Las Vegas' very best.

Thus far a hit as the restaurant was nearly 90% full on a Friday evening throughout the majority of our stay the question that few have answered is how exactly Andiron ups-the-ante compared to the likes of nearby Flemming's or even Echo & Rig, the former obviously a chain with similar price structure as well as execution while the latter is seriously flawed in its dessert program, though ringing in at 2/3 the cost for a similar upscale experience, plus in-house butchery and curing programs allowing for far more range.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,3,a6V48ARMga3sznq2f4f5CA

They put us, a party of 6, at a table meant for 4, even though there were tables of 6 available.  When I flagged down a manager-looking person and told him we wanted to move, he said I was lucky I asked him ( I guess instead of someone else who would have made us sit where we were?).  They are understaffed with waiters. When our (head?) waiter finally came, he introduced himself and said he'd be serving us with a team to make sure all our experience was excellent.  No one else introduced themselves and we just wound up having to flag employees down as they whizzed by on their way somewhere else. If I managed a restaurant that was understaffed, I'd roll up my sleeves and help wait and bus tables.  However, the managers did LOOK nice I their spiffy suits.... (One other note--Our bill was a few hundred dollars.   Two of us split an entree. Instead of splitting it in the kitchen, they brought an extra plate for us to do it ourselves.  That's cool,  but restaurants in the category they are trying to be, should take care of it for the customer.)",Z11M5QBjRT_kwg1cl4ugKg,2,0,2,QOIGQdUTC59_qQX6WZBIug

5401161,2017-01-12,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"My last review was for a straight five stars and the experience was wonderful. We had great service and the food was delicious. Unfortunately, my second time around for brunch was very disappointing and the restaurant gets three stars because it became average and some place I would not go back to again, despite not being terrible.
I started with the avocado toast again, and it was very different from the last time. Last time it was fresh and lovely with avocado and a few vegetables on top of very good toast. This time around, a bunch of very hot peppers were placed on top which tasted very different from the last time and I found it very unpleasant. What bothered me most is that nowhere on the menu did it say hot spicy peppers and that is something that a restaurant should warn anyone that is not into very spicy food about. They did not and, compared to last time, where it was very different, it was a fail. We also ordered the sesame bagel with both lox cold salmon as well as cooked salmon with cream cheese and that was good, but I would just have made it lox without the cooked salmon, which wasn't very good nor was it needed.
I then asked the waiter what he thought of the Summerlin omelette, as the last time I got the skillet which was very good, with fresh eggs and potatoes and ham and bacon and it was very good. The waiter told me that the Summerlin omelette is lovely and fresh. What??? It was absolutely disgusting. It was made to sound like this fantastic omelette that had all kinds of vegetables and cheese in it. All it was was a pathetic omelette with cheese in it that looked rolled up like something you could make in anyone's cheap kitchen with some salad on top. Grossly disappointing and an absolute no to order again or to even consider having anyone order! It was terrible! What made it even more disappointing is that it came with two slices of toast, and you did not have a choice to the kind of toast that you wanted, but when I asked for jam, the restaurant didn't have any! They brought a small side of applesauce? For brunch, no jam... Really? My friend ordered the Chilaquiles which was made with chicken, and my friend who is authentic and is Mexican, when it comes to Latin cuisine, explained that the chicken was not needed and she kept putting it aside because it wasn't making the dish successful.
We did order the crème brûlée donuts and they were just OK. Know that you do not have to order dessert as the restaurant offers, complementary, a candy bar with brownies and cookies, all for free. They also offer a bottom less option for bloody Marys where they have a bar with all kinds of options set up to make it or bottomless Mimosas with specific flavors. They are both OK. Overall, we had a difficult time with service which was not as good and it almost seems like either they were not around or they were shorthanded.

5402252,2015-05-06,0,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Really enjoyed this restaurant! I met a friend last night and we decided to try something new. The decor is open, airy and sophisticated. The staff have a great energy and the service was excellent. 

My food was very good, with a few misses. I ordered the ""Grilled and Chopped Salad"" which wasn't my favorite. The flavors were good, but the texture was off--everything was too mushy with the grilled vegetables, kale and romaine--all blended together. My friend had the caesar however, which was excellent. We both ordered steaks--I had the NY strip and he had the filet. The steaks were divine!! They were cooked perfectly and accompanied by Chimichurri sauce--which is a MUST try. We ordered the Mac and Cheese waffle which was creative and delicious (and very filling!). The creamed spinach was OK--tasted more like the flavor profile of green bean casserole...

DESSERT--You HAVE to try the donuts. They were absolutely amazing--crispy and fresh on the outside, with vanilla custard on the inside. Showstopper. My friend ordered the cheesecake--which it was good--beware! It is a more traditional style and VERY cheesy. The ""vanilla"" flavoring is very overpowered by cheese and the sour cream top. If you love the cheese in cheesecake, then go with it! If not, GET. THE. DONUTS.

The drink menu was creative. I had the Red Wine Sour--which was not very red-wine at all, but delicious. The ""wine by the glass"" menu is lengthy with some great wines on there at many different price points (about time in Vegas!). 

Overall, great experience. Steaks, service and atmosphere will have me coming back!",wIRzuNxl0vjRi9rBDsj93w,1,1,4,TgDwvZRwNesVCUd5C4_krg

They open at 4pm, we arrived around 4:15. They only have the happy hour menu available, but the full menu isn't available till 5pm. The menu is very small, and they're considered to be bite size appetizers, hence the price point. 

We ordered the poke, bao, shrimp cocktail, truffle fries, and steak tartare. Also, we ended up checking-in and getting a free dessert. The creme brûlée donuts, with a scoop of banana caramel definitely hits the spot. 

I would say if you're hungry, order multiple plates. But honestly, I would rather try the full menu next time.

This was our first venture for brunch as a group so our expectations for it wasn't necessarily high so it was going to be relatively easy to impress us...again, as a group. The interior is exceptionally white with bright light and colorful floral décor with bar impressively implemented into the room which looks separate but is still easily accessible. The first thing ordered were bottomless mimosas for two of the four at our table. In all respect to the glory that is brunch, I had succumbed to the lure of the steak & eggs with a side order of the Applewood bacon. After which a different server questioned my restraint of the maple glazed Wood Grilled Thick Cut Bacon. He insisted I try it and brought out a small sample of it to taste (in short, the tastiness of the maple glazed Wood Grilled Thick Cut Bacon matched the precision of the use of adjectives in its name). 

Within our table, the items ordered were the Steak & Eggs, Serrano Crusted Salmon, The Benedict, Sunday Morning Pancakes, and the Summerlin Omlette. After receiving feedback, all of the dishes ordered were delicious to the taste. The presentation and style of each dish was uniquely fine-tuned to match its flavor. I like when food tastes just as good as it looks. The service was more than helpful in making our experience there pleasant. The woman in charge on keeping on refilling our champagne glasses literally stayed true to the notion of ""bottom-less"" mimosas considering we never saw the bottom of our glasses. I do have to disclose that the champagne used for the mimosas was the low-budget Cook's Champagne. Not going to indulge in that again. I lived the rest of the day in agony.

To sum up, Andiron is a great location for brunch. I do highly recommend it! Stay away from cheap champagne or ask for upgrades.",mhHHgIC1HCAIq8tkGvtisg,1,1,5,er2H-bXPy7OKrsqNuLFs8g

But we didn't think of that when planning our evening. Since we were heading out for a concert after, we saved drinks for later and ordered dinner only. We had a very attentive waitstaff. The bread basket was excellent and hard to resist. I ordered branzino fish and the hubby ordered short ribs. Substitutions were not allowed so this was my second choice. While I appreciate the chef for not wishing to change the menu, I have not encountered this rigidity lately. My fish was very fresh and mildly seasoned. The short ribs were extremely flavorful.

5551162,2017-02-16,1,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Brought the boyfriend here for Valentine's Day dinner. First and foremost, I made reservations two weeks prior for 9PM and the hostess made confirmation calls the day of and was nice enough to let me change my reservation to 9:30 even though the restaurant closes at 10 (some places wouldn't make this exception, but the hostess was really kind and said that it was Valentine's Day so it was fine, I believe her name was Rocky). 

We did the Valentine's Fixed Menu for $79 per person and wine pairing for $35 per person. We started with Kumiai oysters (1 for each us). It was served warm with some kind of topping over it that looked like a scrambled egg. I wasn't a big fan of it, but that's because I personally prefer my oysters cold and raw and nothing too crazy. This was served with a glass of bubbly.

For appetizers, my boyfriend ordered the pear and endive salad in bleu cheese. The alternate option was a tuna tartare, which they ran out of, and since I'm allergic to pears, they were able to substitute with a hamachi salad and that was super delicious. It was a pretty small serving, about 6 bite slices of fish to be exact, but every bite was really fresh. For this course of the meal, we had a white wine paired with it called Heaven's Horses aka ""3 H's"" according to our server. This complemented the course well.

For our main course, we both ordered surf and turf, which came with a small portion of potato au gratin. The lobster was good, can't really go wrong with lobster tail. The steak was okay. I like my steak cooked to medium, which it was, but the outside was over-cooked so it was a little chewy. We asked for steak sauce on the side to add a little more flavor to it. The potato au gratin was tasty; it had a hint of sweetness to it, but again, the portion was small. This course was paired with a cherry tart red wine, which also was a great complement.

For dessert, we ordered the German chocolate brownie and banana cream tres leches. The German chocolate was too sweet for my liking since it was also drizzled with chocolate syrup. As for the tres leches, it was perfectly made. It wasn't too soggy from the milk, also not too sweet, and the mascarpone made for a satisfying topping.

5551325,2016-03-30,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Best steakhouse west of the strip with ease.

First, the place looks great let's get that out of the way. Nice open space and a great decor make it very inviting. It has a fairly upscale feel but the restaurant is still very casual. The blend works.

In reality this place is really a 4.5 but since we are confined to whole numbers I was feeling generous. The half a star knock goes to the bread. It is, for lack of a better way to describe it, not good. I'd hesitate to call it bread because it's close to yorkshire pudding but nowhere near as good as that. It had similar consistency and crunch but it just didnt really work. Butter was awesome though so I ate all the bread anyways because butter nom nom nom

-Avocado Toast. This was way better than it should have been. A very generous amount of avocado per piece of toast coupled with some amazingly flavorful tomatoes made this one of the better light appetizers I've had in a while. I can imagine some saying it's not flavorful enough and yeah I'll admit it's not decadent. But the natural flavors are there, you just have to be paying attention.

-Bacon wrapped matzo balls. Ah the most beautiful oxymoron I've seen in a while. Maybe it's the Jew in me wanting to be naughty but this thing tasted incredibly good. The horseradish creme fraiche was DOPE.

-Rib cap. Look this steak was just really good. Cooked exactly how I wanted and seasoned very well too. No it's not the best steak Ive had in Vegas but it's definitely the best one I've had off strip and for only $34 I consider that a steal.

-Roasted brussel sprouts. These were pretty good. Not mind blowing but as far as Im concerned as long as you make brussel sprouts edible it means they were done right as we've all eaten brussel sprouts that we could have lived without at one point in our lives.

-Rum cake. God yes give me more. The cake was amazing, the pineapples super sweet, the streusel so sugary, and the sobert perfect. That bite you get with all the components put together was one of the best things I've had in a while.

This is more than a good restaurant this is a repeat over and over kind of place. If you want steak but not the hassle of the strip, this is the place.",TZhIAnp1m3RzWevju1mp1g,2,4,5,NEgca7Q2d2Wbcr4czDjOJw

The quality of the food was good but a bit overpriced for what was delivered.   My 8oz filet was probably closer to 7oz and fetched $45 bucks.

The first turnoff was the water - would we like still or sparkling?   Really, not even offering tap water?

Server was very pushy, and at the beginning was trying to rush us.  Once the drinks game, she said she would be right back to take our order, and it was at least 15 minutes.  On the return, we were only told about the specials at that time, and were clearly expected to make a snap decision.  Many times we requested refills, more water, etc, and the server or water person would leave before we would finish speaking, and we would have to wait to order the other's drinks.  Empty glasses stood on our table the entire meal.  At one point I counted 6 empties, and there were not cleared until just before dessert.

The ambiance of Andiron Steak and Sea reminded me of Laguna beach and Tommy Bahamas mashed up. Beautiful simple, contemporary practical decor, comfortable lounge seating great open windowed kitchen and bar - This is a huge hit - Hard to beat HoneySalt, but each restaurant Elizabeth is a part of will be a roaring success - cannot wait to come back.

We reserved online and they even prepared a special dessert for our special occasion. For a Vegas local - this is class act touch all the way!!

The food is truly amazing.

We started with the fig and burrata salad...balanced and quite amazing.

I had a bone in filet and my wife had the wagyu skirt steak. Both were cooked to perfection. We had creamed spinach and twice baked potatoes as sides. Everything was perfect.

5715375,2016-03-14,13,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"I've been wanting to go here forever and was finally able to visit on Saturday 3-12-16 at 7:40 PM.  I didn't realize it was in Downtown Summerlin and it's freakin' fancy!  We almost walked out because we felt under-dressed but the hostess assured us there was no dress code. There was a live band playing and the decor is SWANK-Y.  

They seem to not be kid-friendly but we called ahead and asked if children were allowed and they said yes.  No high chair or booster seat was offered, nor did they bring any utensils or beverage for the boy.  We got plenty of stares even though he was behaving.  If I had it to do over again, I'd probably not bring the boy and I would have dressed up a bit.  

$140.60 got us a shrimp cocktail, scallop entree, wagyu burger, two sides, a cocktail, a caesar salad, and a dessert. Complementary warm bread and soft butter were brought to the table.  They asked if we wanted fizzy or flat water and I said flat so we got charged for an $8 bottle of Fiji water.  Not cool.  

$12.00 caesar salad was very tasty, fresh, and undoubtedly had house-made dressing.  Capers were an interesting addition.  I totally recommend this! 

$17.00 shrimp cocktail was absolutely gorgeous.  I was so pissed when I got home and looked at my pics and the picture is blurry!!!! GAWD.  The shrimp were huge, succulent, and sweet and the presentation was so fancy.  I loved the horseradish panna cotta balls...so adorable! 

$34.00 for five scallops is pretty absurd. They were cooked well and I enjoyed the celery and mushrooms but the scallops themselves were laying on a bed of minty, mushy, peas.  Mint and scallops was an odd combination that I couldn't wrap my brain around. 

The mashed potatoes were heavenly....they reminded me so much of my mom's!  Silky, flavorful, absolutely decadent!  The brussel sprouts were equally as tasty and had a lovely, smokey flavor.  $9.00 each but totally worth it, IMO.  

The most anticipated dish of the night was the brown butter lemon meringue tart.  The meringue was unlike any I've ever seen or tasted before.  It was incredibly smooth like marshmallow fluff but stiff like a meringue.  I'd be very interested to see their recipe.  The filling of the pie was sweet and tart and lucious but the crust was like a rock.  Seriously I was wishing that they hadn't took my steak knife because that tart needed a chainsaw to cut through it.  

Overall the food was very enjoyable and somewhat expensive but the best part about this place is their speed.  The service was impeccable and they were there as soon as we needed them.  When you have a toddler with you, the goal is to get in and out as quick as possible.  They picked up on this without us saying a word and I appreciated it.  Yeah...I'm a fan.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,23,16,4,M1oNkusEnQ7bBybtCVaUtA

5774098,2015-04-19,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Dinner reservation 6:30 pm on Saturday night. I've been looking forward to dining here since they opened. Went with a couple of friends. My two star review is based solely on my meal. 

Decor and ambiance 4 stars. Has a nice tropical feel, mostly all white with some floral patterns. Nice outdoor patio, nice bar area. 

Bar 4 stars. Big and roomy. I had a moscow mule served in a copper mug. At least 4 bartenders on staff. 

Restaurant service 4 stars. A nice greeting by the hostess, and our waitress was very pleasant and professional. Gave us the low down on a couple specials as well as some recommendations for the meal. Plenty of service staff on hand.

The food - well this is where it gets interesting. We ordered the Foie Gras brulee as an appetizer. It was accompanied by some huckleberry jam that was delicious. Unfortunately the bread that came with the foie gras was burnt. Ended up using the bread that came with the table, and even that wasn't all that impressive. Dry and hard.

My friends ordered Scottish Salmon and Pork Schnitzel. The Schnitzel was pretty tasty, lightly breaded with a hint of lemon. Both of them enjoyed their meal. I ordered the Prime ribeye ""mignon"" which was supposed to be the center cut of ribeye, with the most flavor. $41. I ordered it medium rare. When it came out, it was closer to medium and wasn't moist and flavorful, but rather firm and bland. The accompanying steak sauce was mandatory to add flavor and it wasn't that great either. I was pretty disappointed with this selection.

Overall, nice place but the food wasn't up to the standards I expect, especially a steak when you call yourself a steakhouse. Don't think I""ll be coming back here when there are many other quality restaurants to choose from.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,14,5,2,PJSbQwVKyT-SuM85ADgWXw

Jim was kind enough to even bring us a couple of carafes of straight champagne to avoid using too much juice.

I stated how much I hate an over cooked steak. Should I do med rare or rare? So we both decided to order rare to be safe. The steak came out med at best in the middle and a solid well done throughout the rest. So my fiancé called her back. So nice and she felt horrible (as it's not like she's cooking) and the manager was nice to bring our the avocado toast as a ""im sorry"" . Mind you I'm kinda getting full from the food we had so far, so I only had a piece. The new steak come out and I'm so disappointed. One maybe two bites had any red at all. The waitress checked and I told her. She felt bad but I told her my guy would eat it for breakfast. If you're a steak house and cannot get a filet right I just don't think it gets a good rating.

5837476,2015-11-23,5,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"My one dinner here met with mixed results, but on the whole this fairly new restaurant in Downtown Summerlin shows much promise.  Yet it appears to not be very accommodating, based on the three examples I encountered, as follows: 1) Despite great pics of French Onion Soup on Yelp, the dish has been killed for the season.  Why?  Winter is almost here, and hot soup seems in order.  2) No anchovies are available to be added to a Caesar Salad.  3)  The kitchen declined to make a Loaded Baked Potato without chives or to put cheese and bacon inside a cooked spud.  3)  A request for two checks for one table was rejected.

But these grumblings aside, a Gem Lettuce Salad was large and excellent, accompanied by very good Sourdough Bread.  And my Harris Ranch Prime Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered.  Three fine sauces, including Bearnaise and Peppercorn, harmonized nicely with the flavorful meat, and I enjoyed the cooked Shishito Peppers that came with the Filet.  

But our server did not initially seem to understand the concept of Drawn Butter, and we were asked if we wanted an ordered Lobster Tail to share warm or cold.  This was eventually sorted out, and our Lobster Tail did arrive warm with Drawn or Melted Butter.  But inexplicably the lobster did not reach our table until about 20 minutes after the Filet.  Miraculously the Filet stayed warm throughout this waiting period.  And the Lobster was sweet and worth waiting for.  Roasted Organic Mushrooms, thick Asparagus Spears, and a side of Classic Mac & Cheese with a 5-cheese blend and breadcrumbs enhanced a delicious meal that was topped off by custard-filled Donuts that were every bit as good as described by other reviewing Yelpers.

Good live music in the form of a singer and guitar player added to a pleasant and casual yet refined contemporary atmosphere.  To their credit, without any request for same, the manager and our waitress did take the Lobster Tail off the bill.   

I was told that Onion Soup Gratinee will at some point return to the menu.  And my food was excellent enough to prompt a return.

Came with a group of friends and we ordered a variety of dishes. I tried the 12 oz ribeye at medium rare. It was cooked more medium than rare, but regardless, the cut wasn't very good. Dry and it was served lukewarm. Given the $$$ price for this steak, I was expecting a lot more. But then again, this isn't a steakhouse, right?

I also tried some of the appetizers and sides. The french fries were very good. Crispy outer and soft mushy inner. Not sure if I would come back just for the fries, but order it. The fried artichokes tasted like, well, artichokes, Quite standard. The calamari was underwhelming, especially given the price. Tasted similar to what you would find at any chain restaurant. The mac and cheese dish was creamy and cheesy, and I enjoyed this dish. The cheese quality was up there.

The drinks are ""steakhouse"" pricing so expect to fork over some change to enjoy a shot of Scotch.

I did try a bite of the 20 oz Cowboy ribeye and, yes, it was tasty. Nice marbling, smokey flavor, and very tender. Maybe I ordered the wrong dish.

Service was attentive, but food took a little longer than expected. Our dessert, creme brûlée donuts tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp for an hour.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,5,2,3,TWCmt_Tu2hqKCSZhrVHMZg

We arrived early to avoid any crowds, with a 5:30 reservation.  The place was pretty empty, with only a couple other diners there.  Upon arrival, our waiter, asked for drinks and served them.  He had trouble either listening or understanding requests, as my mother had wanted ice in her juice and didn't get it...and he seemed to question our requests.  Not sure what was going on there.  Anyway, we all decided pretty quickly what we wanted, as the menu is super limited and there are no specials to heat about.  We were told, 'the whole menu is special'.  Turn off!  My husband had a salad with his meal and ordered an appetizer.   He got the calamari.  Upon arrival, it looked ok with the typical small round pieces and some other larger, flat pieces, that didn't look natural.  He ate a few pieces and said there was something wrong with it.  He didn't enjoy it at all so when they came to remove his salad plate he told them to remove the calamari and told them there was something wrong with it.  We sat and talked together for at least an hour while waiting for our meals.  It was getting obnoxious, esp considering how early we arrived and got our order in.  Then, when they finally walked out with food, they only had three plates and apologized that the last steak order got messed up and that they were firing it.  I couldn't believe it.  By then, with lack of attentiveness by our server and the long wait times, this place was quickly becoming a place we would never visit again.  I made clear my dissatisfaction to our server that after all this time they wouldn't bring all the meals together, but the last one quickly arrived.  The steaks were good.  Mine was ordered med rare, but was rare, so that was disappointing.  I ordered with asparagus and none of the ends were cut off so the last 3"" of each stalk was inedible because it was so stringy.  My husband ordered the pork chop and it had an awful sauce on top....it was very bitter with the texture of jelly.  The chop itself was good.  The other steak was really good as was the fish dish.  The food wasn't all awful, but with the service lacking so bad, it surely doesn't make you want to ever visit again.  After the meals, dessert menus were dropped, but we didn't want any, as we had now been there 2.5hrs to have a meal.  Those menus sat on the table for another very long time before anyone came back to ask us if we wanted any....and it wasn't even our server.  He never came back to the table again to ask how things were (as I think he already knew).....and we just asked for the check so we could leave.  We will personally never dine at this establishment again due to horrible service and wait times for the meal.  PS.

However, the remainder of the food was not as impressive. It was good, with fresh ingredients and well cooked, however nothing really stood out. I had the Yellowtail Crudo - which was fresh but nothing special, Skirt Steak - a little over-cooked for medium, and meat was only ok, and finished with Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts - which sadly did not impress me any more than a krispy kreme donut would.

5928071,2015-03-14,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"Wow! First Friday night for the new Andiron and it was pretty busy.  We normally don't try a new place so soon after opening so they can work out the kinks but we couldn't  resist. 

Let's start with the atomsphere...gorgeous! Soothing colors yet a hip vibe gave the place a very upscale but not at all stuffy feel like some other high-end steakhouses have.  Elizabeth Blau stopped by the table herself and commented on how the didn't want to be like other steak houses.  The nailed it!

The food...really amazing! Started with the fig and burrata app.  It was like a fresh breath of spring.  Light and creamy.  I had the Waygu Skirt and hubby had the Bone-in filet.  Both flavorful and perfectly cooked. I liked the variety of steaks and preparations on the menu.  

Could leave without trying dessert...Lemon tart with the most amazing barely lime meringue and the carrot cake...moist and fantatstic.  I just want more of the vanilla sauce though.  

I love restaurants where it's not just about the food....its an experience.  Andiron is just that. Its the total package..an incredible experience.  Congrats!",je7jNOQaoOeauvgIQWQrvw,6,3,5,Ljuy-obQxVo5t0m9wleOSA

I called about a month ahead to make a reservation and the woman who answered the phone kept me on hold for 10 minutes. I mean really, 10 minutes?? I don't know if they were extremely busy the night that I called, but seriously, she didn't even apologize for making me wait! Besides, wouldn't it take less than a minute to take down my name, phone number and number of people in my party?

Located across from Lazy Dog, the restaurant is very nice and clean. I liked the green and white decor, which was calming. Service was excellent and attentive. Our server made good suggestions on the menu items, all the servers checked up on us often and we never had to ask for drink refills since they were keeping a close eye on everything.

We started off with the Nueske Bacon Wrapped Matzo Balls, which was recommended by our server. This was our first time eating matzo balls, but I thought it was alright - tasted like broth and bacon. Didn't care for the horseradish that came with it. Next, we were served complimentary shrimp cocktail. Not much to say since this tastes the same to me no matter where I go, but it did come with 2 jumbo shrimps! For the main course, I ordered the Black Canyon Ranch Filet, but I wasn't impressed. It tasted alright at first, but after a while, I didn't like the after taste of a burnt steak. Guess I'm really not a fan of char grilled steaks! My husband ordered the Porterhouse, which wasn't horrible but not amazing. I was excited to try the mac & cheese waffle, but it was not as good as it looked. Kind of on the salty side and I am glad that I had them leave the cheese sauce on the side because it wasn't needed. Now to the best part - dessert! The Peanut Butter & Pretzel Caramel Cheesecake was very delicious! The presentation was very unique and did not look like the average cheesecake. We also ordered Ashley's Creme Brulee Donuts, which were very good. The donuts were hot crispy on the outside and the creme was perfect and not overly sweet.

Overall, I enjoyed the dessert more than our dinner! I feel bad saying this, but I would rather have a steak from Outback. Don't think I will be back, but they deserve 4 stars for the service, atmosphere and dessert!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,22,23,4,PO4yx5VbB128lu_uMQAqdg
5945982,2017-11-22,2,7UFDAX4wLi6ux5otguYldA,"As much as I want to give this place 5 stars, I just can't. Unfortunately, the only pitfall is the food. They plate beautifully but it's not enough. All 5 of our dishes were bland. It just tasted like there was no seasoning. A shame because they sure are pretty. You know it's bland when the caesar salad is the most flavorful dish (thanks to the peppercorns). The octopus, fried chicken bao, burrata were prepared great but no taste whatsoever. We decided to skip dessert because we figured it would be the same. 

The decor is stunning. The service is wonderful. Servers, bussers, hostess couldn't be better trained. Pricey but they have good specials running. With such romantic lighting, you'd think they'd play more ambient music but they ruin it with Nicki Minaj and loud EDM. I bet they would sell a lot more bottles of wine if they found a lounge playlist instead.",RArQt74He3Ok8asTRUw2FQ,7,3,3,BFMS9LY0cu8vNupcHg8Hxg

The food was delicious. I really loved their oysters and avocado toast. I got the prime rib dinner which was very tender. Overall, the setting and food was great and I would recommend this place if anyone has a birthday, anniversary, or for anyone who wants a really good prime rib.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,1,5,k71l1mynn8pMpTNLitokIg
