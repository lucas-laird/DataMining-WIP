1052580,2015-08-28,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"I just read many of the reviews and will say I have always had a different experience here. I order online 100% of the time and get a 15-20 minute ready time. I also always pick it up myself, which seems to be other yelpers main complaint. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes after arrival and that is usually just because of other customers in front of me. 

My pizzas have always been hot and taste like the Pizza Hut pizzas I have enjoyed for many years in Las Vegas. 

I guess a suggestion for other customers would be to order online and pick it up yourself. It seems the delivery service and quality control for delivery is this location's downfall. The pizzas taste better from Pizza Hut than most other pizza restaurants and I would bet the ratings here would improve if delivery service could be managed better.",tro7QPz1REVlVCB4W1Ehxw,0,1,4,My87HbHcNx0VN0iH8BWILQ
1286117,2016-02-14,1,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"I originally picked delivery while ordering online but it read 1hr 40min-1hr 50min estimated delivery time. Carry out was only 20 min. My husband decided to pick it up instead and he said customer service was great. Food was ready at the time indicated online. 

I ordered the garlic knots pizza, traditional hot wings, and fries.  The garlic knots were good. They come with marinara dipping sauce and I also used the garlic butter sauce. The fries were amazing!!!!  We should have gotten 2 orders cause they went fast!  It actually over powered the pizza. Overall great Saturday late night spontaneous order. Next time we are just ordering wings and fries!",3o8c_R-Kv5UOoXXuMEOZAw,3,2,4,TGbbN9bd44sXmYnD-Vw8EQ
1562670,2014-10-15,1,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,I'm only giving one star because I have to. The pizza tookover an hour to get to our house and it was supposed to be delivered in 30 minutes. Also nobody answered the phones it just kept ringing. Worst service ever,W0OuF3zmpkh78kLRAKS66w,0,0,1,n77E_Pd2EkRZCAUt6qHC1w
2367688,2018-03-10,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"Honestly wish it was possible to give a negative rate to this location. I called to complain about my pizza having a whole fly melted into it and the GM Jospeh sounded so sarcastic while helping me. He said he'd like to hear the ""truth"" in my voice because he receives a lot of suspicious calls about people lying about their pizzas. 
I don't have time to make up some story to get money back or a free pizza! I called because this is disgusting, I normally don't order from this location and this is the first and last time.",okI7NJPYDE9upDyDjHTHXQ,1,0,1,6FYMBnxlatrW-SwQBUIjlA
3462965,2015-04-25,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"We have been longtime customers that have overlooked the crappy service and errors in our orders for the last three years. Tonight was the final straw. Our order was scheduled to be delivered at 5pm. We received a call at 5:20 notifying us that they were unable to make one of our pizzas because they were out of ingredients (on a Friday night... great planning, guys). Not only is the delivery NOT arriving on time but the pizzas haven't even been MADE yet. Hey, Pizza Hut -- it's totally NOT okay to call your customer almost 30 minutes AFTER expected delivery time to notify them about something you should have immediately known when the order was placed over an hour ago, especially if you don't even attempt to apologize or rectify the situation. We were forced to cancel the order because of time constraints and my family wasn't able to eat dinner before my husband and I had to leave for work. We won't be back...ever. Fortunately we have a better pizzeria down the street that we will be ordering from from here on out: http://www.linospizzavegas.com",myC_mD2WIkvpcJb1wFnV1g,0,0,1,Xle3T2ifaYQVZ1W_V_IhJA

3544931,2017-01-31,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,I'm sitting inside of Pizza Hut st the 7000 block of west Ann Rd. How do I say this? This is the 3rd time calling this Pizza Hut. Each time I hung up because the message was everyone is busy please wait. This time I decided to come into the store. What do you think I found? There's only one (1) person working this carry out. This is totally unexceptable. I've had Pizza Hut before so I'm going to say that Pizza is/ was ok. To operate with only 1 person making the Pizza and working the register is totally out of line. I really wanted Pizza Hut but I will never ever bring my business to this store again. Customer service at this store is in the sewer for this store. Placed my order at 4:17 PM. It's 4:45 PM an the phone hasn't stop ringing. The guy on duty can't answer because he's trying to fill the 6 pending orders.,XlkDFYDDtleyetEEBkw4QQ,0,0,1,zMbbSMFGY-nu9Dds-4b74g
3960330,2015-06-05,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"This place's service is so bad it's beyond my imagination. I have been a pretty loyal customer for the past couple years despite the extremely slow delivery. Lets just say that this place never delivered my pizza according to the time estimate given online. So for the past few times, my pizza will arrive on average an hour and half after ordering. This isn't a total deal breaker for me because the pizza made here is usually good.

I ordered a little late today so instead of ordering 2 hours ahead, i did 40 minutes and chose carryout. The online time confidently estimated that i will be able to pick it up after 18 minutes. I know its BS so i didnt go there until 40 minutes after I placed the order. When I got there, no one was at the front so I stood there and just chillaxed for about 5 minutes. In that 5 minutes, i could hear these two workers just went berserk with cuss words. It was actually pretty funny but that just shows you the quality of the management here. 

This girl finally showed up. She obviously didnt want to be there. After i gave her name for the pick up, she literally went silent for an extremely long time. I was like, soooooooooooo, then all of sudden, she said to me ""your pizza is either not yet cooked or cooking, 18 minutes."" I didnt know what to say so I was like ok? Then she proactively said to me did you want to cancel your order. At this point, i have lost all my appetite. I told her yeah cancel it. I guess I wasnt expecting an apology and surely there wasnt one. 

I was really speechless. How can a franchiae business be this mismanaged is simply beyound my imagination.",96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,0,0,1,JWUMV29kRQ8Ug8zwpVkAew

I had stopped ordering from this Pizza Hut was driving to Durango location cause this place was so horrible. These last two orders have been great. I ordered before noon always HOT.

5198386,2018-04-29,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,This place is absolutely bull s**t how can it possibly take 2 hours to make a pizza and chicken wings and deliver it when i live at most 10 minutes away. On top of taking that long the pizza was cold chicken was cold no sauce for breadsticks whoever's in charge needs to be replaced.

5574047,2013-01-13,0,V4BYvw51GBAj7pv2n7XtOw,"Horrible service. Ordered online and there was no verification that a 1+ hour wait was ok. No way to cancel. Actually too 1:35 minutes, was cold, undercooked wings, pizza wasn't even fully cut (needed a knife). Called to complain and all the manager said was that it got a little crazy.
