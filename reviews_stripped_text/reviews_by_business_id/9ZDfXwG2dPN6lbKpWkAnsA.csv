So let's start with the pro's of this experience.
The chicken burger was flavorful, moist, and a significant serving size.  The cheesy fries were good but got soggy from the amount of cheese that was in the serving. 

Now with the cons. 
The Big Veg wasn't worth the $12 that it hyped up to be online or the advertisement. Didn't realize it was actually a ""curry burger "" so if you don't like curry, try the original. The serving size was decent and the burger itself was moist. 

The service at the booth during this Vegefest was 1 out of 10. The line was an hour long. No joke we actually stood in line for just about an hour. There was one register open and the the girl behind the register was nice but not efficient enough to work a booth. It takes hustle to work quickly and efficiently at a festival booth and many don't have the ability to master this. There were about 4 employees that actually seemed to have the hustle needed to work something like this. I stood and watched the entire operation and seems as though this business could use a great deal of consulting on efficiency and working smarter. Many customers opted to forego waiting in line so that could actually do damage to profit. I asked why there wasn't a second line for orders to eliminate this hour wait and she stated ""they planned to have another open but the girl called in"". Well okay. At this point designate another person for this or better yet as a business owner, at this point, it's time to roll up your sleeves and dig in when you see help is needed. However, the owner stood off to the side and watched cluelessly as his employees scrambled to make sense of what to do with this massive rush. I suggested maybe have another employee start taking orders in the line to eliminate some of this unnecessary wait and she commented ""then the cook will get backed up"". Hmm. Okay again. I continued to watch this management team (owners primarily) stand around and look like the deer in the headlights as customers complained to the point of getting free French fries for the inconvenience. Funny how the business owners wife stood by and just watched this chaos without lifting a finger and/ or offer to help out. So sad. Sometimes people are more concerned with looking good rather than being good. 

In all no way, at this point in time, would I recommend any of these $12 burger options. Given the lack of service and inadequate management I could not justify making any recommendation. Hopefully this operation will get better and maybe invest in a business consultant to get it together.",xH9ayUnUDQBjYZxsHSsj1Q,1,0,1,5pSgRLWaCvNNH9ldiZc6pA

Created by Kelly and assisted by his team (including the helping hands of Chef Mayra of former Pura Vida) of compassion comes Vegas' first taste of veg fast food.

Our first visit was on opening day and there was a huge line, we waited about 20? minutes in line and their card system and register system ran out out of paper. No worries we had cash.

We tried all three sandwiches and we split an order of fries. 

The All-American was good but I would suggest adding mushrooms. It kinda has a smoky flavor, which we are not real keen on.

The Chicken Sandwich reminded me of a Gardien chkn cutlet, light in flavor and the ciabatta bun complimented it well. I dipped it in a mustard aioli and it was yum.

The shining star for me was the Spicy Black Bean. It's not spicy, has great yummy flavors and was super moist/fresh not gooey or too firm. BB's are hard not to get a crumbled paddy so I really like this a lot. Now I think the menu said it comes with avocado but for some reason mine didn't have it. Maybe they ran out?

From what I saw the fries were just bagged Alexia organics. Now I'm not sure why they didn't choose hand cut organic, but maybe they ran out prior to our order.

As far as drinks my husband got a lemon/lime soda and I got a box of water.

Rumor has it that a brick and mortar is coming to The Lakes...but I don't have any more info on that.

Great start for compassionate fast food.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,9,5,4,aTJoSPJP0kHM-Kgsl5aBcw

The burgers are great. They're juicy and comedy hot and extremely well seasoned. The fries are awesome. The plain fries are a little greasy but I like my fries on the soft side. I love the curly fries and the sweet potato fries. The shakes taste like regular shakes. I love the chocolate and strawberry ones the best. They're sweet and the strawberry one tastes like strawberry cake. Also the chicken wrap is really good. And the popcorn chicken was a favorite with my daughter when we went. 
The burgers have a sauce on them that they say is like thousand island but I think it's sweeter. Still yummy though.
I still need to try the fish tacos and the beef sandwich. Everything I've had there, I've loved though. There's a drive through, it's easy to get to from the 215 and the staff are very nice! Chef Kenny has done it again!!
Go try it out if you haven't yet. You won't be disappointed!!",PvjhL1-v-H5fk4x4sN6j_g,0,0,5,m3CZ192--lHziDeSK7rsxg

Her old restaurant Pura Vida was my FAVORITE so I decided this place had to be good too. I ordered the black bean burger with garlic aioli...Yes yes yes!!! This is what a vegan burger should taste like! Too often vegan burgers are bland, but this one was spiced to perfection! I look forward to trying their other burgers as well.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,5,3,5,p6MO2_FIPln-DwoY8kBHZA
5096333,2016-06-13,0,9ZDfXwG2dPN6lbKpWkAnsA,"So excited for another vegan/veg restaurant! I have ordered all the burgers (all American, Black Bean and 'Chicken') with my favorite being the All American (with added tempeh bacon and avocado.... Yum!). Their fries are amazing... And I love the options as you get 2 sauces for your fries. I've found my fave to be the chipotle ketchup. My only problem is.... I devour the fries immediately  The food is very fresh and all organic ingredients are used! Where else can you get 'healthy' fast food? I have taken my carnivorous friends there and they have all become addicted. Looking forward to more menu additions in the future and possible store location",hXOHumtKuh0180dT6VV_oQ,1,1,5,6zIsOL5PrX1v1W0KTHxchg
