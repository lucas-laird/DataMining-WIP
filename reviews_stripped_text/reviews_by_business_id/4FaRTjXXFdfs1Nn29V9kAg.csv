Atmosphere is good, the decor is great. Great lightning not too bright not too dark. 

So about the ramen. The broth is great, all the veggies on top are amazing..some of the sweetest bamboo shoots I've had which is a plus for me. The noodles are usually fantastic...sometimes they are hit or miss being a little clumped. Coming with a few roasted garlics on top is in my opinion a fantastic addition. The pork is like the noodles almost always great but sometimes it's perfectly tender or a little tough but always full of great flavor. 

The main reason this got a 4/5 star review is the hit or miss pork/noodles. And what seems to be tap water (which is extremely subjective) 

The speed at which the ramen is served is absolutely phenomenal another bonus. Comparable prices to other ramen places, if not a little bit better.

While Ramen-Tatsu, And Sora are two of my favorites the convenience of not having to drive on spring mountain and the fact this place is so close to my house, the convenience of that alone makes this place a much easier pick for me.

I hope this place continues to grow a good clientele, and succeed.",MI7IJHdWfX70XbaofFTo4Q,8,1,4,7UCyY2XrETYxtaQhVlVMxQ
1191283,2018-02-18,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"I would rate this place a zero, if it were possible.  In reality, the almost nonexistent menu, is really just one dish.  If you add or subtract broth and meat the entire menu is a pork ramen dish served with or without broth.  Incredibly asinine.  Coupled with an inattentive staff on a slow time, this is a business that will quickly disappear.  Another disappointment was their 'new kale noodles' which you could not order.  Wait a minute!  This is a new restaurant on its opening week with very little traffic.  Yikes!

Broth is nice and light. Noodles are good and firm. I ordered some takoyaki and that was good too.  

Not too many people in this place as well when I went there around 6-ish. That would be a good thing if you're with a crowd as they will be able to accommodate you faster.  

The place is somewhat trendy. They were playing some music which sounds like that Japanese string instrument. I honestly liked it. Adds to the vibe.

Other than that, my suggestion is to further develop the broth.

Also tried the karaage chicken and it was amazing. It had a bold flavor and was very tender and juicy (not dry). I will definitely be trying the place out again for a different style of ramen and will bring more friends. 

The staff is friendly/attentive and the restaurant is very inviting.

1682359,2018-02-15,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"Can't tell you how EXCITED I am about Ramen on this side of town. So tired of driving to actual Japan (Spring Mtn) for any ramen at all, let alone good ramen. My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's day and we were 2 out of 4 people in the whole restaurant so the service was very quick. I think it took less than 5 minutes actually. 

We both ordered the Black Garlic, 1 spicy and 1 regular. BE ADVISED: the level 1 spicy is an experience. And I mean I get it, some people like to watch their mouth burn. Literally. So maybe this won't be so bad for you. But for me, your average hot wing kind of dude? This spicy ramen elevated my high by at least 100%. Anyways, try spicy if you're brave. And if you get extra spicy then don't even talk to me.

The dish itself was great all around. What a presentation- color and arrangement were traditional yet unique. Flavor good, texture of the pork was the perfect mix of meaty and chewy, the (regular) broth tasted like it took hours to prepare which I love. The egg was nothing special but it doesn't need to be because it's an egg and the minute you expect more out of eggs is the minute you have officially gone too far. I mean just order the extra spicy already why don't you. 

The noodles were cooked just right. I've had enough ramen experiences where the noodles were a game changer for all the wrong reasons and this was a nice refresher. They didn't break up in the bowl as I was mixing, had a nice color, and were packed with a rich pork flavor.

And finally, we had the Sake. We got the ""300ml Premium Sake"". It's about the size of a Coronita if you're not the measuring type of person. Now I'm no sake connoisseur but this went down super smooth. It was fruity and delicious and I would have more if I didn't have to drive.

If you couldn't tell by now, get the ramen. Don't go to a ramen house and order a rice bowl. Who does that? Get the ramen or go to Panda Express or something.",NZInok33qPu_6B5k2YHb7Q,2,2,5,mF-vXV-u280WA7E7BD5k3Q

Finally finding time to sit I ordered Tonkatsu Ramen. Broth was light and clean. Not too fatty. The Chashu was nice. Comes with half an egg. Portion is much bigger than it is when you take to go.

1924074,2018-05-20,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"It was a rainy day afternoon in Vegas and hubby and I thought it's a great idea to have ramen for dinner and we ended up at this modern-chic Japanese place that serves delicious and yummy ramen Flamingo and 215.

We tried their Tokoyaki as appetizer and it was actually our first time to try one so we basically don't know how it should taste like or what flavor profile we are looking for. I ate majority of the tokayaki, hubby didn't really like the mayo-ish sauce. 
In terms of their Ramen, I ordered their Tonkatsu (my go to ramen broth) with pan fried kimchi and the kimchi really blends well with the tonkatsu broth that gave an added flavor to it. Hubby, got the Niku Ramen extra spicy and boy, oh boy, they are really spicy. We both finished our bowl of ramen and it really hit the spot.

Service was good and the place was not yet crowded when we stopped by so it was perfect because we don't have to wait to be seated to enjoy a delicious Ramen.

I ordered the Black Garlic ramen and my husband ordered the Miso Ramen with extra pork. We had our kids there and they ordered the fried rice, the fries, and the kids meal ramen. I tried all of it and it was all quite good!  

Totally a hidden gem and I will be coming back again!  My favorite was their eggs!  I love it!! I don't want to always drive to Chinatown just to get some ramen!

1989400,2018-02-26,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"I'm sad that Jumping Rice and Roll no longer exists. From what I understand, KoKoRo is owned by the same owners but instead of sushi and fried rice/noodles, it's all about the ramen now. They did keep a few things from the Jumping Rice menu including chicken mayo don, edamame, and garlic edamame. 

Onto the food: 

KoKoRo Japanese style French fries: Please DO NOT get this. I could've easily made this at home. It was frozen French fries (and not even the good kind) drizzled with okonomi and mayo sauce. This was such a disappointment.

Shoyu original ramen: I actually enjoyed the taste of this broth. You can definitely taste the pork and it wasn't salty. It comes with 2 slices of pork. My suggestion would be to maybe cook them a bit longer so it's more tender and soft? They were pretty chewy. 

Miso (spicy) ramen: my brother got this and I had a taste of his broth. Wasn't a fan of this one. The spicy level was too much for me and the taste of the miso wasn't a favorite of mine. It had an odd taste to it and I just can't put my finger on it. 

The ramen were cooked more on the al dente side so if you like your noodles more soft, make sure to let the servers know. 

Service was attentive and the 2 girls that were working treated us well.

2342534,2018-02-26,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"First time at this Ramen place. We were greeted once we walked in and given a table. Shortly after a group of four was sat down near us. We ordered with the waiter, and our drinks were put in and given right away. Now this is where it went south. The waiter and waitress were running circles around each other, and werent clear. Our soups were given to the wrong people and me and my husband knew right away. Took them a while to figure it out tho and just kept giving the other group our stuff. Finally after 10-15 mins they come up to us and say sorry there was a mix up. Okay I get it, this is a new place Ill give them the benefit of the doubt. Now after another 10 minutes or more they bring my husbands soup. He decides to wait till mine comes out. We wait basically until his soup is cold and still don't have my meal. Not once did they come tell me it will be right out. 

Obviously they saw that he was waiting for me and ended up finally bringing my meal and a new one for him which was nice and we appreciated it. 

Overall it was a very frustrating experience. They tried to make it better and thats appreciated. 

The food was okay not really worth the trouble, We hope the best for this company but they definitely need some better organization whether its table assignments per waiter or something and more communication with customers.",YoWeAeYRzSDA7FD2wKloTg,0,0,2,cUQ3J29-90s_-0YW7JlJ_A

I was close to a 4 but not quite there. Service was fine but honestly overly in-your-fcae.   Might be because there was only one other table occupied so servers were bored and trying to work, but it's a little intrusive when my water is being filled whenever it's 1/3 done and I'm being asked how everything is when a have a mouth full of noodles. 

The tonkatsu ramen, extra spicy, had good broth.  Pretty spicy and not too much meaty flavor.  The chasu was some of the best I've had in town - thick and fatty, almost like pork belly.  The noodles were very average and food store quality.  The rest of the ramen sides were probably below average, just raw ingredients and boiled egg rather than the good ramen-style egg.  My biggest peeve was that the extra spicy addition was $0.75 cents.  At that price, I want my face to burn, but it wasn't more than just chili oil.  

KoKoRo seems pretty good for a quick ramen or takeout, especially when there's not many options in that area, but not in the top 5 by any means in Vegas.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,1,0,3,I4D2L2Unv6F8LKXwLbNZFA

I ordered the spicy miso ramen because it comes with everything I order extra at other places, corn and a soft boiled egg.
My boyfriend ordered the black garlic oil ramen spicy.

I can handle A LOT of spice so just so you know spicy is like a mild.
So for me it wasn't spicy enough but I started slow and wanted to not overdo it on my first try.
My only minor complaint was the miso ramen was supposed to come with garlic and I didn't see it anywhere :(

I also prefer the ground pork that comes in Ramen Sora and Kobo, because it sticks to the noodles and creates more texture and flavor so I hope they add that as an add on option.
That would make this place even better for me personally.

The service was great, and we were seated in a personal booth that was intimate which I like. We were quickly served the Chasu rice bowl to start with. I really enjoyed the combo of the saltiness of the meat and the balance of the onions and rice together. For the main course, I definitely preferred the Spicy Garlic Ramen because it was more savory and salty compared to the Miso Ramen, which was a bit sweeter of a broth. My partner preferred the miso, so it's all to your preference. You can tell the noodles aren't made fresh, but it didn't ruin the meal.

4236930,2018-06-20,0,4FaRTjXXFdfs1Nn29V9kAg,"There's many things to be said about a great Ramen Ramen place. This place's advantage. Its close to my Dad's place. And he loves Ramen, so do I. So why three stars? Well let me walk you through it. 

The place itself how should I describe it. It is relatively small. They made the front of the restaurant into a waiting area which I think would've been better as a place for more tables. Not that the place was swarming with people. Its just that it gives off that vibe of wasted space. Its totally up to the owners but that's just my opinion. The overall ambience is nice. There was a party of 12 people across from Me and my Dad and even with a small shop it didn't seem to noisy. My guess is that the place can sit maybe 28 people. But how they have their tables arranged doesn't look too cramped. Unlike some other shops where it feels like you're a sardine packed in a can, all for the sake of Ramen. 

Service, let's talk about that. Not too shabby. There were two servers up at the time we visited. My guess is they were still getting used to working at the place because they seemed shy at approaching us. I don't bite, well unless you're made out of Noodles that is. Nothing bad though, like I said the place is new. I'm pretty sure by the time the shop kicks up the servers will probably be more acquainted with what they need to do. We got our waters pretty fast although I always try and see if they have Calpico. Which they did, not refillable though. And here I though my fatass found a gem. The food took a bit of time due to the larger party versus just me and my dad. Unless you take an hour to serve a bowl of Ramen, I don't think that's an issue. And one of the best parts about this restaurant. The chopsticks man! Yes the chopsticks! Holy cannoli(sorry I know this is a Japanese restaurant) I mean to each his own but one thing I absolutely hate about being served wooden chopsticks is when you dine out with ither people. They start rubbing the sticks together like they're trying to light a fire. I mean come on! And the same excuse every single time ""I don't want splinters."" Unless you're purposely rubbing the stick on your gums as hard as you can you will not get splinters. Sorry about the rant. They have plastic Chopsticks. That's where I was getting to. And they look kind of fancy too. The tip is kind of rough to hold the food better. But this isn't a chopstick review isn't it. Moving on. 

The food, hmmm how do I put it? There's parts I like and parts I don't fancy. So granted I only ordered one bowl of Ramen then a bowl of Katsu with rice I've noticed a few things. I would need to come back a few more times to really nail the food review down but here's my two cents. I ordered the Shoyu based broth. The taste, there's better places. But its a really close competitor to my favorite Ramen place. The noodles have some chew to them. Not as chewy as I would like them to be but not bad. The standout in my bowl of ramen would be the Chashu, it was tasty. It tasted like it was seared a bit before serving. Either that or the chef has mad Chashu skills. If I would come back to this place, I would pile on the Chashu. Seriously, it was that good. Don't quote me though. I'm not picky with food. Just a guy who likes things that are tasty. Onto the rice bowl. I ordered their Mayo Chicken. At least that's what it looked to me. I don't have a menu on hand while I'm writing this review. Stop it, I'm not a food critic. Just some dude who likes Ramen shops. The chicken katsu was diced up with some mayo put on top. I would prefer the katsu to be whole. That's just me though. The portion for the rice bowl was pretty big. The dish itself is tasty but I couldn't finish it. I was already full, it had nothing to do with the taste. I still wished their calpico was refillable though. 

Overall I would say this place can become a competitor but its still new so not a lot of people know it yet. I'll come back a few more times since I'm interested to what they have t",34AkcX5nFt12oE5-Sfx-Nw,0,0,4,8I1CF9uCoboK1W7PwMlVKA

The best thing in my black garlic ramen was the chashu, really excellent bbq quality and thick.  The broth was mediocre and only warm from the beginning so it was cold by the time I was halfway through the bowl, this is a big negative for me.  Nice amount of whole roasted garlic chunks.  I'm pretty spoiled by all the house-made noodle joints we have now in Vegas, so I didn't really like the noodles here - it's a thicker and chewy style, similar to those packs you can buy at the grocery.  The ramen is plenty filling, you get a sufficient amount of noodles and the broth is a thick, rich, fatty style.  My husband got the spicy and said it was equivalent to Kobo medium spicy level.

Chicken karaage was alright, just a little plain.  Takoyaki was good, cooked through properly.  I would probably come here again if I were primarily needing a ramen place with a lot of appetizer & side dish options.",0DGh3LaLFDDES3OtOqGq1w,3,0,3,uOZSgikXdyvpZCF6TJ3dRQ

walking up to the restaurant.. they had this awesome ""ramen life"" poster on their store front.. right away i had a feeling this place was going to be awesome..

walking in.. got greeted by our host / waiter.. and sat us right away.. since it wasn't too busy.. (dinner time) - im sure this place will start getting busy very soon.. 

decor was very nice and very simple.. they do have cool wall art decoration towards the bathroom.. and the lighting was a little bit dark and the lights were a little bit dim.. so all you ""must take a picture of my food before eating it"" people.. maybe use a flash or little spot light to get that nice lighting effect.. (or sit somewhere else - we were towards the back by the bathroom).. or go during the day??

when i usually ramen.. i go for the black garlic style ramen if they have it.. or i ask for black garlic oil.. this place had a dedicated black garlic ramen.. (vampires beware).. awesome !

also ordered a chashu bowl - what they call ""chasudon"" and an order of gyoza because why not.. their prices are very reasonable !!

everything tasted awesome and exceeded my expectations... my wife (who ordered the same thing) thought that it was too ""garlic-y"" (must be a vampire).. but i did not mind at all.. maybe add some butter or vinegar.. if you don't like too ""garlic-y""

water was very cold and filtered.. 

the host/waiter provided great service.. (refilling my water.. asking if we want anything else.. getting vinegar for my wife.. etc...)

Then one night, we decided to eat somewhere different because sometimes going to Chinatown can be a real headache.

When we walked in, only one table was occupied and the restaurant was very clean. As I was browsing the menu, the food didn't appeal to me. I know I'm being petty, but my preference is to keep things simple. Throwing 7 different toppings on ramen may make it look pretty, but it doesn't make the taste excellent. Unfortunately, they also didn't have any toppings that I usually eat with my ramen. Would have preferred (and paid for) other options like kamaboko, beef, or even tofu. But you can't have everything, right? NBD, I ended up ordering the Miso Ramen with just chasu and corn. The broth was just okay. It wasn't the best that I tasted, but it also wasn't super bland or disappointing. Did not like their thick noodles and the fatty charsu. One more thing I have to add is that we tried the Kokoro Japanese Style Fries, which looked good from the photos here on yelp. Guess I wasn't a fan of the Oknomi sauce, which made it kind of sweet. For me, fries should not taste sweet for any reason, lol.

Considering that they just opened, I will cut them some slack and since also this is the closest Ramen place in the south west, so I really do want them to improve coz there is a high chance I will come back. I was about to give them 4 stars, but had decided on 3 stars based on these factors.
- the shoyu broth- though it did not look like shoyu, it looked more like a tonkatsu, they explained that it is because they use a pork broth base.. this was the best broth out of all that we ordered. This one was just right.
-the black garlic ramen, was a tad bit salty, although still good flavor
-the kids Ramen the broth was horrible, it was way way way too Salty, this made it almost inedible to me, though my nephew devoured his
-the chicken karrage had good flavor, but it seemed  like it was not quite cooked, it looked a tad bit pinkish and raw, although the flavor was good, just maybe need to be cooked a little bit more
- the chashu pork was not as good as other places though.. it seemed like they used just a regular pork belly, it was ok, but it was not melt in your mouth delicious chashu pork 

So with a few minor adjustments, this new ramen place has a potential to become a 5 star place for me, I would like to try their rice dishes next time since I did like jumping rice.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,2,0,3,u0noynBxC1CkPSf8qAL_Ww
