The manager got back to me and was extremely helpful and kind. That was the kind of customer service that I was looking for. I gave it a bad rating initially due to customer service but, after the manager reached out to me, I felt much better about coming back to this place. 

The place is delicious. Food and smoothies. I love the peanut butter smoothie. After the gym, the food here doesn't make you feel heavy. It is not greasy and although it is healthy food, it tastes amazing. I seriously recommend people come and try it.",9ZPv9euFZBH0afD9nZZ5Uw,1,1,4,eunE6w9nhrp1nZcF59-N7g
143493,2016-05-27,2,LvNQkpggm72kJUTzO0juWQ,I really like the location on Grand Canyon. They've always been consistent and I've always left pleased. Today I went to the location on Durango and didn't know if I wanted to laugh or complain the entire time. I walked in and wasn't greeted by anyone. I stood at the counter for 2 minutes and watched everyone. A young man even came out from behind the counter to get himself water. I said hi and he didn't even look my way. After a few minutes I was able to order. When they brought my food out.. My salmon was the size of a lemon wedge. Literally. I ordered a protein shake as well and didn't receive it until right before I left. The gentleman who made it for me apologized for my wait. So I can live with that. But not the best experience I've had to say the least.,6fBV8MB549fA5G1NmtRkVg,7,1,3,mI0EAB7bbzr4ZmRCwkwaiA

I have been to the new Durango location 5 times now and 4 out of the 5 times they have messed up our orders. It's as if they were never trained on how to do their jobs. There's no process to how they do things there. They have messed up too many times now so I have to say something. I was in line to order and a second cashier came up and asked the girl behind me what she wanted and completely ignored me, that same day my order was wrong. Another time they gave 3 people that ordered after me their shakes and food and forgot to make mine so I had to wait even longer to get my order. My girlfriend and I ordered together, I waited like 10 minutes for my food, was half way done eating and they never brought hers out. I asked them where her food was and they looked at each other like, I don't know, do you know? Shrugged their shoulders and said sorry will have to make it. Waited another 10 minutes. Come to find out, they gave another girl her order to go, the other girl's order was sitting at the counter in a bag, the other girl left and came back cause she realized she had the wrong order, they gave her the old order. I asked for no peppers on my wrap and they put peppers on the wrap. The food also seems to be made a little different each time. They messed up and gave us the wrong shake one time so they had to make another one. The last time I was there, I finally said something and the girl told me to come back in and she'd give me half off. That nice and all but you're telling me to come back in and give you more of my hard earned money. You guys screwed up and I shouldn't have to pay for your mistakes. To the owner: You should be really concerned about the day to day operations that go on in your stores cause you are losing lots of money when they mess up orders like this. There's no way I'm the only one who orders gets messed up. A mistake here and there is understandable but 4 out of 5 times in less than 3 months is not good. Get your staff and your processes in order. The staff isn't very friendly or apologetic either. They also need to be taught customer service skills. Once again, the food is great but if they mess up again, I will no longer go there to eat. We both lose out.",QVuPjCAGPRJV6bfB6np82g,1,0,2,hT70emB_rsoDqWZWhtEHrA

1240029,2017-11-03,1,LvNQkpggm72kJUTzO0juWQ,"This place is exactly what you would expect from the name, healthy options! When you arrive it's full of sunlight w/ a handful of tables inside and another handful outside. It's very clean which is a huge factor when going into any eatery, you never want to wonder. It sits in the same parking lot as the LVAC so you'll see tons of fitness people of all levels coming in for some sort of fuel. Protein Source offers a variety of healthy options. It is a fast food style ordering process where you go to the counter to order. They do however bring the food to you once it is ready. The day we came in to eat we were taken care of by Veronica. She was friendly and prompt. 

We ordered:
American Muscle (100% Pure American Bison Served Over Sweet Potato Hash, Source Veggie Mix (Broccoli Red and Green Bell Peppers, Yellow Squash and Zucchini) Then Topped Freshly Sliced Avocado and House Stevia BBQ Sauce)

Skinny Salmon Bowl (Pan Seared Salmon, Asparagus and Cherry Tomatoes Over Cauliflower Mash, Topped w/Balsamic Reduction and Cilantro Pesto)

Green House Juice (Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon)
A,C,G Juice (Apple, Carrots and Ginger)

The juices came out quickly after we ordered. Veronica was running the register, making the juices and delivering the juices/food. She made it look flawless w/ ease as customers continued to float in and none waited to have their order taken. Once the food came out she brought us our food to which we scarfed down w/ delight. I'm not a huge health foodie, but I will admit when something health actually tastes good and man did this food taste good.

The whole experience from start to finish was a delight. If you're looking for something healthy AND tastes good, you're bound to find something at the Protein Source!",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,2,1,5,L8sB-L2aRHQZgBzaeIul3A

Once when they didn't have it even started I asked to have to put in as eat in the guys says okay the girl finally after waiting about 10 mins brings out our food in a Togo bag, so I tell her it was suppose to be eat in. She says because it was a an eat 24 order it's put in as Togo so I told her when we got there we told the guy that we were eating in and he said okay and she said again because it's eat24 to get paid that's how they have to put it in. Makes no sense to me but I dropped it because I could see I was not getting anywhere. How does my order being through eat24 effect me getting it in a eat in dish when I requested it when they finally processed my order. I think if you are going to accept eat24 you should make sure you pay attention so people don't have to wait for their order as most order on their lunch break. Okay now on to the food it is absolutely amazing! I have tried too many things to mention but my favorite is the filet and eggs!

My fiance and I came here this afternoon to try a bunch of things. I ended up with The Source burger and she got a salmon bowl.

The PB Lover protein shake I got was good, but it really just tasted like milk, peanut butter, and protein powder. This is fine, but not really worth of the $8 price tag, even after working out.

Her kale juice was decent, but again the price was a bit on the high side.

My burger was overcooked and just ok. The sweet potato hash was pretty good, but the taste was monotonous. Asparagus, avacado, and bacon on the burger were good, but it was overpriced for the mediocre taste.

She couldn't eat her salmon bowl. The salmon itself was fine, but the ingredients in the bowl weren't good and made her nauseous. They added some sort of liquid to the cauliflower mash in the bowl that shouldn't have been there and made it loose and pretty gross. She ended up eating most of the salmon and throwing the rest away.

For two meals and two drinks, the bill came out to nearly $50. It's a very nice and clean location, but we will be passing on a return visit.",noZoIj8rHPHsNzMsn1HojA,1,2,2,4eBKjMD1o2sBSv2CAAmqWA

Been wanting to try their Bison Burger, so that's what I ordered! The bison patty was a good size, right amount of thickness and pretty flavorful. It was just a tad tough... cooked past medium. I guess I should've requested how I wanted my bison burger cooked which is medium rare.  Usually, Im asked what doneness you want your burger. They did ask how I wanted my egg though. Fried egg was a nice touch but overall, it was just okay meal on this visit.  It could be that I just had one fantastic grass-fed bison burger the night before at place over at Town Square. So they had raised the bar. 

It's fast casual set-up, so order and pay at the counter. Cashier was friendly and even brought my order to where I was sitting.

Their portions are a good size and are filling but still healthy and in-line with meeting my macros.  I love coming here after an intense workout and feeding my muscles.

I knocked off one star from my original review because of two things:

1) The acai bowls.  The acai bowls here sadly to say are NOT good.  Texture and taste are both off compared to acai bowl/smoothie places.
2) The wait times.  There have been a few times where I've ordered and didn't get my food until 20-25 minutes later, even when the restaurant wasn't busy.

Service is your average you order at the counter and on your own after type. My main turn off about this place is how overpriced it is vs portion. You can easily go elsewhere for cheaper meals and just as ""healthy."" If you are too lazy to cook at home after your workout and don't mind spending the money... then this place is an okay choice.",F7V-J4rJjWGwtLOcl6hFFA,0,0,3,H318kmQzPcmK02fhMOkzhQ

I ordered a turkey with spinach wrap. I took a bite and it was not was I was expecting. The turkey tasted and was grounded up like ground beef. The cheddar cheese tasted like the cheapest cheese you can use. The avocado was just thickly cut and stuffed in the wrap also. 

While I was eat and holding the wrap, I started to feel grease dripping down my hand. Gross. I only was able to eat half of the wrap

I have been to The Protein Source for just that exact reason twice now. Both times the service has been nothing but five star service. The cashier that takes your order greets you with smile, friendly, and the first time explained the menu very clearly and answered any questions had about the menu. Talk about diverse men it was really tough choose from the one time. Basically the menu broken into sections Wraps, Bowls, Acai Bowls, Breakfast, Smoothies, and Vegan dishes plus am sure missing couple more. So there really something for everyone. They are more then willing too adjust or substitutes not problem. My first time I went for the Upsidedown Loco Moco. It was ok. The Bison Patty was cooked spot on just like the egg ordered over easy. The rice for me just never worked. It more fried rice style and using jasmine rice instead of long grain rice was game changer. It had good flavor just never complimented the whole dish. But too be fair I associate Loco Moco ""808"" style so two scoops white rice, patty, egg, and gravy. One patty on top instead of two definitely feel like ordered more straight fried rice on plate. The presentations are really nice! It simple but yet elegant all on white plates and bowls that make the food stand out. 

The second visit talk about a hitting home run or totally opposite experience with the food. I ordered from the Wrap section went with the Bulk up Bison. It was AMAZING. I got the spinach wrap instead of the regular. The filling was nice and hardy. Not only was the ground up bison in bbq sauce that was spot on tasty. Add carrots and couple other things. It was a hearty burrtio/wrap. It comes with nice side bowl of house salad with house vinaigrette. Perfect combination wrap and salad. Super refreshing, light, healthy, and hearty. It also comes with side of bbq sauce.

Fan of the decor. They have one huge widescreen hanging in the corner. Few counter spots and tables inside. Not that big of place but still would say decent amount of seats for small restaurant. I love the sign on one wall with Healthy Eating Healthy Living. Stays true to the concept of the restaurant. They have no soda fountain machine. Always odd in general. I kind of like the fact that not forced cause they do sell soda. It makes me want drink water with my meal or they have four different vitamin waters on tap that can choose. They bunch of nutrition bars, cookies, and couple fresh pastries.

I never did get a call back on this place. So I cannot follow up on whether or not it's gotten any better. I hope it has. Good luck the protein source. I do hope you're vegetarian burger is much better than it was.





****UPDATE****
One of the owners wrote me. So AWESOME of them. They are revamping their veggie burger and adding a Vegan Menu. Hopefully in a month I can revisit and give a GREAT Review! At least they care enough to respond and fix the issue. GOOD LUCK!!! My review of the old menu burger is below. Again it's changing soon.



First I would like to apologize to the owner of this establishment. I don't really like to give bad reviews I just couldn't give this one a good one. There might be other people that think this place is great I just want to remind you I only had one selection off of the menu. Now to the review.. this place has a great location right next to EOS so all the gym rats, temporary Gym Rats, seasonal Gym Rats can all get something healthy to eat right after they're done working out. Place looks nice and has great decor. The staff were friendly. So far so good. I I'm vegan so I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato hash. Il also got a beverage I filled up with there Jasmine Blackberry tea. I've had a lot of veggie burgers so I'm always looking for that one that stands out. Food took about 5 minutes to get to me so timing was fine. When it was delivered it looked pretty good. Smelled all right.. but let's first talk about the consistency of the Patty. Veggie burgers by nature are more crumbly then meat burgers. This Burger was like mush on a bun. I took like three or four bites just to make sure but it was just bad. No flavor, horrible consistency. I mean it was just bad! But I thought hey sweet potato hash sounds awesome let's just dig into that and be happy about that. Wrong again. I don't even know how you can mess up sweet potatoes. But they did. It was raw / burnt/ weird taste I don't know cuz I even like when sweet potatoes have a little char to them, as it kind of caramelizes them. Their char was horrible. I tried a couple bites of that and just couldn't take it anymore. I said well lets wash it down with this beverage and it was bad too. I've never walked out before. I had already paid 14 bucks for this meal and all I could do was push away from that food and get up and leave. I didn't even want to complain to them about it. They might have other great dishes and again I didn't try those because I only had a few choices between salads, a bowl and the veggie burger. I can't say anything else other than it was bad really bad! Good luck protein source. Maybe try a different brand or even make it yourself type of burger patty. Toss the hash and just deal with the fries. And throw that tea away. I don't know if I'll go back and try them ever again. I don't want to waste another $14.",rJjcFkln3DLc29MzZSsIkw,1,0,1,fyolpBku2ZLUI5JAv5hyeA

The protein amount in these dishes are absolutely huge-you can fully expect most meals to contain anywhere from 30g to 50g of protein. Anyone that is trying to meet their macros knows this is a pretty good source of protein, hence their name, protein source.

But enough of the macro talk, let's talk about the flavor. This place is pretty damn good and any bro would agree. Anyone that has eaten prep meals knows it's tough to make a meal that's equally effective in macros and tasty. This place achieves it no problem. My favorite is their breakfast menu which is served all day.

They have everything from pancakes, burgers, bowls, waffles and more. Today I had the pleasure of eating the chicken BLTA which was equally as tasty as any of the breakfast dishes I had.

I waited probably 10 minutes when all was said and done. There were no orders in ahead of mine (except a takeout pickup that the kitchen chef must've been preparing; that was the second of the three to four aforementioned interruptions), so I can't say I was expecting to wait that long.

3432243,2017-10-01,0,LvNQkpggm72kJUTzO0juWQ,"My husband wasn't feeling well the Saturday morning I visited this The Protein Source location. The last time my husband wasn't feeling well, we visited the Grand Canyon location where we ordered the banana nut bread and the Tropical Green juice. Since I live near the Durango location, my husband and I thought we would order from this location. We actually submitted our order through Yelp 24.

My husband LOVES peanut butter. If I wasn't paying attention to what he was ordering, he would have ordered everything with peanut butter. So my poor sick husband narrowed his order down to the Muscle Madness Protein Shake and cobb salad while I got the cobb salad wrap.

Why the heck are the shakes and the juices over $7!!!?? However, for my sick husband, I guess its better than having to take him to the doctors and paying the $30 copay. The shakes and juices have helped to make him feel better. 

My husband also enjoyed his cobb salad priced at $6.99 while my CA cobb wrap was $10.99?? Now that I've checked, the difference is that the CA cobb wrap has egg, chicken and tortilla wrap. I have to say, my CA cobb wrap didn't have that much taste. As for the egg, I didn't notice it until the last few bites when a chunk of it fell out.

So although the food is ok and the juice and shakes are great. It is expensive. But the trendy and young healthy life comes at a premium.

Two issues I encountered. 

1. Not an issue with The Protein Source, but more with Yelp 24. It took me about 10-minutes from placing my order online to getting to the restaurant and my order hadn't come through yet until a minute or two after I got there and I was on a mad dash to find my order online because I had already paid $28 for brunch.

2. This next issue actually supports a review done by another elite yelper. There appears to be an employee or two at this very location that lacks personality. I'm not a psychologist but there might be something else going on with this/these employees. During the few minutes I was at the register while the very helpful manager was scurrying around, the employee at the register had zero emotions, didn't acknowledge me other than to look at me, but there was nothing there. She didn't look annoyed nor was she pleasant. Not one peep. When the manager acknowledged that my order finally came in, it was the manager that said, ""we're working on your order now, thank you for your patience."" As I sat down, I purposely faced the kitchen to observe. As other patrons came in, it was one of the other workers in the kitchen that acknowledged all those that came in and not the girl working the register. To my surprise, it was this no-personality girl that dropped off my shake. No smile but sweetly said, here's your shake. So there is a pleasant personality somewhere in this lost sole. First impression is that this is poor customer service, which it is. But I mention this because it appears management is reading the reviews. Your employee needs help of some kind. I recommend to get her/them the help they need. 

Oh, there's a third issue. I noticed that there was a female employee with long hair that did not have her pinned back. Hopefully, none of her stands of hair fell into anyone's food...eew.

My reviews are never intended to be mean but hopefully helpful. There's much improvement needed at this location. Change is never easy. I do plan to revisit this location in a couple of months. I'm hoping to see a huge change so I can change my review to at least 3-stars.

So when I'm really starving, this is my go-to place. This might be one of the best places to try bison - it's certainly something you can't grab just anywhere, unless you happen to be Ted Turner and have over 50,000 of them. Why do I know that? Anyway, the bison wrap is really dang good with a touch of BBQ sauce and sweet potatoes that really hit the spot when you're hungry.

The only reason I have to take one star away is because it just seems a bit pricey - 13 or so dollars for super casual workout food in a wrap adds up fast.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,5,4,4,a2gPC0lAkglJKXW-wNO9qw

So apparently they refuse to use customer's container due to health violation code, so if they can use the same hand handling money, took the dirty cardboard box to the back of the kitchen, and use that same hand to serve food for customer, you tell me which one is more health code violated, what a joke, I will NOT GOING BACK!

Durango, this is great place to grab grub and hit the road. That's exactly what I did on my lunch visit. 

My Lunch: 

I ordered my juice and lettuce wrap at the counter. The staff who helped me on my visit were very friendly and prepared my lunch to go in a timely fashion. The place was spotless top to bottom with a modern look and feel. 

I ordered their Green Monster Juice that consists of juiced: Kale, Spinach, Apple, Cucumber and Lemon. I liked it and thought they had fair prices for their juice. 

I also ordered their California Cob Wrap (w/ cabbage wrap): Chopped Chicken Breast, Egg Whites or Whole Egg, Turkey Bacon, Cilantro Pesto, Cherry Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, Romaine Lettuce and Avocado Paired w/Dijon Balsamic. I personally didn't care for the wrap. I ate half and threw the other half away. It really didn't have much flavor and could've used more seasoning. It was really bland and I hate spending money one food that stinks. I took the wrap to go. Otherwise, I would've probably sent it back and asked for a replacement or more condiments/seasoning.

Overall, I was underwhelmed with my visit due to the wrap. The staff, however, was very friendly and prompt. I also like that they offer the option to order online.  will need to give it another try. I will aim to try some of their breakfast options or another wrap.

I don't mean to be bias, but the only thing I can really compare it to is Greens and Protiens, and I would choose Greens and Protiens over The Protein Source. Mainly because I feel G&P has a little bigger portions, sauces are more flavorful (esp. the cilantro pesto) and I like how G&P has a free green cucumber water drink. 

Back to The Protein Source the location is easy to get to, and parking is abundant. It was open till 10 PM today, which is the reason why I came. Design and space is clean, trendy and seats are comfortable. Customer service is great, Danny greeted me right away and asked if needed help with anything. He gave me suggestions and even let me try 3 other sauces when I didn't like the cilantro pesto. The cilantro pesto was very watery, and I like it roughly chopped when I can see the separate pieces in pesto. My favorite sauce was the light white balsamic vinaigrette. BBQ sauce was good, tangy and rich. Salsa has a good taste and filled with flavor also. 

I built my own meal with chicken, cauliflower mash and avocado. It was good, clean and what I'd expect from a healthy meal. Avocado looked only to be about an ounce and whole Danny said chicken. Was 6 ounces prior to cooking, afterwards it seemed more like 3.5-4 oz. I even ordered to go for lunch tomorrow- chicken, mixed veggies, steamed broccoli with teriyaki agave. The portion is good one one small meal. I do appreciate the calorie and macro count in the menu.

Came in around 9 or maybe a little before then on a Thursday night for a post-workout meal. There were 3 guys working. My past experiences here have been great with no complaints, but tonight is such a 180. 

I ordered a garden harvest turkey burger (light on the mustard) or something like that with fries. My bf ordered the egg-Sparagus with chicken. The guy taking my order was cool, joked around a bit. He asked, ""for here or to go."" As I was answering for here, he cut me off & said, ""ah, I got you."" Food came out maybe 10-15 mins later in a plastic bag... In my head, I'm like, ""okay, this is alright. We can just head home and watch Netflix."" I guess I made the mistake of not checking my order before I left and not asking for my receipt. 

Anyways, so we get home. I open my plastic container, lo & behold, there was my burger with sweet potato hash. Not the fries that I ordered. My bf opens his container and there's NO chicken. The burger I had was dry (im not sure if they usually put the sauce on the side like that) & salty. The hash did not taste good. At all. I'm shocked at this point cos I've always had good service and good food from this place. I don't like being the rude customer & I certainly don't want to be an annoying one either, but seriously...

My juice was also done really well - it had a good balance of fruits, so the Spanish and kale taste wasn't too bad.  

Overall - I love their food and will definitely be back!",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,1,0,5,PqsYva1tF1_SpB-VeuLFtQ

About 3 businesses down is this place called the protein source. I decided to check it out because of the convince, and because I am trying to eat healthier( who isn't lol). When I walk in there wasn't many people there so I was able to quickly scan the restaurant and order. I got some ground bison mix with avocado and barbecue sauce. It was about $12 and the portion, although seeming small, kept me full until it was around dinner time.

I came in ordered an açaí bowl and the cashier and the other employee in the back making the food we're laughing and talking to each other. After I ordered the cashier said that it will take 5 minutes. They didn't make the açaí bowl once, they made it twice. The first time a guy in the back was making it and he blended the ingredients too long so it made the açaí really soupy. The second time the cashier made it, but she also made it soupy and had to put in the freezer. When the order came it was in the glass bowl, but in the beginning when I ordered I said my order is for take out. It clearly says it on the receipt. I asked her if she can put it in the to-go bowl and she said yes. When she came back, the strawberries, bananas, and granola are all mixed together and it does not look like the photo on the menu. It did not look appetizing. I PAID $9.72 FOR THIS?!? She didn't apologize or anything and during the whole time the two people I mentioned were talking and laughing to each other most of the time. The order took 20 minutes not 5 you can see it on the photo. I don't think I want to come back here again.",xroEP5_x17k-eOfvvAjFAw,0,0,1,rPZwM5kvhSsJy_QbpgfSYA

Protein in all forms are available here:  breakfast, bowls, salads, chili, wraps, burgers, shakes, an acai bowl with protein, even the desserts have protein.  I've been to the first location a few times before so I know that this is the place to go when you are looking for healthy eats that taste good.  I'm a fan of the Steak Lovers Bowl with tenderloin steak, brown rice, avocado, veggies, feta cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette.  This bowl is a great mix of carbs and protein that doesn't make you feel guilty for eating it.  Every menu item has calorie content as well as protein gram count (if applicable), so this feature comes in handy if you're tracking your macros.  Even if you're not and you just want some healthy eats, give Protein Source a try because there should be something on their extensive menu that will appeal to you.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,8,7,4,3HIhIWjf7AjJ7AXFAuXyYw

The loco moco also was not worth the $13 price tag. For some reason, the egg on top was served scrambled. Bison meat tends to be dry and this patty was no exception. Jasmine rice was bland.

I had the Skinny Salmon Bowl and my dining partner had the brown rice and turkey bowl (the name slips my mind). Honestly, the Salmon Bowl was bomb.com! I've been craving it ever since I ate it. It was a cauliflower mash, with asparagus, cherry tomatoes and a Salmon filet with Balsamic reduction and cilantro pesto. Honestly, I didn't taste the cilantro pesto, but I didn't miss it. The bowl was so good!! Definitely recommend it. The turkey and brown rice bowl was pretty standard but at nearly $10, it wasn't worth it. I'm happy to pay more for more expensive protein. My bowl was $12, so I think the $2 difference is worth splurging and getting the Salmon. Dude, just go get a turkey taco at Del Taco for $1. Don't eat the tortilla- BAM! Clean meal. When you're here, get something you wouldn't normally cook at home. FWIW- we cook ground turkey at home maybe 3 or 4 times a week so it wasn't a special meal for us.
