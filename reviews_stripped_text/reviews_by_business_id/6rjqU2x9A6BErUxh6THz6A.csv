Sandwich is excellent. Best Italian sandwich I have ever had.",tvodz7G3q5LjbaRIUvnKvg,1,0,5,Db3UjAIGETXezd3SLlKSGA

The ""over sized"" sandwiches are anything but....and at about $8 a pop. Oh, and thanks for the cook who cleverly hiding the burned sides of both sandwiches on the bottom, you really tricked me on that one, why I didn't discover it until I got home. 

What I ended up getting for my $19 was 2 crappy sandwiches, no pickle or any sort of garnish, no sour kraut on the Ruben (which my not be considered Italian...but they ARE on the menu), and burned toast on one side. They proudly serve Boarshead meats here, which to me is serving marginal product. 

I made it obvious I was there for the first time, this apparently meant nothing to them. The odd thing was, no one else was even in the deli, they were not in the least busy. You'd think since they had all the time in the world to do a decent job, they would give some semblance of caring.",QMeT4kqAIvbKT7MxdyiD6A,0,0,1,bRGl-1nf-qXjii7fg59dJA

It comes with soft and fresh garlic bread. The pasta was ready within a couple minutes.  I'm Italian and I appreciate great pasta.  This pasta was just right and didn't have the texture of pasta that had been cooked a few hours before and reheated upon ordering, nor did it taste like it had been frozen.  Not quite sure how they are able to have the perfect texture so quickly.  The sauce is better than the sauce I make at home... impressive!  The owner came out and spoke with me during my visit... when you visit this deli they make you feel like family.",GeZ7JQpjZ5q0_EStk8WWjQ,1,0,5,I6rhdXfjTSV2tziwPjJxLw

Eh! I make a better sandwich at home. Plus, the bread was soggy from too much oil and vinegar. The eggplant was tough and the sauce was very acidic. Pretty disappointing. I'll stick with Siena Deli on West Sahara for my Italian deli fix.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,1,2,ZnBBKYfNsTTGT9XE-q2ATw

Beside the fact it was NOT very clean (check the bathroom), they simply offer a lousy product. On top of it, you might want to start by hiring at least ONE person who can communicate in ENGLISH (although Italian might be nice).
The next is hiring people who know the deli business. The onlyperson who spoke English had to explain to one of the workers how to put peppers and onions on a meatball grinder. (?) 

Avoid at all costs.",pcwaZG8Tp_tqybLKpHYGsw,5,1,1,TNNo6gugimGKzChcUkap7g

Good flavor, plenty of it, but nothing special.  If I was in the neighborhood, I'd go there again, but would not go out of my way to get there.",9ioj3UYw4NcJ4Cy8W6z7GA,1,0,3,IqyZ-UA2QsgjF72zAQCjKw

We bought an Italian sub and that was good.  It was big and worth the price.  However, we also bought half a canolli and the shell was too hard and the filling was runny, not as thick as it should have been.  My mom got a refund on it.  We did find  Stella Dora cookies there which we have not been able to find anywhere  else.    I heard that it was run by non-Italians which I thought was strange and they were there but I also saw a guy who I think was the owner and I think he looked Italian to me.  Overall though I think we will go back, especially since there is no other close Italian deli's in this area.",_ADw3-67xaZO6vaQeo8kfg,0,0,3,BR2UAtdOVSppk_hEDjB-og

Website claims to have a wide selection of meat, sausage, poultry, and seafood.  None here!

Italian pastries? NOPE! Fresh Bagels? NOPE!  All in a plastic bags from an offsite bakery!!!!

The italian family shown on the website?  No where to be seen!!!  A hispanic woman runs this place.  Friendly but not Italian.

We came looking for some fresh italian meats and cheeses.  They did have sausage which ended up getting.  Sausage was salty.

Stay Away!  Go to Siena Deli.",UuSZIfaIky9FPMuKKvVMqw,0,0,1,qLFgDU3xNv7yklDeYStkNA

You will not find good italian food here. STAY CLEAR of this place. The bathroom was so disgusting everything was so old and dirty. Everyone spoke SPANISH!
Where and how can they call this place an Italian Deli. I ordered a meatball grinder and the bread was so stale it fell apart. I couldn't even eat it. My husband said his wasn't that bad. I couldn't wait to get out of there. She showed me her pasta fagioli soup. It wasn't even in a tomato based broth!
This place was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!",5I8NAntem913UCiEliWS7g,1,1,1,88nYsl_qbDspeW_mFuhyug

What they do have is 3 small rows of Italian foods that may be hard to find at an American market. As far as deli they were pretty low on everything. It seemed empty almost like it was about to close. 2 sandwiches and 2 sparkling waters $18. A little steep! I really wanted Mortadella, a Italian staple and they were out. :(",cZ16H_Fc3s2-2AYrs-LEJg,2,0,2,uNS9WFeOy45VKFXIO0zxjQ
4222724,2010-04-20,0,6rjqU2x9A6BErUxh6THz6A,"We were ISO cold meat sandwiches and found Vinny-Boys via a Yelp search. 

My partner ended up with a hot dog, but I selected the Italian sub. Vinny's uses Boar's Head meats & cheeses ensuring consistent (if not always high) quality flavors. The small Italian-style sub roll was fresh, chewy, and not huge. The sandwich was high on vinegar flavors and low on oil. Otherwise the quantity of toppings was perfect. They are feeding average eaters here, not Olympic-style all-you-can eaters. I like that. 

The deli, which also sells beer, wine, Italian imported dry pastas, locally made frozen pastas, canned goods, oils, cookies, etc., has several tables for dining-in--giving the place a neighborhoody/familial feel. I liked that too.

As a matter of fact, we were greeted by a gentleman who I assume was the owner. He chatted us up a bit as we made our choices for lunch. This interaction was authentic and welcoming. I especially liked that.  

We left with full bellies and several pantry items including a little jar of fresh pears soaking in balsamic vinegar. 

Visit Vinny-Boy's and pick up a Tastykake...I totally forget to get one. I Did Not like that-doh!",PEpBk6UQ67T2Vlp7-za61A,4,0,4,NvtAxDR2c-gxRYZN8Z6JxA

The bread was so fresh, it was packed with meat and unbelievably I couldn't eat it all at once. The store had so much imported stuff from Italy (none of the writing on the packages was in English ha) including such exotics as black ink (from a squid) pasta. I highly recommend Vinny-Boy's for their awesome Italian sandwich, the owner was so nice and friendly (an Italian man...to the contrary of the two reviews by E.M. & Mary M) and also for their great selection of products from pastas, sauces, cheeses, peppers, etc.",XXpmgfhq42SpnlyhkizSHQ,4,1,5,MrCU_5cvtZR7cMruIKuCHQ

As we walked in the front door Vinny the owner was talking with some ""regulars"" it seemed. He was very friendly and showed us some of his specialty items he carried in his store. He was then called away when a delivery truck arrived.
My husband and I both decided on the Itialian beef sub. They were average in taste.  We had to ask the server (hispanic lady) for our soda's and we never did recieve our fries.
Over all it's a nice local place, but will only return if we get another coupon.",Qt0TI8JeD1AtR29hlRT5rQ,0,0,3,IvP-P9neh-5CB94p0Xt5xg
