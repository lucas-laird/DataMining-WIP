Also, this is the ONLY mcdonalds were they have closed 10 mins before they are supposed to. They stopped answering the drive thru, their window, and people were denied service. Where does this happen? I could have received my food if people had answered  and taken my order but instead we waited and so did another car until it really was too late. They avoid you so they can close up ten mins earlier.

We orbited the drive-thru (which is long) and noticed it was full of cars.  I was initially thankful we went indoors to make our orders.  It was only when we arrived back at the office did I notice that I was not F&*%ed at drive-thru but F%$#ed in the interior.  My order was wrong and.....I am ashamed to admit...I did not notice they did not give me my coffee (no exclamation mark needed).

Here's my 2 cents about this location. It's not in a good area of town, so there may be some transients hanging around. The drive thru moves at a snail's pace, even with only a few cars ahead of me. There have also been a few times where I've received old and soggy french fries or hash browns. 

Otherwise, everything else is fine. I haven't encountered any rude employees and the one time I've been inside, the restaurant was clean. I don't really order anything else off the menu except for my occasional chicken nugget Happy Meal or a sausage breakfast biscuit. Those have been up to par as well.

Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don't think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for ""McDonalds Pizza""

This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that's why I took the pic. It's like 10' x 6'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there too

I swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80's as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn't right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the ""Play Place"" was outdoors and even had a sing that said ""Please Do Not Feed The Birds"". Such a weird place. It's cool because it reminds of the way McDonald's was when I was a kid but it's scary because it's not intentionally retro, it just never changed...
