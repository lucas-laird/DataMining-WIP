10899,2009-12-04,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,I have been to Nove Italiano three times and each time has been a better experience than the last.  My most recent visit was a Sunday night and the restaurant was very quiet.  My husband and I arrived early (around 6pm) and we were the only ones in the whole place and we received top notch service.  We requested a window view and they seated us in the front room that faces the strip with cozy little fire-boxes in the windows.  The wait staff was super attentive and friendly and the food was awesome!  My husband and I were both craving pasta so I had the Pennette alla Vodka and my husband had the Sunday Gravy.  Both were excellent.  Nove Italiano was a great way to cap off another fantastic Vegas trip.,eCKw1eIZsx9nSr0fk23cVA,0,0,5,kDwR7WA63ZA2wHSxc7VGWQ

Our reservation was for 9:30 on a Friday night and the restaurant was pretty empty. It took a few minutes for our waiter to greet us. Once he made it to our table he was awesome. He clearly explained the menu and have a great personality. Wine took longer than expected to come to the table. The waiter did bring us a couple of glasses of champagne to help celebrate my birthday.

The appetizer Shrimp FrancaiseI is absolutely amazing. Four our main entrees I ordered the Rigatoni with chicken and my fianc√© ordered the Ravioli. She loved her plate, my plate was okay. My plate was okay not anything to brag about.

The place looks awesome and very nicely decorated. The views are amazing.

The house also gave me a free dessert on the house the bread pudding. This was absolutely amazing. 

Overall, I can say I left a fan and would probably go back primarily because our waiter was awesome and took great care of us.",kR0o4TX0XI3HjsEbERlrqA,2,0,4,03AIzIPIuA-TnujTvPFzeQ

127682,2011-03-08,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Ambiance: more of a party party group Italian place than a quiet romantic dinner for 2 or family outing type of place.  The back room has tall bushes carved into the silhouettes of busty ladies.  What do I say when little Johnny asks, ""Mommy, why are those trees shaped like girls with big boobs?""  

Food: portions are big (again, better for groups!)  The meatballs are half a pound each and the spaghetti dish could have fed a family of 4.  The food has good flavor though, especially the balsamic glaze on the filet mignon.  The house spaghetti with seafood is delicious, but beware that it is a bit spicy so if you have people who can't eat spicy at all, you might want to ask them to tone it down a bit.

Service: a little on the slow side, especially on busy nights.  We saw a waiter rushing to bring a table some shrimp scampi who was leaking buttery garlic sauce all over the floor and on the backs of a few couches near the bar.  Hope no one slipped on that.  Lastly, be prepared to wait after dinner to take the elevator back down if it's past 11pm as patrons are being shuttled up to the club.

Speaking of the menu, they printed one up for our party. It was a really classy touch that made the evening even more special.

The food and the view were amazing. The staff was extremely attentive and the experience was superb. The chef came out and talked to the birthday boy and made time to ask the vegans if everything was all right with the food. He even made us a special vegan dessert! 

Also, the drink I had at the bar before dinner (I think it was a strawberry Bellini) was divine.  Overall, everyone who came to the dinner was extremely impressed and pleased. I would definitely recommend Nove for large groups. A+++!",B6j6noz2qck0pdsVAYv1iQ,0,0,5,UXN_PxUYud39AsRzHCVBgw

The Halibut was good.  So tasty.  I didn't talk at all while I was eating.

The shrimp antipasta.  I forgot the name.  All I remember was the slogan, ""The best you ever had"".  This was the truth.  I never ate shrimp this delicious.

Service was good.  They even let me in with short pants and polo shirt.  Wow.  My excuse was that it was 100 degrees outside so I didn't dress up that morning.  They probably looked at me and told each other, dumb tourist.

Price is pretty reasonable for a fancy restaurant.  Our tab for 4 of us came to $200.

Incredible deference, respect and enhancement of seafood nuances were played out with the calamari, octopus, shrimp and grouper.  I particularly relished the Osso Bucco and the flourished ending with the Strawberry Carpaccio.

This MAY be a great place to eat with great food...but you DO NOT get any of that, AT ALL...if you are there using any type of discount whatsoever.

I came in on a $99 travelzoo deal.  What was supposed to be a $320 meal for two, was nothing more than a Fridays/Applebees happy hour special.  Two glasses of garbage champagne, followed by cold/cool Calamari and a side of 4 pieces of pepperoni and salami.  Then comes the Salmon (avg at best), and the Chicken parmesan (exactly equivilant to Burger Kings).  The chicken was a superthin piece of formerly frozen chicken.  tough, chewy, horrible...and not even hot.  HORRIBLE.  we didnt even eat the desert.

We had a bottle of Fiji, a domestic beer, and a $16 glass of wine.  Waiter returns with a $172 bill (after my travelzoo voucher).  not sure if he was trying to con us or not, as the bill showed a $2xx travelzoo discount on it.  He said ""oh, no no, thats fine, just deduct that $99 from the bill and thats what we charge, this is just how the receipt is done"".  Yea..whatever guy.  So, we were charged the tax on the full $320, and gratuity was also fully added on the $320 (even tho we saw our waiter twice), plus the $9 bottle of Fiji water.  

In the end, it cost me a total of $171 (voucher included), to eat what would have cost about $25 at a Fridays or Applebees happy hour.  And to be completely honest....it would have been better at either of those joints.  Absolutely unreal that they would do this, even as a revenue booster in a bad economy.  The food does not represent their establishment in the least (id really hope not!), and for someone who did well at the casino, I would have been interested in going back to have it again (if its all that people says its cracked up to be on the regular menu).  But we'll never know.  And have NO intention of ever finding out.

570938,2009-04-12,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"OK so I am a picky eater who tends to lean towards healthy and quality.  While in Vegas for the weekend, my BF and I decided to try Nove Italiano mainly bc we wanted a restaurant with a nice atmosphere and a nice view.
We figured, ""OK Italian, it will probably be pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary""
Were we wrong.
This food was unbelievable.

In the beginning they bring you an assortment of fresh breads and breadsticks with a little tray on the side with Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes and Parmesan Cheese for dipping. 
I dont usually partake in bread, but I did try a thin breadstick with the dippings and it was really good.

After reading about the Grilled Octopus App on yelp, I figured we had to try it.   Let me tell you, it was amazing.   Obviously not for everyone bc its octopus, but it was so tender and the flavor of the marinade was simple but very very fresh and a great flavor.  They were grilled so they were crispy.  Like nothing I have ever had before.
The marinade was not too heavy, more like a ton of fresh herbs.

I had the White Pizza with Clams.
Very simple but amazing.
Extremely thin crust so you can eat it and not feel full or guilty.  And big clams and plenty of them on top.

My BF got the Chicken Marsala.   It was on the bone which at first seemed weird, but he said he loved it bc it fell off the bone.
Huge gourmet mushrooms and plenty of them.
On the side he had penne pasta in Alfredo sauce which he loved. It looked like it was fresh-made sauce and a bit lighter then what you would expect alfredo to be.

We got a side of the Aparagus special dish, which was Grilled Asparagus with an egg and Ricotta cheese.
Sounds totally weird, I know, but so great!!

The place is also swanky and upscale but comfortable, the view is great.

Overall this place is a Must when in Vegas.
And the price ,we thought, was very fair.  We more than enough food, and 1 glass of wine and a Diet Coke and the bill was $125 with tip.     Not bad at all for a fine restaurant in Vegas.",IxAwaNR6sXC4yF3J92Og8w,0,0,5,nSSsLTlPXEVRBuvnPdcZrQ

Let me start with the service. The service in this restaurant is WOW""! IMPECCABLE!!! Our Server Ernesto made my wife's night special from the second we sat at our table, he honestly did an amazing job. Nobo the other person that helped us at our table also did an amazing job, he even took the time to showed us the whole view of the top of the restaurant and took a few pictures of us. At the end of our meal even the manager Rodrigo stopped by the table to make sure our experience was great and to say Happy Birthday to my wife ( which I thought it was a nice touch) Overall the service here is TOP NOTCH! 

Now the Food, the food here is Absolutely Delicious. Ernesto reccomended the grilled octopus as an apperizer, we were planning on ordering the calamari but instead we took his reccomendation and wow! It's really really good, typically octopus its a lil chewy but this one is so tender and flavorfull. As our main courses my wife ordered the surf & turf and I ordered the bone in Ribeye with a side of sparagus (with a fried egg on top, wich was actually really good) The were both perfectly cooked and full of flavor, mine even had some serrano peppers. As our Dessert we had the bread pudding which is so freaking good, it was nice when they brought the dessert with a candle and chocolate happy birthday writing and even nicer they gave us a glass of champagne to go with it.

Bottom line is that this restaurant is a MUST GO, the food is amazing, the view and the atmosphere is great, and of course the service is impeccable!",UUnzDD9ccx2YR0Fbe06XVQ,3,0,5,JdZz1mcPjlUgcFT_dY5xxw
759650,2008-01-03,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"My friends and I came here for our NYE dinner because I think it was the only place that would give us a reservation for 17 two days prior. They required a deposit on a credit card to hold the reservation. 

The decor is very Vegas. Walls were made from Crocodile printed leather. Everyone was like, ""it reminds me of Brett Michaels"". That's the kinda vibe we got but more polished.  On the plus side, the diners get a view of Vegas - reminiscent of Aqua in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, we had a large party & missed out on the view because we were seated in a private room that was basically a box with a door. Noise levels were high, and we didn't realize how loud it was out there until the doors were closed. It'd be really hard to converse if I weren't sitting right next to my friend. 

Our server was Joe, when he came in, the first thing he asked was to greet the person who made the reservation - also happened to be named Joe. Joe the server was a nice guy, but he was really slow. Granted we had a big party, we would probably see him every half hour or so. The other two servers were good with water refilling, but not so great at remembering the additional tidbits.

During our extremely long wait, I went to use the restroom, and as I walked in I noticed the honeycombed walls made from bronze and stainless steel. I felt like I was trapped in a beehive. The layout of the restroom was really odd. They had two stalls to the left, the sink in the center, and one right next to the sink. Just my luck, I got the one next to the sink. I didn't think much of it until I went in. Not only am I only a foot away from someone washing their hands, there was also a 2 inch gap in stall door. I know it's the Palms and everything there revolves around sex, but please, I have no interest in anyone seeing my cooch. I'm at Nove not the Playboy Club. 

Here's what I had for dinnner:

Crispy Canoli: $16 (comp. of the chef)
I only tried the king crab one and thought it was gross. The pastry part was fine, just the filling was not to my liking. 

Eggplant: $12 (cotf)
Not bad but not memorable either. 

Sicilian Crab Cakes: $18
This wasn't a cop out of a crab cake. You can taste the crab, and it was topped with something sweet that really made it stand out. I believe it was tomato and baccala. 

Ceasar Salad: $12 
Loved it! The salad was topped with anchovies. Fresh and delish!

Lobster Minestone: $14
Luke Warm. Not exciting and the beans could've been cooked longer. 

Nove Spagehtti: $43 - One of the signature dishes
This dish had a lot of flavor, but it would be something you'd tire of after about 1/3 of it. I liked the pasta though. It was a mix of their own reg pasta and a green version, I'm assuming was made from spinach. 

24 oz. Bone in Rib Eye: $52 
+  8 year aged Balsamico: $10
The Rib eye was really big & tasted okay (by far, better than Boa)..  but for 62, I expected more.  But I did like how they give you options of different glazes or sauces. 

Nove Gnocchi: $12
Very heavy and packed with flavor. It's great to try a bite or two, but you can't stomach the entire thing. My friend who's Italian said the gnocchi was decent, but of course he's had much, much better. I myself have never stumbled upon really good, authentic gnocchi. 

All in all, the dinner was fine, but I wouldn't go back for a full meal. I'd just want the ceasar salad and maybe some crab cakes.  

The entree portions are fairly large and flavorful. I recommend sharing so you're not stuck with one dish that you'll get sick of. Even though I split 2 entrees, I still didn't finish everything. Our server also advised us that the main 4 antipastas and contornis were meant to be shared family style.",GnCf5sIcxcwq2f3Ys6j52A,3,1,3,QG-K6MX2202y74gy0xdk9Q

It's located at the 52 floor, with a fantastic view. You have to check in at the ground floor and take the elevator up.

After a few minutes we were seated and introduced to our waiters. 

We ordered the salumi plate as a starter and shared it. It was great for sharing and the red pizza was the bomb! Yumm so good!
For the main course we had the filet mignon and the penne bolognese. The filet was great and they have this phenomenal mashed potatoes with pancetta, scallions and sour cream! I still dream about that.
The bolognese on the other hand was not good at all. It should have been beef, but it tasted like lamb, so we asked the waiter and he was not sure what meat it was made of. He did not care to ask in the kitchen. Since this flavour was so overpowering, I could not eat it and left it almost untouched. When they cleared the table they did not even asked if something was wrong. So it seems they are not too intrested in their guest's opinion or wellbeing.

The busboys were dressed up too, in top hats and short pants with long, argyle socks. It was a little Alice in Wonderland, a little Clockwork orange, a little over the top - I loved it.

There's a DJ playing music so that you can keep your groove goin' from the night before, and dancers in skimpy outfits to help the ambiance. 

The cocktails are all extremely well crafted, creative twists on classics (i.e. my Bloody Harry had bacon and beef jerky in lieu of celery, and a bacon salt rim., the sangria was strawberry guava).

The buffet is bountiful: there are several salads, pasta, panini, pizza, cheese and cured meats, french toast, fruit, crudite, roasted veggies, shrimp with a very tasty cocktail sauce, and even a made to order frittata station. There is a make your own coffee bar and then there are miniature desserts galore. 

All of the food was very, very good and very, very fresh. So fresh that several times during the meal we watched them refresh the food even though it had barely been touched, and they didnt put the old food on the new platters either. The pasta was still al dente, which was a great surprise - I think they are the only buffet that I have seen that managed to accomplish al dente buffet pasta. The fruit was ripe and there was a huge variety, including long stemmed strawberries and whole plums and peaches. 

The service was spectacular - Marie was extremely sweet and attentive without being overbearing. She had excellent suggestions, and when she took our picture she even suggested an alternate spot with better light. She also brought out frittatas over from the frittata stations so that we didn't need to hang around waiting for it. Our water were always replenished and she always made sure we were good on alcohol. The busboys always cleared my plates and glasses very promptly.

The restaurant is near the top of the Palms, so the view is really nice.  Although there were tables next to the windows, they seated us in the interior of the restaurant.  There were a couple of window side seats, but they weren't clean, so I guess they didn't want to take the 30 seconds to clean the table?  I think that was a misstep - there were only two other sets of guests!

Like I said the place is large and decorated nicely, but it probably needs an updating. They have a long bar that actually looks cool, but of course no one there.

We ordered the octopus and beet carpaccio salad.  The octopus was ok, but the beet carpaccio needed something to spruce it up, because is was bland.

I had the ravioli for an entree, which had ricotta cheese, pancetta, other odds and ends in a lemon butter sauce.  It was delicious.  Very good.  It was actually surprising how good it was.

This place has potential, but there really isn't anything that sticks out about it, other than the view.

The problem: the waiter who clearly found no interest in interacting with us after tossing us our pre-planned menus groupon had chosen, seemed to purposefully set us up. My boyfriend asked our waiter which wine came with the dinner and he opened up the wine list and pointed to one page. Now the prices varied up to $100+, so my bf asked several times, "" so any of these wines come with the deal."". The waiter hastily stated yes, yes, yes. So we chose a $94 Cabernet with our meal. We had a lovely evening together until the bill came. Now don't get me wrong, we came to Las Vegas to spend money but voluntarily. Not only did the bill include a  $55 dollar gratuity but also the price of the wine plus tax. WHOA! We signaled for our waiter and informed him of his apparent mistake, but he seemed to no longer speak proper English. So the manager was summoned and we let him hear our grievance quietly as to not disturb the other guest, He stated, ""Why would you believe that a $94 bottle of wine would be included in the meal?"" We explained the exchange with the waiter (seriously my BF asked at least 5 times) and the groupon deal. At this point I'm starting to get ticked off because the manager was just being condescending and dismissive. After 6 minutes of an all out discussion, I said, "" Just pay the bill so I can write a review."" Then the manager seemed to change his tune. All in all, we walked away paying $22 for the gratuity but it ruined my whole surprise Las Vegas vacation. I will never return to the Palms nor the Nove  EVER AGAIN!",U73dk_9_yjhnG_VmOmn6XA,1,0,2,ayTVtYbgN6JEwEggox6F-A

They offer a slight variation on it each night but it always features fresh sashimi assortment with olive oil, sea salt, and some kind of fruit. We then move to the caprese salad and substitute burrata for the buffalo mozzarella...a delicious decision! Each evening, they have brought out at least one appetizer or feature compliments of the house and they are incredibly accommodating to repeat customers. For our entree, we split a butterflied 8oz filet mignon prepared medium well (they slightly undertook so this leaves the center with just a touch of pink) We tried the Parmesan preparation but prefer the untouched version...we still have to try the much raved about house balsamic. We order the death by potatoes sans meat and either brocolini or spinach, both delicious. In addition to the delicious food, we order the passionfruit mojito...yum!

981258,2010-05-06,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Good, but weird.

Yes, it's extremely expensive but if you come here with a large group and share/graze, you can eat very well and not spend a fortune.

A starter of house-made salumi was fine but unremarkable.  Steaks and chops were good and perfectly cooked.  The best thing by far however, was a generously-sized $10 side of gnocchi laden with all kinds of baby vegetables: squash, artichokes, etc.  That was by far the highlight of the meal and would've been all I needed!  So look for these hidden gems and you'll do well here. 

Some good wine choices by the glass.

For some reason the restaurants at The Palms have chronic problems with service.  It's not that it's bad...it's just so uneven and the very basic, Restaurant 101 stuff is lacking.  So while my server was certainly friendly and had good suggestions, water glasses were not refilled, or water was spilled on the table and never cleaned up, or empty plates stayed on the table forever without being bussed, a mess of (very mediocre) bread and bread sticks were plopped down on the table looking like they could've been the previous diners' leftovers.

Also, since it shares and elevator with the Playboy Club and Moon nightclub, be prepared for militaristic treatment: seriously, we were literally marched to the elevator...and velvet-rope fighting just to get to the hostess.  This part of the process while acceptable for a club is really an unacceptable start if you're trying for a relaxing dining experience.",F_N4NyoMJWzBYFspeYfH3A,1,0,4,-QNiv3DEjlBMieGZKTiMVw

A group of us were staying at the Palms and were starving, so we made a reservation an hour before the restaurant's opening time at 6 PM. Even though we were a large party (13 people), they accommodated us quickly. 

The Food:
*I had the tortellini - very good, though a little salty, and a fairly small portion for over $20 (I believe it was priced around $22)
* My husband had ""my grandmother's ravioli"" - delicious, even better than the tortellini, though of course the same small portion
*The consensus around the table was that while the food was awesome, people were a little disappointed by the small serving sizes. My girlfriend remarked that she would need to go to McDonald's afterwards for a cheeseburger to fill her up. Oh well, I guess that's what you get at a nice restaurant in Vegas. 

The service:
*Excellent! Our waiter (I believe his name was Colin) was really great and provided excellent service. Very friendly and attentive without being over the top.
*They were really patient when we needed to split our bill at least 8 ways
*The restaurant sent out a couple plates of free appetizers (our end of the table got yummy pear & gorgonzola-topped crackers) which really impressed me. Thanks guys!

992666,2012-08-28,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"We kicked off fall Restaurant Week 2012 at Nove inside the Palms. Our foursome was seated at 7:15. The restaurant remained pretty quiet until late into our meal. 

We started with an amuse bouche of bruschetta and caponata. Plus a bread basket with sesame bread, twists and focaccia. We opted for the $20 wine pairing: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot and I missed the dessert wine. Not a moscato, I'm sure of that, but still very sweet. Too sweet for my liking. 

Butternut Squash Ravioli; Brown Butter, Sage whet our appetite. The pasta was tender, and a bit rustic. The filling was sweet. I prefer a more savory squash, but it was very good.

Next, we had Baby Fennel and Apple Salad; Endive, Toasted Hazelnuts, Gorgonzola Cheese and Petite Farmers Market Greens; Roasted Heirloom Beets, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Candy Walnuts. Both salads were nicely dressed, crisp and loaded with tasty bits. 

Before the third course, we had a second amuse bouche of salumis. The venison was one of the better varieties.  Entrees were Salmon; Cauliflower Puree, Truffle Pan Sauce, Arugula and Almond Salad and Veal Scaloppini; Broccoli Rabe, Roasted Garlic, Scampi Sauce. I couldn't find fault in either dish, but I think the veal was a bit better than the salmon. It had bolder flavor and it was so tender, it seemed to melt like butter.

Dessert was odd. The menu read Chocolate Ganache; EVOO, Sea-Salt, Toasted Walnut and White Chocolate Bread, and I interpreted it as individual desserts with ganache over sweet toast. Instead, a single large scoop of ganache was served with a half dozen pieces of toast and two knives were provided. We spread the ganache across the toast, and dug in. It was like a saltier, and a more decadent version of nutella and toast. It was very rich so a little went a long way. 

Service was attentive throughout. Nove is perched on the 51st floor of the Palms' Fantasy tower. The views are stellar. We watched the skies fade from day to night. It is always a joy to see the glimmer of lights across the desert. Eats tend to suffer when you get views like these, but Nove seems to get it right.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,1,4,4,u30hj1w_V4mJ8_i2zoz0Ig

Except, because the place was pretty empty we thought we'd get a good table with a view.  Not so much.  We got a booth facing the middle of the place.  whatever, no problem,  the view wasn't that important to us.  

I forget our waiter's name but he was really helpful and a funny dude.  He helped us pick a bottle of wine ( I don't remember what it was, but it was pretty cheap and really good).  For aps, we ordered Crudo (kinda like a sashimi dish) , Arancino (rissotto ball),  crab cakes.  We had one more, but I forget what it was, prob a seafood dish.  Everbody really liked their aps, and my Arancino was fantastic.  We also ordered a bowl of Sunday Gravy (pasta, meatballs) for everyone to split.  The waiter was really cool and told us we only need half of it, and gave us a half portion, and everyone loved the Sunday Gravy.  Even the half portion was huge.  Oh, I forgot, the breads they served us before the aps were really good too.   

On to the dinners, I was kind of boring and got the chicken parm.  It was the best chicken parm Ive ever had in my life, hands down.  The portion was also HUGE!.  I also had the garlic mashed potatoes which were good, a lil on the strong side. I felt horrible throwing it out, because it was just that good.  My friend ordered their specialty, the osso bucco, which was perfect.

We def ordered way too much food, and realized we could have probably eaten here for very cheap.

Overall, this place compares to the top italian rest in NYC, and I think came out to about $90/person with wine and probably about twice as much food as we actually needed.  I recommend Nove to anyone I know that is going to Vegas.  Great for couples or groups of friends, probably not children.  

Nove was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the whole situation at the beginning.",EeI4yjrvQi_H_q-5CXjUfg,2,1,4,mvsB1BEsIq-iksOvzkr1Rw

The problem is just getting there.  It almost feels like an airport experience where you have to check in at front, walk through roped off lines, take an elevator to the top of the restaurant, and check in again.  I'm not sure if this process if for security or whatever... but it really needs to be streamlined.  

Once inside, there are nice views and beautiful trendy decor.  The views don't quite compare to Aliz√© as you are facing West towards the mountains and not the strip.  Part of the views are also blocked by the Palms Casino tour which takes away from the experience.

We came as a group of four and decided to order our entrees individually but shared everything as a table.  They started us off with bread and an amuse bouch√© which was nice.  I can't recall what it was but it certainly wasn't one of my favorites.  Our appetizer was the calamari which were lauded as the best ever by the waiter.  He was pretty close.  These were pretty damn good.  We then ordered a side of ""Death by Potatoes"", a side of meatballs, bolognese, scallop risotto, seafood spaghetti, and ravioli.  Everything was absolutely delicious except for the ""Death by Potatoes"".  This side is overhyped in my opinion as they just tasted like another batch of mashed potatoes.  The dish that everyone enjoyed most was the risotto and scallops.  Highly recommended!

Our service was really good throughout the entire night from start to finish.  We ended up staying later than close and were never pressured to leave as well.  Overall, it's a great dining experience if you love Italian food and are looking for a sexy atmosphere and great service.",qrOXWSK-bpf24dLWnTx29Q,2,0,5,SRhrjvvVe3xh2CXMBhOj4w

We made a reservation for 7:15pm, showed up, and were immediately seated. At this time, the restaurant was semi-busy but it got to be quite loud and packed around 8:30-9. Avoid going at these times if you would like to hear anyone speak at your table.

We were brought a menu with the dishes we would be served that evening, and were poured our complimentary champagne. A plate of margarita pizza was the first to arrive was fairly tasty. Cracker-thin crust and a very light spread of tomato sauce and cheese. Following it was a meat and cheese plate, calamari, and gnocchi with a meat ragu. I don't eat pork and don't prefer calamari and so I avoided those, but the gnocchi were very light and delicious. 

For mains, we had salmon with spinach, and chicken parmigiana.  The salmon was very delicious and I really enjoyed having spinach as a side as there weren't any other vegetables throughout the meal. The chicken was blah. Very saucy. Tough meat. Blah. While portions looked to be on the small side for 2 people, there was no way we could get through all of this. 

Service was amazing throughout our meal. Our water glasses were never less than 1/2 full and plates were quickly bused off our table as soon as we put our forks down. My sister joined us at the restaurant and ordered separately and was very delighted with her meal.

It's true that they minus what the original cost of what the meal would have been, from your bill. So you get a bill that is $320 and then they credit your voucher and you pay tax and tip on top. Not the best procedure as my heart certainly flipped when I saw $320 on there, but they take care of you and it's a lovely meal.

A word of caution not to use this deal on a Sunday evening. We did and figured we would just go to Ghostbar to check out the view. Low and behold, it was closed for a private event and so we lost out on that portion of the deal. Try a Friday or Saturday instead to get your full money's worth. Also check a directory when you get to the hotel as the Nove elevators are at the opposite side to the doors.",B393RKS1yuQdkiynXKa1iQ,1,0,3,5lDBwRgB0VjFHTRv3-z0Gg

We ordered two side dishes as appetizers--Nana's meatballs and Death by Potatoes.  The meatballs were oh so delicious, but I wasn't impressed by the potatoes.  It was basically whipped potatoes with about a stick of butter on them, with a couple of garnishes of chives and bacon.  Not bad, but not worth $11, in my opinion.  My husband has a different opinion, though :).  He loved them!  
For our entrees, we ordered their signature dish, Nove Spaghetti and the baked penne.  My husband was in heaven with the spaghetti, which is a seafood dish.  If you love seafood, he highly recommends it.  The penne was a generous portion.  After eating bread and the appetizers, I only finished about a third of my pasta.  
We shared a cannoli plate for dessert.  It was fun to make your own, but the filling wasn't great.  
Overall, a very pleasant and tasty meal.  My only complaint is that it was really loud in there.  I don't know if it was just from the bar, or if they had a private party in the back, or what.  Sometimes we couldn't hear each other talk, and we were sitting right next to each other.

Nove is an interesting space with some really great views, but the food I had was only okay.  Cheese pizza app was mediocre, my salmon was okay, and, just judging by how much pink meat was left on a couple of my colleague's plates, either their dishes weren't that good or the kitchen rushed too much trying to make up for some lost time, giving some folks rarer steaks than they would have liked.

We decided to check out Nove Italiano after a recommendation from the other foodie in our group. We grabbed a cab and headed on over. (Got an interesting side story at the end when we enter the Palms.)

We took the elevator up to Nove and found that the place was dead. Usually this calls for some concern but then again we are off strip and it was a Monday night. The inside of Nove is quite large and could easily accommodate a group of just about any size. The decor on the inside is quite nice, elegant, but not over the top.

We sat down and ordered this appetizer that contained various cuts of meat like salami and etc, cheeses and bread. It was quite good. For our main course, most of us had ordered the Nove Spaghetti/Seafood Pasta which was basically pasta that came with Lobster, Shrimp, Crab, Scallop, and Calamari in a standard but very good tasting tomato based sauce. The seafood in this dish was to die for! Next time I am in town, I will definitely be coming back to this place. This was definitely the best meal during my stay here.

Overall, I don't have anything bad to say about the place other than the fact that I was quite shocked that this place wasn't packed because the food is outstanding here. Usually when I come to Vegas I am always saying ""Yea that was good but I could probably get it cheaper back home"", but I think might be the case of ""That was well worth the money and I will be coming back!""

Interesting Side Story: As we arrived at the Palms, we get to the entrance to the Palms. We see the door open on the far door open on the set of double doors and someone stand there to hold . At the same time, I grabbed the door closest to me and hold it open so that my coworker could enter. At that moment with both doors open, Mike Tyson comes walking right out to exit the hotel.

We started with wine.. I had some questions about 2 wines on the wine list and she was clueless. She said she would find out. Comes back and tells me both are ""dry wines"" I asked what grape.. she had no idea. So we ended up ordering a bottle of prosecco. She brings a different bottle than what we ordered. I sent back, she finally got the bottle we wanted. She poured our first glass and never came back to refill, not that they were busy.. restaurant was barely 30% occupied. (Speaks a lot about being that busy on a Saturday evening) The first round of bread is complimentary but second round is a charge. We ordered one more  and she charged us for 2. We ordered short ribs from their seasonal menu, filet mignon and ceasar salad which was just OK. I had the walnut tomato pesto ravioli, fancy description but all it had was cheese ravioli with very average marinara sauce and basil leaves.. no sign of walnuts.  We didn't order dessert.  
After we paid our bill, the manager came to ask about our experience. I gave him my honest feedback. He was very apologetic. I asked if the restaurant had a sommelier, he said that the somm was going back and forth to other restaurants coz of staffing issues. Manager seemed nice and told us to come back, however I don't think we will return.

Nove is an elegant, yet contemporary/casual gem of an Italian Restaurant located on the 51st floor of the Palms hotel, in Vegas.  You are greeted on the main floor, outside the elevator, by a lovely and pleasant hostess who confirms your reservation (assuming you are wise enough to book one, and I highly recommend you do) and directs you to the somewhat hidden elevator behind you.

Upon arriving in the restaurant proper, a lovely trio of equally pleasant young ladies, dressed classily in black dresses, not too short, but short enough, with genuine and warm smiles escort you to your table.  Even the wives thought it was a nice touch.

At the table, our waiter was courteous, respectful, informative and prompt.  He also made a point of not constantly overwhelming us with incessantly asking if everything was ok.  He was good enough to let us enjoy our meal and conversation, without being obtrusive. (If you are reading this Tony, thanks again for an excellent evening).  The sommelier was a pleasant young lady who clearly knew her wine.  My comrade is a bit of a connosieur and they conversed knowledgeably about our choice for the evening, a fruity and potent Amarone, which, as it turns out, was a marvellous compliment to the meal, despite the prevalence of seafood

Finally, the food.  Yes, some (and I repeat...SOME) of the choices were expensive, but not all.  Clearly, one will always pay a bit of a premium for seafood, as well as the location of the restaurant.  Well seafood was abundant on the menu, and it was fresh and succulent.  The appetizer Shrimp Francaise literally melted on your tongue with a delicious, buttery sweetness.  The flat bread with littleneck clams was crisp, light, tender, and thoroughly enjoyable.  The peak of the evening was the Pasta Nove.  Black and white, homemade spaghetti with clams, shrimp, crab, lobster and scallop.  It was one of the finest seafood pastas I ever had.  And I am Italian!  Yes it was expensive (over 40 dollars), but that dish would cost over 30 dollars anywhere.  For the view and the quality, it was worth every penny.

I have been to Nove Italiano on 2 separate occasions.  One was on New Years Day/Mom's birthday and second with a couple of friends last year.  On both events, we were treated with such VIP treatment and was seated at the special part of the restaurant with the fireplace and overlooking view of Las Vegas.  The staff were very polite and professional and the view was breathtaking.

As my first time there was for my Mom's birthday, the Chef, Marlon Simbulan came out to greet my Mom a happy birthday and served Chef's choice menu for her special day.  Drinks and arrays of food were served with over a span of two hours.  From a multitude of appetizers, scrumptious entrees (yes plural) and decadent desserts, we were in awe and impressed with the Chef and the staff. Everything was delicious and you can very much tell that every ingredient and every recipe was well thought of and as corny as it may sound, made with love.  Needless to say, Mom's birthday was a success and memorable one.

As if the first time wasn't the best yet, the second visit proved that perfection was achievable.  This time, it was with a couple of my friends and it was their first time in Vegas.  So where do I bring them? To the bestest place ever ;p As if I was a regular, the staff treated me and my friends like royalty.  Same VIP area and guess what, same amazing Chef that came out to welcome me and my girls.  We were served with my friend could only describe as the best 'tomato' she's ever had (on a Caprese salad) and succulent dishes that she described to be 'orgasmic.'  Doesn't get better than that eh?  To top it off, Chef made us his special mango shot.  Yum-mey!

Overlooking the Las Vegas skyline, this is a place to impress your date or celebrate that special occasion.  The lighting scheme is well placed to bring a exciting, lively ambiance.  Not overly dark and romantic at all.  This is the place where the mood of the restaurant feels like its ready to party.

   First, the chef sent out complementary appetizers. To the chef, I thank you! Lobster cakes were buttery, crunchy, and very good. The duck pate was supposedly great according to my friends.  I, on the other hand, never acquired the taste, so I cannot accurately judge them.  Their calamari appetizer was more spicy than what I prefer.  

  Their yellow fin tuna is delicious. Properly seared on the outside, raw inside and fresh on the inside.  With a touch of orange slices and asparagus is complement to the fish.  the side dish of mushrooms were more saltier than I would prefer. It had generous seasoning of everything; ground peppers, mushroom flavors, and excessive salt.   One more thing, the filet mignon is superb.  Its supposedly even better with the balsamic sauce.   Perfectly cooked, tender and flavourful,  I say if the Filet Mignon melts in your mouth without it, then I will welcome the sauce next time I'm here. 

  The gin martini was good, but still not perfect.  There's always a fine balance of gin and olive juice, and many bartenders does not hit the right combo.   This guy was close.
 
  One more thing, you get access to the Palm's Playboy Club for dining here. Very nice!",rwkJWBbgpl3ZdivUfuupbg,0,0,4,CMedccDrwY_SSmAv5EXsmg

Please disregard some of the negative reviews of the Travelzoo deal as the voucher clearly stated that tax and gratuity were not included and it would be charged at the restaurant based on the full value of your meal as is the norm with all of the travelzoo vouchers and restaurant coupons from other sites.

The restaurant is on a high floor of the Palms with a spectacular view and the staff was very friendly.

As most of the other reviews stated, the first course included calamari, Caesar salad, a thin crust pizza, salumi and cheese, and what I think they called salmon tartar (correct me if I'm wrong). Then came the risotto followed by superbly seasoned salmon with spinach, chicken parmesan and gnocchi (salmon was my favorite). The final course was dessert: a chocolate gnash.

 It came with 2 small glasses of champage but we ordered the passion fruit mojito from the drink menu (paid extra) which was awesome! It is a good size and not watered down at all. We went back there before the club just for the mojito.",ndqx9xd3oDz-_MJ4PvpEqQ,0,0,5,-SDVgoJf3QkCIzjk4dt4ag

1704654,2016-11-03,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"I'm sad to give this place 3 stars but I think 3 stars might be a bit generous. After searching Yelp extensively for a 'hidden gem' Vegas restaurant I thought NOVE was the perfect one. I made a reservation weeks in advance and when we arrived we were seated immediately. We had a 630 reservation and we were one of only 3 tables, that I saw, in this huge restaurant. The restaurant itself is very pretty and tastefully decorated. We were seated at the window with a direct view of the Palms sign and the far end of the Vegas strip. These were the positives about the restaurant. 

As far as service, our server was plenty friendly but the service was pretty slow which was disappointing considering there were only 3 tables. My fianc√© accidentally knocked his water glass over and a different server noticed after a few minutes and partially wiped the table but never came back. We were left sitting with no napkins (as we had used ours to wipe it up) and a soggy table still for quite some time. We ended up taking the napkins off of an empty table next to us to wipe up the rest of the water, then eventually were able to ask the server for replacement napkins. There was also a serious lull between ordering the appetizer and main which added to the length of the meal. 

Now to the food. We ordered the shrimp appetizer which was ok but a little chewy and very lemony. We split the minestrone soup which was flavored very nicely. For the mains we had the manicotti and baked penne. The baked penne was good but no better than your neighborhood Oliver Garden. The manicotti was kind of disappointing. It was runny and overpowered with eggplant. We were given a complimentary tiramisu for dessert and this was easily the best part of the meal. 

Overall, I would not recommend NOVE and would not return. The partial strip ""view"" is not worth the average service and very very average food.",plKUdOlfGeL6sw2qyTh42w,1,0,3,6vIvcYdtirv2Vl1mQOCoSw

Since we were staying at Palms Place we thought we'd try NOVE. OMG...who designed that place?! Being an opera singer I would love to sing in that place when it's empty but as a customer it was awful being able to hear EVERYONE! I have never in my life been in such a loud restaurant. We thought it was because of a large party in the main room but even when we moved and the people left I could hear everyone like they were sitting right next to me. I had a huge headache the whole time. On top of that our waiter was kinda a douche and didn't even really pay attention to us. I asked for a TASTE of the Pinot noir to see if I liked it and he just brought me a whole glass like it was what I ordered. He really didn't seem to give a crap.

As far as the food was concerned the beef tartar was fantastic! The amuse Bouche that came out before was really boring and sort of flavorless (some sort of bruschetta). I ordered the side dish of gnocchi as my entree...it was bigger than my bfs entree! It was also really good the next evening. However, aside from the beef tartar none of the food was very memorable. My boyfriend said the pizza was really good but being sorta a pizza snob I just thought it was decent but nothing fantastic.

Food-3 stars
Service-0.5

I wouldn't waste my money on NOVE again when there are so many good restaurants in Vegas with servers who actually give a crap and food that will really blow my mind. My advice...head to Scarpetta at the Cosmopolitan.",QYuHQuKZFk7uC4UcdR-Y9Q,1,0,2,chqM7qFO8IeNHj9ZpBGu8Q

I think for the price you really get your money's worth. It is a special occasion kind of place. I've been there on my birthday and recently for a friend's birthday. I love the view from the top and if you get to sit on the second floor, the view is way better than sitting on the bottom floor with the curtains covering the view! I love the colors and decorations in the restaurant, beautiful! It's classy, romantic, kinda place you want to take pictures. It is more of a dress up in your hoochiest clothes you can find kinda place with all the girls ready to go to the clubs at the Palms,  but I don't let that bother me. 

My first time there the chef supposedly sent us samples of his new salads. He gave us 2 different kinds of salads to each person at our table-for free. That was cool. Both time I ordered the Nove Spaghetti. The first time I ordered a full order and the 2nd time going there I ordered the 1/2 order. You barely get anything in the 1/2 order, but all my friends who ordered 1/2 orders of their pastas got decent size portions. I would order a half order of something else besides the signature pasta. I am happy with that pasta, but I have also tried my friends pennette alla vodka with gulf shrimp and that was very good. 

The desserts here are excellent. I think people who spend alot of money at this restaurant, they drink. Since I don't drink, I think the prices are decent for what you get. 

The last time we went we were walked into Playboy/Moon which was very convenient and saved us time and possibly money of waiting in line with several guys in our party. 

I will go here anytime! If you can get a table near the fireplace by the window, you must be VIP, I can't seem to find out how people get those tables which are the most private and the best.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,1,4,RtR0Wm_zpaz1_jjXMqhwhw

As a treat to ourselves, my friend and I decided to do the Chef's tasting menu which consisted of five courses plus bread. We thought as a tasting menu the portions would be on the small side. Unbeknownst to us, everything was medium sized and it ended up being a lot of food. A lot of delicious food. 

First we started off with bread then the appetizer which was very good. Then the second course, tiger prawns perfectly cooked in some good sauce accompanied with a caprese salad. The paring went well together. 
Third course was chicken parmigiana and ravioli. This is possibly the best chicken parmigiana I have ever had. In an attempt to pace myself, I tried not to eat everything but I could not help myself. 
Fourth course, at this point I am getting full. The salmon and steak are cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. I was only able to eat part of it. 
The final course, desert which was ice cream with a coffee concoction poured over it and a mini cheesecake by its side. The ice cream was enjoyable but the passion cheesecake was amazing. 
Also, the staff was great. 

This is the perfect place for date night, girl's night out or proposal with the stunning view and romantic decor. I highly recommend this place, particularly the tasting menu.",5eIaMYhMP5APRnYKTafmsw,5,3,5,Ejg1-8pBUG3fSr3BohKAUg

There are some comments here about the young ladies in corsets that escort you to the elevator and the hostesses at the restaurant.  I mean come on, what do you expect at a casino that has the Playboy Club and tries to appeal to the MTV/co-ed crowd.  The girls were nice and very polite. 

Once you arrive at the restaurant you'll immediately notice the great ambiance up there.   The decor is pretty modern trendy which works well for the restaurant.  The views are amazing given that the restaurant is surrounded by huge glass windows and Nove's location on the 51st floor just below Moon and the Playboy Club.

The food is good, but after being spoiled with the best Italian food at Parma, my standards are set bit high for every Italian restaurant in Vegas. 

My favorite Italian meal is not pasta, but risotto. The best risotto I've had was in a small hole in the wall joint in NJ. The creaminess of the risotto from the quality of the rice used is the key thing in a risotto. The risotto at Nove was creamy but the quality of the rice was questionable. It was chewy and some of the rice seemed bit under cooked. I would recommend Parma over Nove purely based on the quality of food and service.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,3,0,3,q9zkId7HyRiXedVTc9i3Lg

It's taken me a while to write a review, only because I'm not one who's big on reviewing restaurants but since I'm making my way out to Vegas again in one week, I'm reflecting on my past trips. First off, this place, is hands down, gorgeous. I had made reservations prior to sit next to the window with a view of the strip. While I was hoping for an upstairs table, we were seated not far from the hostess station, but still next to a window with a beautiful view of some of the Vegas strip. We were taking our time out to have dinner (my mom and I) before we were heading to see Zumanity and we had some time to kill. I asked the waiter if he wouldn't mind waiting a while til we ordered as we were trying to kill some time and relax. He was totally cool with that and got us some drinks as we enjoyed the lovely atmosphere. When we finally ordered, the food and the service couldn't have been more on point. Everything down to the complimentary chefs special of breadsticks and baguettes with dipping oil made the entire night memorable. To top it off we got lucky with it being a Tuesday, which meant it was ladies night which also means 50% off your entire bill as long as there are only females in your group. So with 4 drinks a piece, one app, one salad, two entrees and one side, we ended up spending $80 on a top notch 5* restaurant. Left the waiter a $40 tip and still walked away with less than I would have spent paying full price on a regular night. Nove is apart of the N9NE restaurant group out in Vegas, which includes N9NE Steakhouse at the Palms as well.

Nove had very good food in a nice space with a view from a high floor. The service was OK, but I think that had more to do with the fact that they didn't have enough servers working -- our server seemed to be running a LOT of tables.

We had the Salumi appetizer and although it was excellent, lots of Italian meats and cheeses and a full pizza, it should be scaled to the number of people -- it was way too much food for 2.

For dinner, I had the Lobster Pizza, which was kinda like a lobster/arugula salad on a flat bread -- it was perfect for me, light and fresh.

Hubby had the Shrimp Scampi, it was a good sized portion, lots of shrimp and well-cooked but it was a little bland, could have used more scampi flavor.

Came here for light bites at the bar- menu has a selection of 9 appetizers for $9, cocktails are $14. We ordered 5 apps and dessert, but left confident about returning for a full meal, particularly one with visiting guests who would appreciate the view.

FILET SLIDER: Slider, singular, as in one, for $9. Very tasty with caramelized onions and bleu cheese, but definitely should come in a pair.
CRAB AND LEMON BRUSCHETTA: Speaking of pairs, this dish came in an odd presentation with five tiny crostini. Considering most diners come in pairs, it would make more sense to make your apps more sharable. However, this was very tasty with a good amount of fresh crab and light citrus accents.
FRIED ARTICHOKE: I did not care for this at all. The few fried chunks were served on a bed of shredded lettuce and accompanied by a ""spicy"" orange dipping sauce that didn't taste like much of anything. Pass.
ARANCINI BALLS: Uh, hold the phone. These were delicious. Four plump balls with a thin crust of breading and a bit of sausage inside with the cheeses. This was a better version than the one I ordered at Giadas, that's for sure. 
ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Holy truffle oil, Batman. Generous portion of sprouts, properly roasted til crunchy outside but still tender. But drowning in truffle oil, and oddly interspersed with bits of blackened bacon? I don't know, it was easily the richest batch of Brussels sprouts I've ever had, but it somehow almost worked. Obviously steer clear if truffle oil is a turn off for you.
STRAWBERRY CARPACCIO: Curious name, pretty presentation. Sliced strawberries drizzled with balsamic with a scoop of ice cream and a few sprinkles of granola? It's like a deconstructed parfait but with savory notes. I can't say I'd get it again necessarily, but it was a fun, fresh, and light end to our meal.

Service was very attentive without being overbearing. The two bartenders who helped us were friendly, engaging, and humorous. I wouldn't come back for apps, but definitely plan to try their dinner menu.

2050993,2013-06-10,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Hi,
For my anniversary with my boyfriend, my brother in law bought us a travelzoo type dinner which we used here. The food was good, however we were unable to eat most of it because each course was served within 10 minutes of each other, and the waiter took our first course out of the way before we we're done with it! Fine, no big deal, we started with the second course and yet again the main course was served. I told them to leave the food and not take it as we were still working. It felt like we were rushed the entire time. At one point one of our servers tried to take a plate of food away AS MY BOYFRIEND WAS EATING IT. What? Really? So eventually all our food was gone and we were left with some tiny dessert and a $35 tip requirement that was not expected. Oh, and at one point they dropped a bag of to go food on our table. This confused me because 1. We didn't ask for it and 2. The food they did take away from us they stacked on top of each other, so if it had been our food, that is disgusting and dirty. It turned out to be another tables sloppy salami and pizza that was delivered to us. GROSS. We tried telling the manager politely that the service was awful and that realistically tipping the 'required' amount was absurd since we weren't having a great time. She didn't do anything about it and instead threatened to send in security? For what, letting her know that her management was not up to par for such a high scale and expensive restaurant? I left confused and angry and felt cheated. If they had left us alone the whole time and maybe listened when there was confusion I would have given 5 stars. I am really disappointed, Palms.",13oxuM77OVatt77UsjtP5g,9,1,1,3KZ1strtak8jGuRv4trK4Q

I've been here lots of time being that it was my father in laws go to when he is in town with his clients and I don't blame him. Why risk going anywhere else when you've found a good solid Resturant and they treat you like royalty. 

Being that we never roll in less the 8 plus people deep the check is never under a grand but it's all worth it. The decor is super luxury chic, the back room with fire place and naked bushes over looks the Las Vegas valley with amazing views of the light that just glitters oh so perfectly in the night sky. 

The Resturant staff are always so polite and professional our favorite Kasey who has moved on to SW stake house always waited on use every time we go. The drinks are impeccable and the food....oh the food! First you must try the Nove spaghetti, now this is no regular spaghetti it is a seafood spaghetti with all sorts of goodies in it mix with their amazing house pasta with their perfect red sauce with the right amount of chunk not too thick and far from tart I hate tart sour red sauce. OMG it's so good. Then there is their rosemary bone in stake....Ummm always order stake bone in if you can the extra added flavor it gives if phenomenal ask for a side of wine reduction because they do it just perfect here and a side of their wild mushroom saut√©ed delicious! 

Besides that the whole menu is Devine from the veal to all of the apps and sides you can't go wrong.

2115086,2011-03-24,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"So many restaurants in Vegas are over-hyped, over-priced, and flat-out overrated. While I do not feel that Nove Italiano is completely overrated, I can honestly say I expected a little more.  It was good-- very good --even! But for $$$$, I was expecting one of the best Italian meals I've ever had. Alas, it can't compare to some of the Italian food I've had in North Beach (SF) or even my favorite Italian place in my hood, where the chef is from Italy and imports ingredients from there daily. Not to knock Nove though...

The best part of the meal was the amuse bouche - mushroom bruschetta on crostini and fried polenta. The waiter brought it to us on the house, which apparently we downed all too quickly, so they brought us another round (on accident). We also ordered the Burrata, one of my favorite antipasto dishes, with prosciutto and beets. For an entree, I ordered the rigatoni bolognese, which I realize is not the most 'exotic' Italian dish -- but keep in mind this was a meal before a night of knocking back booze until the wee hours of the morning. Otherwise I would have ordered the Ribeye (I am a steak girl, through and through). Our waiter did say that the restaurant was known for its steaks, so maybe this is what resulted in a 3 star experience. Definitely not bad, and I would even say memorable -- but part of me says that because of the bright pink chandeliers and awesome views. It was overall, a very nice dinner with my best girls! 

*One more note: bartender, please learn how to make a proper lychee martini! I had lychee vodka mixed with other fruit juices -- resulting in a lychee/lemon drop flavor. Awkward.",dBrFv8iwboVNxE5hX74EVQ,0,1,3,9T0RH4WmcHq3Ogd_AzTGNQ

Because N9NE Steakhouse is closed for renovations, they had some items from their menu as well as items from Nove available. 

Drinks were fine, but the mango drink (I forgot what it was called, but it had vodka in it), was pretty thick, so it made it a bit difficult to drink. The taste was fine, but the consistency just wasn't what I expected.

Service was lovely, attentive, but not overly so. We weren't very hungry, so we just ordered appetizers and a side dish.  Let me just say 3 words: LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES!!!!

I was here for work and ate in the private room.  There was a price fixe menu put together for us.  Given this arrangement, I was all the more surprised by this restaurant's ability to properly execute my meal.  And it wasn't just me, a number of people had the same exact problem.

So for starters, we had some sort of sushi thing (odd for an italian restaurant but OK), an antipasto plate which was standard but good, and a shellfish plate consisting of oysters, mussels, crab legs, shrimp, and lobster.  This was the only excellent part of the meal.  Go figure, its the element of the meal that required the least amount of preparation.

We also had a primi piatti of linguini with shrimp and a spicy sauce which was decent.  The problems arose during the secondi piatti.  I ordered the 24 oz. Ribeye steak.  It came out essentially raw in the middle.  I typically like my steak medium rare, so I don't mind a little blood or pinkness in my steak.  But this thing was uncooked in the middle.  And I wasn't the only one.  I think 4 people in my party had to have their steak brought back to the broiler.  And if that wasn't enough, the sides were terrible as well.  The broccolini and polenta basically tasted like nothing.  I am still trying to figure out if the chef simply forgot to season the dishes.  Hopefully, I will never have to go to this restaurant again.  With excellent restaurants such as Nine and Alize residing in the Palms, I fear for the future of this restaurant.

But I have eaten at some nice places so I am putting the actual price of this food at $150, and I'm being generous with that. The taste was equivalent to Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden. Like I said I hope the actual menu is better. If not they are ripping people off. The staff was very nice and attentive but it almost feels like you have a big scarlet letter on you ""V"" for voucher cause the food comes so quickly.

You're greeted by staff in the Palms Hotel, they whisk you away to the 51st floor where a team of gorgeous hostesses take you to your table.  I was at table by the window with an amazing view of the city.  But the real noteworthy thing is the amazing food.  Started with an appetizer easily big enough to be a meal (pesto pizza with chicken).  Dinner was Nove Spaghetti (Scallops, Clams, Shrimp, Calamari with black & white pasta in red sauce) and Penne Ala Vodka with Shrimp.  Both were absolutely divine.  The service was impeccable and the waiter suggested the meatballs as a side which were absolutely the best I've ever had.

Food - averagish Italian food. Massive portions. Seriously, like every other place in Veags, they dish out TONS of food. Probably only need to order 2 appetizers and one entree for three people... at least for 3 females.

Food:

Bread - focaccia bread to start. Cant go wrong there. Definitely need olive oil to go with it.

We ordered the meat and cheese
* Ricotta
* Goat Cheese
* Fig jam
* Prosciutto

It was ok - the bread that came with it wasn't that good - lacking on the amount of prosciutto they give.

Shrimp francese - was recommend - was really good

Octopus - another recommendation - good as well

Nove Veal dish - it was ok...overpriced

Seafood Pasta dish - lot of pasta, not so much seafood....flavor was ok.

Pasta bolognese - This was really good! Loved the pasta - great sauce

Meatballs - really good. Good sauce

Tiramisu - Good

Bread Pudding - great!

Had a Groupon, so we had a different menu than the regular one but I had been forewarned at time of purchase. According to the Groupon you had to make a reservation,  did so on here, Nove even called an hr before to confirm. Nice touch. It's inside the Palms, you check-in and take an elevator ride up to one of the top floors and are escorted to your table. Hubby and I had tickets for a show so we had an early dinner (6pm) Tuesday evening and we were the only ones in there, which was awesome because we had a beautiful view and it felt like the restaurant was open just for us. (Ok, so I was having a delusion of grandeur mixed with romantic sentiment, sue me.) The decor is classy yet comfortable and everyone who greeted us made us feel very welcome.

The food. We had four courses, which was good (taste-wise) and bad (limited choices). Started off with sparkling wine. Prosecco. Delicious.  Got another glass to go with my meal. Arugala salad, also very good. Rigatoni was savory but I couldn't finish it because tomato sauce gives me heartburn but still really good. I got the chicken picatta and the Mr. got steak. Chicken was good but hubby's steak was divine with horseradish potatoes. For dessert, we got cheesecake which was also very good. They even brought me birthday biscotti. Awesome! In all a pretty good meal right? So why four stars and not five? My Groupon included two espresso cocktails that never showed, honestly I was kinda bummed that our waiter forgot since he had done such a good job with everything else but halfway through our meal a big party did show up and we saw less and less of our waiter which was weird because they were seated right next to us. So when the bill came and no cocktails did, I was already done trying to get his attention and ready to go since we did have to catch a show. Should I have spoken up? Yes, most definitely but who brings you biscotti and forgets the espresso. He did not even see us off, the manager did, at the elevators as we were leaving, which was nice but a little too late.  I honestly felt that had we not had the Groupon (which had included 20% tip),  service would had been a little more attentive. In all, I would probably go again but without a Groupon because the food was done very well but the service could have been better, actually I pretty sure it would be because the big group next to us was getting an overabundance of it.",I6rr_u073dPAOz4zsy2RAw,4,3,4,ZufzpD1IcXyz9j5W1KY5Rw

-1 star for the entr√©e I ordered. It just wasn't that great.
It's really a 3 1/2 star review.

We made reservations for a late night dinner. Our table overlooked parts the Palms, the Rio hotel and partial views of The Strip. We got complimentary bread to start off with while our waiter brought out our drinks.

My baked penne pasta with sausages and brocolini was definitely nothing to write home about. It's very filling because it's covered in a thick layer of cheese. I'm not a big fan of cheese....especially if it's overboard like that. The sauce was a semi-spicy tomato sauce. Overall, it's a bland entr√©e. =( I was disappointed. I'm sorry but even dishes at Olive Garden tastes better. I know, I know....a lot of you may be hatin' on me right now...but sorry. That pasta dish wasn't good...so I advise you to pick a different dish other than the BAKED PENNE PASTA.

My special someone ordered a Flat Iron steak entr√©e and he loved it. It was cooked to his perfection.
We got some side dishes; compliments of the chef. Our favorite side dish was the loaded mashed potatoes. (I'm sure someone already took a picture of that.)

Just when we're already super full.....out comes the waiter with a complimentary dessert!!!!!! My goodness.....we're are NOT dessert people at all but I felt bad to not take a bite out of our cheese cake drizzled in raspberry sauce + chocolate chocolate cake. WOW!!!!! The cheesecake was delicious...the raspberry really helped balance the ""heaviness-filling"" feeling of the cheesecake.

We definitely walked outta there with our tummies super full.
Will I be back? Yes, I would. I'll just order a different entr√©e. The view is too gorgeous to pass up and not eat here again.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,5,3,4,GFMKa9m3XqDcsUFU-XjnMw

The manager comped us some champagne & an appetizer, & the waitstaff was very attentive.  The food was AMAZING, & I am very hard on Italian food, coming from an Italian family from NY.  The caprese was to die for (cheese literally melted in your mouth like butter, & tomatoes were so sweet).  Meatballs were out of this world! Very flavorful & tender.  Pauly shore was at the table next to us too haha.  They also walked us up to moon & playboy club.. But I've found the free comps to be true for girls anywhere in the palms or on the strip.

The space is amazing with clear views of the strip and dessert and the beautiful interior design.

I have to admit the food was a little on the salty side during my first visit but that's pretty typical.
I had a friend complain about her filet mignon but she didn't speak up so nothing happened.
My ribeye was cooked to perfection and I didn't think it was too salty.
Also tried a plethora of appetizers and they were even having a wine bottle sale, 30% off when I went!
We were sat upstairs on my first visit.

My second visit was with my family.
I wanted to show them how beautiful it was with good food! 
My mom's a sucker for views.

I noticed many restaurants closing down inside this hotel and I really hope this place stays open.
It might possibly be because their prices are somewhat reasonable and they have a good range that starts low to high.
I really wanted to try N9NE but heard it's closed and Alize is gone too. RIP.",Uit6vvFxthHbwOHIYI0sfQ,2,2,4,cq7a6mEuX8oQMzDjNVax_w
2799027,2010-07-14,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Had another AMAZING dinner at Nove Italiano tonight.

It was date night and we were meeting another couple.  It was also the first time that I was seated in the area at the back of the restaurant with the awesome view of the strip.

I started with a Pimmp's cup (Pimm's, Hendrick's gin, cucumber, strawberry, apple).  It was refreshing and not too sweet, but I don't think I'll be ordering it again any time soon.

We decided to eat everything family style; pretty much order a bunch of food  and just share.

We had the house-made salumi, calamari, fried squash blossoms and the shrimp francaise. It was nice to try the 4 or 5 different cured meats/sausages on the salumi platter. Calamari was served hot with peppers, fresh grated parm and a splash of lemon.  The squash blossoms were stuffed with diced zucchini and king crab, then battered, fried and served with a nice lemon butter sauce; a nice change from the ""traditional"" ricotta filling.  The shrimp francaise was yummy; dipped in nice egg batter, pan-fried (i think) and with a similar (if not the same) lemon butter sauce.

Chef sent out some nice individual Caesar salads: whole hearts of romaine dressed with a light, almost lemony, Caesar dressing and a couple of garlicky, parmesan croutons. Delicious.

For the main course, we shared a balsamic rib eye, whole sea bass, and osso bucco with risotto and English peas with Polenta and asparagus as our sides.

We ordered the rib eye medium and it was grilled to perfection.  They marinate their steaks in olive oil, garlic and herbs before grilling them.  The tanginess of the balsamic vinegar complimented the rich, fatty ribeye well. 2 or 3 slices was plenty for me.

The sea bass was served whole (with the skeleton/bones removed table side) tasty and served with a nice salsa verde.  I wasn't really in a fishy mood, though.

The osso bucco was good.  So tender it had fallen off the bone and I was able to ""cut"" through it with a spoon.  I loved the risotto with peas that it was served with... and I don't usually like risotto, but this one was creamy and rich and perfectly cooked; not too hard and not too mushy.

The polenta was rich and delicious and served topped with ragout (meat sauce) and shaved parmesan.

The asparagus was grilled (I think) and topped with a fried egg.  SO good when you pop the yolk and let it drip all over the place.

I'm new at the whole wine thing, so I can't properly describe (or remember) the wines we had.  I know there was a red, and an Italian white (which had a bit of a bubble to it; I had thought it was a sparkling wine that went flat) and a nice dessert wine (santo vino or vino santo... like I said, I'm new to this)   We also had a round of Espresso shots and some sort of sweet, creamy, almost caramelly shot.

DESSERT the main event in my book ;)

My boyfriend LOVES the cheesecake, but it was a bit heavy for me after our super rich meal.  It IS delicious though.  Made with mascarpone in the actual cheesecake and frosted with a mascarpone cream and with a kind of butter cookie crust in place of the ""traditional"" graham cracker.

My favorite is the Strawberry Carpaccio.  Thin sliced strawberries artfully arranged, drizzled with balsamic reduction, topped with toasted panko and served with a scoop of creme fraiche sorbet.  Light, refreshing AND delicious.

Our friend ordered the chocolate bread, which I had heard stories of but always forget to order.  Crusty, grilled Italian bread with white chocolate and hazelnuts served with a generous quinelle of dark chocolate ganache drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt.  It may sound odd to some, but trust me, it works.  It was delicious.


Bottom Line:
It may be pricey for some, but OMG it's worth it.  My boyfriend and I rarely have a date night without our daughter, but maybe 2 out of 3 of our last ones were at Nove (we have brought her daughter here once with no problems at all, we just decided not to tonight)  The food, the view, the service.

Upscale classical decor, great variety of dishes, and fairly romantic, definitely a place to take your date to.  The vibe at Nove is a little more upbeat than the traditional French decor at Alize.  I see a younger crowd at Nove then Alize.  

The food was unexpectedly pleasing and well done.  In a fierce competitive high end dining industry in Vegas, Nove probably not a typical first choice for a lot of tourists, however I'd recommend trying it out and enjoy the glitz of the ""city that never sleeps"" with some great food and wine.",P561nJlF8nDFzyHgrWkARA,1,0,4,POSZHLqwcYnzzbA4NOo1Pg
2807802,2017-03-08,2,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"The idea of Nove was exciting - a high end Italian restaurant with a 51st floor view.  Sounds great.  But when I took a look at the Yelp reviews, it came across as being kind of hit and miss.  And it turns out that both of those things are true.

The room is very nicely appointed, and the view is great; although, strangely, the room is not situated to maximize the view of the Strip.  The view from Alize (the other Palms ""view restaurant"") is better.  

The food is better too, or at least more consistent.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was okay but rather strongly flavored for my taste.  My entree was the Veal Milanese.  The veal itself was tender and tasty, but the breading was over-fried and detracted from the dish.  The Death By Potatoes side, though, was fantastic - fluffy whipped potatoes mixed with bacon (I guess it's actually pancetta, but it tasted like bacon) and mascarpone.  I could eat that for my entree if we go back.  My wife really like her Caprese salad and her Lobster Mezzaluna.  

There were also a lot of little things that detracted from the dining experience.  The drinks were a stingy pour and, oddly, my scotch on the rocks did not come on the rocks, but rather came neat with a glass of ice on the side.  I've never seen a restaurant do that before, and I don't quite get the point.  The bread plate consisted of various flavors of foccacia bread, but served without butter or olive oil.  I expect they would have brought us some if we asked, but again - it was strange.  Yelp had warned us to be very clear that we didn't want bottled water, so we dodged that bullet.

Service was acceptable, but not great.  Our server, Ernest, was friendly but I'm pretty sure that his answers to some our questions were inaccurate.  Everything was served timely, so that was good.  But when the check came it was all mixed up.  Half of what was listed reflected things we had ordered, but the other half seemed to be the order of some other table.  By that time we were ready to leave and we didn't want to sit around while the staff tried to unscramble the mistake, and the total probably would have come out about the same, so we just paid it as was.  Still, that's pretty sloppy stuff.

I was struck by the fact that the room was pretty empty.  The 51st floor of the Palms Hotel could have been devoted to half a dozen penthouse suites that would go for $5,000 a night or more, so I found myself wondering how long they could keep this space as a half empty restaurant.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,1,0,3,xNfGSz0qXgSArzjcls4Vrw

I couldn't decide between the lobster ravioli and the risotto, so my waiter offered to give me a half-plate of each...the risotto even showed up with scallops (which was not expected).

Since we had to eat before everything closed, we decided the best way was to have our concierge find us a place in the Palms and to get us table service at a club in the hotel.

Anyway, when I was told about this place, I was expecting it to be overpriced (although worthwhile for the convenience) mediocre food.  Admittedly I was a bit surprised.  The restaurant is high up on one of the towers of the Palms, and has great views of the Strip and the city, so that was a good start.  The food was all pretty good.  I had ravioli, but I tried items that my friends ordered, including tortelini, sea bass, and bone-in fillet steak.  Everything was really tasty here, and so my mediocre expectation was shattered.  It was still a bit overpriced, with dishes running from $25-45, but I was satisfied with the meal.

This review is ridiculously overdue but I really wanted to leave one since the food and service here was BEYOND amazing!

Everyone here from our server, Sladjan to the manager, to Chef Marlon himself was absolutely a delight to be around.

The Food, oh my goodness, the food! We were so satisfied with every course we just kept eating despite being ridiculously full!

We started with the amuse bouche of a fried almost risotto ball (amazing!) followed by an appetizer for each of us. I got the lobster bisque (soo good! Creamy with just a little punch of spice but nothing too overpowering) and one of the special of the day's salads (delicious!). After that was our ""special scallop dish"" (THANK YOU CHEF MARLON!) Oh My Gawsh! I have never had a more perfectly cooked scallop and all the sauces on that plate were just one amazing flavor after another. After that we each had an entree, I had the special seafood and squid ink spaghetti and my friend had the lamb. By now we are STUPID full but we couldn't stop eating just because everything was soooo good!

And then finally was dessert, we weren't sure what we wanted or even if we wanted anything since we couldn't even finish our entrees (Which BTW, we totally took with us TO GO even though we were heading over to GhostBar right after dinner. Didn't care, was going to find a way to get those meals home to eat the next day...or well at 2 am after the club haha). But Chef Marlon and Sladjan had one more surprise for us, a coffee dessert! Now, I don't like coffee. I don't drink it since I don't like the taste or smell but this was AMAZING! I totally ate it despite feeling full and it was so good! So thanks for that, I am now forever ruined with coffee since nothing will ever taste as good as that expresso shot at the bottom.

Now just an editors note here: I had this meal back in the end of May...it's now the end of July and I can still remember what I ate (for the most part) and what it tasted like...THAT's how GOOD everything was!

Overall, if I could give more than 5 stars I would. I will definitely be back EVERY time I visit Las Vegas! Thank you so much to the entire staff of Nove and to Chef Marlon! This was the most amazing experience of my Las Vegas trip! Hope to see you guys again really soon! :D",TWSLsOHvKMmqI8l_O7hgKA,6,1,5,c-eC6UmJlfXa86-AZgoIJw
2873314,2010-02-14,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Overall, a good meal.  Food was quite good and menu was well varied in options and choices.  Waiter service was hit or miss.  Hostess stand service was friendly, but needed some improvement.  Design of restaurant on 51st floor was a missed opportunity.  Value about average.  See details below.

Hostess Stand - 2.5/5:  Had 6:45pm reservation, arrived at 6:40pm.  Table was not ready, invited to sit at the bar and order a drink (where we ordered a bottle of wine.)  Table was not ready until 7:20pm.  Should have been offered a cocktail for table being ready 35 minutes after reservation, but was not.

Service at table - 2.5/5:  Main waiter was somewhat hard to find and a bit aloof (the restaurant is fairly poorly designed which contributed to this, more on that later), asked to see regular menu and price fix menu, was told that price fixe no longer available (which I do not believe to be the case).  One item ordered was never delivered (and did not show up on the bill - so perhaps a lack of attention here). Food servers and busboys were quite good, somewhat made up for main waiter issues.

Food - 4/5:  Quality of food was quite good.  Bread service with oil, parmagianno and pepper flake was good, caesar salads were good, fresh, properly prepared/dressed, arancini were good, ordered the short rib ravioli, quite good, although a little light on the portion, also ordered sunday gravy pasta, excellent, high quality, generous portion, death by potatoes ordered but never served.  Wine list was extensive with some reasonable options.

Design/Ambience - 2/5:  Nice interiors, but many fatal flaws.  Did not take advantage of location on the 51st floor of Palm's Fantasy tower, perimeter banquettes face towards the interior, not the view outside, interior tables do not get good view due to being blocked by banquettes.  Sat at banquette side by side with wife (which was ok, but did not allow us to easily face each other while talking) and we looked at interior/bar, no view outside.  Also, they put flat screens on windows looking outside - very odd decision, distracts/blocks view.  Bar has best view as it is raised, but is most distant from view.  Missed opportunity by designers and owner - this restaurant could be on the first floor of the hotel and it would not miss the 51st floor location.  Kitchen is far down a hall - leads to delayed service and likely exhausted wait staff.  Music too loud for conversation.  Very mixed crowd - familiies, couples, military, clubbers with very little clothing, party groups, etc...

Price - Prices were about right based on 'high-end' status of restaurant.  Wine list has some good options, many items quite expensive.  Noted several people bring own wine (odd for this type of restaurant) - not sure of corkage fees.  Liked the menu structure - could eat a multi-course meal, or more tasting style - many options here.

Overall Value - 3/5:  Based on high-end status - would rank about average here.  If this were a neighborhood or casino restaurant not on the 51st floor of a hotel tower, with a slightly lower price point and the same food, value would rank a 4/5.",Oixv0VgElz8pxQFp2lkdJg,2,1,3,REm_nQ3edN1GYUGChcMZXw

2923600,2012-05-24,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"My experience at Nove started with setting up the reservations.  I found it quite odd that they were so open for the night and the rest of the week, and exclaimed that I did not need to make a reservation.  Many of the restaurants I dine with require a day or more advanced reservation; some even a week or more.  

The decor of this restaurant is absolutely stunning, but that's where the stunning ends.  I brought a very rare and expensive bottle of wine for dinner, and was unable to enjoy it.  Apparently they have a non-corkage policy, which is fine, except that this is not mentioned on their website, and their wine list is deplorable.  Ended up drinking water with dinner! 

Next comes the wait staff, who was a self-proclaimed Thomas Keller trained waiter.  I find this hard to believe because, we had no waiter during the course of our dinning experience.  I have family and friends that work at the French Laundry, and various Thomas Keller restaurants, and I can say this waiter has never seen Thomas Keller.  I must mention though that our busser was absolutely amazing, and I wish he was our waitstaff.  

Next, we received two appetizers that were complete onion bombs; my guess is to hide the flavor of the fish. Again not impressed, and the bread that came along was stale.  Finally the meal arrives, and I must say that it was delicious, but very over priced.  I could get the same thing in the Napa Valley for half the price and ten times the taste.  The duck I had was over cooked, and their were no vegetables served with any of the meals.  The chicken marsala was good, but the sauce was too gravy like in consistency.

All in all the service is better at your local Taco Bell, the food is mediocre and over priced, and the wine list can be described in one word: ""Crap.""  Anyone that gave this place 5 stars does not know a thing about fine dinning.  I generously gave this place two stars, and that was because of the decor.  My recommendation (i.e., if you want to fill your nightly reservations) for this restaurant would be to fire the chef, get a wait staff, and add a corkage.",kxNo8AU7Z3yYW6RteTE69w,0,1,2,2Ow9BANaIX8_IF9eFPtHZw

The change of reservation was handled smoothly and with courtesy. The food didn't disappoint, the appetizer of our choice (grilled octopus) as well as the one our server selected for us (crab cakes) were both flavorful and gone in seconds. Not one person at the table had an entree in front of them that didn't make at least one of us steal a bite. The Gnocchi Gorgonzola was amazing, the Osso Bucco was a plate I could only wish to recreate at home. One friend had a simple cappelini pasta dish with tomatoes and basil and I ended up finishing it for her (possibly uninvited) because it was cooked and seasoned to perfection. I think the star of the table was the risotto, so creamy and full of flavor that it almost became a tug of war to see who got the last bite. The server Jorge was attentive and funny throughout the meal and even brought us a housemade cheesecake which was clearly made that day (Delicious!)

I went here for my birthday dinner and it was incredible. We started at the bar and grabbed a couple drinks before getting to the table. We had to wait on a few more people to show up. We order some standard drinks to start the night. After waiting we were seating in a table with a view of the other tower. It was so beautiful. We had some cool big booty bushes. We started the meal with a champagne toast and then also order a bottle. They were clearing some inventory so we got a bottle for like $40. We started with the meatball appetizer and started to order our entrees. I started with a Caesar salad and also ordered the 8oz filet mignon. The Caesar salad came out with full romaine leafs which was different but cool. Everyone ordered something a little different. My coworker ordered the pennine alla vodka and it was yummy. I love vodka. I mean i love vodka sauces. :) 
During our meals we also ordered some drinks. There were jager shots, lemon drops, Moscow mules, and even the tiramisu cocktail. All the drinks were delicious and make to look exquisite. After some drink I was surprised by some yummy dessert. There was cheesecake and chocolates and just yumm in my mouth. I was really glad we got to enjoy Nove.

My first time here was for my boyfriends birthday a few years ago. Since then we had been back for a Chef's tasting with Chef Geno with 15 courses. A few of our favorite dishes included the risotto of the day, Nana's meatballs, chicken Marsala, and the death by potatoes. This was my first and only time dining here since the chef I had grown to love moved on to other ventures. 
I still had faith that Nove would be a great place without Chef Geno. The menu was almost the same. The crowd wasn't. The waiter even mentioned when we asked, that the new chef was ""completely different"". Not bad, just not the same. 
Well I think he was being polite. The exact same chicken Marsala dish looked the same but tasted totally different. The meatballs and potatoes were still decent. The gnocchi was too mushy. And the risotto, oh I wouldn't know as they offered it as the special, and then ran out. I waited 20 minutes and ate my entire appetizer before my drink arrived. And there was no new chef coming out to check on us, see how we liked the food, or introduce himself. This always happened in past times when Nove was not busy. Considering we were there late, and the Chef was in view- it could have happened. 
Maybe my expectations were set too high, but I have had totally different experiences in the past. All of them made me feel great about spending $150-300 for dinner for 2. 
Right now I am thankful I had a discount on my tickets from the Lisa Lampanelli show, because I would have been mad to pay full price last night.

Appetizers were great.  Tried the grilled octopus.  Then the chef sent out some small apps, compliments of the house.

Entrees were great.  Tried the filet with their outstanding balsamic reduction.  My wife had the veal scaloppini and loved it.  We also shared some grilled asparagus and seasonal mushrooms. 

Customer service is excellent.  The waiter named Alex as well as the busboy were both very professional and attentive.

Went there during a business trip with my boss and the scene was very nice. I have to say that the service was 5 stars. It almost bordered on too much service. We never felt rushed but we had a few people helping us rather than one waiter. 

The restaurant itself is very nice and we were seated over in a corner more which was nice because we could talk a little more freely. It gets pretty loud in there if it is busy which it was that night. 

I ordered the Nove spaghetti which was really good but not spectacular. I have had better dishes when it comes to remembering the food. It had a ton of fish and it was fresh. The scallops were awesome though. No complaints but not the best I have ever had. Close though. 

My boss got the heirloom tomato salad and he said that was really good. He also got the black bass which he said it was good BUT here is where one star comes off. It was served whole which is OK but they did not fillet it or anything so there were bones in every bite. He finally had to ask the waiter to fillet it but it didn't really help. His quote was "" the taste is great but if I am paying this much I don't want to work this hard for my meal"" 

Overall great dinner and good service. The wine selection is also pretty killer.",R14v5Ii-B2mtuv3m1-1lNA,0,0,4,bZ4saDxbdwJjjl8NgcsGjw

I had my doubts about this restaurant because I generally don't like fine dining Italian since I ALWAYS leave hungry after paying a hefty price! Not the case at all here at Nove Italiano! I came here last night in celebration of my anniversary! We usually do the normal super upscale steakhouse type of place however this year was different! I really wanted to switch it up and since we both love Italian, why not?

For starters it was a little weird getting here at first because we originally booked a reservation through opentable.com which by the way they were offering a 1,000 pts for dinner on the 9:30 PM reservation. When we arrived a few minutes late there was no host at the booth and I was a bit mad at first. But I just called them and they said bypass the ropes and head on up on the elevator! Ahhh once you step off the 51st floor we were immediately greeted by the sweet hostess and of course noticed the romantic ambiance with a killer view!

This place offered either a free appetizer (caprese salad) or a free desert (some sort of butter cake). We went with the caprese salad and YUM! Well worth checking in and getting this for free! Our waiter was awesome and really helpful as we were so indecisive on the menu selections! Finally came down to the Chicken Parmagina! Yes two orders of that please! Although it took some time to come out it was well worth the wait! I am extremely impressed with both the service and food!

The octopus salad I had was was probably the best thing.  The octopus was very tender.

The chicken marsala had mushrooms and chicken but seemed to lack the marsala part of the dish.  Was still decent, but definitely not what I would have expected.  The veal nove was pretty good and I would consider getting that if I came back again.  

Their death by potatoes was different, but super rich.  The garlic and cheese fried potatoes were not good at all.  Do not get those.

Their cheesecake which was made with marscapone was pretty good
They also have a cannoli dessert where you make your own cannolis and get all kinds of things to top it with.  That was fun but didn't have the same ricotta taste as most cannolis.

The Nove Spaghetti entr√©e contains lobster, shrimp, crab, scallop, calamari and basil mixed in with the pasta. This dish did not meet my expectations because it was very short on seafood. Considering the price it could have been better executed. The Caprese Salad is a little different than most in that it is made with roasted tomatoes. I expected the tomatoes to be warm but it was totally a cold dish. A very tasty version of an old standby. The Filet Mignon was tender and cooked as requested. We shared the Death by Potatoes which was more than enough for two people. The menu does not explain the potato dish but it is mashed potatoes with crispy pancetta and truffle oil.

3275814,2014-03-01,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"There are many reasons to go to Vegas, but in recent years one of the biggest draws has been food.  Vegas has evolved into a Western Mecca for fine dining and has amassed an impressive collection of restaurants from some of the finest chefs in the world in the process.  

Plan well ahead though.  The best of the best book up fast, and without a reservation you be stuck with something almost as expensive but far less impressive. Which brings us to Nove Italiano.  

Located on one of the top most floors of the Palms, the elevator ride and the view are probably the most impressive aspects of this restaurant and those are... well they're not bad, but it isn't awe inspiring either.  

What you end up getting is a restaurant that seems like a clone of the Il Fornaio chain.  The service is pretty good, very friendly, but woefully under informed.  Our first waiter had difficulty answering basic questions about the restaurant's menu items and wine list.  After that we had a different waiter the rest of the night who made as little conversation as possible.  

The menu itself was relatively basic.  In fact in the comparison to Il Fornaio, Il Fornaio comes out on top in terms of creativity and the sense of eager anticipation that should come when you read a menu.  There was no, ""Oh that sounds good I have that.""  That you hope for from either the menu or the specials.  Instead it was very much, ""Umm do you guys have anything else?""

Fortunately for me, I was also enjoying the company of a woman whose beauty was so distracting that I barely noticed the food anyway.  
   
As for Nove Italiano, The food isn't bad, but it certainly isn't very impressive either.  Given all of the other dining options in and around Las Vegas, Nove Italiano is more a disappointing and overpriced option for people who want to go out but couldn't get a reservation someplace else.",b-r-HhJG7Adopj_c10jk-A,2,0,3,yJpNeBZ7LvL2ogzDi85aMw

3399712,2010-04-28,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"So i believe that the dinner experience involves 3 important things: food quality, ambience, and customer experience.while the first 2 were pretty good at nove, the third was an incredibly negaitve experience and I knew I had to share my thoughts on this place. i came here this past friday night at 8pm to celebrate my birthday with 2  girlfriends.
Food- the food was very tasty and delicious.  we ordered the appetizer mozarella pizza and it was good. it has a thin, crispy crust and nice flavor to it.  i ordered the linguini with clams in white sauce and it was tasty as well. it had copious amounts of garlic slices throughout which gave it a strong flavor and lots of big clams as well.  im glad i read reviews before going because i got the heads up on portion size which was huge, even though i ordered the half size.  i knew i was going to go upstairs to moon right after, so didnt want to have leftovers with me.  my friends ordered the rigatoni and the pennetta and they both were delicious. the pennetta came with a variety of these fresh, cherry-like tomatoes that were yummy as well.  for dessert, we had the peach berry fizz which was sooo good. it came with peach sorbetto, fresh berries, and was topped off with moscato, it was fantastic and refreshing!
ambience-  club like atmosphere and loud music. it had a great view and we were seated in a booth right by the window. 
customer service-  i was so looking forward to a great night out, with dinner and a club just 2 floors up.  reservations were booked easily on opentable and i got a call the afternoon of to confirm the reservation.  we were seated promptly by the nice hostess and soon greeted by the waiter. sounds great so far, right? it was up until the waiter( who was a 6 foot something, skinny, guy, with a flavor saver, half goatee thing, in his 20's) and the other waiter assistant? (i think his name was Cesar?he was shorter and had a bald head and a goatee) realized that we weren't high rollers and weren't ordering 3 appetizers, soup and salad add ons, and expensve bottles of wine did their attitudes change.  it was especially obvious that they began to lose interest in giving us exceptional customer service as the night went on.  they were kind of pushy in the beginning with quickly getting our orders. but after serving the food, the tall waiter guy stopped showing any interest in us.  it was also made evident that they were treating us different because there was an older lady's birthday in the booth next to us, and not only did they bring her a dessert with a candle and say happy birthday, but a manager came out to give birthday wishes to her as well.  none of this happened in my case. im not trying to be whiny about these small things, but when you have something to compare to right next to you, you become more aware of the difference in treatment.  and isnt it the small details that make the biggest difference in the experience? when my friend asked the waiter about what they do for birthdays, he said that the older lady requested the candle especially and they don't do anything special...i find that hard to believe.  i really feel that the waiters shunned our party once they found out we weren't going to drop hundreds of dollards that night, but isnt that considered discrimination? shouldnt all patrons of an establishment be treated with the same superior customer service, especially in a fine dining establishment? when the bill came, the waiter didnt even say ""thank you"" or ""take your time"" he just left it on the table as he walked by.  we had a question about the club moon upstairs and asked another waiter or busser, and she said she didnt know much about it but would talk to our waiter about it.  we saw her go talk to him in the corner. they went back and forth a few times, and then nothing happened.  he didnt come back to our table and mention that he heard we had questions. he continued to ignore us and never came back except as he was about to go to another table and did a quick hand movement and grabbed the bill extremely quickly. no thank you, no happy birthday, no how was your food.  i was getting so angry and annoyed, and couldnt believe what was happening. my friends did not want me to get upset and stressed, so they went to the front to talk to the hostess to get more information about getting to the club upstairs. the hostess was very nice and told them what door to go through. i just wanted to leave the restaurant at that point so we got up to go.  the bouncer at the door indicated that a manager would have to walk us to the door to get access to upstairs and soon after, the hostess and the manager (who was very nice and had dark rimmed glasses) came by to let us through.  all the while, i see that tall waiter at the corner staring at us, probably waiting to see if we were going to complain about him.  i was so annoyed, i just wanted to leave the restaurant but vowed i would share my awful experience",qG-8noJuP96LYjqpYHqyZA,2,0,1,-M_wLMPFz1U6mFydIrcKRQ

Not appropriate in public at a gourmet restaurant.. As for the atmosphere, in spite of the lovely views from the floor-to-ceiling windows, the place somehow came across like a fancy coffee shop - the  tables and the booths just didn't work.  

The restaurant also was dark - but not dark/romantic like so many charming Italian places,  just dark.

The wait staff was good - while it's true that they removed plates from my buddy  before everyone (me) was finished that is not uncommon in the U.S., so I will overlook it.

My friend had a steak - he thought it was very good. I had the Spaghetti nove (seafood) with some kind of dark spaghetti mixed in - also good and the spaghetti done al dente as it should be. But frankly not outstanding.

We had a bottle of wine - a good Merlot (no, not an oxymoron) that should have been $40-50 but was $125 - well it's Vegas.

Upon departure they had to call the elevator from the lobby (the buttons were disabled) and it took a full 10 minutes.

Dinner for 2 including tax/tip/wine was $350. Pasta Mia down the block in a strip mall is better at 1/4 the price.

And it was empty at 7:30PM on a Friday night. Evidently I am not the only person disappointed.

At that point I was just a smidge irritated so I didn't even mention anything when I probably should've due to an available window seat the entire time we were there. Just the point of the fact that this is why I call ahead of time and make a reservation.

Besides that, service was great. Food was great (huge portions) and a nice lounge-like atmosphere. Not huge, wasn't over crowded. Will possibly be back but not somewhere I'm dying to go back to. A-OK",Y8ix6_U_R3qcOsZcLvzHdg,0,0,3,ScY289_TtZFt1kPej6oz-Q

The decor is clean and unique.  We were fortunate enough to sit in a long corridor of the dining room that gave breath taking views of he strip.  Aligning the booths were towering bushes in the form of female silhouettes.  The manager was nice enough to take photos of us and bring us to a second level bar area for more photo ops. 

The service was phenomenal.  We had a pair of gentleman waiters--one for our beverages and the other for our meal.  They both gave great recommendations and were extremely attentive.  The flow of the dinner was natural.  Not once did I feel as though we were waiting too long or that anything came out too quickly.  Oftentimes, my water was refilled or a plate was cleared and I didn't notice, they were like service magicians.

Everything we tried was tasty.  The calamari appetizer had a unique banana pepper twist and was cooked perfectly.  They also presented us with a complimentary amuse bouche.  I was boring and ordered penne with bolognese sauce.  The pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente and I normally don't find when ordering pasta dishes at other restaurants.  I forget what the name of my boyfriend's pasta, however it was a lighter take on a stuffed noddle with a cream sauce, still delicious.

Our Nove dining experience was exceptional and everything I had hoped for when visiting Las Vegas.  The ambiance was intimate and updated, the service prompt and friendly, and the food savory spins on classic dishes.  I would love to go back on my next visit to Vegas or at the very least visit other restaurants in the Nine family.",Y0vLsAXCmvTuV1v-ePpc-g,0,0,5,xJ8Mzeftob3HP9j6uzy0Ag

The N9NE Steakhouse is decent, but relative to the scene in Vegas, it's a Honda surrounded by Bimmers and Porsches.  No, the Palms is a place to go if you are young and think the Real World Las Vegas was a ""classic"" TV show.  Nove actually changes the model though - it's the best place to eat in the resort, and it's one of my favorite choices in Vegas (all things considered).

The atmosphere is great - you're higher than the famed Ghostbar with views of Vegas and the suburbs all around.  It's connected to the Playboy Club and Moon (separate cover required), so it's a one-stop destination for a group ready to party.

The staff is attentive, friendly, and personable.  You can ask questions without feeling stupid or out of place, although anytime I talk to women that pretty, I tend to blush anyway... I'm shy!

But the food is really enjoyable.  It's not the fanciest place in town, but it's a better bargain than some of the more famous restaurants, it's easier to get a reservation (you can always eat at the bar, too), and they serve healthy portions.  A little on the pricey side, but not as outrageous as other places in town - after all, this is Vegas!

The guys will like the outfits the female staff wear, plus the great food.  The ladies will like the view and the great food.

PROS:
- Great food
- Fun, friendly staff
- Incredible view, convenient to Moon and the Playboy Club

3574035,2011-03-17,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"The food here was good, but to be honest, I expected more. After drinking yardlongs all day (it was spring break, don't judge!) I didn't have a huge appetite so I just ordered two small plates instead of an entree. I started with the crudo--a fresh selection of sashimi, generously cut, with lemon and olive oil. Simple, it made a good beginning for the meal. I then had the raviolo, which combined a couple of my favorite ingredients: raw egg yolk, pancetta, and truffles. Sadly, it fell flat of my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I really couldn't taste the truffles at all. A little bit of a tragedy. It was also a tad oversalted and the slightest bit undercooked (and I always prefer my pasta very al dente, so this is a rare criticism from me).

I might give Nove Italiano four stars based solely on the food. Unfortunately, the ambiance and the service left a lot to be desired here. With the intimate space and the amazing view, there's so much potential here...but some genius thought that a pleasant accompaniment to a romantic evening at an upscale italian restaurant would be club music pumping through the speakers. Alright, I'll probably be heading up to Moon later, but I'm not trying to get my dance on while I chew my pasta. I'm not saying i need a violin serenading me at the table, but perhaps something a little more lowkey would be more appropriate.

I also felt that our waiter, while not unpleasant, didn't seem to have any grasp of the menu whatsoever. And at a restaurant where I'm likely paying $60+ for my meal? You should probably get more than 1/3 of the fishes in the crudo correct (""white tuna"" and ""tuna"" are hardly interchangeable). You should probably know that the appropriate response when I ask if you would recommend the raviolo is not, ""It's basically bacon and eggs."" You should probably, at the very least, be able to give a rough estimate of the portion sizes. Our waiter couldn't handle any of this. Maybe he was new, or having a bad day, or there was some other explanation for his ill-preparedness. It still rubbed me the total wrong way. I would consider coming back here again for the food, but if I don't, I don't think I'll be too upset.",zFCuveEe6M-ijY1iy23IJg,1,0,3,5jDwqsmYJOZASM-_5jFt4Q

 - Located on the 51st floor the views are amazing. Greeted at the top of the elevator by our hostess we were escorted to our table overlooking part of the strip.
-Octopus Alla Griglia. Perfect strips of Octopus that had a grilled taste with a consistency of steak over a fris√©e, Meyer lemon sauce and dabs of balsamic. My first Octopus experience and i hope this is what to always expect, an amazing starter
-Calamari Fritti. Fried calamari accompanied by banana peppers this was a nice starter as well
-Capunti Bolognase. Hand rolled pasta with a perfect bolognase sauce. I normally wouldn't order bolognase out since I enjoy making my own but I have it a try and I really enjoyed it. We had so much food, this was taken as leftovers and was just as good the next day heated in a skillet. I would definitely order this again
-Potato Gnocchi. Ordered as a side this could have been an entire. If I knew it was a bigger portion I may not have ordered it and I would have missed out on a dish that had me thinking about my return trip. Served with pancetta, greens, peas, a white cream sauce and a poached egg. A very rich dish and may a little heavy on the garlic to some, I felt it was just perfect. 
 - the service was not short of expectational. Anthony was our server and he did have some help but he was there as we needed for drinks and before every course to make sure we enjoyed every aspect of our visit.

Number nine, number nine...."" 
-John Lennon & Paul McCartney, songwriters

Nove translates to the number 9 and apparently was named after the restaurant N9NE closed within the Palms Resort.  But, don't let the number fool you as this Italian restaurant is located higher than the 9th Floor on the 51st floor.  

We dined at this restaurant several years ago and the thoughts about their dish called ""Nonna's Sunday Dinner"", fine wine selections and gorgeous panoramic night view drew us here.  However, over the years, things have changed as Nonna's Sunday Dinner was no longer on the menu and the wine selections seemed to have decreased significantly.  The constant that remained was the panoramic city view.

Earlier in the afternoon, we left The Strip and ended up at the Palms where we spent some time gambling until our dinner reservation came up.  I will say that I have a bad habit of letting my stomach ""rule"" my time so even though we might be on a winning streak, I will stop for my dining reservation.  My husband, on numerous occasions, has given me ""stink eye"" or has just sent me off to dine alone if he's on a streak.  So I respectfully wouldn't want anyone to think that I'd rush them off...besides, I can drink alone. Hahaha.

FOOD
-Beef Carpaccio:  IMHO, unusally bright red but, tender and mild flavored.  Lots of capers, arugula, basil a√Øoli, and parmigiano reggiano.  I liked how the saltiness from the capers, a√Øoli and Parmesan worked together with the spicy arugula.

-Charred Octopus:  nicely charred with hints of rosemary and tender to the bite octopus served with fris√©e, citrus emulsion.  I'm not sure if it was because we were nearing the end of our trip, but, to us, the fris√©e and citrus emulsion did nothing to add to the flavors.

-Tagliatelle Bolognese:  this al dente or toothsome tagliatelle was enriched with this meaty and flavorful Bolognese sauce.  The San Marzano tomatoes weren't overly acidic and balanced the rich meatiness.  A healthy sprinkle of pecorino romano rounded out the flavors with its nuttiness and subtle saltiness.  The pasta was good but not outstanding for the type or class of restaurant.

-Veal Nove:  Not my dish but my husband ordered it.  Veal scallopine topped with prosciutto and arugula.  I managed to get a tiny slice of the veal which was slightly chewy and mild.  The prosciutto added a refined saltiness to the dish.  I guess that my husband really enjoyed this dish as he wiped the plate.

The restaurant wasn't busy at all but the ambiance made for a nice quiet dining experience.  Our server was attentive enough but she spoke softly and we wondered if we were suffering hearing loss as we had to ask her to repeat several times.  I guess we expected more from this restaurant in terms of flavors given that we've dined here before.",HH7iiWvBqV-20lA7JlSRWQ,22,22,3,q9u1iSvcylVZ58C7_wasSA

Oh the lovely cause! My sister, father, and I chose NOVE as our dinner of choice on the last day of restaurant week. I must say. I was quite impressed.

For the first course we all chose the MAIN LOBSTER BRODO: It was a Lobster Tortellini, creme fraiche, and chives. The creme fraiche had a very nice and strong flavor to it. It was tart and tasted a lot like a lobster bisque. The tortellini was awesome! They give you two light pieces that look like a steamed dumpling. It was very light and refreshing. The pasta was not heavy and it really dissolved in your mouth.

Second course I had the FENNEL APPLE SALAD and my dad had the PETITE FARMERS MARKET GREENS. My first time having fennel and although it will probably be the way eat way to experience fennel I just learned that this salad is not my favorite. The fennel had that strong liquorish taste and I'm not too fond of liquorish. With the apple and the light dressing it really toned the taste down, but it created a dry texture. I liked the Farmers Market Salad more. It was classic with spring mixes and goat cheese. I would just remove the beets.

Main course I had the AIRLINE CHICKEN BREAST. The chicken was very tender but it really just tastes like BBQ chicken to me. I actually enjoyed my dad's salmon. It had that nice lemony taste, tender, and the roasted almond's smoke taste made for a great addition to the dish! This is all way before my dad decided to drown the salmon with Tabasco sauce.

For dessert we had a CHOCOLATE GANACHE ON TOAST. It was actually pretty delicious! A nice rich chocolate spread with season sea salt I top made a great combination of that saltiness and sweetness. 

Also, big thumbs up to Chef Geno and the crew for giving us window seating and a complimentary dessert sampler. If you're looking for a nice upscale chic place to dine I would surely recommend this place. They offer a great happy hour menu that is only served at the bar, and the food is surely just as good as the interior decor.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,4,2,4,I91eCkk2s1DzS7r3r8J2og

First course was pine nut arugula salad - this was my favorite dish of the night. I am a sucker for a good salad and I love pine nuts. Perfectly dressed. Accompanied by bread and fresh parmigiano cheese and a glass of chilled prosecco. 
Second course was rigatoni. It was good, the sauce was so-so but the meat was seasoned well.
Third course I got the salmon, and my bf got the steak. The salmon was cooked perfectly, but was dressed in a vegetable ragu and I don't really go for hiding the great salmon flavor in a stew of veggies. I wished it was naked with veggies on the side. The flank steak, however was absolutely amazing - perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor.
Finally, the cheesecake. The best I've ever had and I don't even like cheesecake. The most crave-able dish of the night.
The Groupon did come with ""espresso cocktails"" but we did not receive any with the cheesecake. We asked about it and the bartender put bailey's over ice. Nice accommodation,  but less than we expected.

""Nove: the number or figure 9."" - Google

Seeing ""IX"" emblazoned across door handles & walls, I came to the conclusion that Nove must mean 9 in Italian.

Clearly, NI wasn't located on the 9th floor (it is located on the 51st floor of the Palms Hotel & Casino), so I was confused as to why the number 9 was so important??

The view is breathtaking at night as Nove is about the same height as the High Roller.

After my curiosity got the best of me, I broke down & asked our hostess what the importance of the number 9 meant.

She told me that N9NE Steakhouse (which I had been to but is now closed) & Nove were originally owned by two men who decided to go into business together. They were best friends who met at the age of 9!! Ahhhhhh. Now I understand.

Note: N9NE Steakhouse used to be located on the Palms Casino floor level.

----

The BF & I were wicked late for our reservations but thankfully our friends had already checked in & were waiting for us.

We took a quick photo of the night skyline & sat down to order.

After a few minutes... and then a few more due to my inability to pick a meal... we ordered the following:

Beef Carpaccio. (3 stars).

Vibrant red!!

That's about all I could see in this dimly lit restaurant.

The beef was sliced very thin & presented beautifully. There was a healthy portion of capers, arugula, & parmigiano reggiano.

Charred Octopus. (2.5 stars).

The octopus was grilled nicely & the meat was tender, but I didn't taste very much of the citrus emulsion & the fris√©e just seemed like it was there as a garnish??

The cucumber cubes were cut perfectly bite sized & were refreshing, but I didn't really understand how that tied into this dish either...

It's probably just me not knowing enough about how this dish is supposed to be enjoyed...

Veal Nove. (2 stars).

I heart veal & I try to order it when I see it on the menu as it isn't as common a protein as pork or beef is.

Sadly, this dish wasn't quite as good as I was hoping for.

The butter demi-glac√© sauce bordered on sour &  inedible to me!

Thankfully the arugula was seasoned heavily with olive oil, salt, & pepper which made the fresh arugula the star of my pasta dish.

The arugula was the only item I truly enjoyed as I continued eating the rest of my dinner...

My veal wasn't tender which was disappointing.

It took me 5 tries with a steak knife just to get one piece of veal into my mouth.

The prosciutto was nice & salty which also enhanced the flavors of this dish & helped me power through the torturous demi-glac√© sauce.

I do wish the menu had said this dish would be made with demi-glac√© sauce... I wouldn't have ordered it!! I already know I don't like demi-glac√© sauce.

I decided not to make a scene & take away from the wonderful company & ambiance so I just held my breath while I ate.

There were only a few other people at Nove so I'm thinking they need the profits more than ever??!!

Since I was craving pasta & the Veal Nove does not come with pasta, I asked for a side of pasta with an olive oil, garlic, & anchovy sauce.

The pasta was cooked al dente but there were no bold flavors. I was expecting a pungent garlic & anchovy sauce that would bring an intense fishy & salty flavor I adore...

The pasta just tasted like a bunch olive oil & a few specks of garlic were added to the pan at the last minute. Definitely NOT a memorable dish for me.

Tortiglioni. (3.5 stars).

I told the BF to order this since it sounded right up his alley.

Good thing he did because we both enjoyed this pasta dish the best.

The sausage was hearty & flavorful with a slight spicy kick to it. The tomato cream sauce was light & the pasta was cooked al dente.

We both agreed, if we ever came back to Nove, this would be the dish we would order again!

Customer service was great. Nove's staff were attentive & friendly, from the hostess to our server.

Luckily for me, there weren't too many patrons there so my attire was ""acceptable"" to dine here. I just had on a camouflage long sleeve shirt & jeans with a baseball cap.

Truth is, the last time I was at Nove about 3 years ago, I swear it was tastier but then again my palate has expanded so maybe my memory is playing tricks on me.

The complimentary bread basket was very tasty. The olive tapenade was delicious!!! I'm not a balsamic vinegar person at all, but the BF said that sauce was tasty.

We started with a caviar bellini and a champagne toast - Yay Vegas!  Both were fantastic.  Appetizers were abundant and tasty.  I've never had Rice Balls before and was surprised how yummy they were.  Deep fried rice balls with marinara sauce for dipping - oh yeah.  The Calamari was fresh and light.  The Crudo (salmon ceviche) was amazing.  I thought it had a spicy kick but 2 others said they didn't taste a kick, but loved it.  The Sausage Pizza looked delicious and was served on a pizza stone, but I'm sticking to my vegetarian diet so I didn't try it.  The last item was Crostacei a seafood selection on ice of crab legs, oysters, lobster, clams and shrimp - all delicate and delicious.

Next came the caesar salad (without anchovies) and it was perfect.  I chose the Ahi Tuna rare for my entree.  The Eggplant Caponata the Ahi sat on was just OK.  But the Death By Potatoes on the side was fantastic.  The Crispy Garlic Potatoes were too crispy for my end of the table.  

During dinner we enjoyed a Pinot from Willamette Valley in Oregon and a Rothschild.  Both were perfect.  After dinner they served great Espresso's and even made mine decaf.

We skipped out before dessert to go upstairs to the Playboy Club.  The staff at Nove were fantastic and knowledgeable.  Cesar, our main server, made sure we never wanted for anything.  It was a great night.",LCZSBQCIss8Aw3AXcdFSow,3,2,5,fp0zw_krDVwVzxopTZDKJA
3791537,2011-05-10,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"My experience at Nove was so drastically, drastically different (read: shittier than) the 4 and 5 star reviews on here I was momentarily flummoxed until I realized one thing - for the most part, the negative reviews were from people who took part in ""deals"" offered by Nove. Ladies Night, TravelZoo, etc, apparently its all code for ""eat shit food and pay for it"". And when I say pay for it, I mean on multiple levels.

I'm too irritated to give an overly detailed review, but here's the hit list:

Waiting to be seated for a reservation we were already (apologetically) late for, slow service, a booth tucked into the otherwise empty corner of an extremely low ceilinged overhang that meant we could see nothing of the famous Nove view of Vegas (and this in a half empty restaurant) and felt like we were quarantined from the rest of the guests, cold extremely oversalted food, empty water glasses (I think they were pissed we asked for tap after they only offered us Fiji or San Pellegrino, like tap water doesn't even exist in such an upscale establishment), club music during dinner, improperly paced and delivered courses, unprofessional wait staff.

I really think it boils down to management and staff assuming that people who come in courtesy of these ""deals"" are lesser guests, lesser citizens, and are given less hospitality. To be sat in a corner of an otherwise empty section of a restaurant when there were numerous tables with views and actual other diners nearby which sat empty before, during and after our meal is horrible. 

I also think that they are doing the food for these ""deals"" in mass quantities, and it is being pre-cooked and help improperly. Fried items were cold, tough and limp, the chicken parmigiana reminded me of a low quality frozen dinner in texture and taste, and I'm still dehydrated from the over dose of salt that was present in every course, right down to the salted chocolate ganache for dessert. But the worst, absolutely WORST, was the salmon. We left the entire entree untouched.

Maybe the regular menu is great. Maybe. But I'll never know because if this is how Nove chooses to treat guests who partake of the tasting menus they themselves advertise (which, by the way, should be used as a chance to showcase the restaurant and garner repeat business) poorly. I will never, ever return.",cB1pgndvG47P8XkeDa-7PQ,8,0,1,B7XzF_M3mLGoUyUMDlx95w

This Sunday night, the restaurant was very quiet.  For a half hour, I was the only customer in the place.  Then a couple came and was seated at the table next to me.

After ordering iced tea and placing my dinner order, the server brought me a bread basket and a small side dish with two compartments--one with olive tapenade and the other with a balsamic and olive oil mixture.  I'm not a fan of balsamic.  I'll try to remember just to get olive oil in the future.

I started with charred octopus.  It was charred correctly and it was tender.  Following this, my main course was tortiglioni with spicy sausage, peas, and tomato cream sauce.  The sausage had good spiciness to it and with the tomato cream sauce, the dish was a winner.  For dessert, I got the amaretto mousse cake after learning that there wasn't a lot of amaretto and it was baked in.  The cake consists of amaretto mousse, almond chocolate cake, cocoa, and amaretto Anglaise.  There was very little amaretto flavor but the chocolate was rich.

Service was good.  Iced tea refilled without asking.  My only suggestion here is to check the glass when you refill.  Pouring iced tea into a glass in which all the ice had melted calls for a fresh glass or a separate glass with fresh ice.

I coordinated through Kelly Maxwell for special/ group events and she did such a good job meeting our needs & requests. We had an AWESOME view of the Las Vegas strip which was kinda trippy cuz you see Vegas but while you're in the restaurant you feel like you're in a Venetian Garden in Italy. I guess that's why they call it the Garden Room. The room also has gold framed mirrors that are TVs for a/v purposes. Perfect for a slideshow! (FYI- if you book a group dinner of 12 or more you & your guests get free admission to Ghostbar but get there early!) 
Okay, first thing's first. The food was ON POINT.  I'd say for a huge group we did it right by ordering our food family style and got all of the chef's best. (That guy, Chef Marlon, surely knows his craft and treats his guests like family. He came out to see our group periodically through the night and he even carried the celebrant's birthday cake out and sang happy birthday to him. I mean, who does that?!? That's what you call amazing service and passion for what you do. I mean you could taste the love in his food lol. So.. We HAD to get a picture with him! His picture is all over the strip and even on screens in cabs, how could you not?!)
So, for appetizers we ordered beef carpaccio, prosciutto Di Parma, shrimp francaise & federal hill calamari with complementary nana's meatballs. All was delish. Calamari was best I ever had! 
As for the entrees --the guest of honor had a surf n' turf (lobster tail, filet mignon, death by potatoes and asparagus) all to himself but I got to try it. It tasted just as good as it looked! The rest of us had the veal Milanese , NY steak, sliced capunti bolognese, grilled asparagus and death by potatoes (OMG... unforgettable!). It was a gastronomic experience! Our palettes were full of various but complementing flavors. We were so full by this point it's a good thing they were shared plates. But that's how you know the food is good cuz u just keep eating even though ur full! To top it off, the dessert was also a hit. The birthday boy got a Tiramisu cake and we all had cannolis with lemon mascarpone. I'm full just thinking of all the food we had!

I had been to this restaurant back in 2010 and remembered the juicy and delicious steak that was prepared back then. I decided it would be the perfect place to host my friend's 21st birthday!

We had made reservations for my friend in the beginning of March. I had made a reservation online, noting it was my friend's birthday. When we were running a tad late (Vegas does that to you), we called to inform the front desk we were running about an hour behind. The friendliest hostess answered the phone and let us know it wouldn't be a problem at all.

When we arrived, they sat our party of 4 near the window where we were greeted with the best view. As my memory escapes me, I cannot recall our server's name. However, from the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were treated like royalty. Between our waters never emptying, our drinks constantly flowing and our table looking impeccable at all times, It was as though we had 3 servers tending to us alone! The manager, Marques, was checked on us a few times. He was kind, friendly, and showed us a wonderful evening! Not crowding us, but eventually joining us in our party as the evening carried on. Marques made sure that we continued our wonderful evening by providing us with tickets to Ghostbar for free entry. Eventually, the chef came to greet us as well!

Between us, we had the chicken marsala, the filet, a caeser salad, and the chicken parmigiana. We shared this and the extra sides they brought to us. Every morsel was savory, tender, and delicious. The Chef not only treated us to several specialty appetizers but a wonderful birthday dessert in a large martini glass-on the house! 

As a special birthday gift, the bar also treated us to 4 espresso shots. Unfortunately, I am allergic to coffee beans (weirdest and most unfortunate allergy ever). When we casually mentioned it to the server (since there was an untouched shot at the table) they quickly remedied the problem-despite it being a gift!

From the great food to the amazing service and friendly staff, this dining experience MADE our trip to Vegas. Thank you, Nove Italiano!",7ntob4q2uNiOWmGtUvezRg,3,4,5,b_SAz_QtRWhQnC5SXkmZ7w

The ambiance was certainly beautiful.  Low lighting and leather everywhere that made all of the lights visible on the strip that much more glorious.  The food, however, was not that glorious.

We got an antipasto platter to start with several meat and cheese options, as well as some olives and nuts.  Overall, it was a pretty good portion for such a fancy restaurant and delicious.  My boyfriend got the filet mignon and it was absolutely delicious.  I got the spaghetti of the night, which included tuna, capers, olives in a red sauce.  I was simply not impressed.  If you're going to claim to be an Italian restaurant, you should probably have good pasta.  Not really the case here.  We also ordered the ""Death by Potatoes"" or something as a side.  It was so heavy that my boyfriend (who typically really enjoys heavy food) couldn't even eat it.  It was greasy and overwhelming and completely didn't go with their Italian theme.  I kind of couldn't understand it.

We were sat in the terrace because my friends were visiting from Ireland and England. Being this was their first time in Vegas they felt they were  treated like royalty. The terrace had by far the greatest view of the strip. Followed by a warm greeting from the Executive sous, Roger Francios and very kind server. 

Course 1: I have never had Octopus before,  I must say chef cooked the octopus to a tender bite. I was completely satisfied ( ""tasted like chicken"" ) chef's words! followed by butternut squash ravioli, veal and salmon entrees, and a caprese salad.... FOOD WAS AMAZING!!!! Our server paired our courses with excellent wine choices and finished with my favorite.. Prosecco! 

To end the night we were greeted by Executive Chef Marlon after asking to give our respects. usually the chef doesn't make time to touch table if to busy, Chef was kind enough to take time to touch our table and we were  much appreciative. 

Course 3:  We had the make your own cannolis for desert. so creative and so yummy! I strongly believe the level of service in this restaurant far exceeded my expectations! I commend the entire team for doing such an excellent job! We will return if ever in Vegas again.

4063190,2007-10-23,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"i was underwhelmed. i guess this is one of the scene-y places to eat in vegas. they create the exclusivity allure by positioning a bunch of 14 year olds in corsets in the lobby of the palms to escort you to a special elevator that takes you up to the restaurant. then you are greeted by 16 year olds in corsets who tell you sweetly that they are running about 20 min late so you can drink in the bar till your table is ready. where teh 18 year olds will serveyou alcohol and roll their eyes when you ask them why there is a pizza martini on their menu. 

it definitely was a scene, my dress was about a 11 inches too long for this place. but i ordered a glass of champagne and decided to go with it. but then my bubbly arrived and it was horribly, disgustingly sweet. when i told the 18 year old waitress this she just looked at me and said, ""it's supposed to be sweet, it's a moscato"". (eye roll)

now listen honey, i am from SF. i've been to wine country like 40 million times. and when you only have 2 champagnes by the glass on your menu and one is $40 a glass henriot and the only other option is $11 you don't make that $11 option a horrible moscato. at least roll with prosecco. yes, i realize a moscato is supossed to be sweet, but this just tasted like it was about $5.99 a bottle sweet. there's a difference.  

anyway, after waiting the extra 20 min after our reservation time we were seated. service from there was pretty good. but the food was just ok. i had linguine with clams, the meal i would choose if it were my last meal on earth. i asked for it with white wine sauce. it came out in a pool of butter. seriously. i get that the rest of america is grossly overweight and that these people love vegas, but come on. i could only eat about a quarter of it. the husband's chicken marsala was quite good, if a bit salty, and our friend's halibut was cooked well but covered with a pretty mediocre tomato sauce. 

i don't even know if telling you to go elsewhere would help cause most of the food in vegas seemed a bit overrated and overpriced. 

on another note--the decor in here was just not working for me. some elements were very cool, but overall it was a disjointed design attempt. otstentacious and even a little tacky. but then, it's vegas. so i guess what the hell.",xIi1whPhlngewfOSTv_PMQ,0,0,3,hbY4E5nJ2dzMrrZcIvJPxA

Nove was the perfect way to fete my bachelorette friend this past weekend.  Although most places in Vegas won't let you do a ""Bachelorette"" group dinner unless you have 12 people, Nove accommodated our 11 women and made the dining experience truly special.  50-something floors up from the desert, the first thing that strikes you about Nove is its fantastic view.  Second, the service was extremely friendly and solicitous.  Nove also has a private room, with doors that block the rest of the restaurant's noise, for large groups.  It was a perfectly intimate way to spend Saturday night's dinner with the girls.  We got to choose from the entire menu-- the polenta and rock shrimp contorno/side dish was amazing-- so we could all choose what we liked: appetizers, pastas (they'll serve them in full or half portions and a half is easily generous enough for one person's entree), mains, steaks, and side dishes.  The arugula and beet salad with Humboldt Fog cheese was delicious, as were the ""Sunday dinner"" pasta with sausage, and the gnocchi was how gnocchi is supposed to taste.  It was perfectly formed little pillows of potatoey goodness swimming in tangy tomato sauce.  The wine list was pricey, which I guess fits the theme of Vegas + steak, but we found some good choices with a red Italian blend and a Gavi.

4145422,2007-04-25,4,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"When you walk up to the host stand you can be escorted to Nove, Moon nightclub, or the Playboy Club.  Our weensy corseted hostess asked if us ladies would be interested in attending the Playboy Club that evening.  I don't know if we look like the type of ladies that might (I was with a vendor), or if she asks everyone that.  I have no idea how she could see into my soul so clearly in any case.  
We take the elevator up to meet the rest of our party.  Hang on, the corset outfit is the uniform here.  Good lord, it must look like a showgirl dressing room in the employee lounge --- these girls clearly have to lace each other up once they arrive.  There is no way they are bending or reaching or activating turn signals or buckling seatbelts, or breathing for that matter, in those corsets on the journey from home to work.
I ordered a mandarin vodka and soda from our buxom cocktail waitress and it was yummy.  They do something to it.  It was syrupy sweet.  I don't know what they add (dare I guess simple syrup?), but it was unlike any other mandarin vodka and soda I've had.  In a good way though, it disappeared very quickly.
We were seated at a great, large table in the uh, ""topiary room"" we'll call it (see photo).  Huge windows overlooking the strip, with gas fireplaces on the ledges --- very swank.
Our server Josh was AMAZING.  He and his sidekick server Chris were very attentive and helpful, and clearly know the food and wines they're serving.  Josh even brought out a couple of things for us to try just because we had talked about them.  Truffle risotto?  I think the puddle of drool on my placemat alerted him to the fact that I might enjoy it.  He was right.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.
First and foremost.  The bread.  I like bread.  I usually eat too much before my meal comes out.  Nove serves these little rosemary crispy breadstick things with a little bowl of olive oil, a little bowl of parmesan, and some red pepper flakes.  I may have eaten every single one on the table.  Which may have been enough to build a new house for one of The Three Little Pigs.  Instead, it just made this little piggie very happy.
We kicked it off with a bunch of sashimi (at an Italian joint?  Yes, with olive oil and basil and salt and stuff) which was pretty darn good, and sliced really nice and thin.  Sticking with seafood we had the cannoli --- tuna tartare and crab versions.  Nummy.  I also ordered the arancini to share, and I thought they were great.  I wouldn't have complained about having a little more sauce though.  We shared the grilled asparagus as well as the aforementioned truffle risotto, and I had the beef carpaccio pizza as my main, which I was far too full to touch really.  That and the fact that it was covered in capers and aioli, which I wasn't prepared for and not too crazy about.  The crust was great, and the pizza very good, but I don't really do mayo on my pizza.
For dessert I was so excited to see balsamico strawberries, but they were pretty disappointing.  However, there was a chocolate sampler platter that was out of this world.
I think it's incredibly overpriced for what it is, but the decor and service definitely step it up a notch.",2bHSZhM0huV8LRh3YHaOSQ,5,7,4,D-ludQQLwlOT6y-AAdbGdQ

Lastly, I'm not a big fan of chicken parmesiano and I was pretty full by the time it came, so I only had a few bites. Dessert was flavored shaved ice, raspberry and orange, that was pretty refreshing.

What I liked the most was that they served ice cold Fiji bottled water instead of the typical tap water with a slice of lemon.

The food - well, here ill have to divide it to before desserts and after desserts. We first got the beet salad appetizer and the egg yolk ravioli. Both were great. Then we got the pesto Ravioli with the tomato sauce, it was just ok. We got a side of saut√©ed mushrooms which were just eh.
And then we got to the desserts part... We got the cheesecake which was AWESOME, they accidentally brought us the chocolate ganache which was debatable, but the cannoli! Omg! It's a must ;)

4336498,2007-03-28,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"Very disappointing.

I'd never been to the Palms before this past weekend.  It's a loud hotel-casino, and the NOVE restaurant was deafeningly loud as well.  Surely, that adds to the ambience if it's the type of loud, party scene characteristic of the Palms, but it makes dinner conversation difficult at the least.  I certainly wouldn't go here for an intimate dinner.

The decor, however, was dark, modern, trendy and we liked it.  And the views of Vegas were fantastic.

We couldn't decide whether the service was excellent or horrible, and that's not a good dilemma.  On the one hand, the waiter changed our table from upstairs to downstairs when we asked.  (Upstairs was deserted when we were escorted to our table around 7:30 p.m., too early, I suppose).  The wait staff was also attentive and responsive.

The problem was all the blunders made throughout the evening.

First, one friend is allergic to shellfish, and, despite her explicit request that a particular dish not be served with shellfish, it arrived with shellfish.  Next, it took forever for her dish to be replaced.  Granted, the waiter offered her an extra dish of pasta and an extra appetizer while she waited, but the wait was still exceedingly long.  The rest of us were finished with our entrees by the time her dish arrived.  The waiter also made good by giving us two deserts on the house, but the damage was done by then.

Second, another friend SAT ON GUM on his seat.  The waiter explained that the gum couldn't have been on the seat, because they clean the booths after each set of diners; therefore, he concluded it must have fallen from . . . the bottom of the table.  Yuck!

Third, we asked the waiter about a particular wine, and the waiter gave us a completely incorrect description of it.  When we later asked the sommelier, the sommelier flatly contradicted the waiter's description, describing the wine correctly.  But this means, meanwhile, we were stuck with an expensive bottle of wine that didn't suit.

The food itself was good, but the mistakes were distractions throughout the evening from which the meal could not recover.",n2jRO-sA97c6vFrSvoN8fg,3,0,3,CsFlBFprEw-QFQpapAWAmA
4361163,2017-11-18,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"I am being generous with a three star review as I was very disappointed with service at Nove. As a resident of Vegas and having been to other upscale restaurants in many of the casinos I was surprised at the bad experience. 

Last night was dinner for my mom's 73rd birthday and we had tickets for an 8 pm show at the Pearl . 
I got a coupon for $25 off $75 for last night only and made a 6:45 reservation so we could go after o got off work and still have time to enjoy a full service meal before the show . I arrived at NOVE at 6:22 ( I checked the time because I knew we were early and hoped maybe we could be seated early.  

We were checked in and told we could wait in the bar and they would come and get us . I waited until 7:05 before approaching the desk as we had not been seated yet or even told that they were running late .. we were told we were next .. at 7:10 we were seated .  A waiter came to take our drink orders and told us since we had a show to get too , pasta was out best choice as it would be fastest. We chose to skip appetizers , go for pasta dishes and skip desserts as by the time we ordered and got our food it was 7:45 , so we ate quickly and I asked for the check when the food arrived so I could eat and run. We just made our show on time. 

What I had planned as a treat to my mom turned out to be a quick meal, with pasta that was ok, but not impressive enough to make me go out of my way to go there again . 

On a Friday night with a show and a coupon going out to ticket holders , they should not make reservations they can't accommodate ! 

Two sangrias and two pasta dishes came to exactly $75 so I will not argue with the price after coupon , but I won't be going back. I had better service last time I was at the Palms for a show at the social table bar and the food was good but it appears to be closed for renovations now .",dJ5_Wu2CNRu1kbXlGyg1Lw,0,0,3,KwnrwLoVNAye0wMoCKeG9A

The first high is the private elevator you take to get up to this place which has a great view of Las Vegas.  We had a great waiter who was very enthusiastic about his recommendations and generally was very helpful though at times he was nowhere to be found.  There's a serious cocktail and wine program we started the meal with some good cocktails.

We had several appetizers, some of which were very, very good.  The shrimp francaise is billed on the menu as the best shrimp franchise you've ever eaten.  Since I've never had shrimp francaise, I would have to say that they were correct.  Seriously though, it was very, very good.  These were huge shrimp coated in egg-batter (francaise-style) and served with a creamy lemon sauce.  Simply divine.  The other appetizers were generally good but not to the rarified level of the shrimp.  The bruschetta, grilled octopus, fried calamari and prosciutto with burrata were all fine but not memorable.

My pasta starter was the gnocchi with parmesan cream and crispy pancetta.  This was delicious.  The gnocchi were perfectly chewy and the sauce was agreeably salty, smoky and funky.  Excellent.  The panzanella salad was not really a panzanella - typically a panzanella salad highlights grilled or toasted bread which soak up a dressing enhanced with the juices of fresh tomatoes.  This salad was a green salad with a few croutons.  It's false advertising.

Our entrees fell short of the mark.  I had the veal chop milanese - this was a special of the night.  This was a bone-in veal chop that is pounded very thin, breaded in breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese, and fried.  It is an impressive piece of meat, pounded so thin so as to be larger than the large serving platter it was served on, but taste-wise it was just a deep fried piece of meat.  No capers, no sauce, nothing greens.  It was really a weak dish and I regretted getting it immensely.  The baked penne entree was more worthy of Stouffer's than an upscale Las Vegas restaurant.  Shameful, actually.  The filet mignon was properly prepared but the aged balsamico that accompanied it seemed too sour and made the dish very unbalanced.

After the debacle of the entrees, we did not stay for dessert.  Alas, other than the best shrimp francaise I've ever eaten and a few tasty gnocchi, this was a disappointing experience.",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,4,0,2,mxZH9DSVlLHTpn9UK2Vhrg

The decor is simply breath taking. The view from the fifty-first floor and the huge chandlers. I loved it all. 

The food was really good, but not the best I have ever had. Honestly there is little Italian place in Cabo that is way better and half the price. 
I did not try any of their speciality drinks or wine, I hear the prices are a little expensive for what you get. 
The price for the food is pretty reasonable if you are not a big eater. 
I went with my girlfriend we shared a pizza and each got half orders of pasta. We had leftovers and our bill was under sixty bucks, not too bad for Vegas. 
The key to this place is ordering the half orders. Our bill could have easily been over a hundred had we not done so. Plus the proportions are seriously HUGE!

Now to the bad part of the night, our waiter and bus boy were seriously awful! So much so I was tempted to leave without tipping. 
The server was almost impossible to find. We were given flat water when we ordered sparkling, not a huge deal but its not like the place was packed. 
At the end of dinner the waiter gave me a horrible look when I asked to do a room charge. As if it was going to be so much extra work for him. 
The staff, besides the hostess, could use a huge attitude adjustment.

I dont plan on going back here again.",iqqMlAAnBRD5XeZPpIOnog,0,0,3,G5aAYApG8wI1HU9Gx78GOQ

We had the oysters, yellowtail, veal, filet mignon, risotto with beef cheeks. The chef sent us a couple additional dishes including a really nice albacore sashimi, a side of broccolini, crostinis with various toppings and some sort of alcohol-infused strawberries - delicious and handfed by one of the servers, no less! The risotto was a bit on the salty side but overall, we were happy with our meal and extremely pleased with the service.

Heard some people on the way out (including the elevator guy) raving about the Shrimp Francaise which is described on the menu only as ""The Best You Ever Had."" I wanna come back and try it!

The view, however, is the star of the show - inside *and* out. The city looks amazing from here at night, and the restaurant itself is very cool. Love the lighting and colors, especially the wine room in the back.",_Ve-CCUdZuUz0KPEqIfqvg,1,1,4,C97h4nf8NPLctrs5cO4zKw

There was a delicious array of food and plenty of it!   A starter, salad, pizza, meatball, shrimp, a choice of main course, and finally cheesecake for dessert.  I great deal for $55 and it even includes unlimited white and red wine, both of which were delicious.

The restaurant has an excellent view, about 50 stories above the strip in the Palms Fantasy Tower.  We found the service to be excellent!  Our servers were Jerry and Luis.  Even the manager, Jessica and the Chef Geno stopped by our table to ask about our experience.

The bread service is good--cheese bread, crispy parmesan sticks, and rosemary focaccia.  My husband had the chicken marsala (bone-in double breast) with a good amount of mushrooms.  He liked it.  I tried it and thought it was dry.  I had the osso bucco cannelloni which had amazing flavor and was a large portion.  The cannelloni pasta was very good.  However, there was a lot of osso bucco fat which had a discernible texture from the meat and I had to periodically spit it out (I know gross--but I have a thing for not eating chunks of fat--I just can't do it).

I came here to celebrate my Aunt's birthday with my family. The restaurant is located on the 51st floor of the Palms Hotel. It was a total adventure getting up there since we were escorted though a dimly lit corridor to access the elevator...felt very VIP-ish, lol. 

Once we've reach the restaurant, we were immediately amazed by the ambiance and the stunning views of the Las Vegas Strip. It's the perfect photo op location (if you're into taking selfies or group selfies, just sayin', lol!)

The food here was amazing! We ordered from the Happy Hour menu (which happens all night long at the bar and lounge and everything on the menu is $9.) Some of my favorites from here were the Arancini Balls, Baked Eggplant Caprese, Crab and Lemon Bruschetta, and the Fried Artichokes. 

What stole my heart was the Bread Pudding. It is probably the best Bread Pudding I've ever had! It wasn't dry and crusty like some bread puddings I've previously had. This was moist and had the right amount of sweetness to it. It was soaked in a butter caramel sauce. One taste of it would have you orgasm multiple times (Yes, it was that damn good!) If you come here, I highly recommend ordering this for dessert. It will definitely give you an experience you will never forget! 

The Tiramisu was also good. Very light and airy. Deep flavors of coffee and cream. Not too sweet and it goes great with a Chocolate Martini!

I wanted to find a place to take my team out for a nice dinner.  I asked a friend of mine (Ahron Bragg, Exec VIP Manager at N9NE) where he would take a group of co-workers for a nice dinner.  He recommended Nove.

We walked up to the reception desk down on the 1st floor of the Fantasy tower at the Palms where we are warmly greeted and shown the way to the elevator that took us up to the 51st floor.  Once the doors opened we were again, warmly greeted and taken to our table.

The view was stunning.  The interior and design of this place is unbelievable (Great job Michael Morton, even though you aren't a part of N9NE any longer).  The General Manager came over to personally say ""hello"" and introduce himself along with our wait staff.  I thought it was an amazing touch that the General Manager of the restaurant takes the time to make these introductions to each and every table.  It's the little things, ya know!

The menu was very interesting.  Instead of your traditional Italian pasta style, they had an amazing blend of dishes.  All unique and very interesting.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The table ordered several of the starters such as;  Shrimp Francaise (AMAZING), the Raviolo (Superb), the Bone Marrow (A must try) and Prosciutto di Parma (OUTSTANDING).  All of which were unbelievably prepared.

I was so full from the appetizers I only had room for the BRODO ZUPPE.  It was also amazing.  Everyone ordered items off the menu from Steak to Pasta and all said it was wonderful.  

I also saw that the bar area was quite active as well.  It looked to be a great place to start the evening off right.

Calamari- for a dish that is pretty stock in restaurants, it's usually not something worth writing about since it is the same wherever you go. Nove's was excellent though! The seasonings and batter made the dish exceptional!

For my entree, I had the chicken marsala. It was very lightly breaded, which, combined with the rich marsala sauce and mushrooms, was a very balanced combination.

For dessert my friend and I shared the chocolate ganache, paired with banana bread tequila. YUM!! Of course the ganache was rich with a thick texture, but paired with the tequila was freakin' amazing. 

On top of all this, we had two extra dishes brought out, compliments of the chef. Amazing views, great service, and most importantly, authentic Italian that's a perfect fit in a place like Vegas.

This place clearly is thriving due to a phenomenal chef, Marlon Simbulan, who we were told is from Rome. I ordered their signature seafood pasta and was given an option to order from a spice level of ""3 to 11,"" per our server. I chose a ""10"" and OMG the chef brought the heat! As a lover of spicy, I was thrilled with the intense heat level of the dish that was still balanced with other flavors.

One of the most delightful dishes I've eaten in a long time and probably the best pasta dish of all time. 10/10

Also had the lobster bisque which is composed of a 'lobster salad' vs lump meat, but which was very good. 8.5/10

Cannoli dessert with assortment of garnishes was a great way to end the meal.

My friend and I flew from LA to celebrate his birthday there. At first we were excited, made our reservation at 7PM, yesterday, Tuesday night. We were the only couple there, seated on the dining area and the rest of a huge crowd were at the bar. Our waiter (tattooed guy) came immediately and took our order. He suggested to try their ""tasting special"" a five-course meal for $89 dollars per person. I told him that I only it seafood. But he insisted that he'd tell the chef and will make some sort of arrangement to make it work. Fine. I agreed.

The view on the 51st floor was great, but it was impeded by the noise of workers who were hauling stack of chairs and waiters delivering ice buckets to another room, going back and forth, passing by in the middle of the dining area. You would not find this site in any restaurant that claims fine dining experience. I am sure Olive Garden will not do this to their costumer!

At this time, my friend had to ask the waiter to remind him again for the 3rd time, that he likes his water to have no ice, and for the 3rd time, the waiter apologised. Obviously he was not paying attention. Then came the huge and loud crowd from the bar, were placed to sit in from of us. I thought, why would they put us, one couple, next to this crowd! There were plenty
of seats in the dinning area and not to mention that we were the only couple there! Then our food came, I had exactly the same food selection with meat and all as my friend. I asked the waiter back and apologised again and will exchange my food to something else. He came back with only cheese ravioli and took the meat items on the plate with no substitution! The ravioli was horrible, the edges of the pasta were dry and the sauce was watery. 

My partner and I were beginning to feel irritated by the experience so far, so we had to ask to be seated to another area far away from the crowd seated next to us. You would have expected that they (waiters) would be more careful by now. But no, my friend had to ask again for the 4th time, that his water had to have no ice! Were seated there for another 15 minutes and our next set food has not arrived yet.  At this time, we realised that we were experiencing bad service in all aspect of supposed to be a ""fine dining."" A close to $500.00 dollar meal is not worth it!!!! So we decided to leave and asked for the manager. He came after 13 minutes, and clearly was apologetic and frustrated. He tried to win as back but our evening was ruined already! He told us that he takes pride of his work and that he run a tight ship. Ahhh, NO, our experience would not have happened without someone minding their customers with care!!! He really did try to win us back but I told him that the only thing he could save our special night is for us to pay the portion of our meal and for us to leave immediately. He comp our meal and we off to another restaurant to save the evening.

A major disappointment for us!

We started with the grilled octopus.  It was phenomenal.  It had some sort of spicy sauce to it that gave it some kick.  Freaking good.  And the portion was pretty large.

Within in our party we ordered the Barramundi, the lamb chops, and the veal.  The veal was so tender and melted in your mouth.  Same with the lamb.  It was amazing.  The Barramundi was served whole (which I was aware), however I am accustomed to having the bones taken out before it is served or at the table, and that did not happen.  So though the flavor was so delicate and wonderful, it sucked having to eat around the bones. 

The sides we ordered were the gnuddi and the mashed potatos.  And my best friend and I split the panzanella salad.The salad was so wonderful.  The big pieces of pancetta made the salad. The gnuddi were so melt-in-your-mouth that words would never do it justice.  And yes, the mashed potatoes were silky and creamy.   We had leftovers...

4738620,2016-07-10,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"I happened to find this amazing restaurant through the help of yelp and I was more than amazed by the overall fine dining experience. I decided to surprise my boyfriend here for our two year anniversary. Despite being a Vegas native, I have never been to the Palms Casino and  thought it was best to make a reservation to Nove Italiano beforehand. This entire process was quick and easy, and they were able to take my request noting that it was my anniversary as well. Once we arrived there, we were welcomed by a hostess which she then directs you to take an elevator. Eerie vibe at first, since the hallway is quite secluded from the rest of the casino. The restaurant is located on the 51st floor of the casino. After reaching the actual restaurant, you are then greeted by another hostess. She led us to our table next to the window and pulled the chair out for both of us. The first thing I noticed was the lovely view that they had overlooking the Strip. Since our reservation was at 8 pm, the lights of the Strip was absolutely breathtaking! After we were seated, we were introduced to our server, Ernest. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us go over the majority of the dishes which I gladly appreciated... since most of the items were in Italian and only had a mere description in English on the ingredients used for that particular dish. Also, another thing to note I would highly recommend asking for the server's recommendations. This will save you lots of time, especially if you have not been to a similar fine dining Italian restaurant, like myself. We had the calamari, walnut tomato pesto ravioli, and rigatoni alla vodka with chicken. The food itself was enjoyable and fulfilling. They also give you complimentary bread to go along with your food. It was now time for dessert. I mentioned to the server about a check in offer for a free dessert (bread pudding) and we ended up ordering the strawberry carpaccio as well, thinking that the bread pudding was not going to make us full. To my surprise, the presentation of the dessert was so cute! They had candles on top and happy anniversary written on the plate with a chocolate syrup/sauce. The bread pudding was to die for!!! It was amazing. By the time we were almost finished with the bread pudding, I was already so stuffed. Still couldn't believe that we had another plate left of dessert. The strawberry carpaccio was average, I strongly believe it was because I was already full and had no more room to actually savor the taste of the carpaccio. But between the two desserts, the bread pudding is the winner here (one of the server's favorites). After we were all done with our food, Ernest offered to take some pictures of my boyfriend and I, which I thought was very sweet of him to do. He took us to a room which had a fireplace and an amazing view of the strip. 

I would call Nove Italiano a hidden gem of the Strip. The views were spectacular, the overall atmosphere was classy, and the service was top notch. I would highly recommend for those wanting to spend some extra cash on one amazing dining experience.

We arrived early and was seated in the bar area until the rest of our guests arrived . We were given a happy hour menu. But then the rest of our friends arrived so we went to our table. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, I asked if I was able to eat from the HH menu. Our server said he had to double check and then he came back and gave it the ok. The filet sliders were awesome . I enjoyed the apps. The place has a chill vibe, low lighting for an intimate experience. 


We sang happy bday got some dessert and then the bill came. I was charged full price for my HH apps. I spoke with the server and he told me that "" when he asked his mgr if I could order off the  menu that since I wasn't in the bar it would be full price. He then grabs the mgr. I speak with the mgr and he says the same thing. Like basically they were doing me this magical service by letting me order bar food at the table. He explained to me that I didn't specify to my sever and ask if it was half off. I explained that the whole point of ordering off the Bar menu was to get the happy hour price! So it would have been redundant to ask for the discount as well if  I placed my order before the 7:30pm time limit. If that was the case I would have just ordered something off the regular menu at regular price and avoided that whole fiasco. Initially the mgr didn't want to take it off, but  I (and two other guests) had to explain it to him before he decided to take it off. It was really disappointing because the place was pretty cool. 


So after this experience would I return? Honestly it's up in the air at this point. I give them kudos for the view , but price wise as a Las Vegas local their a plenty of Italian places to choose from off the strip that have great ratings without the ""view"" . I believe in giving a review in all fairness of the entire experience and not just one bad kink. So I still say 3 stars.",EzjLARgz3Jmb4L1t3lBy1A,3,0,3,-OeFC8kHEeaqVvw8h_8mxA

The Kobe steak tartare with truffles was amazing, especially with a glass of Champagne. 
The octopus salad was one of the best octopus dish I ever had ( and I ate at several Mario Battali's restaurants before ).
We shared 2 entrees. The housemade tortollenis were cooked perfectly and were very savory. The Ahi tuna was also cooked to perfection..
I am still dreaming about our dessert. A nuttella cake... wow...
Service was impeccable and the ambiance just delightful.

If you want a great view of the strip come here and request a seat by the glass. Fun fact: It is located on the 51st floor of the Palms resort so that is where the view comes into play.

My girlfriends came here on a Saturday evening for dinner at 8 pm and were greeted by not only the manager but the lovely host. The second we got off the elevator they just wow'ed us. So sweet and caring. 

We got sat right away. As we walked to our table I noticed it was not crowded by any means....a little on the ""empty"" side which I do not understand how but I thought that might be a plus for me as I was starving. 

We were taken care of Beatrice and she was awesome! By checking in on yelp you get a free appetizer. However the complimentary bread they serve is so delicious and unique (a mix of sweet cinnamon sugar - garlic - and cheese)

For entree's I did a ""custom"" dish - which they gladly made for me. I did the potato gnocchi with grilled chicken. The white creamy sauce and pancetta was to die for. I also thought the portion sizes were great! Now for the dessert... we had a surprise from the kitchen. It was a mixture of chocolates and each one had a unique filling. Long story short - We had tons of leftovers.

While we were here I was able to meet Marquees the manager who came to our table and was such a charmer. He made our experience so much better! 

The entire staff was so friendly and was always checking in on us and offering us help. I can not say enough good things about the service.

NOVE is a pricey place (we are not middle-aged white men and therefore don't hemorrhage money), and half-off brings the cost down to nearly acceptable.
We started with a round of drinks at a little table near the bar. I had a Pimp's Cup, which is some gin, mint, and nonsense concoction that usually costs $18* (* = insane). It was OK, but it was no Twisted Brit from the Chandelier Bar at Cosmopolitan (also known as the best, freshest-tasting drink ever).
Once we sat down, service was polite and lacking in pretension. Our waiter even hit me with a ""that's what she said,"" which was refreshing. Annoying point #1: Water is offered as either bottled or sparkling. No tap water option. Any dum-dum who's been in town an hour knows that means ""extra charge that will anger you later.""
I had a caesar salad with fresh anchovies that was fresh and fantastic. I wish I had paid more attention to what everyone else got so I could describe other dishes, but I'm selfish.
For the main, I had veal osso bucco with saffron risotto. It looked pretty, if slightly barbaric. The meat completely fell apart in soft chunks at the mere suggestion of my fork's approach (that was the worst sentence I've ever written) and it tasted really very good. The saffron risotto was especially good.
When all was said and done, I was 65% happy with NOVE, 20% irritated at the totally unnecessary volume of the totally unnecessary music blaring in the dining room, and 15% peeved at the still-too-high prices.

The service was great though, especially when I asked them to bring out a dessert for my friend to celebrate her graduation- they brought out a nice plate of cookies for the table to share at no extra cost.

Before buying the deal online, I followed the instructions of the deal and made a reservation online to make sure there was availability for the night/time we wanted.  My friends just happened to call the restaurant about something that Friday and they were told they didn't have record of the reservation.  I called them b/c I had printed out the confirmation of the reservation like I was prompted to do.  The girl I spoke to simply told me they didn't have record of it because their online reservation system doesn't work that well.  She acted like that was a good excuse and completely understandable.  When someone books an online reservation and gets a confirmation, it is fair to believe that they will have a reservation.  She offered us a really early time slot (6 p.m.) with no apologies and said that was all she could do.  I was willing to do that but then I was told that the deal we bought couldn't be honored at all that weekend because they had already booked all the deals for those nights.  Since I was only in town for the weekend, I figured they would be flexible due to the fact that the issue resulted from their online reservation system not working.  Nope...nothing.  When I asked to speak to a manager, I was transferred and waited for almost 2 minutes of ringing before I hung up.  I decided to call back and got another girl.  When I mentioned that I was waiting to speak to a manager, she told me they wouldn't be in for at least 3 hours.  That made me even more upset because the girl transferred me knowing full well that no one would be there to help me.  I then explained the situation, left my name/number and asked for a manager to call when they did get it.  The result...NOTHING.  I'm sure this restaurant has good food but when it comes to service, it stinks.  They need to take a lesson in customer service.  An experience this can sour a person on a place forever and that's just what it did with me and I won't be shy to tell others.

5083847,2012-01-03,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"My best friend and I were in town over the weekend to see John Legend's concert at the Palms.  Since we knew that New Year's Eve was going to be utter chaos, we decided to make a reservation at a restaurant at the Palms to make sure that we had a great night and didn't miss any of our plans.

I made a reservation for Nove on December 6th.  The next day, December 7th, I received a call confirming my reservation for two people on December 31st at 6:30 p.m.  I thought that it was a little weird to call the day after I made the reservation and not closer to when we would be at the restaurant, but I figured since it was a big and busy holiday, they might be doing things differently.  I never received another call from the restaurant.

My friend and I showed up for our reservation at 6:30 and were informed by the hostess downstairs that they not only did not have any reservation under my name, but had no record of me in the reservation system.  Funny since I had made the reservation directly through the Palms website.  She apologized but said that this problem happened often and they would do the best to fit us in.

Once we got off the elevator upstairs, the hostess upstairs took us to a table on the second floor.  On the way, we noticed that a good percentage of the restaurant was empty.  The hostess showed us to a high top table (where we had to perch on barstool like chairs -- not easy for two girls dressed up in fancy dresses and heels).  I asked if we could sit at any of the regular tables and was told no.

The manager then came over and introduced himself.  I told him about what happened and even showed him the confirmation email for my reservation, which I had on my phone.  He acted like I was making it up that I had ever made a reservation and refused to move us anywhere else but finally said that he would comp us a glass of champagne each and promised to check up on us and to later give us his business card.

Well he did comp us a glass of champagne, but that's all he did.  He never came and checked up on us and we never saw him again throughout the evening.

The food was very mediocre.  We split several dishes, including the Nove Spaghetti.  Nothing stood out as being amazing, and both of us were pretty dissatisfied with the meal.  In fact, we didn't even finish our dishes despite the high cost.  The only things that were great about the meal were the view and our waiter (I think his name was Michael).  He literally could not have done anything better and made a very mediocre meal seem ok.

Will I come back?  Absolutely not.  The manager's attitude left a really bad taste in my mouth and the food was no where near good enough to make up for the numerous mistakes throughout the night.

The ONLY reason this restaurant isn't getting one star is the amazing waiter we had and the view.  Definitely avoid this restaurant -- there are way better places to dine in Vegas where you don't have to deal with lost reservations and attitude problems by the employees.",eZPsoFhCMPzAlpFXq2XmUg,1,0,2,OTyWjOJgNgfwRNuf_OujVA

4. The dinner that night was a preset coursed meal. Everything from start to finish was absolutely fantastic. The shrimp with white wine in the first course had me so excited at what was to come.

We had been at the restaurant for at least 40 minutes before we finally had a drink.   When we needed new drinks, it took another 15+ minutes and they were not delivered near the same time even if they were ordered together.   
  I wanted to order their seafood special, but by the time we got to ordering I wasn't sure if the kitchen was as awful as the rest of the staff and went with the veggie lasagna to prepare myself for minimal food poisoning.  The food was actually REALLY great! The restaurant was at 10% capacity and the service was inexcusable at that price point.",JQlzHruOqwMuueStY_9_DA,2,0,1,5PJmIeUnWF_k1zkLtYZHJA

There was nothing special about the food if you factor in the price and it seems this place markets itself as a very high end Italian restaurant.  My group was staying at the Palms Casino hotel so we wanted to have dinner at least one night up in the towers.  The Palms is undergoing renovations which is why I also think the hotel and restaurants were generally pretty dead inside which also was a bit of a drawback.  The view from this place is spectacular so based on that alone I couldnt give lower than a 3 star review.

Started with an anchoviless Caesar salad with fresh Parmesan. I don't have any feedback, positive or negative... it is what it is.

Bread, jams, cheeses and dry cured meats are incredible. I play with combinations, and that worked out more than it didn't.

Great service from host to chef. Food arrived on time and at a good temperature. 

Wait staff functions well as a group, can't recall how many servers we had. Only positives.

Lobster bisque was nice. Chilled (I think) lump lobster, bisque poured at table... delicious.

I get the Branzino every single time I'm here, so this time I switched it up and got the veal Milanese, breaded and panfried, which was still on the bone. Had such a comfortable flavor to it. 

Even better was the sandwich the next day, jeez, that sandwich. 5 stars in itself.

Was kinda in a grumpy mood when I arrived, but left happy.

The best by far however was the risotto. Cooked perfectly with insane flavor. It took awhile to get our appetizers so our waiter comped us a slice of Nove's house made cheesecake. Very creamy and not too rich. Prefect way to end the meal.

For appetizers we had the grilled octopi - amazing flavor and texture because they were baby octopi. Both of us got the Nove Spaghetti and it did not disappoint at all. It was a mix of regular spaghetti and squid-ink spaghetti with numerous types of seafood. So good and amazingly portioned. Price? $42 a plate. Ouch.

The drinks were VERY expensive ($16 for a mojito), and so we only got 1.  Had they been cheaper we would probably have indulged in at least 2, so that's something to think about.

As he was telling us about the choices that came along with the Groupon, we were served with a nice chilled glass of Prosseco. We all gave him our choices and he said the food would be right out. Boy was he right. 

The Appetizer we all chose was the Federal Hill Calamari. Do not miss out on this if you go here. This has to be hands down the best calamari I have ever had. It was so good and spicy, full of peppercinis. It did not even need sauce.

Our salads were next and we all chose the Caesar's Salad. It was delicious and I actually would have enjoyed another if I could have gotten my hands on one.

We all ordered the same entree which was the Rigatoni Bolognese. Holy smokes, the bowl that came out was a huge portion. Everyone at the table enjoyed it so much. I just kept stuffing my face not wanting to waste any part of it. Probably one of the best I have tasted. 

The dessert was 3 scoops of gelato ( chocolate, caramel, and vanilla) with 2 little cookies on the side. Oh my was this gelato good. We were licking the bowls.

We also had a really great wine that was recommended to go along with dinner. I can't wait to return to this beautiful restaurant and try other things from the menu. But what a great deal getting these Groupons. They did not skimp on anything.

The one requirement is that everyone at the table participates in the deal. With a party of three or four, everyone could dine family style. Between the three of us; we got two different appetizers, two second courses, two entrees, and cheesecake for dessert. The gulf shrimp franchaise is one of the best dishes offered that night. The large shrimp are butterflied, lightly battered, and fried before being tosses in a rich lemon sauce. I was using the complimentary bread to sop up the excess sauce. The margherita pizza should be passed upon. It is a disappointment in comparison to the shrimp. Both second course items are delicious. The salad is light and refreshing. The lightly toss the greens in a vinaigrette. The meatballs are just that, but they are good. We were already full by entree time. How we were going to put away the chicken alfredo, rigatoni bolognese, and truffle salmon was beyond me. I had a few bites of each. The tomato sauces are Nove's strong point.

Good
1) Server was very nice
2) View is spectacular
3) Food was pretty good [no steakhouse n9ne good but good enough]--Rao's, Bootleggers, Panevineo would be another choice of mine
3) They give you bread and some chefs tastings prior to your meal. Calamari salad was amazing A+ I'd only go back for that.  They brought over salmon on spoons none of us eat that and something else we didn't like so it escapes my memory. I got a chopped salad to start w/ all kinds of things in it, that was very good. My aunt got a pizza [she's 75 and easy] and her friend got a chicken and pasta dish that was covered in mushrooms which I don't eat. She seemed to like that.  Food was good, not great, but good.

Bads
1) got to the hostess downstairs, asked her how busy it was did we need a reservation, etc. She said 'nope' you can go right up now. You have to take an elevator up [meh] got to the hostess stand upstairs and that's when things started going horribly wrong.  She said it would be a bit of time. I'm thinking like 5 mins max [mind you downstairs girl was like go right up seemed easy]  We sat down by the bar. we waited, we waited some more.  Other people came in sat down. waited some more. 20 mins later I went back up to the hostess stand and basically ripped her a new one. We were immediately sat.

2) Restaurant was ubber busy guess there was a convention in town or something. They kept putting the fat people on the ends of the tables and they were spilling into the walkways so navigating out and/or to the restroom was difficult. Had to have our waiter help me ask some people to get up [while they were eating their meals -cringe] so we could get by them. wasn't a big fan of that.

3) Long wait for table and a longer wait for food. Took about 2 hours for us to eat here, luckily we didn't have anywhere to go.  I actually got so annoyed I just handed the waiter my credit card w/out even looking at the bill so we could get out of there.



As you can see my bads are more verbose, I'd maybe try it again, if I happened to be at that hotel; however I would not make a reservation and travel to this hotel just for this place.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,4,1,2,gMMYTd6IZOrfWrKfoNDQ7g

We got some sort of shrimp salad appetizer (the artichoke hearts in it were DELICIOUS) and the shrimp was flavorful and cooked well, in addition we got some of their rendition of fries which were reminiscent of the ones my mom makes from scratch at home but, mom still does it better. The sauce was kind of weird and too cold of a contrast in my opinion. The chef also sent out a small plate of two different kind of crostini type appetizers, the bean one was interesting but salty and the sweeter of the pair was sumptuous. I had a pomegranate type martini off the specialty menu and was thoroughly buzzing after that.. well balanced flavor and a nice texture. We also were spoiled with a complementary spicy shot (Can't recall the name but went down so smooth and had a nice tingle after from the marinated 5 pepper tequila.. ask to see the ones they're marinating, so cool!!) and we enjoyed an espresso martini which was beyond delicious! Marcus is an amazing bartender/server and knows his craft!! Totally coming back to Nove Italiano.. hopefully Adrienne Maloof is there next time ;)",s09qPuyhuL9ycAaygGcdTw,0,0,5,9R-h9nxOS8ar4Osy3L_4Qw

In the beginning we had a rough start as our first waiter didnt try to accomodate my friend who is Vegan and instead insisted in options that she couldnt eat. The night was going downhill fast, I was at the point of wanting to leave and going to another restaurant because of our horrible experience with the waiter. We requested to speak to a manager which is when we spoke to Marques who is the GM and Marlon who is the executive chef. They absolutely saved the night for my friends and I. They displayed the best customer service I have ever received. Marques & Marlon not only rectified the situation but also accomodated my friend's Vegan habits by creating amazing dishes she can also enjoy. They both constantly visited our table to make sure we were having a pleasant experience. I loved the fact that they also gave us an amazing waiter Sladjan who absolutely delightful and hilarious! You cannot beat a beautiful restaurant with jaw dropping views of the strip, delicious classic dishes, and the best of all impeccable customer service.  I  can honestly say that I will recommend Nove to all my family/friends who visit Las Vegas. This will now become my go to Italian restaurant whenever im in town. I know this review is epically long but I had to describe my experience since it started off badly but it ended up perfect. I am so happy that my friends and I gave Nove a second chance and Marques, Marlon & Sladjan  were the reason why we all left with smiles on our faces. To any Vegetarians/Vegans reading this yelp you also can enjoy an amazing meal just make sure you speak to your waiter and Chef Marlon will whip you up something delicious! Thank you so much for everything your staff did to ensure that my friends and I had a positive experience we appreciate it immensely.",7ze-u5hFAnS7SDytLY5pqw,1,1,5,UwivDTb6Ihx-o3RRjxouDw

A shooter of vodka and something else
Mozzarella Di Bufala, Tomato, Basil Pizza
Caesar Salad
Bruschetta
Rigatoni Bolognese
Various Desserts

I was starving by the time we got to dinner at 8:30PM, so all the appetizers tasted delicious to me.  The Caesar Salad may have been my favorite because their dressing was perfectly creamy and not watery, with the right amount of anchovy and garlic flavor.  But, that's not to say that the pizza and bruschetta weren't tasty, because they were!

The Rigatoni was pretty bland.  We didn't have any sort of salt or pepper on the table, and since I was so hungry, I just ate it as is.

Anyone who knows me knows that my favorite part of ANY meal is dessert.  I was definitely looking forward to what we were going to get.  Maybe it was going to be tiramisu or possibly gelato.  Instead, we got one plate to share with 10 girls.  On it were a few chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate one bites of cake, and different flavored macarons.

Before I could even really pick anything, most of the desserts were gone.  I had one bite of the chocolate covered strawberry and gave it to my friend.

All in all, service was pretty good considering the number of girls in our party.",osSzFkfeMP417i9Qb4rmEw,0,0,3,5uw0SgltZJ9m-snoG5HL3A

It's certainly a 5 star experience if you combine the great view of the strip, service, atmosphere and the walk up to Moon and the Playboy Club afterwards.

I've been able to sample a few of the dishes here and have enjoyed all of them.  The standout appetizers would be the baby octopus, raviolo and calamari.  I had the Sunday Gravy pasta the last time which included braciole, sausage, meatballs and pork gravy.  Heart attack on a plate!  It felt so wrong yet sooooo right.  The Nove spaghetti, pansotti (short ribs, brown butter, hazelnuts, spinach) and veal Nove were also very memorable from past visits.  The dessert menu is decent if you actually have room for it.

5551402,2016-06-18,0,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"While doing searches on a restaurant for a fancy dinner out in Vegas, Nove came up on the list and what attracted my attention was a combination of the prices (decent and within my range), reviews (all praise), location (top floor of the Palms, overlooking the Strip), and the menu (Italian with several vegetarian options, as well as choices I knew my partner would be interested in). I booked a reservation for two and we had to take a cab as the Palms Resort is off the main roads, but it didn't take long to get there. We got directions from the concierge and were able to hop the elevator to 51st floor and be treated to a scene of the setting sun over the strip, the mountains and the desert. Oh yes, that is so worth it.

Our reservation was relatively early so the restaurant wasn't busy at all and we had a lot of attention from the waitstaff. We were seated quickly and someone came over to discuss the wine options with us as we went over the various menu choices we were likely going to go with. We chose our wines and also ordered what sounded like an insanely rich and amazing appetizer called Gnudi (ricotta cheese with brown butter and sage). We were also served small bits of bread that were very tasty but we tried to limit so we'd have room for our main course.

Not long after finishing off the delicious appetizer, our main dishes came out: the walnut tomato pesto ravioli for me and tortellini with truffles and large thin slices of pancetta on top. Both dishes were melt-in-your-mouth *delicious* (I snuck bits of the tortellini out from underneath the pancetta to try it out). Rich, intense, this was some of the best Italian I've eaten in a long time. On top of that, the servings were generous and I had a hard time finishing what was in my plate. This wasn't four pieces of ravioli with a bit of sauce on top, it was a full size serving that would leave you feeling full even without an appetizer. Despite the allure of the dessert menu, we skipped over the sweets as we were way too full of pasta and cheese and wine.

Due to the size of the servings, we also felt like the price was fair as well. It's a pretty decent high end restaurant so the prices are up there, but the quality and serving sizes more than make up for it. The service was also top-of-the-line and our waiter was funny and smart and extremely helpful. He was on top of making sure our water glasses were topped off and making sure our needs were met. We were more than happy to leave a generous tip on top of our bill.

Out of the various restaurants I've gone to in Vegas, Nove is definitely at the top of the list for one of the best experiences I've had in the past 10 years. I would recommend it to anyone if you're looking for a good Italian experience with a beautiful view of the city.",kk2oFTBSU9C2XshIVU7tXQ,4,1,5,nnid3jkDm6wf8SA61U-sFQ

2) Busboys were helpful except that we had to fill out glasses with bottled water we brought with us

I did find it really amusing that when checking in at the host station on the casino floor, that they asked me if I had a players card. I said I did, and wondered if she needed it - she said ""no, but we have to provide a count at the end of the night"" - seriously? Anyways, up to the 51st floor and the hostesses up there greeted us quickly and sat us for our 5:45pm reservation on a Saturday night. I was sad to see the chef station in the dining room be demoted to a dish dumping area for the bus staff.

Drink orders were taken, followed by food. Don't be fooled when they try to tell you to buy a bottle of still or sparking water, you can get normal ice water too. We opted for the Shrimp Francaise, because it really is the best you ever had. Well, maybe a few years ago; the shrimp was very chewy, the sauce was mostly lemon juice and very sparingly dressed - very unfortunate. We used to sop up whatever sauce was left using the bread, but apparently they didn't want to bring any to us - most of the tables got it, but maybe we didn't order enough to deserve it? 

About an hour later, our entrees finally arrived. The major disappointment was to find the steak that I ordered rare, was cooked med/med-well. Maybe if they didn't spend an hour cooking it, that it would have been done correctly - unfortunately, we weren't able to wait another hour for the steak to be recooked. The sauted broccoli was good, but was lukewarm at best. My significant other ordered his steak medium rare, but it was cooked rare - but he seemed to enjoy it better that way. 

Once the adjacent table finished complaining about their entrees arriving cold also (demanding to speak to a manager), the server came over and asked us how the food was. I showed her the steak and she apologized and walked off. She came back to the adjacent table with their bill in her hand and said that the manager took their entrees off, then came to us and said that the manager removed the overcooked steak. She said that due to all of their reservations being at 6pm that ""the kitchen was overwhelmed"" - I'm not sure why she said the restaurant was fully booked since it was maybe half full the entire time we were there. For what it's worth, the manager never did come over to the other table; pretty rude if you ask me. 

Thoroughly disappointed, and now running short on time, we paid and left. I don't know if this was a one off incident (which I'll assume not, based off similar reviews recently), if it's the fallout from Geno's departure, or if the Fertitta brothers are trying to make a few extra bucks by cutting costs, but I'm sad to say that what was once a sparkling gem in Vegas, is now less enjoyable than a trip to Olive Garden. Sadly a view of the strip doesn't make up for poor management and lackluster food.",MQ7BoAs7XWXeuJPmiMa0aw,4,0,1,X3Tsx_vm-FzdCGXoFHwEeA

After being directed to an exclusive elevator up to the 51st floor, we were greeted by a gorgeous view of a Palms tower and the Vegas city lights. It was absolutely breathtaking!

We started out with cocktails. I ordered a peach bellini that turned out to be more Prosecco than anything else (but that's okay because I love Prosecco). The table bread was a trio of Italian with cheese, crispy breadsticks reminiscent of fried wonton strips, and the star of the platter - fresh foccacia. For our appetizer, we decided to share the grilled octopus. That was delicious - beautifully charred without being burnt, well-seasoned, and on top of it all, the dish consisted of whole baby octopi (as opposed to slices and dices of larger octopi).

I had been wanting to try the Nove Spaghetti since we made our reservation two weeks ago, and it turned out we both ordered the same entree. It certainly did not disappoint! I was surprised to discover that the pasta was a mix of regular spaghetti and squid ink spaghetti, both freshly made. The tomato sauce was pleasantly seafood-y and they were generous with the shrimp, scallop, lobster, and squid. The shrimp was perfectly cooked (one of my biggest food pet peeves is overcooked shrimp) and the scallop was wonderfully soft and firm at the same time. Loved it!

Even though we were feeling pretty full, we ordered the Nutella Tower for dessert. The presentation was impressive, but the semi-freddo was just too sweet for us.

Our server Slegar (I think) was really funny and nice. The manager stopped by at one point to see how everything was going. Most restaurants like this like to draw everything out and give you lots of time in between courses. For me personally, I find this to be annoying, but I get it. 

I would for sure go back, but only if it were for a special occasion. Everyone really enjoyed their food, we had a great view, and the service was good.",ZuWAof5l6yKeft-F1QCWSQ,3,1,5,NlW0BT1s6gHSrzJGmpmtrw

I do not regret it though as we all ended up sharing and everyone loved every single dish. We started with grilled octopus which was so tender and flavorful, and a charcuterie tray with delicious meats, cheeses and fruits. Each entree ordered was cooked to perfection and I was so happy we got to share as I loved my clients short ribs! I am usually a seafood girl, but now all I can think of is beef.

5827037,2010-10-07,1,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"The party never seems to end in Vegas does it? 

The thought of hitting brunch ""party style"" after a long night of clubbing had me cringing at the thought of hearing more bass pumped into my ears. Nove offers up an interesting concept of pairing buffet with a celebratory, club-like atmosphere, a DJ pumping tunes you probably heard the night before, cute waitresses & dancers in sexy outfits and call it their ""High Society Day Club"". 

On Sunday drag yourself out of bed to the 51st floor of the Palms Hotel. From 1pm-4pm and for $30, help yourself to a fantastic spread of Italian brunch treats from frittatas, charcuterie, cold seafood with fantastic cocktail sauce, hot breakfast items, paninis, flat bread pizza, pastas, summer salads, ceviche, and delectable dessert bites, while trying to re energize from the previous night's debauchery. The food is extremely fresh and changed quite often to ensure nothing is sitting out for too long. 

Cocktail prices ($15) are typical of those along the Strip but these are not the water downed cocktails you ordered at the club the night before. Each one intriguing in its own way, creatively executed yet potent to provide you with a refreshing tonic to continue your party streak. 

Now if only this concept were brought over to New York.. perhaps our city can recapture its crown for being the ""City That Never Sleeps"". It's no wonder Las Vegas owns the title especially when offering places like Nove to keep the party going.

5838048,2012-04-04,4,D_mVIUu5XyrHz-7U_z_pDg,"It was Restaurant Week, and after tasting an inventive pasta dish that had a lasting impression on me, and meeting Chef de Cucina Geno Bernardo, at Dish 2011, I was at last dining in the flesh at Nove with Diane.  As soon as I left the elevator at the top of the Palms Playboy Tower, and saw the sleek furniture and breathtaking view of the Las Vegas valley from the wall to ceiling glass panes, I instantly knew that I liked this place.  Hard driving music with a nice modern vibe added to the upscale ambiance.  After various bread products, olive oil, salt, red spice, and requested butter were set before us, we were surprised by a generous assortment of amuse bouche prepared by Chef Bernardo.  Some vegetables and pesto were spread on toast tips, and two cute bent silver spoons had been loaded with heaping spoonfuls of a textured concoction that tasted like smashed pea beans and was cool to the tongue.    

A platter of Salumi with savory housemade salami, ham, and great Ricotta Cheese was next, along with very tender Federal Hill Calamari (both rings and tentacles) enhanced by a very lemony Lemon Aioli made per our request.  Ravioli Risotto Bianco with pine nuts and fresh pesto was excellent, and so was a hot and meaty Ragu Bolognese with Rigatoni.

Likable Chicken Parmiggiano--more tomatoey than cheesy--harbored a nice surprise: eggplant framing the dish around the edges.  Veal Scaloppini was fine, thinly pounded veal.  A rich side of Death by Potatoes with Marscarpone and Parmesan Cheese tasted like mashed potatoes with pancetta.  It was hot and very cheesy.

For dessert, I enjoyed a great luscious Marscarpone Cheesecake with Raspberry Sauce, and Diane savored a very good homemade Tiramisu.  

In the midst of our meal, an interesting diversion occurred.  The entire men's basketball team for St. Mary's College strode in and filed past me, to take their seats at a very long dining table overlooking the valley far below, for a scheduled team dinner.  They were in town for the Mountain West Conference's Basketball Championships held at the Thomas & Mack Center.

Nove was very accommodating in both the front of the house and in the kitchen.  Our table was held for us after we were stuck behind a car wreck and a two-lane closure on I-15, and arrived 27 minutes after Diane reported the problem via cell phone.  And, besides specially preparing an aioli for us, the kitchen staff kept peppers out of the calamari, and removed chives from Death by Potatoes, also at our request.  Other than having to ask for Iced Tea twice before a glass of the tan beverage arrived, service was excellent.  Even Iced Tea refills came out flying for the duration of our meal, without request.

Two unusual events occurred when I paid the bill.  I dropped down a ""You've Been Yelped!"" card with my cash payment, and the server picked it up, examined the card, and asked quizzically, ""What is this?""  I explained that I was going to review the restaurant on Yelp.com, and in fact had already decided that I was going to award five stars out of five.  He then asked if we wanted to meet the chef.  Since Diane had never before met Chef Bernardo, I said, ""Yes, if he is available.  But I have already decided to award the restaurant the highest rating.""  I wanted to be clear that my review was already decided based on my dining experience and could not be influenced.  

Our server told me to wait a minute while he checked, and a few moments later returned and directed Diane and me to follow him.  He led us right into the kitchen.  As soon as the doors closed, about ten smiling white-clad chefs and assistants facing us started clapping and catcalling to acknowledge our presence and give us a friendly greeting.  Then Chef Bernardo came over, and we shook hands.  As the kitchen staff went back to turning out a long procession of orders, Diane and I were given a full tour of the kitchen and even admitted to a refrigerated room.  Before we left we saw a door signed by Hollywood and Las Vegas celebrities.    

But we were not through with surprises!  As soon as we left the kitchen, I was asked, ""How would you like to see the Playboy Club?""  As a key holder in the late '60s, I said, ""Sure!"" and after a comp pass was filled out and handed to me, Diane and I were escorted to a private escalator that led to the Playboy Club one floor up.  There we had another nice view of the city, stayed for a short while amid cottontailed Playboy Bunnies and other patrons, and then descended the tower via elevator and soon returned to normal life.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,7,5,-jWwLTapghJh2A76j-f2lQ

The room was pretty cool, but unfortunately the waiter was a bit out there and not very attentive. That said, the food on our pre-planned menu was mediocre. We had some meat and cheese plates,.then pasta dishes, and then steaks. It was far too much food for us, especially since we were heading upstairs to Moon right afterwords, and unfortunately none of it was that good. The steak, a ribeye, which I ordered medium to medium well, came out rare with cheese on top. Parmesan I think. Interesting, but really doesn't say much for your meat if you're seasoning it with cheese. The pasta dishes were also average.

I ordered the Ravioli with Pine nuts for some reason although there were items on the menu that looked way better. The Ravioli was good, and had a great flavor.  Everyone else at the table thought their food was amazing - ranging from ribs, to octopus, to filets.
