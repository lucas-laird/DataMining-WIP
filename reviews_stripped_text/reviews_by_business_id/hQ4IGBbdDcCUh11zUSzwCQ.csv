I look over the menu and order the brisket and rib platter, to find out they were out of everything except pulled pork - including potatoes and even ice. But I understand that sometimes BBQ places run out of meat - you can't simply make more of something that takes 12+ hours to cook if you had a busier than expected day. The cashier and cook were friendly and I ordered my sandwich.

It was supposed to be slow-smoked, but it tasted like... nothing - as if a pork butt was boiled for hours in plain water then pulled. There wasn't even any bark or spices to give any kind of flavor. It seemed like it was cooked too long so the texture was getting a little mushy. The BBQ sauce was good but nothing special. They used a high quality bun and had pretty good beer prices. It wasn't terrible, it just tasted like bbq sauce on a bun. I finished it and then went somewhere else as I was still hungry without a side option.

I don't know if they just had an off day, but the meal I had definitely wasn't worth going back for.  I hope they figure it out because it's a great location with a lot of potential and friendly staff.",C77p8jrn8tXkX5MMBUskLg,0,0,2,-j5yn4-4RUmn2XrklS1rug

488175,2014-02-22,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"I've eaten a lot of bbq to separate the good and the worst and Big Erns is definitely in the bottom of the list. 
Before i do the cons I'll tell you the pros on my visit. 
I just enjoyed the Brisket.. 
Cons...
First and foremost, let's review the ribs... they were not moist and very chewy. There was only 4 pcs and I gave up on the 3rd one. A BBQ joint should always have good ribs.
Second the pulled pork. That pork was so dry and chewy also; even L&L hawaiian bbq does a better job at it even at late hours!. The sauce is not evenly spread out. 
A BBQ joint should have a good sauce and yes the sauce was good considering they only had one flavor that's comparable to the ones I buy at albertsons. 
Next I had the pork and beans...i don't know why the people next to me was saying it's good when it clearly taste like the ones I use to buy at walmart. No special taste there. To be honest I use to buy it as dog food. 
Also did the Potato salad....that was horrible even my kid pointed out it was bad. I also had him try the cup of water telling him it's refreshing. He's reaction?? x[ like that. lol and last the dinner roll. Smh.. 

For the price I'd recommend going to Famous Daves. They have a variety of sauces and the quality is always consistent.  I don't know if I went to Big Erns late but 5 pm there was still lots of people so there shouldn't be an excuse to serve it like that. 
Also people should not always believe on over hyped places. Don't believe it till you try it cause most often it mind f***s u and u start to believe it's good. Believe in your taste buds ;)",IxJahxdx5wYpkQrTjc8dLQ,0,1,1,zSWFf_TgkLSetyTI_IZIZA

571112,2014-01-02,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"I love this place! The food is flavor-able without being too salty. The sides are homemade which makes them tasty, not like store-bought or out of a can and heated. The meats are smoked daily.
It's interesting how many people do not understand the difference between wet and dry bbq. Barbecue preference is largely dictated by whether you like saucy or seasoned meat  Dry barbecue is smoked, while the wet variety is usually cooked in a fire pit. 
As they say, the secret is in the sauce. Or the rub. And Big Ern uses both which are also homemade. Rubs are typically worked into the meat the night before it's cooked so that the salt can penetrate the cut and tenderize it. But rubs do more than flavor and soften the meat; they also enhance its texture by caramelizing and forming a crispy crust when cooked. Because of the rub's ability to penetrate the meat, fatty cuts like brisket respond well to this type of seasoning. Memphis BBQ is typically a dry barbecue with sauce on the side; in Kansas City and North Carolina, people like their barbecue wet with even more sauce on the side. 

The service is great, and I have been lucky to sit inside on all my visits, because of the temperatures, but, I am sure that the heaters would be turned on, if needed.

The price to some may be steep, however, go to any fast food restaurant and up-size that meal, and see what you'll pay for heart-attack in a box.
I only have one negative remark and it's to Lonely D who reviewed on 12/23, I understand that the holidays may be lonely for some, but one who is unemployed, was a 3 meat combo really necessary, if you couldn't really afford it?

Ok, another remark to Lonely D. Sorry. French fries, really? i just googled Southern BBQ side dishes and the most common sides are available at Big Ern's. Only one out of 10 sites even listed ""oven-fried"" fries, as a side dish. So I guess, the next time you want to take a ""suicidal"" trip, try McDonald's, i hear they have a form of ""rib"" sandwich (now this is not meant for human consumption).

The Brisket was Ok but I was kind of disappointed. Nothing worth going out of the way for in my opinion but than again, I've had Brisket from world class TX BBQ joints where Brisket is done right and is the crack of BBQ. (When I'm visiting relatives in TX, I'm pretty much ordering it up every other day... LOL.)

The brisket served to me was medium well done, no smoke ring, little to no rub, very lean and dry. It was tender but it just didn't have much flavor to to it. Highly doubt it's being smoked over Hickory. Not sure if it is the quality of the brisket they are using or if they are taking short cuts. Probably a combination of both from what I could tell. (Wholesale, a good quality brisket is going for only about $3 a lb so if you are going to turn around and sell it for $17 a lb, than don't take short cuts preparing it.)

Luckily the spicy BBQ sauce they have there is awesome and gave it some flavor. (Spicy BBQ sauce made this 3 stars instead of 2.) I normally use little to no BBQ sauce for Brisket done right but going through a container was pretty much mandatory for this Brisket.

Mac-n-Cheese -- Pretty good. Had better, had much worse.

Roll? Stale / Old and completely unacceptable to be served. The rolls I bought a couple of weeks ago sitting in my pantry that I'm saving for the ducks are in better shape.

First, I go over the menu. They have combos (1, 2 or 3 meat choices) two sides and a roll. Priced fairly alright, but was hoping for more food for that price.

The food was out in less than 5. My gf and I shared a 3 meat combo. Ordered double order chicken and ribs and Mac and cheese since they had no fries!! One pbr and one bud light and paid $22.

Was expecting whole pieces of chicken instead I was eating shredded chicken. It was dry! BBQ sauce was good at least so I  poured it on the chicken. My ribs...well it was 3 pieces and had absolutely NO MEAT on them, and was chewy. I was licking the bone for some sort of substance but no luck. 

The Mac and cheese. I'm not sure that they even put ANY cheese in there to make it but the butter ....boy did they use butter. It's obviously been sitting in their hot food trays all day long. Scooped into a small paper bowl at the bottom was a whole lot of butter!!!! Yuck. I want to see cheese, not oil.

Roll was dry but at that point the whole meal was dissapointing.

However, the food was just OK. The sides, in particular, were terrible. The macaroni was dried out with grease or oil settling at the bottom. It certainly wasn't fresh. What a shame because I love macaroni with melting and stringy cheese. You won't find that there. Also, the potato salad, another one of my favorite sides, was definitely from a jar or a box. It had that preservative, vinegary kind of taste. I took one bite and didn't eat the rest. The brisket, which I usually get when I go for BBQ, was OK and fairly juicy. It was just as small portion, though, and they could probably do more to trim off the fat. The worst thing was that it was very pricey--$9 something for two sides and meat. No way worth it, mainly because of the lack of quality. Get it together Ern!!",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,0,0,2,l6pKI_ZA6QhqNRDk6VRrxw

1136611,2015-03-15,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"After seeing Big Erns being chosen Best of Las Vegas, the wife and I decided to give it a try.  We got there shortly after opening figuring the food would be at it's freshest.  My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I had the chopped brisket sandwich.  We both had a bag a chips as our side, wanting to keep it simple, and a sweet iced tea.  

I'll start off with the sides, way over priced.  The bag of chips was $2 extra and amounted to the same chips you can get for about .75 in most convenience store, definitely not worth the money.  The sweet tea was quite good, not too sweet, though the serving sizes could have been bigger.  They also don't offer refills which would be nice, especially since chips are $2,00.

The sandwiches both had a good portion of meat and very little sauce, which I prefer.  If I want extra I'll add it.  There is nothing worse than a place that covers the meat in sauce to cover the taste of lousy bbq.  The brisket was moist and had a good flavor, not too much smoke.  The pulled pork on the other hand was rather bland.  It had no smoke flavor and there was no taste of the rub either.  I also found it odd that there was no bark on my wife's sandwich.  

How it got voted Best of Las Vegas is beyond me.  It's not that it was terrible, it was just average.   I would probably go back, but would order the meal instead of the sandwich.  For the same price as the sandwich and chips, you get two sides.",9qGOxS9tFI6M7QwG4JjYuQ,0,0,3,jG_zvn8wj-Ai6lO4vQMc8w

1193635,2014-07-15,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"What a find.  My buddy and I literally stumbled upon this place after checking out Freemont Street.  The Container Park caught our attention and we noticed Big Ern's when we checked out what was inside the Container Park.  

I'm here to tell you this is some very good barbecue.  The pulled pork and beef brisket I had were both excellent, and the portions were generous for the price.  

For sides, I got the barbecue beans the cole slaw, which were both excellent.  

We were eating late (10:00 p.m.) on a Sunday night, which made eating out the tables very pleasant.  It even rained briefly, which cooled things down a bit even more.  I love a light rain in the desert in the summer.  

I found the prices to be very reasonable given he quality of the food and portion sizes. 

My only gripe is they locked the doors at 10:45 (15 minutes before closing), which meant I could not get a second beer, and my buddy could not get some more barbecue sauce.  We saw a small group of would be customers get turned away, also. If you say you close at 11:00, stay open till 11:00.  

Bottom line.  I've had good barbecue in Memphis.  This place is legit.  If you were to add collard greens and white bread and perhaps some fried pickles to the mix. . . .",rCKLhzDdPofFLK9TC6UTyg,1,0,4,kv7MD434PMzMGDi8IjG4OA

It's just that we initially got half our order, then when we waited about 10-15 minutes for the other half, one of the guys said he accidentally threw out our ticket.

Definitely like the barbecue sauces. The meat was tender enough that it didn't take much to tear apart.

What kind of BBQ joint doesn't have a choice of french fries, baked potato, mashed potatoes or even just plain potato chips?  Potato SALAD?  Yeah, I'll have that with a side of diarrhea, please.  Disgusting.

Okay, well, first of all, don't believe the reviews.  I came here because it was recommended to me by Yelp!  Never again.  This place was an annoyance to get to, if you're familiar with downtown Las Vegas; it's right off Fremont Street at the aptly named Container Park.  What that means is that you'll be parking blocks away, feeding a meter, and then walking to your destination, rain or shine.

So I finally convinced myself to go.  I was feeling suicidal, which only leaves you two options: kill yourself, or get something good to eat.  I chose the latter this time.  I expected this to perk up my spirits, just a day before Lonely Christmas, but read on, fellow Yelpers...

After going out of my way to stalk this place, and in less than bitter spirits, I chose the three-meat combo in order to get it all out of the way; that's right, pulled pork, beef brisket and ""ribs.""  Just ""ribs.""  I had no idea what I was in for.

Paid the $15 (oh, did I mention I'm unemployed?) for the combo, in addition to the $1 in the meter (which I include in the bill, for the inconvenience).  Food came quickly; the line wasn't too bad.  Here's a round-up of the eats:

1) Pulled pork - the best part of the plate.  Stringy.  Cold.  But edible.  Pour a bunch of extra BBQ sauce on it because it is DRY.

2) Beef brisket - Hard.  Chewy.  You're forced to chew it for 5 minutes, then eventually swallow when you're tired of chewing.  This stuff was TERRIBLE.  Not recommended at all.

3) ""Ribs"" - NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION.  I don't even know what part of the pig this was.  The tendons?  It was not even remotely chewable.  I attempted to eat half of one, then asked for a to-go box for the remainder of the brisket and ribs.  I've never done that before.  Usually I finish it all in one go.  And that's not a compliment regarding the portions.

-1 Basic, unappealing menu. Sides have been pared down, the mac and mashed potatoes others mention in reviews are nowhere to be found. Don't take away side choices, improve them!  Choices are now just baked beans (tasted canned), coleslaw (too much mayo), a bag of chips, or a baked potato. $2 each with the purchase of a sandwich, 2 included in the cost of most plates. No thanks. 
-1 So. Much. Grease. I know barbecue isn't health food, but my order shouldn't be sitting in a puddle of grease. I literally dropped my chopped brisket sandwich because the bun was so slick. Gross!
-1 The barbecue sauce pump is empty at 1PM. Now I know y'all ain't had so much business that it all got eaten in a few hours. This should be checked daily before you even open. 
-1 No flavor, aside from grease and sauce. The brisket had great fall-apart texture and (more than) enough fat, but if you tried a bite without sauce it was bland. 
-1 It's 105 degrees outside and the cashier makes no mention of beverages? At the very least, a cup of water should be standard.

The $9 sandwiches are a good portion size, but the price is irrelevant if the product isn't appealing enough to finish. Also, this is the first place I've ever been that doesn't offer sliced pickles and onions to garnish your brisket sandwich.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,3,2,Bm2M_rVfjQH49X0Zl49cbg

Try attending the WINTER WONDERLAND to let my daughter experience something joy full to do for the holidays and it was closed(see review on that). 
Walked in my partner and child(4 years old) ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a 2 item (bris & ribs) VERY DRY CHUCKS & Ribs were all fat.
My pork sandwich was very dry went to add more bbq sauce to only LMAO that it wasn't even and homemade recipe( FYI meal was 23 bucks) should be able to get something more from the heart. The 2 meat combo that my partner order came with 2 sides got bbq beans and salad( NOT MUCH CHOICES FOR SIDES) in the meantime we both look at each other saying why did we send 20 on a fast food bbq that was so horrible. So my child took a bite of the salad then decide she didn't want it....
So I started to eat the salad to bite into a twisty tie (like the ones that come on bread bags). I almost lost it. Stayed calm because my 1st thought was what if my 4 year old got it so I immediately stop eating we excuse are selves and my partner goes to the cashier and demands the money back. She did and offered my partner a beer but I will never never ever eat there again. Last statement I noticed there was a award FOR BEST LAS VEGAS BBQ something for this year.

I am from Texas, so this is not the best BBQ I have ever had, but it is darn good and consistent for the price.

I like that they give me the choice of putting on as much or as little of either mild or spicy barbecue sauce.

The service has much improved and I like that Big Ern is often right there talking and meeting customers.

- Ribs

Food
========
Brisket was the best item of the plate.

Ribs didn't fall off the rib and were a little to dry for my taste. As sides go, I picked what should be the best indicators of a bbq joint, both of which were incredibly disappointing. They were both bland and lacked that kick that should be saying, ""Welcome to big Ern's, you've just been branded for life by our signature sides!"" Hoping they'll tweak them a little bit.

Service
========
Note: It was the first official day of the container park, so take this part of the review with a grain of salt and I wouldn't consider it indicative of a typical visit. **Service has no bearing on my star rating.**

Ordering took a while. It could've been the spike in customers and first time for the cashiers to be using Square, but it took a really long time for an individual to place an order (somewhere around 2 minutes, which is significant considering how fast the process should be at a place where they take your order at a counter).

Service line was fast, but they forgot one of my sides.

Overall, everyone working there was really nice and I think they probably have some kinks to work out, but the main things I'd look for next time I go back are more enjoyable/memorable sides and ribs that make your mouth water whenever you hear someone mention Big Ern's.",yw9Cl4SJLNSlkKp9eYMBng,0,0,2,XRBsmzzR4mv6p2-BqJ8fwg

The sides looked good but really lacked flavor. For example, the potato salad looked fabulous but really didn't taste like anything; the macaroni and cheese tasted like butter I guess. The biggest problem was the way they presented the meat. I ordered a three meat plate and they poured sauce on everything (NOT a good sign) and basically scrunched all three meats into a bowl. The brisket was thin and chewy, basically no smoked flavor. It also had cracks in it, so I guess they don't cut to order (either that are they are really doing something wrong). The ribs looked promising, but again they were chewy and no smoked flavor. The pork had slightly more flavor and the texture seemed right but the sauce was inappropriate (pulled pork typically has a thin vinegar sauce on the side, not BBQ sauce on top).

I guess me and my son appearance looked so ""hungry"" they thought we would eat anything they put on our plate. They gave us 3 ribs instead of 4 like they were suppose too. I let that slide and did not say anything. Mind you...my son is the kind of kid that eats ""everything"" you put in front of him, however, he took one bite of these ribs and said ""Mom, I don't want anymore.

Tonight was no different. After waiting in line for about 5minutes someone yells from the back ""we're out of :::insert majority of the menu items here::"" I have been craving bbq for weeks so I decided to stay in line and hope for the best. Funny thing the couple behind me made a comment about how dirty the kitchen looked. I thought to myself ""it's a bbq place, what do you expect..."" In hindsight I feel like that was the Universe trying to tell me something. 

After what seemed like an eternity's wait I finally made it to the cashier, who made no effort to hide her readiness to be off  he clock already. I intended to order a hot link plate, baked beans, and potato salad. But, you guessed it, they were out of potato salad, so I ordered the greens instead. I waited for my food, a girl, looking even more miserable that the first, brought it to me on a ""for here"" plate. I asked her if I could get it to go & sh begrudgingly obliged, after asking me again ""are you sure you don't want to just eat here."" 

Fast forward.

Get home, ready to dive into the meal that I've been craving. I break open the dinner roll and low and behold there's MOLD. Needless to say I had to trash the whole damn meal and I'm certainly pissed mostly be I was so close to feeding the craving -__- Definitely won't be eating here again and I will strongly advise my company to not cater from here either

2444473,2014-02-20,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"The reviews for Big Ern's seem to run (literally) hot and cold. I noted this on my handy dandy Yelp app, but also saw that the reviews for their previous pop-up location nearby were much better so I decided to give them a try. I'm glad I did - this was some pretty darn good BBQ.

I went for a three meat combo - I picked brisket, pulled pork, and hot links - which served with 2 sides. I went with Mac-n-Cheese and baked beans for the sides. I saw a lot of complaints about the price, but the $14.99 price tag on this platter is on par with the BBQ places I am familiar with in the DC-area, and the portion size was ample. (See photo)

Here's how I would breakdown the meal:

Outstanding: The brisket and the hot links. The beef brisket is among the best I have ever had. It was very juicy with the right level of smoke flavor. Not too smoky, not too bland. And the hot links were equally yummy ... a nice hint of heat, but not overpowering, and a great texture and flavor to the link.

Good: The sauce, the roll, and the beans. They only have one kind of sauce, and it's a sauce on the sweeter side, but not overly sweet like a KC style sauce. It has a nice balance of sweet and tangy. And the roll was very nice. (Both were much needed for the pulled pork.) The baked beans were good ... they may be canned beans as noted by another review, but they were cooked nicely with a nice blend of green pepper and onion with it. Nothing special, but they were tasty.

Meh: The pulled pork and mac-n-cheese. The pulled pork was surprisingly bland. There just wasn't much flavor with it at all. On a positive note, when placed on the bun with their house BBQ sauce, it went down nicely. But good pulled pork should stand alone, and this didn't. The mac-n-cheese reminded me of what my mom used to make. That's not a good thing, because my brother and I disliked it so much that we begged mom for Kraft instead. It's homemade, but it's basically taking block cheese and melting it with macaroni ... the oil from the cheese separates and makes it a bit of a mess.

And don't worry, you can get your beer on here too. None of the local craft brews that the other places in Container Park offer, but they stick to the hipster theme of their location, offering Fat Tire and PBR. (Yes, PBR has become THE hipster ""common"" brew) I hadn't had a PBR in a while, and enjoyed it with my BBQ. 

With more hits than misses, I'll give Big Ern's a solid 4 stars ... I'd definitely come back again for the brisket and the hot links.",vf4vSva7sCI0K4UAjHrJgw,3,1,4,epQ9NTw24L-6p3hYITIS1g
2491253,2016-07-13,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"First of all, if you're in the Downtown Las Vegas area, you need to head over to Container Park just to experience it. That, alone, is a great reason to visit Big Ern's.

Just like every other business at the park, this restaurant is installed in an old shipping container, which limits its size, but increases its novelty.

But you probably want to hear about the food. It's reasonably priced. Each meat plate is $10 for 5oz of meat, 1 side, and bread. Pretty good. And if you want an additional 5oz, you just pay an extra $5. It's a good deal if you want to try one of their sides. Otherwise, it's $17 for a pound of brisket.

The brisket itself was extremely tender. And with little fat on it, too--increasing the amount of actual edible meat you get. At first, I was curious why they just gave me a fork and no knife, but I soon realized the knife wasn't needed. You can cut right through it like fish (that is, if you're not already eating it with your hands). 

In fact, this meat would be at the top of my list if it weren't for the lack of distinct flavor--even if it had just a little. But pre-sauce, this meat had basically none. It's hard not giving it more points.

It's a good thing the sauce was tasty enough. It would've been a shame if it wasn't. While not the best, it definitely did the job in not making the meat quality be in vain. The sauce was harder to put my finger on. The cook in the back said it's ""California style,"" but I concluded it was more similar to Texas. But a little thicker than normal, and with a higher amount of sweetness. Almost Pepsi-nuanced. Maybe you could call it a peppery California sauce.

The baked beans were just okay, but if you add a little (or a lot) of BBQ sauce, they turn into something pretty good. The mac & cheese was my favorite of the sides. They were made with real cheese and had a comforting homemade feel. And they weren't too cheesy.

I have a weird thing for BBQ places that don't have cornbread, but at least they give you a dinner roll with each plate.

I would definitely come back to Big Ern's. If nothing else but as an excuse to visit the underappreciated Container Park. But it's reasonably priced for what you get--quality and all.",STPMW3_6Uk1CGCStvJkn4A,0,2,4,CGpHyLvwgy4KCN-TOZWkEA

2551869,2014-09-24,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"Smells great around this Container Park eatery, but the food is a much different story. Since neither a baked potato or mashed potatoes were included with their combos,  I chose the pork ribs combo platter with coleslaw and a green salad, while my love chose brisket with BBQ pork & beans and a green salad. Not normally a brisket lover, this brisket converted me; which made much more sense after trying to eat one of the pork ribs, because it tasted like beef jerky on a stick. The ribs were so undercooked that the grizzle was perfectly intact and not only looked, but chewed like gum. I realized that the reason their brisket tasted so delicious, was actually because it hadn't been cooked as long as normal, not even quite sure they know of this accidental perfection. I just wished they accidentally left their ribs on the barbie instead. The best part about the place was the option to pour my own BBQ sauce on the side. Trying to overlook the ribs I moved onto the coleslaw. It was seasoned lightly, served in a soupy consistency, but not half bad. I think they may have forgot to salt the cabbage, because the water kept coming, no matter how many times I drained it. I couldn't say much for the green salad, because it was more like a dead, wilted, slimey salad. They tried to hide limp black lettuce, along with rusted romain ends, under fresh green pieces; very shady if you ask me. I should have taken the counter girls bad customer service as a big hint to run to the next place fast, but it smelled so good I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I would buy a few sides of the BBQ baked beans to go from Big Ern's, because they were out of this world, loaded with shredded meat and could have easily been my meal; but never ever would I order the ribs or green salad from this place again. With so many awesome eateries and choices in Las Vegas, I say try another one.

2646045,2015-03-04,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"After walking by this place for well over a year today was the day I decided indulge.  I went on a mid afternoon stroll through the container park and none of the other places got me salivating like Big Ern's BBQ.  It was a quiet day at the Container Park and the rare desert  rain just stopped falling.   After looking over the menu and asking a few questions It looked like the pulled pork sandwich and side of pork and beans was the winning choice.  

The food came out quickly and there was a very decent portion of meat on the bun.  The roll was very soft and fresh and the pork was very juicy and tender.  Big chunks of pork smothered in sauce with just the right amount of fat and bark to make a vegetarians mouth water.  I prefer my BBQ sauce to have a little more heat to it because this was made to cater to all tastes of BBQ lovers.  I did not even ask if other sauces were available because I was sooo hungry.  the pork and beans were very good and had come out scolding hot not like the pork sandwich which was luke warm. My beans had big chunks of meat and a little bit of spice.  I would go back for these for sure, after working my way around the menu.  

The one down fall of this experience was the service.  I understand that this is a lazy rainy day at the CP.  All the more reason the operators have to go for it, this is the time to give that WOW! service everyone is looking for.  When I arrived both team members were in the dining room one on phone the other doing who knows what.  While trying to make conversation about the business the response most given was "" I don't know I am not the owner"".  A little turned off by this.  Then I had to ask about the rain several times and it was like no one was listening and then the answers were directed at me like I was a tourist.  Yeah turned off by this also.  

I decided to sit outside and enjoy my meal in solitude while watching the rain fall.  Very relaxing and boy I needed that after the weekend I had.  I am giving the 4 stars for the food and 3 stars for the mediocre service.  I will be back to try the Ribs and the Brisket.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,2,0,4,-tfu7qRSjf3JBQwG2Jh3hA

If I chose to stay in, I will usually order my favorites through postmates. Today, I decided to stop in before heading back to my office and received the absolute worst customer service in the 7 months of coming here. I saw new faces today, perhaps that was reasoning for subpar service. 

I noticed that their menu changed to a bright collage of poorly written letters from their previous printed menu. But noticed a few new things, like the chocolate raspberry bundt cake! Looked amazing. Wished I had tried it. I ordered my usual Brisket and Fries. The brisket loaded potato is also my favorite! But Brisket and fries. Oh and the cashier talked me into the cake. So I'm waiting for about 5 mins or so and the manager comes over to tell me that someone forgot to turn on the fry machine this morning (it's 12:30p right now) and he can't make fries. Kinda bummed out because they have decent seasoned fries. Don't get me wrong. I love the food. Not always consistent unless Gary and the lovely Hispanic cashier (forgot your name, I'm sorry) are working and that's when it seems like everything is quick and tastes like BBQ should taste!

So I tell the manager I don't really want anything other than fries and asked for maybe a lil more meat. He couldn't do that. I understood and was like I guess I'll just get a refund. The cashier who initially appeared warm and friendly says ""dude it's over fries!"" Not the point lady... it's 2 hours after opening during lunch hours on a Wednesday and you don't know your equipment isn't on? Just give me my money back. There's a heated exchange where she was reminded that I'm a paying customer, paying for a service that you are supposed to deliver, when you fail to meet those simple expectations I am well within my right to request to have my money returned for services undelivered. It is not your place to question my food choices or berate me with why you're selling fries and I'm purchasing them. Remember that. 

The manager, still very pleasant, urges this uncontrollable child to stop talking and she proves to be even more hostile while arguing about my refund not to mention insubordinate to what seemed to be a reasonable manager. She argues with me about not being able to give me a receipt showing that my credit card was refunded. Again manager steps in and does his job, not so effective but he tried.

3058421,2014-01-11,10,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"Well, it's in the CONTAINER park. So, like every store there, it's on the smaller side of things. I can see seating being a problem during the evenings and colder months, but anytime it's 60+ outside, the outdoor seating is more than adequate. I imagine the size also keeps the menu items at a minimum. 

Walking in you're hit with that signature smoked bbq scent, which should be sold as a candle scent bc I want to be around it at all times. 'Pork' by Calvin Klein. 'Burnt Ends' by Yankee Candle. Sign me up! The menu isn't large, but covers most of the bases. Pulled pork, chicken, brisket, ribs n hot links with a number of sides. Seeing as they were pulling meat from a freshly smoked pork shoulder as I walked in, I opted for the pulled pork sandwich with a side of slaw and a Fat Tire. Total came to $15. The meal ended up being great! The pulled pork was moist and had a hint of that smokey goodness. The accompanying bbq sawse was good and gets you through any of the larger, drier portions of the meat. I wish there was a spicy version though. There were two bottles sauce to choose from , so maybe there is, but they weren't labeled, so maybe there isn't. Who knows?! The slaw was solid too. Large chunks of cabbage and more of a vinegar base than a mayo drowning, which is always appreciated. 

While I'm going to eat my way around the park before I head back to try more of the menu, I will be back 100%. Any bbq fan that understands the limits of a restaurant in a container park is sure to be satisfied from the offerings of Big Ern.",NRGJ4IvauajqqCbhT640cw,12,7,4,x8zjUc0iHZDaYdD7FMqczA

We had the brisket, mac and cheese, and bbq chili. Everything was tasty. The Mac and cheese wasn't the best but I've paid for much worse. I only wish they had more sauce choices.

The pictures look good but the actual BBQ is even better .Located in the Container Park there is seating on  the stores porch or right next to the tree house. I have visited several times during the weekend and also during the afternoon and the store has always been clean and staff very friendly.

The 3 meat plate is good if you want to get an idea of what the menu offers. I have had the ribs(only 3 come with any of the plates),half chicken and pulled pork with macaroni and potato salad. Everything was cooked to perfection. The meats were all tender and I felt had the right amount of BBQ sauce. The potato salad is my favorite. The macaroni feels more stove top to me, I'm a baked macaroni type. However my little ones like it. My daughter says, ""it's cheesy, thumbs up."" The portions are very generous; the three meat plate definitely can feed two adults. On a different occasion I ordered the full rack of ribs. It's our favorite of everything on the menu. Definitely worth the money !

The kids love the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders are huge and they give out a lot if fries. The kids were not really a fan of the fries. I think it's because they prefer wedges or standard fries. I brought a friend with me the last time and her daughter wasn't a fan of the fries either. They did however like the sweet potato fries ( go figure).  The free refills on the kids drinks is also a plus.

The three meat plate was good in size with two sides, Mac and cheese and Cole slaw . My three meats were three pork ribs, pulled pork and brisket, a good sampling of what they had to offer. To start the meat was cold, the brisket was cut with the grain and each piece was very dry. I like to use the sauce to accent the bbq but here I needed it to just swallow. Needless to say this made all the meat very tough. Only positive was there was a good smoke ring in each meat. The sides were awful, the cole slaw lacked any flavor and spice, my wife commented it was like eating cabbage and water. The Mac and cheese was very grainy and lacking any really cheesy goodness, I took a picture to explain the comment. My wife's salad was fair with low quality ingredients, canned black olives, bad lettuce and some shaved carrots and dry meat.

Because the last time order it was some of the best smoked bbq beef brisket I had in a long time and I wanted your food again. What the hell happened?!!!!!!
I don't know if they were having an off day or who ever was in charge of cooking they need to season the food.
I'm very upset and appalled. I have ordered from here numerous  times and this will be my last order ever.

Today I ordered through DoorDash my driver gets there and calls me to tell me that, the company refused to give them my food because they no longer dealt with DoorDash, okay that's fine but since my paid for and received order went  through ,  they should've given the food anyway. Then they should've called DoorDash to tell them to close there deliver app for them.  

Red flag right there that shows you what kind of Integrity they don't posses  or at least whoever rejected my order in the first place. So afterward I call DoorDash to get them to get my order delivered. They got them to deliver Okay, Yes they honored the deliver  after I called but they didn't include a Im sorry Courtesy dessert or anything for me having to wait longer for doordash to resent a driver out to redeliver my order and rejecting my order In the first place .

 I should've followed my first thoughts and order from some other BBQ place. The food is all baked at least mine was baked  and don't even get me started on the Mac and cheese . I hate when a company cuts corners and bakes there meat and then says it BBQ . Get the hell out of here with that BS!! I I can see them BBQ the food and then the last 10 minutes baking it to ensure it super tender. Plus the food had Absolutely   no salt whatsoever and hardly no BBQ sauce on my food. What I got was a small drizzles of sauce over food.

I'm not one to add addition salt to my food very often. I hate to have to leave a harsh review but I'm pissed off!! Paid good money for a 1b of beef brisket and a bbq rib meal only to wish I had not ordered at all.

Why is it so hard to find good barbeque here? Oh, that's right - most barbeque places are JUST PLAIN LAZY!

I understand barbecue takes time, hours and hours in fact. But as long as there are places in this world like Franklin Barbecue in Austin, TX, where Mr. Franklin smokes his brisket for 16 hours before serving, not one single place in this town is going to get a break with their ""how do I get this done quickly?"" methods.

Now listen, I really like Big Ern. I have met the man and he is a genuinely nice man. I will honestly say that I think he does put a lot of heart into his cooking. His barbeque is pretty good, and I have stopped in on several occasions. 

I will say that when it comes to barbeque, Big Ern is kicking everybody's but here in Vegas. I love you for that Big Ern - I really do, but your just not there yet. 

As for the rest of you barbeque wannabees in Vegas - pack up and go home, before I step it up and show you all what real barbeque tastes like.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,8,7,3,D-F-tti3CqmgIN1C4D1ayg
3645061,2014-05-18,2,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"So unfortunate! Today was my 1st visit to the container park. My husband, 3 boys and I visited in the early afternoon. We chose to eat at Big Ern's BBQ. If it weren't for the HORRIBLE attitude of some of the staff, I wouldn't even be commenting. My husband saw an employee behind the food line DOUBLE DIP HER EATING SPOON IN THE PUBLIC MAC AND CHEESE. After my husband said something they removed the macaroni in question.  The employee that was taking my order even suggested that the trash be checked for  another spoon. That sounded reasonable. There could've been a chance that she was not double dipping into public food.  No second spoon was produced!  We didn't expect to eat for free or anything of that sort. We just wanted to feel like our patronage was important and that this issue would be dealt with swiftly and properly. Their treatment of us that followed is what affected my rating of them. A few employees stood behind the food line stealing glances at our family and shaking their heads. 

My husband doesnt like confrontation so for him to say something, the incident had to be really bad. A Big Ern BBQ employee that hadn't been present for the incident asked if everything was ok. My husband walked over and told him exactly what happened; That he watched an employee dip a plastic spoon into the macaroni and cheese that was being served to the public, ate off of that spoon and instead of throwing that spoon away and getting another plastic spoon she dug the SAME spoon that was just IN HER MOUTH, into the macaroni and cheese and took another bite. The lady that was running the cash register walked over to my husband and started yelling at him that the situation was over. That they took the food off of the line and that was that. The employee that did the double dipping said my husband was lying. 

Never have we felt so disrespected and unappreciated! It really is a shame. The  macaroni and cheese was delicious. It rivaled my mom's homemade macaroni. To bad all of that was overshadowed by the  blatant disregard for proper customer service and disgusting food service standards.",mSc9Mhe6ye6aHgGSaK2Bkw,2,1,1,Z-_kybDZEp7DWAGSPiHzOA

I mean, I wanna laugh just thinking about writing this review.

The BF and I weren't hungry but, decided to just try it since we were already at Container Park. 

Once we entered the place, the girl at the counter told us that they were out of all the meats, except the sausage links...which is funny because that's the one meat I didn't wanna try lol

Regardless, we went with it - sausage links sandwich and baked beans (for me) and mac and cheese (for him). The girl was nice enough to give us the extra side for free!

We got the sandwich first and once we opened our plate lunch, we had cut up sausage links and bread. 
Literally! 
No sandwich in sight.
I looked at my BF, then the menu, and was like: ""I thought this was a sandwich?????!""
Let it be known that the sausage links were tasty.

Then we get our side of baked beans and mac and cheese in cups. CUPS! The kinda cups that they prolly use for their complimentary waters. 
The baked beans were so hot that my cup started to melt at the bottom and completely disfigured. I couldn't stop laughing about it!
Baked beans weren't anything to rave about...nothing sweet or caramelized. Tasted like it was from a can, to be honest. 
The mac and cheese was penne pasta with soupy sauce.

Overall, disappointing experience. Only saving grace and only reason I didn't give it 1 star was the great service and personalities of those behind the counter.

****** This place just opened so I'm sure they have ALOT of glitches to figure out. Most def has a lot of potential.

4014503,2014-05-07,2,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"An honest 3 1/2 stars.

I really wanted to like Big Ern's BBQ more.  It's good, but only comes out to average for me when compared to other BBQ.  And we all are biased when it comes to BBQ because we all have different tastes.  Some love smoke, some love spice, some love sauce, some love tomato-based, some love mustard-based, and some love vinegar-based.  Hell, some folks even love BOILED ribs!  Just as a note people, boiled meats are NOT BBQ.

This was our meal when we visited Downtown Container Park.  It looked interesting because when we where there, this place had the longest line.  Figure the food must be the best around, right?  Well, yes and no.  It is arguably one of the best places to eat within the park.  But for BBQ it's not my favorite.  But still good for what it is.

We had the two item combo platter of pulled pork and hot link.  The platter came with a roll, and two sides.  Most popular items leaving the kitchen that day were the mac & cheese, and the baked beans.  We ended up trying those.  We also picked up an extra hot link sandwich to try.

Verdict?  As I said before, good but not great.  The pulled pork was a bit on the dry side and was light on flavor, but good on smoke.  The sides were OK - the mac & cheese was yummy but needed a bit more cheese.  The baked beans were decent, not overly sweet and I think there may have been bits of pork in it.

The star of the show was the hot link.  These I liked very much!  Spicy, good flavor, and good texture.  They had a great chew when you bit in to one, nice snap.  Delicious on the hot link sandwich.  Their BBQ sauce isn't bad either, tomato-based, it appeals to those who like a sweeter sauce.  Slather this all over your hot link sandwich and it was good eats.

Reason why it's down a 1/2 star is the darn pricing.  Whoa, I get it, everything in Downtown Container Park is pricey!  I mean for $12 on a two item combo platter I was expecting a bit more food.  It's good for one person, a bit difficult for two to share.  The sandwiches are $7 each but don't come with a side.  It will cost you $2 more to add that on.  Adding on a soft drink will tack on another $2.  Don't go to Big Ern's BBQ expecting a cheap meal!

Another cool restaurant located in the downtown Las Vegas Container Park. When walking into the Park it is a short stroll off to the right hand side on the main level.

I've been here a few times while visiting the container park with family and friends. The ribs, Mac n cheese are my usual but I've been told the brisket isn't so bad. 

The BBQ here overall is not  to bad, it isn't the best in town, but not bad for the location and general access to hearty meal. They also offer a few beers on tap which is a nice touch to wash down your BBQ. Like all the container park restaurants they use the biodegradable silverware and plates which is a nice touch.

Usually I have found a lot of the times coming here, it can be a painfully long line and once you have your meal, the seating area is quite limited in the actual container. Outside seating is is also offered but usually takin up by someone watching the main jungle gym.

The chicken was a little on the dry-side, but I looooved the bbq sauce that came on it. I am usually a hater of bbq sauces because they usually over power my taste buds. But this sauce actually complimented the chicken well.  

The only critique of the sandwich was that the bun was cold and it would have been TOTALLY awesome if it was warm and toasted. But hey, what can I do?

My dude got the two meat combo with sausage and brisket. He said he liked it. So I snuck a piece of his brisket and it was indeed tasty but a little dry.

I ordered 1/2 lb of brisket I did ask for it to be .25 moist and .25 lean. I didn't get that but what I did get was the best brisket I have had in Vegas. I seemed to only get the brisket from the moist cut. No lean was to be found on my plate. As well the 1st plate came out with sauce. Yikes such a no no. They replaced it and we go from there. The 1st taste was really good. I have had better else where but not in Vegas. I will say am not sure they are trimming the briskets correctly though. Even though the taste is there and the smoke ring. It was lacking a great bark and it had a lot of fat the should have been trimmed. With my knowlegde of brisket I am pretty sure this was not trimmed down enough. Either that or the smoker they are using is not rendering down the fat enough. I will be back and look foward to trying more things at Big Ern's. Maybe even bump this up to a 4 on a rereview.

Didn't want to do complete update. It is staying a 3 lack of bark and to much fat. Best brisket in Vegas but that is not hard to do.

Food:  I got the ribs because lets face it, bbq = ribs.

The pork and beans weren't too bad but really that's not going to bring me back here.

Pulled pork sandwich w/ a choice of side: potato salad was my choice and 2 soft drinks. $18 total and added a tip:)

They have a very full menu offering all the classic meat and sides. They have brisket, chicken, ribs, pulled pork, and hot links. My husband and I decided to split the 2 meat and 2 side combo and chose brisket and hot links for our meat and the mac & cheese and potato salad for our sides. Let me tell you, I wanted to shove him out of the way and totally not share. It was that good! The brisket was perfectly cooked and so tender. The hot links had just the right amount of kick to them. The spice was flavorful and not overpowering.They also had a perfect blend to their BBQ sauce; not to spicy, not to sweet. Loved it! The sides were ok, but I would try their BBQ beans and maybe the coleslaw next time. The potato salad looked more like mashed potatoes and lacked flavor and the mac & cheese was good just not that great. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful by any means, just not fantastic. 

There is limited seating out front and inside, but if you are willing to walk upstairs there are loads of seating and excellent people watching.

5042189,2014-03-04,2,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"It was time for date night and we both settled on this place.  I've known the owner for years and wanted to support his business.  My date wanted to eat BBQ so it was a win win situation.  Located in the Container Park, this place recently opened and was part of the grand opening in this new outdoor center.  

Just like other businesses, this place is located in a reused shipping container.  Inside is super quaint, they use the space well!  The kitchen is stainless steel, colors of red and white trimmings seem to work well!  The menu is displayed on the front wall with wooden panels stacked on a red background.  You literally order your food, grad your utensils and condiments on the other side and have a seat.  There's inside and outside seating.  Inside, you have wooden tables, as well as red, white and blue chairs.  Outside seating makes you feel like your sitting on an outdoor porch.  Literally, you are! LOL.  

For dinner, I got the 2 meat comb platter for $11.95.  I chose the Brisket and Chopped Chicken with two sides of cole slaw and BBQ baked beans.  The cole slaw wasn't the best in my opinion.  What seemed like a vinegar based slaw, was actually a watery mayonnaise based slaw.  Too soupy.  The baked beans was the star of the meal!  Super flavorful, sweet, salty with the pork.  It was awesome!  For the meats, the chicken was good.  It didn't have that smoky flavor I was hoping for, but seemed to do well with the BBQ sauce.  The brisket unfortunately was too dry.  You needed the BBQ sauce for it.  I was hoping for more of a marbleized flavor but didn't.  The roll served with my meal almost tasted like cardboard. It was so dry.  I wish they took the time to at least warm it up or toast it.  

I'm definitely going to be back.  I support all of our downtown business and certainly wish the best for Ernie and his business. I hope my next trip will change my mind on my overall ratings.

5092326,2016-05-18,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"Some Vegas locals I was visiting wanted to show me around Fremont Street this past Saturday night while I was in town and decided that going to the Container Park for our (very late) dinner would be the best so that we'd have choices and not all have to get the same thing.

I love all things meat (if you have read my reviews, you know this) and BBQ is an absolute favorite of mine, especially brisket.

What do I like more than brisket?

Macaroni and cheese!

So I was pretty darn excited over this dinner. It took a little longer to get than I expected, but maybe it just felt like we were waiting forever. Our friends were able to walk over to the hot dog place in Container Park, order their dogs, and walk back over before we'd gotten ours, and there hadn't been other people in line ordering before us. Luckily, I wasn't ravenous or anything so the wait wasn't bad.

At first glance, because my eyes are often bigger than my stomach, the three slices of brisket didn't look like much, but it was plenty and I didn't quite finish. If I had, I may have needed to be carried to the car.

The meat itself was super tender and melt in your mouth. It so easily came apart, there was no need for even a plastic knife. The fat came off really easily which is important to me as someone who really hates chewing fatty bits with the meat. The meat itself was unfortunately kind of salty, which is really noticeable to me (and was to my friend as well, who got the pulled pork and ribs - I tried his pulled pork and it was DELISH).

The BBQ sauce was good, if a little bit strong in both the sweet and tangy departments. It's hard for me to find a restaurant BBQ sauce I really like, but I hold out hope. This sauce reminded me of the one I've had at Phil's BBQ in San Diego - people go gaga over that stuff but the sweet plus the little hint of sour bite means that halfway through the meal, my tongue starts to get a little sore like I've been pounding sour candies.

The macaroni and cheese was definitely my favorite part. A lot of BBQ places serve rather dry mac and cheese, but I like mine drenched in creamy, oozy cheese sauce. This wasn't super oozy, but it was creamy and cheesy, rich and comforting. The little styrofoam cup's worth was unassuming but plenty!

Overall, it was a perfectly fine late-night meal for a Saturday of walking around Fremont. If I found myself back at Container Park, I'd probably eat here again but get the pulled pork. Or maybe just a ton of macaroni and cheese on its own!",C153mp-HHFvf5G9LetRaTg,0,0,3,rhGhGFHCds0oBOCh3vVyRg

Now onto the food! The brisket was fork tender because I wasn't given a knife but it was tender enough I really didn't need a knife. Saving the environment one tender brisket piece at a time.

The pulled pork was tender but the star was really the brisket. It had a nice smoke ring and plenty of smokiness. I also liked that they didn't kill it with sauce and let the meat speak for itself. 

The hubs finished off the cole slaw. My five year old stole my chips. The roll was meh, but I was happy with the quantity and quality of the brisket.

I tried the brisket combo which comes with two sides along with a bread roll. The sides I chose were Jambalaya and the Collard Greens. As for the sides the greens were fantastic although very salty with a lot of juice at the bottom of the cup.. I personally like my greens like this, although many people would find it salty almost like a soup broth. The Jambalaya was honestly some of the most bland that I have ever tried and lacked anything that makes a good jambalaya good. The most important piece of the meal is the brisket which was served to me not in slices but rather in chunks.. Sort of like tuna fish..it was not melt in your mouth and honestly tasted much like cheap roast beef that would placed in like a soup or on some beef stroganoff. Absolutely one of the worst brisket dishes I have had from a BBQ restaurant. The bread was just a cheap dinner roll and nothing homemade. I will say that the hot bbq sauce is very good and probably my favorite condiment sauce I may have ever tried. Don't know if it's homemade or something like Sweet Baby Rey's or slaking those lines.
My wife tried the loaded Potato Bomb and while it was 10 bucks.. I will say that the potato was huge and filled with toppings. I am not a potato fan but she said she loved it. Looked pretty impressive in size.

At Big ern's thats where! I had the brisket sandwich with side of mac and cheese for about $11 bucks. The pricing was a bit more than I like to pay for, but I understand... its how it is downtown for a reason. But enough about the cost.

Mac and cheese- I heard was good, but the one I had was not that tasty. 
Brisket- flavorful and a good portion by the way

When I tried the brisket with some of there sauce it gave it that extra kick that I like when eating bbq. I feel though that I could have had a better side.

After waiting for a long time, I went back to the counter and asked the cashier if maybe they called our name and we didn't hear it. It was not busy at all, so I highly doubted it. She asked the cook about our order and he took his time finishing washing a pan before looking for my ticket and when he couldn't find it, asked me if I had a receipt. The cashier stepped in and showed him something and then turned to me and said ""He's making your food now"". 
I'm irritated, but whatever, mistakes happen. I asked the cashier for a free side for making us wait for so long and the cook said no. He said the ticket just didn't print....as if that's not the restaurant's mistake. Then he asked me where we had been sitting and said he couldn't see us on the patio. I asked what difference that made if he didn't make or call out our order anyway. Now I'm getting mad because he's being openly rude and acting like any of this is my fault somehow and has not once apologized for the long wait or losing my order. 
I tell the cashier that at this point I'd rather just have my money back because I just want to leave. The cook finally brings over two pitiful looking sandwiches as I'm trying to get a refund and I tell him he can keep them and I just want my money back. The cook of course gives me attitude about that. The cashier claimed she was new, but somehow quickly figured out how to do a refund....My guess is she has a lot of practice at it.
We took our money next door to Bin 702 where we ordered food from a friendly bartender, our order was actually made, the food was great, and we lived happily ever after.

5504348,2016-01-01,0,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"We ate here for lunch after seeing another customer enjoying his rib combo meal out in the park. the smell of the ribs were mouth watering and he was happily digging in. I enoy a good BBQ at least 3xs a year. so this was our year end meal as it was new years eve, and a new place to try.

The meal was excellent. we got a 2 rib and brisket combo with collard greens and jambalaya, the second plate was pulled pork and hot link combo with Mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. At first my daughter noticed the pork was cold on the outside, but inside was hot, so it must've been sitting while the fries were being made. the ribs were tender and flavorful and so was the brisket, even though it wasn't cut across the grain. The collards had a tad of spice and weren't chopped up as small as the norm,  but had good flavor. The pulled pork and hot link were also good. Sweet potatoes fries were the best I've had. nice and crispy. and the mac n cheese was smothered in cheese which makes it all the more delicious.  The jambalaya was ok, with bits of hot link in it. All in all this meal was great. we almost cleaned the plate, but left bits n pieces. 

I am holding back on the 5th star though. We went at about 1215p on a Friday,  New Years Eve. I'm not sure how crowded this place gets otherwise,  but we didn't have a line when we went in, there were a couple of diners in the establishment which seats maybe 15 max with outside tables as well. unfortunately there was one inconsiderate diner who took up the biggest table in one if the corners that could've sat at east 6. anyway,  shortly after we got our order is when we noticed a line forming. The restaurant is small so it got pretty crowded in there as we were in the other corner dining. I think someone opened the doors so the line could queue outside. That's when I noticed that it was taking some time before you placed your order until you actually got it. it seemed as though we were halfway through our meal before the lady who placed her order right after us finally got hers. I didn't notice how big the kitchen was, or how many  people were back there, but it's BbQ. Most of everything on the menu should already be made, except for the fries and chips. maybe that's what people were ordering?  I couldn't see justification for the long wait for your order. just for that fact, I may be hesitant to go back there, but if I find myself back at the Container park, I may dine there again.",RlM6cIrCoRgi_nYXMBpa6Q,1,0,4,y6_J5uQLChJyQWh5UoVZRQ

Guess one was young adult. The other Cow was 100 years old. So Sad. 60% of Rib Slab was Magnificent. The rest was leaning dry. Must have gotten this rib from TWO Pigs. One was Grandma. Pulled Pork was 3.75+ stars. Honestly the batch might have been cooked yesterday. And reHeated for this evening. With their two type Wonderful BBQ sauces... left overs next day should be OK for sandwhiches. That tough Brisket may need to be Double Chopped for Sandwhiche use.

Some our Dinner was 4.5-5 stars. Some was 1-2 stars.
We ordered no Sides. Based on Yelp Foodies warning.

Total rating. I hate to do this. 3 stars as conservative.
Largely because $10 of the Brisket should not have veen served to Us. Whether cut across the grain or not.


We can't risk going back. $20 part of our $65 purchase was MEH. IF thats OK for Yelpers... Go eat here. If not. Take wisdom from 3 stars Yelp Reviews here.

But then again. On Fremont street one can Blow Multiple $20's in hour or less. Actually so many Eateries here... why not Enjoy $65 on many their Other Offering under the streets Long Light Show. Sad. Are We. It could have been a 5 stars review. And Many Many Many return VISITS.

5526806,2014-02-24,5,hQ4IGBbdDcCUh11zUSzwCQ,"Overall review notes: Don't bother.

There are several choices at the Container Park when it comes to food, we happened to pick this one. The place smelled amazing! The line was forever long, that's a good sign right? ... how could this place only have a 2.5 star rating?!? That's what I kept telling myself as I stood in line for what felt like a lifetime. When the bf got to the counter we realized what was causing the wait. The one, count them one person working the register was a young girl who was seriously either high as a kite or hung over. She was forever slow and had no enthusiasm or urgency to place the order.

Once we placed our order the food came out relatively fast, but it was awful! I can honestly say it's the worst BBQ I've ever had - including my own burnt BBQ at home. It was such a disappointment because it all looked so good!

The Pulled Pork Sandwich ($8.95 with 1 side) - the bun was wet and soggy on the bottom, from i don't know what, probably being frozen at some point. There was almost no BBQ sauce on it, definitely not enough to cover the meat. I didn't even eat the bun, and had only 1/2 of the pork.

The Baked Beans - looked amazing, but were not sweet or smoky at all. I can't put my finger on what they tasted like, cardboard maybe??

The Potato Salad - bland, almost no flavor.

The Mac and Cheese - not creamy, not very cheesy, mostly just tasted like noodles. Bleh.

The BF ordered the 2 meat plate with Beef Brisket and Chicken. his meat had almost no BBQ either. We got extra on the side and had to keep pouring it on. But even the BBQ sauce is just meh. 

Really, just don't bother. It's not worth the time or the money, or the calories. we didn't eat half of any single item.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,4,2,1,gS5HwX6L2-AY8OZZbmBxIQ

My friend and I have only ordered the pulled pork sandwich both times and found out to be pretty good. It is served with hot, crispy fries and the sandwich is big piled high with pork. Of course, there is always room for more BBQ sauce which makes it taste even better. The pork itself is moist and tender.

Let me start of by saying the service was good, the cashier was funny and friendly, the cook looked like he was happy to be there, and the place looked to be a nice place to stop into after a couple drinks at one of the bars in Container Park. But that's about where it ends.

We ordered the ribs, hot links, pulled pork sandwich, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. Let me sum it up quick because you don't need to read a novel:
 The pulled pork sandwich was actually pretty good with the bbq sauce. 
The hot link had a decent kick to it but was a little full of gristle and was alright. 
The mac and cheese was greasy but dry and flavored with salt and water (weird).
The potato salad wasn't bad but I have a feeling it's probably going to look about the same on the way out.
The ribs were an epic fail. How are these chewy, gristly, tough stubs ribs? What animal did you take these from? I'm not even sure McDonald's would use that rib meat for their McRib. 

I like to give places the benefit of the doubt so maybe some day I'll give it another shot...and probably after a couple shots. But I hope they pull it together because a ""good"" bbq spot on Fremont would be clutch.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,3,1,2,679vQ91FZbxO_1cBe6jW_g

Meat is dry as hell, the sauces have no flavor (how is this possible, you ask? don't waste your money finding out), and the prices were way higher than they should be for something I'd rather throw out than give to the meth addicts waiting outside the park.

I enjoyed both the ribs and brisket, but the pulled pork was dry and tasteless. I would pass on that item on the menu. BBQ bake beans were awesome, but the Mac & Cheese weren't up to par. They didn't have enough cheese and the pasta used make it chewy. Maybe the pasta was undercooked..... Free refill on drinks, but if there is a long line at the counter don't even bother trying to get a refill. 

Big side note about seating!! Space is limited inside and there are seats outside. We were originally gonna sit outside but then I noticed above your head is where people are walking and there are holes on the flooring above. If you mind dirt and other god awful things on people's shoes DO NOT SIT ON THE PATIO. 

Overall it was decent.",I0bI_DAQ4h-9WPrVWdwolg,3,0,3,G7uNIuhXMuxjpDdnpAFBBA

We had family in town and none of us had ever been to the container park, so we decided to check it out. It was a bad idea altogether, we should have just stayed at the Fremont! But anyway, after walking around we decided to stay and eat dinner at one of the few restaurants at this place. From what we saw, our choices were BBQ, Mexican and Hot Dogs, so we decided to go with BBQ. The employees were just standing around and talking when we walked in. They did greet us, but didn't seem very friendly. The menu wasn't huge. They have the normal choices of Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket and Chicken. I decided to go with the Pulled Pork Dinner with Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries. Right when the cashier handed the receipt to my brother in law, that is when I noticed the sign showing the Grade C. Crap! Well, it was too late now. The food was already paid for and I doubt that the employees would be willing to give a refund. If we didn't have family with us, I probably would have fought it lol.

The food was brought out by one of the cooks and it just went downhill from there. I took the first bite of the pulled pork and it was cold. Maybe it was just that side of the plate? So I took another bite from the other side and it was still cold. Ugh, really? It wasn't fresh, but did they forget to warm up the pork or did they just not give a damn? I think they just poured BBQ sauce over it and called it a day. It was so bad that I can't even remember if the BBQ sauce was good or not. The Mac and Cheese and the Sweet Potato Fries were actually hot, but there was nothing spectacular about them either. I didn't even try the roll that came with the dinner, the bread was not edible at all. 

The next day, I felt sick, even though I barely ate the food. Well, I did eat food from Panera as well, but I am 99.9% sure I got sick from this place! Don't expect anything good from a BBQ restaurant in a container. 

Never Again!! Stay Away!!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,10,2,1,X5k-gGgptnhIUzxXLlLTYw

I love  good pig and being able to add my own amount of sauce was a  wonderful idea! Just wish you had more beer choices. That's why four stars. Other than that a five star experience. Thank you so much!",yczoGAa-tHtjPvmStjMGjA,0,0,4,ZkZfnF_DzWtGvJHzfz9EJQ

Service was quick and promt and they also have the cheapest beer in the container park area wich is a big plus.  

Kind service add to the experience.",qFKZoe-_3qxk-iCKp1qfaA,1,0,4,ehJsBDLVFARYRzQudh-8JA
