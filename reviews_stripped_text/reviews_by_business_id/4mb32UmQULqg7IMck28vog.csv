Had to wait another 10 minutes for drinks. Staff only starred at us while we ate and had to wait another 10 minutes after done eating for the server to come over and give us the check.

Might be just be a personal preference. I ordered the vegetarian torta and a taco. My mom ordered the tortilla soup and the chicken flautas. 
I think what stands out most about this place is that everything is so fresh. You can taste the difference in quality compared to a lot of other places in town. They're open late which is convenient for those nights when you need good late night Mexican food or a good drink without the guilt that usually comes along with it. 
Lastly I'd just like to throw out there that there churros might be better than Disneylands. And that's a bold claim. We'll definitely be back to try their breakfast soon.",6fBV8MB549fA5G1NmtRkVg,0,0,5,ulEyrIn_JTOe4y5V1OGQRQ

There were 3 servers and about 5 tables. No urgency to try and get our drink order, let alone get our food order. 1 girl walked by us no joke about 10-15 times and didn't even look over at us. The other girl, went back and forth from the kitchen and the other server kept going to the table where one of the owners was sitting. We love the food and but the service was terrible, if you call it service because we didn't get any food or drinks.

The rice that came with the enchiladas was disgusting! You could tell it was old rice bc it was crunchy and completely inedible. I couldn't finish the enchiladas and the rice I couldn't even eat it past the first bite. The corn was they only part of my meal that was decent. The food was not only terrible but over priced too.

984498,2017-05-25,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"We went here for the first time after wanting to go here for awhile! We decided to take our daughter and grandson who cautioned us that it would be pretty pricey. We didn't listen because we wanted to have lunch with them but honestly, how much can Mexican food cost? Well we found out. First of all the ambiance is fun and it has a lot of great features about the Mexican culture. The taco truck in the front of the place was a cool addition. The Lotteria cards as table cards was a cool idea. The car seats as booth seating was pretty nice as well and the stringed lighting makes you feel like you're in a backyard in LA. We ordered 3 horchatas. They are great and I recommend them! However, you literally get a child size plastic to go cup of this drink. Thumbs down for presentation and portion on that. Then the home made guava flan came out. To me it was bland. You can't taste guava in there at all. So why even put it out there? Thumbs down. The flautas came out. Presentation was awesome! Portion was perfect and it was really really good! Two Thumbs up. Then the main course. So Asada tacos were pretty good. I do have to say the tortillas are decent but a little on the thick side and I like them thinner. We tried the chicken mole and it's good too but I don't recommend it as a taco. Just a dish with beans and rice because the sauce is too think to be in a taco. A very disappointing dish was the Al Pastor!! We got it in a burrito and taco style. They both fell flat and short from taste and quality. Just to let you know... A PERFECT Al Pastor should have piña chopped and marinated with the meat and the meat should be tender because of the acidity of the pineapple. Neither of these things happened and I found myself having the worse Al Pastor I've ever had in my life. Which is very upsetting because that happens to be my favorite meat. Beans and rice were fresh. All of the tortilla chips were overcooked and burnt! Even my nieto wouldn't eat them and he LOVES chips! So on to the service. We are greeted by a female server who was very helpful and friendly. I recommend keeping her because she's funny and pays attention to everything that's going on in that restaurant. I didn't get her name but she's crazy. In a good way. So I'm sure you'll figure it out. The other server who happens we to be pregnant, she was the opposite. She needs to go home and not work in an eatery with people. She didn't look like she wanted to be there, was quiet and looked tired, which again, if she's pregnant maybe she shouldn't work in that type of job. Especially as a safety issue because what if she falls!? She could hurt herself and baby.. She actually made the experience a little bad because she wasn't as friendly and upbeat as the place itself. I feel bad because I know it must be tiring to have to work but with the enormous amount of money being shelled out by patrons for your overpriced food, you really need to consider who is serving it! Our bill came and it was $82. Yes, $82. For 3 kid size horchatas, 2 bland flans, 2 flautas, 1 burrito, a taco combo plate, a kids quesadilla (which by the way we asked to gave a to go box so we could take it with us and the server never brought it put so we said forget it and left it behind) 7 asada tacos. It literally was $16 for 5 tacos! Lol.. Well we tried it and we now know that we are sticking to our Lindo Michoacan in Henderson or Taco Y Taco in Henderson.. Hell, I might just move to Henderson if it means getting a decent Mexican dish in this city... Sorry Piches Tacos.

1095371,2015-10-08,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Finally a good late night spot by my house- AND THEY HAVE A BAR! 

I had the chance to try out Pinches at the soft opening today. Upon walking in, the place was packed and I was still welcomed graciously by the employees, which I later found out was one of the owners. I've opened a lot of restaurants and I know how rough openings are, but wow- they made it look easy. If it's this great already, I see a bright future for Pinches!

I tried the El Pastor taco & the pollo taco- both delicious. My first time having pastor and I was very impressed. My family has owned an authentic Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas since the 1960's, so I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, and I finally found one that I like. Quality ingredients, not just loaded with sour cream and cheese. The tortillas were handmade, and that makes ALL the difference. 

There's outside patio seating available and a full bar area that's half inside and half out. The seating is very relaxed and spacious.

After speaking with the owner, Jorge Anaya aka ""Pinche"" I learned a little more about the restaurant. They have multiple locations in California and one in downtown Las Vegas. He was awesome and treated me like I was at home, very smart guy that you can tell cares about the very last detail of his food.  

I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu!

In the words of Jorge, ""We don't take life seriously, we just take our tacos seriously.""",eMOpOLfR1Zz5tfHUlzMp_w,2,2,5,N8_ed_hAJGYlRspFLz1rVA

We had the 3 tacos combo plate the corn and the not nachos all for around 25 bucks which is crazy affordable compared to other Mexican restaurants I have been to.

1223559,2016-01-18,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"In the mood for some great New Mexican food I headed down to the new spot in the up and coming Gramercy development.

Went straight to the bar as that's my usual spot to hang out grab some drinks and enjoy the atmosphere.

To start off Pinches has a great little seating area and some fun decor with an actual taco truck inside the main dining room.

That is about all they have going for them. I sat for about 20min, at  the bar, before being acknowledged. After another 10min I finally had some water in front of me and was able to place a food order while the guest sitting in the booth behind me (that were there long before me) waited to be served. As I write this now at the end of my experience they still don't have water in front of them. Food came to me in a decent timeframe although it wasn't what I ordered. When my order arrived, I have to say, it wasn't bad! Nothing special, but not bad. 

The staff argued with each other in front of guests, constantly on their phones, not cleaning the dirty dining room, it was really rather embarrassing.

Where it got at its worst and prompted me to write this review was when I witnessed the bartender eat french fries off the back bar, proceed to washing dirty glasses, then eat more fries, then make and garnish a drink. Did I mention that during that time she never once washed her hands!!!!

The rest doesn't need to be mentioned, that is more than enough for me to know that I will never be coming back here or recommending it to anyone.

I'm going to attempt to track someone down to close out my bill now since the same bartender left the bar unattended for a cig brake.",6Fk1JTbhGwe4jhE3KArMLQ,1,0,1,V0EKeJvLcjArJtv2RTkSLQ
1237206,2016-06-12,1,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Definitely one of the best Mexican places I've been to in the southwest (of Las Vegas). We were greeted promptly by a waitress who was just passing by and told us to sit where ever we like. We sat in the bar area at a table, it took a few minutes for us to be notice but the service was really great. We came during happy hour which is from 4-7 pm all tacos are al a carte but only $2 each (there are a few exceptions though).

The food: 
We ordered 1 taco al pastor - really good but a little too marinated for my taste. 
1 shrimp taco - amazing! 
1 fish taco - amazing!
1 pollo a la parilla - so moist and well cooked/marinated
1 taco de lengua - the meat itself lacked some flavor and the green salsa on it was too spicy for me but overall this one gets a 3 on its own.
1 gringo taco - comes in a fried hard shell tortilla, my bf really liked this one. 

The ambiance is loud and fun as a bar should be. But if you want to privacy and seclusion they have the opposite side of the bar where the dining area is which I think is good for that.",pvIJiROj_2BamtavC9r0wQ,1,1,5,0LCRob_I-ZndX4AP-LBD_Q

We had the carne asada burrito, which was so full of refried beans I had forgotten it was supposed to be steak, the few pieces of steak that were in there tasted so overwhelmingly of onion i was glad that there wasn't more. Don't get me wrong, I love onions, and cook and eat them all the time, however the meat tasted like it was marinated in grated white onion and nothing else, though the meat was tender. The salsa that was served on the side was completely flavorless, though it did look to be freshly made. We also had a 3 taco combo which came with rice and beans (both bland) the chicken mole taco was good, but not great. The citrus carnitas were totally flavorless, and the adobada pork was surprisingly also tasteless as well. The tortillas however appeared to be freshly made, and were really good. We also had chicken flautas, which were probably the best thing we ate, although once again, the chicken lacked flavor. We also tried a veggie taco. The vegetables weren't caramelized, and... Big surprise here.... Lacked any sort of flavor.

I will say that all of the ingredients seemed fresh, and of decent quality. Everything needed salt, and desperately lacked flavor, heat, or taste of any kind. They joke that this is Mexican food for gringos, they aren't kidding.

For the price ( around $50, for counter service, this to me is expensive.) We won't be back.",f--ona4DuvVKoKoumX4Tyg,4,0,3,EhXAcNzlJkHYuifcqwDaIw

Plenty of space when you walk in. No host was there when we arrived so not sure if there is one generally there. One of the servers who was helping another table said we could sit wherever we liked. There is vehicle built into the establishment which is an interesting touch. When you first walk in there is opening seating. When you proceed further there is a bar. The decorations in the establishment are all Hispanic based. Bright vivid pastel colors.
This place serves up street taco style tacos (fit in the palm of your hand). The combo plate they have gives you 3 tacos, rice & beans. I ordered the asada (grilled angus beef), pescado (Fish with Veracruz cole slaw) & Pollo a la Parrilla (grilled chicken) w/ beans on the side for my date. My date ordered the combo plate w/ chicken & asada double rice. Her plate came out first & 5 minutes later my plate came out. This was odd to me that our food didn't come out at the same time. 
The food was delicious. The fish was well put together w/ flavors. The chicken was not dry which can happen from time to time. It's flavoring was on point. The asada was the tastiest of the three in my opinion. However it was a close race for sure between the three. My date also enjoyed her tacos. 
This is a place I will return to for more tasty tacos. As mentioned it's def a hidden gem of tasty goodness.",lK6vU1_UCK1owB6VEIOZPQ,0,0,4,38z1rQkJnDnycjEPhuLn1A

Not professional, long faces on the young waitress & the man who brought the food & the one handling the money. The waitress went home walked out the door & didn't say bye, nothing! No one ever came back to ask if everything was ok, if we wanted another beer, etc. They never offered us dessert. We waited for someone to come back & ask us if we were ready for our check. We waited awhile for some assistance. It never happened, we had to get up & go look for someone. The bill was wrong. It had to be fixed. That took forever. Last the food was tasteless, cold & tasted as if it was out of a can. We were so disappointed.

My mom & I walked in, were greeted promptly by a guy who handed us menus and advised us to sit anywhere we wanted.  Now, I guess to be fair to him, and the girl that was also serving, the NCAA Championship game was on.  So, the end of the game and the three other tables in the restaurant were taking up a lot of their time.

Anyway, we perused the menu for a couple of minutes, decided what we wanted, put the menus down, and waited for someone to come by to take our order.  And waited .. and waited.  We sat there for a good five minutes and nobody ever visited our table to take a drink order, ask if we had any questions .. Nothing.

First of all how cool it the name the style of this place? The cool vibrant edgy and kick back feel is exudes through their decor. The owners must want people to feel excited and comfortable yet get great food at the same time. 

With a fake taco truck right in the middle of Resturant and Pinches everything this taco place easily won my heart over quick. 

But the tacos really do steal the show. With home made tacos fresh in front of your eyes and mouth watering meats who can go wrong. The special ""Gringo"" taco was actually really really good. A hard shell fried taco with tender flavorful steak inside and a spicy creamy sauce it was sooooo good. The lingua was also amazing and as tender as can be. The tortilla though in picture I thought it was going to be this thick doughy tortilla oh but was I wrong thin and warm with a great corn taste you can tell the difference why it's better then store bought and pre made. 

Burrito was good and I was glad they had that option but I will stick to the tacos cause they were amazing. They offer a HH with $2 tacos and $4 beers all night on certain night.

2009928,2018-05-06,2,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"My first visit to Pinches was on Cinco de Mayo. It was good, but not great like I was expecting based on their reputation around town and as a result would rate my experience at 3.5-4 stars.

First of all, the location isn't the easiest to find. It is part of an urban living shopping center that doesn't have the best parking flow or signage. After driving around the lot for a couple minutes, we found Pinches Tacos' business sign and parked nearby. Walking up to the restaurant is a little nondescript and the front door isn't distinguished as the main entrance. It doesn't have their name on it, the word entrance, or any signage above it; just a sugar skull decal. So we kept walking and ended up awkwardly entering from the patio. 

We were promptly greeted and seated at the bar where the bar staff shared the Cinco specials and quickly served us. I tried their blood orange margarita and Taylor had a beer. The Marg was good, not great, they didn't skimp on the booze but I didn't really feel like it had any blood orange flavor.. or really any special flavors beyond the classic Marg. 

Food was also very good, but still fell a bit short of great in my opinion. I tried two of their tacos- al Pastor and Carnitas, and Taylor ordered chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. The best part of the meal is their homemade tortillas! It is a rare detail to find and makes all the difference in the world. The rice and beans were pretty bland for my taste, but the enchilada sauce was flavorful and an interesting take on the classic red sauce; not quite as spiced as I'm used to but had a rich and luscious texture to bathe every bite of the enchiladas. Again, my tacos were good, not great. I was surprised I preferred the flavors of the Carnitas more than the al Pastor, but I was also pretty disappointed when there was a huge chunk of fat/connective tissue on my small street taco:( When I mentioned it to the server, she didn't really care and just said ""usually they are pretty good about that stuff"". 

The atmosphere is really vibrant and unique. It has a laidback vibe of a taqueria but with full service. The bar opens up to a small patio and features an outdoor bar counter for service. There is also a large area for viewing the kitchen and a fun taco truck installation as a service station. 

Overall, I was pleased with the quick service with a relaxed atmosphere and the food and drinks are satisfactory enough to ensure I'll return, but not with any urgency.",PVB0ggrspa1wWUECI7BN6w,10,4,4,L948XQSEikFXAcnz3x1GGQ

I came in expecting a decent portion size and way better tortillas for the tacos. I ordered the combo plate for the tacos, and a corn on the cob. 
Nothing great about the retried beans and rice that come with the plate. The beans seriously tasted like they were reheated 3-4 times and had no creaminess to them. To each their own with the beans consistency but you get what I mean. 
For my tacos I chose 1 carne, 1 chicken mole, 1 fish. All three of my tortillas for the tacos were almost underdone tasting. I truly understand an authentic flour tortilla press shell, but just something about it was not cooked all the way thru. I have made better carne at home. Nothing seasoned or amazing about it. I expected more of a grill taste to it versus chewy. Chicken mole was nice flavor, but way to much sauce, not enough chicken. And The slaw for the fish taco was just weird. I don't even know how to explain it. The flavor over killed the fish, let alone I couldn't even find the fish.
The corn on the cob was a great street corn. I have no complaints. Whatever corn they use is very juicy and they have all the flavors balanced. 

And now that I have looked at Yelp reviews of other tacos, my boyfriend and I were not offered any sauces for tacos... this is probably another factor as to why I didn't care for the tacos. I like spicy. So I would have liked to added something, or even have a lime to squeeze on top. 

Definitely don't recommend this place if you are looking for ""authentic tacos.""

2144478,2017-02-13,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"To start off with the good, the restaurant's interior is invigorating. They actually have a food cart parked inside of the restaurant that you can order from. They also had a $14 bottomless mimosa deal that almost pulled me in. This place would be a fun vibe for a night out.

Now to the not so good. While we were ordering, we asked a preferential question to our server, to which they responded that they had not been working there long so they didn't know (maybe a menu tasting for your servers wouldn't be such a bad idea). They deferred to the table before who had ordered the Chilaquiles, so we went with that. I would have let this slide, had the following not occurred. 

For the price I was paying, I expected a healthy amount of food. However, when our food arrived, my jaw nearly hit the floor. What I had set in front of me was a small (like, REALLY small) pile of mush-looking Chilaquiles on a tri-section plastic plate. The other two sections were used for the tiny piles of Guacamole and Cream that came with the meal. To make matters worse, a friend at the table had the same dish, but nearly 50% larger of a portion (still would not have been enough to satisfy a normal adult). Taking it a step further, taste was underwhelming and the plate had probably been left to cool for 5-10 minutes. These incidents were not isolated to the Chilaquiles either.

If I'm going to pay $10+ for a child's size portion of food, at least serve on something that doesn't make me feel like I'm in a prison cafeteria.",FFjzmFhuovZTVUbDNqNPgA,1,0,2,JMEag2I-zOpBilXE5B6jxQ
2178487,2016-03-16,5,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"The Skinny:  the fresh corn tortillas were good but the fillings were bland (with the exception of the chicken mole) -  and there is no salsa bar or side of salsa that comes with it. What gives? (2)service is friendly but the kitchen is slow(3) value: for the subpar tacos (with no salsa!) 2.5 star review. 

I have to say,  the decor is pretty awesome. Tucked in the Gramercy complex, the restaurant sports a pseudo food truck with brightly colored painted walls. That being said,  the ambience doesn't make up for the food. (FYI - no diaper changing station in the bathroom).

The hubby really wanted to try their fare on taco Tuesday. Just FYI -  their $2 tacos only apply to their vegetarian, chicken and pork options which are regularly priced at $2.95 or less. 

We tried 5 tacos - the al pastor, adobada, carnitas, chicken mole and the pollo a la parrilla. 

Of the five tacos,  the only one that tasted like much was the chicken mole. For a chicken mole, it would only be okay in my books -  lacking any smokey complexity. As for the rest -  the fillings were  terribly bland and I couldn't really tell which taco was which (they all tasted the same... Bland!). There was literally no heat in the food and the tacos were served bereft of any salsa. (yes... The fillings were topped with some crushed tomatoes which is not salsa. FYI- no salsa bar... What self respecting taco joint has no salsa bar?). The meat depending on the taco was occasionally a bit tough. It was a pity because the corn tortillas were freshly made and pretty tasty. 

The front of the house service is good friendly and prompt. However for a taco joint, the kitchen was rather slow at bringing out the orders.

Overall, not an experience that I feel a need to repeat. With some great hole in the wall joints serving amazing tacos in town, I give this one a pass.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,3,2,0X82nkQM1MxTDvcodlhWag

(We were there at 2 pm on a Friday; they were not busy). I ordered the combination plate of 3 tacos, which comes with rice & beans. I asked for no beans but they brought them anyway. The tacos are just okay. Not bad, but not so good I feel the need to go back.  I had carnitas, chicken, and adobada.

2248958,2016-01-17,3,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"I had no idea that this was the second location for Pinches Tacos in Vegas. Maybe one day go downtown Container Park. Truth everything about this location screams of all the things I enjoy about legit street tacos. Not only talking about the food but the atmosphere plus really nice when you can sit inside not just find plastic bucket sit on or on the curb. The employees are awesome and five stars all around.

Thankful my brother told me about this place for legit street tacos. Otherwise I would have never have found it. The location it off the beaten path (although notice second visit they were putting name on main sign right off russell) cause from Russell Rd no matter direction coming from hidden and since part of office building or Gramercy throws you for loop even more. Once you come around the building find one of the hidden gems in Vegas. 

Both visits all about the tacos. 11 different proteins choose from so there literally is a taco for everyone. So far I have tasted the Pollo Mole, Asada, Lengua, Pescado, and Camaron. Each time got the combination plate (selection of three different ones of your choice) comes with refried beans and rice. The refried beans and rice are awesome. The refried beans the thing stands out of not so much over puree. Still whole beans in it rather then all smooth not fan of that style. The rice was solid. Tacos Lengua had always been my favorite. The Lengua is very very good. Both the Pescado and Camaron they both battered the same. I love it. Add squeeze of fresh lime juice. The most refreshing fish tacos every going get in the desert. Pollo Mole sauce little heavy for me. Mole thing unique taste. I would pass if order it again.  The Asada was solid. The tortilla, toppings, salsa, and everything tasted fresh. I could have eating tacos all day and night if I could. Me there that good only thing want too order. 

They even had all the tradition mexican sodas orange flavor to coke all in glass bottles. Also have other bottle drinks plus cool coke fountain machines that choose from eight different flavor cokes. The personality in this place is awesome. You place order looks like food truck or taco truck in this case. Talk about decor. I love love love it. It has the whole dawn of the dead. The skull bones from artwork on the walls, the pictures above the food truck, even the hanging strings of lights, the tables wooden rustic tables, and cool sign point all different directions. The bar area is small but they do have widescreen for games. Talk about awesome HH one that need come back. Tuesday have $2 tacos HH. Must one Tuesday for me. The weather warmer outside not really patio area but places that can sit down enjoy the food and weather. 

The service is nothing but five stars. I believe one of the owners. It was my first time he explained everything too me clearly, and made me feel welcome first time. He checked see everything was going couple times and leaving thank me for coming in. Everyone came across really friendly, cool vibe, and made whole experience that much better. Second visit the guy remember my face was like back for more tacos. Hell yay man!!!

Taco truck food with a sit down restaurant touch. 

We were greeted immediately when we walked in and everyone was very pleasant. We were struck by the atmosphere right away. Giant taco truck in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by tables and chairs. There is a viewing area where you can watch food being prepared. The music was not annoying. It wasn't to loud and was Some Classic Enrique. 

The food itself. Amazing. We had the Mexican Street corn (in a cup) and it was better than I had expected. Very excellent. 
We had chips with fresh Guacamole and Pico. Also very good.

The food was fresh hot and delicious. This location however cute it is was soo disappointing. My husband is an Executive Chef on the strip and we always test new places with an open mind. To be able to deliver a Togo order proper is a testament to devotion to customers. Pinches failed miserably with the food,the server who helped us was to say the least  condescending and put out to help us. It was 11 am and we were the only people in the restaurant. We ordered 1 carne asada burrito,cheese enchiladas and a bean and cheese burrito...( the bean and cheese burrito was not on the menu) . Enchiladas were cold and the sauce tasted like Ragu. The rice was cold and hard...clearly yesterday's. The bean and cheese had barely any cheese and no sauce at all. It was like eating canned beans. The asada was ok...just kinda meh...And the bill with tip( yes we always tip 20%on Togo)$52.....we were charged $8.50 for a bean burrito. If I ordered a side of beans with a tortilla it would cost less than half. We got no silver no napkins and 2 portion cups of salsa(it was good,but come on 2 small portion cups for $52 of Mexican food).So I'm sad to say we won't be returning.....and we live in Summerlin. We were so excited to have authentic Mexican in our neighborhood. Sticking with Viva Mercado....food is great and most important they want us to return so they don't have to charge $8.50 for some beans!",fSCSgXBkAnZTt5APXsUfnA,0,0,1,EXZLkNj70nJRj0ayS-1DJA

The restaurant smelled like cleaning supplies. It's expected to clean the restaurant when it is slow, but the smell was strong enough to the point where it was bothersome while eating. Maybe don't go all out of the cleaning chemicals when there are two more hours of business left.

A friend and I ordered the carne asada fries while another friend ordered the 3 taco combination plate. Our carne asada fries came out pretty quick and looked appetizing, but didn't meet our expectations. For the price of $11 or $12, the portions are smaller than most of the Mexican restaurants that serve carne asada/ any other meat with fries. With there being a smaller portion size, we were hoping that the meat would be better than the casual Mexican food restaurant. At best, the meat may have been very slightly better.

My friend that got the 3 taco combination plate was displeased. He complained about how the beans were watery and that the tacos were just alright. The amount of money he spent on his meal he said could have gotten him a lot more at other places that had better quality as well.

Although I wasn't a fan of their food, I did like their counter which is a full scale taco truck and their decorations.",1EHzfDx_pZuhWxdc9XoZog,4,0,2,aFtPoxNmDjKGksjj6I2Ymw

Located in the new Grammercy plaza on Russell and the 215, it is not visible from the street. You have to drive to the back of the building. Once inside, the decor is cute and has a Day of the Dead theme meets LA street art. There is a food truck looking counter to order to go, but if you want to eat in, you can just seat yourself. 

SERVICE:
Our waitress (didn't get her name) wasn't super friendly, but she was the only one waiting on ALL of the tables. She looked overwhelmed and I felt her pain as a former food server. I saw that other tables were still waiting for their drinks while we had already received ours. And the two women that came in and ordered to go were waiting over 15 minutes. My BF finally got our server to smile a bit when he paid for the tab and mentioned how busy she was. 

FOOD: 
I don't want to be mean or anything, but I didn't really care for the food. The rice was sooooo bland. Our tacos had liquid dripping from them, which made the tortilla soggy, which in turn made the taco fall apart. There was hardly any meat in the tacos. You could taste more onion and cilantro than anything else. The horchata and Mexican corn were the highlight of the meal. 

I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews. Even if I was in the area, this wouldn't be on my places to eat list. I guess I still have to drive to the north side of town to get decent tacos.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,8,5,2,SBo5AdgUcIU8JZ1rR2LlMA

The meat is delicious, I got the Asada taco plate. The meat was fire and the tortillas are freshly handmade and they were amazing. Needed some lemon, they didn't have a salsa bar or anything so you have to ask. But it's pretty cool place. 

Service was exceptional but not gonna lie this place is pretty pricey. $2.50 for tacos I believe they have $2 taco specials during happy hour but it's not for all tacos, only a couple meats like chicken and such. Asada isn't included in the special nor lengua... It was $4.25 for a lengua taco. 1 TACO!! Lol THATS FREAKING CRAZY!!! 

I got the Asada plate and it was like 10$ or so not bad and my boo got an Asada torta and a lengua taco. He thought the torta was a lil mushy, just not what he's used to I guess. 

We spent like $45 for us 2 for dinner here. Not what we were expecting on getting tacos but it's cool. We're not cheap .. but we are from LA and there's great taco places every where and all of them are like $1 .. lol so when I think of tacos that's what I think of paying. But it's  hard to find good taco places in Vegas that's why you find spots like these that are hella overpriced. They should at least have like taco Tuesday and during their happy hour make all tacos available for the $2 special. Bring in more business instead of pushing it away with the ridiculous prices. It's tacos 

This place is good, but if you want some good tacos for a lot better price go to Tacos El Gordo. It may be a little more hood and not white washed and fancy and boujee but they have good tacos and for a good price. So does La Bonita Supermarkets.",VDsnV9Xc-akVbJC0hVtAQw,0,0,4,CLnLI4HbOSvrsAC-gsj_Og

As a local, I try to avoid going to the strip or the old strip for that matter because of traffic. So imagine my excitement when I learned that they opened a new location in Spring Valley! 

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night (Wednesday). We were immediately greeted by who we later on learned as ""Javier"", one of the Anaya brothers - creator of the awesome Gringos Tacos. He gave us a couple of suggestions from their menu so we decided to get the combo to be able to try almost most of it: Gringos, AlPastor, Asada, Shrimp and Fish Tacos. Everything tasted wonderful! It was so delicious we told everyone we know that they must try this place. 

However their grand opening might not be until mid-November (or so we're told), so if you do decide to swing by, just remember to BYOB.

We were all seated and while waiting for the food to come, we had a plate full of chips, spicy pico de gallo, and fresh guacamole to go with our blood  orange margaritas. A must try!

Taco Tuesday, tacos@$2/piece. We ordered the gringo, mole, Al Pastor, grilled chicken tacos, asada.
It was delicious!!! Each taco  
had distinctive flavors. I love them all but ...
If mole is not one of your favorite Mexican dish, then this may not be your best choice of taco either. The mole sauce was a bit on the thicker side and had deeper, richer texture. I  might skip the mole tacos next time.
The menu is pretty extensive. We went 
for taco Tuesday so we had tacos only.
I can't really say which one is my favorite since we did not order all the tacos on the menu.
If I had to pick among what we had that night, my favorite was the Al pastor tacos ( marinated, slow cooked pork with such amazing  flavor and  the gringo tacos (hard shell , marinated chix light filling with fresh tomatoes and sauce.)

We were a little upset that they didn't serve a blended margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.

The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs. 

I'd visit here again. Hopefully next time it's a little quieter and perhaps they'll invest in a blender so they can blend their margaritas.",tL2pS5UOmN6aAOi3Z-qFGg,1,0,3,qcnhB3Hjk_jcYiCJ4MZ1mQ

THE GOOD:

Carne Asada is off the hook!!  I love that you get good quality beef here.  Cut into chunks so you can taste the meat.  This isn't the poor quality cheap stuff you get at other places.  This is the Real Deal Holyfield.  

I've made my own creation here.  I order the potato & cheese flautas and get 2 orders of carnitas without the tortilla.  i smother the flautas with the carnitas then dig in.  It is so so so so good.  I'm trying to convince Javier to make this a menu item and call it the Uncle Willy.  hahaha.

If you like Enchiladas, you'll love Pinche's Enchiladas.  Their red sauce is amazeballs!!!  After trying the cheese as well as the shrimp, i prefer the cheese.  It is just a better marriage.  I can't explain what makes the sauce so good, but it is definitely the best Enchilada sauce I've ever had.  

Gringo Tacos are... in a word... fan-funky-tastic.  Shredded beef and mozerella in a fried taco shell should not work, but it does.  I'm not sure why it tastes so good, because my brain is telling me this shouldn't work, but it does.  This taco is so good.

Happy Hour at Pinche's is kind of like going to a party at your buddies place.  You know the place well, you go with some friends, but you don't necessarily know everyone there when you walk in.  But by the time you leave, you're friends with everyone.  Exactly how I feel about Pinche's at Happy Hour.  Always making new friends and having a great time.  

The outdoor patio is great for this time of year.  Perfect place to sit and puff a cigar along with your favorite drink.  There is a descent amount of foot traffic, so you can also people watch.  

If you're a fan of Mexican street corn, aka elote, you'll love the offering here at Pinche's.  They do it a little differently than other places.  You get the cotija and chili powder, but you also get some crema

THE BAD:

Only thing negative I can say is the burritos can do with less beans and more meat.  I find that the meat to beans ratio is a bit off here.  But if you like refried beans, you'll love the refried beans at Pinche's.",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,1,1,5,XNaz_lABNCu77W3rJo90lw

First of, parking was really bad, there was no parking when we got there, the layout of the buildings and parking was just off.  So, having to walk quite a distance, expectation level went up quite a bit. 
When we got in the restaurant, ambiance was pretty cool..... Til we ordered.... the cashier, which I'm guessing is the manager or the owner, who was busy on his phone,  had a little girl behind the register, finish the transaction. There was a cook in the kitchen with an earpiece dangling on his ear while preparing food. 
Keep in mind this was our first time here, so we didn't know what to do.. after we ordered and paid, I didn't know what to do, so I had to interrupt him on his phone and ask if I was to find our own seat or to wait by the register, and had to ask how they were going to be able to know which order was which. 
Food quality was terrible, for the price we paid, I expected to have average food, sad to say it was below average. There was no meat in the burrito, rice had crunchy bits, which had been sitting out for quite some time. 
 All in all I will not be coming back to this restaurant and I hope that owners or management can see this and fix their issues.",jZwnu36GtyQHpldVwt6lqA,0,0,1,ttxC1eUSzudvJQeFWkbsgA

Food is delivered to the table identified by the number received at time of ordering. 
Our lunch order consisted of the Taco Combination Plate and a Pinches Bean Burrito with cheese. The combination plate includes any 3 tacos plus, refried beans and tortilla chips. I chose the Adobada (chili marinated pork), Camaron (shrimp) and Pescado (fish). The seafood tacos come with Veracruz  coleslaw on top. The tacos can be ordered with deep fried seafood instead of grilled. I ordered grilled and both were delicious. The chili marinated  pork was tender and had great flavor. The coleslaw provides a nice crunch. The rice is pretty standard. I liked the beans because they are thick, no gravy, perfect for the chips.

Now the food. I ordered the simple veggie burrito that is made with beans, Mexican rice, guacamole, onions and cilantro. I added cheese. 
I can understand when people say it's missing a little flavor but me I like it this way. For me it's always easier to add any kind of salsa or hot sauce than having no choice and have to eat a burning plate that turns your mouth on fire and prevent you to be aware of what you're eating.

My latest trip I ordered the three taco combo plate. I got (1) Gringo Taco, which was on special, (1) Carne Asada Taco and (1) Al Pastor Taco. The Gringo taco was really really good and my favorite of the three. It was shredded beef with chipotle sauce and a crunchy shell. The other two were very delicious as well and were on a soft, handmade corn tortilla. I love that they are handmade and traditional, but they really fall apart on you while eating them. I ordered my combo plate with all beans, no rice. Their beans are good but I think they would benefit from just a little more flavor and salt. 

We ended our meal by sharing the guava flan. We were very excited about this. Unfortunately, it was awful. The sauce was bitter and tasted burned. It may have been an off day for the flan and just a bad batch but it was very disappointing. 

For lunch, for the three taco combo, it was about $13. (you have to pay extra for the carne asada) This is pretty high on my lunch budget and there are a lot of places you can go where you are served for less than that much per person. That is my main issue. But, you can definitely see where your extra dollars are being spent. Fresh ingredients that are handmade.

3397268,2016-03-09,3,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Walking in, I was won over by the funky Dia de los Muerto decor melded with street art feel. Bright, airy and you can watch the ladies and gentlemen rolling fresh tacos in the window! There are several dining areas: their outdoor seating looked charming, dining room has 3 small tables & 2 large tables so it can accommodate large or small groups, there is a bar area & another eat-in area past the indoor taco truck. I thought it was a little confusing at first, do we order at the table, do we order at the truck? Eventually a server stopped by & got us going with Margaritas. I had the Blood Orange, it was good if not overly sweet for me. 

On to the food, the beans and rice were both dry. Rice had a sweet garlic flavor that was subtle and good. Basically, skip the sides & make up for it with lots of tacos.

Tacos:

Al Pastor: 5/5 - tastes like summer, crisp carmelized pork, tomato sauce, plenty of cilantro & spice- a spicy tomato & onion purée was so yummy. The mix of soft corn tortilla with flavorful caramelized meat, crunch from raw onion with lots of cilantro, this was a standout!

Carnitas - 4/5 they were a-ok but def go with pico de gallo, the flavors go together so well!

Gringo Tacos- 3/5 in a crispy taco shell, complete with cheese and crisp fresh lettuce. 
Carnitas, dry. Nice bite of cilantro. First we tried without the sauce and they were a 5/5 for me, then I ordered with the sauce and it just overwhelmingly SWEET, couldn't eat it. so with the sauce 1/5 from me. Would def order again, without sauce.

Camerones - 5/5 tender shrimp, crispy cabbage, just right in sweet and salty, lots of smokey paprika first, spicy little after note. Delish!

Notes for improvements would be, the table we were lucky to get (they were slammed for Taco Tuesday at 5:45pm, note to self!) was awkwardly located too near the line forming at the truck, because the line kept backing up and forming around our table. Kids coloring menus would also be a great offering! It was a cluster on Tuesday at 5:45, but we got a table- people lining up around our table not the best.

Management stopped and chatted with us for a few minutes, that was great! We'll be back again to try some more; glad to have this spot in our neighborhood!",uPCA1BS0LxlTg68BTyEQpg,2,3,3,tX4cC3MjtzQWi4D9HQ-btA

I will say that the staff is very friendly. When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a waiter and he was very informative and nice. Plus the decor is very cool. I was already excited about the food thinking with such friendly staff and cool decor that it couldn't be anything but great. 

The taco al pastor was nothing special. The meat was dry and the corn tortilla was soggy. Next up was my side of Mexican rice and tortilla soup. The rice was okay again nothing special and the tortilla soup was probably the worst I've ever had. I know good real Mexican food and this wasn't it. The soup had a consistency of canned tomato soup and instead of putting fresh avocado slices in it they put a glob of guacamole in it with some cream. It was very weird and tasted like Cholula hot sauce. Oh and there wasn't a single tortilla strip in the entire soup. How is it tortilla soup with no tortillas?? I had a couple spoonfuls and decided I just couldn't eat anymore of it. I went home with a tummy ache and I never ever get tummy aches from food.

My husband wasn't impressed with his food either. The only good thing I can think of regarding the food was the crispy tortilla shell of the gringos tacos. That was good but I didn't like their salsa on the taco itself. 

Plus they didn't bring any silverware or napkins until we asked for them after all our food got to the table. The runner brought the soup out to me without a spoon. They didn't refill our waters during our dining time there and it was also hard to flag them down to get the check.

I wish I enjoyed my meal more than I did, but 2 out of 3 tacos were too dry for me & were a bit bland. Maybe next time I'll ask for flour tortillas instead & add sour cream or guacamole. Hopefully that'll make a difference. The rice & beans were good, but nothing extraordinary about them.

I enjoyed the Lengua taco the most though. The meat was juicy & cooked perfectly. I'd definitely order that again if I go back.

3652555,2018-02-15,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"So, I'm sure other people have had and do have good food here. But that wasn't the case for me today. I have nothing against Pinche's other than their terrible food. It was some of the worst tacos I've ever had and being a former chef on the strip, making good tacos doesn't take much more than fresh product, solid cooking techniques and balance with acid(lime in this case) and salt. I'll just lay out the facts and let you decide for yourselves: 
- Guacamole was salt less and lime less along with being too spicy. 
- The salsa that came with the chips, that I presume was their ""house salsa"" tasted like it had black pepper in it and was also salt less. 
- The Elote was also just ok. The mayo was squirted on rather than brushed on so there were globs of mayo on the plate which is unappetizing. Again, a little lime would go a long way. 
- The adobada taco was absolutely terrible. This is where cooking technique comes in. The pork was so tough and the fat not rendered which made it unable to even chew. Along with the whole taco being dry as their was nothing on it but the meat, onions and cilantro. 
- The pastor taco was the only highlight. And I say that barely. The flavor was good and the meat was tender. It was still dry though as most places add a crema and pineapple to it to add creaminess, sweet, and sour contrast. Again, only meat, onions and cilantro. 
- The fish taco was horrendous. The fish was obviously not fried to order as it was soggy with no crust. The cole slaw on it was blah. Nothing great. 
- The gringo taco was ordered my wife and she liked it. I didn't try it but it isn't hard to make the ""traditional"" American hard shell taco. 

In the end, I will not being going back. When it comes to cooking, mistakes are made sometimes but for Pinche's, everything was a mistake as the lone bright spot was the gringo taco. If that's the only thing that is good that comes from your kitchen, then things need to change. It was their sign outside that made me laugh when leaving, ""Real Mexican Food by Real Mexicans.""

I was a little confused when we walked in because there were 3 girls leaning up against the food truck, chatting and drinking, I thought they were guests who'd just made themselves very comfortable, but no, they were staff! It would have been nice to have been greeted a little more professionally but thankfully one had enough time in between sips to tell us to 'sit wherever'.
Drinks came quickly enough from the bar and for food, we went for the flautas to share and we each had the taco combination which came with 3 tacos, beans, rice and chips. The flautas tasted good, but they were served cold which was a shame. We all had different tacos and all commented that they were OK, very average. Meat a little overdone, not seasoned properly and the kitchen was a little stingy with the amount of shrimp.
The taco combos were also served on a plastic plate with separated sections, kind of like what you'd be given if you were a child, or in prison. A normal plate would have been great.

The staff were friendly enough but I was a little shocked by how 'differently' they do things here. For example, a guy who I thought was a guest passed our table and asked if we were all okay before returning to his table of girlfriends, turns out he worked there. And the lady who served us our bill came over, purse in arm, before returning to chilling with a guy at the bar. Idk if she had clocked out and was doing our main server a favour or what. Very strange and not what I personally appreciate, but if you like casual dining and extremely casual service, then this might be for you!
As for me, I think we'll try something else next time we crave some tacos!",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,2,2,3,zYZyyunn4i-b1GA503wD0Q

I go back there on a Sunday,and I expected the same treatment and pricing as I got the last time I was there. Well no apparently on Sundays it is happy hour after 3pm only so my friend went there before us and was not happy about that.... so we come back after 3 and sit at the bar. I ask about happy hour, I'm told two different things by two people but it was okay bc they where just like $1 difference in there description of happy hour, but they both said shots where on special. So we drink then we get our bill.... we where getting charged $12 for a shot of casamingos blanco! I said excuse me but the last time I was in here for happy hour it was $4 a shot, the guy said oh that's only if our manager/owner was here.... ummm what!!?? I said well I would have have ordered them if I knew the prices tripled when the manager/owner is not here :/ needless to say I will not be referring my friends here or coming back.

3968702,2015-11-30,9,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"This is the second location for Pinches in Las Vegas and is completely different from the one in the downtown Container Park.  It's at the Gramercy just off the 215 at Russell Road.

When you enter, you place your order at a ""food truck"" window.  You're given your drink there unless you're getting soda from one of the many flavors Coke machines.  You're given a table marker and you have a seat while they make your order and then bring it to your table.

There was no one there at 5 PM on this Saturday night and I was able to take in the decor and get some photos of the interior.  It was designed nicely with whimsical wall paintings, faux garbage cans that have paper flowers in the top, and a kitchen in glass with wooden closures like a Mexican food place.

One of the owners took my order and he chatted with me about the decor and explained the Dia de los Muertos style art done of member of the Anaya family.

My meal came--a combo plate with chicken mole taco, adobada taco, and carnitas taco.  I also ordered a Mexican corn.  I asked if they'd hold off on bringing the corn until I could enjoy my tacos.  When I was done with the tacos, I was asked if I was ready for my corn and it was brought to me warm.  This was so much better than getting everything at once and having the corn cool off while eating the rest.  I also got a horchata.

The tacos were good with the chicken mole being my favorite.  I thought the other two were OK. The rice was standard and the chips and refried beans were OK, too.  The corn would have been better if it had more chili powder but I'm sure they use what the average customer would like rather than what I prefer.

Service was great and the friendliness of the staff was exceptional!

If I were rating the place solely on atmosphere, it would be 5 stars all the way.  The interior design was well planned and it's a very inviting place.  I need to come back and try some other tacos and ask for more chili on my corn.  It's easy getting here from where I live.

For those uncertain, exit the 215 at Russell Road and head west.  Halfway from the 215 to Fort Apache, there's a left turn into the Gramercy complex.  Drive a semi-circular path around the back of the building along Russell.  Just keep going past the coffee house.  Shortly after an open space, there's another building and Pinches is in the corner of that building.  You can see the 215 and the signs from the parking area.  On leaving keep going around the semi-circle and you'll be back to Russell very quickly.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,18,12,3,Fe_QPrepG5o878-3JnWkNA

According to the waitress that described the tacos, she stated they were bigger than your normal street tacos. NOPE! Exact same size. My daughter did say they tasted really good, so there's that.

The atmosphere is awesome and the patio is great! Happy hour is excellent. I can't imagine a better way to spend Saturday evening then a scrumptious margarita and tacos al fresco. 

We will definitely return. Again and again I'm sure. The service is warm and friendly. 

The first time we went, there was a kids menu...the second time around the server didn't really know what we were talking about.

We ordered the three taco combo plate to go. We did not ask for any modifications to them or anything to be left off. I also asked for an extra side of pico de gallo and some extra salsa. The girl working the front was obviously VERY new but for some reason was left without help, so this may have been why our order was so screwed up. However it's no excuse as new employees should be supervised until trained....

We made the mistake of not opening the box to check the order before leaving. All three came totally naked - no toppings, just plain. No slaw, no onions, no cilantro, nothing but meat (and nothing but peppers, onions and eggplant on the veggie taco). The veggie taco was also missing the shiitake mushrooms. The only other topping provided was some sad red sauce on the side. It was a mass produced fully liquid sauce that was the saddest excuse for salsa I've ever seen. Roberto's wouldn't even serve something like that. As a last straw, I got no pico at all, on the tacos or as a side, despite paying for extra.

I did like the chicken which was moist but other than that it was just ok. We had ordered to go on a Saturday for lunch and there was no one there. I'm not sure that's a good sign. In fact they brought my food out 5 minutes later and so I left. Only to realize that I only had the burrito that my husband ordered and not my tacos...why they didn't tell me who knows?! So I had to drive back to get my tacos which were on the way to being soggy. 

My husband wasn't impressed with his burrito that was 10 bucks either. He complained there wasn't enough meat for the cost. Overall I thought it was decent but it's definitely not my favorite place to get some tacos!",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,1,0,3,8FWjTtxcf_99Txv7MxcaUQ

Service: it used to be so inviting coming here with the manager always walking by seeing how the food was but on our last visit he was just behind the register and dedicated to a big group by the bar instead. As for everyone else it's whatever, they just bring you your food and that's that. Previously you sat at your table to order now it's done fat burger style by ordering and they'll bring it to your table.

Food: I like the odd meats like tripe and my all time favorite lengua which they have here. The food is pretty good and I recommend getting the taco plate. Nothing mind blowing about the food but it is good.

We were at 5 long tables, long counter and 1 separate table.   Instated of turning 3 other tables, the staff decided to seat other people who had to have our group hover other them.

I ordered food at 6:35pm and at 7:15 after watching other people be served and I asked where our food was.  I was told that it would be out shortly... Next I was asked for our orders again and the server said they are working on it.  At 7:35pm we got our food and another server said, you just ordered at 7:15 so that was quick service, then found out that there computer lost order and so what, you got your food is what I was told.  I spoke to manager Francisco who was just not in the customer service mood and told me, that his sit down restaurant ( and this is not a real sit down restaurant as all food orders are placed at a counter and servers bring food out to you) did serve me quickly and defended the 7:15 pm order placement. That blew up in his face when I showed him my credit card charge at 6:35pm.  His response to me was we that cannot be the right time for your order.

The people here are super duper friendly. You get the feeling that they know everyone that walks in the door. It's like a Cheers for a lot of people apparently. I'm lucky enough to work so close by! I've already been here twice in the past couple days. 

Their vegan options are really good. You can either get Nopal (cactus) or Veggie (sauteed veggies), which have amazing eggplant in it, as the substance in your taco burrito. Rice and beans are delicious as well...and don't get me started on the chips: super crunchy with the perfect amount of salt. 

I would suggest coming here and starting out with a combo plate of a couple different types of tacos to get a taste. Don't forget to check out the specials board!

The atmosphere is awesome. The walls are covered with graffiti, Loteria stuff, and Dio de los muertos stuff. We opted for the ""car seat"" chair in the bar area.

4482346,2018-04-25,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Second (and last) year I had a bunch of people (20-30 people) meet there for my birthday. Last year, it was great. Service was 125% better than I could have imagined or asked for. I was super thankful for what you guys did. 

However, this year wasn't quite the same experience. We were asked to sit outside in the court yard (not on their property) because they didn't have the room because it was ""taco Tuesday"". Cool, I'm more than happy to help out because in the past, I have gotten great service and the weather was nice so it wasn't an unreasonable request. However, I went up to the bar three times and every time I was waiting to order food and drinks, I listened to one (of the three) bartenders we were dealing with complaining rudely about ""the big party in the courtyard"" and using profanity in reference about us (""this is fucking annoying"", ""why can't all these fucking people go away"" are some of the gems I heard).They had no idea why we were there (for my birthday) but they complained openly about us amongst each other right in front of us. Since at least 20 of the 30 people in our party work at the same major strip property in the service industry, we make it a point to be respectful and tip well. I even put all the tables together myself (since it was in the court yard I felt I shouldn't ask anyone to do it for me), because I get that they were busy and I had a large party with me. 

Every single person was a huge fan of the food, but almost all of them complained about the bartenders attitude. It was super off-putting for me. Last year, my bill was about $35 and we tipped close to the same amount (for two people, not the entire party) and this year, my bill was $46 for seven tacos and two drinks. My girlfriend only tipped $7 and I think that was probably $3 too much for the bad attitudes we all received. Like I mentioned, we had anywhere from 25-30 people there and the checks were averaging $20-$30 per two people. So roughly, $375 in food and drinks, and we all heard the constant complaints about us like we weren't standing right in front of the s I was pretty embarrassed I was dead set on having people come there a second year in a row due to how the bar tenders treated us. I'll be super clear about this...we did NOT have any dealings with anyone INSIDE. Only three  female bartenders (one had large gauges if the owners care to read this) outside. 

Anyway, the as mentioned before the food was great and the gringo tacos were as good as ever. I just won't ever order an alcoholic beverage or go to the bar ever again. Next year, I will find a new taco place to have a get together for my birthday because the bartenders made it clear to us that have no interest in helping anyone unless they want one drink and to leave right away. 

Bottom line is, if you are looking to have a group event here, I would steer clear. But if you and one other person are looking for some pretty good food, this wouldn't be a bad option.

I probably won't be back for awhile because I am embarrassed for asking my friends and family to come here, but I love the gringo taco so I know I'll eat there again at some point.

It was like being in a Mexican shrine for Day of the Dead, including skeleton-themed fabric headrests on the booths.  So cool!  As a Mexicophile, I truly appreciated the ambience, as well as the latin music - heavy on the Mexican, but with some Shakira and cumbia thrown in.  I couldn't stop dancing, even before the Riesling I had to go with my meal.  

Our waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu, but he was helped along by Vernesa, who did.  I ordered the taco platter, choosing the chicken mole, marinated pork, and the fish.  Two of the three were winners:  the chicken mole taco was outstanding and the pork was very good.  The fish wasn't.  I could have ordered it grilled, but took Vernesa's suggestion and went with the default - fried.  There was almost no fish in that taco, and the pitiful amount turned out to be breading rather than fish.  The Veracruz coleslaw that was the taco-mate of the fish was tasteless.  I didn't complain about it until I was asked, and I'm very disappointed that not only wasn't it comped, I was still charged the ""seafood surcharge."" Only 50 cents, but I think that if a customer says there was no fish in the fish taco, management shouldn't add insult to injury by charging more.

My husband ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was a picture-perfect, beautiful plate of food, and he enjoyed it.  Our friend had a pork burrito and liked that, too.  We all loved the plate of chips, guac, and fresh pico de gallo we were served at the beginning.  Those chips might be the best I've ever had!

I found the alcohol surprisingly pricey, not across the board, but for some of the offerings.  The bar seems to be a work in progress and opened after the restaurant did.  The bartender brought me a taste of the one Riesling they had, a label I'd never heard of - 14 Hands.  Terrific, and not overpriced.

All of the staff were so friendly that it was a pleasure.  Had it not been for my fish taco experience and, at the end, me being greatly insulted by our waiter in his inept attempt to be friendly (and I'm still upset), this would have been a 5-star review.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,11,8,4,R_fTCR-Y34SA26IrQ90zpQ

SERVICE-The staff is always nice and remember who you are. I even went on my birthday and I received a free cup cake which was delicious. I don't think they give free cup cakes for your birthday....I happened to receive one that day by chance because they had some. 
-They also have great customer service. I ordered to go once and they forgot my churros, I called up and they acknowledged their mistake, apologized and gave me a refund with no hassle.

PARKING-Great amount of parking, never had a issue. 

ATMOSPHERE-They play greatd music and part of the bar opens up to the outside which is nice when the weather is gorgeous. I highly recommend going for their happy hour or on taco Tuesdays for the food or both!!!!

DEALS-Happy Hour. Top items to get are the Gringo Tacos (make sure to use their hot sauce) Mexican Corn, Churros and Micheladas!!!!",OWDbl6g1TTEy_X6wnLp9iQ,0,0,5,PTOn1xx1avPjn4ihAZr5uQ

I am only giving 1 star since the food was alright. Just alright, nothing to brag about, nothing to make us want to go back. We ordered 1 alpastor torta, 1 alpastor taco, 1 shrimp taco, 1 breakfast burrito and mexican corn and still cost $30 after a military discount! 

I asked how big the tacos were, the guy taking our order said ""definitely bigger than street tacos"" .. he even used his hands to describe the size. 
The tacos were very small, like street taco small, like only 2 bites small and were $4 each. The shrimp taco had 1 piece of shrimp chopped up. I can get same quality food from a taco truck for half the price. Not worth it. 

Breakfast burrito was very bland. Tried adding more pico and mexican crema.. nothing! Again, not impressed. I've had a better tasting breakfast burrito from Roberto's for half the price.

The corn had a good taste but was very watery/soupy.

Nothing special. We ordered the taco platter (I ordered the shrimp taco, fish and carne asada) The fish taco fell apart from being too wet (I'm guessing from the salsa they put on) and the carne asada was lackluster.

The quality is top-notch and while I'm not sure if they make the taco shells there, it sure tastes like they do.  They taste freshly made and are a little thicker which is just amazing.

We ordered chips and salsa for the table, it was fine, nothing spectacular. I was probably most excited to try a blood orange margarita, it was pretty good! I tried elote for the first time. I never had it before but had always imagined it really spicy! It wasn't, but I still loved it. I had the carnitas taco and LOVED it! I would def go back for that alone. I'm no Mexican expert, this was basically my first real Mexican experience, but as much as I loved the carnitas, I didn't like the al pastor or asada tacos at all.

What a catchy name, Pinches, LOL. A friend informed me about the Tacos here. Apparently, it's the best tacos you'll ever have. Guess what? Never knew my friend was a carpenter, cause he NAILED IT! 

Quality: 5/5
We had the BEST, YES, the BEST Carnitas, Chicken, Asada and Gringo Tacos in this Universe. It was prepared with fresh hand made Tortillas.

I've never had Tacos with fresh Tortillas before. It was definitely a ""WOW"" factor and I don't get wowed easily by Tacos.  

I also had the corn on the cob, just with butter, none of that other stuff it comes with and that was just as AMAZING.

Customer Service: 5/5
Extraordinary! Superb! Exceptional! Yes, that good. The girls were welcoming, made proper recommendations and accommodating from start to finish.

Price: 5/5
Definitely FIVE STARS if you go before 7:00 p.m. for their happy hours. Now for their regular prices, some may find it a little pricy.  Not to me, because of the quality.  

For example, a Taco can cost you as much as $3.00+.  So if you're use to that $1.25 Tacos, ain't happening here.  But like I said, I don't mind it cause it's top quality.

Cleanliness: 5/5
Immaculate! The whole complex looked fairly new anyway.

Tips:
There's another Pinches in Downtown Las Vegas that is just as good.  Also, caution, the spicy Salsa are pretty HOT, eat at your own risk.  Ok, on my way for a dessert to finish this great beautiful night.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,2,1,5,_tMhdfFE-1govJ_8ARA8nA

Phoned in order (7:55p).. cause I know the food takes a bit from when u order. So I usually call it in...  Fresh made to order is why I come back.

Arrive at 8:05 and no order...3 girls standing up front.  Guy swipes card and takes order..8:18p See ticket pic.  

So I'm waiting for another 15 minutes... when they're done eating cake in back...im asked if I've been helped...oh geez! 

Never put in damn order 830p rolls around and food comes out...no apology... no service recovery from girls...nothing.

2 other people waiting behind me with ordering/food problems as well.  

I didn't see the owner who is usually around cause he is always great to customers and very service oriented...wanted to express my concerns personally

This was my husbands and I first time in and we had been referred here by many family and friends. Pinches is a cute taco spot with a great vibe and delicious food! The tacos are truly amazing but unfortunately I can't say the same for the customer service. 
We came in around 10:10-10:15 the latest on Saturday night (4/7/18) and instantly feel in love and the place had people every where and even had karaoke going on.  We were seated on the other side where it was much more calmer by the front windows towards the right (if you have just walked in the front door) anyways we ended up with chavo -younger gentleman medium built with a large black bread - he was polite but he has the worst customer service. 
He seemed very distracted with the other side where the karaoke and the bar was happening. Now yes there was a good amount of people in pinches but not too the point that we had to be ignored and forgotten. We order for starters chips, salsa and guacamole, 2 taco combos and a Mexican corn off the cob. We received our food in a orderly manner but chavo was too busy with watching the karaoke and forgot about us and our order. He only came back to the table every 15-20 mins if that and after receiving our taco combos and eating about half way through them we still didn't receive our starter. So we did not receive our chips and guacamole and we didn't receive our corn either at this point. After reminding him of both again and after already eating  more than half our taco combos, he only still brings the chips and NO CORN  was every brought out. At this point we were over the situation and finished our meal. 
Again Chavo is no where to be found. It wasn't until i went up to the front where i had to ask him for our bill so we could leave. At the end he got no Tip and when i asked for the manager from another women she stated the manager wouldn't be in until Sunday. So I hope the owner and manager see this and i will be contacting the manager Sunday. Customer service is a 100% must in my book and for the poor service We received tonight has turned us off from pinches and I'm sad to say we will not be returning.

My only complaint is that there really is no service beyond someone bringing your order to your table. No salt and pepper shakers-only packets and plastic eating utensils. When I'm spending $50-$100, I really want a dining experience not a pseudo taco truck experience. I get the concept but I don't care for it.

4868099,2015-11-22,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Location - Southwest off Russell / I-215 ; location is a little secluded which is kinda weird. It's located behind a brand new apartment/condominium complex which looks vacant for the most part. It's not visible while driving down Russell so you're gonna have to turn into the plaza and drive towards the back. Parking is decent. 

Atmosphere - Clean and very vibrant ; huge restaurant with tons of tables and chairs. I was the only one eating , however the location is new so it's probably going to take awhile before potential customers hear about it. Decor has traditional Mexican flair to it, complete with Mexican music. Huge windows all around the wall so there's tons of natural light. 

Service - Quick service type ; you order at the counter and food is brought out to you. My order took 5 mins so no complaints from me. Lady behind the counter was friendly and helpful. 

Food - Decent ; it's not bad but it isn't mind blowing either. I ordered their Torta al Pastor and a drink. Personally, the pastor lacks flavor. It's not horribly bad. I was satisfied with my meal but I wish it could've been better. I guess I'm spoiled by Taco y Taco and Tacos el Gordo's Pastor offerings. On the plus side, their Tortas are huge. I had a stuffed belly after I devoured it. 

Final Thoughts - Food is OK. It's my first time and I can't really judge of a horrible experience because of my first meal. I'll definitely be back and try their Asada or something. It's a good quick place to grab a bite if you're craving Mexican food . Just keep your expectations at bay though .",A872opA-l6OeCy9x1b2QFw,0,0,3,dWGiHtCxmFU16F00z0ULCQ

We did 3 combination plates (3 tacos, rice, beans) at $9.50. The tacos are street style so they are smaller but the combination plate is sure to fill you up. All of the tacos were delicious. They even had a special one that was deep fried so it became a hard shell taco. All of us loved the fluffy rice and chunky beans...they even threw in a couple chips to scoop up the beans. The tortillas are soft and taste homemade. I really appreciated how they wrapped up each sauce in its own container and labeled which taco it belonged on to prevent the tacos from getting soggy. If you don't want to gnaw on a corn cob you can get your elotes in a bowl! 

Great little taco spot. We will be back!

The margaritas they offered were traditional, peach, and blood orange (they don't have them on the menu). They were tasty and didn't skimp on the alcohol since they were happy hour prices. The flautas were delicious! It's the perfect appetizer to go with your first margarita. The tacos were good. I ordered the combo plate with fish, asada, and shrimp. I would've liked some different salsas or a salsa bar to customize our tacos. The Mexican corn is delicious and off the cob is even easier to eat and enjoy if you don't want to get your hands dirty.

My GF and I came here because we heard the chicken flautas were amazing. So we got to sit and it took a bit to get service, but not a big deal. Server comes up and we order peach and blood orange margaritas and start to order. We ask for the flautas and were told their fryer was down, basically half the menu wasn't available. At this point we had already committed, it had been twenty minutes and had our beverages already. I wish they would have said something when we sat down, but they didn't, so that was a big impact on how I rated. We ordered some tacos, I'll say their handmade tortillas are awesome , perfect texture, but the pastor lacked flavor. Their beef cheek was good, and the roasted chick had good flavor but was a bit on the dry side. We've had good experiences with pinches in LA, but this place left us wanting. Maybe they had an off day , so we will give it another go .",qVP2sSbQRjJgmN4Qx9Nkow,1,1,3,htltY4IAW49Ac2cZhUWWdA

My boyfriend lives on the south side so we decided to check this place out after our originally choice had a long wait.. we arrived about thirty minutes before happy hour ended so I went ahead and tried a $4 margarita .. my waitress recommended the blood orange as the crowd please so I went with that one and I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked it that I opted to get two lol which was probably a mistake in hindsight after sitting there trying to finish it with such a full belly .. which brings me to the most important part the food LOL 

We started off with chips and guacamole which is one of the major reasons I can't go all out with a five star rating .. I feel like it was lacking flavor and just didn't do it for me but the chips were pretty good ..


During happy hour they have $2 taco specials so I opted to try as many tacos as I thought I could possibly stomach a bite or two of without going into a food coma ... let's just say I ended up with five tacos on my plate and the only two I could finish were the Gringo and the mole taco.. honestly the Gringo was my favorite (wonder why?) .. It's an off menu hard shell house speciality I definitely recommend it ... I enjoyed the flavor of their mole taco and I felt like the fish taco was really good (fish and shrimp tacos aren't HH specials ) the shrimp taco was too fishy for my taste buds .. maybe I'm a shrimp taco snob tho... My guy gots Carnitas taco and honestly that was the best flavored meat of the tacos I tried from here ... I also tried the cactus taco which again was good but not worth my tummy space ..

My favorite item here was the Elote (Mexican corn on the cob) I requested it off the cob and they brought it out with a spoon , yes only a single spoon .. I can say that was a bit puzzling to me since we were a party of two but hey .. next time I'll make sure to order and make the special request lol

Overall this place is such a fun experience just due to the decor.. I don't know if I will go back unless it's during Happy Hour and I'm on this side of town but for a Mexican experience with a more Americanized feel without being chipotle .. I definitely recommend checking this place out ... especially if you're a nerd like myself who just loves the ambiance and decor..",vwLV4TkRMoghs86tB1Ke8Q,4,2,4,SYroe8vA_noH8Pvbxc1hxw

My first time here I was happy to try half the tacos on the menu and thoroughly enjoyed the meats.  However, some meats like the roasted chicken lacked salt and there's none on the tables.  The salsas that come on the tacos lack flavor.  The green salsa which is made with tomatillos has no kick to it.  Some tortillas ripped as well but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to take for fresh made tortillas.  Do yourself a flavor and avoid the beans and rice.

4990842,2017-08-15,0,4mb32UmQULqg7IMck28vog,"Located in the corner of a plaza is this Mexican foodie gem, Pinches Tacos. I was hungry for a snack on the road and boy was I glad this popped on my Yelp App because I would have not see this place driving by.

Once I enter this restaurant, my eyes were greeted by a nicely rustic and contemporary street decor. The first thing you see if the ""food truck"" located on your right. It's great you can see the cooks at work through the glass wall. The bar is nicely constructed and I love the fence in the middle of the restaurant. This is a big room restaurant, it can fit a lot of people!

I was nicely greeted by a gentleman and somehow convinced myself to sit-down instead of take-out. Happy hour all night... $4 shots, micheladas, margaritas and $2 tacos (select only). I got a shot, michelada, lengua and adobada tacos and my friend got a shot, margarita, pescado and pollo mole tacos. The michelada was nicely spiced, I loved the spices on the rim. Lengua was very well composed, not a lot of bland taste (I've experienced most places to not compliment the lengua too well) which was delicious.
The adobada were so packed with taste, I never thought I'd like that taco as I have never ordered it as where. My friend's fish tacos were delish, crispy and well-complimented with a red cabbage slaw. 

My only complaint is that I do wish the tacos were double wrapped as the juices and sauce cause the taco shell to rip very easily. I found myself using the fork and piecing the taco back together. Not a big deal to the overall experience but definitely something that bothered me a bit!

I'd highly recommend this place and will return soon.

It's not a good as tacos el Gordo though and not as good as the street tacos in la.  However for 2 bucks I thought they were a great deal. Their Guac is delicious!  I thought it was seasoned perfectly. The waitress was also really nice and gave me two corns because she said that they are coming out pretty small. They looked really big to me but when I bit in there was no sweet juicy corn flesh.. It was all dried shrunken corn skin. I don't know if it was sitting out for a while.. Boiled since yesterday..

The food was good. Loved the green salsa on the tacos.

We were a little upset that they didn't serve a frozen margarita, but the ones they did serve were pretty good.

The major negative was how noisy the place was. Part of the reason is they were holding some sort of an event there. The other reason was because there were a couple of kids running around screeching at the top of their lungs.

I ordered the carne asada fries and let me tell you, it was the BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES EVER! I was hooked! Then I decided to order churros with the horchata ice cream on top for dessert. Wow, talk about cherry on top. It was so good and it came with 4 mini churros and the scoop of ice cream in the middle! 

Second and Third time I went with a few friends and ordered the same thing cause I was that OBSESSED! We went for event one time and the place was packed, but you can tell it was family owned that night since the whole family came out to help! It was awesome!

The service was ridiculous.  Very slow, unfamiliar with the menu, and unconcerned for the customer.   The waitress also was too distracted taking shots with bar customers rather than taking our order.

In addition, their fryer was broke so there were many menu items not available.

I consider this place a 'quick service' restaurant minus the quick. I walked in very confused; wasn't sure if I went up to the 'food truck' to place my order or sat down and had a server come to us. The gentlemen, not 100% sure of his role told us to choose any seat and a server would come to us. This guy was the one we placed our drink order with; micheleda and a Bloody Mary. I felt like the process was very delayed in getting drinks but then again there was only one bartender for a Saturday night. Aside from that, the drinks were perfectly made! Our actual server came by and took our order. We placed chips and salsa as our appetizer because let's be real, if a Mexican place failed at a good guacamole and salsa dish then we would be in for a not so good Mexican experience. This place passed! It reminded me of my best friends mother true authentic cooking. Our order was in and was eyeing everything that came by. Mind you, there were only 3 tables at this time. We devoured our entrees and continued to sit at our table with no drinks; water or adult beverage. yet, the server just leaned up against the truck with her colleague and chatted while making direct contact with us and never approaching us with 'is there anything else' we can get for you. 
As a service critic, when a server drops off a dish that you ordered and sees an empty one, they should take it. Well, dishes piled up quick! 
This place does lack service and has a very very laid back vibe so if you're there with no time constraint, it's definitely worth it.

We got two of the taco combos with 5 different kinds of meat - carne asada, beef tongue, fish, shrimp, and roasted chicken. It's really so hard for me to pick a favorite because they're all really delicious in its own way! But if I really have to pick.. I'll say carne asada and the shrimp.

I thought it was a bit strange that one of the workers or owners was sitting at the bar and another was sitting at one of the booths when we came in.  Once we were greeted and served they both went back there.  I guess it  seems a little unprofessional to me.  The decor was unique,  but the chairs uncomfortable.

First impression looked like a food truck inside of a building. Pretty neat idea. The flautas were AMAZING. Overall atmosphere is chill. The servers were attentive and friendly. The only thing that bothered me was the cracks between the tables were filled with some kind of silicone.

I wasn't trying to make a scene or blame somebody, but when I find things in my food that shouldn't be there the first thing I expect is an apology. The service continued to go down the shitter after they figured they weren't getting a  20% tip and after all that I would've at least picked up the customer service as an apology..

The gringo taco was like a stale cheese taco with lettuce and tomato. The only thing I liked was the strawberry Fanta. The service sucked, our server asked for our drink orders then said hold on she'll be right back, a different girl came back 10 mins later and took our entire order. 15 mins later the original server rushed back to take our order and said she forgot about us. All the while I watch another server stand at a table for 10+ minutes chatting it up, leaves for 10 then comes back to chat for another 10 mins. I seriously sat there an hour and watched everyone else get service and I couldn't even get a refill on my drink. Then a different girl comes to our table with a mouth full of food to check on us. When we asked her to split the bill she said she can but we'd have to wait when we said that would be fine she said are you sure cause it'll be like 10minutes or more.

I patronize Pinches for happy hour & T-A-C-O Tuesday ($2 tacos) ;) 

I am always greeted and helped right away. I love the food truck & ""Dia de Muertos"" decor... They even have a live DJ playing old school hip hop. I usually order the roasted chicken tacos, but have to admit the Carne Asada fries are the BOMB! 

The BAR, what can I say...the seats are padded, games are on & drinks are flowing ~~~ I love the blood orange margaritas! 

Great place for a fun friends night out or a family dinner!
