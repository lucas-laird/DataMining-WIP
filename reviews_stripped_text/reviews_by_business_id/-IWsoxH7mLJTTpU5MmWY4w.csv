Kinh Do, if you wanted people to leave in disgust, having a restaurant full of roaches and rodents would be a quicker alternative than having the sorry excuse of a wait staff you have. Your cashier, a stiff and bored looking high school student, wanders aimlessly through the mass of waiting customers, while the managers find it amusing to tell people that tables are ""not available""..and they sure aren't, not with the piles of food scraps and dirty dishes that are begging to be swept away. 

Fast-forward 45 min, and we're finally seated. Fast-forward 30 more minutes, and we're finally given some water in this dry Nevada heat. Oh, did I forget to mention that we grabbed our own napkins and menus after asking half a million times? Yuppers. Another 30 min of twiddling our thumbs and our orders arrive, and surprise surprise! Y'all guessed it. The order comes out wrong. 

I'm usually not one to be sarcastic, but at that moment, it was looking to be prettttty darn funny. And not like ha-ha funny, but I'm-about-to-give-you-a-penny-tip kinda funny.",pu7XUw0XJFwU3grP2OMFlQ,0,0,1,_UroM924kdHCPc2kkVaPsQ

We ordered two dishes to split - 

The Sliced Beef Pho was so aromatic, the thai basil was plentiful and fresh - everything was perfection. I don't think I've ever had broth that clean on the palate and just, well, perfect!

Vermicelli Noodles with Charbroiled Lemon Grass Chicken was just as wonderful as the Pho.

The portions could feed a small army.  We had so much food that we had to take much of our dinner home.

The place used to be so stuffy n cramp that most customers were sweatin n sniffin happily while enjoyin their bowl of hot Pho broth or Bun Rieu. My recent visit to Kinh Do was a big suprise to see the transformation of how hard workiin one can achieved in America. The place has transform into a huge restaurant that can probably accommodate more than 100 people and their menu r much more extensive. It is also nice to see a restaurant that can stood the end of time! Congratulations to u Kinh Do to be another American success story!,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,1,4,X1-lztEvZ0v3KUFzwgUzFQ
136872,2012-03-14,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"We were looking for a quick banh mi sandwich in Las Vegas and Kinh Do seemed to fit the bill.  Our trip was well rewarded.  

In terms of atmosphere, Kinh Do is no different from any other Vietnamese/Chinese strip mall restaurant. The same uninspired decor, seating, and art fills the large room, with the exception of a flat screen television that entranced our two year old daughter.  However, Kinh Do makes up for its lack of atmosphere with excellent service, delicious egg rolls, and great banh mi.

The egg rolls were fresh and delicious.  They were smaller than we have normally seen them but the size worked well.  The rolls were crispier and stayed that way much longer.  And kudos to Kinh Do for serving lettuce and herbs to eat with the egg rolls without us needing to ask.  The egg rolls themselves made the trip to Kinh Do worthwhile.

In addition, we tried the pork terrine, BBQ pork, and chicken banh mi.  While I wasn't that big a fan of the BBQ pork (it was a bit too fatty for me), the vegetables, pate, and bread were excellent.  The pork terrine was great and the chicken was even better.  And at $3.50 a sandwich, you cannot go wrong.

We also tried the Thai iced tea.  It too was very good.  We will definitely visit Kinh Do in the future.  If you are looking for inexpensive, good food, I suggest you do so as well.",DdDl5vOL00TE3wnorz1o-w,0,0,4,YAMOzY_sSlNq5pcs9x6BOg

The bún bò Hu (central Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup) is very savory and tasty with the beef and hocks carefully filleted for you (all the high flavor meat but no bones!).

The egg rolls have already been covered by other Yelpers and they are extraordinary with a light crispy skin and a fluffy stuffing of pork, rice vermicelli, shitake mushroom carrot and pepper that retains it's texture.

All this with very friendly bilingual service( I mean they are all truly fluent in English and are exceedingly nice, both points being in stark contrast  to other Vietnamese restaurants that serve good food.)

I have my fair share of pho restaurants through out California. This place by far was one of the worst food I have ever tasted.

  We split an order of springrolls, a bowl of Satay beef soup, and a Bahn Mi.  The springrolls are not fried,  which I like. They are in a rice wrapper with shrimp, lettuce, rice, and come with 2 dipping sauces. The soup was delicious and very spicy (and I love spicy food).  The Bahn Mi was awesome - it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten.  The roasted pork was so flavorful, and the bread was a great french type baguette.

 The total was about $15 + tip, and there was more than enough food for the 2 of us (we have healthy appetites).  The service was great.  My wife and I wanted to go back for dinner but we had plans for a show so we couldn't.

The innards of the sandwich I think were quite comparable. I want to do a side-by-side, but I will definitely be back at Kinh Do. OTOH, they were really really slow. I think I waited 15-20 minutes for a Banh Mi. But for $3.75 I guess who cares? Also my total was like $4.05, and I paid with a $5, and the woman there gave me $1.95 change. Rungood! But I gave it back, because, you know, karma and all.

847577,2011-06-13,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"When I am sick, the one thing I want is Pho.  I enjoy that it doubles as food and as a steam bath.  So, in a summer-cold-induced delirium, I decided to check out Kinh Do.

I'll admit, I was strung out on Nyquil when I dined at Kinh Do, but I remember it as fantastic.  I ordered the #9 Pho (with brisket and rare steak) and it came with a big helping of fresh bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, and limes.  The broth was really flavorful and, in a first for me, I actually devoured all of the broth.  I usually leave a half-full bowl (to allow for the steaminess).  Um, yes, I will be back for this, sick or not.

We also ordered the egg rolls for the appetizer because they were free if you mentioned Yelp.  I'm not a big egg roll fan but these were amazing despite looking like burned, freezer-aisle rejects.  And, because they are not your typical Panda Express egg rolls, they come with lettuce, jicama, and carrots.  Even if you don't like egg rolls (like me), just get them a shot, you might change you mind.

The one thing I probably won't come back for is the Banh Mi.  It's a fantastic value at $3.00, but the bread is not to my liking.  Way too soft and without that French baguette crunch.  The sandwich (specifically, the mixed meat) also lacked enough cilantro or jicama to hit the spot, but was an overall tasty dish.  I just can't get over the bread though.

I cannnnottt wait to try everything else and enjoy the steamy Pho another day.  Also, my cold started to recede the next day.  Coincidence? Probably, but Kinh do does have some great food. I'll be back.",gq8dZgJConBUANpSFzKKjg,0,0,4,Y7sWVyGTpAVyJWBAEnJmTg

I didn't have high expectations of finding amazing pho in Vegas. However, after a serious night of drinking, my friends and I were desperately in need of pho recovery. I yelped and found the closest location, whcih was Kinh Do.

First we started off with the charbroiled pork spring rolls. The vegis were fresh and the rolls were wrapped tight, which was good. But the charbroiled pork had a weird spam like texture. I didn't dislike it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. They give you two types of peanut sauce, which was pretty great.

Next, I had the pho with sliced beef and tripe. The sliced beef was very fresh and tender. However, the broth was extremeley bland and disappointing. I kept adding sriracha and hoisin sauce, then more basil, just to get some flavor out of my soup.

Since we had a long trip ahead of us, we grabbed some bahn mi sandwiches to-go. The sammiches were pretty great. The bread was fresh and had perfect amount of crunchness on the outside. The jalapenos were pretty spicy and I ended up removing most. For $3, these were definitely the best part of Kinh Do.

There were many other pho places on the map, so i probably wouldn't try this place again.",AW3zx6UclGth5CbcYdtBkA,1,1,3,DC7kae1uAE2cszxBQJ8vOw

I can't finish it all as I have to ask for extra sauce for noodles which is a little bit better. Service seemed like understaffed as there are only 2 people working in the front.

first the good - the vegetables (bean sprouts, basil, etc) were fresh. no complaints here. when they brought these out first, i was quite excited as quality ingredients usually means quality fare.
now the bad - i ordered pho (was tempted to try the BBH, but my stomach was recovering from some crazy vegas partying and needed something lighter). i believe it was the #5, with everything. the portion was decent sized. the broth, however, lacked depth. it wasn't bad, per se, but just lacked any complexity. i usually eat my pho plain for about a quarter of a bowl before i add in siracha, eat that for a bit, then add in additional condiments. that keeps it fresh and it's like i'm having 3 different flavored bowls of noodles in one sitting. this time, i couldn't take more than a few spoonfuls of plain broth before i was thoroughly bored with it. just does not compare to san jose pho.",i2B6LFJ6sJGq03ooznvu8A,0,0,3,W7F95wLzMUVGtO8CppSE_Q

First off it doesn't look like much from the outside but when you go into the restaurant it is very clean. We were immediately seated and handed menus. I knew what I wanted already as did my mom but when you take a picky 14 yr old with you, looking over the menu could take days!!!! 

We weren't rushed to order at all. My son finally decided what he wanted. We order the egg rolls, rare steak pho, chicken pho, and shrimp fried rice. The egg rolls came out quickly and were so hot and fresh. The condiments they bring with them were all fresh, cool and delicious. I like how they bring the dipping sauce in individual bowls so everyone has their own.

A few moments later our entrees came out. A big bowl of pho is just what the dr ordered!! The bean sprouts, limes, basil, and jalapeños were super fresh! My rare steak pho had the best flavor and noodle overload which I appreciate because a lot of places tend to not give you a bunch of noodles!! My son loved his shrimp fried rice and my mom said her chicken pho was the best she has ever had!

I hardly eat on the Strip and venture to Chinatown for cheap eats. So glad we found a decent Vietnamese place. Pho is seasoned well. Only complaint is how thick they cut their meat- it was hard to bite.

Also tried the bun bo hue which was very good. Had lots of lemongrass flavors. I was missing my pork leg, which is the star of this soup, so I waved down the server. She said they ran out so just added more of the other meats in there. Disappointed with that. Again-- meat was sliced really thick here too.

Checked in and got the complimentary egg rolls, which were amazing- on par to the egg rolls my mother makes, which is a huge since I was starting to think my mother made the best I would ever have. 

We both had the #5 pho, which is the typical ""special"" pho dish served up everywhere; it had tripe, brisket, rare steak, beef meatballs (which were especially good here), narrow cut rice noodles in a phenomenal beef broth. It was really great. Definitely as good as (if not BETTER) than Pho Bosa, and the amazing egg rolls (better than PB) are what put it over the top.

After having eaten there, I must say that the name is probably the best part about the restaurant.  I love pho for the soup - I like my broth meaty, rich, textured, and so flavorful that you can burp it up hours afterwards and still taste it.  The soup here tastes like someone cracked open a can of beef broth (the kind that's on sale at the supermarket for 55 cents), heated it up slightly, and then dunked some noodles in there.  The soup was lukewarm, and tasted like msg water.  Ironically, even though the soup was not hot, the beef was already fully cooked (if not overcooked) when it came out - it was chewy and tasted like it had been cooked hours ago.  The summer rolls were cheaper than some of the other places we've tried in vegas, but they weren't anything special - the skin on the ends was hard and uncooked on one of my rolls.  As a side note, their banh mi looked interesting (lots of different combinations, including some with egg!) and might be worth a try.

As for service...we sat down and were not handed menus.  I eventually ended up grabbing the menus myself after unsuccessfully trying to flag down a waitress.  It also took awhile to order, and the food came fast, but that's probably because they hardly heated up the soup at all.  The one thing I will say is that once we finally got our menus and placed our orders, the waitress was very friendly and had a good attitude.  That being said, I don't really care if I have to serve myself at a pho place as long as the broth is slurpy delicious.

From the previous yelp reviewers this restaurant is pretty clean. I gave this place a 3/5 stars because only one dish was superior over the other.

I order the Hu Tieu Gia Kho  (please see the picture I've uploaded) and it was delicious. Everything was pretty much on par on how'd you make it at home with the exception of the missing crab claw. But nonetheless, the broth served on the side was light and herbaceous. The contents of my noodle bowl was perfectly dressed with sauce and with the appropriate meats and herbs. 

In a lot of Vietnamese Restaurants these days, they usually just serve the same herbs for your noodle dish that they serve with Pho, and that is usually Thai basil, bean sprouts, jalapenos and lemon/lime wedges, but to see a Vietnamese restaurant to actually serve the correct herbs that go with the noodle dish made me impressed and even happy that they took the extra time and made it right. ... especially for 2 people at 10 in the morning, with nobody around.

The tapioca noodles were perfectly cooked, the liver slices was slightly dry, shrimp was not rubbery at all and served larger size shrimp. Ground pork was marinated well, even though it was missing the BBQ pork marinated, I'll let it slide because it was that good. 

Add a dash of white pepper, and spoon in a couple spoonfuls of the broth in the noodle dish and it was tasty.",rqv6iQJtu2Y8mNqbQF2wYw,1,1,3,e7PKbrxgyGgw0ouueFZSrA

The Pho soup was on the sweet side but noticed that pho in most vietnamese restaurants in vegas are somehow on the sweeter side compared to southern cali. In terms of the stuff inside, the tripes didn't taste fresh and seem as if they just defrosted it rather than a proper hot water rinse through.

For the bun bo hue if you love lots of flavor and spices, you will love this one. Comparing to many bun bo hue i have had though, this has a bit too much spices. Instead of just chili oil, they added load of chili flakes to it. A bit too spicy for this dish in my opinion and too much lemongrass in it which all together it overpowers the originality of the soups base flavor. Again, if you love loads of flavors, this is for you. 

Overall, one thing i love about both dishes is the noodles. Wasn't too soggy and has a bit of el dante texture which i love my noodles to be.

Another i was told that the offer only applies to dine-in customers. They were more like spring rolls that have been deep fried and contain mostly fillers anyway.

I've never actually sat down and eaten here before. All the times i have is due to it being the closest to the Leatherneck bar and within the price range of what i want to spend on dinner. 

They have a sign promoting the Hu Tieu Nam Vang which somewhere in my childhood i've developed a liking to and it stuck throughout adult hood. This is actually a Cambodian dish that was adopted into Vietnamese cuisine, Nam Vang is the Vietnamese term for Phnom Penh. Another very similar dish is Hu Tieu My Tho which is My Tho style noodles.

Anyway back on topic here. I went in the first time to grab the HTNV and got it to go. In the typical to go fashion everything was separate so you can put it together yourself once you got to your destination. Normally i order my noodles dry with soup on the side (lets see you do that with ramen) just because the flavor of the noodles doesnt get diluted by the soup, mainly because the soups are so full of MSG you'll be thirsty and light headed after chugging the entire bowl. 

Everything was just 'okay'. There wasnt much of a wow factor, no i take that back. The wow factor is in how much MSG is in the soup and the amount of herbs and vegetables is given to one simple to go order. There was even jalapenos, picked radish and carrots you'd normally find in sandwich orders but are kinda outta place here. I received enough basil to garnish about two bowls of Pho as well.

Second time grabbed a broken rice. Again nothing stood out and there was no wow factor.

I wouldnt recommend this place because there's just no great care in the food. Depending on your taste buds, some things are noticeably fresh while others are frozen and thawed out to order.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,1,2,3,lHg8QpHyh1OGcDa3AYWy7A

Bun bo hue - 4.5 stars. Little on the sweet side but still the best I have had in Las Vegas so far.

Combo Pho - 4 stars. Pretty good all around

Hu tieu - 3 stars. I prefer the clear noodles. They use the same as the pho noodles which makes the dish taste off. No option on clear noodles.

Banh mi dac biet - 4.5 stars. Near perfect. Not enough Cilantro and picked Carrots and Daikon 

Banh mi thit noung - 4.5 stars. Also near perfect. The marinade for the meat was a bit sweet.

Spring rolls - 4 stars. Good dipping sauce. I prefer lettuce head instead of the lettuce leaves and some mint in mine.

We ordered egg rolls for the table to wait out when our friends would show up.  I don't know why egg rolls would take 20 minutes to make, but the table next to us, which came 5-10 minutes AFTER we did, got their egg rolls before us.  How the hell does that work?

I was getting so impatient, we just ordered the pho, and again, slow AF.  Vietnamese restaurants usually have bad service but slow food, they do not.  So I was starting to lose my patience with this place by the time we got our food.  It even took a million years to get our check.  The dinosaurs had died by then. 

Are the egg rolls good?  Yes.  Is the pho good?  Like any other pho place really.  Is it worth the wait.  Pho no!

Lots of meat. Four pieces of tendon! Four! Noodles were thinner than I was used to, and I expected them to be too soft and overcooked. Nope! Chewy yet soft, perfectly cooked. Even towards the end, it didn't get too soft. Tripe sliced super thin too.

Bun bo hue $9.95
Two decent pieces of pork hock, cooked to literally falling apart tender. The pork blood cubes were a little too gritty for me tho. Noodles were fat and chewy, again cooked perfectly. Broth was not too oily and a little lacking in the spice department but still very good.

Banh mi dac biet $3.50
I really liked the mayo they used. A bit of tang. The bread looks really thick but it's very soft and does not cut up the roof of your mouth! That is a constant problem for me.

Egg rolls, 2 free with Yelp check in!
Not only do you get the egg rolls, you also get 4 big leafy pieces of lettuce, mint sprigs, daikon/carrot mix, and cucumber slices. Nice!

Having said that, this is the best pho I have ever had. The broth was delicious on its own - I enjoyed the taste before I even put any spices or sauces into it. I have never had that kind of pho experience before. Also, the ingredients inside the pho as well as the regular limes and sprouts and basil leaves that were brought to the table were FRESH. And I mean, I could tell they were quality ingredients. Large, juicy limes and fresh sliced jalapenos: yum. That makes a noticeable difference in my eyes and these minor differences in ingredients is likely the reason why their pho was bursting with flavors and very easy to enjoy. 

I ordered meat ball pho. My girlfriend had chicken. I didn't particularly enjoy the flavor or consistency of the meat balls. However, to their defense, I have never ordered this type of meat in my pho. I usually stick with rare beef or chicken. So, I will give them the benefit of the fact that perhaps I just don't enjoy that type of meat overall. 

The service was also the best I've had at any pho establishment in Vegas. We were the only table there, which struck me as odd for a Saturday night, but the gentleman serving us was attentive, took our order quickly, and even checked on us a few times. 

OH! Almost forgot! We also ordered spring rolls: very tasty! This was the first time I have ever had vietnamese style spring rolls, and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't realize they weren't going to be hot, so that threw me off a little bit! The peanut dipping sauce was delicious!!

Following the recomendation first review I read, by Carly N, I ordered Bun Rieu. I'm not Vietnamese, so I can't claim nostalgia for homemade Vietnamese food, but when I think Vegas and I think morning-after meals, I definitely feel a tinge of bitersweet longing for Kinh Do. This is the answer to all your woes.

BUN RIEU - I have no native standards to go by, but wow this is an amazing bowl of noodle soup. If you like seafood and noodles and flavor and generous helpings of everything, order bun rieu.
EGG ROLLS - some of the best Vietnamese egg rolls I've had, even if they weren't free. Delectably savory filling wrapped in deep fried crispy layers.  I really appreciate the plate of greens and pickles that came with. Definitely dipped some of that lettuce in my soup, because there is an unfortunate dearth of fresh produce in Sin City menus that leaves me dreaming of salad.
BUN BO HUE - decent. Hearty herby spicy and satisfying, but doesn't stand out.
PHO - broth is solid. At some point, pho is pho is pho and Kinh Do does pretty good pho.
PHO GA - meh. Not impressed.
VIETNAMESE ICED COFFEE - nothing special; the coffee is a tad weak for my taste. But when it's 100 degrees out and you're hungover af, cold creamy coffee + a steaming bowl of noodle soup works something magical.",Mr0yjbRwb5itrYaIWlmgOw,2,1,4,464KXHXLF385aVhTcMArMw

Agree or Disagree I always seem to feel like an outcast when I go by myself anywhere in Chinatown, and often get a feeling like ""why are you here?""

2619283,2014-08-11,9,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"(TL;DR:
- Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup) - Good (meats are not that great, but the broth (a little on the oily side) will satisfy)

- Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab and tomato noodle soup) - Terrible (very watery and the crab was weak and straight from the can)

- Nem Nuong Cuon (Pork Patty Spring Rolls) they're alright, not amazing, just average. The rice paper wrapper was pretty dense and chewy, plus there's no crispy eggroll inside, but the sauce and the (dry)meat had good flavor)


Thorough version: 
Kinh Do saved my life a few nights ago. I was feeling all of the sickly icky cold symptoms: body aches, stuffy nose/ runny nose, sneeze attacks, & utter contamination. The only thing that could get me out of bed was the thought of hot and comforting noodle soup - 

Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup) - It came out just as I dreamed, scalding hot! It was a huge portion - lots of noodles, brisket cuts, ham hock, coagulated pig blood (don't be scuuured), pretty much all of the typical fixin's. The meats weren't the best, they were dry and sad. The ham hock was all fat and no real meat bits, and the pig blood tasted frozen; but the broth was super hot, flavorful, and had a nice slight spicy kick to it (don't worry, it's not that spicy.) I also requested extra chili garlic sate sauce on the side to add to the soup and it definitely turned up the spice and the flavors quite nicely. I'd recommend trying that if you enjoy bold flavors and spices like I do. Also make sure to add the plate of veggies (bean sprouts, cabbage mix, herbs, lime/lemon), it really helps add great crisp texture and brightens the flavors. (Disclaimer: this might be the best place to get bun bo hue in Vegas, but it's definitely not as good as CA or homemade.) Flavor Rating: 4/5

My boyfriend ordered the Bun Rieu (Vietnamese crab and tomato noodle soup) - It was so watery! It seriously tasted like boiled water and a tomato tossed in it. There was no real layering of flavor that we're used to. Also, they barely gave us any crab - the mixture was straight from a can and the fried tofu was dried out and rock hard. Did we come on the wrong day or what? Coming from a Vietnamese chick - I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish here, it's really a disgrace to the real bun rieu. Flavor Rating: 1/5

We also tried the nem nuong cuon. They were alright, the meat was a little dry but I liked the flavor and also the dipping sauce was tasty. My issue was the spring roll wrapper was dense and chewy, I spit out a lot of the wrapper towards the end of the roll. Flavor Rating: 3/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,10,8,4,FwivbCd8aFwPnPWCQaAVIg

As everyone knows it's been deathly chilly outside so we wanted some nice hot soup to warm us up! 
As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by a woman, and she told us where to sit. She offered us hot tea in which we gladly accepted and gave us our menus. 
There were a few people in the restaurant, wasn't too packed.
After a couple minutes a friendly man came and took our orders.
I ordered the #1 pho combo which was like $7, the bf ordered #3 which was like $6, and also we ordered some spring rolls which were $3. 
Our orders came out quick and I noticed that the spring rolls were freshly made! It was delicious, and the peanut sauce was good as well. Not as thick as the usual sauce I've eaten before but good enough. 
The pho bowls were huge  My boyfriend who ordered the #3 was quite surprised at how big his bowl was considering its price. 
The soup was delicious and warmed me up, the meat was scrumptious and the noodles were perfect. Not one strand was soggy! 

The man who took our orders was great, he was very friendly, always checking up on us and other customers asking how we were doing.

We started off with the eggrolls (free from Yelp) and the shrimp and pork spring rolls. The eggrolls were small and tasted alright; there was nothing very special about them since I've had dozens of eggrolls in my day. However, I do like the plate of goodies (lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, fish sauce) that it comes with it to make a fancy eggroll. I liked the extreme porky flavor in the spring rolls which makes them better than most. 

Our family ordered two bowls of the pho with everything in it along with the mixed meat bahn mi. The pho was a bit disappointing because although I do order the special pho with all the crazy organ stuff, most places still give brisket and steak the priority of my bowl. These bowls however had only one complete meatball and way too much chewy cartilage. Everything else was great, but for me, quality meats should be the star in my pho bowl. 

Now, my favorite part of dinner was the bahn mi. The mayonnaise was extra tasty and my teeth sunk through all of the delicious layers of meat and pate. The bread had a perfectly crispy exterior and a soft interior. Overall, I will probably come back for some bahn mis but nothing else.",EKEtbkIswDNQqxcy8vy8Kw,2,0,3,BTTusLD63E1ELWuRwyQajg

All I can say is I don't get it.  Pho Annie, a hole-in-the-wall in my area is so much better.  The few items that we ordered all missed the mark. Sniff.

The spring rolls with pork sausage did not taste freshly made, like it had sat out in a refrigerator for a while.  The only thing that could have saved it was the peanut dipping sauce, which unfortunately was a watered down disappointment.  My husband's BBQ plate was also a dried out mess - from the rice to the pork to the egg and powdery pork skin.  Where is the warm tender greasy savory goodness I am used to in Asian plates? And to top it all off, my beef combination pho was missing beef balls, the meat was very tough (definitely no rare slices went into it) and the broth, though tasty, was forgettable.

For me this evening consisted of a bowl of chicken pho and a side of shrimp spring rolls swimming in peanut sauce spiked with a heavy dose of Sriracha.

+Got to Kinh Do at 10:30 AM on Saturday and the restaurant was already packed. The crowd mostly consisted of Asians and I knew it was going to be good right away!
+The waitress was very nice and smiley. Thumbs up for the good vibe.
+Most of my friends liked their pho. Kinh Do's pho soup has hint of sweetness to it and it's nothing bad--I'm just not used to it but it was good overall.
+My friend said Kinh Do uses pretty good quality meat. She said the meat in her pho tai wasn't too chewy or tough.
+I liked my bun bo hue! Wasn't the best but pretty flavorful and tastier than most bbh I've eaten. I thought the noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth wasn't too oily.
+I took a bite of my friend's bbq pork rice dish and it was so bombbb. I would order that next time.

-My boyfriend's only complaint on Pho Dac Biet was that there were only 3 thin slices of sliced beef. (We knew it was only three because he always asks his meat on the side).
-I believe there was only one main waitress handling all the table. There's another guy that comes out of the kitchen occasionally to bring out some food or handle the cash register but other than that the waitress was man-handling everything. I felt so bad for her because she was so busy. Not her fault but obviously her attentiveness went downhill after she got swamped.
-The pho noodles were kinda under cooked in my opinion.

The place looks like most Vietnamese pho restaurants: lots of tables, Asian portraits on the wall, lucky bamboo decorating the restaurant, with a clean bathroom. Typical expectations.

-- PHO --
I've eaten pho most of my life and can tell what's good and bad at this point. If they get the base broth right, there's hardly a need to add additional sauces and enhancements to it. The pho here had a good base, and I barely added any other sauces to it. I ordered a large and ate every noodle.

-- SUMMARY --
I give the pho four stars. The service was sufficient; the staff was friendly enough and they refilled water as necessary. It was a nice casual night out with tasty pho and spending quality time with my family away from home. Recommended.",0mZWG5_4RKU6UCHgI4GNbg,0,0,4,265S54tUt4wCKCO6ejRNlg

The food was great! The bowls were fraking huge and the broth and chicken were mighty tasty! I think mine was 7.99 or something very close to that and it was well worth it.

Here, we waited a good 10 minutes before our order was taken, then another 5 to get water, then maybe 20-30 just to get our food. I understand there were 8 of us, but it still shouldn't take that long. Maybe the workers were all just too busy watching the Wold Cup final game.

I got a Com Thit Nuong (Grilled BBQ pork With Rice - $7.95). Broken rice was great, but the pork did not impress. Thin, dried out pieces. I've had better elsewhere.

No one came to take my order for what felt like 30 minutes, although I'd guess it was more like 10. I finally scooped up an order of rare steak and well done brisket pho along with an iced tea and an order of spring rolls ($12 total). 

About 5 min later, everything came out. Iced tea was standard. Spring roll was good and the pho....the ____ing pho....was phenomenal. The brisket wasn't fatty, the rare beef didn't taste like concrete and the broth was the best pho broth I've ever had. I was full early on and just kept having one more spoonful...then another...then another...then I was sweating...then I ate more...then there was none left...then I was sad. Compounding the sadness was the fact that no waiter had stopped by for another 10 minutes, so I had to stare into my empty bowl (the alternative of Fox News wasn't any better). I eventually just got up and went to the register. 

I'm 4-starring this for now, but I have a feeling it will be bumped up to a 5 soon enough. Why? Only the finest in pho will get a 5-star rating from me and I have a lot more searching to do! Also, bleh to the service. Blehh.

This is my go to first stop every time I hit up Las Vegas! I'm going to call this town LAS VEGAS and not Vegas. I'm sure the locals can appreciate that :). It's a lot like calling San Francisco by  ""Frisco"" nobody in San Francisco calls it that. Only people that are FOBs or from NYC call it Frisco. Get it right. Frisco is a town in Texas and besides it just sounds dirty (not texas- the name). I'm gonna Frisco you. That will be my new song starting R Kelly and Jodeci.

ANYWAYS! Las Vegas is like my second home. So many good and bad memories. She is like the one that got away and the crazy ex. So, here is my advise to you. EAT PHO! The Pho in California is way better, but that shouldn't stop you from visiting here when you are in town. The crazy casinos and vendors trying to suck your wallet dry is just too much! You need to ground yourself for a peaceful and affordable meal in Chinatown before you start your personal version of HANGOVER 3. 

I have watched as this restaurant went from a small whatever restaurant to becoming the clean and great customer service restaurant it is today. Before it had bad service and was dirty. I didn't know what door to enter from. I didn't know who was working and who were customers. The store was either blasting Vietnamese fashion rock videos? Or some other high techno trance music. Those days are over for the better. Now the restaurant is grown up, matured, and went to college got a degree and now wears a suit and tie doesn't charge the ivy school pricing. 

PROS:
-Pho soup is hardy.
-One size only, but it's large.
-Menu has a lot of variety from Banh Mi to Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef blood soup). I want to try both of those, but I end up ordering pho every time.
-Service is great and attentive.
-Ice coffee good :)
-Spring Rolls are packed with Shrimp
-Clean

CONS:
-Directions. The location is hidden near a few massage places and a gun range. The best advise so you don't pass this location. When heading west on Mountain Spring Road look for the Kinh Do sign on the right side. Turn right away before you get to the Arco gas station (opposite side from Wells Fargo). I still miss the turn every time.
-MSG :(. Man I'm thirsty.

For my peeps driving from So Cal, this place will not impress you pho wise, but the Las Vegas strip is freaking expensive so eat something good that won't break the bank. I recommend this place for locals, because it's still a great place to go, no annoying tourist here. On my recent visit to Las Vegas, I went here for lunch on day one and for lunch on my final day.

Pros- 
#1.Cheap and tasty Chicken Banh Mi. It's all about the delicious bread. I have to give them credit for that.  

Cons- 
#1. Really bad service. The waitress could not understand slow and perfectly spoken English to the point she was rude and short with us. Not cool considering we eat Pho regularly and know how to order right from the menu. Maybe it was my blonde hair and blue eyes or my friend's biceps that caught her off guard. Either way I felt discriminated against. Not a good feeling. 

#2. The Pho broth- Well if you are a fan of mop water than you might want to move this to Pros. The broth tasted dirty and just off which are usually a sign of a dirty kitchen.....

#3. The meat in the Pho- Where's the beef? There were 3 pieces of beef. Nuff said. 

#4. Our order came out REALLY wrong. We both ordered Pho Tai and one of us was the lucky recipient of tripe. Big surprise at this point. 

Summary- As the great C. Barkley would say,"" That's turrible"" . Since there are so many other Vietnamese restaurants on point in the same vicinity I will not be returning unless I suddenly get a craving for mop water.

3216427,2012-07-30,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Sigh, I really try not to give negative reviews but I was really really disappointed with this one.  I came to Kinh Do with no expectations except what I read from fellow yelpers.  I mean 4 stars with 163 reviews can't be wrong right?  Nope.  Here we go...

On a recent trip to Vegas a buddy and I had a craving for bun bo hue (Vietnamese beef soup noodles) and so we turned to Yelp for suggestions.  We saw Kinh Do and decided to give it a shot.  

The restaurant itself if fairly large.  It had anywhere between 25-30 tables of various sizes and there were about 15 tables filled at the time.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  I didn't notice initially but there were only 5 people working at the time (Owner, 1 waiter, 1 bus boy, 1 girl that was working the cash register and 1 young girl that I think was the owners daughter).  We knew what we wanted and we saw a check-in offer on Yelp for two free egg rolls so we decided to do the two bowls of noodles, the shrimp spring rolls and the free fried egg rolls.  

With our minds made up we proceeded to call someone over to take our orders.  I raised my hand at the owner to indicate that I was ready to order and he looked away.  Ok, maybe he didn't know what I was doing.  5 minutes pass.  I raise my hand again and I waive at him again.  He looks at me, acknowledges me and points to his waiter.  The 1 waiter that was working was really busy running back and forth from the kitchen and really busy passing out food to the other patrons all while the owner was just walking around.  

5 more minutes pass and I still haven't ordered.  This time a middle eastern man walked in and was seated at a large table next to us.  The owner hands him a menu and a few minutes later the owner was back to take his order.  Wow right?  What did I do to deserve such bad service?  

A few more minutes pass and I finally get to order.  I asked for the beef soup and the waiter told me they were sold out...It was 11:30am and they open at 10am.  How is this possible?  Disappointed but not really giving it much though I opted for the special combination Pho noodles instead.  Now thinking back, they probably didn't make it for the day because that soup base takes some time to make but that's just my speculation.  

When the food finally came out they brought two bowls of noodles and the spring rolls.  There were no vegetables for the noodles and no dipping sauce for the spring rolls.  The soup itself was luke warm at best and the flavor was OK.  Nothing spectacular.  Thinking they would bring everything else I had out soon after, I watched them bring out vegetables and other dishes for other patrons table after table and here we are sitting there waiting again.  

We couldn't take it anymore and we left.  I have no idea what I did to deserve such horrible service from the owner of the restaurant and needless to say my experience deserved a letter grade of an ""F-"".  The owner needs to realize that either he staffs his restaurant with enough people to support the size of his restaurant or he needs to pitch and help when it's busy.",LkMI6T1KaGYfyMhLVp8XLw,4,0,1,9dodX-_Uc-pGmTtHFbIerA

Service was quick, friendly and efficient. Our meals arrived with 5 minutes of being placed which made me think, can rushing a good thing comprise quality. At Kinh Do, no way! Hot fresh and ready to chow!

Bun Bo Hue - deep rich brother with a nice amount of dark red annatto oil over the top. The meats were incredibly tender with a nice amount of fat to add to the richness. There were a few pieces of blood cake which taste like liver and pennies. The killer  broth and the thick noodles satiated my iVw in no time. 

Banh Mi - Vietnamese BBQ Pork. The issue with the banh mi wasn't with the tasty ample meats and veggies but with the bread which was dry and crumbly. A good banh mi is only as good as the bread its in. A great use for the bread was dunking it into the bun bo hue. So good! Like a Vietnamese French dip!

 The restaurant is in the corner of the plaza towards the street on Spring Mountain across from Tea Station. The parking lot was a bit crowded when I went there due to the Chinese restaurant next door having a party, but other than that there was a few spots still open. I recommend to avoid parking under the billboard or else your car will be attacked by bird's droppings. Inside the restaurant it is very spacious with yellow and red walls. The restaurant had a few other customers there so the noise level was not too loud. The waiter greeted me kindly when I went in and sat me down right away. The menu has a pretty good variety of food from egg rolls to noodles and rice, but had the same food any other pho restaurant in town has.

FOOD:
 I ordered the Pho Dac Biet which was really hot when it came out. The pho had a mild savory and beefy smell. The noodles was a bit too firm, but it was not bunched together. The meat was very soft and tender, but at times tough too. The meatball looked a bit dry on the part that was sticking above the soup. The soup was brown and made the beef eye round stand out. The onions was a bit mushy but still had a small crunch to it. Overall, the pho's flavor had a little salty taste (this threw off the balance a bit) and a strong meaty scent but it did not contain any msg.

The customer service here is amazing. Our server accommodated to all of my party's needs, whether it was to personalize an order or to split checks. I loved how he always said ""you got it"" in response to our request. 
On top of the great service, the Thai iced tea here is delicious! It's not too strong, too sweet or too creamy. It was just right on this hot summers night. 
I am vegetarian and could not find any veggie pho. However, our server happily agreed to my request of pho with veggies.

Additionally (seriously, the positive things just don't end), my party of 10 people stayed 30 minutes after the restaurant closed to finish our food. Even though it was after hours, when my boyfriend asked for a banh mi sandwich to go, they did not turn us down even when the kitchen is supposed to be closed.

We quickly notified the manager and he was truly apologetic.  I do think it's an isolated incident but it needs to be noted because this pretty much ruined my appetite.  The manager comped us the entire meal.

Gold medal - Extra Hot soup
Silver medal -  Good portions
Bronze medal -  Yummy Bun Bo Hue

I saw some other peoples Yelp reviews raving that this is the BEST Pho in Las Vegas, so I had to give it a try.  The verdict is that those reviews are way overrating, but at least I did not find any coach roaches in my soup, like one of the Yelp tips. Yikes!!  

The soup came out super HOT.  The portions were good.  Prices were decent.  The Pho was so so.  The Bun Bo Hue here however was one of the best that I have had.  

Now the negative.  I went yesterday on a Sunday.  I waited for about 25 minutes to get a table.  Then I waited another 30 minutes from the time that I sat down till the time that the Pho came out.  And yes I am serious!  This is by far the slowesssst Pho restaurant ever.  I would not come back here for the Pho, but I would come back for the Bun Bo Hue.  They also did not have fresh coconut juice at this Vietnamese restaurant or ANY coconut juice even the frozen juice here.  I thought all Pho restaurants have coconut juice??  I guess not.

I ordered their pho tai with raw beef on the side, spring rolls, com tam bi cha suon nuong (broken rice with grilled pork chop), and bun thit nuong (grilled beef with rice vermicelli and vegetable). We also received two free egg rolls for ""Checking In"" at their restaurant. The pho lived up to its top ranking, the broth was very flavorful, but they were a little skimpy on the noodles, IMO. My wife's bun also did not have enough vermicelli in it and their fish sauce wasn't as strong as some of the other restaurants in town, but not bad. The spring rolls were delicious and very fresh as was their egg rolls. The pork chop with the broken rice dish was just okay. The eggs that were in this dish was quite good, but the pork chop needed more seasoning. If you come here, stick with the pho and spring/egg rolls.

The first time we went here I had to try the Pho...because I am the self proclaimed Pho connoisseur.  Duh. The Pho tai chin gan (rare steak, brisket, tendon) was $7 which is a little pricey for its size. The pho tasted authentic relative to other ""pho"" stylings I've had before, but it needed a little extra fat to be flavorful. 

The second time I came here I had the Hu Tieu My Tho dry. The sweet sauce mixed with everything in the bowl was good. I liked that the noodles were clear and they didn't skimp on the meat. There is liver pieces in there just fyi. The menu also offered a Hu Tieu Fu Kieng which is a traditional noodle soup from a small group of Chinese/Vietnamese people. That was a new for me...

We ate mostly off the strip and who knew there was this great pho place 5 minutes off the main strip?!

Pho: Generous portions and i mean GENEROUS. In southern california, there are excellent pho restaurants but this place held its own. Amazing broth - rich and deep flavors - clean and not much fat in the broth.

Crispy spring rolls: WOW. There were four of us and we all agreed (they are more of an expert since they grew up in southern california) that these spring rolls were amazing - probably one of the best if not the best. Cripsy, warm, salty (yes, but went well with pho)...we brought the left overs back to our hotel and ate them later that night - and they were excellent except they went soggy after half a day :( (of course this is expected).

I had the beef stew with french bread - really nice portions and presentation, and the bread was perfect, having the nice consistency with soft, semi-chewy inside and thin crispy outside (but not super flaky). Not even the slightest hint of stale-ness in the bread like most places give you. I've grown up with great tasting Vietnamese food all my life and both of my parents are chefs - and this place did not disappoint. That's saying a lot! :)

My boyfriend got the combination pho - nothing to complain about and everything to praise. I seriously can't find any faults with this place. The place was very clean and well stocked with condiments. The service was quick and friendly.

My family and I were looking for Korean restaurant since my dad was not too fond of Pho but my pregnant wife wanted to eat Vietnamese and you know we cant turn down the pregos request. So at the last second instead of making a left turn to the Korean restaruant, I made a right onto this Pho Kinh Do.  I didnt expect much at all since this was a hole in the wall, opposite side of the street where all the nicely built plazas were but what the heck, I didnt feel like driving to find another Pho house.  Walked in with my family and grandparents expecting so so food since I had experience in new pho houses mostly to my regret.  The interior was clean but nothing fancy however the Sony 55"" LCD was a delight. We ordered some 2 plate of eggrolls, 2(one for my dad)combo pho, pho tai, wonton soup. the waitress was friendly, patience and very kind and understanding, i have 2 toddlers.  Then the waitress brought our goods, the vegetables were greeted with great delight because it was sooo fresh, the sprouts were trimmed properly and the basil leafs were so firm and the lettuce wraps for the eggrolls were fresher than fresh, at this point we were happy.  Then the soups started coming out, visually it was pleasing since their were no spotty oils floating around and the meats were so tender and perfectly cut.  We did our dressing for the soup and dove in. OMG, the first sip of the soup opened all these senses on my brain, wakening me up, then another big sip, WOW, its no joke, the soup is FANTASTIC!!! My wife tasted her soup and immediately requested for me to try hers, OMGoodness, one of the best wonton soup I've had in a long time. My mom loves pho and by looking how she wasnt saying much and just gorging down her food made me realize she was in PHO-Haven.  My dad didnt say much but just starting eating little by little and by the end, his dish was empty.  Just like any asian grandpas, they speak little but stated he was satisfied, OK.  We totally finished out meal and conversing to ourselves how delicious and happy we were to find this place.  Then the owner came out and greeted us.  He spoke of his credentials as a chef (cooked at Mirage & Bellagio) and the history of the name of his place. Such a kind man and compassionate about his food preparation which I believe why his food is sooooooo tasty, fresh and delicious.  And to top it off, the owner provided complimentary bahn mi sandwich for the road. His sandwich made subway look generic. My vegas trip was all worthwhile thanks to PHO KINH DO.  I thank the Almighty God YWYH & HIs Son Jesus Christ for leading me to this humble restarant.

Oh, my dad, who was not too fond of Pho, was very very pleased with his pho experience and wanted to try other pho houses back home in LA. He ranted over 10min how he liked the food in PHO KINH DO.

I started already referring all my family and friends to go to this restaurant.  I believe this restaurant will flourish since good things happen to good people and this place is good in all aspects.

Keep up the good work and God Bless the owner for his conscious effect and his establishment.

We went in the early afternoon when it wasn't busy, as there were only two tables occupied, one of them being ours. The restaurant was clean and had pretty modern decor and furniture. The servers were very friendly which is definitely a plus, especially in a typical hustle and bustle pho restaurant.

We got an order of spring rolls (2), which were really disappointing and it was clear that they had been sitting out for a long time since the skin wrapping was really tough and chewy and hard to bite into. The contents of the spring roll were just okay too, as I found the meat to be very dry. Overall, not very appetizing and didn't end up finishing mine =(

I also ordered the pho with rare steak and flank (my go-to combo). The broth was solid, though not as flavorful as I would have liked. They were generous with the meat and noodles, but the steak didn't taste that fresh and the flank was crispier/crunchier than what I am used to -- it seemed like there was no fat on it! First time this has ever happened to me in the infinite times I've been out to get pho! ODD!! It was also weird that I found about 10 pieces of tripe in my bowl when I had not ordered any...

First off, there is a yelp check-in offer for 2 free egg rolls.  When we showed the waiter, he rolled his eyes and looked annoyed.  Hey, if you don't like giving out the free egg rolls, then stop offering it.

There are 9 banh mi sandwiches to choose from.  I ordered the pork combo and my husband ordered the bbq pork.  The waiter told my husband no and that they only had the pork combo sandwich available right now.  What?  You're out of 8 sandwiches?  Weird, but my husband got the available sandwich.

When the sandwiches came, I was surprised at how big they were!  And for only $3!!  They are almost twice as big as the sandwiches at Hue Thai, and cheaper to boot.  About half way through the sandwiches, we asked about the egg rolls, which never came out.  Our waiter again rolled his eyes and went and got them.

Here's the kicker that really upset us.  We heard the guy at the next table order the same sandwich my husband tried to order before, and they didn't tell him no.  We called over the manager and complained, saying we were told they wouldn't make any other sandwich except the pork combo.  The waiter ran over and said, ""That's because when you ordered, the grill was full and it would have taken over 30 minutes to make your sandwich."" One, why didn't you tell me that and let me make that call if we wanted to wait that long.  Two, this other guy ordered his food only about 10 minutes after us, so the waiter's explanation didn't make sense.

I'm so torn as to what to give this place because as much as I thought the food was delicious and at a great price...I don't know if I would come back because of the service.

- Egg rolls: too much rice paper with a little bit of filling. Dipping sauce was bland.
- Pho tai bo vien: what a disgrace to the Pho name, soup was all about MSG with zero flavor. 
- Com bi cha thit nuong: the grilled meat was too salty and tough
- Bun bo Hue: the soup was very salty
- Bun tom thit nuong cha gio: same as above, he grilled meat was too salty and tough; the shrimp was bland and no juicy; cha gio/eggrolls was same as above. The dipping sauce/ nuoc mam chua ngot was bad.

There was a portable air conditioner plugged in, in the corner, to compensate for a broken HVAC. Presumably due to the broken HVAC, the place reeked strongly of spoiled fish sauce.

Another bit of bad news: the prices have gone up. Almost $6.50 for an order of 4 eggrolls. The eggrolls were tasty still, but not worth the value.

I noticed that the place was much emptier than previously. Probably a reaction to all the above. Waitstaff still friendly and attentive, though.",--WLHsm-AC4jcol2gOkmCQ,1,0,2,MLri8FjmiHwFXG0Z4dQ5AQ

4014358,2014-04-04,2,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Small location in the corner of an unassuming strip mall, big on flavor.

With so many (so many) different places to get pho in LV one can be overwhelmed.  Or severely underwhelmed if you are from the CA area, where they have so many more (so many more) pho places to eat.  There are a few top choices on Yelp LV for pho, thankfully Pho Kinh Do is up there.

Upon arriving to the restaurant you can barely tell it's there especially in the daytime with the windows all being near black from the tint.  Get inside and it's a little quaint eatery.  Hole-in-the-wall does apply.  We came here for a later dinner since the wifey was working overtime and didn't get off until near 8 PM.  It was a bit chilly and we were in the mood for soup, and pho just sounded like it would hit the spot.  My only problem?  Salt.  MSG.  Sometimes pho just sets off these headaches that just kill my day.  Oh well, no risk, no reward right?  Off we went on a Yelp adventure thanks to my slow@$$ Android phone (will need a new one soon).  

Get into Pho Kinh Do and for a Saturday night it was damn near DEAD.  Hmm...ominous?  There was one other table with patrons eating.  But what they were eating looked delicious.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess/waitress and got a table.  Menu was similar to what you see in many Vietnamese restaurants here in LV.  Got your appetizers, soups, noodle dishes, and rice dishes.  Thankfully, Pho Kinh Do has a sandwich section on the menu as well.  I love me some banh mi!

Went straight to ordering.  We both got the pho combo with rare steak, flank, tendon, and tripe.  Oh yeah!  My mini-homage to Andrew Zimmern of Bizzare Foods did not disappoint.  Less than 15 minutes later our bowls of hot pho came out, along with a plate of bean sprouts, cilantro, jalapenos, and basil for tasty good measure.  And already on the table?  Necessary condiments of chili sauce, and hoisin!  The pho was intoxicating, the simmering broth with it's lovely aroma of beef and star anise, little glistening droplets of fat on top, and the warmth of the steam.  Gave it a mix and a healthy portion of rice noodles, steak, flank, tendon, and tripe emerged.  This was a pretty big bowl of pho for one person!  Not shabby at all.  

Taste?  Tasty!  Broth for us wasn't overly salty, and has lots of complex flavor.  The noodles had a bit of bite left on them ('al dente' in Italian terms), and the lovely bits of steak, flank, tendon, and tripe were just barely cooked from the hot broth.  No soggy here folks!  Was actually a very good bowl of pho.  The wifey and I were both quite content.  

Not to be outdone by pho, I also ordered a banh mi just to make sure my tummy got full!  Got the required house special banh mi, which includes an assortment of Vietnamese cured meats such as pate, head cheese, and pork product of some sort (sounds scary but actually yummy).  The banh mi came to the table right after the pho, and it was a pretty good size.  About a 8-9 inch sub.  But it was loaded!  Not skimpy in the least.  Lots of meat, and a good serving of pickled carrots and radish, cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeno.  

Bahn mi?  Tasty as well!  This was actually one of the much better banh mi I've had here in LV.  Really!  The bread was soft and crusty but not hard, there was a generous slather of mayo (and possibly Maggi) that kept the bread moist.  The meats were good and not dried out, and the veggies were fresh.  A slather of hoisin and the eating was right!  Oh so right!  Finishing off that bahn mi totally put my tummy on lock down.  Fullness ensued.  I almost debated on ordering another banh mi to take home.

Nice thing about eating in a non-fancy restaurant!  The savings!  Each bowl of our excellent pho was less than $8 each!  A good bit less than other eateries in the area.  Lots of value there since the portion is big for the price, the wifey could only finish half her bowl, the rest we took home.  And the banh mi?  Little over $3, very competitive with other sandwiches in the area.  

Service was almost non-existent but that was only because of one waitress for the entire restaurant.  Almost immediately after we sat down two or three more parties showed up to eat.  When our waitress did see us she was very pleasant, kept our water glasses full, and actually talked to us about our meal.  Nice lady!

Good eats.  I will be here for takeout of banh mi at the very least.  Just wish they had the program where you buy 5, you get 1 free.  'Mi' would be all on that!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,3,4,8N7202Oj0LrTuD97YAX9Lg

And since she is an ""Elite"" what ever she writes must be taken as the gospel. I have been to this location several times over the years for tasty Banh Mi sandwiches. Back in the day I got several picky coworkers to eat the sandwiches without knowing what was inside. Man if they only knew what was in there!
 
  The parking lot was packed and it was hard to find a spot. We thought it might be really busy inside judging from the amount of cars there. Sharon L. kept saying that if it's too busy let's just go to Jollibee. I said with so many good reviews and seeing that the Duchess is an ""Elite"" this has to be a must eat! 

  As we walked in I thought maybe we should expect to be given a flasher and told a wait time. But this was not necessary seeing as we were the ONLY patrons there at 8 pm on a Friday night. O.k there was one other woman there but since the waiter was sitting at her table and talking her up. Something  about  are you a cocktail waitress? And you look good you should be! The restaurant seemed a little bit below capacity.

  Anyway he came and sat us and gave us some menus. Sharon L. asked if I was having Pho or ""Faux""? Since I have come to the conclusion that ""Faux"" is a waste of money. I told her politely no thanks, I will be having a couple of the tasty sandwiches tonight. See laughed and said your eating a sandwich at a ""Faux' place? Yeah and here's why, when you eat ""Faux"" you get the faux feeling that your full. You go back to your office, fire up some spreadsheets and in a couple of hours your hungry again. With only that old bag of flaming hot cheetos from the back of you desk to cure your hunger. No thanks!
 
  Sharon L. seeing that I was right about the ""Faux"" feeling ordered a sandwich with grilled pork and some spring rolls. I ordered two of the special pork sandwiches, I guess at any other place this would be called the #1. The food came fast and my sandwich tasted very good. I also enjoyed the spring rolls with sriracha sauce. Sharon L. spent most of the dinner dissecting her sandwich and picking out things that she deemed ugly. All in all a good meal with good service. 
Since my water glass was never empty, I went in the back past all the cleaning supplies and boxes to the surprisingly clean restroom! When I returned I was welcomed by the bill with a total of $17.23. A very good price for what we got.

   For all the people reading the reviews about getting ""Faux"" I quote. ""And still to this day, I have NEVER EVER looked down at my meat and saw that green, silver, purple metallic tinge of color that I often see at other pho places."" - Debra W ""Elite"".

On Spring Mountain, there's probably like a billion Pho places to try, but I think this was the one my parents recommended me when I moved to Vegas.

The moment I walked in, a Nujabes song was playing and I thought to myself, ""HOLY CRAP, THIS IS AWESOME!"" Then I was greeted by a woman who worked there that was sitting on the side talking with her friends. The moment I spoke in Vietnamese, hospitality increased by 10 times. They started to talk to me asking me what I'm doing in Vegas and why my Vietnamese was good. (I personally think I'm not that great...)

The interior looked pretty decent and clean and I ended up talking with the owners for a little bit more. In the end, they invited me to their friend's spa that's having a potluck and said it would be a good opportunity to meet more Vietnamese people. (I felt like it was also a sales pitch, but I'm a bit of a loner since I moved here.)

Well anyway, I ended up ordering Pho Dac Biet to go. When I got home it looked like the standard Pho. Bloody meat, Bo Vien, basil, lime, you know the usual! The moment I tasted it I realized the difference compared to the other Pho places. The broth didn't give off this unusually sweet taste that the others use which is a huge plus to me. Even the tripe was easy to eat and not hard like some places.

This place deserves the 4 stars, I really enjoyed it.

If you're a fan of that incredibly sweet broth, go elsewhere, but to me, this is perfect.


I'll come back when I don't feel like cooking at home. :]

4099740,2012-04-04,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"I'm usually very weary at trying new pho places unless someone can give me a ""it's better than (someplace I know)"" type of comparison.  But after tons of pho talk with my friend while I was in Vegas, I started to crave it.  I've eaten at Pho Kim Long but wasn't that impressed by their pho so whenever I eat there, I just get their bun.  So off on Yelp I went and researched some places until I came upon Kinh Do.

My first impression of the restaurant was that the server was very friendly.  Now that i think about it, I wonder if that was the owner.  Excellent service, nonetheless.  I checked in on Yelp and got some free spring rolls, which were good.  I'm not a huge spring roll fan so that's why I wasn't overly excited about them but they were still tasty.  Can't complain about free.  ^_^

Next up was my pho tai and iced coffee.  The iced coffee was the same as pretty much any other Vietnamese restaurant.  Now...for the pho.  There are three main things I look for when I eat pho.  The first being the broth.  The broth here was actually really tasty and I enjoyed it more than I did Pho Kim Long.  I don't like broths that are too consomme-ish and light, nor do I like broths that are too oily.  This one was not bad.  The second thing I look for is the additional veggies that they give you.  I need lots of lemons and I really don't like it when pho restaurants give you a lemon wedge cut into 1/16 of a size and it just about pops out of your fingers when you try to squeeze them.  This place served their lemons in 1/8 size so I appreciated that.  They even brought a generous portion of extra lemons when I asked for more so I appreciated that even more.  The third thing I look for when eating pho is their meat to noodle ratio.  I like to have a slice of beef with every bite of noodle and I'm forgiving if I end up with the last few bites of no meat.  I lasted pretty much the entire bowl with a good 1:1 ratio and only had to only eat a few more bites of noodle with no meat.  Great!

All in all, I thought this place was good and when I'm in Vegas and have the need to eat pho, I'll be back.",4OC4NuteeJkPSQeSiJLvRQ,4,1,4,OyFKTBzk2VhkN_UQ_J5YFA

All you really need is a hot flavorful broth, lots of delicious meat, reasonable noodles, and some thai basil and lime on the side. The pho dac biet (#5 [EDIT: appetizers are #1-#4] on the menu) came out very quickly after I placed the order (not a busy lunch hour). It satisfied my palate entirely, and it was very filling, about the same as a typical large pho somewhere else (there's only one size here) and very much worth the $7.49.

I also ended up with two cha gio (egg rolls) from the free Yelp check-in offer. They were very crunchy and filled with pork, carrots, and mushrooms the way I'm used to having them, which is not the same as your typical Chinese egg roll with lettuce and whatever mush is in the filling. A quick wrap in lettuce and a dunk in nuoc mam was all I needed for a nice appetizer.

Pho Kim Long, Lemongrass Cafe, and Da Lat all failed the test, but Kinh Do has passed with flying colors. Other than the Mexican server, they'd fit perfectly in San Jose. Actually, given the demographic trends, I guess they'd still fit.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,4,5,2md49FiHeuCqMCrt_209QQ

The bf and I ordered: a meatball pho, grilled pork and shredded pork and trip rice plate, and a pork special banh mi.

First off, the glasses in which we were served water were cloudy. On the inside of one of the cups, there was white goo (gross). 

MEATBALL PHO -very small meatballs and only about 6 pieces. Not only was there a lack of meatballs, but they had a rubber-like consistency and did not taste like anything at all. The broth was edible, but I wouldn't say it was delicious.

SHREDDED PORK/GRILLED PORK RICE PLATE -again, portions suck. There was a huge heaping of rice, but as far as the grilled pork--there as only about a 1/3 of a cup worth of meat. The shredded pork was mainly tripe (had like 2 pieces of pork in 1/3 cup of tripe camouflaged to look like pork). 

PORK SPECIAL BANH MI - now this is the only reason this place gets 2 stars. This banh mi was actually pretty good. The bread had a great crunch upon each bite and the pork was nicely flavored inside.

The bf--at any pho place anywhere--always gets the pho with rare steak and flank. Don't know why but he just does and if you ask him how it is he'll always say ""tastes the same."" So I can't critique what he had because the answer will always be the same.

As for me, I didn't want pho. I wanted the Banh mi bo kho! =) Banh mi bo kho is basically Vietnamese-style beef stew and it was absolutely heavenly. It tasted so comforting and hearty. The flavors were abundant, the spice level was perfect and the meat simply fell apart as you bit into it. By far, this dish is the best I've had--EVER. Kudos Kinh Do!

FYI: don't forget to check-in on Yelp because you get 2 free egg rolls =)

The service was pretty good for a Vietnamese restaurant. The woman bringing our dishes was very sweet and apologized for the slow service but we didn't think it was slow at all or if it was we didn't even notice.

Mind you, we have been here many times before. But I can assure you this will be the last. 

The waiters/waitresses were careless and not attentive. 

We ordered our food and minutes later the waitress came back out and asked what it was we ordered again? We also ordered and placed a couple of orders for to-go. So we repeat everything.

Then we waited for our food for about 40 mins. We asked where the food was, then it finally came out. No apologies, nothing. An order of pho never requires wait time of 40 mins. The food was bland. 

We asked for extra bowls twice along with forks (for the little ones). They came out with just the bowls, twice. We asked for more water. A waiter came and only refilled 1 glass, and left the other 5 glasses empty. We eventually reminded him to please refill the rest of the glasses. We asked for 2 boxes for leftovers. The waitress came out with 1. We had to ask again for the other box. 

When we were finally ready to pay (they usually bring out the to-go food so patrons can be on their way), we had to remind them that we ordered food to go. We shouldn't have to remind them. The waitress said pay first and your food will be coming out. We said we would wait for the food. We thought it was all ready when they went back to the kitchen to retrieve. The waitress came out empty handed and said one of the noodles they ran out. Total BS. Trying to save face that they have not made the orders. Then, they take their time in adjusting our receipt. How long does it really take to adjust a receipt? Suffice it to say we won't be coming back.

The pho tai here is good at $6.95. It's a big bowl, lots of broth, same amount of noodles as everywhere else I'd say with slightly thicker cuts to their meat. The broth has a rich color to it while maintaining its beautiful clarity. It's flavorful, but still light, and overall I enjoyed it. It was a solid bowl of pho.

The spring rolls (egg rolls, whatever) here are different, and mighty tasty. My only complaint is that they don't serve them with fresh mint!

Major pro here is the service! Best service I've ever had in a pho place, hands down! You can tell the owners here are very passionate about their business and I have a lot of respect for that. It made dining here far more enjoyable than many of their rivals around Spring Mountain.
Major cons (for me anyway): No ngo gai! This makes me very sad as it's my favorite herb and Vietnamese restaurants are the only ones using it.. They didn't have the soda with condensed milk and egg yolk that I've become obsessed with. The sate here doesn't seem as fragrant, more like ground up dried chiles in oil, but still decent.

While doing our research from home, this made us really excited to try it. I'm from Central CA and she's From Miami. Both of these areas provide a handful of cultural food options. So with Pho, we knew what we could ultimately expect. 

Unfortunately, when we got there, we realized it was located inside of the  24 Hour cafe, and just didn't seem like it was something we'd enjoy. An authentic experience really makes for the best food! 

So we opted out of the in-house Pho restaurant and decided to search local. We were stoked to find out that this spot was less than 10 minutes away from our hotel and discovered it was in the center of Vegas' China Town. 

The small quaint spot inside of a shopping center, was exactly what we're used to. An actually Vietnamese experience which seemed to be family owned. 

I'm going to make this short:
-The shrimp spring rolls were A+ (mmm peanut butter sauce!)
-The seafood/ shrimp pho was tasty
-The Vegetarian broth was a PLUS for those who don't eat meat. 

My ONLY complaint was that several of the shrimp weren't completely deveined. That turned me off to eat the rest of them. My cousin went to work on her own. I couldn't stomach it, though.

I'm always down to try a bowl of pho and was pleasantly surprised by Kinh Do. The decoration was not so typical to what I'm used to, but the TVs screens were nice! There was an interesting video of some European sights that gave it a relaxing vibe.

Ok! For the review, first off, service was really good. The waitress seated our group of 11 promptly and asked if we wanted anything to drink. After taking our orders, the food came out pretty quick too! TWe also checked in and everyone got free eggrolls. The eggrolls were delicious! It did seem little oily, but I mean, it's fried. They were crunchy and delicious.

I had the Pho Dac Biet. The broth was not bad. The veggies were good. Our server even brought out extra onions when we asked. The pho didn't have too much noodle or too little meat, it was balanced.

Check-in for 2 free egg rolls. Our party only checked in once but we saw others checking in multiple times per table.

Don't take advantage of the awesome offer they provide or soon it won't be there =)

Grilled shrimp and pork vermicelli ($8.95): I asked for veggies on the side since I hate mint leaves and surprisingly there was no mint! The veggies consist of cucumber, pickled veggies, shredded lettuce, and fried garlic in a whole 'nother bowl! Good amount of grilled pork and about 6 pieces of grilled shrimp.

But It's hard to rank this in place in the upper echelon of the baguette kingdom simply for the fact that the bread is outsourced. That means when it's re-toasted, the baguette turns very crumbly.  I do like how the restaurant makes your sandwich because the ingredients are top notch. You can't miss when your grilled pork served with regular dishes ends up in your Banh Mi. My gripe is that I feel the grilled meat here leans more towards the Chinese BBQ version vs the Vietnamese version. That means not enough lemongrass and nuoc mam.

their ""famous"" egg rolls were burnt to a crisp.  of course the edible portion was just chewy. nothing special. just tasted like they used mochiko to make it chewy. the fish sauce that accompanied it also tasted weird.

their spring rolls (shrimp/pork) were extremely thin and weren't wrapped well.  the pork in the spring roll was dried up and hard.  the sauce that came with this dish was extremely fishy -- in which we weren't accustomed to.

4669606,2010-07-10,1,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Where the original Pho Nhu Y stands across the street from Ichiza, we have the name that brings a smile to your face when you see the sign. A new place that took over a Vietnamese restaurant 3 months ago.

I went with the combination Pho with the rare slice beef, well done flak Tendon, trip, beef balls, and brisket. 

The broth was delicious with a strong taste like Pho Vilage. One major issue with the broth was it was really was yellow. The only way to get a yellow broth like this is to use chicken or have a lot of fat in it. Since this is beef noodle soup, I'll say its the latter. Don't get me wrong, I love fat but this broth was really yellow. It made me felt I was drinking a bowl of oil. Unlike other places, they don't scoop out the fat. I talked to the owner about it and she says to request the fat be scooped out next time. Personally, I think this should be standard and I shouldn't have to ask for it. She also made the remark that all this fat gives the pho its flavor. Right. Adding fat to anything would make it taste better!

The noodles aren't anything special. This has the same blandness as all the other places in town, except for Pho 87 and Pho Village. 

I was happy to see this Vietnamese restaurant use the culantro, the pointed fregrancy smelling vegetable. Only downer was one of the 3 leaves were wilted. The basil were wilted as well. The bean sprouts looked fine though. 

For a Vietnamese restaurant at the heart of Chinatown, I was surprised how nice and clean the place was. A good size HDTV sits on the side of the restaurant. 

Service was meh, like a fast food place. I order. I eat. I pay. I'm out. I did get ice tea instead of water. Nice in this 110 degree weather with stupid rain. They do take credit cards. They have free wifi, or someone nearby with the network ssid ""dlink""

Some other stuff they have is spring rolls, nem nuong (pork rolls), goi ga (egg rolls), banh xeo (pancake), com (broken rice), bunh bo hu (vermicelli noodle), and banh mi (sandwhich). Literally all the stuff you find at most Chinese restaurant.

Banh Mi Dat Biet/Combo Pork Sandwich ($3.75): Decent Banh Mi with a nice price tag. The sandwich is much thinner than other Banh Mi's I've encountered, but I figured it matched the price. 

Bun Tom Thit Nuong Cha Gio/Vermicelli with Grilled Shrimp, Pork & Fried Egg Roll ($9.95): I'm openly not a big fan of vermicelli noodles or dishes that feature them. However, this variation was tasty! I liked the flavor of the sauce you pour into the dish and all the toppings lent good flavor and seasoning to the plain noodles.

Bo Luc Lac/Shaking Beef ($12.95): Large chunks of filet mignon marinated and stir-fried. Served on top of a fresh salad and rice on the side. This was my first time having Shaking Beef, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste. The beef was relatively tender and the sauce was delicious albeit very salty. The salad was okay. I would love to discover more interpretations of this popular dish.

My sister ordered Pho and was unfortunately disappointed. I don't enjoy Pho as much as she does and upon tasting it, I had no opinion whether it was comparably good or not in regard to other Vegas Pho joints.

I am in no way an expert on Vietnamese food, but I was surprised how little I enjoyed about our meal. Especially since we chose Kinh Do based on its rave reviews. The empty restaurant at 7PM should've been a red flag!

The service was terrible, even borderline horrendous. We were the only people in the restaurant upon arrival and everything seemed well - we got a table, we put in our orders, and the food was quick. During our meal, just four more tables filled up. After that, we couldn't get the attention of either employee! Not only is this restaurant small, we were sitting right next to the door and in view of the host stand where at least one employee would just sit. Or they were walking in and out of the restaurant. We never received water refills, not even once. No one came to check on us or even bring us our bill. We had to approach THEM for the check and to-go containers.

I came in hungry so I got two BBQ pork bahn mi, one of the regular pork bahn mi, and I got the pho dac biet which had rare sliced beef, flank, tendon,tripe, and meatball. I substituted the beef ball for extra rare steak.

Everything I got was pretty tasty. I could taste the meat in the sandwiches, there was a good amount of meat, and the veggies and herbs in them help add a extra level of diversity to the flavor, they were a nice addition. The meat was hot and fresh tasting, and the veggies were crisp and fresh. The bbq pork sandwich had a more sweater taste than the regular pork.

I liked the pho, but not as much as the sandwiches. Even after dumping in all the bean sprouts, basil, and jalapenos, I just ended up eating everything but the broth. I at least know the broth is the main thing with pho, but I wasn't really feeling it. I just ended up slurping some of it, but mostly used it to dip my sandwiches in. So it wasn't a total waste, but I didn't eat/drink all of it.

While I would give the food as a whole three stars, this place gets bumped up to four stars because of the price. Everything was very inexpensive. One sandwich was $3.50 and the other was $4.00. I paid around 20 bucks for everything and ended up being full for the rest of the day.

You all are so lucky you live Vegas!!
I found my favorite Vietnamese Restaurant!
Im so happy!! 
After many many Vegas vacations, this is one of the best ones!
One of the reason is that I discovered this fabulous restaurant, 
Thank you sooooo much to Yelp! 

The day before we checked out Pho Bolsa, (this restaurant & Kinh Do both had 4 stars)
I was debating on if we should check out Kinh Do, since we already had Vietnamese food the day before-We are so glad that we did. 
Good Bye Pho Bolsa- honestly, we didn't enjoy it one bit. 
( I will write my review later for Pho B.)

On to the food, 
Me, My mommy, My Hubby, My daughter, & My son! enjoyed everything! 
I had the chicken pho- boy I loved it!!
My daughter had the pork chops & boy, she cleaned it. 
( at Pho Bolsa, my son ordered that- & it only came with pork chops and rice, what happened to the veggies? and it cost more than Kinh Do's and also portion was bigger at Kinh Do's)
My hubby had the seafood pho & there was no complaints!
My mommy had the seafood soup & she loved it too!
She mentioned that this place is better than the restaurant we went to the day before
& 
My son, yup! he is the picky one, but he ate everything! ( except for some pho noodles)
I halfed my banh mi with him and pho. 
Since we ordered the nem nuong rolls and Yelp's check in for the free eggrolls, that was more than enough food! 
Wow! the banh mi was huge and delish!! ( Pho Bolsa had no Banh Mi, I was very disappointed! )

I so can't wait for my nexts trip to Vegas, this will be my go to/on the list of places that I must go to!

& I also got to meet Kinh Do, the owner- she is a very nice and friendly lady!
The waitress was nice and friendly also 

Im just happy I found my new love- this fabulous place, which is Kinh Do!! 

See you soon!!",1cW_ZPWHNS0IJsxMblwIjw,3,1,5,eXbVBwMVYP-JjlsrIIIHzg

After a night to forget from partying on the strip, a regular american lunch just doesn't do much to cure the raging hangover one may have (er, not that iiii had one, of course). We saw the good reviews and decided to try this place out-and it definitely lived up to its star rating. The pho was fairly typical, and didn't particularly stand out to me... yet it was OH SO DELICIOUS. Seriously the best hangover food (uh, for my companions). Check in with yelp to get your 2 free egg rolls, which are great & perfectly crisp. The thai tea is a little too sweet & creamy, BUT after diluting it with a bit more ice & water, it was perfect.

The best thing about Kinh Do are the people that work there - the man that took our order was so friendly that I already wanted to come back before even trying the food! There was also a girl that checked in on us to see if we were doing ok halfway thru our meal (who does that at pho places??) so we were genuinely pleased with both the service & food. 

Parking was ok, but it was nice to go somewhere a little closer to the strip. There wasn't a wait the few times I went there so that's a plus too!",8CDxLgZ64GOMCS_ikvNnqw,0,0,4,krQKauDVpWwh_UOjYJCPpQ

I met two other yelpers who also came to try the place so the three of us sat together so we could be seated quicker.  Once we did seat, it was 15 or 20 minutes before someone stopped by to take our order.  We did it on two tickets.  I got the special pork sandwich, and the Beef & Flank Pho to which I had shrimp added to.  My companions had the seafood soup and spring roll appetizer.  Another long wait and then I got my food, but only me.  I was half way into my food when my companions got there's - which was after another table which was seated and had ordered after us.  The appetizer came out at the same time as the soup.
  My Pho was pretty bland.  I unscrewed the salt shaker and dumped mass salt into mine.  Still pretty flavorless.  It had white onion in it and a side plate with bean sprouts, fresh basil, slices of lime, and one piece of a pepper, looked like Jalapeño, which I should have thrown in my soup.  Even the sandwich, which was tender and inexpensive - had very little flavor.  Not the Vietnamese sandwiches I remember which were spicy.
  My companions' soup was much more flavorful, though the sweet and sour overpowered any seafood flavor.  My companions spent a lot of time weeding out bones from the catfish in the soup.  Also not my first choice of fish for a broth since Catfish can be a little strong being a bottom feeder.
  I should have chosen a spicy soup I suppose.  Not bad food, but tasted pretty mediocre to me.  I think I'll switch back to Japanese Udon which is packed with vegetables and flavor.",QIa4CoFXpeQrhTegEz4aqA,0,0,2,nxX0g0ZDDMCLUcy8ll18aQ

I always get the same thing, the vermicelli w/ pork and egg roll, then pour a ton of hot sauce on it. I really haven't had a bad one yet. Pho on the other hand is not my thing, but everyone in our party got it and seemed to like it. I think it's all in the broth and no one had a drip left so it's safe to say it was good?!

We got a order of eggrolls/cha gio to start. There's were super crispy and and more like the skin I'm used to around shrimp cakes which is more flaky. I kinda like this as it makes it really light and crisp.  All the veggies (lettuce, cucumber, mint) and pickled daikon and carrots were all good. 

I got the special pho and the broth was pretty flavorful and balanced with the spices. All of the brisket, tripe, tendon, beef ball and rare steak was decent enough in it. 

The BF really wanted rice plate so we got BBQ Pork. Flavor was decent, but it was BBQed too much to where it was dry. He traded me for my pho halfway so it was fair at least. The rice was seasoned nicely though, I can taste a nice lemongrass element to it. 

Service was alright enough. Our waters were refilled. We had to get up to the counter to get our check though.

5063899,2017-10-14,3,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Oooh wee! 

So I had to come here 3 times this week because the first time was just amazing.

The location is on the corner of Spring mountain and Arville, next to the ARCO gas staion. Parking is limited, but enough. Restaurant has a simple style feel to it, no extravigant decor or distracting art here. Just 6 tables that hold 8 people and 5 that can hold 12, so large parties can be held if needed. About 120 capacity. 

So why did it take me 3 times before the review? I had to see of the first and second time were actually that good. Well guess what, soup and sandwiches were as consistent as the first 2 times. After our favorite Vietnamese sandwich place closed 3 years ago, we had a hard time finding a replacement spot for years. Thought Lee's was it until one of our good friends directed us here.

What ordered:
#1 Eggrolls
# 32  combo sandwich
# 5 combo pho bowl

So obviously from my reviews I'm in love with Saigon 8, but boy did this spot come close. The phone soup base here is good. Like Saigon, they have fresh cut rare flanks, (well at least it tastes like it), and with only one size, the are very generous with the servings. And $1 less a bowl, oooh! 

Sandwich is freshly made. Unlike Lee's, sadwiches are served with the bread still warm, and not so hard. They have a house sauce that they use that's to die for. Again $1 less than Lee's, but with quality cuts and better flavor. 

So why 4 stars? My reviews aren't based on food only unfortunately. Despite coming in on slow days or times on my visits, service was slow. Great, but slow. Empty glasses, sad faces lol. An improvement on the interior decor wouldn't hurt. But besides that, it definitely worth a try. Very homey style flavors and setting.

Egg Rolls - absolutely love their eggrolls here. The crispiness and fry on the egg roll itself is so good. Inside flavor is perfectly seasoned as well.

Hu Tieu Nam Vang with My Tho clear noodles - really good. Best in Vegas so far. Broth is perfectly seasoned with a lot of different stuff put in unlike other places in Vegas. 

Bun Bo Hue - good and spicy. Comes with the works including pork blood. Yum

Hu Tieu Satay - packed with flavor and has that nice spicy kick to it

I recommend this place to everyone. Whenever I want my Banh Mi Fix I ALWAYS come here or order in advance for pick up to go.

so you looking for a vietnamese place to eat while you in Vegas.  You'll pull up the yelp review and will probably find this as one of the top three highly rated places.

This place is all ight, nothing too special about this place versus the other places.   I don't think you'll go wrong with picking this place.  To me they are all pretty much the same unless they serve something unique on the menu that other competitors don't have....

I 'mean you have alot of choice along Spring mountain road.. theres like 10 different vietnamese pho spots.  No kidding, take a stroll along this street and you'lll see what I'm telling you.  Ok Grab a taxi you'll need it to get here and also back to your hotel.   We tried walking back to the hotel from the restaurant but eventually got cut off by the separation from pedestrian walkway and the freeway.

Okay summary.   If you are yearning for a good vietnamese place to eat and tired of spending too much money eating at the hotel establishments then you can't go wrong with anything along spring mountain road this place being reviewed included.  A full meal for two with appetizers drinks and shit won't cost you more than 35 bucks tops.  ya can't beat that.

I came here the first time because of their free egg roll Yelp check in offer, but that marketing trick definitely worked because I've been back multiple times.  Also their egg rolls are awesome and I'll explain more in a bit

The Pho - The broth is super flavorful!  The noodles are a great consistency and the price ranges in price from 7-7.50. They have all of your usual ingredients such as rare steak, flank, tendon, meatballs, & tripe.  You can get it in any combination that suites your palette.  I usually get it with everything but the meatballs, but that is just a personal preference, there is nothing wrong with the meatballs, I just don't need them in my Pho.  I've taken a couple people here and they all seem to like it.

The Eggrolls - They come out with all of the stops and they are FREE when you check in on Yelp.  You have your Lettuce, pickled veggies, and fish sauce with their wonderful deep fried goodness.  I would without question buy them if they didn't already come with my meal.

It is a low maintenance restaurant and I've never had to wait for a table.  They have a flat screen TV and their waiters and waitresses are super nice.

Pho Tai ($6.95): Rare Sliced Beef Noodle Soup. Awesome! Broth is a little darker and more ""meaty"" with just the right amount of salt. So much flavor in here...from the first sip, I knew this was my new FAVORITE in Vegas!  Portions are large, lots of meat and goodies hiding inside, and all at a great price!  Can't ask for more!

Banh Mi Thit Nuong ($4): Grilled BBQ Pork, Carrots, Mint, etc. Sooo good! Packed with so many goodies in a soft sweet bread, with a little crisp on the outsides. BEST Banh Mi I've had so far!  The difference is in the flavor of the grilled pork, and the amount they give you in the sandwich...Yum :P

Banh Mi Bo Kho ($7.95): Beef Stew with French Bread. VERY flavorful broth, fairly spicy, with super tender beef...fall apart actually. Again, the best I've ran into so far, although I don't typically order this dish often, so take that for what it's worth. Can't go wrong here!

We got Complimentary Egg Rolls with Yelp check-in! These were pretty tasty, with all the veggies / goodies to wrap them up and eat.  Good, especially considering they were free LOL.

I found me a new favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas!  Thanks Yelp :P

5148233,2015-06-23,1,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Came here this past weekend during my trip to Vegas. Found this restaurant through Yelp and with such a high rating so my group were down to try it out. I kid you not, this place does not know how to run a restaurant. There were quite a few groups of people waiting to be seated and I see 2 blank tables open and a table that was not cleaned for the longest time. All the workers were just standing around the counter talking to each other. We had a party of 8 and it took them like 30 minutes to seat us. 

After we get get seated, we put our order in immediately since we are were starving waiting for the table. 20 minutes in, we haven't heard anything from the server and our food didn't come out yet. We asked out server where our food is and she said we were next. We were getting quite impatient so we gave them another 5 minutes and still no food. We saw a few table getting their food before us and they were seated after us. Finally after 30 minutes, our food comes out one by one. IT TOOK THEM 30 MINUTES TO MAKE A BOWL OF PHO. This is by far the longest wait I've ever had for a bowl of pho... 

On to the food. Having to wait 30 minutes for my food, I was expecting this bowl of pho to be the best pho I have ever had in my life. Nope, I was wrong. It came with literally 4 pieces of meat. There is nothing special about it at all and for the price of $7.95, it is definitely not worth it. Overall, the pho is about 5/10.

The customer service was the worst. Lack of communication, lack of service, and slow. In my opinion, they really need to restaff all their cooks and workers. 1/10 

10/10 would not come back.",FVQcaAROp_UQnlmvOfyvhQ,1,0,2,od-Tsk9jPQDfIALbDHjiZQ

If you're staying on the strip, it's a quick taxi/uber ride away. I wasn't expecting much tbh..

The pho here is excellent. I've had many different pho restaurants living in the bay area, but this one is probably top 3 for me. The broth is real important in any pho, and everyone's recipe is different. The first thing I taste is the broth, and that determines almost everything. The broth here is amazing, even my girlfriend agrees, and her grandparents own a pho restaurant. The noodles aren't too soft like some places, and their meat is nice and tender.

The veggies were just bok choy, not the garden delight I used to receive. But, the plate of pho fixings is still one of the freshest in the land! The sandwich was disappointing. The mayonaise was thick, the veggies were over-pickled and the vegetarian filler they use was over-fried, making it chewy and greasy.

We arrived, the place wasn't quite bumping, but the aroma was entrancing. The soup already smelled so good. I don't know if it was because we were still hungover, famished, or just really enjoying the scent. We were seated immediately for our group of 10. Food came out (I would have expected it to come out faster since there were almost no other patrons. Prices are typical, but the sandwiches are only $3!!! And they're HUGE!

I ordered:
-10 pho: it's basically the house pho without meatballs. Lots of big pieces of meat! Lots of soup and noodles! It's actually pretty hefty. I can't believe I ate it all. After lunch, I proceeded to suffer from intense food-coma.
-82 sandwich: shredded pork skin and pork meat. Like I said before, for $3, it was big! Like practically a foot long from Subway. I had it after clubbing for a wee-hours-snack. It was pretty tasty, but by that time, it was a little dry. Also, there is a huge slice of jalapeno in there, so I took it out before I consumed everything.

The egg rolls came out first of course. AND I GOTTA SAY: Sorry, I do not like. I took a bite and no longer wanted it. The wrapper they used to wrap it in is very different from what I'm used it. It was more chewy than crispy. I'm not sure if it's their wrapper or if they just re-fry it when a customer asks for it. The fish sauce it came with wasn't very ... good either. But hey, it was free. 

As for the pho, well, their soup base is ... interesting. It was very sweet. I'm not really a sweets person so the soup base turned me off. I ended up adding a bunch of siracha to my soup -- my bowl was red by the end of the night. Alas, it was futile. It did not mask the sweetness of my soup. 

They actually also forgot to put beef balls into my mother's order. She had ordered the combo with everything along with my father. My father had beef balls in his but mother did not. We had to tell them about it and they had to come out with beef balls in a small separate bowl for my mother. How do you forget something like that...?

We looked across the street, found this place and decided to give it a try. One factor on our decision to try it was, of course, the reviews by other Yelpers. Thank You for that. 

The location is big which can accommodate large groups. The restaurant itself is well maintained and clean. Service is great. Parking is not an issue as it is situated on a big plaza with other businesses and a large lot. 

We tried the Pho, Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls. All were delicious. I say that with all honesty as I have tried many Pho places in Southern California myself where I live and have become picky about Pho now. The Pho had great flavor, not salty and was served hot as it should be. The meat in the pho looked and tasted fresh. The Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls were made fresh as well and tasted good.

I'm not picky with my pho at all, so I don't understand how this place managed to leave such a horrible impression on me. It's located in a pretty dead plaza, and the outside of the restaurant isn't inviting at all. I think the windows are tinted pretty dark so if it weren't for my friend suggesting this place, I would've thought it was closed or out of business, along with many of the other restaurants located in this area. 

I had a long night the night before and was just looking for some soup. I ordered plain pho without meat and sad to say, I was very disappointed. The soup just had a weird like herbal flavor to it which I've never experienced with any other pho I've tried. I literally took five bites and just couldn't stomach it anymore for some reason. They give really big portion sizes too so it looked like I hadn't even touched my food. Although it was only six bucks, it was like the biggest waste of six bucks I've ever spent lol.

5372848,2011-10-14,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Have held out for some time on writing this review. It is not fair to judge a place just for a quick trip to pick up dessert, but Kinh Do makes one of the worst Che Ba Mau I have ever had. The mung beans are replaced by whole white beans from a jar. The kind that are used for Halo Halo. The red beans were kidney beans. Coconut milk might as well have been coconut water. For once, I can say that the simple syrup was not too sweet. It was not sweet at all. With so much ice in the cup, it quickly melted and watered down everything.

Instead of giving an unfair and scathing review, the true test of a Vietnamese restaurant lies in one of the noodle soups; Pho, Bun Bo Hue, or Hu Tieu. An order of Pho Dac Biet went in and what was presented was a large bowl of steaming hot, meat filled glory. Add in heaps of bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos, and a squeeze of lemon and it is ready for devouring. Are their better pho out there? Sure, but my dad is probably happy that I don't harass him to spend 14 hours watching over the pot. Kinh Do will do until he busts out the pot in winter.

The Cha Gio were also delicious. Not the prettiest, but definitely tasty. Wrapping them in lettuce with, cucumbers, cilantro, pickled daikon and carrots then dunking it Nuoc Mam is how I learned to eat this dish.

The pho is good, we normally get the pho tai or the pho tai chin gan, usually it has just the right amount of fat.  Occassionally it has been too fatty where it congeals on top (sometimes the A/C is on too high in the restaurant!).  

The servers are friendly, though often inattentive.

We hit up the spot around noonish on Christmas Eve and it was pretty crowded so we waited patiently, however, rather than clearing the table directly in front of us that could fit our party of five, they continue to fill all open clean tables before finally getting to us. After waiting 15 minutes for a table, we had to wait another 15 minutes just to order drinks! There was plenty of time to looked through the menu 2-3x so we ordered during the same time as our drinks. The waiters were dressed in regular chill clothing, which made it difficult for us to wave down a server because they got our drink orders wrong! We ordered Vietnamese coffee, hot tea, waters, and a thai tea. They forgot the Vietnamese coffee and only gave water to those who did not order a drink. That took at least 10 minutes. After they finally brought out the drinks, they asked us again what we ordered. Apparently the server who took our order forgot (he didn't write it down). We ordered two pho dac biets, a beef stew, spicy chicken noodle soup because they didnt have the chicken curry I wanted, and a bun ba hue. My spicy chicken noodle soup was meh. The noodles were OVER cooked and started to absorb too much of the liquid and become mushy. Everyone else said their dish was alright. The thing that sucked was, my brother didnt get his bun ba hue until all of us were about 75% done with our dishes.

So according to my pho biting..because I have definitely had lots of pho from many places...their pho is pretty tasty. 

However, my rating isn't based on the pho. I'm rating their banh mi sandwiches. I usually order the pork skin banh mi. It's not pork skin the way you may think. Crispy fried bits of pork skin, no. This looks more like chewy clear versions of the pickled daikon the put into the banh mi. I've always ordered this because there's something strange about it to me but in a good way strange. And I am no food adventurer at all. Their bread ALWAYS comes out fresh. Warm. And perfectly toasted. The meat to veggie ratio, PERFECT!! it is literally theee bessssst banh mi sandwiches out here, in my opinion. Which by the way, 3 days ago I finally discovered what the acronym IMO stood for. 

I've also had the bbq pork and bbq chicken banh mi and their just as good. But I will admit the bbq chicken banh mi my son had tasted a little dry. STILL GOOD though! 

When I order my banh mi I omit the jalapeños and replace it with squirt of sriracha and dabs of that chili oil they leave on the table. Deeeelish! Sometimes I think I love banh mi just so I have reason to squirt sriracha and have dabs of chili oil somewhere. 

The service is good enough for us. They've always provided us with just the right service. I think Asians have a different caliber of ""good service."" There's no way anyone with the right cultured mind can keep a pho joint caliber of service to one at a steakhouse or taco shop or whatever. They're literally on their own grade scale. Lol. To end the babbling, I've never had a ""bad"" experience service and food wise. I'd recommend them for sure. Oh, and their bbq pork plate with rice is pretty tasty too!

Although, Misty did give it 4 stars back in 2012, what the pho?!? She don't even like noogles?!?  Now that's saying something...right??

Anyweezy, I had to establish a baseline, so went with the Dac Biet (so be-it) and gave it the naked test.  The naked test consists of putting absolutely nothing in your pho to dress it up...no sate, siracha, hoison, etc.  

The true test always starts with the broth.  In this case, the broth was iffy and didn't trigger and serotonin.  The temp was not that hot, bit then again, I prefer scorching so that it brings out the flavor.  It seems as though the 4 star rating corresponds to the amount of star anise they put in each bowl, cause that was my instant impression.

Noodle portion was on the skimpy side, I wasn't aware of verm boycott.  I instantly knew I wouldn't leave with that ""glutonous"" feeling, ya know??  But it is reasonably priced according to what you get.  I better not catch them weighing their meat in the back kitchen like Quizno's, that eliminates those days when you think the waiter/waitress has the hots for you because you got an unusually hefty meal compared to others.

What did stand out was that the rate beef, tendon, flank etc were good cuts, except for the brisket, it was way too big (that was what she said) making it settle to the bottom after you finish everything else leaving you with sandwich meat hidden in the soup, something a person who gave up meat for lent would do and keep it on the hush.

And the verdict is...good and a bit above average, but you know you gotta grade on a curve when it comes to pho.  I definitely had worse (06' San Francisco after a Rock the Bells concert at McCovey)...ahh, must supress negative flash back.

I was hoping for much more, which only reinforces the notion, ""quality over quantity"" when referring to reviews.  I much rather go with Pho 87 or even fall back on Pho So Uno across the street.

First off let's start with the egg rolls. They were free and was just ok. Nothing to rave about frozen egg rolls.

For the pho, it is not authentic. The noodles were really bad. The noodles in my bowl was undercooked and the noodles in the other bowls were over cooked. Every time they would try to get a noodle it would fall apart. The broth was terrible!! It is obviously low grade MSG mixed with insufficient amount of fish sauce. I don't know why they are stingy with their fish sauce because it is cheap. The beef cut is good, the green onions are fresh, and the other veggies were decent. 

For the bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) it was horrible!! I do not know why it is so sweet. They should call it sweet beef noodle soup. The thick noodles were prepared properly with the correct texture and the meat was braised okay but the flavor of broth just threw it off. Overall I would describe this dish as teriyaki beef noodle soup.


For the mi satay (spicy ramen) the broth was very thick. It had the consistency of sludge and the taste was very offsetting. They have tomatoes in their broth and it must be rotten because I could not take a second bite. The meat was still raw and the so call broth was not hot enough so the meat did not fully cook. The ramen added another layer of disappointment. It was raw so it had a awful crunch to it (similar to raw pasta). Please do not order this.

5752724,2014-06-04,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Hooray for Kinh Do, we have found our pho place in Vegas!  I hate pho joints that smell.  There are plenty of them in Vegas.  Driving into Vegas on a late night, we needed some warm pho soup before heading into the hotel.  Looking on Yelp we found this place, so decided to take a chance on it.

Walking in, pleasantly surprised to find a clean place in a busy strip mall without the unbearable odor around.  Nice server lady takes our order promptly, and within minutes we get our pho noodles.  I also order a Vietnamese hot coffee, expecting to get the typical drip cup.  What I get near the end of my meal upon reminding the server (I think she forgot) is a warm coffee all mixed with milk and pre-dripped.  A significant disappointment especially since the coffee was just okay.

Well, on to the pho.  It comes with a decent amount of veggies (again, New Saigon in Johns Creek is overly generous in this regard), and a ton of noodles.  After doing all the prep work (put in the veggies, sriracha, etc.), I bite into the noodle and the soup.  Their soup has a peculiar taste that reminds me of the meat broth in Korean stews.  The ones that broth of hours have a deep taste that ups the yummy factor.  The soup in this place has that.  It's possibly the best pho broth I've had.  A big thumbs up for that.

One slight disappointment is that there is a bit too much noodle in comparison to the other stuff in the soup, so I ended up with a fair amount of noodles with nothing to accompany it.  Either a bit less on the noodles or a tad more other stuff (or both) might balance it out a bit more.  But I'm really nitpicking there.  This is some good pho!

First 2 times I got pho. Really good but didn't blow my socks off. Third time I wanted to try a noodle soup dish but decided to stray away from my usual. I ordered the bun bo hue. The flavors were really good and melded together well but I think it was overly seasoned and slightly too thick. It was a heavier stew than what I am used to with this dish. My son had the combination fried rice. We have had fried rice in every Viet restaurant in Vegas and I would say by far, this one would be in the top 2. 

Today on this cold night I ordered a bowl of pho. It was slightly sweeter than I remembered but still good as is evident in my empty bowl. I ordered the banh mi thit nuong and a thai tea to go. When I finally tried the banh mi I was so impressed! Even as a cold sandwhich I was so happy to finally find a good banh mi in this town. The pork was a thicker cut but so incredibly tender and flavorful. It is reminiscent of a Thai beef jerky a while back but way more unctious and tender.  It is quite obvious that the marinade is comprised of many different ingredients that make it so complex that my mind and tastebuds were trying to catalogue what was all in it. Lemongrass is definitely a top ingredient that makes the meat so fragrant.  This is so beyond fish sauce and sugar like some other places :-/ The mayo seemed fresh, the pickled veggies and fresh greens just put it over the top. I'm so glad I finally got the banh mi.

5862814,2016-07-06,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"During our recent trip, I think we can here 3 times.  That's unheard of.  The review is only for the banh mi op la (fried egg).  Growing up, I ate all different kinds of banh mi, but now, I unwaveringly go back to only this one.  My husband is Chinese and still wants to try all the other different varieties, but he's also beginning to realize that op la is the best.  It's so much more than an egg sandie when done right and quite beautiful in its simplicity.  First, the fresh bread makes the dish.  It has to be gently toasted so that the exterior has that paper thin crunch that gives into the soft, warm chewy middle as you take a bite.  Secondly, the egg must be runny b/c you want it to augment the maggi/mayo sauce and melt them with the slight tart and crunch of the pickled radish and carrot.  Kinh Do nails it and for a little over $4, it's not a bad price.  Hubs ordered the chicken banh mi too, but it was a bit dry.

Service is nothing worth mentioning.  It's your typical asian restaurant.  I asked for more maggi, and the girl said they didn't have any.  Odd.  I might come back to try  some of their noodles or the nem (viet sausage), but it's hard to not order the banh mi op la:)",vH8UjE__eQzUUdDRu0fUMw,3,1,4,CT9ClazZErfW3IpH9Regcw

The waitress did thank us for waiting, but we were super hungry by the time we got seated, and it still took a long time to get anything.  The appetizers (spring rolls, etc) didn't come out until all of the food was ready, and they had missed my drink order.  They were out of bread in the middle of the day (= no Banh Mi).

Even though they didn't have a vegetarian-friendly menu, they were more than happy to cook me up a bowl of vermicelli with egg rolls (I'm ovatarian) that more than made up for it. I loved the authentic feel of the place, and the food definitely reflected on that.

The woman serving us was the sweetest thing. She knew exactly when we were in need of refills, and was great with providing recommendations. She was great conversation too, pity I didn't get to catch her name.

The atmosphere was so down to Earth, and still clean and respectable at the same time. Me and my date sat there for nearly an hour just talking because we felt so comfortable. We honestly didn't want to leave.

5916964,2011-11-27,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"Only positive things to say here.  Firstly, regarding the free egg rolls.  We came in as a group of 7, and when i asked about checking in, they said ""only one order per table"". How is that possible?  definitely doesn't favor large groups right? So the waitress went to double check, and the manager (?) came over and confirmed that every yelper who checks in, gets one order of 2 rolls. Now that's what i call fair!  We had four yelpers at our table and so got four orders. 

Spring rolls were fantastic-- they came out hot and savory, and with all the fixings, fresh. i like how this restaurant doesnt skimp on the garnishes, like basil and mint leaves, jalapeno slices, lime wedges, pickled daikon and carrots, and bean sprouts.  This restaurant even had the heart to peel off the tips and roots of the bean sprouts, which i thought spoke much of the integrity of this restaurant and its desire to serve the best.  In the midwest, where I study, you can forget about it, and in Singapore, where I come from, sprouts with the ends and tips peeled off sell for triple the price of the unpeeled ones. 

had a delicious delux Bahn Mi-- loved how it came out warm, and the bread was crusty and thin but did not yield to the fillings. 

Everyone at the table had Pho-- Dac Biet and Tai Chin, and everyone loved it.  Even my bf's sister and her bf, who study at Seattle and are spoilt for choice for Pho. 

I had the Hue style Pho. SO GOOD! i wanted to pass out.  Good Hue-styled pho is hard to find, and i usually avoid it, but the Bahn Mi and Spring rolls that came out before that were so promising that i went all in.  I salivate thinking about it. Comes with some pig hoof, blood cubes, brisket and the works. 

Service was fanstastic.  Everyone was happy and smiley, and our lovely server seemed genuinely excited to serve us all.",NwJVKTC6gbTG1pz2Wdag8g,0,0,5,8F_fHaPnGwgXjwo5i1czqw
5918603,2011-05-28,0,-IWsoxH7mLJTTpU5MmWY4w,"A friend recommended this Vietnamese restaurant for me to try when it was still relatively new, since he frequents here for lunch.

After that initial visit where I ordered one of their Com Tam (Broken Rice) dish and Leosdianto L ordered the Bun Bo Hue, I have not been back again until yesterday.

We were at the restaurant when it was relatively slow and were served by a new waitress.  But the service was good.  We mostly ordered pho, as they have recently made improvements to it.  And it was pretty.  The garnishes for the pho was super fresh, always a good sign at pho restaurants.  We also tried some of their Vietnamese sandwiches (their special and the one with fried eggs).  Overall the banh mi was way better than Lee's sandwich across the way, and the surprise hit for me was their Fried Egg Banh Mi.  I would go back just for that, even though it is something that is easy to make at home.

The owner was very friendly and spoke to the guests, making sure everything is satisfactory.

Service:  4/5

Food:  3.5/5  Pho was good, decent portion and the flavor of the broth is nice.  The fried egg banh mi is good.

Price:  3/5  Very reasonable.  In line with other restaurants in its class and category.

Cleanliness:  4/5  Clean!

Decor: 3/5  Has a tv playing movies, the tables are arranged in a way that does not make you feel cramped.

Basically this appears to be a family run operation with very little experience in how to serve the customers.  We walked in to a pretty packed restaurant and within 10 minutes it was clear that they were not equipped to handle that many tables at once.  We waited 45 minutes for our food to come out and that's after having to place our order twice since they somehow lost our first order.  I can't understand why it would take so long other than to guess that they are just completely unorganized.

The sad part is the food was actually quite good.  The had the cleanest bean sprouts I've ever seen at a PHO place.  You can tell a lot of care went into the preparation.  The soup base does not appear to have MSG in it which is a huge thing for me when it comes to a good PHO experience.

People were everywhere and it was easy to see that they were understaffed (poor waitress was running everywhere). We were seated and ordered fairly quickly as well. We waited 15 minutes to be seated....then an additional 45 minutes for our food. By the time we got our order, the restaurant was pretty much cleared out! Granted, everyone who was seated around our time also had to wait, but pho should be quick! Anyway, this is what we ordered:

Pho tai: The bf did not like the beef...said it was very chewy.

Pho (well done steak, brisket, tendon, tripe): I liked my dish. Meat was soft, tendon aplenty, and tripe was good too. The noodles were slightly undercooked though.

Egg rolls: Skinny and EXTREMELY oily. There was a puddle of oil after we were done. Flavor was good though.

Overall, we all agreed that our broth was a bit too bland and the noodles too hard. I think they ran out of ingredients and had to rush everything, hence the low quality of our meal. I will take into account that I am probably spoiled from living in the OC and LA area where pho is everywhere, but for the rating Kinh Do has, it should have been better.

He also ordered a fried egg banh mi (can you say yum?), since he can't resist those when he sees them on a menu. I wasn't really feeling my vermicelli bowl (I took half to go and ended up tossing it later when I realized I didn't want any more), just didn't seem to have the right combination of seasonings and the noodles were a little mushy. The pho had a sweet flavor that I found incredibly unappealing and tasted a little like dirty water with sugar in it. My fella didn't like his pho at all and stuck to his banh mi. I tried it and the bread was fluffy and warm. Perfect texture and great portion for the price. He said he liked it, but would order it with fewer condiments next time.
