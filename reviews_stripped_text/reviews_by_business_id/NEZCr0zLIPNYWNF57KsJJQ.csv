I told the cashier, who was rude, that I don't want another coupon when it clearly said cash, pointing to the words. She went to talk to the owner, who was too lazy to come out and address it, and he told her that she could only give me the coupon.

1459606,2014-12-16,9,NEZCr0zLIPNYWNF57KsJJQ,"This is the reason I love Groupon. It takes me to places that I would normally never go to, or give a reason to go to. Ninja Teriyaki completely surprised me, you can even say in a pleasant way.

So, this spot is located over on the east side near the Donut Hut, and around that area. Walking in, this place reminded me of hole in the wall joints that I am particularly fond of. After ordering, I sat down at the bar and awaited my order.

First, the chef was kind enough to give me a glass of water to sip on. I really appreciated that. Shortly after, my food had arrived. I ordered a side of Hijiki, which came first. It was a marinated black seaweed dish that had other vegetables tossed inside of it. I liked it, it had a real clean taste, and the seaweed was fresh. I enjoyed the simplicity of it.

Then the bento came up. The California roll was good. The crab was fresh and the rice was cooked correctly, so I appreciated that. The chicken teriyaki wasn't too sweet, and the chicken was tender and not overcooked. The mac salad wasn't overdressed and the macaroni was cooked to al dente. And finally, the tempura'd items, the mash potato and shrimp, were also very enjoyable as well.

On my next visit, I ordered the chicken katsu combo and the veggie egg rolls. Let me go on record by saying this, Ninja might have some of the best veggie egg rolls in town. The filling was amazing. As for the chicken katsu, the chicken was moist and tender, and the crust wasn't too thick, but was still crispy. Once again, the rice was cooked perfectly, and the side salad was a nice touch.

I wanted to give it 5 stars, especially due to the great value for the quality of food, but I don't like how some business' handle Groupon. I mean, if I have 10 dollars worth of Groupon bucks, and my total comes up to 9.99 before tax, like... just let it go. I think that this will be a big reason why I won't come back here.

Favorite pick is the salmon bento box: portion of salmon, chicken ""teriyaki"", and cali roll plus sides of mac salad and seaweed salad. Added on an order of eggrolls. Salmon was a little oilier than expected, chicken was moist dark meat fried nuggets but I did not taste any teriyaki seasonings or sauce?, Cali roll was fresh, sides were just okay.

Although I typically get these items, there I've never had anything on the menu I didn't like. Their bentos are all good and so is the beef sukiyaki, katsu and udon! 

The owner appears to be the main cook here which is probably why the food is always consistent. Orders all come out hot and fresh, and sometimes a little too fresh because it's so burning hot, it's tough to eat! The front of house employees are always very nice and polite and I've never had an issue with them.

The value was so exceptional for the excellent sushi.
We returned on Monday at dinner time and they were nice enough to give us the same lunch special at dinner time.
We want to try the Bento Box also very reasonable with a variety of Japanese Food.
The owner Masa has outstanding background, having cooked at some of the

My first visit was a few nights ago. I went with the beef sukiyaki plate for $7.49 ($5.99 bowl cost). The clerk claimed that their plates have a higher portion size than the bowls, but I wasn't buying it after seeing my friend's beef sukiyaki bowl. The beef was pretty good, and so was the noodle... but since it comes with rice in addition to the noodle, I really felt meat-deprived. I did like the green salad with dressing and the extra-peppery macaroni salad, but I'm not sure that the combination is worth the extra $1.50 for me.

I came back today for a chicken teriyaki bowl ($5.49). There is absolutely a ton of chicken, so I enjoyed that aspect. What I disliked was how the flavor seemed to disappear toward the latter half, as if there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce to last, or the sauce wasn't strong enough to last. And it's more or less one note of flavor, as opposed to the Thai dishes served at my favorite lunch spot in this area.

There were a couple other tables at times during dinner, but it was pretty quiet during what would be the peak of dinner at more established places. And I was the only one there when I showed up after peak-lunch.

Haven't tried the sushi yet, so let's say this is only a review of half of the restaurant. There's some candy on the front counter that I haven't tried, and also a bento box and a ""specials"" board, so browse those if you try out Ninja.

5308703,2017-01-03,0,NEZCr0zLIPNYWNF57KsJJQ,Surprised by this place.  I would have never gone there if just driving by.  In an old stripmall in a not so glitzy part of town. I went in because of Yelp.  Glad I did.  Very clean and tasty food.  I guess the chef has worked on the strip in some fancy Japanese places and now has his own little place.  Simple menu and friendly staff.  Quick service and great prices.  Good place to stop if you're in this area.  There really aren't very many good options around it.,dR2n7GaWW_9O_UaAmttWqQ,0,0,4,I0KlCDab9Tgsm9KlnAeqag

No they dont have orgasms, volcano, sushi special rolls..they have just enough simple sushi to get your wasabi fix. They have this thing called fried chicken, its the best mochiko chicken i have had in las vegas. What makes it is the siracha aioli dipping sauce. Plus its not overcooked like someplaces. You know where you just took a bite of chicken jerky ball. This is a delicate, moist and crunchy on the outside.",AJcici429Ou2jGtI2xeesw,1,0,5,Llwq4g3aByEzn8GImKm5gA

Walked in on Monday 1-25-16 at 5:30 PM and placed a to-go order.  This restaurant is located on Desert Inn & Pecos next to the dollar store.  The menu is posted behind the counter on the wall and has all the classic items you'd expect from a sushi joint with very little frills.  No fancy orgasm-sauce-covered-cream cheese-deep-fried nonsense here.  They do have other stuff besides sushi like teriyaki bowls, udon soup, edamame, bento boxes, etc.  
.
$35.62 got me an order of shrimp tempura, an order of fried chicken pieces, two sushi snack rolls, a shrimp tempura roll, and a rainbow roll.  I was on my way in less than 10 minutes!  Talk about ninja fast! 
.
The tempura shrimp were crunchy and very well flavored.  The star of the show was the fried chicken pieces...they were battered and then deep fried and so crunchy and juicy.  Both came with tasty dipping sauces.  
. 
Most of the rolls were maybe one step above gas station sushi...lots of cali roll filler.  I enjoyed the shrimp tempura roll the most.  The rolls were beautifully presented in a sushi tray with ginger and wasabi.  I was given soy sauce, napkins, forks, and chopsticks without having to ask which I think is thoughtful.  
. 
This is a great place if you want sushi but don't want to dine in.  Sometimes you just wanna take it to go and watch some Netflix on the couch.  I realize you can get take-out from just about any sushi place but this place is *designed* for it, friendly, and super fast.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,13,10,3,AaMiCBSAU0LAnyfjK00yMg

When someone did, she came over and just asked for my order, no apology or explanation. I ordered a spam musubi and salmon avocado roll and I got them pretty quick. The rice for the spam musubi was SOUR and everything else was at room temperature. The salmon was bland and tasteless amongst the mountain of rice on the edges (which fell apart immediately). Overall, the food wasn't terrible but I would not go back. 

Also as a side note, it was very confusing hearing someone sing in Japanese towards the front of the place and then Mexican country music in the kitchen...",ypoqEGkzObJdgwYomgCFPQ,0,0,1,XVNbf_HHlY03g1CJ3_Fprw

5918942,2015-04-08,9,NEZCr0zLIPNYWNF57KsJJQ,"Reasonably priced Japanese casual restaurant serving simple sushi, rolls, bentos and rice bowls on the East side of Las Vegas.

I decided to check them out after seeing their Groupon promotion.  It is located in a not too busy strip mall in the part of town I have never visited until coming here.  But it is not that far from the Wynn, just straight down East Desert Inn Road.

Their menu is simple, but still offers a fair selection, plus their specials board has more tempting offers.  You can drop in and order food al la carte to eat on premise or as takeout, they also provide catering services for larger orders.

On my 2 visits, I was pretty much the only customer there, so you will likely never have to wait for an open table if you decide to dine in.  Plus the service was friendly, the entire place (including the restroom) is kept tidy and clean.  And the food order came out reasonably fast.  The food is relatively healthy too, it is not the highest quality Japanese food available in Las Vegas, but for the price and the part of town, it is more than adequate.

Thus far I have tried their Katsu Curry Special (the curry is just the plain curry sauce without any potatoes, carrots, etc.) which has a decent portion and also their Okame Udon (with tofu skin, shrimp tempura, Japanese fish cake and seaweed toppings) and a side of Tuna Roll. Everything was acceptably yummy and fits my diet's macros.  As far as desserts, I don't recall seeing it on their wall menu, which is good, since I didn't need the extra temptation of oh so sweet but alas empty calories.

Bonus for Food Network fans, the TV is always on that channel. So you can eat and watch whatever happens to be on at the moment and maybe get some inspiration of what to eat next.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,10,14,4,KIdPdM5F2MRxDCSX67oJNA
