Awesome baseball memorabilia if you're into nostalgia like that....but most importantly, price, food and service. It's an authentic diner that has a sports bar just separated from a nice dining area if you want it quiet or have kids. We were treated really great by the server, Jazmin.

88423,2016-12-24,0,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,I was out delivering presents today and stop at home plate to get something to eat. I ordered a double cheeseburger with avocado and the sriracha french fries. James the bartender took my order and told me it was a big burger and I told him I had a big appetite. When the burger showed up I look at it and realize I would not be able to eat all of it because it was such a big burger. To my surprise the burger was the best burger I've ever eaten and the fries were even better than I expected. I figured I'd eat as much of it as I could but to my surprise I ate all of it and was stuffed. I live on the westside about 19 miles away and I will find reasons to go back to the home plate because the food and the service was top-notch. I challenge anybody and everybody to find a better Burger than they have at home plate. If I could give them 10 Stars I would.,yPLTSeI0m9rDDa53NzWG2g,0,0,5,tV7cIJiGCIeXXMN7JykCfA

DRINK: This is a great bar to go to late nights or during sports games to just chill and drink. Offer all the basic alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

FOOD: The food here tastes ten times better than what it looks like. I was hesitant to order food, but I'm glad I did. I highly recommend the beef sliders to everyone. The meat is very moist, tasty grilled onions is included, and the bun has the perfect texture. They have very good pizza on their menu. The shrimp scampi is made to perfection and has a large portion.

ATMOSPHERE: It looks like any other bar, but the customers and workers make this place fun. The bar tender and chef were super friendly. Great place to go to on a Saturday night:)",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,5,5,5,-He_HcJsVXEwOGuLWVUBLw

1698641,2016-03-31,4,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"My friend  and I came into this bar because of the reviews they received. So, we decided to check the place out since they changed the name. We came in for a few drinks and some food. When we walked in, the bar was full, so we figured we'd just sit at a booth/table. we were excited to try this place out plus it was busy so it must be popular. Well, we sat at a booth in plain sight 2 tables down from this other big party. My friend and I chatted for 10 minutes then I thought, geez is there a waitress ? And as soon as I said that she walked around the corner, I was looking her way but she just totally ignored me, I said, ""excuse me"" and she turned and went the other way. I decided to wait a bit longer, another 15 minutes went by. Still nothing. So my friend got up and grabbed menus herself from the side of the bar. We sat there for another 15 minutes, with no one acknowledging our presences. Then we got upset, my friend had to go to the bar and ask if anyone was going to serve us and they said, oh, we thought you were taken care of? ........ Really? We've been here for 40 minutes with not one person making eye contact with us and nothing but a menu on the table. That was the most annoying part, the 40minute wait. But after we ordered the food, it came out quickly and was fine. Then my friend asked for another beer and she left and forgot about it, she had to ask the bartender to get her another beer. Well finally they brought out one for me and one for her, even though I didn't want another one. She said she assumed that since my friend wanted one so did I. I told her no, but then she said it was already poured so it's fine. I thanked her, because that was kind. When it's was time to leave we asked for separate checks, I told her what was mine and she said, ""I remember"". So the first check was messed up. The second  time was also messed up, she charged me for 2 beers even though it was supposed to be one. She said she'd fix it again, but I was over it at this point. I guess you have to sit at the bar if you want service. I had wings and it was good. The service was not so great, like at all.",dhVxOfKeUZDsi6S5IUb3CQ,5,3,2,4d3PE270Q_klgbQhBgyGOA

The food (I had wings) i thought was well presented and very good in taste. The pizza which someone near me had ordered smelled amazing and made me wish i ordered one as well.

The service here was pretty attentive and that is getting rarer these days.

The machines gave me a fair amount of play instead of just quickly soaking up my money.....that makes for a fun time.

2367403,2017-09-22,5,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"Well this was a unique experience to put it simply. Located just off Las Vegas blvd behind the boot barn is this sports themed dive bar/resteraunt. Upon walking in you can choose to go left or right. The left door takes you to the dinning room with a glass wall that separates from the bar area, which is thru the right door.

In either room there are tv's posted with the latest game on and sports memorabilia as wall decor. Now the concept of having a separate dining space is a great idea! If it didn't stink of smoke.

I sat at an off kilter table, for the night we ordered a very dry Philli cheese steak with fries and a obviously canned corn beef and hash plate. Towards the end of our meal we were given a ticket for a raffle. I don't know if we won anything as we left when a loud screeching came on the intercom and lasted until we left. Apparently that happens EVERYTIME they try to switch from music to a hand held microphone. (I attached a video for your audio pleasure. Turn the volume down on your device...)

So take this place for what it is, low brow dive bar. If you like that and dont have high expectations then it's fine. If you expect a little more quality Outback Steakhouse is right down the street.",JktkPizuRAA32z-m1UCsBw,7,4,2,tGZHbN78nUysWS9je-G-pA

I have been wanting to check this spot ever since it opened.  Today, I brought my 2 kids to eat in the dining room.  Our server, Elaine, was so friendly- great personality,  checked on us regularly, and even paid special attention to my toddler (that seriously means so much when we're eating out).

I ordered a beer,  chicken noodle soup,  French fries, Gabriel's Grilled Lamb Chops, and zappolis for dessert. 

Beer- Stella on draft. Cold and satisfying

Chicken noodle soup- homemade! Shredded chicken, carrots, celery, and noodles. YUMMY

French Fries- just like fresh Boardwalk fries. So good.  I had to ask for malt vinegar just to make it official :)

And now, let's talk about the Lamb Chops. First of all, I try lamb chops everywhere I go.  These were by far the best lamb chops I've had in a very long time! I ordered them medium rare with mashed potatoes. I just bit right into them and my eyes rolled to the back of my head.  Awesome. They were perfectly seasoned,  tender and just plain delicious.  The sautéed veggies and mashed potatoes went so well with everything. 

Zappolis- just like little funnel cakes at the carnival!

Since it was still early, we decided to get something to eat.  I did a quick Yelp search and found Home Plate Grill & Bar.  I was kinda hesitant to bring my 7 year old daughter to a restaurant that has ""bar"" on the name but looking at the reviews, lots of patrons and their kids frequent this place.  We got there at 9:30am and we were the only ones and when we got done at 11am, we were still the only ones. 

Service was great (I guess it has to be since we were the only ones there), place was clean and they have a separate seating area for the restaurant and one for the bar.  We ordered the following non-breakfast items:

Linguini & Clams ($15): great flavor, lots of pasta, clams and garlic.  I really enjoyed this dish.

Winning Inning Wings ($9): Huge meaty wings, my daughter really liked them.  They came with French fries, carrots and celery. 

Milk ($3): huge glass of milk, it was easily in a 10oz cup.

I won't go back.  damn near ended up in an altercation tonight because someone in my party played a goofy song on the juke box.  Bartenders skipped it (which is OK) but they got shitty about it and so did some of the patrons (defending the bartenders).  The whole thing was bad.  I watched it from the side.  shitty bartenders with an attitude.  I liked them up until now.  I guess it only took a little bit for them to show themselves.  Totally uncalled for.  If you can't handle a little goofiness then you're in the wrong business in a late night bar.  Put that together with the last review and this place is a loser.  DO NOT go here.  I've been going to this place for years and WILL NOT go back.  I'll find somewhere else where customers are valued over gaming.  While most of the bartenders and servers are great, the atmosphere is getting worse and worse.  This was always ""my place"" but it isn't anymore.  don't go here.  Just sad that I've lost my ""go to"" place.

Like this place. I was a DIE-HARD Repete's customer and loved the food and service. The new establishment is good. The service has been great. Mary Anne and Alexis have been amazing. Love them. 

I spend a significant amount of time here. I love to work here. Pull my laptop out and put in some time. However, the owners girlfriend (the Bar Ambassador) is a bit much. She may be the one reason I wouldn't go back. I don't like to be touched and cornered into conversation. I like to go to this place because it's got a great atmosphere and is easy going. She makes it hard to enjoy. She is a cloud over the place. Otherwise, the staff is amazing and so friendly. I love them all

3226862,2016-05-23,1,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"As a ""regular"" of the previous business that was here, I cannot believe this is what is replacing it!  It seems like the old Screwballs crowd had kids and they let them come here!  The bartenders I have come in contact with are awful, no personality, can't remember drink orders and not friendly.  There is one that is the graveyard bartender during the week and he is AMAZING! He is also from the old establishment.  
First time we were in one of the bartenders friends spilled a drink into the seat cushion of the bench seats and walked away from it blaming others for it.  It took about 15 minutes after they were made aware of this happening to clean it up.  Food was ok, we figured it wouldn't be too different since they kept one of the two chefs(who I now hear is also leaving, he is a chef, not just a cook).  
I had been to the old Home Plate and loved it, mostly because people were friendly, said hi when you came in, remember what you drink from round to round and asked how you are doing.  Now it seems I need to be under 30 years old to get anyone's attention.  
We stopped in this past weekend on Saturday and was SHOCKED at how a passed out drunk gentleman was treated while sitting at the bar.
First of all, how did he get that drunk in your bar?  He was able to order food(it was ordered and arrived while we got there) but unable to stay awake when it came. The bartender had to shake him to wake him and only asked that he move over to a table away from the gaming. Cashed out his machine and gave him the money but wanted him to eat at a table. He was awake and eating with his eyes closed.  Then he wanted to put in money to play again, the bartender stopped him and asked him to leave.  Where is he going, into his vehicle?? Seriously?!?! It took the customers to get this to go the right way.  Our friend stopped him from getting into his vehicle, nicely of course, and was going to set up Uber on his dime to get this guy home.  A customer at the bar stood up and said ""I'm an Uber driver, I'll take him home""  Whether that was true or not, I believe it was and the gentleman paid his bill and took the guy home.  No help was offered by the bar to call a cab or any kind of ride for this guy.  Just wanted to send I'm out.
There are plenty of other places to go and unfortunately, this is no longer one of mine. Will anxiously await what comes next in that spot...",3dCJZ8PV1iTmMZy-1bF7cA,3,2,1,tXQlWbLNFGfDwRa5RXDfmQ

The person I spoke with, I believe her name is Shannon, was not pleasant on the phone at all, she was kind of rude, in fact. She also coughed really gnarly right into the phone and didn't even say excuse me... how gross. I can just imagine her coughing her way through the kitchen as she packed up my food. 

When I came to pick up, I stood at the bar for a good 10 minutes all while she ignored me. I just watched her walk back and forth about 4 times and it seemed like she deliberately did not want to lift her head up to look at me, until I waved and gave her a ""WTF"" look. She said ""Your stuff is over there."" I'm like... ""WHERE dude? Where over there?"" ..""Other side of the bar"". No greeting, no smile, nothing. Just pointing to the other end of the bar. 
Ok.... so I walk to the other side and she hands me my check back without any eye contact. 
I understand that it was early, on a week day, but I did not feel welcome or taken care of by this person. 

The food: This part was awesome and delicious. Everyone enjoyed the goodies and we had an awesome lunch together right before a loong weekend.

4219845,2016-10-19,0,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"I dropped by Home Plate in search of a hearty brunch before my drive back to Orange County. They had a list of brunch specials, all under $8 and in plentiful portions, as well as the rest of the menu, which included traditional breakfast fare, pastas, sandwiches, and pizza.

I ended up ordering something totally strange (chicken alfredo), and the waitress gave me a face that indicated as much. I should have followed her expression, because the alfredo sauce ended up being rather bland. The chicken was also cooked interestingly - it seems like it might have been poached? There were no cook marks so it was hard to tell. Still, the meal satisfied what I was craving - I had undereaten the night before AND overdrank, so I wanted carby goodness. I also can't blame anyone for my weirdly ordering chicken alfredo at 10 AM, you know?

With all that said, I'll be honest, I love the vibe here. I love the bar separate from the dining area, which means you can dine without all that cigarette smoke. I loved the waitress, who was so very kind - treated me like I was a regular, lots of good-natured vibing. I wish I had caught her name; I only remember that she was a bit older. I'd return just for her.

Oh, and the fact that this place is off-strip and in fact on the way out of town? Perfect. The driving was easy, the parking easier, and the prices exactly what they needed to be.

I have to be honest here, I really enjoyed the old location very much. I went to the new location I guess expecting something similar, boy was I let down. 

Now In fairness the food was every bit as good as it was. But the place is far from the family friendly place it was. The place is first and for most a bar, with a small area sectioned off for dining. 
The tables are small and the look is very sterile. Not warm at all. No games for the kids and to be honest I  would not bring my grand daughter here. 

It's suppose to be smoke free in this area but they leave the door to the connecting hallway open so the room is full of smoke. The staff was very friendly, but slow on recognizing when you come into the restaurant portion. The bar area was a lot bigger and had some nice decorations much like the old location. 

I know for myself I won't be back and it's a shame I really liked the place before.",r2wK-bxWTIRTupmbOcrEWg,0,0,2,wXQu0uYAXKSjyrSgpbfScw
5133490,2016-08-06,0,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"It's definitely a restaurant for the locals.  We walked in and they had two doors once you step in.  One seemed to be the bar and the other was the seating area.  No one was at the front so we sat ourselves.  Minutes after the waitress came in and gave us the menus. We asked for water, she only brought us 2 waters and nothing for my toddler son.  She checked in on us, but it wasn't great service. The smoking smell is very penetrated from the bar area and in goes into the dining area.  I couldn't wait to be out of the restaurant.",Ho8S87v8PEeqVJbA40gGuw,0,0,3,oFSny69Pm_fCEijkoZc4Og

They have a great beer selection, plenty of gaming machines and a lot of tvs for the sports fan in you.  We decided to have dinner here and we were very happy with the food.   The bartender and food servers were very pleasant and quick with our orders.",keBv05MsMFBd0Hu98vXThQ,0,1,5,DFT3dF7XOBZE5WbISRqCuQ

5214953,2016-10-22,0,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"So I stopped in late night last night because I really couldn't sleep after laying my head down.  Machines played a little tight at first but then I left even.

Nice open floor plan in bar.  The TV's are huge!  Really nice picture with a very good sound system.  This would be a really great place to watch any game you wanted to come out and see.

The menu is pretty extensive.  They have a restaurant separated from the bar.  So no need to worry about smoke while you are eating.  Menu had everything from Pizza to a pretty large appetizer menu that they promote for Happy Hour.  I went with the garlic knots and they were pretty good.  Nice and hot and just enough garlic.

You can't miss them just west of Las Vegas boulevard on Warm Springs!  Give them a shot!",1T-rePv-lLJDO5gVGFyfFQ,0,1,4,t3iNERjWC_b9N4To91ogfQ

5690265,2016-07-06,1,lLMJsTchKYF1O0fpNWpCRA,"There's a whole world of food options in Vegas and once you've visited a few times and gotten past the celebrity restaurants on the Strip, that's where the real options begin.  Home Plate is one of these options, way off the Strip and where the locals eat.  I know because a local took me here and described it as one of her favorite places.

It's a great combination of sports bar and 24 hour restaurant, with slots and video poker, because it is Vegas after all. The menu is super-expansive with a variety of appetizers, burgers, wings, pizza, sandwiches, and breakfast.

As for the food, VERY good.  I had the Jack Daniels chicken wings which had a sweet taste with a slight bite.  The cheese pizza was also cooked to perfection.  My friend had the bacon cheeseburger which she raved about.  The burger was also as big as I've seen a burger in quite a while and the toppings were obviously high quality.

Do yourself a favor if you need to eat in Vegas -- avoid the hassle of the Strip and eat a better meal for less money....",s75d8PSqVbCJtclvBdne3Q,4,3,5,uaBcgHRixThKBv749mxgww
