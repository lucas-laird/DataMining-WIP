A fresh, hot piccadilly pizza reminds me of how Chuck e cheeses pizza used to taste in the past (once was my favorite fast food pizza but now terrible)! But the dough needs to be cooked more...I found myself throwing away most of the dough (though I liked the taste).

It's great to get a blast from the past! I would only eat here though if the pizza looks like it just came out of the oven...because these need to be eaten HOT! 

Minus one because it's super expensive at $3.50 for a small slice...but hey, it is a tourist area. It doesn't make it right but it makes it understandable. It just means I won't frequent it unless I have a craving.",fHOBGmtI1VdGKWIxrFH0kA,0,0,4,fRXUZqvsbLf0stsZak8XSQ

Trust me, this joint was empty for good reason.  

This place is just awful.  I don't know what brand of frozen pizza they toss in the microwave to serve their patrons, but I can assure you it's on the low-end of the freezer-section pizza spectrum.

What a waster.
Found myself pleasantly buzzed on Fremont Street, watching its famous light show above when a hunger came on.
Approached a few police officers and asked if there was a place to get a decent slice in the area.
They said sure, Piccadilly's down the block.
Now I don't know if this is the ONLY place to get a slice in the area or if they actually think it's good...(or perhaps, they just like to mess with tourists).
Walked up to the counter, saw they had a display case full of pies with slices ready to go and behind said case were a couple of ovens. 
So what did I expect?
Not unlike every other pizza joint that's set up the same way, I expected to order the slice, they throw it in the oven for a few minutes to heat and crisp it up, I eat the slice.
Didn't quite go that way.
Instead, I ordered the slice, they took it out of the display case, put it on a paper plate, and handed it to me.
This sorry, luke-warm, excuse barely retained the properties to accurately be called pizza.
It was a decently sized slice, I'll give'em that. 
It was when I folded it in half to make a bite more manageable that I realized just how shite it was. 
This thing coulda been rolled up into a cannoli it was so flimsy.
I wager I could have went to Walgreens, purchased a frozen Tony's pizza, slapped that sucker on Las Vegas Blvd for a few hours and let the sun bake it and it would have been a better option.

The first night we ordered a large pepperoni pizza to go when we got to our room we devoured it. Yes we have been drinking and we were hungry but it just seemed like it was really good. So the next day when we went to downtown in the afternoon we stopped and had just a slice of pizza. We were sober and again this pizza was just amazing for us. My slice seemed a little greasy this time around but it was still good. So again on the next night after walking downtown we stopped again at 1 in the morning and ordered a whole pizza to go when we got to our room we were just as satisfied.

It may not be the best pizza I've ever had but it is definitely in my top 3. I would definitely go back again even if it is three times in one weekend lol. Oh and by the way customer service was whatever but it didn't bother me.
