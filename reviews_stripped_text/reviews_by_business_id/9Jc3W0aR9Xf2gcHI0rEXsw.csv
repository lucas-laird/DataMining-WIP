It's been hours and I still can't get the nasty fish taste out of my mouth. My ten year old nephew (whose standards are low) made a face when he tried the steak and my friend couldn't eat more than a bite of the baked potato. In all:  horrible. 

The ""steak"" had an off flavor and the texture of rubber. The fish appeared to have been microwaved and the glaze ladled on, which is nothing like what the description or photo described.  
 
Also, the long island iced tea I got was acceptable but my friends margarita on the rocks was all salt and sour mix and undrinkable.

1289045,2010-08-09,0,9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw,"For $12.99, they offer an All You Can Eat Prime Rib deal. At first, I didn't believe my dad because I thought we were gonna eat at the steak house in Circus Circus, NOT Garden Grill. Plus, no where on the menu does it state its all you can eat, but we did ask the waitress and YES, for $12.99 you have all you can eat prime rib.

So as for the food quality, it was actually pretty good. Prime Rib is hard to cook for most places I visit. For me, I prefer Medium-rare for my meats and this place cooked it just right. THAT, or it wasn't cooked enough? Some places just even over cook medium rare. So I was pretty impressed. As for the sides, I got mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. After devouring everything on my plate, I had asked for another slice. So keep in mind, they bring out another slice of meat that is tiny and that's it ( as in no sides included). It makes sense, you'd probably get filled up with the first slice. 

As for the service, I was NOT very impressed. The waitress was not very attentive. My mom also simply asked if there was soup or salad and so we asked if it was included. The bus person asked the waitress and she came back over and we asked her, ""so is it included"" and she said ""yes"" and asked what we had wanted. Her facial expression was just not very friendly, and she seemed a tad impatient. Also, it took a while for her to come around and ask if things were alright and to also refill our waters. 

Overall, I give this place really a 2.5/3 stars. For the price and the first round, the prime rib was decent. As for the second round and service, it brought down their score. Would I recommend this place for friends staying in Vegas? Well, I would sort of recommend this place, ONLY if you were staying at Circus Circus or near the the end of the main strip. Other then that, I wouldn't bother as you have many other places to check out with better services. But remember, you get what you pay for. Great price for the Prime Rib but not great for the service. Happy eating.",i5IzRJLwLU9GfZYCFJEbTA,1,0,3,S6fKUPeBzbBiR-8onUnr8A

Decent-sized pieces cooked as ordered (med rare means med rare)!  A little fatty, but with all-you-can-eat, it's not like it mattered.  Came with sides, too (potatos/fries, salad, bread), but we all know that's just filler.

Second round:  I was more amused than annoyed that the quality went down.  Really, what do you expect?  The steaks were half the thickness and seemed micro-waved rather than grilled.  These steaks were more the standard I was expecting for the $12.99 a-y-c-e Circus Circus place.  Bet the boys wished they hadn't played Steak with their 1st round.

Found this place while flipping through one of the Vegas magazines while there last February. My husband wanted prime rib, and the ad for ALL YOU CAN EAT prime rib caught my eye. We headed over there on a Thursday night around 5:30 and was seated immediately. 

We decided to order the $10 pitcher of margarita (strawberry or lime, and only blended, it comes from a machine) and the buffalo wings ($9.50 for 7 wings and no comparison to WingStop!) for an appetizer. In hindsight, we shouldn't have ordered the buffalo wings, since we were trying to stuff our faces with ALL YOU CAN EAT prime rib :) 

We ordered the prime rib dinner for $15.99 and it came with really yummy steamed string beans and garlic mash potatoes. The side dishes are NOT interchangeable, but it is what it is :) It was yummy. The first prime rib we ordered was THICK and HUGE and very well cooked. The crust was deliciously cooked, and the center was moist. (Hubs and I both ordered medium rare). The au jus was yummy, but the creamy horseradish was not as spicy as we would have liked. It didn't clear my sinuses at all! We ordered a second helping, but the second slice was not as thick, but it was still juicy and delish. The waitress that we had said that we couldn't get ""refills"" on the side dishes... bummer. 

Tax and tip totaled $60. 

We loved it so much that we went a second night :) This time it was on Saturday night. The restaurant doors opened at 5pm for dinner, and there were quite a few people already in line. We were able to get in, and order our dinner pretty quickly, since we knew what we wanted :) We passed this time on any drinks and just ordered water since we didn't finish the pitcher of margarita the previous time, and the sodas were $5! I think for a regular glass of margarita it was $5. Not too shabby, but still we were going for cheap this time around. This time, the waiter that we had gave us an option to get refills on our side dishes. For our second helping, he brought us a brand new dish filled with sides and a nice helping of prime rib. Round three was the same thin slice of prime rib, but it was still yummers :)

Not cool Circus Circus, not cool! LOL. So we had to wait. Until 4 pm. When we were no longer drunk, but very, very buzzed. And I will be perfectly honest. They were some pretty decent wings. A little pricey as far as wings are concerned, but still well worth it. They are a little over a buck a wing and get a little cheaper the more you order. 

We ordered a platter of 30 to share between 4 people and opted for the Garlic Parmesan, Spicy Buffalo and the not so spicy Chipotle Citrus Barbeque flavored wings. Wings were big, and nicely cooked. Not overly sauced. Could have eaten about 30 of them myself. Everybody else said the same thing. In this case, the pictures did do them justice because they tasted and looked as good as they did in the pictures, so now we know that it just wasn't the booze playing tricks on us and we'd definitely go back to eat wings should we choose to stay or visit someone with a room at the Circus Circus.

The only negative for this visit was the Sangria. I should have know it wasn't going to be that great when I saw the bartender pouring a bottle of a burgundy liquid into the blender and then adding shots to it. No fruit in it, and no flavor.

I'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they're really what earned the single star, because they were sweet, but the food was just horrible.

I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or ""real"" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, ""Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?"" He said it was ""good"". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!

My husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.

I asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.

Of course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another. I got regular fries, instead of sweet potato (didn't bother complaining, because I got the free salad, so whatever...like I said, nice server!) My husband's food was fine, although nothing special. They were good with the refills of our drinks.

Anyway, as nice as the servers were, it wasn't good. I would avoid eating here if I could.",nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ,0,0,1,QgSf2JvYz-M4PU2yuJjxNQ

I was honestly very surprised when I got a delicious, simple meal from this place. Customers order at the counter and receive a number, and then the food is delivered to your table. There was plenty of seating and the space seemed decently clean. The menu is simple, they offer items like: burgers, wings, fries, a few salads, sandwiches, etc. Typical fountain drink selection is offered as far as beverages go. I ordered a cheeseburger and cheese fries (because I obviously love cheese) I expected both items to be lacking and bland. Well, I was pleasantly surprised and happy to say I was very wrong! The burger was very good, rich in flavor, and quite filling. I couldn't even finish it! The cheese fries were incredible. It was beautifully melted ALL OVER the fries, which almost never happens when I order cheese fries. The food was so rich and creamy that I couldn't finish more than a small portion of it.

I ordered the 12 oz New York Steak.  My wife ordered the 12 oz Prime Rib, and my 9 year old daughter ordered the crustless PB&J with fries.  We also ordered a $10 pitcher of frozen margaritas.

First the bad news about this place:  Both cuts of meat were ordered medium rare and both cuts of meat were overcooked. My steak was medium to medium well.  The prime rib was medium.  Also, I think tequila was involved in the making of the frozen margaritas, but I'm not really sure.

The good news about this place:  Both cuts of meat were of good quality and were flavorful  even though overcooked.  The veggies and potatoes were also good.  My daughter scarfed down the PB&J and declared it good.  Also the service was good, although I thought it odd that different people brought drinks and food.  Probably a union thing.

Price with tax and tip:  $63.00.

Would I eat here again?  Maybe.  I'm not really sure.  If I do go back, I'll have a more precise conversation about the level of  cooking on the meat.",RBVx19UH3A6QRKxi5tBaDQ,1,1,3,L0RwcY74-5ZrkUQG3lhCLg
5657932,2011-07-10,0,9Jc3W0aR9Xf2gcHI0rEXsw,"Eeehhhh, this restaurant isn't all that great. Pretty cheap in my opinion which gave this rating an A-OK 3 star rating. Me and the wifey ordered a 3 tower sampler which was more than enough to fill us up. The sampler consisted of chili cheese fries (top plate tower), 3 wing flavored chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, and popcorn shrimp (middle tower), onion rings and a cheese quesadilla (bottom tower). As you can see it was more than plenty of food. 

What I didn't like about the food was the taste, first off the chili cheese fries was just to much for me to handle after eating everything else on the plate so it wasn't very satisfying to eat when I was already getting full. The chicken wings were alright, flavor-wise the honey bbq was just flat out gross. The popcorn shrimp tasted like frozen food that was just quickly fried (something you just whip up after buying it frozen at a local grocery market). The mozzarella sticks were just old regular cheese sticks, nothing to fancy about those. Onion rings were huge but flavorless, and the cheese quesadilla was probably the best thing out of all of e'm and that too didn't taste as great as it probably would of with chicken or beef in it.

All in all, service wasn't that great either. Took forever for us to get our check, but not like he was being mean to us or it was packed, it just took long for no apparent reason. Thank goodness the food was cheap other-wise this place would get a 2 star for it's food and service.",TBEiWGQoVXCq5sYuOzeBkw,1,0,3,V2m_KNRyfpRjvf_pho865w
