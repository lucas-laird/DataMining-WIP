Sadly after receiving my order it ended up being just pieces of pulled corned beef and by no means traditional hash. The eggs were of the powdered variety and has no flavor. They do give you a tremendous amount of food so clearly they are going for the quantity not quality angle.

58404,2014-03-27,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"When you're spending $20 for a breakfast, you have rather high expectations. Mine weren't met. Yes, this is at a resort hotel, but $20 bucks for bacon and eggs and some fruit is rather steep, so it must be because the service and food are first rate.... They're not.  

The service was good but normal, and somewhat rushed for a half-filled restaurant. It was typical breakfast service, by a traditional breakfast hash-slinger.

The food was adequate, but not spectacular. Eggs are eggs everywhere, so nothing special. The bacon was spartan but really good. The crispy potatoes were simply divine. I also ordered an additional serving of fruit, and was expecting more than the small bowl of exactly 5 pieces of fresh fruit I got for $4. For jam, they serve this chutney-like mango or apricot concoction. Missed the actual fruit name. It was flavorless and bad, and if you're looking for another flavor of jarred jam, you have to ask for it, and wait for it's arrival. Toast now cold. I ordered my toast's butter on the side, and it was practically frozen, and NEVER melted on the bread. 

My biggest disappointed came when I ordered a side of a pancake, and was told I couldn't. I had to choose from the full breakfast of pancakes. The pancakes here are enormous, and only wanted an ala carte side pancake...BUT NO!! My request was not going to be accommodated, in a restaurant fully capable of doing so. What BS. If a customer wants something....make it for them...

I ALREADY ORDERED A FULL BREAKFAST, AND JUST WANTED ONE PANCAKE ON THE SIDE. It's truly dumb of a restaurant not to make this option available as an add-on with a full breakfast, thus losing a customer forever. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.

Hash House a Go Go is definitely a No No for me next time in Vegas. The food and service are good, but that's all. It's just breakfast food, and not spectacular, nor all that inventive either. Can't see the price justification. Don't waste your time, unless you enjoy being ripped off..",XX6sfOfklJYA7kzr3lyrTw,1,1,2,dpqV09Hq8yoRpzM2D8QHng

When our food arrived, I had to ask for my coffee again since our original server did not bring it.  When I finally tasted the food, the biscuits were dried and stale. The decorative dots of chipotle sauce on the plate were dried up, and the Benedict sauce was also hardened on the outside. Not sure if the issue was the good or the server who left our food waiting for too long.

However is the food size and quality makes it completely worth it. I recommend you split a plate if you are visiting because it will just go to waste if you can't take it back to your hotel room. I had their version of the Reuben sandwich and that was some of the best corned beef I've ever had.  my friend had the banana pancake; imagine Bananas Foster with pancake batter for it over the top of it into a 12 inch skillet 1"" thick size of heaven.
I would have gave it 5 stars easily but service was pretty bad we only got our drinks once we never got offered refills. Our server was very persistent in upselling certain items. He made it very obvious that they were trying to sell specific menu items today.  The food did come out fast and you could certainly tell it. Was made from scratch. I highly recommend this place if you come to Vegas. Just maybe try one of the other locations.

340940,2015-08-12,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"Second time in this location.  Frequent the location on Sahara. Food and service always top notch, the Rio location, quite the antithesis. Coincidently, both times here my same friend and I were waited on by Laura. First time she was less than friendly and short, this morning she was flat out rude and borderline hateful. No exaggeration. I ordered the salmon biscuits( as usual ) this time I asked for salmon on the side instead of on top. Simple right? Her reply, ""Nope sorry can't do that."" I explained that I don't want extra or anything taken out just simply on the side instead of on top. Her reply, "" Nope! Nope! We can't do that we are a franchise store and we have to make everything the exact same way.""  No sorry. No let me check on that for you no courtesy and no respect. Her tone was loud enough that the booth next to us all stopped their convo and was into ours with Laura. I know they can't add or sub at this place, neither of which I was asking for, but was very rudely denied!  I knew the policies of this place as I eat here frequently! This was simply a case of a rotten attitude and an extremely condescending disposition. From go she was not polite and had us waiting when the place was bare @ 9am. I know when I'm being judged and I was.  My friend and I had work out clothes on and shades and baseball caps and apparently it was off putting to Laura. Or maybe it was our smell. We smelt of roses and Lilacs. Or maybe it was our hair, we had ponytails. I wouldn't dare believe for one second she assumed we were going to share the plate and didn't want to accommodate my needs. And I would fall off a cliff before I believe it was because of the color of our skin. Either way, I was so so upset at the way I was treated by her. I can't explain the anger and frustration of her condescending attitude towards us. I spoke with Michael who was the Starbucks manager and let him know of my experience and he listened and agreed she was wrong for denying us our request and pretty much just stood there. He saw I was frustrated and my friend was very calm and polite as was I but I was on the verge of tears. As they fell I walked away and said good day.  I couldn't take it. My morning had already been ruined by this sour woman and no apologies were made. The manager listened but may as well been a suggestion box. This type of behavior and blatant denial of service should be addressed immediately and rectified to at least some of the customers satisfaction and it was not. I walked off in tears. The Rio should know that their employees can make a local with a sevens card never walk foot into the Rio again, and I won't.",D1aUZmN0AUZBOJ25DWHtLA,0,0,1,pRJPHIe2BWyVfvO9G-1ftQ

358398,2016-03-02,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"god, where do I start? my wife and I normally choose not to eat at corporate restaurants, but when you're stuck in a las vegas hotel, there is nothing else.  we were seated promptly and we each ordered a different hash; she, the ""famous"" meatloaf hash, I, corned beef hash and a $3.99, upsell, side of gravy. our food arrived before we had drunk even half a cup of some pretty good coffee. 
ladies first. my wife's ""hash"" consisted of cubes of meatloaf, a wad of red peppers, a handful of uncooked spinach and some half melted white cheese served over a pile of old soggy steam table potato cubes. other than a quick minute under the broiler to melt the cheese, it appeared as though nothing had been really cooked together. I found the meatloaf to be tasteless as well.
as for the corned beef hash, the same nasty potatoes appeared as the base, over which they had strewn long tough strings of tasteless corned beef held in a wad by some melted swiss? cheese. any chef should know to cut corned beef across the grain to make it tender. I have never seen corned beef served this way. and hope never to again.
the biscuits were beautiful, high and golden. but were cold as a witches heart. the $3.99 side of sausage gravy... where I'm from gravy has always been somewhat liquid. but not at hash house a go go. try to run your biscuit through it and the biscuit just crumbles.
I got the attention of a manager, I believe his name was mr. dean, and told him of my thoughts on our breakfasts. like a true company trained manager he took the $3.99 side of gravy off our $45.00 bill. he agreed that it should have been liquid.
so, $41.05 (plus tip) later, I received another lesson in corporate restaurant incompetence. without employees who truly care about the customer, and who take pride in doing their job, one will face long odds of getting served a good meal when dining out.",w2fTSvm29Lhzoa6teMT-Uw,0,0,1,v-_jy8C63mxkPkN3GcoZqQ

We asked the hostess  if we could sit in the booth, there were two open at the end of a bank of six. .no!  She rudely said.  That section is closed.  Who the hell divides a section on the middle of a bank of booths?  And seriously that doesn't make sense to a customer who sees booths open and is offered a crappy table. Ok.  Fine crappy table.

It wasnt fresh... it was extremely bland and even with the help of salt nothing changed. My potatoes were not cooked recently, don't know how long they had been sitting around but they weren't crispy nor did they taste like anything. Yeah they put my skillet in the oven and maybe my eggs were fresh out of the bottle but that's it.

We joined in and were seated fairly quickly.  I ordered a bacon waffle, declining the waiters instruction to take the more expensive chicken & waffle.  It had very little flavor, and the strips of bacon inserted crosswise inside were flavorless. The only taste came from the powdered sugar and syrup.  My friend had the chorizo hash. He was not at all impressed saying the flavor was ok but the dish just average and the chorizo came as not nearly small enough cubes mixed in looking more like too- large cubes of ham. It was mild bland chorizo with little flavor.  The food came out of the kitchen quick enough. My request for an iced tea refill was acknowledged by the waiter who subsequently passed by 4-5 times without delivering. We ended up having to flag down the neighboring waiter to ask for the bill and left minus the refill, but with no intent on returning. Absolutely have no reason to return.

976044,2018-02-05,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"I had searched for 'best fried chicken' in Vegas and, lo and behold, Hash House A Go Go popped up as a top rated place for their sage chicken. Amazingly enough, it happened to be in my hotel so I planned on stopping in for breakfast one morning prior to a conference. 

I sat at the already crowded bar and enjoyed the company. I was warned before I ordered that there was no way to finish all of the food that they gave you.  That proved correct. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles since I'd heard their sage chicken was delicious. When the food came out, there were two huge breaded airline chicken breasts on top of four waffles which barely fit on the oversized plate. There were also fried leeks plus a spring of sage for presentation purposes but I ate one bite of the leeks and moved them to the side. 

As for the chicken, it was okay at best. I'll have to say, it was juicy, but the breading and spices were missing something. Even the syrup didn't help enough. Fortunately, the waffles turned out to be delicious. They were made with a piece of smoked bacon cooked right in and hanging out of the corners of the waffles. The bacon was very tasty and I wish I had an order of that separate. 

All that led to a 3-star rating.  If giant portions were the main criterion then it would be a 5-star kind of place. Unfortunately, I felt like the chicken was very average and not worth a repeat visit during my stay.",DxLHrCKiaWOHxBMDPGvuCQ,0,0,3,zXFyuERen2XiNsqNVbWfxw

I'm sure the casual diner will love the runny eggs, with juice oozing out of, but scrambled to me shouldn't be runny, so I was not a big fan of it at all. While I know that there's nothing worse than overcooked eggs, watery undercooked are not my thing so have that in mind.

Food: Good
- We ordered their chicken and waffles (can't remember the name of it at the moment) which was about $18-$19. It fed 2-3 people and was large. There were two chicken thighs and four bacon waffles. The chicken thighs were crispy on the outside and tasted like honey, but there was very little seasoning once you got past the skin.
- The waffles were decent and I definitely felt like my blood sugar was going to go up from all the honey and syrup on the plate. I definitely got my savory and sweet breakfast.

Location/Seating: Decent
- Very easy to find once you're at the hotel. We just followed the signs and asked a few people when we wanted faster directions.
- Plenty of seating. We came at 10am, was a party of 6, and we're seated immediately.
- A line started to form closer to lunch

If that wasn't bad enough, our food took over half an hour and when we got it, it was barely lukewarm!!!  The servers who brought us the food mentioned it was sitting in the kitchen for a while because there was no table number for it - a likely cause of why our food was cold.  We finally tracked down our waiter after 10 minutes but obviously weren't going to send the food back because it would have taken forever.  The waiter was nice enough to consult his manager and give us a discount on our meal but the damage was done.

It's hard to judge if the food is really that good here since everything we ate was pretty much cold.  The fried chicken had good flavor and was crispy but it would have tasted so much better hot.

- Also ordered a smores mocha, beautiful presentation really but super overpriced, I don't blame them for this cause it is casino price. 
- the chicken waffle: there's bacon inside the waffles which makes it really unique. I don't really know how to describe this but something about this dish taste ALMOST delicious, it's pretty lackluster. It's like there's too much something and not enough of something. My expression the whole time eating it's really to figure out how to describe the dish

I love breakfast food... So, when I found this place in the hotel we were staying at, I was quite excited. This isn't a place to go out of your way for, but when it's convenient, it's great.

We ordered family style, and ordered way too much. The three of us shared:

Chicken and Waffles ---- Yummy (not mind-blowing, but yummy nonetheless) and ridiculous in proportion (check out other peoples' photos to verify) and quite unique.

Side Salad --- Not sure what the dressing was, but it was good. Everything was fresh.

Healthy Breakfast, Egg White Omelette with Fruit --- Good, for healthy food.

My cousin also got a Bloody Mary. She really liked it; I never fancied the taste of tomato juice, especially spicy tomato juice, but she said it was really good. 

Service was OK. Nothing bad, except she could've been quicker on the water refills. I never hit bottom on my coffee because those refills came quickly, but the coffee was pretty much water to me. (Not terrible, but not amazing coffee, either)

Naturally, it was very noisy. Two people ordered coffee, one with cream. When she added the cream, it curdled in the coffee. She showed the coffee to a server and asked for a fresh cup. Apparently, they just poured out the old and used the same cup to add fresh and bring her a different container of cream because there was coffee on the side of the cup.

Things went down hill from there.  One person asked if it was possible to get an omlette and the server said, no, but they did have ""scrambles...and there wasn't any real difference"". Hmmmm.

And when that happens your palette will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong though, they are still good, but their tastes just don't match their presentations. The flavours are just not there. Another one of my big complaints is the cleanliness of their utensils. We arrive at the table as a party of six and I had to send back four of the six sets due to some food (like egg yoke) stains and finger prints found on the utensils. And the same things were found again in the new sets they replaced. This totally thrown me off - cleanliness is a big thing for me when I visit restaurants and hotels. And this definitely impacted my entire impression of this place.

The biscuits came with a sprig of Rosemary sticking out of them that was cute but the biscuits were so old and dense they could have easily replaced the metal wheel of the tractor they had in the lobby. The potatoes were horrible boil in a bag red skin potatoes thrown onto a flat top grill and left to die, zero flavor and instead of a nice golden brown they were very burned. The fruit that was so under ripe the butter knife would not cut through the honeydew melon. We left everything on our plates except for the eggs that we ate. The bloody marys were truly the worst we have had in years, I am not sure if the mix was old or perhaps they used dishwater instead but what a waste. The waitress asked us how is it, I told her it was terrible. She never replied or came back to the table and someone else dropped off the check.

Rio location is set quite a walk away from the main casino area & is closer to the usually quiet convention center space. 
Hours are limited to 6A-1P; so no late night dinners here.

There was no line when we came by on Sunday around 11AM...but when we were being seated, the hostess took us to a dirty table (without settings & dirty plates left behind). She quickly wiped up the mess & promptly left before we could tell her that one of the chairs had milk spilled on it. Unable to flag down one of the servers for help (none would make eye contact or acknowledge our current predicament), I took matters into my own hands & grabbed a chair from another empty (but dirty) table. 
The table we had was sticky in several spots and it took a considerable amount of time to notify a bus boy about it (it was acknowledged but no action was taken). Yet again, I got up and grabbed some napkins from the server stand to cover the mess.

Food met expectations, but extra care should have been taken to ensure proper utensils were provided...as I had to ask for a steak knife (for steak & eggs) and requested straws for our drinks (long after the server had dropped them off and promptly moved away to another table).

Overall: Decent location to have the Man V. Food portions of food we've all come to expect from HH...just try to eat here early..before the tables & seats get messed up.",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,2,1,2,Z6BHn1ugYBSA1y49FGAZoQ

1901515,2015-04-06,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"There are very few disaster scenarios where a positive thinker like myself would give a 1 star rating, let alone a 1 star rating to an outpost of one of my favorite restaurants.  As an executive who has to recruit top talent, if someone is visiting Vegas for breakfast - I typically would take them to the Sahara Hash House as my ""closing"" move.  But like everything else in the Rio, there is little redeeming value here (the lone exception is Penn and Teller - 5 star show!).

Hash House SHOULD REPRESENT more than just twisted farm food, more than just gigantic portions, and more than just a restaurant frequently associated with man vs. food alumni lists.  

Hash House Sahara has great service.  Love and integrity put into the food.  And is just lovable and quaint.

Top 5 reasons this one is wayyyy different (with anecdotes):

1 - Servers who do not care.  I am a 30%+ tipper where service is exceptional, and 20% when it is even below average.  I had to resort to a 15% tip today.  I have gone 20 years of my life without drinking coffee - the taste has a psychological flashback effect for me which is traumatizing.  Every time I order a hot chocolate, I always freeze in fear ""is this going to be the time someone screws up my order?""  20 years, thousands of hot chocolates later, no issue.  Until today.  Decades of fear have been re-instigated instead of subsided.  I ordered a hot chocolate and the waitress heard me, and even prepared it the exact same way a Hash House hot chocolate arrives at your table (of course this one was severely late).  She even called out to the bar ""do you have my hot chocolate?""  She could see the panic in my face when I asked - because this mug did not look like the typical Hot Chocolate Hash House mug.  One gulp later, my meal (and memory) were both ruined.  She left it on the bill, despite seeing its replacement hot chocolate untouched. and me spitting for a while.

2 - This is a keno bar disguised as a restaurant.  There's a keno runner yelling and walking around interrupting everyone's meal.  I saw no takers today - but I did see annoyed patrons.

3 - I told the waitress we were in a rush, and asked for the check (when you ask for the check, the waitress should be sensitive and aware that there might be a rush of some kind).  When she arrived with the check, my wallet was out and I was selecting which card to use.  She said she would be right back, and then served 3 other tables without returning.  No apologies.  

4 - I asked for a side of bacon.  My non-bacon eating friend had it on the side of her plate, not mine.  

5 - Everything was overcooked - from a simple pancake to a simple sunny side up egg.  I have eaten at Hash House Sahara probably 20x, and never had food or service this bad.

Came here for breakfast while attending a conference at the Rio. I tried to go for lunch the day before, but restaurant closes at 1pm most days (they do brunch on weekends). Seriously, I thought if there was anywhere I was sure to find all day breakfast this was it, but no.

Menu is full of your breakfast standards and some signature spins on same. I got The Basic - 2 egg breakfast with sausage and biscuit. I wanted white toast but I was told they don't carry that. (What???) Eggs and sausage were acceptable. Potatoes were overdone, tasted of old fryer grease and took up 3/4 of plate. Biscuit was dry. Because of the potatoes, the portion was massive. 

And honestly, what is with the massive inedible Rosemary garnish? It doesn't add to the visual appeal of the dish, nor does it visually signify to you that there is Rosemary in the dish. I thought it was wasteful.

Stayed at the Rio for a convention with my dad and sister, and since we opted out of a rental car we were limited to the restaurants on site, and this was our breakfast and lunch go-to for 3 days (would have been dinner spot as well had they been open).

My sister has some food allergies and when we told our 1st server, Steve, he was extremely helpful with suggestions. Thank you Steve! 5 star service for him. 

Food itself is what you'd expect (only monster sized). Yummy, filling, hearty breakfasts, big burgers with all kinds of fixings, standard fries, and surprisingly good produce and salads. 

My dad and I shared skillets with a side of meat or fruit depending on the day and it was just the right amount. Skillet comes with biscuit and two eggs (I don't eat eggs and he doesn't eat biscuits so it was perfect for us). 

Sister had sides of chicken sausage, pork sausage, corned beef, ham (on separate days!) and shared the fruit bowls. All sides were yummy. I also like that the meat is plated on spinach so there's a bit of green to eat. 

Burgers for lunch (or breakfast) were prepared to order and the cucumber dressing in the salad was great. 

Fresh squeezed juices were great too.

Came here again for Halloween with very high expectations. It was a Sunday morning but surprisingly it was not busy at all. We were seated right away. 
We then waited literally 20 minutes for someone to take our drinks orders. We saw a server walk back and forth between tables near us catering to those tables needs but we thought ""that can't possibly be our server, he would've definitely attended to us by now as he obviously can see we've been sitting with no drinks for so long."" He walked away and another man who seemed to be a busser came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. No ""good morning"",  no ""welcome"", just ""what would you like to drink"". But we didn't even care, we were starving and had waited enough. As he brought back our drinks he stated,  ""I'll go get your server."" 
Turns out the original guy who had been avoiding our table was our server. He also didn't say hello or introduce himself as our server, just asked, ""any questions?"" 
We ordered. 10 minutes later our food came out but by another busser. Not once did our server stop by and ask us how food was, if we needed anything else, nothing. We finished our food a good 15 minutes before he brought us our bill. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there. Keep in mind this entire time the server had been attending to the tables around us every 5 minutes. 
The food was not great, maybe it was because I had my hopes so high. I would've preferred the Dennys next to the Venetian with the 40 minute wait and gotten better food and service.
Im not giving up on the hash house, I'm coming back in December but probably to the one at the Linq since it has better reviews.

We were on our way out of town and looking for a good brunch style meal to indulge in before heading on the drive back to LA. We stumbled upon Hash House on yelp and decided to give it a go. I am not sure why this location is rated lower than the other two in town, I risked it and went to Rio anyways. 

This place is hidden away a bit and not super busy. We got a table right away, and the wait staff was very nice. Upon seeing the menu we all chose different things. This was a mistake, because even with four starving guys, we could have easily split two or three meals. Also the menu had some serious readability issues. I would argue that they really need to get that redesigned for increased readability. 


I decided to go with the classic chicken and waffles. When this plate came out the potion was massive for less than $20. Two large pieces of fried chicken (mostly breast, but a little bone existed). 4 thick Belgium waffles. A smorgasbord of topping and plating arrangement to make it look sexy. 

The syrup was light and really enjoyable. I loved cramming the chicken, waffle, and syrup combo into my mouth. Rather tasty. To my surprise the waffles were cooked with bacon in the middle. Now i don't know if that was on the menu or not, but it was a shock to me. A very pleasant and welcome shock.

My eggs, ordered over-medium, were undercooked with the whites still very runny. The biscuit, which comes on almost every plate, was hard enough to use as a weapon. My biscuit wasn't just a fluke either as another person's at our table was the same way. Not sure why you would put sub-par biscuits on almost every plate. Toasted white bread would've been better than that thing. The ham and cheddar scramble was the same thing you can get at 10,000 diners across the country....nothing special. And at 14$ it should be.

We spilt the chorizo and eggs combo, which came with two eggs, fruit, potatoes and a biscuit. And an a la cart of apple cinnamon flap jack. 

We only really needed the first thing we ordered and definitely not the flap jack. The chorizo was mixed in with the potatoes and salsa, with a few jalapeños. The biscuit was almost the same size as a Cinnabon roll, with a hard shell and fluffy on the inside. It came with a side of butter and jam. Not sure what type but it was delicious! 

The flap jack was bigger than the plate they served it on, thick, and came with sliced granny simth apples on the top of the pancake. My hubs only complaint about the pancake was that it didn't come with enough syrup. I personally don't like thick pancakes, so I wasn't a fan - I like more of the thin and crispy edges type. 

Our service was great and overall a better experience! I can't wait to come back to get the chorizo and eggs.",cFi7o039_xwe7s53yKPdAg,2,0,4,vLoKPA7bb5WYWT-YI_Jycw

If you have not tried this place you are missing out. Home of great Guilty! with everything over sized. I really enjoy this location as they offer breakfast drinks like Mimosas, Screwdrivers and upside down pineapple cake. 

The size of all entrees, are shareable with another person so team up and order one plate to share or eat it all (check out the size of my pancake in the photo)

I am always excited when they serve chicken apple sausage!  I get my fix at least once a week. So my crazy size banana brown sugar pancake and my chicken apple sausage came out to about $17-$18 dollars when in Vegas you gotta find the deals.  And yes this time around I will be drinking water and coffee. 

Give hash house a try. They have great breakfast options as well as lunch options and dinner all great to share with another party! And great prices for the money.. my fav dinner dish is the chicken and waffles..",8hbMyONy7kQEVosswobVtQ,3,4,4,QaEAZ1SsWdQmo8xFh-cvNw

Ordering fresh eggs or flapjacks was probably the tastiest in terms of options here. Warning: the flapjacks are huge though, literally the size of a medium or large pizza.

now i know why people visit hash house a go go multiple times while vacationing - i had to set our limit to 3 times in 5 days!  as newbies, we ordered the much raved about favorites (fried chicken benedict, fried chicken and waffles, meatloaf hash, and oatmeal).  some dishes come with plenty of decorative rosemary, which i peeled off and mixed into the food.  this worked really well with the fried chicken and waffles where i made sure to get a bit of fried leek, bbq sauce, maple syrup, rosemary, waffle, and chicken in every bite.  if that sounds like a flavor explosion in your mouth, it definitely was.

A small warning...they put a couple of huge nasty pickle slices on it without warning. Now if you like pickles, you're fine. However if like me, you consider pickle juice to taste like the sewers in the seventh level of hell, you will want to ask them to skip it. The juice tainted everything.

Menu choices were just enough, I don't like too too many options because then it takes to long to decide what I want.

Now onto the food, Hubby ordered the Steak & Eggs and I opted for the Biscuits & Gravy. The first not so great thing was the diced red/yellow bell peppers and green onions they sprinkled on both of our plates, I'm guessing it was for ""presentation"". Well I wasn't impressed because I don't like bell peppers and it wasn't a big deal for my hubby to scrape it off his steak but I had sausage gravy, so it was like digging for unwanted treasure to get it off.

The sausage gravy was awesome by the way, so were the mashed potatoes, biscuits unfortunately weren't they were dense and pretty dry. You think mine being slathered in gravy would of helped loosen them up but NOPE.

Hubby's steak was good even though it was more cooked to my liking which is medium rare, and he ordered medium, he also asked for no tomatoes and yeah they put tomatoes on his. He chose the crispy potatoes instead of mashed and wasn't too impressed, said they were kinda dry and not evenly seasoned. 

All in all it was a meh experience, portions seem to be more of their strong point. We'd maybe try another of their locations to give it another shot but not sure about this one.

Service. 
* Great! Beverages promptly refilled, and our food arrived very quickly, however I think a bit too quickly... 

Food
* The Sage Fried Chicken Breast was a tad heavy on the breading, a bit dry and not especially hot  - all suggesting it was pre-cooked. Still good - but not great like our previous visit. 

* Scrambled eggs & bacon mashed potatoes were fantastic! 

* Biscuit was also on the dry side.

* Butter & Jams. One of the meal's highlights! The homemade jams are scrumptious, as is the butter (would buy them if they sold them). 

Price/Value.

First try, I tried the two egg breakfast and a fruit bowl. The scrambled eggs were from a caterers tray, the bacon was overcooked, the hash browns were burnt, and the fruit wasn't ripe.

Second breakfast, I ordered two scrambled ala carte and a side of bacon. I specifically asked for the eggs to be scrambled fresh. They brought me eggs from the caterers tray again. I ate the bacon; it was passable.

Third try, I order eggs over easy and a side of bacon. The eggs and the bacon was undercooked. I couldn't eat any of it.

This is a management and hiring problem. They need to fire the management first and see if the staff can be trained. If you can't cook eggs and bacon, your restaurant should not be serving breakfast.

Pros:
Service was quick. Orders were taken, prepared and served promptly.

Portions are HUGE. I had a whole itinerary for food for the day and literally my one pancake made it to where I didn't need to eat anymore... and I can eat when I want to. One pancake at 11:30 am lasted me an entire day. It's basically a lazy susan sized pancake.

The apple slices in my apple cinnamon pancake were both large and fresh. Not too crunchy, not too mushy. 

Hot chocolate: So I accidentally ordered the smores mocha instead of the classic hot chocolate (definitely my mistake, I don't even like coffee). However, the large marshmallows, graham cracker and torch they used to melt it were so delicious I ended up drinking more of it than I expected. 

Cool diner like atmosphere that had the basketball game on at the bar.

Cons:

I came there to try the strawberry frosted flake pancake I saw on the online menu but this location doesn't have it. Apparently only certain locations do. No big deal, but it really was the dish that intrigued me to check the place out in the first place. Would have been fun to try.

I like my pancakes soft and fluffy. Some people like theirs with a little crisp on the edges (my wife). My apple cinnamon pancakes were slightly under-cooked even for me. I think with the size of the pancake, it might be tougher to get it to cook all the way through without some parts burning. Inside parts of the pancake had a slight mushiness to it.

I tasted my friends chicken and waffles. I don't eat bacon (yea I know... cue the boos) and these have bacon in them. That said, the waffle was good and the bacon actually wasn't that bad either. It was thick enough to where it tasted more like a piece of meat than the little slither of crisp most places serve. However, I didn't really like the chicken. There was a bunch of extra stuff on it (leeks and sage and whatnot) but the actual chicken itself needed a little more seasoning in my opinion.

All in all, if and when I return to Vegas, I would go again but it wouldn't be a priority. I want to try the stuffed french toast. My Lyft driver was raving about it and a few of the reviews I read concur. I also want to try the strawberry kiwi watermelon drink they had at the bar. I really wanted one but I drank so much the day before I needed a break.",o9fr9sqYRCUwekf8P8Zpbw,0,0,3,Q3bHDUm2aYhigEnNuv2m3Q
3445602,2016-08-21,1,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"After a week of really tough night shifts, my senior resident and I decided to have breakfast at Hash House A Go Go. There are several locations, and we opted for the location inside Rio since it was off the Strip while still being relatively close to work.

It was my first time inside Rio, and I must say that the restaurant was bigger than I was expecting. My dining companion said she had been to a different standalone location, and that this Rio location had a more ""industrial"" feel, plus the ceilings and floor were probably dictated by the constraints of the resort this location is located in. 

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the locomotive train near the entrance, and felt like this was a very spacious dining atmosphere. It was also not too busy at 7AM on a Friday morning. We had several people serve us during the meal, refilling water, clearing plates, bringing out our food, so I don't think we had a clearly defined waiter. However, everyone from the hostess to the runners were super friendly and attentive.

As for the food, I love waffles so I ordered the sage chicken and waffles. The number one thing that stands out is the MASSIVE portion size. I can eat a lot, but these entrees are definitely enough for two people if you eat even an average amount for meals. My sage chicken came with two full fried thigh pieces plus four square waffles. The presentation of the dish had a lot of pizzaz, with a giant knife stuck vertically in the stack like a dagger (see attached photo). 

The dish was excellent. Some of the waffles were a bit on the soggy side; not too soft but just not as crispy as I prefer. I was also surprised to see several segments of bacon INSIDE my waffles! Bacon inside waffle batter inside of as a garnish; that was a first for me! However, the chicken was tender and juicy, and the herb flavors permeated the chicken meat; perhaps it was marinated in herb water prior to frying. I definitely could have finished the entire dish if I pushed myself, but I ended up taking two of the waffles home as leftovers.

My dish cost almost $20 before tax, but given the humongous portion size, it's definitely reasonable. With the open air atmosphere despite being indoors, friendly service, and tasty food with good value, I think Hash Hash A Go Go is a solid breakfast/brunch choice! =)",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,3,1,4,cJ9oI41vLK_Nu27GVLr9sQ

I ordered the Healthy Start scramble with salmon, spinach and mushroom. I paid extra to have the extra item of mushroom and it was not worth it.

The little service interaction I had was uncomfortable, it seemed the guy that took my order at the bar was having a bad day. 

The 2nd time, I went with my family and dined in. I had another scramble with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes and spinach. Again the scramble was very dry and potatoes over seasoned. None of us enjoyed our food and definitely the most expensive meal we had that we basically didn't eat.

The restaurant itself has the design of an old school diner. One of the things I love about this place is how spacious it is. When you're hungover the last thing you want is to sit and have breakfast in a clustered restaurant. The service is always pretty awesome. Iv never had a bad experience 


The best thing on the menu is definitely the chicken and waffles. The portion is enough to feed two people. The rest of the menu is pretty awesome. They don't have hash browns which is a bit surprising given the name of this place. For those looking for healthier alternatives, they have the option of substituting  with egg whites and are very good with modifying anything on the menu to fit your needs.

I ordered the oatmeal breakfast. I figured it wasn't a giant tray of food. It would be hot and come pretty quickly.

I talked into that bowl for a good 20 minutes and hardly made a dent. Along with the bowl of oatmeal, there were many fresh fruits, types of sugars, and dried fruits and nuts. It was probably one of the best bowls of oatmeal I'd ever had.

Located in the Rio Hotel & Casino, Hash House serves an extensive breakfast menu.

The waffles were stuffed with bacon. Yup, you read right, BACON! I had no clue until I started ripping in between the waffle squares in the midst of feeling like I was having a heart attack.

It took a host 10 minutes to walk us to a table when the joint was nearly empty; the hostess was no where to be seen as we waited behind another guest. When we were eventually taken to a table, no employee appeared at our table for 10+ minutes...until I flagged down a poor busboy to take our drink order. After our drinks arrived, I asked if I could order since I was in town for the IBM conference and I was in a hurry to get to a session but was told he would call our server over. Another 10 minutes go by, and the same busboy took pity on us and told us he'd write down our order for our server who still at this point had not made an appearance. When our food hit the table which was 50 minutes in after we had arrived, I was appalled by the little care they took into assembling our plates. The burger had its patty flopped on, and half of it missed the bun! Hoping it would at least be hot, the patty was disappointingly cold. The only enjoyable part of our meal was the super greasy but flavorful sage fried chicken. However no one in our party seemed to care for the bacon waffle tower. Besides the wow factor of the bacon being cooked into the waffle, it did nothing to enhance the flavor nor contribute to an extraordinary texture. Yes, it's sweet from the syrup and yes, it's a little salty from the bacon. But is it special? No.

All in all, it took us 15 minutes to finish our meal when we had come in knowing exactly what we wanted so that we could be in and out. We did a huge amount of waiting and spent a small amount of time eating. Curiously enough because I didn't notice another employee walking around besides the busboy, I scanned around and found a group of them standing in the kitchen and chit-chatting like nobody's business. We did eventually meet our server though as he dropped off the check and told us to pay at the front.

3903962,2015-10-15,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"It baffles me that this place has so many positive reviews. Let me begin by saying that I am not opposed to creative variants on classics nor do I object to trying new concoctions. I had high hopes for this place going in. However, if you're going to concoct something so radically different from a traditional dish that it's completely unrelated, consider a rename or at least have a version close to the classic on the menu.

If you're going to claim to have ""benedicts"" on your menu, at a minimum, you ought to offer something that involves english muffins, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. Minimum. No such luck here...

I will mention the good (as it's brief and I don't want to be unfair in my review): The staff was prompt and courteous. The service was good but not fantastic.

The food, however, was as bad as it was oversized.

I went in jonesing for Eggs Benedict. Yelp suggested this place and I made the mistake of not reviewing the menu in detail before going there.

There was a substantial line to get a table, which was not helped by the fact that elite hotel club members (7 star and diamond) could bypass the line and get seated right away. It's one thing to offer priority seating on an airplane where everyone gets to the destination at the same time and priority only really affects where you wait for the departure and whether or not you get overhead bin space. It's an entirely different matter to let elites cut the line on a 15-30 minute wait for a table.

Further exacerbating this was the fact that there's no take your name and have a seat we'll call you, you stand in line for the entire wait.

The menu in this place is fairly limited and there's not really anything on there that corresponds to what you would expect from the terms they use. The ""Benedicts"" are no exception. Reading the menu, the closest I could come (description wise) was the pounded pork loin benedict, which I ordered.

Here's what arrived when the food came:

A serving-platter sized plate covered in skin-in course-mashed potatoes. Into the smear of potato lumps (roughly plate sized and about 3/4"" thick) two halves of a very large biscuit were inserted crust down. On top of this, were a slice of tomato on each biscuit and some spinach. Atop that was a legal-paper size breaded deep fried pork cutlet (not what I expected from the words ""pounded pork loin""). (I'd skipped the fried-chicken benedict because I was hoping to avoid the breaded and deep fried aspect as I don't particularly care for deep fried breading). On top of this monstrosity of pork abuse was a small pile of very firm (almost rubbery) scrambled eggs and the whole thing was topped with a modest amount of yellowish-brown mushroom gravy.

That's right... Not one single ingredient in common with a proper eggs benedict in the entire concoction.

I'm a pretty big eater and I was hungry, but I only managed to choke down about a third of this disappointment. The portion could easily serve 2 very large very hungry people or a family of 4 in many circumstances.

Since I was dining alone, the large portion size didn't really do anything positive for me as it just increased the amount of waste. (In case you're thinking I am a small-portion person, I'm really not. This is the first time I can ever remember complaining that a restaurant delivered too much food... EVER.)

The meal was finally capped off with the bill. I knew from the menu that the benedict was overpriced (though perhaps not if I consider it as a meal for 2+) at almost $20, but the real sticker shock came from $3.99 for a single glass of Iced Tea which was never refilled (or even offered).

It's not that $4 is going to break the bank so much as the principle of paying that much for a glass of tea when the going rate even in michelin rated places seems to be $2 to $2.50.",LHAyrs08FlFvkhFQtecO2g,0,0,1,Iu53iWulAHJTESL3kpyBXg

Don't let the long lines deter you because they seat you quickly! All of the food is delicious here and the prices are not bad at all. Portions are huge and again, the food is SO GOOD.

The only thing that I do not like about this restaurant is that they do not offer bottomless mimosas;  maybe I am just a spoiled LA girl who is used to all her favorite brunch spots offering bottomless mimosas, but this is an absolute bummer. Still not enough to stop me from choosing HH every time I am in vegas :)

Well, they must have been given special treatment none of which we were availed to upon our trip for brunch. We were starving so anything probably would have tasted good. There was a bit of a line on Sunday, March 6 around 11am, but it moved pretty quickly. We were seated and our server Steven came over right away. He took our drink orders and told us a bit about the menu (only because I asked) and then ran off. This was the most that we saw of him for the rest of our time there. My friend got the signature dish chicken and waffles. The chicken was marginal. We have had better. The ""bacon"" waffles were a joke. Of the 4 waffles only 1 had a piece of bacon running through the middle of it. They were so tough! We were given a tiny container of syrup for four giant waffles and since we didn't see Steven again, we couldn't ask for more! I ordered the basic breakfast which consisted of two eggs, bacon, a biscuit, fruit, and seasoned potatoes. There was nothing special about any of it and I was especially shocked at the size of the pieces of bacon. There were only two pieces of bacon and not two full pieces, two half pieces, so really one piece of bacon. Really?! The biscuit was hard as a rock, in fact it could have been. There were no condiments on my plate for it either. Steven NEVER checked back with us to see how our food was, so I had to flag him down to get something to put on it. (And in the end decided I didn't want to risk breaking a tooth on it anyway) The one and only refill I got on my coffee came from the busser Roger (from Thailand according to his name tag) who was working his butt off! I even had my empty coffee cup sitting on the edge of the table for 10-15 minutes and Steven walked by 3 times (at the end of our meal) and brought the check over and never refilled it!! Wow, really?! The coffee was terrible anyway so we just grabbed our check and left. Thank you to Roger though for being the one bright spot at Hash House. Don't go to this place. It is way overrated!

I neglected to take a picture, but the healthy scramble I ordered with salmon and spinach was so dinky, it was like a side portion.

The legend says that the portions were humongous and the food is great...  I'm gonna definitely give the portions 2 thumbs up while the food itself is decent.

Our party got the following...

Steak and eggs
Cornbeef
Fried chicken and waffles
Mushroom and swiss burger.

Though that the food was decent perhaps due to the enormous size of the plates, but when I wanted to go back and have the rest, it was already cold...

Steak and eggs were exactly what they are...
Cornbeef is a little on the dry side
Mushroom and swiss burger is slightly salty, but I'm sure it had like 3 lbs of meat on the single patty... crazy!
Then the fried chicken and waffles, 3 towering sage fried chicken residing over 4 bacon waffles...  Flavor was ok but I didn't know how to deconstructed before engaging....  Yes.. it was that huge!

So here are the pros and cons...

Pros:  
Portion size!
Bang for your buck!
Relaxed atmosphere
Guarantee leftovers

Cons: 
Size:  Is too big a problem?
Flavor, seems to be just like any other breakfast joint
Price:  Slightly pricey for those people who have a small appetite, but if you are hungry I'm sure the price will be very reasonable.

Will I go back... I don't think out of the way but if friends wanted to go back and have breakfast together I'll probably make a visit.",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,5,4,3,-LJUn9sAo4mH1U62PQoQiw

Basically you are not greeted or acknowledged by the grumpy hostess who appears to not care one way or another about you sitting or for her even being there.  But if you are a ""platinum"" card carrier you are sort of acknowledged by a grunt.  So when we were led to our table she cleared her throat for us to follow.

I've never heard of this place before and I saw the posters that Guy Fieri and Martha Stewart endorse the place as their favorite restaurant. Which makes you think that this must be a great place. 

What makes the place really awesome is the service. Like, the staff there were so awesomely nice and very attentive. Honestly, I'm probably more a fan of their service than their food. 

So, what they are known for is their Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and their large portions. I got the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit. It was ok, the chicken was very greasy. I didn't even get to finish half of my meal. It was a meal ready to feed about 3 people. Honestly, I wished that I was able to take it home, however I was from out of town and my hotel room didn't have a refrigerator nor a microwave. 

I'm not sure why Martha Stewart would endorse this place for the food. However, for the service, I honestly agree with her. As for Guy Fieri, I feel that he endorse anything. But, something about the food lacked a lot of loving. 

The reason I'm rating this 4 stars is because of the service, and the experience was great there. My advice for anyone who is coming there to have brunch is... be ready to eat a lot (like buffet style hungry) and wear your looses pants.

There are many, many Hash House locations that opened up in the Valley in the last several years and this is probably the worst location to come to. The restaurant is either extremely dead with tourists that had the misfortune to stay in the Rio, or packed post convention center events.

4307596,2015-05-17,4,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,"Another one of the dining offerings in the Las Vegas Rio casino, Hash House A Go-Go is a chain of eateries that features heartland-inspired cuisine and portions that would literally choke a Great White Shark!

WHO SHOULD GO: Trenchermen, anyone who loves classic American cuisine, anyone who loves Claim Jumper.

WHO SHOULDN'T: Anyone who is height/weight proportionate, and would like to stay that way, and solo diners.

THE ROSES: Don't expect anything sophisticated or exotic here; this is stick-to-your-ribs-pickup-truck-driving-trucker-cap-wearing-plumber's-butt-jeans style chow, but it is damn tasty! I had and truly enjoyed the chicken and waffles, even though I could feel my cardiovascular system closing up just looking at it. Bloody Marys are divine, and the service is quite good.

THE THORNS: Portion sizes so large, it's actually immoral! If there's an obesity epidemic in America, places like this are squarely to blame. My chicken & waffles could have honestly been shared by 2 hungry people, or three normal appetites! I'm all for value, but this is ridiculous! I saw a LOT of half-eaten plates being cleared away by the busboys, not because the food was bad, but because (a) there is no way in hell you can finish, and (b) get real, no one is going eat what they take in a doggie bag. The hotel staff will be cleaning it out of your room fridge when you leave! This level of wastage is simply wrong, when you think of all the hunger in the world (or even here in the USA!). Staffing is a problem too. during the breakfast rush, there was a huge line of people wanting in, but some sections remained closed off simply because there was a lack of staff to serve the tables.

THE VERDICT: Tasty food is the draw, but huge portions make it a bad place for the solo diner who has no one to share an entree with. When you carry the 'monster portion' shtick to this level of ridiculousness, I have to dock you TWO stars. If the portion sizes were more reasonable, I'd have given this restaurant a 4-star rating. When you wonder why America in general, and Vegas in particular, is overrun by fatties (and yes, I KNOW that not all overweight people have any control over their weight, but let's face it, most DO, and places like this are simply enabling those future diabetics.

TOP TIP: If you're going for breakfast, GO EARLY, otherwise you will be stuck in a long, slow line waiting for a table.

PARTHIAN SHOT: In the interest of full disclosure, let me say I'm no fan of what Las Vegas has become. The former haunt of the likes of classy Rat Packers like Frank, Dean, Sammy, et al. has been replaced by chubby heartland rubes wearing fanny packs and flip-flops. The words of British bicycle designer Mike Burrows, when touring the US, come to mind:

""Marin County (California) was wonderful. The whole town had nothing but beautiful people. I think there must've been an ordinance banning stupid and ugly people within city limits.

Then I came to Las Vegas and realized what they had done with them all.""",BaOFMm3cs-yEnOdTej3jDg,2,2,2,hYy_MsheE2Do5yQjBjCKFA

What brought me back was seeing how great everyone else's food looked compared to mine.  I was very disappointed the first time around and had to give it another shot. I was already staying at the Rio, so this location was very convenient.  There were several things that I liked better about this Hash House than at the Imperial Palace, mostly that it felt less stuffy.  Overall, it was a much better dining experience. 

My instincts to give it another shot paid off as I really enjoyed my food.  I ordered the bacon waffle, which was a waffle with bacon in the center that stuck out of each corner.  My plan was to order a waffle and a side of bacon, but this covered all my bases!  It was slightly on the salty side, but my waiter had warned me about that prior to ordering.  It was a unique and tasty breakfast plate that I thoroughly enjoyed.

Other reviewers were not exaggerating about the portions. Our breakfasts actually came on what would be considered a serving platter. I recommend sharing a meal with one or two other people. I had one of the scrambles which came with their fried mashed potatoes and a biscuit. This was my first time trying fried mashed potatoes and thought they were good, but not amazing. I think that the same can be said for the rest of the meal. One of my friends had the sage chicken and waffles and the other had the biscuits and gravy. We were all in agreement that everything was good to fine. I think sometimes quantity does not equal quality. I also thought it was pricey for breakfast food, but granted maybe not for the portion. I think I would have preferred a smaller portion anyway. 

Hash House has several fun drink options, both alcoholic, such as their different types of mimosas and bloody marts, and virgin, such as their watermelon kiwi lemonade. Again, this is Vegas, so most of the prices were high.

Random complaint: the restaurant is open to the casino, meaning there is not a wall between the hall and the restaurant, only a railing. We were seated next to the railing. There was a long line waiting for the restaurant that queued against the railing and our table.

I get my burger. Presentation is great. A piece of rosemary is sticking out the top of the bun and holds it all together beautifully.

The food is so-so and comes in huge portions. I always order the sage fried chicken plate with mashed potatoes, two eggs and a biscuit -- today, the eggs were runny, so much so that there was a yellow liquid pooling underneath that made the eggs look like they were sitting in soup. The fried chicken was really dry and lukewarm on top of that, and the mashed potatoes had zero flavor. 

Sometimes restaurants have off days with the food,  but there's never any excuse for poor service. Our waiter (I think his name was Brian) was so busy legitimately giving my family a hard time for ordering basic breakfasts -- he says, why order a basic when you're at a restaurant with so many creative options -- that he screwed up my uncle's order and forgot to add the extra egg. 

On top of that, all but one dish was brought out at the same time, so we were half finished by the time my aunt got her breakfast. I got up to find our waiter, but he blew right past me so I asked the hostess if she could check on what was going on. A few minutes later, we flagged him down and instead of apologizing, we get a lecture about how all the food is brought out fresh as it's finished -- that's cool, but it should have been better timed and he could have at least given us a heads up we'd be waiting an extra 15 mins after everyone else got served. To boot, we had to snag a hostess to pour coffee for the table after we only got served one cup in the 45 minutes we'd been sitting there. 

For people who thought this spot could replace the one at the M, it doesn't . Try your luck elsewhere.

I ordered the sage waffles and chicken, having seen others order it during our first visit - my colleagues order a variety of things from sandwiches to salads to breakfast.  The sage chicken and waffles were nothing special.  The one thing that I did note with just about everyone's meal was more food than what we could eat.

My third visit was also for lunch with a single colleague.  It wasn't as slow as my first visit, but it was pretty slow.  I ordered the basic breakfast again, which I quite enjoyed and was a good amount of food.  While the service on my second visit was questionable, the service on this visit was just terrible.

Immediately we noticed that half of the dining area was closed, for no good reason apparently. People were waiting in line to be seated, while there were clearly tables available on both sides. Okay, whatever. We got seated. It took a good 8 minutes before a busser came and took our drink order which was 2 coffees and 2 glasses of water. We got our coffee within minutes, but no water in sight. When our actual server, Marcy, finally came to take our order we asked for our waters again as well as ordering the original HH Farmhouse Benedict for myself and the Chicken and Waffles for my husband. A few minutes later the same busser returned with a water for me. Just for me though, no water for my husband. Marcy was nearly impossible to track down and when we finally got her attention and asked AGAIN for his water she seemed irritated and said okay water and walked away. My husband's chicken and Waffles arrived at the table BEFORE his water did. Finally we both had our food and were excited to be eating. This is the only reason this review has a second star. The taste was what was expected. However for the portions given, I would have expected more than one egg on my Benedict. Before even 5 minutes passes by, Marcy slams our check on our table and says ""whenever you're ready"". No ""no hurry"", or ""any dessert before I give you your tab?"" none of that. Just a rude deliverance of our bill. I felt like I was being rushed out of the restaurant when all I wanted to do was sit down and enjoy a meal. The table next to us clearly had issues with Marcy as well. My husband and I observed a girl at the table ask Marcy a question when she was right next to her, and Marcy ignored her question and walked away. This experience made me want to never return to HH A Go-Go. Or at least not to this location.

While you wait to be served, plates pass by with massive portions and items on them. I was amazed by a waffle the size of a gamer's flatscreen monitor. When our food arrived, portions were similarly stunning. 

Unfortunately, the food is just kind of so-so. I ordered an egg dish, and while the egg was tasty, the large biscuit had more of a scone consistency and was bland, while the potatoes were not crispy or flavorful at all (and seemed kind of hard, too). How can a place that calls itself Hash House not have mastered potatoes? I don't know, but they did.  

Did I mention the 70's music? I liked it, but there was an eight-track flashback quality to it for sure.

I ordered the chicken farm scramble and my sister ordered the meatloaf hash. The biscuit was my favorite part!

I got the grilled mashed potatoes on the side. This almost felt like dinner for breakfast, but I'm the type who loves that! There are more traditional breakfast options if that's your thing. Tried a bite of the meatloaf. It was ok. However, my sister was a fan and really enjoyed it. Again, more like dinner than breakfast.

Mardi Gras Pancakes - Buttermilk Confetti Cake with mini-M&Ms, white chocolate chips, and dark chocolate chips

Crispy hand hammered pork tenderloin benedict with yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream, 2 basted eggs, griddled mashed potatoes, and buttermilk biscuit

Lavazza Coffee

With my breakfast predilections ever skewed sweet over savory it came as a bit of a surprise that 'National Pancake Week' had gone unnoticed until I caught a news brief discussing the opening of the newest location of San Diego's Hash House a Go-Go at The Rio; a special offering 'Mardi Gras' pancake catching my eye and early opening hours plus a promise of televisions showing the USA vs. Russia game cementing my plans to visit after a long morning run.  Well designed and immense in size with clever interior flourishes complimenting the concept of ""Twisted Farm Food"" it was mere moments after the puck dropped on the third period that I arrived to the hostess stand and after a brief greeting I was handed off to a lovely lady named Peggy who would keep watchful eye over me throughout the overtime-extended visit - the nearly eighty minute stay ample time to enjoy approximately a whole pot of hot coffee and all that arrived on Hash House's enormous signature plates.  Deciding to go one sweet and one savory with a request to deliver the former followed by the latter it was with the special pancake that I arrived and truly the size of the hubcap it was exactly what I expected, fluffy and laced with buttermilk but exceedingly sweet; the equivalent of eating birthday cake for breakfast and exactly the sort of thing I'm willing to go out early for, though probably a dish best shared...particularly given what followed in a Benedict balancing a surfboard of crisp, lean pork with top quality vegetables and creamy mashed potatoes beneath lightly sweetened and tangy barbeque cream.  Perhaps not 'refined' and undoubtedly 'over the top,' yet a place with something for everyone given their dedication to ethical farming and product sourcing Hash House a Go-Go remains one of the rare mini-chains I'm happy to support and with newer locations even offering 'lite' options of simple eggs, toast, proteins, and salads its only a matter of time before I visit the downtown and Sahara locations...the best biscuits in the city just one more highlight on an already long list.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,1,1,4,pkeQpBThqEDL2dwNKHEzMg

The portion here are HUGE so if you can share a dish I  would definitely recommend it. We ordered the chicken and waffles because we saw a photo of the guy from Man vs Food saying it was the best chicken and waffles. I would have to agree that the chicken has a lot of flavor but I would not say it was the best. The chicken was moist and I could taste the sage. The waffle was fluffy and has bits of bacon in the middle of the waffle which caught me by surprise.  How they presented the dish was amazing! It did not look like they just slapped it on haha. The average price for a dish is about $12-$15 which is a pretty good deal since the portions are huge.,rFAhL9Tpr0vAVqqsDVTPnA,0,0,3,q8QqtB37E3jLMwk59PE7aA

If you're hungry and looking for a place to get the best bang for your buck then I recommend this place! The Rio location is also great because the wait times are usually a lot shorter than the one at the Linq. Down side is that the Rio is off the strip (free parking though!). Here's what we ordered:

S'mores Mocha - I typically get their Hot Chocolate which is delicious but wanted a little bit more caffeine this time. The Mocha is topped off with marshmallows and graham crackers. I recommend eating the graham crackers ASAP before they get soggy. Definitely executed well. The cup was quite large like all their portions so I couldn't finish all of it. 

Safe Fried Chicken and Waffles - This dish needs some team work to make a dent in it. Four BACON-STUFFED Belgian waffles topped with two large fried pieces of chicken. I had to ask for a side of butter to add to the waffles which I recommend. Can't have waffles without butter! The chicken was fried with a great crisp and the pieces were large to make you very full. I usually get their Sage Fried Chicken Benedict which is also superb!

Tractor Driver Combo with a Blueberry Flapjack - This flapjack/pancake is so massive that it barely fits the plate. It is also enough for one person even without the combo! I normally get their French Toast which I highly recommend but I decided to go with something different. The flapjack was very fluffy, tasty, and satisfying

I didn't care for the banana at all, especially since I don't eat bananas. I had a piece of like my boyfriends chicken and it was pretty good, but didn't appreciate the leaves in the batter.

The biscuit with the rosemary sprig and eggs (I like mine scrambled). The pineapple mimosa was delicious! I was full for most of the day after eating this mammoth meal! I ate it again the next day, this time I ordered the tractor meal (1 pancake, eggs, sausage). I say ONE pancake, but it was as big as a tire! Okay, I'm exaggerating, but it was HUGE!! At least 18 inches in diameter. I could barely finish it!!! I'd recommend this place to everyone. SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!!!!!",_5vXc6st4qdKHA5ZdtC-UQ,0,0,5,Z0agTh7biJL3lpfNu-fUBw

I came here after I followed the recommendations of several friends.,_q8qEhmbYzoigV_Zy94_1A,0,0,5,6kJTP_cwfyJySspckdykQg
5996486,2018-01-07,0,znWHLW1pt19HzW1VY6KfCA,We are here staying at the Rio for my birthday and I must say I am very disappointed with my breakfast from Hash House A Go Go. I ordered chicken and waffles to take back to my room and it appeared to be pre-done not fresh at all. The chicken seem to be precooked as well. It was packaged in a pizza box. The food was room temperature and not hot. Normally our food is amazing.,vnsJGmPzcO_Fiw6PaXPbRA,0,0,3,C8CRabNDMZgCXPHFTVVhrA
