19331,2012-07-26,0,l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg,"I have been here a few times. 

Each time I went the food was actually really good, so I decided to order catering, being that the food was really good and the service was good the last few times I went.

Apparently the service changed, and this is where they lose me as a customer.

A few days ago I tried to order catering from this company for a small party.

My husband had gone into the restaurant 2 days prior to me ordering, just to check out the catering prices. They had a new menu posted on their wall inside the restaurant, the man at the counter even pointed it out to my husband and said ""these are our new catering prices"". The prices on the menu had the tax included on them, so we knew exactly what to expect for our budget.
My husband even took a picture on his phone, and showed it to me when he got home.

So a few days later, I called them and kept the order simple, ordered five trays: 
two types of rice, two types of meat and noodles.

When the lady on the phone told me the total, I was in awe!

I did the math by the prices on their new menu, added the delivery charge, and tax, and the order was way off....by almost $70!!

When I requested that she repeat everything back to me, she broke the charges down by what I ordered and the prices were NOT what they had posted on their menu, they were higher.

I confronted her and told her that the charges she quoted me were not the prices that  they had on their menu and that my husband was in there a few days ago.

She laughed and said that is not what they have on their wall.

When I told my husband the total he was enraged.

My husband got on the phone and asked to speak to a manager.

A guy came on the phone, let my husband tell him the problem, and then said ""We give you special price"" and quoted him a different price, that was still higher than what they had posted on their wall. 

My husband said ""That is not what you have posted on your wall in your restaurant, I was over there 2 days ago, all we want is the price you have advertised"".

The man said that they cannot give us that price, he didn't even explain why.

The man on the phone sounded like he didn't even care, he didn't even try to help us.

So we told them no way, and cancelled the order.

They have lost me as a customer. 

I am not going back there. 

If they screw up like that, it makes me wonder how future orders would have been for me.

I'm not asking for much. I just wanted some good chinese food for my party and now I have to start from scratch.

There are hundreds of other restaurants in this town, and I am definitley going somewhere else!!",ruVwLL_rWv_s4d0ANPttPw,0,0,1,f3hTsYknnaEpkjEQyxcChA

I know this is an awful harsh review, but I'm being most honest. True Chinese cuisine tastes amazing is and this place definitely does not tickle the taste buds :-(

Rice and mains portion was very small...especially the rice (maybe 1/2 a cup?).

But I am sorry to say that the food was some of the worst I've had. The fried chicken wontons had too much soy sauce in it and was soggy and very salty, the fried rice was very greasy tasting and again too much soy sauce, it was the darkest brown fried rice I've ever seen, the mongolian beef was extremely salty and the pad thai was salty and greasy. Overall the meal was pretty much inedible. China Ginger decrease the soy sauce and maybe the entrees won't be so salty, also decrease the amount of cooking oil used.

Went here for lunch/dinner with fam and it was practically ghost town! We were the only customers up in there! Got seated right away, obviously. But tell me why when it came down to ordering: beef chow fun w/black bean sauce, kung pao chicken, and fried rice - it seriously took forever!!! really?! You would think that being the ONLY customers  in that joint, they would be all about taking care of us and giving nothing but first class service. Negative. The food did not even redeem itself either! The beef chow fun was rubbery/chewy, not soft at all! AND! the kung pao chicken didn't taste like real chicken! everything was bland! yuck! no flavors whatsoever! We were truly disappointed. To be honest, the only thing that tasted good was the darn WATER! lol. 

I don't want to be mean...but I've experienced way better elsewhere thats authentic. Do not waste your money at China Ginger. The restaurant just fools you by how nice it looks. :P",8NPnK5h5Te91Ot6nbX9a5g,2,1,1,jeZyYN-D7zSQAkLrupSUYQ
1209925,2013-07-11,3,l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg,"I'm not much of a blogger but, here's my first one.
This was my first visit to China Ginger and it might be my last. The man at the counter was very nice a tried to help me make a decision. I was trying to not get anything fried with the exception of fried rice. My order was pork fried rice with NO CARROTS( not that I  don't like carrots), steamed dumplings, chicken and broccoli NO CARROTS, and free sesame balls for making an order over $20.00. 
Complaint #1, There were carrots in everything I ordered without carrots.
Complaint #2, Seems like the sauce for the chicken and broccoli and the sauce they use for the fried rice was just plain old soy sauce ( very lazy!).
Complaint #3, The ""free"" sesame balls the threw in were flavorless, It was like biting into fried nothingness. The center was filled with something, I couldn't  make out what it was. I wasn't sure if it was fish paste, chocolate, or some kind of meat puree. I ate one and threw out the rest. What ever it was, it was just a waste,
Complaint #4, The one main entrée I order, which should have been enough for at least 3 to 4 normal portions( not over eater portions) was hardly enough for 2 people but too much for 1.
Complaint #5 ( wow, I didn't think I would get to 5) The steamed dumpling looked and tasted like the were out of the frozen food section at Walmart. I don't think I have ever had worse dumplings than this in my life, And I've had some pretty bad dumplings. Btw. served with the same soy sauce as the fried rice and chicken and broccoli.

The positive, the guy who took my order was nice. 

When I started to write this review I gave China Ginger 2 Stars. After reading what I wrote, I think one star is too much.

I am giving five stars to the operation, because it has always met and exceeded expectations. One caveat: they do not have red chile oil here, so if you are used to that as I am, prepare to instead be given some very thick, vinegary red chile sauce that alters the taste of the dish instead of merely adding heat and nice texture to your food.

This spot is pretty close to my house, and I always pass it on my way to and from work, so I figured I'd give it a shot one night. 

Not a lot of Yelp love for this place, but that's ok...it can be our little secret ;)

Some dishes that are decent: chicken with black bean sauce, chicken lo mein, and anything with chow fun. All are excellent choices.

I also love that the food is always hot and ready for pickup within 10 minutes. 

As I said in my first paragraph, this isn't five-star, hard core, authentic Chinese food. It's just easy, simple, take out. And it's good for that. Something I missed in Arizona.

3592611,2012-03-03,2,l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg,"Growing up in the Upper Midwest we had two basic types of food - normal food and Chinese food. Normal food was anything your mother could cook at home, which included Italian, Mexican and the cultural staples of a largely Scandinavian and German population.
 
Chinese food was different because most families could not make it at home unless they used those nasty supermarket brand La Choy products that made you want to misbehave so mom would send you to bed without supper.

If you wanted Chinese food and you didn't want to toss your cookies, you went out to eat. Every town of any substantial size had a Chinese restaurant or two, all offering AYCE buffets so everyone could get exactly what they wanted. It didn't matter which restaurant you chose, because they all tasted the same.

Naturally, as soon as anyone escapes the confines of the frozen tundra, they are surprised to discover what ""real"" Chinese food tastes like. Some choose to reject this new cuisine as an imposter and run back to their sheltered concepts, while others will embrace the discovery and begin an adventure to see what else can be found down the rabbit hole.

If you are visiting our great city from those upper plains and you want to find that Chinese food that is so adored by the hordes of Midwesterners, check out China Ginger. This place will make you feel right at home - the chicken is thin and stringy like a worm, the beef is tough and sinewy and feels like tapioca in your mouth, the shrimp are pathetically small and harder to bite through than a fruitcake.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,4,3,2,BJygb3AxyP05mnXXKuJZfQ

Complete disclosure here, I tried this via delivery, not eating in their establishment. The plus to that, it was delivered hot and all tasted fresh. It's just the taste was a little on the flat side for me. 

I like the kick in food, it doesn't have to be spicy, but flavorful and this is how I break down what I tried:

Beef broccoli - something about it didn't taste right. I'm used to the oyster sauce being a little more umph-y  (that's my word for umami) the savory just wasn't there. The meat was tender, broccoli crisp but just lacked zing and zap.

Singapore noodle - Again, lacked something. I ordered WITH the curry sauce and even with that, it still didn't have quite what I was expecting. Decent amounts of chicken, a few shrimp and veggies. Good, but not POW, smack you in the face great.

Teriyaki chicken - This was actually good. At least it slapped my taste buds awake after the first two dishes.

It was good enough to try again. when we went back the next weekend we decided to switch it up and get double hot and sour soup, double special house chicken, double chicken fried rice ($3 extra, but WORTH IT). we have been addicted ever since! It is so hard finding a non chain restaurant that my husband likes and he actually said ""this is so good!""

Sadly I now live in the centennial hills area, so I can't order delivery. But since I love it so much my husband and I drive all the way down there to eat from time to time. My favorite item on the menu is their wor wonton soup. So good I can never order it from any other place, I'm only disappointed when I do! Prices are also really good. Not at all overpriced. On top of that the look of the place is beautiful. Most Chinese restaurants in town are real ugly/dingy looking inside. This place is amazing looking, somewhere you can go out on a nice date night to. Plus every waitress/waiter we've ever had gave over the top service. Always really nice and on top of everything you need or want. Anyone who says they hate this place is crazy! So please don't base going or not going on their terrible/rude reviews.

The general atmosphere is very quaint, relaxing, and subtle. This was a slow night, so I didn't expect a loud experience, however the colors of the establishment complimented the decor well.

Anyway, grub time. The food was pretty good for the price. My SO ordered the house lo mein and I decided on a skillet-like steak entree. The pan seared potstickers we received were a little crisp and full of flavor. The house lo mein looked pretty standard, however it was not greasy at all and tasted pretty good. My sizzling steak entree looked amazing, however the bamboo shoots overpowered the sauce and the meat. My mistake for not asking the full ingredient list though.

The service, compared to most Chinese places, is very nice. The staff was very fast about drink refills, and stopped by to check if we were doing alright. I manage a high volume restaurant, and was pleased that despite the place was nearly empty, the service was spot on. 

One more thing, the bathrooms are spotless and look great. Most typical places like this are so dirty you could catch the plague from sitting down, however China Ginger is very clean.

Called in my order and they said it would be ready in just 10 minutes so that's a plus.. fast food! When I got there for some reason I had trouble finding the main door LOL I thought it was on the side somewhere by Nagoya.. Any ways.. they didn't seem too happy that I had a coupon.. Which, by the way, saved me $10 so yay. I wasn't really hungry but I did sample a little bite of each entrée :
-Chicken Chow Fun Dry: It was ok... flat, thin, long rice noodles pan fried with soy sauce, onions, bean sprouts & chicken.
-Beef & Asparagus: way too salty
-Orange Chicken: It's deep fried & coated with a sweet orange glaze.. of course it's tasty but so is Panda Express haha 
-Steamed Rice: They gave us 3 large containers of rice which was way too much but a plus since some places don't include rice.. But the rice was a cheap quality rice.
-To-go containers: I like their plastic Tupperwareish to-go containers. Prevents spilling and leakage.. AND they are re-useable haha 

Anywho.. This place is not really worth checking out. The prices aren't even that low for take out quality food..

HOT TIP: Look in your mail for Valpack Coupons.. that's where you'll find their buy 2 get 1 free entrée coupon!",_ir8NHMtV7KPTwmBmlkmQw,6,5,2,vt9jkpYPAi-yfMLrSCSKoA

Everything was slightly overly salted & each dish we got had way too much sauce on it. The orange chicken didn't really taste like orange chicken it was mainly chicken in a sweet & sour sauce. The beef & broccoli looked traditional but the beef was kinda chewy, I couldn't figure out if it was old or just over cooked.. The chicken fried rice & wonton soup was probably our favorite!

The hostess was very sweet, and seated us right away.  I was a little surprised by the length of the menu. They had everything you'd expect, and then some.  They even had scallion pancakes, and pad Thai.

Our food was ready in about 10 minutes.  We had fried won-tons, and hot and sour soup first, and they were both delicious. My boyfriend actually approved of the hot and sour soup (this is very rare, and means that it tastes like the hot and sour soup at PF Chang's).  

Our main courses were pan fried noodles, and dan dan noodles.  We really enjoyed both.  The chicken/vegetable/noodle proportions were spot on, the sauces were great, and the food actually tasted healthier (China Ginger claims to use less oil, and salt, and no msg).  It looked, and tasted less oily, and there was definitely less salt.  It was so nice eating something we'd normally consider total junk food, without feeling super gross afterwards.

We ordered chicken fried rice, pork lo mien and sweet and sour chicken. Those three things came to over $25 and they ""forgot"" to include the free dim sum, which is probably best since their food is horrible.

The sweet & sour chicken was the worst I've ever had. The meat had a funny aftertaste, the outside was dry and way to much of it and the sauce tasted like rancid candy. It was obviously made with canned juice... we could taste the can. The sauce was in a tub on it's own which was fine but the dozen or so battered chicken pieces came on a bed of slimy raw vegetables. There was so little meat we would have felt ripped off for what we paid for this dish even if there had been a decent amount of the chicken.

The fried rice was mushy and tasted more like steamed rice with soy sauce on it then fried. There was no egg in it and the vegetables in it were under cooked (my guess is strait from a bag of frozen mixed veg and not cooked first) and the meat had that funny after taste in addition to being slimy and gummy like it wasn't the first time it had been reheated.

The lo mien was really really greasy, the chicken in it was all badly cut up and most of it was in a solid clump on the bottom. It looked like someone tried to cut up a chicken thigh but never made it all the way though the meat. Again, the meat had that weird after taste (like it was reheated in the microwave) and it was slimy.

The delivery took over an hour, the food was barely warm, the delivery guy himself was pleasant enough but that's not saying much when everything else was just horrible. We would never eat food from this place again!",LsB-Wc7MOjTQa1vBgWWwbA,1,0,1,5obMZXvYbadJN2p8TMDLHw
