They have free garlic toasts & bread next to the salad bar. Free soft-serve ice cream!

Chicken Pot Pie soup is yummy. Looking forward to going back to try the Tomato Basil & Broccoli Cheddar.

My sandwich was nice and fresh. It could've used more mustard, because only some bites had it.

I also ordered a wrap, but in panini bread. They forgot to put it in the panini bread and served me a wrap. Not a big deal. Harmless mistake.

Good portion size. A half sandwich & soup fills you up.

Got a free cookie for filling out a quick survey on my phone.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,0,0,4,pQDv0Y8h-TqATd-J-qFFnA

After that miscommunication everything seemed to be fine until some citizen came in and used the restroom and stuck their bare hands in the trail mix instead of using the tongs, and then just left, disgusted by the lack of recognition I notified the unaware staff and they removed the container of trail mix.

They have a fantastic menu with food that will keep you begging for more, actually, with the size of the sandwiches that are here, you will make yourself sick if you get more. In addition to the sandwiches, Jason's Deli has a plethora of good drinks and salad bar accessories. In addition, they have a soft-serve ice cream machine, which is free when you get the salad bar. 

Definitely a borderline 5 star restaurant, but the one major thing that holds me at 4 is the fact that they do not have sourdough bread (my favorite).

It consisted of a large garden salad with all the trimmings and chicken, an order of penne pasta w/tuna, homemade salsa with corn chips, side of fruit, slice of carrot cake, and a half whole grain wheat turkey sandwich and a juice. The only item I could salvage was the packaged carrot cake, the bag of blue chips and the bottled juice. The total came to $30.00...which I guess seems a little expensive for just one person. With every single item that was prepared self handedly was indigestible.  I honestly end up emptying the entire salad in the trash; the penne pasta was horrible cause it had everything inside it but tuna and I'm not even sure what was in it, so that ended up in the waste. The salsa was inedible. The whole wheat bread was hard and it wasn't even toasted. I actually had to waste the sandwich as well cause I couldn't even bite. I am totally furious, frustrated, and disgusted with Jason's Deli and that is a first. I'm so completely surprised by the food I was just given. I just placed another order with Jason's a week ago at the Henderson, NV location and it was a total Jekyll & hide situation, cause that food was the total opposite of what I received today. I chalk it up to Vegas cause since I've been here, which has been about two months so far, everything in VEGAS has sucked. I'm not going to crucify Jason's just because this location SUCKED...but I won't ever come back to this one and that's why this review is being posted because I want to warn any other future ones, so that don't receive the same terrible service.",bhe1ex8-c7MtWk-1grI70A,0,0,1,xfxTZG5ivoiUf4Ww50UXkQ

I called about two weeks before to see when would be best to order and she said the day before or day of was fine.  I explained that the day before my wedding was Thanksgiving, and she said that it was no problem.  So I called on Thanksgiving day and they were closed.  
So then I was a little nervous, but I called first thing the morning of and it was no problem.  I was a little annoyed because it was just one more thing I had to worry about on the day, but I think that if the wedding was any other day, other than the day before a holiday, it would have been fine.  

The food was awesome.  It was presented beautifully, it was fresh, and it was really good.   We got the wrap platter, the sampler platter, a veggie tray, & a platter with muffins, breads, and coffee cakes.  The only reason I gave them a 4 stars is because I also ordered juice, coffee, and cans of pop.  They forgot all the drinks.

Their menu has many items to chose from.
People working there didn't seem like they enjoyed what they were doing and from some  you wouldn't even get a good feeling from them which is not good for business. Well, I don't like fake smiles either but at least one should be pleasant.

She probably meant that they weren't on, sooo whatever. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning.

I got the muffaletta sandwich with salami for the boy. It was on thick, flavorful bread with cheese, olives, hearty portions of salami and what tasted like pepperoncini. It came with a bag of chips and a cup of soup [I opted for the tortilla] for about $8-9 after tax. The soup was really tasty, made with beef and full of rich umami flavor and vegetables. I saw tomatoes, carrots, corn and lots of herbs. 

The sandwich was a generous portion and I like that it came with two sides. I find this comparable to Quizno's 2 items for $6. I'd say this restaurant is much higher quality, though. For a dollar or two more you can get an organic salad topped with a delicious array of toppings. I would like to go in sometime for their salad bar, it looked quite promising from what I could see.

Their menu was big, with lots of sandwiches, po'boy subs, paninins, BIG (I mean like almost foot long big) baked potatoes, soups, wraps, pasta, and even a full service salad bar with all the fixins'.  I had never been there before so I asked what suggestions they had.  The order taker told me to try the 'New York Yankee'.  It is a sandwich made with pastrami and corned beef on rye bread, with Swiss cheese and mustard.  It also came with chips and a pickle.  It was a great first choice, this bad boy was huge!  The sandwich itself was like 6 inches in height.  The pastrami and corned beef were moist and flavorful, and went great with the Swiss and rye.  Not half bad for only $7.99.

Their sweet tea is pretty bomb too, almost as good as Raising Cane's.  Cane's is better mainly because of their pellet-shaped ice.  Their salad bar is nothing to laugh at either.  Lots of fresh choices, and even whole hard-boiled eggs which were great (unlike Sweet Tomatoes where they shred it up).  They even have free Garlic Toast and mini muffins, as well as various crackers that are complimentary to all patrons.  Not just that...but they also have free soft serve ice cream!  Well, free if you buy something to eat.  On second thought, I never asked if ice cream came with everything on the menu.  I kinda just helped myself to the machine everytime I ate there.  Nonetheless, I never got busted for it.  So.....therefore, it must be free!

Not a bad place to have a great lunch with a bunch of your friends.  I would have given this place 5 stars, but I went there recently for dinner and found out the portions aren't quite what they used to be.  It was rather slow with no one in there.

Afterward enjoy the free ice cream (also at the bar) -neat huh? 

Nice that there is a lighter menu listing calories (turkey reuben is pretty good at 510 calories and 13 grams of fat). Vegetarian items are denoted with a v on the regular menu.

Sandwiches (specials or build your own- you choose everything), combos (choose full, half, or quarter sandwiches), wraps, soups, salads, potatoes, pasta, sides, fruit, kids menu, and dessert. For years, I've been curious about the muffaletta- meat or veggie, bread with zesty olive mix, antipasti, olive oil, & provolone cheese (featured on the Food Network). I might get it next time. 

Spacious (think tee pee), clean, casual place to get good sandwiches (pretty big too) at a reasonable price. Sometimes I bring home leftovers- eat only half the sandwich, depending on what I get. Bathrooms around the corner. 

It's been a while since we've been here, but we are fans. If the parking situation frustrates you (a complaint of my mil's), you can go to the other location in downtown, in that newer office building- you can see it off the 95 freeway.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,0,4,XUA9R0VgbLuLAKCtFisYUw

I noticed they had a muffaletta sandwich and you do not see that New Orleans based sandwich very often in these parts so I decided to hop on it. Super friendly and fast in taking my order for to-go until a little issue came up...

While I was ordering, a cantankerous older man came up and told the cashier that he did not want his bread toasted and that his sandwich came toasted anyways. He then proceeded to curse loudly, saying things like ""I CAN'T F*ING EAT THAT TOASTED SHIT"" and grumbling about the service and effing up his order. Here is where it went wrong for me...they totally bent for this guy. A man that is losing his mind over his bread being toasted? And you don't tell him to calm down, or wait his turn, or even kick him out for being disruptive? It is not the staff's fault that this guy barged in on my ordering time and also made me feel uncomfortable but they can make a point with this guy. They stopped attending to my order to help him out. 

As far as my food, the bread was covered in sesame seeds but was slightly stale. A lot of bread to that sandwich. I also tried the tomato basil soup which I cannot complain about. For about $8, I got a quarter of a thick sandwich, some chips, a pickle, and small soup cup. With the weird way things went down the and ""mehness"" of the food, I am not sure I will be hankering to go back there anytime soon.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,2,2,2,ftoeD6jscDLuZM5W8y0FwQ

Not only was the ordering process online extremely easy - including making substitutions -- but the service, food and selection was awesome.

He quickly set out the food and after touching base on the plan for the following morning I felt confident that Day 2 would even go smoother. 

Day 2 resulted in a last minuted classroom change but it was no problem for Jason's Deli--Joey knew exactly where to unload and delivery was super fast.

Our group of over 45 was extremely satisfied with the food selection and I was super happy that breakfast both days was so stress free.

  IMO they are kind of pricey. $9 something for a BLT with potato chips and soda is a couple dollars short of a full service restaurant. For a $7 BLT, at least give a choice of fries. Nearly $8 for the salad bar is not a bargain, when you could have all you can eat salad at any buffet. Even the worst of the worst buffets cannot ruin salad (well maybe a few)

  I rate the quality of the BLT, served on a double layer of wheat bread as high. The baked Lays is the same quality of the baked Lays I eat at home.

 This Jason's Deli is enormous. I appreciated that it was easy to find a table and that there were not people on top of me.

I have always liked their sandwiches, salad bar, and soups.  

We are in Vegas for a wedding and decided to go to Jason's Deli for a quick bit to eat, it was getting late and we were hungry.  I am not sure what time the majority of Jason's Delis close, but this one closes at 9 PM.  We got there about 8:50.  I figure like most restaurants they will let us stay and eat even when they have ""locked"" the doors.  Which is kind of surprising they will close at 10, they aren't far off the Strip, and Vegas doesn't sleep...right?!  

We grabbed 5 bowls of soup, and a salad bar.  I chose the Seafood Gumbo.  It was ok, nothing compared to gumbo from N'awlins, but it was ok.  Not sure if it was the time or if this is how they always prepare it, but it was microwaved.  It wasn't hot(temperature), but it was sufficiently warm.  I also got the Salad bar, they were cleaning it up before 9 PM, so I had to be fast to get a few things.  I was a little disappointed, I know they want to be done with work and roll out ASAP, but at least wait until a customer is finished!  If they wanted to clean it up, they should have let me know so I wouldn't have ordered the Salad bar!    

For that reason alone I am only rating this location 3 stars.  Poor customer relations.  The food is still good, and I will visit another Jason's, just hopefully not 10 minutes before they close!",be_oI-PCDFGil2M-MEX64g,0,0,3,P579ldtapHjl6hOzqqf5lQ

5278260,2015-05-01,3,-_yEVC3_3M6YOsamYfNFEw,"To be fair, I didn't have a choice in what I ordered at Jason's Deli. I was simply handed a spinach veggie wrap for lunch (part of the perks of working in an office where luncheons are pretty frequent). If I was to walk in Jason's Deli on my own, I would've ordered the Caprese Panini, Grilled Cheese & Tomato Soup Combo, Black Bean Taco Salad, or the Zucchini Garden Pasta from the awesome Vegetarian Menu offered at Jason's. Pretty much anything BUT that wrap. So, please take my review with a grain of salt. 

SPINACH VEGGIE WRAP: The wrap just wasn't my cup of tea. Not that it was bad, but I don't really like anything with onions or guacamole on it. Besides these ingredients, there was loads of spinach, mushroom, tomatoes, and cheese. I liked that the take-out meal came with a side of salsa, a bag of organic tortilla chips, and an individually wrapped pickle. So cute.   

Worth a return visit?
My take-out lunch was my first experience at Jason's Deli. I'm definitely intrigued by the vegetarian menu, and look forward to trying Jason's on my own terms.

With so many university students around, this area caters to students who lack a large sum of money. There were three people in my party and our meal came out to roughly 17 dollars. 

They lack a menu board and once you look at the paper copy you will understand why. One of my friends almost cracked and cry under the pressure of finding what he wanted in the vast abyss of options. We had to tell two other groups to go ahead of us and then wing. He ended up getting egg salad and didn't seem too impress or disappointed. Another friend got the manager special, a half sandwich and soup combo. She also seemed satisfied. So you might ask why I gave it such a high rating. The reason, even though their sandwiches are nothing too spectacular, I love their salad bar. Although it is small, the selection of ingredients are high quality. The upkeep of vegetables are spectacular, giving the bar a vibrancy of colors. If  you are in search of a light lunch, you can order a side salad with a friend that is getting a sandwich because it only costs $4.49. Otherwise the $7.49 price is still a great deal for full reign over the whole bar.  When I want a sandwich, I will normally order the quarter turkey muff. This place is full of surprises, because a quarter is still humongous. It consists of a dense New Orleans' style muffaletta bread, topped with an olive tapenade, antipesti, and melted provolone cheese. For $6 and change, that is a steal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,nAixaDioVO-qONHHnK3FVQ

I'm not sure why Jason's has enough seating for a Roman Legion and a single salad bar. Has this place ever been to capacity, and if so, WHERE did they all park?

Parking is a freaking nightmare because it shares the parking lot with a Wingstop and Seafood City and a few other businesses. 

In general, their salad bar is a great deal and I can't recommend their gingerbread bites enough. They are killer.

My beef with Jason's is that they slice all of their vegetables as if they're going to go on a burger, rather than dicing them, which can make eating a salad look pretty beast-like (imagine Beast eating porridge for the first time in Beauty & the Beast) if you accidently miss cutting a slice of bell pepper or onion completely before stabbing it with your fork.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,0,3,bWiJQQG3Q8ODijkCazKs0A

The person actually taking orders was doing so over a deli counter, not at a register like you would expect.  My husband ordered the zucchini grilled sandwich (see below) and I added the side salad (1 trip to the bar - $4.79) for myself.  The salad bar at Jason's is great - everything is fresh, I love the hummus, and you get unlimited crackers, pickles and pepperocinis (which makes me happy).  That is the only reason I won't give this place 1 star.  Here is the breakdown about the rest of our experience:

We paid $7 for the craptacular ""zucchini grilled"" sandwich.  Here is a break down of the MENU description vs. what we actually got:

-Grilled zucchini - the zucchini, which made up the majority of the sandwich, was steamed and soggy, not grilled whatsoever

-muenster - we asked for no cheese and the sandwich came drenched in greasy cheese, so I had to ask for it to be remade which took over 10 minutes.  There was no apology for getting the order wrong and they seemed bothered to have to do it over

-organic spinach - there were only a few small leaves, barely noticeable

-red onions - there was an excessive amount of onions

-roma tomatoes - it had tomatoes, but they were not romas

-kalamata olives - there were a few olives

-roasted red pepper hummus - their hummus is tasty, but the sandwich came with a tiny dab

-toasted on 9-grain artisan bread - the bread seemed like a wheat bread from the grocery store, not ""artisan""

We requested baked chips and got the regular kind. When we mentioned it, they brought a small cup with some baked chips in it

Overall, the food was overpriced, service was definitely lacking.  I won't be back.",xOYcxGg14AiKw3JNUzCUzg,2,0,2,e4pb5HRpHgVCTjN5YgtI-Q

However, our food was over an hour late and cold. The only reason I'm giving them a star is because the driver was really nice and did call to let us know he was in traffic, it still took another 40 minutes to make a 15 minute trip. This is so the most disappointing experience with a Jason's.

But, now that I have, I must say that I agree with the overall 4-star rating this establishment currently enjoys.  Chicken Noodle Soup with tender morsels of chicken, carrots, and thick noodles was hot and with a distinctly flavored chicken broth that was more robust than most.  My Ham & Hard Salami Quarter-Muffaletta was packed with meat that melded well with the minced olives and tasted great after being squeezed together by the top and bottom of the delicious yielding, toasted, and sesame-covered New Orleans style bun.

And, Diane's Beefeater was packed in a soft French Roll with even more lean meat and a huge expanse of well-melted Provolone Cheese.  A generous amount of hot au jus stood by in a bowl for serious dunking.  It was redolent of beef, with a rich flavor of meat juices that tasted great!  Pickle spears were good, but chips just the type that had been poured out of a commercially sold bag.

The place is nothing fancy, but it is serviceable and comfortable, with plenty of table and booth seating available to accommodate a large lunchtime crowd.  Table tops were continually in the process of being cleared and cleaned by a large and efficient staff as soon as a diner got up and began to leave.  

On this occasion I found a Quarter-Muffaletta to be adequate.  But next time I am going to attack a Half-Muffaletta, and see if I can handle it in one sitting.  A Whole-Muffaletta is a beast that would be more suitable for an episode of ""Man vs. Food!""",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,4,GNQP12_YocMIgilHgnovAA

As you walk into Jason's Deli, you're immediately guided to the counter by a walkway. The man behind the counter was new but super friendly and able to answer most of my questions. Service at this location was top notch.

As for the food. Take note, I didn't notice the Reuben (or I would have ordered it) so I went with a Muffaletta which is a grilled sandwich coated to the edges with their olive spread. I had the quarter roasted turkey. The olive spread was divine but the sandwich itself wasn't to my liking. The cheese hadn't melted and the meats were still cold. If I order a grilled sandwich, I want it hot. I was very disappointed with the temperature. Even more so when I actually saw the Rueben that someone else had ordered. 

The service here made this whole experience standout. Especially Teddy who deserves Five-Stars. He was running circles around his coworkers, bussing tables, asking people if they were enjoying everything. He was a kind man and deserves to be celebrated.

It was an easy process to place the platters order for 12 people. I called a couple days before and they took my order over the phone. They also took my credit card payment. On the day off, we had the best delivery driver ever. There was a shooting on the Las Vegas strip and they closed the whole entire strip. No cars allowed at all. Traffics were bad every direction on Las Vegas freeways. Our delivery driver called me every 15 minutes or so to update me where his location was so I wasn't panicked.

He got  there not too long after with our party platters. He was so nice, he even brought our food to our suite. The breakfast sandwiches were still warm. Fruits were fresh, and even the coffee jug was still warm. Everything were tasty and we were happy we had food while we were getting ready for our big day. It made me one less cranky bridezilla ;).
