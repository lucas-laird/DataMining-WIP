A second employee finally started to assist after a long wait. Asked for extra chicken did not get it, vegetables were not so fresh and they barley wanted to put any sides on, had to ask for a little more. Took 25 minutes to get my order. No tip today and I always tip.",mSLA4vDjYFLQU7O5jj5LbQ,0,0,2,eooDfFugtLuX9mbO3Y3cpA

They are racist. I got so embarrassed when I got there. No welcome with blunt face.
When I asked him to add an eggs in my sandwich, he told me "" what? What? Do you want eggs?"" He kept his fucking attitude again and again. He didn't smile at all when we're facing. He didn't wanna talk with me.
Just looking at vegetables on and on. Lol
I've been in many place in vegas and everybody is nice. 
It's horrible place I never been.
Fucking white guy ass hole. -_-

1036455,2015-10-02,0,2bSyNMam79SlwiHwQD6RGg,Avoid this place!!! I just left this subway that I've been going to for years  sometimes 6 days a week and I always tip at least a dollar but not today the place was filthy the lady who made my breakfast sandwich who I assume  they picked up in front of the home depot speaks no English I always pay $7.50 for the same breakfast sandwich every morning for years and when the cashier George told me my total was around $12 I lost it when I asked George why so much he insisted on arguing with me his customer service is non existent when I asked to talk to the manager he told me he doesn't work there anymore and to have a nice day so I left my overpriced cold egg white sandwich on the counter and left I'll take my business elsewhere I hope George has a nice day now that you pushed away a loyal customer for years I recommend firing George before he pushes away more customers,2AFU16oLbRYMrBAn80K4vw,1,0,1,fetVEpSDosou2mGAVEyovQ
1057340,2015-11-24,0,2bSyNMam79SlwiHwQD6RGg,"when im trying to some what eat a little ""healthier"" i always come by this Subway for a delicious sandwich!  now, when I was younger and my dad would take me to Subway i always disliked the experience because for some reason i always had rude people making my sandwich, telling me to speak up or just overall making me in comfortable while trying to put my sandwich together. not at this place!! every person that works here has a super awesome attitude! (which is even better considering some assholes ive seen these people deal with while ive waited in line) my favorite person at this shop is Hilda, who I actually met on her first day, she seemed so nervous but was very polite and intently listened to what you asked of her. now when my room mate and i debate on going to subway, we just say 'should we go see Hilda?'. :) 
food itself is good, never once have gotten sick from the cold cuts, veggies are never wilted, and they always have the bread i want in stock even when we stop in at 2am for a drunken meal. the only sub shop for me!",0H-zIyvxf94D11173f63xg,0,0,5,hpdE0BeLXusoHxf7FoRc4g

My husband went in and ordered me my usually sandwich.  Turkey, lettuce, pickles, Mayo, salt, pepper.

But unfortunately when he brought it home there was no way I could eat it. It was loaded with salt and pepper . All I kept thinking about was the sodium packed bites. In case I was just thinking too much into it , I had my husband try it , and he couldn't believe it... 

Too many shakes with that salt and pepper shaker!",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,2,1,2,ckIjSqoRKzTp9W-6_B7sAQ

The layout of this place seems to make more sense than other stores further west of this location.

The people here are super, super friendly and they make it kind of fun to order your food.  The ingredients do seem a bit more fresh than other Subways I go to as well.
