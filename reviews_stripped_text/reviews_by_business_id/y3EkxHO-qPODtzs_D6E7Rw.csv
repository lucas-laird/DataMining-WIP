14401,2016-12-24,0,y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,Food was good and fresh. But the service was horrible!  It isn't traditional dim sum where they roll out the carts; you order off a menu.  The staff didn't even come over to ask us for tea or check on our order.  We had to flag them down.  Asked for condiments three times and it took ten minutes before they got it to us.  Staff needs major retraining if this place is going to succeed in the long haul.,1qoPxoAJVqjuRrCLpD2KkQ,0,0,1,Wn8KxNGHclVQAr6GYZMfFA

We ordered 9 different items, and I have no complaints about any of them. The food was absolutely delicious! The colorful soup dumplings was the priciest item we ordered but it's well worth it! 

As far as service, my tea never dropped below half. Someone was always nearby to refill and make sure everything was okay. The orders came out in a timely manner and everything was correct!

On our last trip to LV, April 2017, we went to check out The Dragon. The casino was slow and we we're getting hungry. We went to the walk-up window down stairs. There was no cook. Limited menu. We were disappointed until we shared our disappointed with one of the girls who worked the casino floor. She said, ""Oh!  Go upstairs. You wouldn't be disappointed."" We thought those we're all rooms but there was mezzanine with a restaurant, Pearl Ocean.  

We were quickly seated. Quickly waited on which looked liked a very business lunch. We were handed a tri-fold with numbered menu items- just pencil the number of items you want.  They made a special allergy request for my husband; very nice! We order Chinese broccoli, dumplings,  buns and thin noodles. All delicious. Very light. Not greasy. All very fresh.

As with most new places there will be menu changes but this isn't exactly a cheap place for dim sum and they had the quality with selection going on. Today, they didn't have BBQ pork bun or custard which is staples in dim sum. No chili oil either and the hot sauce they provided was more sweet than spicy.

947038,2017-03-11,1,y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"Due to food credits we received in the mail from Lucky dragon casino, we tried the Pearl Ocean restaurant a few days ago. It was located in the second floor of the casino. Before going inside we decided to look at the menu and was surprised with the high prices. We asked if we can just order for take out and the host told us we can but it may take up to 2 hours wait. She said that we can go and gamble first and they will call us when the order is ready in about 2 hours. Upon hearing that we decided just to stay and get a table instead. Surprisingly, the place was half empty and we had a table right away. We were able to order in about 10 minutes and the food was served to us in 15 minutes. Through the recommendation of the waitress, we ordered the Empress free range chicken for 36.00, wonton soup for 18.00,  and scallop fried rice for 19.00. The fried rice came and it looked like it was not enough for the 4 of us so we ordered 2 steam rice. The wonton soup was served in a bowl which had about 3 to 4 wonton. What caught our attention was the whole chicken that was flattened on a plate and chopped into pieces. The chicken was so white with the skin on that it looked like it was raw. We took a bite and the chicken was cold like it came out of the refrigerator. We immediately asked the waitress if this is normal and she said it is served cold. We did not argue and I told my wife just to eat what we can so we can leave. We did not become difficult customers or complained. We just asked for the bill and left. Of course the bill came for a total of almost 90.90. I told myself that I would write a review at Yelp (this is my first time by the way) just to share our families experience with Pearl Ocean.

Overall, the place looks nice but I think its over priced. The whole rotisserie chicken sold at Costco for 5.99 looked really good in my mind while I was starring at that chicken we ordered. 

Sorry for the long review but I couldn't keep it short and sweet without losing the good details. Thanks.",-XEL0NbEmgzmYo5djFOVSw,1,0,1,psVIkI4ALq6K4DaWMcuuAw

1030495,2016-11-26,5,y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"Beautiful restaurant, but food and service was not worth the price.

SERVICE: Right off the back, I have to talk about their service. The restaurant was pretty empty so you would think you get to be seated immediately, however that's not the case with this restaurant. The host asked my party to wait 30 mins before we could be seated and said ""we don't have enough servers and cooks at the moment."" This restaurant is new an already short staffed! Once my party was seated, it took forever before someone finally came to take our drink order. The waiters here speak Chinese to ALL they customers.....I don't know any Chinese! I understand that this restaurant is in a casino tailored to Chinese customers, but they should speak English to their American customers...

ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant is oval shaped with private booths along the wall and a bunch of tables in the middle. The restaurant is really pretty in decor. The ceiling has a nice texture, the walls are pretty, the chandelier is beautiful, and the booths are colorful. The table setting is decent with a plate, chopsticks, fork, and tea cup. Worst thing about this restaurant, the tables are so small! There was no room for the food because the table settings took up most of the table.

FOOD: The food is authentic chinese food that isn't too bad. The honey walnut shrimp is definitely the best dish on their menu. The rest of the dishes were good, but wasn't anything special. The menu is different from some of the off-strip Chinese restaurants. They have a lot of unique and creative dishes I have never seen or heard of before. So don't expect to find orange chicken and chow mein like you would at other restaurants! They have dim sum dishes, Chinese entrees, and course menus. The food here is pricy so be warned. Everything is double the price you would get off-strip. The presentation of the food is decent for an Asian restaurant. Many of the dishes were not available to order.

OVERALL: The food wasn't too bad. Would of liked more options on their menu that are basic Chinese dishes, I feel like their menu is trying too hard to be unique. The tables are small and cramped. The service here is not in the favor of the American customers, they are friendlier to those who speak Chinese. Everything is over-priced.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,16,7,3,EN8ikv28aii-AQ3T6oaWdQ

Dim sum came out one dish at a time and it was a painful experience for our large group to finish and wait for the next round.  Food also came out cold to the core and we had to send them back to the kitchen to reheat and more waiting.  The manager did not apologize nor say a word, and he even gave us a dirty look.

I didn't order much but just one of the signature dishes - lobster dumplings made from whole lobster.i can only comment based on this dish and a few others. Cantonese style lobster with ginger and spring onion is my favorite dish of all time so I know lobster. The dumpings are good however, 1) only the top part is clearly made from lobster, the rest can be mixed with shrimps and other materials. 2) the lobster with she'll was fried. My experience told me that good and fresh seafood dishes typically do not heavily seasoned or fried. This dish costs $48. So, price vs quantity, I give 6/10 from my scale. The restaurant overall is nice. However, the open hour is wrong in Yelp as well as open table - 11am instead of 10am, so I forced to wait for an extra hour. The staff and services are good. one or two of the dishes ordered are luke warm, that's a no no to me. I am guessing the other dishes may be good but I lost interested about this restaurant already. I give 7/10 for the restaurant itself. Barry

1744657,2017-09-12,15,y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"Pearl Ocean is by far the best Chinese food I've had in Vegas--but also the priciest. Luckily I won a dining voucher (YAY! Thanks YelpLV!) which helped alleviate the cost. They also have a 20% off locals discount as well, though the offers could not be combined. But yes, this place is so so pricey.

I went with my parents around 3PM, which I know is an awkward time to eat. We missed the dim sum service but were very pleasantly surprised by their dinner menu. We kind of went crazy with the food since we had the voucher. The servers are fluent in both Cantonese and Mandarin and proficient in English as well. 

We ordered: jellyfish & ham hock, crab meat & fish maw chowder, sauteed scallops with XO sauce, five guys XLB, steamed tofu and eggplant chiu chow style, fried scallop and egg white fried rice, and herbal turtle essence. Overall, the meal was super enjoyable. They brought out red vinegar and pepper to accompany the soup, just like how you're supposed to do it! I was very happy with the authenticity. The dishes were flavorful and reminded me of all the Chinese food I had eaten growing up in the SGV (Chinese food mecca of the US~). However, portions were on the smaller side and were very pricey. The soup was $22, but I can get a bigger bowl for $13 in SoCal.

Now I have to address the Five Guys XLB. It was all over instagram and is all over the photos for Pearl Ocean's yelp. I'm not sure if I just went at an awkward time, but I would imagine they would steam the XLB when ordered. The skin was pretty thick and very dry. XLB should be bursting with soup when you bite into it--there was none. Despite the pretty colors, there were no distinctive flavors between the different XLB. Of all the dishes, this one was the most disappointing. 

Pros: 
quick, attentive service
servers were fluent in both major chinese dialects
authentic, tasty flavors (if you chose the traditional dishes)

Cons:
FIVE GUYS XLB IS NOT WORTH
THE PRICE
portions on the smaller side

They charge $2/pp for choice of regular teas, or you can fork out some more dough for premium tea by the pot.

Overall, its a solid place to get dim sum on the Strip.  Pricey, but lower than what you would find at Bellagio and somewhat more convenient than going to Rio.  No where near the quality of Bay Area, Seattle, or LA, but decent.  Favorite items were:

* Five Guys Xiao Long Bao: each color has a skin made using different ingredient.  Green for kale, Black for squid ink, etc.  The regular pork Xiao Long Bao were decent too.
*Staples like Har Gow and Pork and Shrimp Shu Mai were solid, as was sticky chicken rice.
*Spicy Wontons were nice - more sweeter than spicy with a gentle kick.  Packed with lots of shrimp!

Some shortcomings
* Beef Chow Fun a bit oily, and had way more beef than noodles.  Its better than the reverse situation but still the dish seemed unbalanced.
* Pork Spare Ribs in Black Bean had good flavor but the meat was tougher than expected. 

Overall, not bad.  Lunch for six people about $200 including tip and tax.",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,9,5,3,LVbY4mVV47mYJM4KpOJnmQ

Had two young ones with who had a hard time with the menu, but we're we ignored their pain, promised them pizza back at the room and they remained quiet while we enjoyed pot stickers, BBQ  sweet buns, fried rice, vinegar ribs and honey walnut shrimp. Fantastic flavors, perfectly cooked items, attentive service. What more can you ask for. As a non-Asian, I cannot vouch for  authenticity. However, the lack of things like heavily breaded sweet and sour mystery meat on the menu and the fact that we were the only Caucasians  in the place, might indicate they cook for their pleasure.

The pricing on dim sum is outrageously expensive. Food is terrible, full of lard and MSG. Chicken Paw was a frozen dish regurgitated - fridge odor was present.

We had the following:

Steam Pork Bun - B+ 
Baked Pork Bun - D.  Good flavor, full of lard though.
Shrimp Har Gow - D. Have never seen Har Gow that huge. Some pork fat was in the Har Gow.
Chicken Paw - F.
Bean Curd Wrap - C. MSG laden. 
XO Daikon Cake - C. 
XO Rice Roll - C.

In addition, they charge Hot Sauce and Soy Sauce at $7+  each.

With tea at $2 a person, and the charge on the condiments, total bill came up to over $60 without sales tax and gratuities. Even with a 25% discount for local residents, it is close to $60 for 2 of us.  With the food quality the way it is, definitely not worth the experience. 

We went there on a Wednesday afternoon at 12.45 pm. Were we surprised that the whole restaurant has only 2 other tables. Lots of waiter and waitresses running around though. This place cannot be in business long.",35sxzW8p-FGCN4_XB78FCQ,0,0,1,1AKczxzehhDy-NwoGr-RFA

Pearl Ocean located in the Lucky Dragon. Second reason came for dim sum never been to Lucky Dragon so got to walk about small property for the first time. Pearl Ocean located on the  second floor. I meet up with friends visiting right when they open at 11am. I was surprise but there was another group that was waiting before the doors open. It got me excited thinking that good sign people line up before the place even opens?? lol. The restaurant interior is really cool. It has lot of personality and kind of big circle open area dining area and all along the outside have booths. The artwork on the walls look all original and pretty cool designs, Very open relax vibe with the high ceilings in the restaurant. 

The food there was three of us. We did decent job of taking down small part of good size menu. Think in all ordered something like eight to 10 dishes all together. So rather then  write them all out. I just tell you the ones that stood for me. The Dumpling section was one of my favorites. Two dishes ordered the squid ink and shrimp xo dumplings that out of control tasty. The squid ink love the color! The fillings in both were solid. The short ribs were good but not person like work for the food. Just me. The noodles dishes were also stand out section. The pan fried noodle with seafood could have had whole plate and be in noodle heaven. It nice hearty with lots of different seafood and nice assortment of vegetables. The thing about the noodle dishes feel like more like normal size then dim sum size. It also reflected in the price just fyi. The boiled beef with enoki mushrooms had no expectations. It ended up being solid choice. It extremely light because the mushrooms and sprouts are the carbs so to speak. It was really refreshing and good one throw in the mix. The dessert section was da bomb!! Make sure you have room and just order it once your done instead of it coming with everything else. We got the sesame seed balls, and mango pudding. Both of them could have had whole portion to myself. The sesame balls talk about #tbt remember growing up in Hawaii going eat at the food court at ala moana and getting the sesame balls. Perfect dessert treat. It just like andagi. It fried donut with outside rolled in sesame seeds and the inside the filling devine and moist. The Mango Pudding is nice creamy and nice balance of Mango and something else. The color is perfect!!! I know missing couple entree but once started coming out lose track...hell dim sum once comes never stops.

One thing that made this dim sum experience no doubt stand out or the lack of dim sum gone to in life. I have always experience traditional with multiple carts that go around and pick the food. Rather enjoy looking at the menu (most part picture of all the items, like list the items by sections, and list prices although some market price so check) then mark stuff on the list and the waiter or waitress checks it off as it comes. Your more then welcome add stuff as you go along. More like normal restaurant comes out then look at the carts and thinking how long that batch been in the cart. 

The service for us nothing but five stars.  The waiter was on it the whole time. He helped us make great selections since it was all of our first time. One thing needs shout out yelp community. My friends reading helpful review mention that local get 20% discount. Mahalos. We asked the waiter and he like for sure just showed him my nevada driver license (just need one id for the bill). He also mention that if have Lucky Dragon players club card get additional 5% off the bill. So we went downstairs all got one. Next go around 25% off the bill. Really not think of dim sum or many restaurants get that kind of discount. It helps cause dim sum might think cheap but the more plates get it adds up REAL quick. 

No doubt plan on coming back again.....!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,8,5,4,kZ1gHVNqqt6Y7St9pqZWlw

Count on the older Asian generations to fish out home food wherever they travel. Not like I wasn't missing my white rice anyway, no complaints if bbq duck is on the menu either. Thursday night in Vegas for dinner on the strip is bumpin, Thursday night at Lucky Dragon isn't as rowdy. Hotel was out of the way and empty. It is a newer hotel but it's a sketchier part off the strip. Casino downstairs had more employees than guests, and inside the restaurant had 5 other tables aside from us. Just a lot of employees standing around watching everyone.  

Service was okay, he was friendly, but not really knowledgeable about the menu. We asked for recommendations and what were some popular items on the menu. Aside from being flustered with the question, he directed us back to the menu with ""well they are all pretty popular.."" Oh, yeah? How helpful that was. 

Crab Meat Fish Maw Chowder - ($22) - This was yummy! But no matter where I go I always douse my bowl of soup with a ton of white pepper so my review on this is not going to be pretty helpful to those who take it pure. 
Half Roasted Duck - ($25) - Skin on the roasted duck was surprisingly really good, crispy layer that gave a good crunch and the fattier pieces on the dark meat had an immense amount of 
Steak Cubes in Wine Wasabi Aioli - ($28) - This cubed beef dish has similar flavoring as the viet shaking beef dish. Nice savory salty flavoring and presentation was unique with the nest. The wasabi aioli was unnecessary, I didn't like the mint like aftertaste that masked the beef flavor. 
Pea Shoots with Bean Curd Skin in Fish Broth - ($25) - soooooo expensive for the sad amount of veggies in this dish. 

The hotel overall looks nice, the dining room space is huge and there are a ton of tables. Food was also good, prices aren't worth it though. Wouldn't detour to give this place a try if you're on the strip. I'm sure there's better Chinese restaurants with a better bang for your buck.

Upon walking in, the lady in the entrance seated us right away. Although the hostess wasn't very welcoming. Didn't even smile at us, doesn't hurt to smile once in a while ;)

Ordered a few things, started off with the beef chow fun, and the shrimp with walnuts. That was super delish! The shrimp was huge!! But it only came with about 5 pieces of shrimp. Which wasn't bad. Ordered a few more things which included the beef enoki with bean sprouts, shrimp shumai dumplings, beef shumai, and the yummy juicy pork dumplings! Those 3 things were the highlight of our visit here! It was supppppper yums! If we could order this and only this, we would be perfectly okay with that! Then got the Mongolian beef bun. That was just okay.

Ended our meal with the sugar puff and taro puff. Taro puff was bleh......wasn't the best, but the sugar puff was everything! I would come back just for this.

Overall experience: 9/10. Our waiter, John, was super helpful in suggesting what he thought we'd like and the ladies bringing out our food were all so kind, teaching my boyfriend how to eat dim sum because he's never had it before. 

Only downside I did not like was the pricing. It was just a bit too pricey for my liking, but it was definitely a pretty restaurant. Would come back for more though, that's for sure!",Hj5TpJNOXqNt62Gbpr5WYw,28,24,4,S17MdduzX3gexitp1ATz9Q

For comparison, the same party dined at another dim sum restaurant the day before and spent $80 for a similar amount of food. The thing that stood out the most at this place, however, was the attentive service and the cleanliness of the restaurant. The inside was not smokey given that it was located inside a casino. 
I believe this restaurant might be associated with Koi Palace or Koi Garden in the Bay Area considering the tea pots were exactly the same with logos and all.

We had the following:
- XO clams: This was sautéed in chilis, garlic and though it was good, I bit into a cracked shell that was mixed in with the rest of the clams.  We paid high prices for this so I expected whole clams.
- sticky rice with meats: Satisfying..exactly what we got.
- egg puffs: This was not air crispy and chewy in the center as I would expect it to be.  The waiter came by and ask us how was our meal and I cannot resist telling him exactly how I had envisioned the egg puffs to be.  Shortly after, the head chef came out to apologize to us about the egg puffs and ask if he can whip up a new batch or sub it with a different dessert.  As it was nearing closing time, we respectfully declined the offer.  But, because of that level of service, it definitely made up for the shortcoming of the egg puffs.

There was a line here too but not as bad. The restaurant is inside the Lucky Dragon casino. It's new and doesn't have the disgusting stale smoke smell. 

The space is beautiful - with nice booths, tasteful artwork. The service was pretty good and speedy. The best part was dim sum itself.

It's fresh made lobster dumplings who can complain ? The presentation was glorious and they have that on point. But taste wise it was definitely mediocre. I liked the hargow way better (shrimp dumpling). Honestly consistency was somewhat mooshy, and lobster flavor was lacking . The shrimp with xo sauce was also just okay .. the ""juicy pork"" dumplings were also a huge let down . I got the specialty ""5 guys"" (5 different specialty flavors) but other than the color , the taste was almost confusing, tasted different ? But not prominent in flavor and not necessarily good . The regular ""juicy pork dumplings"" were mediocre as well .. definitely won't be ordering that again . Maybe I was expecting too much . The thing is, the basic dim sum was good, (hargow,siomai, pork spare ribs) and they have that going for them . But the hype and price really have me at a draw .

We ordered the 5 xiao long baos dish. It's hard to find a decent one here, as in no one has a decent one where the soup stays in the dumpling and there is actually enough soup inside the dumpling to be called a xiao long bao, or else it's just a long bao? The service is really good. The prices range from 12-30 something. We ordered 3 xiao long baos and one mustard green soup.

The baos came out in 5s. Each one colored differently depending on the filling: squid ink with truffle mushrooms was black, red beets, pork (white), yellow crab and salted fish, and spinach green. They were all tasty and unique. Each served in its own big spoon bowl. I call it spoon bowl because it seems to be cooked in it and looks like a spoon BUT you have to use another spoon to scrape it off to eat it. The bottom has a piece of carrot to keep it from sticking to the bowl, versus the traditional lettuce leaf (it didn't work as the bao clung onto the spoon/bowl much like a Kardashian clings to a camera crew). Each were flavored well enough where you do not need to dip it in the soy sauce dipping sauce that accompanied them. You have to use a spoon to dig the Bao off the spoon bowl.

The mustard green soup was tasty but may be a bit different for most American tastes. It has chicken strips, mustard green, century egg (black egg), tofu cubes, and ginger.

I don't know if the casino will be around long enough for you to try their cuisine as the place is not really busy. The bill came out to be $50+ for the soup and 3 orders of baos (dumplings).",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,2,1,4,sINJNKapmXFivf08caiB-w

5094865,2017-01-28,15,y3EkxHO-qPODtzs_D6E7Rw,"The Strip's newest Chinese eatery delivers with good food and possibly good fortune.

Well designed dining space with good feng shui, eights abound, four in any dish never appears on the table.  Everything screams amulets of good fortune and why not?  This is Vegas!

Like all other Chinese Strip restaurants, prices are very high, luxury ingredients abound and the best dishes are the most exotic.  If you want fried rice and general tzo chicken, this isn't the place for you.

Two standout dim sum dishes:  whole abalone minced chicken tart, and the whole lobster dumplings with fried claws.  The first, imagine a Chinese chicken and abalone pot pie done in a flaky, lard infused PET shell topped with a Chinese wine braised, tender abalone.  Rich, decadent, great textural contrast.    The second think har gow but instead of shrimp, sweet, succulent lobster tail meat.  Hints of ginger brighten up the lobster.  Deep fried, egg white coated shells (for sucking), claw meat and left over tail meat, though slightly overcooked, decorate the plate.  

top pick for dinner, the wine stewed oxtail in pumpkin bowl.  Well braised oxtail served in its naturally, gelatin charged sweet, earthy  jus is very good.  The braise is packed into a sweet pumpkin.  Together, simply good eats as the pumpkin's sweetness plays off  that of the beef while enhancing the gelatin richness.  The sea cucumber with sliced okra in a light chili sauce, is also very good.  I won't describe this, just give it a try.  It's not as weird as you imagine. A certain meat and potatoes, Midwest poker bud's favorite of the night.

Finally the whole Dungeness crab.  The body meat is sautéed with egg whites making them fluffy with a pronounced oceanic flavor, the legs deep fried and dusted with salted pepper.  Classic.

Tip:  Abalone lovers, the restaurant features a five course abalone pre fix.  $88.88 with minimum two orders.  A bargain compared to other abalone curses at major Strip eateries.

Asian service with language barriers.  All good, English menus so just point.  Decent selection of brown libations, perfect for celebratory shots between courses.

Though not as exotic or refined as some of the other Strip Chinese restaurants, Pearl Ocean delivers with solid selections and a side of good luck.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,23,4,zcU7-0IlCU72nhiDSmpLAw

If you go to China/ Hong Kong/ Macau, you can't really expect great service. The sooner they can get you out of the restaurant, the better so they can get more customers. That's good business. Don't expect a smile or warm fuzzies. But at Pearl Ocean, you only get that 60% of that vibe. Our server was smiley, friendly and apologetic for hiccups. Whereas in China, if they make a mistake they get mad at you for pointing it out.

The food...there were some dishes that were really well-executed and some that were just ok.

Mongolian Beef Buns:
3 buns stuffed with Mongolian beef (I feel like I just rephrased it). These were ok. Tasty, meaty but greasy 3/5.

Shrimp Dumplings with XO Sauce:
Slightly spicy. Dumpling skin a bit chewy 3/5.

Pork Dumpling in Chili Peanut Sauce:
This was a bit misleading. I did not taste peanut at all. I got spicy burning yet cool on the tongue - like if you licked your skin with Ben Gay by accident or experimentally lick a strip of Salonpas, this was exactly like that! But if you do enjoy Szechuan dishes, this dish might be for you 2/5.

Five Guys Xiao Long Bao:
I have every reason to like this. The colors were appealing and you get a variety. Each tastes great and unique. My favorite would have to be the Squid Ink and Truffle. Yum! Perfect skin: soup: meat ratio. These are huge. We ordered 3 of these but I'm glad they only gave us 1 order 5/5.

Boiled Beef Belly with Enoki:
It's as exciting as the name ""boiled Beef"" implies. Nothing spectacular but they only have a few beef dishes on the menu that's why we got this. What is logic? 2/5

BBQ Pork Puff:
We didn't really order these but somehow they landed on our table and we ate and paid for them anyway. Flakey pastry with meat inside. We liked them 4/5.

Oven-Roasted Duck:
Duck is fatty. I like my duck well-rendered to cut some of the fat off. The skin wasn't as crisp as I would've preferred. I've had better duck 2/5.

Roasted Pork Belly:
Oh, yes! This was fantastic! Fatty but meaty. The skin was super crunchy. One of the best I've had in Vegas 5/5.

BBQ Pork Crisp Rice Roll:
Sweet and savory. Great contrast of textures - soft chewy and crispy. Delightful! 4/5.

Mango Pudding:
Light yet creamy and mildly sweet. It's not artificial tasting at all. You can taste mango and a bit of coconut 5/5.

Egg Custard Tart (Dan Tat):
3 tiny warm egg tarts. Same quality as everywhere else 3/5.

Portuguese Egg Tart (Pasteis de Nata):
2 big warm egg tarts of the Portuguese kind (sweeter and bigger than Dan Tat). The last time I had these was when I went to Lisbon a few years ago (Pasteis de Belem) and they were the best. These weren't as good but I'll happily take them because I have no other choice 5/5.

It was interesting how we got our desserts before the savory entrees. We got stuff we didn't order and the ones we did order, we almost didn't get. We also got the same dishes brought to our table twice. There's obviously a lack of organization and communication going on but they've only been open a few days/weeks and I'm hopeful that would improve. Now, here's the kicker: price. Some items are priced on the menu while the others are a surprise. But for dim sum, this place is quite expensive.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,21,9,4,q1JRdhNMMeU5NY_x6HCFkg

We ordered 10 different dishes for 3 of us. The items were in a range of $5-$13. They charged $2 for tea / person. The chrysanthemum tea was very good so we thought $2 was reasonable. Overall, the roasted pork had perfect crispy skins and are well flavored. Xiao long bao, har gaw and pork spare rib in black bean were also good. The shrimp rice rolls were delicious but I prefer the rolls to be thinner.

PORTUGESE EGG TART IS A MUST!!! ( FYI you can find these egg tarts in KFC stores in Asia too!!!). However, if the layers could be thinner. the egg flavor could be stronger.

Squid ink dumplings had a weird texture. I feel like the ingredients of fillings did not go well together. Lava Egg Yolk Bun was okay since I prefer the egg yolk fillings to be smoother. We also tried Milk Fried Doughs and thought it was too sweet.

We ended up paying $40 per person, which already included tips. Personally i think it was expensive since I would expect something more yummy. The service was good but did not offset the price.",xmy1y1htU7UfPy_T5AgrEw,2,0,3,U0wt-bGS1UIktvz57RNh4A

Their crystal shrimp dumpling, shumai, lotus rice, were super delicious! I would not order the fried calamari ever again, though-- because the batter is really hard and lacked any seasoning. 

I'm not sure why they served us our sesame dessert balls first but I was ok with it!",aSYfuNtJ0ofU1L_1k0BR6w,0,0,4,o1ISbaUc2wHoteya5MfetQ

As for the food...the beef noodle soup was almost inedible.  The Shui Mai was average, but in its favor, the shrimp was fresh.  The BBQ pork bao was overly sweet, but okay.  The xiao long bao (regular) had excellent flavor, but the skin was thick and tough.

Might have been 3 stars without the poor service.",F3t3q6Jo0qSgllwAhT982Q,2,0,2,J0HswrSy5l0okjIyzhjo_A

The portion size was huge.  We ordered such a wide variety  of their offerings we had to move to the round table that served 10 people. 
Boy was it worth it.  We enjoyed Peking Duck, taro cubes, Five Guys dumplings, Baked Bao, chow funn, shu mai  and more.  We can't  wait to get back to Las Vegas so we can dine here again!

From our waiter, Deni, who was very caring and solicitous, to the authentic jasmine tea, to the meal itself, it was certainly a good experience! The duck was extra crispy and seasoned perfectly, the Xiao long bao one of the best I've  had and the squid ink dim sum was a delicious burst of flavors in your mouth! Definitely worth a 2nd (3rd, 4th, 5th) visit. They even gave us 20% discount for being locals",rGvtxaoBsiM7Em8LZ2ff3Q,0,0,5,7UQnhZh41Ww3YY-KTQihiw

I usually do. It going to casinos but this one I didn't mind since it was on the outskirts of all the Strip traffic. Yup a local here who doesn't really like the Strips traffic, but no worries I still make my way around, lol I just love complaining about it every chance I can!  Anyway back to my review!  I made my way to Pearl Ocean and tried a few if their dishes, and all I can say is they were tasty! My favorite dish by far is the lobster Dim Sum! It was fresh and so good! Never had that before and it probably won't be my last time.  Did I mention it was fresh?  They have a selection of fresh seafood to purchase.  
The decor and service was great, and I loved the wall paper it was cute.  My only complaint would be the lighting, it was Dim, which made the food coma kick in faster lol but I think I can manage next time.",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,1,0,4,TeH42Mg2nlbq8qwhyJuTzQ

This TRUE Chinese food with real Chinese Chefs. What you get is pure healthy eating. The price is right and yes you get what you paid for.

Like good Yelpers, my husband and I yelped this place up while on vacation in Vegas.  I have to admit that I was skeptical.  The hotel, Lucky Dragon, seemed extremely underwhelming and lackluster.  We found the restaurant upstairs with the help of an employee.  The interior was nicely decorated and serene.  Every dish we ordered exceeded our expectations by far!  We had the crispy pan fried seafood noodles.  That was done just right - not too oily or salty.  It's rare to find that dish done so perfectly.  Panfried noodles are usually too oily or too salty in my opinion.  We also ordered a seafood dish and a claypot.  Both were nothing short of perfection.  I don't usually give raving reviews about Chinese food just because my expectations are high.  This place was exceptional.  Since I've only been here once, I can't speak for the consistency of the food tasting great.  But all I know is that we were blown away by that one dinner we enjoyed here.  The staff showed great hospitality from the start.  I'd highly recommend this place!",v1um_EicLz4lZIx-HVnpow,6,2,5,X6e9ODsYVaNqf2aLrd_1jQ

Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. 
Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for.",M3M_eeEPImYRbcmdIWkLxA,2,0,3,s-qGZ-G8os99se3Ok0Nxxg
