344004,2017-08-06,0,-N_agk8RUHvHk3GVDsyunQ,"I really wanted to love this place after reading the great reviews, but I think maybe the employees are writing most of them. To start with, we waited over an hour for our appetizer (which was served the same time as our entrees). The bbq chicken wings were so overcooked and dry that it was tough to tell where the meat ended and bone began.  Now, let's talk about the steak, which I ordered medium rare. It was brought out well done. The waitress replaced it with another steak that was raw, literally cold inside. I kept asking my husband if this was a joke. At this point, I didn't want a meal there because I felt the cook was being facetious, and didn't want to run the risk of having something purposely horrific done to my food. The waitress took the steak off my tab, but lesson learned. I won't return. The long wait (while seated) and the awful food don't deserve my hard earned money. Looks like I'm back to looking for a good local steakhouse. 
Oh, and they were out of several items on their menu by 7pm. Including dinner rolls, which we weren't told about until we asked. There was no attempt to replace them with anything. And  they had the audacity to slap butter on our plates. With no bread.",II_SDAGzRtO_fkkAl4cO3w,0,0,1,yn6hY_LHEFdE3x6P90FqZQ

And then she counted them again.

We sat for about 15 minutes before we saw a waitress and she delivered some food to another table, then gave another table their check then left the room again. We looked at each other and decided to leave.  As we got up, she came into the room with two menus.  I was concerned about the service so asked how long it would take to get our food once we ordered and she said 10 min.  Then I asked how long before we would be placing our order.  I guess the menus were for us.  So, we decided to sit back down.  We read the menus and ordered pretty quickly and yes, the food came pretty fast.

We ordered the 12 oz rib eye.  It was really really good and done just the way we asked.  Both my husband and I were happy we stayed and we would go again.  We are just visiting Vegas but when we come here we try to stay at Nellis AFB  and it is just a couple miles from the gate.

We noticed most of the patrons that ordered salad got them with the meal.  We asked that we get ours prior and she complied.  Turns out she not only had the dining room but also a patio.  It's kind of hard to be in two places at once and give good service to everyone.

When you first walk in, you walk into a bar but the bar tender told us to go around the corner to the dining room.  The bar is noisier but there is an electronic door that closes off the dining room and keeps it quiet.  There were 2 TVs in there, one showing a soccer game and the other the golf tournament.

1588542,2016-10-25,0,-N_agk8RUHvHk3GVDsyunQ,"HITCHING POST SALOON & STEAKHOUSE, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

October 2016.  Overall rating FIVE STAR!

The Hitching Post Saloon and Steakhouse is a little dive, hole-in-the-wall restaurant tucked neatly in the back of a small bar located at 3650 North Las Vegas Blvd, in Las Vegas, NV.  It's right on the boundaries of the far northeast side of North Las Vegas near Lamb Blvd.  The restaurant has a small, easily handicap accessible room in the back with about ten tables, separate from the bar.  Actually the bar area is a bit larger than the restaurant, but don't let that discourage you.  Dives or hole-in-the-walls tend to be some real diamonds, and this one certainly is.

When you approach the restaurant under a large RV sign, located on a deserted strip of Las Vegas Blvd., you wonder where the restaurant might be.  The entrance is located on the east side of the building although parking is mostly on the north side.  There is a fairly long entrance into the building, but once inside, everything is cozy and close.  The bar fills the first room, and the restaurant is to the right through sliding electronic glass doors.  They have big screen TVs throughout and the bathroom was very nice.  The bathroom was clean and exhibited a beautiful large rock sink.  There is more restaurant seating outside in the back, which also has big screen TVs and a water-cooled fan system.  The inside seating area was pretty small, only about ten tables, and it was pretty dark inside, but many Las Vegan's prefer that to the bright, hot desert sun.  Another delight - it was almost chilly inside.  Beat that heat!

We visited twice in two weeks.  We were there for the lunch hour both times.  The first time we sat inside.  The waitress/bartender was very friendly, prompt and  nice.  The three of us ordered the following:  Chicken Caesar Wrap ($7.95), BLT ($6.95), Dip Sandwich ($6.95), and two appetizers, mushrooms ($5.95) and zucchini sticks ($5.95).  We ordered two appetizers because this type of appetizer for this price is usually about 6-8 pieces.  We were delightfully surprised when both appetizers were a fairly large basket of about 15-20 pieces.  One of the appetizers would have been enough for all us.  These are the standard frozen then deep fried (higher quality like Schwann's) appetizers, and they were cooked perfectly and served with ranch dip.  Seriously, I could have made a meal out of one appetizer plate.  When our orders arrived, again, we were pleasantly surprised.  The dip for the dip sandwich is the best I've ever had.  All the sandwiches came with a side of fries, slaw or vegetables.  The BLT was loaded with bacon, instead of the usual measly two pieces criss-crossed and loaded with a ton of lettuce to cover up the lack of bacon.  The chicken wrap was so large, our friend only ate half of it and took the rest home.  The second time we sat in the outside and the weather was just perfect.  We ordered a 1/2-Pound Burger ($8.25) and Dip Sandwich.  Both were very good.

On the first visit, the total bill was $34 for three people with leftovers boxed for take home.

AMBIANCE:  4 out of five stars

PRICING:  5 out of 5 stars.

1609434,2015-04-10,3,-N_agk8RUHvHk3GVDsyunQ,"Vegas is known for cheap food and smoky casinos and this Roadhouse diner kinda falls into this category. I only gave it a 4* rating because of the later part of the smoky part. 

We had a lay over in Vegas on our way to Utah on vacation and the Hitching Post is also a motel RV park, so we lucked out they had a diner attached. 

As I said when you walk in you immediately are blasted with smoke since you have to go through the bar to get to a room that is glassed off and a sensor you wave your hand in front of to open the sliding doors. The waitress asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or the dining room. We opted for the somewhat smokeless dining room. Wish we would of sat outside it would of been warmer. 

We were promptly given menus and our drink order taken. No Dr. Pepper was not a plus for me. So I opted for coke that still tasted like coke from the gun in a bar. Otherwise there was a pretty nice menu to choose from. Usual diner options. Burgers, sandwiches, salads and steaks. 

I chose the grilled cheese with 3 types of cheese. Pepper jack, cheddar and Swiss on rye bread with sweet potato fries. My husband selected the chef salad with ranch dressing. Funny but our companions had exactly what we had. 

The sandwich was perfectly toasted, not greasy. Fries were crispy and very good. The salads were full of ingredients and the boys really liked them. The only complaint I heard was they didn't get any hard boiled egg on the salad as it said on the menu. 

This place really did deliver a great meal at a great price and to our pleasant surprise our server asked if anyone in our party was military which there was and that just doesn't happen. Kudos to them for the discount for our servicemen.",jPdXvWEyMQPlF0njXwh88A,3,0,4,-aAuLWx6_IllvoL77muIzA

2177507,2015-01-20,1,-N_agk8RUHvHk3GVDsyunQ,"A few weeks ago I was out in North Las Vegas at Three Square volunteering for the evening. When I was finished I was starving and really felt the need for a steak so I hopped on Yelp to see what was close by. Quickly Hitchin Post was returned and the reviews looked relatively promising. I don't mind dives and have had some of the best food in my life at them, so I hoped for the best and headed over. 

When I got there I mused at the awesome location right next to a rv motel. After a minute I figure out where the door was and headed in where I was greeted with a harsh cigarette smell, old dark bar, and a smattering of very ""colorful"" characters. The bartender, who I have to say was super friendly and very attentive, came over where I ordered a glass of Cabernet. I didn't bother asking if they had different brands or even anything other than Cab. By the looks of this place I knew better than to be that stupid. 

After quickly looking through the menu, and realizing that a paleo dinner was going to be a stretch, I order the NY Strip with steamed-ish vegetables and a salad. I asked for just balsamic or red wine vinegar but there was none to be had so I settled for a balsamic vinaigrette on the side knowing it would be one of those Sysco brand kinds that was laden with sugar and other questionable ingredients but I wasn't going to be deterred from hoping that I was at least going to get a spot on steak.

My meal came fairly quickly and I hungrily dug in to what was at best an ok steak. It wasn't bad but the only reason I remember it was because of the sketchy surroundings and listening to a well educated, classy fellow (I hope you hear the sarcasm) loudly question why we (Americans, I presumed) even cared if people in France got bombed. This was the day after the Charlie Hebdo incident. I guess FauxNews, which was on half the televisions, wasn't making a case for caring about other human beings or free speech.

All in all my meal was passable but pretty underwhelming. I at least got to watch a woman order her cocktail to go, to which, the bartender pulled out a sleeve of McDonald's cups, poured in the cocktail, and handed it across to the patron. Wow, I didn't know people DID things like that. It was surreal.

Would I ever go back? Not unless I was in the area and much more desperate. Would I recommend the place? Doubtful. Why didn't I give it 1 Star? Well the steak was HORRIBLE and I was fairly amused by the people. Plus, the bartender was fantastic so I can't totally knock the place.",tL4NRC4uraCxjF8ZQ6GTTw,3,0,2,yfVgDiPfPy49HL5W0XU2VQ

The bar was packed watching hockey so the patio was virtually empty.  I loved the groove - dive bar locals only kind of place.  Clean, friendly -  shaded parking too!  

Our waitress was new - and the service was not fast - but we weren't in a hurry so not a big deal.  Our Long Island's were alright.  Daughter ordered chicken strips - she said they were fine.  Pulled Pork sandwich was good.  Hubby and I ordered the New York strip steaks as we were not super hungry.  Both of us felt a bit let down as other review rave about the perfectly cooked steaks - his med rare was medium and my medium had no pink at all I would classify as well done.  Mash potatoes were not from a box so bonus points there.  Veggies looked shriveled as they were overcooked too.  I felt like we were one of the last people they served dinner to and we got the left overs from the day on those veggies.

The bar was dark with a few slots and seemed like a cool place.  The dining room, once we got through the sensor, was nice enough.  Clean, very quiet, and comfy with two large-screen tvs and nice cloth napkins.  Enough on the aesthetics.  

My wife and I ordered the filet mignons with salads and baked potatoes.  They steaks were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful flavor and were very tender.  The baked potatoes were rolled in a salt/pepper mix and were great.  The salad was a basic variety dish.  We were extremely pleased with the service, food, price, and atmosphere.  It was really a neat experience.  The only suggestion I would make to them would be to have better servings of butter.  They were way too small and many had to be used. 

But wait, there's more!   We went back the next morning for breakfast.  We had the French toast and bacon.  Again, the French toast was fantastic and the bacon was to die for.  Couldn't have been more pleased.

At first glance this place  reminds me of the movie road house.  From the outside it looks like a real shit kicker kinda bar but nothing could be further from the truth. 

They have about ten different beers on tap and a decent food menu.  Food can be served in the dining room or at the bar. The hitchin post bills its self as a saloon and a steakhouse and that just about sums it up. They can serve up a great steak some damn near as big as the plate it's served on. They have daily specials for breakfast,  lunch and dinner and i haven't had a bad meal here yet.They also have a patio area with televisions and heat lamps/fans depending on weather.  Also they have a great bar staff so tip them well. Especially George and Tammy they kick ass.

We were then instructed to go thru the double glass door for the dining room. Somewhat of a small room with wood panel walls, basic table and chairs... a 70's country sorta vibe. We have walked back in time... back to when my parents took me to the local steakhouse back in SC about 45 years ago.
The 1 waitress was very nice. A little busy since she was by holding down the fort by herself but seemed to remain calm. 
We both had a salad, a steak, baked potato and dinner roll. Let me say this... we eat out a lot! This simple steak dinner is one that we will remember! The steak... seasoned, juicy and grilled to perfection. The potato... clearly, cooked the old fashioned way and rubbed with salt and butter on the outside... delicious. A simple little dinner roll prefect for sapping up all that fabulous steak juice. The salad was great with in house made croutons that I could eat by the bowl fulls. 
And did I mention how cheap it was?!?! Our whole meal for 2 with 2 beers and a soda was only $48.00.

The actual restaurant seating is behind the building, in a small patio area - this is also where the blues bands play that the restaurant sometimes has. There is a fair amount of seating - not a whole lot, but I have never seen every seat full either.

Mine , the Flatiron at 13.95 USED to be one of the best steaks in town under 20 bucks(there 19.95 steak was the other one), and now it is somewhat disgusting at any price (it used to have a delicate, tasty reduction sauce-now it is a tangy thick mushroom gravy-and too much of it). 
The salads are now part of the meal (a plus)-but the old side salads were great-now it is just a salad. 
We bumped into 2 of our friends there and we all agree that we are probably not going back. We live to far from it-better stuff in our neighborhood. It used to be worth the drive!
The menu does have a larger variety of items and a bunch more choices under $10 , so others should check it out if you are nearby. My wife's $23.95 steak was ok-not great.
