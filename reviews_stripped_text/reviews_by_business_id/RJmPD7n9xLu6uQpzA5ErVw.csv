645179,2017-04-10,1,RJmPD7n9xLu6uQpzA5ErVw,"OMG, where to start. Talk about incompetent - this place is the poster child. 
First I usually go to the one in North Las Vegas but was near this one. I usually only go in for breakfast and I always order the same thing and say it the same way, ""I'd like two croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and one sausage. A large drink. That's to go and that's all"". I had to repeat this to the cashier 3 times because obviously it was a difficult order (???). Then she points to a special on a coupon sheet and asked if that's what I wanted. I said, ""If it's for 2 croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and 1 sausage with a large drink that's to go, then that's what I want"". She couldn't figure out how to enter it in the computer system so called over someone else. The seconds person asked what I wanted and I repeated my order, verbatim as listed above. This 2nd person said I can't have the special with a fully loaded sandwich. I said, ""then don't give me a special, just give me what I ordered (and repeated it once again, verbatim). Then she said it'll cost more then the special if you want a fully loaded sandwich. Now being a little upset I once again said (with a little attitude most likely), ""I don't care what it costs I just want 2 croissant sandwiches - 1 fully loaded and 1 sausage. Plus a large drink. Make that to go and I don't want anything else. Finally she got it entered. The first girl then hands me a small cup. I said, ""I ordered a large drink"". She then hands me a medium cup and says, ""here, you can have a medium"".  Once again I said I ordered a large drink. Now get this. She says, ""I charged you for a small coffee"". Now I'm very irritated. ""Why would you charge me for a small coffee? I never said coffee, small or any size, in any of the 7 times I told you what I wanted"". She grabbed a large cup and slammed it on the counter and walked away. so I get attitudes because of their stupidity???  I get my order and leave. Driving down the road I reach into the bag and there's 3 sandwiches ????
There were 2 sausage croissant sandwiches and 1 sandwich of some type. It was on a hamburger bun, had 3 sausage patties and some cheese. I look at the receipt and it lists a croissant sandwich with 3 sausages, egg and cheese, plus 2 sausage croissant sandwiches, a hash brown  and a small coffee.   So, after 7 attempts to order not only did they not enter it right in the computer but they didn't even give me what they put on the receipt. The triple decker sausage monstrosity didn't have any egg even tho it was on the receipt and it was on a hamburger bun not a croissant as also listed on the receipt. Plus no hash browns in the bag which were on the receipt. Could 2 people get it any more screwed up?  I didn't order anything special or asked for any substitutions or anything extra... just what was on the menu and they couldn't do it. Plus 7 times I said it was to go and I didn't want anything else, but just before she took my money she asked me if it was for there or to go!!!!!!
Then when I replied AGAIN that it was to go and I didn't want anything else she asked me if I wanted anything else. Holly crap Batman - how can 2 people mess up something so simple so bad, plus give me an attitude on top of everything because THEY can't get it right.   
Ok Burger King. Read this and figure out what is wrong in this store. This happened on Saturday, April 8, 2017. Serious training needs to happen along with educating them on customer service skills and how to read a receipt. Keep in mind NOT ONCE did anyone apologize for all the screw ups. 
Yes, this is fast food but how friggin difficult is it to take a simple order? And how difficult is it to fill a bag with what is on the receipt, whether that's what I ordered or not - at least I would have given them credit for giving me the order that was on the receipt.

It also didn't hurt that for this promotional period, they would be offering 25c small coffees for a couple weeks (Note: at the time this review is being written, this deal has expired, so they are normal price). The new coffee was OK. It wasn't exceptionally strong as a DD, but it didn't taste like what you would get at a jiffy lube while you are waiting for your car to be serviced.

She then reached her arm in front of me in my car and pointed to the drink and said ""give me that"". I handed her the drink and she shoved the money at me and walked up to the trash can outside and threw the drink away and darted back in. I called the customer service number for this incident and I hope they do something about it",nnXljc4ENgJblSXgovNTiA,0,0,1,VfRW1GuDgQG58VjG3FzxOQ

I got to this location at 10:31 and was told that they had stopped serving breakfast at 10:30 am. There was nobody in line except for me and I had a screaming baby who was hungry and they would not serve me breakfast. Only lunch. So I left. I went to McDonald's. I was so upset that I called to talk to the manager and he was so unprofessional. He was the one who told me 11 but went back on his word and said no I told you 10:30. He never said I'm sorry or anything. Worst customer service ever. Not to mention they don't answer the phone at all. I called several times before anyone could answer. I even went as far as to call the corporate office but they don't answer either, nor did they even get back to me. Business establishments now a days are horrible. I will never eat at Burger King again in my life! Nobody cares anymore and these people who you have working have no understanding of what customer service is. Get it together. If I could give no stars I would.",L7DTirfABu6AxlOLvanQ2g,0,0,1,SMbTm065VsCoss_nF5I9Sw

Next time bozo, if you are going to tell someone to park because you are not fast enough, keep track of the model of the car! Everytime we come here, we have to go park in the parking lot.  When there are 3-4 cars waiting, she doesn't know which one is for her so she sat and wait...and you had to ball to yell at her?",s67-vzUEE2J4YCbqDQW6AQ,0,0,1,JOyeijSjaPHYIyUirjyoug
