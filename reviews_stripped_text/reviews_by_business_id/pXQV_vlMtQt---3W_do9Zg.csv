I went on a whim and ordered a chicken empanada and regret not ordering the dozen, I was making ""yumm"" sounds and all. As a finale the Tiramisu was the best to date.

I finally got an answer and was told it was on the way and I could expect it in 10 -15 minutes. The driver was finally able to make it and I have to say employees like himself are the reason that places stay in business. Food was hot , delicious and fresh. The driver was sincerely apologetic and apparently the restaurant had a driver walk out on them. After a short conversation, the driver I spoke to completely changed my negative impression of my first time experience with this restaurant. Employees like him should be commended.

Eggplant parm app, $9, 4 slices of breaded eggplant with a sprinkle of cheese and a cup of marinara to sauce yourself to the preferred level. Forgettable. 

Empanadas; $2.10 each, don't ask me why an Italian joint has empanadas on the menu, just know that they're really good. The spinach initially caught my eye but the beef was way better- even taking into account that the cheese inside wasn't even melted. Whoops.

Garlic knots; $5, oiled and seasoned well but somehow a bit lackluster. Wonder if the dough is the same they use for pizza, seemed on the plain side. 

$20 takeout order was fine but I'd only return for the empanadas or to give their pizza a try. They offer gluten free and sicilian, I just don't typically shell out the prices they're asking for takeout pizza- price is more on par for specialty or high end shops.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,5,3,oGSBjcmtSWFGpDS7yqFuXg

As I was driving home I passed a car with the license plate ""Maru"" which reminded me of the YouTube celebrity kitty from Japan.  Then once home I began searching yelp trying to find my perfect Pasta fix. When I stumbled upon Maru's I thought it was a funny coincidence but the reviews of fresh pasta got me hooked, plus they offered a check in special.  So with lightening speed I hurried on over there with my boyfriend. 

We were greeted immediately and the service was very attentive and friendly.  I changed my order after looking over the menu and it was handled with graciousness and charm. Finally decided on cannelloni stuffed with spinach and ricotta served with tomato sauce and my bf got the Quatro formaggio. Both were prepared fresh and tasted delicious.

2296234,2014-07-06,4,pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg,"Let's begin with this is a review for delivery, not dine in. 

Us fat girls at work (shout out to my  sweethearts, Amanda and Nichelle) decided to try a new place. We had the menu dropped off and couldn't stop drooling over the options. 

After picking over everything and deciding to share we ordered; chicken strips with fries, garlic bread, garlic knots, spinach salad, an extra order of fries and two chicken empanadas.

Pros;
-garlic knots were delicious. Smothered in garlic and herbs, dripping in olive oil.
- chicken strips were good not overly crunchy. Pretty nice sized.
- empanadas were very good. Loved whatever was in them. Full of flavor. 

Cons;
- Fries were soggy. No salt to them. 
- delivery took longer than expected. They said 30 minutes and it took them 40. Wouldn't have been such a big deal if it wouldn't have been for the meeting we were expecting to go to, so had limited time to eat.
- they forgot our ranch and marinara and so they had to drive it over
- ranch was not homemade. Tasted like hidden valley. I would know cause I hate the taste
- marinara was okay. Very watery. It was eatable. 

My boss ended up saving the spinach salad for herself at home. She said the next day it was tasty.

Overall for delivery I wouldn't come back. Next time I will go for dine in and try sandwiches, pasta and pizza.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,4,1,3,CcF-cpHqdVORsYlQ_7VIWA

3617024,2015-07-09,0,pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg,"I tried this place out on my sister's recommendation and came for just some bolognese. 

I'm not sure if it was just my perception but it seemed like the owners were a little snappy with one another. Perhaps, it was a long day. 

Observation: they are right next door to Laser Tag and walking in I could hear some obnoxious and illiterate conversations outside, in front of the place. I can imagine that Maru's gets a lot of young and/or disrespectful... OK, let's say ""trashy"" people in, being loud and annoying. I'm not saying that the laser tag crowd is all trashy, but just by observing the location, I can see that often, this is what would happen to be there... 

On to the food: the bolognese is Very decent. Not the greatest ever, but it totally does the job. The con for me is the meat. It is quite chewy. Perhaps an upgrade in quality of the meat will improve the taste and overall texture. It's $10 for this dish and I would not mind paying $13-15 if they upgraded the ingredients used. 

The dish comes with a salad. I did not eat it now (too full) but the vinaigrette was okay. It wasn't spectacular and maybe a little sour.. As if the balsamic used is mixed with white vinegar or if it is just.. Young/not good quality. But, edible and does the job of a free salad. 

The dish also comes with garlic bread. It is not really the typical, crispy and delicious garlicky bread. It's more of like a dry focaccia soaked in butter/garlic sauce. It's a bit soggy and missing that great garlic bread crunch. It is tasty, but not what I was expecting or looking forward to. 

Couple of suggestions: 
-Please do not staple bags so much -- Oh my gosh. 
-You do not need to put salad leaves in a container and then put it in a paper bag and staple it all around. 
-There is not need to use SO much foil to wrap up the dressing container. A simple piece of tape across the lid and onto the sides would have been enough. 


I feel that the paper bag and all that foil and extra plastic bag to put all this stuff in is such a waste and it could save the establishment significant money (and to the customers, the waste) if this step were to be avoided. It's completely excessive. 

Nice place. I'll come back and try some other stuff. I saw a big dough mixer and I'm hoping that they are putting it to excellent use.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,1,0,3,7TB_1mqJ8APeLzLhpTV0-g

I waited for the pizza to be baked and then I brought it home.  The pizza was good and large enough that it provided 1 1/2 meals.  They gave me a small bag with lots of napkins and extra cheese and three packets of crushed red pepper.  That's a nice touch.

I was pleased with the pizza but I'm not sure the value is there.  $20 for a half Sicilian?  And, it's an extra drive for me to go here.

The delivery man even came with a smile and took the alternative route as to not bother us even though there was a shorter route to take. He made sure the first time we saw him, he'd have the order in hand instead of having us get up to open the homeowner's gate. That alone earned an extra on the tip!

So it's 9pm, I'm working a night shift at the office and I was painfully hungry. Unfortunately for me I had a super craving for spaghetti & meatballs. Nothing else sounded appetizing at all.
This place didn't even come up on my Yelp at first, so I had tried to order from another place, 20 minutes go by & I'm getting excited for my food, when instead I receive a phone call telling me that their driver went home for the night. Seriously? Why did you accept the order & charge me then? It was frustrating, but whatever, I start searching again & now I'm getting frantic because it seems like all of the places who have pasta are now closed... I find this place & call immediately. Didn't even stop to look for a menu. 
Super nice gentleman takes my order, tells me it will be here in about 25 minutes. Fantastic! That's half of the time that the other place said. 
The guy who delivered was even early (THANK YOU, sooo hungry!) Got my foodies all nice & hot. Totally hit the spot. Meatballs were huge & super juicy. Pasta was amazing. And of course, garlic bread! Mmmm! Everything just tasted fresh, so yums!
 I seriously only got through half of it, there was so much food. Pretty much got two meals out of it. The price was really good for the amount and quality of the food that I got.

We came here after a few games of laser tag next door. My friends were all super amped up from the hour of laser tag, so we were being a bit silly, but I'm sure they are used to questionable late night customers. 

We only ordered two slices for our friend (most of us had eaten earlier). I put a tip in their jar. Pizza was good! Nothing special, but nice and hot. 

One of my friends made the mistake of putting his hands behind him on one of the tables and the granite top flipped off and hit the floor, coming undone from the base. Most of the tables in here were already really shaky, including the one we were sitting at, so I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again, or if it's happened before.

The owner demanded he pay for it on the spot. We thought he was joking...he was not.

He was immediately on the phone with someone about the repair cost. He was speaking Spanish, so we couldn't understand him. My friend paid the owner in full: $75!!! I felt that the owner was really rude about what was a small accident. He didn't even thank us for owning up to a mistake, which may not even have been our fault. 

I highly doubt another customer would've been so quick to pay for an accident without an official estimate on the repair, but we are nice people.  

I will never go back here.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,8,0,2,NXQy3KzCINibluKlo6y7Sw

4545123,2015-03-18,0,pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg,"Update.  2 1/2 hours later, I heard knock knock.  Who is there?  Maru's!  The owner saw the review and sent another pizza.  

This time it was as I remembered.  I'm happy to find out that it was just one time thing.  As the delivery person said, the last one must have had too much veggies=soggy pizza.  

Now my question marks have disappeared, it's time for their tiramisu!

I wanted to thank the owner taking a review seriously.  I never expected another pizza.  

Previous review:
It's so sad.  I loved it when they first opened.  Pizza was delivered in great condition last time I ordered.  Hot and not soggy.  Now I don't know what happened.  It was delivered within 30 minutes.  The store is about 10 minutes away.  The crust was baked nicely but it was not hot.  The half of the pizza was inedible. Has it been previously frozen?  I don't know.  The meatball pieces were also mushy.  It was just so awful.  The whole time we picked at the edible part of pizza, question marks just went through my head.  Imagine soaking a pizza slice into water....ugh.    

I know I should eat it at the store first before judging on their pizza but it was too disappointing for me to even think of trying it again.  I also ordered tiramisu.  I have no desire to try that either with my nausea at this point.  Really.  I would never said no to sweets unless I lose complete trust in the food.

That being said, the service was very good.  I really liked the gentleman who took my order as well as the one who delivered.  Hence, two stars for service.  Someday I will try it at the restaurant....someday.",5a_eQcyqpO2HvWY6Y6krvA,1,1,5,xCiRIBMakuf6yNOp8IKAVw
4628200,2014-07-02,1,pXQV_vlMtQt---3W_do9Zg,"First of all, I would like to apologize to the delivery guy for my little chihuahua jumping all over him. Second of all, sorry I didn't have any bills to tip you and had to tip you with a bunch of quarters. Anyway, I'll be a lot more prepared next time, if you will be so kind as to come back and deliver for me. Maybe I'll pick up the food from now on. 

Oh, on to the food. Their chicken Alfredo pizza is so delicious. If it were a person and I were single, I would ask it out. Their ingredients taste so fresh and the dough, OMG that dough seems like it made it up to heaven when they were tossing it around. I have never been to Italy, but if this is what real Italian pizza resembles, I'm booking a trip there next year. 

I also had the pasta carbonara, which was a little salty for my taste. Otherwise, all the flavors were there.

The only negative thing is I was only able to eat one slice of pizza, because I was too full after that and some pasta. Haha Well, that's not really negative, is it?",tXoJxIcIGlEPmcSs_v-Oog,0,0,5,5gxDj2eWaAAMf1haaGMsJw

We ordered the stuffed pizza and wings. The stuffed pizza originally comes with sausage, pepperoni and ham. We substituted bacon for ham added meatball and added ricotta and bleu cheese. The cheese was so delicious and rich made for a great slice of pie. All the meat in that was stuffed made it like a meat lovers calzone. The bacon was authentic and tasted right, the meatball were fresh and the crust was crispy  and filled with cheese.  Would highly recommend their stuffed pizza!",476M6hw7HsgunJ9mPG8_jw,1,0,5,Yn3A1-nifrNHQ-C51_tcGQ

I had the Pollo Florentine where the vegetables were cooked to perfection . The vegetable soup also had freshly cut veggies in it and was seasoned perfectly. They have fresh bread and the desserts are amazing. I had the flan which is served with dulce du leche and my husband had the tiramisu. I liked it so much that I drove across town the next night to try it again. I even got a piece of tiramisu for the husband since he couldn't be there. He playfully called me a devil woman for going without him again...lol.

I never understand  a restaurant that doesn't get how a restaurant needs to fulfill multiple items or why be in business? If you want done in customers, cater to dine in customers. Have a real coke soda fountain... Try a freestyle. Use real restaurant commercial napkins, utensils and cups. Don't try to be frugal with the small stuff especially while charging premium prices.

I have since been back a couple more times and have tried the rigatoni ala bolognese with italian sausage, meat lasagna, fettucini alfredo & flan with dulce de leche. Everything has been amazing. They make all their pasta, breads & pizza dough in house from scratch as well as everything else. Spiced just right, creamy goodness. The staff are very nice. I have recommended this to friends and none have been disappointed. For the people who complain about soggy french fries & chicken strips from delivery, what did you expect? French fries are always soggy upon delivery unless they are from a fast food restaurant. Next time, do yourself a favor and order italian food, from the italian restaurant you called...leave the chicken & fries for Cane's...this place is amazing!",lB_dUD37SnJnkHs5UB7yvQ,2,1,5,33F9PsO6dh1XvxmIakNl8w
