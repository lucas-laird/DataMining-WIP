321481,2010-08-10,2,oLbHJ_qJh78Kw4fhUw1HGg,"We drove to a remote part of Las Vegas because we had a coupon for Buy One Entree, Get One Free -- this coupon was from the Entertainment Book, sold annually, with hundreds of participating restaurants and other businesses offering great discounts. 

When we finally arrived at the restaurant, we were starving -- we hadn't realized how far away this place was.  We entered this hole-in-the wall Chinese place -- at first, it seems just like a ""fast-food"" style order at the counter restaurant, but they had several tables available, and we were told to take a seat if we were dining in.  We were promptly greeted by a young woman, who told us that the coupon we had wasn't going to work, as they didn't have a contract with the Entertainment Book people --- we had just driven half an hour to try this place out, and they weren't going to honor our coupon!  Bleh!  They did offer a 10% discount, however, so we decided to stay, as we were really hungry.  How disappointing, however, for them not to honor a valid coupon with their name on it, that hadn't expired.  Poor business practice!

On the plus side, they had good prices, good portion sizes -- however they offered table service, yet served everything on styrofoam plates. I don't mind eating off of styrofoam, but if you're going to offer table service, go to the dollar store and buy some cheap real plates to serve your customers on!!!  

The food would get a 3.75 stars, but their customer service (in not accepting the coupon) rates them a 1 star -- we would never go back to a business that does something like this, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody else either.",o0EB72yhhmmWWytZsyKnUg,2,2,2,pav4RulfsyZrUQ2-zQXolg

I placed my order and I guess it have me an eta of 10 minutes which was okay with me since I'm already turning up in my pajamas on this Friday night. When I got there which took me all of 5 minutes my order was just placed in the bag waiting for me. I ordered house low mein & house fried rice. Well I must have forgotten the portions are for a family of 4 and it's just me but it will eventually all get eaten. 

Well guess it was pretty good but I've had better in L.A. but it was greasy like I sometimes like it sho it did was it was supposed to do which was fill my belly. But at least it not sitting around under a heating lamp cuz they actually make the food fresh to go.

Service was okay but 1 thing all chinese take out need to learn.......STOP BEING SO STINGY WITH THE SOY SAUCE PACKETS!!!! All this rice I have and guess how many packets they gave me to go with my food??? Only 3!!!! But I always keep soy sauce in the house anyway for whenever I cook.

They have a ton to choose from on the menu, they are prompt with their attentions to the customer and all the employees are very nice. We ordered our food, and although it was a little bit of a wait (i'd rather have quality food than fast food) it was well worth it. Most chinese places charge the same for al la carte, but our meals (we ordered the half portion) came with rice. We ordered the monogolian beef (spicy and spectacular), cashew shrimp, and chicken lo mein. The prices arent that high at all for what you get as portions were bigger than we expected and we have leftovers for today. Everything was flavored just right and they include calories per serving on the menu for those who want to be healthy. The inside is not all dressed up, they only have a few tables, so I wouldnt go in expecting a five star resturaunt in San Fransico's China Town, but I would say if you like authentic Chinese food you should check this place out.",NPpO42lq0EL8qfUUVQgbWA,2,0,5,_AvMtaOzWkmI6T0dJTvtYw

Little to say no dinner for the adults since the kids ate first (as they always should). Maybe they will eat the Sweet and Sour tonight.

There was never a bad time that I had with a Chinese restaurant until the night I came to Mandarin ""Healthy Chinese"" Express. My family including my grandpa and my incestuous cousin (no joke) who planned this evening and chose this place only to feel like an upscale Mr. Chow's, it's small but decent. Now for the bad part, because of the large party they gave some of us the to-go menus including myself. Now if your dining in a restaurant you know this isn't the way to do things, bummer. 

When the drinks came to our table, the waitress (cunt) forgot my diet coke and I had to ask her ignorant-ass several times for my drink. It took 10 minutes in which was a shame and I could of got it myself, fuckin' hell.
Now that killed 80% of my appetite and it pissed me off to no fuckin' end. We had a nice set of entrees including lemon chicken, walnut prawns, fried and steamed rice, kung-pao combo, and chow-mein. For the latter dish, my family forgot to give me the goddamn thing and after asking them several times and I've suddenly lost my appetite because of the eccentricities of my family and the fuckin' morons who run this place. All the food came in paper plates and the serving arrangements could've been done at home. I want to give this place a fair rating but when this guy's appetite is ruined by everything thrown at him, rest assured all bet are off. The food isn't healthy at all and there is a whole lot of MSG so I thought fair warning. If you crave Chinese/Mandarin food and you don't want anyone killing you appetite, do yourself a favor and skip it at all costs.

The kung pao chicken was a huge disappointment in that it was mostly CELERY. I'm not kidding you it was atleast 60% celery, and was not spicy at all. 
The ginger onion beef was a little bit better but not by much. It had more green onion and strips of ginger than there was beef. 
The fried rice was very greasy and did not have much flavor. It did not taste fresh.

4654756,2017-10-06,0,oLbHJ_qJh78Kw4fhUw1HGg,I get food delivered from Mandarin Express every couple of months or so.  Typically the same order of Pad Thai with an assorted appetizer (sometimes an additional entree).  Delivery is usually 30-40 minutes and the food is always tasty and hot.  I have picked up food from the location before and usually don't see many people eating in the restaurant.  It seems most of their business is take out/delivery.  They are a good option for quick Chinese food at reasonable prices.,EBwnCF8YG4LlY4BhngrpcQ,0,0,4,8jzTgmvYV7gJ1D95EPWyyA
4711691,2009-01-23,4,oLbHJ_qJh78Kw4fhUw1HGg,"This is one of the true Chinese tasting foods out here and best yet they deliver.  The place isn't that big, a typical small place with a few tables surrounding a small kitchen. The staff one could see are the waitress who is kind of cute, the older cook and the last guy who does everything from cooking to delivery. 

Other than the cute waitress the younger guy is also kind of cute. He hides these amazing eyes behind those glasses. He is kind of short, but packs a lot of masculinity in there.",BOU25_BWQnLdFJBKUe2XdQ,2,1,5,EuRbBR0wMNhUGW49aPVKaw

The food was disgusting.  I love sweet n sour chicken with sauce on the side but this was gross.  The orange chicken was bad too and the rice tasted burnt.

Never again!!!!",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,3,0,1,xbKDtUsN_qGIwtEh33YCYQ

Hubby got the combo kung pao and it tasted like garbage, and the meats were overcooked.

I recieved the same service with no smile along with food being questionable. In all the years I've learned how to cut vegetables, you learn that...You have to cut the parts that are no good. My broccoli was half yellow and when I asked the Chinese lady she said it was because vegetables lose their color when cooking.

The more I eat out at places like this i realize, I need to start cooking my own food.",nY9FUScv1oLEo-XNjOcr4g,0,0,2,wL5zAkPdX3Geh1zngqNj-A

I am glad we did because the service, delivery and food was Outstanding! 

We ordered crab rangoons, war won ton soup, honey walnut shrimp, orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and house special chicken.

The food was very hot and fresh upon delivery which was Fantastic, they don't mess around with delivery. lol

I did not find this out until I got it home. Yuck!!!!! Yuck!!!! Yuck!!!
Who wants to eat raw flour and corn starch because some basic cook does not cook it long enough in the wok?
Then after going over and over again to the next door Albertson's, they then had a banner out front about their food on sale.
No wonder!!!! 
Apparently, other people felt the same.
