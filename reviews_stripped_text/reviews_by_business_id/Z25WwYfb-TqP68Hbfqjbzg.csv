Perfect portion for you to get full. A good place to grab some good Korean dishes for lunch or dinner after work. Try their noodles with black beans sauce... Spicy or not. Both are good!",gJFC6DaM5guitce6FSFYxw,1,1,5,3W95USdiUmj_BINk1F9C0Q
4174322,2018-04-08,15,Z25WwYfb-TqP68Hbfqjbzg,"This is a fairly new fast food-like joint located inside a tiny food court with just a few other Asian eateries. I was having a hankering for jajangmyeon, which I absolutely love, so what better place while in Las Vegas than Korea Town Plaza, right? Well, maybe, but not so much Hong Lou.

I tried the combination special of half jajangmyeon and half spicy seafood soup noodles. I have no idea whether the noodles are actually made on the premises or not, but they claim to make it there when I inquired into this. The noodles were very uniformed in size, so it was probably machine made, if it was made on site. 

The half of the spicy seafood soup noodles were ok, with a good amount of seafood, given that it was only 50 percent of the whole ""bowl"".  In addition, I found the seafood soup quite flavorful, and perfectly mildly spicy.

The other half of the jajangmyeon, however, was another story. Firstly, I reiterated my request to the cashier that I wanted the black bean sauce served separately, on the side. She readily agreed, and when I got it, lo and behold, the sauce was served on top of the noodles. Unfortunately, I didn't care for their flavorless sauce at all, and now a bunch of it was smothered all over the noodles.  Bad, all the way around.

I come occasionally to the Korean supermarket, Greenland, which this food court is attached to, but won't be stopping by Hong Lou again. Just so many many other Korean restaurants all over Las Vegas to pay for sub par food, even at food court prices.",LNEXz0drBNtLHwrb1G-VPA,24,18,2,kgSV26812JVaOPFee2KoOw

Items tried and liked so far: 
Jajangmyun (Noodle with Black Bean Sauce)
Champong (Spicy Seafood Noodle)
Fried Mandu (Fried Dumplings)

Food is fresh & delicious. Service is quick & friendly. A new favorite for my daughter and I.",jp1cDthqcWX62NtL1oAKlQ,5,6,5,bq2l6M-kgFOGscI-LusecA

They've just opened this restaurant but it waz a good experience here.

Combo: spicy seafood noodle & black bean noodles: 4 stars
Flavorful & tons of noodles. There's not many korean restaurants in OC & LA that have this dish / make this dish very well so we were pleasantly pleased with this place.

Tables where you sit down & eat are clean & simple.",yLW8OrR8Ns4X1oXJmkKYgg,10,12,4,GF3RaJJqN_GLIIrn_cqQHA

This time, I tried the gan jajang which is a more dried sauce and it is my absolute favorite thing. Even had the left over sauce with some rice when I got home. My Chinese/Korean parents really enjoyed their champong (spicy seafood soup)! They had a nice amount of seafood in it and shrimp, mussels, etc. We were extremely pleased with the pricing and portions! The sweet and sour pork (tangsuguk) and they put the sauce on the side (which I like) but I felt that the sauce isn't just right yet. Still very good but there is a flavor I am not used to but the meat was fried perfectly! 

The people were sweet and so attentive! And the service is pretty quick! 

Will be back soon and for take out too!!!",RnTfhTi7VVEAMzlBXKvDsw,5,3,5,yKXlNviYnQbHU3Bjv3bqTw

5058947,2018-04-05,0,Z25WwYfb-TqP68Hbfqjbzg,Restaurant quality in a food court!  The fried chicken and chambong was as good as any I've had in Korea. Really enjoyed the flavor and the quality of the seafood was noticeable.  My son ordered the jajangmyun and he really liked it as well. (His mom is a Korean chef so he's kind of picky when it comes to food).  The only area for improvement:  the kimchi left a lot to be desired and was noticeably second rate.  (Sorry!  Just being honest! Good kimchi is important!). Other than the kimchi everything was great though. Glad we stopped here during our Vegas trip!  Best of luck to the owners. Hope they are wildly successful!,mbKOXo3fWUwKx6wKObyH9w,0,0,5,lIIIaI9TAm1PC_WAtJHCwQ
5349179,2018-06-04,0,Z25WwYfb-TqP68Hbfqjbzg,"After debating to have pho for dinner or burgers for dinner, I decided that we should not do either and go straight for some jjajangmyeon. Came here with my husband and my brother after reading about Hong Lou on Yelp. I've been craving some jjajangmyeon from my favorite restaurant but it's in LA so ... I just need to find a Vegas alternative! 

This is located in the Greenland food court right next to Tofu House towards the back. 

We ordered one of their combos with jjajangmyeon (black bean sauce with noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour pork), an order of their spicy jjajangmeyon in extra spicy, and a green onion pancake. 

I was so surprised that they have spicy jjajangmeyon! Most places don't have it. It was a huge portion too! And it was really tasty. They used peppers to make it spicy and it wasn't too spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice where it gave it good flavor but it won't leave your mouth burning. 

Their regular jjajangmyeon, however, was a bit on the bland side. It lacked flavor. The green onion pancake was good but it was a bit on the doughy side so it was thicker. Their tangsuyuk was delicious! It was fresh and crispy. I like how they always serve it with the sauce on the side so I could just dip the pork in and that keeps their crispy texture when you eat. Granted, you can always pour the sauce on top if that is your thing. 

I am DEFINITELY coming back for their spicy jjajangmyeon and their tangsuyuk. I also want to come back to try their jjamppong.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,1,1,4,rluZ12hlLNEvXp75EPcdQw
