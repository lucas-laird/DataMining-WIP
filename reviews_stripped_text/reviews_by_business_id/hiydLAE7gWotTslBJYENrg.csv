 The curry was good but tasted like the one from the box at the grocery store.  The fried rice was mushy and tasteless.  The croquet and corn beef hash was good.  Spam katsu tasted burnt and was brown....looked old...everything on the plate was brown....even though I ordered extra curry it was still kinda little bit.  Felt like they just gave you enough to cover the plate.  And you pay .50 for spice, which is kinda weird.",7g9IDqWCpd3UACkYy6Mmog,2,0,2,4GRVqDnhXZF4MqejgCXoIQ
580485,2013-09-11,0,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"I was informed that it's not similar to Coco ichibanya: Curry House back home in hawaii, but I still held on a little bit hoping it was close. after getting my food, it wasn't disappointing (it was REALLY good) but it reminded me of Daichi Ramen's curry.

Portions were alright and the service was good, she checked up pretty often and took care of us well.

Only thing was the wait time, we had a party of 14 and they had 3 or 4 people working in the kitchen. I know what it's like to work in the food industry and it can be somewhat frustrating to have such a sudden rush come in, so that's why I was pretty lenient with waiting.

Main verdict, I would definitely come here again. First impressions were good and the food was good as well, looking forward to filling out my stamp card!",xEpKFVZ2nKYddVWB9-EUvg,0,0,4,1BoN1K1-aOwKjkJ2_xkloQ
679716,2013-09-19,1,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"I would do 2.5 stars if I could make it that way. 

So lets start off with the good. Taste of the food? Pretty good. Very similar to most Japanese restaurant's curry. Whatever is fried stayed crispy. Nothing bad, but nothing extraordinary either. 

Service was good.

I felt like their prices were a little high considering their portion sizes. Everyone knows that everything in Hawaii is more expensive than the mainland. However, I could get the same curry plate that's double the portion, still for cheaper than kaba curry. Simple things like just adding a little more rice or more curry sauce would just ""make"" the plate look fuller and make customers feel like they're getting a great deal. Rice and sauce are the most inexpensive things in a restaurant so I don't feel like people need to be stingy with those. Just a little comparison: at ichiza their beef curry is around $8 (loaded with beef, vegetables, and rice) and I can never finish it all and always have some lunch for tmrw as well. Here...I paid the same price for basically just curry sauce, rice, and katsu and I cleaned the plate off and still felt hungry. 

The atmosphere here can get super awkward as well! I don't wanna offend ppl into that ""cosplay"" world but....I felt like this restaurant was a mini convention for that! Everyone in there were in bright colored wigs, dressed up like anime, or playing magic cards! It wasn't even Halloween! We were the only ""normal"" customers there. It was just awkward! And it seems like they're the friends of the owners too cuz they even go behind the counter freely. I felt like I was in another world and I just wanted to finish my food and leave. I mean, if you're into those kinda things or you don't mind that the place is packed with cosplay ppl then sure maybe you'll like the atmosphere. But it wasn't for me. 

I'll stick to ichiza. More food for the buck and I don't feel like I'm in another world there.",sVR6XQh9MZc2cpiZmK_lpg,0,0,3,R83wmmsg5JR0AIU9Xwef4A
746145,2014-05-22,0,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"I really like this location. The place is very spacious. There is music playing in the background, which has its own atmosphere. 

The food is really good, especially the udon, which i like to order a lot. I like the portion size because you will not feel guilty not leaving any behind. You can customize your order, so it will not be the same old thing you ordered in the past. The prices are reasonable since you can figure how much you want to spend. There are plenty of different drinks, plate combos, to desserts. 

It does take awhile to get the food to you, but having a group of friends with you will pass the time, then you notice you food being served. It is worth the trip!",JDk5siWzJkY_rOmBdjgAlQ,0,0,5,hy9xb0cFF0P91y2WPMFu0w

Tonkatsu: skimped portions

1315076,2014-09-26,1,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"I was having a craving for curry and had the need to fulfill it. I heard so much about this place that I decided to give it a try.

Thursday night and this place was not busy whatsoever. We were able to take a seat wherever we liked and received very fast service. Unfortunately some of the things on the menu were being discontinued and the prices of fountain drinks were being raised, but our server kindly informed us all of this. He didn't rush us at all while taking our order and was very patient with us - something I greatly appreciate when receiving customer service. 

As we were waiting for our food, we were able to play tic-tac-toe on the tabletops. I thought this was pretty cool and an innovative way to keep people busy as they wait for their food. The environment of this place is very casual and modern, and the atmosphere is very laid back. 

As for the food, it was very delicious. I've only tried a few Japanese curry houses in Vegas, but this is honestly the best one I've been too. The curry tastes yummy, and there is a wide selection of toppings and sides you can get with your curry. You can even choose a spice level if you want. They even have a few already made dishes if you're feeling a bit indecisive for that day. Everything is pretty affordable too, so I would recommend this place for those who don't want to spend too much money for a decent meal. I do feel like the portions could be a bit bigger though since I ran out of curry before finishing all of my rice. It's not the best Japanese curry I ever had, for it's a bit of a thinner consistency. But for Vegas, it's a spot I would recommend. Overall, I would definitely come back again.",xkn_-gZi2dxVavzEugLYmQ,3,2,4,vVe0pCYORTHhG3wpt-0qIQ
1380614,2014-02-27,1,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"Came here for the first time with some friends. Their first time too. Had a fried who loved this place a lot so decided to try it. 

Interior was painted yellow with bench seats along the wall and pull out chairs on the other side. pretty spacious. probably could fit a few more tables if they needed to.

Came here for dinner around 5:30. Pretty empty. We were the only table aside from one other guy, which i think was a DJ? 

Their menu is fairly simple. First row, you get your pick of either Rice + Curry, Cheese Fries + Curry, Fried Rice + Curry, and Curry Udon. Second row, you have a choice of spice level (if you want it spicy, regular is non-spicy) for a charge of 50 cents. Third section is the sides, which ranges from like chicken katsu, to sausages, etc for average 2-3 dollars per side (with no limit to how many sides you can get of course, as long as you are willing to pay XD). Fourth section is the toppings like corn, mushrooms, etc. Bottom section is the drinks. 

Simple and easy. Pick your selection as you go down the sections and you have your order. 

NOTE ! With Yelp check in - free side and topping ! Saves you like 3-4 bux if you get katsu and a side ! 

I had gotten the cheese fries + curry with chicken katsu and a fried egg (with the imagination of it being an over easy egg so if i broke it, the yummy gooey yolk will flow over the katsu and fries !!! ) 

When the order came, i was actually a little surprised on how small it was. I had no expectation on the size beforehand but i guess i was hoping it be larger because i was hungry XD ! Fries were nice and crispy. Curry itself, was nice. Not super seasoned like some other curries i have but it was ok (not too much of a fan of japanese curry). Was gonna add spicy to it but decided against it because i like to try the original flavor before any changes =P As i had said before, i had ordered an egg but the egg was a little too cooked compared to what i had hoped for. Was maybe ""over medium"" vs the over easy i wanted XD no ooey gooey goodness to go over my stuff =[ sad haha jk kinda =X lol the best thing, to my surprise was the chicken katsu. despite it being a $3 (if not free from yelp check in), you get 1 piece of chicken katsu. What had surprised me was how juicy and moist the chicken was. Props to the chef/owner on pulling that off !! 

Overall, not bad experience. Wished portions was bigger XD",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,3,3,KQSf2FC_b3D71SNE1Tg5Bw

Honestly, Curry Zen offers superior quality, but Kaba Curry is also decent to my Japanese taste buds.

My suggestion for them is to simplify the offerings - focus on the best menu items that you're proud of, then try to do it even better. Loco moco style curry is pretty good, but some toppings like tonkatsu was subpar. The inconsistency in the quality makes you look worse than you actually are.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,1,1,4,HKf1yFeL_KcjMm-j5i7HPA

Nothing life changing. 

I've tried to eat here four times.. and three of them, they were closed. (While store hours claim to be open) Apparently ran by younger people and the place closes early on a Saturday?! Isn't that the number one day you should be open late?! 

Anyways, you walk in and its kind of awkward, its a very wide open room.. such a waste of space! Granted that they aren't busy you could use that space for tables and what not. We sat down, placed our order, and here it comes! Man, it's really not that bad but I would absolutely prefer to eat at Curry Zen. The curry is watery and with the added cheese I'm not sure if I could even find it! I got the corn beef which was bomb! Curry Zen needs to get on that haha. Also had the korroke.. soooooo sad. It tasted like boxed taters with garlic powder nothing spectacular. It's ok, I can't say that I would go back as long as Zen stays open.

1939582,2013-08-12,2,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"So Kaba Curry shit its door and closed it's shutters over at the Campus Commons for the last time as the crew moved over to a new location. Much personal anticipation for their return due to withdraws and lo and behold the NEW Kaba Curry is open on Spring Mountain right next to Basic Chicken n Beer. 

A few new things on the menu, most noticeably are the Shoyu Chicken (havent tried it yet) and the Corned Beef Patty.

Now i know what you're thinking: 'dafaq is a corned beef patty??' It's exactly that...A burger patty of corned beef (canned i think) that's deep fried. How's it taste? Pretty damn good actually! The saltyness of it goes well to balance out the curry. 

Overall nothing's changed very much with Kaba Curry except for the new location as well as a few things on the menu. This is a big step for the small local business and it gives us a unite opportunity to watch them grow as a business.

2249000,2013-08-02,1,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"I have always been fan of Kaba Curry back at there old location and feel like there japanese curry reminds me local style back in da islands. Recently they moved too this new location. I had no idea because went too the old location thinking too myself ""Nooo"" favorite curry house is gone. I asked guys at Wing King told me just moved too new location on spring mountain. I had my hesitation thinking ok big move on its own, bigger, and thinking the quality and service stays the same? Thankfully everything is STILL on point and have nothing but praise small business taking it too another level. 

Compare too the old location its refreshing that you truly feel in restaurant restaurant not food court. The decor keep it simple but elegant in its simplicity!  Still has Kaba Curry logo. some cool artwork with japanese writing, like bar stool area (hold around six), and still get free topping with your yelp checkin. I was happy that they still do the stamp cards. 

The food the base curry on all the food is awesome! This visit I had the Local Kaba Moco never had before. Talk about Winnah! It was exactly what you think local moco style with the hamburger, rice, and fried egg all topped with curry. The hamburger not only was it fresh made burgers but like the touch of diced onions in the hamburger. Everything was perfect compliment on top the other. The menu was small only because they did not have there grand opening till this weekend. The base of there menu will still be the same you choose your sides or toppings and base it on rice or udon noodles or something else not too sure. One thing I am sure is Kaba Curry really has best Curry in town. I love the depth of flavor every time and fact that can mix it up keeps it fresh. 

The service is wonderful. One of the owners came out asking me about ""How did I find out about the place?"" I like always been fan went too the old location heard they moved.

I love roti and usually have it with a yellow curry. The version they have here is pretty good, different not as sweet.  The Gyoza are made with shrimp we also dipped it in the curry of course!  Tried the loco moco.  I really like that the onions are cooked in the burger patty. They ordered the chicken katsu over rice and curry.  The chicken was very clean, just meat with the crunchy coating. And by far the best thing on the menu  is the chantilly kaba cakes.  They steam it and the chocolate cake is so soft.

I had eaten at the old location a while ago and honestly remembered liking it a little more. The curry sauce itself has an enjoyable flavor to it and they offer a nice variety of options--several of which will do in a pinch, but none that entice me to come back to them. Fans of udon noodles can get Curry Udon...that's something you don't find everywhere, but not a big enough draw for me.

Like the 3 Stars say, they're ""A-OK."" There are better options in walking distance though which make me think I will not be coming back anytime soon.

Kaba Curry is open late--2am late...so if you are in the mood for Japanese Curry and it is after 11pm when all the other shops have closed down it would behoove you stop in for a late-night bite. 

The staff is nice, but the small kitchen can get backed up in a hurry. Expect a wait if there are even a few orders ahead of you...or if you are a part of a large party.

Ambiance: 3/5
About 5 booth style seating options, and 2 random two top tables with what looked like a DJ set up near the entrance.  
I honestly didn't get the vibe or the concept of the decor if there was any. During our wait time, it felt more like a frat house than anything. 

Food: 4/5
We ordered the custom curry dishes with spice levels 2-3. The portion of rice is more than generous to be quite honest (previous comments stated the portion was small).

The flavor was amazing, and the chicken was Full Of Flavor and juicy. Presentation had nothing going but it didn't matter much as I devoured the dish completely.

I noticed a family sat down after we did and immediately got back up and left. FYI it's a custom curry style restaurant with a small section of non curry items. For the most part it's all curry built how you like. 

Service: 3/5
Based on the reviews I'm going to assume the gentleman working the front of the house is the owner and there's a one man show in kitchen, which is probably why the food took longer than usual to come out. The gentleman was very nice and sincere about a few items on the menu not being available. 

I over heard a family near us order their Roti Canai which didn't come till the end of their meal. Down the road at Malaysian Island Cuisine, their Roti Canai came out quick.

We would've ordered more, but we arrived late, the fryer was being cleaned. And due to some menu changes, some items were blacked out.

They were extra friendly either way, and the waitress was personable. Carried conversation like we were friends and managed to co-erce the manager for the Wi-fi password for us. LOL

3458017,2013-07-29,3,hiydLAE7gWotTslBJYENrg,"Kaba Curry is a small, ""hole in the wall"" type restaurant close to the strip.  Their food is primarily a mix of Hawaiian and Japanese ingredients - their curry being out of this world amazing, which is obviously where the title of the establishment comes in and what they are best known for.

They have just recently moved to their location as of current and unfortunately with where it is, you do sort of have to look for it, as it doesn't stick out.  They are in the process still of actually getting set up, so there are no markers or signs that stand out  upon entering the Plaza (the name which escapes me) in China Town.  

I can be picky when it comes to food. I'm sure everyone can, especially certain Yelpers!  Let me tell you though, their place is exceptionally clean and the way Antony (the owner of Kaba) and Maki (the co-owner) create and prepare the food, it is divine.  They are both very sweet, friendly and down-to-earth.  They are more than willing to cater to your food-needs and make sure you are completely satisfied before you go.  This may be a ""hole in the wall"" dining experience, but they will definitely make you feel comfortable and at home - you'll become a regular, fast!

Their menu, to be flat out, is a little small.  What I do appreciate though is the simplicity of it.  Essentially, you make your own meal in a 'build your own plate' sort of fashion.  You have the base, your curry spice level, side dishes meant to go on the curry as well as your base choice and amount of ""fun"" as they put it.  The fun, meaning things such as kimchee, corn, cooked eggs and even Fukujinzuke which is pickled ginger.  Their portions are nice, not too much, not too little - it's how I really wish most food was prepared.  I hate having so much on my plate all of the time because I'm sorry, I have a medium sized stomach, not the stomach of a Sumo Wrestler!  Maki prepares the dishes so delicately, I'd trust my food in her care any day.  

Overall, this place needs more publicity and more praise.  Their restaurant is beautiful and it stands out over most other places in the area.  Way to go, Antony and Maki!  Thumbs up!",rTVYLLfmeyAUU7BzidZhUQ,6,5,5,T-5YMr8BSWETeYKeWPaiGg

But since they have moved to this new location, it's definitely not the same.  I don't know if I came on an off day but the curry was not good this time around.  It was too thick and concentrated in taste.  Maybe this curry sauce had been reboiled and remixed for a few days.  I can't put my finger on it, but it just didn't seem right.  I ordered the tonkatsu, karaage and kurobuta soseji (Berkshire pork sausage) for my toppings with extra rice.  The tonkatsu and karaage were quite tender and juicy but I could not even tell that I had any extra rice on my plate.  My wife did not order extra rice and her plate looked the same as mine.  She had garlic chicken and chicken katsu as her toppings.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and was quite moist and delicious.  But because the curry sauce was not very good, it took away from how well made the meats were.  So 3 stars only this time.

Service is nice and the workers are naturally welcoming there.

Environment is neat with dim lighting and the kitchen being out there. Seating is pretty limited, but the place seems slow enough to the point where over crowding shouldnt be a problem.

Im not going to ignore the fact that Curry Zen is nearby. They both have good curry, but Zen seems like it has bigger portions at a better price. Its probably rude to mention competition on Yelp, but theres no ignoring it.

Pros: its japanese curry, service is good, and the people are welcoming

Cons: portions dont seems much for its price

The gf and I came here to meet a few Yelp peeps and to drop off some donations at Yosi.  When we arrived, our Yelp buds were already here and the place wasn't busy.  One thing I immediately noticed, no one had food on their tables. I assumed that they all ordered and were just waiting for their food. About 10 minutes later, one of the employees arrive at their table to finally take their order. Say What?  You know what that meant.  That meant that it's going to take about 15 minutes or so for just our orders to be taken.  Yes, I was right, but it was more like 20 minutes.  Ordering their food is simple, you start at the top with your base, then add to it with whatever they have to offer (i.e. beef, shrimp, egg rolls, shrimp, chicken, etc), and then add toppings of your choice.  I got their Loco Kaba Moco with Chicken Karaage and Chicken Katsu.  I also used my free check in to have mushrooms added.  I thought that food was just okay, nothing spectacular.  I have to admit, I'm not a curry fan.  But Kaba's curry is pretty good.  The karaage and katsu was average.  Remember I had mushrooms added?  Well, they didn't. They forgot the mushrooms, but at this point I didn't care since it was part of my free Yelp check in. 

But back to the service, when our food arrived, they forgot to give me utensils.  And you know me, I need a fork for everything.  I eventually got my fork so I can chow down.  My gurlpren's food took a little longer and when it finally arrived, they decided to be consistent with their service and fail to get her utensils too. 

So, overall my experience here was just okay. I didn't have too many issues with my food because I knew what to expect based on the price and what I was eating. I was just a little disappointed with the overall service. Will I be back? Perhaps, maybe, or maybe not.   

PS:  I turn into the Hulk when I'm starving. I go from hangry to angry. And you wouldn't want to see me when I'm angry.

Walking to the place it was fairly clean and open.  They have a tv which plays the same series of random anime and tuesday blend clips over and over.  The music they were playing gave me the impression that I was walking into some underground fight club which didn't bother me, just gave me a weird vibe.

They have japanese magazines with some business cards on a table in the middle of the restaurant which was cool.  I really enjoyed going through all the pictures in the magazine despite not being able to read it. 

Food: I ordered the loco moco curry dish.  The dish itself was good HOWEVER, the curry was cold.  What I don't understand is how you can advertise yourself as a curry restaurant and to not even keep the curry at a good temperature really disappointed me.  Besides the temperature of the food, the spice level (3-4) was spot on.

When we were finally able to order, there was a list of stuff they had ran out of, so we had to rethink our decisions.

The concept is great and they offer very creative toppings and sides to go along with the curry, but like I said, it may just be a preference thing.

But we were in search of something quick before our movie date. Because Kaba Curry just opened their new location, we figured we give it a try. They are located in the same shopping center as the original SF Supermarket. Their exact location is the 2nd floor next to Bazic and hidden behind the staircase.  No official large signage anywhere yet. 

They have a temporary menu right now which consists of putting together your own curry plate. We went for the staple of Curry & Rice ($4.99) and added one side - Spam Katsu ($1), which is 1 slice.  You can choose your spice level as well. 

Our dish didn't take too long and we woofed it down. We were probably in and out within 15 minutes. There was one party of 2 there before us and a couple of singles that arrived after.

Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with the curry. It had a deep flavor and had the Husband and I rethinking Japanese curry.

Sides range from Ground Beef to Deep Fried Tofu to Tonkatsu from $1 to $3.

Toppings range from Corn to Spinach to Cooked Egg from 50 cents to 75 cents.

I guess most people choose a few sides and toppings to round out their dish.  Good to know for future reference.

Free topping with Yelp check-in! (They just started this a day or two after we went!)

Side note: When we paid with our credit card on the Ipad, we didn't see a spot to add a tip to our total. Did we miss that section?",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,7,4,S-I2IV4-6W3-3lFBPKZwXg

I would warn any one if you are hungry don't get the Japanese sausage, my co-worker who joined me for lunch here ordered it. The sausages were so small it should be embarrassing to this place to serve them. The server was friendly and allowed my co-worker to change his meal. We also had one other issue. I am not sure what they do at night, but they have speakers and what looks like a DJ stand. When we came in the music was quite loud and had to move tables so we could hear each other.

I got the udon curry with just egg and rakkyo. Overall the current was decent, but there was a little too much cumin flavor for me. I do like it with the udon and while I went really plain it stood up well alone. The BF said his loco moco was okay. Mac salad was plentiful and was well made. I was STILL hungry though after eating. I ate a full bahn mi after and got shaved snow immediately after leaving. Not good. I could have ordered more here, but the wait did not lead me to want to get dessert or extra sides. 

I understand with there being large groups there would be some wait, but I just noticed how it was not really efficient. Things were coming out one by one, so I don't think they are doing line procedure in assembling and expediting. Like at our table there was 3 loco mocos and 2 curry udons. You would think all the locos come out together, the udons come out together, etc.

 The first moco was halfway done and the next two arrived a few minutes apart....then my udon came and the BF asked about their side of macaroni. The BF was at a few bites left of his moco before the mac salad came. After all the loco mocos were eaten, finally Christina got her udon which was cold but the gyoza was warmer so they probably had it sitting waiting on the fried gyoza. Most people were saying that one part of their meal was hot while the other was cold. My egg was hot, noodles warm. This feels like a timing issue. A few people at my table who have been here before have said food takes a long time here, even in their previous visits.

Curry is made in large batches, the sides are made to order for it. 90minutes of a meal just seemed a bit long for our 2 tables plus a few people at the bar and one group of 3 in the restaurant. 

The waitress was nice enough. 

It's alright. I think I prefer curry elsewhere. I did like the udon curry noodles, but that is not a 1 hour 10 minute wait worthy food. Very few things for me is.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,5,3,OeSrPShQ74kf2EomRxokkA

They have a very casual vibe here.  Clean setup, nice atmosphere, and the friendly staff goes well with the good food served here.

My fav so far has been the Curry Rice ($11): Tonkatsu, Kaarage, and Fried Egg. I asked for the ""spicy"" curry, and it packs a punch! It was only a little bit spicy in my book, but there was TONS of flavor! My favorite Japanese CURRY so far.

I would say the Tonkatsu was passable though, as well as the Kaarage.  I think the best sides so far have been the Chicken Katsu and Kurobuta Sausage personally.

Also tried the Curry Cheese Fries ($12-13): Chicken Katsu, Kurobuta Sausage, Corn and Mushrooms. This was much different but tasty! Recommended if you want to try something new in a less traditional sense.

We have also tried the Curry Udon, which is essentially udon noodles with a curry broth.  It is thin enough to drink as a soup without being overpowering.  The flavor is good, but the combination was a little different.  Give it a try if you are looking for something different.

And to finish, we got to try the Pumpkin Kaba Cakes. These were pretty awesome! They steam the cakes here, so they come out super moist, rich, and delicious!  This was the highlight of the meal, along with the flavorful curry :)

Check it out if you are craving curry!

- The food reminds me of something I stir up when I was in college. Get some Golden Curry by S&B, canned corn, fry myself an egg, steam some rice, and top it off with some Kim Chi I bought at HMart. What I can't make and would take some time is the Tonkatsu. 
- The tonkatsu was good. flaky, better than L&Ls, but nothing like Yu-Yu on Chinatown. 
- Portions are average. Didn't get full, but enough to be satisfied. 
- I personally think, although not curry but pretty similar, is Island Style's cutlet with gravy is better, especially for the price. 
- Friendly service. Pretty empty so we got in and out in about 30 minutes.

What didn't change is their service. Friendly and they genuinely care about their product and their customers.

I normally get rice and chicken katsu/ pork tonkatsu with whatever toppings I feel like having that day + a melon soda/ Ramune. Last time I went, I tried the curry cheese fries with chicken katsu, kurobuta sausage, korokke (croquettes) corn and mushrooms. I got one topping for free for checking in. I can't say I've tried anything on their menu I didn't like.

We were asked if we want to be guinea pigs and try their seasonal pumpkin kaba cake (available Oct-Nov only). Since I love their kaba cake (green tea), we couldn't say no! Their kaba cakes are steamed so they're very moist and soft. The pumpkin kaba cake had only a hint of pumpkin which is good because I hate pumpkin. The frosting was great. Their desserts aren't super sweet.

So you pick a curry base, spice level, side(s) and topping(s). They also have salads, curry chili bowl, roti, chicken plate, furikake and desserts.

 The portion size is quite generous and the staff is quite sociable and friendly. Kaba Curry can quickly change from a quick dine in to  regular stop. I can surely say, I'm glad i have become a regular here.

The staff is really friendly and have greeted me with a smile both times I have been there. They excuse themselves when busy and always make sure that the guest knows that they are not being ignored.

The food is good. I had the Kaba Moco and thought it was solid in flavor. The complaint comes in the fact that I always feel the need for more pickled radish and scallions. I wish they would just put some on the table. Besides that small inconvenience, I didn't care for the wait time on certain items. My friends ordered curry udon and it took some time before they got their items. Other people had their meals already and were trying to wait. One of the udons was lukewarm at best. By that time, most of our meals were in an attempt to wait. I understand that the kitchen is small. I would go back.

It seems like if you are a fan of Thai Curry you will probably be a fan of this place. 

I ordered the Curry Rice + Chicken Katsu + Chicken Karaage. Growing up on Japanese Curry I like it thick and spicy (shout out to those ladies). Kaba's curry is a little bit watered down as if they use apple sauce to mild the curry (I hate when my mom did this). Shit I just realized I never let the girl know how hot I wanted it...maybe this was why the flavor was a little bit tangy which was different than what I am used to. 

The Chicken Katsu was on point, the Chicken Karaage was as well. Probably the best Chicken Karaage in town in my opinion. If you don't know what it is it's basically a lighter fried chicken with flavor to it. The staple dish that I grew up on...If this place sold Chicken Karaage and the varieties that you can make Karaage this place would have got damn near 5 stars but we talking bout curry.

Like I mentioned the concept is cool, caters towards my generation and younger and has many items to add-on with. However in my PERSONAL OPINION the curry was a miss. I do want to try it on a spicier level so I would probably try it again.

I came here with a few friends. When we walked in there were a few people seated at the bar, and two other tables, but it didn't seem busy. We weren't sure if we seated ourselves or not, and w weren't greeted so we just sat at an open table. 

It took a little while before we were even acknowledged, but the server was apologetic and got us started with drinks. Unfortunately, when we ordered the server came back and told us they were sold out and that we had to reorder. After changing my order, I ended up getting the standard Katsu Curry and added a fried egg. When we ordered the server warned us there was only one cook, and that service would be a little slow. I didn't mind at first, but after over an hour of waiting, I started to wonder if we should go elsewhere. They did give us some jello straws to snack on while we waited, I appreciated the gesture, but didn't really care for the jello.

Once we got our food, I was a little disappointed with the portion size. As far as taste, the curry was flavorful and the katsu was cooked well. It was tasty, but not worth waiting over an hour for.  

They gave us a complimentary dessert for the excessive wait time, a chocolate cake with a Chantilly sauce. 

I checked in on yelp and got my topping free which was nice. It's a bit pricey considering how much you food you get. I did like how customizable their menu was, but the combinations add up quickly. Without any extras, and the free topping deal, my Katsu Curry was $9.

The food was okay, but the slow service was disappointing. They did try to make up for it, and I appreciated that so for now this place gets 3 stars from me.

However, it was for a good cause as a group of Yelpers dined here after bringing donations for Typhoon Haiyan victims.  I liked the simple menu:  choose a base of curry with rice, udon, fried rice, or fries and then proceed to add to sides to the base, from chicken katsu, lumpia, fried shrimp, to gyoza, corned beef hash, and fried Spam.  Plus, you can add toppings, as well (corn, mushrooms, cheese, to name a few).  According to the menu, you're also supposed to choose your spice level, but we weren't asked what level we'd like.

With a spacious venue I am not rubbing elbows with people while trying to eat or bumping the chairs of other people trying to get to the restroom to wash my hands.

It was finally getting cold here in Vegas, so it was the perfect time to eat curry and visit the new location. I'm glad that they have an actual restaurant now, because let's be honest here, that food court was deserted and kind of sad. I was a little disappointed not to see the friendly faces of Anthony and Maki when we walked in. They were always present at the old location. 

The menu had changed quite a bit, but in a good way. It was nice to see more options for sides and toppings, as well as some new desserts. Now you can also choose spice levels, which doesn't apply to me since I stay away from spicy foods, but I know that people like to have the option.

The restaurant was clean and spacious. The employees were friendly and attentive. Our food came out quickly and the Chicken Katsu was still as awesome as before. My only complaint? Well, maybe two. First, the temperature of the curry was disappointing. No, I don't want my curry to be boiling hot, but I definitely don't want it to be at room temperature either. Yes, it was that bad. I guess it was partly my fault because I could have complained. But on the other hand, I didn't know these employees. What if they got mad about me complaining and spit in my food? LOL totally kidding. But seriously, lukewarm curry does not taste good! This second one is more of a suggestion than a complaint. It would really be nice if they had brown rice as an option, even if there was an extra charge for it. 

They have a ""frequent grubbers card"" so make sure you ask for one if they forget to offer it to you.
