383840,2015-05-07,0,Oy7IBK9CcfnBrP5EZaOEiQ,"Joel is fantastic!  If you need any work on your fireplace, call Joel.  He rehabbed my 1995-era gas fireplace which had been non-functional since I moved into my house several years ago.  He replaced the burner which was totally corroded out, powder coated the brass doors in black, replaced the wood & brass handles with more contemporary-looking handles, replaced the gas logs with pebble glass that I picked out, and basically made my old fireplace look and work better than new!

Shortly after I moved into my house several years ago, I'd had a fireplace contractor take a look at the fireplace to get it working again.  The burner was totally corroded out, and the other contractor told me that the fireplace manufacturer was no longer in business, he couldn't get parts, and that was basically the end of it.  I figured I would eventually need to replace the entire fireplace.  Fast forward several years...Joel takes a look at it, and it's a totally different story!  He said it wouldn't be an issue to replace the burner...and then he proceeds to tell me everything else he can do to bring my fireplace back to life.  Suffice it to say, I was thrilled. He definitely followed through, and I am extremely pleased with the results and the price.

I am a Realtor, and Joel also did work on a fireplace in one of my team's listings, which was found to not be working during the buyer's inspection.  Again, Joel exceeded our expectations and didn't just fix the problem; he went above and beyond and had the fireplace looking like new again.  
 
By the way, Joel was very neat during his work, covering the floor around the fireplace.  He was also very responsive and good at following up.",NulblZLuFnSLau3FzrzgtQ,3,0,5,p-VTekpIk6-ZmEAwdL3WSg

He quoted us over the phone an ""idea"" of what we could expect, to ""get it up and running"", given my description.

Much to my surprise he diagnosed the problem within minutes, climbed onto my roof to ensure the vent was working properly, wore covers over his shoes, laid out a blanket, removed and cleaned the fireplace doors, the mesh screen, the gas log and the gas supply line - what a surprise.  When he said he wanted to go on the roof, my heart sank, thinking - this is where my price doubles.  Again, this guy is as honest as they come, the price was the same as his quote.

Unfortunately, I can't provide a positive review of Joel's Fireplace (Joel Walker) since I was only able to get as far as paying Joel a ""50% deposit"", BUT, up to this date, he has failed to purchase the fireplace unit and he didn't provide any installation services. BUYER BEWARE! Joel still has not returned my $750.

The following description and pics are being posted here so other prospective customers in Las Vegas don't fall victim to Joel's Fireplace or Joel Walker.

I was looking to upgrade my existing fireplace so I found ""Joel's Fireplace"" on Google. On March 9, 2016, I presented Joel with a $750 check ""as a 50% down payment"" when he came to my house to haul away my original fireplace. At that initial in-person meeting, I felt Joel was very pleasant and knowledgeable about fireplaces - I even posted a ""locals"" recommendation to my fellow Las Vegans for Joel's services on my Facebook page. On March 14, 2016, Joel cashed my check. It's been eight months, and Joel has not provided the fireplace unit or installation services as written in his Proposal.

For the past eight months, Joel has played ""text and phone tag"" with me as he dodges my attempts to recover my $750 deposit. From my perspective, Joel probably knows a lot about his fireplace trade, but I do not think it would be smart (or safe) for someone to invite this type of person into your house to estimate your fireplace remodeling project.

Please see the included pics that illustrate my interaction with Joel Walker. I plan to take this person to Small Claims Court in order to recover my $750 deposit. BUYER BEWARE!",GH8FVRrjGKb9_s2a3FEcmw,9,1,1,BvAbSoZJuWezmRnQPZ2b9Q
