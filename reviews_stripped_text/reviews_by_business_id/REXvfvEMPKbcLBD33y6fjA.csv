51133,2016-03-20,0,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,Only reason reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the chef (which gave excellent customer service) made up for the HORRIBLE service we experienced for my sisters 21st bday dinner. Our server was very rude no smile at all made us feel like we were bothering him the entire time. Could definitely feel like he did not want to set our party.  Had to ask for refills more than once and still charged a gratuity of over $70 which he did not deserve at all. Asked to speak to a manger there was not one available stated the employee which I'm guessing was the bartender that helped us more than our actual server. She was even the one to drop the check and cash us out. Thank god the chef was awesome and somewhat made up for this horrible experience. Next time I will make sure that man is not our server.,Gh9zRil-3jSs6WoxhLNjqA,0,0,2,ScZXdna6nwuxml5rM4lj0Q

214389,2013-04-16,0,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"One of the best teppanyaki places I've been to ever, and I've lived in Japan. 

The place is nestled away in the back corner of a rundown looking strip mall which set us a bit wary, they have been there for a long time, and over the years the area has slowly deteriorated, but the inside is a completely different story. The accomidations are nice and the people are friendly, everything is clean and lit nicely. 

Prices are somewhat expensive (a bottle of sayuri nigori sake which goes for around $12 at many Japanese restaurants is $17 here) but their portion sizes are large, their skill great, quality of food awesome, and taste is delicious. Between everything the chef cooked, he would wipe down and clean the griddle which was great not only to preserve the quality of the taste but because it speaks to their standards as well. 

Bottom line? I would definately return in the future. Everything gets 5 stars except for atmosphere. The place is pretty small and sound echoes loudly, as a result if a chef is cooking nearby (we were in the middle table so they were always nearby) you can't have a conversation with anyone but the person next to you, and you have to yell at eachother to do so.",M7IdUGWZSGGvbFpTUYkuqg,3,0,4,S8LNu1AJn7M7bguF9rl8HQ

335585,2007-06-18,1,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"My boyfriend's favorite restaurant for all birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations is Geisha Steakhouse. At first, I didn't know why at first, but now it's clear. I'm not exactly sure if this is a franchise, but it doesn't feel like it. The restaurant is small and I recommend making reservations way in advance or you could wait an hour or more for a table. Considering there are only like six tables total, it's understandable. We always get a mix of seafood, chicken, and steak. This is the best way to go, especially for a big party. The wait staff is always friendly, and eager to pour sake down your throat. Don't be fooled by the lack of decoration, it's really not what this place is about. The food more than makes up for it. At least once, get away from all of the teppan yaki places around the strip, and try Geisha. If will hook you, or at least get you drunk.

Recommended meal: The combo dinner complete with shrimp, lobster, chicken, steak and soup/salad appetizers.

Recommended drink: I don't think you have a choice, but sake goes great with the meal.

Recommended company: Getting rowdy in this small area seems to be the norm, so a night out with friends is the way to go, not so much for the romantics.",HaPtQKTZmtIDjyKzjaCmqA,3,0,5,Pz5DzX5_jk-raxFm5cPAKw

I'd  say they're equally as good as the place in the westgate, and the prices are comparable. Though the restaurant at westgate is far nicer, and I think they use ingredients  of a slightly higher caliber. The bad part is this, before we went, we made a reservation for 7:30 through the yelp app, when we got there  they had no idea what we were talking about and said we had to wait til 8, so we didn't get seated til about 8:05 and the server totally had an attitude, the customer service of the wait staff definitely leaves something to be desired. Our teppanyaki chef however,  was absolutely amazing, total sweetheart so no complaints there.  Next issue is that before we came, we had already looked at the menu online and picked which sushi rolls we wanted, I had my heart set on it, only to find out when we were finally seated that they don't serve sushi at the Desert inn and sandhill location :(  I really wish they'd have put that on their  website somewhere. All the food was delicious, with the sole exception of the salad, which was liquidy amd soggy. Would I go back? No, I'd  rather soend the same amount of money for better quality and a nice place / wait staff and go to Benihanas.

My best friend Justin took me to dinner the other night to the Geisha House. We walked in with NO reservation and had to wait just a few minutes.  Not long at all really. The hostess sat us at a table with three women whom we didn't know.. But with hibachi dining there is always the opportunity to make friends! 
We ordered the Geisha Special which Includes:
Choice of Appetizer
Small Sake, House wine or Soft Drink
Soup and Salad
Hibachi Shrimp
Mushrooms, Onions, Zucchini,
Bean Sprouts and Fried rice
Entrees:
Filet Mignon, Chicken and Lobster

We started with some wine. 
Then a vegetable and shrimp tempura - delicious!

Then Joshua our hibachi chef came out and began his magic. He welcomed us and made a huge poof of flames on the grill. Then he cracked some eggs to make the rice... I actually got a picture of his flying egg and will post it later.  Then he added the eggs to the house sweet rice. Delicious and even though I watched him make it.. I still do not know everything that is in it.  
He madea darling heart out of our rice before serving it up. Thank goodness he let us eat while  he started cooking some  zuccini, mushroom and onion.   and began cooking the meat .. YUM.
We had more wine then the girls at our table drank some sake bombs.. 
the staff yelled Sake Sake
We yelled 
Bomb Bomb 
Think Irish Car Bomb only sapporo beer and shots of sake. 
This is one of the truly great meals and a must do in Vegas. If you have a hankerin for a hibachi grill this is just as good as Benihana and less expensive... 
And you can definitely make some new and interesting friends while drinking the sake bomb...",Pn4W0F3wc6B5fAEwpKY0rQ,5,2,5,EdLQ0dqYMtutNg4b7uMalg

The pink sauce goes on EVERYTHING, it is not very flavor full and I thought maybe it only goes on the rice as a gimmick to make it pink. When I blinked it was in my lobster (which was already out of its tail and looked defrosted) and on my shrimp, I told him to please not put it on my steak.

1360723,2017-06-16,0,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"This is the strangest and arguably the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  We came into this restaurant craving Japanese dining.  I was with a blind friend (white cane, etc), a retired US Army Ranger who served 21 years.  

I have been a global business traveler for decades, as has my friend.  We have been all around the world, and between us could not come up with another story to match this.  It has been 6 weeks since then, and it still feels just as ugly as it did then.  If I was to rank restaurant experiences from worst to first out of over 2,000 such experiences, I would rank this one as the single worst.  

We were in town for a martial arts tournament.  We stepped in and were greeted coldly by the ""host"", which seemed very odd as we were kind, quiet and polite.  We were well dressed and ... again, my friend is clearly blind.

It was 6:20pm on a weekday.  They asked us to wait.  I looked around the restaurant.  There were a total of two tables with customers seated.  The entire rest of the place was empty.  We stood there, feeling awkward about this for over 20 minutes.  It was beyond strange.

We were literally ignored as the hosts walked right by and completely avoided us repeatedly.  We were the only ones there, so rather hard to ignore unless intentional.  It clearly felt like they had decided not to serve us.  It seemed to be their thinking that if they could avoid seating us, then they would avoid serving us, and if they avoided acknowledging our existence further, they could avoid seating us.  

I whispered to my friend in jest after 15+ minutes that perhaps they do not serve people of his ethnicity.  After a few more minutes, we uneasily realized that this may actually be the case, and that there was some kind of very strange behavior going on here.  We are at a loss to explain it any other way.  We had kindly inquired as to availability of seating twice now and were literally ignored as though we were fish in a tank they were passing by.  

We finally left in disgust, walked across the street and had a very nice Chinese meal.  Looking back at it, it is hard for me to grok that it really did happen this way, but indeed it did.

It does get pretty warm at the table, especially when they start cooking. We ordered the Geisha Special and just the Filet Steak dinner for me. They were awesome too, by bringing an extra plate for my toddler son and dividing him a portion from our orders. The service was great, timely, attentive, and all smiles.

I wanted to find a place in Vegas that served awesome hibachi style food, so I came to Yelp to help me narrow it down. I saw that Geisha was VERY highly regarded, so I went there during a sunday night. I already knew from reading the reviews that the restaurant was not exactly located in what you would call a ""high end"" part of town. It is actually located at the end of a small strip mall. However I learned first hand that looks can be very deceiving. To make a long story short: This place is AWESOME! First off, the manager was as nice as could be and was legitimately interested in making sure I had a great time at his place. Second, the chef was outstanding in his skills as he prepared the meals. I sat with a couple of UNLV students who stated they came there at least once a month. Thirdly, the food was fantastic and very reasonably priced. I had the Geisha special of soup, salad, a soft drink, and the hibachi combo of lobster, shrimp, and filet. The fried rice that they make is the tastiest I have had at any of these places. I have stayed at the Las Vegas Hilton several times. They have a Benihana there, so I could have easily gone there instead of driving over to Geisha. But when I eat out the most important thing to me is the meal itself. Not the ambiance or location. I HIGHLY recommend this establishment",n0XUraqJ6mbc0_AJMgEd0Q,2,0,5,EJa0BsRbxvcANyD844EoaQ

1978977,2017-06-19,2,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"Let's get the not-so-good out of the way first. Firstly, our Teppan chef was not Japanese. He was Hispanic. He was nice but was lacking in skills. You know the part where the Teppan chef demonstrates his knife skills? This guy basically banged the stove and made a lot of noises but really didn't do anything. The owner was also not Japanese. He was Korean. The stove itself was smaller than your normal Teppan place. It only seated about 6 people as oppose to other places where you can seat about 10 people. We were there on a Sunday Night about 6:00 PM and our table was the only one being used. The place is also about 5 miles from the Strip so be prepare to drive a while through the non-Vegas part of town. 

Here is good part. The food was delicious. I ordered the steak and it was unbelievably tasty. The portions were ample. We both could not finish our dinners and I can eat a lot. They used a ""pink sauce"" which is basically butter, garlic and food coloring. It sounds gross but it made the fried rice very tasty. The service was pretty good. The other waiters kept coming around to make sure we had our drinks. The price was very good despite being in Vegas. You can have a steak Teppan dinner for about $24.00. 

Overall, this is a decent place if you are in Vegas and you're sick of buffets and fancy restaurants that are ridiculously expensive. If you are new to Teppan, it would be impressive. If you are used to Benihana-types of restaurants, this place may not measure up.",qXn9y0Dq0DWF9Q6_t9t6qQ,1,2,3,iC7pX2hpYlWzvvEl35R0Qg

Our chef Eddie came out just as soon as we finished with our appetizer! He introduced himself then did a fun knife and spatula presentation that my kids loved!

The food OMG the food...I had the Geisha Special, which had Filet Mignon, Lobster, Shrimp, and Chicken.  The Filet was super tender high quality beef, melts in your mouth! Best shrimp ever, even my boyfriend loved it and he DOES NOT like seafood besides sushi (weird I know!).  That special also came with the house sake, which had the perfect amount of potent w/o the getting you fucked up too quickly and hurling your dinner (which would be a waste).

The fried rice is incredibly good. Definitely worth the $35

Made a reservation for my husband and I along with another couple for a Sunday night.  We were on time and the place was pretty deserted (which was nice).  We were seated immediately at a hibachi table and our drink order was taken.  

I opted for the chicken dinner and my husband went with the filet mignon.  Fair warning:  it's A LOT of food.  They start with a flavorful beef based broth-type soup with mushrooms, fried onions and scallions.  Next is a small salad with a light, tangy vinaigrette (I suppose) dressing.  It was a nice accompaniment to the soup.  The chef then started his show on the grill and it did not disappoint.  He made fried rice (you pay extra for that at Benihana, by the way) and grilled mushrooms, onions, zucchini and bean sprouts.  I don't know what that pink special sauce is but they need to bottle and sell it!  It gives everything an amazing flavor and, um, hello?  It's pink!!!  My husband is allergic to shrimp so he did our entrees next and then the shrimp last. The chicken and meat were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  

The food was excellent.  There's just something about watching food being cooked right in front of you that makes it taste better.  Am I right?  Like I said, they give you lots of it - I had to give about half of mine to my husband to finish.  The chef was wonderful - he did all the standard tricks and had a fun personality to boot.  The service was excellent - our drinks were refilled without having to ask and we were doted upon the entire time (the benefits of an empty dining room, I suppose?).

The restaurant itself is clean and updated from the last time I had been there (years and years and years ago).  They've separated the hibachi tables from the sushi bar so there's a nice distinction between the 2 dining areas.  The hibachi booths are comfy and roomy and the bathrooms are clean (always a non-negotiable in my opinion).

The only drawback that I saw was the potential for a long wait time should we not have had a reservation.  There was only one chef that night and it was pretty slow in there but if a walk in party had arrived, I imagine they would have had to wait for the chef to finish with us and that would have made for a long wait time.  My suggestion?  Make a reservation if at all possible.

I honestly feel like this place blows Benihana out of the water.  The food was better, the service more attentive and I kid you not, our total bill at Geisha House was HALF of what it was at Benihana.  Go to Benihana once for the experience (it really is an incredibly gorgeous restaurant) but go to Geisha House again and again for what's really important - food, service and value.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,1,0,5,x6mSvZZw8XwAB7YFweQSUw

3450539,2014-02-16,0,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"My husband and I went to Geisha Steakhouse (Desert Inn location) this evening for a post Valentines Day dinner.  The staff was outstanding and the food was outstanding and James was our Chef who was very entertaining.  The atmosphere is cozy and we enjoyed the company of the very young couple who were seated at our table.  We were there early because we don't enjoy crowds and waiting, so there was much attention to our table by the staff.  We both ordered the Geisha Special and the steak and lobster were both cooked to perfection.

We here from Chicago and the Japanese Steakhouse we frequented offered an ""Egg Yolk Sauce"" that was simply delicious.  We were disappointed to find out that the staff at Geisha was not aware of such a sauce.  They were very interested to hear about the sauce and so the best I could find on Google is as follows:

(1 cup mayonnaise (I use safflower mayonnaise because I try to avoid canola oil)
4 egg yolks
1.5 tbsp white miso
about 2 tsp of sesame oil and 1 tsp soy sauce

Combine all that in a food processor. Put it in a bowl in the fridge until it firms back up.

Pan-sear 2 pounds of scallops on one side. You'll be doing this in batches, so when they're done put them on a plate, then reduce the heat to medium-low and put them all back into the pan when they're all seared, making sure that the seared side is up. Spoon the sauce on top of the scallops, and put a lid on the skillet. Cook over medium-low heat for five minutes, until the sauce starts to brown around the edges.)

I really hope  they research this sauce, everyone in the Mid-west seems to be familiar with it and how wonderfully it accents the Teppan-style of cooking.  I also want to mention that the wasabi was outstanding!!!!!!!!!",-w0sJlKr8avNP3lvv6VMCA,1,0,5,YSm1-8bJM1h4PmvG2cgYqQ

I called about an hour ahead of time to make reservations and we ventured on our way....It's kind of a sketchy area - as old downtown usually is - and the inside could definitely use an update.

We were greeted and seated almost immediately, even though we were about 30 minutes early for our reservation. I loved the seating.....it made it seem authentic plus the seats were very comfortable.

So yeah, we were a little reluctant to go inside, considering the scenery was pretty ghetto and run-down but i'm SO GLAD we did because this was the best steak I have ever had in my little life.

Both of us ordered the NY steak strip-this piece of meat was so tender and such good quality, it might as well have been filet mignon. The chef did his thing and cooked everything in front of us, playing with knives and what not, adding magic red stuff here and a bottle labeled ""diet coke"" there, creating the most delicious meal I have ever had. I mean, seriously, this may be my number one meal to have before I die. I'm coming back to Vegas from Geisha House. YUM

With the NY Steak, you get three pieces of shrimp, the best fried rice ever (they add sesame seeds which are a nice touch), vegetables (mushrooms, onions, zucchini, and bean sprouts) and soup (some kind of mushroom miso soup, so good) and salad (your basic Japanese salad with ginger dressing, amazing!) All of this is for 20 dollars. 

Service was impeccable, atmosphere is cozy and intimate and not exactly   very elegant, but my bf and I don't roll that way anyway; we would rather have good quality food over ambiance.

4052525,2013-02-17,6,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"Valentines Dinner 2013!!!

Question for you...Where does a Yelper celebrate Valentines?  A restaurant that's been bookmarked, that's where.  No quiet candle light, no short walk around town, and no 5 star restaurant.  I'm just as romantic as it gets.  

Geisha Steakhouse is located on the eastside of town.  Not the best neighborhood at night, but nothing stands in my way when it comes to food.  Their normal menu is put on hold for Valentines so the choices are Their Valentines Dinner ($99), Seafood Lover ($40 each person), or their Land Lover ($40 each person).  I wanted to try their Land Lover, which consisted of their Rib Eye, Chicken and Filet Mignon.  I wanted this so bad, but couldn't since I dropped red meat for Lent.  My Valentine and I opted for the Seafood Lover which consists of Shrimp, Scallops, Lobster, and fried rice.  I admit, this meal was pretty damn good.  All three seafood pieces looked, tasted great, and was flavorful.  I've always loved lobster and shrimp, now scallops are becoming a new favorite. Because it was seafood, the meal wasn't too filling in the beginning. In other words, I wasn't initially full. It wasn't until I finished my fried rice that I became stuffed.  I was so full that my second Valentine venture was going to be a tough one to accomplish. 

I enjoyed the ambiance that almost all Teppanyaki restaurants have to offer.  Geisha Steakhouse has that same type of ambiance;  group type seating, entertaining/skillfull teppanyaki chefs, and great tasting food. 

I really can't wait until Easter so I can come back and try their chicken and filet mignon.  You definitely can't go wrong with this place since there's a selection.  

PS:  I love me some lobster.  Geisha's was good, but they also reminded me that I must take a trip back to Lobster Me for their Lobster Mac N' Cheese.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8,6,4,GhLOgsPskto7VJPc-XobJw

I did have some of there fresh, basic sushi, and it was good which added to it not being overpriced. The main dinner entrees are large enough to split, which I would recommend considering they are a tad bit pricey. Overall...I know now to get one entree between 2 people, and get it with some sushi.. you'd be set. I will say the energy of staff is lacking... one chef, which seemed to handle the order of guest's that were coming in just fine, and our hard to read server could probably use some help with another server or 2. Apparently they added the sushi bar side recently, and glammed up that side of the restaurant. Being a local I always hope for original restaurant's to stick around and keep their character...many people have memories here, and its located in an area best catered to locals.

No, this place isn't in the most desirable end of town. Desert Inn and Sandhill - there is no denying this is a dumpy part of town. The place is even in a suite in a shopping center next to a Mexican church. No joke. 

But the food here is to die for, and the staff are all excellent, with a good sense of humor. I have had the chicken and steak dishes they have to offer - all come out excellent. The fried rice is the best in town, and the other items won't fail to please either. It's good to see a restaurant that isn't so obsessed with decorating their restaurant that it comes at the expense of food. 

This place is always welcoming. I admit, I'm not a huge fan of the ""all red"" lighting scheme in here, but it's a small price to pay for great food. Max, the guy who almost always cooks for me and my family, has a great personality and cooking skills alike.

 We went in around 9 pm on Wednesday night. There was only one other table full, the place was empty. The service was fast and very attentive.
  I ordered the combo, chicken, filet, and lobster. The special came with a small saki and appetizer for $35.
  The chef was very nice, average table skills. He started with the fried rice, and the house seasoned butter was a very nice change. The fried rice was excellent, good flavor. I ordered my filet rare, and it was cooked perfect. Seasoned well and tasted great. My chicken and lobster both were over cooked however.

We decided to order the NY steak and scallops, with an appetizer, instead of the larger deal (which included dessert) that the waiter suggested. It was actually plenty of food for two, and we had no room for any dessert. As an appetizer, we had the shrimp tempura, and they had a cream cheese stuffing. They were delicious, and about 6 per serving. The steak was solid, though a bit overdone for my taste (I asked for medium). The scallops were buttery and delicious. The fried rice was the best part! They use a special butter with which to fry it, and it is to die for! Our chef was very entertaining too. Overall, it is a great place with good ambiance, and a friendly staff.

Appetizer I Would Recommend: 
-The egg rolls! they were delicious and had the perfect amount of sauce and seasoning. The wrappers for the egg rolls were perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy and very light.

5436763,2014-08-30,2,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"3 1/2 stars for Geisha Steakhouse. Good waiter service and our chef was pretty darn good. Very friendly, did a good job entertaining us, and overall tried to make our experience fun, especially the kids.

I really disliked the size of the meat portions, for the ""land lover special"", and thought they were way too small for $38. The chicken was too thin, overcooked and a bit tough and the NY steak was good, but nothing too terribly special. However, the filet was outstanding in terms of tenderness, quality and seasoning.

The mushroom soup was very, very good. The salad was bland and pretty much sucked. The tempura battered veggies and shrimp were good but pretty standard. Batter and hot oil, not too hard to get it right.

The fried rice had too much seasoning and their ""pink special sauce"" which gave it a bit of an oily, overpowering flavor. The amount of vegetables was a lot less than I'm accustomed to at a Japanese steakhouse and they should really step it up to help balance out their lack of protein portions.

All in all we thought it was pretty good but there's definitely room for some improvement.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,2,1,3,WlRbMO5f5_6MAreu5GTq-Q

5653759,2016-05-22,0,REXvfvEMPKbcLBD33y6fjA,"This is the original Geisha Steakhouse which has been around for a loooooonnnggg time believe me. I had one of my first dates with my husband here back in the late 80's and we have introduced many people to this restaurant including our daughter, Mom and Dad, hubby's Dad, other family members and a ton of friends.  All is can say is the food is consistently delicious every time we come. Since we no longer live on this side of town, we only come now for special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries etc. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy especially at night but I would only patronize this location. 

Last night was no exception to the incredible food found here. There were five of us last night and we all ordered the Geisha Special which consists of filet mignon (cooked exactly how you like it), lobster, shrimp and chicken. Each dinner comes with a bowl of miso soup, a salad, your choice of appetizer of either Shrimp tempura, shrimp and vegetable tempura or an egg roll. Then you have fried rice and vegetables as well. The dinner also includes your choice of soda or hot sake. In the old days, the dinner used to include dessert too of which I always chose the green tea ice cream. I sure do miss it! Once the orders are in, out comes the chef to cook up your meal on the teppanyaki grill. We have had some really funny chefs through the years that have provided us with a ton of entertainment. Our favorite will always be Chef Jimmy - RIP. He was the original owner of this restaurant and he always cooked our food to perfection and left us laughing our asses off.

Once the cooking begins there is fire and heat and the smells coming from the food are mouth watering, you literally can't wait for your food to be delivered to your plate. The lobster was just so fresh and light. Dipping into a delicious ginger sauce just set all the flavors into an explosion in your mouth. The filet mignon was juicy and dipped into the hot mustard sauce made it even better. The chicken is always good and when the fried rice comes off the grill I just want to dive into it. 

The customer service is outstanding and our server was always offering us more drinks, filling our water glasses and removing empty plates from the small eating area. The restaurant is not that big so I recommend always making a reservation just in case especially on the weekends.

Long live Geisha Steakhouse!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,2,0,5,treKNlPawdE-524Jj71mow
