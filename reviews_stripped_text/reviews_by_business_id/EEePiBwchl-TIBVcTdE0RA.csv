It's disgusting enough of a fact that the only thing to eat at Excalibur between the hours of 0200 and 0600 is McDonald's, Starbucks, and Krispy Kreme. But then, to be forced to go to McDonald's and find this pitiful excuse of an establishment instead.... for shame. The first night they ran out of Butterfinger topping for a McFlurry. The second night, they claimed their ice cream machine was ""locked."" Not broken.... but locked. WTF is that?!?! If you are the only late night eatery available, you better have all your menu items available because I have a bit of a sweet tooth.

We wanted a quick breakfast at around 9:30 a.m., so my friend decided to grab some for us to bring back to the room before heading out for the day. He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich.

I am not sad at all that they are now GONE...  They were extremely overpriced.  The core employees were very rude.  Never did I ever get a correct order here the first time.  Many times, not even the second try was right.  The rude employees would try to say that you got what you ordered even when you had your receipt that proved them wrong.  A couple of months ago, got some McRibs because they were on sale... they served them to me without any BBQ sauce on them.  No, not a little sauce, ZERO sauce.  When I mentioned it, they didn't say anything about them and just jerked them from me.  I had to wait more than a half hour while I watched the girl try to open the bag of BBQ sauce... that was it, they were just too lazy to open the sauce and prepare the food correctly.  EVERY TIME I was there, most of the wait was because they had to re-make so many of the orders...  The CREW and their service was PATHETIC.   Anyway, I walked through there today and was relieved that the horrible place was gone...   but the problem is that some other Burger place is going in there and you know that they'll be extremely expensive.",-vTIOBkGfZ6JdP0RROs6Fw,0,0,1,6lm0h7nTr3uaPTYy8f65fg

What impressed me the most was the friendliness of the employees here.  They even had staff monitoring the lobby and promptly clearing tables that tourists would just rudely abandon with all their garbage left in place.

I needed a restroom and one of the lobby staff gave me clear and easy directions with a smile as if he was glad to help.

This place is so pitiful just thinking about it makes me angry. I don't even know where to start! Besides Starbucks and Krispy Kreme this is your only option for late night eats at The Excalibur. Here it goes:

Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.
My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. 

Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. 
After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight  cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!

If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've.  If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.",upQW7sPfOfh0brmyq2byEg,3,1,1,BcArrM2cy7ZVidw0YBF43Q
