A lot of people were getting gas but it still went by quickly and I really don't have any complaints about this place. 

Just remember to pump your gas in Vegas before you start your long drive back home. You don't want to be in the middle of the dessert with no gas...that is just not good.",UQa9RqoJZWAawzqN-2pT2Q,6,5,4,Gpli5nXzCe0aK5PvCe1rXg

My car is very picky and if the octan precentage is incorrect it'll drive bad, put gas on this location you'll keep your car in great shape. Price is good as well compair other gas stations.

4313034,2016-01-29,0,sTC2SI7znjcukc-EtA0wYg,Gas is always high at this spot since it's right near the airport and on the strip but it's outrageously convenient - hence the name. So I make it work. But you will pay more here for sure,YbhLTSe0dlu7olOHZkNSkw,0,0,3,Ck8AnYJw9qpsO8UeEezDUA

Gotta love the super cheap gas prices in vegas...im talking like SUPER DUPER CHEAP GAS PRICES. 

Its a tradition for me to fill at this station because I refuse to fill my car up with those random/unheard named gas stations/companies.

My first stop in vegas is Lees Liqours....this is my 2nd.

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^",W7ugM1NqQeB1Wj0DYE8TYw,1,2,5,k2GWhajTpEMeU0liPw0Q8w
