She was genuinely sweet and you could tell she enjoyed what she was doing, which is a gem these days. I was left with a very good impression an am already thinking about going back... Thanks AALIYAH! :))",Kh6AplQ7R8wDxn3W2uFZUQ,0,0,5,e0xafuqB2HEsMGpTrKCF1A
1832841,2010-07-10,0,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,"I remember my first visit to the Palms food court and Famous Famiglia Pizzeria was the only thing that looked appetizing.  I decided to try a slice of Mushroom & Spinach and a Spinach & Cheese stromboli.  I couldn't resist getting only one item, everything looked delicious.

The pizza slice was tasty, the crust was crispy, and all the ingredients tasted fresh.  The cheese was nicely melted and went great with their marinara sauce.  The pizza was great and the stromboli looked even better.  The stromboli was stuffed with spinach and cheese and was paired with a side of marinara.  The stromboli was piping hot and the cheese was gooey and tasted delicious with the spinach.  The dough was crispy, thick, and the texture was just right.  The combination of all the ingredients paired with the marinara dipping sauce made for one of the best stromboli's I've ever tried.

I highly suggest trying out this pizzeria if your visiting the Palms.  Every time I'm in Vegas, I make sure to stop by and get one of their stromboli's.  The food is a little greasy, but indulge, nevertheless.",BdV-cf3LScmb8kZ7iiBcMA,0,0,4,vKxIQn5VxM0rWAVaJhlyhA

We ran over to the food court which is about 23 feet from the theatres. I got the pepper and cheese which was the bomb of all pizza spices- after all I love a good thin crust- my husband got a pepperoni and he agreed it was great- and the garlic knots-5 scrumptious garlic soaked little devils. Could not finish them all so they made a great lunch today!!
Oh I am so thrilled we have them 1.4 miles away.
Pizza is great!!!!",hd-S4mtrPY9Q6iuBJegnOQ,4,5,5,_ICue88Z4YUEwQLdrzL-3g

It was nice to see that (being in a casino) the food was very reasonably priced.  The Large Pizza and double order of garlic knots was right around $20.  

The pizza had a crunchy crust, which I like and tasted great!  The garlic knots were delicious and loaded with garlic, which as an added bonus will deter vampires for the remainder of your vacation.",5yg-ro5TuVEaolPQdGXp1Q,1,1,4,pPHcncPiYcrYznvfKz2diw

4287361,2015-01-18,1,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,"MY FAVORITE PIE!!!!!

Seriously, this is the exact type of pizza I've been looking for!  The crust is perfect, the slices are large and thin, and the sauce is actually really good! A large cheese pie is 14.99! Not too bad considering it's in a casino, a plus for me is that I get dinning credits from the Palms so my pie was only 5.36! Woot!

I also tried the garlic knots which were 5 for 1.99, I didn't pay attention to see what they looked like at first, but once I got home and opened them theyre basically small bread knots... small though. Lol. not your typical knot! They were aight.

The pizza is def my fave so far, I been on the search for a pie like this and finally found one that wasn't 20+ dollars!

I will for sure be back, and will not even mind paying the full price! Also, the customer service here is awesome! The guys are both super nice and helpful!

Yay!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,1,2,5,wt8nOS1WMf5hp_i0mRtzCg
4491058,2011-05-30,0,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,I usually order the garlic knots here ...can't eat here without them. I was hesitant to order a meatball sandwich because I thought it might taste generic. I was so wrong ...it actually tasted better then most. The reason I liked it so much was because they toasted the whole sandwich. It wasn't like most places where the meatballs are hot and the bread is cold . It was really good! This may be my go to menu item from now on!,48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,1,0,4,bd8QBDjR7FBXNiJgHgTGOA
4729023,2014-10-19,0,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,I grew up and often survived on NY style pizza.  I spent about 4 years away from the NYC region and found myself spending a few months in Las Vegas.  During the first week or so there I was in The Palms putzing around in the casino.  Was hungry and just checked out the food court.  Thought I would give this place a shot.  I enjoyed the taste very much.  I don't know if it tasted better since I was deprived of NY pizza for several years or what.  I worked near The Palms during that time and for the rest of my stay in Vegas I probably hit this place once a week for lunch.,V4-LYhFm3Gj6tj2WtG4XWQ,0,0,4,mBSDkYUpliLASaCuOSDF1Q

5403458,2017-12-27,0,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,"I don't know what happened but the pizza isn't good like it use to be. This last time we had to bring back an entire pie that had been a carry out.

My son didn't see the pizza before taking it home. Once home we opened it to see a bright red cheese pizza! Someone had soaked the entire pie with some sort of red disgusting liquid. The pie was mushy & had grease & red stuff all over it.

We called & tried explaining what we were given for $18.00 bucks. We were told they don't normally do this but come back in tomorrow & will give you another 1. They then hung up on my son. He calls back & wants to know who he just spoke to, they said Mike the GM. So Mikes told that we will be in at 2 tomorrow. I called Mike at 12:45 & said I'm the guys mom who spoke to you last night about the pizza,would it be ok if I come around 3:30; my sons at work so I'll be in & Im bringing the old pizza with me.
I get to the Palms food court with pizza pie in hand. Then from there everything become more weird then the pizza itself. I ask for Mike! The girl in front hands me my redone pie. Mike comes out from the back & I tell him who I am, then hand him my original pizza pie. Told him he should check into how this pie got red & made my son sick. Mike proceeds to tell me that he never spoke to my son last night. Mike also says he doesn't know what I'm talking about. He though I had just ordered a carry out that was already paid for. So I then asked him so you have another employee that is impersonating you?
Needless to say, Mike stuck to his crazy story that he wasn't there last night, he didn't talk to my son last night, & that they had a new cook last night!
This entire Red Pizza Pie That Got is sick is a mystery & Mike is claiming he's innocent of anything & everything!
The truth & nothing but the truth is definitely lacking at FAMIGLIA PIZZERIA",NF6Ovz0ifW_Rdi4VL2ZrXQ,0,0,1,atACwigNeV0eNQ2qd_-aWQ
5848401,2013-02-19,1,jrWegacxD7lD1Cp-Kc5m2w,"While I was getting my tuna melt over at Earl of Sandwich, my boyfriend popped over here to pick up some grub.

He decided on the pepperoni stromboli and garlic knots. The food was ok also was a small portion and over priced of course considering is located in a casino food court. Even MC Donald's is 20% higher than the stand alone stores.

I tried a garlic knot and was not impressed, I much prefer those of villa pizza in which they are more of a true garlic knot.

My boyfriend was hungry not too long after so not a good vote from me on the food portion for the price ratio!

It was just ok however we will not be returning any time soon if at all. We can get so much more flavor and bang to the buck elsewhere.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,2,1,3,R4930WYcRlL3R4ZWotzVSQ
