The recent addition of Garrett to the staff has been amazing! He is warm, friendly, and genuinely cares about your experience. He will keep you coming back time and again! I would recommend calling to see when he is there. You will be happy you did!",LXzdKr04lcfSPpaMbDdoFQ,0,0,5,GLPFm4kW0x2aysQCZ49SjQ

We were very pleased with the service we got. Thanks again Garrett! We will be back soon.",lIriF75ALeG6Jp8JUDxfZg,0,0,5,7h4JYxSbqTZKSFN-aWbJWA
