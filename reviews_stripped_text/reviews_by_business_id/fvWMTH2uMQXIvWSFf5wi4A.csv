1634316,2014-02-18,4,fvWMTH2uMQXIvWSFf5wi4A,This BK is near my house and I get coupon booklets in the mail often. I wouldn't eat here as much if I didn't have the coupons. The burgers are fast food average and the veggies are usually fresh. The workers are nice but the wait time can be brutal often. I do like the cinnabon options they have I just don't like when they put in the box and bag upside down so that when I open it the frosting isn't everywhere but on the bun.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,7,7,3,hon8VpNBvibYBXAfe2SSyw

The drive-thru was totally full, but it took me less than 5 minutes to get through it with my food. The employees were all polite, but businesslike.

I've had to come here to use the internet for the last week, and they are SO incredibly nice, and always hustling. I can't vouch for the food still, because I'm gluten-free, but smelling everyone else's food is driving me crazy- it smells delicious. 

So as far as Burger Kings go, this one is pretty cool, and the improved staff has really turned things around.",_vvbaZI6JlE3uZIcFdT28A,1,0,4,1cgWVfkufHja8kBbrvKO8Q

I just went through the drive thru and they got my order RIGHT and it tasted GOOD!

This is a first for this location!

I only got a rodeo cheeseburger so maybe it was because I didn't make it too hard on them ?!?! ;)",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,3,2,3,xCqw5obQGzQs2kR4m5eXsA
3642863,2018-05-12,0,fvWMTH2uMQXIvWSFf5wi4A,I work for Doordash and I normally go through the drive thru for fast food orders as it's faster to get customers their food in a timely manor and to meet my delivery time. This was my first experience with this store. I went to the drive up speaker when I was greeted with laugher from a girl inside. My husband tells her we're here for a doordash order as we normally do for any other drive thru. She rudely tells us we have to go inside because the order isn't ready. About 5-7 min before our arrival we get a text that tells us that our order is ready for pick up. The restaurant is responsible for that text therefore implying the text was a lie. We arrived right at our pick up time on the nose when this happened. So my husband tells her it's weird we normally get our food in the drive thru is there anyway to get it this way because we had a car behind us and in front of us and had no way to park and go inside. She said nothing so we pulled up to the window. This girl literally ignored us at the window. She gave us dirty looks acknowledging we were there but wouldn't say a word. So he goes in because at this point he doesn't have a choice and the bag is completely sealed with stickers making it impossible to tell whether or not the order is correct. It is part of our checklist on our app to check off that every item is inside before we leave with it. He doesn't argue with them because it would make us later than we were. Of course all of these antics make us late for our delivery and we get blamed for being late. I hope someone higher up sees this and deals with these child like employees. If not I will be calling myself as this is effecting my way of living.,3HTR_vD3uzxjJN7luO_tBw,0,0,1,biFCIXuRAshXpPXZZ3ycQw

I decided to hop the bandwagon and tried the mac n' cheetos. I thought it was good. It was definitely shaped with a cheeto puff. The outside was crispy and the inside was filled with gooey mac n cheese. The portion (5 pieces) was perfect because the food can get taste greasy fast. I would recommend it with ketchup (I know weird, but really really good!). Also, I ordered the cheeseburger kids meal which came with a cheeseburger, small fries, apple juice caprisun, and a toy. I'm a little old for a kids meal, but the portion is great. When I went, the toys were characters from The Penguins of Madagascar! I'd rather get this meal with a variety of foods than a giant burger. Plus it was only $3.79! I was a little upset when I saw the portion of the meat in the burger. It was itty bitty and more like I was eating bread. But it wasn't bad. This meal was my childhood and it was great to reminisce the pit stops to my local Burger King. I would pick Burger King over McDonald any day (except the soft serve ice cream lol)!",nRicr5sDYwpDUM9s2bjS4w,1,1,5,sfUuj5hs_f0-kwXj7eh0pQ

The staff is always friendly, and they've never, ever gotten my order wrong. Of course, I don't really ask for much...my diet consists of meat, cheese, and coffee these days. But most fast food joints still manage to screw that up, somehow. Not this BK. Which is nice, considering there aren't many other places to eat around here, so it's my favorite go-to on the days I'm too lazy (or sleep in too long) to pack my own lunch.",fiAoyQHLa9Mz8QvsXzqVzw,2,2,4,x3YxMOQO-gZHiaXie0AQRQ

I don't expect much, I mean it's not Le Cordon Bleu but it's not rocket science either. I go out of my way to avoid fast food but had time constraints on my visits so had no alternative. 

The last guy at the window was in a spectacular mood. So much so that I was prompted to ask him if he was medicated and if so, to give me his doctor's phone number. He laughed and said he loves his job. Wrap your mind around that. He amused me for the rest of my time in the Gulag that pays my bills. He got my order right for a change so I was pleased.",zwo4S612wfakZodLQ8aMIQ,1,1,2,YJ1I9eBke_bdiG6LdlmPFw

I expect it to be made to order correctly....MY WAY. This BK location has a problem with this philosophy. My largish order was half missing... and the half that was in the bag had 3 items that were not what I ordered. I worked in fast food at 14yrs of age...first thing I learned was expediting and how important putting out a correct product was.,IKLQx0GzJ2ITSz8rcVAc_w,1,0,1,JqzL5p1iNvdoFWR0Oozsdw

While the owner/manager dude was having a meeting with his employees in the dining area his other employees behind the counter were fumbling service and taking their sweet time.  It was as if they were moving through a pool of jello and they seemed confused like a child at a magicians show.  Meanwhile the owner barked at his employees who all had a glazed look of horror on their faces as they realized they had made a huge mistake by getting hired here.  As I left I turned my head towards the meeting and stated ""burger king sucks"".  I'm not sorry for it.  I meant it.  This place sucks. .  You might get your food faster if you dig in the trash.
