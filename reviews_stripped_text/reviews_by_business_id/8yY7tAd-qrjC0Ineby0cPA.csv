5225,2012-09-30,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,Had a Groupon for $20- for $40- of food.  We arrived in Vegas pretty late around 9:00 pm and did not get to the restaurant until 10:00 pm on a Wednesday ( 09-19-12) .  No one in the restaurant and a just a couple of people in the bar.  At first we were not sure as it was in a small strip mall about two blocks from The Palms on Flamingo not great looking but don't let the rest of the strip mall  fool you ... the insideof the restaurant is really nice.  Lots of booths too.  Our waitress was really super nice and told us about the favorites.  She started with the Brussell Sprouts .... you must try them !  OMG ... so good.  They bake or fry them and they are like chips in a way and so addicting !  The Empanadas were delicious too !  Everything we had was so good ... worth going to.  Next trip to Vegas we are definitely going back to Marabella !!!,CJkmX1CyGiFcAo5zqyQ2lw,0,0,5,BVtNhQ9NVIux4zLtm3FjMA

Our favorite dishes were the Brussel Sprouts, Chicken Kabob, Patatas Bravas and Serrano Ham Plate, but the Crispy Chicken, Mini Taquitos, and Fish Tacos were also excellent and more than we could finish.  
Service in the bar was good, but even the waitress from the dining room came by to speak with us as did the owners.  We particularly enjoyed the fabulous Flamenco guitarist, Ricardo Griego.  
Altogether, this was a satisfying and enjoyable evening.  We will return!",w9IMrPq47-Y2mPtqLTYr6A,2,0,5,1T1ANe_6OMGJ1STBLyaDsQ

Don't be afraid to try anything. Some of the seemingly most unusual choices were the best in my opinion: The cauliflower is a tasty side dish, I loved the Lamb Sliders, and I enjoyed the creamy thickness of the yogurt and cucumbers, too. We liked everything we tried, including the desserts.

It is so refreshing to get off the Strip and find a good place, and Marbella should be on your list. It's in a great location on Flamingo (so, not far from everything). This should be the recharge place for locals after partying on the Strip or visitors who are tired of the noise and crowds. And, I cannot believe the kitchen is open until 3 am. Try it! -easy parking or a short cab ride.",qis5D5R-78zMiAG_sx7DPA,2,0,5,EYDcU2nF02H8TXcBBQOYAA

The food was pretty delicious. Don't remember much but think we had chorizo, tacos, tilapia, chicken skewers, grilled veggies, cheesecake and their sangria. The mood was nice...soft band in the background, booths were spacious, the lights were little too dark though but i dont know if its just my eyes that suck. But what sealed the deal was our waitress; she was so kind and cheerful that it made the experience perfect. I don't remember her name though.",yXzoaRfyU8c14FutmrbR7g,0,0,5,tLt5uuYJMyBlcuk7ZSYPRQ

Her knowledge of the menu and friendly table manor made our visit very enjoyable.  We tried many tapas with the short ribs and filet mignon our favorite.  They have an excellent salad as well as Armenian rice served with the kabobs.  The cheesecake is a must try.  Will definitely be back again.

Until were were served our first plate, shrimp ceviche....and my friend got a hold of a pepper and was left without water for over 10 minutes.  The ceviche was OK...the chorizo stuffed mushrooms were great as were the lamb sliders.  My only complaint is the waiter, he was a bit inattentive.  The restaurant wasn't busy and the couple across the way had excellent service from their waitress.  Maybe our guy was having a back night.  I'd eat there again, with a groupon or other deal...I wouldn't pay full price unless I was sure the service was a one off.",GDwl-xEPkgXQSN2DIIkYBw,0,0,3,5SQg3q-jaAc3cy9UfG0hsA

I figured it would be low rent since the deal was so cheap.  Boy was I wrong!!  The food was amazing!  Manchego mac n' cheese is awesome along with the calamari.

531197,2013-04-10,3,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"I simply love tapas.  I spent a year in Spain a couple of decades ago and fell in love with the food.  Unfortunately, Julian Serrano and Jaleo, although both superb, are far beyond my budget.  I was drawn to Marbella because their website is polished and very well done, and their menu prices quite reasonable.

Since I was starving when I arrived, I was happy to be seated immediately.  Because I was so hungry, I ordered a lot of different items.  And oh boy, they were all bad.  1) Patatas bravas:  potatoes looked and tasted like they had been fried early that morning then reheated, and the sauce tasted like mayo from a jar mixed with spaghetti sauce from a jar.  2) Marbella french fries: with Reggiano and black truffle oil, they sound amazing. Unfortunately, they taste like crap.  Mediocre fries, no taste of black truffle oil, and maybe three flecks of parmesan cheese, doubtful it was Reggiano.  3) Fried calamari: frozen food thrown into a deep fryer + sauce from some jar.  4) Paella de marisco: the Goya boxed paella tastes better, and I wish I were exaggerating.  Fishy, greasy, not a hint of saffron - the dish is a total disaster.  If this is authentic paella, then I'm the Prime Minister of Spain.  5) Cheese and chorizo appetizers: not good, but unlike everything else, not horrible.  Because I was so hungry and this was the only half-palatable item on the menu, I ended up getting another order.  6) Gambas al ajillo: this dish is so simple that anybody can make it well.  Except Marbella.  

Despite my voracious sweet tooth, I didn't bother with dessert because I figured it would be as bad as the rest of the menu.  Now I've learned my lesson.  Either cough up the big bucks for quality, or buy a Spanish cookbook and learn to make tapas myself.  But there's no way you'll get good tapas at Marbella.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,3,0,1,g-WOdafPg6E2riWb5xHw3g
581744,2013-03-29,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"We went on Restaurant Week.  This was a 3 course meal for $30 which was a great value.  I was pleased to see that the regular menu prices are very affordable as well.  We started with an app of brussell sprouts.  It might sound like an odd appetizer but they were delicious - individual leaves flash fried and served with a vinegar based sauce.  I would pay money to get the recipe.  Followed with an entree of lamb chops for me and filet mignon for my friend.  Entrees included a small salad and rice.  Everything was perfectly prepared and very tasty.  I had the coconut flan for dessert and I thought it was quite good.  The main dining room is elegant.  The service was spot on.  There was a classical guitarist which lended just the right touch to the Mediterranean ambiance.  They have a happy hour and also a hookah room.

I am a little confused what type of cuisine is this.  It's more Mexican than Spanish after tasting the food. 
Food and Drink Critics:
The SANGRIA is very different taste from real Spain Sangria that I have ever tasted in Spain, but not too bad.  It has its own unique characters.
SHRIMP CEVICHE
The cilantro in  this dish was a bit too strong which makes it more southern America style.   The fried banana was not salted evenly.   
FRIED CALAMARI was hot but greasy and soggy.  Ranch sauce was too runny and not cold enough.  
FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS was too greasy and not fried evenly. 
PAELLA DE MARISCO was overpowering with red pepper.   The burned taste of the red pepper took over the whole dish.  The flavor of the seafood was did not came out in this dish at all.  The seafood was probably put into the oven and cooked at the same time with the rest of the dish.  As the result of the main concept of the seafood didn't come out as nicey as it should have been in compares to the real Spanish ones.  The rice was more like a undercooked risotto the. The real Spanish rice.
TORTA DE CHOCOLATE
If you like bitter choloclate, you may like this desert.  The combination between the hot cake top with a scoop of venilla ice cream with some fresh fruit was  a balance taste to it.  However, I am not a huge coconut fan, somehow, this desert reminded me of a German chocolate cake was a bit of a minus point for me.   

STAFF SERVICE:
The service at this establishment was outstanding.  The staff was attentive and patienly asking for our opinions.  We gave the above critisim to them and they promise to bring our critisim to their chef.  

AMBIANCE:
There was a life music performance playing in the background.  It can be a real fun place to be for a group party or a dating choice.  This place has nice dining area and a bar area with high chairs with tv.    

OVERALL
I enjoy this relaxing nicely decorated place like this.  In terms of food, I  am a bit critical.  I would give them a second chance to see how different it is on a more busy day.  Perhaps, the back of the house has a different chef or the cooking technique may improve.  I will give them a benenfit of doubt after my first viist.  I was here on a Thursday evening about 6:45.  The restaruant wasn't busy that night at all.  Total setting of the guests did not exceed more than 15 guests.

I came here with a $30 for $15 deal from Groupon and if I was actually spending the listed price on the menu, I would definitely not be satisfied.  Since my meal was basically half off, I would say that the food was okay and well worth it, but I would not spend more than that. 

I ordered in total about 6 dishes worth $90 that I paid $45 dollars for, and out of all of them I only liked the calamari.  Every other dish was either meatless, tasteless, or overcooked. 

The restaurant was absolutely stunning and nicely decorated.  The lights were dim and perfect for a date, if the food was better.

(Saturday night) Our son has just started learning Spanish and we thought it would be fun and a good way for him to engage in the language. The restaurant is beautiful and authentic looking but nobody is from Spain :0( they had a guy playing the piano, fresh flowers and the staff were lovely and welcoming but they couldn't speak Spanish. We started in the bar with a pitcher of their Sangria which was fantastic, its our first time at a Tapas Bar so we didn't really know what to expect or order, anyway we asked for some help and the server was helpful, we  tried a mix of stuff, everything was really really good, fresh and full of flavor. We had the seafood Paella which was very nice,  but nothing like what we have had in Spain. We are from Europe and in our opinion this is more like a Mexican restaurant than Spanish, but in saying that we still enjoyed the food as it was very tasty. 

The customer service was excellent, we met the owner Rosa and the Chef, they were all very friendly, the poor waiter who we bugged all night with iHolas that only got louder as we got down to the bottom of the pitcher!

993058,2011-11-01,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"My experience at Marbella was for their VIP tasting event.  Great service, yummy sangria, but the food....  I gotta say, I wasn't impressed.  Yes, they only served about 7 different dishes, so maybe I just got tired of seeing the same plates passed around.  Then again, there are tapas restaurants where I could literally eat 4 orders of the same item and be in Heaven.  

Marbella, not so much.  

Don't get me wrong, there were some good points.  The decor is clean, open and inviting.  The bar was lively and fun.  The staff were all on their best behavior.  Not to mention, the sangria was some of the best I've had.  But, for me, I go to a restaurant for the food.  At the end of the day, that's what it's all about.  So if the food doesn't knock my socks off, then I won't consider it next time around.  

I do have to give Marbella props, though.  They seemed very open to receiving input from patrons.  They handed out a take-home menu to everyone, and emphasized that the menu will evolve as time goes on.  I would've given them my honest opinion about the food, but I was at a table with 5 acquaintances and really didn't feel like getting into it.  That's why I'm on Yelp now, so hopefully Marbella is reading this.

Out of the menu items I tried, I do have to compliment them on the empanadas and the... the fried thing with cheese.  Man, I forget the name now.  Oh, and the chorizo thing that looked like a bagel bite: that was good. The chicken lollipops were okay for my taste, but about half my table didn't like them.  Other than that, nothing else stood out.  

So with a 50% success rate on the food, I might give it another shot in the future.  I'm interested to see how the restaurant progresses.",NWum9pk6P0UPm5TbTEanGQ,6,1,2,hfAoKdowx_RThiCBMjwSHw
1036349,2013-03-28,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"Ok, it was my fault for not checking the happy hour menu on yelp. It was completely empty at 6pm for happy hour in the bar on a weekday. They were out of blue moon and out of stella artois. Sheesh, what kind of bar are these people running? Opted for water instead. Ordered every dish on the happy hour menu except for the quesadilla. Portions seemed itty bitty, unless I was just super hungry that day or it was so dark in there I couldn't see the other half of my plate. The best thing was the steak tostadas which had a sweet red cabbage slaw with it. The potatoes were good too, but they were just roasted potatoes with spices and sour cream, hm... was potato really worth $4? 
For not having that many customers, there was 1 other table in the bar area and 1 table in the regular restaurant area, service was S...L.... O...W. 

I overheard the other table and you can not combine a groupon or living social coupon with happy hour specials. It's one or the other discount.

1274383,2013-02-13,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"A friend of mine and I went to the restaurant tonight.  When my guest and I arrived, there were a number of dining tables open (at least five).  The host at the front (which is also the owner) asked if we could wait at the bar about 10 minutes before getting seated.  She also suggested that we grab a cocktail.  We thought it was awkward considering there were open tables.  Nonetheless, it wasn't a problem as we were easy and didn't mind waiting that long for a table.  

Twenty five minutes later, we were still waiting at the bar for a table.  (There were still open tables!!!)  The hostess / owner had passed us twice with no updates.  Another family that had come in after us was seated before we were as well.  To give you an idea of our experience, my friend and I felt like we were waiting outside of the club trying to get in.  It was worse than trying to get in at Marquee.  My guest and I were frustrated and left.  Unfortunately I'll never come back.

The bartenders were awesome I have to say... we ordered pitchers of red sangria and he was nice enough to bring us samples of white.  They make the sangria in house so at least it's not from a bottle.  The food was good... more greek influences than Spanish.

First time we had a waiter named Rasberry who had to be one of the least attentitive waiters we have ever had.

Took time to explain and recommend. We tried the empanadas and brussels, both excellent. Also had the cevich was was prety good, and a few skewers.The rice dish served as a side is excellent. I think the only thing we did not care for was the salad that comes with some meals. Th dressing is kind of bitter/tangy and there is something else in their we did not like, some spice.

1721286,2012-11-28,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"I've been wanting to try this restaurant since i saw the chef do a cooking demonstration at Whole Foods, which included Shrimp Ceviche and Manchego Mac & Cheese.  Both were delicious.

I came here on a Tuesday night around 6:30. There were about 8 people in the entire restaurant, which is large and elegantly decorated.  We were seated immediately by the hostess.  

Once we sat, the waiter introduced himself and asked if we wanted a drink.  I ordered Cava and my husband a glass of red wine.  The selection by the glass was simple but well thought out.  According to the waiter there was some ""technical difficulties"" with our drinks.  I am not quite sure since there were only eight people in the entire restaurant and should not be hard for a bartender to pop a cork or to use a corkscrew. Nonetheless, we got our drinks after our first tapa.

I like the format of the menu, offering small, medium, and large plates, which cost $6, $9, and $16 respectively.  The price points encourage diners to try several dishes, but if you are not the mood to share most of the medium plates are sizeable enough to be a single persons meal.  In addition, the menu offers charcuterie platters and paella.   

The first several tapas started off promising, but my husband and I both felt the beef dishes were over cooked, using tough (cheap) meat, and even came out cold.  The chorizo and cheese empanadas were good, but hey, anything fried is good, however, not very ""chorizoey"".  The beef tacos were OK... little dry and bland, a dish I would pass on next time if I ever go back.  The Gambas al Ajillo was probably the best dish, but white shrimp does lack flavor and overall there was no heat to the dish despite chili oil in the ingredient.  The steak kabobs either was missing or didn't have enough red wine demi to counteract the dry, chewiness of the meat.   The carne asada salad was a decent portion, but again the meat with dry and chewy, Luckily, I had the dressing to add moisture.

According to the chef during the Whole Food demonstration, the desserts were made in-house, so my husband ordered the coconut flan.  My husband said it was, ""superb"", so I had a bite...it was definitely well made and definitely the highlight of the meal.


Will I go back, probably not.  However, in all fairness,  I do think there were so many more ""signature"" dishes I didn't try, which could have potentially swayed me to feel differently.  Some other reviewers are comparing Marbella to Firefly's, which I don't think it is a equal comparison, but if you think it is, Marbella has won that comparison hands down.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,0,0,3,GblpGtCmBBJG_OQtkVJL9w

The prices are also a tad out of whack. For example, the Chorizo / Filet stuffed Mushrooms are a ""medium plate"" and cost $9.00, but what you get are three mushrooms smaller than a golf ball.

I had also received a special 2-for-1 promotion via text message from the restaurant, so it seemed like an ideal time to check out Vegas's newest tapas bar.

I'm not sure why the bar was almost empty, as my $5 mojito was a delicious deal during happy hour, with plenty of fresh lime and mint flavor. We ordered a few items off the happy hour menu, in addition to calamari and mixed ceviche off the regular tapas menu. For a tapas concept, the size of the plates seemed rather confused. The fried calamari was a large plate, comparable to an order in any other restaurant. It looked odd next to the ceviche, which was served on a small plate about the same size as the cup of sauce served with the calamari. My husband, the ceviche connoisseur, thought the ceviche could use just a touch more spice, but was pleased overall. The coca vegetariana was a new dish for me. This Spanish-style pizza came topped with plenty of mushrooms and was the best Happy Hour tapa I tried. I was disappointed by the traditional tortilla española, an essential dish for judging the authenticity of any tapas bar. This one was bland and a bit dry, and the texture of the potatoes and onions was lost.

Marbella is as good or better than any off-Strip tapas joint in terms of food quality, and the prices make it very accessible. The atmosphere is upscale and has more Spanish flair to it, with flamenco music and a menu that's trying to be more authentic than Firefly. I really appreciate the focus on the music and touches of Spanish culture. The happy hour is definitely worth checking out, but I feel that I may not have sampled the best dishes they have to offer.

My concerns about it:
1. The kitchen was closed, and I know for the fact that some people did not stay there because of it...
2. I had a ""sangria"" ;) which the bartender literally made in front of me (some wine, juice really quick, soda and fruits on top). ""Fireflys"" lets the wine to absorb fruits for 5 days, before they serve it to customers. So the flavor comes out, this is the whole point...Just saying :)

Huevos Estrallados (2 over medium eggs on chorizo string fries)
Chorizo and Filet stuffed mushrooms
Hummus with Tahini served with pita chips
Smoked Tuna Sashimi

The prices during happy hour are amazing.  For regular costs it's small plates for $6, medium plates for $9 and large plates for $16.  We didn't have any large plates but the small and medium were well portioned.  

The Huevos Estrallados were TO DIE FOR.  I wish I had some right now.  The hummus was very yummy, smooth and garlic-y.  Tuna delicious and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms were lovely though you only get 3 which I thought was a little lite.

Chef Beltran is great, the GM is very courteous, the music hits the spot, the food is unique and satisfying, the restaurant is beautiful,what else can you ask for?  

Do yourself a favor and order the boneless baby back ribs.  I didn't even realize it was boneless when I ordered this, and I didn't even realize it when the ribs actually came to the table, because they were all intact.  What a pleasant surprise when you put your fork in it.  Delicious barbeque without the mess so you don't have to embarrass yourself by your date!

The other winners were the fatoush salads (a nice middle eastern complement to the Spanish cuisine) calamari, manchego mac n cheese, lamb sliders, but... the second best dish (after the ribs of course) was the Ahi Tuna Daurade.  Different take on ahi tuna, due to it's peppery crust.  Perfection.

Desert, I would go with coconut flan.  All made from scratch deserts, like everything else on the menu.  Chef Beltran is the man, not only a wonderful chef to talk with, but a wonderful different take on Spanish tapas.  Loving the middle eastern influence in his dishes.

Walked in and saw that it was busy! Couples everywhere, if you're one of those couples that like to make fun of the lovey dovey stuff that others do, then this is your place to be a creeper. The environment is definitely not somewhere I would eat with my dad, especially if they have instrumentals of love making songs playing. Waiting a few minutes at the hostess stand was not a big deal, it either meant they were busy touching tables... or inattentive. 

During my experience I had to wait less than 10 minutes on a Friday night for a table, not bad! The food was ""okay"", definitely did not experience any stand outs and the same applies to the Sangria. The poor service was the predominate flavor of the night. Had asked if we could upgrade the fries on the Ahi Tuna (way over seasoned and overcooked) to the Marbella fries, which we received an okay for, but alas did not happen. The ceviche did not blow any minds, edible, and a decent portion size. I'm glad that I had a LivingSocial, because if I had paid full price for what they serve as paella I would be devastated. A few other dishes were ordered, but they slip my mind.

I did not see my server too often, only when she brought the menus, when she saw I didn't get the fries, promotion, and bill time. Sometime during dinner the we were informed of a Facebook promotion they had, which we had an option of getting a small plate, sangria or a desert. The bill however  showed a Facebook promotion line, but had a $0 value, thus being charged for the dessert. The server didn't believe me when I had told them they charged me, but after a few minutes, it was corrected.

The food was fantastic! We ordered the shrimp ceviche, lamb sliders, shrimp kabobs, and Brussel sprouts (which were the best I ever had). We then decided to order two more items to complete the groupon. She ordered the Greek salad without feta (she's allergic) and I ordered the calamari. The salad came out with small bits of feta on it, so I decided to just take that home. After another 15 minutes of waiting, I asked our waitress to just wrap up the calamari to take home as well. I got home and was excited to have a piece or two of the calamari- open the box and its a melty chocolate ice cream mess. Specifically didn't ask for dessert, and now I am craving calamari :-(

Great food, but unfortunately the service left something to be desired.",2hC_n_CezRLjd7T3G82KIA,1,0,2,Dl5mye2gjJ2jOpPSh2Kbhg

Fried Calamari - $9
Ahi Tuna Daurade - $16
2 Beef Tacos - $6
Lamb Beef Sliders - $9

In total, the food was $40, which was perfect as I had purchased a $20 for $40 Groupon before arriving.  I had the ahi tuna last time, and I think I'll order this dish every time I dine here.  It is simply the perfect ahi tuna.  Good size, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Honestly, it's a steal at $16.  The other dishes were delicious as well, with the jalepenos in the calamari a nice surprise, as were the sweet potato fries that came with the sliders.

But the 5* experience really came from the bartender Ryan.  My buddy Tim had originally asked our server about the Riesling wines, and he didn't know the answer, so Ryan came over to chat with us.  He let Tim try two different Rieslings, and they discussed the merits of each.  When he settled on which one to get, Ryan returned with not only a glass of wine but two samplers of their sangria, the red and the white. As we ate we chatted a bit more with Ryan about scotches and specialty cocktails, and we'll definitely be coming back in to see what Ryan is capable of.",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,15,11,5,oNZHrtM3ANVv7lB01Aru4w

After an enjoyable and rather wild Elite event, my wife and I decided to return for late-night happy hour tapas and sangria. The sangria, served in a wine decanter, doesn't come close to Firefly's but it gets the job done. It could be improved by adding lots of fresh fruit in the decanter instead of the small bit they put in the glass.

The food was hit-or-miss. The chorizo empanadas were delicious, the shrimp ceviche was, well, shrimp ceviche. The gambas al ajillo was enjoyable but not as much as its Firefly counterpart. By far the biggest disappointment was the Marbella fries. They sound incredibly flavorful on the menu's description, but the actual product is a huge letdown. Perhaps it was because it was so late at night, or they had run out of fresh potatoes, but the fries were obviously a store-bought, frozen product with the barest amount of truffle oil and cheese added.

Marbella is off to a good start. With some tweaks to the drinks and the food it can be a great neighborhood tapas bar.",ITNVSsPgUIWOwgKMSqwZ2w,2,1,3,Z0ktEXC2jeQjsRmqoZZGpQ

4094656,2012-12-15,1,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"First time here and I was really surprised to find such an elegant restaurant inside this strip mall. I hear this was the old Ruth Chris's and I can see that. 

We were greeted by several staff passing by the hostess stand and when the hostess came back, she took us to our table. It was a booth, I like booths.

Our sever was named Dominic, and I have to say he was awesome. Informative, honest, friendly but professional. We pretty much ordered all the popular menu items he suggested. 
Small plates: 
Brussel sprouts which is not the typical cut in half and sautéed, it was fried Brussel sprout leaves tossed with a vinaigrette. It was good and different. 
Cauliflower with garbanzo, cashews and cabbage. Definitely something I can make at home but it was one of those simple dishes you can appreciate. 
French fries... Because it's Regina's favorite. There was supposed to be truffle oil but I didn't really smell too much of it, but I am a little sick and stuffed up..
Medium dishes
Ribs are cooked 6 days and it becomes so tender, the meat falls off the bone, so they serve it boneless. It was tasty and a good portion for the price I think.
Gambas was the other medium dish, which was ok. I was expecting the shrimp to be prawns. The sauce was like a buttery lemon sauce but nothing exciting. Maybe if there was actually spice in the sauce, instead of a chili for decoration, I would have liked it more.
Dessert
Chocolate torta came with banana ice cream and walnuts. The menu said vanilla but I actually liked the banana better. You don't get banana at too many places which makes made me think they made it themselves. The chocolate cake was warm and kind of gooey but I like mine oozing out. This was more like a warm cake with a soft center. 

I would definitely come back, and I would look for Dominic the server/bartender. Also, I want to check out their happy hour.",vxR_YV0atFxIxfOnF9uHjQ,5,3,4,yn9am8_GQnkX3rrViH0NQQ
4191688,2013-04-06,0,8yY7tAd-qrjC0Ineby0cPA,"We've been 3 times to Marbella in the last 2 months. Mainly because it's less than a mile from home & they are open late. And we are looking for an alternative to the other tapas place that has become way too popular. 
The good: 
prices are decent, service is attentive & the food is decent. Since we don't eat seafood I cannot speak for that but the chicken/steak skewers were tender & fall off the stick ; the cucumber/yogurt/jalepeno dip was smooth & creamy though for me I would have liked more cucumber/jalepeno & less yogurt but that's just me. We also had the empanadas (tasty but the crust was a little dry)  the boneless baby backs (must have) & the lamb sliders. Our last visit we ventured to the large plate selection with the tequila chicken & lamb chops. Excellent choices. Very attentive staff that kept the plates on pace. I would have liked a better variety in the small plates & dessert but as they get more popular perhaps they will expand the menu.

The Bad: Their ""homemade"" sangria tasted, to the 3 of us, like it was poured from a bottle and sprite added. Also their bar seating is not comfortable. They only have high top tables or very low to the ground tables. 

the Ugly: I have to mention their website. 1st, its in flash so it eliminates iphone/ipad uses. 2nd it is dark so it is hard to read - thankfully they do have the full menu in pdf format. 

Why you should go: 
Happy hour! In the bar. The mixologist is awesome. For example, my son who is still trying to find his signature drink, told him he likes the flavors of orange & vanilla & spicy - and out came a shot with all of them. The prices are really good and there is a bar only menu that rocks. 

They do have entertainment. Out of the 3 times we went 2 of them had live music. not blaring speakers that deafen you but classic flamenco giving a moment that you could actually feel you weren't in a strip mall in Las Vegas. 

3 people 3 times: the constants were the cocktails (minus the sangria) the service & the quality of food. Our average bill with 2 rounds  of cocktails & tip was about 120.00

GREAT place to stop after a night out, and they do have decent seating for groups of 8+",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,2,1,4,f8mMNChvz9Fz22qjT01Duw

We sampled a variety of tapas: brussel sprouts, crab, chicken skewers, shrimp ceviche, empanadas, and a choice of beverage (I chose the red sangria).

My favorites were the brussel sprouts, chicken skewers, and empanadas. I couldn't believe how quickly the food came out. The staff and servers made sure that the guests were served. There was definitely plenty to go around! I typically don't like brussel sprouts, but it was super tasty and delicate.. definitely not the average brussel sprouts. The chicken skewers were also delicious, and I really liked the marinade that they used to cook it with. I think the empanadas were the winners though.. they disappeared so quick! 

Because the event consisted of a very large group of people, it was rather loud and kinda crowded. I'm guessing that on a non-event night, the venue is a bit more calm. There is definitely a relaxing and romantic vibe to the place :) The servers were very nice and accommodating, considering the fact that they were probably expecting a smaller amount of people for the event.

Our food came out pretty late and wasn't flowing like tapas normally does. We got the fries and the noodles first, then waited 15 minutes for the peppers... Then waited 15 minutes for the macaroni. Think, though, that we have a table of 4. The ceviche wasn't too great and the food appeared to have been waiting for a while when we got it.  The guac with the fish tacos had started to brown a little. 

We didn't even get two of our items. And it took another 15 minutes to get that written off our tab, then to get the check. And we had to ask 4 times...

I'd really like to give this place another shot. But the service might have killed it for me.

Oh, and regardless of the amount of customers, please don't make excuses. There were other tables looking around for servers and the party didn't have any servers in there either.

I saw this beautiful girl here. I can't get her out of my mind, WOW! I think about the girl all the time, wow wow!

The problem was I had a girlfriend at the time. Who's now an ex of mine. She used to wear all these short skirts that really attracted me. The problem was the girl from Marbella was more attractive and all she wore was t-shirts.

I knew this because when I played football, I'd look back and pretend to wave at my girlfriend, who was a cheerleader. But really, I'd look past her and see the girl from Marbella on the bleachers.

I've been trying to find love but I realized, that what I was looking for has been there the whole time.

I now see, and she's the one that understands me. She's been there all along. I finally see. I belong with her. I belong with her.

So I left my girlfriend and dated the girl from Marbella. We were walking in the streets. This is embarrassing to say, but I was wearing worn-out jeans. I looked into her eyes, and I couldn't help myself and told her this is how it ought to be. We laughed on the park bench and I thought to myself, ""Hey isn't this easy...""

Anyways, if it wasn't for Marbella I would have never had dated Taylor Swift. I highly recommend it here.

I'm so excited for the Re-grand-opening. This Sunday, I'm stoked.

They peel the leaves off and bake them like kale chips...so good!! We also had the shrimp ceviche which was good...just the right amount of spice. I had the mac n cheese, which was pretty good. I think I'm spoiled by my own recipe. My husband had the beef skewers, which he said were good.

Inside, sitting at the bar, I felt like I was in my own version of Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. 

The positives:
- Open super-late

- Hookah, baby

- The location gave us a chance to get off the strip and thus, it had a great chill vibe - more laid back, more locals, and less tourist poseurs like myself for me to deal with

- We ordered food and drinks and the bartender bent over backwards to make us happy, he was very personable and smiling and made us feel welcomed, which can be rare in Vegas these days since service has become more impersonal and the goal is to efficiently process as many people through as possible

- The DJ was good and there was no cover, easy to chill at the bar, drink eat and listen to jams, no crowds pushing up behind you

Now for the bad, only one. Some of the food tasted microwaved, like it was cooked early but re-heated in a microwave.  It reminded me of the chicken burrito scene from the movie Battleship.  Somewhat understandable since it was after 2 am and no one else was ordering food.

Food and Beverage: The barman was nice enough to let me try both the white and red sangria before making my decision, but I am saddened to say neither was anything to write home about.

The pepper was sweet and soft, the crab was salty and smooth and the drizzle of sauce lent a spicy punch to top it off. The fresh ceviche was served on a tostilla round and was swooped up quickly! The chicken kabobs were generously seasoned in Mediterranean spices and the meat was surprisingly juicy. My favorite of the night would have to be the empenadas!

A lot of Yelpers recommended the ribs but ""dammit it if I am getting that here!"" I said to myself!  I should've done that instead of the ""chorizo and filet stuffed mushrooms"" which were awful.  3 pieces for a retail price of $9 and it tasted like they stuffed the mushrooms with Slim Jims.  While that may sound tasty to someone who just ripped 3 hits from a bong, I wasn't down with that today.  

Aside from that, everything else was meh to average.  The shrimp kabobs were a hearty portion compared to other plates so I would recommend that.  But if you're actually paying $9 for it, Shish Kabob House is right up the street and you'd get a huge meal for $1 more.

The cheese and chorizo empanadas were a one and done for me.  It tasted like a below average taco sealed shut.  The boquerones which had hard boiled egg tartar, peppers, anchovies on a baguette would've been better if the bread were fresh.  The paella had a good amount of veggies and seafood in it but the sauce tasted like tomato paste out of a can.  It was very, very ketchup like. 

The best part was actually the chocolate torta with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  

The staff was friendly and attentive and I liked the piano man singing that night.  It made for some nice ambiance.  I would consider going back but just for happy hour.

The SANGRIA is very different taste from real Spain Sangria that I have ever tasted in Spain, but not too bad.  It has its own unique characters.
SHRIMP CEVICHE
The cilantro in  this dish was a bit too strong which makes it more southern America style.   The fried banana was not salted evenly.   
FRIED CALAMARI was hot but greasy and soggy.  Ranch sauce was too runny and not cold enough.  
FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS was too greasy and not fried evenly. 
PAELLA DE MARISCO was overpowering with red pepper.   The burned taste of the red pepper took over the whole dish.  The flavor of the seafood was did not came out in this dish at all.  The seafood was probably put into the oven and cooked at the same time with the rest of the dish.  As the result of the main concept of the seafood didn't come out as nicey as it should have been in compares to the real Spanish ones.  The rice was more like a undercooked risotto the. The real Spanish rice.
TORTA DE CHOCOLATE
If you like bitter choloclate, you may like this desert.  The combination between the hot cake top with a scoop of venilla ice cream with some fresh fruit was  a balance taste to it.  However, I am not a huge coconut fan, somehow, this desert reminded me of a German chocolate cake was a bit of a minus point for me.   

STAFF SERVICE:
The service at this establishment was outstanding.  The staff was attentive and patienly asking for our opinions.  We gave the above critisim to them and they promise to bring our critisim to their chef.  

AMBIANCE:
There was a life music performance playing in the background.  It can be a real fun place to be for a group party or a dating choice.  This place has nice dining area and a bar area with high chairs with tv.    

OVERALL
I enjoy this relaxing nicely decorated place like this.  In terms of food, I  am a bit critical.  I would give them a second chance to see how different it is on a more busy day.  Perhaps, the back of the house has a different chef or the cooking technique may improve.  I will give them a benenfit of doubt after my first viist.  I was here on a Thursday evening about 6:45.  The restaruant wasn't busy that night at all.  Total setting of the guests did not exceed more than 15 guests.

Not sure how else to explain it.. and it didn't seem very up there, I guess. I don't know. After awhile, we got the hang of our server, though. He was friendly :). It was just a bit awkward in the beginning, haha. Another server tried to take our unfinished dishes away after we said, ""just leave it."" I guess she just simply misunderstood us, though. No biggie.


Small plates are $6 each.
Marbella French Fries - These were pretty good.  I'd get them again.
2 Tacos Chicken or Beef - I got beef and they weren't too shabby.

Medium plates are $9 each.
Boneless Baby Back Ribs - there's just something off about this.
Manchego Mac 'n Cheese - if you're a mac & cheese person, I guess. My friend ordered this and I don't usually eat mac and cheese so I'm not sure if this is up to par or not :b.

Large plates are $16 each.
Lamb Chops - These were delish. I probably wouldn't pay $16 for them but they were pretty good nonetheless.

We also ordered the Paella de Marisco (half order) but the rice was very undercooked and I barely touched it. It just wasn't that good.

For desserts, we got the Torta de Chocolate and that was YUMMY!!! I would most definitely get that again!! :D It has walnuts in it so beware if you're not a nuts person!

Check-in for a complimentary red sangria!",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,2,1,4,nlkw4gXL2w9dr2USX3I__A

The calamari and epanadas were awesome, the fish tacos and paella were mediocre.  I have been to firefly, and honestly the food here isnt quite firefly level.
4 stars for decent food, fantastic service and good ambience .",q6ShBpgwKGyXoM24wPuSyg,1,0,4,RLTegUT41JNrqGotR52nmg

As at the party, smooth Hummus made with Tahini and ladled onto Pita Chips was a nice start, accompanied by very good Fried Calamari cooked with peppers.  A cold Shrimp Ceviche was excellent.  And, a cheese-covered Onion Soup was real rich in flavor, and had well-caramelized onions, but was somewhat winey in taste.  Caesar Salad was very good, with a nice crunch to it.

My entree of a full order of Paella Valenciana, with chicken, Valencia Rice, saffron, chorizo, and bell peppers was good but I didn't notice any green beans in it as advertised, and the chicken was overdone.  Thin French Fries were very good, and others at my table enjoyed their well-prepared steaks.

A dessert of Torta de Chocolate topped by Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce, with strawberry slices on one side of a moist warm Brownie, and pieces of pineapple on the other, was an excellent end to our meal.

The restaurant's ambiance of lush contemporary decor amid Spanish music with a flamenco beat was both elegant and comfortable, while the service was amiable, very efficient, and unobtrusive.  As a special plus, right after meal's end Chef Marco emerged from the kitchen to warmly greet us.

4-1/2 stars overall!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,7,4,zj0FvseY4af-zFZxXs3yrw
