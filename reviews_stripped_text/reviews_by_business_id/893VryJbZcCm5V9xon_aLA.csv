It has taken over the short-lived 'Noble Intentions' restaurant. They have been here for about a month and have not advertised yet, but they are open.

I actually came to the Hideaway to check out Noble Intentions. I was really surprised to see that Those Guys Pies were there. I guess I didn't miss much at Noble Intentions since they opened for only a couple of months. Lucky for me, I had the original location of Those Guys Pies bookmarked for the longest time, so I was able to kinda check off that bookmark, I think.

For those who don't know the story of Those Guys Pies, they were opened by some of the original partners of Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino. They branched off and did their own thing, building a place in the Lakes area of Vegas and became very successful, even being featured in Guy Fieri's Diner's Drive-In's and Dives.

After finding out, I had to try the White Pie, which was one of my favorite slices at Secret. The food came out and I couldn't be happier!

White Pie (Sauce less, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Garlic) - Just like how I remembered it, but better. Great quality cheeses, and the garlic flavor popped. Those guys pies do a version of NY style pizza, and they do it well. Crispy, crusty, and chewy all at the same time. I can't think of anything negative to say, it was just a fantastic pizza.

There aren't a lot of quality dining options around this area, so I'm glad that Those Guys Pies has opened up. Also, this would be a great place to grab some food at Those Guys Pies, as well as a beverage from the Hideaway while you watch your sports team in action. Their POS system isn't set up by the time I'm writing this review, but it should be available soon. If you need to use a credit card, you can pay at the bar until it is set up. The people next to me had ordered a sub and sandwich, and it looked really good, I might have to check that out next time.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,26,25,5,fw3WVFY_2I0MwtDc9LMLWg

Place is a bit hidden and as the previous reviewer noted; no point of sale system set up just yet but if you like pizza you MUST go here. 

The pizza is spectacular!  I tried a slice walking to my car and had to eat another before even I pulled out. 

I'm trying to save enough to take a picture of to post here...",BY45YF-_MrVSwbqMpCXVPQ,2,1,5,oVPF6AmbRp3aDptkhE4OuQ

The chicken Philly is the best Philly I've ever had!! Make sure you have them add onions, and mushrooms. Worth the couple extra dollars. Staff is very friendly. My reasons for a 4 out of 5 stars was the seating and no restrooms. They only have two tables. There is outdoor seating by the lake for all surrounding businesses. Great on a nice day. I definitely recommend this restaurant!",ACMYTmlycF2-HgSZ8lyC0A,0,0,4,2w0oYyBr2FfaPKJqMvqq0w

The location is a bit off the beaten path but close enough to get take out so no problem there. We only got plain cheese pies so cannot comment on other toppings. We will return...already hungry for more!",gIcpEY34kKVvbHlQJcooQA,1,0,5,uvMRFHuwQEvQe38kaSexUw
