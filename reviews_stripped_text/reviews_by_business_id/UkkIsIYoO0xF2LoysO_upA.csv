Granted it was a quiet night, but the service was excellent and their attitude towards us did not change in the least once we told them we would be using our groupon. There were 4 different people tending to us with the perfect amount of respect. (attentive but not intrusive). The food was absolutely amazing! The best steak and lobster we've ever had. We wouldn't have ventured that far down the strip but this deal was too good to pass up and we really enjoyed ourselves. Even without the groupon the prices would have been reasonable for the gourmet meal we received. I would recommend this place to anyone heading to Vegas!

Rocco the host is an awesome dude.
Our server, I forget his name, was equally as awesome.

The food was incredible. My friend and I both had the steak and lobster and agreed it was one of the best meals we'd had. The filet was cooked perfect medium and cut like butter. The lobster was beautifully presented, flavorful, and a perfect compliment to the steak.

They started us with bread and 3 flavors of butter, just wonderful. We shared onion soup and calamari appetizers which were both top notch. 
Along with the surf and turf we shared a baked potato and creamed spinach. We were so full we barely touched them and took them to a go.

I should also add that the interior of the steak house is very classy and modern looking.

This was definitely a meal I will not forget.",ffIFviebzLr29gXv83pMKQ,0,0,5,5-J6-4oMRyim6hc8pZFjYQ

Good bread and flavored butters
Filet was decent quality but certainly not the best I have had
Everything is extra
Good appetizers
Very good, but pricey drinks
Happy hour is kinda lame as the choices are few
Good wait staff

My main issue with this place is that they raised prices AT LEAST 3 times in the last 18 months, so the value here seems to be getting less each time. ...But still cheaper than most steakhouses on the strip for now.

I like this place but it's no longer the bargain it used to be. So I will go here when my better choices are booked up.",U4RVxbj8DxG68fI-qZbZzw,0,1,3,r9-YVwtaiiYjdX77ei0M8Q

I especially wasn't expecting superb service and gourmet food! This place is outstanding. Even without the Groupon, the prices are very humble. Everything we got was delicious.

We were seated immediately as it was not very crowded on a Monday night. 
Our server was cool. He looked like the sidekick from Quantum Leap. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. He recommended the Scallpos for an appetizer and we were sure glad he did. They were phenomenal. Biggest scallops in the ocean onto my plate, seared perfectly with a miso butter sauce that was divine.

Warm spinach and bacon salad was delicious. Just wish it was bigger for sharing. My wife got mad that I ate it all so quick. 

If you have the word steak in your restaurant in Vegas, you have a lot of pressure to deliver. R Steak & Seafood did just that. Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tons of great flavors. 

So I thought with a Groupon, the drinks would be like ""Vegas specials"". Wrong. Good size drinks with good pours.",KZFzcTqETO2nWgl8A57cmg,7,2,5,4QizGAg6rFY-OUba65AkUg

My cell phone lost power, so the hostess offered to charge it during the meal. Talk about willing to go the extra mile to assist a customer.

1752082,2012-09-30,1,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"Hands down the best Groupon I have ever bought. If not for the great Yelp reviews I would have passed, simply because it seemed too good to be true. 

The Groupon was $45 for two tickets to the Riviera Comedy club and $70 worth of dinner at R Steak & Seafood. Crazy, right? 

Our waiter was awesome. Bobby, as he liked to be called, was energetic and all too happy to please while not being too overbearing. Perfect waiter!

I had the 10 oz. filet, asparagus, and sauteed mushrooms. All were perfectly done and as I type this I am suddenly overwhelmed with a craving for all three!

Hubby got some pasta thing that he loved but I didn't care about because I was too busy with my meal. 

The bread served was tasty and I ate nearly the whole loaf myself. I really liked the three kinds of spread, although the red pepper cream cheese was the best. 

The food, including one beer for the old man, came out to us owing just $4. So now our meal and show was only $49? Oh man. The waiter totally deserved the huge tip we left. 

***Word of caution: Although the site lists this place as 'casual', I suggest you not show up in a tank top or a halter dress like we did. It felt kind of awkward and I apologized profusely to the host. He was kind about it though because it is casual, just not as casual as us :)",3uhU_DdYjI0tmB9iOfXPrQ,0,0,5,ObLlV1HaeGFZJRoPpt3lGg

The cocktail shrimps were large, which I liked, although I wish there were more than 4 pieces. Mike and I both had a bone-in rib-eye steak and baked potato. He had the green peppercorn sauce on the side and I had the demi-glace. The demi-glace went well with the steak. Without the sauce, the steak was tender but a bit bland for my taste. Mike enjoyed his steak but he preferred to use my demi-glace sauce rather than the green peppercorn sauce that he ordered. The baked potato was good. I really liked the skin of the potato as it was seasoned with salt. We ordered bacon bits for the potatoes, which cost an extra $2 (not the bottle type). For dessert we ordered creme brulee and peach cobbler. The peach cobbler was good, but my favorite was the creme brulee.

2332138,2013-10-03,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"This is the high end restaurant at the Riviera.

It's moderately priced and quite fair compared to it's peers at the larger hotel casinos and for the price, portion and quality the R STEAK & SEAFOOD can go toe to toe and head to head against other restaurants of maybe higher prestige and brand name recognition.

I'd actually make a specific trip to The Rivera just to eat at R S&S.  I stayed at The Riviera this trip, so it was a convenient place to eat.

What a surprise 'tho !!!

This is an amazing restaurant.  If you're a lone traveler for business, they serve the full menu at the bar / pub which has TV's or in the dining area.

The Prime Rib is so awesome, maybe one of the best I've ever had.

The crab cakes are also excellent and amongst the best I've had.

The service is generally good and gracious.  The bar area can get crowded and maybe too much for the short staff to serve with speed.  The restaurant has good service that's attentive.  The front restaurant host reception area fell short a bit, routing people to the bar over the restaurant.

An avg meal here is probably $40-60 per person w/ an appetizer, main course and a drink... so that's a pretty decent bargain for Vegas when it comes to a quality steakhouse.

Keep in mind, I'm comparing R S&S to SW Steakhouse, Cut,  The Palm, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Carnivore, Delmonico's, Smith and Wollinskiys, and Prime Steakhouse... and I'm saying this provides comparable value at 1/2 the price of it's peers.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,6,0,4,ElAPDqLdSFuoRMOwdFwYsA

2641990,2015-04-27,2,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"First off another Yelp name change.  This is R Steak and Seafood in the Riviera.  Not sure why or who approved it to be changed to Riviera Hotel & Casino.  The hotel is getting imploded so guess it doesn't really matter.  Just annoying.  The name was correct a week ago.  

My first 1 star review.  This place was horrible from start to finish.  I know its in the Riviera but I had heard good things so was optimistic.  We were going to see a comedy show and this seemed like the best bet in the Riv.  

First off we were late.  We would have made it but the clusterfuck that is the Riviera parking garage had us trapped.  That's another story.  Anyways when we got there we were 15 min late.  I apologized when we checked in.  You would think this was the end of the world.  Look if you can't seat us, no problem.  I would understand.  We were late.  But to keep checking your watch and muttering under your breath is extremely rude and unprofessional.  When we were finally seated it was hard not to notice the dining room was half empty.  It was a Monday evening, can't imagine they were gonna be packed later in the night.  

Our waitress left much to be desired.  She had an attitude from the beginning.  Asked if they had a cocktail menu she responded we have a full bar we can make whatever you want and walked off.  Guess cause they are getting ready to close the hotel no one cares. We were rarely checked on throughout the meal and the food took forever to come out.  We had to hunt her down for the check and to check on our dessert we ordered with our dinner.  

The food wasn't much better.  I got the R Burger my friend got a Strip Steak.  We shared a side of Mac n Cheese.  Everything was ok but not great.  Nothing stood out.  We had ordered Peach Cobbler when we placed our dinner order.  Our food took close to an hour to come out so we were short on time when we asked for the check and to check on our dessert.  The server says oh you want me to check on your cobbler?  Um no we are just gonna pay and leave.  Yes please check on our dessert that was ordered over an hour ago thanks.  It finally comes and is lukewarm and the dough on top is raw.  This was the first time I have ever spit food out at a restaurant.  It was that bad.  I still can't believe it.  I felt horrible spiting it out but there was no way I could swallow it.

The ambiance was very nice, the servers was excellent, the maitre d was on point when it came to go around and checking on people. 

I ordered the Ribeye steak medium and it was DAMN GOOD, my dad got the prime rib. He enjoyed it and my mom got the fish which she couldn't stop talking about.

Our evening got off to a rocky start, as we were seated and not acknowledged by any of the wait staff for at least 10 minutes.  Finally we flagged down a waitress, who did not have our table in her rotation, but being that we were rather irate, she waited on us for our meal.  There was apparently some confusion as to who had us, and later in the meal when our original waiter was serving us too, Roger and I didn't know what to make of this haphazard arrangement.  It was nice that we could use part of our Groupon on the dinner specials, so I had the prime rib.  Roger had the short ribs.  The side dishes were quite good, and our mixed drinks were good, too.  The prime rib wasn't the best I ever tasted, but it was a good dish anyway.  The desserts were delicious: a blueberry cheesecake for Roger, and a creme brûlée for me.

3195083,2014-04-16,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"This is my honest thoughts of the place
Pros: food is amazing!! Steak was cooked perfectly! Mac and cheese was good.  All our sides were awesome.  
- I know this sounds weird but I loved the way the water waiter poured the water - very classy.  Our waiter was a nice guy and really worked hard for us
- they DID charge my iphone - which was HUGE. Being in Vegas on an empty phone sucks

Negatives
1. This place would do so much better in another hotel.  Rivera is ghetto!! For 30-40/steak, I'm paying for food and ambiance - ambiance is not upscale
2. No drink menu...waiter said this is an open bar but I when I come to a nice steak place, I want to see if the bar tender can make me something new.  Margarita was just mix and ice and topped off with rum.  Not good at all.  This place doesn't have the classy big cubes of ice
3. I made a reservation using yelp/open table two hrs before.  When I got there (on time) my table was not ready...it took 12 minutes to get ready and this place was empty!!  Then my table was right in front ....like right when you enter the restaurant - my table was there.  I asked to be in the back where we can have an intimate group dinner but she said those tables were taken (no one sat there when we got there and no one was there when we left)
4.  If a small group orders food, it's not too hard to remember who ordered what.  

Overall - would pay more if this place was in a different hotel - great food - just a few things that need tweeking",AFGff0dOyb7aE7V_vj4Xjg,1,0,3,CT_LG5ra0osTHthV7slVmw

Started out with a fat tire beer when they brought bread out. The beer and the bread hit the spot and I quickly noticed the service was very attentive and it seemed like a very nice place, I could tell that it was newly remodeled because everything looked new from the tables to the floor.

We then got an appetizer, the scallops. Oh my oh my these were excellent to say the least. they were wrapped in bacon and melted in your mouth cooked to perfection. Best scallops I have had for quite some time. Next, we ordered steaks, they were excellent too to say the least. I had the filet and it was cooked to perfection. The best steak I had for quite some time, better than Mortons or Ruth Cris.  After that I got another fat tire and we left. 

What made this all the better was that I had a groupon and this meal which would have been well over $100 came up to about $20 after tip and paying for the groupon, you can't beat value like that.

Food took forever, though.
Portion size was quite large.  You will not leave hungry.

Three different butter's for the fresh bread was a nice touch.

I had the sirloin steak.  It was a very thick and large steak cooked just like I ordered it. However, it had some kind of rub or coating on it that I was not crazy about.  It had a strong rosemary taste.

My baked potato was ok; skin was tough and it was only lukewarm.  My wife's Mac n cheese was good, but different; a unique type of cheese is used to make it.

The salad we had with cranberries, walnuts, bacon, and feta cheese was probably the best part of the meal.

Our waiter, Bobby, was kind enough to let us know that they had something other than just Merlot and Chardonnay,  so we both ordered a Pinot Noir.  Wine pour was extremely generous.  
We then ordered some food.  Hub went for the regular sliders and I went for the short rib sliders with horseradish sauce.  We also ordered the Parmesan fries.  All of these were listed at 7,8 and 5 dollars in that order.
Hub so loved the sliders for they were charbroiled and delicious.  He was kind enough to give me a bite.

The salmon, she said was a perfect 10.  While I was in the restaurant, I noticed a party switch tables and from what I can tell, the staff didn't change the napkins on the table with new ones.

The restaurant fails in the fact that for the price I could have gotten the same or better meal elsewhere.

We made reservations and arrived just as they were opening.  We were seated promptly and told that Bobby would be our server.  Within a short time, Bobby appeared at the table to ask about drinks.  We ordered two iced teas that were promptly brought. We were also brought a a bread basket with some lavash and warm rolls.  

I had looked at the menu online so there was no wait in giving Bobby our order.  For a started, we got the asparagus fries.  There were five spears with just a small amount of breading and deep fried.  They were quite good.  The tarragon in  ketchup gave it a good flavor.  I'm not a ketchup fan but I dipped some of my asparagus pieces in their ketchup.

The meal comes with soup or salad.   We both opted for the soup du jour which was potato cheese and it was superb!  It is a smooth potato soup, not chunky, and the flavors were there.

I got the 10 ounce filet cooked blue just as I asked and my wife got the roasted chicken breast.  The steak had been rolled in cracked pepper before grilling and there was some freshly ground salt on top.  The combination along with the fact that the steak was very tender made this a winner.   The steak came with choice of mashed or baked potato.  I chose the baked and got a nice size potato with extra butter and cream cheese.My wife was a bit disappointed with her chicken which was dry from being baked too long.  Her dinner came with some seasonal vegetables.

For dessert, we shared a peach cobbler with a small container of crème Anglaise.  The cobbler was good and more than enough for two.

Our server, Bobby, was a gem.  It seemed like he must have been there for a long time but I didn't ask.  He checked on us often, he stopped by to ask if we had talked about the peach cobbler because he wanted to let us know that it takes about 20 minutes to bake.  This is exactly what a good server does.  He helps, checks on you, but doesn't hover.

The Mac n cheese beautifully presented in a cute cast iron dish, piping hot and it did not disappoint. Would have liked to try the peach cobbler but we were stuffed. We even had a to go bag because we could not finish our food.

The staff was super friendly and took great care of us.  The only reason I'm not giving a 5 star was because some of the food wasn't quite as good as the price.

The Grub:

The bread was pretty standard, warm with some spreadable butter.  Pretty good but nothing special.

For apps we had shrimp cocktail and crab cakes.  The shrimp cocktail was nice and big and cold, perfect.  The crab cake was good, but just a bit mushy.  My standard is the crab cake at the Double Eagle which is far superior to this crab cake and most crab cake around the world.

The salad they gave me was a ""house Cesare"" that came with my entre.  Cesare salads are not my bag, but I didn't get to choose.  It was okay, but Id rather have an nice Italian salad.

For my entre I enjoyed a Tender Sea Bass seared perfectly.  The meat flaked off into juicy bites.  The only issue was that there were some bones in the fillet.  I have never had to deal with bones in any sea bass fillet I've had before which seemed strange.  The Sea Bass was well above average, but not the best I've Ever had.

For dessert the staff brought out a chocolate cake they made for my birthday.  It was very delicious.",bWJWcQyDKtFSvsTW2tR3hw,4,3,4,hKQZPYDcESC8NEp2D8SBxA

As far as other steakhouses in this price range, I prefer The Barrymore and Envy for their higher level of sides (which are not free) and a nicer selection of non-steak entrees.  But their steaks are very comparable.

The bread is excellent, fresh baked.

For entrees we each ordered 6 ounce filet mignons and requested that they be prepared medium rare, but were actually served closer to medium.  Our sides of grilled pencil asparagus had little discernable flavor and the garlic mashed potatoes were garlic-lite.  We also shared a (not) warm bacon salad that included onions, hard boiled egg and mushrooms. We have had similar salads many times and this one comes up short in the flavor department.      

We concluded this feast by each ordering, no sharing thank you, crème brulees with berries and Godiva chocolate hazelnut coffees (French blend coffee, Godiva chocolate and Frangelico liqueurs topped with whipped cream).

Not only was he grumpy the whole time he served us, but then he brings out one bill for over $200 and sets it in front of my husband (don't know why - does he look rich or something?).  So we sat there for 15 mins figuring up what each couples bill would be - gave him the 4 amounts and the room numbers to charge it to.  Mr Grump says he can't do that, he has to split the bill, so I had to go with him to his register to help him do that.  He says ""if I'd known ahead of time....""

5013140,2011-08-21,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"There is some serious value going on at this new steakhouse at the Riviera.  New ownership took over this hotel, I believe in April.  Since then they've made some impressive changes.  Everything is cleaner and much easier to navigate.

Anyways, on to the food.

Marks of good food preparation are proper seasoning and cooking to the right temperature.  ""R"" hits both those right on the head.  The scallops we had would be right at home in top restaurants.  Great seasoning, great sear, and cooked to a perfect temperature.  Cooked all the way through but just barely.  Really impressive for a place that isn't really supposed to be a high end steakhouse (they don't have prime grade steaks there.)

Oysters were fresh and fantastic.  Served with a nice dipping sauce.  I really couldn't believe I was enjoying a meal at the Riviera (it's kind of strange to even see me write that) but I was.

On to the steaks - of course I had the bone ribeye.  Yeah baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  Juicy, well marbled, and cooked to medium rare just as I requested.  Seasoned beautifully.  No, it wasn't a prime steak but it was pretty darn close to what you'd get at a premium steakhouse but for about 1/3 of the price.  Really nice.

Garlic mashed potatoes were solid.  Garlicky and buttery with a nice consistency.  The creamed corn was also great - a nice vibrant color as well.

Hopefully the other places to eat at Riviera catch up to this new steakhouse.  Just opened a few days ago but service was very good already.

PS - forgot to mention the bread they start you with.  Waiter rolls out his tray with a nice big loaf and starts scoring it for you so you can tear it apart with your hands.  Served with 3 different kinds of butter.  The bread, I kid you not, was as good as you'll get at all but the highest end 2 and 3 star Michelin restaurants and comparable to all the 1 star Michelin places I've dined at.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,8,2,5,XCZNjoMyM9quY5lEISnf4A

Add in $5 drinks from their menu (groupon makes em $2.50) and it makes for a really good time. I bought a couple of the $200 ones to really have fun with another couple on date night...don't get fooled by the chocolate lava cake, it's just a mini bundt cake microwaved with chocolate sauce on top...was expecting a true molton lava cake.

 It's really nice. I think they had just remodeled a few months before our visit in June.

5229795,2011-12-23,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"I had a good deal, and decided to visit this new steakhouse at the edge of the Strip. It's a bit far in the back of the hotel, so you might have to ask for directions. If you're staying at the Riviera, I think it's much easier to find since it's by the pool entrance and tower elevators.

Fried Calamari- 3.5-stars- Crispy, breaded calamari. Very soft, tender pieces. Each piece is bite-sized, served with lemon and a saucer of cream. The batter is lightly flavored. It's hard to tell this is squid, because it's cut into such small squares. There's no legs or other parts to give away it's identity. You get a good sized portion of this. So you can eat it like little popcorn squid.

Thai Coconut Seared Mussel- 4-stars- You get a giant pan of over a dozen mussels in a shallow layer of the coconut sauce. You really want to scoop it up and suck it out with the mussels. There are also slices of bread seeped with the sauce. I think you'll have table bread which is also good to dip in with. Overall, the flavor is excellent. Of course, each mussel comes with it's own tiny plate--the shell. I should note, because it is Thai, it is a little spicy!

Miso Seared Scallops- 4.5-stars- The dish itself is beautiful. You get three huge scallops. They're juicy, lightly sweet, and very soft and tender. This is definitely a must for seafood or scallop lovers. It just breaks apart, like warm butter. I also liked the sauce a lot, which I tried to scoop up with the pieces of seaweed on the platter. Another good place to use your table bread.

10 oz. Filet Mignon- 5-stars- I ordered this Medium Rare. The meat is utterly soft and flavorful. I don't know what their special rub is, but it's just bursting with taste. It brings to mind a mixture of caramel flavors, cumin and sea salt. The top is seared to perfection being both crispy and crunchy. Although a little small for the size, it just explodes with delicious, mouth-watering flavor. This is definitely a must try!

Ambiance- It is set up with some luxury, dimly lit with nice, comfy chairs. The seating is far enough apart and varied enough to allow parties of different sizes. Even though it's a new location, and relatively hard to find, it was filled up when I arrived.

Service- They are very generous here, friendly and helpful--which is actually rare in Vegas. We had several personal issues come up during the dinner, which quite embarrassed me, but they deals with our problems immediately and as professionally as possible. Food came in decent waves, allowing us to enjoy one plate for a a little while, before a second plate arrived.

Conclusion- My total bill came out, with two beer, well over one-hundred dollars, which was a little high for me. I hadn't eaten all day, so I was starving, and my mother, whom I came with--it was her birthday--had to leave suddenly. So I was left to finish most of the food. I was filled, but not overly stuffed. The steak, for the size, was delicious but maybe a little pricey--I'm not an expert on steaks, just yet.

       - Food - The steaks are grilled to perfection and the sides are brimming with butterly flavor.

       - Breads and assorted butters - They bring your bread with 3 different butters to choose from. It adds a unique touch to the normal artisan breads.
       - $8 Caesar Salad - It's different than your traditional caesar salad. It's pretty much two large stalks of lettuce on a plate with their cheddar waffer as a cruton. I liked it.
       - $26 Filet Mignon 6 oz. - Juicy and tender, but at 6 ounces, it's very tiny.
       - $36 Porterhouse 24 oz. - Grilled just right with a buttery taste in every bite. I ended up using some of the butters from the bread they gave us earlier, but I think that was overkill.
       - $7 Sauteed Mushrooms - Very rich with butter. They tasted so good and you know they're terrible for you.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice dinner out.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,2,4,09_L1A7e_pP4_Mur38D2GA

Inside the R steak and seafood restaurant...you are in another world. Its a nice place. hostess was extremely friendly  as was our waiter..bobby. really made you feel as home.

5394900,2014-12-30,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,I loved this. I live in New York and this is the most reasonable steakhouse. It was delicious. The waiters are really helpful. My waiter was bobby and when we got to the dessert he warned us about the peaches. Also he was really kind.,7igyZRXevv5gSlD4CRB7zQ,0,0,5,4YKIZHzoagxteBUuzx6WZw

One of my gripes is that they tried to change the deal at the last minute, but with one phone call from my husband things went back to normal. The French onion soup was great, terrific in fact. The prime rig was a very generous portion and the service was attentive. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided the service for that.. BIG Kudos for that. We went back for their late night Happy Hour and it was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and the decor was beautiful. I would highly recommend  this place for a large event as well.",i9icXofKmHgKIWomyWotxA,0,0,4,oO-7bMgZs5gJ7qduryf2rw

5583562,2014-04-23,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,We waited 1 hour an still didn't get our food. The other tables around us received their plates an finished. We had to ask why we didn't get served the manager said it was because of there new menu. What a stupid reply!!,mFStc3EYZ7MEh5m39Uqk-w,0,0,1,Ai7VZ-ER_AuXfnfJ7f_i9g
5817797,2014-01-21,0,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,Gem of the Riviera for sure! Stopped in for happy hour.  Pinot Grigio is not on the menu but they still served it to me at 5$ a glass.  I had to take my fries to go eventually - you can really taste the truffle oil - great size portions can't complain at all!!! I suggest the parmesan truffle fries or caprese skewers! I had a great bartender too left a 3$ tip on a 10$ bill!!! :),sBbyYSNDDxtkDfqExA5GPA,0,0,5,8dFSIGbfIQ9hhuxICWWSkg

5865725,2014-07-25,1,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"My steak was cooked perfectly but I almost sent it back because of the enormous amount of salt that covered it, overpowering the flavor of the meat.  Once I wiped off most of the salt, the filet was actually quite good.  Nice baked potatoe.  The bacon bits were a little unusual-very thick, like bacon nuggets, but they were flavorful.  The French Onion soup was disappointing, as it seemed like it was from out of a can with partially melted provolone, not swiss, on top.  The people were friendly, but my waitress forgot me after I ordered and I had to flag her down three different times.  Pricey, but overall, was pretty good and I'd go back.

I'd give this place 3.5 stars, if I could, but I'll round up this time.",VnwAkLCq_Xx2YlJck3AxTg,1,0,4,bgJtjHhYOe-UZCJW3bqV3g
5877914,2014-12-18,1,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"The bf and I came here on November 23, 2014 with a groupon for $100 worth of food, I paid $42.50 for it. We were not disappointed! We had the Baltimore Crab cakes (2) $17, Filet 10oz $42, bone in ribeye 20oz $40, 2 specialty drinks $5 each totaled to $117ish for two. Both entrees came with a soup or salad and mash potatoes or baked potato. Mash potatoes and salad is the way to go! Im not saying that the baked potato or soup are bad but its not my preference. We had never had such succulent cuts of meat! The only thing I didnt like was the wait time. Nearly an hour wait after we ordered to get our meal. I wouldnt mind if we weren't on a schedule. Other than that the experience was great! I cannot wait to eat here again, I've purchased a groupon already $41.60 this time for $100 worth of food. Remember people, on certain days there's codes that give you up 20% off local deals:) . . .",-DFNxi21fKrM9AP_vf59lw,1,2,5,eUhdSSXNjau_mn62NLlh5Q
5948156,2014-12-05,1,UkkIsIYoO0xF2LoysO_upA,"I don't give out 5 stars too often, but R steak and Seafood deserves it.  

We came on a Monday for my birthday dinner.  Camille was our server and she was awesome.  

I also had a groupon( 50 for 100), however I think I paid 45.00 because I had a promo code.  I struggled to even spend the entire 100.00.  We spent 98.00 and the extra 2.00 was taken off the tax that we owed.   

I ordered the crab cakes for an appetizer.  I ate one and took the other one home.  They were tasty, however a tad overpriced for 17.00.  There was a special menu with entrees that came with salads and veg.  I had the sea bass that had Asian flavors.  It was really tasty and a bargain at 22.00.  It came with a really good ceasar salad.   My spouse had a filet mignon.  She loved it.  She said it was extremely flavorful.  She also said it was better than the filet she had at The Palm the very next day( that's a great compliment).  Her entrée also came with salad and a baked or mashed potato.  

We took another potato to go and a blueberry cheesecake to go

I also had an order of creamed spinach( which I enjoyed more than the Palm's creamed spinach). 

The breads basket was really tasty too.  We didn't get any soda because all they have is Pepsi products( Vegas is a Pepsi town). 

They brought me complimentary ice cream for my birthday.  Very nice meal and a steal for what we paid.  I'm still eating leftovers, 3 days later.",FVeD1j9SeczVz-jZyPxBJg,3,0,5,yWIWEq864hggE6751XQBAQ
