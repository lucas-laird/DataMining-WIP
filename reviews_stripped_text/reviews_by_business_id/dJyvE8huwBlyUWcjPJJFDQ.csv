1420407,2014-09-13,2,dJyvE8huwBlyUWcjPJJFDQ,"""Mediterranean"" market with a halal butcher counter and a small dine-in area offering up falafel, kabob, and shwarma plates and sandwiches. Store itself isn't much: the other Euro markets have better selection and organization, and the only thing making this ""Mediterranean"" is their selection of baklava, olives, and olive oil. But all of their products can be found elsewhere in town, and their produce is less than fresh.
But the halal butcher is fairly unique: $27 for a giant lamb shank to be turned into a stew? Totally doable here.

Dine-in counter has a few basic tables and chairs but most orders seem to be for takeout. As advertised on a banner on building exterior, they have a chicken shwarma sandwich for $4.99. What the banner doesn't tell you is that it's a giant wrap with an amazing garlic sauce. That garlic sauce makes it, and it's what I miss from my favorite Med place in Texas. I'll come back for that, repeatedly!

Another score on the menu is the beef filet mignon kabobs: priced at a $12 plate for a good portion of tender, flavorful beef on a bed of yellow rice, with sides of marinated veggies and creamy hummus. Hummus was good, and is on the sides menu for about $5/portion along with babaghanoush and tabouli.

Come for the chicken shwarma wrap and the filet, but not much else. Do your grocery shopping elsewhere, grab your dinner to go. Counter service doesn't really speak English, so just know the number of the meal you're ordering.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,3,3,ZDbkrt1HOvKpYO007hS9AA

Not only do they have a full market with many specialty items you cannot find elsewhere, but they also have a full produce section with hard to find produce and a halal meat counter with specialty cuts of beef and lamb.  

The man behind the counter, Assmat, he looks a little gruff but he is very nice and is very helpful. I told him I wanted to make something at home just like they did in the deli and he went department to department showing me what I would need. 

The prices are great - I think the most expensive item I bought was a $10 bottle of Olive Oil.",ks-THNW260klKVtl4-BQVQ,1,1,5,BXK9_VVpnkQDzFKROmqAtA

4326962,2014-12-16,0,dJyvE8huwBlyUWcjPJJFDQ,"I had such a positive experience here that it compelled me to write my first yelp review. 

We were in the Chinatown area headed to my daughters school but we were an hour early so we decided to grab lunch. This was a completely last-minute ""hurry up, turn!"" food decision. Sometimes those last-minute decisions can be completely questionable but this was one of the better food decisions we've made in awhile. 

This place is a Mediterranean Market/Restaurant. Restaurant might be a misleading word because you order at the deli/meat counter and then seat yourself at the small section of tables and chairs. The guy at the counter is EXTREMELY nice and very personable even going as far as recommending not to order a side of gyro meat because our original order came with a lot of food! I got a very family vibe from the place, from the food to the service. They cared very much about your experience here. 

I ordered the 13.99 mixed kabob plate which  is 3 kabobs and is a lot of meat for that price. Most other kabob places give two skewers for that price. Meat quality was great and hummus was smooth and creamy. The highlight for me was a garlic sauce that i dipped my meats into that was super addicting! My fianc√© had the beef kabob sandwich for 6.99 that he enjoyed also. 

They also sell a nice selection of baked goods, produce and meats. All in all a very great experience and we will certainly be back.",IGBilULpgNHfKitLfrs7Hw,1,3,5,Tw578ERzPQI8BblxnP1HGA

The restaurant side offers delicious falafel; shawarma and kebab; HOWEVER, sanitary practices are very questionable, the cook goes from handling money, to cooking, to eating without ever washing his hands or even wearing gloves. Unsanitary conditions are most visible in the butcher section; old discolored cut meat and ground beef is visibly displayed, and dry blood is dripping all over over the meat display. And through it all the Health Department's A grade is proudly displayed at n the top of the meat display case.

The market is pretty nice. There's an excellent variety of middle eastern products including a halal meat counter where you can get any part of a lamb you want. The place is clean and spacious and the prices are pretty good. 

The food in the restaurant I can only judge by the kefta sandwich that I ordered. My he kefta kebab sandwich was perfect!

I love in LA and found this place only because I was getting my car repaired nearby, but I wish it were closer to my house. I'll try to visit every time I'm in Las Vegas.",tMGVjFUAOGACYIHbxMgTCg,0,0,5,PvQojFNE4SzYW_83dP0moA

Thoughts:
-They need to spruce this place up. It looked straight up dirty.
-Put incense in an aisle, not at the exit, past the cash registers. 
-Take credit/debit cards if the purchase is less than $10 without a huge fee attached.

I had a bottle of Cortas rose water and a bottle of orange blossom water and found out that they don't take cards for a $6 transaction. I asked if I could just pay a service charge and she said it would be at least... $2.50 to pay with debit. Eff that. Lawrence pulled out cash and off we went.

I think the waters had been sitting on the shelf too long. The orange blossom water smells like... vomit. I don't know if the lid oxidized or what, but it smells awful.
