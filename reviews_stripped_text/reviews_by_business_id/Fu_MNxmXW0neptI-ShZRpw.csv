226779,2012-12-27,0,Fu_MNxmXW0neptI-ShZRpw,I've been to tasty station serval times. The food is tasty and they have good lunch prices. The one thing I will note is that it takes way too long to get your food! My co-worker and myself go during lunch but we are going to have to stop going because it takes them 30 min to 50 min to bring us our food and we do not have enough time to eat because our lunch is over by the time we get our food. I do not understand  why it takes them so long they are not even busy. One time it took  them 30min and we were the only ones in the place? Today we had to leave because they had two other tables and after 45 min they had not even begun cooking our food ( they only had two other table sof 3-5 people)? If they do not pick up the pace they will be out of business soon.,JnjpaGE16Oam_MFGb_1xfA,0,0,3,dt6uVLtWzwAKXyPjEKgJNw

My two favorite dishes are the orange chicken and the sweet and sour chicken. The main reason is the way they bread or batter their chicken. Most Chinese restaurants it is a struggle to find the chicken under the gobs of greasy breading. Or it's just the chicken with no breading at all. Here, they lightly batter the chicken so you get all the great texture of breading but can still taste the chicken! And the batter helps hold the awesome flavored orange sauce to each piece of chicken. 

The service is incredibly quick and friendly. The chef should be given an award. The portion sizes are big enough for you and two or three friends. Three of us usually share one order with white rice and we feel like we over indulged afterwards. 

Goofy name...but oh so true! Tasty!",x2zqe6-i5Sxxh3dLFk1M0Q,2,1,5,jD54iPEd68rBL7CPD4s_fg

I am forever waiting for an authentic HK style western cuisine restaurant to open up in Las Vegas where I can get a good baked pork chop rice dish.  Well, although this place didn't have this dish on the menu, I did try their baked portuegese pork chop rice dish.  The flavour was quite good and the portion was quite large.  I also tried their hot pot rice on the waiter's recommendation.  It took about 20 mins to make it.  The flavour was good, but the hot pot was rather small and there wasn't any hard crispy rice at the bottom of the pot.  The hard crispy rice is what differentiates a good hot pot rice from an average one.  I have to give this dish an average rating.  I give this place 3.5 stars for now.  I see the potential in this restaurant and will come back to try more items on the menu.",cImvLb3Wvd5EZ8SRjKAPsw,1,1,3,PGdaHQSTln0NbjEg8luOcA

Our order - won ton soup, Kung pao beef and orange chicken. The won ton soup came out first but the broth was to dark with soy sauce. The won ton was tasty and full of shrimp and included Chinese greens. When our other entrees came out the chef made Mongolian beef instead of Kung pao which I ended up accepting since we were in a hurry. The orange chicken was decent tasting nothing spectacular.

The waitress was good although I ended up down grading Tasty Station a star due the the mishaps on the won ton soup and mis ordering.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,0,0,3,UAiprXWFzxfavogD9ZP5-A
4508141,2012-12-26,1,Fu_MNxmXW0neptI-ShZRpw,"I have no clue how this place got a 4-star as the waitress was not friendly and kind of clueless.  We had 8 people and she asked us how many menus we need.  We asked for drinks and the entire page of great Hong Kong style drinks were not available.  Only soft drink is available.  I hope the food was good but the atmosphere was not welcoming for us to try, so we left...",cRmQoIMdNgUbPIuidGNSDA,1,2,1,Wt3P3i5ircZ0FF5Z4jx8UA
4911063,2012-06-05,3,Fu_MNxmXW0neptI-ShZRpw,Stopped in here for some food...ended up getting GREAT food! Loved the French style filet mignon! This place opened recently and they are off to a great start!,6EpGGv6pdcytF_BwWdqzXA,7,3,5,P2zYrPf77Q7pGod3tDCGzQ
4990959,2012-06-23,0,Fu_MNxmXW0neptI-ShZRpw,"The flavor of the food is solidly authentic.  I am speaking as a Hong Kong native.  The decor is rather drab.  They need to redecorate if they want to attract hip Hong Kongers.  Our bright and friendly waitress didn't speak Cantonese which is unusual but who cares if the food is tasty?  

Our Singapore style chow fun has just the right amount of curry flavor.  The ong choy was seasoned well and plentiful  They didn't over salt the veggies like they do at most restaurants.  The honey and ginger chicken had just the right sweet tanginess.  I wish there was more meat on the chicken bits though.  The XO yee mein was spicy and unctuous.  The noodles can be smoother in texture though.  

When we went, there were only 2 or 3 tables.  I am thinking if they get more business, they will be able to attain better ingredients and the food will get to the excellent level.  I think there is great potential here because the chef obviously knows what he is doing.  He just needs to get his hands on the resources.",Vh3XdOLujwPsUWygXQNO_w,1,2,3,ZTW-4MJp7iL4gZ3kXDS44w

We've randomly ordered selection from menu, ordered some of our usual fave Chinese dishes, and staff recommendations, no complaints so far.",PoH0xOs1xA-STKrbAF5eHQ,10,3,5,W6-r89a0dgvQW_k4IF3g2Q
