670241,2017-01-18,0,vjfBgc83dCMlFMMmMxn-tQ,I loved the burgers at this place! It's fantastic to get local businesses in this area and so much more convenient than driving father to get a quick meal. Both the lady taking our order and the gentleman cooking were friendly and welcoming. The bacon burger was delicious with the bacon cooked to perfection. Thick slices that were crispy without being burnt. Then there were the chili cheese fries. A restaurant or bar can earn my loyalty forever with good chili cheese fries. These had a generous amount of cheese and chili smothering the fries so there was no need for rationing. I will definitely be going back to get more!,_B1l01_9Afdel-29hsgrKg,2,1,5,3eNjVQ48apqeUkfL6_qRtQ

The joint is located in a 'err, umm, ahhhh', lets just say sort of questionable part of town.  It wasn't scary, but it what used to be a house in an older part of town, and thank god for Waze or we never would have found it as we had to drive through back streets in the residential part of the block to get there as there was no easy access from the direction we were traveling in on the far side of the main road.

So we got there probably 2 minutes after the place opened, and just walking in is an experience.  The owner has a friend who is an artist, and there are all these funky paintings of classic singers and actors from the 30's up.  It's got a real Soul Food feel to it, and wouldn't be out of place at all in a Quentin Tarantino film.  The vibe was totally funky!

The owner has got to be one of the nicest guys I've ever met.  Despite doing all of his prep work to open for the day he constantly checked up on us, and then when one of his employees showed up that guy did the same thing.  Then the food showed up.  The fries were home made, and daayuuum were they delic!!!  The burgers were awesome as well, and I have to say that it was one of the best meals I had in Vegas!  

We will definitely go back, and I recommend this place whole heartedly!  My apologies to the owner for not writing this review sooner, it was about 8 months ago that we were there, but you know how life gets in the way sometimes.",3yACy62cgDKjv1jEqSJxxQ,1,0,5,X9k6gwTLyuLXgCNjxrmdqQ
