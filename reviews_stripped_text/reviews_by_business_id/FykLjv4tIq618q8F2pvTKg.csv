I asked about it, they said no more crab legs.  The manager at the desk seemed totally unconcerned that I was unhappy but was totally happy to take my payment after we'd been there 15 minutes.  When I complained that it was bad advertising to show crab legs pictured in the website she just looked at me.  DON'T go to Rainbow Krazy Buffet, staff couldn't care less about you and they have no desire to make things right when confronted.

So, yeah, the food wasn't as krazy as I was expecting; it's Panda Express in buffet form. No seared cow brains and fried chicken beaks here.

I had my doubts about this place. But I have doubts about restaurants that have carpeted floors. GROSS. Ignoring all that, focus on  the rows of food containing soups, vegetables, meats, and fruit. Also, there's back rows with sushi and other miscellaneous foods that I was too lazy to explore, because I kept returning for more of my favorites. Besides, the other stuff looked meh.

Highlights:
- House Special Beef (gimme more of that MSG, please!)
- Egg Drop Soup (ho-ho yummy)
- Beef with Broccoli (good, only got this cause I was missing some greens on my plate)
- Orange Chicken (so good, so good!)
- Black Pepper Squid (not chewy, woot!) 
- Chinese Wontons (stuffed with cream cheeeese!)

Not gonna lie, I did get a little sick from this place right after, but maybe you, reader, have a stomach of steel and could handle this ""gourmet"" Chinese buffet. Ah, but  I'd be krazy, nay, stupid to return for a second time. It was good while it lasted.",CP4WKLIlLcIVm6ov8umgdw,1,2,3,THc8_-i3BWdBo4JzOatP0g

By Friday my credit card was shut down for questionable transactions. There was over $1000. In charges attempted all in the same shipping  center as this place. That is the only place I used my card between lunch and Friday night when I found out my card was blocked, thank God my bank shut it down after a few transactions. I had my card so didn't even know until I tried to use it Friday. Someone is taking the info and then making duplicate cards. If you like the food here then just pay cash or bring your card to counter yourself. Lesson learned.

UPDATE:  I went to talk to the manager to let him know he may have a problem.  He assured me all his employee are long time employees and the cashier is his sister.  He pulled up the security footage, I have to say quite impressed with all the cameras and how clear.  We watched it about 10 times together.  I didn't see any thing weird.  There is a few questionable things but none enough to say it was the waitress.

Other than that, a pretty good selection. It is not the biggest buffet you'll ever see. However, they did have sea bass as well as spicy octopus. Neither of those I would ever expect to see on a lunch buffet.

The desserts were a tad lackluster. I was used to Pacific Buffet where you can have ice cream served in a bowl. Personally, I do not care for vanilla swirl soft serve. Ended up going to Golden Spoon after eating to take care of the frozen dessert craving.

Fresh Seafood, a plethora of entrees and desserts and they even have a sushi session with a chef on stand-by ready to cook you whatever you need. What i appreciate the most is the cleanliness and customer-service, The staff doesn't rush you to finish eating etc. they're definitely worth a second or third visit.

One small note id like to say is that the crab-legs are extremely thin and roughly have no meat in them, I wouldn't recommend them - then again would you expect them to serve unlimited jumbo crab-legs for $12.99?",-m5GK6m4hQiZwl8fpSJkYA,2,2,5,R70AY64IftCHE3_DN-hiJQ

My doc, a very skinny dude. says going to a buffet might make you balloon in weight if you if you can't control your appetite. He doesn't recommend them.  Easy for him to say. But if you love unlimited crab at dinner time - along with Korean BBQ and the usual accompaniments, you ought to try this place. But I have a few things to warn you about. First, some of my friends would think this is dirty and they would not come here. I think it's clean enough, though the bathrooms would gross out a clean freak.  I always bring my own alcohol wipes.  Second, the parking is horrible at night, esp. the weekend.  Third, there might be a wait at dinner time.  The wait is...Krazy long.

 The lunch price is $8.29 per person last I checked. .At dinner the price is $12.99,which includes the aforementioned unlimited crab. The piles of crab creates pigs out of mere mortals.  Soft drinks are extra. The clientele is probably mostly working class families with a few business people.  Not a single guy was wearing a tie.  There were lots of kids of all ages,The tables are close together, so you'll feel cozy and hear all kinds of interesting conversations and arguments. I've seen people ""normal people' but in my last trip there, you could see folks dressed like Beverly Hillbillies  and tattooed grannies.  The people watching is Krazy cool.

The servers are very good about picking up dirty places and refilling water and sodas. Surprisingly, with all that food in the place, the ones that were there were skinnier than my doc. What, they don't eat this food?  Is it Krazy bad? No, I think they hustle the whole time.

I love the various ways shrimp are served, and the vegetable options.  Actually, my two favorite things are the homemade donuts when they are still warm, and the fried platanos. Even Mexican and Filipino restaurants I go to can't make it this sweet and gooey soft, Thank God for the double doors upon exit. waddle waddle...",eteU71BreWIONFxtIsCP9Q,7,6,4,YF8iHrDsW2O19zcFnw2m-A

I have tried coming to this place during the week and after Church on Sunday and well I'd rather come here on Sunday. I feel like there is more a seafood selection available. They also have a sort of hibachi where you gather your uncooked meats, veggies and sauces and bring it to a window where they cook the food in front of you. That's a plus for me. I've tried sushi once and it was really fresh. Lots of hot entrées, desserts, fruits and salads to choose from as well.

There is a child price for kids up to 10 year it's only $4.50 at lunch. I'm not sure about dinner but its probably around 1/2 the price like it is for lunch. I can only review lunch for you because that's all I've had so far but  I will update once i get to do dinner. Anyhow the variety is awesome! The taste of the food is excellent! I was not expecting anything like this for a $9 lunch   buffet! It's most certainly well worth the money. You got eggplant, chicken wings, pizza (for the kiddos i'm sure), french fries, garlic bread, friend banana, garlic spinach, tofu and veggies, a seafood mix of shrimp, squid, and imitation crab, orange chicken, honey walnut chicken, pepper pork, fried rice, chow mein, clams(a lot of people seem to pile this very high on a plate), prawns (again I see a lot of people with this piled on a plate as well), salad bar and more. The sushi bar is awesome and fresh! The desert selection is small but to be quite honestly I never go to a chinese buffet expecting and outlandish desert section. I will say for the small selection they do have the taste is good. I did taste everything here and I have to say the flavor for all dishes are wonderful. I am also impressed with the price of drinks. They only charge $1.39 for a soda with unlimited refills. most buffets with a cheap price with always over charge on the drink. This place does not and I actually have respect for a place like that. Not to mention the service is amazing! You never have to ask for a refill they are so on it! Not one plate will be left at your table. The min you are done that plate is long gone! The manager does stand in the front kind of grumpy looking. However he does smile if you do acknowledge him with a hi and a smile! So come here and enjoy! I will say though it is a bit high in sodium. I went through 2 glasses of water there and 3 bottles of water and home and i'm still feeling thirsty. I did over do it today though. I will definitely be watching my portions from now on when eating here, it is very easy to overdo it because it's soooooo goooood! Dont waste your money getting a lunch plate at a Chinese place.

In addition to the Chinese dishes, there was also surprisingly good sushi and a Mongolian grill, where the chefs stir-fry just for you. Bonus points for the plethora of fresh fruit including Hawaiian papayas.

And speaking of Hawaiians, there were lots of local families here, judging from the bumper stickers in the parking lot. Always a good sign at any Asian restaurant.

2811874,2014-04-20,1,FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg,"As crazy as it sounds (pun intended), I am definitely a fan of Krazy Buffet. Tell me where else can you find another buffet that serves crab legs for 12.99? Besides their other location I dont remember anybody else doing the same thing. While most other places that charge you more for COLD crab legs, the ones they serve here are STEAMED. 

What's the difference you say? Well, besides the fact that you know it hasnt been sitting out from the night before, (hence refrigerating it is necessary so they can serve it again the next day and thats why a lot of places prefer to serve it cold), steaming it kills a lot of bacteria and/or any other germs that it may have with it. Most importantly, the crab meat tends to be more flavorful and moist.

Not into crab? Well they have lots of other choices like crawfish, grilled fish, clams, mussels, oysters and even sushi. Soup choices from hot n sour to egg drop. Honey shrimp, spicy chicken, chicken wings, etc. and lots more that I am not putting here simply because of the fact that you are not going to eat every individual item. What you will end up doing just like me is sampling here and there which will eventually lead you back to those items that make your taste buds happy.

A major plus for me is their Mongolian option. You put together on a plate your choice of meats which is shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken along with veggies like onions, green bell peppers, jalepenos, and mushrooms. You can top it off with minced garlic and/or chili sauce to give it that spicy kick. Then you hand it over to the cook who grills everything together until all is thoroughly cooked. He puts it on a plate for you and off you go to enjoy. What you want and how you want it to taste is obviously up to you.

Service is pretty good. They do a good job of refilling your drinks and picking up your used dishes.

Just remember the 12.99 price I am describing is for Dinner only. Here's the breakdown:
Monday through Saturdays are as follows.
Lunch: Adults are $8.29 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $4.29
Dinner: Adults $12.99 and kids 4 to 10 years old are $6.99
Sundays are all day dinner price.
Senior Citizens and Military get 10 percent off

So in closing, the food here is pretty decent for the price you pay. They have another location off of Sahara but my preference is this one because its bigger and I think the service is a lot better. So whenever you are thinking of crab legs (especially steamed), then this is the place to go for the price is decent for what you get.

Krazy Buffet has a very strong selection of items for even the picky eater in your family. They offer hibachi (my personal favourite!)

You can of course adjust how spicy it is to your liking!
They also have a wonderful selection of other foods, including great amounts of fish (dinner only) various fried/sauced items, American (such as pizza and fries for the younger ones in your party) soups, sushi, and of course desserts.

First of all, there's no customer service.  We have a child and not even asked if we needed a high chair or not.  We had to get it ourselves.

Secondly, the bottles of tapatio and tabasco sauce that were given to us had no covers.  the spout was old and crusty looking.  The tapatio bottle had a date of 3/14/13.  Keep in mind the day we ate at this place was 7/17/13.  That's like four months later and still have the bottle???

Third, the surroundings (i.e. tables, walls, blinds, etc.) were filthy.  Who would enjoy eating a meal at this place???

Fourth, water spills and male server don't even bother cleaning it up (i.e. wiping it up & drying it).  He just places napkins on it and lets us walk over it since it was litterally next to and under our table.

Fifth, lack of service.  Two servers only and it's customer chasing down the server, or serving yourself because server is not doing their job right.  The ervers are not efficient.  I've been to other places that always comes to you asking you if things are good.

Sixth, no professionalism by Manager. Gets into a confrontation w/ us ESP having to take it outside the restaurant.  He also placed the bill after just 10 minutes of sitting down.  We put it aside bc we are not done eating and Manager comes back to table and repositions bill in same spot he placed it initially.  Manager say's ""Customer is not always right"" and makes an issue about paying the $18 bill.  As a customer, why would you pay full price of a meal if you didn't get the service you deserved, unsanitary, unprofessional.  It's not about getting a free meal, it's about providing great service and assuring your customer is statisfied so they can in return come back for more business.

There are better buffet's than this place (i.e. Buffet Asia, Casino Buffets, etc.).  If you want coconut shrimp, there are better place than this place.  Bahama Breeze or Thai resturant will serve tastier coconut shrimps.  If you want sushi, you don't get FRESH sushi at these places.  They have been pre-made already and sit around until you come by and eat them.  Buffet places have low grade fish (cheap) and are frozen.  If you want an all you can eat sushi place, I recommend Sushi-Mon because it's made to order and way better than this place!

I have pictures to prove this place is not clean...Bottom line, think twice before coming to this location.  If you want food poisoning or other illnesses, continue coming here.  Never say u didn't get warned...",lpfPdC29pPETzcy7qDfx7A,7,1,1,neWqriCWAFwFs9HYgsLNpg

For what this place is (a Cheapy Chinee Buffet) it fits the bill.  Nothing served here is all that impressive, but at least for the most part the place is clean.  The pricing doesn't impress me that much either, there are other Chinee buffets around town for the same price or cheaper that have the same type of food at the same quality.  I swear, you go here do not expect Cathay House type food!  Totally different!

All the usual suspects are here at this Krazy Buffet:

Fried Rice, Chow Mein, Beef & Broccoli, Sweet & Sour Pork, Orange Chicken (which by the way Panda Express does it better haha), Egg Rolls, Egg Fu Young, Mongolian Beef, various types of faux-shi (fake 'California' roll type sushi), Won Ton soup, and Hot & Sour soup.  Quite a number of dishes.  You also have the option of a Mongolian Bar included in the price where you can pick your veggies and raw meat from the serving line and have the chef du jour (in my case a young Mexican kid named Pablito..or was it Jose?) cook them for you in a teppanyaki manner.  

For the American crowd there is the added Fried Chicken Wings (the MSG added on the ones at Buffet @ Asia make them sooooo much tastier), French Fries and pizza for the kids too.  What is it about pizza at a Chinee buffet that makes it somehow good?  Must be the cheese?  Or is some secret MSG sprinkled on top for good measure?  Hmmm....

There's a decent looking salad bar but the dessert bar is a little lacking.  Come on, I love me some mini chocolate and powdered donuts... but how Chinee is that?  And of course there is the chocolate and vanilla soft serve machine.  

Food is ok, tasty if you're hungry and on a dime budget.  It will fill you up but somehow leave you feeling empty.  Then 2 hours later you are hungry again!  I'm an Asian boy (yes, part Chinee) so I'm not trying to be racist.  This is no joke for me.  Seriously.  I ate my fill here, left feeling a lil' bit queezy.  Then a few hours later I'm hungry again!  

Of course dinner may be better but I don't know.  I'm way too cheap of a Chinee at the moment to pay $12 per person for dinner.  I feel that the options for me are better for dinner at another buffet of the same type, although I will not mention names.  But I think I might have already earlier in my review.  My bad!  

Krazy Buffet is a good option for those of you on a tiny budget, but don't have a weak stomach!  Don't go here if you've got a sensitive tummy.  I know the place touts that they don't use MSG but man is some of their food a bit on the salty side!  So be sure to get an extra glass of water in to wash it down.  And perhaps a fortune cookie too.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,5,1,3,i2SGfotIn8l8Zm6UDv9Lpw

4049970,2016-03-15,5,FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg,"Let me start off by saying I have tried both lunch and dinner and weekend for dinner is the only time to go.  Why?  Because they have oysters, crab legs, crab clusters, green shell mussels, crayfish, and clams.  In case you didn't notice - that's all seafood.  If you don't like seafood, don't bother going there for dinner.  Also don't go if you can't eat $20 worth of crab legs that you only paid $11 for.  It's not worth the price for you.  Seriously if you don't like seafood then you will not like it.  If you are a seafood snob it is also not the place for you - in other words don't bother if you ask questions like ""is this seafood responsibly sourced?"" or ""is this Salmon farm raised or line caught?"".  Just don't bother.  It's also not the place to impress a date.  Romantic? Nope.  Fancy?  Nope.  Dressy?  Wrong again.  Casual all the way.

And you have to accept this simple fact and go with it:  it's not the best place in the world to eat, but for the price it's not bad.  It has a lot of really crappy food in the pans, but it also has a few items that I really crave.  The servers work hard and are always there to take away empty plates, to bring drinks, and to take care of whatever you ask.  

I have about only ten items I eat here and I enjoy them.  I don't like their deserts. I don't like their sushi.  I occasionally eat some Mongolian BBQ.  I focus on hot and cold seafood.  Shrimp, crab, oysters, mussels, clams, crayfish, fish.  That is all.

I started off with a nice, steaming plate of Mongolian BBQ that I got to put together myself with what veggies and meat I wanted. I ended up getting noodles, beef, chicken, shrimp, sprouts, onions, mushrooms, bell pepper, and broccoli. I didn't add any sauce because when it was cooked, it came out perfectly seasoned from whatever the guy poured on the grill. The meats tasted very fresh and the beef was especially tender. A+ on the Mongolian BBQ!

I had one of each of several of the sushi choices. They had a nice array of different rolls to choose from. Very nice selection. The only thing about the sushi I can say is that a lot of them tasted the same, so they seemed to use a lot of the same ingredients (imitation crab, mainly). However, they did have a very good selection of sashimi, so you could try all the different types of meats that way.

The hot food section didn't have quite as much variety as other, bigger Asian buffets have, but what they had was delicious. I especially enjoyed the Sea Bass and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons were perfectly bite-sized and had wonderful, rich flavor. They could have used a little more crab in the rangoons, but they were delicious the way they were.

We did have to wait quite a while for our check, but the server kept our drinks refilled pretty well overall. The people working the front counter and behind the sushi/Mongolian sections were more friendly than the servers, but the servers seemed polite enough. The restaurant on the whole seemed very clean. The restroom smelled actually wonderful (weird, I know, lol) and was clean. They offer a gigantic bottle of hand sanitizer at the door, which is a nice perk. (If only they could make each person use it as they walk in! But then again, you can lead a horse to water...)

SUSHI LIMITATIONS.
I honestly enjoyed the food here since I love MSG but the ""buffet"" in their name was a misnomer on this visit because the employees and sushi chefs gave dirty looks and told me not to get a lot of sushi in the sushi station. It's funny 'cause they were cautiously staring at everyone who went to the sushi station.  ""All you can eat"" is proudly displayed on the signage outside as well as inside so it's fucking CLEAR that the sushi is also ALL YOU CAN EAT - WTF? I give them the benefit of the doubt and understand that sushi tends to cost more and the labor involved in crafting the pieces entails skill and time but if they want to limit the amount of sushi a patron can indulge in, an asterisk and disclaimer underneath the ""All you can eat"" sign would help!! :P Or don't serve sushi AT ALL if you're gonna be stingy about it - Jesus Christ!

Hell, this will be the first 1/2 star score I have given as a yelper.  

I will start out by saying that I ate at a different Krazy Buffet several months ago and it was the worst place I have ever ate food at.  I didn't have a yelp account back then but my roommate ""loved"" the place.  He convinced me to come here and I figured, ""Grand Opening, they should be trying hard to impress!""

So, I grab some orange chicken, BBQ pork, fried rice and some sweet and sour chicken to start out with (and a side of wanton soup).  The Orange chicken was luke warm and just flat out soggy with awful texture, I wasn't a fan at all.  I couldn't finish the wanton soup, the fried rice was a nice buffer to get the taste out of the orange chicken out of my mouth. And the BBQ Pork did taste like candy, which was pretty random.

So, I was unimpressed from the start.  But hey, I got to keep trying more food.  I grabbed some sushi (they actually have a decent amount of sushi selection so that's a plus), teriyaki chicken, some ""french fries"" and a couple other random selections.

I just don't know how or why all of the food I kept eating felt like I was barely experiencing any flavor.  And it's also pretty sad that my favorite thing to eat were the french fries.  Actually, I jumped the gun, the sushi did seem fresh and I did enjoy the roll with eel on top.

The service was LOL bad, I think the waiter came by once and asked us if we needed a refill.  Then as he refilled out cups, he spilled some water (somewhat noticeable) on my roommates food.  He probably didn't notice, but the waiter completely ignored what he had done then walked off.

I'm gonna stick to my hometown buffets where the food is always fresh, delicious, and very professional, for nearly half the price.  Geez, I honestly hate giving bad reviews but dammit this place caused me to write a yelp review after a 3 month hiatus.  If anyone knows of some good Chinese buffets I am all ears

Our party of five (3 adults, 1 teenager and 1 child) usually eat a little of everything at most buffets we go to and we did the same here. We shared our plates with each other and it was just awful. 

I gave this place two stars for a few reasons.
1. The wait staff is attentive, clearing plates and refilling drinks quickly. 
2. The sushi station offered several different styles, although all was made with imitation crab, Andrea one of the two edible things we found here.
3. The bbq station was by far the most edible station and we actually enjoyed eating our choices.

I have passed by this Buffet several times and never stopped for whatever reason. Today I decided to stop and check it out as I always see cars parked there which is always a good sign.

When I went inside the restaurant it was packed. Obviously this is good to see as it's an indicator of what the food might taste like.

I was seated very quickly, the gal asked me what I wanted to drink and I went straight to the food. I was surprised to see the variety of food they had, there was lots to choose from and it looked very appealing.

They had the typical sections you see at Asian buffets there was a section where you could get sushi, they had the sea food section, the desert section, and the area where you can get Mongolian style food that they can cook for you and the variety of items they had their was pretty good.

I had different items, I tasted pretty much almost everything there and I have to say the food was really good. The cost was $16.11 for one person but the quality of food was actually decent, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had crab legs,oysters, and other Seafood items.

5250920,2012-02-14,0,FykLjv4tIq618q8F2pvTKg,I am a fan of the one on Sahara which I would rate 3.5 stars as there are lots of veggies and the sushi selection is freshly made. Today was my first time at this location. It was not good at all. I will never go back. The hot food was not hot nor was it freshly prepared. It had definitely been there a while. I was a bit scared and did not take more than a bite or two of any of the dishes that I tried. The sushi rolls were not freshly prepared (rice had that harder consistency). The sesame balls were old and chewy.,krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,0,0,1,wNf5D7EE0a2_rvlWyg0oIA

So it's worth it for the sushi alone. But if you're not into sushi, don't worry they have plenty of other great stuff. They always have crab legs and they never let the legs get down to the bottom of the tray. They work hard to keep all trays stocked and I believe they have something for everyone. Including those NYC style wings that I have only been able to find in one other place here in Las Vegas. 

The place is clean and the environment is pretty laid back. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the location and the parking.",3MwccEgTNoXgc-en9e7Qzw,1,0,4,Fwa6KHAONu3jEmoEDW-QHQ

However this last time I came here with my wife and I have to say for a Friday night they were being really STINGY with the steamed crab legs.in 3 hours the brought out fresh crab 3 times. Me and my wife could hear others complaining amoungst each other at their tables near by as we sat and stalked the food restocker. The crab up on the dinner line was always just slightly more full than the water line full of broken pieces which you could very well tell contained no traces of meat left inside of the shell. My wife got ballzy and asked the food restocker for fresh crab to which we did receive fresh crab, and a fresh attitude in which the lady said ""it's the same thing, what the problem?""

I'm still sick typing this whole thing out trying not to crap my pants. Anyway, I wouldn't go back. The food was pretty yummy, but definitely not worth getting the stomach flu ever again.

First of all, it's an Asian buffet, if you like sushi and/or crab than it's  a good price, if you don't than there are better buffets for that price. Furthermore, the only way they can offer sushi and crab at these prices is if they stay off the strip and in a strip mall/shopping center where rents are cheaper, but will typically have parking issues.

The kimchy was rotten and I brought it to the hostesses attention...she brushed me off and said it smells just fine, The dude that ran the mongolian grill looked and acted as if I'm bothering him somehow..very odd.

What a mistake! We go here for the Seafood/sushi and it definitely wasnt fresh. I tried to explain it was a Monday and they were serving their ""c"" level dishes in order to boost their profit margin for the day. I said ""seriously, dont eat the seafood or the Sushi tonight"" but that didnt stop either one from getting a dish of Sushi and a plate of Oysters. 

From my side of the table I could see colors and shades that didn't belong on seafood and the musky Sea smell was over powering. 

After my warning I went back to my plate of spring rolls and spare ribs which were average and most likely past their time on the line.

The girls had stomach and digestive problems the rest of the night but me and my safe food had a great night. We only have two bathrooms so it worked out that we didnt need to fight for them.
