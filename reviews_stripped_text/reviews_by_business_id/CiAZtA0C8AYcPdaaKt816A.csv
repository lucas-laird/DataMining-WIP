40722,2014-10-15,0,CiAZtA0C8AYcPdaaKt816A,I can't believe I keep getting tricked into eating here. Their advertising money is well spent it draws me in time and time again. I ordered the famous star special and there was nothing special about it. The hockey puck burger patty mixed with the wilted veggies just did not work. Two stars is being generous.,M2YUMCkX6zp4Pktmuggj2Q,0,0,2,MUPQLHG21BRnW_qmsCGC-w

That's what I asked for, that's what the guy repeated to me and charged me for, and that's how they were labeled on the wrapper.  When I got them home, they were single Western Bacon Cheeseburgers.

I like the six dollar burger  it's 1/2 lb Blk angus beef, and with the broiled flavor it's awsome IMHO better then in&out protein burger and not as crowded :)",3dbkO9K5vcvJXuKrVu4BMA,1,0,4,rtjHmvYE9FEw5E5InUGOfQ

Now wonder there was a wait. 

I ordered a malt, and received basically thick chocolate milk. I would recommend somewhere else to order a malt and fulfill that craving. 

The burger was decent. One of my favorite things are jalapeno poppers and that came out to me warm. Usually I get it hot!",vhbyfj_g_YTjZGZh7tt5GA,0,0,1,1MjdDfOzpsTsRPCinhZeMw

One person in the kitchen. And one person running orders. They also have a line of stressed people trying to get some food and getting back to work on time. No acknowledgement or apology for the long wait. Multiple people walking out before ordering. Waiting 10 minutes in line at a fast food place before even placing an order seems a bit ridiculous. 

This location is probably losing lots of money due to poor service if it's like this everyday during lunch.",ZQusGay9YrpmVXdFQAXnRA,0,0,1,0x6dwW3hqlXTmEOqpvE8Lg

Drive thru - ""would you like to try our new cod fish sandwich?""

Me: Yes! No sauce. 

Drive thru - mumble mumble mumble

I wait a minute...nothing. I decide to drive ahead since no one is in the drive thru and only 2 cars in the lot. 

Drive thru - Yeah?

Me: I ordered the cod no sauce. 

Drive thru yells my order to the back and charges $4.52 and ""forgets"" to return the change.
