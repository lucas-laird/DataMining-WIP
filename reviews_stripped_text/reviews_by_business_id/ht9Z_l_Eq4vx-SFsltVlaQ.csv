Though their prices are reasonable and the portions are plenty, the food was just so-so. We both got BBQ Chicken plates which came with macaroni salad and free fountain drinks (which was cool). The chicken was tender, but lacking some flavor. So, it was better dipped into the teriyaki sauce they provided. The mac salad was bland and you could only taste (and see) how much mayo was in it.

Spam Musubi
Spam was cut REALLY thin and rice was piled on high. Should be renamed to ""Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam""

Seafood Combo

Shrimp Tempura
From the people that brought you ""Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam"" comes Tempura With Just a Hint of Shrimp Between Thick Coats of Fried Batter. 

Mahi Mahi
Well it's lightly battered. Lightly as in how much spam is in the Rice Musubi with just a light hint of spam. LAUGHABLY thin i mean pork cutlets don't get this thin. Let me put it this way. When i opened the takeout container i saw everything except for the mahi mahi, got the menu to confirm there was mahi mahi then got ready to call the place because they forgot to give me the mahi mahi, it turns out it was under the shrimp but i didnt see it or think about it because it's laughably thin.

BBQ Chicken
Hello? HELLO?! TASTE?! FLAVOR?! AROMA?! ANYTHING?! yeah has no taste...put some MSG on it or something

Macaroni Salad
Tastes like Mayo! (I hate mayo!)

The other plate i got is the BBQ Combo

BBQ Beef
I swear they keep a deli slicer in the back so they can slice meat as THINLY AS POSSIBLE. Texture suggests the beef is brined with a baking soda solution to give it a softer more artificial tender.

Korean style Short Rib
I cant even look at it considering how disappointed i am with everything. Since it's beef it's most likely going to have the artificial tender baking soda solution trick texture and an overpowering cheap marinade taste.

Went here the first time with a BFF.  On our visit it was nice and clean; a small hole in the wall location, they had a few booths to sit in.  We ordered the BBQ Mix plate and actually just shared it (since it was breakfast for us).  Although empty upon our arrival, the place quickly became busy.  

The second time, I ordered to-go.  Both times the food was good, but I have yet to veer away from my usual BBQ plate and try their other menu items, so for now, my review will remain at 3 stars.

Just kidding, anyhow if you've been to one L&L Hawaiian BBQ then you've been to them all . They all look the same in side and out at almost all location but this one is one of my favorites. 

I like this L&L because they always have these specials that are hand written on the paper and posted up all under the menu and temps me to order everything because everything is sooooo good! 

But this visit was a game changer. I tried something that I've seen before but put off because I didn't think anything of it. But boy oh boy was I so glad I finally tried the ""Ramen Burger"" yup you heard me, the Ramen burger. So I order that and was kindda excited and didn't know why but I was. 

We got it to go so when we got home I opened the box with so much joy and when I saw the pathetic looking thing I was disappoint. The Ramen was not as big as it looked on their ad the lettuce was wilted and I don't remember if there was any green onions on it. But that all changed really quick after I took the first bit. Yummmm it was so on point I didn't give a crap how it looked. The ramen actually held together, the burger was the right thickness and cover with just the right amount of Teriyaki sauces and the wilted lettuce, well....even they were perfect. Let me tell you I didn't miss any bun, cheese or ketchup and mustard in this burger. Believe me when I say I am going to promote the sheet out of this delicious discovery.

This location is very small, but don't let that deter you. They have a lot of specials hanging on the walls and posted on the windows. To name a few, they have Calamari - $3.99, Thai Tea - $1.99, 10 malasadas - $4, 2 eggrolls - $1.50, Spam fried rice - $5.50. I just went with the usual Chicken Katsu and Don got Mochiko Chicken. I'm glad we both decided to get mini plates because they were huge! I remember when I used to go to L&L the mini plates were actually mini. When we went yesterday, the plates were almost the size of the regular ones. Each plate is probably good for two people. We both finished a little over half and took the rest home. I'm honestly not sure if the actual portion changed or if it was the plate though because we had one scoop of rice and one scoop of mac salad each. We definitely got more meat though. 

My plate was delicious as usual. Crunchy, well cooked Katsu and tasty mac salad. I've always prefered L&L's mac salad over all the other places in Vegas. I don't know if it's because I grew up on it or if it's actually better. I like that they gave it to us in separate little containers so it stays fresh in case you want to take it home. I tried some of Don's Mochiko Chicken. It was the first time I've ever tried this type of chicken and it was good!

Forgetting items to our order, never offered to replace it when we showed the receipt.  She then has the nerve to ask, ""How long this been layering around, days!?""  I thought maybe she didn't hear us, FRIDAY NIGHT 9:45pm, we ordered our meals to go. You not only shorted us on food, you didn't want to refund the money when we had proof of purchase. Then she like, ""Who you think pays the food cost?"",  YOU DO when you MESS UP. repeat after me, the Customer is always right. Piece of work you are.  You can't expect people to NOT be upset about poor service, MISSING food and burnt food.  I wouldn't eat it. I wouldn't expect someone too.  She just didn't get it about the principle.  I really wanted to ask her would you serve that to your family member?

The price you pay you should have more passion with cooking.  I've been to other L&L locations and they have some kind of feeling when they cook because I was blown away BY THE FLAVOR.  Loaded with bbq sauce, smokey flavor. I'll just continue going to the one 9 miles away from us.  They were friendly, cooks & servers have asked us how did we like the food.  They SMILE, personable, pleasant people.

 I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt when I read bad reviews about the cashier's attitude,  I should of avoided it.  MY OWN FAULT.  Glad to of made her acquaintance.  Franchise or not you should care about what you serve to people. There's no ""picture menu"" on their franchise website, what a load of crap she fed us.

Trust this review or you will be just chewing and eating ligaments and fat that their plastic knife nor your own teeth can tear into.  I finally had to eat like a cave man, using my fingers to pull meat apart.  In addition their mac salad tastes like it was made with lard vs mayo.  You are better off going to Island Flavor.",3gaRVU1x-BY9z0V4EsFa5w,0,0,3,KVVifcvKFsqDi9EUvFi61w

Only reason I gave this place one less star is because the teriyaki sauce is a little watered down. I thought for a while that it was soy sauce. But turned it it's teriyaki. 
 But overall the place has great food and flavor",KsFc41fT8k1mvmKORz6eqg,0,0,4,hy0iJTGyccFoBegmWtaJcw

This place sucks. Everything seems like it's been cooked by a person with zero passion for his/her food. Chickens dry and soaked in teriyaki sauce, along with the rest of the bbq meats. The loco moco is bland and tastes like they used a packet of gravy from Albertsons. Curry has barely any meat in it and more sauce then anything, which is super disappointing. I grew up with authentic Hawaiian fusion food and this place doesn't come close to home. It sucks cuz I've been to l and l I Hawaii that did it right, but it seems like they didn't even try here.",NQ3cGwWWec1-P8a8AXve9g,0,0,2,2ALFfzjVFdU4VhYRqvQMZw
5809872,2017-11-03,0,ht9Z_l_Eq4vx-SFsltVlaQ,"My husband and I tried this place last night for the first time. We both ordered the BBQ Chicken Bowls, which were delicious. My only complaint is that my chicken was a bit fatty. I had to cut a good amount of fat off before I could really enjoy the bowl. The steamed veggies could have been more tender as well, but some might like their veggies on the crunchier side. You do receive an ample amount of food for the price. I couldn't finish it all. We are glad this is so close to our home. We will be back. 

Please remember to grab extra sauce!",OnlKp0BkuthhtC6igmvPyw,1,0,4,2ahveIQWeu9lxDzrxBJ64A

My fella and I shared a kalbi plate and a chicken and a spam musubi. The food was pretty plentiful. Not the best cooked or cut of kalbi I've ever had, but it did in a pinch. The mac salad (which I'm not really a fan of typically, anyway) had a little too much mayonnaise for my taste. Musubi is a solid choice, but it's hard to mess that up.

All in all, just ok. Close and it'll do in a pinch, but not the best I've ever had.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,1,1,3,z8BtqGEhGMn1KUcR2AOCwg

The food took longer than normal. And when I received my order, I kindly said, ""thanks. have a good day."" He ignored it and said next in line. No bueno.
