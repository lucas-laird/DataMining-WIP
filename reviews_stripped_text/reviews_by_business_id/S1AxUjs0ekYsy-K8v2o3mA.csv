They were behind on the sides or something...and I'm not sure if this is normal for KFC or it's just this particular location, but the food was ...unsatisfying. 

I was disappointed with the amount of salt used to season the chicken. I couldn't taste anything but salt, salt and more salt. 

The cole slaw was a bit old and overly sweet. Overall a very bad meal that I will remember long enough to avoid KFC. I'd rather have chicken at McDonald's.",c7wVtEduFIb8PRLaF5TXug,1,1,1,7rsFiVnGA1zUihyL0oFu-A

After a good ten miserable minutes the order was complete but receipt printer was suddenly down. After getting the order the cake that was supposed to come with order was not with the order. I ordered one cup for water for my daughter and they told me there are out (after I paid for four cups for sodas), I still insisted on a cup, then they offered one but $.69, after paying almost $50.00.

2016080,2014-07-13,24,S1AxUjs0ekYsy-K8v2o3mA,"Hey @KFC, I'm convinced that this is the worst KFC in Vegas, if not the world. Look at how many one star reviews this location has! I should have checked with Yelp to spare myself from the horrendous meal I just experienced.

For the record, I don't cheat on my diet often but when I do, I expect it to be both good and worth it. Not too much to ask for I don't think. After trying to go to another restaurant only to find out they were closed due to a family emergency, I wound up here. And now I'm so grossed out so much that I think I'm never coming back.

Don't go to this franchise! Whoever owns this place must be cheap and prefers to scam people instead of doing the right thing. Rather than saying they're out of gravy, they instead presented me with gravy that was the consistency of water and tried to pass that off as the real thing.

May I present you with Exhibit A? https://vine.co/v/MxbPj22t6Pl

Your honor, I rest my case.

As a last resort, I tried it hoping that at least the flavor was still there but unfortunately my gut instinct was correct. Indeed it was watered down gravy along with watered down flavor. Or maybe a disgruntled employee took a whizz in it. Who knows?! All I know is that it was disgusting! My wondering about what I had just ingested ruined my whole meal & appetite for a long time. As a result, I didn't finish eating and threw everything away. A complete waste of money as well as calories!

The manager, Jesus, was unhelpful and didn't seem to care. Overall an awful fast food experience that probably has ruined me for KFC for life. It was so bad that it inspired my very first negative fast food review. Congrats guys... this 1's for you!",ZcFB7xOpJufgX9hHPFh9mQ,28,17,1,JWuHg0ku8KcQ5KecwVQk5g
2075013,2018-06-29,1,S1AxUjs0ekYsy-K8v2o3mA,"Place is run by low energy. I ordered a meal and I sat down for a meal. Nobody in the place and the calm music was playing. Half way through the meal ADS started playing even louder then the music was playing. I asked the manger to switch stations or lower the ads and he refused. 

The chicken tenders were dry, but I ate 2 out of 3 because I was hungry and the vibe was right. 

When the commercials started blaring in my ears for 3 minutes my meal was wrecked.

To make a short story longer, long ago I once had an argument with a Egyptian security guard on a Saturday night in front of 15 people in a hot tub. Rent was 2150 a month and the hot tub closed at 10 and he was a new guy and in his country TEN MEANT TEN. He literally stood there over 15 people and waited for us to get out. We were like ok, give us 15-20 minutes like normal, but the guy didn't know how America works. 

The manager in this KFC tried to mess with my mojo. He is middle eastern and he was probably raised by strict parents first generation over. He made it his mission to NOT GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK, probably because his moral codes are different. I wasn't going to try to argue my point and explain this is America and the customer is always right! 

Over 5 bucks he wanted to get a fight outta me and disturb my peace, so instead I disturbed his.

I got him so mad as I was leaving he pulled off his headphones with a face like he wanted to kill me. Why? 

Well I told him I was going to send a private investigator to his job and he will follow him home and get the names of all his parents and grandparents and send all their names and addresses into ICE to have them deported!

They said I was being racist, but I told them I was being lawful and if you fuck with my mojo, I will fuck with yours TEN fold!

I will update if anything escalates from this situation.

MOE, I know you are reading this. If you want a fight, personal message me and we will do it in private. Can't be fighting in public for 5.50 in chicken. And you got me by 40 pounds, but I can tell it is all chicken fat. I have more gas in my left nut than you have in both lungs. PM me if you want it and you got it.

You got my 5 bucks sir! You stood your ground for the billionaire, Mr. KFC and stole the little guy's money and energy and mojo.

2250508,2016-07-22,0,S1AxUjs0ekYsy-K8v2o3mA,"Dear owner and especially customers beware.   Your posting in the drive thru with regard to the $5 if you are not given a receipt with your order is a scam and a fraud. We called your manager on this at one of our visits because we were not given a receipt.  We were very rudely handed a gift card. On our next visit we tried to use it. It was handed back to us telling us that it was ""declined""! We asked for the manager and tried explaining to him but he kept arguing with us. He finally handed us another card assuring us this one was good.  On our last visit we tried using this ""good"" card and again we were immediately and very rudely handed back this ""good"" card telling us it was ""declined""!  

So if you would like to be treated like scum of the earth and made to feel like a fool go ahead and call them on their ""$5 if not given a receipt.""  Good luck with that!  

It is quite apparent and sad that the owner of this franchise does not read these reviews or you would think something would be done to correct the many issues creating so many negative reviews!  

Dear owner, if by chance you do read these, either take the sign off your drive thru or have a meeting with your very rude crew and train them on what to do when they do screw up and have to honor the offer so the next customer is maybe treated with some dignity.",sb5_opPGQCQs7h8qzGWFzQ,1,0,1,m3kbKbWptCjsm1ao6u0VFA

This is how it goes.  You can only eat Hamburgers for so long.  Now I am talking when we need to grab a quick meal after work because we don't have time to cook.

But I try to avoid it at all costs. There have been several incidences where I've had to wait 10+ minutes for my food at the drive-thru. That is completely unacceptable for a fast food joint. The first time it happened, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was particularly busy that day. But it happened again, then again, then again... They have also cut down their menu tremendously. I used to be a big fan of their Honey BBQ wings. Now they don't even offer any sauces for their wings.

I went in trying to order a family meal and the girl ran over to check and told me they didn't have the chicken for it,  I couldn't even wait for some to be made. I order a 10 piece since she mentioned I could order the 10 piece for a lower price instead.  The lady right behind me attempts to order the same family meal and she's told that they just got the chicken in for it.   Not only that but when I checked the receipt the discount wasn't on there.   We questioned it and she told us the price was just for the 10 piece, not for any sides; it was the normal price she was trying to sell us,  I have NO idea why she'd offer that over someone trying to get a family meal.

4531050,2014-08-22,0,S1AxUjs0ekYsy-K8v2o3mA,"I never had too much trouble with this kfc until today. For starters the drive thru was incredibly long, going out into the already small parking lot which made it difficult for other traffic to get in and out. I was there probably around 7 so I get that it'll be busy since it's around dinner time, however I discovered that it was really because of the time it took to actually order and get my food.
It was incredibly frustrating to get my order through to the gentleman taking it, he had told me to wait a minute to start, which is fine! Once I started my order, it took him at least a few minutes to respond to me that he even put in what I ordered. I was starting to wonder if the speaker had broke or something cause after trying to say something numerous times there was still no response. I'd say it took at least 6 minutes just to get the order in. Never waited that long in a drive thru, ever. 
Once I got to the window, it was obvious that he was stressed and asked if I wanted anything to drink, I had told him that I didn't order any drinks and he told me ""You were waiting for a while, it's on the house"" and apologized so I definitely appreciated that gesture. He had expressed that apparently it was only him and the manager running things at the time, which is pretty ridiculous considering the fact it was around dinner time. I ended up feeling bad for him because the people behind me were clearly really frustrated since the customer 2 cars behind me were talking to the ones in the car behind me (rather loudly too) complaining about the wait.
Overall I wouldn't really recommend this restaurant, I got lucky this time with this guy cause he was pretty nice, but in the past I remember the employees having a little attitude which isn't usually appreciated from my standpoint.",iqWnJVd_RHc5lYNECgjseg,1,0,2,Xiqho6dgONFdA-y7IEMdgQ

As we we're walking out another customer had the same experience with the manager and she heard the manager raising his voice towards an associate. This kind of behavior is unbecoming of a manager.

This was truly one of the most frustrating fast food experiences ever! I decided on KFC as a quick dinner option.... so much for fast food and a quick option! By the time I got my food it was 21 minutes later! My receipt showed I paid at 6:57p- I did not leave the establishment until 7:18p!

I pulled into the drive thru and ordered one famous bowl- with the gravy on the side (so that it wouldn't get to soggy by the time I got home) the girl repeated my order and it was correct, so I proceeded to the window to continue the transaction and receive my food- when I got to the window the girl took my card and then mentioned it would be about six minutes for my food, and I said ok- she then completed the monetary transaction and asked me to pull around to the front to wait and she would bring it out when it was ready- so I did- only to see her leaving for her shift to go home ten minutes later- so I wanted another 5 before going in to check on my order- I was then ignored by three different workers to then be asked by another yelling from the back of the kitchen with an attitude ""can I help you!?""- I said that I was coming in to get my order and had my receipt- she then proceeded to get the order, and handed it to- I checked the bag, and noticed that the gravy was on the dish- so I mentioned that I had ordered it on the side- she seems a lil annoyed and they went to re-make it....
