245777,2012-05-09,1,gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg,"My father and I have been going to this restaurant since the hotel opened many moons ago.  99% of the time it is good food and good service.   They recently changed the name and some of the menu items.  I'm  all for change if it is for the better.  THIS IS NOT.
Last night we went to grab a quick bite.  The poor server was so overwhelmed doing so much without any support.  Since we go there at least 3 times a month the staff knows us.  I have seen the lack of support for their team in the last couple months and how the service has gotten so bad.  We waited for over 10 minutes for drinks, 25 minutes for the food, and another 10 minutes to get cashed out.  I saw the server running all over trying to do his best.  
The food-  I ordered the fajita chicken salad like I have many times in the past.  I was embarrassed for the company to actually put that salad on the table in front of ANY GUEST!!!  The chicken was diced up so tiny it looked like it was for a 2 year old.  Oh where was the rest of the salad.  Nothing but tiny diced up chicken and lots of lettuce.
My dad, who has had the fajitas so many times couldn't even eat one.  The chicken had no flavor, overcooked, and there were no onions.  We asked for extra and got none.  Terrible.
I have seen their business die down a lot since the new menu.  For sure now I know why.",0CFCZuSPfbmmELYVAtMa2g,0,0,1,xSv5YHbr68vmBQjVzpQGQg

I was seated at 6:42pm and we received our drinks and chips from the food runner (not our server) we finished the chips and drinks and waited and waited until 7:02pm when we finally got a refill on everything (still no server) finally got fed up and asked for our server. He finally came over at 7:05pm after asking our food runner that refilled our drinks. He took our order and left we kept waiting after that for our soup. 7:16pm still nothing and still no server and drinks and chips completely empty. We decided to leave and I asked for the manager. The guy manager think his name was Andrew came up and I told him everything. He asked where we were seating and I showed him and he just said ok. Over and over just saying ok. He obviously did not care about what was going on. I was over and just left to never come back to this place.

Where Sunset's Guad features a relaxingly lit, thematically decorated restaurant area, this one is a glaringly bright, cramped quarters affair with a cafeteria feel about it. There's a self-help salsa bar that gets extremely messy and unsanitary looking, with significantly fewer options than the other location's extensive array.

The restaurant can get very noisy and kid-tastic also.

My husband ordered a two item combo plate with a shredded beef burrito and shredded beef enchilada. He preferred the burrito over the enchilada.

Unlike the other Cabo I went to at Santa Fe, this Cabo at Boulder just seemed super off.  Kind of slow customer service from the start, long waits to get food. Yada Yada Yada.

The think that irked me a bit was that when I got the unlimited tacos, they told me I can only order 1 kind of taco and can't mix it up.  So I ended up grabbing 3 shredded beef tacos.  

They were fairly on par.  Then I ordered 2 chicken tacos since I was trying to make myself vomit by the end of the night and instead of the shredded chicken I would get at the boulder station, it was just chicken chunks, no real flavor.  And mixing it with their flavorless rice didn't boost anything.

I'm not gonna knock on the chips, I love the chips and salsa but overall that won't make me give them a 3 star rating.

The poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.

The food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.

4928893,2011-07-09,0,gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg,"While claiming to ""love locals"" from every local television outlet, we were bemused by staff comments on service at Guadalajara, the Mexican bar & grill off the casino.  With a little less than an hour to show time, we considered a quick drink and snack at the bar, followed by a casual stroll to the show room.  20 minutes after sitting at a bar table, making repeated eye contact with the wait staff, we remained ignored.  Polite initiative resulted in chips & salsa, over-sweetened  lemonade and a margarita made from an off-the-shelf mix.  Table-side guacamole 'served with warm tortillas' was served with the same chips provided with the salsa.  We heard lame excuses about a power outage, being ""very busy"" and no through-put in the kitchen.  No back-up generators in a casino?  Really?  The surly waitress might have had a bad night, but that's no excuse for being rude.  The manager was apologetic and made compensatory overtures which were appreciated.  How difficult is it to get service right from the onset when a guest enters the dining or drinking area?  After all, it's Las Vegas!

But what about ""We Love Locals!""?  Why is management so blind to the quality level of service in such a competitive environment?  Is the economy so dreadful that staff is hired without appropriate training in ""hope"" that ""things will work out""?  While Guadalajara at Boulder Station stands as an example, it's not the only venue suffering from arrogant service staff, ill equipped from a lack of training or the business values imbued from a successful and attractive destination.  Re-directing investments from TV advertising to staff training and business execution will result in more demand from word of mouth and repeat customers happy with their experience.",h9stsH2vvCmhwHdfkc_1kw,1,0,2,O5kHamAaxDn5FxW-KRqMGg

I complained and they offered a new meal, but I was so disgusted that was in my food- I was not interested in eating anything else. Found out a little later that my tooth chipped- going tomorrow to dentist for that. How does a piece of metal get into food? I hope they investigated so it won't happen again to anyone else.

5461470,2014-09-12,2,gIPrEKqnJwaAH0ZyvnQHeg,"Deep within the labyrinth of a casino, amongst the lewd smells of cigarettes and desperation lays a surprisingly tasty Mexican food restaurant! Yes, Cabo is so out of place amongst the fast food restaurants, the buffets and the other gaudy dining options in this casino, but it's still worth a look-see.  

Went here on a Sunday, wasn't that packed compared to the obscene lines at the buffet in Boulder Station. The service was remarkably slow. A bartender after a good 5 mins of us waiting for a hostess decided to seat us out of pity. It took another 10 or so mins for the waitress to come over to give us menus and tell us about the salsa bar. 
Now the salsa bar is a true pearl. I really enjoyed the black bean dip! My lawd it was tasty especially when you add in raw onions....!! The salsa bar contained different cheese, bean and other salsa dips all waiting for you to enjoy while your food is being prepared. Of course I would recommend the black bean dip as it was delightful on the buds and even more charming as it traveled down my gullet...

For my entrée I choose the Shrimp Tacos (grilled shrimp, avocado, cabbage, salsa blanca with corn tortillas) and it was paired with rice and black beans. The tacos were marvelous. Nice plump shrimp that was well seasoned, very flavorful. I event liked the cabbage over lettuce shreds as it really added to the texture of the entire dish. It was pretty darn tasty for its price point and for it to be our second choice dining option. 
We were able to pay with our hotel credits so we didn't have to worry about the bill but for 3 entrees it was less than $50 so that's reasonable. 

Besides the lackluster service, this place was pleasant! Would recommend esp if you are staying in the hotel.",Y9LH7kmYF9NyqYA3DadReA,2,2,4,jzqkrWDCpkNKb_VYbFwWEw

Got the combo platter with a chile rellano (good but tough), pork tamale (dry and super doughy, tasted like it has sat on the back of a semi for a month) and a shredded beef enchilada which was par at best. Refried beans had a weird film over them, possibly been sitting in the pot all day. Friend ordered the Shrimp Fajitas and had to return it. The shrimps were burnt beyond recognition and the whole skillet platter had about an inch of oil floating on the bottom. The best part of the meal was the free chips & salsa. Service from our waitress was poor but the soda & chip guy kept our beverages & chips full and they never went empty, saving this from a 1 star rating.

Maybe it was because it was 1/1/13 and everyone else was still partying on the strip, but we were seated immediately and had a server (Antonio) at our table within a minute.  Food was a bit slow getting to us, but well worth the wait...and we enjoyed the chips and salsa with salsa bar while waiting.  Antonio was attentive, and I appreciated he filled our glasses often.

I'm a NON smoker, and would have liked to have been seated somewhere more away from the smell of cigarettes, but that's the only real complaint I can come up with.  Including tip, $60 dinner for 4 people is exactly what I'd expect.  My salad was fresh and HUGE, my son's steak fajitas were cooked just right and not overdone, my daughter's chicken chimi platter was also HUGE and flavorful, etc etc etc.  Everything looked fresh and tasted good too.

I'll be back, but will request to be seated in a more interior location away from the chance of dealing with cigarette or cigar smoke interfering with my meal.  The proximity of the Havana Lounge nearby may have had something to do with it too!?!",R_O9tbY8RgPybQ032xY1bw,2,0,4,DtzO_OJZM8Pn6vLsFA5-aQ

The Cabo Mexican Restaurant needs to ante up (oh man, thinking about playing cards now ha)  their customer service.  My boyfriend and his family and friends and I waited more than 15 minutes to get our beverages. The Saturday night was no busy at all. The food took long too. Not sure why it was taking so long for simple quesadillas or to slap on some ground meat on a tortilla and call it a night. 

I ordered the carne asada tacos with avocado slices instead of guacamole. When my plate came I was surprised to find two sad looking dry carne asada tacos and almost 1/8"" of a slice of avocado...should of just got the guacamole huh haha.

The one thing I really liked about eating at the Cabo ""Mexican"" Restaurant was that they had a salsa and chips bar. I shoulda just gone wild and filled up on that. NExt time, I'll drink up and chip/dip it up.",TyepNPbEnMCy1_IhsT0YAg,1,0,2,yd9UYwx-ywl-Xy9paHT35A
