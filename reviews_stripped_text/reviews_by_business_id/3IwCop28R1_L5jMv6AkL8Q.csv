They usually have Groupon's so it makes it even more worth while, but I still go regardless. Better than the standard casino Hispanic restaurant, but nothing amazing.

It was about 9:45pm when I arrived with a friend we were extremely worried when we first arrived due to the fact that we were the only ones inside the restaurant we contemplated on staying but we ended up staying because the Yelp reviews were so ""great"". Bartender was nice very friendly, he didn't seem to be surprise we were the only people there, after 10 min we ordered our food I got the shrimp pizza and my friend got combo fajitas we also got the bacon rapped shrimp as an appetizer  that we heard so much about. The bacon rapped shrimp was ""ok"" it didn't taste like something you would get from a Mexican restaurant and it came with ranch to dip with ?!? I've never heard of Mexicans dipping bacon shrimp into ranch. Anyways the fajitas and the pizza were up next the fajitas were not steaming like they usually are in any other Mexican restaurant so that was automatically a turn off for me my friend gave it an overall rating of 4 out of 10 pretty tasteless and has had way better. My shrimp pizza looked amazing but that's about it the cook put way to much cheese and it over powered the thin crust and the shrimp. My over all rating would be a 6 out of 10. Overall I came to this restaurant thinking it was authentic Mexican and it's not. Maybe because it was late at night and my meal didn't matter but all I'm saying is I probably would enjoyed paying less at Robertos for more flavor. It's sad because the reviews lead me to believe that this place was ""amazing"" which I had high hopes for but this place is just average.

342364,2014-08-10,0,3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q,"This place is usually really good. Today I had the worst possible service. The waitress took about 10 minutes to take the drink order, and went to get it, and forgot a coffee, and just brought waters, she ""remembered"" and took 10 mins to come back with the coffee. She then took the order, quick and easy right, sausage and eggs, and a soup (negative ghost-rider) took over 30 minutes to get the order. She (the waitress) never came to inform what might be going on, or an apology or anything; Finally her assistant dropped off the food, and we did not see the waitress all meal long. 

BILL TIME (Chunn-chunn-Chuunnnnnnn): so I ask for the bill, and explained I have an ""Entertainment e-coupon""... she asked if she can take the phone, I asked, ""do you really need it?"" she said yes, the manager has to see it. I asked if the manager could come to the table if he needed to see it. (my phone does not need to be floating around with people I don't know, for I don't know how long). She said I will get him... yep... you guess, she forgot. I had to walk to the bar to ask for the manager (which wasn't at the bar,like the waitress said), he showed up and used the coupon and handed my bill. While I was trying to pay, I mentioned that his waitress needed some help on being a bit more attentive but its like I was talking to the dirty beer mug in front of me, because he did not acknowledge, just asked me for my card. Then, even though he was in front of a register, he decides to go to another register. I follow him, and then the only words out of his mouth are, ""sign here"" without handing me a pen. When I asked for a pen, he got one, and before the transaction could be completed, he just walked away and left me standing there. 

HORRIBLE WAITRESS, HORRIBLE MANAGER!

These are the type of employees that make people not wanna come back. 
Very disappointed, as this place is usually pretty OKAY.
Never super great, and never super bad... UNTIL TODAY!

Didn't get water until two of our group went to the kitchen and brought back cups of ice and pitchers of water. After we had been there fifty-five minutes they finally brought chips and salsa. At the 90 minute mark several people left. I was getting ready to leave as well when food showed up at 105 minute mark. I had grilled chicken nachos, which were served at that point between no longer warm but not totally cold. My iced tea arrived AFTER I finished what I could eat of the nachos. No manager ever showed up to apologize. No discount ever offered. I had avoided this place since their name change from SuperMex when they wouldn't honor Groupons, saying they were not the same. Big fat BS. When I paid my bill the bank description says SuperMex. Avoid this place. Run from the vacinity. Save your money. Go to Robertos for some Mexican fast food.

Anyways, I was having a good experience until I tried to pay for the bill with a Groupon. I guess the Groupon could only be authorized by the manager, but he took 10-20 minutes to come around to the table. After that, it took lightyears to get a new bill.

It's a nice, cozy restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. The food was delicious (ceviche appetizer, shrimp fajitas for me and chicken enchilada for my husband), and was served quickly, and our waitress was really sweet and attentive. 
I'd give it 5 starts if it wasn't for the hostess, though. She seemed annoyed that we came in. She didn't greet us, she didn't even say one word to us. When I came in she came out from the back of the restaurant where she was doing busy work, and looked at me without saying a word. I smiled and said ""hi, 2 please"". She grabbed the menus and started walking towards the tables. Again, no ""follow me please"" or ""this way"", nothing. 
She stopped at what I assumed was our table, took away the extra silverware, put the menus down, and walked away. No ""enjoy your dinner"", ""here you go"", ""your server will be right with you"", not even a ""you're welcome"" when I said ""thank you"". She literally said nothing and her body language made me wonder if I'd done something to offend her. Maybe she was having a bad day, but we all have bad days and suck it up when dealing with the public. 
So that kinda gave us a bad first impression. The food and our waitress made up for it, though.

But it is not a Qdoba or Baja Fresh either. It's somewhere in the middle, very similar to a Lindo. Plus, I've never had a bad meal here.

I wanted to check out Jalisco's ever since they bought out the Super Mex. When the Groupon came out, it provided me with just that opportunity. I can assure everyone that the food is pretty much the same quality, which is a good thing.

Let's start out with the complimentary tortilla chips. They are a wonderful balance of crispness and greasiness. The salsa is on point, with a slight kick, and fresh flavors.

I thought that the shredded meats, beef and chicken, were a little bit on the tougher side, but not by much, I still enjoyed them in their taquito, enchilada, or taco form. The sauces had well balanced flavors, and everything was well seasoned! Everything tasted very fresh as well! The guy did mess up my order a lil bit by forgetting my tortillas that were supposed to come with my queso fondito... I was about to go into Hulk smash mode, but realized that sometimes things happen, maybe not the way I expect, but in a way that makes me want to eat my hot cheese with a fork.

Juan's flaming will be my go-to spot for tex-mex cuisine. But, Jalisco's isn't too far behind, and I like the fact that this place is centrally located. A packed dining room on a Wednesday night can't be wrong as well!! They also have some killer happy hour and graveyard specials.",gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,13,8,4,TUCHFNATR1Vpk7PZppOn8Q

1983946,2013-11-21,0,3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q,"Updated review:
After my last review, I had honestly resigned to needing to find a different Mexican establishment. I was asked to give them another shot. So, we did. We went there last night (3/6) after 8pm. My husband was seated and ordered drinks while I finished up a phone call. When I finished, our orders were taken quickly and the staff was pleasant.  

We were busy snacking on the chips and salsa and playing on our phones, when we were approached by our server asking if we'd like dessert. 

I was a little confused. Generally, I like to receive dinner before checking out the dessert menu. When informed we had yet to receive our meals, we were informed they would be right out. And they were. Almost as though they had been done for fora while and we're waiting to be delivered. Hmmm. 

To make matters worse, the chicken my husband had ordered had somehow disguised itself as shredded beef. We had to wait for our server to check on us again and we got it corrected. So, I waited for him to finish as I was already done with my meal at that time.

Sorry, but I don't do 3rd strikes. We're not playing baseball here.  I would recommend finding an establishment without so many ""kinks"" to apparently work out. 

Original review: (4 months ago)
I would be willing to eat here now and then, but realistically, it's not very high on my list of places. 

The biggest change to this place is the name on the building. It is still Super Mex in all other ways. The menu is extremely similar, the food is similar in cost and flavor. I did not find a whole lot of differences. 

I agree with my husband, Chris R., that the salsa has improved and the chips seem easier as actual chips vs the rounds. I didn't mind the old style and have no preference. 

The food was decent. Nothing spectacular. My food was HOT, as in, I had to let the tortillas cool for a bit each time - but that isn't a negative. 

I guess I just didn't see much difference, but I also didn't mind Super Mex, so it's probably about the same now. Near the end of the Super Mex name, we stopped going there. We didn't have a great last experience and it takes us a while to give second chances, especially when stomach issues are involved (I have a sensitive stomach, not that there was anything MAJOR with the food). 

Like I said, aside from the signage on the building, everything is basically the same. Even my receipt still says Super Mex on it.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,0,1,0lYROl6OLcG_64Ej4KgB2A

The food I went with the Chile Verde Burrito. Talk about huge burrito. It was more burrito then plate. No joke.

During this time I witnessed a party of 6 walk out, I'm guessing because food took to long because I could see the waitress talking with the cooks (cooks looked clueless and showed no sense of urgency, actually looked mad because guest left), I then observed a server having issues with tendering a check, I over heard the guess pointing out wrong items on a split check. The employees looked as if they had no sense of direction, running in circles but not really accomplishing anything. The manager (scratched his balls and got a pat on the ass by a waitress) did not seem worried about the lose of revenue by a party of 6 walking out.

I figure that a 3 out of 5 is a place I would return to, and unfortunately, this will not make the cut.  I wanted it to be good, as it is very near where I will be moving to, and I wanted a nice close-in Mexican restaurant.  Will try and be brief:

1.  Hostess friendly, seated promptly (Sunday around 7:00 PM)
2.  Waiter quickly brought chips, salsa, and beans to table.  This was a positive, as that is my expectation at Mex restaurants.  Salsa was good, beans were lukewarm and very firm like they had been sitting drying out for a while.  Chips were just ""ok"" at best.  Couldn't quite tell if they had been fried up there that day or not.  I want HOT chips that have just been salted and evidence they had just come out of a fryer less than 10-15 min prior.
3.  Food, kinda bland.  I got a combo plate, chicken ""crispy"" taco (soggy by the time it got to me as it laying on wet lettuce), an average cheese enchilada, and average rice and beans.
4.  The ""cadillac"" margarita definitely had tequila in it, which I was impressed by, but I thought it was a fairly small glass and not real flavorful with real lime juice, etc.

So . . . will I return?  Very doubtful.  Lindo Michoachan pretty much sets the standard for food/service/presentation in Vegas, and JC gets a 4 on a 10 LM scale.  Again, regrettable as I wanted this to be a go to place for local Mex.

Same: décor, atmosphere, 24 hours, bar, etc. 

Different: menu, you can now order multiple styles of Mexican pizza, the ceviche has lobster, there is a HUGE bowl of very good albondigas, the salsa is spicier, overall, BETTER.

Still just average cuisine, and everyone stomach hurt a bit after. The cheese enchiladas were average. We did not care for the shredded beef. The ceviche was also just ok, it needed more cucumber. The soup and the nachos were the best, which is not saying much for a Mexican place. 

I wish Henderson would step their game up for authentic Mexican food. I know this is a short review but really, there isn't much to say about this place. It is decent, but that's all.

For the two years that I lived in Vegas, this was my go-to Mexican place.  That's in part because of the experience and in part because of the never-ending Groupon that's offered.  Last time I got it (just last week), you could get $20 of food for $11, and the food is already priced fairly.

One thing I found unique about this place, and I'm not sure why other Mexican places don't do it, is that they bring a bowl of refried beans with the chips and salsa.  I regularly found myself clean two bowls of those beans before ever getting my food.

I've only had one dish here: chicken enchiladas.  I get two, one red, one mole.  Mole sauce isn't an option on the menu, so you just have to ask for it.  If you love large portions, this is the perfect place to come.  I always left over-stuffed, and I rarely finished my plate.

Being both, I realized today that although mexican food tastes great, it is probably the least photogenic. It always looks like a mama bird regurgitated on my plate. Refried beans and melted cheese will never be model material, but it's what's on the inside that counts anyway, right? Get in my belly, you ugly plate you.

I ordered the 2-item combo ($9.95). You have your choice of: enchiladas, crispy/soft tacos, taquitos, or pork tamales. Some meats require an extra $1. I chose a chicken enchilada and a beef enchilada. Both were drowning in red sauce. Preferred the chicken over the beef, but even so it was nothing special. My bf got a chicken enchilada too, along with a shrimp soft taco. Shrimp tasted amazingly seasoned! Probably the only thing we both were instant fans of. Forgot to add that yes, they start you right off with complimentary chips with bean dip and salsa. 

Everyone was friendly, but service extremely slow. We saw that there were two sets of new trainees and ours didn't seem to have communication.

Jalisco's was a nice surprise with super friendly and attentive service.

Food was much better than average, warm and fresh - not overly greasy.  Chips were warm and fresh.

Did I mention the servers (of course I did, but they deserve another mention)?  Both times at Jalisco's the staff were friendly & attentive but not overbearing.  Really makes the experience so much better seeing smiling faces, pleasant voices and regularly having my water & coffee topped off.

They were like wilted sorry wet tortillas on my plate. The chicken and beef both tasted like Alpo dog food, and the taquitos were soft and wet as well. They weren't even deep fried,they were grilled. To top that off, this place focuses on filling you up with carbs instead of protein. All of their burritos have rice and beans inside them, a total sign that their gonna be cheap with their meat portions. You guys would be better off closing your doors then continuing to think that your food quality or taste is anything better than crap. Fast food chains have crispier tacos than you guys! I'm so tired of crappy restaurants popping up all over town thinking you have us fooled! You will be gone before you blink an eye; and luckily you only got $30. bucks of mine.

When we initially started going there they had a small menu but with all the basics. Now they have a very extensive menu serving and abundance of options including breakfast. Since I am such a creature of habit I always get their shrimp & lobster ceviche along their fresh guacamole. I always intend to order other items but by the time I finish indulging in the ceviche I am stuffed!

After an awful day including my car breaking down, being towed, and $$$ later....I was at Pep Boys (thats another story) and found out that my car wouldn't be done until the next day. My friend and I wandered a few stores down and saw Jalisco Cantina where we decided to grab a drink as we waited for a cab. I am SO happy we did! 

We sat in the bar area which had an awesome screen showing the Thursday night football game. The bartender was AWESOME, I think his name was Alan, and he was helpful and attentive. He suggested and explained multiple items on the menu, brought some chips and salsa, and had a great knowledge of the tequila as well. Since we didn't know when the cab would arrived, he suggested we get something to-go and we could snack on it there if they hadn't came yet which worked out perfectly!

Also, the chips and salsa were amazing. I am a huge critic of Mexican food in Las Vegas, to be honest I think most of it is horrible. Every restaurant I've been to has pretty mediocre if not bad salsa, adding things that shouldn't be in salsa. However the salsa at Jalisco was delicious! They even have a habanero salsa that is crazy hot-I may have overestimated my heat tolerance by bragging too much then eyes watering as I took a huge bite. :) hahah oops! It was still really tasty though, just super spicy which I love!

When our food finally came out it was absolutely inedible. The shrimp in my burrito was burnt, as was my boyfriends fish, chicken, and shrimp tacos...

4085941,2014-03-06,5,3IwCop28R1_L5jMv6AkL8Q,"I remember when this place was old Super Mex, so I was expecting pretty much the same. It was just a weird experience.

From the beginning, the design outside in the front is weird. I guess the symbol is supposed to be a depiction of agave, but it just looks really bad. Also, the front says 24 Hour Video Poker, which I just found strange. Yes to promoting 24 hours, NO to video poker. Just makes it seem like it's going to be really crappy bar food or something. 

The host who sat us seemed like he had no idea how to host. He just seemed lost, but it wasn't a big deal. We got seated very quickly. We were greeted by our server, Jose, who was great. He convinced us to get Margaritas in spirit of Fat Tuesday. He wasn't pushy at all, very friendly and nice. He took our order, and then came back a few minutes later to tell us that he won't be our server tonight. Poor Jose was being sent home because it was slow. It was strange as it wasn't super slow in there. It was even stranger that Jose seemed to linger on about this, almost to the point of talking down about the establishment. It was sad, I liked Jose and wanted to give him a tip but I didn't have change and he had to leave. 

We were told of the special, which sounded like Chic Parm, except substitute chicken with steak. It sounded awful so we went with Carne Asada and my friend got Shrimp tacos. My carne asada, for the price they charged, was pretty wack. You expect carne asada to be very tasty and tender. It lacked the juiciness and the tastiness of carna asada. The rice and the refried beans were good though. Shrimp tacos were all right as well.

Then it just took forever to A) get the bill and B) get the server to get the money back to pay the bill. In the meantime I had a random woman (guessing it's the owner) asking me if everything was all right. It was, it was just strange. Who are you? Are you the owner? Random patron? What is going on in this place?!

Finally got someone to pick up my check. The total was $19 and some change. I put in a twenty. I get it back and I get no change. I mean we're talking about like 50 cents or so, but really? I didn't get any change back? All right? 

I'm not mad about the experience, it was just really underwhelming. I love Mexican food. I think this place has just a major image issue. What is it? Is it an authentic Mexican restaurant with Jalisco specific recipes? Or is it like the Mexican version of PTs? Or is it Mexican version of Applebees? Is Jalisco spanish for Applebees?",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,1,2,2,6gOkz5SU7_X7WYTTxiB0zA

My first visit was on a weekday and keeping lunch to an hour was no problem. My second visit was on a Saturday afternoon and service was efficient and friendly on this visit as well.

Since I couldn't narrow my options I went for a Three Item Combination. My choices were Chile Relleno, Chicken Enchilada, Beef Taquito, and Chicken Taquito. Taquitos count as one choice. I haven't had a ton of chile rellenos, but this was my favorite so far. The flavor was great and the breading was still crispy. The taquitos were crispy and I liked the cheese on top. The red enchilada sauce was very tasty and the chicken inside was nice and tender. The beans and rice on the side were fairly standard and met my craving. 

My husband had the Torta Ahogada. This was served on a large torta bun, stuffed with carnitas, and then smothered in a red sauce. It was a fork and knife torta and my husband enjoyed it.

Pricing on their meals is more than reasonable. It ended up being a bargain for the amount of food. Jalisco's also offers coupons in the mail, Groupons on occasion, and an offer in the Entertainment Book. If you have one of these offers you'll find it to be a great deal for good food.

It would get a 1 star but the shrimp was cooked perfectly like last time. Our server this time was ramon. His service was very poor. I would rate him 2 out of 5. Not very personable at all and took forever to keep getting his attention. We actually started to ask service from a different server who was not even in our section because she was more aware than our own server. My fiancé ordered a michalota but asked for bloody mary mix instead of clamoto. They just poured the bloody mary mix half way and filled the rest with beer. There was no spices or anything. We actually needed to order a second beer so she could finish it because all the bloody mary mix was solid on the bottom and using a second beer would be able to mix it. The food minus my shrimp was a little bland today. Overall the service was awful and that's why this place gets a lower rating this time. Not sure if I will be back.

Ive been going to this place for a pretty long time. However, it was when it used to be SuperMex. tonight was my second time visiting there after they changed.  I gota say that I am not happy with the joint. Super mex used to be a great place to get a cheap and delicious bite to eat. But now its gone :( I used to go in there all the time to enjoy some delicious chicken tortilla soup for around 5 bucks.. which was a great deal. the same soup now comes in a smaller bowl and is nearly double to price. I would have to say that 9 dollars for a bowl of soup is kinda ridiculous for a place like that

The first thing I experienced upon walking in the door was the hostess who gave me a menu COVERED in salsa and food. I opened it to find red sauce just running down the page as well as beans all over it. I told her that it was gross and to give me another one.. She then rolled her eyes and walked away with it.. Never to return with a new one. Finally our server comes out (who was the only reason this place didnt get a 1 star rating) and gave me a new one. Our servers name was Lisa and she was awesome. Very nice and very efficient. She even brought out new chips and salsa without having to be asked.. which is a huge bonus for me, as I love chips and salsa.

We then order our food. I had the Mole. The Mole was very generic.. Good.. but generic. The chicken however, was terrible.. It was very tough and chewy, and had alot of fat on it. I bit into a huge chunk of fat and instantly felt sick,  You could tell the chicken was not cooked in the sauce. I would assume it was thawed out, already cooked and was just warmed up, and covered with the sauce. My gf had the enchiladas, which werent bad, but also very generic in my opinion. 

I gota say the only good reason to go there was the chips and the service.. But not for food. Which is sad because its mostly a restaurant.  It is also more expensive by far after the name change. Save your money and go elsewhere.",yzJsP6cnek8ALrQLCTfaYw,0,0,2,Y4sUDbfMyruXcvxLdC4_vA

 The Wait Staff was great, 4 Star just because one order was incorrect and it took a few extra minutes to pay our bills at the end but otherwise awesome.
The free chips, salsa and bean dip were tasty, not ""hot"" but had good flavor, chips were warm and fresh. 
Now on to the meal, the Chicken taco was full of meat, the chicken was flavorful and tender, the taco shell was not greasy, but the red sauce on it tasted like marinara sauce, it threw off the taste of the whole thing and it tasted like I was eating at an Italian restaurant. A couple of the other girls got tacos as well and found it to be strange. I ate some of the shredded beef from the enchilada and it was overly salty. The food over all was edible but if your looking for good Mexican food or Mexican food period, I say skip this place. 
Prices were pretty equal to most Mexican restaurants. We ordered ahead of time so we had plenty of time to get there, eat and get back to work in an hour.

Our server was very sweet and attentive. She immediately got us chips and their delicious salsa while she took our drink order. I opted for the house margarita which I was pleased to see came with a shot of orange liquor on the side as if I ordered a Cadillac. I'm not complaining! Although not traditional, my eye stumbled upon a chicken bacon burrito which I couldn't say no too! It was delicious but the service was almost too good as the chips were immediately refilled and I ate too many so I was already full by the time my extremely generous sized burrito arrived. Lucky for me I love leftovers!

On a side note, the have a decent sized bar with a big screen tv. Looked like a great spot to have happy hour or catch a ball game!",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,12,9,5,6QX_AkBulimsGJnZdaQdrQ

I have to say that I still miss Super Mex (Sorry management. This is not your fault.). But I am getting over the fact that they're gone and Jalisco is now here instead. But, I can say that I took my Mom to Lindo Michoacan today for Father's Day and we both agreed that the food there still wasn't as good as it is here as Jalisco Cantina. Oh and the manager here insisted that the grilled veggie burrito wasn't on the Super Mex menu, but I beg to differ.

They got extra points for that. 

Their margaritas looked awesome but sadly I was sick and couldn't experience one for myself. Will def go back to try one out next time.

For my meal I got the chicken enchiladas and man were they delicious. The red sauce was homemade, chicken was top quality and just enough of everything to melt in my mouth. They were cool about me getting double beans and no rice. Extra points for that. Very nice size portion too-for 8 bucks I was full.

The waitress hated her job, you could just tell, she wasn't terrible, I mean she served our needs and all, but she certainly didn't feing joy in doing it. It was a big turn iff to the place honestly. We got our drinks, one of which was a Margarita, it tasted like it had no alcohol in it at all. I rarely drink, so if I have a strong drink it will effect me very quickly, I drank the majority of it in an empty stomach and felt nothing, I don't think there was even a full shot in there.  The food came, presentation wasn't great, but whatever,  it's Mexican food so no biggy. The food was very good, I'd say a step above robertos, but a step below chapalas. Prices were high for food, it was almost  $13 for a burrito.  I was glad we had the groupon ti save us a little money. The margarita was surprisingly cheap at $5.95, but I would much rather pay $8.95 and have some liquor in it honestly. Husband played a few bucks in the machine in the bar and said the bartender was keeping busy but didn't have too good of customer service either. The manager appeared to be running around in a poor mood with an upset look on his face which may explain the poor attitude of the staff, with the exception of the hostess who was great, but just before we left he was over there messing with her about something and pointing around tge restaurant while he complained that she didn't seat someone fast enough, so I'm sure it won't be long til she's got the same attitude as the rest of them. Probably won't go back, I'd rather pay half the price at robertos and get the same level of customer service, or pay the same price or less at chapalas and get amazing customer service",En7f89rLinVHhSUvdGYj5w,1,1,3,9OSD2xmG_MWCX92GP1qvCQ

First the chips, beans, and salsa that they bring out to start are amazing! 
We usually come with a party of four or more today it was six and we decided it was great the last three times it was now time to bring my mom and dad (very picky mexicans lol) 
We ordered 2 Green smothered burritos that were perfectly seasoned and sauced. Asada quesadilla that was so dank I truly tried to finish but was so big I could only get half down. Combo plate with 2 tacos ground beef; 1 hard 1 soft they were I quote ""the best seasoned ground beef tacos, I am shocked I liked them so much!"". Another combo plate with chili relleno, asada enchilada, and a shrimp soft taco, you just cant go wrong with any of the food we tried. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. Enchilada with asada we just had to try since they dont usally go hand in hand and were surprisingly good but the asada is still the money ticket. Relleno was great and not soggy like some places.... beware this makes for a very hot plate. Lol Our 6 person was smart he knew the portions are big so he got to try everyones. 
Over all my family was very happy with the quality of the food and service oh and my Dad said the music is legit too. Oh and my Mom said this place is so much better than all the ""LINDO"" places around town. Lol We will be back for the delicioso food.

Tonight we had the seafood enchiladas and the chimichangas, Uriel had the carne while I had the ground beef.  Every thing looked and tasted great as usual. Of course we always eat our fare share of chips and fantastic spicy salsa.
Since it is made fresh daily sometime the jalapenos are a little spicy. The hotter the better.

Last night, the wife and I went to Jalisco for dinner. We were seated quickly enough. The chips and salsa were brought right out. We even had our drink order taken quickly. Our server, Esmerelda, appeared shortly thereafter and took our order. 

My order: 3 Combination plate - Cheese enchilada, Shredded Chicken Enchilada, Shredded Chicken Crunchy Taco and all rice, no beans.

30 minutes later, Esmerelda stops by the table and asks us if we would like dessert. Ummm, I would prefer dinner first. She had a look of confusion flash across her face, glanced at the kitchen, the fear of realizing she had left our food in the window for who knows how long flashed next, before she said our food would be right out.

Imagine that, 30 seconds later, our plates were brought out. My ""crunchy"" taco was soggy, fell apart the moment I lifted it up. The kicker? Shredded beef, not chicken. Ok, I'll eat the rest, while we wait for her to check on us. First enchilada I dove into, also shredded beef. Seriously guys? 30 minutes and you send out poorly made, wrong food?

Finally, Esmerelda stops back by, we show her how everything was wrong with my food. She says they'll get me the right food out right away.

While waiting for that food to arrive, I give the cheese enchilada a try. What could they do wrong with that, you ask? Somehow, the cheese was chewy. Not standard cheesy deliciousness chewy, but did they put some gum, or old tire in the cheese chewy. 

After a much shorter than 30 minute wait, a plate with a chicken enchilada, actual crunchy taco, rice and beans was delivered to the table. By then, I was a little over the entire experience and tired of chewing, after consuming the cheese enchilada.

The last two items were decent, not good, but decent. 

Needless to say, Jalisco is not on my list of places to eat again. Ever. 

This happened on a Thursday evening, they had maybe 3 other tables when we got there, no big rush leaving or entering at any time when we were there, so it wasn't like we got lost in the shuffle. 

Also, having a Yelp logo asking for reviews on the menu is bad form. May want to double check the Terms of Service on Yelp before you do your next run of menus. I didn't notice it until the server was picking up our menus, else I'd have photo'd it.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,3,0,2,6SiJg-FQf53m1uQ-yxvuvg

Mexican shrimp crema pizza, Fantastic! Tons of fresh peppers, cheesy.
Shared a 3 item combo plate.
Cheese enchilada , so far the BEST I have had. and I am not joking I have had many enchiladas all over Vegas. This one was thick, not overly sauced, the cheese was like an Armenian stripper thick but firm and creamy. Oh my so gooooood
Other item was carne asada crisp taco, meat was very good, nice helping of fresh guacamole.
Other item was pork tamale, white corn garlic meat filling.

None of the meat was related in any of the dishes,nothing makes me more disappointed than eating the same shredded crap thats in the taco is in the tamale, and the burrito. NOT the case here!! Everything seems to be made different. Special flavors for each. With a reasonable price.

Bonus points for Christy (I hope I got that name right) who did an excellent job organizing the tables, and getting the food out. She did a nice job handling everything for the group. 

The food was delicious, I had the same 2 street tacos I had before and they tasted as good or better. I heard plenty of compliments for the food around the table too, only one person wasn't too happy with their taco salad.

Pros:
Prices are very affordable.
Value Menu has good options. $7-$9

Regular menu is affordable $8+

Customer Service is nothing outstanding but it is good. 

Cons:

Food is very bland. No taste whatsoever. 
Very average. Full plate portions to fill you up? Yes.

The ambiance here features wood furniture and is fittingly reminiscent of a Mexican cantina.  Right out of the gate we were served complimentary Tortilla Chips accompanied by a tasty homemade salsa and addictive mild Bean Dip.  As an extra app, I ordered Bacon-Wrapped Shrimp for the table, which is  a crunchy delicacy here.  Diane enjoyed hers plain, while I accepted the bacon-enrobed shrimps the way they are normally cooked here--covered in rich and dark mole.

For mains, I selected a plump and filling Casero Burrito Chile Verde covered with melted cheese and Verde Sauce, accompanied by a homemade Crispy Shredded Beef Taco.  Both were delicious.  And the Cheese Quesadilla filled with shrimp ordered by Diane oozed with gooey yellow melted cheese and bristled with tender camarons.  There is surely no scrimping on major ingredients here!

Service by our waiter Jareth was excellent, and we were treated warmly by the manager and all staffers even though we were not familiar to them.  We hope to become so in the near future whenever we are craving fine authentic Mexican cuisine.
