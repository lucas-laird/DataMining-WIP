166031,2010-08-16,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"My friend and I called ahead to see if they had a lunch buffet on Sunday. The person who answered the phone was prompt and courteous. He confirmed that they had a Sunday buffet for $11.99. I asked if there were any vegetarian dishes. He said yes, and then rattled off a half a dozen of them off the top of his head. Great!  We're on our way.

This place is located just off of the strip -- don't walk it though. It seems to cater to locals and adventurous tourists and California visitors looking for good Indian food (like me). The area is a little run down, definitely not the pride of Vegas. Buffets are common in this town, even in off-strip restaurants, where even all-you-can-eat sushi is the norm. 

India Palace has been completely remodeled inside and out since I was last there a few years ago. I think that even the assphalt parking lot was new.  The new space is awesome inside. It's very nice and well appointed.  Trendy, somewhat techno Indian music adds to a well-designed layout with dark wood tables, cozy booths, and a nice central bar area.

The lunch buffet was great! Lots of veggie stuff to choose from. Little to no vegan though -- hard to find with Indian food since ghee and cream are staples.

They also must be paying attention to some Yelpers since the service was great.   The service was fast and friendly and hot naan hit our table about as fast as it takes to cook it.  And, yes, you can get the matriarch to smile when you smile at her and compliment her naan (which *was* fantastic!)

197797,2013-05-13,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"My boyfriend and I came here on a Groupon, and after reviewing the menu I was really excited to try this place. At first, everything was really nice. When we were being seated, the host told us a party of 50 was coming in, and that the back room might be quieter, which it was. The back room has 4 tables and is a nice intimate setting. Note, that in the time we were there, one tour bus full of tourists came in, ate, left, and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving. The bus loads of people appeared constant, and if we had sat in the main dining room, it might have been miserable. 

But anyway. Everything we ate tasted really good. We ordered a goat dish, a lamb dish, and samosas. The veggie samosas were kind of bland, and only had potato in them, but tasted fine. When we ordered it was a little weird that the waiter asked us what kind of rice and naan we wanted, as if it came with our meal, when in fact it didn't. I've never been to an indian restaurant that charged extra for rice, so I thought that was a little shady. 

But really none of that mattered, because towards the end of our meal, we found a hair in our food. A short, curly, kind of hair. We showed the manager. His response was ""do you want some more rice? I can get you some free rice to go? I'll take 10% off of your bill, mistakes happen, it probably came from the buffet."" Um, number one, we didn't eat from the buffet, and number two, DUDE there is a pubic hair in our food. While I appreciate him taking a little bit off of the bill, what I would really prefer is for him to look disgusted, and go back to his kitchen and have a very serious talk with his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness. But I had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen, and he just sort of acted like, oh these things happen sometimes. Maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head?

So, even though the food tasted good, and up until that point we had been having a nice time, I really don't think I can get past a pubic hair in my food. We won't be back.",BruI-D395yclzw0Xc1-dAg,2,0,2,TucwqmOAYDT4jhEcKgGzaQ

So let me start my part of experience here. Me and my friends went here reading all the nice yelp reviews. We ordered some appetizers, some sabji, naan and MYSORE MASALA DOSA.

The waiter took our order and asked us if we want the sabji spicy or medium spicy. We said medium spicy would be good. So he brings everything from starter to the sabji and naan in order. The starters were okay and sabji was totally bland. We could easily say, since I have some cooking experience, that the mixed vegetable sabji was made out of frozen ready made cut vegetables, partially cooked and lacking all the spices that make it Indian. But we did not complain because we thought that it might be because we said medium spicy.

So, after we all but my poor friend who had ordered the DOSA, were done with our lunch, they bring the DOSA. The sambhar is sour like lemonade (we did not complain about it), but the MYSORE DOSA is full of red chilli powder. She, could barely eat two pieces of it. So, we call the waiter and tell him that we find it too spicy. He starts explaining us that we don't know what an actual MYSORE MASALA tastes like. And tells us that since we have not eaten an actual MYSORE MASALA in the city of MYSORE in INDIA we should not complain about it. So,  I informed him that I am from India and I have eaten MYSORE MASALA for more than 25 years and yes in MYSORE too and its never this spicy. He made faces and so I told him that its their mistake because they should have mentioned that it is very spicy in their menu. So, he got a bit scared and offered us some complimentary dessert, which we obviously denied and left the place paying for everything, with bad taste in our mouth.",5ZsvnPv5d__f7n2xGbhJVA,7,1,1,jglXbFkQ7P72-4Fl8r49Rg

Having returned from a 3wk trip in northern India about a month ago, I was disappointed with the food.
* Mattar Paneer was alright - the peas seemed to be the frozen kind, very sweet.
* Chicken curry was too salty
* Goat Rogan Josh was good
* Rice and Garlic Naan were good.

We weren't thrilled about the neighborhood as we drove in, but we've been pleasantly surprised by other great restaurants nearby. The exterior of the building is a nice modern look, and the smell coming over us in the parking lot - just amazing. The interior is beautiful, and the TV's playing Bollywood were kitschy, but fun.

Our waiter was fabulous. Attentive, helpful, and great suggestions, but never overbearing. We ordered the appetizer sampler. Tasty samosas, great fried cheese, and the Bombay fish just blew us out of the water. Light breading, great seasoning on the fish, and just overall fantastic.

For entrees we got the Dal Lamb and the Lamb Rogan Josh. Both were phenomenal. The Dal Lamb is reminiscent of a chili dish with the lentils and kind of dark spices. The Rogan Josh was perfectly creamy and spiced. We ordered both mild, not knowing what kind of scale of heat the kitchen was on. These were REALLY mild. We definitely should have gone at least medium. Next time for sure! For sides we had the garlic naan and the peas pulao rice. The rice has so much in it, and was just wonderful, and the garlic naan was perfectly toasted. Both were great compliments to the entrees, and were suggested by the waiter. He had great taste!

We ordered combo appetizer, goat with spinach curry and chicken pasanda

The combo appetizer came without fish which was part of menu. The server served the dish minus  fish saying that he replaced fish with vegetable pakora. What he should have done is to return to us and say that the combo platter could not be completed and whether we would to order some other item or we would like  it as he wants to serve.  This was  poor customer service.  Cost $8:95/- Did not get complete order.

Regards, chicken pasanda.  I have taken this food on many, many occasions in past, infact I grew up eating chicken pasanda. I've never taken chicken pasanda like the one served. It seems the chef does not know what chicken pasanda is and so does not know  to cook it. What is served something which they  call chicken pasanda, but not quite, this is unfortunate. Cost above $15/-. Don't try it.  You will leave frustrated

Regards, goat curry with spinach.  To call this dish disappointing is an understatement.  The goat dish has 95%  bone and 5% meat, mixed with puree of spinach.  Cost above $15/-.  Do not even think of trying this dish.  You will leave frustrated.
No rice or naan was served with any of the above dish.  Poor customer service management.

I agree the service can border on being overly attentive at times.  Everybody is warm and friendly and eager to have you as a guest.  I can heartily recommend India Palace to both vegetarians and carnivores alike.  I've visited with a large group of vegetarians and there were nothing but compliments.  So now the food:

The thing to start with, especially with a group is the assorted naan breads.  My favorites include Keema which is naan with minced lamb, Garlic and Poori which is fried whole wheat bread.  The naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions.  When you have naan, your entree of choice with the aromatic Basmati rice you have a very generous serving of food.

No matter what you order, I recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries.  I'm not a vegetarian, but enjoy the spices of the Channa (chickpeas) Masala.  The goat Saag in spinach and herb is delicious.  The meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks.  I can say that about the chicken and lamb as well.

To top it off, India Palace serves a great selection of beers from India including Hayward 5000, Taj Mahal and King Fisher.  I find Taj Mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting, and it goes well if you like your food spicy.

Bottom line: very attentive service, delicious variety, very tender, very juicy meats and Indian beer.  You can tell the ingredients are high quality and worth the upscale price.",Rcdd0Xl9dyEOTHb42x58Lw,0,0,5,bAqR0L7TmLdcu0Fch95EzQ

730155,2011-07-08,1,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"India Palace is the best Indian Restaurant to my taste in Las Vegas.

I have been going here for the past 8 years and have not once felt the food to be unsatisfactory and only once have I found one of the staff members to be difficult (He hasn't been there for years, however.).

To understand the reasons why they are the best would take me the better part of a book, so with the exception of a few highlights, I will encourage you to experience this food experience for yourself - altogether a more satisfying experience than reading any review!

First off, since they are a ubiquitous and primary form of Indian Food consumption, I have to rave about their lunch buffet.  At about $13, India Palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over Mint (which is more Nepalese, if I'm not mistaken), Mt. Everest or India Oven, but not even Ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety.  Every day there is a pilaf, lentils, Tandoori Chicken, a Saag dish, a Korma, a Tikka, a Masala, a Salad, both Mango Custard and Kheer, Naan and Sauces (Raita, Tamarind, Mint and a few others.).  For a vegetarian, this is one of the best buffets for you.  The break down always has at least 4-5 vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils - most others are not nearly as diverse.  For the carnivore, the selection is by no means meager - at least 1-2 chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish.  Alone, the spread is great, but, having eaten here dozens of times, I have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that I can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food.  This can't be said, in my opinion, of others.  

Secondly, I find, despite the opinions of others, the dinner to be reasonably priced for the quality.  If you consider that Indian restaurants are usually priced well-above other non-European, Ethnic cuisines, it is easy to think of them as pricey, but the complexity of Indian curries and the time-to-cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak.  Also, if you consider the consistent quality of the food, India Palace is worth the extra buck you MIGHT pay over Bollywood or Mint.  Additionally, I find them to be cheaper than Tamba or Origin.

What can I say, I'm a huge fan!",Og5Uu8lxOTnTT6dQmxFmzg,4,1,5,UX_zctgQ87t6Tg-L3i2l_w

It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night.  There were only a few other patrons, which is a shame because our experience at India Palace was great.  As other Yelpers mention, they are located near the Strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood.  I wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners, but I digress.
They served papadum and 3 different dipping sauces when we sat down, which was very nice.
We started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer.  The shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all.  They were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas.  I thought it was wonderful with the date sauce (the dark brown one) on it.
We ordered the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala for entrees.  Both were very good.  The chicken was very tender.  The entrees didn't come with rice, as has been our experience at most Indian restaurants, so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic naan.  I loved the rice with peas and nuts in it.  The garlic naan was also very good and not greasy at all.
Service was attentive and all the staff very friendly.  The restaurant was neat and clean.  There were TVs playing Bollywood which was fun.  They weren't on too loud and I always find it hard to not watch!  Our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers.  If we weren't so full, I would have liked to try their dessert menu.

847553,2011-09-06,1,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"I never know what I will get when I go to India Palace.  Will the rice be crunchy and dry?  Will it take the waiter 30 minutes to give me my check after my plates are cleared?  Will I get stabbed? Generally, the answer is no, which makes it one of the better Indian spots in town.

But, don't get too excited. The lunch buffet is the only reason to come here.  Dinner is incredibly overpriced ($20 for a vegetarian platter is crazy, crazy).   Why spend $15-20 for one bland dish for dinner when you can get the lunch AYCE selection of bland dishes for less than $20?.  Save your dinner pennies for something better -- this is not the best Indian you will ever have, no matter what the Review Journal says.

Bright spots on the menu include Lamb Korma (lamb in a creamy, coconuty sauce), Aloo Gobi (sauteed potatoes and cauliflower) and Saag Paneer (creamed spinach with homemade cheese).   I also like their renovations, they've greatly improved the atmosphere.

Sad spots include burned naan, rather bland food, small servings of rice (with dinner entrees), and dirty looks from waiters when ordering mixed pickles and chutney (I have no idea what that's all about either).

The renovations make it quite lovely inside -- used to be pretty drab.  We had the buffet and I had honestly forgotten how much it cost so was pretty surprised to get the bill:  under $25 for two!!  

The rogan josh is out-of-this world, but everything on the buffet is delicious.  The flavors are wonderfully blended and some of the dishes are moderately spicy but not hot-hot.  The naan is included which, as you may know, can add quite a bit to the cost of your meal if you order from the menu.  

I've been to several other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and India Palace has never disappointed.  My friend was suitably impressed and is looking forward to going there again on her next visit.  And am I being anti-PC to say that we were the only non-Indians in the restaurant that afternoon?  That speaks well of the place.

This is where I come when I'm craving my mom's homemade Indian food as this is the best place for North Indian food in Las Vegas.

Las Vegas has several options, but if you're craving fresh North Indian food, this is your spot. It used to be a hole in the wall years ago, and a bit less pricey, but they've stepped up their decor big time and have a small but classy bar setup now. They expanded their seating space as well, allowing for large groups; call ahead and request one of their private rooms that can be curtained off (I would estimate it seats between 6-12 guests, depending on the room).

You'll smell your usual Indian spices in the air, making you hungry. Worry not though, while waiting for your food you have both the papad they serve complimentary and Indian music videos playing on a pair of flat screens.

And when the food comes out, you will have no regrets no matter the choice. All around great food served in large portions. Of the 100 times I have been here, I have only literally had one bad experience. That's awesome.

Average vegetarian dish costs $13. Compared to other Indian spots in town (especially Tamba), this is a great deal for much better quality food. It's worth the trek from the strip!",yFQNlR7wEcZVt9YNj9qj-w,1,0,4,oBnVgVcYEMoZ45h-C6czKQ

He offered a beer from India for ua to try, but I has to kindly refuse . I asked him what was better to try, the mango lassi or shake. He recommended the lassi with such confidence, I knew I was going to enjoy it..:) it is basically fresh mango purée with yoghurt as the base, somewhat of a milkshake, but with a definate yoghurt taste. I enjoyed it very much and wish I could buy it at the store

We started with the flat breads and chutneys..an Indian version of chips and salsa,!! 
We had ordered the vegetarian samosas, lamb curry, aloo gabi and the fragrant rice! Oh and the garlic naan was so goooodddd!

No wonder this place can survive after all these years, the food is excellent, and servers genuine and attentive!! I hope to keep coming here!!!!

Thank You India Palace!",voNl6rXo9c-NuYIBIj5AQg,0,0,5,_97QAmPyjeFGdsQg3zs5_g

Our server, Manny, was extremely attentive and kind. 

For dinner, I had the lamb tikka masala which I will definitely be craving from now on!! The peas pulao were also delicious, and I think the naan was the best I've ever had. My friends' said they really enjoyed their dishes too. For dessert, we got the Gulab Jamun, and my friend said it was just liker her mother makes it, which is hard to find. I had never had it before, but I enjoye it -- kind of like a light doughnut hole floating in a honey sauce that wasn't overly sweet.

The food just arrived.  The tikka masala was great, the seekh kabobs were ok but not exactly spiced right. Tikka gets 4 stars and seekh 3.5 stars. One of the waiters came by my table and asked me what I thought about the Indian food in England vs. the Indian food in the US.

I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.

Wow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.

I went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for ""hot""! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.

When I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.

Service are really bad and people are not friendly. It seems that if you are not Indian then you are not welcomed there .

Place smell strong , I must say I unpleasant smell . I think they need to turn on there extracting system or replace it. .

I must I have been in many Indian Resturant in my life 

In the following countries 

1- United Kingdom where the Indian food popular as the Mexican food here in the date 
2- Germany where I come from .
3- Arab countries .
5- Spain
6- Belgium only once 

Never ever paid for their rice that come with the stew .
Actually most of the food is served with rice . If you would like to order extra rice then you must pay that extra .

The same with bread if it order Tindory ( Indian barbecue version)

Those guys ripped me off with both .

Now let us talk about food 
Although all what I mentioned about my negative experience the food was good. I would give them honestly for the food only 3 and half star. 

But sadly the whole night was destroyed by this in ethical and very cheap way of running business   . I don't think that everyone Indian place is like that at all. And I will keep going to the honest one . 

I will also adjust a picture from the recipe to support my review .

And one of the waiter was nice Out of 4 

Hope that my review will be helpful .

En español 
No es buena experiencia para nada , el lugar Huelva feo feo y tratan la venta muy mal . Mejor aprender indo antes de irte. Se tratan a los de ellos en otra maniera

1370580,2014-05-02,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"First off this review is for the so-called 'Customer Service' here, so let me begin. 

My friend and I had been waiting all week to finally come to this spot to try Indian for the first time.  I had read all the great reviews about the Chicken Tikka Masala and how good the garlic naan was so we were pretty excited about it.

As we entered we weren't really greeted politely, we were kind of looked at like we were lost.  I asked the waiter if we could have a table for 2, so he pointed and said booth 3, so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to.  We sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said ""you're here for the buffet right?"" We looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so I asked him if we were able to order from the menu, he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them over.

My friend and I were already set on ordering ourselves the Chicken Tikka Masala because of the great reviews and the garlic naan as well. We waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet.  I politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet.  He then described all the choices, I asked if the chicken tikka masala was available and he had said no, I also had asked if the garlic naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out.  He was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted.  So he took our order of 2 Chicken Tikka Masalas and the Garlic Naan.

I then asked about the free Mango Lassi you receive if you check in on yelp.  My friend and I both showed our check-ins, then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free Mango Lassi (which was NOT stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for 1 person. SO if you're going with a friend or friends, be prepared that only ONE of you will get a free Mango Lassi if you check in here)

During the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and let's us know our food will be ready soon, or to re-fill our water cups or to check in on us at all.  

Finally our food comes out and it's a pretty small bowl of the Chicken Tikka Masala, a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like 5 ounces of their sauce and spices, but it smells delicious, then a basket of the naan which really wasn't much since we both shared two pieces each, and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us. (I thought per order of a dish you get your own rice, but I thought wrong.)

Food definitely 5 Stars.  Being a first timer I was satisfied, but for the price of 2 bowls of chicken tikka masala, sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic naan (which came out to be a little over $20 each) I'm disappointed.  Not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave us a lunch size meal. 

All in all my friend and I both enjoyed the Flavors of Indian food for the first time, but will probably NEVER come back here again.",lJGYe2Jzxff5hxQAXFLohw,4,1,2,zvRSUimTydE4UQeIV5dOPQ

I had placed my order over the phone not knowing what to expect flavor-wise but following my motto of ""try something new every day!"" ... once I entered inside the restaurant was jam-packed which I took as a sign of great food!

Ricky greeted me, took down my name, asked if I had ever been there before and made me feel welcome. Although I was just ordering a variety of my fav appetizers he asked if I was using any of the discounts offered thru the app. I suggested that I'd save those for a larger order and he mentioned if I do use it in the future to ask for him for any additional discounts that can be offered!

Also, Ricky reminded me of my ""free mango lassi with check-in"" ... he was very prompt with their Yelp offerings and I appreciate that! After all that's how I found them. 

Quality and flavors of the food are easily 5 stars in my book! and I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future. 

The only downside is that the parking lot is small and there were a ton of taxi cabs picking up & dropping off. space is limited but once you taste the food you'll understand why.

I ordered a ""plain lassi"" assuming it to be salted lassi and the old waiter assumed it to be sweet lassi and so i asked him to get me what i wanted.

For takeout, I'd give this spot between 2-3 stars. Portions are small for the price and protein is minimal. Our $16 goat curry had a scant amount of meat and I found only four small chunks of cheese in my saag paneer. But the tandoori wings are amazing, with grilled peppers and onions, with lemon. But to spend just under $50 with tip for takeout for two? It's not great.

The buffet is their best deal. Good selection, variety of vegetarian options as well as multiple meat (lamb, goat, chicken) options. Service is attentive and friendly. Naan is included. There's even a small bar area and they appear to have beer and wine. I'm pretty sure you can rent this spot out for special events.

Averaging my experiences together, I can't rave but it's kind of a gem for this neighborhood. Snag a Groupon while they're still up and you can save a bit on dine-in (not valid for buffets) or takeout (minimal discount).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,6,3,rQPf8bgx0-_SrvgHxwL1DQ

This is what you get at India palace. I was awestruck at finding such sumptuous Indian food in Vegas.....Hats off to the chef. If you love Indian food or would like to try it, don't waste your taste buds at any just masala & curry Indian restaurant....But go enjoy the true preparation of Indian cuisine @ India Palace as you will truly discover the true indian food preparation that will take you on an epic food rendezvous.

Items selected:

- Masala Dosa: Thin crispy rice crepes filled with deliciously spiced potatoes & onions
- Chicken Tikka Masala: Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce
- Mango Lassi: Check-in bonus!

For Dosa, my all time favorite has been http://www.dosasf.com in SF, but India Palace does it in a different way. More crispy and lighter, which was really good!

Chicken Tikka Masala was also very good, and the naan was tasty. For basic items, execution is everything and they did quite well. Fresh and hot, no stale leftovers we usually see in lunch buffet were observed.

It now belongs to India Palace in Las Vegas, NV!  It is located a mile east of the Strip.  The neighborhood seems run-down but the restaurant is beautfully decorated and modern-looking.  
The flavours of the chicken tikka masala were perfect.  I ordered mine spicy and it had just the right amount of kick.  It was unanimous within our group of Indian Food-Lovers that this was the best place we've had yet.  The waiter recommended the rice dish Pea Pulao, which contained white basmati rice, peas, yellow raisins, and either peanuts or cashews (can't remember.)  He said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice.  It was good also, but I prefer the plain rice.  The naan was perfect as well (but who could mess that up?)  I am sad that it is so far away because I can't eat it often, but luckily I visit Las Vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it.

FOOD:
Mixed Veggie Pakora (4 stars): Not too oily so you don't feel too guilty. 

Naan (4 stars): Fluffy and yummy. This was actually really good here!

Chicken Tikka (4 stars): Juicy and moist chicken, really good. I'd recommend this. 

Mixed vegetables (1 star): Burnt vegetables. No flavor! I can't even believe they would serve this. The veggies were half black from being burnt. 

Requested a scrambled egg curry (3.5 stars): Was more of just dry scrambled eggs, didn't have a curry sauce. We asked for a curry sauce on the side and it made it taste better. 

SERVICE (4 stars):
The guy helping us was really nice. Listened to what we wanted and kept saying he understood our special requests but when the curry and sauces we requested came out they weren't what we wanted. So, I think he just thought he knew what we wanted. He did try though which was nice.

We are both vegetarians and loved that there were plenty of delicious options for us.  We had veggie samosas, vegetable biryani, red daal, saag aloo, and baigan bartha.  The bartha is rich and smoky tasting.  The daal was creamy and lucious.  Everything was spicy enough to get your taste buds excited but not so overwhelming as to make it painful.

We left with plenty to take home and snack on for the next two days.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, we enjoyed the bollywood music videos playing around us.  I knocked off one star for service.

It's tucked off in a little shopping area, but well lit and easy to find. It's got a great, cozy interior with roomy booths and Indian movies playing constantly. It has a full bar also!

Checked in using my Yelp app and received a free drink called a mango lassi. I would never have known to ask for this had I not gotten this check-in offer, but I'm so glad I did. It was seriously delicious. It's mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason I couldn't eat all of my food. Highly recommend you get this fabulous drink!

For an appetizer we had vegetable samosas. They were dense and a little dry, but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine. You get two and they're a nice size. 

For dinner my friend had chicken tikka masala, which, while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice. He liked it and proceeded to eat all of it. I had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy (medium) with a rich tomato-y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese. Had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling. One of my favorite dishes.

Also ordered a side of garlic naan which was okay. It wasn't the best I've ever had, way too much garlic, but it was find and went okay with the meal. 

The service here can be spotty, I wasn't impressed with that at all, but it's not the worst I've had, so...

I chose IP since it was the closest and with car rental already returned I was walking it. Plus of my options it had the highest rating.

I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which the menu describes as ""Kashmiri delicacy cooked with intensely hot & fragrant spices"" which it was but it did not compete well with the LRJ I had in Philly. 

I did have something called 'Temrin Sauce' with the very thin wafer type cracker not Naan but if you've eaten Indian you know what my brain doesn't  but the Temrin Sauce was a treat t remember.

The goin out the door on IP is, I'm looking for a repeat of my LRJ experience in Philly and it could be IP's is more authentic and I'm simply DUH.

Further more when they never came back to check on our table or refill our waters. Throughout the whole meal and time we were here the servers were clearing the tables which is normal but the kicker was they didn't do it in a quite discrete manner they were slamming cups and plates down to the point where we could not even here our conversation. 

When we were finally ready for the to go boxes and the check we had to flag him down yet again and wait another 10 mins or so for the boxes and when receiving our check it was charged wrong.

Appetizer Combo - Samosa, Aloo Tikki, Veggie, Chicken and Paneer Pakora. This was the first plate that came out. Duh, it's an appetizer. It's pretty decent and sharing it with two people is good enough.I enjoyed the samosa and the paneer pakora the most. 

Chicken Tikka Masala and Fish Tikka Masala with plain Basmati Rice. Ok, so the entree is where my heart somewhat melts. Got them both at medium spicy. It was too much gravy-yyy and not enough meat. Meat - gravy ratio: 1:3.

Funny that when it arrived 45 minutes later in a small container with no receipt that the driver mysteriously had no change. For a cash only place, one would think the driver has change. Oh well, $40 for a $20 meal that was barely par level in flavor. Driver told me, "" next time say you don't want a delivery fee. "" Do you think I'm that stupid? Wow... There's not gonna be a next time! For a few extra dollars, people really know how to ruin a fair review. Although the portion was small. I found a clump of dried herbs in my mouth. Yuck. And really just OK but might be fooled into it tasting good if the driver wasn't so sneaky. And this is the highest reviewed in local area?

India Palace is probably my 2nd favorite right now but it's probably still a 3.5 star place. It's located on the south side of Twain some where between Swenson and Paradise.  It's not in the best locations but it's not that far from the Strip or University which is always good.

They offer a lunch buffet M-F for pretty much the same price as every other Indian lunch buffet north of $10. The selections aren't huge but for what they offered mostly delicious. Again I'm not that experienced with Indian food so I don't even know what the dishes are called so I made a plate of everything I liked and took a pic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/india-palace-las-vegas?select=vWiliowVruUMaseO6VB4sA#HZgrIxObIsFSwoe5_ea8lQ There were a couple dishes which seemed spicier than the other places I've been to and I really enjoyed. The garlic naan here was the best I've had. The red chicken was spicy just the way I liked it. There's potential to be my favorite place but I couldn't, I only really liked maybe 3 or 4 of the items on the buffet.

At the time there was a free lassi with Yelp check-in unfortunately they only accepted one for our entire party but I got it haha. The mango lassi was good, great way to end the meal.

The interior is nice with many tables and a few TV's playing Indian movies. It seemed like a pretty full bar. Their parking situation isn't great. Sevice was alright. I'd be back, during day.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,1,3,YUvvUvpXohi1FlDN0MWBSg

We ordered goat briyani, malai kofta, garlic naan, and mango lassi.

The meal started with the typical papadum and chutneys. The tamarind chutney was pretty decent. I'm not a big fan of tamarind, but this was better than the tamarind chutneys I've tried elsewhere. The mint chutney was also pretty good. They also had a pepper chutney which had a nice kick.

My wife thought the mango lassi was almost as great as at her favorite Indian restaurant.

The garlic naan was good. Not too burnt or chewy which I've found to be the case at many Indian restaurants.

The goat briyani was really good. It had a nice mix of flavors and textures. My wife really liked it until I told her it was goat. (She doesn't like goat and I ordered it while she wasn't listening.)

The briyani came with raita which was decent. 

The malai kofta was also enjoyable. The sauce was very flavorful and the ""vegetable meatballs"" had a nice texture.

You know, the myth of putting something in all of the food that makes you full fast so you don't eat as much and waste any food?

I am not sure if I would come back, considering that the lunch buffet is $11.99. The waiter also had poor listening skills.  The bill was

The naan was fluffy and perfectly cooked (not burnt, not hard/stale) and had great flavor. We're not normally huge fans of chicken tikka masala, but it's a safe dish. We thought India Palace's CTM was really good-- not too sweet and not too much cream. The chicken was cubed and tender white meat. The dal was good too; I think next time we order it we will increase the spice level! Maybe you don't care about rice reviews, but the order of rice you receive is large and fresh-- I thought it was worth the price compared to other places I've ordered from around town.

All of that changed after my first experience at India Palace. To be honest, I've only eaten at two Indian Restaurants in my life. After eating here, I'm not sure I will venture elsewhere. 

So on a lonely afternoon my wife and I decided to ditch our co-workers and meet for lunch. Fortunately India Palace had a Yelp dealio going down where you get $30 of grub for $20, a stellar deal. No restrictions were mentioned upon purchase, however when I presented the coupon the server said it was only valid for dinner. After explaining there were no restrictions mentioned in the disclaimer or at the time of purchase he graciously accepted the coupon and we enjoyed their lunch buffet with two refreshing pepsi-cola beverages. I'm a huge fan of their tandoori chicken, but the meal wouldn't be complete without their piping hot, freshly baked nan. I could honestly make a meal just out of that. My favorite item at the buffet is the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is tandoori chicken marinated in yogurt & spices in a creamy tomato sauce. It's 8:45am and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I even enjoyed a serving of their creamy spinach, Popeye would be proud.

The service at India Palace is always exceptional. The servers are friendly and attentive, your drink never stays empty for long, plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion, and I always leave here feeling good about my experience and reminded as to why I've never gone to any other Indian restaurant. 5 glowing stars!",6mYfeB7ZxsgNq0Peyt_eFg,1,0,5,7mjpRm9OSdoRJMuPoFU4ig

Also, just to throw this out there, I work with many Indian people, and they really like this place a lot as well. Take that information as you will, but, I think it's a good thing. 

I've been coming here for a very long time and I'm friendly with the staff. They are SO polite and friendly. I have always felt very welcomed here since the beginning. 

The food, let's just talk about the food. It's amazing. My favorite being of course the chicken mahkani (butter chicken). It's easily one of my favorite things to eat, ever. They bring you naan bread to the table with an option of regular of garlic. Always go with the garlic, it's not very overwhelming. 

I also do the buffet every time I come here. I've eaten here for dinner twice and while I really do love the food, I feel their dinner portions are rather small when compared to the price. One of these times I used a Groupon and was never met with any kind of negativity, so it's weird to me that people are mentioning that. And as far as the rest of the service, I've never had issues with being neglected service or having my water filled, even when they're busy and hosting a party. 

Anyway, the buffet is great because you get a sampling of a lot of different things for a low price which is never a bad thing. 

Also, I give it a 4 star rating because as much as I love the food, I really hate driving here. It's in a not so lovely part of town and the parking here is a nightmare when they're busy.

I think India Palace is akin to the Kevin Bacon of Indian buffet restaurants since a google search for ""India Palace restaurant"" will yield one in virtually every state across the US despite not representing a franchise of any sort.  Yet the prevalence of Indian restaurants bearing this particular name is as longstanding and prolific as the consistent film career that spawned Kevin Bacon's namesake movie trivia game.  

The various elements sampled and experienced on my first time visit displayed a versatility much like the individual character performances that has made Kevin Bacon ubiquitous across the cinematic landscape:

Splashing debut (""Animal House"")-As a fraternity pledge that captured Hollywood's attention, the free mango lassi with checkin on Yelp will be sure to capture yours

Over-the-top (""Footloose"")- Like his rebellious city teen persona Ren McCormack, enjoy racy song and dance numbers with Bollywood films playing on an endless loop amongst TV screens in the background while you eat.

Solid/reliable supporting actor (""Mystic River""/""A Few Good Men"")- not necessarily the leading role like a Sean Penn or a Tom Cruise,  but the mini samosas are a solid appetizer with the right ratio of filling to dough enhanced with a few drizzles of tamarind and mint chutney. 

Chillingly good performance (""Sleepers"")- availability of chaat in the cold section of the buffet line 

Overdone (""Hollow Man"")- As scientist Sebastian Caine, ""Yeah! If I die, pretend the last words I said were real deep and clever.""  If I'm hungry, I'll pretend the tandoori chicken was not dry and overcooked 

Lukewarm(""Picture Perfect"")- a performance as uninspiring as the the saag paneer with an unattractive layer of oil floating on top

Risky(""Tremors"")- mixed reviews from critics regarding his role in this subtle comedy/sci-fi thriller, but reminds me of the risk one partakes in consuming the fruit in the salad bar since I'd be afraid of any underground postprandial ""rumblings"" within one's GI tract.

Ridiculous (""The Air Up There"")- the presence of macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets on the buffet line is as preposterous as the plot of this movie starring Kevin Bacon as a college basketball coach venturing deep into Africa to pursue a tribesman whom he discovered while watching a home movie...words fail.   

If you're a newbie to Indian cuisine, the fare at India Palace provides a good primer to classic Indian restaurant fare, but for a seasoned veteran, my top choices in town would still be Mt. Everest and Delhi Cuisine.   Kevin Bacon once summed up his career with the quote ""I think of myself more as a workhorse actor. It will be hot and cold and up and down, but no one will kick me out of the business""  Pretty much sums up how I feel about this establishment.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,11,13,3,93mvODb_zvmaLo2TUBLecg

The only thing that was said by one of the waiter's was... ""We haven't seen one of those type of bugs here since our bug problem back in October,  I guess we need to spray again"". I could not believe it, normally a Manager would have come over and a least apologized and offered to comp our meal or offer a discount or even dessert. NOT a common practice here at India Palace, where the Bug's are KING!
I will definitely NOT be back to experience your over priced food

The first time I visit an Indian restaurant I stick with certain dishes. I ordered the malai kofta, chicken tikka masala, samosas, and garlic naan bread. The naan bread was the best part of the meal. It was well made and came out piping out. The samosas were so oily that I barely touched then. The malai kofta had a nice flavor, but I did not enjoy the chicken tikka masala at all. It tasted a little like feet. 

My meal wasn't terrible but I didn't like that they charged for both the rice and the naan bread. One is usually complimentary when you order an entree.

Warning: You really do come out of there smelling heavily scented with the spices... but not in a good way.... unless you like wearing Eau De La India afterwards.

So, onto the food:
Veggie Samosas:  The skin was a bit thick.  Not puffy & airy like I'm used to.

Sambar Vada:  The fried lentil donut had a very thick texture.  I've never this before, but I would've enjoyed it more if it tasted less dense.  The sambar had a nice flavor.  I don't think I could've eaten the donut without it.

Mom ordered the Tandoori Chicken dinner:
The chicken is less smoky and had less tandoori seasoning than other places.  (Those of you used to smoky & lots of seasoning will be disappointed.)  The white meat was cooked perfectly, but the dark meat was a bit underdone near the bones.
The dinner came with saag paneer (good), mixed veggies (spices didn't agree with me... something with a ginseng taste in it & I don't think they pulled the sinewy parts off the snap peas), and soup (flavorless).  The mango custard never came & we didn't bother to ask because we were too full.

I ordered the Chicken Sagwala.  Well, for $14.95, you would expect to get more than just a few chunks of chicken.   The bowl was just slightly a bit larger than the side dish of saag paneer my Mom received with her dinner.   

Garlic Naan:  good

Service was alright, not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes, she was amazing! I think she may have been one of the owners. Just amazingly warm and friendly, wish she was our server the whole time.

The tvs and sound system were playing Bollywood music videos which was pretty fun! They do have a full bar! Oh and be sure to check in, we got a free mango lassi. 

On to the dishes..

Chicken Tikka - Moist, fragrant, flavorful and oh so tender!

Chicken Tikka Masala - Big bold flavors, creamy and again insanely tender.

Malai Kofta - Similar to the Chicken Masala though not as spicy. Balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy. 

Garlic Naan - Lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces. 

Basmati Rice - Another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes.

I must have missed that fine print on my phone and upon calling the restaurant to inquire they said I'd have to take it up with uber eats. So $43 for glorified and mediocre chicken wings and basically a reheated lamb curry stew and these guys are happy to point fingers at the delivery service they have chosen to use. I suspect, given the restaurant's proximity to the strip, most of it's customers are tourists and the trouble with tourist joints is they don't have to live on repeat business so can afford to serve mediocre food and tell you ""too bad"" when you complain about it.

Even though there are a few on the west side of town, I always willingly and happily drive from summerlin all the way across town to eat at Cafe India. 

Their curries are flavorful, well-balanced and have morsels of tender meat - everything I look for in a curry. There have been a few times they didn't quite get the spice level right but they are more than willing to bring you additional hot peppers or even take it back to the kitchen. The tandoori chicken is simply heavenly, very juicy and soft. Just beware that if you do have it during their fabulous lunch buffet hours that it might be a tad drier than if you order it as an dinner entree.

And have I mentioned how great their lunch buffet is? $10 (I believe) and you get mango custard, lamb vindaloo (sometimes) and that spinach one that I really like.... and chicken marsala, tandoori chicken, naan, rice etc. Basically there's going to be more than what you can eat!

Their only downfall is their inconsistent service. Now it's not bad, but sometimes they can come off as brisk or they get very busy and it takes a while to be noticed. However, whenever that happens, their manager always noticed and would make amends, which makes it alright in my eyes.

3303885,2014-04-24,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"India Palace has been my go-to Indian food spot for a while now. I stick to lunch buffets as I don't really mess with dinner at most Indian restaurants; its usually just the same served a la carte at higher prices. 

Palace along with majority of the all the Indian restaurants in town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of UNLV. While the area might suck, IP is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit. 

Going into a Indian lunch buffet I know exactly what I want to eat: chicken tikka (the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce), saag (spinch dip with extra butter), samosas, rice and naan. Based of this, India Palace delivers a great lunch buffet. The food is refreshed regularly (frequency depends on how busy it is) and the quality has been consistent. My one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request more.

The restaurant as I mentioned is pretty nice, recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible. Service is average, they've messed up my check several times and I have had to call them out on it every time.

3427219,2018-02-28,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"Firstly, I'm not Indian nor do I consider myself an expert on Indian cuisine. However, at this point I have tried enough places to know how I like it as far as the staples. I really wanted some Indian food before I left Vegas. Decided based on the reviews and menu that this would be the place I'd give a go. Came here around the time they open and had the lunch buffet.

Pros
Paneer Chilli was delicious. I've had paneer before but never spicy like this. I'm not a huge spicy food fan but this was the best thing I tasted here.

Garlic naan brought to the table was good. Some places make garlic naan with really big chunks of garlic which means you're biting directly into the garlic when you chew it. This was baked into the naan and the perfect size. Sprinkled with a little bit of cilantro, which I love. 

Food was fresh and well seasoned

Gulab Jamun was really good.

Cons

While the goat was well seasoned, it tasted a bit too chewy. 

I came here, rather than other places, because I saw Gulab Jamun and Gajjar Halwa on the menu. Neither were part of the desert portion of the buffet unfortunately. I ended up getting both to go. I just started eating gajar halwa. This was ok but the one I had in MD was better. It wasn't as smooth and creamy. 

Tandoori chicken was seasoned well but a tad dry. Still decent but dry.

Neighborhood is a bit sketchy. Didn't bother me much but I'd be careful.


Overall, I liked it. Wouldnt go out of my way to get it but if I was in the area I'd definitely go back",o9fr9sqYRCUwekf8P8Zpbw,0,0,4,367eMG-Dthn1_Uh6vOYeoQ

3459515,2010-07-19,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"It's a rather sad thing that I don't frequent Indian restaurants. Being ethnically Indian, I should be galloping to the nearest Indian place to gorge on the curries and breads but I never do. The first reason is that for the most part, the Indian buffets or restaurants leave me with a very uneasy stomach. The second reason is that a lot of Indian restaurants leave something to be desired in the hygiene department. 

I'm happy to say that India Palace has somewhat alleviated my prejudices against Indian restaurants (esp the ones in Las Vegas). We went on a Sunday afternoon. They serve a lunch buffet (12/13 bucks) every day. The restaurant was packed! And it was quite well decorated...muted romantic colors, nice lighting...wow..a refreshing change from the usual Indian buffet experience. 

One of my friends' went for the buffet which had about 10 dishes and a multitude of salads, yogurt dipping sauces and deserts. My husband has partaken in the buffet before and both of them had only good things to say about the buffet. 

As I was feeling not too hungry, I decided to have something from their dosa menu. I ordered an onion and chili oothapam (thick pancake made from fermented idli/dosa batter. The batter needs to have a distinct sour taste and it is topped generously with onion/veggies or whatever you fancy). This was served with a Sambar and coconut chutney. The oothapam itself was pretty good and the Sambar although definitely not authentic traditional South Indian sambar, certainly tasted good. My friend had a paper dosa which was crisp and tasty and my husband had the mysore masala dosa (dosa stuffed with a spicy potato masala with some spicy chutney in it). 

I was pretty stoked to eat South Indian dosas in Vegas and have it taste good and be seated in a relatively nice establishment. 

The service was a bit crazy..they had about 5 waiters/waitresses and no one was wearing any sort of uniform. All the wait staff were Indian and so were the customers...imagine my confusion and uncertainty when calling for service. 

My husband also had the chai and said it was really good. He didn't leave any for me to try so I'd have to take his word for it. I ordered coffee...although not the traditional filter coffee served in South India, the combination of the coffee and dosa made for a very satisfying lunch. 

I'd definitely go back for their dosa offerings.",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,2,1,4,IIEIL3rIW47zdz6lbRxtIg

The chutneys were weird and it was hard to track down a server when we needed a drink refill or something.

Prices went up, I guess to pay for all the upgrades. Things went downhill. Last visit, about two years ago, we were disgusted when the waiter tried to scam us on the bill. Believe me: it was not a misunderstanding. It was a trick. Every Indian restaurant serves rice with the (already overpriced) entrees. Not here. Waiter asked if we wanted rice; we said of course. But when we got the bill, they charged us for an expensive rice dish, not regular rice. So we did not go back all this time. Went back again now, same thing. Tried to charge us for papadum refill, which every other Indian restaurant serves complimentary, like bread. Then, asked us if we wanted peas in our rice, which was a sneaky way of trying to upsell us once again. Then, when I confronted the server, he didn't try to listen to me at all. He argued and defended their policy, and said that's just the way it is. Then he told me he is the manager! When I told him every other place will include rice, refill papadum, etc, he said they were number one in Las Vegas, and he did not care what other places were doing. Personally, I don't care if an entree costs $10, $20, whatever. If I order it, then I pay for it, and it was my choice. But I hate to be nickeled and dimed. And obviously, I don't want to be scammed. So, I would never go back. I will inform everyone I know what happened (I am a local). I will blog and Yelp and let the public know what they are doing (BE WARNED), and how management is treating customers. Mint and Mt. Everest are FAR better choices for Indian food in Las Vegas.

3540667,2010-09-28,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"This review is for their lunch buffet.

I was so lucky today.  The buffet had my favorite entree and dessert, all for about $10, which normally would have cost me close to $20 easily.  

-Goat Karahi:  The meat was so tender and flavorful. Place a piece of this delicate meat on a piece of naan, add some white onions and a squeeze of lemon...what do you get?  Yummy yummy in my tummy!

-Kheer: Traditional rice pudding made with basmati rice, milk, sugar & saffron.  I can eat 2 bowls of this easily.  So DeliCious.

They constantly bring out naan to you when your basket gets low.

Aside from these 2 awesome things that I eat from the buffet line, they also offer other dishes like the pakora, aloo gobi, chicken tandoori, and many other dishes and desserts (my friend had mango custard and she said it was very good...I vowed to try it next time by not overstuffing myself with the kheer).  Their menu changes though.  The other time that I was here, instead of the goat karahi, they had lamb vindaloo.  Instead of kheer, they had gulab jamun (milk cheese balls soaked in a honey syrup), which was a sad day for me :(.  I expressed to the server with a pout, indicating that I would much prefer the kheer.  Next thing you know, he brought out a serving of kheer just for me!  Yay to the awesome server!

Therefore, if there are certain items that you like, you might want to call ahead to check out what's on their line.  Other than that, if you feel adventurous, please check this place out. I will definitely come back!",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,2,1,4,pzZLSbfHyNcUySrKWTTK8w

Ordered Take Out of Appetizer Combo which includes ( Scrumptious samosas, Fish, Pakora and Paneer). Fish was fishy. I asked for Goat Curry and ended up with Karahi Goat which was full of flavor and huge portion. I ordered it medium spicy because I appreciate the heat.

I though it was $12.95 for the buffet but apparently it was only $11.95. Had 2 buffets and a drink for less than the $20 for $30 Yelp voucher I had purchaed. Enjoyed all the food I tried, but the naan stood out as really good. Great value restaurant and a great vibe. Thanks, Vic!",1O638BDK_fWuxgTVJwff-A,1,0,5,YyDCeKhiOCkqTTbgRy7Z9g

The only reason for not giving India Palace 5-stars, is the lighting. The last few times that I've visited, the lights are up all the way during dinner service. It's nice to have a slightly dimly lit ambiance during dinner service. When I asked the sever about it, he told me that they leave the lights up because some can't read the menu if they aren't up all the way. Maybe spend $20 on a few pen lights for the 1 out of 50 people that can't read in dim light? Seems like a better solution than compromising the environment for every one else.

We ordered the Mysore dosa and the Masala dosa and they were just alright. The dosas were too thick and the filling very average. The sambhar was nice, but the chutney smelled old.

The ambience is OK but place is nice and clean. They don't have too many parking spots. It took us a while to find parking at 9:00 pm. 

I would have still given 3 stars except for the behaviour of one specific staff. 

They has a free mango shake deal going on when we purchased the 15 for 30 deal. When my husband went to pay, one employee told him that he should have mentioned the free shake earlier and that he would charge us for it since we already had it. He said ""since you ate your meal already it is a done deal"".  My husband showed him the purchase receipt on his smartphone. 

Having to argue/discuss this with the employee, and put up with rubbish, when the deal is clearly posted on Yelp, was painful. My husband had to insist strongly a few times before the employee corrected the bill. 

During this process, the employee tried several wisecracks at  my husband, which of course he failed at miserably. The least we expect at a restaurant is courtesy and we do not put up with mocks and jibes at any cost. 

The person who took our order and served our meal was very respectful and kind, so was the rest of the staff.

The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.

While I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.

Here's what I tried:

Vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice
goat curry - nice spice and very tasty
saag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing
basmati rice - standard
naan - plain and good
chana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness
bhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor
navratan lorna - good
karahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice
chicken tikka masala - excellent
ras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast

Lest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.

We ordered a Groupon   and called in and explained that we had a groupon worth $30  and ordered  some food to go.  I clearly explained my groupon... and there was no problem with the TO Go order from the employee on the phone who was polite.

 After driving 20 Miles.... we arrived.  The manager said the Groupon is for dining in only.  I said... why did they not tell me that on the phone... as I told them I had a Groupon.... anyway... he did not want to  honor the promotion.. then I asked him his name... and he wouldn't tell me his name... He said they don't make any money on the Groupon...

 I said...then why do you offer it?   .... that is not my problem.... I bought it... ordered. and then drove 20 miles... and now he is not wanting to honor the promotion.   

Did you read the fine print ?  he asked..No I said.... instead, I called your restaurant and explained that I had a Groupon and they took my order.... and I in good faith came all this way expecting a smile and a thank you... and now I get a No.... and he was very  mean to me... disrespectful... not being considerate at all...

Of course this upset me..... and I began to raise my voice..... Then he was upset that I raised my voice in his restaurant.... I told him... I did not come here to raise my voice... I came here for some Tikka Masala... but I will never come here again... trust me.....

It is unfortunate... that they have such good food here....yet... the Manager is a hothead, and I feel sorry for the employees that have to work for him.  The poor guy that took my order... oh my.... he is going to get the wrath!

He did not want to listen to anything I said.... In spite of it all I still tipped him $3 just because I am someone that has worked in the Restaurant industry, and I follow the golden rule... but I will tell you, this Manager was a real jerk.

Now....there are  so many restaurants out there that would love to have a customer that drives 20 miles to come to them... and they will do everything in their power to make that customer feel special.

4132144,2011-11-02,8,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"Well...

On a whim my friends and I were looking for a good place to eat and someone suggested India Palace. Having heard the good reviews over the years, we decided to give it a try. I checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with 'check-in' on the app you get 1 free appetizer or cocktail with purchase. The reviews were also favorable so in we went. We arrived at 5pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly. 

I noticed on signage that there were Happy Hour specials until 6pm so I asked the hostess about them. She replied, ""Happy Hour? Why not? .. You can get buy 1 get one free on appetizers. "" Great, It was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered. 

We had Veggie and Lamb Samosas, very nice as well as a few other items including garlic naan bread, Chicken Briyani, (Chicken mixed with Basmati rice with spices, cashews & vegetables) and Chicken Tikka Masala, (Tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt & spices, simmered in a creamy tomato sauce.) Pretty standard stuff. We even opted for some traditional desserts and Indian Beer.

All in all the food was really good and tasty and I was very satisfied and full. Service was a bit off, but I think that may have been due to the language barrier, and sometimes the server would suggest an item, and then bring something else. In this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different. It wasn't a huge deal as the beers were good and 3 of us were sharing so they went fast.

What was strange was when the bill arrived, I asked again about the Happy Hour specials, as the bill had not been adjusted. Our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no idea what I was talking about. I got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials, (she was the one that said ""why not"",) and she acted as though she didn't know what I was talking about.. then reluctantly adjusted the bill. 

The 'new' server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me. Possibly for asking about the discount? I don't know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check. We paid and left. 

I would go again, possibly for a buffet situation, as I wasn't completely satisfied with the service, but the food was very good. I think at least one of my friends wouldn't return due to the service. We weren't asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit. Like I said though, we liked the food, so who knows :)

You should know that India Palace is on a very sketchy part of Twain Ave. It is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant. No less than 4 police cars with sirens blaring were pulling 3 guys out of a car next door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint. I mention it, because I know the neighborhood well, and this has to be one of the less savory sections. I just wouldn't want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking lot.

It was a rainy night in October of 2010 and I had a Groupon half priced offer.  So I grabbed a friend and went.  He had tried Indian previously and knew to order the garlic naan.  Delicious.  He ordered Tikka Masala.  I ordered Chicken Sagwala.  Both were quite good.  I ordered mine with medium spice.  It provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy.  Though I did need some Tums shortly after.  The meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something I can best describe as Indian chips and salsa.  Crispy little pieces of flat bread with three different sauces.  One was very strong with the red chili flavor.  One was heavy on the mint.  The third I recall as being sweeter and almost fruity.  All very good.  I was surprised at how much food I received.  I was very full afterwards.  I had to walk around the Boulevard Mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop (see my review for Hofbrauhaus).  After eating at India Palace, I knew I was hooked.  The flavors are intense but balanced so well.  I drive by some times when in the University neighborhood and I am always tempted to stop in. I am usually short on time and cash though.

I put in my order and the waiter handed me a receipt and stated it was my check without having swiped my card. I didn't understand what this meant, so I asked should I swipe my card. The waiter again said the paper he handed me was my check and stared at me funny. I still didn't understand so I gave him my card. The waiter swiped it aggressively and stated it was declined. The waiter did the same thing with my boyfriend's card. My boyfriend finally asked the waiter could he do the swiping himself and guess what? Card approved!

But the buffet was damn good. I don't eat much meat, but I just drizzled the sauces from the meat dishes all over my rice and sopped up with naan (flat bread). I agree with the other reviews that the naan was a little burnt, but maybe that's intentional? It was still fluffy and I kind of like my foods on the charred side anyways. Adds character. The naan is not on the buffet line, but a waiter will drop it on your table, I'm assuming so it doesn't dry out under the lamps of the buffet. Nice touch, Indians. 

The meatball sauce was awesome, on the sweet side and I went back for seconds and thirds. The saag paneer (spinach and cheese) was also good. But the paneer cubes were scant. 

The Kahari Goat (house favorite) was a little on the salty side, but still good. On the dinner menu, this dish is $15. 

The kheer (rice pudding) was good, too. Not too sweet, but still sweeter than others I've had. 

Their samosas were okay (I like Samosa Factory's mo bettah). They offer a couple different chutneys. Cilantro and ... mango maybe?

They also served raita, chicken tandoori, aloo tikki (little fried potato chunks, like Indian tater tots), and mango custard. Everything I had was yummy. 

They have a fat seafood menu, too, but no seafood dishes were offered in the buffet. At least not when we went. 

Their dinner menu looks out of control good. I'm gonna have to go back. A lot. 

The buffet had a really good variety for only $13. 

Manfriend got a salt lassi, which was not too salty. $2-3. 

For two buffets and one drink, the bill came out to $30. 

The restaurant is in a free-standing building on Twain, east of Paradise. Dangerously close to school. Small parking lot. 

The interior was surprisingly well-decorated. There's elaborate wood carvings and Indian illustrations decorating the walls. The walls are painted flat planes of colors, similar to Indian spices. The restaurant is pleasantly under lit. They don't just sport the name ""fine Indian cuisine"" for fun. Tables are elegantly set up with linens and all that fancy crap. Waitstaff is nicely dressed in uniform. 

The bar is constructed with a solid dark wood and there's a large flat screen behind the bar playing shitty Bollywood movies, no audio. 

The nice decor is surprising because most authentically ethnic restaurants are designed as an after thought. Like in old country. 

When we went in (lunch time on a Monday), we were only the second party. By the time we left, there were about eight parties.

They have an extensive menu, so we tried the Aloo Tikki appetizer, and it was four tasty fried cakes and very good. Then, we ordered the basic items we use to tell one restaurant from another.

The Lamb Korma is great, with more lamb than most others, and the lamb is very tasty and tender. There is enough sauce, so you can have just sauce and rice, too. Yummy. The Chicken Tikki Marsala is very tender, again with more chicken than usual. Very good sauce. The garlic naan is perfect. Very lightly crispy on the surface, and chewy inside, with a dusting of herbs for good looks. 

You know, every dish here is pretty, too.

They make a firm vodka martini, and the recommended Taj Mahal beer was just right.

This is the perfect example of a hole in the wall. You would never expect to find a restaurant so fancy inside from where these guys are located. They have a wonderful set up inside including a full bar that not many hidden restaurants have to offer. 

Upon ordering takeout...
Looking through their menu, most of the entrees were ranging as low as $14. That doesn't even include rice or any other side dish, which is an additional $6. So I ordered the Lamb Curry with a side of rice and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and had the perfect amount of kick. To be on the picky side though, I have to complain about my Lamb being really tough and the pieces were just too large to be eaten. I had to cut every piece into 3 before eating it. Not to mention there were only about 4 pieces in the Curry itself. Like always with Indian food, I enjoyed the Naan the most by dipping it in the Curry sauce and downing it with the free Mango Lassie received upon checking in (which I ""forgot"" to redeem hehe).

After reading the reviews of this place, I was lead to believe it is the best Indian place in Vegas.  After eating here my thoughts are:

1) This is the only Indian place in Vegas--not likely
2) People in Vegas have never had good Indian food
3) People in Vegas don't know what good Indian food is.

My thinking is either 2 or 3.

The food:  An assortment of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found in Indian cuisine.  The consistency was fine (I've been to some places that have real watery curries) but the blending of spices came out bland and not good.  The naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn.  I have to say the one saving grace was the rice pudding (kheer) was actually quite good...I went back for seconds.

The atmosphere:  typical for an Indian restaurant.  My water glass was filled at appropriate times, they had pleasant light music playing (as opposed to obnoxious Bollywood videos), and the decor is fine.  I have to say I did not venture into the bathroom as I was afraid for my life.

4484287,2010-11-28,1,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"India Palace has been voted best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by The Zagat survey every year since 2001 and it has been described to me by Indians as the most authentic restaurant we have. I've dined there a handful of times to see if I agree.

Although I wouldn't normally want to hang out on East Twain, one of the city's most dangerous areas, I will always take unnecessary risks for good food. The restaurant sticks out as the only kept up, interesting piece of architecture in that area, so it's hard to miss.

You will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming. The walls are painted in warm, cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich, dark woods. There is a comfortable full-service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal, making India palace stand out from many of its competitors.

My favorite thing to get here is the dosa, a thin pancake made from chickpeas. It is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate, and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces. The only other place I've seen dosa is at India Masala in the Riviera (same owners, I believe), so I highly recommend ordering it here. You can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling, or get the plain Papper Dosa, which I prefer (both $10.95). It is served with an addictive coconut 'chutney,' which is more like a coconut puree, and sambar, a tangy tamarind based soup/dip. Even without the accompaniments, the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naan.

The Chicken Tikka Masala ($14.95) and Mushroom Matar ($12.95) are fantastic, but I think the chef's abilities stand out most in the Lamb Rogan Josh ($15.95). The tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic, slow-cooked Italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices, and the flavors continuously evolve in your mouth, revealing the sauce's complexity. The lamb is perfectly tender to boot, and hasn't a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cuts.

So, is India Palace the best Indian restaurant in town? I can't affirmatively say yes (I had a spinach soup that was inedible and they don't use many fresh veggies in their lunch buffet), but it is definitely a contender.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,4,2,4,28jDV2e1-SO20XEx8iWkEw

The few times I have tried it, I have been overseas, but in other countries such as Germany or Italy. So I always wanted to go to an Indian Restaurant in the states (or in actual India, if you wanna take me) to judge for sure.  Well it's official, I love Indian food!  LOL! 


This place was great. Although there was a fabulous looking lunch buffet, we ordered off the menu since I had a Groupon that was for the menu only. 
 
The waiter was awesome...his name was Vick and he was super helpful and accommodating, especially knowing it was out first time. 

So we ended up ordering these fried vegetable appetizers that were very good, but I struggled whether to eat a second one knowing we had more food coming. I gave in and regretted it when the next course came, of course. LOL! 

We ordered the rack of lamb meal for $25. Both of us decided to split it since we weren't super hungry.  Glad we did, because it was more than enough for 2 people.  It came with a nice lentil soup that I didn't eat much of because I was getting so full. 

Then the lamb came and it was amazing.  They had a few sides of rice, potatoes and these veggies balls in the most amazing cream sauce.  The even put some fresh naan on the side that was too good!

Lastly, they served a mango desert. I was so full by this point, I wasn't really interested, but I took a bite just to let you know it was good.  

This is definitely a restaurant I will be back soon!!  Yum!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,1,1,5,j_l9tpBAmzeptyKlNCYcTQ

The appetizer combo was a great place to start. Lots of things to try and wonderful flavor. My husband had the Dal soup and it was great. He then ordered the Tandoori mixed grill which was equally delicious. 

I had garlic Nan bread which was to die for with my Chicken Tikka Marsala. Amazing!  I'm kind of a spice wimp, but it was the perfect amount of flavor. Make sure to order the rice with it. YUM!

4557168,2010-07-05,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"I've been to India Palace a number of times now and would say it's one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. The neighborhood is a little sketchy, but don't let that fool you. This place is worth it.

A few people I know used to not like this place because it was really dumpy. I never saw how it used to look, but the place was renovated a couple years ago and is quite nice now. Even the people who used to not like going there have returned. 

The menu items are typical of what you will find at most Indian restaurants, however, they have a number of Southern Indian foods that I was not familiar with. One dish, the dosa, is something I would highly recommend to anyone. Essentially, it is a gigantic crepe filled with ground potato and onion. To give you an idea of the size, it's probably about 20-24 inches long, 4 inches wide, and an inch thick. If you want to make it amazing, you can ask them to include ground lamb. It's not on the menu, but for an extra few bucks, it's overwhelmingly worth it. It comes with two sauces, sambar and coconut chutney. I've never cared much for coconut, but everyone else always thinks they go well together. Paired with their naan varieties, you really can't lose. 

The tandoori, masala, and everything else I've tried has been very good. Additionally, they have a lunch buffet for about $12 that's worth checking out. Overall, if you are looking for good Indian, this is somewhere you need to go.",hAn8Y_EWYxOSUnaZt72h4w,3,2,5,V7-9O6qRWOJH6pLVfv4jfg

I've been to many Desi restaurants, and usually the strong curry smell is not an issue. If you've been here, you'll know what I'm talking about. 
The restaurant has nice decor but not well looked after. Booths are cramped. Cleanliness could be improved. Our appetizer plates were dirty. The waiter didn't seem to speak much english, and wasn't too knowledgeable about the menu. Waiting staff did not seem at all friendly, not particularly rude, but seemed like they hated their job- Not a single smile all evening. 
Food was mediocre at best. I got the chicken korma and wasn't pleased; the masala was too salty, and the chicken was stringy and almost translucent looking. Two stars are for the naan and the green chutney which were decent. 
Would've been nice if the waiters knew to actually ask if we wanted ice water or warm. All our glasses were filled with warm water.

4567350,2017-11-03,1,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"We were lead to this place by the reviews, and we were also looking to try some authentic Indian food that didn't break the bank. Thankfully we found this place. 

To be honest we almost didn't dine here because it is located in a not really ideal place. It put my hubby on guard for a few moments (I guess his former military training was kicking in a bit) but he relaxed after more patrons arrived. It must be a popular place because not long after we arrived the restaurant filled up really quickly. Looks like they get a lot of take out too because people were just in and out of the restaurant. 

When sat down I told our server that it was our first time having Indian food. To which he replied ""oh you're gonna love it"" , love it we did.

My hubby, my friend Gary, and I all ordered the same thing which was the mixed curry dinner special. It gave us opportunity to have a sampling for different things. The special came with regular or garlic nan bread (we got garlic nan) basmati rice, lentil or chicken soup, chicken masala, shrimp masala, lamb Segway's, and mango custard to finish.  Thinking about it now, it's amazing how I was able to finish most of the food because it was a lot. For that much food at $26, that's a really great deal.

We were given some crispy bread to start with three different times of sauces-a chili sauce which had a lot of heat to it, a mint and yogurt chutney to cool you down from the chili sauce (my husband and I loved this one), and a sweet and sour tamarind sauce- which had just enough tamarind to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. We also added these to our entrees just to try different flavor profiles.

The soup came first. I had the lentil soup and it was amazing! All the flavors in it, oh man, I wish I had the recipe. Just a side note, I usually don't eat lentils but I will go back for the lentil soup. Hubby had the chicken soup and it reminded me of a Filipino soup my grandma used to make but with a lot more herbs and it had a freshness to it like cilantro perhaps? They brought out the garlic nan with our meal and man was our table crowded after that. Galic nan with the masala sauce, OMG heaven! You can order the Masala to the spice level that you want, but because I've never had masala, I ordered mild and asked if I could have extra for the spice that they put so I can adjust it as needed. They were nice to accommodate. The extra spice was a powder they put in a small sauce plate and the first thing I did was taste about a 1/4 spoonful of it. Wrong move, the heat from that extra spice hit fast, so learning my lesson I just put a pinch at a time in the masala until I got it to the desired spice level.

The dinner came with a mango custard. I had to try it before I finished eating my meal because I was afraid I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy. The custard was smooth and creamy, it had a bit of tapioca and I think it was coconut. Here I was feeling full and then I order a mango lassi. I was expecting a smoothie type drink but this was so smooth and thick I really couldn't finish it the it was so delicious. Everything was delicious! They asked if we wanted to take the leftovers (which wasn't a lot-couple slices of the garlic nan, the masala sauce) but told them we couldn't because we had to catch a flight in a several hours. And they were understanding.

Never once did we have to ask for our waters filled. Someone was always checking on us. Great food, great service. What more could you ask for.

Buffet items were bland and blah. Rotis were delicious. Nice ambience. 
My gripe with this place just like most Indian places is the lack of spice and flavor in they food, for some reason the dishes lack the character of their Indian counterparts. In India the same dish will be extremely flavorful. My first mistake I guess comparing with the taste back home. But what's the point in calling yourself fine Indian cuisine if you can't be authentic and recreate the exact flavors??
Also, my mom without knowing the ""rules of the land"" asked for pickles, the staff were extremely helpful and got her a cup full of it and later slipped me an extra $1.50, when asked why he goes oh, if it's not on the menu then you pay. OK!!! why can't you tell her that first, instead of slipping one in, not that I had a problem paying for it, he is right, but the lack of customer service or ethics just irked me.
Buffet is reasonably priced with enough items, improve customer service, remember it's the customer who makes or breaks your business. Improve flavor don't forget the roots of the dish.

I came in here to finally use a long-standing Groupon with Kris J before he moved out of town. We ordered Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, and Chicken Makhani. If you know me at all, you know that I love my Butter Chicken! IP's Makhani failed to disappoint. It was creamy, tender, and oh so delicious. I'm so enamored by Butter Chicken, I feel like I basically ignore every other dish that the culture has to offer. I'm glad I had such an IP connoisseur with me. The Paneer and Korma--both Kris's selections--were outstanding! I'm not quite sure what it is, but there's something about IP's food that just ever-so-slightly sets them apart from the crowd.

Anyway! The lunch buffet ($11.95) has several vegan options, one of which is MASALA DOSA! I know! You're freaking out.  You have been looking for an Indian place that even SERVES dosa, much less has it on the buffet!!  Well, this is a blessing and a curse.  Masala dosa should be eaten immediately after it comes off the griddle, which does not happen at a buffet.  BUT if you can hold out til you see a fresh batch brought out, it's pretty good.  And the sambar to go with was super tasty.  (Bad news though, their coconut chutney has dairy in it.)

The server was very helpful pointing out the vegan-friendly dishes (pakora, rice, chana masala, cabbage, dosa, sambar, some salad stuff).  They will also bring you (vegan) roti upon request instead of naan.

It's an A-OK place; a nice change of pace from the usual trip across the street to Mint.

Oh, and meat-eaters - apparently you MUST try the meatballs and the goat.  That was the word around the table, can't confirm personally!",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,3,0,3,om42H0ibI--iv63n4raD-w
4870265,2013-06-08,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"I've been here twice for lunch with co-workers now, and both times have deeply enjoyed myself and had to waddle out.

First thing's first. When you go, order the Garlic Naan. It's wonderful hot crispy-fluffy naan, slathered with minced garlic and herbs, and I could probably just eat that and the curry sauce by the bucketful. It's not an additional price on top of the buffet, which is what takes India Palace from 3-4 stars for me. So garlicky and wonderful.

The buffet itself is pretty typical Indian-for-mostly-americans fare; I had the Aloo Gobi, Butter Chicken, a few curries, Goat Curry, and Bahji, which were all good, and I had no real complaints. Some of the chunks of chicken were those hard fatty bits, and a little bit unpleasant, but those are pretty expected in stews/curries/etc and overall, everything was great. The saag paneer stuck out as particularly delicious.

They were great about honoring the free mango lassi yelp check-in deal, and, since it was my first time trying lassi (I haven't tried one before because I'm not usually a yogurt fan, and I haven't wanted to spend 3-6$ on a drink I will probably not like, but hey, free is the right price to try new things).  So I tried a new thing and really enjoyed it. I can't say if it was good or bad in lassi terms as I have nothing to compare it to, but I CAN say I plan on trying more lassi's now so that I can find out. And I think that's a pretty good sign for it's tastiness. 

I will definitely be back for the lunch buffet, but I think I will need to try some of the other indian places around town before I choose my ""go-to"" dinner joint. The a-la-carte menu seems a little pricey around dinner time here, but the lunch buffet price is perfect for me.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,4,gvvtLfWlwxqAk47Aix3ygA

Unfortunately, he is not a huge fan of Indian cuisine..We got here at 8:30 on a Sunday night and there was just 1 other table besides us.. This place is located in a pretty sketchy neighborhood but once inside it's not that bad... 

We ordered: 
-The Tandoori Chicken Dinner Special: Tandoori chicken, Saag Paneer, Mixed Vegetables ($25.95)
-The Mixed Curry Dinner Special: Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Sagwala, Chicken Masala ($25.95) 
-Dinner specials also come with dal soup (traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils) and choice of bread.. We got garlic naan & roti.. 
-They also give you complimentary pappadum & chutneys 
-Mango Lassi (free with check-in but they only let us have 1 to share lol) .. Tasted like a sour mango yogurt milkshake LOL

The food was just OK.. My favorite item was the chicken tikka masala~ The service absolutely SUCKED... Even though there were 7 servers just sitting around no one even came to refill our water glasses or check up on us even once.. Anyways after we left I started feeling sick and when we arrived home I most definitely was sick... EWWW I got food poisoning from there and spent the next day feeling absolutely miserable.. The total bill was over $50 and the food quality was the same.. if not worse than a standard lunch buffet.. Thank the Lord I had a Restaurant.com certificate so we only paid a little over $37... But it was not worth getting sick for. I will stick to Mount Everest or try Mint next time. Blehhhhhhhh~

4973780,2009-08-19,1,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"It was the surprisingly pleasant facade that brought us to India Palace on a Sunday evening.  As we drove through the parking lot, we were stunned to see how busy it was.  The private lot was packed and we took the last parking space.  (There were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant.)  Could there be private event?

As I took a quick peek in, it didn't seem like it was closed for a party.  We took the last of the two tables available, which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large group of people waiting.  Checking out our fellow diners, and we were surrounded by Indians and non-Indians.  This place was was ridiculously busy!  As a result, it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come.  It looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices.  (As other yelper mentioned, they just renovated.)  A lone TV behind the bar showed Bollywood videos throughout the meal.  They also have two smaller rooms off to the sides.

The Husband and I both ordered a Mango Lassi ""Sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp."" ($3.95) to start and it was probably one of the best I've had.  Presented in a copper cup, I would say they give you more than other places do.

We both chose a dinner special, which comes with chicken or dal soup; choice of bread - plain naan, garlic naan, or roti; basmatic rice and mango custard.

The Dal Soup ""A traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils."" was simple, but tasty.  A nice start to our meal.

The Garlic Naan was a generous amount, and we actually had leftovers.  It was tasty with lots of garlic.

My Vegetable Dinner Special included ""Saag Paneer, Navratan Korma, Dal Makhani, Raita"" ($19.95).  The Saag Paneer ""Creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese."" is usually a favorite of The Husband's, so I let him have most of it.  It was good, but not my favorite. The Navratan Korma ""Mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews, almonds & raisins."" was a favorite though, probably because I love creamy sauces in Indian cooking. The Dal Makhani ""Lentil delicacy flavored with onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic & cream."" was also very good as well, because I love lentils and cream!  The Raita ""Yogurt seasoned with cumin, cucumber, tomatoes & mint."" has never been something I could enjoy, so The Husband enjoyed most of it.

The Husband went for the Rack of Lamb Dinner Special ""Rack of Lamb, Malai Kofta, Aloo Matar"" ($25.95).  The Malai Kofta ""Cheese & vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy."" was a bit interesting, as we would say.  It's considered a ""House Favorite"" but it was just a bit weird for us.  The Aloo Matar ""Green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry sauce."" was yummy, as most Indian curry dishes are.  The rack of lamb was also good, and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers, which The Husband ate up.

The Mango Custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it.  Not exactly what I call a custard, but more like a thicker lassi.

Service was okay - when our waiter finally took our order, the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too.  The women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table.  Simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit.  We were seated at a small table, so it was crowded with all our mini dishes.

Overall, India Palace served up some good Indian food.  In general, I love the intense spices used in Indian cooking, and you definitely get it here.  I can't say how authentic it is, but from the many Indians eating there, I take that as a good sign.  It is a bit pricey though compared to other Indian restaurants.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,9,5,4,j5gYyy4HXuIgKTCdw12jXw

The portions are good, the place is clean and the service is friendly.

It's seldom crowded so there's always parking in the small parking lot in front.

5146137,2015-10-04,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"Out of all the Indian spots here in Vegas this is definitely my favorite. Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Rack Tandoori are my favorite dishes! The lamb tandoori always comes out sizzling hot to your table and the chicken tikka is always the right amount of spice and good portion of chicken. Also, we order Goat Curry but I wasn't too much of a fan. I usually don't step out of my comfort food when it comes to Indian food. Personal preference; if it's not Bryani, Tikka Masala or Lamb chances are I won't be a fan. Regardless though my out of town friends and family always rave about this spot when we stop by. It's always a go to for them. 

If you want something spicy their scale goes from 1-5 order a 4 for some mild spicy and 5 for their medium spicy. We got a 3 and there was no taste of spicyness here. That's pretty consistent from my previous visits. However, they serve complimentary chili and dipping sauces with flatbread. A little of the green and red chutney sauces goes a long way. 

The service is great though! The gentlemen are always full of smiles and check on their tables often. They were even kind enough to let us use two of the Yelp $20 for $12 deals. Probably because we had a really, really big to go order as well. The food was able to stay nice and hot and no spills on the joy ride home for my family to enjoy as well. It all came in a paper bag and was secured tightly. I mean that's really important when you order curry and you have a long ride home. 

On your way out next to the toothpicks they have these seed looking things. I'm not sure what they're called off the top of my head but I will be sure to update when I remember.

The vegetable mikhana (veggie tikka masala) was off. Way off to a point it was sourish. However, the chicken mikhana, (chicken tikka masala) was actually tasty. I guess they cook it differently. The chicken was so tender it was shredding apart. I enjoyed their Palak Paneer as well. But the paneer was too tough for my taste; it couldn't pick up the flavor of the spinach and spices. Overall, I would not be able to fit this place into my rotation. 
However, service was great! My water was never empty and I was downing that water like crazy because of the goat curry.

5198968,2013-02-15,5,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"For my Indian, I generally stick to lunch buffets, but this week a craving hit around dinner time, and when I noticed the Yelp Deal, I decided it was a perfect excuse to visit India Palace again. The environment is still nice with the added enhancement of MTV India playing on the TV screens, and when the complimentary chutney and papadum hit the table, my stomach did a little dance of joy. I thought things were going to be great. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was moderate. The highlight was the friendly server assistant named Adam. 

I started with the Dal soup, and that really soured the meal. When it arrived at the table, it looked like water complete with little frothy bubbles on the edge. I gave it a stir, and the dal was there, but when I took a slurp, it also tasted like water. I rarely send anything back, but after my husband tasted it, he insisted. Oddly, the server came out to tell me it was supposed to be watery and perhaps I meant to order Dal instead, not the soup. To make a long story short: they brought out another bowl of soup, this time with less water, but with what tasted like a heavy helping of salt. I planned on just having it sit on the table, but the server assistant insisted on taking it off the bill. In short, this experience leads me to believe that when you order Dal soup, they take a serving of Dal and add water as that is how it tastes and appears. 

For our entrees, we ordered the korma and chicken karahi and both were good. I thought the flavor of the korma was better, but I was not impressed with the variety or freshness of the featured vegetables. However, the chicken in the karahi was white meat and tender. We ate everything with roti, and while the first order came out lukewarm, our second order was piping hot and great. I recommend pacing your bread order to ensure the hottest, freshest serving!

I also think it's worth mentioning that whenever our server interacted with us he gave me the distinct impression that he thought we knew next to nothing about Indian food, and perhaps we don't, but his demeanor made me uncomfortable for most of the meal. Adam saved the night for sure.

       - Flavor - Probably one of my favorite India restaurants in town. The lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places.
       - Price/Portions - The prices are on par with other Indian restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller.
       - Locale - The restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking lot is dimly lit.
       - Decor - Though it might not look it from the outside, the inside is quite nice.
       - Lunch Buffet - They have a lunch buffet for $11.95 which I think is a way better deal. Moreover, I wouldn't want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway.
**Ordered**
       - $14.95 Chicken Tikka Masala - Creamy and delicious, this curry is a must try.
       - $15.95 Lamb Rogan Josh - The lamb was tender. The curry was a tomato base and wasn't as thick as other curries.
       - $2.95 Garlic Naan - Your standard garlic naan, fluffy and soft.
       - $3.95 Cheese Naan - They added cheese to regular naan. It kinda tasted like a cheese pizza, but better.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. However, if you don't mind which meal, I'd say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,3,1,4,ZbrM8AzKqgEPZIHuKeo1Yg

5372674,2011-07-06,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"India Palace had catered a wedding at my work a month ago. Seeing the satisfaction of the native diners drew me to try this place out. I had originally wanted to use my groupon, but that offer cannot be combined with the lunch buffet. Instead, I opted for my sister to try some new dishes and determine new favorites. No fear about the unused groupon, next time I will return for dinner. Although I might have failed with my initial mission, the free mango lassi for my first check-in made up for it. The yogurt drink was a nice balance of tart and sweet. Really refreshing for the muggy weather we have been experiencing.

With the Fourth of July over, and done with, my meat intake had thrown me off balance. To offset the BBQ, no cuisine is better than Indian for when you feel like dining on good vegetarian friendly dishes. Did I choose to stay completely meat free? No, I could not resist a few pieces of goat in a curry sauce, a piece of tandoori chicken, and some chicken vindaloo. All of these dishes were fantastic. Nothing was overly salty or sweet. Instead they had strong herbal or spice accents that did not mask the meat. The cilantro chutney only intensified the sensations within my mouth. Now for the real reason why I love Indian food. The paag paneer was addictive and tasted wonderful with the fresh garlic naan. Nice pieces of cottage cheese were found throughout the creamy spinach mixture. The dhal curry was also a favorite. The complex spices in this yellow lentil soup is great over rice, or just eaten straight. Do not forget to help yourself to some kheer. This creamy rice pudding is thinner than the kind you will find in Mediterranean restaurants, but has slivers of almonds within. 

The buffet is open from 11:30-3:00 for a reasonable $11.99.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,0,0,4,ijUA2TpdiVoZBa3JGBRUDw

Sometimes they are busy so it is always great to make reservations here.

Once you get seated, you are seated, you are served papad with mint and tamarind chutney and they are amazing

We usually order the same thing as they are delicious. Our order always is Rack of Lamb, Mix Grill, chicken tikka masala with Cheese and Plain Naan 

Rack of Lamb here are the best you will have in Vegas. They are Juicy and tender with Indian spices. They are so soft that it will melt in your mouth

The mix grill have fish, chicken and beef with different kind of kebabs. It comes fresh to your table.

The chicken tikka masala is with gravy and house special. It is crazy good with Cheese Naan.

Another must have is their sweet or mango lassi. It thick and delicious

  We started out with a bread basket with cheese, garlic and lamb naans, and onion kulcha.  The lamb naan was particularly tasty, but all four were fresh, hot and flavorful.  

    We then had the vegetable pakora, which was like deep fried vegetable fritters.  They were nice and crispy  

   My girlfriend, having Indian food for the first time, went with the safe choice of the chicken tikka.  Just about right spice-wise for her and she enjoyed the dish.  I, however had the lamb pasanda.  I ordered it with a spice level of 7 out of 10.  It came out perfect for my spicy taste.  It had a nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend of spices in the sauce. 

  All in all, we loved the food.  The service was a bit slow, even though there was only one other table of people when we got there.  The waiter also tried to change my mind when I made my entree selection, which was a bit annoying.  Apparently he thought a different dish would have been better suited to me.  The decorum was very nice, until you got to the tv hanging on the wall.  It kind of ruined the mood set by the lighting and the paintings.

5586743,2011-07-29,0,TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw,"Four people, table service; two who really know and love Indian food and two who love *this* place (though I am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself). 

SERVICE:

The service was fantastic. Vick really took care of us and, having waited on my friends for the past four years, exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together. He made recommendations, made sure we wanted for nothing, and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any way.

FOOD:

The food was mostly good. Not great, but good. Tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine, and some good conversation.

The paneer pakora (cheese squares made of 2 layers of cheese with some thin herb/veggie spread in between, then battered and fried) was disappointing. Maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast; it quickly becomes a hunk of room-temperature fried cheese. It didn't make think of Indian food as much as any other fried cheese product around town.

The chicken pakora was much like the cheese; it seemed like any other fried chicken strip. The flavors want to be there, but it's just not executed well enough. Not impressed.

The samosas were really tasty. The crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful. Layered flavors, a great kick of spice, and the textures were good. A highlight, for sure.

The sauces (mint, tamarind, and chili) were fantastic! Really, really flavorful and fresh. We refilled our sauce dishes at least twice. Best part of the meal.

The chicken tikka masala was tasty. Not the best in town, but tasty. We ordered one medium and one hot. The hot was truly HOT... pushing the line of too much (and therefore hiding some of the flavors). Still, the flavors were good and the chicken was tender. 

The peas pulao (basmati rice with peas and cashews) was pretty damn good, actually. I tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness, the combination of flavors. Great complement.

The breads were good (my companions had to try at least four kinds?). I tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good. Again, not great. But good, worth trying.

COST/VALUE:

The apps and bread are priced well, especially for groups who want to get a few things and share. The entrees, however, are overpriced for what we received: appetizer size at entree prices. The tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la carte (also a bit pricey for what you get). Bad juju there, as your ""entree"" becomes a $20+ dish but it's just not a $20+ place. It wasn't my dime, but $200 for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this, even considering the wine.

OVERALL:

 Food (and value of same) made me think it was a 2-2.5 (edible, but I have had much better...) but the service and atmosphere was easily a 4.5! So, a 3-star, A-OK experience. 

I *would* go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place... but I'll also take them somewhere else when it's my turn to choose.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,1,0,3,m9Ruab7rxt0cpKnx-hZs-w

The food did not have any flavor at all and we felt that we were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a meal. The masala dosa was uncooked, tandoori chicken bland and i cannot even define the taste of the butter chicken. Finally we decided that you cant go wrong with dal rice but that again was under seasoned and tasteless. The sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it felt like thick mango nectar that was sweetened to the point of being inedible.

When the host was informed by one of our group members that the food could have been better he was arrogantly told that the food is purposefully kept bland to suite the taste requirements here.

Fresh naan delivered to the table would be most welcome, instead of the rather dried out naan that sits in the heater tray in the buffet line.

The restaurant is in a shady area of town yet it's the only nice building so it's fine I guess. We were one of two groups of people in the place, apart from a table of servers which was weird, because it was lunch time. 

Overall, the food is good. Their goat isn't as good as Mint's but I still ate like a billion plates of it because it was still really tasty. Some of the breaded veggies were a little chewy but I assume that's because there wasn't a crowd there to eat up the food and have it rotated. They had some awesome naan.

I got a free mango lassi with a Yelp check in. Justin checked in too but they wouldn't give him one because it was one per table, rather than one per check. It wasn't a big deal because it was (delicious) and big enough to share. 

The reason this gets 3 stars instead of 4 was because when Justin asked for the check, we somehow were charged for a different table and it came out to more than $40 for two buffets. Justin said that his card had been charged for the wrong amount and that they needed to void the transaction. They told him that they couldn't give him a void slip and that they ran the card for the correct amount. He argued with them about now paying $60+ dollars for two buffets when the server threw the receipts in his lap, told him to call his credit card and dispute it and walked away in frustration. I went to sit out in the car while Justin tried to fix it. Super uncomfortable.

It took a minute for anyone to greet us and then seat us. We were seated at a booth (which was showing quite a bit of wear & tear on the seats... the vinyl/leather was cracking) and given menus and then the host walked away. Our server came by and we ordered papadums and onion bhaji to start. 

The restaurant is located off the strip and was pretty easy to find. They didn't seem to put a whole lot of effort into decor, but they have a couple TVs set up. In the back of the seating area, they had a buffet area set up, but I'm guessing its only a lunch buffet because there was nothing out when we went for dinner. It did look pretty sizable though. 

They brought out our onion bhaji, which was alright but definitely not good or great. No papadums. We ordered 1 garlic naan and 1 cheese naan and our meals...I got chicken tikka masala and my boyfriend got tandoori chicken, asking again for papadums. So the server brought out 2 orders of garlic naan but no cheese naan. My tikka masala was not good and ended up making me sick. My boyfriend's tandoori chicken was over cooked & dried out. And still no papadums. I asked AGAIN for papadums and our server finally told us they don't have papadums, even though they have them on their menu. 

Between the awful service and the OK (which is generous of me), I'm not impressed with this place. I won't be back, that's for sure.",vQxahO21JB6-C32lYgcHaQ,3,0,2,xbwIb6E1ECKAH5mVuP_ZGQ

Entrees: Lamb Curry & Chicken Tikka Masala

Sides: Keemon Naan and Plain Naan.

Plus you have to pay for rice which I think is a complete sham especially when you're already shelling out ~$15 for a curry. I mean come on, how much is rice? Definitely not the $3.95 you charged me.

Anyway, we were a group of 4 so we got a decent variety: Saag Paneer, Haryali Chicken, Karahi Chicken, and I convinced my bro-in-law to try goat so we also got the Goat Curry. The Goat Curry sauce was pretty tasty but all the goat meat was attached to chunks of bone so it's a bit of a pain and not so fun to have to extract actual meat. Goat is nearer to pork than anything if you've never tried it by the way - & not gamey like mutton can be...barf.

Karahi Chicken was also worthy of getting. A nice tasting curry with various spices intermingling. I had mine done ""spicy"" but it still could have used a little more heat. 

I wish I could tell you about the Haryali Chicken but my soon-to-be sister-in-law didn't seem to want to share from the other side of the table. It looked good.
