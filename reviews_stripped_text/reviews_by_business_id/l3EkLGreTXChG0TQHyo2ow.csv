Great. The servers at the drive thru were nice, and our food was ready for us when we got to the window. 

Price: 
$10 for two burgers is pretty expensive.. not including drinks or a combo. 

Food: 
We got two of the new ciabatta bacon cheeseburgers, and I thought they were really good. I probably won\t buy it again though, just because of the price.",iMhwsPY3aGZAa8i0R2c9mA,0,0,3,QBsd0aypEgdYteoDzuqr4A
171010,2011-07-14,3,l3EkLGreTXChG0TQHyo2ow,"It literally just took me an half a hour to order two burgers, two fries, two bottled waters and two ice teas. A half a hour! How? Well, I went over to this place and was met by a woman that could barely speak English and could apparently understand even less. I wondered what the hold up was and I see that the problem was car after car having to explain themselves repeatedly to get their point across.

Yet, this person is handling the drive thru. It is crazy. I mean, I could care less what anyone speaks but if you are running a Wendy's and at the restaurant English speakers are coming in, it would seem to me that you would have someone at the window that speaks English.

Anyway, the Ice tea was cool and the natural cut fries were great. The burger though, well, I think it needs a bit of help. The bacon just left a bad taste in my mouth. All and all I'd say pass on this Wendys.",GbdjVir2XDTX2fUCgmRHuA,2,1,1,VgzzQ-gvQuOWg8NqrvD8Iw

I have been to this location multiple time, thus the dukedom but unfortunately its more about location and accessability than service (and isn't it true that's the case with most everything these days ""/) but I digress, the wait times are longer than average when you dine in or even if you go through the drive thru, and that makes me sad.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is the fact that I know that I will probably be back there, another thing that makes me sad.  There is hope though, every once in a while I get pretty good service so the silver lining is there but hopefully that shines through more often than not!  We will see as I said before I will be back and hopefully they suprise me in a good way!",aT_AzbpcsbodNNtFzPqRVg,1,0,2,KWAo-UrjJAA3RPuQRk-KaA

The food was cold.the burger was cold. The fries were cold. The nuggets were cold. The employees were texting and hootin and hollerin. The food came out quick... too quick so I'm guessing it's all old crap that's been sitting around for a good hour...

And the location is terrible and dirty. Will not return, but will put most most of my focus on telling people how bad this shit hole is.

Shauntee's (I believe that's how she spells it) customer service is above and beyond what I ever expect from a fast food chain. I usually receive decent service, however I don't really expect much.

This place is garbage, I waited 20 minutes (with 3 people in front of me) to place my order, another 10 minutes for the cold, burnt food.  I get that fast food workers take zero pride in their jobs, but there was no accountability and complete chaos in the store.  It's always dirty, and the service is always bad, but this was exceptionally poor.  But of course, the owner is making their profits because of the location and could care less about having decent employees represent their business.

This has to be the worst location I've ever been to in my life. The cashier looked high and couldn't understand who ordered what. When he asked what drink I wanted I replied ""Barq's"", which I was met with a  ""uh.... what's that?"". Whats worse is my friend ordered right after me also asking for barq's, he needed a good while to figure out what that was. Come on man, you only have six options. When we recieved our food the chicken nuggets were stale, junior cheese burgers tasted auful and the frostys were soup. Another customer here asked for his money back on his frosty soup, as did we. The manager told us the machine has had issues all day, yet still sells people the frosty soup. He did however give us a card for a free frosty next visit.

That poor bastard. That lonely tomato. He tried his best to hide under the pile of lettuce but it was no use. What kind of salad has one tomato. I would almost prefer no tomatoes by that point. You couldn't throw in some carrot sticks. I don't even need whole carrots, just some shavings would have been fine.

i live around this location so if I go for Wendy's it'll be here. The location seems trustworthy as for cleanliness then YES it's acceptable. 

Customer service:The worst. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the cashier staring at me. That's the first thing that happened when I walked in. WEIRD. And he didn't stop. I also ordered one bruger got another WAY different. So I to get the one I wanted I had to pay the difference. It all came out for $9. I hate the help here. 

Now that's very expensive for a burger but that's business. I guess. . . It's clean and the love the food. Even through the drive through people get weird. But It's better than going in there.

I had: 

-Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger ($2.21)Delicious!  Veggies were cold and crispy, meat was hot, buns were soft.  

-Sour Cream & Chive Baked Potato ($1.76) Perfect.  Huge, fluffy, came with butter and sour cream.  I had them add bacon and cheese...not sure how much extra that added to it but my total was $7.42 with tax so I'm guessing not much. 

-Caesar Side Salad ($1.65) My favorite! Comes with lemon caesar dressing on the side and a pack of croutons on the side.  Has three big juicy cherry tomatoes on it.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,1,5,4dyRHOnU5kVKuf7K2QUjPA
