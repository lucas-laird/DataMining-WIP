The food was fresh, but the service ... what service?  They don't know what they are doing!

Glad to have a place with the O-K Kosher symbol.  For a visitor like me, I appreciate a ""pita joint' with international kosher symbol and reputation, instead of just one rabbi.

I plan to review it in the future!",5fdFgX3sJ0rJq1NkXn1w8A,1,0,1,w5fEjz3dSyiHHXon1W1QcQ

Hubby was craving falafel and hummus.
I opened up Yelp and Eric S. saved the day with his ROTD! No idea why I didn't know about this place but I'm very thankful for Eric's post!!!!!!!!!!!!

I called and asked a few questions and then proceeded to  make a pickup order to pamper hubs at his request after a long day at work.
I ordered hummus, a falafel pita sandwich, a order of falafel and extra pita. 

While not super yellow inside the falafel like my Israeli InLaws like (yuck) they aren't all green and cheap.
They are just right the way we prefer them.

I tried a few of the items (I eat oil and gluten free) and they really were top notch and kinda tie with Amenia for our favorite falafel pita place here locally. I really like some of the meze sides (there were a lot he gave us). One of the slaw dishes had mayo so I couldn't partake in that one. 

When I picked up his food the guys working there were SUPER nice and added a bunch of candies and items. 

We will be back to visit soon! Hopefully I can get hubs to have a sit down there.

Vegans don't worry, they have zero dairy on premises.",zgV0ZroIF956gw4cul8MHA,16,15,5,0mfi-K6gzRuGaUqOMLf2bg

The guys working there are so insanely nice and attentive I felt like a rock star just showing up. Only one experience so far so take it with a grain of salt. 

I just ordered the hummus and falafel for a quick lunch. If you're eating in, then you're not having a quick lunch if you plan on enjoying yourself. First there were at least nine dishes that come out with your beautifully cooked, hot bread. Israel salad, cabbage, eggplant, three different hot sauces, egg salad (I would fight someone for this egg salad), and red cabbage slaw. Then a huge plate of the best hummus I've ever had, and boatload of falafel. 

I looked up at the gentleman bringing my food, who, like everyone else working there , looked like every svelt soldier I met when I was visiting Haifa, and wanted to say ""You know I'm just one guy here, right?"" 

It's so much food!

That being said, it was empty when I walked in at 12:30. By 1pm the place was packed with people standing in line, and now I know why. Fresh, healthy food with personal service and the real feel of a cafe in Israeli. Just can't be beat. Very happy with the renovations and the addition of meat to the menu. You'll probably see me here at least a few times a week getting a little more content and a lot healthier.

I can honestly say this place rivals the best of them.
The Falafel is crisp outside and soft and moist inside the way it should be with the proper coloring instead of the brownish grey mess you get in places that don't make it fresh.  The schnitzel pita came on a tasty grilled pita and you get to choose the stuffings from cabbage, tomato, hummus, spicy sauce, tzatziki, onions, and more.  the toppings were fresh.  The sandwich was served with tasty fries and a dish of pickles, peppers and olives.  The flavors were outstanding although I might skip the onions next time in order to get more of the schnitzel flavor.  There are several other options I will try next time.  You can get their food on Pita, Lafa 
 (flatbread) or as a plate.
This place was a gem of a find.
For those who are price conscious, please be aware that Kosher restaurants tend to cost a little more because of the rigorous rules they must follow regarding cleanliness, keeping meat and dairy separate, and what types of meat they order.  My pita with fries cost $14.00.  A plate $19.99 but the portions are filling and the taste was worth it.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,25,20,5,K1Dds6z0nQE7QcixhTV9Cw
