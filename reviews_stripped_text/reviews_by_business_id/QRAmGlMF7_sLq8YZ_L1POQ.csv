I spent over $14 on a small bag of candy. 

Yes, they do have a big selection of different candies but I don't think it's worth the price.

I tried the watermelon sours, watermelon gummy bears and watermelon sour slices. Yes, I love watermelon but I don't love watermelon enough to spend $14 on a bag of sugary candy when I can buy a real watermelon for $5.

I love candy but I'd rather buy a bag of sour patch watermelon slices for a fraction of the price.",QaMesXcKgII2k7IoZBUgpA,1,0,2,Y_KaU34aL1rbAuhgiDQItg
1513156,2015-02-14,1,QRAmGlMF7_sLq8YZ_L1POQ,"Went to the Sugar Factory to check it out.  My husband had a coupon for the lollipop which was but one get one free. I picked up the apple flavored lollipop. The lady was explaining us how it worked. There's a cap that covers the lollipop if you can't finish it. Once you finish the lollipop, you discard the stick and replace it with another one. You can order the lollipops on line. Great idea. The whole lollipop contraption was a little pricey if you ask me. It was about $25.00 a pop. The other one was free.
The store was very bright and colorful and had lots of different kinds of candy especially the old school candy. 
I don't think I would want to spend that much money on candy in the store. You can buy it elsewhere for cheaper.

Seriously this place is a sugar addicts dream shop.  Everything here is sweet and sugary.  Came here to redeem one of the My Vegas coupons.  I felt high on sugar the whole time I was in there and I didn't even have any candy.  I picked up some chocolate rocks, malt balls, chocolate covered pretzel and green cotton candy! 

Since I don't have a sweet tooth these were all brought into the office to be shared.

Nose ~ Smells sweet!.
Ear ~ Enjoying the music they have playing.

4422973,2012-12-17,0,QRAmGlMF7_sLq8YZ_L1POQ,"I have always wanted to come to this place since it's always below one of my fave CLUBS in LV.  But we never get the chance to eat here or at least stop by.

Finally a chance to try the place since it's my son's bday on Tuesday and so we had a lunch date there and he had always wanted to eat there. 
Got there after Noonish.   A lot of people but not much wait- only 10 min.  While we waited we looked around the store area but not too much since we were hungry and didn't want to buy everything we see. 
I asked for a table outdoors so we can people watch and I got confirmation the heaters were on since it was super cold. 
We got seated and the heater next to us was not on.  The waitress (she was very nice)- tried to turn it on for us.  While we studied the menu the waitress tried to turn on the heaters in the other area....so we moved closer to those heaters.  
***(The heaters turned off after 5 min)****
We ordered the *FRIED MAC/CHEESE...which was delicious.  The consistency was delectable and I can even picture it better if it had crab in it.
My son had *CHICKEN ALFREDO- which tasted very buttery and with plenty of chicken.  Exactly what my son loves. 
I ordered the *FRENCH DIP- which was full of the most tender roast beef and very moist almost like butter.  It could use a lil more salt but it was good it wasn't too salty.  Easier to add salt than to take it away.  The fries was good too.  (dang was we that hungry that everything tasted good??????  LOL)

****that dang heater--the waitress has assured us the heaters were out of propane DUH!...and some guy was coming to refill it and we'll be good soon.

We finished out food, paid the bill THEN the propane man actually came and started filling up the propane tanks.  
Luckily the sun peeked between these two hotels and we got a lil sunheat while we were eating...Thank You G. 

Paid the bill - gave her a good tip since she was a good attentive waitress.  
The food was good and I was thinking it was gonna be expensive and paying for the location and that food was gonna stank.  - NO....it was worth the price, the view of the Bellagio fountains, able to people watch, and good staff minus the slow -ass propane man. 

Yes we could have sat indoors- but we were assured the heaters were on.  We could have been asked if we would like to move indoors - but we were not.  
Even if we had thick jackets and everything it would have been nice...but who wants to eat with all that clothing.  

I tried to go on the SUGAR FACTORY online to comment on our experience but I could not find a link for customer comments.  

The store part- it was fun to look at everything and I just want to buy everything.  
So we just bought some  pop rocks and the lip tattoo.
