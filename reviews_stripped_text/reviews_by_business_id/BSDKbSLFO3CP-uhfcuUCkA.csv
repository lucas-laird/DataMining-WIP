24136,2017-03-01,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,The food was over priced for the quality and taste. I ordered the hottie burger which was decent and cold when arrived at the table. We also had a fondue for the table which consisted of brownies and other sweets that seemed like they've been sitting out for a while. Couldn't get the server to refill my water either :( I also ordered a coronarita which tasted very watered down. Definitely will not return. On the plus side the gaming seemed like it could be fun (the gaming is the reasoning behind this review being 2 stars and not 1.),Cx28dx_a1qgGgl47OL1wJA,0,0,2,b-TjJpXDeAH44c-Plvve9Q

Second our waiter David was pretty bad. He flirted with every girl at our table, told us we weren't his only table so we needed to relax, rarely came by and asked if we needed anything, forgot to put in one of our party member's meal, and brought out plates one at a time. While I was eating my food my other party members still had not gotten theirs. When my girlfriend's grandma talked to the manager, Adam, and asked if they could do something for us since the food was cold and the fact it took forever he replied ""I don't like being demanded what to do."" So we just decided to leave. Very expensive food that was cold and took forever to come out. Horrible service.",ZjpdnTLmmz2wYNkiQbwOYA,3,0,1,b9s2NztH5T3tL-iwKVzC-A
42762,2016-09-03,1,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"I was SO excited when I heard that Las Vegas would be getting a Dave and Busters! Being a Texas native, it was a place that we've hung out and celebrated at on many occasions. To my disappointment, this location is terrible.
1. They've hired the youngest, cheapest and most inexperienced staff and CLEARLY did not invest in their training. 
2. The food is at best, mediocre. 
3. Don't even THINK about hosting an event here because NO ONE will call you back or return your phone calls. 
4. The venue is nice; but, tiny. 
The only good thing about this place is Happy Hour Mon-Fri. 
They have got to step their game up and train their managers and associates. It's not looking too good for this location. 
I'm so disappointed.
UPDATE:
I have to give credit where credit is due. I finally got ahold of the original person that I spoke to about hosting an event, Ashlynne. She is AWESOME! She held on the phone with me while she made a contract and made sure that I received the contracted just in case I had any questions or concerns. D&B almost lost my business. Ashlynne saved it and I appreciate her help. I hope that she at least gets recognized for this.",oOlzp2cnVaDzRDazuSYPPg,3,0,2,mDT_-M-BdwfaBxqz7l9pTQ

I have been in contact with this Dave and Busters months before they opened their doors so I could book my wedding reception on a specific date and time this upcoming winter. I have asked multiple times to place a deposit to hold the room and they failed to send me the information to place the deposit. I met with the coordinator in person to take a tour with hopes of finally being able to book the room but was told she would send me the contract via email by end of business day. I waited patiently for 4 days to finally get an email that says Hey sorry, we overbooked! Extremely unprofessional and I STILL have yet to receive a follow up email or call about how this going to be resolved.

We drive down to Summerlin and she was so excited.  She is a game player.  We got turned away at the door because they rented the place out for a private party until 9pm.  REALLY??  No banquet area?  The whole place???  So they gave us a card worth like $20 or something for game play and we left.  A restaurant on our way home was happy to take our money minus the games. Will we return?

Trying to give them the benefit as it just opened but management needs to get it together! We had a party of 8. We were told we had to be on a wait list and needed at least 6 people to be sat. No problem we put our name down and 30 min later we were told that they thought it was a party of 6 and we should have been on a wait list...we did have our name down on said list. Then some high school kid was clearly flustered and said well my manager has me running around trying to find people and trying to figure out where to seat you...clearly angry with us. One member of my group went over and tried to figure out what was going on and one girl had a suggestion of us  sitting at a round top in a closed section and bringing a server over..smart idea as we wanted to eat and chat. The manager replies I would never put a party of 8 at a round top...uh ok...to many servers just standing around not attending to the dirty tables in the bar area and management is a joke! Rude and seemed to turn a lot of people off with her demeanor. hats of to the bar tenders who were the only ones who looked like they were interested in making some money and accommodating a few drink orders....seems odd for a place that just opened to want to keep people in the establishment...we went elsewhere and had a great server and manager was friendly...again I am willing to try again but wait a few months if you are going with a group of 6-8 they aren't prepared for that so give it some time and hopefully with fingers crossed it will calm down and smooth itself out and the shorter blonde manager will calm herself down and not be so condescending in front of customers...,Ec7k5Nxp1rohv1f1nMU_ig,1,0,1,0i-09b7_yrS_ixQEtn4qJQ

When I lived in the East Coast, this was our playground. When I heard about them coming to Vegas, specially near me, in the Summerlin area, I have to admit I was ecstatic! 

Everything about Dave & Busters is great, since I can't eat out due to them not catering to my dietary restrictions, I won't be reviewing their food. 

Unfortunately in their limited space, they chose to instead of amping up the actual games that people play, with Carnival games, such as the coin tossing games and etc... and limited the amount of competition based games people come here to play such as the Racing, Shooting and Fighting games. 

Drinks are nothing out of the ordinary and a tad overpriced, but it's what you'd expect from a chain. 

Bullet Points 

* 4D Terror Machine has a HUUUUUGE line everytime, I once waited over 45 minutes in line and didn't get to play. They should honestly get 2 in there, get rid of the Luigi Mansion one and add another 4D Terror booth. 

*There is an airplane shooting game that is incredible, it was tricky to find where to open the door that lets you inside of the booth, but it's one of the best immersive games there

*There is a horse racing area in the back. You breed your horse and train it and race it, in the end you can print out your unique Horse ID Card which you can keep with you so you can always come back and race with your saved horse. 

*Skip the ""Rollercoaster Experience"" crap where you lay down on a seat that vibrates. It is extremely pathetic, the volume is low, the graphics are outdated and it's not a bit thrilling.... it is a vibrating chair with a video of a weird rollercoaster ride. You will NOT feel remotely close to being on an adventure ride. 

* They need to get a Mortal Kombat game in there... REALLY. 

* Needs to be open later ...this is Las Vegas, not some small town in Mississippi. For it to close at 12 AM on Thursdays and Sundays is ludicrous!  We start Pre Gaming at 11 here in Vegas ... 

All in all, it's a fun place to go, it does have its flaws and does seem that the negative comments are more linked to the dining area. I do hope they plan on improving to make this an even better experience.",GDY-w1OO_nzLfe9AAVzgGA,0,0,4,JYNWijfMd4Ia8Qy5ACwQLQ

I feel I have sufficiently cooled off enough to write this review. I asked for the manager on duty that night when the person up front rejected my request for a veteran discount (I had my state issued NV drivers license which stated this as proof). She was not rude but did insist that it must be a military issued id card, per policy. When the manager arrived I explained to them that not all veterans carry their military ids when they get out. I have my DD214, I have my license, I'm good. The state id confirms our status. To my surprise, the manager also insisted on their policy and denied me and the other veterans in our group the discount we otherwise would have gotten. It would have amounted to $2.00 off for each of us, such a small amount to not only avoid this negative experience but earn some goodwill from the veteran community. I personally make it a point to support a business that shows appreciation for veterans and was happily surprised to see the notice at Dave and Busters's area up front. Talk about half commitment! Were it not for the other non-veterans in our group that night, We would not have given Dave and Busters any of our business.

was there last night with a group of friends and we were playing air hockey, I set my watch down because  it came loose. Someone snatched it off the table.

He went back and it was gone. Called this morning and nothing.  so to the asshole who stole a watch that was by the air hockey game, I'm glad you have it in your heart to steal someone's watch and keep it.

It was a half price Wednesday, so it was busy. We waited in line to get our play card and use our coupon. The guy at the counter looked at me like I had two heads when i showed him the coupon on my phone. He took my phone from me and kept it behind the counter for the entire transaction, even when he was done with it, which I found odd. He also made sure to touch me with his creepily long fingernails as much as possible throughout our transaction, which was more often than you'd think. 

He couldn't figure out how to use the coupon, he also couldn't figure out how to ask anyone for help. 

Wednesdays are cheaper but also super busy, and we had to wait for most games we wanted to play.

Ordered a couple beers from the small bar on the game floor, and the bartender was unfriendly and kind of a douche, so that was fun.

I mean, this place is absolutely no better than gameworks.

Its also deafeningly, ear bleeding loud in there so its hard to carry on a conversation.

This is a good place to bring a group but I wouldn't want to come here to spend quality time with someone. The restaurant is a large area which is good and you don't have to wait terribly long, even if you have a large party in most cases. 

The menu is ridiculous in the sense that everything is super over the top. You get good things and bad things from that. I ordered a turkey burger thinking that- by the looks of their other burgers, it would be one to remember. It was just ""meh"" and honestly something I could have made at home. I would have rather gone with something more ridiculous like a Mac and cheese burger or whatever it was they had. 

My suggestion: go with something that is pictured on the menu. (Turkey burger was not.)

The drink selection is more focused on crazy drinks like a sno cone with an upside down Corona in it and something that glows in the dark and has been blessed by a unicorn. The wine selection was slim so this is more of a place where I would stick with beer.

The service was overall an 8/10 because it wasn't awe inspiring but you have to hand it to them because they are servicing so many people!

As for the games: my husband and I spent the $29 for 170 play points (I might be a little off on the points but I'm right about the price) and that was a perfect amount for us to play.

I was very disappointed when I got there at 9:30 because as soon as I  walked in I immediately saw little kids and teenagers!!! Kids running around unsupervised and teenagers  nothing but into  their phones in the way and in the way where the adults couldn't play games.

I only got to enjoy 1 drink which was the TNT and wasn't strong and comes in a really small glass.  They don't have the prices on none of their drinks or food. Strange that a restaurant wouldn't have prices so you'll know before ordering. 

I've always thought they kicked you out if you weren't over 21. Even though it's the only one in Vegas, I probably won't be retuning because kids & teenagers everywhere are a deal breaker for me.

I've usually had positive/ neutral experiences, but this was unusually unprofessional behavior/ conduct. To begin, it was disappointing when people who came to the bar AFTER us were served with their beverages substantially before us while we had been waiting and were blatantly ignored (age discrimination?). Additionally closing out our tab, we were double charged for the drinks, first as separate drinks listed than as the entire drink tally in total!! Not to mention our drink order was wrong 2x!! {this may be understandable if they were busy, but unfortunately it was just a result of carelessness and lack of enthusiasm from the bartenders}
Furthermore... there was a very RUDE/ harassing crew member who snidely mocked us taking photos and proceeded to stare us down until we felt so uncomfortable we decided to leave.

Unfortunately, the experience for my wife and I at the Summerlin location was underwhelming at best. We sat at a booth by the bar to grab a quick bite and drink before going to a movie.

The Food: Decent. Back of the house has it together, but our ""loaded"" tots, which were supposed to be covered in cheese and bacon and sour cream had no sour cream, and cheese and bacon on about 7/50 tots. The tater cakes were ok, but the white dipping sauce was not ranch, as one might expect...it was horseradish sauce! It would've been nice to be told that before putting that stuff on the food :-/ Clearly, the waiter had no idea because when my wife asked for ranch, he said, ""Ok, I'll bring another one."" The spinach dip was the best of the three items we ordered.

The Drinks: Surprisingly decent prices for a big beer and a Bloody Mary. Now, they just need to teach their wait staff about their drink options. This guy had clearly never heard of a mimosa, and when my wife asked if they could make her one, he said, ""If it's not on one of those [three separate] menus, then we don't have it."" I saw the beer taps from our seat, two of the handles of which said ""Samuel Adams Seasonal"" and ""Joseph James Seasonal."" I asked what the seasonals were and was told, ""Our seasonal is Sam Adams."" After I left our table to ask the bartender, he gave me a sample, and I decided what I wanted. Unfortunately, the waiter ordered the wrong beer, and I had to go reorder from the bartender anyway.

The Service: Bad, with the exception of the bartender, who looked like Tyson Beckford with tattoo sleeves, ladies. Never have I signed a check, had the booklet between my arms as I finish my beer and converse with my guest, and had a waiter try to come back and grab the signed check from under my glass.

I probably won't come back. Maybe if I'm in the area, we'll sit at the bar to check out happy hour.  They have a lot of big screen TVs, so catching football could be cool, but these folks couldn't handle a slow day, so I can't imagine NFL game day.

Dave and Buster's you should be ashamed of who you hire here, your employees are miserable and hate their jobs. It's obvious. Both these guys weren't nice at all and were such super mean careless jerks. Shame on you... never again. I WILL CALL corporate if I don't receive a call or response within 48 hours. This experience has been the most horrible, regrettably said. Server's name is Mario. To both of you guys, if you ever come to my place of employment and ever treated you less than half as badly, I hope I'd get fired so

FOOD was okay but to be fair, we only ordered appetizers 

If you order the mini burgers and wings to share, it's basically the same as the kids meal menu. Little patties in tiny Hawaiian buns and little four pieces of chicken. 
Same thing if you order the buffalo wings. Cute Tiny pieces that should be a kids meal menu. 

Pineapple coconut snow cone was tasty but more like a slushie. Coronaritas were bomb.

SERVICE was bland at best. Mentioned it was our first time there, waitress really had nothing to offer or upsell to us.

2032314,2016-10-16,2,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"This review is solely based on their games. I have been to the Roseville location before and by far they have way more games compared to the Las Vegas location. However, I do like their rule about 18+ to enter in without an adult since Roseville requires 21+. 
I'm sad to see they are missing a lot of fun games like the miner derby game where you roll the ball into different color holes. 
There's still room for improvement but the location is still new. I definitely recommend signing up for their newsletter and membership because they always send coupons like spend $20 and get $20 free.

Drinks are erroneously cheap, which is amazing and they have a decent liquor selection for whatever your tastes are. They have what they call food, about three choices for HH. Those offerings, and everything else on the menu, is targeted toward people who love Applebees, Nascar, Pizza Hut's newest abomination, vintage Disney and Warner Bros clothes - you get the idea. The act of getting blitzed in their bar is not super horrible at first, as long as you're not hungry. It's the random children running through the bar that offer a stark call back to reality. They cause you to drift your eyes past the blind Tinder dates and CPS violations. Eventually, you'll need to pee, that's when the real magic happens. Stumbling past the video games and future leaders of America is an achievement onto itself. Seriously, they should give out an award for dodging the kids and machines without incident. Onto the restrooms, but only the Men's bathroom. (The temptation to ask about the women's bathroom was overshadowed by the fear of being branded a sexual predator. Seriously, not joking.)  The Men's has the typical urinals and toilets with doors. There are four sinks, in sets of two at either side of the entrance. All sinks were manned by two tuxed-out sink attendants, at 5:30pm on a Wednesday. One man per two sinks, that's right - there's no getting away. They were nice enough, displaying a solid selection of bootleg Drakkar and the like. As I was walking out I began to wonder, do the kids tip in tokens? What type of reaction would occur if a 10 year old grabbed a cigarette, a splash of imitation Armani cologne and dropped a 5-spot in the tip jar? These are questions I pose to you, oh great Yelp reader. If this post teaches you anything, it's that sometimes when life brings you what looks like boneless chicken wings, you take another shot of Jameson (on special).",Z23C2KX_7gEeYy3030PDUA,0,0,4,SZ2NBTyIuHG2vAniWA3pqg

The food was amazing . Once it hit 7 , our waiter showed up few and far between, so the on point service kind of fell off.buts a good thing it was so great to start. 

When you eat, you get to enjoy eat, play combos and there are a lot of cool games to enjoy, giant PAC man, giant connect four, there's a roller coaster game that blows air on you, price is right, monopoly, no deal, and plenty more and the tickets seem pretty reasonable. We made out with 3,000 tickets between 3 of us and only used what we had from the way and play combo loads. 

I will say I had a coupon in my email for signing up for the rewards for $10 , and they said they don't do any coupons on Wednesday because everything's already discounted. The coupon doesn't say that and our waiter had said I could do it. It discussed that with the manager and he was excellent at accommodating us with gameplay but still couldn't honor our coupon.

1-star for the great happy hour

I'm from California and I've been going to Dave and Buster ever since I can remember. Hearing that they were opening one in Vegas definitely got me very excited, so you could only imagine my disappointment. My boyfriend and I arrived around 830PM, a bit before happy hour so we could find parking and check the place out before the rest of our group arrived. The games are extremely fun! The variety is enormous, theres pretty much every type of game out there(just like I remembered)! My friend put his name down for a party of 12 and we were quoted 30 mins. I also work in food service so I understand that sometimes quote times aren't correct. But if you're under quoting by over an hour, then as a courtesy the hostesses should've let us know that it was longer than expected. Aside from that, our service was average throughout our meal. However, the quality of my entree was unacceptable. I ordered the tenderloin pasta with bacon wrapped shrimp. An $18 dish that tasted like it was only worth $5. It was also served to me less than room temperature. I understand that they were closer towards closing, but that doesn't justify them to serve cold dishes. Overall, if it wasn't for the fun games and atmosphere, this place would circle down the drain in no time.

PS: The bar is VERY busy. But it's expected, all the drinks we ordered were delicious EXCEPT the mango margarita. That was so bad I had to have it taken back and taken off my bill.",sxFLHbJx2wRDuZqQSX76LQ,4,1,2,S1viEYHoZFjq-sgKHuD0AQ

First off we had no clue that getting a card first would benefit us. So we bought cocktails and got on the waiting list for a table for dinner. Waited about an hour btw..
So we then proceed to the front and ask about the place since no one greeted us at the door and told us anything about the place. There was 4 of us adults and we were under the impression this was a fun place for ADULTS! Uh yeah NO. There were little kids running around and screaming everywhere like we were at one of those children pizza places and a bunch of teens being loud and obnoxious. 
In the restaurant area we ordered a full rack of ribs, the calamari and totts with bacon and other toppings. The RIBS WERE AWFUL and overcooked! THAT CALAMARI WAS THE WORSE I've ever had, dry and overcooked and hardly any on the plate, they substituted some of the calamari rings with banana pepper rings. Just awful! 
My friends ordered the philly sandwich and a Salad (I think the lawnmower) which was ok. We treated our friends and it was a waste of our money! Geez! 
Ok now those games. Wow, what a selection......its way smaller there then I had imagined. Kids were bumping and running into us, we couldn't even play a game without a line of people behind us or someone bumping us. This place is just down right awful! 
It blows that I still have a lot of ""chips"" on my card because we only played 3 games! But I will give it to some kid to use because no one in my party enjoyed this place and we will not return!

I gave this D&B 3 stars because although the manager was awesome and the games were fun, our waitress was not personable at all. She barely took our order. We got the triple play, she didn't ask what we wanted on that or about our wings at all. She also took forever and I don't think she smiled one time. The boneless wings were all bread and about the size of a quarter. They were awful. 

The front desk lady or hostess, was not nice at all. She had the worst attitude for someone to be working at the front desk of what's supposed to be a fun and happy place!

2565957,2016-09-04,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"We went to Dave N Busters on a late Saturday afternoon to meet some people from out of town to watch some college football. Having been to other locations in California, I knew they had a large bar area with multiple TVs to watch different games going on that afternoon. While DNB's did have a lovely bar scene with lots of TVs and action going on, their service left something to be desired.

Once getting a seat right away in the bar area, we were greeted by the first waitress. In all fairness, she did state that they were in the middle of a shift change and another waitress would probably be helping us towards the end of our meal. The first waitress was great, got our drinks quickly and when the rest of our party arrived, got theirs as well. We also ordered an appetizer (cheese and spinach dip)  with the first waitress that was delivered piping hot and quite fast.  The second waitress was another story. She took our dinner order with no pen or pad, which was concerning just because she asked us to repeat several times and recited our order back wrong to begin with. We ordered another round of drinks with our dinner order. Then.... Nothing! She must have gotten busy or overwhelmed, but a set of waiters tried to deliver our food and our guests got their food, but they didn't have ours (actually, we later found out she put another table's order under ours and it just so happened the first two items were the same as our guest ordered).  We still had not received our drinks and we had 2 beers and a margarita. She came to the table and started blaming the kitchen and the bar for being busy when other tables around us were fine. At this point we were still waiting over 30 minutes for the rest of our food and our drinks. A manager came and asked where our food was, when we told him we hadn't received it, he seemed upset and went to find out what happened. He kept asking if we ordered together or separate and we told him we ordered together. He brought out some of the food we ordered, but forgot our drinks and basket of chips we had ordered with our dinner (and at the same time). The waitress came back after with 2 of our beers and then made some excuse why we were still waiting for our maragarita. We literally waited yet another 10 minutes after all that time to get the margarita, which was delivered by someone else. A little bit after, our waitress came with another margarita and said they made an extra so he could have it. It was just really bad. Still no chips. We would have ordered at least another round and some more wings, which was the intention, but it was such a mess, we decided to leave at half time and go somewhere else. We still spent well over $150 for the 4 of us.

I understand this place is new, but the difference in service from the first to second waitress was night and day. With all the noise and commotion going on in this place, I'm sure it's hard to concentrate all the time. My suggestion would be to make sure the staff writes down their order and are tested on the menu and table numbers to avoid these types of situations. Also, there were quite a few managers that circled this place, but none were really touching the tables to make sure everything was ok. The one that did visit our table was only concerned with getting out one of the multiple items we were missing and never came and checked again.  It's also a true annoyance when a server blames everyone else but themselves to take responsibility for a mistake. Everyone gets behind, but when you're at our table being very unprofessional speaking about a bar that is obviously getting everyone else's drink out (we were right in front of the bar and multiple people were in and out of there while we waited and waited) and kitchen that is able to make every other table's food, maybe it's time to take responsibility and at least I would have more respect for your troubles.",09TLMTWynFwmHwcUl53ytg,2,0,2,dpLmt7SJU_ZQCYnyvEOQrA
2570988,2017-02-09,6,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Where to begin...

I went to Dave & Busters for the first time last night. The experience with the gaming side, fantastic, the gentleman at the front was very helpful. We had a great time playing the games. I had left my cell phone on a game and someone had turned it in and an employee was able to recover it quickly for me. I was very happy at this point.

We went to eat and that is where it went DOWN HILL. Our waitress, Jasmine, was the worst server (Jasmine) I've ever had at any restaurant, from Florida, to Iowa, California, Thailand and all over the world. This waitress (Jasmine) was incompetent of doing her job. Jasmine was slightly rude, but the biggest issues was she was dealing with the public, when I would only allow her to be a dish washer, or table busser. 

Jasmine NEVER asked any one at our table if we wanted refills, checked on how the food was, or seemed to give a rats behind about anything. 

I ordered a boneless hot wing meal with fries. Then Jasmine told me the happy hour specials which they had half off boneless wing appetizer. So i decided to order that way instead since it is cheaper. Jasmine didn't offer when I said I wanted boneless wings so that was irritating she wasn't trying to HELP. 

I told Jasmine I wanted 2 orders, because it's a happy hour special and considered an appetizer, I wanted to get one early since I knew it would take 45 minuets to get the food. I would take the fries with the second order. 

Jasmine brings the food, and I ask her about the fries, she first tells me she put them with the second order (which is what we talked about) then tells me she decided not to put the second order in yet because she got busy. Well so glad you decide to do what you would like with MY order. I asked her how long it would take for the second order, and she said 7 minuets (that would of been wrong) and I said don't worry about it. I was already irritated and not going to wait another 30 minuets. Jasmine ask if I still want the fries and I said sure, she said it would take 5 minuets. 20 minuets later I flag her down and tell her to not worry about the fries.

Jasmine then tells me the reason the fries didn't come out with the first order (we didn't order it that way I'm now thinking she's on drugs) because she ordered it with the second order.

WRONG, YOU ALREADY TOLD ME YOU DECIDED TO NOT PUT THE ORDER IN BECAUSE YOU WERE BUSY AND FORGOT. So now Jasmine lied to me and tried to blame someone else when she already admitted she did wrong.

Two of us ask for the bill, Jasmine brings his, not mine, takes his and brings it back and leaves. Finally brings my check to me. Charging me for 1 order of wings, and a order of fries. I give her my card and ask her to fix this.

Jasmine comes back 10 minuets later with the updated check (fries cost $1.88 and comps me $1.29) this makes no sense. I notice she didn't bring me a ticket to sign and put the total on. 

I can't take it anymore, this girl was slow, incompetent, rude, and didn't give a crap that she was turning away first time customers of this place of business.

I see another waiter and ask for the manager. She comes over, I tell her the story, and she apologized and didn't charge me for the 1 order of happy wings I had, and I paid for the 1 beer (would of had more but the waitress never offered or asked). I told her I would be happy to tip a buss person as I am not cheap nor trying to get out of paying, but this girl would received a $0.00 tip. She said they tip out at the end of the night.

You are only as good as the people you work with.I offered to tip the busser, but the manager let me know the wait staff tips out. I paid my exact bill $6 and some change for the beer. 

I will NEVER return to this place, my coworkers who were with me will not return as she was rude to them, and I hope this girl is not a waitress at any place I visit. If Jasmine is, I'll leave.

It took me a few minutes to decide what to eat so we placed our order around 8:20pm at that time I also ordered one of their ""sea monster"" drinks honestly mostly because I wanted the monster. Our sever returned with the drink with out the monster and said sorry were out. Ok I understand it does say while supplies last but why wouldn't she come over first and let us know.

She said okay not to worry about the soda and she apologized. As we were walking out our server magically appeared and said the would cash us out for our drinks.

Wait staff is constantly up selling the the power cards for the video games, which is annoying, (just get me another beer or refill on a soda).

2645215,2016-08-12,5,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"I've gone to many Dave & Buster's in california and fell in love with the business because of the fun atmosphere, the great drinks, and the games that they all carried... But I am sadly to say that this Dave & Buster's will need to do a lot of work with their management and service regarding their restaurant. Me and group of friends had arrived at DnB around 8:45 PM excited to check out the new Las Vegas location. Going into the bar we had ordered 10+ drinks from our bartender named Albert which took roughly about 20 to 30 minutes to get all of our drinks, but I totally understand that it was a busy day for them since it was their first ""half off games"" day, along with their drink and food happy hour. The drinks were great tasting and didn't feel like there was too much alcohol or too little alcohol in which I appreciate our bartenders service because he did try his best to accommodate to us and everyone else around us. 

Now around I would say 9:30 PM, we were thinking about whether or not we should get a table to eat at their restaurant because one other friend had told us that there would be a 2 to 3 hour wait for a table. But instead we went ahead and gave it a try just because we were pretty hungry and see if anything changed. We were quoted that we would get a tablet at about 25 to 30 minutes in which we were cool about because it gave us some time to go play some games and hangout a little before getting sat and try their food... It took them an hour and a half to get us a table, in which we had to check in with the host stand a couple times before getting a definite answer on what was going on. 

Now going into dinner our server greeted us with a welcoming greeting and offered us to take our appetizer order and drink order. Luckily we had made it during their appetizer happy hour. Upon taking our appetizer order our server had taken our drink order also. We asked for a beer tower and a few cocktails that we really liked from when we had ordered from the bar when we first came in along with a few other cocktails we wanted to try. Our server had asked for our ID's in which we all handed our drivers license to her. Now all of my friends that had shown their ID's were clearly over the age of 21 especially me. She then had told us that she would have to have her manager check our Drivers license to her. Now in Nevada, if you had acquired your drivers license before the age of 18 you would have a vertical license. On the day you turn 21 is when you would have to renew your drivers license in which you would have to go in a few days early just before the expiration date so that you wouldn't be driving with an expired drivers license. There were 3 vertical license that we had given to her in which the manager themselves came out to our tablet and had to look at us, NOT THE PRINTED DRIVERS LICENSE DATE OF BIRTH ON OUR LICENSE, but just looked at us. After the servers manager gave her the ""okay"" to serve us alcohol. Upon returning our ID's our server was having a hard time figuring out which person was which in which she had almost given the wrong ID to the wrong person and made a remark in which I quote, "" You guys all look the same."" Now as a customer I have never had anyone make that kind remark about me or my friends just because we are all Asian American in which i had found offensive because not one of us had looked alike what so ever. 

Moving onto finishing up our meal and just enjoying everyone's company it was just about 12 o'clock and we had just gotten our checks, but we still had a few alcoholic drinks and had just about 20 more ounces of beer left in the beer tower we had ordered. A large man, who had dreads, wearing a purple shirt under a black sweater vest and glasses told us that they are now closed and that we had to go. In which I had found very rude and inconsiderate with the fact that we were still waiting on the checks with our credit cards in. What had also bothered me was that we were still finishing up our alcohol that we had ordered and the fact that there was another party in a separate room hanging out still and was not told whatsoever that they had to leave by my presumption because I was within view of that separate room perfectly fine. Now I understand that you guys are closed, but you DO NOT tell your paying customers to leave. If he had told us that before we even got our checks or anyone else in that matter, anyone could of just dine and dashed because they had told us to ""We are closed now, so I have to ask you to leave."" We didn't even get to finish our alcohol because of him. By no means should a restaurant do that under any circumstances unless it is an emergency, which I believe there was no emergency at all. 

Sorry D&B but you guys have a lot of work to do with your management team in the restaurant. I don't know how you can tell paying customers to get out just because you closed.",Y4B4x6CNJf89_zk7dXp57w,5,2,1,JhpXw5rkni2LIEdMkZqGDg

SUPER LOUD!!  I get it, games everywhere, lots of people...  Not really a complaint, just didn't expect the sound to be so amplified.  It was like being in a club on the strip type loud.

Food was ok, but a long wait..like 45mins+.  Again, I get it, big venue, plenty people, no prob.  Our server, ""Yaya"", I didn't get her real name, was very nice.  But didn't pay us too much attention after we finally received our food.  Never received refills on our drinks and she pretty much didn't come back til we needed our check.  And wow, that took awhile too.  Like 20mins+.

Now here's the kicker...

I came in on 9/3.  My meal was only supposed to be like $24 and some change.  My gf and I only ordered two things, the Short Rib cheesy mac stack ($12.99) and the Original Bar Burgers ($11+) and water (free,lol).  Ran my card, didn't leave a tip on the check, but left a cash tip on the table.

Fast forward to 9/8, I go to check my account, like I do EVERY WEEK and notice I have a charge from Dave & Busters for $55.55!!  I call them immediately and finally get in touch with someone in the back, Brianna.  I tell her the situation, she tries to find my original transaction, but can't come up with anything.  Instead of me holding she tells me she will call me back when she comes up with something.  I get a call about 15 mins later and says she spoke with her management and they are just going to refund the entire amount!  Awesome, even though I told her that's not necessary, she proceeds to tell me ""they told me $55.55 was really nothing and would be more trouble trying to find the actual receipt and doing a partial refund, so they just said refund the whole ticket"".  Again, I wasn't looking for a whole refund, just wanted them to fix it, but hey whatever they say.  So she takes my card number and says it should take a MAX of 10 days to see the refund and if I didn't see anything by the tenth day (which would have been 9/18) to call back.  Cool, solved.

Fast forward, again, to TODAY 9/23, here I am doing my weekly check up on my account...  NO REFUND IN SIGHT!!!  I call them immediately...  To my surprise, the person I need to speak with picks up the phone.  NOT Brianna, but the Senior Manager, TJ.  I tell him the situation, never received my refund, blah blah..  Again, he can't find ANYTHING!  No record of my original receipt or my card info for the refund that Brianna wrote down and was supposed to submit.  He then says to me, ""I will take care of this, just need your card info""..  UMMMMM, NO!!  WTF?!!  Now my damn card info is just floating around in your back room somewhere??!!  He says ""maam, there are a lot of papers back here everywhere, I'm sure its back here, but I just didn't want you to wait on hold""..  UMMMMM, NO, AGAIN!!!  I told him ""THATS MY CARD INFO!!!""  ""YOU NEED TO FIND IT!!""  After a few minutes of fumbling around he finds my card info, IT WAS NEVER SENT OFF!!  And of course I have to wait another 10 damn days!!  Now, it will be over a MONTH til' I get my refund!!  TJ was nice, but I just feel like the management and staff are lacking professionalism.  I mean seriously, read the most recent reviews on this place, its pretty scary.  And no representative from the company or this branch has responded to any comments.  Servers short-changing checks, rude staff members, the list goes on and on.  Please be careful going here, I don't recommend it at all.

During the first week of operations in their first store in Nevada, I went twice and was pleased with both experienced. 

The games: the selection of games is similar to what you would expect in any major arcade. Basketball hoops, racing games, old school arcade games, just all that you would hope. There is about 100 total different games and the prices are fair. On Wednesday (half price games) me and my pops spent an hour and half there for $14 each. On Thursday for $12 I was there for about 1 hour. 

Customer service: I was quite surprised with how many employees were here both days. I am not sure if this was just for the first week or if this is for the future, but since they were staffed very well the customer service was great.

They have just about everything you can imagine including 21st century versions of classic 20th century games. For example giant Pac Man and a large modern version of Galaga, one of my all time favorites.  This place is extremely loud!  Sensory overload on the eardrums. With all the chatter of the patrons as well as all the sounds of the video machines the decibel level can compare to a concert venue.

We did not get to eat because we werr quoted a nearly 2 hour wait to get a table. I DON'T THINK SO! We made the reservation anyways but went somewhere else in DT Summerlin instead.  Our buzzer went off after about 45 minutes because I am sure everyone else said screw this wait. I did browse the menu and vegetarians beware there is not much for you to enjoy besides salad minus the meat or portobello mushroom burgers. The prices also seemed very $$ to $$$. 

We had fun overall but the place was at capacity for a Friday night and at times a line for some games. With that amount of people I could see trouble brewing here very easily.

I know how restaurants need to get the kinks worked out when they first opened so we avoided it on purpose.  From the loading of cards, to employees on the floor, everyone was very pleasant.  This place has a lot of cool games and since this place is new, they all work perfectly.  I opted to get the tickets put on the players card instead of carrying around tickets.  There are cups placed around the arcade to hold your tickets which is nice.  The little redemption center was nice because they actually have a mix of cheap dollar store items, and current name brand stuff.  Prizes are way overpriced, but it is to be expected.  When we went, the lowest credit game was regular skee ball at 2.8 credits I believe, most were 8-9.9 credits from what we played.  I guess they do the decimal systems so you don't feel so bad blowing through your money. :) I wish this place was closer, but I will schlep my boys over here to have some fun. I can't give this place five stars due to cost, three kids at the arcade is expensive, yo!

We ventured to the bar area and eventually found a seat. Once we ordered we waited a long time for the food. I ordered a salad but my meal came out before the salad did. The waitress apologized and said sorry the kitchen is backed up. We started eating and I bit into something hard in my burger. It was a white piece of plastic in my food!  The manager was called over and he said this looks like the plastic clip that holds the burger buns, we will refund you for this meal and then walked away. No customer service skills whatsoever. The games are extremely expensive as well. Would not recommend this place. Game Works has much better customer service.

He made jokes with our kids, made menu recommendations and also explained how the games worked and got us our game cards. The menu was extensive and our food was absolutely delicious! We expected  stale tasteless bar food but this was far from it! Mmm my sirloin, shrimp and lobster pasta dish was one of the best things I've had in a long time. My kids loved their kids meals and they never say that. Our cards were loaded and we were ready to play! The games were awesome! Not too badly priced to where I felt there was no value.

The games are great but the customer service is terrible! My sister and myself took our daughters who are 6 ice skating in downtown Summerlin, so after we decided go to D&B sit for dinner and let the kids play some games after! We sat down right away, but our server never came back so we had to go ahead and find our own menus, after about 15 minutes of waiting. Then manger I'm assuming came by took our order. The food runner and the waitress delivered it the food was low key nasty bar food , we ordered about 75$ worth of stuff I wasn't satisfied, but whatever that's expected I guess . Then we had to go up to the bar since no waitress ever came around to fix my daughters drink because they got it wrong. After we were ready to go we told someone please can we have our check after waiting and waiting no one ever came around with our check we got up! 


The kids were so anxious so we decided  to go play and they could just come find us. Which they did and we gladly paid. What a mess! After we were done our girls were super thirsty so the same bar area where we ate we said let's run up and get some bottled water lmao that took a while we finally got someone and she said oh no kids here, there was a man standing right by us with his son. I totally get that but it's just water and we already we're not happy about earlier. She was so rude and nasty and said well you can sit and order it with a server, are you serious. I then proceeded to tell a manager he just said i can't hear you and didn't give a shit. She finally said I'll just comp it and handed us two bottles of water.

2915214,2017-12-22,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"I have been here twice, once just to play games and the second time to eat and play. Both times there was a good amount of people there, but because it is so big it is not an issue. They have happy hour pricing and on Wednesday do half price games.

THE FOOD: We came in and waited right at the front of the first visible dining area and waited about 10 minuets before we were told we could seat ourselves. At least from what we saw, nothing notified you about seating yourself until we asked someone up front. There is also a dining area where they seat you which I didn't find out until reading reviews. Right when we sat ourselves down someone came over and took our order and returned with our drinks promptly. We ordered two different burgers and both were actually pretty good. The only downside was it was a little pricier than what we expected and personally don't think I'd eat there again for my first choice. It is something to try once because most of their menu is over the top which is fun every once and a while. I would recommend checking their menu out online before coming in, and might even say just eat before coming in as dinner and the games add up quickly. 

THE GAMES: Hands down the best part. There's a ton of different options and even if it's crowded there's so many games you can always find one open. You get a little card (like a debit card) that you load coins on so you can swipe and play the games. Your points are loaded onto your card after each game and never expire so you can come back and use it again. 200 or so coins lasted us about an hour and a half and we enjoyed every second. The games, based on what I earned, give an awesome amount of tickets. We even hit jackpot on 3 different games just on our last two visits, so the games are easy. The prizes are attainable and not just candy and plastic bracelets.

Go in on a Wednesday for half price games, load $30 onto your card and you will have hours of fun with whoever you are with. This is what we will be doing.",koF5gxXPiXwRRtw8YzZq6w,2,1,4,Zp7t0j4aAAcgRhpA80F1Zg

Being a native of this city, I have only had the opportunity of visiting one other Dave & Buster's in St. Louis, MO. Other than this one being a lot smaller, I'd say they have the same set up pretty much everywhere. 
I am personally a HUGE fan of places who cater to families, and not just ones with small children. I am a young mom with a 14 year old, and this place is perfect for a decent priced dinner, and safe entertainment for all ages, especially those older, hard to please young adults. (or parents who'd enjoy a cocktail while playing games)
We recently had a work event here as, and it was a huge success. The event/catering staff were so helpful. From set up of our presentation, to lettings us borrow a cord when we didn't have one, down to the salmon, I was impressed! 
Sure, you may not get the top of the line steak and seafood, but I don't think you come here expecting that either. I love the prizes they have in exchange for the game play. Shot glasses, and kitchen gadgets, HECK YES! 
I would also like to point out that Metro is on property keeping people in line when needed. Their presence is appreciated, when its midnight, people are drinking and getting loud, and unfortunately do not always know how to act. I was pleased to see the police escorting out some obnoxious, disrespectful patrons with their pants down to their knees, a pacifier in their mouths, and loud uncalled for language.

3114642,2017-02-22,1,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"This review is mainly for the bar/restaurant area...

I was so excited when I first found out that D&B was coming to Vegas. Locals used to be teased with the commercials on TV, when we didn't even have one here!

I never reviewed this place since my first visit because of the experiences I've had with the bar side. I've given this place so many chances to redeem themselves, but every time I come here, the same thing happens over and over. It's the main reason why I gave this joint a 3-star rating.

I understand if an eatery is busy and the staff may not always be on top of customer service, but even when it's slow? Eh... Whenever my group sits down at the open-seating area, we're always waiting. Always. Even if we sit right next to the bar, it's a waiting game.

The last time I came here to eat, I waited almost 20 minutes just to get drinks! Another 10 minutes to order food. However, the most recent visit here was much better. Our server and busser kept coming back to see if we needed anything else and how our food was. Their menu items are mostly bar-styled, but it's pretty good. No complaints there.

All in all, I don't expect much from a bar/restaurant that's connected to an arcade. I take into consideration the informality of the place, but improvements can be made. Playing the arcade games never fail though! They're just missing that horse/derby game that I see at every D&B. lol

Pro-Tips:
-This place can get VERY busy on the weekends. Don't expect much when eating here on those days. You might be waiting for awhile.
-Seating can be confusing. They have an open-seating area where you choose where to sit, and a secluded section where the staff leads you to a table.",EEAoUs1w38JHfHZMeSdqPQ,8,5,3,s8be0M_5vO_URclvl0cZIQ

3141589,2016-11-21,1,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Dave & Buster's seems to be one of those places that is a HIT or MISS! I unfortunately got the MISS this past weekend. I was excited for Las Vegas to finally get a location because it was so annoying to see the commercials on TV for a place that didn't even exist in my city ugh!

My godson wanted to have himself a ""big boy"" party here so of course we made that happen! The staff.. Wow what can I say I just have to say that the employee's you hire for your business play such a crucial roll and will help make or break your establishment. The staff here have to be some of the worst I've ever encountered in terms of one of these ""Eat & Play"" kind of places. I'm from California and have been to that location several times, never experienced the poor service we got this weekend. When I arrived to the party it was after it started and of course it was a madhouse in here. I stood at the front for at least 7 minutes while two of the hostess girls talked with what looked like was either a friend or an employee. Do that on your own time darling you are working. What made matters even worst was the fact they both looked at me and just kept on talking.. Oh okay.. Finally somebody from off the floor asked me ""Are you here for a birthday party"" I replied with the name of my godson and she says with an attitude ""Which one there's 3 by that name and what's his age"" I just walked off and decided to find the party myself.

Fast forward to the party area. The food that is offered is sorry as ever. My best friend was so disappointed with the amount of money that was spent for such low quality food. We would've been better buying some food from the frozen food aisle at the store heating it up, putting it in some foil and distributing it ourselves! These pizza bite things were gross and the chicken fingers were dry, burgers were I hope burger's lol list goes on. Just a fail. The server that worked our party poor thing, she wasn't even the original one that was assigned. We had another one who mysteriously just disappeared. Not sure if she just got overwhelmed with our large party size but seemed a bit unprofessional to just bounce like that with no word! After we paid they pretty much kicked us out of the table and gave us one of those ""You don't gotta go home, but you gotta get the hell up outta here"" speeches. NO problem. As we were leaving, well attempting to leave there was a lockdown on the place because of a missing child. They have a procedure where nobody can leave when a child is missing. Interesting I'd like to understand this concept because it's odd.

All in all it was borderline terrible. The only thing that was good was my ""Tres Patron"" drink from the bar. The adults ordered alcoholic beverages and my mom got the watermelon margarita which was pretty awesome because the ice cubes were actually watermelons! It's odd here that you pay for the drink before you even get to taste it but that's whatever. Hopefully when I try this place out on a different occasion I can update my review and provide a much better experience.",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,8,1,2,phUVnRs3Qft13sL3kRo1Bw

3252247,2017-12-02,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"This was the worst night ever.

My 10 year old son was treated rudely by a terrible costumer on the arcade floor (when he tried to kindly show the a nasty woman where the card comes out of the machine she said to the man with her: ""The kid thinks he can get my card."" 
I told my son that was rude and he shouldn't be quiet about such behavior. She pretended not to hear me. Then she took her time and played at least 5 more rounds. I have patience and we waited.
My son played one round and then she came back with the man accompanying her. Pushed me away and said she wanted to play with my kid. That's creepy. I said he doesn't want to play with you, since you were rude to him. 
Then she said: that's sexist! When someone doesn't know what sexist means, it's embarrassing. For them. 
Then I said please allow him to play, since he waited for you to play several rounds. And I told her when you don't know when and where to use the term ""sexist"" don't use it. Then she said: ""Says the big fat lady.""
My son was so upset at the point and I went to the manager and told her she needs to deal with this much insult.
The management did nothing to help. 
She offered free points to my son. That's not how I deal with problems, and that's not how I want to teach the right behavior to my kid. I said no, and insisted on her taking care of the mess.
She said I'll go talk to them. She didn't. She want intimidated or didn't want to or whatever her deal was. She stood next to me and tried to apologize for them! So she wouldn't have to go talk to nasty woman and the man accompanying her.
I took out my phone to look up Dave and Buster's phone or anything on their website to file a complaint. I didn't have my glasses on and had to hold the phone farther. The man with her started taking pictures of me! I wasn't even facing them.
I told her I don't want my pictures in his phone. She talked to him. He said I did it first. The manager believed him! Just beautiful!
The Metro officers on the floor where useless. They told me this is the company's private property and they can't do anything!
The manager said go to the other side of the floor so you don't see them! Seriously?! 

Here is the great ending; I asked her if I'm not white enough to be treated equally and fairly. The she asked us to leave. The Metro officers said I had to leave since the manager asked me to. The entire time the sick nasty woman was playing and laughing at me and my son.

I won't let this go. That manager needs to see the consequences of such poor decisions.

3255641,2017-02-07,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Went here at the request of my son for his birthday. My youngest son has been dying to go to this since it opened. So, when his birthday rolled around, we decided we'd go. We purposely went in the middle of a Monday afternoon to avoid crowds. 

This place is so overpriced for what you're actually getting. The food was awful. I got a burger that was shaped in a perfect circle, indicating it was simply a frozen patty that was heated up. It was the most bland burger I've ever had. The fries weren't bad. My husband and one of my sons had the Philly cheese steak sandwiches. They complained the cheese sauce was super salty. They would have preferred real cheese. My husband said it wasn't terrible but way overpriced for what it was. My daughter had chicken fingers and again, she said they were ok but not worth the price. The prices are steep for what amounts to bowling alley food. 

The games are fun but the cards are pricey and you have to spend a lot to earn a substantial amount of tickets that earn you cheap crap. Everything in the store could be purchased somewhere else for much less. My kids each got $20 gaming cards and racked up some tickets. One of my kids spent all their tickets on an umbrella hat and some candy. So, $20 for an umbrella hat and candy. I can buy an umbrella hat for $5 on Amazon and the candy for like a $2 tops. So, we spent $20 for $7 worth of junk. You could argue there is value in the fun that was had from playing the games. But there are several arcades around the valley that offer that kind of entertainment for a much better price. 

My son is happy that he got to check it out. It was fine one time. But I seriously do not see us returning.

3277348,2016-08-12,2,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"I love the arcade games that Dave & Busters have, my first time being at the California locations. Knowing that one in Summerlin opened up, I was really excited to finally be able to go to D&B without having to vacay to Cali. The main reason why I am giving them a 1 star is because of their customer service, the main priority an establishment like this place should focus on.

My first night being at this location, I was really pumped! Drinks, food and arcade games. Where can you go wrong? Turns out, I was. The bar was straight up packed during happy hour (9pm-closing), and it took a while to get our drink orders in AND to get the drinks, roughly about 30 mins. But the bartender, Sean, was able to tend to multiple customers, including a small party of three of me and my two friends while everyone was shouting at him to get some drink orders in. Way to stay calm and cool, Sean. Four for you, Glenn Coco. After playing a couple of games and got some drinks, we decided to put our name on the waiting list for the restaurant to grab a small bite to eat before heading back on the floor. I don't remember our server's name but she was friendly. The only problem was she didn't know anything that was on happy hour and that there were certain appetizers that were on happy hour when we asked her these questions. That's something a server should definitely know to further better your guests experience. The food came at a timely manner. We ordered the sliders wings and fries appetizer platter and the nachos along with their $2 tacos but the food was ehhh. But it filled our stomachs up. After eating, we went back out on the floor and over the intercom, they give a shout saying its last call for games. Literally, it was last call. The minute it turns midnight, they shut them boys off like they lost electricity in the building. Had fun but the employees didn't make anything better except for our boy Sean.

Second night we came in, we came with a bigger party of roughly about 8 or 9 of us. It was a Wednesday and on Wednesdays, it's half price on the games the entire day. Half prices on games drinks and food? Yessir. So shout outs for that but whoever wants to come this day, prepare for it to be busy. We got to the bar roughly around 9pm exact just to get that happy hour price. Another bartender, Alfred, was up for the challenge.  It took him a while to get to us because of everyone constantly shouting drink orders. The time was now 930pm when he did get to us. We ordered roughly about 10+ drinks and it only came to about 50 bucks. That's deals. But the drinks did take another 15 minutes for them to reach us. So we lost 45 mins of playing time. We also decided to put our name on the waiting list because we wanted to get some food again, this time trying out different items and getting that happy hour pricing. They quoted our party about 20-30 mins. We were shocked that it was quoted so little, being a party of 9 and with how busy the entire D&B was. Every table was taken. So we were skeptical. Guess what? We were right. It took 2+ hours to finally get us a table AFTER checking in every 30 mins on the status for our table. So we couldn't even really get to enjoy playing games since we were expecting to be called soon and end up being seated at roughly 11pm. We were seated and our server was Daisy. For the most part, she was very friendly and nice. Wasn't overwhelmed with our party and was really calm when we placed our orders, having split checks and everything. When we ordered drinks from her though, she had to check our IDs. Normal protocol. But two of our friends had vertical IDs, one of them being a 23 year old and the other, freshly turned 21 for a couple weeks. She must of thought his ID was fake as Daisy had to double check with a manager to make sure the ID was legit because it was vertical. Hrmmmm. That's not right. Why not take both IDs then? Not just one. And in addition to that, when she took another 3 of our friends IDs, she said "" I don't know which one of you guys is which, you guys all look the same."" Yes, we are all Asian. BUT NONE OF US LOOKED THE SAME ONE BIT. No relation to each other at all! And she came to me with the 3 IDs and was looking at all 3 of them while looking at me to see if I was one of the IDs. She didn't even take my ID. She checked it earlier and didn't take mine away. Fishy to me. Food came out and we were last called it being around 1130-1145 ish. Wouldn't have happened if we'd known we'd be seated so late. To top the night off, another employee who may have been the manager told us, ""I know you guys are having fun but unfortunately, we are closed and you guys have to leave."" We didn't even finish our drinks and they were all full. AND when we got them so late. AND we didn't even get our cards back from paying the bill. Time for us to leave.

Unfortunately, my first choice, the dim sum restaurant is now out of business.  Didn't realize that I hadn't been in the area in such a long time.

So since its been years since we've been to a D&B, my husband made the final decision.  Going to D&B is scary for me because I know how much my husband loves his video games.

The menu has changed quite a bit over the years. Per our waiter, the menu was updated this past February.  Choosing an entree was a little difficult for me, do I go with the fish and chips that I've been craving for a couple of days now, that short rib mac and cheese sandwich looks amazing, but so does the CA turkey melt and the Crispy Nashville-style hot Chicken. 

Normally, my husband has me order first, but because I was so undecided, I was very pleased when he got the Short Rib Mac and Cheese sandwich. Better yet, it comes with TOTS!

My husband did enjoy his sandwich. With the kick bite I got from it, the bread is so buttery and nicely toasted. The short ribs, nice and tasty and sweet and with the sweetness from the ribs on the mac and cheese, it was Oh so good!.  And tots, was alright.

As for my fish and chips, it was alright, but really oily. The chips, were nice and crunchy. The dipping sauce for the fish was a little too malty for me.

We received great service. And because it was Sunday and busy, our service was a little slow.

As for the location for the bathroom, we were directed to what I guess is the only facility, next to the huge Connect 4.

The second time I came here, the service was worse than the first. First and foremost, Dave and busters isn't known for awesome food nor are they known to be fancy, so with that being said, the service should be somewhat decent. Our server, Johana, seemed to be bothered by our existence. I get it, long day dealing with people or whatever the issue may be, but keep your problems to yourself and welcome to corporate America my friend. Fake a smile, pretend you like your job and be grateful you even have one. The service industry is tough, I understand that... But if your sole job is customer service, simple math calculations (cashiering) and serving and you can't do any of those qualifications that you were asked/expected of you, why did you apply for this job? We had a giant group that came in and she didn't want to put the tables together and expected us to stand around one small table. She then made a comment that we were mean cause we asked to move the tables together and we even offered to move them ourselves and put them back. Not sure how that was mean of us? We ordered a beer tower which took 30 minutes to get and the lady behind the counter gave it to us because Johanna didn't want to serve us the beer. She asked someone else for whatever reason. She didn't apologize for the wait nor did she apologize for the crummy attitude. She gave us the bill with no receipt and change only which seemed weird.

3479450,2018-01-20,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,I would like to let the world know how terrible the management is at this place. They should not get any stars. I have no idea how they got their jobs but they should be fired today! Their names are Jillian and Amadh. They do not know how to handle their own establishment when there is an issue. We had bought tokens in advance online and the cards were not loaded when we got here. The managers could care less and did not try to accommodate at all. They wouldn't even offer us a free dessert or discount. They told us we had to buy more tokens here. I cannot stand horrible customer service! It is so simple to fix an issue by taking care of guests by a small gesture. They did nothing!!!!! Y'all suck!!!! I hope you guys lose business.,5dwWVZU7zyaPhMJepMHf8g,1,0,1,9D6MgK-CSMI6gzVMdJ8LdA
3494418,2018-06-30,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"This was a creative and unique experience!  I will break this review into two parts, food and entertainment.
Let's begin with the food; the burger was well proportioned the fries were very tasty and seasoned well, however a lot of the food was very bland. The adult tasty beverages were well priced and tasty, feel free to enjoy a couple of them on happy hour.
Second, the entertainment. This establishment is really geared for kids and young teens. It is full of video arcade games some of the games will give you tokens someone I'm not. It is extremely noisy and many of the games to play are very expensive. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the virtual reality ride with the dinosaurs. Sadly it was very expensive at five dollars a person for less than two minutes of entertainment.
Over all, I would do this experience again. I don't suggest doing it at 5 PM at the height of dinner perhaps a little later if you were going with adults and perhaps a little earlier if you're going with small children.",l_fCnDWlT6UFLxwqguI_2g,0,0,3,lZCobqrQP7goZd8h7Jhhmg
3499013,2016-08-11,4,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Let's face it.. Dave & Busters is one of those places where even if you receive extremely poor service, you will go back because of the genius concept of games, food, and cheap alcohol, all in one place.  That's exactly what happened here. 

Despite the great concept, I had to give this location 3 stars due to the inconsistent service & lack of management. However, I understand it's only been open for 4 days. 

Great job on the door-men who open the door and greet you as well as the main helpful ""front desk"" women who held it down with the dozens of lost people in line. Second, Alfred/Alfredo, our bartender was very friendly despite the busyness there was at the one bar. Side note- build a second bar? Third, the hostesses were giving different quote times for my friends & I. When we decided to check in for a table, they quoted us 30 mins. About 55 minutes later, we finally got seated. Next, our server Daisy took care of our party fairly smoothly. The only issue we had was the offensive remark she made in regards to saying all 3 of my male Asian friends look the same. Keep in mind all 3 people had no common features in height, weight, skin tone, hair, smile, eyes, or eyewear. This was after she tried taking my friend's vertical ID to her manager. I'm 23 & also have a vertical ID. Why did she disregard mine? Nevada photo IDs are good for 8 years, therefore if someone receives their license at the age of 16, then of course it'll still be vertical after they turn 21. Lastly, the taller gentleman with the headset who was in charge of the very back table area told us they were closed & we had to go. We got our appetizers, drinks, then dessert before the dinner food, then dinner food, then second round of drinks & then checks before this happened. However, we were still waiting to get our credit card back & finishing up drinks. If you ask me, that's not common courtesy at all. Don't kick someone out when it's your staff that we're waiting for. Maybe if we got sat within the expected time frame, we would've left earlier so your staff could go home. 

Thanks Dave & Busters for your great concept & nice venue for Vegas, but please enforce a better system. I hope to give a better updated review in the future.",XqsuWJIwdy0OXYvUX1I2-Q,9,3,3,rhlEVZRXaB9Ggeg-oq3jDQ
3513165,2017-03-24,1,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"My boyfriend and I went here Wednesday night and had a pretty good experience, fun little date night because we just got to feel like kids for a little bit. It wasn't crowded which made our experience a little bit better as well.

We first ate and I liked that they had deals to where certain meals you choose can give you a certain amount of points. Food wasn't terrible but it also wasn't 5-star dining. We got great, fast and friendly service. I like that they have a huge variety of food and drinks on their menu, we also caught them at Happy Hour. I didn't give that 5th star for the quality of the food and prices. Again, food wasn't terrible but wasn't amazing either. It can get a little pricey, two drinks, two meals, an appetizer plus  a little over 250 points added to our players card came out to almost $100.

Your points go by pretty quickly! Loved all the variety of different games but you just keep swiping your card to play to the next minute being out of points which is where it starts to get pricey again. They do have a big variety of prizes that you can cash in for which was a plus as well.

It's cool to come and spend $10 - $20 on arcade games to pass some time with friends. Not something to do all the time, as it could get old quick. The prizes aren't anything crazy cool or out of the ordinary from your usual upscale arcade, and for the amount of money you need to spend to win the amount of tickets for the large prizes is absurd, of course that goes without say though. They have to make money somehow.

The food is delicious! Absolutely! Though it is quite expensive for some higher-end-like bar food. The specialty alcoholic beverages are pretty cool, too, though again... the cost isn't something that's at all appetizing.

Love that it's in a local neighborhood! 

Came on opening night, which was obviously busy. But not too busy where we could quickly sit at the bar for some drinks. 
It was happy hour to $1 off wines and draft beers. Also half off liquor! Chachiiiiiiing*****

I wasn't hungry but ordered wine and the roomies ordered draft beers. The beers came in big glasses and I swear there were 10 bartenders at the bar! lol at least 2 different bartenders were asking us if we needed help. 
Although we didn't eat, the BBQ ribs the guy next to us was eating smelled hella bomb. 

There were numerous, and I DO MEAN NUMEROUS --- maybe 8 to be exact --- tvs at the bar, along with on the restaurant walls. Almost felt like I was at a sports book. We watched a few rounds of Olympics water polo matches before playing some games. 

I got an email from DT Summerlin for their opening earlier in the day which gave a coupon for $20 worth of gaming with $20 card purchase. 
We redeemed that and paid an extra $2 for the card itself. 
All the workers are still learning so that whole card purchase took some time. 
She also mentioned for an extra $6, we could get 50 extra chips/play in our card -- ok, sure; why not. 

All in all the boys played few rounds of basketball, skeeball, and air hockey. There were so much of each game that the wait, if any, wasn't too long.

Our server was nice, but we had multiple issues including her telling us that the manager was not allowing us to take the ""sea monster"" figures in the tiki drinks despite it saying that these were included on the website AND the menu.

Also, 10 minutes before closing there was a ""last call"" for games and despite the fact that some games (that you paid for as a patron) lasted more than ten minutes there were police officers and staff that stood behind you with folded arms (do they pay you extra for that?)

We ordered one of each - tacos, shrimp, sliders, bang bang chicken, etc.  I would only order the chicken, tacos and the artichoke dip again, the rest I would order from the regular menu.  Drinks were great - happy hour 1/2 off cocktails.  It was Monday night football so they had the game on the many large screens they have. It was viewable from any location.  It was self-seating, so hard for the server to determine who was already seated and who just sat. As a result, I sat for awhile before finally flagging down a server.  That could use improvement.  Once getting service, he did his best to provide great service. I don't think it was him but it was slow between when he could help us.  

The powercard and all the different offers became confusing - from the online sign-up offer, to the food/card combo, to credits from purchasing food, to getting a card... I finally figured it out with the help of a few other customers and the information desk.  The game play area is dark and a bit noisy (could be with age that it bugs me now).  My daughter loved it - an upgrade from Chuck E Cheese, but way more expensive.  I would recommend going on Wednesdays when games are 1/2 off. They get you since you buy credits and games cost credits instead of $$ so you don't realize the game could be $1.75 to play.",rBpEEgJ_lzQaXeoaynmgeg,2,2,3,z_4qH7lIdKjqxfxacSBSOQ

The cashier ended up giving us 2 bonus $20 cards for spending over $100, not a bad deal. We signed up at the kiosk registering the cards and for that we will get a coupon for a free $10 card when one spends $10. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful guiding the store and how much each card gets with questions we asked. The game floor is amazing and I believe that we lost time in here since when we came in it was light outside then dark when we departed. We enjoy playing the games with tickets since then one can redeem for prizes. 

We did not eat here, but there is a bar. I ordered a vodka tonic and it was ok, but people do not come here for the drinks. If one does want to get drunk here drink beer instead. When redeemed our tickets there is a store area where patrons feed them to a machine or one can have the cashiers add them manually. The prizes here are so cool and attainable too. The twins walked away with a bag full of fun and joy, mission of fun and being young accomplished.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,15,13,5,HbkNAVZg8nHSktRGTmgcHA

We had empty glasses sitting on our table for 10 minutes before he came around to ask if we wanted refills. Then when asking about the food he flat out told us it wasn't good, and that we should only order certain things and then proceeded to name about 3 things that he said were good. Being a server I'm all for suggestions but don't tell a table that the food here is terrible. We knew what to expect when choosing to go to Dave and busters. We order the crispy potato cakes which were actually however we had to ask him multiple times so but the time he brought them to us the food was still barely warm. I understand when a server is busy that they may not be able to get you everything you need as quick as you would ideally like it but when I see you standing around chit chatting with co workers instead of getting things we asked for that's when I get upset. Needless to say our server made our experience terrible.",fBdD69y-O15tDxy2yXZBUA,0,0,2,xU5kggCfaMrUeYQREoo19w
4055010,2017-01-08,7,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Dave & Buster's usually doesn't need an introduction because they're found all over.  But it's new here and some type of brief introduction is needed.  Best way to describe a Dave & Buster's....it's a Chuck E' Cheese for kids and adults.  I don't have little one anymore.  She's now an adult.  But when she was a child, she loved Dave & Busters.  Her competitive juices would flow, she would play games just for the tickets, and later hit up the gift shop.  I was that proud dad that would spend over $50 on games to win a $10 toy.  Yup, as long as my princess was happy, I was happy. 

Times have change and I no longer find D&B as fun as it used to be. It's loud and this location's no different. This location is the smallest D&B that I have ever been to.  The games are newer and cost a grip to play.  Is it me or are the games that win tickets just getting harder and harder to win at?  As for the food, I haven't tried a lot here. The only items that I tried was their burger, the sliders, the fries, the ribs, the salmon, the wings, the chicken breast, the tenders, the onion rings, the onion strings, the pretzel dogs, the nachos, the pizza, and tots.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  I also had their calamari, the quesadilla, spinach dip, cheese sticks, NY steak, BBQ chicken, and mac & cheese.  Other than that, I really haven't tried much of their food.  The only item that really stands out is their ribs and BBQ chicken.  Now, those are pretty damn good. 

I have also been here for a meeting.  Having a meeting here is pretty cool. D&B set us up in a private room with a few lunch options from the menu.  After the meeting, a D&B employee set us up on a scavenger hunt.  This was fun and I highly recommend.  D&B gave prizes and swag to the winners.  And by the way, my team won.  

The last time I was here was with my girlfriend, our friend, and our friend's son. My girlfriend and friend played the giant sized Pac-Man, while I spent time with our friend's son playing video games.  He loved all the games, PR'd a few of them, and had a smile from ear to ear.  That's enough to put a smile on face too.  If he's a fan, then I'm a fan.  4 Stars!!!

But the games are great! Absolutely worth your $$. We had a birthday party here and everyone was able to jump on their games without too much of a wait on a Saturday. Lots of fun can't wait to go back and use the rockem sockem robots. It was out of order when we went on Saturday.,xH8mfI-I6Pyb_yTh5v01BQ,0,0,4,lYQ0eooCOiACHRS-sFVfJA

We asked the cashier if there were any specials and the cashier was rude and only focused on the game cards. So we purchased three $29 cards for our kids and let them go. As we met our baseball team at the table, our friends told us about the food/ game card combo (includes unlimited games and a meal for $4 leas than what we paid per card for just 170 credits worth of games). Long story shortened, Jillian the manager refunded our original cards even tho our kids spent some of the credits, and then set us up with with 3 of the game/ food combos. She was very professional and apologetic that the original cashier was rude and did not offer the combo even tho we had asked. What started off as a 2 star review ended with a 5. A great deal for $26 to get a meal and unlimited play after first 120 credits are depleted. The second cashier we spoke with was very helpful as well.

She was so rude to the customer in front of us and to us that I had to ask to speak to the manager. I told him she should not be working the front counter because of her awful attitude and that I was concerned her eyes were going to fall out of her head because she was rolling them back the entire time she was helping the customers. When we left she was still at the counter.  Clearly the manager DOES NOT care about customer service because a woman with that much attitude needed to go home for the day not continue servicing customers who are walking into have a good time. The manager also mentioned this was a reoccurring problem and that I wasn't the first to complain about her. Shame on the manager for ruining paying customer's evenings!!!  For the first time games weren't working and they didn't have enough service employees on the floor.  Hope this isn't how it's going to be from now because we love coming to play the games.  We WILL NOT be coming back if we're going to be treated like garbage because the manager can't train his team members!,4OB83KHfJ8y13mmxCiyJrg,0,0,2,OpFeTpNT5Q-fyqQmVEY7eg

The games are decent, but kind of expensive. There was a line at several of the more interesting and popular games, and im not a fan of lines. It was noisy, a little overcrowded, and had lots of kiddos running around which isnt great if you are carrying a beer.

4119439,2016-08-09,8,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Lesson from this review: Terrible management on the game floor!
1 star cause I'm forced to give a star and the restaurant earned it.
Why -4 stars??
I ALMOST twisted my ankle while playing a game because it was built badly. I told the manager to fix it and to prevent any more injuries, NICELY. The manager of amusement, Jose, said he can't fix the Pump It Up Prime machine because it is ""standard"" and built by ""professionals"". The ones in California are completely different and are SAFE to play on.
My group of friends and I suggested to raise it so it is safer and giving the game a longer life span, instead of having people break it within a few months due to constant stomping cause it's too low.
The manager refused to fix it and threaten us that he may remove the game and we could ruin it for all other players. He said EXACT ""If they don't want to play, other people can play, we don't need their money"" right in front of us. Well since they don't need MY money, maybe they will be okay without YOUR money too.
I REALLY wanted to like Dave & Busters because it's closer to my place and because I love arcades. Maybe this is a sign to stick to Gameworks or Round 1 in Industry City to play video games.
It was their first day opening to the public. The fact that management is willing to treat their customers with such little respect, shows they do not care about the company or customers who come in. Please avoid this, or go.. Since I already spoke to a manager and they are not willing to fix it, you can sue because the manager won't do anything about it even AFTER the issue was addressed.

The bar and restaurant were great though!! The waiter, Samuel, was attentive and got everything we needed. We had two managers check up on us and made sure everything was spectacular. *sigh* if only the game floor had the same customer service skills then this review would be a 5 Star. Since Dave & Busters isn't a go to play to eat, I wouldn't come back.
Don't lean on the machines or they get mad and you must be over 18 to enter or be accompanied by someone over 25 AT ALL TIMES. No outside food or drinks even though it's not posted (not posted means they LEGALLY can't ban outside food/drinks), outside drinks including water bottles like arrowhead and Dasani. Guess they want you to get their FREE tap water??

4135822,2016-10-20,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Went there last night and had a lot of fun playing the games. It was even half price token night which was really cool. They have a great selection of video, ticket and carnival games. Very innovative games and alot of stuff that I've never seen before. Then we went to get food...... first let me say that the wife and I both work in restaurants on the strip but try not to be super critical because we realize that the casinos are more strict about the customer service aspect of the job. We walked up to the hostess(Danielle) and asked her if kids were allowed on the dining side to which she answered with a very short yeah and then just kinda looked at us. I said ""three"" because I felt it was my responsibility to break the awkward silence. She then walked us to the table and set the menus down and walked away without saying anything. We thought maybe she was just having a bad night but the longer we sat there we noticed her turning around to glare at us on several occasions and even saw her walk a couple to their table while literally looking up at the ceiling rolling her eyes. She looked very unfriendly to say the least. After that the server came over and was really nice. Her name was Jasmine. We ordered the pretzel dogs and the rib,chicken and shrimp platter. Everything was awesome! The ribs were delicious. We finished everything and decided to order the regular order of ribs but wanted to sub out the honey bourbon barbeque for the sweet chili sauce we had already gotten because my wife is allergic to alcohol and we really like the first set of ribs. Any way long story short the ribs came out with the bourbon bbq sauce and not the sweet chili soy that we requested. We told our server and she said she would fix the problem and bring them back for us. Then the manager came to the table and asked what the issue was with the ribs. We told him we just wanted the honey chili soy sauce instead of the bourbon bbq to which he rudely replied ""did you even try the sauce? Because i did and those ribs had the chili sauce on them."" I explained that we just got the trio and the sauce that came on the 2nd ribs was absolutely not the same as the 1st set from the trio. The sauce was darker and looked more like bbq sauce than the 1st set from the trio. The manager seemed annoyed so we got upset and just cancelled the ribs and left. So all in all the gaming arcade aspect was amazing! Restaurant side was mediocre.....I left feeling very annoyed about the manager arguing with me even though he was the one who didn't know what he was talking about.

4216194,2016-12-16,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Two stars: 1 for our server and 1 for the games. 

Our server was super nice and very attentive. So sorry I didn't get her name, but nice girl with short black hair with a fade. She was awesome! 

The games were expensive, yes, but that is to be expected. It was worth the money to get some fun, vibrant, LED games. We had a blast! 

The 3 stars it is lacking comes with the restaurant hostess staff, the game redemption staff and the food. We had never been there before and I had my underage daughter with me. We walk up to the front of the restaurant, 3 feet from them, and they act like they don't see us. But we're making eye contact. No one speaks. Finally, I speak up forcing them to address me. I simply wanted to know ""Where can I sit with her to eat?""  I was told ""anywhere"". Um, okay. Wow. 

We sit to in the restaurant to eat some food. The menus make the food look awesome.....it's a lie. The food was close to inedible. I didn't complain, because I was afraid they would bring me more disgusting food. I had the burger. It tasted like bad meat and was very fishy. The cheese was burnt too. It was horrible. My stomach turned trying to eat it. The fries were okay. Some kind of seasoning makes them weird too. I ask for ranch. That's safe, right? Wrong. Even the ranch tastes like rosemary or something strange in it. Yuck. 

My daughter had the little pretzel dogs. Basically, pigs in a blanket. The wieners tasted and looked like beef jerky and the crescent rolls seemed raw. I didn't say anything to her about my food. She says ""Mommy, this is gross."" So there you have it. 

Fast forward to after we ate and played games. The two very young girls running the prize area were very nice but just need some training on what to talk about and not talk about in front of customers. I'm not a prude, I could care less. I just imagine some people might not like the awkwardness. I walked up with my daughter and the girl says very loudly to me ""Yeah, this day is going to totally SUCK.""  Lovely. She was nice just needs to chill with that to customers. 

All in all, I would go back for some games, maybe. But eat before you go and don't go if you don't want the loudest experience of your life next to a concert.",WD0X64mPJXKZfjBbezymYg,2,1,2,akkl_zzi_unwGhUZ1STxBw

4254888,2017-07-18,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Aman needs to be fired. Simple as that. I've been in the service industry for 15 years and have never been so disrespected at any establishment in my life. Seeing as how I'm in the same line of work, I am very understanding and forgiving. However, I will never tolerate someone that is rude and disrespectful, especially someone in a managerial position. You literally have one job, which is to ensure that your staff is providing excellent customer service and if service is falling short it is your responsibility to correct the problem at hand. Aman, you failed at this with flying colors. The bar staff was very friendly and apologetic, though service was very lacking. Showed up to the established around 10:15, bar closes at 12. Ordered a round of drinks, one drink came out incorrectly but was consumed nonetheless, no big deal. Attempted to order food, pretzel dogs and loaded tots, waited about 20 minutes before inquiring about our food which we soon came to realize was never ordered due to miscommunication between the bar back and bartender. No big deal, ordered another drink and the food was apparently put in this time around. Food finally came out about 20 minutes later but the order was wrong, we were delivered some sort of pizza bites tho 2 of us don't eat cheese and specified the cheese to be on the side for the tater tots anyways. Then we were told the kitchen was closing so we said no bid deal we will survive without it but were convinced it was no big deal and we could get the proper order with no issues. The proper item was delivered after another 20 minutes and another slow round of drinks later (it's been over an hour now, mind you). But the food showed up nonetheless and it was good after all. However, after all is said and done the bill was dropped and the original incorrect item was on the bill. When acquiring why the original charge was still on the bill, we were informed that it was because both items were the same price. However, after waiting over an hour to get a proper item delivered, it was obviously ludicrous to be paying full price for the staffs mistakes as well as their  lack of sympathy. That is when we asked to speak to a manager. This is when Aman stepped up to the plate to disappoint us further. Aman instantly came over with an attitude, he made it very clear right off the bat that he had no interest in hearing the problem at hand. His first instinct was to assume we were just trying to get a free hand out, which was not the case at all. We had already ordered 10 drinks and 2 food items within the hour and a half we were there and money was no issue. It was the lack of communication and management that was the problem. Though Aman showed no interest in hearing what we had to say, I proceeded to tell him the issues we experienced. He instantly got defensive with us and I explained that if a food item is refired for any reason, it is his responsibility (as the manager on duty) to be aware he f the issue and correct it. He apparently had zero insight that there was even an issue in the first place, which is a major problem. He instantly accused us of trying to get a free item since we ""ate the whole thing"" mind you we waited over an hour for said item and that's after it was negligently never put into the computer and then ordered incorrectly after the fact. He then decided the best way to solve said problem was to tell the customer (aka me and my two coworkers) that he WAS going to help us, but now we can pay full price. He clearly didn't like my 2 cents on how he was failing to do his job. Very mature coming from a grown man in a managerial position. Like I said, I've been in the industry for over a decade, I know how to properly solve guest issues and I have had many managers who know how to do their job. Aman is a disgrace to the industry and if he remains in management, he will run this business into the ground. Simple as that.

Service was a bit slow, although very friendly. We were informed it was Mike's first night and he used to be a barback. The bartender Afton was very nice. Once we had our first round we asked each of them for another. Got one. Then waited. And waited. The bar was busy and all 3 of us are in the industry so we gave the the benefit of the doubt. We then mentioned to Mike we wanted to order food. We were joking around and he laughed and said ok and walked away. It was about 20 mins later and we asked Afton if our food was about ready. She said Mike didn't put it in and so she did. We were just enjoying ourselves on a girls night out so we ignored it... Then the food came out wrong. She thought we ordered pizza bites. But we said pretzel bites. But was strange since we said we don't eat cheese and the pizza bites have cheese all over them.. Easy mistake? The kitchen was about to close so we said forget it. But she insisted and said it was fine so we said ok. They finally came out and they were closing so we got the bill. I then asked if the pizza bites and pretzel bites were the same price and they informed us they were after much discussion... And we asked if they were sure and they said yes(we didn't see the menu again, they had been picked up) and so my friend asked to speak to a manager just to inform him of the issue. We weren't trying to get anything for free. Should we have paid for them, no. Were we going to, yes. The manager Aman came over asked asked 'what our problem was'. We explained and then He then was very condescending and asked us why it was a problem was since ""we ate them all"" . Of course we ate them. We ordered them and there was nothing wrong with them. We just waited an hour. My friend then was just telling him that he should've just checked on the situation and maybe ran the refired item in question and he seemed very unaware of what had been going on in the bar area and with his guests.. We hadn't seen him touching base with any customers all night. He then thrust the receipt at us and said he ""WAS going to take care of it..But now we can just pay"" and stormed away. I have never been so spoken down to in such a condescending way by a 'manager' in my entire life.  If this was a restaurant on the strip he would NEVER have spoken to us that way. Whether we had 1 drink or 11 there was no reason for him to be that rude. I know that if we had a man with us he never would have spoken to us in such a manner. His body language/attitude and management skills are severely lacking. A manager should be leading by example. Which is extremely upsetting. Its sad that a ""fun"" place such as D&B would EVER employ such an individual. Get it together. I'm not a huge negative yelper but this was completely unacceptable, and a way in which guests should never be treated and everyone should be aware.",D1fvpPcMBmx7CbJjyHYpow,0,0,1,eIVUBGSMrb9B5MG7nhex5w

The entrees were delivered before the appetizer and when our friend commented on it, the waitress told him to ""just calm down"" because it would be here soon. My boyfriend's burger was well done, my plate was incredibly hot but my food was luke warm at best and had no taste. The sauce, shrimp and even the steak tasted like absolutely nothing. I couldn't even eat it because we didn't receive our silverware until the manager came over and by then the food was cold.
He came over and we sent the burger back and when it was delivered again it was still well done. He decided against a third attempt. The manager, Chris A., was very understanding and took care of us for the rest of the experience.",kMjOe-iVoydNNTFm9VylSQ,1,0,2,HUHhhYpd-Xrkc0kUm4ZVkA

The staff and management turnover since they opened is horrendous. 
I only recognize one person from when they opened. And he is a busboy who rocks. 
This means very little teamwork or camaraderie at all. With a lack of leadership, also this place is in so much  need of.    
It takes forever to get initial service and even longer for any form of continued service. We had to stack our 8 empty water and beer glasses on the table just to get some service. 
I always sit in the bar area because I am not a gamer and just want to watch the fights with some food and beers. But for some reason the bar is filled with unattended running children. You would think that with a dining room as large as it is that kids would not be allowed in the bar area. 
It's like a fricken Chucky Cheese in there's when it gets busy. 
One manager did comp us two beers because of the dreadful service. Which I appreciate. But it should never had come down to that.

This D&B, all things considered, has not quite lived up to this.

At other arcades (whose names I won't mention...), if we tell management that there is an issue on a machine that could potentially cause injury, they send out a technician to assess the problem. Here, even a request like raising pads on a dance machine-- an easy adjustment that can be done without having to restart said machine, something that would enable players to more easily play without the risk of tripping on the metal-- was met with stiff opposition and excuses left & right. 

I don't know if the management of this Dave & Buster's reads these reviews, but please look after your machines better.
An insanely loyal and surprisingly affluent group of people who are willing to sink money into your machines even on quiet days have waited for this place to open, with expectations other arcades in Las Vegas have set.

4529758,2017-01-21,1,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Let me start by saying that this was by far the worse experience i've had at a Dave and Busters location for dining that is. 

When we arrived i could tell it was really busy. 7pm, Friday night...packed, packed, packed.

It was just my husband, my 3 yr. old daughter and I tonight. We had decided on enjoying dinner first then tackling the games. I got to the podium and there were 3 hostess's present. None of the 3 were friendly, smiling or looked happy to even be there which already gave off a bad impression right off the bat. I asked for a table for 3 and to my surprise we were sat right away. No wait! Score! She placed our menus down and walked away no ""Your server yadda yadda will be right with you"" no ""How's everyone doing tonight?"" You know, no small talk whatsoever... thumbs down

We sat at our table for about 3-4 minutes before the server stopped and greeted us.thumbs down  (In the restaurant business that is unacceptable, you should be greeting your table within  60 seconds or less. I know because i've been serving for more than 10 years in various restaurants ) she finally stops by after the 3-4 minutes of sitting there and says ""i'll be right with you"" im thinking at this point i would've at least got the drinks in or at least some water. But thats just me. Thumbs down

She lets another 2 minutes go by and comes to ask if we're ready to order. No small talk from her either, no suggestions from the menu, didnt ask if we had eaten there before, if we were first timers. These are the kind of things you wanna conversate with your guests to get that tip average up!  thumbs down

At this point my 3 year is already hungry so i put in her kids meal (does not come with a drink, it's an extra cost) and order my husband and I some water because we are still deciding on what to eat.

For people who dine here often the menu is very vast, alot to choose from so it takes a minute to go over it. We havent dined in awhile so we were checking out the new items, drinks, etc. Now we are ready to order within in that time period that she brings the waters, its been almost 10 minutes! 10 minutes! I was irritated at this point. I finally got up and walked over to another server who was at the machine and said if she could get our server because we were wanting to order. She comes out 2 minutes later. It took us an entire close to 20 minutes to get drinks and our dinner order in. Ridiculous! We are starving at this point.

A food runner brings my daughters food out and i noticed there was ranch, i asked if they had different options which i then asked for honey mustard, he said he would be back but never came. 

Our food took another 15 minutes to come out and she took 2 minutes to come over to make sure that our food was correct or cooked appropriately. Which my burger was wrong i asked for onion rings instead of fries. Im already hungry at this point but wanted to eat already, instead she leave the fries in the mean time she takes it off my plate while she gets the rings which took another 2 minutes. I'm beyond frustrated. We hurry and eat so we can play games. She didnt ask if we wanted to load our cards or anything. I'm sure that helps with the sales.

All in all its pretty large with lots of variety of games and the food was tasty. Service and the employees is what sucked. I hope they work on it. For it being a really busy location with it being the only one in Vegas, they better step there game up. 2 thumbs down overall for dining experience",A0UtIwTkkH2GHcVePPBgtQ,7,1,2,iVpCxIxCX-vV0mv8F5HLrw

Drink wise this place rocks. They have happy hour 4-7 with half off all cocktails and bud lights for $2. I tried the watermelon margarita and mango margarita. I liked the styling and playfulness of the watermelon one, but the mango tasted much better in my opinion. Can't beat the prices of around $5 per drink though.

Now for food, my bae and I decided to share the sliders and wings app. I honestly was not impressed at all with this. The wings tasted frozen and the sliders were pretty bland. Definitely a disappointment.

Where else in the Summerlin area can you shop, eat, drink, watch sports and have the kids play games? If you think it's expensive, go to Disneyland. If you want to drink yourself into a coma, go to a bar. 

Every time we come here, they greet us with a smile and open the door for us. JD walked us through the place and created our Power Card. He told us about promotions and specials. Employees like JD are the reason why this place will succeed. 

We went to eat and Marco was our server. He was professional and attentive. The food is good and the ambience is great. It's also very clean.

4666137,2016-08-11,6,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"First and foremost, I absolutely love Dave & Busters for its wide selection of games! However, what's truly lacking in this fairly new establishment is the lack of quality customer service. I understand that it's only been open since Monday, but for the sake of this franchise, I hope that this particular location will learn how to adapt and treat customers as they want to be treated in the near future. 

This 2 star review is specifically targeted to the dine in restaurant located within the establishment. 

At 9:15pm (Wednesday 8/10/16) my group had put our name down and was quoted 30 minutes to be seated. Although this seemed to good to be true, we took the hostess' word for it, only to not be seated for another hour later. Our server ""Daisy"" took care of our party smoothly for the most part, but we were turned off by the offensive remark that she had made regarding 3 of my Asian friends at the table. When returning our IDs to the table, she had stated that she couldn't tell the difference between them even though these 3 individuals remotely do not look the same at all! 

The treatment that we had received towards the end of our meal and closing takes the cake. A tall gentleman who we had never seen before in a headset approaches us and I quote tells us, ""Hey everyone, I know you're having a good time and all, but we need you all to leave because we are closing."" When the gentleman approached us, we were still waiting on our credit cards and finishing up the rest of our drinks. Excuse me? This isn't common courtesy at all... This is not how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant. 

Thanks Dave & Busters for the games, but please learn to get it together at the restaurant part and learn how to treat customers nicely and with respect.",kOru06ovLoQdwHYIYoL_mg,9,2,2,TWlC3KZCn_9bBYz929ouAg

First of all - their happy hour is phenomenal! Like where else can you drink Jameson for $3 a shot?! (Yes, I'm serious). I've been to other D&Bs and Gameworks and I have always gotten great service at this one, especially in comparison to others. 

Bartenders and servers are great. Sometimes the service bar can take a minute, but as a previous bartender, I also know what it's like to be in their shoes and they do pretty damn well for how busy they can get. They are always really cool and do cater to their customers. 

I like coming here with my friends, coworkers, and just have a good time. They keep it pretty clean, the food is good for bar food and is pretty competitive with like a BWW. 

Yes, there's a ton of kids but also a lot of adult fun. There aren't a ridiculous amount of games but there are a lot.

Long enough to figure out whether the guns worked. Plus we saw other patrons with iced water and we asked another bartender if the guns wer broken and he no.

Second time was to watch a basketball game and it was perfect because the bar area was not crowded at all, plenty of TVs to watch the game and the bartenders were great. Their personalities and fast attentive service deserved 5 stars. I would possibly come back to watch another game in the future.

The third time, we had dinner and wanted to stay and play some games after. The food was horrible and that's all I have to say about that. So much that we didn't even stay to play games afterwards because I was so disappointed with the food that it ruined my mood and I just wanted to go home.

So Friday comes and we eventually make our way for the celebration to begin. We arrived around 4:55pm and it was already crowded. We were all hungry so we wanted to sit and eat first and then we would eventually play games. Well the wait time was about 35 to 55 minutes so we all decided to go to a close restaurant to get some drinks. Well I needed to sneak away to see if they could possibly keep a cake I had ordered for the birthday girl in their fridge along with seeing how long we had left. I was able to meet one of the managers Sean who took the cake for me until we wanted it brought out. Once we got seated our bubbly waitress Breanna came by and welcomed us and took our drink orders along with wishing the birthday girl a Happy Birthday. The appetizer we ordered was the loaded tater tots and it was pretty good. All 3 of us ordered the Sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped shrimp and creamed corn which we enjoyed. The ONLY thing we agreed on was the bacon wrapped shrimp was very salty (and was way too much fat on the bacon). When we were ready for the cake to come out, let's just say the birthday girl was definitely surprised. Even another waitress ran to get candles and a lighter so the birthday girl could make her wish. The games were great although it was crowded so it was hard to get to play some of the most popular games. Overall the staff was very friendly and it meant a lot to the birthday girl for having the GM Phil stopping by to say Happy Birthday.

The biggest difference I've noticed is how new this space is. It opened up in August of 2016 so everything is super clean and it really is fun to go to while in Downtown Summerlin. 

Service is mediocre as many of the people seem like they don't enjoy their job and it kinda kills the fun vibe.

Every time I come here it's pretty crowded. I usually come during the evening time between 9-2. The wait time for each game is not that bad. Plenty of games to enjoy such as basketball, shooting and racing games.

Happy hour time most days are 9-closing so alcohol and playing arcade games makes it a lot more fun. Plenty of television screens around the bar area to watch plenty of sports. Right now this is the best place if you are trying to watch the Olympics.

Prices for the games were not that bad. The super charge comes in clutch for an extra few dollars. I bought the best value one which is like $50 something and I've been here a lot already and still have enough points to keep going.

The two times I visited, the wait time was just horrible but my most recent experience had to be the worst I've ever experienced in my whole life.

This past Sunday when I went, a girl that served us took forever and I believe her name is Joanna. It took thirty minutes for her to bring out our first round of drinks(which was one beer tower). Throughout the whole time of her serving she had an unwelcoming vibe and attitude. And after much frustration, we closed our tab out with her and caught her trying to do us dirty. When she handed back our change, our receipt was no longer there with the incorrect change. So then we ask her for an itemized receipt to double check everything and what do you know, there was more change added to it and she claimed that she did the math incorrectly(Way to try and tip yourself).

I get it, you're frustrated and you think people are going to cut you short on tip but that's never okay. My friends around me were so fired up that they rambled on about how they didn't want to leave a tip... but I couldn't do it. At the end of the night I pulled her aside and tipped her an extra $20 and told her why we were frustrated and I hope she learns from this experience. I almost regret it because even after me trying to be understanding of her actions, she still tried to blame everything on the kitchen and the bar...Regardless of whether or not this is your first serving job, it still isn't okay to treat people like crap and this is coming from a fellow first time server herself.

One of my friends got a sangria which was awesome -- and I'm not a fan of tequila. Everyone said their food was delicious as well. The portions are good for the price you pay. 

As for the games, there are TONS to choose from. They can get expensive fast, but this is typical nowadays. We spent about $25 each and got to play most of the games we wanted to. As usual, the rewards leave much to be desired, but that's not the reason you come to D&B's, is it?

Because we never really ordered food here (especially because there were specials on the menu if you order a dish with $20 play), the bartender helped us order and answered any questions we had.

Horrible service, 45 minutes for onion rings really. It's not like the place is pack it's empty. They need to get their shit together if the want to stay a business.

They are super busy and there is a lot of people inside!! How can they seat everyone at the same time, they cant make people eat/drink fast just so you can be seated sooner! Anyways, my husband and I went to D&B yesterday afternoon. It was packed with people! We knew it would be busy given the fact that they just opened not too long ago. Before starting to play some of the games, we decided to get the buzzer for the eating area because they looked busy! The wait was 15-30 minutes to be seated. The game selection was great and we did not really have to wait long for any of the games. After playing for about 20 minutes our buzzer turned on, we went to be seated. Our waitress was accommodating, there was a lot of waiters/waitresses, more than we were used to. It took awhile for our appetizer to come out, we ordered the nachos, they were very good!! Soon after our meal was ready. I had the linguine pasta with shrimp and steak over lobster Alfredo sauce, it was delicious!!!

5279926,2016-08-14,6,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Recently opened in Downtown Summerlin and already making a splash with locals looking to escape the summer heat, I was a bit of a surprised that Dave & Buster's had not already made its mark on Las Vegas considering the fact that I'd previously visited locations in Detroit and Columbus as far back as the mid-90's, dining never really the ""focal point"" but the arcade a lot of fun and the televisions plentiful for watching college football games.

Originally founded in the early 1980s, and now nearing their 90th store Nationwide, Dave & Buster's at Downtown Summerlin inhabits the space directly across from Regal Cinemas and featuring a vast floorplan of Food, Games and Sports it was just prior to 6pm that our party checked-in at the podium, reservations well-advised during primetime hours, though any wait-time could easily be spent on the video games.

Seated at a sturdy four-top to the right of the bar, a ton of Televisions positioning Dave & Buster's nicely as *the* place to watch Football, Big Events or UFC in the nearly two-year old shopping center, it was with surprisingly efficient service for a place so new that the evening got started, plenty of managers circulating with the use of headsets allowing the team to fill coverage gaps as small groups continued to file in just as two sizable birthday parties sequentially got situated.

Energetic but not exactly ""loud"" considering the concept, a bulk of the noise merely that of pop-music and conversation as the gaming area sits a fair distance from the food and drink, positive attitudes and smiles seem to be part of the culture at Dave & Buster's and although the several-page menu may at first seem daunting, the size is mostly a result of pictures with server's recommendations helping to narrow the options into a list that is both well-culled and fair priced.

Obviously not to be confused as fine dining, but at least on par with the rest of the outdoor mall in terms of quality and mass-appeal, the order at Dave & Buster's was intended to take a broad look at some of their classics as well as the new Summertime selections, a trio of adult-beverages to start certainly not the Spirit-forward work of a Strip ""Mixologist,"" but at the same time still quite tasty with both the Snow Cone and Tiki drink both the sort of thing that could get lightweights into trouble as the alcohol is well hidden by all the fruit and sweeter stuff.

Continuing to order in threes, a Children's menu affording the ability to taste D&B's famous ""Golden Planks"" in a smaller portion with results par-for-the-course Chicken Strips served with addictive Chipotle Honey Sauce, more interesting bites were found in Grilled Cheese Sticks that saw Manchego put to good use alongside more typical Cheddar and Mozzarella in a golden, crunchy package featuring a gooey center, the Steak n' Cheese Tater Cakes even more impressive as the Hashbrown base was virtually oilless beneath nicely seasoned Beef, Onions and more melted Cheese.

Told that the Burgers were a ""must,"" but also intrigued by Sandwiches as well as some of the Seafood and Chicken choices, suffice it to say that the Maker's Mark BBQ Burger outperforms anything tasted at nearby Shake Shack or Ribs n' Burgers in terms of taste or quality, the 8oz patty grilled perfect medium beneath House-pulled Pork and caramelized Onions, while a delicious half-pound of line-caught Cod fried golden showed an unexpected dedication to sustainable souring, the Short Rib & Cheesy Mac Stack unfortunately falling short of the rest as a result of significant underseasoning.

Not holding back when it comes to desserts, though those dining with small children should be weary that a three-course meal in the middle of a room of flashing lights and temptation will test the patience of even the best behaved boy or girl, there is no doubt a reason that Dave & Buster's Brookie Sundae Tower is featured at the top of the list as three of America's favorite sweets are brought together in a stack of pure decadence, the tender Donut Holes a much lighter way to finish the meal on a sweet note while the Bananas Foster Pie offers a more adult option in a portion better suited for singles.

Taking about an hour to play games after dinner, the range of options each charged a somewhat arbitrary range of ""points"" per play, both adults and children will be challenged by everything from Skee-Ball and Air Hockey to shoot 'em up style games as well as those for which they can win tickets, all-in-all a great way to shake down the food and let the little ones expend some energy at the end of the day.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,11,4,30_yU6ryaTSDP7rBQCDtCg

The bad: why does this location allow children in the bar area. 
The ugly: tv's, sporting games and alcohol (well that's the positive) children hearing the profanities. Not me of course- I plead the fifth. Well, perhaps during certain sporting events being televised. Not my problem.

Today I went to D&B to watch some football with my family and was very disappointed in the service that I was provided. We got there around 1:00 to sit down and accordingly with it being the first Sunday of football we had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. Once seated we were greeted by our waiter Danny and he took our order everything seemed as if it were going to go well. We ordered 2 orders of the unlimited wings and an order of Nachos I ordered the wings that were suppose to be BBQ and my fiancé friend ordered buffalo wings. We sat there for about 45 mins before anything came out food wise. Our waiter told us the Kitchen was backed up so the order was taking longer than usual. When the food that did come out came it was wrong and the server that brought it out got a little attitude when I told him that. They brought out 2 orders of Buffalo wings when I ordered the BBQ. At this time the Nachos still did not come out. 10 mins later my waiter came by asked me if my food was okay and I told him what happened. 20 more mins later my wings came out correctly but still no Nachos. Our waiter Danny walked passed about 3 times not addressing us so we finally stopped him and asked about the Nachos he said ""Let me go check"" and never came back. 20 more minutes passed and my fiancé Nachos still did not come but the person seated next to us that ordered after us received their Nachos. Once again we asked the waiter about our food and he said let me go check on it. 10 more mins passed and they finally came out which would be 1hour 30mins after we ordered them. By this time the rest of our group showed up. They sat there for about 15 mins before any waiter asked them what they would like. So we ordered with an entirely different waiter. At this time we also ordered a refill on our wings. My cousin who joined us ordered an order of regular wings and fries for herself and her daughter not the unlimited. Their orders came out about 20 mins later but we're cold like it had been sitting on a table not even under a heat lamp so they sent them back. They brought out another order of wings but it was an order of refill wings not their original order so at this time we asked to speak with a manager the Manager came in (a white dude with a red beard and bald head) and was slightly rude and told us that we had an attitude and that we should just eat the food and he would bring more out which I find very rude as a customer. Then after that the general manager Phil came out he told us that we allegedly threatened his staff and that we had to leave. I will NEVER eat at this D&B again they have poor service and their staff members are rude and unprofessional so many of them rolled their eyes and gave attitude when we asked them to correct their coworkers mistakes. I really hope that they turn things around because it sucks that one of my favourite places to go eat and drink was such a horrible experience.

The food was not good at all. Everyone was very disappointed with the quality of the food. Not to mention with the amount of money we paid we could have just order from the regular dinning menu and saved a ton. 
*Baked Spinach Dip was served but not chips (we had to ask) 
*Honey Glazed Baby Carrots - not good, no one touched it
*Boneless wings (we added on) was dry and super hard
*Vegan Penne Pasta - No flavor at all 
*Grilled Shrimp Skewers - VERY DRY and had no flavor at all
*Lemon-Grilled Chicken - tasted like rubber 
*Chef Carved Roast Beef Au Jus - (sound so delicious) If you got the one on the top, it was dry and if you got the one at the bottom was very salty. 
*Mini Cheesecakes and Chocolate Éclairs - was semi frozen & don't recall getting any Éclairs. 

Everyone did enjoy
*Salad station, Dinner Rolls, Sweet and Spicy Meatballs & roasted potatoes  
I was there on time to taste the food. A couple of people were late and it being in those warmers, made the food dry up vs keeping it warm. 

The server was great!!! She did an amazing job!!! Was very on top of everything. One of our co-worker did complain about the food and the manager offered her to order anything on the menu and he will take care of it but she didn't want to order anything because she knew everyone else at the event would have done the same.

This was everyone's first time at this new Dave & Buster's in Las Vegas. It was very small compare to the ones we've held events at in California. A lot of ticket games and not enough video games. The unlimited card was not very useful. 

OVER ALL
We spent $1,203.78 for 13 people.  So about $92.59 per person. This was not worth what we spent. Not to mention we paid $75 for them to black an area off in their restaurant. We went on a Thursday night and it was dead. You are better off planning an event and having everyone order their own food and drinks.

The place was understaffed as stated by wait staff that they had seen we were not being tended to. The management team needs better training. They seem a bit unprepared to deal with conflict. Very unseasoned. Not their fault at all. There is always a guy at the top who needs to train them better. 

The food was very good. The serving staff was good. Albeit the manager did the best she could under the circumstances. If it was my joint. Get people in and served quickly so they have time to enjoy the gaming experience also. What should have been a 30 or 40 minute dining experience turned in to 1 and a half almost 2 hour dining experience.

However,  we sat in the bar and had a server named Mario. He greeted the table after 5-10 minutes of waiting around, didn't get our drink orders until about 5-10 mins after that. During the course of the entire meal, never once did our server look us in the eyes,  explain any specials, say hapy birthday to my boyfriend when I mentioned we were here celebrating his birthday with you guys, and or checked on us. We ordered a burger with fries and ranch and a side salad with ranch. The side salad was not fresh (brown soggy lettus, the tomatoes were mushy, and the mozz cheese on a side garden salad was gross and not complimentary to the plate.). My boyfriend ordered a burger Medium well and it came out medium rare. Food came out decently quickly by a food runner.  Server practically ignored our table the entire time. Never checked to seeif the salad or burger was okay,  never offered us refills. Once the drinks are half full, if its free refills bring a refill without asking. Once food hits the table wait 2-3 minutes and check on table. Finally, the server came over to drop off the check, not even make sure we were kay after 20-30 minutes. Anyways, the food was horrible. I went and got a manager involved and he was nice and took off the salad and the dessert we had ordered. Our server, Mario was horrible, rude, and needs to be retrained.

First off, it took nearly an hour to get a table but we were okay with that since we decided to play first. It then took a while to get our drinks, we were okay with that too because once again, it was busy. Here's where it went downhill fast, we weren't given straws for the drinks. It was a problem considering the kids cups have lids on them. We flag someone down to get us straws and he brings one... I explained that the whole table needed straws thinking my bad that I may have not made that known. Yeah, he literally brought another single straw. Our family giggled because it was a little mind boggling but whatever. Food came in at a decent time but we didn't have any silverware and our waitress was standing talking to another table...for at least 15 minutes. The manager in the mean time was bussing the table next to us. Like where are the bussers? We let the server know that we didn't have any silverware and we asked for some ketchup and ranch. He then made the comment of oh wow you guys don't have anything on your table! Well yeah that's why we asked you. We sat there waiting to eat because we needed forks and at this point we just asked the manager who was still cleaning the table next to us. He brought out the silverware and everything else we needed including refills because once again waitress was mia. The server then comes back with the silverware a little too late because the manager had already done it. We ate the food, which wasn't bad but we never actually received the ranch that was asked for numerous times. We had to once again flag someone down for more refills since the waitress decided again to hang out at the other table and guess who brought the refills....the manager. We let the manager know that hey she hasn't really done anything and has been standing at the other table for a while now. I honestly felt bad for the manager because he was working his tail off and his staff is useless. The waitress did make it back one more time to say sorry, is there anything else and here's the check. Food was okay, service was absolutely terrible.

We were unaware of the fights that night and we planned a birthday party for about 30 guests in hopes that we arrived an hour early and they would accommodate us. Absolutely they did even with it being fight night! We were originally told an hour and a half but they just do happen to have a big group of tables open up at the same time and they were going to give us that area and even held it for us until most of our guests arrived. Totally not what I was expecting that's for sure. They were so wonderful and so accommodating, the food was delicious as always. 

We understood why they were charging for the fight as its very open concept and anywhere you go in there you can see a tv so how are they supposed to accommodate people who are only there for ""games and a bite.""  Besides that you got the money back on a game card that played the arcade games you just couldn't win any tickets with the cards. Believe me when I say when that fight was on, the entire place stood still watching it so of course they were charging to get in. They pay a lot of money to show those fights and they have to get something in return. It's a business for Christ's sake. Yes it's loud but it's an ARCADE/SPORTS BAR!

We finally got up and found someone to help. 

Skyler came over and made sure that we had everything we needed from there on in. He was super-friendly and apologetic for the first impression and we appreciated that he didn't just hand over the responsibility to someone else. He even bussed the table for us and followed up regularly to make sure we were doing okay. The extra effort and attentiveness really made all the difference in the world.

There's no way I'd eat at this location as it shares the same floor with all of the games. The games are crowded together on a smaller footprint than other D&Bs I've been to, making for a cramped experience. It's basically chaos.

What irks me the most is the no outside water bottles policy. I came in about half an hour after they opened to grab Brian to go to lunch after I got done with a class at Sephora. I had a water bottle that was half full and I was stopped and told I couldn't come in. Why? As if I'm sneaking vodka in?

The food is a bit pricy and their happy hour isn't really that good.  Their beer is $7 and for happy hour, it's $6.  Not much of a happy hour.  However,  we did enjoy the food and it was made to our liking. 

We left the bar area and decided to play some games. It was both of our first time and we each got $25 worth of gameplay.  That  $25 lasted us 2 hours! We had a lot of fun playing the games.

They've purchased UFC fight and are charging everyone a minimum to enter -  regardless whether you're watching or not... $10/each

I'm not here for the fight but they tell me not to worry cause we'll give credits to play games at the same value - im thinking that's fine - was gonna play games anyway, why not.

Learned real quick you can use these credits for only maybe 5 of the games offered??

I tried to talk to manager about it - not there for the fight but games and dinner - it's Dave & Busters not Sapphire!

I was told he can't help. Period.

- Can't play games I want with that card
- Can't issue refund cause I played one game already - mind you, I didn't even ask for a refund.
- Can't apply money to another card that can be used for other games - even if I add another $50 to the ""right"" card.

Why not? What's the difference what games I play - I gave you the cash?



Apparently it's not the minimum to play games, It's COVER for the UFC fight! NOT WATCHING UFC - Who cares! You're paying the cover.

What a SCAM!!!

I had to  ask the server what  drinks I was able to  order that  would be the half price for happy hour. She basically told me that  it was all of them except the ones with the souvenir cups, Sweet!  I waited a while for my  friends and then wanted to  order food. Again, I would have to  ask. I felt awkward doing this again , so  i just assumed that  it was all of the appetizers except the platters (thats how it  is most places). I ordered buffalo wings and nachos. My  friends get  there and they  ask her to point out which appetizers are the  happy hour ones and to my surprise she only names 3 of the  like 8 or so and none were the ones that  I ordered. Go figure... I only  recall 2 of the 3 happy  hour apps and that  was the quesadilla and the boneless buffalo wings. 

The food was good and the drinks during this time were a steal. I paid about $9 for my  two  cocktails. Winning! The food I paid a lot more.

It was about 12 so lunch time. Fairly empty with plenty of staff. By no means slow but not busy either. We sat in a booth by the bar. We ordered our drinks and took a look at the menu. Ok it was pricey, but hey if it's good who cares. Kid 1 got Mac and cheeses, it was zero special, infant it was straight up kraft out of the box. Which could have been ok but of course it was mass produced back in the kitchen and stored to be reheated when a little freckle walked in an ordered it. Kid 2 who we will for the record will say would eat the gum off the bottom of the table and not complain ordered the chicken fingers. He took a bite and then another and said these are NO GOOD. 2 words I have never heard come from his mouth when eating. Of course I was worried and tried them. He was right NO GOOD. Cooked multiple times or stored under a heat lamp they were dry and rubbery. Like a fried piece  of elastic. I ordered the Mac and cheese and possibly pot roast sandwich. It was beautifully displayed. The meat was well done and dry, not quite as over cooked as the chicken from above but non the less it reminded me of silly putty. I drowned it in good old hienz 57 and got it down. The tater tots? They were Excellent. As a matter of fact we all enjoyed them, including the 7 month old who we didn't include in this post. The wait staff was a whole other situation. Very fake but at least pretended to care. You could tell they were aware a lot of people were unhappy and had zero control over the situation. They ( about 6 or7) hung out by the bar and laughed and joked. I can only think they were laughing at us for being there. The bill for the food 44.00 I left a few bucks for a tip only because I was obligated, I wish I could be one of those people that just walked but I couldn't do it. Again part of me believes it's not there fault anyway. Ok game time. We buy 23.00 worth of tokens. They charge me 2.00 to do so. An initiation I suppose to be a proud owner of a plastic card I have 1000s of from local casinos. I suppose in other states this crap flies as cool in this one at least to me it's more crap laying around I have to deal with it. Anyway. Games were all working. Which is a plus for a place like this. Some were pricey actually most were. But my kids had an hour of fun for 25.00. Not much to complain about in this department. If this was a game room trip I'd give them 2 stars it was not the best I've seen. It was over priced. Too much 1 ball games for tickets. You know the ones that cost the most and last the least amount of time. As if they are giving you good prizes for these tickets. Nope we walked threw just junk. With the 240 or so tickets on the card I left them there instead of wasting my time explaining to my kids that anything worth wolf is 6000 plus tickets. Which you can buy in a store for 10.00 or win here for 1000.00........ maybe. Still I was a kid once and understand the excitement.",fp2KiLfoIO9OIUV2KHkgEA,0,0,1,brlWD3U6FfdHi85jvYa5Ng
5816580,2018-04-11,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"I came here last night with my boyfriend and some friends. I have ever been to Dave and Busters and thought it looked fun. The menu was really nice, there was a lot of selections, I wasn't sure what to get. I ended up getting the spicy Thai chicken and noodles, which was really good. Then we went on to play the games, which we all had a blast. They have a lot of selection of games and a $10 playing card actually gets you pretty far game wise. The  confusing part was the way that the servers have to explain the play cards. You have to do it while ordering, and you super charge cards and it really got confusing. Also, the guy who comes around for a ""free"" picture is kind of awkward and was kind of rude. At first he was nice and then brought our 1/2"" by 1""2 pictures and said he does not get paid and only works on tips. Well we didn't want the tiny picture and none of us had cash, until I realized I did, but it was only $3 and he literally said "" wow that's sad."" Sorry I don't carry cash, but either way that wasn't even necessary to say, and he stayed there for a minute waiting for one of us to say we had cash, when we didn't. Just an awkward situation. Other than that, it was a really good time, and good date night idea or even place for the kids.",8oNbx_xxll_oNUh-x-s16g,0,0,4,EWw7lVpJY-w4QewRsvEBWQ

The only reason I was acknowledge was I get up and said ""let's just go somewhere else."" Then was told by a host who heard me ""it's probably because they're closing this side."" Well, instead you should apologize and offer to have us move to the side that isn't closed. We left. (Mind you the side that was closing had people sitting there. We also purposely say next to seated tables to make service easier and more convenient.)

We were in line to buy the game cards and credits and some untrained worker came up to me and basically said you can't have that water throw it away. We weren't even in the gaming area yet. Waiting in the long ass line where they only had one cashier working. I approached a rude manager and said what if customers have dietary restrictions where they need water? I'm 7 months pregnant and it's starting to get hot outside. That manager didn't give two shits. We were going to eat at the restaurant but even the employees working in that area were miserable. No smiles, no thank you, shit they didn't even greet us. We approached the counter and all they said was what's your phone number? That is not the way to run a business. We left and went to eat somewhere else. I definitely wasn't going to give Dave and busters any of my time or money.. if you want horrible customer service this is the place for you.

5879947,2016-08-15,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,I know they just opened but the entire experience was Terrible. It took 20 minutes just to get a beer and then they limit you to only three drinks. This is Las Vegas if you want limit my alcohol consumption then I will take my money next door where I can drink. Then there's the food all the food was cold and had been sitting for a while. I got the Philly cheesesteak burger and they forgot to put any steak it was just onions and peppers. The fries were cold and soggy and at that point I did not want to wait another 30 minutes for food. The arcade part was cool except I thought it was supposed to be orientated to adults. I was there until midnight and there were more kids 16 and under than anyone else running around like crazy.

I took my family here for my wife's birthday. It was clean, nice decor, most of the games where working, smell nice and pretty good food too. My family got the three combo meal, my son got the shrimp pasta thing and I got the mac and beef. It was all good. Then some ice cream and brownies for the wife's bday.

After my kids went out to play the arcade games with the meals we bought. Games all worked and where clean.

Would I recommend this place to anyone yes I would. Try something on their menu. It is a big kid type of place and not a regular restaurant.",w_ncKCr935xzTD9EkF_2gg,0,0,5,p-TLwZkkIRAXE4SpKOBMWg
5889412,2018-06-09,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,Dave and Busters in Summerlin has been a good place for my lady and me.  Once we went in it surprised me how loud the atmosphere was at night.  It was 60.00 for i believe 365 credits to use on the arcade games.  If you are military or a veteran you will save 20% off they just need to see your Cac card or military id or veterans affairs card.  All of the arcades were working perfectly at the time of visit.  The prizes with tickets seems more obtainable than other arcades in town.  It is mostly a 21 year and older and are welcomed to bring your alcoholic drinks while you play.  For sure we will be back again.,DsVnd4PH2nkbxo8UeGW3Mw,0,0,5,FgN2tHreVIqTrB2qdosGFw

We enjoy going here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend and I always enjoy sitting at the bar cause there is always some sport on tv to enjoy and people watching is always fun. The bartenders are all very friendly and attentive. We typically order a beer and share the bar burgers and wings platter which is more than enough for the two of us. The food is usually pretty good, although sometimes does not come out as hot as you may hope.  

Great place to stop in for a super low key cocktail/beer and snack.... ANS always a great place to bring kiddos (if you have them) to get out some energy!

Have fun!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,2,0,3,GXSuGCgOxBOsRv12ZNKCPQ
5912046,2016-08-11,5,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"One star...half a star for my first visit and another half for my second (the following day).

We came on the second day of opening only to be excited for the games and happy hour. It was 9pm on a Tuesday, and of course we expected it to be busy. The lines were long to get a power card, but luckily I had one from a California D&B so we skipped the long lines and *tip* went to the self serve kiosks in the back (super fast service since its do it yourself). The D&Bs have a rep for spotty customer service, but you would think they'd try to improve that with their newly trained employees at a brand new location. WRONG!

The bar was crazy packed and it took forever to get drinks (but they're cheap, 50% off all drinks except for the specialty tea) so I guess it's a win-lose situation. Sean was our bartender and he was pretty awesome. 3 drinks = $14. We played some games throughout the night and got seated right away at 11pm. Our server was nice but told us there was no happy hour on food...when clearly there were signs everywhere stating that select appetizers were 50% off. She didn't refill our waters and barely checked up on us. After the mediocre customer service, the only thing that could save the night was crossy road and piano tiles!!!!!!!!

We knew that Wednesday's were half off all games so we decided to come the next night. This time coming with a larger group of people. Apparently at that point (around 8:30pm) the wait time was 2-3 hours to eat, and the bar was horrific. We stood at the front of the bar since 9pm and didn't get drinks ordered until 9:30pm. (That's how crazy packed it was) and didn't actually receive them until 10pm... Losing quality game time. However, it's understandable because we ordered 10+ drinks. It was only about $50. So worth it!!! Alfred was our bartender and he was pretty great. Tough sport, man! At 9:15pm we decided to just put our name down on the list we got quoted 30 minutes for a party of 12. We were shocked but decided okay, that's not 2-3 hours so why not. As the night went on, we enjoyed playing games but were starting to get hungry. Our pager hadn't gone off and by 10:45pm we finally go seated........hosts need to not under quote large parties. Obviously we were expecting to get seated. 

Our server checked our IDs and didn't believe some of them because some were still vertical (not everyone renews their IDs). I know it's a protocol, but when you don't check one that's vertical yet you check the other 3............ Anyway, from that point on we ordered more drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our food came out fairly quickly, but our service was lacking. She stated that we ""all looked the same"" (because we're Asian). And just said weird things servers shouldn't say to customers. As attentive as she was, she wasn't really helpful. We ordered the chocolate fondue dessert and the candle wasn't LIT, therefore the dessert was not LIT/chocolate wasn't heated. The appetizers were 3/5 and the last call for drinks just tasted like they just threw a bunch of alcohol in a cup and they were definitely disgusting. We had yet to receive our bill and we were approached and asked to leave by some other guy who wasn't our server. It was midnight. And we had a bunch of beer left in our beer tower and didn't even get our bills yet. If this is how you treat paying customers who are trying to enjoy your restaurant, then you're definitely going to lose brownie points. 

Overall, I wanted to be excited, and I still am for the future, but if they don't change then the only good thing they have going for them is the plethora of games and happy hour drink prices. I know they've only been open for three days and are working out the kinks, but isn't it the time they're supposed to be at the peak of customer service? 

They're lucky they only have one competitor that can't really be compared to them.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,21,3,1,J4bQDfo5J_eYidzyvEEatQ
5936104,2016-08-26,0,BSDKbSLFO3CP-uhfcuUCkA,"Checked this place out for nieces going away party. The food was horrible. Pretty much cafeteria food but pricey. Not one dish stood out as good. Cold tators, soggy fries, no cocktail sauce with shrimp, no tarter sauce with fish. Meat on hamburgers tasted of the lowest possible quality. The staff was mostly obnoxious. Server started to be nice half way through the meal, but the food runner basically shoved random plates at me and said ""I don't know where they go, I'm just dropping them off"". Almost felt like we were at Dicks last resort. 
 
Wouldn't ever come here for the food. Only two stars for the games. They had a lot and all in good working order.
