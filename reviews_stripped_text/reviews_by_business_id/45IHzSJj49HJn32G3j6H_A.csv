I ate at this location once when I was in high school, before I became very health-conscious, and it was a very memorable experience because it was so unpleasant.  I can't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the hot dogs with onion and peppers on it, which I remember were overly greasy, soggy and limp.  It looked like gelatinous mush.  There was no pride or integrity in the way it was put together.  I don't know how to describe the taste exactly, but I clearly remember that it didn't taste natural or right.  It tasted unnatural and wrong, like is was tainted in some way.  For some reason -- I guess i was hungry and didn't want to waste my money -- I ate the whole hotdog.  I remember feeling queasy afterwards, like my stomach had been insulted and abused.  That was the day I made a personal vow never to eat at Wienerschnitzel again, and I am reaffirming that vow today.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,1,1,1,ojO2uy_RWtM_1XfaAH0fUw

this time it was late & everything was old & bad

even for $6 it was not a good deal

you would be better off going to 7-11 and taking your chances at any old gas station",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,0,1,1,ItWE4BD6xDSyGKp0ODrLeQ
