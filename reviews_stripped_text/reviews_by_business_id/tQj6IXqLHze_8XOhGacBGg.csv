The only reason for my 3 star review is because the food took about 30 minutes to make, when we were the only customers there, and it was a simple sandwich.  Killed a majority of my lunch hour waiting for a sandwich...

I guess this place is more for people who have a lot of time to kill or aren't that hungry yet.. Unfortunately, I fit neither of these criteria.",8_QdwNZIhWmOWKJS5ENGFw,0,0,3,CgTebsDFKqqnPnCLSgWmVQ

Most of the guest are not vegan, but the cake was devoured faster than I've ever seen a conventional cake eaten. I had dropped the ball and was freaking out for not placing my order ahead of time. The staff was super nice and were able to save the day by making me a last minute birthday cake, which was delicious to boot!

Everything has been delicious! The stereotype of vegan baked goods is that they can be dry, too oily, and/or too sugary. Lidet Cafe's vegan treats are none of those. I love that they are the perfect amount of sweet, not oily, and not dry. 

I am so glad that I picked Lidet Cafe to make a vegan pineapple upside down cake for a birthday party. Mostly non-vegan friends were at the party, and everyone loved the cake especially the birthday boy. Thank you so much Lidet Cafe!

My first experience with this Cafe was when a friend of mines brought me a piece of their neapolitan puff pasty and oh my God it was thee best puff pastry I've had in a very long time. 

It was extremely fresh and you can tell that it was made that same day and in their own kitchen (not outsourced but made in-house) because the quality was just amazing. Everything from the owners personal customer service skills, the atmosphere and location of the Cafe, to the quality of their products is something you would appreciate and enjoy with your entire family.

2927380,2017-10-15,1,tQj6IXqLHze_8XOhGacBGg,"I found Lidet Cafe on Yelp while searching for a vegan cake for my son's 2nd birthday. I ordered the cake on Thursday to pick up on Saturday for the birthday dinner. I really didn't know what to expect since I've never ordered a vegan cake before. I was just hoping it wouldn't be dry and it wouldn't be obviously vegan since everyone else in my family eats animal products.

I picked up the cake at 6pm on Saturday and I was so happy with the way it looked. The design exceeded my expectations. It was all blue with polka dots and a dinosaur train toy on top. I didn't think they'd be able to put a toy on it and decorate it that way with such short notice. I was just expecting something basic and they gave me an amazing design for my son's bday.

As far as the taste, it was AMAZING. Everyone loved the cake. No one could believe it was vegan. It was so moist and delicious. My aunt kept saying, ""wow, they used real strawberries for the cream and filling too."" It was a hit and I'm so happy I ordered my cake from Lidet.

I tried the desserts the Tiramisu and the Napolean are made with organic ingredients and they were Vegan. My experience with Vegan dessert is a hit or miss, but I was pleased that these were amazing. 
I made another visit to try the lunch items from the menu. If you don't mind waiting a little bit for your sandwich, you will be rewarded it was delicious, very well prepared and you can taste every part of the sandwich. 

The cafe has a warm-hearted feeling, you just want to come in and relax take the stress off from daily life.

Let me start off by saying my little girl who is now two is allergic to almost everything! She's allergic to wheat, nuts, eggs, fish, oats, tapioca starch, strawberries, cherries, all berries, mangoes, soybeans, etc.. I swear the list goes on! My sister in law, who lives in Las Vegas found this bakery, and ordered a birthday cake for my daughter, while we were down there visiting from California. At first when she told me she gave the list to them and asked them to do a cake for my little girl I was so apprehensive! I was really scared because my daughter previously ended up in the hospital twice for an allergic reaction, once to strawberries and the other time to a cake that another baker made with that exact same list! Lidet and her husband took such good care in making the cake, making sure there was no cross contamination's and making sure all the ingredients were organic and made from facilities that didn't cross contaminate as well. They took our request to make the cake with rice flour and for anyone whose worked with it knows that it's very grainy and dry, but they were able to make a delicious cake. My little girl loved it and she wasn't allergic! I loved eating the cake as well! It was a chocolate cake with orange & chocolate whipped cream! I couldn't be happier!! It's hard when you see other kids eating all these desserts and your child can't eat anything. Thank you so much Lidet for making my little girl and I so happy!

5279864,2018-04-10,6,tQj6IXqLHze_8XOhGacBGg,"Located on West Flamingo for over a year it was finally on Saturday that a reason arose to visit Lidet Café & Bakery, the signage signifying an Ethiopian influence that is actually indicative of ownership as the husband and wife team were both present and happy to discuss their products.

Translated roughly as new birth, the Café a passion project for the young woman who quit her job to take up baking full time, guests entering Lidet will quickly take note of a virtually spotless space that is brightly lit and nicely decorated, an overhead menu displaying Food and Beverage choices though several items from the list were not available over two hours after opening.

Describing the concept with enthusiasm, a menu that is Vegan-friendly yet free of fillers and emulsifiers no doubt commendable considering the limitations, it was after inquiring about several unlabeled items that an order of six was decided upon with a Cream Puff added complimentary, the whole lot's total just under $21.

Returning home to enjoy, though the Café itself is peaceful including shaded outdoor seats, it was with all goods unboxed and Coffee in hand that first bites were taken of Vegan Banana Nut Bread, the bitter flavor of Walnuts nicely balanced by Fruit but the Bread unfortunately lacking moisture while the non-Vegan Orange-Cranberry Loaf was no different, and as a matter of fact actually drier.

A bit discouraged as good Quick Breads can be found on both sides of Las Vegas Boulevard, though Teff Loaf that is naturally Gluten-free stood out for its uniquely spongy texture and light sweetness, it was with good fortune that both Lidet's Choux-based items were dramatically better, the same Custard Filling first tasted creamy and pure followed as a backdrop to Dark Chocolate Drizzle.

Rounding out the morning with two more items, a $3.75 ""Napoleon"" besieged with sogginess that compromised what otherwise could have been an interesting compilation of Custard, Pastry and Nuts, it was as another source of disappointment that a still-warm Almond Croissant was found to be filled with Frangipane, a seemingly odd choice as naturally ground Almonds would seem far better fitting Lidet's focus on natural ingredients.

**1/2:  Small, hidden in a strip-mall and run by folks who care it would be great to sing the praises of Lidet Café & Bakery but as it stands there is not much here to bring one back with Manan just up the Street and the likes of Rosallie, Breizh and others nearby except perhaps the Cream Puffs or an interest in tasting the Teff Bread.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,15,12,3,PIN7U0ZNe7TDTG28Ipnn8g

Yohannes was very kind and even offered to stay open late if I couldn't make it before closing, thankfully I made it with minutes to spare and got two servings of the tiramisu, and boy am I happy that I came back that same day.

I saw the reviews for Lidet Cafe & Bakery and gave them a call and thought, I have nothing to lose by asking them if they will deliver. The reason this was important to me, was I wanted this cake as a surprise for my brother's 70th birthday. When he was a child, our mom would bake him a pineapple upside down cake in a cast iron skillet, it's always been his favorite. My brother lives in Boulder City, NV and I live in Seattle, so I could not make him the cake.  I called Lidet and spoke with Yohannes.  He was so wonderful and when I told him my story and what I wanted, he said they don't typically deliver but he would be happy to do so. If you don't know the area, Las Vegas, where Lidet is located, is not that close to Boulder City, it's a good 40 min to 1 hr. drive. Today is the day and the cake was delivered.  My borther called to tell me how wonderful the cake looked and said it's absolutely delicious!!! I can not thank Yohannes and his wife enough for making my brother's birthday so special.
