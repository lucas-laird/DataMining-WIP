Ended up getting spaghetti Bologna's and a chicken parmesan sandwich as well as a loaf of fresh italian bread and an antipasti salad.  The prices actually seemed to go down (at least stay the same) as they were in the last 2 years.  The food and service are still excellent and you can really taste the quality that using primo ingredients and passion that chef Marc uses in his food.  It is superior to every other italian food I have tried from some so-called ""italian"" restaurants.  The portions are huge, and while it isn't cheap, you get what you pay for and the deli prices are no more than what you pay at the grocery store for deli meats and cheeses as well as bread.  It is also the only place I know that sells actual fresh pasta.  Yum",GZI0VPDn2FXvq-SQJckrTg,0,0,5,iSrVV722uwUd772bEEsYeA

Chef Marc can be seen constantly on the floor engaging guest and creating a rapport. Service is always great and friendly. I can't remember our server's name but he's always there and he's so wonderful. Canolis are always filled fresh. The tiramisu is the best in Las Vegas. Great place for a date night.

My coworker had the Meatball sandwich and was equally pleased. He said it was the best he'd ever had.

114202,2012-01-08,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I've driven by Parma for over a year, and wondered what it was like. I knew of Chef Marc's previous location a mile or so North, but hadn't been to Parma. Today my husband & I decided to try it for lunch. It's location makes the restaurant appear more like a deli than a nice Italian restaurant.  We initially didn't want a ""sit down"" meal, but when we got inside we knew we had to stay. 
We were greated upon arrival by our waitress, who was wonderful. Unfortunately I can't remember her name.  She helped with selection of our meals & answered our questions with great enthusiasm!  I wanted a 1/2 sandwich and she never tried to up-sell me on a bigger one. She offered a salad, which was a great choice. It was fresh with homemade Italian dressing. I ordered the eggplant parm sandwich (half). It was the best I have ever had.  My husband ordered the full Italian sausage sandwich, & brought the 2nd half home.  The food was a little late coming out-we were told the bread was over toasted. To make up for this, we were offered complimentary dessert. We were so full, but couldn't pass it up. It was a 4 layer lemon cake with whipped cream frosting.  SO good! 
We asked about their dinner menu. Our waitress told us how the menu is different every night & then explained ""Pizza Night"" on Wednesdays.  The best part was her excitement over their menu & Chef Marc.  We are excited about taking friends with us next time.  By the way, the bread is wonderfully fresh and Delicious!",h334VT43xjYg-k6i7vb6AQ,0,0,5,MebenrUS22Q74oVcG13HRA
142681,2014-06-03,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Well, my review is based on a visit I had to Parma about a month ago, it was my first time, based on the great yelp reviews and close proximity to my home. The Italian beef sandwich was great, the au jous phenomenal! The combination of the bread, cheese and meat was great -... But, I'll never visit them again based on service.   Let me elaborate. 

I was checking the menu and the young lady at the counter asked if I knew what I wanted.. I told her it's my first time and I'm checking the sandwiches - she turned around and went back to doing whatever she was doing (it was about 2:30 in the afternoon - no line, a couple of folks waiting for their order, a large party was finished and folks were milling around, talking etc.).   I decide on the large Italian beef and wait a few minutes and finally had to say 'excuse me, I'm ready to order'.  I place my order,pay and sit down on a couch.  I wait the 10 or so minutes and it looks like my order is ready.  A different gal asks the girl who took my order 'who is this for'?  The girls responds,' some Indian looking guy' . 

For goodness sakes people I'm sitting right in front of you! The gal with my food was kind enough to look at me and gave me a look of apology and a thank you. Food was good but service was horrible - no worries, I'll just eat elsewhere.  For a place with such a reputation, I figured they would treat paying customers with a bit more respect.",2hlgQi8j6XOtVEP5SNW3vQ,2,0,2,Era9y7xVpm-DaEDQktjw8Q

The server apologized and said the chef was training a new employee.  Not sure why you would use your customer as the Guinea Pig.  She took it back and we ordered a hot ham and cheese.  The sandwich came out cold and had ingredients on it that were not listed on the menu.  The server was nice and that is the only good experience we had.

158379,2011-10-06,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"It's a very rare dining experience that makes me give a five star review. I just had such an experience at Parma.  

I am not a fan of black tie settings that sacrifice quality of food in favor of sterile exclusivity and a faux posh atmosphere.  Parma makes no such sacrifice. 

The best Italian meal I had was in a small town in Tuscany called Monti. It was someone's house that doubled as the village restaurant.  And although I spoke no Italian, we dined with the family on the freshest dishes in a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. Dinner at Parma was no less special.  Amazing food, quality service and an ambiance that is uniquely both casual yet truly authentic in it's Italian roots.  

We had a wonderful Chilean wine followed by a Margherita pizza as an appetizer. My wife and I then shared the pork chop el Chico which was fabulous. 

But what made the entire evening so great was the time and care chef Marc took to help us decide which menu items would make our meal special for us.  The time he took, the food he prepared and the wonderful atmosphere of his restaurant made five stars a given. Trust me, you'll love it!",UCK3fHHHfgKKcsuPyicPEg,1,0,5,4PoBfjJPJqx4u-XhyvPobA

When he finally reappeared we had already decided we'd just take our check for the wine & leave. We told him of our decision and asked for a check. He never came back w/the check.

When my birthday dinner accidentally got scorched, we opted for going out to eat! I searched my fellow Yelpers, and found Parma by Chef Marc with huge reviews & had to try!

I have driven by this location literally hundreds of times and did not notice it... perfect! I hate it when great places get so busy that it becomes non intimate when you go to visit, or impossible to get a table. But I had to Yelp because it truly was a fantastic experience, and they deserve to stay in business forever!

You walked in and the light is low, there's a lounge area in the middle, a fresh deli along the back, and tables around the sides. We immediately were greeted and seated. The bread was soft and flavorful, I really like the balsamic they serve! 

I ordered the spinach manicotti with pink basil sauce and topped with mozzarella that was so fresh I was in heaven! My husband ordered the Orecchiette that had such a robust full flavor, without being too powerful, just wondetful! Our kids each had the spaghetti with meatballs and we're thrilled.

My friend told me about this place that had good hand-made pasta. What I found was something else entirely. Everything about the evening was a pleasant surprise. Upon entering, you're greeted with a friendly staff in what appears to be a deli/grocery store. The dining tables are tucked near the side of the restaurant and the main visual is a giant deli-style counter. But unless you're expecting a world-class Michelin Star experience, decor isn't a big deal. Just bring on the food. The wait staff was awesome. They were prompt and gave us some great suggestions on dinner. We're suckers for daily specials and chef recommendations, but you really do need to listen to the folks at Parma. They know what they're talking about. We did a huge family style meal. Some highlights:

Portabello mushroom appetizer - Not sure what they call this but it was amazing. Perfectly cooked portabello mushrooms served over greens and a cheesy cream sauce. We used the bread to mop up all of the leftover sauce when the portabello was gone. Next time I'm going to ask if they can put this sauce over some pasta.

Antipasto - Great variety of deli meats, cheeses, and greens. Fresh is the running theme for the night. The quality of the vegetables is evident in all the dishes.

Mozzarella appetizer - Remember what I said about the vegetables?When you take a bite into the cheese, tomatoes, and spinach, your focus isn't on the mozzarella, it's on the veggies. It's fresh, crisp, and full of flavor. The mozzarella's almost an afterthought.

Chicken Marsala - I'm usually not a fan of the Chicken Marsala. Maybe it's because I've eaten it too much. Maybe it's because I worked at Cheesecake Factory in college and I had to smell Chicken Marsala every... single... night. Needless to say, I wasn't especially looking forward to Chicken Marsala. I don't hate it, but I usually don't order it willingly. When I took a bite out of the Parma Chicken Marsala, I was blown away. It's unlike any other. Most other restaurants will cook away the Marsala wine completely. Chef Marc decided to leave a bit of the wine in and it totally makes the dish. The leftover alcohol lingers on the tongue. Totally unexpected. I'm hoping that's by design and not a mistake.

Frutti de Mar - A little on the pricey side but it's definitely delicious. Big pieces of shrimp, clams, and scallops are nestled in a bed of linguini. I was looking for a bit of seafood flavor in the sauce and it was definitely there at the end. I think we saved the dishwasher some work. There was nothing left our plates when we were done.

Nice little surprises were spread out over the night. A fresh batch of some grated exotic cheese one moment. A complimentary serving of prosciutto the next. Jason really took care of us.

Parma's not cheap. If you expect Olive Garden prices, you should go to Olive Garden and get the all-you-can-eat pasta and breadsticks for  $7.99. Do you get a good value for your dining dollar at Parma? Oh yah. Pass the bread, please.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,4,4,5,Bnv6_F1PiJQ-huFP32LaUg

My brother had butternut squash ravioli in a brown butter sauce and that was delicious. Better choice than my dish and reminded me of a dish i had before at a strip restaurant. 

Odd location but its nice because they sell meats and cheese at the counter as well as dry food products like pasta sauce, olive oil, etc.

Our waiter told us their portions were not ""Cheesecake size"" and he was not kidding.  Small and pricey would be an appropriate description. 

One of our party ordered eggplant parmesan and was told that was so ""American.""  The eggplant parm came out cold.  We were also told butter for the bread was so ""American""  and only Americans, not real Italians,  used olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette to dip their bread in, although that is how the bread was served--strange.   

I had the clam linguine which was all right.  It's certainly not the best I have ever had, but it wasn't the worst.

It's not salty.
It's not greasy.
NOT your normal italian fast food joint.

The prices may not be for a poor college/high school student eating Mickey D's day in and out, but the quality of their ingredients calls for the price tag. I'd say it's -very- fairly priced. As in for the flavor and everything going into it, i feel like it's cheap. And if you really want to still go but your wallet is severely malnourished, their lunch menu is great! It's from 10AM-4PM!

I think i read a review here about a weird clash of atmosphere, I'd agree, but it works.
The food tastes so expensive yet the decor is so casual. The workers are friendly. It's a harmonious clash. I would say the feels is like strolling into a Chanel boutique with sweatpants on.

The Riggies was amazing. Also their Parma Salad tasted BEAUTIFUL. Oh Lord, if the decor matched the food we'd be on the top floor of a huge building surrounded by crystal chandeliers.

Then came our waitress, who took our order with menus.  She was friendly but we only saw her for the order and at the end for the check. 
I had to call across the room three times to get her attention to take the veal away, because we couldn't eat it.  She removed the item from our bill. 
I didn't want to complain about all the food and service, because I had invited two people to dinner.  I was horrified, with the entire dinner. 

While all this was happening the owner was eating dinner with his back to the restaurant. 

The entire staff didn't seem professional.....like the Island of Misfit toys....table wasn't bused timely, water wasn't kept filled, it was awful.  Could not wait to leave. 

We went next door to Trader Joes and bought groceries and went home and made dinner. 

FOOD:  Zero points.  Each pasta was between 19-22 dollars.  

 The veal ravioli was fatty and bland.  No sauce added.  The presentation was nonexistent.  The green beans were flash cooked and tasted raw. 

 The beet salad, was not finely sliced ....rather ice cold chunks out of the fridge.  

  The ""wild mushroom"" pasta was not fresh.  Rather the cook used dried mushrooms which were not properly rehydrate.  They were awful.  The papadella noodles were not cooked through and crunchy.  

The only plate that was edible was the sausage ravioli.  Nothing special. 

Can I also mention that they served all the plates with no presentation.  The Parmesan cheese was in a shaker.  Most fine Italian restaurants serve their pastas with freshly shaven Parmesan.  Not here.",LzvHir7xR4--i-vdtZFBVQ,3,1,1,z6uO98Bs1f9-VsIa2ZIl7w

This is the real deal authentic italian food. Fresh pasta makes all the difference. I stop by and pick up pasta by itself when I make pasta at home with my own sauce. They sell several different kinds by weight. 

My girlfriend seems to order the shrimp fra diavolo every time and it's delicious every time I eat/steal her leftovers. They make it as spicy as you want it.   The chicken parm is huge and awesome.  The pork el Chico is probably my favorite. 

I've gone here for lunch a few times and the serving size and prices are perfect. The spicy sausage sandwich is my fav.

They have a good wine selection and I've never been disappointed with anything. I've been coming here since they first opened and they have been getting more popular ever since for a good reason.

Chef Marc came out and talked with my fiancee and I and basically told us that we could mix and match different sauces with the pastas. It almost seemed as if he was daring us to give him something new to try. It was very personable and intimate. There were just a few tables and chairs. The rest of the staff was attentive but not overly friendly. The waitress brought us our waters and a delicious garlic bread. It really tastes as if it has been steamed in garlic or baked with garlic ground up in the bread. Very delicious. I ordered the gnocchi in the basil cream sauce. I am very picky about gnocchi but besides Ferraro's it is one of the best gnocchis I have tried in the U.S. Very delicious! My fiancee tried the gnocchi in a ragu sauce and it was just as good.

Got there just before they reopened at 5:05. Were seated fairly quickly, being we were the only customers, but the person who seated us seemed put out because we didn't have a reservation. One server took our orders (we had 3 serve us, the original was started serving a party and just ignored us) and disappeared, only saw him once until the check, which he delivered after we asked for it.  We got the appitizer of portabello mushrooms with spinich and melted cheese--was VERY GOOD, but delivered by another server. I was thinkiing this was going to be as good as the reviews. This is when the service deteriorated. Our drinks were empty from the time the app came until our entrees, mine a full 3 minutes before the rest of the table was served their entrees. I got the special, veal over brocolini, tasty but not remarkably so. The side of fettucini with sunday sauce was plain, not much taste. My wife had the ravioli, sauce runny, ravioli need to bathe in the boiling water for another minute or two, very very aldente and overall plain. Another in our party got the lasagna, said was plain lasagna nothing special. The overall meal was just plain, not much flavor to the food, except the app. Service was spotty at best.

Also ordered the chicken parm, which was huge, homey and satisfying. We watched a variety of dishes go by to other smiling patrons and heard them discussing how tasty their food was. They make their own sausage, so don't deny yourself the opportunity! Dessert, espresso and cappuccino was on par with everything else. We had lots of leftovers and had to go the whole distance.

1072180,2013-03-20,1,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"So I ate at Parma tonight. Far surpassed any meal I've had on the strip of celebrity chefs. Chef Marc is from a city in up state NY that is known for its old school Italian food. In Marc's Early days he quickly rose to the top of the cities best chefs. As he left to expand his culinary skills. Traveling across Italy,he returned with a vast knowledge of the food as well as the wine. Parma is a true blend of his passion and knowledge. 
As a restaurant owner of 27 yrs inspired by chef Marc's earlier days. I was highly impressed by not only chef Marc's food but his staff. If you are a local embrace it. If you are visiting take the short ride from the strip. You won't be sorry.

It's funny because I have shopped in this plaza so many times, but the restaurant is sort of tucked away and unassuming-looking, that I never realized such amazing food was hiding within.  
I came for lunch and ordered the Italian Beef sandwich and lovely glass of wine the server recommended.  The sandwich was under $10 and huge,  I took one look thought, good I will have some for later - but, no, I couldn't stop eating even though it was a lot of food.  The beef was thinly sliced, tender and tucked inside of the perfect roll.  You just can't underestimate how much impact the right choice of bread can have on a sandwich.  This roll was crusty and sturdy enough to hold together even when dunking the sandwich in sauce.  Yet, it wasn't too bread-y.  The sauce was spicy and perfect.
It was so delicious, I made sure to tell just about everyone I know how good the sandwich was, then I have spent the last week daydreaming about it and wondering when I can go back.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,0,1,5,o7sl42iDudMKu94megceqA

However on this last visit, we stood at the front waiting for a table.  There was a woman and a little girl ahead of us who got seated. Next?  Well the waiter never came back, never acknowledged us.  Oh wait!  He did come back and passed by us as he glared at us, never even muttering a word.  Now, Parma gets busy, but this is no busier than usual.  So after that happened, I said 'forget it' and walked out.  My man stood by for a few more moments but never received acknowledgement.  So he too left and we went home and cooked up some good food of our own.

So I thought to myself: 'did i have a booger on  my nose?'.  Perhaps they met their quota for Asians that night.  Just kidding!  But really, I will never go there again.  But I will have good memories of the food there.  Oh well!",K6wXNp4IIn84qfKs-io6Hg,1,0,1,bvgxSdsSxwnj9PZ2e4Dzkg

Read all the fantastic reviews for Parma and decided this must be the place. My first impression upon arrival was a little disappointing as I was expecting a nicer restaurant and instead found a very casual place. So I hoped the food lived up to its reputation and IT CERTAINLY DID! All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals. Started with good fresh bread. Everything was homemade and all our dishes were very well prepared. The birthday tiramisu they brought was just divine.,PG8V_G5XpZGKrkXRxRHtMQ,0,0,4,qn8X62r6lc2yUcfeHK_-SA

Reviewed August 25, 2011
I have been frequenting chef marc's restaurant for years and i quess i have never Visited on a wednesday night. What a surprise when we arrived to find chef marc outside in the parking lot with his huge brick oven pizza maker set up. I have known for a while that he had a pizza maker that he could take to events for catering but didnt know that he brings it to the restaurant on wednesdays. I was thrilled and he showed me that it is so hot in the brick oven that pizza cook in just a few minutes. The restaurant was filled with people so i might recommend a reservation on a wed nite. We got a table without a wait and immediately Was brought 2 wonderful glasses of wine. All the waiters there are wonderful and work hard and fast. I ordered the bianco pizza which was a white pizza with arugula on top. The crust was thin and crispy with great flavor. There is a pizza menu with special pizzas but u can also just choose your own  toppings to add to a margarita pizza if u want. My husband didnt want pizza so he ordered off the regular menu and had chicken cacciatore which always comes with a side of pasta. The regular menu is limited but they will make anything you want so just ask and the dish will appear. I also had lunch there the other day and had a meatball sub to die for. My favorite restaurant just got better with the pizza night!

1140549,2014-02-01,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This is a nice little Italian eatery complete with dine-in and take out options as well as a small deli. I opted to check it out for lunch and took my food to go, but it seems like a pretty nice place to dine in as well.

I got the meatball sandwich. I'm a meatball sandwich aficionado. This one came on a ciabatta, which was actually a really good choice for this sandwich. They dressed it up with a little oil and parmesan on top, and the bread was crusty enough to hold up to the inside of the sandwich and soft enough to easily bite into and enjoy. Really good bread, which I believe is the most important element in a good sandwich.

I opted for the large sandwich, which is 10"", and when I opened it up, I was pretty disappointed to find that there were only 2 meatballs, each cut in half. They're pretty decent sized balls, but definitely not on the generous side to say the least. There's lots of tasty mozzarella cheese, which was a big plus because you could tell it wasn't that cheap stuff that you get at some places. This cheese had some flavor to it. 

There was a perfect amount of sauce on it for me, too. Any less, and there wouldn't be enough to soak into the bread, and any more, there'd be a lot overflowing all over. The sauce had a slightly sweet flavor, with plenty of seasoning, the strongest being garlic and oregano. I thought it complemented the meatballs very well.

Finally, the meatballs. Really nice flavor to them. Seems to be the theme here, but you could tell they used good ingredients and have good technique because everything was thoughtfully seasoned. The balls were on the firm side, and the meat was ground very fine. Instead of being a little crumbly, the balls were solid. Not a bad thing, but it just depends on how you like them. Personally, I prefer softer meatballs, but these weren't to the point where they tasted dry.

It ended up to be plenty of food, but lose a star for bang for buck- there's gotta be more meatball!",aqG4p5ia0UF-1Hpx8HHcTQ,1,0,4,c3WLB57d5xlIBp0JJ9zOkw

Hands down the finest Italian food I've had in ages. The fruita de mar was amazing loaded with clams,mussels, calamari and fresh fish in an amazing red sauce with fresh basil. So balanced as not to over power the fish but hearty enough to bring alive the flavors of the homemade linguine . Dessert, tiramisu was fantastic. Subtle hits of anise in the mascarpone cheese. 
Even the cappuccino is so good you do not need to sweeten.,

1243749,2013-01-05,14,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Parma is one of those places where the food is so good that if it fell on the floor, I'd still eat it. 

No 10 second rule.

No shame.

I would legit, scrape everything off of the floor and eat it.

Because it would still be better than 90% of the food being slopped around in Las Vegas restaurants, some of which has fallen on the floor without your knowledge.

Parma looks like it might be a chain restaurant-the sign is generic and it's in this tiny strip mall, sharing space with a Trader Joe's and a K-Mart, but outside of that, there is nothing generic or conventional about it. Step inside and the setting is kind of romantic with low lighting, intimate seating and a cozy lounge. You'll forget that someone rushing to get toilet paper at K-Mart almost just mowed you down in the parking lot.

The food here is something to be celebrated. The menu here is a combination of main staples and specials of the day which keeps things fresh and interesting. More importantly, everything here just tastes like love! Who says that? I just said it! I brought my mom here, the pickiest eater I've ever met besides the 9 year old I nannied for in college, and she had not one complaint. Only the second time this has happened....in my life. On our visit, we had the beet salad which was enough to split between two people. The beets were fresh and we got a variety of colors which made for a pretty presentation. The dressing that came with it was simple but really brought all of the flavors of the salad together. My mom got some kind of cod and I got the pork chop ""el chico"" which was basically an enormous, quality pork chop with a sweet/hot pepper sauce. Like I said, my mom is the worst dining companion ever because she hates everything, but she  liked her fish so much that she was making audible noises of satisfaction when eating, which was embarrassing and satisfying at the same time. (I love to say ""I told you so"" when it comes to picking restaurants.)

I know some would consider it blasphemy to go to a place like this and not order pasta, but I didn't on my first visit. So when I came back with some friends, I dipped into their pasta selection with chicken riggies, ravioli and wild mushroom papardelle. It was hard to pick a favorite, but because I am partial to meat in my pasta, I was really surprised by how flavorful and complex the papardelle was-so amazing! I've had freshly made pasta before, but Parma has the best execution, cooking the pasta to perfection and not over or under-saucing it. 

 The staff is friendly and eager to share recommendations. They have a decent wine list and if you have a favorite you'd rather bring instead the corkage fee is only $10! 

What I like so much about this place is that their non-pasta dishes shine just as much as their pasta dishes- so hard to find when it comes to Italian food.  I'm so excited to have found a place that just loves to make incredible food as much as I love to eat it and can't wait to go back!",DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg,12,12,5,KTCfr8soX7DQ1o_8Fvv7ew

We were tired so we did the take out thing and when we got to the hotel we noticed they hadn't put silverware (plastic if you like) in our bag so we had to scramble to find forks. The food wasn't horrible but really wasn't anything to brag about. All in all we didn't enjoy it.

I add to this review because they have taken the time to follow up with me. I really do appreciate any place that is willing to follow up and actually listens to their customers.",lY5SW1kSc4LtwRzNoZ2HYw,1,1,4,nIiXSVfpMNqt4jTZkvQlbA

 THE PARMA (a spread of european olives and pepperocini topped with assorted italian meats & cheeses including imported provolone & mortadella from parma, italy, topped with shredded lettuce, olive oil & balsamic vinegar). My BF's kind of sammie: heavy on the meats, bold on flavor. Ask for it warmed in the oven.
THE CAMPANIA (Fresh? mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, sliced tomatoes, balsamic dressing), definitely my kind of sandwich: pesto and tomato and mozz balls, that's like the trifecta of Italian perfection, and I'm so glad I ordered it. 
NEW YORK: Classic meatball sando with tons of mozz. Incredible balls. Sandwich is $11 and easily feeds two, it's my go-to. Add on the pasta fagioli soup (hearty and fresh) and the chopped salad ($8 for a huge portion) and you've gone a great lunch date under $30.

The (great quality!) bread used for the sandwiches (different for each) and the overabundance of ingredients makes for large sandwiches that can be difficult to eat in public without making a mess- as in, I practically have to unhinge my jaw-  a little awkward.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,1,4,EvtRQxosBU6hnUkiDXw9yw
1510564,2015-03-26,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Was in Vegas for a bachelor party and the bachelor wanted to come here for dinner. We made a reservation for our group of 8 for 6:30pm. We arrived 15-20 minutes late but did make sure to call the restaurant ahead. 

Once we arrived, our table was waiting for us and were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly. We were ordering food and planning to share it family style. The waiter had great suggestions for how much food we should get.

We started with some escargot and some salad for appetizers. The escargot was delicious. I've had escargot by itself before so I knew what to expect but the way it was served on the bread with the garlic and other seasonings was delicious! I would highly recommend everyone giving it a try.

Overall the food came out quick and didnt really have any issues with any of it. While we were waiting for the main course, we were nibbling on the bread. The bread is damn good. Just try not to eat too much of it, though I would've been just fine eating the bread and the extra sauce from the escargot as my meal.

For our main course, we went with chicken parmesan, the 4 cheese ravioli with pesto sauce, and the Cavatelli Bolognese. They were all very good. I liked the chicken parmesan the best out of them all. A couple of the guys had to order their dishes separately due to being vegetarian and being sensitive to diary. They had the 4 cheese ravioli with a marinara sauce and a clam dish. The clam dish was quite large and smelled really good.

Something to note: if you are staying on the strip, this place is about 20 minutes away. The cab ride is going to be about $40. While the cab ride can be pricey, the food isn't very expensive (especially compared to food options on the strip) and is really good.

The only problem I had with this was that the sauce didn't taste astounding .. it sort of meshed with the parpadelle and didn't leave a distinct flavor. Maybe because there was too much sauce? 

x House Salad -- a nice little salad with fruit. Simple. 

x Gnnochi with meatballs -- We liked it but it wasn't as good as some of the places we had gnnochi in CA. The gnnochi was more on the mushy/chewy side and didn't have that nice firmness to it.

In March, our food took an hour to arrive and only then because we had started asking what the hold up was. The food was okay, nothing memorable, but the 60+ minute wait was. Because of that, we didn't hurry back.

Tonight was 45+ minutes and our order wasn't lost. Our server, Kay, almost totally ignored us the entire time. We had to ask another server for soda refills after she ignored them and us for too long. Kay did ask Hubby if his steak was cooked correctly, which it was, then didn't return until we finally got her attention.

 My food, a Jidori chicken dish, was inedible. The sauce was good but the chicken was dry and boring. She took it off the bill after I refused to wait another 45 minutes for something else. Hubby's peppercorn steak was abysmal, he said, but we paid for it and got out.

It is a cozy place with a neighborhood vibe. There is a deli and cheese counter in the front, along with a rack of specialty Italian ingredients and sauces for sale in the back of the restaurant. We actually picked up some stuff there because my sister in law and her husband were coming to visit from Italy and had promised us a home cooked Italian meal.

We chose to split the Antipasti salad that was prepared with a generous assortment of meat and cheese from the deli case. The salad was fresh and plentiful for the price of $12.00. We also split the very hearty Italian meat sandwich which only  comes in large (most of the sandwiches you have the option between regular and large). This was a monster of a sandwich with juicy beef, melted provolone and mozzarella cheese topped with pepperocinis. As delicious as it was, I could only handle about quarter of the sandwich. The husband happily annihilated the rest of it. The service was friendly and this made for a perfect break in our busy day.",7tpZVkiYuMbDP4-NufK2Iw,19,15,5,bflQNSGZgBrNIo4LUK9J4w

No matter the food was really good. among the entrées at our table was a chicken Parmesan, and a seafood linguine. Both fresh, and obviously attention paid to the handmade nature of the dish. 
The reason for the three stars and not four is that in the end believe it or not it lacked salt!
No seriously, the flavors were there, the herbs were there, but it was just bland. Who forgets salt...? Appreciate that I'm a wine drinker, and don't enjoy overpowering foods in anyway. But imagine any gourmet dish without an ounce of salt and you get a lot of bland flavor. I'll try them again no it update my review if it turns out that my experience was an exception to the rule.",5OpiAGyfo9bIjuxffvo8DA,0,0,3,xN8lgyGEeqDMkxe0sW1SiA
1661410,2011-05-23,3,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Just a note to start before reading this review:  Read RIchard C's review for the male perspective.  Read mine for the bubbly girl perspective.

This is an Italian gem of a restaurant in Vegas.  It's like finding your perfect other half and wondering where they've been all my life?  I felt the same with Chef Marc's Pastavino Deli.  I'm a Las Vegas native.  Where have you been all my life?!  

What brought us here was a recommendation by a friend of its fresh pastas.  I was looking forward to just that.  Chef Marc's dishes lit up my senses from amazing flavors to textures and followed through from beginning to end.  The ambiance is cute, romantic, homely (in a good way) with a touch of hole in the wall feel.  The service was impeccable.  Everyone on staff was super warm and friendly.  The whole experience almost felt like eating at an Italian mama's home kitchen.  Oh yes, do listen to your server's recommendation because our server Jason was on point with the recommendations.

The breakdown:
- Complimentary Fresh Garlic Bread - Warm.  Toasty.  Chewy.  Crusty with tasty aroma of garlic and parm on top.
- Portabello mushroom appetizer (Strongly recommended by Jason) - This was everyone's favorite of the evening.  Warm sauteed strips of portabello mushrooms in a creamy sauce served over a bed of baby spinach.  Don't neglect the leftover sauce.  Mop it up with the wonderful perfectly crusty garlic bread.
- Antipasto - Yummy cured meets tossed in with a variety of exotic cheeses, olives and greens.  Can't beat it.
- Caprese Salad Appetizer - The tomatoes were juicy.  The large leaves of basil for fragrant and the fresh mozzarella perfectly chewy and gooey.
- Chicken Marsala - This was the sleeper hit.  Usually not too impressed by chicken marsala, but this was a bite in heaven.  The slight essence of barely cooked of wine took everyone by surprise in a very good way.
- Orcchiette with Meatball - the fun ear like pasta wheels were perfectly al dente, chewy and bouncy swimming around in thick red sauce with a huge meatball.  This was a touch on the salty side for me, but the texture of the orchiette itself won handsdown.
- Agnoletti - This was another big winner!  Tubes of fresh pasta filled with savory beef/lamb mixture with a rich creamy white sauce.  Stick to your ribs good!  Again, don't forget to mop up the sauce with bread.
- Frutti de Mar - This was our last dish, filled with seafood goodies from clams to calamari to scallops.  The spagetti was of course cooked well and the sauce mopped up to the last drop.

Bonuses:  Extra exotic cheeses.  Sliced uber tasty prosciutto on the house!  Having a birthday boy on hand, they gave us some a bit of tart and sweet limoncello to toast!  

Conclusion:  It's is a FIVER (star) all the way.  I thought about bringing the rating down one star for being a touch too salty on some items, but the overall experience was too fantastic.  We left bellies full, wallets a little more empty and happily rolled our way home.",bW2AQqcSPascYvKXsF0S-g,6,4,5,WnJk3ChOeNXTGet_9TT0qg
1672933,2015-03-02,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Well let me start by saying we've been here for dinner and its been absolutely amazing! Now let's talk about lunch. I checked in on yelp as they claimed to have $3 off beer special per yelp checkin our server had absolutely no idea what I was talking about and proceed to ask me if I was sure it wasn't for the pizza place. I showed her my phone with the promo on yelp and she said let me talk to the chef. She came back after 15 mins of going back and forth she said that the chef said that the guy who does media and web specials is no longer with the company and they didn't know how to take it down and that they wouldn't grant the promo. Ok no biggie we've been here twice before and not only loved the food but also enjoyed talking to chef Marc so didn't make a big deal about it. My wife order the notorious Cab by the glass, which is on their menu,  and the server came back 5 minutes later saying they don't have it. We were already disappointed  twice but we brushed it off and proceed to look at the menu and asked for the popular complimentary bread thats toasted with garlic and cheese (I believe) but we got cold French bread, we were both disappointed as per our previous visits know it's always toasted warm bread so we asked her if she could warm up the bread she stared at the bread and said sure. We went ahead and order our lunch and waited for the bread to come back. To our surprise 15 mins later our lunch and the bread came out together and at that still cold. Lunch at Parma wasn't the worse experience we've had but a true let down compared to having dinner here. Let me say that the 2 stars is only for lunch and the servers poor service- she was really nice but far too casual and uninformed, had to go to kitchen for answers to every question we asked.  And the bread thing was just downright lazy.  As I've said before our dinner experiences here were amazing and my wife raved and gave Parma a 5 star rating I asked her not to change it and I'd yelp our lunch experience as I will be back for dinner soon. Again dinner is amazing just wouldn't recommend lunch here unless you plan on a grab and go sandwich from the deli.",b4Apa27UhLnHB2eHbKKTRw,2,0,2,FUiSBPOrU8w7XYH7T4MLyQ

Some of my favorites at this restaurant is their fresh pasta, meatballs, and I usually get whatever special they have. 

The only meal I've got here that I was not a fan of was their chicken Marsala. It had a heavy thick glaze with a strong unfamiliar taste. It's not the Marsala I'm used to. I wouldn't order that again. 5 stars because everything else has been so delicious.

I really like their service. We only asked about their olive oil on their display, and the server, which I forgot his name, brought and opened four different kinds of olive oil for us to taste together with more sliced bread. We bought four olive oils and lady fingers to go.

As we're out and at the neighborhood store, I looked at the receipt and noticed that they didn't charge us for our take home goodies. As a good samaritan, we went back to the store and told that guy about it. We paid the goodies and he gave us extra treat!

Chef Marc was in the house last night and availed himself to our table with a great overview of the nights specials. With guests from France in our party of 5, they were impressed and that says a lot given they are regulars in Roma restaurants. Each of us ordered different dishes with a great cross section view of the menu and not a single one of us would not order those dishes again. We shared a little of each, family style, they all were excellent. Seasoned to perfection, flavorful and a brilliant presentation. The cost totaled less than expected and we thank Parma for containing costs. It makes it easier for us to go back more often, especially since we love this food, ambience, and a well versed patient, competent wait staff. If there were to be any improvements, I would like to see a bit faster delivery of the dishes, but don't sacrifice the quality for speed!!!",yn9866OJCTkXeKnICnDDdw,1,2,5,vXIuig-QgrSBZrukx9KfcQ

Went for lunch, which is a limited menu with a few pasta dishes, hot and cold sandwiches, and salad...definitely round out enough for lunch, but my husband has been craving a clam/mussel pasta dish. My husband ordered a hot Italian beef sandwich which comes with an au jus and I got a hot parma.  My sandwich was solid...no complaints, exactly as described.  My husband's sandwich was TDF...I am not kidding, I don't eat bread, but he convinced me to take a full bite after he dipped it in the au jus...it was way more than I expected. So many textures and flavors...juicy meat, with a few tangy peppercinos, crusty bread, melted provolone, then dipped in au jus...PERFECTION!!!  Being east coast born and raised, reminds me of Jersey and Philly Italian joints, family we loved and ate at often.  Services was exceptional and definitely run by people that care about presenting good food and service.

I cannot wait to come back for dinner.  The environment is like an Italian familiy's living room...there are tables, but also couches to sit back and relax, possibly with a few glasses of wine.  You definitely can tell the wine menu is carefully selected...it isn't huge, but definitely well thought out to please as many customers but also show off Italian wines.

When we arrived it was ""Dinner time"" and neither of us were too interested in anything on the dinner menu we both really just wanted sandwiches which would be considered their lunch menu.  Diane was more than accommodating, I ordered the Chicken Parmigian sandwich (which is only available in a large) and my husband got a large turkey. Both sandwiches were amazingly delicious.

The quality of food you get at this place is above some of the posh Italian joints on the strip. All the servers are extremely friendly and Chef Marc will personally stop by your table to educate everyone on his unique creations. I've been here twice and never been disappointed with any of the food I've ordered. 

The best thing about their pasta dishes is that pastas are freshly made and their sauces are unique to each variety of pasta dish to compliment it.  I also love their mushroom and spinach appetizer, its not on the menu sometimes, but every time I've asked for it they have made it for us. I would also recommend their Chicken Marsala, the sauce is just out of this world. 

The tasting courses offered at Parma are also exquisite. Chef Marc take a liberty on trying out new dishes that combine old Italian recipes with neo-American Italian style. Lot of these experimental dishes were featured in a yelp event that I went to. The best thing about this event was  the way Chef Marc educated uninformed foodies like me about the history and his childhood experience with particular Italian dishes and his versatile take on it. 

This is the best Italian food you'll have in Las Vegas and for the the quality of food and the service make this the best deal for the prices they are charging. Its great for any occasion. And its the best way to end my 2014 Yelp review line up.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,2,3,5,ISVy_nd_1Irt4qlP_4_GOA

The last four times have convinced us never to enter the restaurant unless Diane is there. The ""gentleman"" who seems to manage the place during the day time is so aloof and downright rude that you leave the restaurant upset that you gave anyone there any money.

On our last dining experience two groups--one on each side of us--both expressed the same sentiments. The staff during the day is horrible, and it affects the entire experience of dining.

It is a shame, Chef Marc, that you do not have better people representing your restaurant. Let me say this to you and to everyone considering dining here: if Diane is there, you will love this place. If she is not, you will despise it... despite the incredible efforts of the kitchen staff.

We'll start with the one positive thing.. the bread is delicious! But with that being said... on the menu it reads that should you request extra bread it will cost you $3.00 because the supplier is charging more. $3.00?! I better get more than just one extra basket! 

Reading many reviews and being a big fan of Novecento, this was disappointing. The service lacked incredibly!! No smile, no introduction, no recommendations!! For my first time and with all these reviews you would think they'd have some pride to talk to you about the place and the must haves.

We started with the Parma salad... WEAK! It was absolutely boring and I tasted more olive juice than an actual dressing. Next we had the Greens Juliana it was so salty, that the Parma salad could've used some of that! For entree's we ordered Chicken Parmesan- Overcooked and boring, that dish came out and I stared and said wow.. that looks pathetic. I took a bite of the side pasta... the most overcooked noodles you could get with what canned tomato sauce?! Add some basil or something to bump it up! If I need to put salt on pasta... WHAT?! Mind blown. I ordered the Mushroom Parpadelle- bland bland oh did I mention bland? With pieces of I believe pancetta it could save this dish but no.. It fails. It was almost as if they just cooked some mushrooms and dumped it on the noodles without really creating a ""sauce.""

First, you are always greeted by a member of the staff, often Chef Marc; and if what you want is not on the menu, or you're in the mood to try something new, Marc will prepare it for you.  Further, this is THE only place I've been to in Vegas where you can get great fresh pasta, sauces, cheeses and tastycakes, an East Coast delicacy that everyone should try.  (I think Krimpets alone got me through my grade school lunch trading days).  

The environment is casual - I've enjoyed sandwiches to-go, take-out dinner, sit down lunch, a glass of wine in the comfy sofa area as well as a nice, long dinner with a great bottle of wine.  Just a great place to sit down and have a meal.  In addition, the staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, the wine list, etc.  Our waiter was quick to suggest an alternate wine (which was a hit) and was friendly, informative, fun without being intrusive.

The Food: 4 stars

The service: 3 stars.

Decisions.

If only I could do a three and a half star review!

As I said in my last review, I decided to try Pastavino again, but for dinner instead. I attended last Saturday night. The atmosphere was better during the evening, it was packed with faces that all looked happy, and I over heard a woman talking about Chef Marc's home cooking, I suppose they know each other. Everyone looked as if they had been dining at the same place every week for years! It was very cozy, and in fact while we were dining some of my family and family friends came in to dine! How funny is that?

So, my major problem with this place is the time it takes to get the food out. Every single course took far too long to get to our table, in my opinion.

Ps: I got bread this time! Lots of it! I believe, 3 baskets over the course of our time there? No oil and vinegar though, drat :/.

Appetizer:
Chef Marc came to our table and recommended the Scungilli Salad, and you know what? I do too! It was so, so, so, incredibly refreshing and light. A great way to start!  -$16.00
We also ordered the Escargo which, while good, wasn't my favorite way of having it. Oh well. -$9.00

Dinner:
I enjoyed the Linguini and Clams, while my fellow diners enjoyed the Pork Chop and the Bolognese dinner.

BUT before we enjoyed them, we waited. A good amount of time. It seemed a little hectic that night...Chef Marc came and cleared our table and called for his staff to get us new silverware...hmm. Chef, although your wait staff wasn't the best of the bunch that evening, the food was delicious!

After dinner we tried the Tirimisu, and the Polenta cake. 

BUT before we could try it, we waited. 

Even,

longer.

AND THEN! We stared at our desserts, as they were placed in front of us at a different table...we looked around wondering if that was ours...but waited some more.

and then it came...
and it was amazing. I loved the polenta cake so much! I'm dreaming about it right now...

Sooo, even though the service was...Eh. I AM a fan of the dinner at Pastavino. Would I go again.....aayyee, yes.
And I'm hoping when I go again my review can become a four star or five star one.

Or, perhaps fortunately since I'm pretty sure if you eat nothing but chicken parm sandwhiches 3 meals a day you would die. But it would be a pretty good way to go. Parma is tucked away in a little shopping centre and doesn't try to play the flashy game of strip restaurants. But the food delivers, and thats all that really matters. 

Let me tell you a little about this chicken parm sandwhich. First, it comes on garlic bread. I know this is obvious/other places have been doing it for years. But the fact remains that this is some of the best garlic bread I have ever gotten from a restaurant- its not mildly garlicy, its a knockout punch of garlic. The sandwhcih is also enormous- many will strain to finsih it in one sitting. The quitters are not worthy of such a sandwhich however, as the last few bites are always among the tastiest. 

I have also had the bolognese which was also quite good. 

The service here is always excellent and attentive. It's a small, intimate sort of place with not that many tables which can make it hard to get a seat during peak times so plan accordingly.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,3,3,5,zI6wpySNa6_nMDlW9nduzw

Anyway i never been here before but often hear the raves of Chef Marc and how totally awesome is it. Lately i've been hankering for some good Italian food. So i set up a UYE http://www.yelp.com/biz/tien-hosted-a-uye-uye-at-parma-by-chef-marc-las-vegas

10 people all going for tasting menus with some opting for wine paring. I'm not exactly a wine kinda guy so just food for me. Tho their italian beers were quite nice.

Cant exactly remember what we all ate but it was good. Damn good. If i wore panties they'd be dropped by the 3rd course. Oh and holy crap the bread is NICE!!! with the garlic butter on top and the balsamic vinegar and olive oil...sooooo nice

So going off of memory lets see what we had

1 - Conch Salad
 - Very good texture, soft and not rubbery and oh so tender. Flavor was a little off for me but it opted a good opportunity to use the ""real"" salt they offered. Balanced quite nicely after that

2 - Escargot (our special diet friends who opted not to have escargot got some kind of ravioli)
 - Two per person served on a slice of bread drenched in garlic butter with some herbs. Not exactly the freshest snails available but they did their best with what they had and it was no less then absolutely delicious 

3 - Fried Brussels sprouts with some kind of spicy prawn
 - I've only eaten brussel sprouts on a handful of occasions. These were halfed then fried to give them a nice flavor. The spicy prawns...wow just wow these were nice and plump and had a mild rising heat to them. Again quite nice

4 - Pasta with wild mushrooms in some kinda sauce with ham in it - Pappardelle Wild Mushroom
- LoL at my naming of items. This was the highlight of my dinner. The absolute best thing in my opinion. Pretty sure it was fresh pasta seeing as i've never seen noodle that big only on TV. The sauce they whipped up to bind the pork and mushrooms together with the noodles...genius...Ask Christie O i kept trying to steal her togo box the entire night.

5 - Some kind of fish... - Wild Snapper Livornese
- Some kind of fish and a portion of a barley like grain served with a tomato based sauce and a few strips of broccolini. 

6 - Dessert - Turamisu and Chocolate Mousse Cake
 - Holy crap the little square of Tiramisu was orgasmic. The other chocolate cake thingie was good but holy hell the tiramisu...

Recommendations:

Italian Bread with butter (included) - Always fresh and a nice starter every time..

Spaghetti Bolognese Pork: Fresh Pasta (made in house), little chunks of sausage, little chopped cubes of carrots and their red sauce.. The pasta was Incredible, sauce was like butter with some aromatic and delicious olive oil  and an excellent balance of tomato sweetness and tart that was sure to more than satisfy!.. 

Spaghetti Zucchini Pomodoro: Fresh Pasta, thick slices of zucchini, herbs, red sauce.... 99% of the time, I order pasta with some type of meat (meatballs, sausage, beef, chicken..), this time I decided to go meatless.. WOW!!!!! Seriously, this was Beyond Anything I expected.. One of The Best Pasta Anything I've Ever Ate!  

Meat Lasagna: Fresh slices of pasta in between layers of meat, sauce, ricotta.. Rich in flavor, got that creaminess to it and definitely filling. Should fill up 2 hungry people and have leftovers.. 

Rum Cake: Definitely had that rum liqour  fragrance, moistness and taste that will send you off to dessert bliss! Nothing too Fancy, Just Rumtastic!

The first time I dined here, I was so impressed that I almost stayed to have dinner right after a late lunch.. Like Back to Back Meals!! Every night, the chef comes in and decides what will be on the menu for that particular night. So next time, So and so dish might not show up again or at least for a while.. 

The service was great every visit, lunch prices awesome, dinner prices average and the ambiance very comforting and a tad elegant the same time. Aside from the typical bench, table/chair dining, they also got couches/coffee table seating as well. *Most importantly*, Both Spaghetti entrees mentioned above deserve Much More than a 5 Star Praise!!!!!

2146352,2010-02-01,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This quirky gem of a deli / restaurant was on our food radar thanks to Yelp reviewers.  Food superb, service stellar, ambiance....well, interesting.  

As is the owner, Chef Marc, who on our first visit (for takeout) was not in the kitchen but  holding court in ""sofa lounge"" section of the space, enjoying beverages  with a couple of lovely young ladies who seemed entertained by his every word.  On our second visit (for dinner) the next day, we were disappointed to learn the Chef was not in the house as we had called ahead of making our reservations specifically for a night Chef Marc was scheduled in the kitchen as we had heard about his personal talents. But he was indisposed at home we were told as we were seated and asked if he was cooking.  Our disappointment faded quickly as we found dinner did not suffer without him present; the food was delectable and the service top notch.

BOTTOM LINE:  This is on our ""go back"" list when we're in Las Vegas. Were it in our hometown, we'd be regulars. Seemed like mostly locals on  both nights we visited.  Sometime we'd love to come back with a group and reserve the Chef's table for off the menu Italian food experience. 

NW VEGAS  OFF STRIP LOCATION: About fifteen minutes drive off the LV strip in the unlikely location of a mall that is also home to KMart and Trader Joe's..  Cost of round trip cab fare added to the dinner tab may make this destination outside the bounds for those staying on the strip without their own transportation.  But if you have a car go to Parma!

FABULOUS FOOD: Full service restaurant serving lunch and dinner and take out Italian deli combined here.( Dinner service starts at 5p.)   We enjoyed...

...antipasto for two. Thanks to others who recommended this and encouraged us to order it.  A generous mix of salumi along with cheeses and olives on a bed of perfectly dressed  fresh salad greens, it may be the best of the kind we have ever eaten.

...spaghetti carbonara.  One of our favorite pastas but an act of faith to order in a restaurant as it requires the pasta and eggs to be combined just right to get a silky sauce and not raw egg.  This was perfect, wonderfully flavored with pancetta  and just the right amount of cracked black pepper and cheese  enhanced by the addition of peas, it arrived at our table piping hot.  

...egglplant parmesan.  An absolutely delicious rendition of a classic, this one was not breaded, it was perfectly seasoned, cooked to the right consistency and sweetness with good red sauce and a generous amount of melted mozzarella.  

We finished by sharing a slice of the yummy rum cake and very good coffee.  

(Side note...take out cannoli on another day, filled as we waited on them as good cannoli should be, were outstanding!)

GOOD WINE:  The wine list was surprisingly broad for such a small place and thoughtfully composed.  We ended up ordering by the glass for four glasses total in combo of prosecco to start followed by Nero d'Avola and Primitivo.

GREAT VALUE:  Total bill for this meal was about $80.   It could easily have fed three people and we had leftovers to bring back with us to the LV condo where we were staying. 

STELLAR SERVICE:  We had the good fortune to have Christian be our server.  We noted he also was attending to the customers who arrived for take out (and the take out business was brisk) and in general seemed to keep things humming with the kitchen and other wait staff.  Christian made all customers feel most welcome, and he made service seem effortless.  As with the table next to us, a couple of regulars who had special requests that we might most charitably say were difficult, and Christian made it seem simple.  If you are a restaurant owner, an employee like this is worth his weight in gold.  

QUIRKY AMBIANCE:  Great aromas as you enter.  Wonderful ""fit"" selection of Italian music or popular tunes by Italian American recording artists on the sound system.  (Frankie, Dino, Como...)  

Eclectic  ""vibe"" with dining tables around the perimeter and an odd arrangement of coffee tables and sofas in the middle of the room.  We guess Chef Marc fancies this a lounge.  But this furniture provided a sense of obstacle course to get to the deli / take out counter.   For our two bits, it would be best to do a little space planning and  have a clear and inviting path for all customers to get to the incredible deli.

ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES:  Tight spacing of furniture would make wheelchair access difficult, it seems to me.  Also, while the loo was accessible in design, it seems it would be impossible for a wheelchair user to get through the aisles to get there.  Easy barriers for the owner to remove with furniture rearrangement.",3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g,1,1,4,3sJL-vdGL-0Jq9XadsVXvg
2150568,2015-04-22,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This is a lunch review. 

The Skinny: skip lunch and come for dinner - food is better albeit more pricey(2); service is good (3); value: relatively expensive for the level of cuisine for lunch and not worth coming back for. Dinner is another review(2 starred review). 

We have been to Parma before during dinner time and the food is good albeit kind of expensive for the portion size. When I saw that they had a truncated but less expensive lunch menu,  I was sold. 

So we ordered a small side salad ($3),  fazoletti ($12), and spaghetti with meatballs(actually it is one big meatball,  $12)

Bread service is not at all like dinner time.  The French bread is cold,  chewy and a far cry from the crisp, warm garlic bread they have at dinner. Served with butter,  we had to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. 

The side salad was a little sad and meager. (One slice of tomato with 6 chickpeas a few olives and shaved onions with 7 pieces of red leaf lettuce.) The flavors were not well integrated. 

Fazoletti was a huge disappointment (this was supposed to be a baked pasta dish with Sunday meat sauce,  ricotta topped with mozzarella). The dish came onto the table looking like more of like a standard pasta dish with no golden brown cheese topping from baking. Never had a Sunday sauce taste so bland without a hint of aromatics or acidity to lighten the dish. To add insult to injury,  the meat chunks mixed in with the sauce were salty. The paparadelle itself was nothing to write home about and I felt a tad overcooked. 

Their best dish was the spaghetti and meatball but even that was far from perfect.  The meatball was pretty firm and overly salty. The marinara sauce was much better than their Sunday sauce but still lacked the sufficient aromatics to make it spectacular. The spaghetti at least was perfectly al dente.

In terms of the ratio of sauce/gravy (whatever  you want to call it) to pasta, the pasta was overly dressed for my tastes in both the dishes. 

Service was prompt and efficient. 

It is hard to believe this is the same restaurant we came to before. I am not sure if this was an off day or what but after looking at other reviews for lunch,  ours is not an isolated incident. Our previous experiences here would have ranked this place about a 3.5 starred joint with a bump up to 4 stars if only the prices were a bit more reasonable.  But given the lunch items,  this place scores a 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,2,3,2,t0T9XU-6NWWdSg3wmREXew

Some people think the price of the dish makes the quality. Nope .. Sometimes the best dishes are not as expensive as those sold at the fine dining restaurants that people seem to flock to. 

I have to admit when my friend suggested this place for a 30th  birthday dinner we all had our doubts. Pretty off the strip and it was in a strip mall -_-
After we had our bread we eased up a little. Amazing.... 
FILET MIGNON EL CHICO ~ HOLY MOLY this thing was massive. Had a little kick and heat with I loved. It was really the size of my face. Couldn't finish it all and we ate some back in L.A. was still amazing.

2196199,2012-04-25,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"what could i possibly say to properly describe the incredible journey we took through italy in a little pastavino in las vegas?
my vocabulary is far too limited.

i was fortunate enough to attend nelson q's 2nd UYE at chef marc's - http://www.yelp.com/biz/uye-steppin-out-mangia-with-chef-marc-round-2-las-vegas.
we were all served the chef's tasting menu which was jam packed with farm fresh, local ingredients.
farm to table = NOM!

i have dietary restrictions but chef marc and his crew had no problem adjusting the menu to accommodate me.

to begin the evening, we had the unique opportunity to see chef marc make the first cut into a 2 year old wheel of grana padano.
it was quite an undertaking as the entire wheel weighed almost 100 pounds.
it's difficult to describe the flavor of this intense cheese but i'll give it a go.
it's a semi hard cheese with hints of saltiness, creaminess and sharpness.
similar to Parmigiano Reggiano but not as crumbly.

first course:
a tempura sampling of squash blossoms, basil and sage with their homemade marinara.
i'm uber picky about my marinara - not too sweet, not too tangy.
chef marc's is perfection.
and then fried anything is just good, right?
a most perfect starter.

second course:
salad made with pea tendrils (straight from the farmer's market), baby artichokes and oven roasted tomatoes all topped with a light white truffle dressing.
i've never had pea tendrils before but they taste exactly like sugar snap peas.
amazingly sweet and crunchy.
a perfectly refreshing salad.

third course:
squid ink risotto with a pan seared scallop topped with uni and an organic egg yolk sauce.
the risotto was perfect, al dente and spread across the plate the way risotto should.
the scallop was cooked properly although i can't say it was the best i've ever had.
i think i prefer my scallop cooked slightly under.
the uni was fresh and that freaking sauce was out of this world!
my mouth is watering and my tummy is grumbling over the mere thought of this dish.
it's definitely on my ""best thing i ever ate"" list.

fourth course:
while the carnivores had the pork, chef marc kindly made the branzino for my picky ass.
if you know me, one of my biggest pet peeves is an overcooked fish.
i absolutely hate that!
chef marc's branzino was one of the most properly cooked pieces of fish i've ever had.
it was so tender, i hardly even needed to chew and the skin was wonderfully crispy.
served with oven roasted potatoes and beans, it was simplicity at its finest.

fifth course:
pear poached in red wine with vanilla gelato.
i'm a huge fan of cooked fruit!
unfortunately, i was unable to partake in this dish as i am deathly allergic to alcohol.
total bummer!
but, from what i could tell, everyone else rather enjoyed it.
it was quite a perfect end to a more than perfect meal.

chef marc's pastavino is truly las vegas' diamond in the rough.

There were moments where I forgot that I was at a restaurant.  There is a ""living room"" in the middle with sofas and a TV.

A ""mom & pop"" italian restaurant is hard to find in the west coast.  There's plenty in NY and Boston.  This is the first real italian restaurant that gave me a nostalgic feeling of the East Coast Italian Family Cooking.  The complimentary bread was amazing and I definitely took advantage of the complimentary part!  Chef Marc stopped by our table periodically to make some recommendations then to check how we were doing.  We even met his wife.   Superb customer service by everyone who worked there.

I went with a few friends:  I had the linguini fruitti di mar (seafood pasta in a red sauce), and my friends had the pork chops and veal parmigiano.  The service was nothing short of perfection, because I altered my dish by asking for this and that, e.g., I want chili peppers, fresh basil, etc.  What can I say? I'm demanding, and boy does Parma deliver!  I don't remember the name of our waiter, because he was very attentive and jovial. 

 My guests loved their dishes.  The friend who ordered the pork chop was impressed with how large the pork chops were.  It looked like it could feed a family of four, and he definitely licked his plate clean.  For my dish, I enjoyed it, but I would have liked to see more fish in my fruitti di mare, fewer mussels than clams (my dish was swimming in mussels), and more shrimp and calamari.  

Since I love seafood and always order seafood pasta wherever I go, I would say Parma's linguini fruitti di mare is worthy of 3.5 stars.

Overall, the food was very good, but the service was a little slow and it is a little pricey for what you get.  Basically, if you are fairly hungry you pretty much have to get an appetizer plus dinner because the entree sizes are kind of small.  I had the Bocatini, which is kind of a thick noodle, like a chow mein noodle, with like a pot roast type meat.  It was EXCELLENT.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and kind of chewy..it was awesome.  I also had a shrimp and white bean appetizer which was very good.  The house bread they gave us was tasty as well.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.  I also had the chocolate cake for dessert which was quite tasty, as it had a little layer of crunchy in it to go with the smooth cake.

Now, the food was excellent and we would definitely go back, but I can't give it 5 stars.  It took a fair amount of time for anyone to bring us menus, the food took quite a while to come out and overall the service was not bad, just really slow.  Also, $20 for a pretty small bowl of pasta is a little steep if you ask me.  As I said, the entrees are pretty small...I mean, without an appetizer you would definitely be hungry after just the pasta.  My little bowl of white beans and shrimp was $14, the pasta was $20 and the slice of cake was $7.  Not extreme by any means, but combined with the slow service and the relatively small portions, I take 1 star.

It was composed of artichoke hearts, walnuts, olives, arugula, Parmesan, and a vinaigrette. The miss was that we weren't given a serving utensil so it was hard to dish the salad onto our plates.

For our entrees we had the spinach manicotti and the truffle mac and cheese.

The spinach manicotti was a definite hit. It was my favorite food of the evening. It was good and cheesy. It was topped with a flavorful yet delicate sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Unfortunately the truffle mac and cheese was not nearly as good. It was too salty and watery. This was a miss.

We decided to finish our meal with homemade chocolate gelato. We asked for one to share. They served it in two small dishes. My wife's portion came out melted and looked more like chocolate pudding. Mine was solid so I gave her some of mine so she could eat (not just drink) some of the gelato. It was decent but a little grainy.

I'm a little torn on how many stars to give. The hits were really great but the misses tarnished the overall meal. I think I'll go with 3 stars.",wc4XAA5pC3b1UgooSypHwA,3,1,3,aRwsKctNoq3SrTMxVI7Pdg

The portabello mushroom app is very good and if you ADORE cheese, you will love it.  Our table had the eggplant parm and the veal scalp.  Eggplant was tasty, done w/out breadcrumbs which is my preference.  The veal was a thicker cut but perfectly tender and moist.

I texted PARM to 90210 and rec'd a free mini cannoli.  Perfect.  We could not decide between the rum and kahlua bundt cake so we had smaller slices of each.  Moist, losts of flavor done w/ glaze.  Our preference was the kahlua.

At Parma, they do the classics so wonderfully with many little subtleties that are left out of so many good Italian restaurants, but really set the dishes off.  To start their pasta is made in-house and you can certainly taste the the quality.  They continue to go the extra mile though...bringing in fresh peas at the end of the bolognese instead of cutting corners...adding balanced capers to the vegetable papardelle...preparing the chicken parmesan to order--creating a beautiful texture that is void at higher-end restaurants...dish after dish is special.

The Chef's Table is the true star at Parma!  It's a perfect value too at $50 / $70 with wine.  I have paid twice as much for equally enjoyable meals multiple times in Vegas!

2546461,2013-01-28,6,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"One of the best things about joining Yelp for me was finding Chef Marc again. Years ago, I was a regular at his previous restaurant, Marc's World Cuisine, and enjoyed many fantastic creations of his culinary genius (truffled lobster mashed potatoes, anyone?!) So, after friends convinced me that my career PR/writing + Yelp was a no brainier, signed on to find Marc (yay!) and realize I'd missed Nelson Q's Epic Mangia UYE (boo!)

Almost immedeately, the family went over and Marc (and several waiters) greeted us like old friends. Dad is Sicilian and a hard sell on Italian food, but Marc had him by the time bread and the antipasto --with Black Label Proscuitto di Parma -- was enthusiastically enjoyed. All pasta is house made and absolute perfection: since April I've had the chance to sample more than a dozen varities and the orchiette (little ears) from Mangia UYE/Nelson's Birthday in July stand out as do the Bishops's Hats from the same meal (and Tien's UYE Chef's Table/Pairing) for degree of difficulty and execution in making them light as air. Before I expound upon the wonders of Chef's Table, please note that though the regular menu changes daily, Marc will make just about anything you desire if he has the ingredients on hand. Dad loves his eggplant parmigiana, Mom is a big fan of Shrimp Scampi and he whips it up whenever they ask. Service and customer satisfaction matter here, big time. 

One of my dearest friends has lived all over the world (just moved backed to Vegas after an 8yr absence) as both an Air Force brat and wife, asked for my suggestion for the best spot to celebrate her husband making Lt Col? They came from their condo on the Strip and even though Marc was off, Ciro took amazing care of us. Before ordering appetizers. she threw down with ""I am an octopus snob, this better be good"" it was amazing (they marinate it before charring it perfectly) they are now regulars, too.


Leaving out Wednesday night Pizza would be a crime! This is the day Marc fires up the custom oven outside and makes authentic VPN pizza to order. Thin, charred crust Napoli Za arrives in 90 seconds: I suggest Margerita with post oven farm fresh egg and arugula; on the fly he created White with scungili and clams which I still dream about. Go early and make reservations: they sell out. 

Now, for the Chef's Table option: for $50 you get a five course meal chosen by Chef Marc (he will follow any dietary restrictions with notice) which brings his ingenuity and world travels together to come up with mind blowing dishes. Every possible effort is made to use local and Farmer's Market ingredients combined with his skill and imagination, you'd be hard pressed to find a meal this good at four times the price. At just $20 the wine pairing is also a steal for oenophiles and novices alike.  During the meal, Marc talks about his inspiration for each dish, the source of ingredients sharing with a passion that is contagious. 

The service is exceptional, I nominated them for Service & Server (my beloved Criztiano) in NPR's Desert Companion Magazine ""Best of Las Vegas Dining 2012"" issue, thrilled to share my near decade long experiences with fellow foodies. Marc's was also chosen Favorite Local Resaurant by one of their critics, and he was humbled by this honor; proudly showing Mom and I the plaque he received hanging on the wall. Criztiano remembers everything my family enjoys, down to an obscure canned eggplant appetizer included in their impressive imported deli/salumeria sections my Dad loves. Which brings me to the final reasons I love this place: the salumeria has fantastic imported charcuterie (the eponymous and beyond) and cheeses we order ahead for pickup to make holiday antipasto. Desserts are spot on: mini cannoli, Limoncello cake and the whipped cream/local honey/cannoli shell/berry delight he created for Nelson's last UYE are divine. 

Parma is a true food lovers gem: clean, fresh ingredients elevated by a master. Don't take my word for it: try it. They open at 10am daily and lunch is a good time and quieter than bustling dinner (suggest reservations) or sign up for a coveted seat at Nelson Q's Mangia UYE on 22 February. You'll be glad you did.

This isn't only my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, but my favorite restaurant of all time.  Chef Marc, is to me, a culinary god.  I feel so honored by his humility, because I think he could be a head chef at the worlds most finest restaurants, cooking for the most exclusive clientele.  But instead, he allows common people to experience the finest in food and drink.  Thank you Chef Marc.  

I highly recommend the chef's table.   Four courses with or without wine pairings. It is a bit more pricey than most can afford for a casual dinner, but if you want to impress a date, this will truly be a winner.  I took the g/f there for her birthday and it was a life changing experience....  No really....  Life changing!  Chef Marc creates a custom four course meal just for you.  Our custom menu included char grilled octopus with apple, carrot and celery.  At first we though it would be chewy, but it surprisingly was not at all.  It had the texture of a moist piece of chicken breast.  Delicious!!!  Next up was the gnocchi bolognese.  The gnocchi was incredible and the bolognese was amazing.  Our third corse was a dry aged rib eye, done el-chico style.  If I had to choose the final meal of my life, this would be it.  It was as they say in Hawaii, ""broke da mouth"" good.  Without question, the finest entree I have ever had...  That is no exaggeration.  The final course was a three parter, with rum cake, tiramisu  and cannoli.  I was so full, but I could not stop eating until all the food was gone.  

Thanks again Chef Marc.  I would also like to thank our server Tracy. He has always been so exceptionally kind to us whenever we go.

C'mon folks.  4.5 stars?  Lots of 5 star reviews?  Seriously?  Among the best Italian places in Las Vegas?  New York?  Italia?

Several reviewers mention comparison to Olive Garden, and compared to that chain restaurant disappointment, well, yes.  Parma is 5 stars.

Here's the truth.  Parma is a good neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The decor is simple.  Nothing fancy.  The service is semi-pro - mostly young, though energetic, fairly efficient and casual.  The kitchen puts out decent Italian dishes of good quality, especially the house made pastas. The overall experience is casual and family-worthy.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.

Here are some specific observations.  A dining companion wanted mussels as an appetizer, and they weren't on the menu.  Our server this evening, Kelly, says no problem.  The kitchen has them for Frutto Di Mare, so we can do that.  Nice job, Kelly.

Parma's Caesar salad is bland and forgettable.  Last night the romaine had lots of brown edges.  Meh.  There's nothing special on top like shaved Parmesan, and the croutons were one step above store bought.  No cracked pepper was offered upon serving, and there wasn't a mention of anchovies, a part of an authentic Caesar.

The good news is the pasta is terrific.  Nicely made and properly cooked.  Try the lobster ravioli.  Sauces are decent but I find the bolognese sauce is not a star.  

Marc's pork chop is amazing.  Thick and juicy.  You won't be disappointed.

Parma's wine list is short and is value minded, not over the top.  The wines by the glass list is not stellar with the exception of the Tobin James cab.  I recently ordered a bottle of the 2009 Bere ""Super Tuscan"".  The bottle arrived, opened and poured, and it was noticed that the wine was actually a 2011.  Rookie mistake.

The location in a strip shopping center should provide insight to the experience at Parma.  Casual, decent Italian fare, but not sophisticated or accomplished as some of the reviews here on Yelp suggest.

The interior put my concerns to rest.  They have both a restaurant seating area as well as a lounge with coffee tables for more casual eating.  The food was very good.  It was easily better than many meals offered at higher profile restaurants on the Strip.  We ordered the Chef's choice which was a five course meal selected by Chef Marc.  The Filet Mignon and the Octopus salad were amazing.  We had three visits from Marc during the meal which was nice.  The only downside to the visit was the quality of the desserts. We were given a cheesecake and a rum cake.  They were just average and not what I expected after such superb entrees.  I would definitely come here again.  As indicated in the other reviews here, service speed is not a priority here.  But then again, this is not fast food.  If I had three hungry young children to feed, I would not come here.

FOOD is GREAT. I love the mushroom with spinach and cream sauce appetizer. I wish I knew the recipe since this place is like 3 hours away from my place.
It is far from the Vegas strip. Restaurants in Vegas are overrated. I like this alot. Good service and nice ambience. I would not say it is romantic, but it is relaxing. It has that sort of friendly/family vibe. I like it.

This is a great, affordable, local place to eat in Vegas (not on the strip).  My family wanted Italian food and it seemed like there wasn't much on the strip that was highly rated that had entrees less than $30, so we came here.  We ended up coming a little before 5 so we had to order off the lunch menu (pasta and sandwiches).  I think they have more in the way of entrees available for dinner.  My husband had spaghetti and meatball, my father had a meatball sub and my mom & I split a chicken parmesan sandwich and the spinach and cheese manicotti.  Everybody was really pleased with their food.  The manicotti was especially amazing.  The pink basil sauce it came in was to die for.  We requested some garlic bread before the meal and it ended up being free.  The bread was amazing, very buttery and parmesan-y.  The portions were normal size, not monstrous American portions, so although we left full we did not have any leftovers.  The prices are a little higher than you might expect given the strip mall location and casual ambiance, but the food is well worth it and still a total deal compared to the strip.  Service was excellent as well.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a delicious, affordable meal in Vegas.",Wxd-EKF2Z4RHZUmwQ6Eeew,2,1,5,m3MkK15SqtG9FhoAOO6gLw

We had a bowl of  pasta fagioli soup that wasn't even warm, 8 bucks give me a break, the server nuked it  so it was all dryed up around the edges and  not evenly warmed  up, for that money it should have been right.  This place is legend in it's own mind.  The sandwich was just o.k.  The worst part about it is when I ordered 35.00 worth of cheeses and deli meats.  The prosciutto was sliced very thin I tested it before he continued to slice it ,  when I got home he had  piled it so it couldn't be seperated.  He knew nothing about slicing deli meats.  18.00 a lb.  The provolone was not sliced at all,  just a hunk. 15.00 a lb.  I have had better sliced meats at Smiths.  The one good thing about this place is the bread, it comes from Bunn Bakery.  They had nothing to do with it.

Lobster Bisque (4/5) Made from scratch and it was delicious. It's not 5/5 because the texture is not very creamy. 

Octopus Salad (5/5) For me, this was the best dish of the night. Grilled to perfection Octopus tentacles with a light citrus salad (green apples, celery and carrots). I can probably eat 2 or 3 servings of this salad. 

Spinach and Sausage Ravioli (4/5) It was good but it needs more sauce. The sauce also needs something else. It feels like it's missing something. 

Mushroom Parpadelle (4/5) Again, it was good but it's missing something. The pasta was cooked perfectly. 

Rum Cake (5/5) A good way to end the dinner. Very light, fluffy and just enough sweetness into it. I'll definitely order this again.

I ordered the Parma sandwich, as did a few others in the group. The meats and fixings were mighty tasty, but the bread left my jaw feeling like I had just gone a few rounds. Yo Adrian, my jaw hurts! The sandwich was ala carte. Not even a pickle on the side. I opted for a side salad to compliment my Parma. The waitress recommended a chopped salad. It was outstanding, however, I guess I missed the eight dollar price on the menu. Holy Cow. I left a little disappointed, with a sore jaw and twenty-two dollars lighter in the wallet.

The mozzarella was the real deal. 

Next we all had a different homemade pasta with wonderful sauces.  Three of us had the pomodoro sauce which was perfect and fresh.  One had the pomodoro and meatballs which again was perfect.

3516948,2012-12-14,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Parma is delicious!  We stopped in for dinner and had no idea what to expect. There was seating on either side of the restaurant and then some couches and tables in the middle. We chose to sit at a half booth/table. 

The meal started off with complimentary garlic bread. I could have been fine with just eating the bread! It was hot, soft and some of the best I have ever had. I let the server know that and I was given a loaf to go at the end of the meal!

They have a lunch and dinner menu. The dinner menu is basically salads, soups and pasta. The dishes range in price and the average pasta price was between $12-$18. There were some items on the menu that cost more. 

I was craving a sandwich and asked if they could make on even though it was the dinner menu.  The server checked and said I could order any of the cold sandwiched but not hot. That was perfect because I wanted a cold anyway. I ordered ""The Parma"". It had assorted imported Italian meats and cheeses. They have 2 sizes and I chose the smaller one and that was only $6.50! There was no masking the flavor this sandwich offered. The meat and cheeses had such wonderful taste. I will for sure order this again!

The inside was very clean and the service was excellent. We would only take a couple drinks of our soda and it was being refilled.

On Wednesday nights the server said they have pizza and only on that night. I'm going back to try that next!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,11,3,5,fVVqOyjiodOyN3j11xVv9g
3542858,2012-10-01,3,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This place deserves five stars.  Heres why:

1. Service. Some of the most outstanding personalized service i've ever received at a restaurant. Our server was there with helpful suggestions every time we turned around. He asked the right questions, too, like when we ordered the chefs tasting, he asked if we were allergic to anything or had dietary restrictions ( hubby does. Lots of them). He was not snooty at all and explained everything we wanted info on without pretention. Not only that but chef marc came by and personally asked if we liked the meal. The food was outstanding (more on this in a minute) but the service was even better. Hubby tipped like 40%. Other restaurants could learn a lesson or four from these guys. Servers get tipped according to service. Give excellent, above-and-beyond service, you'll get tipped very well, at least by us.

2. The FOOD! I come from philly, where good italian restaurants are on virtually every street corner, and where i grew up eating at church dinners where little old italian ladies slaved over hot stoves to feed armies of hungry parishioners every sunday afternoon. I may not be italian, but i know (and love) good, authentic italian food. This was the real deal. The fresh-baked bread was simultaneously crunchy & chewy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, AND sprinkled with fresh parmeasan. We ordered the chefs tasting meal, and it was catered just to us, and included a lovely capresi salad with fresh mozzarella, swordfish that was so tender i could hardly believe it on a bed of some sort of wild grains in a light lemon & capers sauce that was absolutely delectable, a pasta selection that was homemade with morrel mushrooms that were to die for, and the most light & fluffy tiramisu which was so good I coulve eaten another one, even though i was STUFFED. 

Julia child said ""freshness is essential. That makes all the difference ."". This is true of Parma. Ill also add that loving ones job makes all the difference. Bravo, chef marc! We love your food AND your restaurant.  Im a new, big, fan!

3. Price. For food this good you can't beat the price. We got the tasting, which was $50 each and the most expensive thing on the menu. There were several entrees under $20.  You could conceivably order two lower-priced entrees and get away with a $50 meal. Well worth every penny. 

4. Ambiance. It was homey, not pretentious, and much like the italian restaurants i grew up going to. There were kids there too, which i like, as i like a family restaurant where my kids are welcome. I liked the painting of sinatra i was seated near and kept looking at it. They could maybe use a nice mural though - i know some good people who do this if anyones reading this!

All in all a 5 star + experience. We will be back, and we'll bring people with us!",6ehZ3X1gaHe-fxzndNRweA,4,1,5,sYOg3GbA-3qCkdyhGFmmGQ

3552832,2014-11-27,1,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I came during a week day during lunch and parking was easy I was right up front.  Visiting this place I was a little skeptical.  It's part deli, part restaurant and part lounge?  When you enter there is a large couch seating area. on the inside wall there are Italian supplies and then there are dinning tables and another dinning section inside.  The front is for the cashier and a gelato fridge.  

I started with the white bean soup.  I'll be getting this on return visits, it had a great mix of flavors and the white bean and noodle went well together. I ordered the eggplant parmesan which was good too but was a little salty and came with a side of spaghetti which I did enjoy.  Overall, the food tasted good to me and I would like to try the dinner menu.  I saw them go to the microwave a lot so that did have me a little worried.  I think the night/weekend shifts are probably better and have fresher food than a Tuesday lunch.

The menu was limited on my visit to some sandwiches and a small selection of pastas among a couple other choices.  Looking online, I see a lot of dishes which are only available at night (mac and cheese and my absolute favorite Gnocchi).  I'll need to return to try them and if they are as good as it looks I'll edit my review.  I was hesitant to choose the spaghetti with Bolognese because some of the pictures I've seen online it didn't look like what I'm familiar with (a darker richer sauce, online it looks like just red spaghetti sauce and if it was what I got with my selection I wouldn't have liked it as my only dish item).  I would have liked a larger selection for lunch at least offer the signature dishes and being out of town it will be a challenge to revisit in the short term.",S35wtbj1kKgmmSBD5wLfuA,2,1,3,_yS4e7mtCn5E2hgHR2I_Wg

We stopped in for dinner recently and Chef Marc happened to be in the kitchen that night, and was bringing back some of his classic signature dishes.

Wifey went with her favorite Fazoletti Pasta and I decided to go with the Chicken Sinatra. We started off with a basket of cheesy garlic bread and Chef Marc was even nice enough to send out a demitasse of some tasty Gazpacho which was very tasty and refreshing. Our entrees arrive and believe me when I tell you that these entree portions are HUGE! I loved the flavors of the Chicken Sinatra which usually comes with pasta, but side orders of mashed potatoes and polenta were sent out instead, and I was absolutely STUFFED!

We ordered a Tiramisu to share, but our server Tracy delivered a ""dessert sampler"" instead! can you say FOOD COMA!?!? Always a great meal at Parma, and if you haven't been here yet, you don't know what you're seriously missing!  ALOHA!!!

Update: Went back the next night for freshly tossed, homemade woodfired pizza that they serve on Wednesdays. It was amazing. Fresh and perfectly cooked, tender dough with a crispy crust. And the limoncello cake for dessert.

3648607,2009-12-31,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I was in Las Vegas just before Christmas with my DH.  We had heard that Alfredo's of Rome, who had recently closed their Orlando location, was going to open in Planet Hollywood in 2009.  Well, it didn't happen.  No Alfredo's.  So I checked out yelp* to see what other Italian places there were in the neighborhood we were staying besides Buca da beppo.  Hmmmm, a place called Parma came up with a solid five stars from seven reviews, and it was right around the corner from us.  So, off we went.  We weren't terribly hungry and just ordered pasta - spaghetti carbonara for me and lasagna for my DH.  Water and bread with oil completed the deal.  What can I say?  The bread was top notch, and the pasta was heavenly.  I've been to Italy and have had a lot of spaghetti carbonara over there, this easily topped any I had ever tasted in Italy.  It might even be better than my [Italian] best friend's spaghetti carbonara.  Okay, it is better, but she can't know that.

Soooo, that leads us to our next experience.  Believe me, my DH and I are incredibly loyal when we find a place we like, so we were back just two nights later.  Walked in about 5:30pm with no reservations, not worried about getting seated.  Chef Marc himself came over and that was when we learned to our dismay that he was featuring a special Christmas Eve seafood menu.  It seemed like a bargain - a seven-course all seafood/fish meal for only $55.  Unfortunately, as I explained to the Chef, neither of us like seafood.  The odd fish dish maybe, but not an entire menu.  We were just going to quietly leave, no hard feelings, but Chef Marc could not have been more wonderful.  Rather than focusing on what he had planned to provide to customers that night, he immediately understood what our needs were.  He explained he could do a little something for us, some Caesar's salad, a couple of pasta dishes?  We smiled, we sat.  This time, I had some wine (whatever red they were serving that night was fabulous).  The Caesar's salad was top notch.  Not too heavy on the garlic, and the parmesan cheese was great.  I had the vegetarian pasta, and my DH had the spaghetti with sausage.  He is still raving about it.  He swears it is the best pasta he has ever had in his life.  Hands down.  So, between the two of us on two separate nights, easily the best of class.

For a treat we ordered the rum cake for dessert.  Ohhhhh yessss, it had been soaking for quite some time in Captain Morgan's finest.  

I'm trying to get over how sad it is that I am not in Las Vegas more frequently in order to dine at Parma whenever I want.  For now, my DH and I have to satisfy ourselves with memories of two fine meals and anticipation of our next visit.

The other two diners with me had similar dinning experiences and both (like me) have vowed to return to Parma.  One being a local that now lives only 2 miles away will be there quite often.  The other visits Vegas 5 to 6 times a year so she will be a regular as well.

Chef Marc was very personable and all of the staff did a great job of making us feel as if we were in a fine dining establishment and not a family style restaurant.  The only issue we had was that it was over 111 degrees outside at 7:00 PM,  and the staff did not offer us anything to drink while we waited for a table.

3726527,2014-05-05,4,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"One word - disappointing.

I've had take out before and enjoyed Chef Marc's previous restaurant but this was my first experience eating inside of Parma.  I'm really hoping it was an off night because the service needed improvement and I found Marc (who might be a good cook but I don't think is a chef) uhm.... how can I say this delicately?  Less than a gracious host?   I was pretty stunned because at his last place I was invited back into the kitchen and we talked a lot about food, etc. and his staff even ordered some wine glasses for me that my out of town friends remarked on so I thought I would make a gift of them. (and that's bending over backwards!)  The closest word I can use to my interaction would be ""demeaning"".  Sorry I'm not a guy or a hot 20-something year old female where you clearly are in your comfort zone.

It also annoyed the living daylights out of me that even though I said I was dining alone when I came in, when I finally flagged someone down to try and get some food I was told ""Oh, I thought you were waiting for someone"".  I'm often out and about and get hungry and just stop somewhere, dining partner or not, and haven't waited more than a few minutes to be asked if I would like to order or if I'm waiting for someone.  (Which would be the logical question if the person who seated me didn't communicate with the person who would be taking my order)

I had to get up and steal silverware from a table twice for myself and once for the couple sitting next to me.  Staff needs to pay attention to the details more.

FOOD REVIEW:

Wine:  Sampled a red.  Pretty sure it was corked.  (or remarkably bad!)  Went with sparkling.  It was OK.

No hard liquor... or if there was I sure didn't see it!

Caesar salad - flavorless.  I asked if they had any anchovies in the kitchen and was told no.  I'm not sure how you actually make a Caesar without anchovies but that explains part of the reason it had not flavor.

Escargot:  Except a bit of grit in the very first bite... quite outstanding.  If you order these do not eat bread first because they do not come in the shell but rather on top of toasted Bread.

Bread:  really good.

Gnocchi:  Lovely light, fluffly pillows of joy but the sauce which was described as white wine cream sauce should have been described as creamy garlic sauce.  It's an Italian place so garlic should be expected but it was far too much for my liking.  I couldn't  taste the peas which I thought was a lovely combination with spec and gnocchi.  Overall sweetness was a bit much.  I would have cut the garlic and added blue cheese.

Cannoli :   Respectable.

Everyone seems to rave about this place and I think it's because it's fundamentally good food albeit inconsistent.  Professional or home grown good food is good food.   However, they need to work on the service and level of knowledge on both food and wine.   It was a Saturday night and should have been packed and was less than half full.  With all the great reviews that shouldn't be the case.


SUMMARY:   Meh.  There's lots of great food in Vegas.  Dining experience is important and it just wasn't a hit for me.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,15,4,2,RmEfMDFa81H7VVgEzBVJ9w

The place is cozy and clean, it's a small and simple menu, but the main point for me is that they make the food good.  They certainly filled that job by making it great with that home cooking taste, but in a passionate and special way.

We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by Chef Marc himself at the door.  The place was packed and he offered to have us dine at the sofas in the middle of the restaurant.....we politely declined as we prefer a regular table.  We told him we'd prefer to have a glass of wine while we waited for our table.....we're patient.  My Wife told him that we came here to have his Portobello Mushroom & Organic Spinach appetizer (one of our favorites from the old joint)....he said he'd check to see if he could make it.

While we waited, we had a glass of Sangiovese wine....it was pretty good....don't remember any other piece of info as it was suggested by Chef Marc and we ordered based on his recommendation.

After a 10 minute wait, we were seated....not too bad for not having reservations.  While I perused the menu, I noticed that the Portobello Mushroom appetizer wasn't on there....I wondered if we would get it.  I ordered a Bufalo Mozzarella Caprese Salad to start with Sweet Potato Gnocchi w/Gorgonzola Cream Sauce for an entree.....the Better Half ordered the Escargot Appetizer for her meal counting on the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer to show up.

We were pleasantly surprised to see the Portobello Mushroom Appetizer show up.....it was one of our favorite dishes from his old joint and here it was!  It was just as good as we remembered!  The sauce was rich and creamy and the Organic Spinach was fresh and went well with the entire dish.  A few minutes later the Bufalo Caprese Salad arrived....it was a large portion that could have easily been split between 2 people.  The Mozzarella & Tomatoes were fresh and it was A-1 Grade Goodness!

For a second glass of wine we ordered a glass of Zinfandel...don't remember the vintage or vineyard.

The entrees showed up and I was eager to try the Gnocchi.....it didn't disappoint!  The sweet flavor of the Sweet Potato went perfectly with the Gorgonzola Cream Sauce....I was in Heaven!  Wifey enjoyed her Escargot.....we couldn't believe it was only $9!

Overall, we had an awesome time.

3881908,2013-02-16,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Chef Marc's consistently exceeds the 5 star mark!  I had a stellar lunch here a few months back and BF had been wanting to try Chef Marc's for dinner because he had read a yelp about the Chef's Table menu.  I had worried about the dinner atmosphere and being rushed because the place isn't overly large.  I gladly admit that I couldn't have been more wrong.  We arrived a couple minutes early for our Saturday night dinner reservation and were immediately seated.  This place was hopping, so reservations are recommended.  To our delight Diane, our delightful star server from our previous visit was working!

We brought a special bottle of wine that we had been waiting to enjoy for quite a while.  They only charge a $10 corkage fee and welcome you to bring your own if you wish.  

Alright now here's where it gets really good!  Enter the four course Chef's Table menu; it's not a menu per say, as it's 100% unique to every customer's palate.  It's more of a concept.  When we told our server that we wanted to try the the Chef's Table she asked us for our preferences, food allergies, etc. Chef Marc takes this info and hand picks 4 courses meant to please your taste buds.  At $50pp with optional $20 wine pairings, it's such a steal.  It's nothing like many strip restaurants where 4 courses = 4 bites.  This is the highest quality food with generous portions.  If you already know that you want to try the Chef's Table, go ahead and let them know when you make your reservation to save some time, otherwise it takes a little longer than ordering from the regular menu.

First course we were treated to a seared octopus salad with green apples, carrots, celery, and chickpeas.  This was my favorite dish of the night.  The octopus had been marinated, which made it extremely tender and completely infused with flavor.  Since we brought our own wine, we didn't opt to do the parings.  They are so thoughtful that brought us a small glass of Chenin blanc to have with the octopus, as the wine we brought wasn't ideal with this dish.

Second course we enjoyed pappardelle pasta with olive oil, sauteed mushrooms, and thick generous chunks of prosciutto.  If I had this to do over, I might have saved half of my pasta to bring home, because it is extra filling.

Third course entrees - #1 was grouper with ratatouille and broccolini.  #2 Veal saltimbocca.  Both were delicious!

Fourth course was rum cake, choc cake with raspberry sauce, the most delicious canoli ever, and fresh strawberries and blackberries.  Per our request they happily prepared it in a to go box for us.  

This is a wonderful date spot that I can't recommend enough.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating and the food is absolute perfection.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,3,0,5,zCrX17VsxPEGclplVV3Cag

I say that because the reviews for this restaurant are almost unanimously excellent. But that's just not the reality.

It's not that the food is bad. It's not bad at all. It's just not outstanding. There's nothing amazing about this place. It's small and cramped and the menu is miniscule,
In fact, everything about Parma Pastavino is small, except the prices. 
My linguine frutti de mare was fine; with fresh clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp...but for $28? Hello?

(By the way: if you check the online menu, the prices are about 35% higher when you get to the actual restaurant:...nice bait and switch Chef Marc!)

Those kind of prices are comparable to Ferraro's...but there it's actually worth it, being a more beautiful and informed restaurant.

And another of my pet peeves: how can any self-respecting restaurant not invest in a reverse osmosis water filtration system for their tap  water. Everyone knows that vegas water is some of the worst in the nation! 
And I'm not just talking about the water in your glass...don't forget that they use the same water to cook the pasta, rice and anything else that's boiled.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,15,6,2,cPCYYYI-wMq81jO2SpM9dA

Sure it's a little out of the way but it's totally worth it. I've been here 3 times and every time my boyfriend and I split an order of the gnocchi. I've had the chicken parm and a few other chicken dishes - all cooked to perfection! 

*Side tip. If there are a few things you want to try why not split it? Every meal I've gotten they've allowed us to split. 

I was going to knock them down a peg for the last meal I had there. We wanted lasagna but was told it was unavailable. Oddly enough their 'deconstructed' lasagna dish was available. It was messy to eat and came out cold. 

BUT this review's saving grace is the consistent service and relaxed atmosphere. Servers are always quick with water and bread. Ask them a question about a dish and they usually know the answer and then some. Tables are spaced nicely. You can relax on the couch with a glass of wine or push tables together to accommodate a party of 8.

I thought the chef had finally figured out that if you offer stingy portions, even if the food is good, that people catch on.  We had gone to the old Marc's only one time many years ago and  had a similar experience to what we had tonight.  Large glass, little wine, large plates, tiny portions.  My husband and I are always on the lookout for good Italian restaurants and a few friends had recommended that we go to Parma.  Neighborhood restaurants come and go very quickly in Las Vegas and many places that we had frequented had closed due to either the economy or poor management.  We were very excited to find that Parma was just what we were looking for; a good neighborhood feel, great service, good food and generous portions at a reasonable price.  It was becoming more and more popular and the restaurant had expanded their space and added 10-12 more tables.  Yay for them and us!  A few weeks back, when there on a Saturday night, we noticed things had changed....$3 for additional bread, a charge for sharing, even a salad and  smaller portions of wine but the food was the same.  Tonight though?  I ordered the agnolotti stuffed with various meats and served with a sage butter sauce.  Sounded great.  The place was crowded and we felt as if we were getting the bum's rush since we hadn't even finished our salads before our entrees came.  The chef accompanied our server to the table, leaned over and said (obviously for our benefit) ""i think it was good to increase the portion size to 15...it's a lot more generous."", in reference to my agnolotti.  Really?  You couldn't have said that in the back?   It appeared to be so staged!  I guess I was supposed to feel VERY LUCKY to be paying only $19 for 15 agnolotti.  By my calculations, that's about $1.25 per piece. I, too, make my own pasta...it's not that big of a deal!  To add insult to injury, both my husband's cavetelli and my dinner were delivered in those  ginormous bowls  that only hold about 1 1/2 cups of food. I'm still hungry! His portion was small as well.  Our server must have picked up on my irritation and before I had a chance to voice my displeasure over being made to feel that I had the privilege of being stiffed, he sent another server over to close out our bill.  Word to Chef Marc....keep it up and this restaurant will close, too.",LmnAHSSqqCLkYWdFihtXTQ,2,0,1,l0ALAabGCU8DSZXzX1z5YQ
3967313,2013-07-28,4,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I was at Parma once before to enjoy one of Nelson Q.'s UYE with Chef Marc.  This time my wife and I came after a dance program for an early dinner.  In fact, we arrived just before 5 PM as they were setting things up for the evening's dinner service.  Tracy, our server, seated us and then went to get menus, dishes, and silverware.  While he was gone, Chef Marc came over and discussed the offerings for the night's menu.

By the time Tracy came back with the menus, I already knew what I was having but my wife needed time to decide.  We ordered a house salad to share.  The salad had an oil and vinegar dressing and it had a dollop of fresh ricotta to enjoy. I got the salmon special which was a beautiful piece of salmon seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly.  The salmon was on a bed of garlic spinach and some homemade pappardelle dyed with cuttlefish ink.  Excellent pasta, too.  My wife got chicken marsala that came with a side of rigatoni with red sauce.  She enjoyed it and I tasted the sauce and it was quite flavorful

For desert, I asked Tracy about the size of the chocolate mousse cake and he said it was large and easily shared.  I was somewhat crestfallen because I wanted to enjoy one of the wonderful cannoli I had when I was here for the UYE.  I told Tracy I'd order some cannoli to take home if the cake didn't fill me up.  When he brought our cake, there was one of their small versions of cannoli as a complimentary treat--proof that you can have your cake and cannoli, too!  It was very much appreciated!

Tracy was an excellent server.  Chef Marc is passionate about his food and he's a joy to talk to.  I'm looking forward to our next UYE here so I can have another of his 5 course special meals he designs for the Yelp group.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,11,10,5,iirwbhhF6pfSgOy70CTfBQ

For the evening we shared an escargot appetizer and pasta fagioli.  Escargot was heavenly and not garlic or salty heavy.  The pasta fagioli tasted very homemade and nice in this chill weather.  My main entree was the Atlanic Swordfish, which I will hold to a very high standard.  Every fisherman knows (or in my case, every television viewer of Deadliest Catch) knows that the prime season for catching and nom nom nom Swordfish is September and October.  What a fatty treat!  The fish was firm and fatty, just the exact way the fish should be without losing any of it's rich features in preparing it for a meal.

The food is excellent, but I thought the portions were a bit small for the price. 

I ate here with my wife, daughter, and son-in-law. I was tempted to order the spaghetti and meatballs but then noticed that the menu said ""spaghetti and meatball"" (singular), so I passed it up; my SIL had it, though, and sure enough, there was just one single solitary meatball (not even a terribly large one) sitting on top of his spaghetti. He said it was very good, but nonetheless I would expect more for $12. I had the meatball sub ($6.25 for a regular order) which was also quite tasty, but which only seemed to contain maybe two meatballs (they were sliced, so I don't know for sure). My wife and daughter split the chicken parmegian sandwich and spinach/cheese manicotti; they were both very impressed, though the bite I had of my wife's chicken sandwich didn't wow me (but then I always prefer meat to chicken). I don't mean to suggest that the portions were inadequate; there was certainly enough for a meal, but I just didn't think we got as much as I would expect for the price.

One nice feature was the garlic bread I asked for, which was very good, and for which we weren't charged, but that may be because our pasta dishes were supposed to come with bread, and this may have been that. It was not terribly garlick-y, but it did have a nice buttery texture and had crumbled parmesan cheese on it.

I looked to Yelp for guidance on which are the best dishes to select etc. and was surprised to see that the last few yelpers gave Parma such low ratings. We decided to venture in despite these reviews and were quite happily surprised. 

The interior is casual .. very similar to Roma's Deli but is inviting and bright. The venue was half full and the bread is everything that fellow yelpers have described. Yummy, warm, with the delicious fresh olive oil and a nice portion of parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. We polished off two baskets! 

The menu is quite small (and different from what is pubished online) .. but, you can also create your own dish by ordering off the chalkboard specials list which includes a number of homemade pastas etc. 

We ordered the Beet salad and the Parma salad. Both were presented nicely and tasty and the Parma was a very very generous portion. That seriously could have been my meal! Fresh arugula, nuts, olives and a nice light dressing. I would def go back for that. For the mains we did the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and Pappardelle Bolognese and both were great. The Bolognese sauce was chock full of carrots, peas and nice pieces of sausage and was really good!

For dessert the Tiramisu .. this was the only thing we ordered that was ""just okay"" .. there was a large amount of cinnamon sprinkled on top, which was quite overpowering.

Chef Marc's is definitely not one of those places where you leave hungry, BUT the quality of the food is top notch as well as the service. I left Chef Marc's full, but maybe we should start back at the beginning. 

It was a busy Saturday night and they had large parties in so they were unable to accommodate us until 8pm, which was fine since we had a late lunch. Walking inside you realize that its a small, but cozy place. There's an area with couches that you can hang out with your friends and drink wine and eat good food. 

We were seated right away and Chef Marc came up and introduced himself. He told us about the menu and the specials of the evening. The one that caught my attention was the ""boooofalo mozzarella"", mussels and the uni fettuccine. They were out of uni so that was a no go. 

We decided to start with the Buffalo Mozzarella. It was delicious! The mozzarella was unlike any other mozzarella (creamy as Chef Marc had described it). The tomatoes were paired perfectly with the cheese. I'm not a tomato person usually, but these tomatoes were pretty dang awesome. The table next to us had ordered the Antipasto salad, so that sold me too. It was a huge heaping portion of awesomeness. I was already a bit stuffed after all that, but I couldn't resist trying the Veal Loin Strip and the Papperdelle Bolognese. The veal caught my eye, but I should remember from now on that I've never had veal that blew me out of this world. The veal was good and paired with kale, but it definitely was not my favorite. I guess not everything can be my favorite. The Papperdelle Bolognese was my favorite though. YUMMY freshly made pasta with yummy meaty tuscan style sauce. I could eat those noodles over and over again. Yum! Chef Marc came by after our meal and asked us how everything was. Our server (sorry he was overpowered by Chef Marc) was very attentive also. 

With a meal like this we had to have dessert.....one cannoli please. My fiancé had asked about the rum cake and the server was kind enough to give us a complimentary slice. Cannoli filling was delicious! The shell they don't make in house, I thought it was still delicious, but the fiancé thought it should be a tad bit crispier. Rum cake, maybe not my cup of tea but it was still good. 

Do I love Chef Marcs? Yes....service was awesome, food was great and I left full. For everything that we ordered plus tip, it was a 100 dollars well spent.  I can't wait to be back and ready to try other things. BTW they can ""course"" out the pasta and ""protein"" dish if you decide to go the way we did, so that each person can have their own individual plate.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,9,8,5,kgUSa0NwUvtXnraWETeCUw
4234258,2011-07-09,1,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Is it.. I'm pretty sure.. Yea. It's love. I've been here twice in the past week, and I'm meeting up with them tomorrow at the Tivoli Village Farmers Market.

It all started with the antipasto.. hot capicola, peppercorn flecked mortadella, calabrese and genoa salami sliced paper thin, the best pepperoni I've ever set taste buds on, tavern style ham, provolone cheese, and the proscuitto... best. Ever. In the middle is a green salad dressed simply with balsamic and olive oil, topped with garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. This plate.. which is huge.. is only $14 (for two people, addl $4 p/p after). Paired with the amazing hot bread they serve brushed with garlic oil and parmesan, I wish I could make a meal out of this alone. I say wish, because it's just not that easy here. When Chef Marcus comes over to explain the specials.. you're in for the long haul.

Their Pappardelle with Bolognese is quite possibly the most comforting food I've ever eaten. It tastes like a hug. Or your favorite sweater on a cold day, if your favorite sweater was perfectly al dente. Perfectly toothsome, all the pasta here is homemade, and the sauce was thick and rich, you could see bits of carrot and peas.

The escargot was tender, garlicky, lemony, not gritty, but very very salty. Whoever was making it that night certainly had a heavy had with the salt but it did not deter me from using the crostinis they serve with it to soak up some of that sauce. I love salt. The menu described this dish as having truffle oil in it, but the only earthy notes I got were from the escargot itself.

The charred octopus.. wow! I didn't know octopus could be this tender. It was almost like a scallop. Chef Marcus cooks the tentacles in wine and beer for almost three hours before finishing it in the oven to give it that slight char. The cabbage slaw on the bottom is very acidic (lemon) and it a nice contrast to the soft sweetness of the octopus. This is served with sliced apple and celery.

The uni with linguine (special) was delicious, and a unique offering here in Vegas. The sauce is creamy with red chili flakes and shaved garlic. The taste of the uni was perfect and fresh, like clean ocean water, and there was a lot of uni in this which just melted in your mouth. The only complaint on this was that the garlic was a little burnt and lent a bitterness to an otherwise perfect dish.

If you haven't been here yet, you should make it a point to go soon. I've only been here for dinner, but would love to try their lunch offerings.  Their menu changes often on the chef's whim. The deli case is always impressive and they also have some Italian dry goods for sale, as well as homemade pastas to take home.

Wednesday nights ~5:30pm-9:00pm is pizza night and they do neopolitan style thin crust pizzas. They're also at Tivoli Village on Saturdays selling their homemade pastas and amazing parmesano reggiano (best I've found in Vegas) until 1pm.",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,3,1,5,P5xr4CZjt6_KXshpNCLBKA

Im a huge fan of their fresh pasta selection as well as their deli choices. Their Italian market is also a key factor with my liking of this place. Its not overly abundant with products, but it seems to have enough to cover your needs if you're in need of traditional italian products.

The food here is great too. I cant compliment the meat lasagna enough. Delicious! The various other meals I've had have been good too for the price. Service is wonderful, food is great, and prices are fair.",dKitWq6oQ4t_UyUHWMbzzw,1,1,5,HBjpymGx1XCaGLUnFwf_pw

I'm going to agree with my friend, Stefany V, that this rates 3 Stars.

A former client, took me to dinner here, trying to pick my brain for free advice.

The place is very casual, and the food is just ""okay"".  

My former client is somewhat of a wine expert, and they did seem to have a good selection. He was pleased consuming a bottle of wine, and I did not drink, because I was driving. 

The service is friendly, but nothing more than acceptable, not great. 

On his reccomendation, I had a chicken scalopini, which was medicore at best. He had one of their pasta dishes, which I sampled and would not suggest.

This looks to me like a decent place to eat pizza and maybe Italian sandwiches. 

If you don't feel like getting dressed up, waiting for a table, and willing to settle for mediocre food, this is your place to go. 

I serious doubt I will return. My client got the bargain; almost two hours of professional advice for the price of a cheap dinner.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,1,0,3,DgHR_8GMsAINelCKW4mDCg

I've tried the mushroom agnoletti, the pasta fagioli (make sure to get a large, it isthat good), buccatini and papardelle bolognese. The papardelle is the bomb! It is on my top ten list of favorite dished in this city. Marc's food is as authentic as it gets in this city, he understands the mediterranean concept of simplicity. In Italy, the food is very simple, five ingredients max in a dish. If you use the best quality ingredients, you don't need anything else.

The only reason I give it four stars, and really it is 4.7 is becaue of the service. I never encounter great service. And I know for a fact that they treat others better because I've seen it. They prefer an older, more sophisticated clientele. I don't know if Summerlin housewives really qualify, but whatever.

The decor inside is intimate and different. There are couches in the middle if you prefer to eat your meal there. The tables are spread around the couch area and the deli is up front. It's not unusual to see cans of Italian ingredients on shelves around you. The restaurant decor has real character and the food is pretty tasty too! 

My husband and I started off with the House Salad. It had organic greens, ricotta cheese, pieces of pear and balsamic dressing. The ricotta has a light sweet taste to it. This is the best ricotta I've ever tasted was so soft that it was easy to mix it into my salad. The ingredients all complimented one another and tasted fabulous! 

I ordered the Truffle Mac and Cheese dinner. I've had this dish before at Smith & Wollenskys so I knew the taste I was looking for unfortunately I didn't find it. The Mac and Cheese here is a bit bland. 

My husband ordered the Parpadelle with Spicy Sausage. It came with thick home made noodles . I tasted some of his dish and it was really good! He finished everything on the plate! 

We finished with dessert I had the Lemon Cello cake which was huge! I had to take half of it home. It was yummy! My husband had the Rum Cake which he finished too fast that I didn't have time to take a picture of it. I had a small piece and I thought that was also delightful but the portion is small compared to my cake. We enjoyed Cafe Mocha with our dessert which was very relaxing.

Throughout my visits I've had the chance to try the antipasto salad, the Parma sandwich, the fried meatballs, spinach manicotti, and a salmon dish special they had one night.  Out of all of these the manicotti stands out as being my favorite dish, though I'm thinking you really can't go wrong with any of the food.  But seriously, try the manicotti.  All the ingredients are crafted together to create these tasty dishes, so be sure to enjoy their garlic bread while they prepare your meal.

On all my visits, with the exception of one, the service has been excellent.  They are attentive and have absolutely no problem going through the menu with you item by item.  On almost every visit, at least one of my friends was unsure of what to get.  The server then goes into interview mode and asks what the person likes and dislikes, leading to a satisfying dish selection.  

As for the one exception for excellent service: During one of my last visits, I spoke with Chef Marc and told him how I recommend this place to anyone seeking Italian, and complimented him on his staff's attention to customers and quality of food.  That very night, my order was botched.  I had ordred their salmon dinner special for the night, but somehow the waiter thought I ordered the veal parmesan.

We were asked if this was our first time, and it was, so Chef Marc came and introduced the menu to us.  He boosted today's specials, especially the sea urchin pasta and the grouper.  He also suggested that we pick a ""green"", a pasta and something ""protein"" and split everything between the bf and I.  That's what we did. 

Green - escarole.  To me, it was good, but it wasn't spectacular; probably because I do not have too much experience in escarole.  The bf liked it, and I liked it enough. 

Sea urchin pasta - YUMMY!  I have never had sea urchin pasta before, and it was delicious!  The squid ink homemade spaghetti was so tasty and tasted ""oceanic"" in a good way.  The sea urchin was fresh and it was perfectly tossed into the pasta.  I say tossed because it was the perfect temperature from the heat of the pasta and not cooked down.  I could have eaten the entire dish by myself and intend to upon my next visit!

We picked the chicken for our protein.  It was a huge plate of chicken that was enough to feed three!  The chicken was bedded with polenta, and it was the perfect combination.  We had as much as we can but had to pack the rest home.  

As for dessert, we had the rum cake, and it was pretty good.  Not too sweet and not too ""rummy"", which was a small problem for the bf.

Don't let the casual ambience fool you, when you first walk in it appears cafe or deli-like.  
You're immediately greeted by friendly staff and presented menus and wine list.  The menu has basic Italian apps and entrees plus items like scallops octopus.  Wines by the glass had a pretty good selection, I settled on the Tobin James ""Notorious"" cab.
The charred octopus as an app was cooked nicely and, slightly charred on the outside and tender inside.  Sea scallops with polenta cooked to perfection with a decadent sauce.
Ordered the Chicken Sinatra which was off an old menu and Chef was more the accolades get when we asked if he could make it.  It was delicious, tender chicken pounded thin covered with a cheese and a Marsala-like sauce with mushrooms and peppers.
Also had the Gnocchi and they were PERFECTLY cooked, soft tasty and FRESH.  The sauce was a tasty light marinara with little surprise bites of pancetta.

What topped dinner off was Chef Marc himself takes the time to walk his dining room floor and speak to his diners.  He was personable and friendly and asked how we enjoyed dinner.

The reviews were too good to miss and a cross town trip of nearly 20 miles was insufficient deterrent to share a meal with a new friend.  The service was enthusiastic, friendly and charming.  A Prosecco split kicked things off, followed by a split Parma salad that was more than sufficient for an opening round.  My dining partner was keeping it light with pasta fagioli and I opted for linguine with clams and white wine.  A white Veneto accompanied most appropriately.

All I can say is ""amazingly satisfying"".  There's an art to keeping it simple,  unpretentious and Parma pulls it off like a clean apron.  I only wish I lived closer.

The deli section demands a return trip - Percorino, salami - the works.

4934402,2013-09-06,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This is a lunch review, so please bear in mind that they have a lunch menu that is different than the dinner menu!

I was having a lunch meeting today on the West side and as my office is on the East side, original plan was to go middle to PF Chang... Hmmm I said, let me see what I can cook up as a  unique dining experience vs. high end Panda Express....

Thankfully, a bunch of yelpers have recommended Parma and after reading Rod U's review and everyone's review, I was ready to rock and roll!

First thing of course I discovered is that the menu for dinner which most reviewers discussed is not same as dinner.  Here are my thoughts.

a.  Location - 4 star - Not bad considering I don't venture in this area.  Easy to get to right off the Summerlin Pkwy Buffalo Drive exit.  Plenty of parking in a nondescript strip mall.

b.  Ambiance - 4 star - When I first walked in, it felt more like a deli compared to a restaurant like Nora's or something, but it was both funky and cool at same time. Reminded me of a coffee shop, a deli, a cafe, and a small restaurant all in one.

c.  Service - I will say this is 5+ star.  Very friendly, very knowledgeable and very accommodating. They know their stuff and what the kitchen can do, so it makes it very cool to talk about the menu. 

d.  Menu - 4 star - their lunch menu features a few salads, antipasta, home made pasta, sandwiches both hot and cold, some soups.  I was so eager to try some of the yelping good ideas that I asked our waiter about what specials.  He quickly said that they can whip up some Linguine with Clams and / or Shrimp far diavolo.  We ordered this and some side salads.

e.  Food - 5 star - The best thing started when I said, hey since both the pastas are not on the lunch menu, we will try it and can we split it.  Quickly the waiter said that since one was a red sauce and one was white, that it would not mix well and so when we said how about the spaghetti bolognese, he said PERFECT.  I have to say, the waiter, Mark I think handled this just right! Both dishes were fantastic.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and a bit smaller diameter compared to normal spaghetti pasta. I liked the texture and the feel when you were stuffing it all in your mouth.  It had the COMFY feeling!!!  The side salads were recommended and they were the right size and had just a bit of spiciness and it was perfect.

f. Je ne sais quoi - 5 star +++ - This place has that ""je ne sais quoi"" , that ""I don't know what"" factor. It is the confidence in the kitchen, the knowledge of the staff, the coolness of funky ambiance of the restaurant, the home made pasta.  I am not sure but all of this combined makes for a most awesome experience!

I will be coming back for lunch as it is so cool and relaxing.  I am also excited to come fo dinner with my wife as she loves Italian inspired food and so I cannot wait to try the dinner menu.

GK says, if you are around for lunch, check this place out!",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,7,7,5,pQBeDMpCWIWUJsIqzrZWGg

This little gem of a restaurant is nothing short of perfection.

An authentic and oh so very fresh (they make their own pasta!) Italian cuisine where every dish comes with a personal touch.

Service is wonderful and very personable (see Pam, she's great and treats you like you've always been a part of her Italian family).

They don't lie either --their Antipasto salad is and I quote ""the BEST. ANYWHERE"".  Order a small because their meaning of small is LARGE :) 

Pasta is exquisite (try the Baked Pasta Fazoletti) and top off your meal with wine from their wonderful selection (try a bottle from the Sinatra Family or their Moscato D'Asti-Risata) and couple it with the ever so delicious dessert-- TIRAMISU and Cannoli ---it'll make you salivate for days and you feel like you've died and gone to food heaven.

The atmosphere is great--it makes you feel like you've walked into the home of Chef Marc himself to enjoy one of the best Italian meals ever.  They even have the option to take home some of their home made fresh pasta to use for your own cooking pleasure.

5048501,2012-03-18,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I finally came here to eat dinner with the family. Didn't know why we waited so long honestly. We since then come back a few times and even brought family from Ca and most recently, our family from the Netherlands. 

Everything is fresh, and pastas are made by hand here. The menus change based on what is seasonal and I highly appreciate that. Don't worry though, all the favorites aren't on the menu they hand you but on the chalk boards on the wall. They can make you just about anything you desire of the classics. 

This is what we've had (so far) : 

Antipasto Salad - very plentiful with greens, olives, slices of cheese and charcuterie. The different salamis were delicious and you can tell were quality. Standard dish, but good as far as salad goes. 

Lasagna - My MILs favorite thing. First time it was good and very heavy on the ricotta, this recent time they touted that it was a new style, a Tuscan style without the ricotta, layers of meaty saucy goodness and the MIL swooned over it. I took a bite and it was fantastic. 

Bolognese- have had a few times and prefer pappardelle noodles. This is one of the best bologneses I've had. This has been ordered several times and is the group favorite. 

Red sauces- Go for Sunday sauce if you like a nice rich tasting red sauce. Marinara here is solidly bright and bold flavored if you don't want a meaty sauce. If you like sausages or meatballs with that, theirs are good. I'm a sausage person myself, but grandma likes the meatballs. 

BF and I tried a seasonal, Snapper with uni hollandaise, pea risotto and broccolini. The fish was fresh and cooked nicely, and the flavors of everything with it was in harmony and not overpowering the snapper. We are risotto freaks and cook it properly at home. Pea risotto it was overcooked, but still good flavors. 

Some of our guests had other things like the sweet potato ""bishops hats"" in brown butter, the puttanesca, etc and all reported back positively. 

Desserts- had the cannolis which are quite solid and I am very picky about them. Kalhua cake is buttery and tasty. Tiramisu is standard, but solid and not overly soaked. Chocolate cake was nice. Pizelles aren't made in house I dont think but offer it at the deli case and they were good if you like the sweeter vanilla kind. MIL and I both prefer the anise flavored ones. 

They start out any meal with some hot from the oven bread with garlic, butter and herbs on it! Definitely very good! My in laws aren't a fan of the olive oil/balsamic dip you make your self from jars at the table so ask for butter if you're like them.

Service here is always very good. We get the same waiter everytime and he does such a good job of explaining the dishes, specials and answering our questions. While sometimes its been slow because it was very busy, it is always courteous and not for their lack of trying to be everyone at once. We don't mind waiting for good food when it comes from a place that feels like home. 

Of course, we have taken home cheese, pasta, and sauces from the deli and the prices are great for the quality. Pastas are around $4.50 a lb. depending on the kind, raviolis and gnocchi types I believe are around $9 a lb. I cannot remember the sauce prices, but I will update next time. 

LOVE this place. I cannot recommend this spot enough. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in town. I don't throw that statement around lightly.

We were excited because we hadn't been there for awhile and had bragged about how great the food was. Well we got a totally different experience. We went inside and only 2 other tables were there, but it took the waitress over 10 minutes to give us our bread basket and drinks. When we ordered dinner, I had ordered the red snapper. I took one bite and it was NOT fresh. The taste was awful. We never send food back, but did because it was inedible. We let the waitress know and proceeded to look at the menu to order something different when the owner Marc came to our table with a raw red snapper. He told us that the fish was fresh and had just came in. I politely told him that our fish did not taste fresh, but very fishy. He walked away while I was in mid-sentence. My problem wasn't so much about the food, but how we were treated.  Rather than coming over to our table and apologizing and seeing if we were interested in something else, the owner was defensive and insinuated that we were lying about the food. We spent over $100.00 on lunch and I didn't even eat! For that reason I am giving the place a 1star and won't be back there again. It's a shame.",vf0wSbY2y2qlh5apqkKjnA,0,0,1,_ZCPZPpQngOdLx3RXS6ptQ

Papardelle Bolognese - sheets of perfectly cooked hand made pasta drowned in a thick, meaty, sweet and acidic Bolognese drizzled with olive oil.
Me:  ""What a waste of really good pasta. It's drowned in sauce"".
Them:  ""This is great.  Lots of meat"".

Shrimp Fra Diavolo - Large, sweet, properly cooked shrimp with a spicy aribata sauce on pasta with broccolini.
Me:  ""Why are these on the same plate?  Primi, secondi, and contorno served together?""
Them:  ""Everything taste so good together""

Fiori di zucca (Tuscan classic, batter coated, deep fried zucchini flowers) with marinara sauce?  
Me:  ""What the?  Marinara sauce?  It's supposed to be served plain so you can taste the sweet, vegetal flower and enjoy the richness of the oil and crunch of the coating"".
Them:  ""Man, these are so good.  The more sauce the better"".

Authentic Italian? No way!  What's wrong with calling it Italian STYLE cuisine?  Don't misunderstand, I think the food is excellent. Market driven menu that constantly evolves.  Outstanding Italian inspired sandwiches.  The Bologna with a great imported mortadella, provolone and drizzle of red wine vinaigrette that brings out the sweetness of the mortadella and milkiness of the cheese; Excellent.  The Campania  with fresh mozzarella, fire roasted peppers, pesto, basil, fresh tomato, and a balsamic vinaigrette; a vegetarian's delight.

5095278,2013-06-21,1,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"This was my first time at this restaurant and I chose to go here because I'd seen it on an episode of Food Network's Mystery Diners.  It's definitely got an interesting vibe to it, being part deli, part lounge and part restaurant.  The waiting/lounge area consists of several easy chairs and couches where you can peruse the menu at a comfortable pace before being seated.  The meal started out with the typical Italian dinner fare of garlic bread with oil.  The bread is made fresh and was absolutely AMAZING!!  Of the four different meals my group ordered, all of them were excellent!  Again, everything's made fresh that day or fresh as of the time your order was placed.  The Chicken Riggies (what I had) was an awesome blend of peppers, chicken, mushrooms and marinara.  The Chicken Parmesan (what my wife had) was fantastic and HUGE.  The chicken breasts where both easily the size of one of my hands!  We came towards the end of the business day and were given a loaf of bread to take home since they will make the bread fresh the next day.  It was awesome, even a couple of days later!  Chef Marc stopped by and chatted for a bit about his visits to Wisconsin where I live.  I even got a picture with him due to his ""celebrity"" status.

5139317,2012-12-23,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Ok, came back to give it another shot.  I am VERY glad I did!

Started off with charred octopus and the escargot with truffle butter .  

The octopus was very tender and had lots of flavor, nice burnt edges, adding great texture and flavor.  The escargot was super tender and packed with flavor, and the bread that was soaked in the butter and sauce was amazing, but the dry edges of the bread were a little hard and distracting.

For dinner we went with the U10 sea scallops with squid ink, and the shrimp fra diavolo.  The scallops were buttery tender, great flavor, and the squid ink was a nice secret ingredient....weird, but worked well!  There were four of them, and all were excellent.  Just eat some breath mints afterwards lol.

But the real winner here for the night was the Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  I LOVE spicy food....I have never heard of this dish!  This dish was AMAZING.  There was so much flavor packed in every bite, I wish there was more broccoli on the plate.  Why?  Because the little broccoli are saturated with all the goodness of the plate, and hide tons of it inside their leaves.  Explosions in your mouth....seriously!  Garlic, oil, herbs, everything...nice!

And to finish, we went with an almond chocolate mousse.  Super light and ""fluffy"" insides, this dessert packed tons of chocolate flavor in each bite.

So is it all perfect here?  Food wise, absolutely.  Completely different experience than the last....in a good way.

But I got the same server as last time.  My service was slow again, wine going dry the whole night for more than 5min+ at a time, I waited to be asked for dessert after my plates were pulled, for over 10min.  After my dessert plate was pulled, I was given my check almost 15min later.  Good thing I was not in a hurry to be anywhere.  Nice guy, but not what one looks for in a server...sorry.

But even this server could not ruin our night.  The food was exceptional, and I WILL be back again....although I will be requesting another server next time around.",eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A,1,0,5,nEGqE9C6Ap3QN9mrh3n5IA

When food was delivered it was just put down while they were looking elsewhere, just plunked down and turned and walked away. Also for a party of 3, two of us were served first, the third several minutes later, both for salad and entree. Other patrons had to ask for water and bread.

Described as a traditional Italian Trattoria reflecting the culinary vision of New York born Chef Marc, Parma is one of those places that nearly every Las Vegas local sites as a reason for tourists to venture off strip - a simple, fun, relaxed place with remarkable food and equally impressive service but without the high prices intrinsic to the celebrity chefs on Las Vegas Blvd; it was a place I'd always wanted to visit but one not exactly easy to get to until this visit when I possessed a car and ample time to explore.  Large in size primarily due to the presence of the retail store and deli but with ample seating for guests in both the dining room and small lounge I was greeted first by the man who would serve as my waiter and then by a manager who seemed to know every other patron in the restaurant, both inquiring as to whether it was my first visit and offering suggestions regarding the menu - some accepted and some discarded in order to focus on items I knew to suit my fancy, each and every one a lesson in rustic Italian cooking with top quality ingredients, great depth of flavor, and ample portion.  Beginning first with hot garlic bread paired with olive oil and balsamic before progressing to an even more garlicky plate featuring eight tender snails on crusty bread with rich sauce I was shocked when the next two plates proved to be even better, one a 'salad' of crisp spinach topped with tender portabellas baked in parmesan cheese sauce and the other a pile of dainty potato gnocchi resting in smoky pork cream brightened up by fresh double shucked peas.  With each plate undoubtedly heavy yet finely balanced with no ingredient unnecessary or overwhelming the others it was with a touch of sadness that I realized I only had room for one dessert but deferring the tiramisu and strawberry cake for a later date I do not regret my decision to order the baba one bit, two slices of boozy rum cake lightly sweetened with confectioners' sugar and a ripe strawberry the only garnish necessary...plus a cannoli filled a la minute on the house, as though I needed further food or reason to return in the near future.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,5,dFVYFbxt324iBKmkFsF31Q

Can I make sea urchin with squid ink pasta? Nope.
Am I going to order that even if I'm nervous? Yep.
Was it an enjoyable experience? YES.

Chef Marc comes to your table and tells you the special like it's a spell of enchantment. You can hear the passion and reverence. How can your dinner-mate NOT order the rock fish? And you can't resist the siren call of uni. 

Save the classics for lunch time. When you're out on a date, get what's special and unique. Have fun, be adventurous. You can trust the chef here.

I had the Campania (a cold sandwich with mozzarella, balsamic vinegar, basil, tomatoes) - pretty much a caprese salad in sandwich form.  It was as good as a caprese salad sandwich can get.  The ingredients they used were fresh. I also got the Baked Pasta Fazoletti (parpadelle with ground beef, ricotta, mozzarella and marinara) and it was delish. Pasta was cooked al dente.

My next favorite is any kind of ""fresh"" fish they have in a Mediterranean red sauce, full of mussels, clams, etc.  If you want MEAT, go for the steak el chico.  Spicy, but good.
A new creation ""Barbershop Chicken"" is awesome comfort food!  Also spicy with loads of peppers, chunks of spicy sausage and of course, organic chicken.  Way too much food, but I love leftovers!",YnQNGG0R5_a2XdXEgEpSIA,3,1,5,Cgo9SMuhfLx97PrbYXJTRQ

The restaurant is very casual and has some really nice couch seating as well as tables. The service here is excellent and the restaurant is fairly small. If you go more than once, they will definitely remember your name.

Everything on this menu is just as good as the food I had in Italy. Trust me on this, I have spent way too much time in Italy. Chef Marc actually takes groups of people to Italy on a cooking experience. 

Anyhoo back to the food. If you go here, just let Chef Marc make you whatever he wants. He will ask you some dietary questions and then get to work. The food he sends out will make you think you are in Italy. It will actually blow your mind. You won't believe you are sitting in a strip mall next to Trader Joe's.

The service was efficient but not at all overbearing and Chef Marc was in the dining room talking to friends and newcomers alike.

The flavors of the sweet squash, tender homemade pasta and rich toasted sauce came together so nicely.  My mom had the pork chop, which isn't something either of us would usually consider ordering at a restaurant.  It was devine!  The thickest pork chop I've ever seen with a heavenly golden crust, cooked just perfectly.  The sauce was seasoned just right for her (1) with the option of spicing it up on a scale of 1-4.

5372725,2012-02-27,4,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"By far one of the best places to grace Las Vegas in a long time. I know that many people talk about the chefs on the Strip, but I purposely avoided that route for my friends bachelor party. At first, people were complaining about how we had to detour from the row of lights to go to dinner, but they quickly shut up after we began our gastronomical journey. 

Any special occasion can only be made better with a visit to Chef Marc's Parma. I was lucky enough to tag along with some Yelpers and have been hooked on this restaurant ever since. Call in advance and specify that you want to participate in a chef's table. For $50, a five course meal is a steal. An additional $20 more, there is an option for wine pairing. With a week notice, chef will be able to set up a marvelous spread. Long gone are the days where a chef tries to fill you up on bread and cheap ingredients. Chef even got upset that someone had given us bread. 

I had specified that one friend was allergic to pine nuts and melon. Another to pineapple, almonds, and does not eat pork. Chef said no problem and I was relieved. 

This was my second chance to experience a meal from this creative genius. He started us off with some sliced prosciutto before our first course. We were in for a real treat when we found out that chef brought out the pizza oven on a Sunday night. Not only did we get a classic margherita but a walnut pesto pizza as well. This was a creative way around our friend's allergy. Then the second course came at us with no warning. A sampler platter of perfectly grilled octopus, shrimp, sausage, and red snapper surrounding a bed of apple salad tossed in a citrus dressing. Already, some were ready to admit that the drive was worth it. Now slowing down, Chef came out again to explain what he had in store for us. Two words: LOBSTER RAVIOLIS! That was our pasta course. The al dente stuffed goodness was filled with the crustacean and came with a marscapone cream sauce. For many, it could have ended here and we would have received a meal worthy of $50. An Italian meal without a protein? Unheard of. Stepping outside of the box to provide us with a truly unique experience, we were presented with Veal Cheek served on polenta with German red cabbage. The meat was so tender that you could cut it with a fork. The sauce was similar to an Osso Bucco sauce. Each component complimented each other so well. By this time we were all stuffed. Yet it did not end there. For dessert, chef sent out a french toast served with fresh bananas and berries topped with a Marsala wine sauce. Ambrosial! Still not enough? The groom to be and I had opted for the wine pairing. I had attended a wine tasting some time ago and came across a beautiful dessert wine that I had nearly forgot about until I took a sip here. Although our waiter prefaced that the wine didn't go with the dessert, I was happy to taste the Donald Ziraldo dessert wine again. 

At this point, I could not hold it in any longer and had to gloat. BOOYAH! All of the skeptics could eat it, because this meal was sensational.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,8,6,5,Q_od4OxIH5Uk1NNz__dQXQ
5390398,2013-10-18,16,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"What's good enough for Nic Cage is good enough for me.

Have been here twice now, both for lunch.   First time I got take out and did the Parma cold sandwich without cheese.   The guy helping me seemed a little preoccupied during the ordering process, and particularly when I was trying to get my iced tea I'd ordered.   A few minutes later I finally realized why he seemed to be brushing me aside (that's a strong way to put it, he was still friendly).   Nic Cage and his wife and son (presumably) were dining at one of the tables nearby.   Now there was a large part of me that wanted to be the annoying fan and run over and ask for him to do a scene of Bad Lieutenant from Port of Call (youtube this immediately if you're unaware).   Since his wife and kid were with him, I figured that might not be the best idea, so I settled for a scene from the Wicker Man instead.   Okay so I really just sat and did nothing and waited for my food.   When I ate it later at my office, I was greatly impressed.  A plethora of olives, pepperocinis and various italian meats.  I marked it as reason #41 why I will never go to a Subway by choice again and awaited my next opportunity to strike.

Well that came yesterday, when I brought a co-worker with me for a sit down lunch.   I was dead set to try a pasta so I could have a more well rounded Yelp Review (I do it all for you guys).   Unfortunately while looking through the menu I couldn't shake the pics of the italian beef sandwich I'd seen in the pics section on this site.  I asked our extremely friendly and efficient waitress which I should get, the italian beef or the rigatoni and she said she hadn't had the rigatoni but the italian beef is amazing.   I mean she didn't even upsell me the extra $1.75 for the pasta.   Sorry Yelp, but the well rounded review will have to wait.  

To go all 17 year old snapchatter on you:   OMG at this sandwich!!! :) :) :)     Just unbelievably stuffed full of juicy beef, pepperocini and with a healthy serving of lusciously melted cheese.   Then with a big bowl of au jus to dip it in.   I'm used to au jus from lesser quality restaurants being very thin and not extremely flavorful.   Not here.   Thick with beef flavor, because what you really need when shoving your mouth full of 2 pounds of beef on a sandwich is more beef flavor.    And you know what?  That's not all.  I'm pretty sure the bread was garlic bread.   In fact, I'm sure of it because the rest of the day my mouth couldn't shake that garlic flavor and flowers wilted when I breathed on them.    A+

Refills on the iced tea came at a fast pace, and I even inconvenienced our poor waitress by asking for one to go, as well as by signing the wrong receipt on a 50/50 split check because I'm a massive idiot.  She took it all in stride.

I promise, next time I'll try the pasta (and get a creepshot of Nic Cage)",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,21,18,5,98c4zllZ4fwHAwueaP5ZEQ

Food - Had the Parma Sandwich.  Tip - Have it hot.  It is great.  If you get the large, there is enough to share with someone else.  When Hot, the meats have more flavor and give a great juxtaposition to the cold lettuce, tomato and onion.

Service - There were only 3 tables and two servers but yet I had to interrupt their conversation with each other to get some more soda.  I know it was New Year's day when we went, but you are either open or not.

I felt that I was imposing on their personal time.  Left a tip, but did not feel it was worth it at all.

I think from now on, will do take out.  Such a shame as they have just expanded their dining area.

Went back about a week later and the service was not the same.  IT WAS WORSE!!!.  The Parma Sandwich did not have the olive spread on it and it seemed to be missing some other things as well.  Too bad as when the food is done right, it is great.",hAZEee0Q7APAcerRQ4Ze3g,5,0,2,_CcewvJd0itFynBq8Tokuw

This is a similar concept to Roma's deli, but with a more personal touch.  They have a variety of seating options.  In the center there are lounge style couches and coffee tables, bistro/cafe area seating, and a more formal dining room.  We liked the bistro area since it seemed more lively and the noise masked the crying of my baby nephew.  Also the the UW vs UCLA game was playing...it was the fiances bday as well so it was only fair to let him watch football while eating :) As soon as we were seated the servers brought water and bread, and then Chef Marc comes to the table and goes over the menu specials and even goes into an explanation of their prep.  Very nice touch, truly makes every diner feel like they are a VIP.  The servers were always attentive and the water glass was never went empty.

Now onto the food.  We ordered the portobello mushroom appetizer and the charred octopus.  The portobello mushroom appetizer was deceiving, while not the prettiest plating....the flavor combo was UH..MAZING!! My sister in law didn't realize they were mushrooms, she thought there was meat in the dish.  The mushrooms are sliced thin in a cheesy gorgonzola alfredo sauce topped with crisp organic spinach.  It was so good we cleaned the plate off.  The charred octopus was cooked to perfection with an granny apple/celery/chickpea slaw.  Even the bread that is complimentary is delicious with a Parmesan garlic topping.  On to the entrees, I ordered the chicken marsala but also tried the ahi bolognese.  The marsala sauce is probably the best I've ever had with marsala wine making almost a gravy that was great for dipping bread.  The ahi bolognese was the special for the night and they took the sushi grade ahi, ground it up and cooked it lightly and added it to thin spaghetti.  Pure genius! Since there was a birthday in the party, I got to sample the fiances free cannoli and it had a great pastry shell with delicious filling and was topped with fruit and chocolate chips.  Who can pass up a good cannoli?

We walk in and see the chalkboard menus and there's a little store and lounge area. They have some oldie music playing and  have some nice artwork. Really like the vibe when you walk in. We take a seat and our waitress comes by and gets our drink orders. Apparently I think they print the menu everyday or something because there was at least one fish item that was crossed off. It must have been a hit. The waitress can tell you how everything is made what their favorite dishes are. I love when the chef takes time to explain so waiters/waitresses can give info to first time customers.

I order the Papardelle Bolognese, my friend orders Eggplant Parmesan, and her boyfriend orders something Riggies. They start us off with some fresh bread omg it was so good we had two little loafs before our food arrived. It was so good we couldn't say no. The food comes out and the smell is sooo amazing. I loved the bolognese sauce. The papardelle is prepared perfectly! The flavors of everything comes together. My friend had the eggplant and that was so yummy. She is picky about her eggplant parm and this is the first place other then one other place in Vegas that does the eggplant parm how she likes it. Her boyfriend got his spicy so I didn't try( I know I wimped out lol). He loved it and my friend said it was really good.

OK so after the food we take a look at the desserts and decide we have just enough room in our belly's for it. I get the Tiramisu,my friend gets the chocolate mousse cake, and her boyfriend gets the cannoli. OMG dessert heaven! The tiramisu was so good with just the right amount of sweetness. The chocolate mousse cake is the chocolate lovers best friend. Different layers of chocolate gets my mouth watering. The cannoli was really good also. My friend said it's his favorite cannoli he has had in a long time.

I enjoyed tasting the artichoke hearts & sliced salami which were lightly covered with red wine vinaigrette dressing.

It was like a ciabatta and baguette coupled and had offspring.  It was light, crispy, flavorful but with plenty of body!  It came with a side of aus jus- the ausjus was like an action hero in my opinion.  It was the Superman of dipping sauces.  I had some left in the little dish when I was done, so I asked the waiter for a spoon!

The sandwich wasn't a true true Italian beef - I don't think the meat was roasted there but it was of good quality.  The sandwich was like a French onion soup Italian beef sandwich!!!  It was everything I love in a sandwich and more...

Great service, nice and clean - Bravo.  The prices are on the high side for basically a deli, I paid $22 for the sandwich, canoli, coffee and tip.  Eventhough, I am cheap** and I do not like spending $22 on lunch - I left plenty happy!

Anywho, that could be overcome if your food is great and your restaurant enjoyable.  Chef marc's failed on both counts.  Thickly and heavily sauces gummy pastas and an un-fun room made me wished I'd stayed home and enjoyed superior food.

This is THE place for older folks who get off on knowing ""the chef"", trying to impress friends and dates by having ""the chef"" come over to their table and pretend like he's their best friend.",xymN6nkSGPL4A2D3C2DuaQ,7,5,2,njW0BWn-ZUlz205i1Fjg1Q

5663513,2013-01-20,0,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"I found Parma on Yelp because we were looking for a new Italian place to try.  It was a drive for us from the east side to the west but based on the reviews we decided to give it a try.  It was easy to find and the lot was full.  As we opened the door we were met by this 6' 5"" or so guy who just shouted out ""do you have a reservation?""  that kind of put us off as we did not and not even a welcome to parma, how are you this evening,  nothing.  He said I can put you over here and just sat us at a table, no menus!  a couple minutes later a long came some fantastic bread and finally a waiter who asked if we had menues.  By this time we were thinking we made a big mistake, but the place was full, no empty tables.  During the course of the next 20 minutes or so we watched at least 4 groups of 2 -5 walk in the door and out the door because they had no reservations.  This place could use more tables and getting rid of all the sofas and chairs in the middle of the dining room would be a great help.  We never seen anyone use them.  What a waste of space and the loss of customers and revenue.  Since the tables are so close to each other we seemed to be joined in the conversations from tables on both sides of us.  All anyone could say was this was the best food in town and we come here every week and so on.  We ordered, wine, Antipasto plate - which was huge and full of meats, cheese, olives, tomatoe and salad and enough for the 3 of us.  We had the piatta, the parmigano and the parpadelle and were just amazed at how great this food was.  It had to be the best Italian meal I have ever had outside of a couple trips to the italian hillsides.  We can not wait to come back to this great little gem.  The host needs to loosed up and smile and be more personable to customers and they need to clear the way of those sofas for about a dozen more table or so.  Had it not been for the host and the slow service at the beginning I would have rated this a 5 star and maybe after our next visit I will.  The table next to us asked to see the owner and was told he had just opened a new Pizza Restaurant, We did not get the name but look forward to trying it next.
You just cant go wrong here, the 3 of us with wine the antipasto and 3 entrees came to $101 before the tip.  P.S.  they just dont stop bringing you this wounderful bread.

5688644,2010-02-21,3,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Heard about this place and thought I'd give it a shot. Upon pulling up to the restaurant it looked kinda cheap like a Fazzoli's but as soon as I walked in, the atmosphere quickly changed my mind. It was a deli with a sense of an intimate ambiance, kind of a contradiction but that's what I was feeling. Nice lounge in the middle with tables set up on the sides and deli meat and fresh pasta at the counter.

The service was a 10. I believe I was approached, seated and served by a Pamela. She seemed to be one of the only ones working but let me tell you she sure worked that room and did what she could. I could only go for lunch and had that spaghetti Bolognese which was amazing, right amount of pasta to meat, with the pasta achieving that perfect al dente touch. Also had the chopped salad that had red vinegar dressing, tomatoes, salami, blue cheese, and some other items and I have to say that tasted very fresh. My only complaint was the meatball sub. I heard it was supposed to be the best there but when I received it, it was cold and I don't mean sitting at pickup for 30 minutes luke warm cold or cold like they had just pulled out of the refrigerator cold. But more like I made it this morning and 4 hours later here you have it cold. Kinda weird because the pasta was hot and we got there at 11 and the place opens at 10 (so how old was this sub?) Ah well, outside of the meatball sub, this place was an unexpected pleasant surprise and I will be back.

2nd visit
Came back because they initially had good service and I thought I'd give them a chance to make up for that cold meatball sub. Well, somehow they managed to go from on the verge of being great to now being subpar. We didn't get the charm of Pamela, this time our order was taken by a bald guy who wrote down the wrong order and then made our 2nd order to go even though the first order was for here and on plates. (But hey I guess things happen so whatever.) This time we ordered the carbonara and this lasagna type dish with sausage and red sauce that was good at first bite but after the next several I felt like I had greasy tomato soup. It was moderately busy in there so I understand what it's like when restaurants are at full capacity but it wasn't even close. Ah well, I think two times is enough for me and it's on to the next Italian spot.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,3,1,2,eLRshXM2gHhIYejAQN1RcQ

It is quite disappointing however every time I go in there I see Chef Mark is walking around the restaurant rather than in the back cooking maybe hence that is part of the problem!!! I believe you get what you pay for however in this case I feel they have now become overpriced for a poor quality of Italian food as well as very small portions!!! I would recommend they get some new servers as well as new items on the menu or give you at least a fair portion for the price they are charging...

5736736,2013-04-07,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"My husband and I decided to make the drive to Parma last night for dinner. I was really in the mood for some fresh pasta and with their awesome reviews, we figured it had to be good. We were not disappointed! We called ahead to make a reservation and when we got there they didn't have a table, but they seated us on a couch in their lounge. The host was extremely friendly and talked to us about the menu while we waited. They also brought out bread and water, which was incredibly thoughtful.We were seated at a table a few minutes after hanging out in the lounge. 

The complimentary bread is delicious and topped with fresh parmesan cheese. They have olive oil and balsamic on the table if you would like to create a dip, which of course we did. We decided to start with the house salad and were incredibly happy that we did. It has a light oil dressing, apple strips, nuts, and a mound of fresh ricotta. The ricotta is so silky smooth and rich. Everything worked well together and the fresh pepper they added to the top really made the flavors sing. I moved on to the sausage and spinach ravioli with Sunday sauce. They were stunning! I received the perfect size portion, about 6, and cleaned my plate with a little help from my husband. The sausage flavor was prominent, but you could still taste the spinach, cheese, and incredible sauce. My husband had the pappardelle bolognese and it did not disappoint. The meat sauce was delicious and there were carrots and peas mixed in as well. The pasta was delicate but cooked to a perfect al dente so it didn't fall apart. 

Not only was the food amazing, but the service was great too. We really felt like we were part of the family. I also love that they have a deli counter with all sorts of Italian delights. In addition, they sell their fresh pastas and sauces so you can make a delicious dinner very easily at home. A restaurant serving this caliper of food could easily be stuffy and formal, but the lounge and deli counter really bring it back down to earth.

It was a winning find for us, so much so that we booked a second visit for Sunday.  I loved the casual feel of the center section with couches available for a glass of wine. Our server Diane was friendly, knowledgeable and generous-thank you.  
Starter- great garlic bread, perfectly toasted and seasoned. The wine is reasonably priced and well selected. We enjoyed a bottle of Friulano- Bastianich.
Appetizers- Pasta Fagioli-homemade, my husband loved it.  Parma  salad - huge amount of arugula, olives, walnuts, Parmesan cheese, mushrooms, artichokes and lightly dressed, just right. 
Entrees- Gnocchi in a light cream with Speck, unbelievable.  It was like going to heaven and coming back to tell about it.  Jumbo Shrimps Fra Diavlo with homemade  spaghetti.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, just the right amount of kick, and the shrimps were cooked perfectly. 
By now we are beyond stuffed and Diane brings out prosciutto & provolone cheese.  
Delicious but we took that home along with an extra order of fresh mozzarella.
Now for dessert.  An order of lemon ricotta cheesecake, not traditional but good. To finish of us off, Diane brought out a mini cannoli and a piece of rum cake - they were outstanding.

We searched Yelp and this restaurant had the best rating in the area so we decided to check it out (thanks fellow Yelpers!). Plus the name sounded a tad familiar...Food Network?

I am so glad we dined here. All of the pastas are made from scratch -- from penne, rigatoni, spaghetti, elbow, linguini and more. I went with the rigatoni & pink sauce and added a grilled chicken breast ($12). My take? The sauce tantalized my taste buds, the rigatoni was amazing and perfectly al dente. I only wish the portion size was bigger because I polished it off quickly. The chicken was a touch overcooked and they took it back without me even saying a peep. My boyfriend opted for the chicken parm sandwich (large - $12.95). His take on the sandwich? Those were no little, over breaded chicken fingers slapped on a hoagie. Oh no, this was a hand pounded, full chicken breast, topped with mozzarella cheese & marinara sauce all sandwiched between two down right delicious pieces of garlic bread. He wouldn't stop raving about it. The whole menu is a smorgasbord of Italian delights. We want to go back and try dinner service!

When we mentioned to our server that we had never been there before, he brought us out another complimentary (dinner sized) dish just for us to try! We were blown away. The pappardelle noodles in this 3rd dish were SOO good...they were light and perfectly cooked. I would definitely order that the next time we dine in. We were so impressed with the customer service of our server, Mike. This small gesture will make us repeat customers. Bravo! Mike also informed us that if we texted ""Parma"" to 90210 we would receive two free cannoli's. Man, were they tasty! Love those little chocolate chips :) We could barely walk out by the end of lunch. lol.

The restaurant also has a full deli service counter where you can take home fresh prosciutto or a pound of mozzarella. They have take-out as well so you can come pick up a sandwich on the fly. They also have a mini store in the front where they sell noodles, sauces, peppers and more.

5837385,2014-09-13,2,dWrezcuIAO-Ckx1W0gu5jg,"Another round of MANGIA! with Chef Marc in the Steppin' Out series (Round 5), another great Italian food-inspired meal at Chef Marc's now expanded rustic Parma by Chef Marc ristorante.

FIRST COURSE: As a first course, those partaking of Chef Marc's fine Chef's Table presentation were treated to a Deconstructed Caprese Salad with Buffalo Mozzarella and Tomato Pulp that had been freed of all acid, plated atop first-rate Balsamic Vinegar.  Green flecks that tasted like faint Pesto were also on the plate.  This concoction was very tasty, including the best Buffalo Mozzarella I have experienced to date.  Chef Marc imparted that this cheese was derived from water buffalo cow inhabiting the environs of Naples.

SECOND COURSE: For a second course, we were presented with two very large platters of New York Style Hot Antipasto for every 3 diners, so that, try as we might, some of this delectable food was left behind.  We got to sample Eggplant rolled up like a burrito or Chinese Eggroll but not deep-fried; lovely Clams filled with Oregano, Parsley, and Bread Crumbs to become Clam Oreganata; naked Calamari; Mussels filled with Artichoke Hearts; and some Green Peppers and cut mushrooms spread throughout the hot platters like accent marks unifying all elements of this sumptuous and quite filling appetizer.  Would that Western Style Antipasto plates were this tasty and refined!

Also complementing this dish was excellent cheese-topped and crusty bread and butter.  But, alas, Chef Marc directed his servers to remove the bread soon after the repast began, lest we fill up too much on it.

THIRD COURSE: For the next course, we were treated to a very hot and nuanced Spinach & Walnut Risotto with flakes of Mascarpone Cheese circling 'round the rim of the bowl.  This rich offering was quite flavorful without any single component overpowering the others.

FOURTH COURSE: As a main course, set down before us was a bowl of rich, delicious, and fork-tender Slow-braised Neapolitan Veal Cheek, along with German-style Red Cabbage made with Brown Sugar and Red Wine Vinegar, and subtly flavored Polenta.  The star of this assemblage was the Veal Cheek, which tasted much like well-prepared Osso Buco.  And, Chef Marc confirmed that this entree did actually come from the cheeks of young calves.  

FIFTH COURSE:  As a fifth and final course, we were treated to a dessert plate with slices of Green Apple, honey in a small pouring bowl, Blueberries, and somewhat springy planks of solid Parmesan Cheese that Chef Marc referred to as ""diving boards.""  These elements were to be assembled and joined together according to our personal whims.  I found that dabs of honey acted like glue when Blueberries were pressed into them on top of a plank of cheese, and the conglomeration was further sweetened by adding a honey-soaked slice of apple into the mouth when chewing.  This sweet and cheesy dish was my least favorite course, but I appreciated the simplicity and inventiveness of the dish.  Everything else I thought was both creative and a foodie's delight. 

Throughout the meal, Chef Marc or one of his assistants provided a running commentary of each course just before it was served, and patiently answered all diners' questions.  This added to the enjoyment of the experience, although in previous MANGIA! rounds Chef Marc did all the narration himself, which I liked better.

Most of our group of about 17 diners experienced the Chef's Table (some with wine pairings), but a few, like Diane, ordered ala carte.  And, she was quite pleased with the two quite large and lean scallops of Veal Parmesan Alfredo and Penne Alfredo with which she was presented.  Half of the order served as a fine lunch the next day.

Nelson and Sylvia Q. presented all diners with a vial of sand from different beaches in Hawaii, and did another great job in organizing this event.  Props to them for hosting, and to Chef Marc and his staff for preparing and serving, yet another outstanding MANGIA! dining extravaganza!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,4,4,5,XAW6SYgzvjjl4lW1PfsMEw

Was not a busy night in there but they asked to take a seat while they could get a table ready, not a dirty table in sight.  Also it seemed as if they couldn't figure out who would seat us.

Quickly dropped of our water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink.  Getting the bread took quite a bit longer and it was extremely hot on the crust and cold in the middle.  Seemed like it was taken out of the fridge and thrown into a broiler or oven for a minute.

We had a salad and a cup of soup, decent enough but $12 for a beet salad seem a few dollars high.  We had been finished with those for at least 10 minutes before they came around to collect the empty dishes we had put to the side of our table.

I didn't time it, but it seemed that it took another 20+ minutes to get our entrees, chicken piccata and lasagna.  Again it was not a busy night, maybe four other groups of people in there.  Not explanation as to what took so long, but alas our food arrived.  I had the chicken piccata, and that and veal piccata are on of my favorite dishes and this was probably the worst I have had.  The entire meal, chicken and side vegetables were floating in an extremely bland flavorless sauce.  What few capers came with the dish were the only thing that provided any flavor other than plain, cooked chicken.

All in all in was an experience that will not make me want to return.  Our server seemed very bored and wasn't capable of clearing more than two plates at a time.

For $80 after tip with no cocktails, I would expect a better meal/dining experience than this.  Not sure how they won the best pasta award, unless I was there on an off night, but I won't be back any time soon to have them prove me wrong.",FKzFdEF3UjkGJOm4LZkx2w,0,0,2,qZaWRDdJZUTWHjWyT4mpQw

Beet salad  - average.  Could've used more sprinkled cheese and the dressing tasted store bought.  

Charred octopus - great. Julienne apple and cucumber salad with chickpeas was a nice accompaniment. 

They change the homemade pasta daily;  what I had tonight might not be offered tomorrow night or even next week. 

Gnocchi with ham in a cream sauce with sweet peas - came out of the kitchen without peas. Not a big deal, the chef fixed it for me right away. The softest gnocchi I ever have in my life, very tasty and heavy.  

Cavatelli Bolognese - traditional meat sauce,  great flavor. 

Bread was served hot - first baskets free, $1.50 each additional.  

1 glass of wine and the 4 selections above came out to $85. Not for the wallet minded.  

I like the decor. Chef and an Italian deli feel were both present.  

It was good food but quite far from my house; I really wouldn't go out of my way again to return.  Thats how I know my 3 stars are fair, Id travel far for Amazing food!! 

Or maybe its because Im an Italian from NY and Vegas will never have 5 star pasta ;)",NMx2Zxf2aLukc5SoDK5ypQ,2,0,3,W9t490_A7CGLtvKApJ05yA

I have driven past this restaurant hundreds of times on my way to Trader Joe's and thought it was just a deli. Boy, was I wrong! Who knew that behind those unsuspecting doors were a full service restaurant, in addition to a counter deli and mini market?!

My husband and I had lunch with some out of town guests...and Chef Marc and crew did not disappoint.  

I ordered the Spinach Manicotti- this is a winning dish.  The homemade pasta enveloped around spinach topped with mozzarella, blanketed with a perfect pink basil sauce was perfection. 

My husband ordered the Parpadelle Bolognese and shared it with our toddler daughter, and both of them practically licked their plates clean.  My husband also ordered a side a hot sausage which was absolutely delicious. 

My cousin originally wanted the lasagna, but they had run out, so our waitress recommended the Baked Pasta Fazoletti which was like a deconstructed lasagna.  This was my favorite dish of the day and one I will order all to myself next time. 

My cousin's husband could not decide on the many delicious sandwiches so he ordered 2 half sandwiches and was very pleased with both.  

The service was OK. It wasn't the warmest, but they were attentive and our iced tea glasses were never empty- and that is what counts.  Besides, the food alone is worthy of the 5 stars and I can't wait to be back to try the dinner menu.  So glad that we ventured in because it is now added to our list of faves!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,0,1,5,53_mtxFJ-ioid-ls0LWjBw

I went here with my girlfriend and her mother and was very disappointed. When we arrived, we were instructed to seat ourselves, which I do not have a problem with because this is the way it's done in New York at a place like this. It even added to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

We were given menus and after figuring out what we wanted to order, the host came over and took them, but without taking our order. We waited another ten minutes before the waitress came over, without asking if we wanted more drinks, I might add. 

We ordered a beet salad, some veal raviolis, a mushroom pasta and sausage raviolis for the table, as we wanted to share. The only thing that was close to palatable were the sausage raviolis. However, I could only bear to eat a couple as they were over salted. All the pasta was way too al dente for my taste, maybe even being undercooked. The mushrooms in the wild mushroom pasta were obviously dried and not fresh. I could tell because it seemed like they didn't cook them long enough as they were very chewy. The veal raviolis were the worst part. They were bland and fatty, along with the pasta being undercooked. 

After we finished the beet salad, the plates just sat on the table, taking up space until just before our entrees came out. That kind of thing is very bad form in a restaurant. 

After we decided that this place is just horrible, we wanted to leave ASAP. We had to yell at the waitress across the dining room to get our check because she was having a very extensive conversation and was not paying attention to any of her tables. We then explained that we were not satisfied with the veal raviolis. To her credit, she did have them taken off the bill, but not before talking to us like we were a bunch of toddlers throwing a fit. I'm still not sure if she was being sarcastic with us or she genuinely thinks people enjoy being talked to like that. 

Overall, this place is a disaster. I absolutely do not recommend eating here.",5KzS8xgVJHOY1_L5XcraaA,2,0,1,G2es2xpHnBtPCvHbz1_fXw
