I come here frequently just for their chicken fries and milkshakes and they are amazing! I am very glad that there is now a Burger King close to my house.",FIb1U6AjmFHm8mCgbj8_tg,0,0,5,PPhjGBOrYu0-cFGvvRLaoQ
2367924,2018-05-19,0,yS6KN5nD4O-wDHxIhvMNdw,"Brand new today in Las Vegas, this Burger King is located on the south west corner of the Mountain's Edge Marketplace near Albertsons. It has two drive-thru lanes, a kids play area, a new Freestyle Coke fountain drink machine, several TVs, power ports to charge devices, Wi-Fi, high top and lower tables, a table with lights embedded and a new building smell.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,1,0,5,IyaGvq7Yf6jDAKEfkiDnag
2873159,2018-07-02,0,yS6KN5nD4O-wDHxIhvMNdw,This location has to be one of the worst locations I have been to. The customer service was horrible. The girl in the drive thru couldn't take orders and take payments at the same time. She held up the drive thru. People were backing up and leaving. When I got my food the person that gave it to me was rude. Wish I got home the food was cold and tasted horrible. I will never comeback here again!,-0KLokBGc552WOwCvwbGKg,0,0,1,LY4taPJdxid-SomazJ2qSw

3343756,2018-06-01,0,yS6KN5nD4O-wDHxIhvMNdw,They serve burned bun and saggy fries. Even the onion rings are not fresh. Their fish filet sandwich taste nasty and it smells burned. So disappointed with the quality and cleanliness. Staff strongly needs a lot of training.,Eu8zGGj8EDwtiKxCLIk82Q,2,0,1,GOCXbFx4O3VfIJU8fbVyxg
4522722,2018-05-23,0,yS6KN5nD4O-wDHxIhvMNdw,"This crew definitely needed more training before opening. There was 2 customers ahead of me and I waited 30 mins for a kids meal and a cheese burger.  I went up to ask about my food twice, only to find out my food had been sitting there the whole time. I got an ""oops"" and ""here you go""  
Also I am not exaggerating when I say that every table was dirty. 
This crew looks lost in there.",lQi2HtyBEp5Tq2DoWdrDGQ,0,0,1,PeG3klz83ZcWN0w50PtmxQ
4677442,2018-06-08,1,yS6KN5nD4O-wDHxIhvMNdw,"It was 11:40pm, there were two cars ahead of me. When we pulled the cars were being care of. We waited at the box for about 12 minutes until the person at the drive thru began our order. 

I ordered a large #11 substitute for onion rings and nuggets and a extra drink. The total came out to $12.63. Mind you, that the #11 is the NEW spicy chicken sandwich. 

We got in line for the second window to pay. And the first car in front of us got his food within 6-7 minutes. The car ahead of us pulled up. And literally took TWENTY MINUTES TO GET ONE FREAKING BAG! 

At this point, I was already angry and just wanted to leave but the car in front of me sped off. So I thought when I pull and pay, my food would be ready. 

I WAS WRONG!!!!!!

NOT ONLY DID WE NOT GET AN APOLOGY FOR THE LONG WAIT FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULDVE BEEN DONE WITHIN 10 MINUTES, BUT WE GOT A DRIVE THRU EMPLOYEE WHO STATED, ""Ugh, you got uhh large coke like ice and one with no ice? 12.63."" 

We waited 4 more minutes to get a bag that's completely wrong! First we got nuggets and fries. We told him that we wanted onion rings so he went to go get it. We noticed he gave us chicken fries and I said I wanted a spicy chicken. So he grabbed the bag out of my hand to replace it. It took another five minutes until he gave us a bag to replace our order. 

WE CHECKED THE BAG, and it was stilll freaking wrong! 
BY THE TIME WE LEFT THE DRIVE THRU, it was already 12:20am!!! THIS IS RIDICULOUS. 

We ordered a Large Spicy Chicken combo w/ onion rings  and we received a large Chicken fries combo w/ fries. 

We ordered 10 spicy nuggets and received COLD REGULAR NUGGETS 

OUR SODAS WERE WATERED DOWN FOR WATING SO LONG.

Peace of Advice from a former fast food Team Leader

If you have a car at the window and are fixing their order, please double check the next car's order to make sure it is right for having them wait so long. 

Please have a friendlier drive thru employee that actually REPEATS THE ORDER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND PLEASE GIVE THEM THEIR RECEIPTS. 

If y'all are having a lot trouble getting orders out CORRECTLY then y'all need to re-evaluate your set up. Put your weakest employee on fryers and your strongest on grill. Make sure you have a friendly and bubbly employee at your drive thru. Especially someone who can handle the fast paced and demand of the drive thru. 

Management, please make sure your employees are well trained before leaving them on their shifts by themselves. Some manager fail to realize that some people may need more time to be trained than other people. 

You have one well deserved star. I came home unsatisfied with my meal and resulted into making more food at home. 

Maybe y'all shouldn't be 24 hours when you can't handle the drive thru.

Two cars in the line 14 minute wait. Did not say hello, thank you, how you doing, sorry about the wait nothing just hands me the bag. The breakfast sucked of course because it was ice cold and dried out.  Nice new building same crappy people.",82poWi3U1403I7Y7r77_CA,0,0,1,9nhIg1D-T10ArcIFW3r5ag

By the time we got our food it was already cold and she even offered to make us a free shake or ice cream... (and apologized) 
Like No! Im hungry and just give me my food so i can go! And to top it off. Its a new location and the line at the drive thru was long already! ? 

Dear management: get your staff trained right!   
Just because its a new location doesn't give an excuse to figure out an order especially when its numbered! Wow",X6uquqCVglmUV7nOH-R1SA,2,1,1,XKoRzCw2wkaq0cZYsQlxHQ

And maybe teach them how to speak to customers. Hopefully it gets better with time, but for now 2 starts is all it gets.",b1XYzsV6dcua9f8eKIbl0w,1,0,2,v73MgW4mbterylW2_e_VGw
