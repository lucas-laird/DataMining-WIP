For what they charge I would recommend jaburritos on rainbow... kinda sad because it could be amazing but the portions control is so strict a large bowl does not fill my 8 year old...  one slice of avocado on my bowl tonight... seriously???? I will not be back....

Also... if you do not care about customer comments and you just want to say how great you are,  then keep buying your 5 star yelps with free meals... to have you argue back how great your portions etc are is just proof of how oblivious you are... your response to me is ridiculous...",kgODITgji5ES8ZT3W9HCaw,3,1,1,F-X0JNkGiN_L3xx5GgJ4Mw

I was excited to hear this place opening up in Vegas as we don't have very many options for getting Poké, but was slightly disappointed in the taste of their Poké. It did have a little bit of flavor but that mostly came from the fish itself. The sauces and ingredients used were a bit bland for my taste and I typically don't have to add soy sauce or any additional sauces but this time I feel that it was needed. Also, the price for a regular bowl is $9 ($8.99). I thought that was a bit expensive since I've had better Poké bowls for around $7.

This place is always super clean. They have a large counter and everything is always super organized and orderly. At some places, their topping get all mixed up. For example, there will be pieces of tuna in the salmon or there will be green onion in the masago. I never see that happen at sweet poke. 

The customer service here is impeccable. Everyone here is super nice and helpful. 

They are also super generous with their portions. And at some places, crab is considered one of your proteins, but here it is included. So you can get salmon (or whatever your fish of choice is) and a scoop of crab for no extra charge. 

They also have tons of options! They recently added watermelon and strawberries to their toppings. Some people may think it's gross, but I always add watermelon to my burritos now and it is soooo good.

I picked the Ahi Lover roll. It's like a giant sushi roll, more like a wrap in seaweed paper or soy paper. Yummmm. Besides the fact that the young man helping me didn't know what was supposed to go in the roll, was clearly nervous and shaking, and I had to stop him from putting in crab and put in the tuna instead (you think Ahi Lover would give him a hint), overall it was very good.

It's so delicious and I always crave it. A regular bowl is enough to fill you up. I've never had the large bowl but from what I understand you get one main protein for your regular bowl and you have many options for your base (rice, brown rice, salad, etc) they also have many sauces and most are spicy but they have 3 sauces that aren't spicy at ( I hate spicy food). You can then choose other topping like I.e. spicy crab, crab, spicy tuna, salsa and many other vegetables and avocado. Then you have other toppings to choose from after your second choice of toppings it's just amazing for the price and the service is so amazing.

1812604,2016-07-31,0,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"Having been around the West Coast and eaten a lot of poke from various places, Sweet Poke stands out as one of the best places I've been to.

From the portions (I hate getting screwed over with tiny portions) to the quality (for Vegas, this is some pretty fresh stuff), I don't have anything to complain about.

Did I mention they also offer a bunch of stuff to put on your bowl that ranges from veggies to fruits?! Don't get me wrong, I wasn't sure if mango in my bowl was gonna be good but I've become a believer. 

As an added bonus all the staff are spot on. Polite and attentive, they made me feel comfortable as I tried to navigate all the options I had for my bowl. 

TL;dr: If you're like me and don't enjoy poke because it feels like you're getting screwed in terms of food-to-price ratio, this place destroys that paradigm and has you leaving with a happy tummy.

1848465,2016-08-02,4,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"SOLID 4star establishment. Granted I've only been 2x but both times had me already thinking about the next time I come back and who next I wanna bring with me to experience the yummy delicious-ness that was devoured and all at the price of under $10. 

Establishment is in a great location and easily seen from the street when driving by. Plaza isn't fully occupied but this place is definitely the star of the show in this plaza.  Rainbow is really becoming a second Chinatown, just a lot cleaner lol. Anyway, all these pokè places kinda have this similar to subway, but for sushi burritos or bowls, they have things you can order so you don't have to think about the ingredients you wanna add, or what I go with, the create your own. 

What I can say that really stands out to me about Sweet Pokè is a couple of things I'm gonna list out:
1. super healthy (I mean it's raw fish)
2. lots of options (at no extra charges i.e. no extra charge for seaweed salad!)
3. ability to mix & match the options to your heart's content
4. I walk away actually full but not feeling heavy & guilty for my food addictions
5. Service has been spot on every time with friendly & helpful staff

Here's my experience and breakdown of the place: 

I've always gone with the bowl (personally I feel you just get waaaaay more outta it that way) which I do the Regular Serving which is 2 scoops of your choice of protein which options include: tuna, salmon, yellowtail, freshwater eel, shrimp tempura, tofu just to name a few. But get this, you can mix your scoops; 1 scoop of one protein and 1 scoop of something different. But also before you choose your protein, they will ask you rice or salad & for rice they have brown or white (I'm brown rice for the healthier option) and even that you can get half/half. With their salad options they have spinach, romaine lettuce, &/or spring mix which again you can mix all that at no extra charge. So once you pick your base of the bowl and picked your scoops of protein out, they will ask you types of sauces, and there's no limitations. they mix your protein and your sauces in a separate bowl then add that to your base bowl. because I get half brown rice and half salad mix, I even ask for sauce of my choice in the bowl drizzled on my salad. Okay so now you have your bowl base with your 2scoops added to the mix. Then the fun part, the toppings and extra yummy goodness to make your create your own exactly that! What I really like as a unique feature is you then get your choice of 1scoop of either shredded ahi tuna, crab, or spicy crab.. no extra charge, so it's like I have 3 scoops of protein which is alright by me!! So with the toppings, I always add tempura crunch, seaweed salad (which is not extra charge here & I normally pay extra for it) edamame, & fruit (dude, don't bash it till you try it! mango & pineapple pieces actually go amazing with the combo) but they have corn, tortilla chips, pico de gallo, jalapeño, all kinds of other stuff.. so combine and mix away! And there you have it! the Sweet Pokè experience! 

And real talk I walk out feeling fully satisfied. The poke is delicious, the serving size is definitely worth the bucks you pay, & honestly for the price and availability of options, I'd pick this place over some other popular sushi burrito/bowl locations. So why only 4 stars? It's missing decor and ambiance for me. It's pretty plain jane simple in there and first time I came, it as a smell of hardwood kinda similar to what you smell in home depot lol and I'm not sure if it's because of the table furnishing they went with, or the construction next door, but it just lacks in even just wall decor, set up, & presence. Definitely it's a quick eats place for sure, but I think they could warm up the ambiance of the place just a bit  so it's not so blah. But otherwise yeh, no, solid place for me. If I could it'd be 4.5 stars!",nRdfX_I0CaOq7lJunJMPpA,9,8,4,ObpQ9T14YUcnhiHMbKktSA

I had my kids with me and they wanted a sushi roll and I got the bowl to try. I even asked for extra fish for a couple dollars more because I love lots of poke. Well there was more fish in the rolls that my son and daughter had then what was in my poke bowl. I was a little dissapointed especially for what I paid for. The taste of the rolls and poke bowl was good but this place really needs to step it up with the quantity you get for what you pay for. I think this place has potential but I would say down the street at Sushiburrito you will get more for your money and the quality and quantity are so much better. Also employees here do not seem to know their own products they serve when asked about it. I had no suggestions when I asked about what was popular.

2332557,2016-08-10,4,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"So YES the Poke tour just hit another stop last week. Sweet Poke is one of the latest additions to the Poke action. I always get fired up talking Poke because its one of my favorite things too eat!!! 

Sweet Poke the concept is not much different then other Poke restaurants. It build your own style either bowl or burrito action. Or you can order from one off the menu. I ended up going with the 808 bowl for my first time. It combination of spicy tuna and tuna. If ur a fan of tuna this is the one would want to get if picking from the menu. The base I went with White Rice (Chips, Brown Rice, Salad, Organic Tofu, Half-Half), Protein since menu got two different tuna (Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Cooked Salmon, Soft Shell Crab, Scallop, Shrimp, Unagi), and the topping get choose (Crab, Spicy Tuna). The last step the Sauces (Chipotle Mayo, Eel Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, Ginger Shoyu, Wasabi Yuzu, Sweet Poke House Sauce, Creamy Japapeno, Yum Yum Sauce, Creamy Ceviche, Red Anticucho Sauce, Sesame Shoyu). So there definitely not a shortage of options or whatever your Poke combination desires! 

The bowls come in either reg or large. I went with the large bowl. Talk about LOT of food. The price for the most part is the same at all the Poke places checked out in Vegas. Some feel not get as much but at Sweet Poke get your money worth. They ask if want furikake on your rice. It might be only 808 thing but not many Poke places offer extra treat on top of your rice. I got bed of lettuce on top of the rice then started putting together the bowl. The tuna believe had the sweet poke house sauce. It had mayo base and super ono. Talk about nice size pieces of tuna. I have this rule with Poke. To start freshness is EVERYTHING and Sweet Poke least for the both tuna (my first visit trust me many more..) fresh, delicious, and legit style 808 poke. Second the cut of the tuna tells me whether they know meaning of Poke. I hate seeing minced tuna pan off as Poke. It should be decent size diced cubes of fresh fish. Sweet Poke it was right between nice diced but nothing tiny. The spicy tuna they just different style so not expecting it diced. Both tuna could just have bowl of each and be in Poke bliss. The toppings again not much different except always couple different ones see from one place to another. I loaded my bowl up with seaweed salad, edamame, cucumbers, and avacado. Lot more you can choose from so am sure something for everyone. Cucumbers, Edamame, and Avacado slices all nice and fresh!!! 

All the workers were awesome the whole time being my first visit. They explained everything clearly, and guiding me each step putting my bowl together. The whole staff super friendly. Really the minute walked in warm greeting, never rushed, and not doubt five star service. I love the interior. They have couple professional pictures of the food on the walls single shots. The minute walk in tell new building, new restaurant, and hell of clean just opened. Decent amount of places that can sit down eat unlike other spots.

2540097,2016-08-15,2,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"Update 8/14/16: went in today to get my usual. A couple points off because it was my first bad experience and it left a bad taste in my mouth.... Literally. When I got to the veggies toppings, I usually ask for extra extra seaweed for my husband's bowl. Mind you, he doesn't get a lot of the other vegetables. He simply gets lettuce, and extra seaweed. 

They have done it for us a couple times in the past, but today, the guy refused to add more than the one serving they're ""allowed to give"". I had to pay $2 for extra seaweed on the side. I get it. Buuuut, what is the difference between last time we were there and today? Be consistent with your rules among all of your employees. What is the difference between extra seaweed, and packing the bowl with all these other toppings?

Second gripe.... The ahi was so mushy and fishy tasting. I know, I know. It's fish!! But it shouldn't be pungently fishy. The thick cuts of fish being mushy plus the fishiness was not cute today!! I loved this place. I used to come so many times since it just opened, and that's recently. Idk if I can for a very long time. 
...............................................................

I had a great first time experience here. I ordered a Large Poké bowl with 3 scoops of Ahi. Wasn't sure what sauce to get, so I went safely with Ginger Shoyu. I got all the toppings and fixings I knew I'd enjoy with my bowl. The guy was nice enough to let me do half/half of imitation crab and spicy imitation crab as a topping. Next time, I'd try a different sauce and if I do go with the ginger Shoyu again, I'll ask for more. 

I'll definitely be returning. Ahi tasted fresh. Note: eat it right away. You don't want the warm rice to warm up the Poké too much.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,6,2,2,FBaTM3mTJatXc6CwI2gDJw

2757525,2016-08-29,1,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"I'd really love to rate Sweet Poke with much more than 3 stars, however it seems that the staff doesn't really know their own menu making service extremely slow and honestly quite frustrating.

All that aside though, the pre made menu items are tasty and also customizable like most of these places in town.

Don't let the name fool you, they also offer sushi burritos as well. My only gripe is that the nori (seaweed) wrapper on the sushi burrito isn't crispy, nor is their an option for that. 

Otherwise, the portions are large and worth the money and you can even get different sizes of Poke Bowls. 

The dining area isn't too large so prepare to wait for a spot to sit or get your stuff to go if it's really busy.

A little hard to find but GPS should help you out there. The sign isn't all that big outside but if you look for O'reilly Auto Parts, they're in the same plaza.

I've only ever had the Las Vegas Burrito and the 808 Poke Bowl and both in my option were great! 

Like I said, the only reason this place gets 3 and not more stars from me is the service. I know they're new but I feel like the staff should readily know their menu and not constantly ask what you'd like inside of your order (especially when you're ordering something from their preset menu and not customizing).",ZMUrBWZBXW6kdVUjV9szTg,1,1,3,6SlNDT5xq2eq2B7s6rWw6Q

The kids who work here, don't really know what they're doing. You definitely can't hear them on the other side of the glass. The customer ahead of me and I looked at each other twice wondering what the heck was going on because we both had to repeat ourselves a few times. I realized the easiest way to get what you want, is to just 'point'.  

The guy who took care of me definitely did not seem like he knew much, didn't engage much in conversation ( it wasn't busy, just me and the customer in front of me, whom the female employee helped). When he rung me out, he didn't say, 'Thank you.' Customer service is VERY important to me so I really took note in remembering this experience. As I left the restaurant, I always say a, 'Thank you' before I walk out the door....only the female acknowledged and said, 'Have a nice day.'

For the price I paid for a regular bowl, I think they should put more fish in it. A half cup of poke in a big bed of rice isn't worth it....rice is CHEAP! Not to mention that the poke didn't seem very fresh. There's a ton of poke bowl restaurants up and down Rainbow Blvd and I know competition is pretty steep. For a place that's literally at the end of Rainbow Blvd, where most people don't go to unless they live near, I think they should step up. 

As for now, I will continue to drive up the street and go to the other poke place where one would get your money's worth....and they have better customer service.",yPVnXy6Zf3LefjcbjOABDQ,2,1,2,udjD9RJ_ep03xXfhVD3pNQ

3576838,2016-07-10,8,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"I had this place in Centennial location bookmarked for a couple of weeks so when I found out they opened this second store closer to me, I was so exited. 
OMG, I had a bad experience here. 
First, I was waiting in a line to order my food and this lady that came after me cut in the line. Well, this happens a lot to me for some reason (If you are from Japan, you may know this, too), but usually employees say something to the person and they realize I was there before. This store, I know this guy working here saw the lady squeezed right in front of me but he didn't say anything. Nothing, instead he started taking this lady's order. Fine. I don't get crazy with this kind of small stuff. 
Then, my turn came. I could tell this tall skinny kid that was taking my order was very nervous. I ordered regular bowl, half rice and half lettuce. He put just rice. No lettuce. I didn't say anything because maybe they put lettuce after or on top. He told me to pick two proteins. So I said salmon and shrimp. He put three tiny salmon cubes on top of the rice and he started to shredding one shrimp in three or four pieces with his shaky hands... WTH?! I had to say something but I didn't know what to say because maybe that's their way to do things here... So I said ""I wanted half rice and half lettuce on the bottom..."" The girl that was working noticed me saying that and saw what he was doing. She remade my bowl. She put six pieces of salmon and she didn't shred the shrimp by hands, thank God. 1 star for remaking my bowl but the guy that looked like the manager seemed annoyed. (I got super annoyed by him giving me a dirty look.)
I am not blaming this kid because I have experienced the same when I was his age. (high school) This was probably his first or second day at this job and he was in training. I know it's nerve-racking very first day or second day at any kind of job. Someone or the manager should've watched him when he was making the bowl. Not his fault at all.
Still, $8.99 for what I got is way too overpriced. (Sorry, I'm used to Poke Express's price) If it's in NYC or on the Vegas strip, I would say the price is reasonable but this is on Rainbow and Windmill... Really?! Why so skimpy on the shrimps also? I saw one guy complaining there was no shrimp in his 808 bowl. 
Not coming back. I would not recommend this place. Go elsewhere to get your Poke. 
(Oh, about the food. I forgot. Just like any other similar places like here. Fresh and delicious. +1 more star then. Okay.)",RpLeX_kRHbrW5v5YH-R0nQ,10,8,2,eb3CyNQ06BzT7A54cA21Sg

You get to choose between a bowl or sushi burrito. I'm not a fan of poke bowls with all the filler stuff in it so I ended up going to the sushi burrito. You get your choice of protein, toppings, delicious sauces, and other veggies to go with your protein. 

I went with the ahi tuna and salmon as my main protein. They were out of seaweed wrapper so I got the soy paper which was actually not bad at all. The only thing with the soy paper is that it rips very easily and becomes very soggy if you put a lot of sauce. The server was smart enough to add the sauce at the end because he knew what soggy mess my burrito would have been since I like a lot of ponzu sauce lol. You also get more topping choices of spicy tuna, crab and I can't remember the other one. Of course I got spicy tuna because I wanted more fish :P 

Then you have choice of greens to put inside the burrito and I went with kale. Then you move over to the little toppings like crispy tempura crumbs, onions, peppers and all that jazz. I wanted to try more sauces but since my soy paper would not allow this I had to refrain :(

I thought the portion was pretty good and the amount of fish they put it in was more than a lot of the other sushi burrito places I've been too. The workers were really nice and there's a good amount of seating inside.",46-qsKjqR4vptCIYrHH1yw,4,3,4,V7LjASbQOsx-GeoRz3_SEA

The portion sizes are comparable to others in the area, maybe a little smaller than some other BUT they make up for it with their large variety of free toppings that you are able to add (most other places put an up charge on additional toppings).

Spicy tuna burrito with brown rice and a couple of vegetables.  They gave me one scoop and spread it to the point that all I was eating was rice and veggies.  When I brought up my concern the cashier gave me some BS about how they get fresh fish everyday so he'll charge me the kids.  In my head I'm screaming at this point.  I told him that last time I got 2 scoops charged the full amount and I was satisfied if I have to pay more I will but instead he had the other guy rolled up my burrito obviously clearly telling me no and then offered me a drink afterwords.  A free drink isn't going to make up for your service besides the kids you have behind the counter were obviously under pressure.

It kind of felt like a bunch of kids put a poke stand together to raise some money for a class trip.

I think once they find their groove, get more familiar with the menu and the system they have in place, and maybe change a few little things (that sneeze guard is way too high, put labels over the ingredients so the customers know what's what, etc.), it's gonna be a much smoother experience for us and them. 

Oh, the food. The food is great. My girl and I both got large 808 bowls (basically tuna with more tuna) and shared a cooked shrimp roll, and everything was fresh tasting and spot on.

I ended up getting the ""Shaka Surf"" poke bowl which is made with minimal ingredients (basically salmon, masago, green onion, tempura crunch, and special sauce). I got it with white rice and cucumber on the side; it also comes with a side of crab. I got a regular size, which includes 2 scoops of protein. It's not small, but it's also not big (you can upsize to a large); my bowl looked very small compared to the customer ahead of me who had a mound of lettuce and other toppings.

The salmon poke was delicious. The sauce that they use in it is a little mild and doesn't overpower the salmon. The salmon itself was good. The sliced cucumber wasn't great; I could tell it wasn't super fresh. The seaweed salad that I got with the combo #4 (includes bowl/burrito, seaweed salad, and drink) was crunchy and delicious.

The interior feels a big too clinical, with the blank white walls and open space. I feel like a little bit of artwork would liven up the place a bit. The staff seems to be knowledgeable enough, though I could tell that the girl making my bowl was a little too cautious with adding ingredients. The bowl I ordered also didn't state any more additional toppings, yet she asked if I wanted any greens and such, so be aware of what comes in the premade bowl.

MENU:
First, you decide if you want a bowl or burrito. Options include white rice, brown rice, organic tofu, salad. Next, you choose your fish and mix it with extra toppings like masago and green onions. Then, you choose your toppings. Lastly, sauce is added. When I ordered, I got confused because I was asked about sauce after the second step. I originally assumed that the sauce was the salad dressing (which I always get on the side) but I think the sauce is meant to marinate the fish mixture. Anyways, don't get confused like me. 

FOOD: 
I ordered a salad with two scoops of salmon with crab, seaweed, masago, green onions, and creamy jalapeño sauce on the side. **Side note for the business: you should always ask if the customer wants sesame seeds in their meal. Some people may be allergic and some people may not like the flavor. This concerned me when the person automatically poured in sesame seeds.**

PRICING:
Two scoops of protein costs $8.99 and three scoops cost $11.99. Scoops are small in my opinion. Extra toppings like green onion and masago and avocado cost extra, I believe. 

QUALITY/TASTE:
I wasn't blown away by the way the ingredients tastes. It was just an average poke bowl to me.  

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
Workers are friendly but also new to their role. I think they should ask the customer if they've ever been here before and if not, review the ordering process.

And given, it has only been a couple of days since opening. Parts of my rice was crunchy and cold, some of it was warm. How can you open an Asian restaurant and not even get the rice right? 
Secondly, portion is way smaller than other places like Jaburrito and Soho Burrito for the same price. 
The ordering window is either too tall or too thick- I'm screaming across my order to the poor girl who can hardly hear me. I like the menu, it features tofu as a base. I also like the Coca Cola refrigerator that features more drink options like RAMUNE, Vita Coco, Oolong Tea and Japanese Coffee in a can. Very clean and spacious dining space.

4750989,2016-07-24,5,eiTWTVThkHr-DKXxIysbgA,"Fresh Poke is what I would name this place. It is. The fish is pretty fresh. No gristle. For about the same price as the Albertsons sushi tray that I occasionally buy on the fly, this far surpasses it. The processed ones always have this weird acetic taste to it, kind of like vinegar. With the rice, sticky enough to be used as kindergarten paste. Anyhoo, the process here is similar to Chipotles. You choose different items to build your own OR you can choose one of their prebuilt ones ( if you are the type who needs a handbook playing tinker toys).

You choose your rice, white, brown, tofu, salad, half and half. I chose the 3 scoop so I can get 3 different scoops of ""base"" and 3 types of protein. I chose the brown rice and tofu. Chose the tuna, salmon, and yellow tail for my protein. The 2 scoops was about $8.99 and 3 scoops $11.99 I think.

You get to choose sides and sauces. I chose the sesame shoyu. It was a bit sweeter than I like. I like my shoyu without mayo dressing in it. Kind of like how Costco's Poke is when they have it....the Hawai'i Costco has way better Poke FYI. The shoyu sauce is basically shoyu and thinly cut green onions. Some chives would be great too!

All in all, not bad. I would come again. Everything was fresh. The only thing I don't like is that the menu is a little confusing. You can add many things but some items cost extra. I've yet to see ones where they separate the added cost items from the free ones that are easily discernible to the customer (talking about you Jimmy Johns! The one and only time I went there, I ordered a sandwich with lettuce and tomato in it only bc I thought all the other items were additional cost items. None of the staff bothered to tell me what I could add so I ended up with a tasteless sandwich. As to be expected since they spent all their training money in those nifty ""so fast"" commercials that they forgot to tell the staff to do more than stand around and emit CO2).

Service was very friendly and they helped me decipher the BIG menu.

Afterwards I went Poke hunting in Lake Las Vegas. Don't go there, not worth the trouble. They have some water based Pokemon but they all escape anyway.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,3,4,4,xoSOWWZxKln_MQZQjfm9XQ

Styled like a Chipotle, you get a wide variety of options for your bowl or burrito. Most add-ons are free, which sets it apart from Soho and other places. I prefer to have a stuffed burrito or overflowing bowl. Even with the presets I get to customize my scoops of fish. 

For the taste, it's fairly tasty. Fish tastes fairly fresh to me.  The sauces are nice and the veggies are fresh.  I don't stray too far from the Shaka Surf or Hamachi San. To me, the sushi burrito places all taste pretty good, so then it comes down to price and service.  Everyone is pleasant and I typically don't get any trouble getting what I want (which isn't terribly complicated to begin with).

Nothing wrong but nothing great either. I was definitely a little disappointed because the location on Eastern and 215 has such excellent customer service and is always busy but this place almost felt like it was closed and customer service was just OK because she felt like she was just there to do a job while their Eastern and 215 location is informative and make you feel welcomed. Also, their portions seemed a bit smaller than I usually get.
As a reply to the owner comment: I am aware that I can add additional toppings because I order the exact same bowl every time and that is how I can tell that the portions are smaller. This is a preselected bowl on your menu, not one that I created myself. The amount of customers that a store serves should not determine whether they serve larger or smaller portions.

So, I came back nearly a year later to try out this location one more time. This time my portion was up to par but, within less than an hour of eating here, I became sick to my stomach and vomited the rest of the day! As stated in my previous post, I eat at another Sweet Poke location at least 2x per month and have never had an issue. I will not be back a third time!",WcmMeT_3fnjJniILAg7jHA,0,0,2,GsBfK1dSSyAwOQ-5D3nHSw

The rice was dry and they skimped on every single scoop that went into my Poke bowl. I had to ask numerous times for additional protein (Salmon & cooked shrimp) because I was being given 3 to 4 pieces if that. I also had to pay a $1 for avocado if I wanted more than 2 slices, which I totally wouldn't mind if the avocado was actually ripe enough to eat. And, on top of all of that - my bowl had no flavor because I was given 2 squirts of sauce.

As a result, I had the most bland poke bowl EVER! If I tried this location before the other, I definitely wouldn't have returned. On that note, be sure to watch as they prepare your bowl and you should be good to go!",CQm1OAqGQJvtE-B4jQRz0Q,3,0,3,B6YI61YShbHWvz9keKQaWg
