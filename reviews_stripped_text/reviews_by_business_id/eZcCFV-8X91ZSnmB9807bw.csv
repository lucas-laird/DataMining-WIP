She stated in a very short manner ""well I thought you might have been with another party that had already checked in"". A simple greeting and may I help you could have cleared any uncertainty.. My wife and I were then seated immediately by another hostess who apologized. I asked to speak with a manager and someone who appeared to be a waiter approached the table and stated that he was the manager and would address the poor customer service my wife and I experienced on what was our wedding anniversary lunch. He didn't seem to take my complaint very seriously and to top it off, once we received our food, it was extremely salty.

The bread was mostly great.  The pumpernickel was absolutely delicious but the sourdough (was that what it was) was too hard and dry to bite into. No points lost there however, as some people enjoy crusty bread like that.

His kobe burger was cooked perfectly (he asked for rare) and my luau salad was consistently delicious, as it is whenever I get it. Always plenty to take home.

We ordered banana cream cheesecake and chocolate tuxedo cheesecake to go so I won't know how they are until later.

All in all a good experience. Friendly, accommodating staff (they happily brought us more bread when asked) and a comfortable environment. The music was a touch loud but I guess that's how most restsurants have it these days.

154631,2015-08-26,0,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"I would like to start off by saying that I have paid multiple visits to cheesecake factory before. The food is diverse and made right most of the time but my visit tonight will be my last. Being a server myself, I understand that it can be complicated in the kitchen but a bad attitude from a server (whose name I don't know since she never bothered to introduce herself), is not acceptable. We started off with the portabella mushroom avocado and zucchini fries which is a staple for us and it was served different than other times but we've become accustomed to getting this dish looking different each time. We also ordered the tostada salad to share. Three iced tea refills later (one of which was the wrong kind of tea), and I had to ask the waitress where our salad was and she informed us that they burnt the tostada and were making a new one. Fifteen minutes later we get the salad which looked more like a bowl of lettuce with nothing else mixed in it. It was clearly missing some of the ingredients. The manager came around and offered to replace the salad with a new one made correctly. After three tries, we were served a simple salad that should've been on the table an hour before. I did my best to be understanding towards the server until she dropped the check off with three salads on there and she had only taken off one of them from the total. Basically they expected me to pay for THEIR mistake. At that point, I had given up on the server and once again asked to see a manager and all he did was take one more salad off and have me pay for the bill as if it was served right at a reasonable time. He never bothered to apologize or try and make up for the inconvenience. Over all it was not a good experience. People do not come to a restaurant to wait around and be treated this way. Restaurants are equally valued for their customer service as they are for their food in my eyes and cheesecake factory failed at both this time. Considering the way management acts around here, I do not think there will be a change made in this restaurant's ways. I won't be back.",1G-JYBGVlqO3Fw3GPFyFFg,0,0,1,-zXup_CBgEUYRyNR_5jTJA

This is my third attempt to eat at their Summerlin location, as the other two attempts have not gone well. There is no service standard what so ever. So last Saturday on October 17th, around 10:30 pm, my girlfriend and i went in. There was nothing going on; as Boca Park dies around 9:30pm all week. We sat in the bar, and were greeted by our server. My gf orders a coffee, i get an iced tea, iced tea came out fine coffee was ice cold. we let the server know. and a new pot was brewed 10 minutes later my girlfriend gets her coffee. While waiting we were ofered bread, complimentary bread is nice, no knives to cut the bread or spread butter though. Well we finally ordered now we have been here for close to 30 minutes, my i get a quesadilla, she gets an omelet. On the first attempt its the wrong order. now the manager comes by, he wants to make sure we have a good experience then you Frankie our experience blew. So now he goes to the kitchen tells us he will make sure everything comes out perfect. The next omelet comes out and is completely raw, with a long black hair through it  So now we have been here for 45 minutes, the ambiance is terrible, the service is terrible the food quality is terrible and now lets hit management. So Frankie comes up to us and deeply apologizes and tells none of his cooks have long black hair, that's all well and good but my girlfrined is blonde. So he then tells us that our bill would be comped and offered us cmplimentary cheese cake. we respectfully declined as we just wanted to leave. I put $15.00 on the table for the server to call it what it is. We walked out and the manager came running out frantically screaming at us as if we skipped out on the bill. NO, FRANKIE, YOU SAID THE BILL WAS COMPED! So we come back into see what this clown was going to charge us with, we then are given a bill from a server who was not even ours telling us this is our bill..   Like i said I have tried this place 3x since I have moved to Vegas and they are horribly ran. Their don't give a shit attitude its Summerlin is horrendous. Frankie has zero customer service!

I went with my friend after our horrible experience at Aquae Sulis spa.  We  both had mint green teas and the lunch-sized cobb salad.

The mint tea was fantastic.  The salads were huge for a lunch size, and the ingredients were fresh and cold. I like that there was no fat at all on the chicken.  The dressing could have used a bit more flavor.

To finish, friend had the carrot cake cheesecake, I had the red velvet cheesecake (which I love!!).  We both left very happy with our desserts!!

Unfortunately, the service was pretty lackluster.  It took forever for her to stop by the table to take orders, refill drinks, pick up plates, bring the check, return the check, etc.

Although I try and stray away from chain restaurants this once you truly can't miss. They literally have everything on their menu. This can be a blessing and a curse. There are so many amazing options it can be hard
To decide. What I can tell you is this.

The Louisiana Chicken Pasta is amaze. It's Parmesan crusted chicken served over pasta with a spicy New Orleans sauce. The portion in my opinion
Is pretty large. So you could share. 

My absolute favorite however is
The stuffed mushrooms. Mmmm. Fontina and Parmesan Cheese, Garlic and Herbs in a Wine Sauce. Some times when I eat
It I want to tell the waiter I love him just for bringing me the stuffed mushrooms that I ordered...but at that point in our relationship we've only
Known eachother for about
20 min so maybe thats to soon to take
That step. 

They also have amazing soups. I seriously doubt you can go wrong with one.

Now for all of you calorie counters. There's is a menu to make
You feel a little
Less guilty. It is called the ""Skinnylicious"" Menu. It's basically menu full of food saying "" eat me I have not
Cream or butter."" 

Cheesecake has something for everybody. It's an excellent
Place for a group. It is
Pricier but manageable.

My Tip:
GET THE CHEESECAKE. It's called the Cheesecake Factory for crying out Loud. It is simply not  to say no to a slice. I suggest the red velvet if you really feel in the mood To have a relationship with a cake. It's literally to die for. Not an
Exaggeration .",T0ua11LxP335TfFsuawbNw,0,0,4,Gp2CWFSnBVKwCUBnMHH6hw

The hostess was pleasant upon our arrival, and she wished us a good evening as we left. Our waiter, Sean, was courteous and attentive. My Cobb salad was tasty and large. My wife enjoyed her Asian chicken salad & her tiny $10 margarita, and the children seemed to enjoy the pulled pork sandwich with fries and the kids menu chicken strips with fresh fruit. My water glass never went empty which is a major factor for me. Haven't tried the take home cheese cake yet, but in the past it has always been yummy.

We had a huge booth away from the bar and TV which was nice because I found myself enjoying my family instead of the basketball game on TV.

The food was awesome! After I decided what to order. The menu selection is huge.
My wife had the chicken taquitos, which were very authentic and dang good!
I had the Steak Diane and herb crusted Salmon combo. The Steak with the sauce and mushrooms was very flavorful. But the star of the meal for me was the Salmon. I normally don't order Salmon at restaurants but the description sounded good and our server indicated that it was wild caught, which was the selling point for me.
I'm just going to say that it's the best Salmon I've ever had at a restaurant!  Nough said!

As I write this, I've officially been on hold for 19 minutes and 10 seconds. I wrote this review because this is the 3rd time it has happened. Regretfully there isn't another Cheesecake Factory in the area, that's why we have to go to this location. Should just drive to the Strip! It'll be quicker than dealing with this horrendous service. Could we go somewhere else for dinner? Yes, but that's not the point of this review and I'm craving Portobello Fries...

Sure, we're calling during the ""peak"" hours, but isn't that all restaurants on weekends? No other restaurant in Summerlin has this problem in our experience. Since this is happening EVERY weekend, isn't that an indicator that perhaps they need more staffing? Every time I call, they always say: ""Let me get the manager to help take orders.""  Duh! Shouldn't they already be involved? 

Finally got Cesar on the phone (total of 21 minutes and some wait). The 2nd star was for his great attitude and exemplary service (thanks Cesar).  Extremely apologetic although not his fault.  He's the only reason I proceeded with the order and was comped a cheesecake. If they keep it up, there's only so much cheesecake to give away before they run out with their subpar service.

The average price for this excellent quality of food is around $10-$15 dollars for an entree.  The desserts (the Cheesecakes, of course) are anywhere from $6 to $8.  I ordered Chicken Madiera with Steak Diane (a combo plate) that cost $19.99.  They bring out a couple different types of bread before your meal that will hold you over for the 30-45 minute wait for food (this place is usually always busy).

The food itself, I believe, is excellent.  it may not be at every location but with a Gordon Biersch next door, they have to step up the quality.  The steak I had was complimented nicely with mashed potatoes that weren't simply mashed potatoes; the meat was covered in a tasty mushroom wine sauce while the chicken was topped with fresh asparagus and melted mozzarella cheese (also with a mushroom sauce).

The desserts are excellent as well...they should be considering the name of the restaurant.  We had the Vanilla Bean (my son will only eat Vanilla) and Chocolate Oreo Mudslide Cheesecakes; both were rich and tasty and something we would order again.

The service here is as to be expected for such a busy restaurant.  We sat outside where there are fans and mist machines to keep you cool.  It was much quieter and less cramped; you also have a nice view of either the condo's next to Suncoast or the valley below.

The menu is expansive, I only covered what I ate, but I would try many other dishes here (I have in the past, all have been excellent).  The restaurant looks a lot fancier and expensive than it really is.  There isn't a kids menu so plan to order a full meal for them or just share like I did...there is plenty to go around!",kodN4VHOHqvq8Zu2LSbxLg,2,2,4,QlSJ5FzI1fqjXmDbtSEoUQ

Here are some examples:  Our table was 14"" away from the next person and the waitress had to crane her arm to serve each table stuffing her elbow in my son's face more than once.  Next I ordered the Fish N' Chips, on the recommendation of the waitress, only to be served breaded cardboard over soggy chips.  I was hard pressed to find the dry fish anywhere on that plate.  The coleslaw was a jumble of minced vegetables with some kind of light dressing which did not resemble anything I've ever known called coleslaw.  My son ordered a hamburger and out came this smallish, overcooked (even though he asked for mid-rare) dry burger, again with soggy fries. I could go on about the line-up of people waiting for a table while the staff were all talking and giggling and paying no attention to the patrons. Etc.

The whole experience was terrible and nothing like we expected.  We paid the bill and left, never to return to this or any location.  However, when I talked to my other son and told him of our ordeal he was shocked and said that it must be the location because he has had delicious food in the Denver location.

We've celebrated birthdays and anniversaries and it's always at the top of our list whenever we plan on celebrating a special occasion. The service is always phenomenal. The wonderful, helpful and friendly staff are genuine and are always there to greet you and make sure your experience is memorable. It's a fact that The Cheesecake Factory invests an average of $3,000 per employee on training - and it most definitely shows! 

In addition, the food is always fresh and fast and the hearty-sized portions will leave you satisfied with some leftovers to take to work the following day! Over time we've  tried dozens of the items on their menu and we've never been disappointed. We look forward to the warm bread and butter that they serve you as soon as you're seated (TIP: Ask for a side of shredded Parmesan cheese with the bread and dip the buttered slices into the cheese! WOW!).

It is very uncommon, but there were instances where mistakes in the order did occur, such as forgetting to remove the chicken when asked, or having a dish served cold. But when brought to their attention, they will always be extra sincere and apologetic and will always reimburse you to your satisfaction, so I won't take points off for that!

When all is said and done, I have yet to find a restaurant with the quality of food and service that this particular Cheesecake Factory has to offer!",vmMCdliw3qREe4rChe_jCg,0,0,5,YckT2NnLaOrB1-lLkHJVeA
863277,2014-09-16,1,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"Went to Cheesecake Factory for the first time in a long time. Boy was it mediocre! My wife and I walked in at about 3:30PM and it was almost entirely empty. My wife is currently walking with a cane as she is recovering from knee replacement surgery. The hostess greeted us and promptly told us it would be about a five minute wait - please have a seat. WHAT??? five minute wait in an empty restaurant??? Did she see the cane? Does she know that 95% of the tables are wide open? I am not exaggerating, it was 95% EMPTY!!!! 

OK, let it go... she was stupid. We were seated in about three minutes - just long enough for my wife to uncomfortably sit down and stand back up again. 

Food took a LONG time to come out - especially considering how busy the kitchen was (sarcasm). I ordered the herb crusted salmon salad from their new ""skinnylicious"" menu. My wife had the Steak Diane/Chicken Madiera combo. Hers was what you'd expect - typical Cheesecake Factory OK meal. Mine on the other hand was UNDERWHELMING. Our server informed me that the salmon on this salad usually comes cold, unless I would like it heated. I opted for warmed. Big mistake. Their idea of warmed seemed to be microwaved to the point of shriveled and hard around the edges. Also their idea of salad seemed to be dump some greens out of a bag o' salad and dress it up with a couple of sticks of asparagus. Come on guys... make me a fresh piece of fish and use some higher quality greens. Like I said, UNDERWHELMING!

I really expect that in a restaurant, they should be able to prepare/cook a piece of fish better than I can at home. I also expect freshly cooked, not what had to be cooked yesterday (or last week) before it went bad and then refrigerated to hold it for leftovers for the salad. 

Lots of staff standing around with a dirty floor. No one seemed to care. My guess is POOR MANAGEMENT and POOR TRAINING. Sorry Cheesecake Factory, but you have slipped about three notches and I won't be returning.",z21uBsK7layUkXZsHWF4rQ,1,0,1,YmNC4xKN9mgp3DIZ7g-QGg

Pretty much every pasta dish here is so bomb, it makes my spirit soar and my body react in a borderline sexual manner, so naturally, Cheesecake Factory take out was our decision this fine evening. 

Now listen, I'm not exaggerating when I say there was a line of 5-10 cars waiting for take out and the manager Sara was running around the parking lot, directing traffic, fighting crime, carrying 5 bags at a time, and heroically getting people's food to them in the cold. She was like Wonder Woman. At one point, I think she actually flew but I can't say for certain. She was dodging cars, slinging that delicious cheesecake left and right, just being a straight take-out savage, as we all stood by like PEASANTS in the presence of a higher power. Impressed by her service, I tried to tip her and she wouldn't let me (which is my only real complaint)

Within the past year, though, I've had complaints, but still gave them chances to redeem themselves. But now, I don't think I'll be back for a while. 

During one visit, we had a group of six people. I don't know what was going on with our waiter, but he came to check on us maybe once after we got our food, and none of our drinks were ever filled. When it came time to drop off the bill, we were informed that gratuity was already added to the bill. In my experience, places only do this if your party is eight or larger. The only reason this pissed us off was because it then clicked in our heads, ""Oh, so that's why he didn't give a fuck about serving us. He's getting a fat tip anyway."" And it's not like he was nowhere to be found. We saw him several times, checking on people around us, but could never get his attention. I only wish I could remember his name.

But what iced the cake was our last visit. My boyfriend ordered a burger, medium rare. When it came out, it looked good until he took a bite of it. The entire inside was raw. It was so disgusting, I couldn't even believe it. Our waitress seemed to agree, and she took it back for them to make a new one. Then a manager came and sort of apologized, asked if we wanted anything else. We're all modest and junk so we said, ""No, we're fine,"" but of course we were expecting they at least wouldn't charge us for the burger or, ya know, give us a coupon or something. Nothing. Guess they don't seem to care if the customer gets food poisoning because of their careless chefs. Not trying to sound like a freeloader, I just think it was a horrible business call.

We were seated in the bar area which was fine it is just that the table was very small. Barely held the drinks and the plates. We had two of the small appetizers, the corn fritters and the fried artichoke hearts. They were both very good. This is why I have to at least apply the second star. Now I can only speak for my lunch but it was inedible. I ordered the lunch Chicken Picatta. I knew as soon as it was set in front of me something was not right. The chicken was a shade of white like I have never seen before. I took a bite anyway, It was retched, I spit it right out. I thought maybe it was me, tried a second bite. Again same terrible spoiled taste. The only person I saw who worked there was the bus boy, I told him the chicken was bad. He promptly took my plate. He came back after a few minutes to tell me the manager would be over and they were cooking another one for me. I told him no thanks, just the thought of chicken was making me sick. The manager came over to ask me what was wrong. I explained, she was behaving as though she did not believe me. Starts telling me that they get fresh food every other day. I am not saying they don't, but the damn chicken was bad. She states maybe it is the capers, NO i have had capers a million times, I did not even put a caper in my mouth. I told her that I was being very discreet regarding this and did not cause a scene. She asked if I would prefer something else, I ordered a plain burger. When the burger arrived it was fine. 
What bothers me the most is that they were acting like I was making this up. Second my son and I ate in shifts. I do not see my son enough to want to have our lunch together ruined and eaten in shifts. 
When I got the check, my son asked if they removed the chicken charge, they did, he asked if they charged for the burger, they did. He was pretty pissed about this stating i should not have been charged for the burger. 
At this point I was over the Cheesecake Factory, and will never be heading back.",xWk0I0S9KWMB06wKUEDYxg,5,2,2,xp0aTkCc3NhknuXXAcXlvA

With their large menu and wide verity of items, it is sure to please all at the table. The menu consists of appetizers, salads, pizzas, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, steaks, breakfast items, fish and seafood, deserts and over 40 cheesecake options. They also have a menu for people who are watching their calorie intake or have gluten allergies. During the weekends they offer a Sunday Brunch option, a tradition in many families. Every online posted experience, the food always met or exceeded their expectations. The food is always hot and fresh with great flavors. Here is a quote from Foodie.com about the Cheesecake factory: ""You want selection? There are two pages of just appetizers. TWO pages! Just check out all the mouthwatering selections online if you have a moment. I haven't even tried a tenth of their menu, and yet it remains one of my favorite places to eat. Go for the cheesecake, stay for the food, never a disappointment!""
This fabulous restaurant has incredible customer service. The staff will greet you right away. They will cater to your special occasions. As an example if you have a birthday or anniversary, they will surprise you with a free desert at the end of the meal. They will even gather the staff and sing happy birthday energetically to the birthday person. If it is an anniversary they will personalize the desert by writing happy anniversary. They will make alterations to the menu items to meet your needs and do it with a smile. Their great attitudes have made many post reviews online with many reputable sites. Some of them include Foodie.com and Yelp. There are incredible reviews written on Yelp for all over the US, proving the consistency of great service. Depending on the mood you are in they have a dine-in and a take-out option. For the take-out option, they also provide curbside pickup. One of the Yelp the reviews said ""Our waiter and he was absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best waiters I have ever had before. Not only was he very good at what he does (taking orders, getting drinks, making sure that everyone is taken care of at the table) he was also very personable. We talked to him a little bit in his down time, and he made us laugh a few times. Everyone at my table loved him, and said the same thing... that he is on of the best waiters we have ever had"" at a restaurant.""
The atmosphere is a great combination of everything that a person could want. As mentioned earlier there is a dine-in and a take-out option but they also have many other options. Sitting out on the patio to enjoy the weather or stay inside the dining room to avoid the weather. Join the bar for a more social environment. The best time for the bar is during happy hour for that social mood. You could also, snug yourself away in booth for a more intimate setting. The vibe of the restaurant is very upbeat, friendly, fun, personable and beautiful. The walls have beautiful large European murals and pillars. The space is open but a cozy feel as well. It is a place where to dress up or dress down. Guests can bring kids or eat alone. No matter what mood, no matter who the guest is, Cheesecake Factory is a place that all will enjoy. On Foodie.com there are some great articles for Cheesecake factory. One of the quotes said ""I was just blown away by the architecture.

Their cheesecakes are to die for, but the calorie count is beyond belief and just might kill you (as is the case for most items on their menu).

I love the brown bread they bring to the table when you arrive and their passion fruit iced tea is the bomb! Of course, the avocado eggrolls are exquisite, but I seldom order them. Instead, I found a recipe that tastes exactly the same so make it at home. Making the recipe, though, shows why their food is so good--they use unique and quality ingredients and their dressings and sauces include many, many ingredients (many of which are hard to find).

I usually order a dinner salad, eat half of it, and take the rest home (asking for a little extra dressing in my take-home bag). With the remainder, I can make two more meals simply by adding extra lettuce. 

The Cheesecake Factory is not cheap so is truly a special treat. They offer take-out so are a great option when traveling and don't feel like going out to eat or ordering room service.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,1,0,5,tR2D7Bkc3W0hJCiwcXMmUw

It's perfect for when your with a group of people who all want different types of food or if you just don't know what you're hungry for. Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious. 

This particular location is interesting because it's in Boca Park where a lot of the Summerlin snobs hang out. 

Today was a beautiful sunny day so we opted to sit in the patio. Being that there was only 2 of us, and they weren't busy, we were seated right away. However I could tell, almost immediately, that this visit was going to be not a good as previous experiences. Our server, Shawn M, came over to us right away and said ""is everything okay over here?"" This was a very odd way to greet a couple who had literally just been seated. We replied yes. He asked if we were ready to order. We'd been there less than 5 min so we said no. We placed our drink orders and asked for a few more min to review the menu. This was a mistake! Almost 15 min went by before our waiter came back to take our order. We had even closed our menus hoping he'd see we were ready to order. He was attending to other tables right near us. He finally took our order. Another several min went by before someone brought bread to our table. As we ate the yummy bread and waited for our food, we caught wind of an unsatisfied couple right next to us. They seemed to be making quite a fit about some cucumbers and arugula being left off. The manager was at their table trying to smooth it over. Perhaps this is why the waiter in my area seemed off... Our food arrived finally. I ordered the mushroom burger with a salad. My bf ordered the chicken avocado club. Our food was very good. I got a side of ranch to dip my burger in and it was tasty. As we ate, the snobby couple next to us continued to be a pain. The manager ended up re-making their food to-go for them to make up for the mistake. The couple continued to sit at their table even after checking out. Awkward!! I was about half way through my food when they finally got up to leave. As they left I hear the girl say ""this is hysterical that they re-made our food!"" The Summerlin snobs left and mood quickly went from tense to peaceful. 

In conclusion, my experience today was just alright. My server was inattentive and overall a bit off. The Summerlin snobs complaining only made it worse. I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory before and have had great service. This time not so much. If you choose to eat at this location, just beware of the Summerlin snobs. I warned you. If you have an issue with your order, please tell the waiter/waitress quietly otherwise it is unnecessarily disruptive to those around you.

1555151,2013-12-30,7,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"WARNING: CHEESECAKE FACTORY DOES NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS, SO PREPARE TO WAIT AT THEIR MERCY. On a late December 2013 night at Boca Park Cheesecake Factory, we were welcomed by shrieking toddlers (the kind of piercing, high-decibel sound that raises blood-pressure among the most minimally sentient humans) and boys big enough to know better who were treating the waiting area like a playground and endangering anyone who enters the place. There ought to have been some professional supervision to protect the other customers from those rowdy rascals. Our dinner companions chose to wait the forty minutes for a table--but outside, so that we could avoid the wanton pandemonium inside the restaurant. We had one good experience at this location a few months ago, thus figured that it was worth the wait. IT WAS NOT.


Our waiter was pleasant enough, but we had to constantly ask him for water-refills and he did not offer freshly-ground pepper to me for the infinitesimally small sirloin steak ""culotte"", though he did so for my sister's Caesar salad. Spotty at best was the waiter's service, and after we finished our entrees, the fellow waited a full hour before presenting us with the dessert menu. The bread basket held something white, and I inquired whether or not it was sourdough, with which I have been familiar  all my life. The waiter said ""yes"". Upon tasting it, one could not detect a single sour note, and this eatery-chain is based in California, where sourdough bread is ubiquitous! I was disgusted by the formerly frozen, inadequately cooked ""French fries"" that came with my pee-wee steak, and its two substandard onion rings. There was a paper cup on the plate that contained ketchup, of all things. Had the waiter returned, I would have asked for a suitable condiment (give the dish a French name, and you had better include Dijon mustard, not the risible, flavor-masking ketchup). The fries were ""immangeable"", to use a derogatory French word that means ""inedible"". And at around twenty-five bucks, a microscopic, pathetically thin steak is an insult to anyone with a sense of proportion. There was one high note on the table: an appetizer called Buffalo Blasters. Without them, I may have gone hungry--oh, the irony in a place with one of the longest menus in creation.


My husband had the usually fail-safe dish, fettuccine Alfredo. He perceived that the noodles were old or reheated. I noticed that the ""sauce"" was too thin to adhere to the pasta, and that the dish had been inappropriately infused with raw garlic, a vile act which constitutes sabotage. We detest the stinking tuber, and would never order such a thing knowingly.  It's a crime to call a dish ""Fettuccine Alfredo"", which NEVER had garlic in it, and turn the unsuspecting customer into this week's Garlic Clown, who has people running helter-skelter from his reeking person. An honest name for the concoction would be, ""Noodles in Raw Garlic Soup with a Hint of Cheese"". You cannot bastardize a recipe this way! Poor Chef Alfredo of Rome--his recipe has become a clown show in a bowl.

A slice of chocolate mousse layer-cake was dry, heavy and seemed days-old. My cappuccino was lukewarm upon arrival. The only positive thing about the evening at Cheesecake Factory of Boca Park was the company at our table. I submit mostly five-star reviews here at Yelp; because I don't like to shoot at ambulances, I refrain from offering negative reports. However, when a huge chain restaurant serves factory-food at boutique prices, I am duty-bound to say so. And when one looks longingly at a Jack in the Box sign on the drive home after dinner, something is very wrong.",FhmErJANfSlct6DbmYnJWg,10,7,1,3I3CS8fS1T7IxnVohqYLVw

It's all too easy for National chains to slip into mediocrity (my fave eatery phrase). Many start with ideals of quality, sourcing, and customer care, and get shoddy over the years. Not so for the Cheesecake Factory. Year after year, ingredient quality, service and food prep stay at a superb level.

Tonight: Sheila's chicken and avocado salad. The greens were super-fresh and included chicory, arugula, and baby spinach. Crispy won-tons (I removed mine), cashews, moist breast slices, perfectly ripe avo's, and a few other items rounded things off. As a carb-conscious diner with a healthy appetite, this dish was most satisfying.

In the past, I've also enjoyed the Asian chicken salad, grilled salmon with mashed (ok, it was a carb-splurge day ;) and 3-4 other dishes I can't recall.

Their managers are even gracious if there's ever an issue.

Started out with Stuffed Mushrooms. I have had these with clam or sausage before...but these had a blend of cheese, garlic and herbs in a wine sauce. We got 6 with the order and they did not last long. I used some of the bread that was brought to the table to soak up the last bit of the wine sauce. 

For dinner I had a Macaroni & Cheese Burger. This was a risky choice...I knew I would either love it or hate it. The burger had fried macaroni balls and cheese sauce on it. I asked them to leave the veggies off my burger this time because I did not know if fried mac & cheese and tomatoes, onion or lettuce go good together or not. The burger was very cheesy and I enjoyed it. The fries it came with were hot and good. The side of ranch I requested was nasty though. It does not even taste like ranch but something bitter and gross and the color was more clear than white. My wife had half of a chicken salad sandwich and cup of tortilla soup.

3 stars for the Service from last visit.

I only find myself coming here to the cheesecake factory for mainly three things cheesecake, the Thai Lettuce Wraps on the appetizers menu and the Miso Glazed Salmon dish. Every time I come here, I try a dish that I haven't had here before and always leave disappointed. 

When you order the lettuce wraps, on the plate comes ice burg lettuce cups, three different sauces, chicken, and veggies and you build your own wrap. Its good and enjoyable to make yourself. Plus not everyone likes the same sauces and whatnot so they have the choice of what they want. 

The Miso Glazed Salmon is served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a side of cooked asparagus. The perfect combination if you ask me, and if you are there at lunch time you have the option of ordering the 1/2 order since the dinner size is really big. But my recent order was the taco salad. it wasn't anything special but shredded lettuce, strips of seasoned tortilla chips tomatoes and avocado tossed in a mayo chipotle dressing and served as three heaping HILLS on your plate. Really? I paid $13 for this dish, something i could've made at home...was disappointed to say the least.

I have tried a variety of their cheesecakes and the newest to my top list is the Pineapple upside down cake. The pineapple and crust is at the bottom and the cream cheese itself has a pineapple's flavor to it. Not so sweet, but just a perfect blend so you can enjoy it rather than having to take a sip of water between every bite. 

The service from a recent visit i have gone was lacking. We were there in a group of four at most, yet have been seated after bigger groups whom arrived AFTER us has been seated. When i questioned the hostess  about it, she simply stated its easier to group the couples and bigger groups first when the room becomes available what are we??? Aside from that, it almost seemed as if the other waiters are more useful and punctual than our own waiter. we had to flag down a waiter from another table because the person waiting us can't be found. This was the first time that I have experienced such bad service. BUT, the service is usually really good and waiters are on their game.

Overall, the atmosphere is nice and busy, friendly and you can enjoy your meal either outside or inside-they give you the option. The price is nothing to complain about since the servings are big enough, and the food isn't lacking in flavor.

Based on my experience from yesterday, I had to give them four, instead of five stars. We were told there was a 40 minute wait, which seemed to be pretty accurate. I noticed that they wasted a lot of time, and energy on trying to find 4 or 5 parties who had obviously left. On several occasions they walked through the bar, waiting area, and exterior of the restaurant calling these people's names. A more efficient way of handling it would be to activate the buzzer, walk through once or twice calling their names, then move on. I felt our server wasn't very friendly, and a bit slow.

This time around i""m with my wife and 4 year old son. After we ordered our drinks we received our complimentary bread. Our server brought out my son his own small bread plate with sliced bananas. Thought that was excellent, never seen that before!

We both had separate chicken dishes. They wete ordered and in no time, on a Friday night they were at our table. I'd say they were faster than Jimmy John's. We split with our son and he gobbled it all up. She had the chicken picata an I had the chicken marsala. Both were fantastic. 

Now time for dessert. Cheesecake Factory is famous for what? Their Cheesecake!!! Oh my, decision, decision, decision! There is just so much how can 1 person plus a 4 yeat old decide? Seems I'm sharing with my son so he'll decide. 

So it's decided, the Chocolate Tower Truffle Cake. The cake was enormous so we split it amongst us. The only thing i didn't really care for was the whipped cream. It had a blan taste but overall it was fantastic. 

Our server was great. He was busy however he went above my expectations. Food was great and served quickly. Our drinks were refreshed even when we didn't ask. 

I think 1 thing they could improve on is the lighting. We sat in a part of the restaurant that the overhead lights were high in the ceiling which made it hard to read the menu.

BUSY! [Which didn't shock me.. because every time I come across a Cheesecake Factory, it always seems to be busy!]

anyway, it's a nice looking place in a nice area with plenty of parking and seats to sit down outside because it's always obviously busy.   
we were seated within the 20 minute time frame that they gave us.. which was understandable because we were a big party.  it is a shopping mall so there's a little bit of window shops to look at while you wait.  

we were finally seated and it seemed well kept... and for how busy it seemed it's a pretty good job they do of keeping this place up.   It's a large restaurant with lots of seating and lots of patrons.  Idk, I'm not big on the large crowds and large places so I guess that's why this review pretty much sucks.

anyway, the menu is LARGE.  I use the word overwhelming a lot, but this menu is truly overwhelming.  there's like.. 2,000 things on this menu.  luckily everything had a description.

so I had the Factory Burrito Grande.  nothing special about it... typical.  only it was huge.... like the size of a baby huge. 

the cheesecake I have to admit was really good.  they were huge pieces and the waiter let us know that so we didn't go all out and order 1 slice per person.   the slice was seriously good enough for 4 people.  they were huge... but very good. 

eh... it's not a first choice for me.  i like small dives and secrets.  i don't know.. it was just alright. sorry.  again, this review sucks and i don't care cause i don't think i'll ever take a drive to this place ever again anyway.  so thanks for the baby burrito.",Nw6Jza_cb0aqd4PT769Vzw,0,0,2,0LeAcNFSzwUj8WPpZ-oJ6w

It was my mom's birthday yesterday, so after leaving the strip, we decided that she needed some sort of ""cake"" on her birthday!  It was 10:30pm (they close at 11pm) and I pulled into Cheesecake Factory. 

We were sat at a nice table and they gave us a full menu and offered to bring out bread.  We told them we were only having dessert. (but nice to know that they continue serving the full menu until close!)

My mom picked the Chocolate Raspberry Truffle cheesecake and I had the Adam's Peanut Butter Cup Fudge Ripple cheesecake.

I found the waiter and let him know that it was my mom's birthday.  They came out with ""Happy Birthday Lisa"" written on the plate in chocolate, a candle and sang ""Happy Birthday To You"".  It was very nicely done!

The cheesecake was delicious (took some home for later!).  The service was great- he refilled our water and decaf coffee very promptly.

Showed up at 4:15pm on a Wednesday. We were seated within 5 minutes for a party of 6. I went to the Restroom upon arrival and it was a mess. Also there was only 1 stall with toilet paper.

Drink orders came along and I asked oir server Tara G what they had for tequila. I was told Patron. I asked if there were other silver options and was told no, just Patron. I passed and went to the bar to order instead. Come to find out there was 4 options of silver tequila. Don Julio & Patron being the most expensive naturally. 

We wanted to order appetizer, but after recieving our drinks our waiter took too long to return to our table. We ended up just ordering our entrees.

I asked if my dish the Diane and Salmon came with asparagas and was told no, so i ordered some on the side. The dish comes out and there is asparagus with it, and a side of asparagas as well [which of course I had to pay extra for]. 

My sister ordered the chinese chicken salad. The salad came dry with no oranges.  I noticed the food runner come out and have a conversation with out waiter where they looked at the food delivered to our table. It seemed as if they realized the wrong salad was delivered, but upon us questioning it we were told no thats what you ordered. At this point we just asked for a side of dressing and oranges.

So we all order and then wait for our food. I expected there to be a long wait but it was pretty quick. Everyone gets their food but my grandma. Also, I realized I got the wrong burger. When our server comes back, he apologizes and says he will get those out right away. 20 minutes later, me and grandma still have no food. Everyone else is pretty much done eating at this point. Finally our food shows up, and by this time my appetite is gone so I take everything to go. We also ordered cheesecake, because duh.

It was a wonderful night & a great experience, thanks to our server... I have to call the restaurant & get her name as that is something I many times fall short about... Names:( 

So I called her ""Blue Eyes"" during our dinner experience as she is a brown haired girl with brilliant blue eyes. She was very good natured... She smiled and laughed when I called her that and seemed to be ok with my nickname.  ""Blue Eyes"" arrived at our table immediately after we were seated & she took our beverage order... She was very welcoming & understanding as we explained that we were waiting for one more person who was joining us for dinner. So many times, servers can be put off by this... ""Blue Eyes"" was not having any issue with us having a late addition to our table.  

After we enjoyed our first adult beverage, which was delivered to us exactly as ordered... I decided that for my next beverage, I would prefer mine without ice.  ""Blue Eyes"" was so pleasant and non-resistant.  She brought my drink out exactly as I had requested it. She was helpful & conversational, while respecting our privacy.  She made great suggestions and was so encouraging about several fished which we asked about.  

The kale salad was scrumptious!!! We also ordered the Thai lettuce chicken platter. It is a Taste Blast and we actually ordered a second portion.  Bang Bang Shrimp/Chicken is always sensational here, but we were stuffed and did not have any room for more food! 

An ahi tuna carpaccio was another delightful, tasty treat.  Whatever sauce they used was lavished on top with some beautiful slices of avocado & cucumber thinly sliced on the side. 

Desert was of course cheesecake... I know the many flavors of cheesecake are supposed to delight me... This was chocolate & not my taste, although everyone else loved it.  Me... I Love their plain New York type cheesecake with some cherries or strawberries on top.  Yum classically delicious. 

We had a Lovely time and I will post this as soon as I find out the name of our server who we will ask for when we return to this great local restaurant. 

Ahhhhhh.... Her name is a Mystery... I called there & the hostess who answered the phone was zero help.  My bad for not getting her name:(",Dkb-TJFNSWl4PYR8wEcWcw,2,2,5,yqAUxJGjP-IWPbTcXf28hA

We came during the day at around 2:30 to 3 on a Monday. I was surprised that there was a wait time of about 15 minutes. We were seated with our party of 3 at that time. 

The bread was delicious and the waitress seemed nice. I got what I always got the chicken fettuccine Alfredo , my 5 year old got the corn dogs and my cousin has ordered the Philly cheesesteak. Everything was going good until waiting for the food. It was literally a good 36 minute wait time for the food and we didn't see the waitress at all during this time. The waiter at the table next to us told his frustrated customers that the kitchen was backed up. 

We eventually got our food. It was delicious but I never got my Parmesan cheese. This is one of my favorite parts, it had crossed my mind the maybe they did not do this anymore but the person at the table next to us had been asked and received some. We didn't see our waitress again for a very long time. It was very frustrating because of the time it had taken to receive our food my 5 year old was already restless and I was already ready to order dessert and get the check but took forever for her to arrive.  We had even asked eachother if it would even be worth it to order enough thing because of how much time it was taking for the simple things like asking for a refill or anything it was another 15 minutes 

The cheesecake I always receive... The original was drenched with sour cream topping ... It was gross. Normally they have just enough to taste with the whip cream but this thing was covered in it. We took a few bites and left it . 

I'm so disappointed because as I did this is my favorite place. One of the best things being the service and food and both things were a disappointment this time .",uvkN1gf9VyVArxB-8qAaoQ,3,1,3,OHIpET--xlyaTCt4geEXHA

This time it was very sour and weird. The manager not only took off the item from our bill but gave us a gift card to come back next time as an apology.

2375046,2017-08-01,0,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"I came here 2 days in a row for national cheesecake day and half price cheesecake. I was going to write my review Sunday, but I'm glad I waited because my Sunday experience was HORRIBLE, like 2 star bad, but my Monday experience was great, 5 star great. I averaged them out to give this review. 

Sunday: We came in for cheesecake, but since we had to dine in, we git some breakfast that I didn't know they served on Sundays. The service we got the whole time was absolutely horrible. There weren't many people there when we got there so we didn't wait long to be seated. She brought us water and that was about it. The rest of the time we had to keep flagging her down to get anything from her. It took 15 minutes to get our coffee and actually order our food. Then she never came back. It took 30 minutes before we could flag her down to actually get us some bread that we had to actually ask for when everybody else was just given their bread. She was definitely not off to a good start. She kept going back and forth to the table next to us, giving them stuff and checking on them, but never came to us, unless we actually flagged her down and yelled for her. To me, that's not acceptable customer service. It almost made us not ever want to come back here. Only reason we came back, was to get more half price cheesecake the next day. We made sure we weren't going to get her the next day again, by sitting at the bar on Monday.

Monday: We strictly went to the bar in hopes we'd get better service. We certainly did. We initially came for happy hour drinks and cheesecake, but ended up ordering some appetizers for dinner since the happy hour menu is pretty cheap. Thank god we had good service at the bar or we probably never would've went back. Our bartender was always checking on us to see if we needed anything, constantly refilling our drinks, conversating with us, after everybody was taken care of. We even got our bread this time right away and didn't even have to ask for it. And to top it off, we got great service during happy hour when the whole place was packed and every seat was taken. 

Now, onto the actual food. 

For breakfast, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles Benedict and the chilaquiles carnitas. I really enjoyed the Benedict. It definitely had a unique sweet flavor that I wasn't expecting, but it was delicious. The carnitas was a bed of tortilla chips with a green chilli pork mix over them. I wasn't a fan of them, but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We also ordered their new cheesecakes: the celebration cheesecake and the coffee and cream cheesecake. The celebration one wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was SUPER sweet. My complaint is that there was very little cheesecake in it. It was almost all cake and a cream mousse stuff. I was hoping it was going to be majority cheesecake, but it wasn't. I can't say that is order it again. The coffee and cream one, was very chocolatey with coffee. If you like those two flavors, you'll like that cheesecake. 

For happy hour, I started off with the JW pink lemonade that was pretty good. We ordered 3 appetizers to share: Vietnamese shrimp summer rolls, factory nachos and the buffalo blasts. They were all great. You won't be disappointed with any of them. They are pretty big servings so be careful how much you order. We couldn't even finish the nachos. Then we ordered cheesecake to go because there was no way we had room to eat there. We got the chocolate hazelnut crunch, Chris' outrageous, mango key lime and Reeses peanut butter. I didn't like Chris' because I don't like coconut or walnuts, but if you like them and almond joy, you'll love that one. My boyfriend loved it so much, he ate the whole thing in one sitting. I really enjoyed the other three tho. The hazelnut crunch is really good. The Reeses is really rich, but great if you like chocolate and peanut butter. The mango cheesecake us really tart, but great if you like those flavors.",uT88e0NuTpxcqcv3cAyUKA,2,1,4,eviHVaJ1DxvyzNIR4eu2Zw

I was trying to be ""healthy"" so ordered the Santa Fe Salad.  What was I thinking?  McDonald's makes a really good Santa Fe salad with breaded chicken (probably totally not healthy).  I actually kinda love it, though I don't go to McDs often. I was hoping TCF, with their reputation, would have a version just as good. But no, it was just what I imagine a ""healthy"" salad being.  Lackluster in flavor with not much to recommend it other than the fact that it was relatively healthy.

My sis had the apple pork chops.  She really liked it, though I personally am not a fan of sweet savory.  The mashed potatoes were excellent, which I remember from my visit 15 years ago.

My brother-in-law had the Davinci pasta dish, which is one of the 2 dishes they said they almost always order (the other being the shrimp scampi).  I only had a taste but my god, that was good!  It really didn't look like much because the sauce seemed fairly light, but the flavor was amazing. 

Cheesecake tiramisu. Drool.  I like cheesecake and I like tiramisu but I don't generally love either.  I LOVED the cheesecake tiramisu.  Fluffy and light, all 3 of us agreed this was utterly delicious.

Tonight Im starting with a glass of Prosecco. It's not as sweet as I would like so totally not ordering THIS again... I told our server I didn't like it and she was just kind of like Ooohkay... 
We start with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and their complimentary table bread served with little pats of cold butter. It would be better if the butter was actually spreadable but whatevez. The soup is in an ENORMOUS bowl and pretty tasty. We ate about half and had the rest packed up.
Chicken Chipotle Pasta for me it is! SO delish!! Perfect amount of spiciness that doesnt take away from the flavor of the dish - I love all the veggies mixed in with the pasta too along with the tortilla strips. I could probably just drink the sauce and be totally satisfied. Twice in the past I have tried a different pasta only to be disappointed so I'm just gonna stick with this WINNER! 
Hunnie Bunnie is getting her Bow Tie Pasta in Marina Sauce (meatless) and she obviously loves it - she says it is her FAVORITE!

The service was awesome. I don't remember his name but it's guys like our server that make dining experiences memorable. 

My friend had a Kobe burger that was cooked just as she ordered it. The cooks even cut it in half for her as per her request.

The evening started seemingly ok.  The hostess took our name, said the wait would be 20 minutes and then handed us a beeper.  When 30 minutes past I went back up to ask where we were in the line.  She stated that she called us, which was impossible since we were sitting on the bench next to her stand.  Also, the beeper never went off so that onto itself was a lie.  Why give one to us a beeper if you aren't going to use it?  

We sat down and our waitress seemed very nice (probably the only employee I didn't mind).  My boyfriend and I ordered our food but for some reason the food runner only brought out his food.  I sat and waited for a bit but then our waitress looked at my empty place setting and stormed off.  She came out immediately after with my food.  At the end of the meal, we ordered a slice of cheesecake to have at the restaurant but the food runner gave us our cheesecake in a ""to go"" box.  Our waitress again looked angry.  

Lastly, today I opened my box of leftover pasta to find that my boyfriend's jalapeno peppers were mixed in with it.

It was exactly what we expect from the Cheesecake Factory.... consistent with all the other Cheesecake Factories I had been to. Don't get me wrong... my family and I LOVE the Cheesecake Factory. It's a guilty pleasure.... 

The things that irked me about this particular location:

1.  Parking: what a pain! luckily they had valet (which we used...awesome!) however we had a large party and one family had a baby and i KNOW they parked uber far and had to carry the infant seat and everything....

2.  Service: what a nightmare.  I don't even know our server's name.  All I remember is she was blond, and short (not in stature, but attitude-wise).  Granted we had a large party (13 people) ... uh oh... here's where i go off on a rant.




So we had a large party.  It was my (pregnant) sister-in-law's birthday. We had 3 children with us 10 adults... we all arrived within 10 minutes.  We had asked the server to wait until we were all here to start taking orders.... but she didn't feel that was a good idea.  I personally felt that we got the short end of the stick because we were a large party and she felt she did not have to give us good service because she was already getting auto-gratted.  Boo on her.  Tip karma forces my boyfriend (who picked up the tab that night) to automatically tip AT LEAST 25 percent (instead of the, what, 18 percent auto gratuity on parties of 6 or more?)

anywho, drinks came out staggered. menus came out staggered.  food came out staggered.... all because the server did not want to wait the few minutes for all of us to be seated and get situated.  rawr.

and on top of that, some rude lady in a near by booth kept shushing the 2 4-year olds with us (one being my daughter) and shooting dirty looks my way. lucky for her my parents taught me to respect my ugly... i mean elders.

That all being said (please excuse my poor grammar/run-on sentences)...

bottom line:  food was consistent with every other cheesecake factory out there (yay for avocado eggrolls and THE BEST fried mac and cheese in the world) but the service was shoddy (really though, WHY would you bring out dessert for everyone else and then make the 2 restless 4-year old girls wait 10 more minutes for theirs? who does that?!?)

Our first server seemed nice at first,  but was forgetful about our drinks.  I guess there was a shift change because a new woman introduced herself as our new waiter.  She was not much better.  She seemed very attentive to her four top to our ""miesly"" 2 top.  Then a waitress by the name of Amanda noticed that we were trying to get our servers attention. She was quick, helpful and attentive to our needs. Getting us our 20 min waters in seconds and sharing her story of her new life in vegas and being employed at cheesecake only a month(and killing it).

The service staff here at the Boca Park location is 90% great but today was extraordinary. Even after our server got sat another table after us and a party of 10 at the same time, our experience was never sacrificed.

Tonight we ordered iced green tea with mint, the chicken marsala and chipotle chicken pasta but we substituted the pasta for mashed potatoes. And for dessert we shared a lemon, strawberry cheesecake. 
Chicken marsala is 2 thin pieces of chicken in a homemade marsala sauce with a generous portion of mushrooms. This is served on a bed of bow tie pasta. The chipotle chicken pasta is a flavorful dish with asparagus, peas and chicken in a warm chipotle sauce. It's not spicy and does not lack in flavor. The portion of chicken is on the lighter side though. All entrees are served with both sourdough and wheat bread with butter at the beginning of your meal too.
There are so many desserts to choose from but tonight we went with one on the fruity side. It wasn't too sweet or too tart. I was actually surprised how balanced the flavors were.",1he_r7kQnK5MXOYqXD-Gkg,2,1,5,BTQ6N4iFtCWirLfIxLNxJg

The Cheesecake Factory has fallen to a very low point! This is one of my favorite places and sharing this story is disappointing but necessary. 

A friend and I had lunch there Super Bowl Sunday and were excited to enjoy the game. She ordered a salad and I ordered the Pasta Napoletana....BIG MISTAKE! I enjoyed the meal only to get home and suffer a night of hell!! The undercooked pork sent me to the bathroom where I remained for hours, throwing up and ultimately becoming completely dehydrated.

In an effort to make management aware, I called the Rampart location and spoke to the manager. Right away, I knew this was a very young and inexperienced person, he was defensive and said that I was the only person to complain. This child concluded the conversation by stating that the Corporate Office would contact me. That was days ago..... I'm not holding my breath.

The most frustrating part is that my call to the restaurant WAS NOT to complain, but to give management a heads up so that they could check their ingredients and mention this incident to staff in the hopes of preventing a reoccurrence. They basically blew me off, so they clearly don't give a damn about your health either. Word to the wise..... you've been warned.",WglDqOc6LKFB7VAkmM1jsw,0,1,1,JLkusuMHso3JAtIUxrQXcg

It's always important to save room for the cheesecake though. My personal favorite is their Ultimate Red Velvet Cheesecake. It doesn't get much more satisfying than that.

I know this is a really short review, but the food is excellent, the service is top notch, and the ambiance is fantastic.

Ordered the herb crusted salmon, served with fresh mashed potatoes and a few tasteful displayed spears of asparagus. It was really great! Cooked perfectly, light tender and moist. My friend ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta (OK, not so light for him, but he loved it!)

Can you say Great Tip '-) For these nachos to be just an appetizer you can easily share with another person. If you're like me and want to take advantage of the entire happy hour menu grab some friends and order everything on the menu. Ball out! My suggestion would be to go not right at 4PM which is the start of happy hour because finding a table top or even a table in the bar area is competitive. You literally have people preying on these tables waiting for people to get up so they can swoop on in like a hawk haha. I arrived around 5:15 PM which is when the first greedy crowd is about ready to wrap it on up!. After about 3 long island ice tea's in and pigging out on the spinach dip, crab dip, wontons, sliders, and nachos it was my time to GO! Thanks to the Summerlin team I now can add another happy hour spot to my list! Their runner up (Kona Grill) is walking distance and has a fantastic happy hour as well!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,4,4,4,UtjM7bG0nT2Kwhv00KVzPg

The atmosphere and layout are similar to other Cheesecake Factories, and of course, the menu is the same. Let me pause for a moment and talk about the menu- it's big, with what seems like an endless array of menu items spanning across the globe in terms of cuisines. What's nice about the extensive menu is you can try something new every time you visit (that is, if you don't go everyday), but what's not so nice about the menu is the time it takes to make a decision about what to eat. 

Anyways, after being seated, complimentary bread was brought to our table. We had two choices of bread- a soft brown bread with oats on top (Could it be Pumpernickel or Honey Oat?) and a sourdough baguette.  After perusing the menu, I decided to order the Soup of the Day, which was a Lentil Soup with an infusion of bacon essence. Even though there were hardly any customers, it took a long time before our food came out, leaving me no choice but to eat a lot of the bread. By the time my soup came out, I was already full, but I managed to finish most of the soup. The soup itself was very hearty and chunky with lots of lentils, reminiscent of porridge. The flavors were good, but the bacon flavor that the server emphasized was not vey noticeable. Overall, I enjoyed my visit. Portions are large, prices are reasonable, the cheesecakes are good, and there's something for everybody, which I think are the main reasons for why Cheesecake Factory is so popular.",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,3,1,3,wevZ0mCF67o3CnKDlsXjhA

The food ordering and preparation were timely.
The Crispy Chicken Costoletta consists of 3 breaded breasts sauteed and served with a lemon sauce, mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus. The 3 large breasts were tender and juicy with a crispy panko style breading. This was 1 meal for 2 people or 2 meals.

The Jamaican Black Pepper Shrimp was sauteed with a spicy pepper sauce.  The entree is served with a choice of white or brown rice, along with black beans, plantains, and a cool mango sauce. The plantains were crispy outside and soft on the inside. The generous portion of shrimps were moderately spicy but not overwhelming. The cool mango was a nice contrast to the spicy shrimp.

The table we were seated at was filthy and there were leaves in my table setting. The server was manic and obviously under trained and over worked. Long story short drinks (not from the bar) took 15 minutes to get to our table, we had to ask for a sugar caddy 4 times, and we didn't see our entrees until 50 minutes later. The manager was condescending when he brought our food because of the obvious disaster. He stated that he thought we had only been waiting 24 minutes! Basically calling my boyfriend a liar.

Our absolute favorite dish is the ""bang bang chicken and shrimp.""

It consists of a mound of rice, surrounded by mild curry with chicken and shrimp sieging  the mound.  You could easily order one serving and share between the two of you, but it is so good that we order one each!  It makes for a good leftover lunch the next day.

The service is absolutely amazing.  The last time we went, had a waiter named Marty and he took care of us and went out of his way to make sure that we were had a great time.

I recommend getting the strawberry lemonade.  A bottomless glass of bursting flavor is what you will get.  Highly addictive and now that I am writing this review, I long for another.

You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory without taking advantage of its namesake!  Our choices for desert are:

- The Banana Cream Cheesecake
- White Chocolate Caramel Macadamia Nut Cheesecake

3268013,2013-12-21,2,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"Cheesecake factory, one of my favorite spots and very popular among my friends. 

This time around was last thursday 12/12/13 and our server was Shawn M. dinner time

we had a good size group about 12 people total. They sat us with 8 because the rest of our group would take some time.

Starting with the food. I am an impulse kind of guy, i like to try new things but don't like deciding. This time i actually saw a picture of the dish i got on a screen above the bakery counter. I got the steak Diane. med rare super tender and flavorfull. with potatoes. I also tried some of the caesar salad. Both amazing and up to par for cheesecake factory.

We got sat and we were starving. our waiter came over explained the specials as they usually do. We were very thirsty and asked for water. He claimed he was not taking drinks right now he will just explain the specials and come back in a few minutes. Something im not really used to hearing as we all just wanted water. I am myself a server so i tried to be understanding. When he did come back a few minutes later. we gave our drink orders mostly water. My girl said we ready to order too when you are. He explained ""ok well im just gonna take the drinks now until the rest of your group gets here give me a minute"". The tone was very unfriendly to me and my entire group. It was obvious he knew we were a gratuity table and since we were young did not care to go above and beyond to get the little extra that cheesecake servers usually give. At this point i started to pay attention to him. Noticing which tables he was responsible for, how many were seated etc etc. this just justified the fact that yes we were a gratuity table of kids to him and so he did not care as much as he did his other tables. When he came back i decided to speak up as the rest of my group were kinda annoyed. I explained clear we are ready to order when you are, the rest of our group will not be here for awhile. This is after about 15 minutes of us being seated already. an estimate of about 35 minutes until we finally started receiving our food. Not ideal but nothing we could do at this point. My water specifically was refilled only twice, i drink a lot of water, and less than half way through my meal i was done. and didn't get a refill until i was done with my meal. Then once more AFTER i received my split check at which point i no longer needed a refill.

Order taken food arriving and the rest of our group showed up. 

this part annoyed me the most, he explained to our friends that just arrived ""yeah they didn't wait for you guys so let me know when your ready to order"". Little does this server know we explained that to them already and they are the ones who told us to order because they would not be there for awhile.

This is something i am not used to at cheesecake factory. This particular server definitely did not start us off right. i am sure that the rest of my group might not understand why. But as a management myself i know when a server notices a young gratuity table and does not care to meet minimum standards of service. We were his only large table and from what i could see he was not so overwhelmed that he could not care to give us the service he was giving others. Where as his smaller tables got lots of time and attention.

Night ended and he put us all on one check. Someone asked to have it split and he did so. Thing was he knew pretty much exactly what everyone had. The time it took for him to bring us the split checks, and cash us out was definitely inattentive. We were actually trying to meet our next destination at a certain time but ended up not going because we were waiting for him to cash out our checks. We got the first check at 22:13 and my check personally was not checked out till about 22:33 per my receipts. 

with this series of bad events and lack of care for a young gratuity table. that is why 3 stars.

My only advice is if you have a large group try your best not to have this server. 

automatic gratuity is necessary but should never be an excuse for poor service at a restaurant known for service.",xIfaUaUW1rvoQaVAJH2vRg,4,1,3,Y3sqC25QY6Ov7o0BrfzmhA

This place is all things to all people but they are far different than these other establishments that try to please everyone. The other places lack in quality because they are trying too hard to offer too many mediocre dishes. This place has both quantity of menu items to choose from and they are prepared with quality as well.

Although your Vietnamese spring rolls or your sweet corm tamales aren't the most authentic you've ever had, they are pretty darn tasty. And I don't know about y'all but I'll take tasty over authenticity anytime. That's why I'm the only Asian you'll see at PF Chang's. Haha.

Today I was there for my friends bday. I just started eating clean--so to speak, so I ordered the most compliant item I could find and that was the Kobe burger. It had three ingredients. Very basic and consisting of: tomato, mushrooms, and grilled onion. I got it protein style of course. I normally would never, ever order a burger without cheese but I had to this time. For how plain it was I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was Sofa King good! So flavorful with juices dripping out from the wrapper. I was not embarrassed to be heard slurping that stuff up. Not gonna waste any of that tasty burger grease. But please people, don't order a Kobe burger if it's gonna be hotter than med-rare. That's just a waste of good meat. If you're scared of a little pink in the middle, stick to your fast food burger joints. 

And of course...who doesn't order a cheesecake when they're at CCF? Me. Whomp, whomp. I had to stick with the bowl of strawberries. But for those that are not on a primal aka caveman aka paleo diet, they have just about any type of decadent combinations a (non-pregnant) person could think of.

Once seated, we ordered the avocado egg rolls as a starter. Always a solid appetizer; though the sweet tamarind sauce might be an acquired taste for some. For my entree I ordered the grilled chicken tostada salad. When it arrived, I noticed it was missing the side of vinaigrette dressing, as well as the avocado cream and sour cream. It was unfortunate that our waitress had to make two visits to retrieve the missing items. The salad was quite huge and could easily be shared between two people.

I picked out a cheesecake and the hostess said that they would decorate the plate and send it out with a candle at the end of our meal. She said she would pass the message along to the server. I saw her write everything down.

The server was friendly and greeted us in a timely manner. He went over the soup of the day as well as daily specials. We ordered the Eggroll sampler, all the egg rolls were greasy and dripping with oil. The chicken madeira was excellent as usual. And the herb crusted salmon was okay. 

When we were full, the server was kind enough to pack our food for us, but he failed to crumb the table and left our dirty silverware and small plates in the middle of the table. I even moved everything to the middle of the table so it would be easy for him to pick up because I knew he would be bringing our cheesecake out and I wanted to take photos. At the end of lunch, the server handed us dessert menus, I gave him the eye. He said 'I got it'... and brought a cheap birthday sundae with pure whip cream. He put it right in the middle of all the dirty dishes. That really ruined it for me. The Cheesecake Factory is my FAVORITE RESTAURANT.. or should I say WAS. To be honest, the service 15 years ago was significantly better than the service I've received within these past few years.. especially at the Summerlin location. How can you drop dessert on a table with dirty plates and food crumbs everywhere?? I'd like to add that it was not even busy. And where was the cheesecake I preordered that the hostess said they were going to decorate for our special occasion?

I have over 20 years of restaurant/hospitality experience, so yes! I am a restaurant/service snob! So maybe my service expectations are too high.. but I wouldn't expect anything else from the Cheesecake Factory. I am truly disappointed in my recent experiences with your establishment. A few years ago a  server refilled my water with another water cup saying she couldn't find any water pitchers anywhere... only at the Summerlin location I get this kind of service!",kVW0fonbaswPAh9yLQNQUQ,0,0,2,ZwFRfhkIs0-R2b6WuxWSMg

I really was blown away by the level of horrible service we received, I barely even know where to start. First it took probably 20-30 minutes for our drinks to come (iced tea!). Even longer for the bread. When ordering, my mother was making sure her meal came with chicken and the waiter, in a disrespectful and condescending tone said, ""of course it comes with chicken, it's in the name."" When my mother pointed out it does not say chicken in the name he continued to argue with her. I can't even tell you how long it took for our actual meals to come out and when they did my friends order was wrong and mine, being the last one out, finally came when everyone in my party was done eating!! Before my sandwich finally came one of the managers came to sort of apologize and quickly left our table before we could even express our unhappiness. The final straw was when our waiter was clearly trying to be rid of us, moving too quickly to hand us boxes and our boxed up cheesecake, he knocked over my half drunk (overly expensive) drink all over my phone and all down the front of me. He barely apologized for this and rushed off. 

I really never complain let alone post anything like this but the service we received today was totally unacceptable and I will not be returning to this location. If I could I would have given this location zero stars.",pJHM1MVazymi1k6OY_wTHQ,2,1,1,fCa9VAhgNbXoGcSP4AXsGQ

To start with our server, Shannon D, I think she doesn't like her job. A server myself, we got not enough attention from her and she didn't stop by to ask how aour food was tasting. Cause I sure had a problem with our calamari that were not so good. I have no idea what the kitchen did, that half of them were sticking together in a big clump and they seamed not cleaned the right way, too.
Our server was more concerned how much tips she made from the big party that was right across from us, then taking a little more care on the other guest. My dink was empty for a while and it was sure not that busy, cause the big party already left. By the way, if you iron your shirt and pants, you might look a little more professional, then looking crumbled up from head to toe. It's not really nice to look at, remember your in a service job!
Right as we got the check, is when she asked how our food was, hello, that was a little to late. So we're not going to go back to this location. I would understand if this place was packed, but it was pretty empty.",_sPNv8mKDUlh20Pg8gVvcA,0,0,2,PsbJqkGMnaKuum2UPcFALA

If I was just rating this restaurant on food, I would give them a 5 star, but upon sitting down I noticed that my spoon had dried food on it and the divider between the seat cushions had a load of food debris.

That said, I want to say it didn't have an impact on the food or the service.  Antonio was our server and he was excellent.  We started out with an appetizer of lettuce wraps, these with chicken and quite tasty.  The main course followed soon, my wife ordered a Mushroom Burger, mmmm delicious.  My daughter ordered the 4 Cheese Pasta and she loved it.  And finally I ordered a Macaroni and Cheese Burger, enticed by the idea of macaroni and cheese on a hamburger.  The macaroni was a ball, breaded and deep fried on top of the hamburger which was charbroiled and served with all the extras including fries.  What a surprise, this was a very good combination, especially if you like macaroni and cheese anyway.

The restaurant was very busy but that didn't affect service.  Antonio took great care of us and our drinks never got empty.  The downside here is that they do not have Raspberry Iced Tea, my favorite, but only had regular and a couple of bottled teas.  I settled for regular tea but didn't enjoy it or finish it.

And what would  a trip to the Cheesecake Factory be without some cheesecake?  While mom and I were stuffed from the burgers, our daughter had no trouble ordering a piece of Hershey Bar Cheesecake to go.

Other dishes that I've had recently have been ok -- the  avocado eggrolls were perfectly crispy and not too oily and the chicken samosas were decent. Then, of course there's the cheesecake. It's the main reason why I liked this place growing up. On our last visit we tried the tiramisu cheesecake and the chocolate mouse cheesecake. Neither had the rich, creamy, indulgent taste that I remember. Unfortunately, The Cheesecake Factory just doesn't live up to the expectations I once built up.

I love to start with the ""Avocado Eggrolls"" and if you have never tried them you must! They were priced at $10.50 and can easily be shared.  My favorite thing to order for my meal is the ""Carlton Salad"". It is huge but I manage to polish off every last bite because the awesome flavor keeps my fork going back for more.

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney"" - Drake

My roomie likes two things: Drake and Cheesecake Factory. And she had gotten a particular Drake song in her head and asked if I could take her to Cheesecake Factort. It was her birthday after all. 

This Cheesecake Factory is located in the Boca Park shopping center in Summerlin. Not hard to find as it is probably one of their anchor stores for that shopping center.

Maybe it's the location [you are in Summerlin afterall] but this location seems more elegant and dressed up than your average Cheesecake Factory. Parking can be a hassle but there are valets outside.

Anyways, on to why this is a 4 star rating.

My girlfriend and I took my roommate to dinner for her birthday yesterday. As soon as we entered the girlie and I took a seat while my roomie gave the group's name to the hostess. We had sat down and were called almost immediately! Talk about service. 

Our server was a very nice woman named Cathy B. who was very attentive. I'm HUGE on customer service and recognize it whenever I see stellar service. She was a sweet, kept our drinks filled, took our plates away as soon as we were done eating and we were even able to get her and the rests of the servers to come over and sing 'happy birthday' to the B-day girl. 

The total experience was excellent and left an impression on me. And that's a big plus because I'm generally not a fan of chain restaurants like C.F. or Olive Garden.

Now on to the food.

For an appetizer I had an order of buffalo chicken wings. They were yummy and had the right amount of zing to them. The best thing I had that night!

For dinner I ordered the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger. It was cooked to order and even had pork belly in it. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Pretty average. And the only reason I can't give my visit a perfect rating. 

I did have a bite of the Oreo Dream Extreme Cheesecake and it was good. I don't have much in terms of a sweet tooth so I can't say that the cheesecake wow'ed me but it did was plated very beautifully. Nice job on the presentation.",Eyard5dGOqZVVSCAtH7iOg,0,1,4,s-zbnUpmuBMUDZB43G9QSw

Because Cheesecake Factory boasts an expansive menu, even for the kiddos, I guess I wouldn't mind holding our spot in line for our large party. A promised 45-minute wait, although expected at peak dining hours on a Saturday night, was cut down to about 25 minutes: an unexpected, but welcome, plus! The host stand seemed filled with unnerving hostesses as well as the hustle and bustle of seating all the walk-up guests. They probably needed a break and a reminder that every new customer deserves a positive experience. 

Upon seating, I was immediately greeted my by waitress. Her smile appeared genuine and her customer service rhetoric was unwavering excellent. I was impressed. A secondary server/busser provided bread and waters for all the guests without question. It was fantastic. Our waitress was very accommodating, making suggestions, attentively listening to our requests/restrictions, and tending to the needs of the young children at the table. Upon everyone's food delivery, a manager approached my table to discuss the reason as to why my salmon salad wasn't delivered yet. He stated a vague, yet wordsmithed response in which he basically stalled for an additional 7 minutes. The ""fish just wasn't right"" probably meant that it wasn't cooked yet, it fell on the floor, they forgot, or any combination of two. A specific, yet honest answer would have been more appreciated. Isn't honesty the best policy?

Although the selected dishes varied, I will comment on what I tasted during my experience. My salmon salad for $17.95 was delicious. An herb-crusted salmon topped field greens, cut tomatoes, endive, and asparagus paired nicely with my glass of iced green tea (suggest simple syrup from the bar to accompany the drink). The salmon looked at least 8oz and did not overpower the dish. I recommend the ranch in lieu of the vinaigrette. The children's pepperoni pizza can be a little spicy for children, so be wary of your picky eaters. The tostada salad is a mouth-watering heaping mound of greens atop chicken and a tostada. The lettuce wasn't dried/spun prior to plating and, therefore, left an unnecessary pool of water on the plate and tostada (which transformed into a soft taco shell). The meatloaf is average: nothing special and nothing exciting. Save yourself and select an alternative dish. For dessert, the limoncello cream torte was to die for. Layers of vanilla cake christened with lemon marscopone allows for a sweet dish worthy in lieu of any dessert wine. 

As we received the check, our desserts were double charged, a strike two for our experience. With the tardiness in food delivery, accuracy of order, and initial experience, I rate it 3/3.5 stars.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,2,1,3,5vhtssYL8KM6Yu0tURCG-A

See my posted photo of receipt from my last visit to Cheesecake Factory, Boca Park location.

Though it's only a suggested gratuity, they Deceitfully suggest you tip on the taxed amount.

Almost every other restaurants I visit only suggest tip on actual food & beverages as it's supposed to be.

I usually tip 22 - 25% of amount & sometimes glance at these numbers to help determine my tipping amount.

I noticed this before but now have to speak out because of continued use of this misleading practice.

Firstly, make sure to look at your silverware before using it because on multiple occasions there was large chucks of food on them.

Waited 40 mintues in the parking lot just to come in and find a line at the register where I waited another 30 minutes because they lost the order of the people in front of me and instead of having a manager deal with it while helping the other 10+ people in line they just made everyone wait.  When it was finally my turn I notice the order they originally brought out for the lady in front of me that had been sitting on the counter for 30+ minutes was mine.  My food was ice cold when I got home and when I called to complain the manager told me I could drive back and they would have another order ready in 30 minutes.

4014520,2008-06-26,2,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"The first time I went here was when I was a freshman back at UNLV in '96.  I went to the one in Caesar's Palace.  Wow, was I amazed, probably because coming from Maui we didn't have too many places like this.  It was busy, bustling with lots of people, and lots of good food and drink.  It was one of the better dining experiences I remember.

This review comes from the Cheesecake Factory in Boca Park.  I took my gf's daughter there for her 6th birthday (a very important time for a little one).  It was just her and me.  This was her first time here (that she can remember) and she was just as awestruck as I was when I first saw the place.  The decor can be considered a mix of new and old, big, tall front doors, the ambience with lots of mood lighting and tall ceilings.  It almost seems like you're stepping into a 5 star restaurant.  That is until, you see dad in his khaki shorts and mom with her summer sandals.  Which is nice, because it makes the place seem less pompous and more friendly.

I really like the food here.  I love the big portions and the mix of American, Italian, and Asian food they serve.  After seating us, we received our complimentary bread basket which I usually look forward to.  They give the usual 2 types of bread, a crusty french bread, and a wonderful wheat pumpernickel type bread.  It's really good but only when it's hot and fresh, so make sure if your server gives you a cold basket you request a new fresh one.

I don't usually have any appetizers here because I like to save room for the large entree (which I never finish) and possibly some cheesecake (well...duh, it's Cheesecake Factory), but I have heard folks say that their Thai Lettuce Wraps are definitely worth trying.  Their Factory Nachos with chicken is a pretty big platter as well and is great for sharing.

I for some reason always order the same thing when I go to a place I like.  This time was no different.  I got my fav, the DOUBLE B.B.Q. BACON CHEESEBURGER.  I LOVE this thing.  It's a double-decker Angus burger with a BBQ-ranch sauce, cheddar cheese, bacon, crispy fried onions, lettuce and tomato.  You also get a side on fries.  This bad boy well over a  pound once you put it together.  I can never get the thing in my mouth so I gotta eat it in layers.  I always end up eating only half, and take the other half home for a nice midnight snack.  This burger is SOOOO good, you gotta try it.

The little one got FETTUCINI WITH CHICKEN AND SUN-DRIED TOMATOES.  Smart kid, this dish cost me around $16  (almost TWICE the price of my burger)...and here I thought she wanted to order off the kids menu.  Quick note **this place has NO kids menu** so if you bring them in they order off the big people menu too.  I thought she wanted chicken fingers...she was like, ""No, I want white sauce"".  Lucky birthday girl...white sauce it is!  The fettuccini comes in a nice size bowl, and was flavored excellently.  It has this garlic cream-parmesan sauce that was very creamy and rich and complimented the grilled chicken well.  It also has sun-dried tomatoes on it, which I like, but the little one thought they were gross so I had to put them on the side.  For a kid that weighs only 45 pounds, she nearly killed that pasta.  She ate a good 3/4 of it by herself.  You can tell she liked it because she had a ring of white cream sauce around her lips.  So funny!

You can't go to the Cheesecake Factory and NOT try their cheesecake!  That's like going to gym and not working out (although I may have done that once..or twice).  They have like over 50 cheesecakes you can choose from, and they range from about $6 -$8 a slice.  A bit pricey, but worth it for some stellar cheesecake.  You're not supposed to have more than one slice at a time anyway.  We didn't get any cheesecake this trip (the little one said 'Eww' to cheesecake and settled on her complimentary birthday sundae), which makes my first sentence in this paragraph a little contradictory.  Oh well.  But I can tell you my favorites are Tres Leches cheesecake (so dreamy), and the Oreo cheesecake (full of Oreo chunks).  Great for an end to your dining.  You can also request to take a slice of cheesecake to go and your server will pack it up for you in a nice little cheesecake container to take with you.  

All in all it was a nice time.  The little one enjoyed her pasta, her pint-sized birthday sundae, and the Happy Birthday singing from some of the servers.  I always enjoy going here, great food and great service.

SO GO.  HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT, GET SOME WINE, AND END WITH SOME CHEESECAKE.  ENJOY!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,4,gpTHGLkUkm-FYeBxVvBgOw

We were at this restaurant on 11-23-2015 at about 5:30pm. 
We had decent service with one issue that was poorly addressed by our server. My little one ordered grilled chicken from the kids menu . It came with grilled chicken mashed potatoes and steamed carrots.  I reached over to try one of his carrots and it tasted funny to me. I thought it was my imagination but I noticed he left them all on his plate at the end of our meal. He said they  were not good. 
I reached over and tasted one again and indeed they were rancid. I smelled the pile on his plate and yes they were rancid indeed. 
I am not one to complain about things and my main concern was that the restaurant would serve them to other patrons. My wife let the waitress know in a non defensive manner about the carrots and she rudely  offered to replace them with another vegetable but we were not asking for carrot replacement, we were all done with our meals. 
She was very nonchalant about issue and mumbled she would take them to the chef????? Then came back and dropped off our bill and never apologized or let her superiors know or chef or whoever she reports to. Never said a word and that was it. Picked up credit card and dropped it off hastily after she charged it. 
We noticed they outline tip suggestion, our bill was 92 dollars and suggested tip was 16 dollars. My wife and I decided to leave without tipping. We have never in 15 years being married not left a tip. I worked for auto customer service for a long time and I appreciate tips and good service. 
The decent thing to do would be to apologize and say that she has let the chef or her manager know and kindly apologized and removed charge. 
The non tipping was far more than 6.50, kids meal price, the restaurant would have been out of.

I expect more from the Cheesecake Factory, especially for the price.  This use to be one of my fave places to eat but no more.  It was 10 minutes before we got water, another 10 before our order for apps was taken.  We ordered the crispy taquitos to start with.  Tasty but the guacamole was so skimpy-not enough for 2 people to have a decent dab.  The hubby ordered the Ribbed Eye (at CF? Really???). It was overcooked but service was so spotty that night that we were afraid to send it back.  it came with fries...The fries are different and not for the better.  I ordered the stuffed chicken tortilla.  It was still as good as I remembered.  CF still has the best Ranch dressing.  We ordered cheesecake to go.  My husband got the Coconut cream which he said was ""fine"".  I tried the Pineapple upside down cake.  It was just okay but that isn't a quality issue-just a matter of taste.

Like most of the chains restaurants, it is easy to see that they have skimped here & there to make their profit.  I would rather they be honest-either keep the quality with smaller proportions or charge more.   Can't give them an A-ok because for the price it was a huge disappointment and it seems the last few times we have gone, our experience gets just a little bit worse...",tAcY4S3vIuNlAoRlCcz5VA,2,1,2,foV5gPmopMGHcbzwZvJX9w

Main reason for us coming here...I was hungry and wanted something that I was low on calories, higher on protein, and close to where we were currently at.  Plus, the food at Cheesecake Factory is as consistent as it gets. Yes, I said lower on calories and The Cheesecake Factory has a special menu for this.  Drumroll...their SkinnyLicious menu. In the last 4 months, I've been to a Cheesecake Factory about 5 times.  Every single time, my meal of choice comes from their healthier options.  This menu has a range from chicken breast, steak, tacos, some fish, and turkey.  Of course, there's a bunch of salad options, but I don't do salads. I tried their White Chicken Chili with Brown Rice.  I was surprised that my meal was less than 500 calories.  It was damn good.  It's basically a lighter chili sauce, some brown rice mixed in, and a whole lot of chicken breast pieces.  Loved it!

As for the service, it didn't start off too well.  It was a Friday night and we got seated right away.  But it took forever for our server to come and take our order. I had to give the eye to one of the employees walking by just to get service.  Within 5 minutes, service is what we got.  By the way, service was great from then on. 

Overall, I'm still giving Cheesecake Factory 4 stars because of their SkinnyLicious Menu and familiar dishes. 

PS:  Hard to say no to the bread basket.  Their brown bread is phenomenal.

Not sure if it was the time of day that I went, but the place was totally crowded and there were people standing from the check-in spot all the way out the front door. I wasn't going to stay, but the lady at check-in told me for a party of two, it would be about 10 minutes. 

After standing and waiting for 25 minutes, we were finally seated. The table that we were seated at, wasn't completely cleaned yet. Please don't seat me if the table isn't ready! Once seated, our waitress took our drink order, which we only asked for ice water. That took 10 minutes to get to us. After about another 10 minutes she took our food order. Normally at Cheesecake Factory, they bring you bread and butter right away, she didn't bring ours until our food was almost brought out. I would've understood if she was actually busy, but we saw her just standing around multiple times.

Our food came out after about 25 minutes, which was delicious as always. It was nice a warm and tasted fresh. Our waitress didn't come around again until we asked for a to-go box and our check. Not sure if she had a long day or was just having a bad one, but she wasn't friendly at all. 

Pros:
1. Nicely located in a shopping area.
2. Food was delicious!

1. Unfriendly staff 
2. Crowded

Always a good call if your unsure of what your looking for. Cheesecake Factory is one of those places that has one of those huge menus where if you can't find something to eat, clearly your not hungry or having some of interstellar hunger breakdown.

Having been to cheesecake in a few locations around the states this Factory has all the bells and whistles you come to expect from any other franchise.

Ordering the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp and the Chopped salad for our main we dived straight into the massive portion of food. Make sure to always come hungry. They have a small kids menu as well as high chairs for the kiddos!! 

Since the Mains are pretty big my suggestion is try to order the small dishes if your looking for the amazing cheesecake! My favorite cheese cake is the Carrot Cheese cake. Some of the chocolate cheesecake can be pretty amazing as well. Also if your not a Heavy cream person let them know as they like to stack a massive cream side to your cake. 

As for service, expect a line if your coming at peak times, usually 7 days of the week this Cheesecake Factory is busy so don't be surprised when you might have to wait a while.

This is a great restaurant chain.  This location is huge with seating both inside and out.  They have the usual 30 page menu, so you will definitely find at least 1 thing, if not 10 that you want to try for lunch/dinner.  

The food tastes great as well.  My favorites are all appetizers.  I usually get 2 apps and enjoy a small feast.  My absolute favorites are the Tex Mex Eggrolls, Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes, and the Buffalo Wontons.   All are winners and I recommend these to everyone who loves yumminess on a plate.

If you are in need of more food than some appetizers, you are in luck! They have everything from tasty pizzas, yummy sandwiches, and delicious entrees that could feed a small village.  If you can name it, Cheesecake Factory probably has it on their menu.

The desserts are fantastic here too!  I mean cheesecake is in the name of the place, so you know the cheesecake will be great!  The also have other desserts like cake and pie, but I have never tried them because I always go for cheesecake! DUH!  My favorite choices are the Chocolate Tuxedo, Dulce de Leche, and Key Lime cheesecake.  The Pumpkin cheesecake is fabulous, but you can only get that one in the fall.

The service is usually great and you can usually be sat pretty quickly, due to the massive amount of tables available.  It is a very consistent restaurant.

3 stars for the service and 3 stars for the food on a Friday lunch with no lunch rush. The service seemed to die down once we ordered our food and we had to wait a good 15 minutes after we finished eating to find the server to get us a box. (Maybe there was a lunch rush and I was not aware of it.) For an appetizer we ordered the Crispy Cheese Sticks. It was crispy on the outside and cheesy on the inside. This is definitely worth trying and getting for next time. I generally like the Cheesecake Factory and since I'm boring and set in my ways, I normally order the Bistro Shrimp Pasta or the Miso Salmon. I decided on the Miso Salmon, because they did not offer a lunch portion of the Bistro Shrimp. The salmon looked a lil overcooked with its blackened edges and as I took a bite, it was a lil dry. The flavor was not what I remembered, but maybe it's because I normally get it with the mashed potatoes instead of the white rice. Anyhow, I was disappointed with my lunch. My sister ordered the kids cheese pizza. It was probably about a 10incher and very cheesy. She said it was good, but had a funny taste. I think overall, I was disappointed with the quality of the entrees but maybe they just had an off day.

However, the last time we went to dinner we had a really disappointing experience. We brought her family that were in town from Germany so that they could finally experience this Cheesecake Factory place we tell them about somewhat frequently.

To start, our waiter was the definition of a tool. I hate to be mean, but his name might as well have been Tony tough nuts. He tried to be nice, but the vibe from him just was not good. What's worse is he forgot drinks for 15 minutes at a time, and would remember when I asked about them. He took FOREVER to take our initial order, despite me asking and him walking past quite a few times. Just in general, bad vibe.

Then comes the food. Service is forgivable when the food is amazing. This time, it was not. We decided to get the Guacamole since we recently had some at El Dorado and we were craving some again. They brought it to the table, and we quickly realized that it was HUGE chunks of Avocado, and not ripe avocado at that. It was hard and stringy. So I asked the waiter to send it back since, ya know, we couldn't even dip chips in it because it was like half an avocado at a time.

He brings it back, and says...yeah just so you know that's how we do the guacamole now, so if you want it more mashed up you have to specify. REALLY?! It's a DIP, not pieces of apple you're eating. The thing is, with this guy, he could have been making it up since he was that type of person. he also tried to blame the bar on the drinks, then clearly went and put it in the computer since he forgot (we could see the bar and the computer right next to us).

Anyway, my four cheese pasta came out luke warm and cold on the outsides, but by this point I said screw it, I ate some of it and too the rest home to heat up the next day.

I really loved the ambience of this place, exterior and interior. We came on a Monday night and were seated right away although there were larger parties ahead of us. I got the spicy cashew chicken and my bf got the carne asada steak medallions. Both were very good, especially the first bite of my spicy cashew chicken. It had strong flavorings but wasn't as spicy as the name. My server knew so he brought out chili peppers for me, which kinda helped! It was good but got kind of salty after a while so I decided to take it home for lunch the next day. We also wanted dessert and since the place is called Cheesecake Factory we opted for a slice of regular cheesecake. It was pretty sweet but eating it with the whipped cream given definitely complemented the taste!

The Cheesecake Factory on the westside has a reputation for a 50-50 split between enjoying the meal or feeling sick. During our last visit, sick meant food poisoning.

After eating the lightest meal at this location -- fish and chips -- the next week resulted in one of the worst bouts of food poisoning ever. I should have known. The fish tasted frozen and as if it had been left under the heat lamp too long. It should have went back, but after a long road trip, no on had the energy to wait around. 

Afterward, the incident was reported. The company claimed to do an investigation, said they could find no evidence that could trace the sickness back to the restaurant, and promptly sent the absolute last thing anyone in my family wanted to see -- a gift certificate to go back. No thank you, ever.

It was senile dementia that brought us to the Cheesecake Factory.  Let me explain: Friends were visiting from CA, and after we sat around drinking wine and munching on cheese and crackers, we turned to the serious problem of where to go for dinner.  The couple has been to Vegas often, but mostly in the SW valley, where their son lives.  Herb came up with the brilliant suggestion to go to Mixx, and I readily agreed, thinking it would be something different for them.

We were presented with menus and water, and as I was explaining the bowl concept to them, I suddenly had a Duh! moment, and realized that the very next night we were going to meet a group of neighbors for Happy Hour in this very restaurant.  We had already decided that at HH we'd order two Fresh Market big bowls instead of the HH apps, so that we could take home leftovers, my favorite meal.  But we didn't remember any of that when we set out for Mixx.  We certainly weren't going to do that two nights in a row.  So, completely chagrined, we told the waitress we'd see her tomorrow night.  Cheesecake Factory, being right next door, was the obvious substitute, since we didn't want to start thinking all over again.

All four of us ordered from the Skinnylicious menu, probably in atonement for the excesses of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's.  Our friend had the Flatbread with Pear and Blue Cheese, and loved it.  His wife had the Lettuce Wraps, picking the Asian ""tacos.""  The dish looked beautiful, and she enjoyed it.

My husband ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich, which came on a bun with a bowl of salad, and he liked his, too.

And then there was me, deciding on the skinny version of the Turkey Burger. Wanting a change from buns, I chose the wheat baguette. And ranch on the side for my salad.  As soon as my fork touched the burger, it fell apart, but it tasted okay.  But that wheat baguette was no wheat baguette.  It was more like pumpernickel, and it was SWEET!  So were the caramelized onions - adding sugar is a sloppy shortcut for the slow cooking that renders them naturally sweet.  My salad didn't come with the ranch dressing I asked for.  Instead, it had the house dressing already on it.  Lots of it.  When the waiter brought a new salad and the ranch, that dressing turned out to be strangely sweet, too.  Sweet ranch??? Yuk, and yuk also for the salad, which was a sizable portion, but completely different from the one my husband got.  Not my kind of mix.

Service was impersonally okay, but just average.  Three of us four liked what we ordered.  I'm the outlier, but I'm the one writing the review, so I get to give it three stars.  And I'm being generous.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,4,3,yM1L7jSEp9wWPsHBEqNEsg

I could give 5 stars for the drink called the Georgia peach alone. It tastes like a drink from Carnival cruise ships called kiss on the lips. I have spent like 10 years trying to replicate it and can't. Now, I have somewhere to get it. It is $11 which is steep for a frozen drink, but oh my wow!!  The bread they serve is amazing. The sourdough is perfect. My husband had steak, I had the crusted chicken Romano, and my son had a quesadilla. Everything was great!  Now for the cheesecake....holy mother of choices. How do you decide on just one?!  My son (who is 6) always has Linda's fudge cake. It takes him 3 days to eat it because the slice is about as big as him. My hubby got the red velvet and that will be my choice next time because it was soooo good. I had the white chocolate macadamia nut and it wasn't bad. It's the only complaint if you can even call it that, but my piece of cheesecake was really small. The slices are always huge and mine was half the normal size.

I handed our waiter, David N., the letter which still had the gift card attached to it (you guys sent us a $45 gift card to give you another try). In the letter it states that the manager would like to know we are there and they could make sure our experience was a better one and would like to meet us. This did not happen, the waiter stood there and read the letter so I don't know if it was waiter who did not inform management or they just didn't want to come out, but we were never approached by any manager.
  We ordered the eggroll sampler and it was just put in front of us with no explanation of the sauces (never have we ordered any of the eggrolls).

Now, of course this isn't the biggest deal so we just let it go.

She received her dinner and there was no creama, just chipIotle sauce, a very minimal amount of grilled onions (a taco had ONE small strip) ZERO avocado (as it states on the menu its served with it)  and somehow there was a pickled cabbage?? (it's not stated thats on the tacos on the menu) We asked the server if they could remake it and at this point we are getting very frustrated with the service and food. I had to ask for my coke and her water to be refilled MANY times despite the waiter always walking around. I was genuinely flabbergasted I had to ask for refills with how much he was walking by.
 So, by now, after already a long wait to receive our food to begin with (the restaurant was not busy by any means from what we could tell) we had to wait another 15 minutes for her food to be remade, so my boyfriend and I stopped eating out of courtesy.  45 mins after we ordered our food, we FINALLY got to eat together and of course my boyfriends and I's dinner was cold. My friend STILL then had a problem with her order (the tortillas were not cooked) but by then we were so hungry we didnt say anything.
 Now, here comes the time to pay. After the waiter took the $45 gift card off the total, the remaining balance of the bill was $42 and change. I only had twenties and my friend had her debit card. So, we told the waiter for $20.00 on the card and I put down two twenty dollar bills. David, our waiter, brought back the receipts with no change! Never EVER had I had a waiter just assume the remaining change was theirs and pocket my cash. He never asked if we needed change to verify it was his, he just took it! I asked for it back and he mumbled an apology about be busy or whatnot (which none of us believed, he was making excuses all night and the place WASN'T busy). 
For this trying to be a make-up from last time for the burnt food and bad food, you guys SERIOUSLY missed again. I don't know if it's this location or whatever but we are very unsatisfied with the service and food and that the manager wasn't around to make sure our dining experience was better than the last. I really enjoyed you guys, but at this rate my friend says she NEVER wants to come back and I don't blame her!!!",8Fr2Jx2vTTo7e0mUb02g0A,1,0,2,_ObganuR1PbnHf1JMRm2Rg

4655257,2014-12-16,5,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"The Cheesecake Factory is much more than cheesecake. The Cheesecake Factory is a chain restaurant that specializes in burgers, sandwiches, pasta, and pizza. 

  Yesterday after hanging out in Sabalatte in the Boca Park Fashion Village, my brother and I were up for dinner. We decided on The Cheesecake Factory. The menu offers a diverse selection of food at competitive prices inside an upscale dining room. We couldn't go wrong with the Cheesecake Factory. 

  Although I have only been to this location once before way back in February of 2005 when I picked up my new Saturn Ion (sure was a long time ago), and celebrated with a delicious pasta dinner, I am no stranger to the Cheesecake Factory. I have been to the Caesar's Palace location quite a few times. 

  When my brother and I stepped inside the dimly lit and elegant restaurant, it was understandably busy. The friendly hostess took our name and kindly let us know that there would be a five minute wait. The Cheesecake Factory has yet to implement the text messaging system that some restaurants have incorporated. The wait was less than five minutes. 

  Tina was our waitress. She was friendly, never rushed us, and constantly checked up on us. I am giving a shout out for Tina on account of the fact that my brother left his sunglasses at the table. As we approached the Valley parking area (on the way to the upper deck), Tina comes running after us with his sunglasses. With that said, the service here rounded up Cheesecake Factory to four stars. 

  The food is also delicious. Everytime that I have dined in a Cheesecake Factory, the large portions had filled me up leaving me with no room for cheesecake. In my opinion, Cheesecake Factory is a restaurant for either dinner or coffee and dessert. We just had coffee at Sabalatte, so tonight I ordered their chicken parmesan sandwich which included fries and a Coke. The chicken parmesan sandwich is unique. I don't know of many restaurants that make it. Plus, it is delicious. Between the time of ordering and Tina delivering the sandwich, she delivered the customary dinner rolls. In past visits to the Caesar's Palace Cheesecake Factory, the pasta sauce was included.  Here, there is a separate bowl of the sauce where you pour it on to your liking. I enjoyed every bite of the chicken parmesan sandwich. It is something that I do not enjoy very often. I also enjoyed the small bowl of French fries that accompanied the sandwich. And the Coke did not have a hint of flatness. It was just as sparkling as Tina's attitude. 

  Cheesecake Factory was $20 well spent. The dining area is not Tiffany elegance but an elegance similar to dining in a Caesar's Palace, Venetian Hotel, or upscale resort Cafe. It is a dining environment that isolates the outside world and is simply relaxing. The food was delicious and filling. Service was outstanding. I could see another well spent $20 at Cheesecake Factory in the future. Or $30 if I am hungry and want to reward myself with their signature cheesecake and coffee.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,13,9,4,azRoYgHaiNivSUKZrLBqYg
4681272,2018-02-26,0,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"This particular Cheesecake Factory Restaurant, the one in Boca Park is not up to par with the other ones here in Las Vegas.  It is hit and miss every time you eat here. Some times its delicious, beautifully prepared and other times they sort of just throw food in a dish and put it in front of you.  Missing ingredients is usually a game you play trying to find what the menu says the entr√©e is supposed to have and where is it? Missing as usual, then when you bring it to the waitress or waiter's attention you get ""that look"" and they will be right back with the ingredient that is missing.  Also I wonder why every time we eat there, I have to send something back because it doesn't taste the same as the time before when I ordered the same thing.  I have noticed though, when Jason the Oriental Manager is on duty the food usually comes out wrong, he doesn't oversee the food prep nor does he come to the table when there is a problem as most managers do to find out what is wrong.  It's like he's invisible when there is a problem.   Bad indigestion, a staff that really couldn't care less about how long you are waiting for your meal, and if you send it back you will be waiting a very long time for the replacement to come to the table is what you get here.  Management or should I say one manager in particular the Oriental Manager really isn't concerned with having happy customers.  I don't go for the cheese cake which I'm sure is delicious, I go for the entrees which could use improvement in so many ways.  For the price of the entrees they should come out right the first time and look beautiful and taste perfect which they don't.

I figured I'd try them again after the fiasco at the Green Valley one, where I felt bias from our server, which was evident from the poor service and lack of water refills and bread, compared to the tables surrounding us. A bit of a slap on the face to see them patronizing the ladies sitting next to you with the attentive service. Kind of overt if you ask me. Normally my dad tips really well too but he had it with this kind of service. I tip 15-20% but he tips 30-40%, sometimes 100%. So back to this location. I ordered spaghetti.

Sorry, nothing exciting here. Just had a craving for plain old spaghetti and giant meatballs. Which is what I got, fat meatballs and spaghetti that was cooked right. The sauce is salty enough and you get a heaping plate of noodles that can feed two. And the server treated us like everyone else, as in didn't tell us that they didn't have any rolls and then bring it out to the next table 3 minutes later, or the table across from them a few minutes later. Yeah, we got the point. You won't catch me going to Green Valley Cheesecake Factory again. Generally, I always liked CF, from Caesars to Boca Park to GV, to every other one I tried in LA and Seattle.

Who doesn't love an exaggerated size slice of cheesecake? My girls and I stopped by last night around 10ish. It's was pretty empty. The service was delayed the entire visit. We had to continuously ask to order beverages dessert food and the bill. I get it it's late but they're open until midnight and guest should expect the same level of service until the restaurant closes. 

The food and desert quality did not disappoint. Each dish ordered was exceptional and served promptly! 

A few of the many items ordered were Tuna Tartare (so good omg), dynamite shrimp and various desserts!
 $100 later we are satisfied until next time!",9PODl32fViCXhN4NxBdGPQ,2,0,4,MpDYgMThKEpxk1LnVAYvAA
4943180,2015-04-21,2,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,"Strictly talking food, this Cheesecake Factory gets four stars. On the weekend, parking is hard to find, but it's a pretty awesome location with other new shops and family activities. The experience though, knocked it a star, otherwise it would have been one of my favorite restaurants we checked out this weekend.

I ordered a Flying Gorilla beverage to start and it was pretty much my favorite part of a very, very late lunch. Still, we all were able to order from the lunch menu. I had the Avocado Rolls to start, followed by the Chinese Chicken Salad. Everything tasted great, though I'm not a huge fan of the thin, white crispy noodles. I should have asked for them to go easy on that, because there was literally a mountain of it (hence no photo). 

Appetizers came out fast, but everything else was weird, honestly. My sister ordered a Pi√±a Colada to start and then a Pepperoni Pizza. I don't think she was a huge fan of the drink, but she said the pizza was pretty much what she hoped for. Even at lunch, the portion was rather large. Leftovers, yo! Only problem is she got her food way before our friend and I. She was almost done by the time I got our food.

Our friend ordered Calamari to start, which I would recommend to everyone, because their Calamari is always so good! Lightly fried, crispy bits of octopus makes for a great appetizer and big enough to share! She ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and seemed to enjoy that as well.

So what happened to our bread? You know that thing they usually bring out at the very beginning at every Cheesecake Factory? Apparently they were running behind on a lot of our order, which was surprising for a weekend. Tina our server was as helpful as she could be, despite not being able to get everything out at the same time. The bread didn't even come out until we were ready for the check, so that was kind of annoying. 

I would only recommend they staff the kitchen properly on a Saturday, no exceptions. Other than that, I genuinely had a nice time at Cheesecake Factory and am curious to explore more of Summerlin in the future.",s7DOGaUBVoyVgwdmCQWiVQ,2,2,4,j1DsB45Rz6-jbV4XcfJrIQ

We make it a point to come when it's slow so we can get better seating. Normally we don't say anything and just sit down, but today we just got tired of it.  We finally asked for a booth, and of course they had open booths to sit us in.

My daughter had the kids spaghetti and one meatball. She claims the meatball crust was too hard and the noodles were too thick but the sauce was good and the meatball was flavorful. She also would rather have another meatball and less noodles.
Daddy had the steak Dianne. He ordered it medium well but it came out medium rare but was ok with it because of the quality if the steak. The mashed potatoes was plentiful and really yummy. Some of the mushrooms were burnt but it did not mess up the taste. This dish had less sauce this time than it usually does but all the flavors were still there. 
I had the chicken picatta. The noodles were aldente. The dish was very flavorful but very light on the stomach as well.

Being a waitress on the strip for six years and with the company for 10 I know what guest service is... You, are terrible. First off, coming to the table and not making eye contact with the people you are speaking to is not ok. Second your stance is confrontational, almost like you were looking to brawl. It's aggressive and not very welcoming. I would like to say you were at some point just overwhelmed with your tables but as I continued to watch you, I realized, no you're just a terrible waiter. You didn't care to engage you didn't care to answer questions and you didn't even bring me out spoons for my cheese cake. Seriously, who brings dessert and no spoons? I would like to point out that I wanted another orange juice and my boyfriend another glass of wine but you wouldn't know because you never asked. It's ok Also, I get there are busboys but if they aren't around it means you clear my table, you're not above clearing a table. For the record I cleared most of my dishes onto the dirty table next to me since my table wasn't cleaned once during our meal. I did have to ask twice for the check the second time you pretended like I never asked a first time. You're also human and not above being able to say I forgot let me go get it. But passing blame is easier. What a stressful lunch. Honestly, my cheese cake didn't even taste good after all this. My experience out weighed the potential to have a good lunch.

The menu is huge and this was more than enough of a hearty dish to share. We each had a heap of mash potato, a filet of chicken, roasted carrots and a biscuit each. It was actually pretty good....think of a chicken pot pie, deconstructed with biscuits. 

Really, I just wanted some cheesecake. I don't like any of the rich flavored ones they do as they are way too sweet and dense. I like the mango key lime which the tartness is nice with the creaminess and we also got a raspberry one which was decent, but the mango key lime was still better.

I don't think I could be who I am today if I didn't have my cousins to grow up with.  For my 29th, they took me to Cheesecake Factory at Boca Park.  Also, I was here to celebrate my 30th birthday with my parents, and I hung out with one of my friend's here.  No, I'm not a Cheesecake Factory Lover, for some reason I would end up here from time to time.

You don't need a reservation, however at times you'll find your self waiting if you don't have a reservation.  Most of the time it's on a Friday and Saturday that's it's busy.  But what restaurant isn't busy on those two days?  What I like about this spot is the fact it's a huge facility.  When I entered through the huge double doors that seem to reach the ceiling, I found how clean it was.  There was not a trash on site.  The restaurant was super clean and well kept.  I was very impressed by that.

Upon seating, I notice that servers aren't really great.  They always seem to be in a hurry and don't take the time.  I always felt like I was being hurried.  If I took my time, they take forever to get back to me before I can order.  This always happened here.

Let's start with appetizers.  I liked their Fire Roasted Artichokes.  I thought that was a good choice.  It took a long time to get through it but you don't feel so full after eating it.  Their Fried Calamari was just mediocre.  It had too much flour on it and it wasn't as plumpy or juicy as Philippino's make it.  My dad makes them better.  Another you can't go wrong with is the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip.  It's a good starter and isn't too salty.  As for the negatives, don't order their Lettuce Wraps.  It's just not good enough, even to compare to P.F. Chang's.   

The only entree I can remember that I liked was the Meat Loaf.  It tasted very good and was very filling.  The serving portions are so great that you can even take it home with you and eat the rest for lunch the next day.  I only go here if I don't feel like thinking about what to eat and where to go.

We were seated fairly quickly despite it being a busy weekend night and having no call-ahead for a table.

They had a fancy interior, the dining room was dimly lit (just like all Cheesecake Factories), and the noise level was a little louder than average (it can get quite noisy). 

As for the food, we started off with the avocado egg rolls. It may sound weird, but they're actually SO GOOD. Who would've ever thought that this unique twist on egg rolls could be so delicious? It's fried in an egg roll wrap stuffed with avocados, sun-dried tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.  A must-try for avocado aficionados (or for those who are tired of the standard guacamole)! The sauce it came with was sweet; it was the perfect pairing with the egg rolls. Let this appetizer satisfy your tastebuds with its Avocado-ey goodness!

My main entree was the Louisiana chicken pasta. It had Parmesan crusted chicken (the breading was crunchy and the chicken was juicy!) over farfalle pasta with a sauce that has a bit of a spicy kick to it. This is seriously some good pasta. If you want something that's super filling, I'd go the pasta route.

Presentation of the food could've been a little bit better, but the food was great nonetheless. 

Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at how good everything was from what I remember. The Cheesecake Factory is probably the best option if you don't want to go anywhere super fancy for dinner.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,9,7,4,nSA4HfH3EXchAZo5qL1Hsg

They literally have everything from Chinese to burgers. I've tried multiple things off their menu and everything has been amazing. The orange chicken is some of the best I've had. Of course the cheesecake is amazing as well. They also have a pretty large selection of cheesecake to choose from. Last time we tried the new Reese's cheesecake and omg it was amazing. We usually get the Adams peanut butter which is very similar but the Reese's was very good. I highly recommend this place especially if you're with a large group because the menu has so many different options it can please everyone. The wait can just get kind of long but it usually goes by pretty fast and it is more on the pricey side (average $40-$50 for two)  but still not a bad price for how good the food is.,5vDnwYNUp4qPjjenvRmYOA,0,0,4,m3rmNs9vD_YUV0WZarlxyw

I have probably tried almost every cheesecake on their menu except the key lime, not a fan! Carrot cake is perfect, not too sweet and just enough flavor and ingredients. The white chocolate rasberry cheesecake is our fave. Oreo like crust and curled white chocolate pieces on the sides with a hint of swirled in rasberry puree. Fried calamari is an appetizer to order. Lightly battered, perfectly seasoned and crisp! It's served with a garlic aioli like sauce and cocktail sauce. 

List of our favorites...
Chicken Bellagio- crispy coated chicken breasts over basil pasta and parmesan cream sauce topped with arugula and prosciutto. 

Steak diane and Shrimp scampi- We enjoy our steak medium well. Very amazing flavor of marinated steak and shrimp. Mash potatoes were creamy and perfectly paired with grilled asparagus. Perfect all the time, won't disappoint!

We then waited another 15 minutes for them to find the order (the order taker put it under Taylor even though I spelled my name out to her over the phone, she obviously wasn't listening). Another 15 minutes passed and we finally received the food. If you are counting that's 45 minutes waiting for a pick up order. 
We got home and ate the food.... The fries were soggy, the sandwiches were luke warm, and the marshmallow on top of our lemon cheesecake was melted and unrecognizable (but still tasty).
Fast forward 2 hours and we were both sick. I took pepto and thankfully was fine but my boyfriend was not so lucky. He has full on food poisoning!!!!

My boyfriend surprised me, taking me here, but because he dislikes coconut and I swore that the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake would change his mind, he was willing to taste it. 4 stars because seriously TAKE RESERVATIONS. AT LEAST DO A RESERVE WAIT LIST for people who are courteous enough to call ahead. On a Friday night at peak hours, our 2 top took 15 minutes to seat outside but the front was sooo crowded, 4-5 sets w kids in tow. The weather was beautiful and all the food wonderful as usual. I had a Greek salad that was good but would have been better without the wilted greens and the Pear & Bleu Cheese flatbread we shared. So yummy, that flatbread could be an appetizer at every meal. Dinner was Parmesan Crusted Chicken (may not be listed exactly like that, sorry) for me and he got the Stuffed Cheddar Burger(again may not be actual name). Also per usual for my pics, we've taken bites already! He also asked them to do a lil Happy Birthday thing, which yes super sweet but I don't like that attention. He really liked the cheesecake btw.

Got our drinks and then let us decide. 
We ordered the artichoke crab dip (came out hot) but it wAs a tad too fishy. 

I definitely think the wine prices are WAY too high for the name brand they are selling. We spent $50 in drinks and only had two a piece.

We both ordered the ribeye and was cooked perfect!! I always get their grilled asparagus (fantastic) instead of green beans.  UP charge btw

The bread basket they give u is also fresh and warm.

Let's start with my little brother's girlfriends graduation dinner from UNLV. A party of 8, service was good, the server was attentive and had everything going for her when it came to her tables. 
The food, well, how can you mess up a burger medium? It can be done, and I was done this night.  As they were swamped, I knew better than to ask for a remake, it would have taken them one hour for a burger.  No worries the dessert made up for the crappy food. 

Now today, 6/18, as it was not my choice to go, I went back because my brother's girlfriend loves it there. Issac was our server, really good server, but the length of time to get two basic meals was not good. I did not order as I got there late, and my brother was waiting 1 hour for tacos and some other quick making food. 
The patrons to the side of us, who came in after him and right before I,  received their food beforehand. As both my brother and I come from a hospitality owned establishment, this is not what we excepted. 
This is not the normal Cheesecake Factory expectations, at least from the east coast. I know I will not be returning to this one ever again. Furthermore, I will make sure no one visits this one when they come to visit.",FN7ZYDpdCxwliulmxTlHyA,0,0,1,k6T68PWadksUqlRhZdqqYQ

Um, ok. Anyways, another 15 minutes after that (40 minutes in total) we get seated. 

The waitress was nice and processed our orders quickly and efficiently. HOWEVER! The food was meh, to say the least. The bread was good as usual, but everything else was bland. I got the Renee's Special, which is a soup/sandwich/salad combo. I try to eat relatively healthy (lots of protein, no additives) so restaurant food is usually a flavor overload. Nope! The tortilla soup tasted like lukewarm salty water. My sandwich was OK tasting but the bread was so hard I had to break away the top layer to even bite through it!

The service is always awesome when we go to any of these establishments.  

Today we met some friends for lunch. When we arrived and walked in I let them know we had a party of six and I asked the girl If there was a wait and she said ""no there isn't a wait"" I said great. She takes my name and says it will be about five minutes. I was like what, you just said there wasn't a wait?????? I wasn't upset that there was gonna be a wait but for the fact she said there wasn't going to be one was kind of annoying.  I thought okay maybe they have to get a table to fit us. That wasn't the issue because after waiting about ten minutes they walked us over to a booth which was sitting next to a handful of other empty booths.  Again I wasn't mad about waiting but just annoying that she lied, bizarre right??

Anyway, the host gives us our menus and about five minutes goes by before our super,  sweet and nice waitress arrives to get our drink orders. She goes to retrieve our drinks, drops them off and I realize we don't have straws for our drinks; only a straw for my sons (which they put in). I actually prefer to do this ourselves. Again just annoying.  We wait for about five minutes before anyone walks by before we scored straws.  

Next, we finally get our food orders in and our meals finally arrived about 25 minutes; after giving our orders.  

The food was good and I do like that they have added the calories of their meals to menus,  as well as new items. 

When it was time to pay getting our bill took forever; once she dropped the bills off it took another ten minutes before she came back to retrieve them. It was annoying again.  

My last complaint was that the booth was filthy. There was dust on one of the napkins, corn dog sticks between the wall and seat as well as on the on the floor. There were crumbs all over the seats and the floors were dirty. The place really needs a deep clean. If the dining area is filthy that makes me assume that the kitchen must be pretty dirty.

She told me I Must of got the last slice the other 25 times I've bought the same cake. 
She had terrible customer service. I waited for a few minutes then asked for a manager. When I told the manager it was smaller she said it did look smaller and she would get another slice.

Went with a group of 10 and the wait on a Friday was approx. 45 minutes. Once seated and drinks orders were taken I was quickly informed that the only beer I wanted on Tap was not working, go figure, so I didn't order any other type simply because I wanted that particular beer. 
Cheesecake Factory always seems to be overwhelming to me in the menu and there is so many options and looking at the menu I soon realize I have not idea what I want. Since I have been to this restaurant before Yelping, I have tried a few items but overall never been extremely satisfied with the quality of the meals. 
With that being said, this day I easily ordered The Club Sandwich, in hopes that it would be better than just standard for a sandwich, but again, its just a sandwich. 
The Service was somewhat slow but nothing out the ordinary since it was Friday night and we were a big group, however, the Manager did stop by the table and apologized for the extended wait on the appetizers and said she would take care of the cost on those since they were not out after 30 minutes, Thanks Manager. 
Right after apps came out the main entries showed up and while I wasn't overly excited about my Club I was impressed with the appearance of the plate. 
Of course Club sandwiches are stacked so unhinging my jaw to take a bit is always fun and this Club certainly proved to be about standard in taste and appearance. I was finally happy with something I had ordered although I only ate half the Club (gotta save room for Desert) 

Desert was Adams Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple Cheesecake and certainly without a doubt worth every penny! 

Hats of to the waitress for giving me updates on the beer tap, however, they never got it working so went beerless but I do appreciate the attempt. 

Overall, this experience was good and my food was improved from the other times (pre-yelping) but I did only order a Club Sandwich.

Anyways I'll be back hopefully when it's not too busy,KJ0a-KChFN-SRZSJqZ04Wg,1,0,4,RmeLJA7BX6Tlr869Aes5LQ

The food tasted great, I'm sure we'll do this again.",RfKH2hVBSoaovmW9WwDn2Q,1,0,4,xytvkAkHKKkdzkpYe3lz_A

It comes with French fries and onion rings but I skipped on the onion rings per gluten free. But seriously, the steak cooked medium is better than most steaks I've had at $$$$ steakhouses on the strip (and we've been to almost all of them). So that tells you to try it!",-kRQLEDxrEBVNXImyAt_ug,0,0,3,EySzHKZ9vyjt0LOcGgdpUg
5922923,2014-07-18,3,eZcCFV-8X91ZSnmB9807bw,The cheesecake factory use to be the place to go... not anymore the food portions have been reduced in size dramatically as well as the size of the cheesecakes. The quality is nothing what it once was. Yet the prices have only gone up.   Cheesecake factory is now nothing more than a chain restaurant and it shows.  It's now nothing more than a fancy Marie Callender's.. no thanks for me anymore.,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,4,3,2,hm2vJ-wMq2wHj6Wkju8hHA

From the overwhelming selection of food on the menu (seriously, pick a damn food theme!) to all the crazy ads in the menu, it always takes me years to get through the menu. And even though I've been to Cheesecake Factory 324890789459843 times, I never eat the cheesecake there. Well, I can't say never; I did ONCE, got massively sick and haven't touched any cheesecake since. You must be wondering why I still go back to Cheesecake Factory? You know what, I wonder why I go back too.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,3,AAuj9koVkzhlgBgjqi_NZQ

It was a nice night we chose to sit outside on the patio since it doesn't happen much. My big issue is they have a smoking bench right outside the patio (which was less than 10 ft from my table), so while trying to enjoy my dinner I had cigarette smoke blowing right in mine and my toddlers face. It totally ruined my dinner and I left feeling like I needed a breathing treatment.",zRcgTyJBqFNeGYH2TSzSIw,1,0,3,sr93K2v4J4NhMsv2uvxmcw

We were seated and service was friendly and attentive considering how busy the restaurant was. Refills were plentiful and food was ok. I ordered the bang bang chicken and shrimp and although I was a little disappointed with my food choice, everyone else seemed to enjoy their food and portions were more than sufficient. There was so much food, we had plenty of leftovers to take home with us. 

I always remember the limoncello cake from previous visits, so we ordered that to share as well. Not as great as I remembered, but still solid and everyone was happy with the meal. Great service and pretty ok food for a chain restaurant. I'd definitely come back with a gift card or for happy hour in the future.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,5,3,rs7zRupbtMVqiU2MxtzCPQ

The service is okay. Sometimes it's great and other times your server is no where to be found ,but with the high amount of traffic and the numerous times I've been back it's safe to say it's good enough service to keep people coming back. 

I usually get the chicken crusted Romano, but have tried numerous things on their menu from the miso salmon to their many cheesecakes. The portions are pretty big because every time I dine here I always have to ask for a to go box.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,TKjvDYX1BSuZ6ztiVn-z-g

We tried this one today since we now live in Summerlin Las Vegas and were quite disappointed. Service was very slow. Waitress was very unpleasant, snappy, and unfriendly .  Is it so difficult to smile?  At the end she just threw the bill on the table and then grabbed my credit card out of my hand instead of using the small black folder that every other waitress was using, then came back with that black folder in one hand- empty!- and my credit card in her other hand...it was weird",k3-FxbETAEwl5orFQ9QZVQ,0,0,2,CNrtcfLuGO7d01xPnVuQHg
