19603,2012-07-09,0,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"I'm a sucker for happy hour and greek food:  The Mad Greek gets it right.

Large menu, especially happy hour stuff, which the staff is more than happy to describe for those of us that don't know what things are.  

HH menu consists of $4 to $7 goodies (about a $1 off the normal prices).  Ordering 3 items is usually plenty for 2 people.  There are drinks as well ($16 pitcher of mojitos is legit), but be sure to inquire if you're not sure what's included.

Some favorites:  hummus, baba, tzazkiki (veggie platter), chicken skewer, gyro snack (open-faced gyro sandwich, sans ""fries""), and the mussels with clams.  Essentially everything I've tried has been pretty tasty.  

Next indulgence on the list: the goat cheese flambe looked and smelled delicious.

The down: it can be slow.  Although, tell the waitress if you're in a hurry or want something, and they're pretty attentive.  That said, we usually order everything at once since we know it'll be a while until we see them again.

So, if you're hungry, have some time to kill, and want to indulge in a decent beverage, this is a good place to pick.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,1,0,4,sRkH6stL5QDOI30c4iw1ag

We ordered hummus and pita, which was really good.  Next we ordered two appetizers, the Greek pizza and some sort of avocado, feta, spinach on a pita thing, both of which were ok.  The baklava was ok.  
There were quite a few customers who came in who seemed to be Greek, and they got attentive service.  The music was kind of cool.

At first and after checking some of the reviews I got a little confused and hesitant because I know my friend is into fresh, healthy, and great food. To make the long story short I agreed to try it........

We got there about 8:00 P.M. The place was pretty busy for a Super Bowl Sunday. We were greeted immediately and with the most upbeat, welcome, and respectful way. We ordered Octopus, Greek salad, Saganaki to start and, for the main course, the Lavraki fish with Horta (dandelions).

Greek salad and Saganaki (flaming Greek cheese) was very good.

Octopus, out of this world.

Lavraki fish with Horta (Dandelions) was amazing, fresh and cooked to perfection!

I could not resist to order Galaktoboureko for dessert. Like my mom's. 

Perhaps most noteworthy, besides the truly exceptional food and service we received
from Irena, Elena, Rodney and the owner Michael, was the Music and Movie History on the walls, such as: 

(Michael ""Mikis"" Theodorakis who is one of the most internationally famous Greek songwriter of over 1000 songs and composer. He scored for the films Zorba the Greek (1964), Z (1969), and Serpico in 1973) 

(Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, Nikos Kazantzakis all participated in the movie Zorba The Greek in December of 1964) 

Thank you all for the hospitality, truly exceptional food and service!

Giant, pillowy pita is packed with tons of fresh beef and lamb (NY/Chicago style), along with tomato and onions- tzatziki is packed separately to add on yourself. Fries were a bit soggy but well seasoned and flavorful, saved my salad for later.

2036432,2015-08-24,0,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"Meh, this was a disappointment. This is a full service, sit down Mad Greek location (unlike the one in Primm). Thus, the menu has some additional offerings. And it was those additional offerings that brought me here.

It's at the end of a strip mall with a cute patio. Inside is a strange mix between overload of Greek decor, hominess, and just a touch of a dive feel. It looks like the kind of place that might be cool and hopping on a weekend night once it's dark outside and there's live music and dancing happening.

The staff were nice and friendly. But the one reason we came here was a complete letdown. I love love LOVE saganaki. And I have yet to find somewhere in Vegas that offers it. Well, turns out this Mad Greek location (and not the one in Primm) does offer it. Hooray! We eagerly ordered it. And then we waited and waited and waited. It was quite a long wait for saganaki. And when it finally comes out, the waitress is unable to light it on fire. Say what? ""Oh sometimes, it doesn't work."" She was clearly confused and at first acted like she was going to take it back and fix it or get another one. But nope, she ended up leaving it. Leaving us pondering the question, is it really saganaki if it's not lit on fire? And before we could even begin to eat it, out rolls another order of saganaki for a table that was sat maybe 5 minutes prior. Clearly, our order got lost in the shuffle somehow (and there were only 3 other tables in the place). And, of course, the same waitress is able to light their's on fire. So we proceed to eat our non-fire saganaki. It's blackened on the bottom with no crisp on the sides or top. And it rather lacked any flavor. I didn't even want to eat it after the first couple of bites.

So while there may be some other delicious menu items here. And the ambiance was enjoyable enough. And the staff were friendly. Our visit was a big letdown. A total saganaki fail.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,5,0,2,G6rBTy9vvb6vPfMMd7RXVA
2119527,2011-07-17,0,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"We went to the location at Sahara and Durango in Las Vegas.  I agree with some of the others.  The food was overpriced and could have been better.  My theory is that they are trying to improve flavor with salt, (like in the stuffed grape leaves) and sugar, (the strawberry shake.)  If they want to charge higher prices, they need to improve the flavor with a balance of ingredients, and the sugar or salt shouldn't dominate. Most people can see through over salting and over sweetening.  Also the chicken gryo on the salad was overcooked and greasy.  It was almost woody.  The Greek salad was good, but you can get those anywhere these days.  The albondigas soup was also very good, but for those prices you expect everything to be memorable and top notch.

The restaurant is very large and has incredibly ornate decorations from all over Europe.  We were seated by a friendly man who took our drink order and brought them out to us shortly after.  Then... we sat for about 15 minutes before our server came over to take our order.  To start, we decided on the zucchini sticks.  I ordered the chicken gyro and my fiance ordered the beef and lamb gyro.  There was some more waiting and our zucchini finally came out.  These were delicious with the ranch dipping sauce.  Our server asked if we would like some spicy sauce too and my fiance said yes.  She never came back with it and we had finished the appetizer and decided that it was no big deal.

When our entrees arrived, mine looked unexpectedly...brown, for chicken.  I asked if it was chicken and our server said something along the lines of how she thought I had also ordered the beef and lamb.  Luckily, she brought over the correct gyro 5 minutes later.  I loved the fries, which look like little chips and the cucumber spread for the gyro was absolutely delicious.

Overall,the service was very slow that night when they were not busy.  The food and friendliness of everyone there was great, so we will return again to try out some more of their selections on the menu in the near future.",Jdx_u3PxmXLCOyP_Pkn7Sg,0,0,3,UcAjjelsU4aASO1jStw2dQ

I went early in the afternoon on a weekday and although I was one of maybe six other patrons in the restaurant at the time, the place smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. I may not have even noticed this if it was in the evening as cigarette smoke is not uncommon in Las Vegas, however I found it odd that the restaurant was so large and empty yet the smoke was so strong. 

The menu HUGE but it's very cluttered and thereby overwhelming. Most of the foods on the menu either lack a description or the description is very vague, so if you've never had Greek food before, this may not be the place to start. 

I ordered my food to-go and the hostess (who was very sweet) even offered me a drink while I looked at the menu. The food didn't take long to come out and it was all packed in a plastic bag. 

When I got home with my food, I noticed the bag was wet. I opened it and saw that the tzatziki sauce I ordered was extremely watery (the consistency was somewhere in betwen Italian salad dressing and ranch salad dressing) and was spilling out of a styrofoam to-go box. I found this to be very odd that they would pack a sauce/dip in a standard to-go box. It seems like common sense that it would spill out of it and should probably be packaged in some sort of plastic container with a lid.

Overall, I'd say the food was decent. If I lived closer to it, I might stop in once a while to satisfy a craving for Greek food. But anything more than that is a stretch.",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,1,0,2,1JJjao4K0whQb1oZomdMCA

I get it served with piping-hot fries and a small side salad. The broiled octopus (oktapodaki) is a must try. I've never tasted a more tender octopus. They offer complimentary pita while you wait for your meal. The pita is warm, yummy and has a nice soft texture. 

The waitresses are sweet and friendly and I'm a bit surprised that this place doesn't attract a larger lunch crowd. I'm guessing that this place doesn't turn around food quickly enough for the regular 1-hour lunch customer. The Mad Greek's kitschy decor may be over the top for some people but I find it interesting. I have to admit that if I look at it for a long time, it pains my aesthetics.

2936867,2012-01-18,1,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"The Mad Greek in Baker, CA has been a staple of my families many road trips back and forth to Southern CA. We would either stop on the way from Vegas or on our way back to Vegas. 

Naturally we had to check this restaurant out since it had the same name and the same infamous fresh strawberry shake. In the past year that we have discovered this place we have been here numerous times for dinner, cocktails and their wonderful happy hour. 

Between their fair pricing on their food, their personable staff and their knack for accommodating children, I have to say that I have grown to really love this place. Happy Hour is my favorite time to go, its for a couple of hours between 4pm - 6pm and offers great HH prices on drinks (beer, wine and mixed drinks) and has a pretty good tapas-esque HH menu. I was here recently for happy hour with my 2 year old son and my girlfriend. Neither of us had any cocktails but we ordered quite a bit from the tapas menu. I always start with a HH sized Greek salad, its my favorite, so full of flavor including olives and tons of feta. I order the Greek fries with feta for my son who loves french fries (these are more like home-style fries,) and the spanikopita (spinach and cheese filled phyllo dough.) My friend ordered the coconut shrimp, a small Greek salad and the goat cheese flambe (which was not en flambe lol.) We shared everything we had and it was ALL so yummy!  We were all full and the bill came out to be about $30 or so. You really cannot beat that price for all the food we got. 

One of the other reasons I like coming to the Mad Greek is how kid-friendly they are. Every time we are there the employees light up when they see my son and my son equally lights up when he sees the Mad Greek sign. After every meal they always ask if its ok to give him an ice cream sundae and always check to make sure he is a happy camper. The Greek has a dance floor with a stage for the times they do live music (which is GREAT!) and my son loves to get on that dance floor and show his moves off - they all love it. 

Make sure to sit outside when the weather is a bit warmer, the patio is (as other reviewers have stated) in a parking lot but it is closed off and has a great ambiance, especially at night with the heat lamps and the fire pit. The Mad Greek is often on Restaurants.com and getting a certificate is a great way for a first timer to try out the restaurant. OPA!!",AFiFCVIqbyBrkL5AIeMUjA,1,1,5,Cb8ySlBbxzj5mnJBv3Q1QA
2947133,2015-01-07,0,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"Second bad experience with service. We went for lunch around 1:00 or so. Felt very rushed from the time we were seated until the time we got up. When our server walked up to our table, all she said was ""You ready?"" We'd just sat down, so we quickly put in our drink order and told her we needed a few minutes. She came back right away while we were still looking over our menus and said it again, ""You ready?"" If we would have gotten the server that was waiting on the table next to us, it would have been a very nice overall experience. She was helpful with the menu, gave menu options, pleasantly took special requests and didn't rush the patrons whatsoever. We got the opposite. Not helpful with the menu at all and made us feel like we needed to hurry. Everything came out together. Including our side salads. Since it had been a while for our food to come out, I figured she'd at least ask if we wanted her to bring out the hummus or side salads before our meal. I would have overlooked that but overall she was rude. At the end of our quick lunch, she stood there staring at my plates, basically rushing me, when I was putting my unfinished food in my take home box. She should have come back for the plates when I was done or offered to plate it for me if she was in such a hurry to take the plates away. I wasn't being slow. She also saw that we needed more than one take home box but didn't seem to care that I was putting it all together in one box. So since she was just standing there staring, I took that as an opportunity to ask her for another box. She came back and still just stood there waiting for my plate. As far as ""you ready"" and not asking what choices we wanted as our sides, either she doesn't speak English very well or just didn't care to take the time, or both. She was also wiping and blowing her nose behind the bar without washing her hands. I watched her just walk off after she threw her wadded up tissue in the trash. She was just plain rude. Maybe we'll see if we can request our server the next time we go. 

Our food was great. Piping hot and fresh. Ordered from the lunch menu. Hubs enjoyed the beef and lamb gyro. I had the hummus and pita (I went easy on the pita. It was hard not to eat more than I did) and I also had the stuffed grape leaves. If I wasn't watching my waist line I would have welcomed on the numerous warm soft pita strips. From what I've read on Yelp, they continue to fill the basket. They're soo good but I still went easy. Same with the generous amount of creamy sauce topped with capers that came on the grape leaves. I enjoyed some of it but mostly ate around it. Next time, I'll ask for sauce on the side or just easy on the sauce. The rice was perfect. The side salad was nice. It was all very good. Since it was lunch and I'm going easy with my portions, I ate a small amount of everything. Therefore, I had an entire meal to take home. They really do give you large portions. Ladies, if you're you're eating light and are going there with your girlfriends, it would be easy to order hummus and split an entree and be completely satisfied.

The Band was Loud, and took forever to noisily set up.

We ordered two of the flaming saganaki.. they took forever,  and then dumped  on the table.. one barely   aflame, the other.. nothing, dada, zip.

3257870,2011-08-31,0,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"It's official. I am on a quest for the best gyro in town!

I've been to the Mad Greek a few times this summer and I am glad I did.  Before then over a year ago I was at this location and we had some bad experiences.  The server got our order wrong and then proceeded to lie to my wife that it WAS what she ordered when it in fact wasn't.  They couldn't keep their story straight and someone else acknowledged that it was wrong and gave it to us on the house and ordered the right thing for her.  After that experience we stayed away for a while.

I'm all for giving it another try after time has passed and I'm glad we did.

The first time in a while that we went, it was on a Wednesday and it was kind of late.  We sat outside  and it was pretty dark.  The blue lights they usually had on wasn't on.  No matter - we were there for the food!

I ordered the Gyro Plate which had beef & lamb with tzatziki sauce, an unlimited supply of pitas and for dessert we shared a ""bomba"" which is like two hard-shelled scoops of ice cream.   It was very good!

The last time I was here was very fun! They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am not going to lie. The live music was SO CHEESY!  So cheesy in fact, that I thought I was in a Napoleon Dynamite movie.  But because the music was like that, I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  Seriously! I had a great time.

We sat outside again and they had the blue lights on this time.  Only bad thing was that the table we sat at didn't have a burning candle. :P

Our server was very attentive and we got our orders taken quickly and our food as well.

For an appetizer I ordered the dolmades and it was exquisite.  For the main course I ordered the Onassis Burger.  Delicious!  It was like a large cheeseburger topped with pastrami.  We also had free pita bread that we ate with the sauce from the dolmades. 

My wife ordered the greek salad (the big one) and it was HUGE!  Next time we come, she said she would order the smaller one.  The waitress girl asked her the question earlier ""are you sure you want the bigger one?""  Now we know why she did.

And to top off the meal we each had our own order of bomba.  It was $5 each, but oh-so-worth-it.   I loved everything about that night. I had a great time and the food was great.

Our waitress was great.

The only negative thing is that sitting out side is kind of ghetto.  All the cars driving by the smiths, the pedestrian traffic, the crazy drivers and neighborhood idiots sure know how to make themselves known.  Next time we come, we are going to be sitting inside for sure.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,1,0,4,SHVsuNzm-rcn5SOYn4ypkw

I had the NY style gyro (which is lamb and beef mix) with fries. The gyro had very tender and well flavored meat. It was a large gyro. I hear people complain about the price but for the portions that they give you I thought it was very reasonable, especially if you compare it to gyro times where the price is the same and the gyro is way smaller. The only suggestion I have is ease up on the dill in the Tzatziki. It was a little over powering. Good food, good service and clean restaurant.

Now in the daylight, the patio decor may seem somewhat gaudy but it is shady and comfy.  At night it is a lot prettier.  It could be the perfect place to hang out.

Unfortunately the food & drinks leave so much to be desired and I so wanted to fall back in love with The Mad Greek since changing from The Golden Greek.

We ordered the Saganaki.  The cheese did not have the same taste as before and although the server lit it on fire in front of us, it was still hard in the middle. The hummus and pita were good. The fried zucchini and greek fries were good when hot-we got them barely warm and the tzatziki sauce was average.  We also ordered the shrimp cocktail, goat cheese flambe and a phyllo pastry with cheese insde were good.

The service was slow as far as the food was concerned but the servers themselves were attentive.  Given their attentiveness the rate of food coming from the kitchen must have been due to the kitchen and not a fault of the servers.  Our first server was new and was quick to tell us when she was unable to answer our questions BUT she went to go find out! How rare is that these days?

We started off with pomegranite martinis.  Yuck.  All I tasted was vodka and it was not worth $8.00.  Same for the mango mojito.  Too sweet-did not even finish.  My husband ordered cheesecake and my friend ordered the tiramisu.  They agreed that the desserts were average & most likely not homemade-nothing that a cheaper Sara Lee could not satisfy.

(""Our chef doesn't like to do that,"" she said, STILL bringing out the veggies. Where some restaurants' menus make it clear they don't do substitutions, Mad Greek's does not.)

One time the Gyros sandwich will be fantastic and the next time it will be average at best. We were in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and ordered 4 of the Gyros and side dish combos and 3 of the 4 were great: fresh soft pita, moist gyros meat with maybe a few pieces with crunchy edges mixed in and good sauce. However, I was the one who really wanted a great Gyros and as Murphy's Law would have it, I had the Gyros with a crunchier pita bread and more pieces with crunchier edges on the meat. It was disappointing for me but great for my family.

If they had hit 4 out 4 of the gyros sandwich, I could have given them a 4 rating but being out in Vegas once a year or so it was disappointing for me. We were about 15 minutes away from the restaurant so it wasn't worth it to drive back to get another Gyros especially since I was starving.

Lastly, there was one young lady who kept checking to make sure we had been helped because we were waiting by the door for our take-out order.

For years, every trip to Cali has included a stop at this historic and amazing restaurant, and it has never failed to please.  Massive, wonderfully thick milkshakes, mouthwatering well spiced gyro meat, AMAZING cheeseburgers, the best fried zucchini you've ever tried.  The original location in Baker is out of this world...

So when they started opening them right here in Vegas, it's needless to say that I was THRILLED...and then I ate here, at the location on Sahara.  I don't know who trained these cooks, but they must love their spices.  I've had Thai food that wasn't this spicy.  I ordered a Gyro, a Cheeseburger, an order of Fried Zucchini, and 2 milkshakes for my wife and I.  

The gyro and cheeseburger both got thrown away after about 2 bites because they were somehow lacking flavor while at the same time being too spicy to eat.  I really have no idea how they managed it.  The zucchini was slimy and limp.  the milkshakes were the only part of the meal that we finished, and while being better than average, they were nowhere near the foodgasm experience that I am willing to drive 2 hours to enjoy.

They call this the Mad Greek...Their name is the same.  Their menu is mostly the same.  Their prices are about the same.  Their decor is the same.  Their food is NOT.  If you are an avid Mad Greek fan from way back, do not come here expecting the food that you know and love from that California gem.  

This place embodies why so many restaurants fail when they try to expand into additional locations.  The quality suffers and they lose their regulars.  As much as I love the idea of having one close to home, I'll wait for my next trip to go back to the original.  This one is pretty bad.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,2,1,2,t8e19sxMixJLmqZdLjgLOw

I'd never been to such a HUGE Greek restaurant ever!  There were white Greek lawn ornaments on the roof of their restaurant, a dance floor inside, and a huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling.

I ordered the stuffed grape leaves (my favorite) and their small Greek salad.  The grape leaves didn't come with any dipping sauce, but they were still good.

There was a crazy hamburger on the menu that consisted of a heaping of pastrami on top of the burger patty!  I don't usually order burgers at restaurants, so I just read about it.",9wguNnzhmEJe_AAvTwK71g,1,1,4,dlnjS4xOtT6Ttbg_ZnruSA

I wouldn't say I'm a Mediterranean food connoisseur, but I know good food.

This place has good food.  

My fiancé and I stumbled in there for dinner on Christmas day.  We had celebrated with family on Christmas Eve and all day Christmas and we wanted to ""get away"" for some ""us"" time.  We walked in and were seated right away.  They were slow because EVERYTHING in Summerlin was closed that day and people probably figured they were too.  I was surprised that they had a HUGE FULL bar, a karaoke stage, dance floor, huge projection tv, and the blue lighting made the place seem fun and festive.  I could definitely see a birthday party there.

Anyways, we ordered the hummus and pita, lamb shank plate, and lamb gyro.  EVERYTHING was good.  the hummus, the pita (which we got more of at no charge), the lamb, the GYRO was amazing, and the rice.  Dang that rice was good!

I am giving them 5 stars because the food was AWESOME.  Yes, the service could probably be better (waitress had to be reminded of things, but was SUPER nice), but we're talking $11-$17 meals.  It's not an arm and a leg ...and you're getting generous portions in a fun environment with relatively nice service.  So, I would gladly, GLADLY have the ""okay"" service and awesome food for that price.

The restaurant itself was decorated in a gaudy style with murals of the Acropolis and other Greek style architecture on the walls and ceilings. They have a full sized bar which during HH, all drinks are discounted, even non-alcoholic ones.

We hadn't looked at yelp prior to visiting obviously, but after our meal, I managed to look at the reviews on here and the other reviewers were spot on regarding the book of the menu. The listings are really confused with Japanese and Italian offerings as well -- namely, sashimi and pasta.

We stuck to the appetizer menu which consists of cold appetizers and hot appetizers -- taking up 3 pages.

Taramosalata -- this wasn't bad but the taste of caviar did not come through

Melanzanasalata -- or something like that  -- eggplant dip. This was nice and had a tart finish

Spanokopita -- FAIL! The Trader Joe's version is far better. It was obvious that they had originally baked it and then when someone orders it, they popped it into the deep fryer to heat it up. Totally disgusting!!

Falafel -- not grainy but rather, mushy and very dense! I didn't like these much

Dolmas -- their version had meat and rice inside instead of just rice. There is also this creamy-ish white sauce on it which didn't enhance these at all. Pass!

Greek pizza -- pretty awful even the young man didn't want to eat it. We took it back to the hotel but no one even attempted to eat it so we ended up throwing it away. 

Greek cheese and olive plate -- this was a winner. We liked this one a lot. Two types of cheeses were offered along with Kalamata olives.

Did I think the food was good? Not particularly. But some items weren't bad, the rest, just plain awful. If I had to pay full price I'd definitely tell you to pass! It's not worth it. However, at 50% off, our bill was actually quite reasonable for what we ate. I was even able to overlook some of the grosser items. Hubby had two drinks, one alcoholic and a Greek cherry juice. I had an iced tea. Our bill? About $40. Now double it and you're looking at $80. For $80 I'd say it was a totally awful meal. For $40? It's easier to swallow!

They should call this place The Bad Greek. Actually, maybe the name is a warning... ""if you arrive here a happy Greek once you try our terrible food you will leave a Mad Greek"".  I don't know who is back there making the food, but the cook should be sent to live with the Turks in Cyprus for being so impressively bad at being Greek. Maybe this place was opened by a Turkish housewife as a passive-aggressive jab at the Greeks. I could sit and do nothing but speculate all day as to how these people got so truly terrible at life, but then I would get hungry eventually, which might cause me to need to eat more of their crappy food.

Kidding aside, we Greeks are a very hungry people.  If you are luring starving Greeks to your establishment, the most important thing you should know is that eating is not a joke to us.  So don't burn the freaking spanakopita.  Especially if you didn't even bother to put more than a half teaspoon of filling in it... ESPECIALLY if one of the minuscule four burnt ""spinach pie"" nibblets doesn't even have the correct filling in it!!!  Did someone drop some jam in there?  Why was it sweet??  And why did the nibblets consist of almost nothing but burnt phyllo dough?!  This I do not like. This is merely a reminder of what could have been.

Everything else was mediocre at best...
Pre-made cheap Italian dressing on my Anatolia salad that you can't call a ""salata"" unless you want to confuse them.
Dolmades piled sloppily under a sea of bland mystery sauce, loosely rolled as though they were Taco Bell burritos, filled with unvarying smoosh and what appeared to be instant rice.
Pre-crumbled feta... WTF?  Are they really so lazy that they cringe at the prospect of clasping their hand a few times to break up some blocks of feta?!

None of this should matter to any Greek reading this... Because they had the audacity to serve me badly burnt spanakopita with no filling.  It was like a pastry version of the worst frozen potstickers you've ever eaten.  How dare they!!

What they have created in the charliefoxtrot (clusterfffff) that is The Mad Greek is worse than spitting on my food... They have spit on my soul.  Don't mess with hungry Greeks!!!  Not cool.  Every time someone goes here to eat someone's yiayia drops dead... So save a yiayia and don't ever eat here!!!",p-c3Zs6Z_0sFo6tPr46axA,9,4,1,2bIzEsXn2Ply_0lGNW78Gw

Now that my complaining is out of the way, on to the good parts. First of all - the escargot! Oh my juicy snail goodness! Not only are they perfectly cooked and seasoned, but they provide the largest portion of escargot I've come across in Vegas. With that for a starter, I'm sold. I went with the grill plate - a mountain of meats with seasoned rice. While I wasn't a fan of the meatballs, every other item on the platter was delicious. Finished off with a couple of glasses of wine and you've got a very happy fat kid.

The gyro meat is standard fare. However, you will have to experience an explosion of Greek decor and an equally massive menu. The mere size of the menu leaves you concerned that things can't be too fresh, and for me, it has a psychological effect. Can they really serve up the best steak, freshest fish and Greek egg rolls done right?  

The seemingly low prices trick you into ordering a lot more and before we knew it we had spent a little over $40. I tried the babaganoush, and despite big hunks of eggplant, I thought it was fair. The pita was what I would describe as the white bread equivalent of pita, thick and doughy, which can be good, but I appreciate a lighter pita.

Our server was nice even though she did forget to bring our drinks until after the first round of food had hit the table. I can't really put my finger on it, but the overall experience didn't leave me eager to return.

5204610,2009-07-24,2,SXV_yKYUAFvQJirAhF0tWQ,"I really should have checked out the Yelp review for this place BEFORE I decided to visit it on a whim.

I really wanted to like this place. My brother's wife's mother owns a restaurant called the Mad Greek, which is a fabulous place. I thought for sure, any place that shares the name would share the food and atmosphere. I guess I was mistaken.

So before I walk in I look at the sign to see if they were open. The sign was off, so I probably should have taken the hint and left, but I decided to go in anyway. I am greeted by a waiter, who is in the middle of taking someone's order, and who I cannot seem to understand. I just end up walking out to the patio area because it seemed like fresh air would be nice. Well fresh air mixed with smoke would have to do.

So a minute or two later, the waitress comes up and gives me the menu to look at and takes my drink order. When she comes back I immediately order an appetizer, the baba ganoush. She seems totally clueless as to what I just ordered and nearly yanks the menu out of my hands so she can take it with her because she needs it to remember the order. I know, WTF?

The baba ganoush comes nearly immediately. My guess is that they have it premade and just slap it on a dish and go. I tell the waitress that I need a minute to decide for my entree. It turns out that I need a minute equates to don't come and check on me for literally 20 minutes! In fact I don't see the waitress again until after my order comes back, so instead I end up flagging down the bus boy who luckily came out to clean up the table of the only other group that was out on the patio. 

I ask him to get the waitress, but he insists that he can take my order, in very broken English I can barely understand. I tell him my order and he is sounds confused. So I point to the two items on the menu. The guy still seems a little clueless, but walks off repeating the order to himself, only to return moments later. He has a pen, highlights menu items I ordered, and takes the menu with him. At this point I'm really unsure if I'll even be getting what I ordered if neither the waitress nor the bus boy can remember very simplistic orders.

After all is said and done, the food was not very appetizing. I ate little but the baba ganoush (which was decent) and I ended up taking the okra home. I told the waitress not to box the soup that I hardly touched. So she asks, ""Didn't you like it?"" At that point I was kind of dumbfounded. Why else would I ask NOT to take it home. It was that atrocious. Do I have to spell it out?

Now that I see the other reviews I don't feel so horrible giving this place one star. It seems there is a consensus on this place. I really need to get an iPhone already so I can check reviews before I make these bad dining decisions.",5iOHz6pHmXi9SoB5qomRWQ,3,0,1,Yxpv0FC9T_XkGscPf7-agg

There are two locations; one in Baker (near Death Valley) and then one near the entrance to LV. It's usually packed so if you like Greek food, then this may be for you. From what I remember, the falalel balls were tasty and weren't overly fried. A creamy Tahini sauce accompanies most dishes which is perfect since the weather here is HOT! The restaurant designed with roman statues and columns on the outside so you can't miss it when you are exiting. The inside is more like a greek cafeteria and is congested with a lot of seating space and people to match. The Baker stop has an option for a decent bathroom and like I said before, if you look to the left of the Mad Greek, you will see a large pole showing the temperature.

Change from once Greek place to another and have been always curious.  I can say now, never again.

We came early, based on other yelp reviews I was excited to try out the happy hour menu. The waitress hands us the most confusing menu I've ever seen. There's a space with a piece of paper with new menu items taped over one section, and black sharpie crossing things out.  I did not see the happy hour menu, so when I asked our waitress about it she explained that they no longer serve happy hour because they've updated their menu with lunch specials. I found this was strange. Service over all was okay, but the waitress seemed a bit confused.

On to the horrible!
Bacon wrapped shrimp-4 tiny pieces of charcoal were delivered to us. Shrimp1 looked burnt but as I bit close to the tail it was frozen, shrimp 2 was burnt on the outside raw on the inside. Obviously the cook took frozen shrimp, wrapped bacon sound it, and put it under the broiler until it was burnt, thinking the shrimp would be cooked.
Babbaganosh- This was okay, not the best I've ever had. But the only thing we readily ate.
Meat (?) pita- not sure if this was beef or lamb since we were never asked  what meat we wanted, but again it was thrown under a broiler and over cooked so it really didn't matter what kinda of meat it was. Everything else on the platter was average.
Ground beef with cheese- I don't remember what this was called on the menu. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked, and it was of course extra well done and burnt outside. The seasoning and meat was tender and good, they need to serve this meatball style. But where's the cheese??? It was supposed to have Kayseri cheese, but I saw cheese nowhere.

There has some interesting things that on the menu that I would like to try, but not there.  They clearly feel like having a million crappy menu items (potstickers anyone) is better than having attention to detail and a handful of good, well cooked menu items that highlight  the ethnicity of the restaurant.",phN05ig92DhH3GVlgqR6bQ,0,0,2,nCO2SauJf-aKqm7FVkR-Yw

She also ordered the Baba ghanoush appetizer, I have never had that but, I keep dreaming about it and I don't even like eggplant that much. The chicken breast I had was phenomenal! The seasoning they use is delicious and they did not overlook my chicken, it's was perfectly juicy! I was very pleased, so much so that I wish I lived closer. It would be my regular spot for a healthy lunch or dinner.
Here is a great tip, my friend goes at least once a week with her friends, they have some kind of deal going on, if you buy a glass of wine you get an appetizer, if you order a bottle, I believe it's 4.

But ultimately? It looks like a hodgepodge of everything Greek, white, and blue with a bare bones table setting. NOT impressive.

Our waitress forgot to give us two menus, silverware, and napkins. We ordered iced tea, and it turns out it's some kind of passion fruit tea even though it isn't listed as such. Menu looks like a mess, too. Makes it feel less like a reputable restaurant. We finally gave up on figuring out what to order and just had calamari to snack on. It was good calamari, but not good enough to warrant coming back just for them. I think the only part I really enjoyed was the ample basket of toasted pita bread that came with it.

Not to mention, the patronage is odd. We sat between a table of very old people in suits and a table of head-to-toe tattooed gangsters sipping a strawberry shake with whipped cream. Picture that.

The bonus was my Restaurant.com certificate.

I would have loved to sit in the patio, but it was too chilly.  Have they not heard of patio heaters?  With all the renovation that went on here, you'd think they could have run over to Costco and bought a few of 'em.  But nooooo.  There was one measly gas-fed fire pit in the center of a table.  It had a real log burning, but the remaining table space wouldn't have been big enough for any plates.  So we sat inside.

Black and white marble tile floors are surrounded by white walls and those big industrial heating ducts painted in Greek Isles blue.  I could have been on Mykonos - or Israel.  Same colors.

We waited a long time for someone to take our drink orders.  We were just ordering coffee, but it took forever to arrive.  Mine - the high test version - was room temp, so I sent it back.  But it wasn't replaced until we managed to snag a waiter, which would have been easier if just one of us had a cane with a big hook.  Our waiter kept flying by so fast that it was almost necessary to trip him to get his attention.

Three of us decided to share an order of saganaki, a Greek salad, and the 17-item appetizer assortment.  The fourth, on a special diet, ordered grilled salmon.

The salmon came out charred, dried out and overcooked, and she had to send it back.  The replacement was okay, but nothing to write home about.  She said it tasted like it had enjoyed a lengthy vacation in the freezer.

The saganaki was blah.  It tasted to me like fried fish.  Not to the others, but they didn't like it, either.  The Greek salad was very nice, but was a little stingy on the feta.  

The appetizer platter is said to serve two people, but with the other stuff we ordered, it was too much for us three.  It was uneven:  the calamari were terrible:  soggy, too chewy, and not hot enough.  The gyro meat was way too salty for me, but then, everything always is.  It also had decent tabbouli, eggplant salad, beef sausage, ground kebab meat, but mediocre hummus, a completely charred pepper, and two boring chicken wings.

The food wasn't bad enough to say that I'd never return, but it sure needs some improvement.  The patio is definitely a plus, hence the extra star.  But it will have to be much warmer to get me back to this place.

The best part came at the end.  With the coupon, the whole food experience cost the three of us who shared the meal just $10 each, and that's including the 18% gratuity that was added on.  And the waiter regaled us each with a piece of baklava to take home, which was a very nice touch, considering we'd spent so little.

For tapas we ordered broiled calamari, bacon wrapped dates, spinach puff, crab and shrimp puff and something else I can't remember at the moment. The price was ok, considering we got a pitcher of mojitos that amounted to about three full cups each for me and my fella. 

The food didn't blow me away and the service was incredibly slow in the beginning. Our waitress apologized profusely for keeping us waiting so long and was pleasant and helpful for the rest of our meal. 

All in all, good place for happy hour, which is 4-7 daily. They also have certificates available for purchase through the restaurant .com site, but they are not valid for happy hour items.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,3,6eAGeebob00OVFqdqoZ8Hw
