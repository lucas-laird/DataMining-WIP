1091,2015-10-17,0,FqJ1SWEBhgVl66FrcsovOQ,We came here on a Friday around 5:00. I was a little nervous because of the other reviews but all in all it was a great experience. It's not like I was expecting much for 4.99. We have 3 kids and since kids under 4 eat free we fed our family for under $20! The pizza was fresh and hot and they kept different varieties coming out all the time. The tables were clean as were the bathrooms. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would absolutely go back to this location.,4nlF6QV8SVpnNUcN2qNdqA,1,0,4,7zBs0pdvjArtKjVR7RH7yQ
46532,2016-10-23,0,FqJ1SWEBhgVl66FrcsovOQ,I was disappointed there had to be at 5 to 7 people on duty and the pizza was hard and cheese was all dried out the kids running it were more concerned about bickering back and forth about there video games and social life then helping customers and keeping the place clean the only person working hard was an older gentle named Tim and all the pizza you tried to pick up fell off onto the counter because they can't figure out how to slice a pizza so you can pick it up without four other pieces attached I literally watch at least five people get pissed of and have to grab two tools to cut the pizza again to grab a slice. The deserts had also been out way to long the cinnamon rolls were hard as a rock the staff could literally care less.,_P6Law-9HnhQ06BMne28ag,3,0,1,bOefRuRe1-JzsahVIY6C8Q

Pro's: Jalapenos in the salad bar to put on bland pizza, pasta for the kiddos, kids can pick their own and feel big. That crazy mac and cheese pizza. The crust is bready/soft (better than cardboard). 

Con's: most were lacking flavor, texture. It's cheap pizza that they shuttle out in a variety of ways, I picked up a couple plates that were dirty before getting to a clean one. They had brownies for dessert... I didn't even try one because of how they looked :(

I would have given at least 3 stars but before we left had seen the manager heading back into the kitchen picking his teeth and wipe his nose with his hands.  He then went behind the counter and grabed a paper towel.   He Didnt even wash his hands before touching the food. ( I guess I should say that right where he grabbed the paper towel is a sink).  He then  used the paper towel to wipe his nose while moving food around. Come on how hard is it to go into the restroom or step out  of sight of the customers.   I am completely disgusted and will never eat there again.  If you can witness that in plain sight what can't tou see going on?,CtEakn1RGyPs97tfPfnYVg,0,0,1,LhSQsWY_A-QvJ7qjDJNO2w

The food is actually decent, compared to the UNLV location (gross). I got a personal pizza, but I also tried a couple things on the line and they weren't terrible. The personal pizza was made to order and very easy tasty.

I was inside between 630 and 730 on a Saturday, which is their busy time, but they kept the place running well. It was pretty loud because everyone brought their kids, but the location is big enough that it wasn't too obnoxious.",NcxVQhNlw219Grdp0yEP8Q,0,0,4,n2zETSqJYmUsUtMpfIYsPw

I'm a member of a fraternal group that has a 2-hour meeting at a nearby business, beginning at 10 AM.  When we're done at Noon, we're hungry, and Cici's is conveniently located a short distance away.  But, that's not the reason I go there.

I judge an establishment by the way the personnel treat me and my friends, and I've never been treated better, anywhere else, than I am here. Manager Blake Beaudoin and his staff are truly unique, when it comes to dispensing excellent customer service, and THAT is what brings me back, time after time.

Blake greets me by name when I walk in the front door with my guests (I usually pick up the tab with my gambling winnings), and not only does he recall my name, he also remembers MY ORDER (double sausage, mushrooms, onions & black olives) and prepares it, almost without checking.  And, even though Blake is the manager of the place, you can see him mopping a floor or delivering pizzas to guests, just like any other employee.  He refuses to sit back in his office, shuffling papers; he wants to be where ""the action"" is.

The quality of the food is terrific, of course, but as good as it is, it can't equal the splendid service one gets, at this particular location.

Don't misunderstand me, please.  At any of the Cici's locations, you'll receive good food and great service, but at this specific venue, Blake Beaudoin truly exceeds my expectations, every time.

I guess that has to do with him being from Montana, where some of the friendliest folks on Planet Earth are known to live.

Do I have any ""complaints"" at all?  Just one.  The men's restroom has NO MIRROR, due to vandalism by some inconsiderate slobs.  However, all-metal mirrors are available, so perhaps one day, they might install one.

If you stop by this place, you'll definitely have good food and good times, and you'll become a ""regular,"" just like me.",EMqsN7DTFnR_VywY1SEc5w,2,1,5,0kFSHLnLkmL5K_ibu9zzAQ

Food is usually fairly decent and service (at least at this location) has always been very good to us. Finding a coupon is usually not very difficult and it can knock off a few bucks or even get a second person in free, so don't hesitate to do a quick search before going! 

The big thing that draws us here though is that for the price of the buffet, you can just walk up to the guy behind the buffet counter and request a custom pizza order! So if you don't like what is currently being offered, just ask for what you'd like, they give you a little colored cone, and in a few minutes you get a fresh pizza at your table! We always do this since we like the veggie combo and it tends to vanish pretty fast on the buffet line. 

Big turn off for this place is the whole buying drinks on their own business. Bah, a buffet should include the drinks in my opinion... ah well. Still, good food for a cheap price and when you are on a budget this place is pretty sweet. Also, the cinnamon buns are awesome!",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,1,0,3,DejuT5Skt1JbWkOM_vZUEw

After 4 employees going back and forth on who would ask him, I told them since no one could decide on who was going to assist me, I'd do it myself. The manager ""Josh"" (if that is his real name because no one wears name tags) was rude and walked away several time in the middle of me informing him on what his employees were telling guest about the desert. He stated that if I wanted to wait 3 hrs for the desert they could make it and walked away. After the last time he walked away, I asked the female employee who was taking the pizza out of the oven what his name was she laughed and said Josh.

I wanted to use the remaining balance on my gift card but the cashier nor her 2 helpers could figure out how to do a partial payment. They tried really hard and was super nice the whole 3 minutes but they failed to figure it out. Not a big deal though. I had cash.

The restaurant and the worker were both very clean. I like when the workers constantly clean and make the pizza look presentable. It makes me feel like I'm not going to get food poisoning. The workers in the back would organize the pizza and the pizza slice servers every couple minutes.

The pizzas were pretty good. They kept them hot and fresh. There were only a few out though, I think because there were only 5 or 6 tables of customers. Either way, I ordered a custom pizza. They lady was really helpful and friendly when she took my order. It came out after a few minutes and it was good.

They were all very helpful and friendly now that I think about it. Even the lady that cleaned the table was nice. She didn't just pick up plates. She asked me if I was done with anything. I like her technique because I hate when I put something to the side and go back for it and it's missing.

The water was cold and delicious. It tasted so fresh. It tasted better than bottled water. I'm sure they have nothing to do with it, but for the record, they have the best tasting water I've had since coming to Vegas. It taste nothing like watered down Sprite or Pink Lemonade nor did it taste like a pool. Most places have one of those scenario.

Lastly, the brownies were ok. I like the fact that they were not really gooey and mushy like most Cici's. They were decent, except they were not warm. They were just there. Nothing much more special.

Also, I wish that I could take the unfinished pizza I ordered to go. I hate wasting food and the pizza isn't 1 or 2 slices. It's rather large. It's a little bigger than a personal. If you order a pizza, order it before you start eating. It's hard to finish if your already on the edge of bursting!

MUCH better than Roundtable Pizza, with the word ""pizza"" being questionable.

The flat bread pizzas weren't bad with Chicken Parm flatbread pizza being pretty good along with another flatbread pizza which had a balsamic drizzle. I have no idea what that was!  The macaroni and cheese pizza was brought out as we were leaving. 

The two female managers were very nice and NO attitude like the store in Carlstadt NJ, near where Iused to live that had closed shortly after it opened. 


The small salad bar was decent as well.

Among them were the cover to the ice dispenser (where the ice is dumped in) uncovered allowing dirt/insects to potentially enter, the cover, itself, was lying on the floor and employees were placing dirty dishes on it, the trash cans used to bring the ice to the dispenser was very filthy and was not marked, as is the health regulation, ""FOR ICE ONLY"". In addition all of the employees that I saw used only water to wash their hands. NO SOAP WAS EVER USED. When I spoke to one of the ""managers"", a young Asian woman, she just shrugged and didn't seem to care about my complaints. When we were leaving the CiCi's one of the employees followed us outside and verbally harassed as well as started yelling at us. This was reprehensible. I will never eat at a CiCi's again. The company's regard for sanitary conditions leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure if this CiCi's violates health regulations they all do.

To argue and refuse service to paying customers,and create a scene for$16.00 is absurd. Before you  attempt to rebuke this post - understand that your opinion in favor of this ignorant policy does not matter. 

When Cici's agreed to take Visa/MasterCard, they agreed to abide by the Card Association Rules -and cannot routinely demand ID if a customer presents a valid signed credit card. I believe that this is a violation of privacy and demanding ID still does not  protect them from fraudulent transactions, chargebacks,or credit card fraud. Citing an ignorant company policy advising them to break rules or laws, does not make the action permissible. To overlook this transgression against customers is to overlook the employee abuse,sexual harassment, immigrant abuse that is likely occurring in this  chain as well.

To add insult, they were loud and argumentative while I was in line with a large group for my daughters soccer team pizza party. I had to leave and go to an ATM to get cash. 

I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT INTO ANY ONE OF THESE STORES AGAIN. I WILL VEHEMENTLY GO OUT OF MY WAY TO LET EVERYONE KNOW NOT TO PATRONIZE THIS STORE, AND THIS CHAIN.

I am also asking everyone that has been ignorantly carded to file a complaint with Visa https://usa.visa.com/checkoutfees/contact.jsp -check the last box and put in the comments that the  store displayed Visa signage,but refused to accept your card without ID.

Not only do the serve pizza here, they have a salad bar, soup, and even pasta! I'm not sure what it was that we paid to get in this place, but I simply can't get enough of it.

Macaroni Pizza
BBQ Chicken Pizza
Buffalo Chicken Pizza
Spinach Pizza
Taco Pizza -----this is my all time favorite

There are a few that I haven't mentioned, you just have to go to this place and check it out for yourself. If you don't see a certain pizza you want to try, you can always ask the cooks to make a few slices for you and they'll be more than welcome to help you out.

There are also some desserts also, that I haven't mentioned only because sweets aren't my cup of tea and I'm not sure how they taste. Although the wifey says their great, I trust here because she sure knows her sweets. Pasta, soup and salad are good too, not top notch but good enough to get you satisfied.
