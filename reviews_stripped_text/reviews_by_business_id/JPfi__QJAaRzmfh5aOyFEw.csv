My husband had previously tried this place while on a short trip to Vegas and brought me to try it out this time. We ordered the beef pancake, Shang beef noodle soup, dan dan noodles, and the spicy wontons. For both noodle dishes, we got the hand-pulled noodles. They have the options of knife cut (wide, chewy noodles), hand-pulled (not-too-thick-but-thicker-than-spaghetti, al dente noodles), and plain (their thinnest option, machine cut noodles). The flavor for both were good, though the beef noodle broth could have been richer/deeper. The dan dan was not as Szechuan-spicy as other places I've had it at but it was still enjoyable. This dan dan also did not have sesame paste in their sauce, but each place has their own version of the sauce. 

The wontons and pancake were great as well. I do wish their wontons were a little bigger but it's not a big deal. The pancakes were perfectly pan fried and browned on the bottom, and there was a good amount of soup when biting into it. The meat filling was also slightly dry but not overly so. 

Would definitely come back and eat here again!",Z6v-MUfu9uUphPL_670IwA,1,0,4,LfYljHNs30obeqwmWMxKjg

I was lucky to be their very first customer and I've got to say that this place is absolutely amazing great food , great prices, and great service.

I returned a few days later with my family my wife had the beef noodle soup I had the pork noodle soup and my son had the seafood noodle soup... all with the pulled noodles of course as they offer three different types of noodles.

Even though this is technically off the strip, it's definitely worth the short drive; one, because of the reasonable price point, and two (and most importantly), the food is really good! The night before I visited this place, my dad and I had some pretty bland noodles and dumplings at some resto in Ceasar's Palace, and not only did it not hit the spot, but we paid an absurd amount for what we got. Our dining experience here was a different story. Everything was super tasty and the noodles were a really good texture/consistency - perfectly al dente.

The bowl came out with the noodles nestled nicely in the bowl with nice big chunks of beef sticking out and three perfectly blanched pieces of baby bok choy. The noodles were nice and chewy with a bite to them, this was the most enjoyable part. The soup was okay, I've had better broth. I expect beef noodle soup to be a bit spicy but there's was not so I had to add a scoop of the chili oil. There could've been more depth to the flavor of the broth too but it was good with nice beef flavor. The spicy wontons were good but nothing very exciting.Several pieces of smallish wontons in a nice briny soy sauce with chili oil and sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I left feeling satisfied so no complaints about the food. Only con would be that they have $10 minimum for credit cards.

-Shang's Beef Noodle Soup
-Pork Belly Noodle Soup
-Jia Jang Mein (bean paste noodle, soupless)

We also ordered the spicy wonton appetizer (10 very tasty, very tiny wontons). Overall the soups were flavored very nicely, but for us the noodles were too thick and almost undercooked. I like a bit a bite/spring to the noodle, but this was almost hard. Maybe it was just a bad batch?

The spicy wonton have no flavor, the noodle soups were so tasteless.
The Lanzhou noodle soup is nothing to compare with the noodleman, also the spicy wonton tasted like something else, I had it at Mr. chopsticks they had the best spicy wonton in town.  The celery and peanut salad is not bad, we all like it after all.  

Since the noodleman and mr. chopsticks has their own style, I would say this one is kind of in between but can't compare with those two.  I wish they will do well but I won't be back unless they improve their dishes.

First night husband and I ordered pork belly noodles (with plain noodles) and wonton noodles (with hand-pulled noodles). The pork belly noodles tasted great. Although the pork belly was not tendered enough, the soup and noodles were perfect. The wonton noodles would be a good choice for people preferring a milder taste. However, the wontons were too tiny. The table next to us ordered the beef pancakes and they looked so attractive. Too bad my husband does not eat beef so we didn't order it. They really should consider making a version using pork. 

The next day we ordered a chicken chow mein for take out. It was my favorite! It actually looked and tasted simliar to a very delicious yakisoba without the annoying taste of Worchestershire sauce. I loved it!!

The broth was really flavorful and the pork very tender. We also had the potstickers which were tasty and the presentation was beautiful.

Service: pretty standard imo. The 3 waiters I've seen work here are attentive and friendly. Water refills aren't an issue and they answered my questions with ease. Food comes super quick too, speaking of which....

Food: I can't give this more stars. I don't know what it is, but I haven't had noodles as good as these in a long time. I hope I'm not hyping it up too much, but I REALLY enjoyed both bowls. I've gotten both the pork belly noodle soup and the shang beef noodle soup. Both were hand pulled noodles. The broths are absolutely delicious. It's super rich with flavor but isn't overpowering, salty or heavy. The shang beef noodle soup broth is a tad on the spicy side, but it's very manageable (plus they have chili sauce on the side if you want). The toppings that come standard are 2-3 cuts of bok choy and a small heap of spring onions. There's options to add extra toppings ($2.50, which is whatever the meat is), bean sprouts, extra noodles, extra broth, etc. The pork belly meat was pretty tender, but I think I enjoyed the shang beef so much more. It feels like it was braised for a long time; even the cuts of beef that had some sinew/connective tissue is still tender enough to easily bite through.

Honestly, I love this place. For under $10 a noodle bowl, I find it hard to beat with that price point. I seriously wish this place would move to San Diego. Or at the very least, if I ever come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again.",pdliyyW-NdrZvJk9QQqeNA,0,0,5,VCfWT_Jfp6wi8xXey7nCtw

We've been here twice now and both our waitresses were very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We were told they had their soft opening about 2 weeks ago and they just had their grand opening on Thursday. My wife and I tried the Shang beef noodles. It was very good. The broth had a hint of sweetness to it. My wife likes their hand pulled noodles while I really like the knife cut noodles for a more al dente texture. They do make both types of noodles in house and if you're lucky, you can actually see someone hand pulling the noodles behind the clear plexiglass that divided the bar from the kitchen. They also have the plain noodles made by machines, but I don't know why anyone would want that instead of the freshly made noodles on site. I also had the Chicken and mushroom noodle which was also very good. We also tried their beef pancakes, pork and cabbage potstickers and the spicy wontons. The wontons had just a hint of heat to it and although they were all good, I think the homemade noodles is what makes this place different than others. The place itself is not very big but there weren't many people there so getting a seat was not difficult. I think the price is very reasonable considering the outrageous $$$ we've spent on the strip.

My friends and I came here on a Sunday at 3pm and there were only a couple of tables left, but they had obviously just been through a huge lunch rush as most of the tables still had to be cleaned. At first we asked for a table but thought better of it and decided to sit at the bar. Do this. Sit at the bar. It is totally worth it and the experience of watching the noodle transformation, the dumpling making, and just food preparation is probably a totally different experience than sitting with your companions at a table.

The restaurant is small -- no more than twenty tables and a wrap-around bar with about 20 seats. The staff here is super friendly and very, very helpful. They make no assumptions about how much you know about the menu and are incredibly enthusiastic to offer suggestions. For appetizers, we ordered the following: Spicy Wonton - house-made wonton with spicy soy sauce and Beef Pancakes. Totally agree with the other reviewers - the sauce for the spicy wontons is a bit on the sweet side, but otherwise they are very good. Don't expect huge lumpsof meat wrapped in a tiny wonton though, because they are cute, tiny wontons. I really loved the beef pancakes and thought they were a unique cross between a soup dumpling and gyoza. Delish!

For my main, of course I had to order soup! I tried the Shang Beef Noodle: beef broth, braised beef brisket, veggies + hand-pulled noodles. The  soup is HUGE. It is incredibly flavorful and the beef is tender and seasoned well. Everything in that bowl is delicious, made even more delicious by the hot young man constantly pulling noodles in front of us. I'm telling you, sit at the bar. Oh, and you get lots of noodles in the soup. Don't order extra noodles, that's just crazy.

I should have left when I walked into a Chinese restaurant without seeing any Chinese customers, don't get me wrong I LOVE American Chinese food: egg fu-yong, general Tsau's chicken etc. but when it comes to this kind of noodle you kinda want the real thing.

I give one start for the modern decoration and one for the waiter's service. If these are important to you, there you have it.

If you are about real good Chinese noodles, search for the next option. I regretted not having their knife cutting noodle, I ordered the hand pulled type, strangely they call it hand pulled because it doesn't taste like that at all. Even those you can get from supermarket taste more like hand pulled noodles than what I had today. I wonder if the knife cutting ones are better?

I ordered the signature Sheng noodle soup. When the noodle came it was not served with a spoon. The right way to eat a noodle soup( Chinese or Japanese alike) is to first taste the soup, the first sip is going to show how good (or not) is the soup base hence how good is the chef. After I asked for the spoon, the two tables next to mine also requested spoons, I see both tables were almost half or 3/4 into their noodles and they didn't know they should sip the soup? How well do you know your noodle?

Well, I feel I was perked too much by the reviews hence was overly disappointed. This is an ok restaurant, just not great like most described, and I will not return.",EuWsy43_q1Liahu-0FtfrQ,0,0,2,1aP1CX7YS3zz8fCwu6IoFA

Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly staff. It is not a very big establishment, where they have a small bar area and a few tables. If you can, get a seat at the bar so you have front row seats to them making fresh hand made noodles. We decided to get the Sháng Beef Noodle with hand pulled noodles, Chicken Chow Mein with Knife-shaved Noodle, and a side of beef and onion pot sticker. 

Our main dishes came out first, since it took a while for them to cook the pot stickers. The Sháng Beef was extremely tender and the broth was rich and flavor and was not overly salty, which is easy to do with these types of dishes. The noodles were made and cooked to perfection, being soft but also able to have a good bite to them. For the chow mein, it had fresh and crunchy vegetables and the noodles were cut thin enough that they were able to pick up the flavors of the chicken and vegetables. My only complaint was that the chow mein's chicken did not taste that fresh; but other wise, everything else was amazing. The pot stickers were also cooked perfectly; one side was crunchy, the other was soft, and the meat inside was flavorful and had a nice contrast to it from the crunch it got from the chopped onions.

It was amazing!  I don't usually go out of my way to eat gluten, but this one was worth the hit!  They make the noodles fresh... not from yesterday, but you're served noodles that are made right in front of your eyes (esp. if you sit at the bar which we did).  It was enough to share with my 4 year old.  The soup didn't taste like it was full of MSG. Bonus!

The potstickers came when we were finishing up the noodles.  It was a little backwards but I still loved how they tasted fresh.  They make the dumplings fresh there along with the skin.  It's amazing and unusual in presentation.  The skin's a little thicker than other places, because they roll the skin there.

The service itself was friendly and prompt for a relatively busy Fri night.  I LOVED the spa water.  Ours tasted like cucumber.  I think one Yelper complaining about the water couldn't tell that it's actually cucumber and not watermelon skin (yuck and who would do that?).  I wanted more water, but I was too full to drink any more water.

Both offerings were very delicious! The broth was not too oily and salty, and the fatty beef cuts typical in Northern Chinese Beef Noodle Soup were tender and braised for hours as they should be. I dislike when some restaurants fail to fully marinate and braise the beef cuts leaving them dry and tough- not a problem here as Shang Noodles gets the combination of chewy soft noodle and braised beef just perfect. The beef pancakes were perfectly pan fried in fresh oil and fillings were juicy and savory.  If you sit at the bar seating area, you can watch a master chef actually performing dough kneading gymnastics to turn out heaps of fresh noodles- the chef we watched making noodles was obviously experienced and knew what he was doing and was very interesting to observe.

Found this place on Instagram and could not pass up the chance to eat there while in Vegas.  It's off the strip but well worth the Uber ride there.  Place was pretty empty when we arrived (but we were eating at an off time so that probably helped) so were quick to be seated.

If I had to choose again what again I would go with the spicy won tons for an appetizer and would have a hard time choosing between the DanDan noodles (with the shaved noodle) or the beef soup.

Shang Beef Noodle is sooooo good. Piping hot broth with braised beef brisket and veggies. It sounds simple but it really hits the spot on a cold day. I also loved their Spicy Wonton. For me, the sauce has some sweetness to it then the spice kicks your taste buds at the end. I can't quite explain it. The potsticker presentation is a must see, besides the taste. It's so pretty because it's shaped like a flower of some sort. The beef pancake is also tasty. Watch out though!

1438124,2016-08-21,2,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Came here on a Saturday evening with some friends, a few days after their opening. 

Upon first glance, the kitchen reminded us of Noodle Man, on the southwest side of town, which offers similar type of food and hand made noodles. They specialize in fresh hand-pulled noodles and knife-cut noodles. It is near the popular Yonaka Japanese and newly opened Very Berry Cafe, this plaza is about to be really popular as these 3 places are really good... BUT PARKING SUCKSSS.... parking is very limited in this area as it goes down the hill into the gas station and McDonalds

Number of tables is limited but i believe the restaurant can seat 20-30 people fairly easily, with 2-4 person tables and counter tables facing the kitchen. 

3 of us had ordered the Shang Beef Noodle which consisted of beef broth, beef brisket, and veggies. 2 of the 3 with hand-pulled noodles and 1 (mine) being knife-cut noodles. 1 of us got the Pork Rib Noodle with hand-pulled noodles which is fairly similar but consists of pork broth, braised pork rib, and veggies. Both priced at $8.49. The smell of the braised pork ri

We were served watermelon infused water which was nice and refreshing. At first we saw the slightly murky water and questioned it until the waitress told us XD 

The orders came out fairly quick (we were the only table in the restaurant). 2 of the 3 hand-pulled noodles had a good al dente texture. 1 may have sat a little longer than the others. My hand-cut noodles were a little short of al dente in the middle but quite soft on the edges. Maybe a minute less would be perfect. 

Soup flavor was very nice and not overpowering. The spoons they give us to use sucks for eating with as it was a straight spoon so it was a bit awkward to hold and get soup. The beef brisket was super flavorful and tender ! Very good quality and delicious. 

When we were almost finished, they had brought us a cold celery peanut salad with shredded carrot. Quite flavorful. Flavor reminds me of the chinese marinating liquid ""loh sui"". Pretty tasty and the chilled app was nice. 

Overall pretty good place. Might actually prefer this place over Noodle Man now. :) Good to try if you are in the area",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,6,2,4,eEMIaP9uqxfgx_8bx4cmnA

Let's just start off with saying that the fresh noodles were actually great. We ordered 2 appetizers and 3 noodles. I would say that their pot stickers might be the worst I've ever had or close to it. The reason to it(although the picture looks AMAZING) is that there was no seasoning and for some reason, it was like the chef accidentally got the sugar instead of the salt. It was REALLY ODD as you bite into it, you get a very bland taste that ends with a sweetness to it. I understand that there are a lot of dishes that adds sugar to food but this was just odd. I would say that was prob the worst part of it all.

The meat bun was okay. I had one better but it wasn't too shabby. 
SO the 3 noodles, they all had their flaws and they all had their pros. Starting with the beef noodles, the beef was actually super good and the soup was super flavorful that I kept going back but what the problem was, was that the noodles didn't soak in the flavor of the soup. So it was like you're eating 3 things seperately. Noodles, soup, and beef. It's not say the beef noodles were bad or perhaps maybe I had to get the thick noodles for it to soak in the flavor of the soup but thatwas the issue. 

The  dan dan noodles was topped off with a lot of the meats which is not the problem. It's also quite different from the usual dan dan noodles. DO I prefer the original style over this one? Maybe just a little bit. The problem was actually the fact that they brought us this luke warm. I'm pretty sure I know the reason to it too. I'm sure all the meat toppings were made already so the freshly made noodles was cooked hot topped off with the cold meat toppings making it luke warm which is just terrible. So I would prob enjoy this dish so much more if it was hot...or if you had tell me it was cold noodles but it was warm...

The chicken chow mein. I actually like this dish the most. It was really flavorful and I said that I loved the noodles despite my complains. The real issue was the horrible chicken. It just tasted bad and frozen(but mainly bad). You know it never really happens where you don't eat the proteins but this was the case because it was just awful. The chow mein with the veggies were sooooo good but that chicken really made this dish worse than it is. I was thinking about how much I would love the beef from the beef noodles with this chow mein even though it's a weird mix up but regardless it's a 3 star. 

The service was better than you usual ones because there's a lot of American speakers which is good in a lot of way. So there's that.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,1,0,3,_dNd9vhkRjBPDeAdQO8Lxw

The beef noodle soup was tasy - it hit the spot after an early day start! The beef was tender, the broth was on point, and the noodles had thr perfect texture.

The potstickers were tasty but the sizes were smaller than usual. The plating is interesting as they crisp up the starchy water for a ""crust""... it's visually pretty, but we would rather get the potstickers faster than the quoted 15min.  It took longer than thr noodle dishes and IMO too long for an appetizer if it doesnt really add to the flavor/texture.

The chicken sesame cold noodle lacked flavor.  Usually, sesame is a flavorful sauce, but we wonder if it was missing a soy base. There were as much noodles as shredded cucumber and carrots, and the shredded chicken portion was so small.

THE SERVICE. The server was nice and knowledgeable and described each dish perfectly. There were no surprises for us when we got our food. And she did not lead us astray. They were also quick refilling our waters (it's the little things that count.) So onto what's even more important. THE FOOD. We ordered spicy wonton and I'm sensitive to spiciness but if you avoid the hot chili oil, it wasn't that bad. But if you like the spice than dipping and rolling it around in the hot oil would satisfy your taste buds. The wontons are smaller in size than what I'm used to and I ended up pouring a little soy sauce on them. The flavors were good and all, however, I probably wouldn't order that appetizer again. For our main course, we ordered Shang beef noodle soup with the thin hand pulled noodles (naturally, wanted to try what the noodle artist had been working so hard on making- but you have different options, the one we ordered is similar to spaghetti in shape/thickness but there's a flatter noodle choice as well.)

The beef is so so so tender; the broth is so flavorful; and the noodles have just the right bite. Pork Belly Noodle was also great; the broth is similar to the Shang Beef. The Beef Shank Noodle has a clear broth--because of that, it is not as flavorful as the other two; it is tasty in its own way.

1807515,2017-04-07,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Oh yeah, color me happy!  GF and I had late lunch there yesterday and it was sweet from start to finish. Bright, contemporary interior was very welcoming. Typical of most noodle shops, it's a smallish location with seating for maybe 20-25 diners, but if it's filled, there are always takeout options. Server took our drink orders right away and brought back our hot tea (the real stuff with roasted rice in it, in a tea bag steeped in a clear glass mug on a cork coaster--you get the idea, not your typical tiny tea cup with tea pot) and cucumber-infused iced water. I do appreciate a pretty presentation at a meal and they did it right on all items, with flavor to savor.

GF read reviews that recommended appetizers, so we ordered beef pancakes and pork and cabbage pot stickers. Our server cautioned us about biting into the beef pancakes (which actually look like a hockey-puck shaped dumpling, browned on both sides) which might squirt some cooking liquid and he brought a knife to cut into it to be safe. Well, the inner klutz surfaced and I actually dropped my dumpling into the dipping sauce and still managed to make a mess of my blouse. It was good for a laugh while we enjoyed the savory appetizers. 

There are three types of noodles to order with your dish and two are freshly made in-house: hand pulled or knife shaved. In fact, if you're facing the cooking station from the counter or east wall, you can watch the noodles being made--huge rope of pasta being swung and twisted. My pork belly soup with the hand-pulled noodles was hugely satisfying, umami-filled dark broth, with generous amounts of braised pork belly and baby bok choy. My friend's seafood soup had a clear broth and was anointed with good portions of shrimp, calamari rings, and fishcake. She wasn't able to finish her soup and took the rest to go--much too yummy to leave behind.

Overall pricing is good and competitive (our appetizers averaged $5 - $6 and soups were $8 to $10). I'm bringing hubby and friends here, and will try again for an off-peak time since both parking and seating are limited.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,2,0,5,9dMvz9FS45HrdILQ6VjPqA
1818186,2017-02-12,5,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Shang Artisan Noodles is one of the better places to get some seriously good Chinese noodle soup and dumplings.  Its a bit off the Strip, but well worth an Uber ride to get here.  We arrived at 10:45 am for the 11 am opening and a line was already forming.  Prices are about half the cost of Strip places like Bellagio Noodles and Caesar's Beijing Noodle 9, but food is twice as good.  Plus, you get authentic flavors and a free show in the open kitchen!

The beef pancakes are seared, little hockey-puck shaped dumplings filled with hot, seasoned and juicy ground meat. Our table loved these!  Eat with caution as scalding hot juices can hit your neighbor.

The spicy wontons are also good - mostly sweet and salty, with very smooth dumpling skin.  They have the Sichuan peppercorn flavors but the heat is manageable.

Pot Stickers were properly seared and crispy on the bottom, almost forming a flower-like presentation.  These were also popular with our group.

Finally the noodle bowls - each ranging from $9-$10 or so.  You get the option of hand pulled, knife cut, or regular noodles.  Not sure why anyone would choose regular - that's like asking for pre-packaged noodles.

The Shang Beef Noodle Soup is a safe choice with chewy noodles, super tender brisket, and still-crispy bok choy.  My mom felt my pork belly noodle soup was superior, since the braised pork belly had just enough richness from the fat and yet was so soft and tender.  My mom's pork rib noodle soup was okay - she felt the meat was on the drier side.

Overall, solid noodle place that's definitely worth an Uber ride.  Our server Ciara was excellent - super efficient and looking after the entire restaurant by herself.  Will definitely come here instead of Bellagio Noodles from now!",VHjR5F6mdnLrQcCb0nqCYg,8,8,5,I6UTLZEwkvrfnEPc7SX6Gg

There was a convenient restaurant located downstairs of our hotel and just the thought of paying $18 for beef noodle soup and $12 for two pieces of dim sum was hard to digest. So we ventured off the strip and found this new and highly rated spot! 

Solid 5 stars for organized and renovated interior, friendly service, cheap and affordable prices, and the most delicious beef noodle soup and spicy wontons! I'd always knew Chinese food on the west coast was much more superior compared to the DMV. But my goodness, their hand pulled noodles were so soft with the perfect texture. Our food arrived quickly because you can see them prepare each dish fresh as ordered. The beef to the Shang's beef noodle soup was so tender and the fatty parts just melted in my mouth. I'm afraid to say I prefer their beef over my dad's! The soup was flavorful and an addition of bok choy and extra noodles was only $1 each! That's quality and quantity! 

The skin to the spicy wonton appetizer was silky and soft and the spicy sauce was different than anything I've had with this particular dish. It was spicy but not overpowering and very flavorful too. 

We also ordered the pork and cabbage potstickers and the filling with flavorful with the unique addition of soup inside! So be careful as you bite into it or else the soup will shoot out the other end! You have to eat it dandy with little bites at a time. I got into it after the first piece and watching my hubby take big bites and losing all that good broth. 

Oh how I wish there was such an affordable and quality place back home at the DMV. I'm sad that I discovered this place on my last day in Vegas or else I would have been coming here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.",3JJGEQ6nV3edLA9Aso2mNA,7,5,5,td-cPcACooEH7Q24aSaa1g

Shang Beef Noodle - 5/5. No real complaint here at all. The meat was the most tender I've had at one of these types of places (which, granted, is a low bar cause it's usually overcooked). Noodles were springy and cut well just like good hand pulled noodles should be, veggies were just the right amount of cooked, and the soup had a deep meaty flavor without being oversalted, which is indicative of them not taking shortcuts with making the soup like other places. I was actually able to drink the entire bowl and not have a sore throat after. 

Cucumber Salad - 4/5. The presentation was nice, and once you mixed the peanut sauce with the cucumber, the dish had a nice light flavor.

Spicy Wonton - 4/5. I haven't seen this in the states that often, but this was well done. The sauce hit the right sweet/sour/spicy spots without being too overbearing. My one complaint is that the amount of filling was low compared to the wrapper, so the ratio felt off when you bit into it: would have liked to see it stuffed a bit more.",6aHxJNYRVMN1-lFoRMqVFg,1,0,5,W76nM7nrtH88jr_iyNPOAw

It is tasty, clean, bright, open, and engaging.  I've been to many restaurants in China and this brings the best of the region into one menu.  The food is fresh and flavorful.  The noodles are everything one would hope for--especially the Knife Cut noodles.  Most everyone eating there had a connection to China--they all loved this place and were talking about it.  Even though several of the cooks were Mexican, they were well trained and fully committed to providing an authentic bowl of noodles--and really nice guys.  The cooks of Chinese decent ""owned"" it--you could tell they loved their work and had developed their skills over many many years.  The tea was great and had a unique twist.  I'm always looking at the details--the water was gently infused with lemon and cucumbers-delish!  And finally, the most important component of all--the broth--perfect!  Not too salty, not too strong, full flavor.  I wanted to jump in and swim around a bit, but that wouldn't hav'been appropriate although justified.",jaOnZpDgTy44FXQir0qUyQ,0,0,5,yhL3S3p9tr6wQV6w1m_Ewg

I got the pork belly noodle soup this time. The pork belly's broth is more flavorful than the shang beef which is more subtle but I still prefer the shang beef. The meat on the pork belly wasn't as tender the further away from the fatty part it is. But it was still good.

1899245,2017-06-19,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I really do not want to write this review...I was expecting to write another glowing review of this establishment. I was so disappointed with the entire experience tonight. I went expecting the same type of experience and great food that I had last time and it came nowhere near that. 

1) the A/C was not really working or they had it up really high.... Not sure what was going on but it was really warm...I mean like in the mid 80's. They did have a fan going BUT it was just blowing the hot air around. So I was just looking forward to getting my food and getting out ASAP.

2) My bf and I went in a little before 9pm.... Was greeted right away and sat right away. Started off good right?? I ordered the beef and onion potstickers after seeing the pictures and reading some of the other reviews. And of course the spicy wontons. I was warned that it would take 10-15 minutes which is why I ordered those first before ordering my noodles. And true to the warning it took that long.... My bf and I ate the apps.... And if you look at my pictures... My beef and onion potstickers look nothing like the other pictures... Mine came out kind of burnt in some areas and the Lacey look that is supposed to be on these potstickers were nowhere to be found. The flavor was ok... Kind of bland and it tasted a little off? like the mix in them were on their last legs. :( (1/5) I was thinking oh well... At least the spicy wontons won't disappoint me...as soon as I took my first bite...I wanted to cry... They did NOT taste the same as last time. Same as the filling in the potstickers... It tasted like the meat mixture was also on is last legs as well.... And the sauce was a watered down version of what I had last time. Such a disappointment!!! (2/5)

3) I was hoping that the noodles that I ordered would make up for the disappointment with the apps. Nope... It only took my bf and I about 10 minutes to eat the apps. Then the wait started. My noodle dish came out finally at 9:40pm... That was almost a 20 minute wait. 3 tables that were sat after me got their apps and entrees all before my Noodle dish. I was like WTH???  And the broth of my braised pork dish was delicious!!! And that's where anything good about the dish ended. The braised pork which should just melt in your mouth was tough and chewy... The fat was not rendered all the way and the meat was just tough. Boo!! They are known for their noodles and the knife cut was hugely disappointing. It did not have a great chew that you would expect. It was like they almost undercooked the noodles. The noodles were very gummy and almost just disintegrated in my mouth. It was not a great feeling. I kept on eating the noodles trying to figure out what was wrong with them. 

Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. If this had been my first visit I would've probably given them 2 stars but I'm going to give them another try in the future to see if I just got them on an off night.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,10,4,3,FUo7ZERPIT8HT2WbidbvEA

The beef shank noodle tasted too salty. No, that's not the way to cook it.  On the other hand, the chow mein is lacking taste. The sesame cold noodle had too much vegetable, ratio between noodle and veggie is not right and the peanut sauce is completely lacking. I tried to add some more and it saves the taste a little bit but I still had to force myself eating it. 

 The beef pancake is actually really good. However, overall from the perspective of an LA Cantonese who is experienced eating good noodle dumpling dishes like this, sorry to say, these were off the mark.",pbC7QnUQCzJB89dZK8HCeg,1,2,2,VNZjwa8CRf2oiv1nyX7QhQ

1935641,2017-01-11,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"My wife and I visited this place after we saw an ad on this restaurant. The reviews on Yelp convinced us that we should try.

This is a very small eatery and can accommodate about 19 people at one setting. 
It is located in a small strip mall. The interior decoration is pretty modern and has an large open kitchen. The appliances in the kitchen are all well provided and taken care of. 

The menu is a small menu but large enough to offer a variety of dishes. 
Specifically, this restaurant tends to cater to the younger generations and possibly to the non-asian group. Henceforth, spicy hot dishes are not really that hot. 

We ordered four dishes:

1. Cucumber salad - strips of cold, crisp cucumbers mixed with a hot, spicy sesame sauce. The sauce is tasty and the cucumbers are fresh. Unfortunately, the cucumber too can have a bit of a flavor. If you like plainer food, this is ideal. For me, it is a bit too plain. Nonetheless, it is a B+.

2. Beef Pancakes - minced beef in a piping hot Bao. Very juicy and tasty. Though one has to be careful to eat them as the juice can be too hot to the tongue. Love this dish and it is definitively an A.

3. Pork dumpling -  presentation is nice but a major disappointment in taste. Can use some extra flavoring. The worst dish of the day. A solid C. 

4. Shang Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodle - my wife likes the noodle although I feel it is a bit on the tough side. The beef ( and tendons ) are well cooked, very flavorful and the meat is tender. But the soup is a bit diluted, a bit more concentrated will be better. Still worth a solid B+.

Service is good. Pricing is reasonable. Food improvement is possible, whether it is necessary or not depends on customers' taste.

We also got the beef pancake, beef and onion pot sticker, and beef and onion boiled dumplings. The pot stickers were joined together by a crispy thin batter and looked beautiful! Everyone liked all the appetizers a lot. 

For my entree I tried the 'Tomato & Egg Noodle'. As a child I grew up having traditional tomato and egg... but it was always over rice. This was my first time having it over noodles. Don't get me wrong, I loved the creativity... but I would have preferred a more traditional Asian noodle dish. As a vegetarian, this was the only entree option on the menu. 

My husband got the signature 'Shang Beef Noodle' and thought it was good, could really taste the beef in the broth and had a very meaty flavor. 

The set up was super cool where you can look in and see the noodle guy making fresh noodles. I loved the decor and feeling of a modern noodle house.

We tried the pork and cabbage dumplings, the spicy wontons and a generous sized bowl of their signature beef noodle soup. The pork and cabbage dumplings were somewhat bland, though perfectly rolled and much better with the included sauces. The spicy wontons were pillow-like, tender and delicious, though a bit spicy to be sure. 

My favorite, however, was by far the shang beef noodle bowl. I went for the knife shaved and boy was I happy. For starters, the incredible wooden soup spoons and quality chop sticks really make you enjoy your meal in superb fashion. The broth is super rich and meaty with just a hint of spice and tender chunks of delicious beef. The noodles are so unbelievably soft yet still with a good amount of substance. The green onion and bok choy serve to add some nice texture and additional flavor contrast.

I love the Noodle Man so I was so excited to try out this place since it has a similar concept. The place is new so very clean and modern looking. They have a bunch of smaller tables, probably not the best place for large parties, especially if they get busy it will be difficult to pull tables together. The waitress was very sweet and made good recommendations. 

For appetizers we ordred spicy wontons and beef and onions pot stickers, both came after we got our noodles (not much of an appetizer if it comes after the meal), but this wasn't a big deal to us. The spicy wonton looked really small but there were about 8 wontons in there, so pretty good portion; however, being called ""spicy"" wonton it was not spicy at all, there is a sweetness to the sauce that I did not expect, I would have liked for it to be spicer. The pot sticker came after we finished our noodles, the waitress said they were experimenting with a new pot and it messed up the pot stickers so they had to re-make it, they gave us a plate of the cucumber salad complimentary for the wait, which was very sweet of them. The skin on the pot sticker was too thick for my liking, the meat was kind of bland and dry, nothing special really. The sauce was really good though. 

I got the pork belly with knife-shaved noodles. The broth as really good, very flavorful, but they gave me very little broth. The noodle was very thick and stuck together, it was hard to pick up each noodle, it stuck together like a big...glob. My sister got the Shang's noodle with hand pulled noodles, her broth was good but a bit warm, not as hot as she would have liked.

After the first sip of the pork rib noodle soup we knew this place is nothing close to authentic. It taste just like the soup base concentrate which you can find in a random Japanese supermarket. Overly sweet but no flavor of the ingredients. The hand-made noodles, which is supposed to be selling point of the restaurant, is overcooked and soft. Also ordered the beef noodle, spicy wonton and beef potsticker. Nothing special about the beef noddle soup. The wonton again is overly sweet but not spicy nor sour as it should be. Beef potstickers was the best out of the four items we tried, but nothing extraordinary about it. I'm not a water person but I have had two big glasses of water by the end of the meal. Not sure if it is the over sweetness or msg. Guess I had my hope too high up with all the great reviews. Didn't regret giving the place a try but don't think I am coming back.

My guy and I shared the spicy won ton appetizer and two noodle dishes for lunch- the Shang beef noodle soup with hand-cut noodles and the chicken and mushroom noodle with knife-cut. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the knife-cut noodle more, it reminded me of a thicker pappardelle. Both bowls were generous portions, and the soup broth was fairly good. I do wish the chicken and mushroom bowl had a few more mushrooms to balance out the amount of noodle received. 

The concept, layout, and menu are very similar to Noodle Man but with a more convenient central location. Didn't notice any desserts, but they are right next door to Very Berry Cafe if you want to continue the Asian theme to complete your meal.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,14,4,Q3QG7FW3TsIbA1wckeBn6Q

The star of their menu is their hand-pulled noodles for which they have a full time person making at any given time. It's surprisingly mesmerizing watching the chef pull the noodles. Almost like a circus act. With the noodle dishes, you actually get a choice of three types of noodles, but if this is your first visit, I definitely recommend getting the hand-pulled noodles with whatever you are getting. They are chewy, thick and quite delicious. It tastes very high quality. Our group had a variety of dishes and all of them were exceptional. And the best part is that the price point makes this food an incredible value! Most dishes were under $9! Hard to go wrong here. 
Like any other new place, there are some kinks that still need to be ironed out, and I do wish the service was a bit friendlier, but overall, this is a place that I want to frequent quite often.

Spicy wontons had good skin.  A bit more meat would be nice but the sauce was balanced

Knife shaved dan dan noodles were very tasty as well.  Everything was made fresh as you get to see them do it from the counter.  The knife shaved wasn't as springy as I normally like and they were unevenly slightly card which means they were cooked unevenly depending on which noodle you got.  The dan dan style here is the dry kind not the soup style but every place has their own style of dan dan and this was pretty good.  It's supposed to be spicy but it really wasn't excessively spicy which I like

The hand drawn noodles were cooked better and had a good springiness in the pork rib broth.  The noodles were cooked evenly but the broth was a bit salty.

Better than most of the noodles places as compared to the Bay Area.  Would definitely come back as it was tasty and fair priced

The beef pancake was honestly not good. There was no flavor at all in the beef or juice. We sadly didn't even finish it.

The Zha-Jiang noodles were not memorable and I'd try something else before I order this again. 

We also got the beef pancakes which were really good. They are piping hot when you get them, so be very careful you don't burn your tongue. The best way to eat them is either to cut them in half, or wait so that you can slurp up the soup inside the pancake.

I like having mushrooms in the noodles mean because it more closely resembles a meaty texture, so I don't get bored eating it. They refuse to customize the noodles, so I had no choice but to leave. I don't understand when they have all the ingredients necessary why it would be an issue to make a stir fry noodle dish with those two items. I am not getting meat and told them they could charge me for a dish with meat even tho dishes with meat are more expensiv, instead they told me know so I had no choice but to eat elsewhere.

It was so fresh that I feel like the noodle was too bland. Kind of like ""doughy"". The noodle did not absorb the flavor in the dish as much I thought it would which was disappointing. 

So we ordered the Dan Dan noodle which was minced pork with green onion and spicy soy sauce. That itself was on point. Super delicious especially if u add more green onion and the chili paste provided at the table. (If u like spicy)
We also ordered the Shang fried rice which the waiter recommended as most popular and most definitely, that dish was super good. The taste was super favorable that we finished the whole plate! Lol we also ordered one of the appetizers, which was the beef and onion boiled dumplings. It was okay. The dough by far was fresh but a little too hard than expected than the usual soft dumpling you're used to. 

With that said, the place was clean. Service was fast and friendly. Small but accommodating with the typical noodle bar which we sat because we enjoy watching the cooks cook and noodle dough being made.

What was also awesome was that you could choose 3 types of noodle for your dish which I haven't experienced at any other noodle place like this! You can choose between hand pulled, knife shaved and another option I can't think of. I recommend the knife shaved one even though I didn't try it myself! Lol it looked really good on everyone else's orders. We unfortunately picked the hand pulled noodle which I feel might've been too thick which is why the flavor did not absorb well.

We were looking for a dumpling place around us and not sure why but this popped up on the yelp (of course I used yelp) search. I started reading the reviews and became a bit more curious. And so began my experience....

It is a small restaurant, seats maybe 40 people but they were packed. Which I had read on yelp as a warning. We only waited 20 min so not bad and we were sat at the bar. Great spot too because we could see all the action. It was actually fun watching them make the noodles. Really cool.

As for food..
Cucumber salad - didnt love the sauce they poured all over it. It was a thick sesame cream sauce, maybe Asl for it on the side. 
Spicy wontons - same as other places but there quite a few in there which was a bit of a surprise
Beef pancakes- had a bit of soup in them, tastes a lot like dumplings but with a fried outer layer 

I tried the seafood noodle soup. No real complaints. It was light and clean (no oily or fatty taste). My son had the beef shank noodle soup which was really good. Broth was full of flavor, but you could see just how much oil was in the soup. 

Biggest take away, home made noodles are really tasty. They offer homemade, knife(knife used to cut noodles) and plain (machine made). 

Service was great. There were only 2 servers but they were on top of everything. Greeting, seating, taking orders and delivering food. They worked as a team and it was great!",fVILhIglx6RNOXQba5t4kQ,7,7,4,t1ly_moaqlX7cK2GaL0zjA

I have had this place on my radar for some time just never gotten around too trying it. Thankfully my cousins come too Vegas couple times year on the same page comes too food and enjoy checking out new places in Vegas. Shout out Lori I, Tracy H. Hanwook H, Mike M, and Carol M. 

The whole concept of fresh noodles in ramen or any noodle dish. Hell yay! I was excited about checking out Shang Artisan Noodles. I was not disappointed. The freshness of the noodles can tell not only from the obvious watching the guys in the kitchen (open kitchen) prep them, just looking at them look mouth watering, and once dig in so so SO good. It was our first time. So did our Yelp duties order ton of food for two. We started with the beef pancake and spicy wonton. The beef pancake was pretty solid. I really enjoy the meat filling inside had great flavor and seasoning, The dipping sauce was the perfect compliment to the dish. The spicy wonton. I just thought was ok. It lacked any kind of distinct flavor in my mind. Not even spicy. I would not order it again put it that way.

Our entrees my cousin and I made sure tried both kinds of noodles. I got the hand pulled noodles with my Shang Beef Noodle, my cousin got the knife cut noodle with the Chicken and Mushroom Noodle, and then we shared Shang Fried Rice. I love all three dishes!! I know this will be weird but the Shang Fried Rice stood out the most. It was really filling fried rice. It was hardy with lots of vegetables and bunch of stuff. The seasoning on it was very very tasty and could taste it. The worst is having fried rice bland or nothing in it then just rice. The Shang Fried Rice and am sure any of the other Fried Rices. Winnah! The noodles were just as strong between the knife cut and hand pulled. NO way could go wrong with either one. The Shang Beef Noodle had nice portion of cubes of short rib (maybe not sure) that moist and melted in your mouth. The broth was delicious. The bok choy was cooked perfect. The perfect bowl of hearty, hot, and tasty noodle soup warm ones soul. The same can be said of the Chicken and Mushroom. My cousin let me try some. It not as brothy but the sauce was amazing with the chicken and mushrooms. Bok choy. 

The service was five star. The guy was very attentive, friendly, and gave us great recommendations since we were first timers. The interior really like it. It well lit. Open kitchen with bar area so if want watch the guys working them fresh noodles and some entertainment. The spot. It feel modern. The menu is nice simple straight forward. If need more incentive try Shang Artisan Noodles right next door have Very Berry Cafe.

Decor: An elegant simple and clean. Theme is modern, sleek and bright. I love the wood chopsticks and spoon provided. The water is infused with lemons or cucumbers. The place is not big but kept well. You can see how your noodle is being made from scratch which is the whole attraction itself. You can tell the cook keep clean and organized at all time. 

Menu/ingredients: the menu is simple and easy to follow. You can pick and choose what you want off the menu by asking them. Everything is made in house. They have two kind of noodles: hand pulled and knife shaved. My favorite is hand pulled since it's on the softer side. The knife shaved is on the chewy side. Brooth is superb and tasty! 

Service: they have good service. Sometimes they have a waiting line but usually it's fast. 

Recommendation: would love to see more seats and comfortable seatings since sometimes they are busy and cannot accomodate large parties. Specials of the day would also be a good thing to add to their menu.

Fresh Knife Shaved Noodles! Shang Artisan Noodles gets a lot of video love for their Hand Pulled Noodles, and rightfully so...it's fun to watch, but Knife Shaved Noodles is actually where it's at for toothsum noodles that offer great taste and wonderful texture as you bite in. 

My love and I met a couple friends here and certainly enjoyed what Shang's was offering. We tried the Chicken and Mushroom Noodles, Shang's Beef Noodle Soup, Peking Zha-jiang Noodles, Beef Pancake, and Spicy Wontons. 

My favorite was the Chicken and Mushroom Noodles. I love the deep earthly flavors and the sauce is a perfect portion for noodle absorption. 

I also greatly enjoyed the Beef Pancake...though, as others have noted, it is much more of a round pan fried dumpling or potsticker on steroids than an Asian Pancake. Not all Beef Pancakes are created equal. Shang's are as juicy as they come. In fact, as you wrap your lips around these beefy pancakes and ever-so seductively bite in, you may, without trying, squirt flavorful juice across the table...perhaps in your neighbors food, on their clothes, or in their eye. ...anyway, all that to say; eat carefully. After all, with great power comes great responsibility. 

Shang's Beef Noodle Soup is a popular item. I am probably not the best one to hear from. This is not a dish that I typically like very much at other places...and while Shang's is better then average, it was not my favorite dish of the evening.

I am somewhat of a connoisseur of spicy wontons however, and I was saddened to bite into Shang's. They are not that spicy and do not carry the same flavors that the best versions of this appetizer often do in other Vegas establishments.

In the end, Shang Artisan Noodle is one of the best spots in town for fresh noodles. I am ready to come back and try some of their other dishes.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,20,16,4,y5z-9waGb2CpHzOOevEFJg

Came here with 2 Chinese friends (1 lived in China for 10 years and 1 from San Francisco) and they didn't think it was ""amazing"" either. Not the best noodles in town for sure, even if they are hand-made. Cool concept though but nothing new. 

I specifically ordered the Dan Dan Noodles because I LOVE Dan Dan Noodles. However, this dish left so much to be desired. (Shhhh .... Yunnan Tasty Garden on Spring Mountain has the best Dan Dan Noodles that I've had in LV. Trust. Their sauce is ah-mazing!)

The Wonton Noodle Soup was probably the best thing we ordered but not so great that I want to come back for it. 

We also ordered the cucumber salad and it was drenched in a thick peanut sauce, I think. Yuck, I didn't like it at all. 

I was really excited to try this place based on reviews but I won't be coming back. The place is super cute though and you can see them beating and twisting the noodle in front of you but I'm not here to watch a show.

But I think we were just lucky because as soon as we were seated, a bunch of other parties started lining up! Talk about perfect timing!

We ordered the Shang Beef, Dandan, and Seafood Noodles and a side order of the Beef Pancake. The pancake took a little too long to arrive, though. We were already more than halfway through our noodles when they served it. But it's okay.

So on to the good stuff. First, the servers are very nice, attentive, and polite. It just made the whole dining experience a lot better for a casual restaurant. Second, the food is actually pretty good. The Dandan is the clear winner for me. It's spicy and the flavors are right. A bite took me back to years ago when I was living in Singapore. That's how authentic the taste is. This doesn't, however, mean that the other two noodles aren't any good. Because they are. The Shang Beef Noodles are seasoned right and the Beef pieces are served in generous portions and are light and soft. The broth in the Seafood Noodles is also really good.

Now for the not so good bits. I mentioned earlier that the Beef Pancake took extra long to be served. And they really tell you that when you order that it takes 10 minutes. But that's not really the case. Anyway, I don't mind the wait. It's just that the noodles are a bit too heavy to eat that by the time the Beef Pancake were served, we were only able to eat one. And that's just to taste it and not enjoy it. If we could have been told that it really takes almost 20minutes to prepare, then we would have asked to just get that to us first before the Noodle Dishes. Anyway, the Beef Pancake is okay. Nothing special except for the juicy soup that goes out of it. Similar to a Xiao Long Bao. 

Overall, the experience was great and we will definitely be back again!",N9d9kk5GZHk1rlO4FpG9NA,2,0,4,l4ELF9nqcbuuVcbwVOu6Ig

The noodle bowls come out pretty fast.  Next time, I gotta try their dan dan noodles.  Enjoy!",pY8HETTYFEgQZUTTdGBwhA,0,0,4,pvdZ5sOa2HKNKYBM2tAkvQ

Tried both hand pull and knife cut noodle and I preferred hand pulled one. It was chewy and fresh and made right in front of you!

Beef pancake: good! Piping hot and juicy.

Spicy wonton: good. Silky and soft skin. Not really spicy though. 

Beef noodle: cake with lots of veggies and beef. loved the soup. But my knife cut noodle was overcooked that it turned kinda soggy. 

Dan dan noodle: not the traditional kind. But the hand pulled noodle was cooked perfectly",IxppblmNJu3RHOqxUihytw,3,2,5,zZnR0JP9jS9jgZXW7qo3Xw

My friends and I got the Shang Beef Noodle, along with the Spicy Wonton and we LOVED both dishes. 

The Spicy Wontons were a bit oily, but so worth it!! I decided a long time ago that good food over health (which is probably why my doctor always yells at me but oh well). My friend thought that they were a bit too spicy but honestly he thinks that everything is spicy so I wouldn't trust his opinion. They were perfectly delicious, and perfectly spicy. Highly recommend!

The flavors in the soup were delicious - I think something I'm always very concerned about when I get beef broth soups is whether or not the flavors are concentrated enough and if the meat is tender. At this spot, the meat is so soft and tender and the beef broth is just the right flavor. The soup was not too salty and not too bland, and such a delight to drink on a cold winter day.

The noodles were especially wonderful. They were so chewy and light, and they paired perfectly with the light broth. 

All in all, I would whole-heartedly recommend coming to this place and trying it out. The prices are great, the customer service is spectacular, and the food is INCREDIBLE",sfue39g0U-Gt1lk-PXKYIw,1,1,5,seK-1NU-h0mMABKIgr9Img

what i liked most about this place is their spicy wonton appetizer and their noodle bowls. the sauce on the spicy wonton appetizer was so delicious that my little sister and i took it home so we can eat it with our rice later. the juicy pork center had just the right amount of seasoning and had the right amount of heat with the sauce. my sister and i got the dry noodle bowls and they were so flippin' delicious! you have a choice of the hand pulled noodles or the fresh shaved noodles. my little sister got the hand pulled noodles and they tasted like freshly made udon noodles and i got the fresh shaved noodles that had a little chewy consistency. 

the toppings in our noodles were so fresh and bursting with flavor. we loved it so much that we decided to save half of our meals to take home to eat again later- not the best idea because the noodles were a little soft when we ate it BUT each bowl is enough to keep 2 people satisfied until the next dessert or meal.

2769661,2018-05-16,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Luckily it was inexpensive. I am truly amazed at all the raving reviews because besides the fact that they make amazing noodles right in front of you it seems they don't know what to do with them after! The beef pancake that is so highly recommended by nearly every review needs flavor. ANY kind of flavor! It's just hot and oily and without the little pitcher of potsticker sauce to let it soak in it's just something to chew on. The pork potstickers came 6 on a plate and 5.5 were still on the plate when we left. They tasted like the peanut oil they were fried in and ONLY oil! The chicken chow mein was barely flavored and the chicken looked as if it was purchased already sliced and cooked. We had one bite of it and pushed it to the side. Finally the beef noodle soup left a lot to be desired. The knife shaved noodles were thick and chewy which was awesome, but the beef was so fatty and gristly it was spat into a balled up napkin and left on the counter for the busser to dispose of. The flavor of the soup was so confusing, almost as if it was a mix of a few different leftovers and thrown together with whole unsliced bok choy. My favorite part of the meal was the sprite in a bottle and the delicious complimentary water. We were expecting a crowded restaurant, but there were no more than 6 other patrons in there the whole time. When we finished the server asked if we wanted to take it home and when we said no he seemed as if he already knew. I assume it's an acquired taste, but I have eaten a LOT of noodles in a lot of parts of the world and I can't think of a time when I was more disappointed. Being an executive chef myself I would think to say it was an off night in the kitchen, but you could clearly see that this food was the norm. 1 Star for the attentive and smiling servers, 1 Star for the delicious water.",FPK-gdwH6H0pwjfVuGHI_g,0,0,2,hTxwy7TneORDd-ffUXdRFg

Recommend hand shaved noodles with beef. 

Potstickers are good but not outstanding. 

Constructive criticism:
- Allocation of labor seems disproportionate. The guy who pulls noodles and the petite waitress seem to be doing all the work!  As a result service is slow and when the waitress went on break, no one took our bill and I had to ask the kitchen staff about it.
- Please put in more stools and tables. Additional 2 2-person tables and 3 stools can easily fit. 
- Some pieces of beef were too much tendon and were too big. Need to be trimmed more and cut into smaller more uniform pieces.
- The wooden spoons are very chic and hipster, but they are too shallow for scooping up broth!  Please get bigger spoons :)",oGuOxiy9_3J-QZpwth3Brg,1,2,4,_UcrSA8KcSofweqGxglddQ

i would suggest them to add shape and pics of their noodles, the first time there i had no clue and couldn't picture the noodle i wanted...
knife cut, is flat and large as your little finger lol
hand pulled is the size of regular chow mein
both shape are yummy yummy
variety of braised beef, chunk beef, chicken, pork
for Mushroom lovers try the wet noodle mushrooms it's to die for.
appetizers runs about $5/$6, cucumber salad (i wasn't impressed, the dressing was like a paste of something. i would rather get some vinegar and oil)
dumplings are fresh and very tasty, prepared by that ""elderly"" man, i enjoy watching him preparing the dumplings or noodles 
so time i feel like a stalker but he prepare the  dumplings and noodles with such grace that i can spend hours watching him if i could.

i usually order their organic iced tea. the other day i just ordered some water and was very surprised that the water was infused with some cucumber, it leaves a very pleasant taste :)
all their drinks are bottled 
service is fast even during rush hours.

2851848,2017-01-23,7,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Located adjacent to Yonaka, this little strip mall is shaping up to be quite a devastating one-two Asian foodie combo sandwiched between the frenetic Vegas Strip and the daunting gauntlet of Spring Mountain for the uninitiated tourist.  

Like its Japanese counterpart (Yonaka), Shang possesses a clean minimalist interior with a modern reboot in terms of taste and presentation of classically inspired dishes, although the latter bears a more staunch adherence to old school principles and tradition.

As a prelude to the meal, I highly recommend requesting a seat at the bar, where one is treated to watching the staff stretch and pull noodles, as well as witness the art of knife-shaved noodles deftly flicked into a boiling cauldron of water.  On the day I frequented the restaurant, I had the added enjoyment of watching a young apprentice in action under the steel-eyed gaze of the master (much like Pai Mei's cruel tutelage of Beatrix Kiddo in Kill Bill) and while the finished product turned out great, it gave me a greater appreciation of the difference in experience since the young grasshopper was covered nearly head to toe with patches of flour on his black toque/jacket after repeatedly flinging the dough across his body like LeBron James throwing chalk into the air (he'll get there someday).

For starters, the spicy wonton noodles have great flavor soaked up by the chili oil, but I would have preferred a slightly more generous filling and maybe cooking them a tad less so the skin was a tad more al dente.  The beef pancakes are beautifully plated and appear more like Danish pancakes with little pan-fried cylinders of dough encasing ground beef/chives with a scorching pocket of concentrated broth.  Much like a soup dumpling, handle this one with care since one could seriously injure oneself or those around them upon opening its contents.  

The main event is obviously the noodles, and one has the choice of selecting three types of noodles (hand pulled, knife-shaved, and plain) and choice of various noodle soups and sauced noodles.  Our party of four sampled 2 soup noodles (pork belly, pork rib) and and 2 sauce noodles (dan dan noodles, cold sesame noodles).  Overall the noodles have good chew and absorb/adhere flavors from the broth/sauce fairly well although my one complaint is that the predominant flavor that stands out is salty.  A good Asian broth/sauce carries undertones of spice, acidity, and an occasional afternote of sweetness or umami and I just felt like the salt factor overpowered and distracted especially in the sauced dishes whereas the broths did not extract as much spice/bony richness that I know exist in finer renditions.    The julienned vegetables in the cold sesame noodles could also utilize a finer cut and as another yelper suggested, perhaps an extra helping of noodles tempers the imbalance, but that's cheating unless you have the extra stomach space.  

All in all, a solid spot for some tasty hand pulled goodness, but at this point cannot place them among the pantheon of world class noodle joints.",syA7uYoDjohc7gWBWaEZmw,8,8,4,yLypN5BvKe63s2npm33xXg

I wish we had one of these around here so I wouldn't have to go to Vegas for it! I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas! Also, shoutout to Lindsey for the awesome service!",L2DfhFlI6T5ukiMJEbpW0w,1,1,5,fqIFIWhJGD3dZ1iM8Oxouw

The soup base for beef noodle soup (Shang beef noodles) was not quiet what I'm used to in Taiwan. The pork rib noodle soup was a little salty and the ribs were a bit hard. The knife cut noodles were nice and chewy but the hand pulled noodles were not as chewy as I would like. The cucumber salad was really so-so with not much flavor. The beef buns were decent.

2902589,2017-01-26,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"It was pretty busy in here when my boyfriend and I came here some nights ago. We were seated right away and then it got even busier. A huge group came in and after that, even more people. The restaurant isn't very big with a small amount of tables and also a bar-like seating area that faces the huge open kitchen. Pretty cool that you can watch them in the kitchen, especially when they pull and twirl the noodles! But I do wish they had a taller glass because there were a ton of kids looking OVER the glass and standing on the bar chairs, talking and spitting all over our food because I've never met a child that doesn't spit when they talk and shout...

After, they figured out the seating and such for the big group our order was finally taken. The cooks were just standing in the kitchen waiting to do something so once our orders were put in they started on it right away and we watched our noodles being hand-pulled. How awesome!!! 

I ordered the Chicken and Mushrooms hand-pulled noodle stir-fry and my boyfriend ordered the seafood noodle soup. We also ordered the beef and onion Potstickers and the sliced beef shank. 

The pot stickers had a crispy crust attached to them which I've never seen before so I thought that made them a little more special than other Potstickers elsewhere and the added crunch was just wonderful. The sliced beef shank was drizzled in a balsamic vinegar glaze and we just hated it. The meat tasted like it had been in the fridge for 2-3 days and they JUST pulled it out and gave it to us when we ordered it. Is this dish supposed to be ice cold?!?! I'm not sure. I think it is but it was my first time trying it... and never will I again. I literally could only take one bite. Not only was it ice cold but the balsamic drizzle was so bad... it tasted like balsamic flavored nail polish remover.

My chicken and mushrooms noodle stir fry was quite delicious! I loved it. The noodles were so so SOOOO good! They tasted so fresh and perfectly soft and chewy. My boyfriend and I both thought that the seafood noodle soup's broth was rather bland... but after posting this statement about the soup on my Instagram they commented and informed me that that particular soup is supposed have a ""light"" broth and that I should try the beef next time... but IMO, just because it's a light broth doesn't mean it should be a no flavor broth :/",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,1,0,3,w3tt-c2S0KLxJRRgNwnVzw

While working in LV, a couple of us decided to try Shang's based on the yelp reviews.  We hit them right at the lunch rush and were seated at the bar. There were no tables as the smallish seating area was completely full.  The waitress got us menus and then went back to working the tables.  She was very busy and simply didn't get back to us.... When the party of three that came in the same time we did (and got the last table) was served their food, I messaged the restaurant and was informed that one of their staff was late; we watched our new waiter roll in about that time and the original waitress came back and took our order (IMMEDIATE response to my message).  The best thing about this was watching the kitchen staff making noodles and preparing the food; pretty interesting process.

I ordered pork potstickers and the seafood noodles.  My friend ordered the pork back bacon noodles.  Our noodles came very quickly (the post stickers were supposed to take 15 minutes...).  Initial impression was the noodles were undercooked so I tried the broth and seafood.  Both were excellent; best fishcake since I lived in Japan.  After about 5 minutes, I tried the noodles and they had cooked to perfection in the broth.  I don't like over cooked, over soft noodles; these were excellent.  Did I mention the broth was very good?  My friends comments on the pork noodles was pretty much the same.  The potstickers?  Yep, the new waiter (who came in late) gave them to another party.  Since I was pretty much done, I figured I'd just back them off the bill and chalk it up to a suddenly popular place adjusting to getting slammed.  I didn't say anything to the wait staff, I figured they were already stressed enough...

As we were finishing up, the manager, Sam, came over and  apologized for the wait in getting our orders taken and admitted that our waiter had given my potstickers to another party.  He apologized and comp'd our meals.  He also brought out two orders (beef and pork) potstickers for us to take home with us (even though we both declined).  Lastly, he presented us with a pair of their custom spoons.  I'd admired the spoons as we were eating and had noticed that they had the restaurant's name engraved on them... Well, now I have one.  

After the initial mis-step, the waiters pretty much recovered and the noodle dishes were excellent.  Sam did what a GOOD manager does and apologized and did ALL he could to recover from his staff's mistakes.  I was impressed and very surprised by this; it's no longer a common practice.

Oh, and the potstickers?  Delicious!  I'm enjoying the pork ones as I type.

So, 'Yes', I heartily recommend Shang's not just for the food but for a team that cares about the experience their customer has in their restaurant.",igEn_XExkDnqRx_270Ut1Q,0,0,5,8Z1Yx1amKW6BY0Cpzfg7jQ

Spicy wontons were wonderful. I wanted to put the spicy wonton sauce on everything. 

I ordered the shang beef noodles and my friend ordered the Dan Dan. We also shared the fried rice. The fried rice is great. It might be counterintuitive to order fried rice at a place known for noodles but they do it right. 

I didn't love the shang beef noodle soup. It was good and filling but I think I enjoyed every other item ordered (including the Dan Dan noodles) more than the soup. I even enjoyed all the individual parts of the soup. I just didn't care much for the broth. Hopefully there's another broth more to my liking because this place overall is really good.

I went back and tried the pork belly broth. It is sooo much more flavorful than the beef. If you're not anti pork, go for the pork",iG-V0nBbeD-pnIcquXH5YQ,1,1,5,Ot5cchHg7KWuQQNh47drKA

A small space with a pleasant wooden interior, Shang offers an environment that reminds me of being in Japan or Taiwan, and even allows you to watch the fresh dough being made into their awesome noodles. My favorite is the knife cut (I love thicker), but they're all great! Also do not skip the side dishes! If you're going with one, or its your first visit, you must try the beef pancake. Its flavorful, juicy, and the dough perfect. The pot stickers are also awesome (as are the dumpling, I just love a great, classic pot sticker) and I get the cucumber salad every time.

It's not very big, so get there early so you don't have to wait too long.

Luckily when we got there, there was enough seats at the bar. When we left. There was a line up at the door already. 

I had braised pork ribs noodles. The braised pork ribs was pretty good, but one of my family members gave me a braised beef, and that was so good! Definitely go for their signature bowl! 

We got some dumplings, and also pan fried bun (sorry I don't remember the name on the menu anymore), but it was so so so juicy!!! Be careful when you bite, the juices squirt out and might be hot! We watched as the master made it in front of us. It wasn't frozen or anything!

2972863,2017-11-11,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I know nothing about noodles. But on a recommendation I was told to go to Shang. It is on the west side Decatur and Flamingo. Located in one of the strip malls that used to have a great French cafe on the corner of the property. The inside of the restaurant is very simple but nicely decored. It probably has seating for thirty people. I ordered the spicy wontons as an appetizer $5.95. They were spicy hot but not too hard to manage but had a good flavor.
     I  also ordered the pork belly Bowl. The stock was flavorful and the noodles were shaved.  The noodles were very tasty.
The broth  had bok choy in it and the pork belly was okay. The pork belly was not fresh and had been precooked and some pieces were a little dry. A food prep thing I'm sure.
 You are served a nice flavored water, I think it was cucumber water.  
    You definitely will be filled by the time you get to the end of your noodle bowl. It was not too salty nor lacking anything. I am not a pro on Noodle bowls but I would take a friend here for something different. The price is reasonable 8.95 for a big bowl. 
   The waiter was very cordial and was helpful in choosing the right noodle for my bowl. 
     You could see them pulling noodles in the prep kitchen. 
    You are given chopsticks and a personal size ladle for your bowl. The waiter said anyone who requested a soup spoon and fork are available for those who cannot manage chopsticks.

There are only 6 tables and about 11 bar top seats. Its not a very big restaurant, but it was very bright, clean and there's an open kitchen so you can see them making fresh noodles right in front of you. 

The menu was simple enough, and our server did explain to us that there were different types of noodles that we could choose from. We were given fruit infused water. 

3.5/5 for the spicy wontons. Oh man! With all the pictures on yelp, I was expecting a larger portion size. The 3 of us started off with the spicy wontons and were disappointed at how small the bowl was. Nonetheless, it was very good. I could have eaten 10 bowls as my main entree. It wasn't spicy at all though, so my friends did add in some of their hot sauce on the table. (Be careful with that and pour some into your spoon BEFORE you pour it over whatever dish you want!) There were only 9 wontons in the bowl and it left me wanting more. It was perfectly cooked and the meat was soft. However, the sauce that it came in was a bit watered down. My friend commented that they should have strained it a bit longer. 

My friend and I ordered the Shang beef hand pulled noodles and her bf ordered the pork rib noodle with hand pulled noodles. To my surprise, my order came out with knife shaved noodles. The water didn't check back on us and I didn't say anything because I didn't want them to waste it. 

3/5 for the Shang Beef noodles.The knife shaved noodles was ok, I normally like hand shaved noodles because I feel that it can be very doughy/chewy and hard to eat. My friends thought the beef broth was PERFECT. They slurped it all up. I thought the beef broth was a bit on the salty side. Maybe it was because we came at night so they were heating the broth up all day? Not sure. There were large, soft chunks of braised beef brisket. I had so much meat that I ended up giving a few pieces to my friend who ordered the pork rib noodles. I will add extra bok choy ($0.75) next time because I felt that it needed more vegetables. 

Pork rib noodles comes with pork broth. My friend enjoyed his dish but said that he would not order it again because it came with too little meat. He will probably the Shang Beef Noodles next time. My friends enjoyed their hand pulled noodles and gave me some to try as well. I really liked it.

Service was ok. We waited a while for the check and for the waitress to process our check even though the restaurant was about 1/3 full. I would recommend that the waitresses have checks prepared for tables that look like they are almost done eating so when they come by to pick up empty bowls/clear the tables, they can also drop off the check.

3088851,2018-06-25,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Shang Artisan Noodle did not disappoint. I've been on a Chinese noodle soup kick after being totally burned out on ramen. The space is small with a sign in list for when there's a wait. We sat at the bar where you can view the noodles being made and the appetizers being prepped. 

We ordered a couple of Asahi beers (only bottled beers here... shame) along with the cucumber salad, beef pancake and spicy wontons. My boyfriend got the Pork Rib Noodle with hand pulled noodles and I opted for the Shang Beef Noodle with knife shaved noodles. The noodles came out first, followed by the cucumber salad, wontons, and beef pancake. Perhaps order any starters first before ordering your noodles to not get overwhelmed with food all at the same time. 

The cucumber salad was a boat load of cucmber sticks with a slightly spicy peanutty dressing layered on top. Mix it up to make sure you don't use all your dressing on the top layer only. I appreciated having a crunchy, fresh dish along with the heavier noodles, though the cold cucumbers after a bite of soup made my teeth quite sensitive. The spicy wontons were as good as they look. They give you a lot of wontons and I like that they have a smaller filling so that they're easier to eat. I wasn't that big of a fan of the beef pancake. As soon as you cut one open the packed filling kind of falls out and the harder outside made the dish disconnected. 

The soups though.. they're so good. My boyfriend's pork rib broth was unreal. Very umami with hints of soy and pork bone. My Shang beef noodle was comparatively more oily with a bit more spice (you can also add chili paste as a condiment at the table). They give you a ton of meat and the pieces weren't overly fatty. This is majorly comforting noodle soup. Very clean, very simple but amazing broth and noodles. The knife shaved was more uneven than probably most people are used to but were short enough to not feel like you're eating a giant glob of noodles in every bite. I look forward to coming to Shang more often in my transition away from ramen.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,1,0,5,swgLTN65E8pMoiuxe5CwIA

3190256,2018-01-09,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"SAN is a small little noodle shop located on Flamingo Rd. near the Vegas Strip. They don't have much seating, so you may have to wait. Luckily, we went early enough (11:20AM on a Thursday) that we got seated within 5-10 minutes. As you're waiting, you can watch the chefs make your noodles from scratch. They'll throw it around and twist it and toss it in the air, and it's really entertaining to watch. I'm giving SAN 5 stars because 1. they have great friendly, efficient service 2. the food is so reasonably priced compared to everywhere else in Vegas ($10 for noodles) and 3. the food is SO GOOD. For the table, we ordered a cucumber salad. Unlike other restaurants, their cucumbers are covered with a sesame paste and some spicy oil. It's a little like the traditional Dan Dan noodle flavoring, a little ""peanuty"" a little spicy, but it's deliious and refreshing. I myself ordered the Pork Belly noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles. The hand-pulled noodles are the traditional noodles that are a little thinner like spaghetti, whereas the knife cut noodles are thick and flat and more doughy. I absolutely loved my dish! The broth was so rich and aromatic; a little on the sweet side, but it complimented the tender pork belly so well! As for the noodles, oh my gosh, these are possibly the best noodles I've ever had. They were the literal perfect texture of chewy and doughy and you can taste the dough/yeast flavoring still, and somehow they got it to soak up the broth so perfectly that the noodles are flavored with whatever you order.

I saw at least three groups of customers walk out because they waited too long. She also gave my credit card and bill back to another customer which luckily both the other and I were paying attention so I got it back from the other customer right away. It was so bad it was actually amusing to watch.  My point of updating is to help the management out. The manager came in about an hour later and tried to help her waitress (yes she was the only one). But what he should've done was let her go home or fire her because she kept making the situation worse. First impressions and service is super important and you can't afford to lose one customer over a stumbling drunk waitress. You already are understaffed I know but a bad waitress is worse than mediocre food. Your food is not mediocre so ditch the bad waitress and hire better people. Also there were three chefs in the back staring at her because she messed up all the orders. Some customer had to correct her 3 times and then finally just went and told the chef their order. Maybe you don't need 3 chefs when the one waitress they have can't take orders? Seriously they would've done better passing the iPad around and having the customers order their own food.

Tried the hand pulled beef soup noodles. Rich, flavorful broth. Beef was too fatty for my taste, but I'm sure some love it. Need to add chili, so it's not so starchy.

Ordered the knife cut chicken/mushroom gravy noodles. Found it a little too ""gravyish"" for my taste. 

Got the kids hand cut chicken chow mien. Delicious! Fresh cabbage, onions, large pieces of chicken. Needed some acid to balance it, so added the dipping sauce meant for the potstickers. 

1 order of steamed beef dumplings- not as good as Din Tai Fung, but also about half the price. Din Tai Fung uses a thinner wrapper. More sophisticated and complex. This is thicker and more rustic. 

The pan fried dumplings have a cool crispy layer on top- almost like a cheese skirt, but Asian :). Definitely need the soy dipping sauce to cut the grease.

Beef pancakes were good, but again, thicker skin, while I prefer a thinner skin. Felt it was a lot of carbs. 

The table next to us order the cucumbers. Would highly recommend, as it would add crunchy and something healthy to break up the starch. 

Overall, reasonable, authentic and tasty. Wouldn't recommend to a diabetic, but great if you like carbs and noodles!",Pk2EF2487BCgQJ0dpwIukQ,1,2,4,htogH39pZOAMiRYN4fSDtQ

3314656,2017-01-29,2,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"This place was good. The guys making the noodles are pretty awesome! To be honest, if I could give a 3 and a half star, I would, but I'm rounding up to a 4.

The food was pretty solid... we ordered the Pork and Cabbage Boiled Dumplings, Beef Pancake, Shang Beef Noodle Soup, and the Pork Belly Noodle Soup.

Everything seemed like it was made with great, fresh ingredients! They didn't do anything ""wrong"" per se.  Unfortunately for us, the taste was a little less flavorful for our liking. Even when dipping the dumplings in the sauce they provided, which was a nice sesame oil mixture with maybe shoyu or soy sauce.  Are we too used to super salty foods now???

I do tend to like more bland food, and my husband likes more salty food, but even for me, I thought the food was .... okay.

We liked the pork belly noodle soup better than the shang beef noodle soup, because the broth was a little more flavorful, and the fattiness of the pork belly really made the bites taste good. Also, the way the Bok Choy was cooked perfectly, they had a nice crisp to them.  

I personally liked the chewiness of the hand pulled noodles, and my husband liked the size of the hand shaved noodles. The other reviewers were correct that you should be careful biting into the beef pancakes, my husband took a bite and the juice squirted across the table onto me! Good thing I was wearing black. I suggest taking a small bite out of the skin, and then when taking the next bite making sure to close your lips over the pancake so that if it does squirt, it'll hopefully squirt into your mouth and not across the table lol.  My husband ended up using a napkin to cover his pancake so that it would squirt onto the napkin and not across the table.",vh8v72MaEqUCsNwWsslibg,1,1,4,pRRl0qlEfJV85i5d6i1ghw

The cucumber salad was solid, with a pistachio-like glaze, but not a must order.  The biggest gripe with my meal was that it was significantly unspicy.  Usually at these types of restaurants there's a scale of spice or at leat a chili sauce addition, but neither were served at Shang.  If looking for spice, go elsewhere; f looking for quality, authentic noodle, come here.

The price is exceptional and the speed of receiving the meal was as fast as any restaurant in town.  For under $10 you can be full in under 30 minutes.

I ordered the Dan Dan Noodles and spicy wontons.  The Dan Dan noodles had quite a bit of kick to it since it's minced pork mixed with some chilli oil.  Got the hand pulled noodles.  You can tell the noodles were handmade, just by the texture and taste.  

The spicy wontons came in a small bowl, but had more wontons than you'd expect.  They're a smaller size, but they're shareable between 2 people and filling.  I believe the wontons were mixed with some chilli oil and a little bit of soy sauce.  Excellent flavor.

That said, if you're not feeling the patience, go early- it was a Wednesday evening and our wait time was 30 minutes. No big deal here, I was looking forward to finding out what this place is all about. 

As we were seated, our server delivered fresh cucumber water, the flavored water was a nice surprise. The smells are enticing for sure. The dining room lively. The décor modern. So far, so good.

Ordered:
Cucumber Salad that comes with a puréed dressing- extra chili oil over top- the dressing of peanuts, chili oil, nutty sesame oil and seed, and ginger for the zing. This was satisfying, light and refreshing - a good plate to share among friends.

Beef noodle w/ Knife cut noodle - arrives piping hot and topped with fresh herbs (green onion & cilantro), the smells were so good wish there was ""smell-o-vision"" to share with you as the soup steamed through the herbaciousness. 
My first thought after first bite? Nice tooth to the noodle! Glad we went the knife cut, on suggestion of my fellow Yelpers - good call and thanks ya'll! The texture of the meat had too much fattiness running thru to really sort through without getting fat in each bite, so that freaked out the bf and wasn't my favorite truth be told... anyone sensitive to textures, I'd say try the pork rib or one of the other soups. That said, THE FLAVOR of the meaty beef broth had that roasted-bone sweet richness- personally, I recommend this one for that deep beefy-onion flavor.

Pork rib noodle knife cut - First thought upon first bite? Oh My. In a good way. Meat had a good texture, on the bone adding all the delicious meat-on-boneness. Then there was the sweet, onion, and slightly acidicly-light and almost lemony broth that I found delightful to the last drop. Lighter than the beef, but still rich in pork broth flavor and again freshness from green onion/cilantro. The noodles were once again cooked perfectly, not soft, not too hard - just right. And I really enjoyed eating the pork down to the bone.

The food: FYI, they serve 3 different types of noodles. Plain, handmade and knifed shaven! The most popular one is the handmade. I mean, you get to watch your noodles made from scratch! How cool is that? However, I was more fond of the knifed shaven noodles. I love chewy noodles! My boyfriend and I ordered, beef pancakes, shang beef noodle soup & the pork belly noodle soup. We pretty much ordered the popular dishes. The Shang Beef didn't disappoint me. The brisket was chewy and the broth was rich and had a slight kick to it!

1. Flavorful but not overly salty or fatty broth - check!
2. Generous portion of soft, tender braised beef - check!
3. Hand-made, fresh, chewy noodles - check! (If you like a thicker noodle, get the knife cut)
4. Vegetables - I love pickled mustard greens in my beef noodle soup which is Taiwanese style so I wasn't surprised Shang's didn't have it. But they did serve a generous portion of bok choy which I appreciated very much so - check! 

I also ordered the beef pies which come in 4 small portions. Mix the chili and soy sauce on the table for dipping and beware of the juicy inside when biting! I really liked the small portion of the beef pies -- makes portion control easier since it can get a little heavy on the tummy.

Being from San Diego, we are accustomed to eating Ramen, pho, and any other noodle dishes u can think of.  Staying on the LV strip without a car, lyfting off the strip is not worth it if the food is just mediocre.  My wife wanted to try something new, I myself am ok with eating at Noodle Asia since we always stay at the Venetian. The price at Noodle Asia is around $15 per bowl of noodle soup, however, you don't have to pay $20 for a round trip Lyft.  It's worth the money and we will be heading back here for sure, on every Vegas trip.

I got the ShangHai Beef Noodle soup and wife got pork rib noodle soup.  Broth was phenomenal and the noodles are fresh fresh fresh. They make their noodles on the spot and you can record it to show your friends.

You can pick from 3 different types of noodles, but all do taste the same: hand-pulled noodles (the longest), knife cut (smaller sized noodle length), and plain (which is cut by a machine). My bf got the shang beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles and I ordered the tomato and scrambled egg with plain noodle (this was a dry noodle). Both were delicious. Broth was very flavorful and rich for the noodle soup. 

We also ordered the cucumber salad. I'm used to it being a sort of pickled flavor with chili oil and spice, but this one was chili oil and sesame oil and drenched in some kind of peanut-like sauce.

Their Shang Fried rice is steamed rice and it tastes delightfully caramelized, with chock full of tasty tidbits of eggs, minced pork, preserved bean sprouts, and veggies.

My parents shared the Seafood noodles and it was a little bland for me. We also tried the Sliced Beef shank with balsamic sauce and the beef tasted of good quality.

A friend of mine was in town and had a late flight back to California so we were looking for somewhere interesting to eat. He is Chinese and asked me if I had ever had handmade noodles before. I had not, so he Yelp'ed it and found Shang. He basically ordered for me, as I told him just to pick whatever he thought would be good, but everything was so flavorful and delicious. I know we got spicy wontons - very spicy for me but totally worth the mouth burn - and a cucumber salad, which was very different than what I've had, being that I'm used to a basic sliced cucumber salad made with rice vinegar. This one had some sort of tangy nutty sauce drizzled all on the top of it, which was very delicious. The noodles were almost like comfort food. I wish I had more experience with these types of noodles, so I could describe them better, but I suppose if you've never had them before (say, you're more familiar with ramen noodles, or pho, or udon) then you'll be in the same boat as I am and perhaps will give this place a try based on my noodle-naive review :)",wfK7oukwc90fVqFG2lw87w,2,2,5,DeJkgTJU2g2OeRaQNX_WHQ

We also ordered the Beef Shang Noodle- a favorite here for good reason. I recommend ordering the knife sliced noodles with this one and ordering an extra side of noodles because you will probably need it considering how tasty this dish is and the noodles may be on the lighter side depending on your hunger.

3684547,2018-03-31,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"For my quick stint in Vegas, this was the place I was most excited to try.  A handmade noodle place in Vegas serving beef noodle soup?  I couldn't wait!  We arrived at around 11:30am and waited for 15 minutes for seats at the bar.  We had a perfect view for the noodles being made and the potstickers being wrapped.

We started with the spicy wontons, which were pretty average.  They're exactly as you'd expect them to be.  I actually would have preferred if they were a bit more spicy.  We also got the beef pancakes, which are essentially ""sheng jian bao"", except a little flatter.  An order comes with four and each one was generous in filling.  They were fried to a nice golden brown.  The strange thing was that the order came with a knife and the waitress said to cut them in half to let the juice out since otherwise it'll squirt out as you bite it.  I disagree.  The whole point is to eat this juicy pan-fried bun and not let the greasy goodness end up on the plate.  Eat these like you would a xiao long bao.  Hold it in your spoon, bite the top open, suck out the broth, and keep eating.

For noodles, we went with the Shang's beef noodle and the pork belly noodle, both with knife-shaved noodles.  Both were good, but the beef noodle was the better of the two.  The broth was so complex and rich, with a great beefy flavor.  The braised beef brisket was tender and plentiful.  The pork belly noodle broth was a bit muddled and required some hot oil to ""brighten"" it up a bit.  The noodles were delicious, with a really nice texture to them.

We also got the zha-jiang noodle which was, surprisingly, my favorite dish today.  It came with carrots, cucumber, and edamame to mix with the nice rich sauce.  We went with the hand-pulled noodles this time and they were so perfectly ""QQ"".

The staff were all really friendly.  There was a huge line waiting outside, but you never felt rushed.  They were attentive and often asked how we were doing or if we needed more hot water for our tea.

The MVP of this place was the guy making the noodle.  He's a beast in the kitchen.  He went between pulling noodles, shaving noodles, warming up bowls, portioning noodles, and helping on the finishing line.  He was constantly busy and was the reason food was coming out of the kitchen so quickly and consistently.

Why 4 stars instead of 5?  I'd like the knife-shaved noodles to be a bit broader and a bit thicker.  The noodles were great at the start, but quickly got a bit soggy.  I usually prefer knife-shaved noodles to hand-pulled because knife-shaved noodles are thick enough to not get soggy.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case here.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,1,2,4,3WNlRGPStfj9SSubWB7pEQ
3698251,2017-09-29,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Who went in on the noodles. *raises hands* I did!

I gotta say that this establishment came in hot with the fresh noodles. You pick a noodle dish and then you pick your choice of noodles (hand-pulled, knife shaven, plain).

BEEF PANCAKE: Definitely order this. It is so good. Crispy outer shell with the piping hot and juicy beef wonton meat in the center. However, I must WARN YOU on HOW TO CUT IT IN HALF because I learned it the hard way. The inside of the pancake has so much hot juice. So DO NOT slice it like you would if it were a sandwich. Stab the middle of the pancake (yes, like if you were going to shank someone in the penn.), and then cut with the knife still vertical. I did it the other way, and the juice popped right through the wonton shell and headed straight for my sister's eye. The juice was piping hot so the aftermath WAS NOT A GOOD TIME.

Wontons: I mean, you just gotta get the wontons! How do you not!

DAN DAN: I lowkey thought these were like the dan dan noodles with the peanut sauce like the one in Hong Kong. But they are not. However, I'm no expert, but I believe this is the original way of serving dan dan noodles anyway. AGAIN, NOT a professional so I cannot confirm that that is accurate. It is spicy. Like a level 6 spicy but it is so good. I am obsessed and I recommend getting it with the hand-pulled.

BEEF SHANG: This is a restaurant favorite and a GO-TO for a lot of people who visit vs. the beef shank. However, if you've eaten at The Noodle Man. I think it's kind of similar to the beef dish at The Noodle Man also.

PORK BELLY NOODLE: If you love pork belly, I'd choose this over the beef shang. It was actually really good, and the broth was amazing. Opt for the knife shaven noodles with this. It's poppin'.",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,2,0,5,hwXsh1dFAishBaygSkJilA

The broth was not as rich as the Taiwanese ones I had but this one hit the spot.  I selected the hand carved noodles because it was less chewy than the knife cut ones.  So I will definitely be coming back,1eOJSCb2aDQakloIzVqiYg,0,0,5,o6srXCLLxdNuFT3St0jemQ
3728352,2016-09-08,4,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I have to first say I have been dying to try this type of place but this is my first so I have nothing to compare it to.  That's the reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 stars.

The first portion of my review will (hopefully) be humorous.  My only experience with hand made noodles is from cooking shows.  Every single time there is an Asian person making them.  I walked in expecting to see something like on TV but nope... Here's a tatted up ginger flinging noodles.  I laughed out loud at myself ""stereotype shattered"".   In fact, I thought it was so funny I commented to the waiter who was lighthearted himself. Turns out the person making the noodles was teaching another guy how to do it.  

Now the rest:
1. Super clean
2. Very reasonably priced
3. Great Service
4. I ordered beef noodle.  Great savory broth. Love the fresh cilantro. Meat seemed like short rib & could have used a little more cooking but still tasty but not quite that tender to falling apart.
5. Big portion.  I ate half and took the other half to go. Reheat was great so basically I got 2 meals for under $10

It's in a strip mall so parking was tight when I arrived but cleared out 15 minutes later when the nail salon next door was closing up.  There's a McDonalds next door with big lot and no signs saying ""McD parking only"" so that was fine.

They do not have dessert because there's a small shop next door with desserts.  I tried that too and just not my thing. I would just go a few blocks to Sweets Roku. 

It's a bit of a drive but I'm definitely going back.",HK-TlD0yVA_tpTXZxfzu2w,6,5,4,rI2iCoaVaOdhIeSpjvrhUQ

3768239,2017-07-15,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"TLDR: hand-pulled noodles; no card payment under $10; infused tap water; hit or miss service

I have had this bookmarked for quite some time and waited until a return visit before I gave a review. I came for a lunch on a weekday exactly at 12noon and was surprised to see only 1 other customer, as this place can get packed. 

The first time I dined here, I was greeted with excellent service and the server explained what infusion the water was that day. On my most recent visit, I don't even think she knew what was infused in the water; however, no information was given. 

Because I only had a card on me, I had to make sure that I ordered something over $10. I opted for the seafood bowl with hand-pulled noodles. The order came promptly within 5 minutes as there were no other customers. 

On previous occasions, I have dined with friends and ordered the tomato and egg fried rice and and have seen the dumplings. The size of the dumplings were perfect and were definitely made in-house. The fried rice was interesting and definitely meant as a side dish. 

I love the size of the seafood bowl as well as the seafood ingredients. There were good-sized prawns with calamari and slices of a fish roll. The chili oil pleasantly accompanied the dish to improve the dish without taking away from its original flavor. The noodles were chewy and delightful. The broth was almost creamy and was good to the last drop. 

I was disappointed with the service and attentiveness of the server. Although she was busy with other tasks and with only 1 other table at this point of my meal, I often had to flag her down to get water refills and other needs. It was funny, however, that she was quick to get my bowl even though I wasn't finished. This is probably just a training issue. Regardless of the hit or miss service, I'm willing to return because he food is that good.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,3,1,4,akW4jdrBENNgx7_rub-EsA

We also tried their hot tea, it had a roasted peanut taste, which was interesting and nice.

I would definitely recommend their signature ""Shang Beef Noodle"" bowl and all their appetizers. I mean all of them! You have to go for the (beef or pork) potstickers and Spicy wonton.

For appetizers, we got sliced beef. It's a cold dish and the beef is dry and hard to chew. I had one slice and that was it. 

2nd appetizer: spicy wonton - which was not too spicy but lacked flavor. I had to add soy sauce to mine. 

3rd appetizer: beef pancakes - careful eating this. The juice inside can squirt out to 12 inches. This also lacked flavor and just tasted like deep fried dough. 

For the main course I tried the chicken and mushroom noodle. I had to let the noodle sit in the sauce for a while before it really soaked in. It's a thicker sauce. 

Another main course was the pork belly noodle soup (prob the only favorite thing I tried today). Plenty of pork belly and bok choy in this dish.

I also got a side of the potstickers which were presented beautifully to look like an upside down giant portabello mushroom. But even though they were homemade, their taste left a bit to be desired. They just weren't that flavorful, even with the soy and vinegar dipping sauce.

We had two juice squirting accidents (that sounds kind of wrong?) during our meal! The Shang beef noodle soup is also a tasty dish with good flavor and tender beef.

It's especially fun with their open kitchen and work stations that you get to see the noodles being made and pulled right in front of you! You have the option of hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I've tried both now and prefer the hand pulled. The consistency and size of the knife cut were too all over the place that I didn't enjoy it too much. 

They have a lot of different noodle dishes, both soups and dry/saucy noodles so everyone in your party can be in for a treat. The shop is on the smaller side so I wouldn't recommend coming with a large party. There is probably 8 tables total. There is bar seating as well.

The seafood was all tasty, but I would have preferred the bok choy to have been cooked a little more. The noodles were the highlight as they were fantastic.

I'll admit that I'm a tonkotsu ramen junkie who prefers strong/aggressive broth flavors over the more subdued style typical of Chinese noodle soup, but I still found the pork/chicken combo broth satisfactory.

My group also split a beef pancake (this is more of the xian bing style) and a yang chow fried rice. The beef pancake was super juicy, and while the yang chow fried rice was a tad ""artisan-y"" and on the small side, it was still tasty.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,0,2,4,UEIWqlzyPKbvlyWPWHfi8Q

The chili wonton and it's tasty sauce, the juicy, crunchy beef pancake, the pork belly noodle soup, the beef noodle soup, and even the potstickers (which got ousted by how good the other dishes were).

I ordered the wonton soup with added hand-tossed noodles, and shared the cucumber salad appetizer and fried rice with my husband and our awesome friend/realtor. It was really cool watching the staff stretch the noodles and toss them around like they're just playdoh.

3960336,2018-04-27,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Growing up having a lot of Northern-style noodles, I went to Shang's Artisan Noodle certainly with expectations. The truth is, nostalgia in the taste palate is hard to surpass, or even match. With that in mind, Shang's northern-style noodles come close to my childhood memories.

I got the knife-shaved Shang beef noodle. What I looked for were tender meat, chewy noodle, and flavorful broth. The meat knocks it out of the park--it was tender, flavorful, and required little effort to chew. The rich flavor gets even more potent when accompanied by a spoonful of the delicious soup. The only thing missing the mark were the knifed-shaved noodles; they were thick and chewy but lacked the beef flavor. I am not an expert but may be the noodles needed to be immersed in the broth a littler longer. Nevertheless, the experience was still a pleasant one. 

We also got Pork & Cabbage Boiled Dumpling and Beef pancake. Both were quite good but short of amazing. To me, they tasted a little bland even when dipped in the sauce that is on every table. Also, I think both dishes use the same fillings because the tasted similarly. While each side dish can be a good complement to your noodle soup, you shouldn't get them both at the same time. 

The service didn't comply with my childhood memory at all, which is certainly a good thing. Our server was very attentive and frequently checked on us to see if we were okay.

I also got the chance to see them start the process.

The cook had two large spoons to stir the meat.  Very interesting to watch the start of making the broth.

My bowl of soup was brought and it was very good.  The beef flavor was nice and strong.  There were very tender beef cubes in the soup, and it also contained three baby bok choy.

4047009,2016-09-02,2,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"The closest comparison to this restaurant is The Noodle Man off of Rainbow and 215, and this is better.  With a few hiccups that could be resolved, this place could receive a 5 star rating in my book.  This place has a lot of potential.  The prices are reasonable, right around where they should be.  Sub $5 appetizers are great (albeit a bit small).

We ordered family style so we could try a little bit of everything.  The size and shape of the restaurant is almost identical to The Noodle Man, but the layout is a bit different but it seats roughly the same amount of people.  There's a glass window for you to watch the chefs pull noodles and you can rest assured, your noodles are fresh in every bowl.  I also believe we had a chef in training preparing our food.  I saw him pulling noodles and having issues with it (caucasian chef).  He then asked another chef (perhaps a managing chef?), ""why are my noodles falling apart? Maybe it needs more water.""  The other chef tells him he will take a look at it later.  He then responds saying, ""I'll see if I can save some of this.""  I don't think they noticed I was listening, but these are not words I want to hear as a customer.  Clearly there's an issue with the noodles and we as consumers do not want some salvaged noodles.

I had a couple of issues with the sauces provided.  I was told by the waitress that the white container was soy sauce and the red container was chili oil.  I smelled the bottle openings and told her that the white bottles were vinegar, not soy sauce.  She took them away and replaced them and said the new ones were soy sauce.  One bottle was soy sauce and one was still vinegar.  She explained that the white containers used to contain vinegar but have now all been switched to soy sauce.  This sounds like a clientele preference, rather than an authenticity choice.  All of their items should be served with vinegar and I think that should be a default item on the table, rather than something that should be requested.  Personally, I prefer a concoction mix of vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil.  The waitress explained that perhaps I was mistaken and that because their soy sauce is made in house, it almost tastes like vinegar.

Spicy Wonton - This is one dish that is better at The Noodle Man.  This was bland, it wasn't spicy at all.  The wonton itself was good, but I didn't expect to have to load it with flavor.

Beef and Onion Potsticker and Pork and Cabbage Potsticker - I've grouped these together because they both had great flavor, and it's a matter of what kind of filling is your preference.  My issue with both of these is that the skin wasn't crispy on the bottom like it should be.  The flavor was great.  If they could pan fry the skin to the correct texture, I would order these every time.  Perhaps an error by the chef in training?  I'm sure the boiled would be tasty.  If given the option, I always prefer pan fried (potsticker) because of the texture and it's always much more fragrant and I start salivating at the sight and smell.

Beef Pancake - Again, delicious filling.  These were a bit crispier but there was one major flaw.  The dough wasn't cooked in the inside because where they tuck the dough in the center to create this flat look from the folded flap, the dough is thicker and therefore was not cooked and partially raw.  Because food was piling on, we didn't notice until towards the end of the meal and we showed the waitress and she was all over it.  She gave us the option for a new order or to take it off the check, but we were all full by that time and opted not to have a new order prepared.

I know, this review doesn't seem very positive but I think all of these issues are easily correctable.  We're about to get into the highlights of the meal.

Shang Beef Noodle - This to me was the highlight of the meal.  The broth was perfectly balanced.  It was tasty, not too salty and had a slight subtle heat.  The brisket was prepared as it should be, but I wouldn't have minded a few more pieces.  I ordered this with the hand pulled noodles and they were a great compliment.  I would be very happy if I ordered just this bowl and nothing else.

Pork Belly Noodle, Pork Rib Noodle and Dan Dan noodles are on the list of things to order the next visit.

Lan-Zhou Noodle - This was a decent choice, but reminiscent of that bowl you want on a rainy day when you are down with the cold.  It was much less ""flavorful"" and not my top choice.  The clear beef bone broth had the flavor that reminded me off my parents beef bone soup growing up.  We also ordered these with the hand pulled noodles.  I'd like to try the knife shaved noodles in some sort of noodle soup (broth) on my next visit.

Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle - This was another highlight of the meal.  The flavor was excellent and well balanced. We ordered these with the knife shaved noodles.  I think these were a great compliment giving the noodles a great texture.

Being so new, it's clean and immaculate inside.

Oh, but I do like the ladies room - check it out! 

For day 2 of business, the servers were friendly and knew the menu items. I asked one server what she recommended, and she said a popular item is the Beef Pancake. The Beef Pancake is more of a pan fried dumpling than a pancake. Be careful when you take your first bite as there is juice that will squirt out! It was enjoyable, but I like a thinner dumpling skin like XLBs. 

The Sesame Chicken Cold Noodle dish was made with fresh sesame paste/sauce. There was a strong sesame flavor but not overwhelming. With the hot weather, this was a refreshing dish. Filling too if you finish by yourself. 

Lastly, I tried the Pork Belly Noodle soup with Knife Shaved noodles. I enjoyed the knife shaved noodles a lot, and will make it my go to noodle here. The broth flavor was ok, but needed an added element, so I added in their house spicy chili sauce.

Overhype rarely matches expectations and I would say it is a perfect example here.  To be clear, nothing was bad, it just didn't WOW or scream 4-5 Star awesomeness.

The best aspect for sure are the fresh noodles.  Then the beef in the Shang Noodles were tender and tasty.

From there, it drops.  The broth is surely not of the taiwanese deep beefy taste nor spicy, so be warned and you my like it better here.  It was a-ok and slightly sweet.

As the lower reviews note, the beef pancake while comes pipin hot and juicy, lacks flavor.  It's quite forgettable.

The spicy wontons are just way too small and seems like they try and hide that fact with a strong pepper lacing.  The sauce was also sweeter then I prefer.

Surely I am jaded as we eat this type of fair all over Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Asia.  The prices here are decent which reminded me of mom and pop joints in Asia, but it won't match the taste if you have the same type of expectations.

4108291,2016-12-12,7,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"After my first plan for dinner bafflingly failed, I found another nearby noodle restaurant that delivered. Well, figuratively anyway. Unless you go for Uber Eats, which is fine if you don't want freshly cooked noodles, and that would probably be a big mistake. Am I rambling? Whoops.

Anyway, I found my way to the plaza on Flamingo near Decatur containing Shang Artisan Noodle as my plan B for early Sunday night dinner. It was easy to find because it's next to Yonaka, a place that's quite familiar to me. I walked inside and was glad to see that only a couple other parties of patrons were there.

I chose bar seating when the server asked me my preference. I took my time to look at the menu as well as friends' reviews. Sadly, they were out of the consensus favorite knife-shaved noodles and only had hand-pulled noodles and plain noodles available.

Of course I had to settle on the hand-pulled noodles at that point. My Shang Beef Noodle Soup ($8.95) came out after a few short minutes. The noodles indeed were al dente and tasted fresh, but they weren't utterly captivating. The broth wasn't complex, but it was  properly seasoned and hence quite slurpable (albeit with a shallower than expected wooden spoon). The beef was just tender enough and was fairly tasty. The bok choy was cooked nicely, and it brought a juicy crunch and a slight bitterness. It's not my favorite bowl of beef noodle soup around, but it's pretty solid overall.

My ""appetizer"" came out later, having taken roughly 10 minutes to cook as I'd been forewarned. The Beef Pancakes ($5.49) are not what Americans would call a pancake, but instead a stuffed savory dumpling or bun. They're pretty doughy and have a flavorful, juicy ground beef filling that gushes out liquid when you cut into it with the serrated knife. I completely forgot about the dipping sauce during and after my first bite, and that sauce does help lend sweetness but isn't strictly necessary. I didn't bother to try out the tableside condiments of soy sauce or chili oil on either of my orders because they didn't seem necessary.

Luckily, I got to catch a show toward the end of my meal when the chef made another batch of hand-pulled noodles. It's pretty fun to see the strands gradually take shape and thin out as the chef twists and rolls the dough. This is definitely the best part of sitting at the bar, or at least with your seat facing the kitchen.

I'll definitely come back to Shang Artisan Noodle so I can sink my teeth into the knife-shaved noodles. Even without having tried those noodles, I'd recommend this restaurant as a good solo or small group dining option for fresh Chinese noodles and those juicy, beefy morsels on the appetizer menu.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,10,4,l64yvOB0dmOyA_BNaOJ5DQ

We're Korean, and Korea has many Chinese living there who brought hand pulled noodles to Korea, so Koreans love hand pulled noodles. So, that's my food background that will shed light on my review.

I think it's a hit or miss on the dishes. We tried the chicken and mushroom. The sauce was good. The noodles weren't as chewy as I'm used to. It didn't have that slick but chewy texture. I would say probably the flour is an issue. 

The staple of hand pulled noodles in Korea is Jja-zhang or I think they called it Peking Jja-zhang (I actually don't know how to spell it in English)... in Taiwan, Dan Dan, and in Peking as well they have lots of jja-zhanng... but in Peking, all the places I had it served the black bean sauce in a bowl or a small dollop. The noodles were slick, not from oil, but the noodles had a sheen to them. The same is true in Korea. There is a toothiness to the noodle. At Shang, the sauce unfortunately is super salty, for my taste. I had to send it back and didn't request a replacement. I was told that the style at Shang was salty. If you've had black bean noodles elsewhere, it's really delicious and flavorful. A funky earthy taste with the soy black bean sauce. Anyway, I wouldn't order it if I went back. I think the sauce at China Ma Ma is actually better.

The pork and cabbage dumpling was very delicious. I'd definitely order that. The beef and onion pancake wasn't what I expected, It was more a dumpling than a pancake. I'm used to having pancakes where the dough is cooked as in layers and there's beef within it with onions. These were over a inch thick and about 2 inches round... definitely more like a fried bun. They were okay, but not as good as the pork and cabbage dumpling.

The Shang fried rice was good. Again a little salty for me. I think maybe the restaurant doesn't want to deal with folks asking for soy sauce... but having a lot of the salt really takes away from the flavor. It's Chinese food so there's a lot of oil, but to also have it really salty meant I probably won't go back.

I'm glad there are so many great reviews. Maybe I haven't tried enough dishes. I think it's inexpensive... Five dishes for about $40 so that's pretty cheap. 

It would be great if they tweaked some of their menu items. But hey, it's great to see that we have Artisan Noodles in Las Vegas.

The service on the other hand was great. The two servers worked hard to keep the busy spot running.",_qkI_vYa8ZtFCxMNTEyxjQ,0,1,3,CoGR2kn02LV4VC5jpQvuZg

4161082,2016-10-15,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Flipped between 4 and 5 stars about twenty times now... 

I first stumbled upon this place via Instagram. A new noodle shop in Vegas doesn't sound all that intriguing considering all the big name restaurants and buffets which... well, screams ""Vegas"". However, their display of commitment to their craft was enough to sway me. 

FIRST, a warning. Their water is watermelon infused... not THAT big of a deal but I dislike watermelon. If you're in the same boat, there's good old plain tap.

Hand pulled noodles, soups, dumplings... all of which I'm familiar with but GOD DAMN... their Beef Noodle soup is the best I've had thus far. The flavor of the broth... I can barely put into words, let alone keep myself from passing out. Strong beef flavor, spices/aromatics were well-balanced, all which led to an ideal, assertive soup. The hearty pieces of beef were very tender (thank god), the hand pulled noodles were great, the hidden pieces of bok Choy beneath the dark robust soup were pleasant... all of these components merging to a near-perfect singularity... I just passed out. 

All of this however, was after the initial revelation that is the Beef Pancake. As I said before, this was no stranger to me, BUT THE AMOUNT OF JUICE AND FLAVOR THAT POURED OUT of the little sucker.... it was like an episode of Food Wars: Shokugeki No Soma.... foodgasm x100, an explosion of all sorts of things and feels... clothes ripping off... exaggeration of course, but so legit nonetheless. The only negative critique that my friend and I both had was that it could have be crispier. There was only a modest size surface area which was pleasantly crunchy, but more would have been better.

We also had their spicy wontons and Dan Dan Noodles which were just okay. I've had better Dan Dan noodles elsewhere (lacking in the flavor department) and their spicy wontons needs a couple more tweaks to get onto Din Tai Fung's level... DTF is just too good. 

Regardless, the beef dishes made this 5 star happen.",FSdts-TifeFxj88NPtmwjA,4,0,5,meM9Yaf6SedlWYov89nG3w

I love their noodles, but as I get to try everything out, eventually I find my favorite or know what's the best for me.  I love their beef from Shang's Beef noodle, but I only love the clear broth (which only available with Beef shank order, but I don't like beef shank), so I asked the waitress if it's ok I have beef shang noodle meat but with clear broth like in the Beef shank one, she had done this for me before, and this time, she went and talk to the chef/owner Sam to see if it's possible to do it again, but to my surprise, chef immediately shake the head said ""no"", but I felt like the whole time, he doesn't bother to understand the question further, both waitress and I tried to explain to him, but he doesn't seems to get it at all, I told the waitress I'll just get something else, then she went back and talked to the chef again, she came out and said she'll be glad to do it for me again, but she already got the warning from chef/owner for doing this, REALLY? getting a warning for making customer happy? this is just NOT RIGHT! why would you give your employee an warning when all they want to do is make the food the way customer wanted, all they have to do is put in noodle, put in clear broth, and then shang beef meat on top of it(not to mention they are both the same price), I'm not even trying to be difficult, but the chef/owner made EVERYTHING difficult.  On top of that, the restaurant was so busy(but when we arrived there it wasn't busy at that time), with about 20 people and ONLY 1 waitress, I felt bad for the nice waitress, the restaurant clearly under staffed, it's employee abuse, she even corrected the chef couple of time when the chef made the mistake on the order, and she had to start asking for help because customers were not getting their order or they just seated themselves, because 1 waitress just can't handle 20 people at once (I don't blame her, I blame everything to the owner), I honestly think she should be the manager, or go somewhere else to work where they treat employee right.  This is unbelievable, they have lost another loyal customer, and many more, because I will share my experience with all my friends and will not recommend any of my friends there anymore.  Bye Shang! you had been good only when you fist open, and this is what happen when your ego gets too big, time to look for another noodle shop.

The menu is just large enough to have something for everyone- hot dishes, cold dishes, soups, noodles, fried rice, dumplings.

We started with the cucumber salad which wasn't the style which I was expecting it to be- no fault of theirs. I was thinking more along the lines of slightly pickled cucumbers with chili oil, but what came was medium sized sticks of cucumber drenched in creamy sesame sauce. It was a little heavier for my liking.

I ordered the hand pulled noodles with mushrooms and chicken. The mushrooms were a nice mix of at least three different toothsome varieties and they, along with the chicken, had a wonderful wok flavor to them. It made me very curious to try their fried rice, something I generally never order. While this dish was solid, and generous in size, I would rather try something else from the menu the next time I go. Given their super fresh nature, the noodles just didn't have enough chew for me, and I think I'd prefer the hand cut noodles more.

Overall, a solid option and I have respect for what they're doing but I'm not rushing to go back. There are other options in the same dining plaza which hold my heart captivated :)",Gap65780O9PI3Ui7Zj6Avw,5,6,4,9KhLll46eYtlTf_nY8sTvA

There are three types of noodles: hand pulled noodle, knife shaved noodles and plain noodles. The hand pulled and knife shaved are made fresh in the restaurant. The plain noodles are not. The hand pulled are your classic noodles, the knife shaved are thick gooey pieces. They recommend getting the broth noodles with the hand pulled and the sauce with the knife shaved. The knife shaved, however were not that great. They were too sticky and ended up being a thick mooshy thing at the bottom of the bowl. Be boring and get the hand pulled. 
They recommend Shiang beef noodles for broth based and the chicken mushroom noodles for the sauce based. Both were really, really good and not spicy. Again, get the hand pulled!

My highlight for this restaurant was how flavorful and high quality their food was. 

I started with the recommended beef cake. Full of flavor and tender, must use their sauce for beef cake. Please order prior to your entree as It takes longer to make. 

Shang beef noodle was phenomenal. Broth was a 20/10 if I could mark It that high. Full of rich flavor and deep red color. The beef was tender and had bits of fat to add to the complexity of the soup. Not too fatty and everything was melt in your mouth.

Please wear a dark colored shirt if you choose beef broth soup here I stained my white shirt with my novice noodle eating skills lol. 

You have 3 options for your noodles.

Knife sliced - thick and chewy 
Skinny - spaghetti like
Original - thicker but soft

I came here in the middle of the afternoon looking for a hearty meal and thanks to my LV buddies Nelson Q., Philip T., Chris V. and Rod U. (HI), I trusted my gut to them and explored this highly sought after venue.  

The menu was simple: appetizers, noodle soup, noodle sauce, fried rice and chow mein. But come here for the show stopper - the homemade noodles.

Since I was eating alone, I chose the ""Chicken and Mushroom Noodle"" with knife shaved noodles ($8.49). This bowl was filled with four kinds of earthy mushrooms, shredded chicken and four mini bok choy stalks with a brown gravy mixed into the toppings. Underneath, the knife shaved noodles was a thick and wavy long noodle which had a perfect al dente bite. After a quick mix of the toppings and noodles, it soon became a bowl of unami flavor which I couldn't put my chopsticks down. Each bite had the sauce completely coated onto the noodle which made the experience intoxicating and pleasurable. Be sure to ask for their chili which adds a great kick of spice.

Quick tip: I highly suggest ordering the knife shaved noodles with the ""sauces"" while saving the hand pulled noodles for the soups. 

This restaurant is small and has a more contemporary feel. I sat in front of the kitchen as the chef was meticulously folding the dumplings for the dinner crowd. The service was extremely fast and friendly.

We had the beef pancake which was delicious.  It was very similar to a circular flattened beef dumpling, crispy and golden brown on flat top and bottom.  There was a really lovely delicious soupy quality to them so it was best to take a small bite from the side and suck out the delicious hot juices that reside inside.  The chili paste provided at the table had a delicate cinnamon flavor that brought out the flavors of the dumpling.  We saw a table who had gotten the other types of dumplings offered and those looked amazing as well.
   I was so excited to try the ramen with all the wonderful flavors that you could smell in the air and the sound of the noodles being slapped around in the background as they were pulled.  We ordered the Beef Shank Ramen and the Pork Belly Ramen, both with pulled noodles.  I must say the Shank wasn't my favorite.  It was bland with little dimension to the broth or meat.  I was hoping for a dark beef broth soup with deep flavor, but instead got a nearly clear broth with a very chewy few pieces of meat.  Retrospectively I would like to have done some additions which they list of their menu.
     The Pork Belly Ramen was a different story.  The Belly was roasted so nicely and not oily.  The broth had a more complex and deep flavor to it that complimented the broth perfectly.  Had I just had the pork belly by itself it would have been missing something but the delicate noodles, with the star anise and rich flavor of the broth, and slight bitterness of the bok choy was a lovely.  Very reasonably priced as well.  I again wish we would have done some additions though.  
    All in all the wait staff was incredibly welcoming and nice.  The prices were very reasonable. The restaurant was clean and fresh looking. But I would have liked some recommendations on additions or some chefs suggestions of additions to go with each bowl of ramen, and wasn't impressed with the Beef Shank Ramen.   It was a great stop and I am very glad we stopped in for lunch.",C2_fFhF1RWF1VhpWJIVfgA,0,0,4,7eOyPR15vhe72_ydeJ7EYQ
4331586,2017-10-16,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I had this place bookmarked for the longest. I don't usually venture to this side of town but I decided to give it a try anyway. 

Just an FYI - Parking sucks, not the restaurant's fault but it's very limited.

For starters, I asked for a water to drink. The waitress brings out what looks like water, but after the first sip (which I almost spit back into the cup because it grossed me out) I realized it was an infused water. I remembered another yelper posting a pic of their water which was very obvious that it had pieces of watermelon in it to show that it was infused.  Mine tasted more like it was infused with only the skin part of the watermelon. Gross. You've been warned.

The cucumber appetizer had a nice sesame based sauce to it with a very light drizzle of chili oil, but the way they have it stacked - the bottom pieces didn't have any flavor at all. It would have been better if the cucumbers were at least lightly pickled or marinated. Very bland.

Beef pancakes were good, they took 15min to make (and they did tell us) but came out nice and hot. They are very very juicy - seasoned just right. Dough is a little thick but this is typical. 

Beef shank - soup base was very bland.  It was a very light white colored broth. It was literally 5 pieces of beef shank, some noodles and a pile of green onions.

Beef brisket - (I stole some of my wife's soup since mine was so boring) soup base was much better, had a darker red color with a little kick to it. But still dressed up with only some green onions.

I'll tell you where the was place really good, and that's their hand shaved noodles - the texture of the noodles with the intentional imperfect cuts was really great. It's just a shame that I had to use 3 spoonfuls of hot sauce to give my soup some flavor.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again.",wgjJscOfwun1jozTFPCRLg,1,1,3,g25WAvaP8Sci9dNuGXwHIg

The outer appearance may seem like its dry but these pancakes are crunchy on the outside with flavorful beef and soup on the inside. For our entrees, we got the Shang Beef with hand pulled noodles and Pork Belly with hand pulled noodles. All the components in the shang beef was really put together. The beef was tender and the broth is not too light nor too rich. I believe you can also adjust how spicy you would like the broth to be. I wasn't a big fan of the pork belly because the cut of the pork was just too big and overly fatty. I'm a big fan of pork belly but this was one was just a little too much for me. 

Another bonus is that not only is this place clean, the staff is amazing! Our waiter was nice and the service was prompt and fast.

We got our food to go since we did not look very presentable after engaging with the great outdoors as vigorously as we had.  I got the braised beef soup with hand pulled noodles, and my boyfriend got the pork rib soup with hand pulled noodles.  We also got an order of the chilli wontons.  The most expensive item on the menu was like 9.95

First of all the portions were on the smaller end than I'm used to, and that included how much meat was included.  I only had 3 chunks of beef that were largely fat... The noodles were fine nothing earth shattering.  The broth had decent flavor, but I've had more evolved broth.  I wouldn't say my boyfriends pork ribs were super tender but overall the soup had good flavor. We enjoyed the baby bok choy in both.  The wontons themselves were wonderfully made, but the sauce was lacking, it was red but I didn't see all the chilli I'm used to, and the flavor was pretty one note.

I  will say I appreciated how well they boxed our to go items.

My friend and I both started with the tea which is a house blend. We really liked the flavor. For a starter we shared the Spicy Wonton appetizer. The homemade noodles definitely stood out on this dish. The wonton was delicate and the flavor was perfection. The spice level was perfect. 

I had the Shang Beef Noodle Soup with knife-shaved noodles. My friend went with the Pork Belly Noodle Soup with hand-pulled noodles. The hand-pulled noodles resembled udon noodles while the knife-shaved noodles were thicker and wider. Both were delicious! My Beef Noodle Soup was a great dish. Everything in the soup tasted fresh and there were generous amounts of noodles and beef. The bok choy, cilantro, and green onion were delicious with the noodles and beef. There was enough to save for lunch the next day. 

The inside of the restaurant is very clean and the décor is minimal. All seating options allow for watching the food being prepared. Seating options include tables and counter seating next to the kitchen. Pricing is more than reasonable for the quality and fresh nature of the food. 

Our server was excellent. He was great with answering questions and took great care of us. As the night went on the restaurant filled quickly, but he kept up with everyone well. Most importantly, he made sure our delicious tea never ran out.

The restaurant is a little small, I think I saw around 6 two-seater tables and 10 bar seats.  Luckily, the bar was open, so my boyfriend and I was able to snag a spot with ease.  

Our server Pita recommended a number of items, right off the bat.  She was very helpful!  We ended up going with the Dan Dan Noodles, Shang Beef Noodle, and Spicy Wontons and Beef Pancakes to share.  

Spicy Wontons - comes with around 10 wontons, but be warned that they are tiny!  I was under the impression from pictures that the wontons were bigger, but that's where the tiny soup bowl comes in.  I liked the flavor!  They used some of those Sichuan peppes in the sauce to give it that tingly feeling.  Tingly, but not overpowering. 

Beef Pancakes - we were warned beforehand that it takes an extra 10 minutes to come out.  I would say these were worth the wait.  The pancakes are shaped like scallops!  The outside was nice and crispy, and the beef inside was tasty.  It pairs well with the dipping sauce and chili oil on the table.  

Dan Dan Noodle - noodles on a bed of minced pork and a spicy soy sauce.  A very simple, but flavorful dish.  My boyfriend added more chili oil to it and I enjoyed it more with that extra kick!  

Shang Beef Noodle - braised beef noodle soup with bok choy.  My boyfriend waited quite a while to enjoy his food because my soup hadn't come out.  When it finally did come out, I noticed the beef wasn't tender, the soup was a bit sweet and had no depth of flavor, and the broth was just warm.  For their namesake dish, I expected more.  I would not order this next time. 

Cucumber Salad - comes with A LOT of cucumbers with a sesame sauce, some chili oil, and sesame seeds on top.  Very light and refreshing!  It pairs nicely with all the oily and fried food we ate. 

All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Shangs.  I loved watching the noodle man pull noodles so happily in front of us.  The servers are very attentive and helpful.  And for the most part, I enjoyed the food.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,13,13,4,AFRx3PiPLNcpyRpCCegajA

The space was unassuming from the outside, bright, clean, open and well put together on the inside.

Most notably the ""hand pulled"" and ""knife cut"" options for your noodles.

The inside is small but bright and inviting. Light wooden decor in every direction and a few tables and bar seating where you're able to watch the art of handmade noodles in action.

The menu is small (a two sided menu) but there are solid choices all at decent prices:

- Cucumber Salad ($4.95)
Cucumbers sliced vertically with a heaping mound of thick sesame sauce on top. The sauce was a bit much for me, although flavorful taste wise. I would prefer a light sauce/dressing on cucumbers but this sauce was too heavy and creamy. My friend didn't seem to mind, he thought there was a hint of peanut in it

- Spicy Wontons ($5.49)
Heavenly. Silky Pork wontons doused in a spicy oil, topped with sesame seeds, black pepper, and chopped green onions. I thoroughly enjoyed the heat and taste of the spicy oil. Easily the best dish we ordered!

- Shang Beef Noodle ($8.95)
Savory, piping hot bowl of noodle soup. Very hearty broth - you can tell that meat has been simmering in their broth for quite some time. I got the knife shaved noodles which was a great decision! Totally can taste the difference in the noodles and it's 100% fresh. So delicious! The braised beef brisket had some extra fatty parts but the non fatty parts were both tender and flavorful 

There were two ladies working as servers and they were both polite and filled our waters when empty. Food came out at reasonable times and service was pretty decent. Nothing over the top spectacular but no complaints either. 

My friend got the Pork Belly Noodle and he loved it. He said he personally was a fan of the flavor of the broth and the texture of the noodles! I could really tell that he enjoyed every bite of his noodle soup.

I will definitely come back and look forward to trying another noodle dish. I'll be sure to order the Spicy Wontons again!!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,11,7,4,qz-1tfHmcbxdv2adJlZarQ

Spicy wonton was awesome. A good spicy without the after taste spicy.  Subtle sweetness was truly savoring.  

I thought the beef pancake was ok.  Most beef pancakes contain good amount of soup juice when you bite into it.  The ones here weren't as juicy as expected.

Spicy Wonton
Chili oil.  Lots of it.  If you order this, I recommend you eat this quickly because parts of it is crispy (well done!).  If you leave it in the oil for too long, it'll diminish this crispy texture which may not be desirable.  This is a great appetizer, but I personally thought it was a bit too heavy, especially in preparation for the main entree.

Shang Beef Noodle
Beef brisket is really soft and breaks very easily.  Not an iota of roughness.  Simply delectable and goes very well with the broth and the noodles.  

For the noodles, you can opt for either hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or plain noodle.  I've had the opportunity to try both the hand-pulled and knife-shaved.  Knife-shaved is thicker, less consistent in texture, and chewier.  The dough seem to leave a lasting impression in your mouth and seem to balance the broth's rich flavor.  For the hand-pulled noodle, it's definitely easier to bite and enjoy, with less of the dough flavor and more of the broth, if you like that kinda thing.  I definitely prefer the hand-pulled more, but my fiancee loved the knife-shaved (we switched bowls)...or maybe it just tastes better when it's not coming from your own bowl...  

Regardless of the noodle choices, this place is definitely delectable with a very reasonable price point that gets my nod of approval.",2RrrZhtUgOZ7hfgvDow_xA,0,0,5,yiX_MBYKSi1PgVZ3i0Yc4g

We opted to sit at the bar to watch the noodle pullers (is that right term?) and were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. We ordered the spicy wontons as an appetizer and both of us elected to have the beefy noodle soup with hand-pulled noodles. 

YUM. The spicy wontons were really small, but the sauce was delicious and we gobbled them up very quickly. My mom's  a super picky eater and, owning a restaurant herself, is definitely an Asian food snob, but she really enjoyed the wontons. Our noodle soups came next and they definitely didn't disappoint. The noodles, although hand-pulled, were consistently chewy. The broth was rich and flavorful. The beef was so tender it seemed as though it had been cooking all day. The bokchoy was a welcoming relief of freshness to the dish as well. By the time we were eating, there was a line to get into the restaurant!

Overall, it was so delicious and if I'm back in Vegas, I will definitely come back to Shang's.",SGlB4O-RtNlUIXJQBVf29Q,1,0,5,OvRUZJDIjjZM-691nGzgHQ
4581951,2018-02-05,3,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Recently Shang Artisan Noodle was recommended to me by a friend, so we decided to check it out. The reviews on Yelp are almost too good to be true. I mean... beef noodle soup? How can it be that good? At first I was a little hesitant to try because the pictures made it look just alright however boy I was wrong. We came here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was a bit crowded however we only waited for 5 minutes. It's a small place however reminds me of the ramen shops back home. 

Menu consists of different types of dumplings, noodle soups, and more. First, they make their own noodles in house. If you order any of the noodle soups, you can choose how the noodles are cooked. There's three different ways: hand pulled, knife shaved, and normal. I have no idea what the difference was however the previous reviews suggest knife shaved. We decided to get the Shang beef noodle soup and spicy wontons. The spicy wontons come in 10 small pieces 

We received our food quick! The pictures made the bowls look small however it was a regular sized bowl that ramen is served in. The broth.... the BROTH! I have never had anything like it. The beef makes the broth so rich and tasty. The noodles were similar to chow fun noodles however had very edged and not perfect cuts. It's was really delicious! I would recommend getting that cut. The spicy wontons were good as well. It's really spicy! There's a dipping sauce where you can add to help the heat but also add dimensional flavor. 

Overall it was great to try something new! I just wished we had something like this back home. There's noodles are well made and tasty. The broth is delicious... what more can I say? Just try it out. Also we weren't expecting for our water to be cucumber lemon water. It caught us off guard but we appreciated it! Yum. Pricing is reasonable. All dishes are less than $10. They don't have a dessert menu but there's a lot of dessert places in the area. We're coming back the next time we're in town!",8wBRbKWFnkGe49b-47QyIw,6,6,5,se7bNAvhp0x6zZA4l6INeg

I asked her if it was dandan mien since it didn't have any peanut taste and she said that it was. Maybe they make dandan mien differently where they came from but I'm not a fan. I also tried some of their Shang beef noodle and it's pretty good but it also tasted a lot like a Taiwanese instant beef noodle cup ramen that I used to have when I was young. They also flipped the potstickers upside down for presentation I suppose but all the precious juices inside flowed out since they either didn't seal them well or punctured them in the flipping process.

Beef noodle flavor and broth was great but I would've loved some pickle on the side as it traditionally has. Potsticker and beef pancake weren't too exciting. The pancake was a little too doughy for my taste. Like I said, I had high expectations and I've definitely had better.

Ordered to-go here. Flavor was good. Ordered 2 kinds of noodles. Chicken mushroom with hand pulled noodles (chow mein type) & the egg tomato with knife cut noodle (flat). I suggest to just stick to the hand pulled one if u do take out. Because by the time we got back to the hotel (half hr later), the flat one turned into a clump of dough. I could imagine it woulda been more separated & actually looked like noodles if I had eaten it right then & there in a bowl. The hand pulled one stayed separated. Other than that, the flavors were great. I also ordered the beef pancakes, fried pork dumplings & fried beef dumplings. The beef dumplings & beef pancakes were pretty much the same. Just different shapes. I preferred the pancakes though cuz it's more fried due to the shape. 

DECOR: 5/5
Clean & modern. Love that we can watch them make prep & cook right there. It's a little too hipster looking for me though.

SERVICE: 4/5
The girl taking the order walked around with her lil tablet. Wasn't like super friendly. She just seemed like a robot. The guy Latin guy with the green eyes making the pulling the noodle was nice about me taping him pulling the noodles. Please just be respectful & ask them if u can tape them. It's so rude when ppl just start video taping  or taking pictures without that person's consent. 

Prices weren't too bad. I have to admit, when I first found this place on yelp, I wasn't sure I wanted to try it cuz the pictures & name of the restaurant looked & sounded way too hipster ish for me. I thought it was gonna be some fancy schmancy small portion dishes for an arm & a leg. But I decided to try it for the hand made noodles & I'm glad I did. The portions were bigger than I expected for the price they charge. They exceeded my expectations. The only thing that's hipster stuck up ish about this place was the robotic hostess/server. She wasn't rude or anything & answered my questions. She just needs to crack a smile & act a little more personal. This isn't some exclusive rich club or party. Reminded me of those ppl in movies working at some hip exclusive restaurants.",vyOEbCUcq8Nwfmr4tO_cDQ,0,0,4,AQj2Ia9HKyIwoRLf2-9E9Q
4656417,2016-11-05,2,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I really really wanted to like Shang's but they are just missing....something. All of the dishes lacked flavor and I had to keep on reaching for the hot sauce (not that hot) and vinegar at an alarming rate. 

Spicy wonton - Not spicy at all, quite bland and watered down to be honest. Their sauce was not thick and tangy compared to other ???? I've had in my lifetime. 

Beef noodle soup with hand pulled noodles - Also bland, but I think it is just the variety of beef noodle soup. I prefer a Taiwanese version with pickled mustard greens and a richer deeper broth.  This just wasn't it. 

Dan dan noodles - This was not a peanut based sauce and was more like a Zha Jiang mian. I tried a bite and thought it was actually very flavorful but I'm not sure if I'd feel the same after a whole bowl. 

A stand out item was their beef pancake which was carefully made in front of our eyes. We watched the gentleman roll out the dough and wrap the pancakes with precision made to order. The filling was hot, juicy, and savory. 

The waitresses overall were very sweet although you could tell they were a bit understaffed for the evening. Noodles were fresh and constantly being made which looked exhausting.

Our server was nice but she was the only server on the shift. Although the restaurant isn't big at all, the place was almost full. We never got water refills or never got checked up on. 

I ordered the shang beef noodle. Asked if they can make it spicy and was told to use the sauce on the table. The beef and noodles were really good but the soup itself was not hot at all. The sauce provided on the table did not make the soup much spicy either and slowly dissipated the actual soup flavor. The noodles came out within 5-6 minutes so I wondered how they prepare it since the soup wasn't even hot at all. 

I also ordered the beef pancake appetizer. I thought our server forgot the order since it wouldn't come out even after I finished my noodle. I asked our server to check up on it and she told us that it takes awhile so it usually comes out in between your meal. She should've warned us about that when we placed the order because we wanted the pancakes as an appetizer, not as a dessert...

There are three types of noodles that you may choose when ordering any of their noodle dishes; Knife-Shaved, Hand-Pulled, or Plain. I'm not familiar with Plain, but I like both of the other options.

Spicy Wonton ($5.49)
Beef Pancake ($5.49)
Shang Beef Noodle ($8.95)
Dan-Dan Noodle ($7.99)
Chicken Sesame Cold Noodle ($7.99)
Chicken & Mushroom Noodle ($8.49)
Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle ($8.49)
Shang Fried Rice ($7.99)

So far, my favorites are the Spicy Wonton, Beef Pancake, Shang Beef Noodle, Chicken & Mushroom Noodle, and Shang Fried Rice.

The Spicy Wonton are small delicious dumplings in a flavorful spicy soy sauce. What I really love about this dish, besides being tasty, is that it's not overly spicy. The sauce is really quite fantastic and goes well with so many of their other dishes!

I love the broth in the Shang Beef Noodle; it's rich and flavorful and the braised beef brisket is so incredibly tender. I had this soup with the knife-shaved noodles and it was perfection. I love the chewiness of the knife-shaved noodles and it's supported well with a broth rather than a sauce (it needs the additional moisture).

Another noodle dish I enjoyed is the Chicken & Mushroom Noodle. I appreciated how saucy it was since I wanted to pair it with the knife-shaved noodles. We added the sauce from the Spicy Wonton and it was so, so good!

I haven't tried their other rice dishes yet, but I really like the Shang Fried Rice because they use preserved bean sprouts and minced pork and these ingredients lend a wonderfully unique flavor.

I didn't love the Chicken Sesame Cold Noodle or the Peking Zha-Jiang Noodle. Both have rather viscous sauces and didn't work well with the hand-pulled or knife-shaved noodles. It needed more liquid or simply more sauce for better coverage. Also, flavor-wise, it was okay.

It is a small space, so get here early for lunch or expect a short wait (especially for larger groups). Service is fantastic and it's always an exciting experience since you have the ability to watch the chefs pull noodles, shave noodles, etc.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,10,6,4,5EqZlFoBadtybYMBGnOQSA

Cucumber salad $4.95 ( not a fan the sesame seed sauce over powder everything) 
Pork and cabbage pot stickers $5.49 ( so worth it! Takes 15 minutes to make after ordering. Hot juicy and not dry! ) 
Shang beef noodle with the knife cut noodle $8.95 ( did think it made much flavor was my least fav) 
Pork belly noodle with knife cut noddle $8.95 ( so good! Pork could have been more tender, but the broth was good and the knife cut soaked the flavors from the broth compared to the hand pull noddles)

i was seriously tempted to order everything on the menu but decided on the dan-dan noodles: knife-sliced noodles (thicker & wider than their hand-pulled counterpart) topped with minced pork, bean sprout, and spicy soy sauce. it was absolutely delicious!

also ordered the pork & cabbage potstickers and the presentation was so cute. they looked like a little flower, all stuck together and clearly pan fried to perfection.

the spicy wonton appetizer was impressive, the dough was very thin and delicate. the meat pancakes were good but we made the mistake of trying to shove them into our mouths, and had juice fly out of them upon first bite. so just make sure to cut into them first.

Dan Dan Noodle - Chose hand-pulled noodle style. Wish there was more sauce, thought it was on the dry side. Looked plain but had a good kick to it. Added bok choy to this dish but it was under cooked a bit. 
 
Shàng Beef Noodle - Chose knife-shaved noodle style. Brisket was tender, bok choy was cooked perfectly. The broth was sweeter than expected but had a decent flavor. 

Yang-Zhou Fried Rice - Good mix of ingredients. Rice was fluffy and is a good shared plate for 2-3 people.


Overall the food tasted fresh and clean. Atmosphere was welcoming and temperature was fine. Music could have been louder.

Highly recommended to any soup and dumpling loving foodies that appreciate passion, talent and tons of flavor being put into their meal. 

This tiny spot seats about 20 total in the restaurant and probably another dozen up at the bar facing the open concept kitchen.  This is where you can watch the noodle magic happen, as they hand toss and pull and even knife cut (if you so desire) their Artisan noodles. Who knew creating noodles could be such an art form?

I ordered the seafood soup with the hand pulled noodles which I really enjoyed. The light, savory broth blew me away with a wonderful flavor that I haven't really tasted before. A generous helping of shrimp, fish cake and squid rounded out the dish. Hubby had the braised beef soup with the knife cut noodle. Very rich and savory broth, and the knife cut noodles were a bit thicker and had a great chew to them. The pork and cabbage potstickers were a visual delight (see photos-- almost too pretty to eat), but to be honest I was a bit underwhelmed on the flavor. Looking at the dish your expectations are incredibly high, so I was disappointed that the flavor wasn't as impressive as the presentation.

4865856,2017-12-30,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Amazing hand pulled noodles! We came on a weekday for lunch, and the restaurant is a small spot with only a few seats. The restaurant is super modern looking, and the chefs are seen making noodles from the window. That afternoon, we had to wait around 30 minutes for a table of four, but the line moved really fast. 

When seated, we ordered two Shang beef noodles, with knife cut and hand pulled noodles, pork rib noodles, and pork belly noodles. The beef stew was super tender, and I loved the slightly spicy flavor of the soup. The noodles were chewy, and you could taste the hand-pulled consistency. It was a pretty good serving size, and I couldn't even finish all of my noodles. 

We also ordered the beef and onion potstickers and the pork and cabbage potstickers. I preferred the beef potstickers, but both were deliciously crispy and had a layer of crispy dough on the bottom. They provided a sweet and sour-like soy sauce for dipping, which complimented the potstickers well. 

I would highly recommend this place if you're in Las Vegas, even though it is a bit of a distance off the strip, but for the reasonable prices and quality of food, I would definitely come back!",wDGhHOvTTSoui8H0R5K80A,5,2,5,AbMqCieknQlkP-OImEKSig

One thing you'll notice coming here is how clean and the decor of this place.  Very modern.  They also serve you infused cucumber water!  Huge plus for the dry climate in Las Vegas.  The service is excellent here, you can't complain when a place refills your water without you asking. 

We had two appetizer.  Spicy wonton, my husband really likes it.  Cucumber salad....it had a weird sesame drizzle sauce on it...it was WEIRD TASTING!  Don't order it.  LOL, I was craving The Noodle Man's cucumber salad.
 
Our noodle soups.  We're a big fan of their knife-shaved noodles.  We've tried the other two types of noodles.   They're great, but the texture of the knife-shaved noodles is very unique, never had that before.  I ordered the Beef Shank Noodle and Seafood Noodle.  They don't use any soy product in the broth.  Both broth super tasty, very clean with the texture of the knife-shaved noodle.  I just can't remember if the use the same broth or if they were different.  My husband ordered Shang Beef Noodle, Pork Belly Noodle, and Dan-Dan Noodles.  He really liked all of them.  He's a big fan of their Dan-Dan Noodles.  

Another thing I couldn't forget was their hot tea.  It was so tasty, the pleasant roasted flavor was what got me.  I am super happy, I did a little investigation and found it without having to call and ask them what tea was.  I purchased 50 sachets.  =)",MMxRLgkd-MgwowmggmR2Dg,2,2,5,LZteNN46aCBAu6yQuVZZlw

Yes. 

YASSSSSS

This place is legit and so modern in design. Love the counter where you can sit and watch them make the noodles by hand, drop it into the water, and plated to you. 

The food came out FAST! 

The real highlight is the noodles and how fresh it is. Not frozen. The sauces and ""toppings"" are all pretty standard. 

We got the Dan Dan Noodles with Hand Pulled noodles. Texture was al dente just how I love it. The Dan Dan sauce was too salty for mine likings. I love a good Sichuan Dan Dan noodle and these were more Northern style. Still good though. 

The Peking Zha Jiang Mian was delicious. Absolutely my favorite. I got the thick cut noodles. Carbs overload but so worth it. The black bean sauce and the bean sprouts, cucumbers, carrots, beans... all just came together so well. 

The Spicy Wontons were a miss for me. Soggy and too oily. 

The ""pancake"" or ""bing"" is actually really good. The style is like a pot stickers but round. It is a tad greasy but this dish is like that. Everywhere you go it is like this. 

Prices were great. I enjoyed it.",7Sq9MNNDseNy9AobzAms3A,1,0,4,O8Lny0Ws86rEojvJmIcgug

* BEEF NOODLE SOUP - 5 stars: The beef noodle soup was amazing, I LOVED the noodles. They are smooth and chewy and so delicious. Better than my favorite, Liang's! I preferred the beef noodle soup broth over the pork broth but enjoyed how fatty the pieces of pork were. The wide noodles are much better than the thin.
* JIAJIANG NOODLES - 5 stars: If you like jiajiang mian, you will love this black bean noodle dish.
* SPICY WONTONS - 3.5 stars: Decent spicy wontons but nothing compared to the delicious ones at Din Tai Fung. 
* POTSTICKERS - 2.5 stars: They look amazing because they come out as a single piece, similar to DTF, but they were bland and overly oily tasting.
* BEEF PANCAKE ROLLS - 2.5 stars: These came out scalding hot and fresh, but unfortunately they were so oily and bland, very similar to the potstickers. The beef inside was disappointing.

Shang is worth the trek off strip if you're craving noodles, definitely get the famous wide hand-shaved noodles (better than the original thin) and stick with the beef noodle soup or jia jiang mian!",5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ,4,4,4,HMyKqKxdHiLFSeTgDgeK2A

When we arrived on a weekday night, there were only 2 tables occupied. Our server greeted us quickly, broughtus menus and checked back in minutes to take our order. 

We had: 

Peking wontons with knife cut noodles. The noodles were chewy, great texture in a nice light broth, but the wontons were the smallest I've ever seen. They were mostly wonton skin with very little filling, maybe the size of a dime. 

Shang beef noodle soup w/ hanf pulled noodles. Great flavor with tender pieces of beef. Some had chunks of fat, some were leaner. Broth was good but noodles were lacking. It's about 1/2 of theportion of what I normally get with an order. The menu listed an extra order of noodles for $1.5. Being from SoCal surrounded by Chinese noodle joints, at first I wondered why it was even offered, but quickly realized I needed it. 

The service was very pleasant and fast. The place is clean, well lit and has an open kitchen where customers who sit at the counter can witness the chef working the hand made noodles.
We enjoyed our 2 orders and it hit the spot in satisfying the need for something warm and soupy, but couldn't help comparing it to the dozens of places in the San Gabriel Valley that also serve up really tasty noodles at a bigger portion and better prices. 

Yes, I do recommend a visit here. Great texture of noodles, great service and great flavor. Even though I'm surrounded by places that will give Shang Artisan Noodles a run for its money, I'm not ruling them out just yet.

The hand-pulled noodles are a great blend of soft and chewy. Friend had the knife-shaved noodles and these were more chewy than the hand-pulled. Hand pulled texture was between that of Udon and Ramen. The shang beef brisket was cut in wholesome, lean chunks in the soup. Soup has bockchoy and green onions. I will definitely come back again.

The last time I went I got to try the dan Dan noodles and the beef pancakes. The beef pancake is more like a beef crispy bun.

I ordered the hand-pulled noodles with pork ribs. The noodle portion was extremely generous at $10. The texture was springy and chewy while being fully cooked through. Honestly, this is the texture I wanted from the pasta I had in Rome (which turned out to basically just be raw.) These noodles are a joyous experience to eat. 

The noodles absorbed the lightly unctuous pork broth. The fresh chives added bitterness and crisp texture. The bok choy was hearty and pleasantly fresh. 

The pork was admittedly just slightly dry on the bite. However, it was close to being perfect in execution. The mouthfeel of the pork was fall-apart.

The rest of the stuff we ordered was a thumbs down unfortunately. The spicy wonton was NOT spicy but sour and otherwise lacked flavor--I actually didn't even taste the filling. The pork and cabbage potstickers were totally bland too with the dumpling wrap being a little on the thicker side. The cumber salad was plentiful but it consisted of fresh cucumbers that they drizzled with a thick,  bland (again) sesame/?peanut paste that did not suit my taste buds at all.

5095012,2016-11-09,25,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"""Eat Rice, Drink Tea, Slurp Noodles, Stay Asian""  Plagiarized (hey it's all the rage), from Vegas yelper and Asian food guru Tony T; visions of Shang Artisan Noodle come dancing in.

Two things to remember; (1) hand pulled noodles and (2) knife cut noodles.  Both very good, with well developed gluten, very toothsome, studded with surface imperfections that grip hold of broths and sauces making them slurpably delicious.   Better still, they are made in front of you in the fishbowl kitchen to order.  Good food and a show all in one.

Ordering simple.  Select a noodle (hand pulled, knife shaved, or plain machine made zzzz), select a soup or sauce base.  Done.

For soup bases, the Shang beef noodle, beefy with a strong anise and earthy spice flavors.  Not too heavily extracted (some gelatin but not lip coating). Generous portion of well braised brisket.   The pork belly, a gently sweetened pork and chicken broth with light extraction (no silky collagen), hints of earthy soy, good mixed Asian spice punch, with tender, not too fatty braised pork belly.  

Sauce noodle dishes, are very strong and border on salty.  Generosity is nice but... The Dan-Dan noodles (sautéed minced pork and bean sprouts in a spicy, thick soy sauce) packs a flavor punch.  Nice earthy, fermented backbone balancing the heat but just too much sauce.  The spicy chicken sesame cold noodle (shredded chicken breast, mixed veg in a spicy sesame sauce) very flavorful but salty.  An extra order of noodles ($1.50) for both made the flavors much better.

OK  starters.  The pork and cabbage pot sticker well made with a crisp, well fried outer layer and light filling, agreeable.  The spicy wontons, slightly overcooked and too soft.  Not very spicy.  

Inexpensive.  All dishes below $9.

Asian service.  No complaints.

In the end, sufficiently authentic dishes for the purist and enough menu diversity to keep the adventurous non Asian foodie happy.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,32,29,4,E9qUjOxq5sRXbIW-YssnXw
5097965,2016-11-27,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"This new restaurant has tons of potential, pleasant setup and very warm/inviting environment for a great meal.

I really like the open air concept where you can see the kitchen prepare your meal and to showcase their noodle making skills.  This is much like the pizzeria tossing the pizza dough in the air.

Almost all dishes are around $8 range and quite affordable with decent portions.  You can order extra noodles for just over a buck more and is worth it if you hungry.

The beef shang noodles hand cut was the best dish we had for the night.  The beef was extremely tender and the broth had a very deep beef flavor.  The hand cut noodles was more evenly cut than I thought, so we'll try the knife cut it next.  Noodles were cooked perfectly.

The spicy won tun appetizer was a bit too sweet and not much of a spicy flavor.  This was so so.

The dan dan noodles again was a bit too sweet and wasn't much of a spicy flavor.  Their version doesn't have a peanut component.

I would recommend to explore their menu to find your favorites.",tw1YfWwGJffPlUNTl_w1fw,5,4,4,OzDRtcpNpe9on2VxoRKajg

The spicy wontons was a little of the small portion size but there was a nice dusting of sichuan peppercorn dust on them.

For my main dish I had the braised pork rib soup with the hand pulled noodles. It was amazing! My husband had the chicken and mushroom sauce noodles. When the portions came out my initial thought was that I might need another portion of noodles but ended up leaving full and happy. :) 
The service is amazing. Steven gave us perfect details of the differences between all the noodle options (plain, hand pulled, or knife shaved.).

The really cool and unique thing about this place is that they make their noodles fresh! They actually showcase themselves hand pull and cutting their noodles it's pretty awesome. 

The very first time I came we had a party of 4 and ordered the beef noodle soup, the dan dan noodles and the seafood noodle soup. Of all of them my favorite was the beef noodle soup. They had a really flavorful but not overly salty broth. My dad ordered the knife cut noodles and I got the hand pulled one. I personally prefer the hand pulled noodles because they're thinner and are better at soaking up the broth but if you're into thick cut noodles I'd recommend the knife cut. Back to the soup: their beef is so tender it almost melts in your mouth but it just has enough texture to it. My mom got the dan dan noodles which she said was just okay and my girlfriend tried their seafood soup. She really enjoyed her seafood soup along with all the actual seafood in the soup.

Personally the only time I eat noodles, if and when, I'll grab a pack of chicken flavor top ramen. I'm not big on the authentic Asian noodle cuisine. However, I do love me some pho. Anyways since I was in the mood to try something new we came by. The promo on their Instagram was worded incorrectly according to our awesome and super friendly server. They did bring a taster of their Dan Dan noodle to our table that my friend ate. Hence, I don't eat pork. She did enjoy her mini sampler however. The server stated it was one of their popular dishes like a few of the reviews have noted. I got the beef shank with a side of their chili paste. The chili paste was delicious!!! Also, I ordered the beef and onion pot stickers. The texture of the meat inside the pot stickers didn't do it for me. My friend order their chili wontons with pork and she enjoyed it very much. She highly recommended it. I love the concept of the open kitchen with the view of the chef make fresh noodles right before your eyes. This is my second and third time giving noodles a try. Well folks everything isn't for everyone. The water infused with watermelon was unique too but I like my water with lemon. I guess there was no pleasing me but my friend rated them a 4 out of 5!

 - Sunday night dinner for party of 4. There was no wait but the counter/bar was the only open seating, which was fine with us since we wanted to see the noodle being made. 

LOCATION/INTERIOR:
 - located in the Flamingo Decatur Plaza (off strip).
 - parking is pretty limited in the center but didn't have a problem finding a spot.
 - restrooms are very clean and have separate ones for men and women.

ORDER & TASTE:
* For noodle dishes you can choose: hand-pulled noodles (longer and thin), knife-shaved noodles (more short, wide, and chewy), or plain noodle. 
 - Dan Dan Noodle with hand-pulled noodles ($7.99): liked it but was slightly saltier than I would have liked it. On the menu it says hot for the dis being spicy. It had a kick to it as I kept on eating it. It will depend on your tolerant if you think it's spicy or not.
 - Beef Shank Noodle with knife-shaved noodles ($8.95): the soup is very light and simpler, I liked the soup flavor, more of a simple flavor, but would have liked the soup a little more (temperature) hot.
 - Pork Belly Noodle with knife-shaved noodles ($8.95): I thought some of the pork belly was slight more dry but overall it was good. The soup is dark and is more the typical ""beef noodle soup"". Was good. 
 - Cucumber Salad ($4.95): this is a plate of cucumbers with sesame sauce. I was not a fan of the sesame sauce. I would not get it again. 
 - Pork and cabbage potstickers 6pcs ($5.49): the potstickers have a skirt! It has a crispy skirt when it is cooked. When you bite into it, you will get the juicy soup. It's delicious!

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
 - servers were polite and friendly.

There are not many places you can get a classic beef noodle in Vegas.  (so I have to come back, no choice)

To Chinese people, getting a beef noodle is as common as Japanese Folks eating Ramen, or Yall Murican's getting a burger.

The problem is that this place is a fraud and there's nothing ""artisan"" about it.  You'll come in and be dazzled by some idiot pulling noodles by hand and bouncing it on a table making noises that grab your attention.

Real places like this in China and I mean from Shanghai to Zhejiang.  
NO ONE BANGS THE NOODLES ON THE TABLE!  LOL.
So why do I call their BS?  A skilled noodle puller, (go search one on youtube) although does it by hand, the noodles width is reasonably consistent. This is important so that they cook evenly.  

First time I came here I sent my bowl back and asked for the regular noodles.  The hand pulled crap they make is laughably inconsistent.
Obviously thinner areas were overcooked, and thicker areas were raw.  Why I come back is that they put the customer first and if you hate something for any reason they will make it right.

Go there, and try the regular beef noodle with the hand pulled, then laugh and send it back and ask them for the machined pasta.  So much better, so much more consistency in each bite.

I didn't like their other stuff like the cold dan dan noodles.
Which for me is misleading.  Dan Dan Noodles are warm and spicy with a peanut sauce.  They gave me something that was cold with carrots?

I only go back for the number 1 with regular noodles.
If that is all they sold, I'd actually give them the other two stars.",udSgW1BGOjP4lw9_Fsqqpg,0,0,3,RIA-UdJIM8Ve3Ig_k5JODQ

However, I was so disappointed in their noodles!  Their so called freshly made noodles tasted exactly like regular frozen noodles.  They didn't have that bite or chewiness to it.

The sauce that they use is sweet so the wonton was sweet and the potsticker sauce was sweet. I'm a salty kind of person so I dipped my potsticker in soy sauce and Chili oil. The wonton my boyfriend devoured. He liked it sweet. The beef soup was very tasty(we added a little chili oil). It came w beef, your choice of noodle style and 2 bok choys. The beef was fatty. Which was yum for me but I know it's not for everyone. Usually my boyfriend doesn't like fat but everything was gone when we were done eating. It was very yummy and those 3 things was about $20 and we are full. Will come back",MX-tkJ1XClGPKrDj8aJhIg,2,0,5,9UMsH2re15ypo37rJQeiQQ
5333682,2016-09-10,3,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"It was a special day for my Sisters and I decided to take them out. We decided to try this new place out that I bookmarked a few weeks ago. Today 9.8.16 was their official Grand Opening day. Once we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated at once at this modern and clean place. Great use of space despite being small inside. However the bar with an open kitchen was cool and exciting to watch while waiting for your food being prepared. Moving on to the food we had.

Appetizers:
Cucumber Salad-Fresh and crisp cucumber and seasoned just right with a hint of spice. The dressing was like a cross of peanut butter and chili oil flavoring.
Beef Pancake-Juicy meat patty with a slight crisp paper texture that went well with the soy based sauced it came with.
Spicy Wontons-Balanced Flavor and texture. The spices went well with the soy garlic flavoring with chili oil.

Main Dishes:
Beef Shang Noodle Soup-Awesome broth and the hand pulled noodle was just right in texture.
Chicken & Mushroom Noodle-Good dish that was well seasoned and great alternative from their soup options.
Seafood Noodle Soup-Delicious and flavorful. The broth was balanced and not too salty.

Overall we had a good time and the service was on point. The server was very attentive and was very knowledgable with the menu. She was very helpful and patient with us especially when it came to deciding if we wanted Hand-Pulled Noodles or Knife-Shaved Noodles with our main dishes.

5349224,2016-08-22,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"The first time I heard of Shang Artisan Noodle was on an Eater article some time ago. I had completely forgotten about this place until we saw it one night while going to the café next door. So what did we do? We came back the next day for dinner! 

It was a Saturday night and it turns out to be their third day in business! Whoa! We have such good timing then! We love trying new places out! The food that Shang Artisan Noodle offers, as well as their seating placements, reminded us a lot of Noodle Man (located on Rainbow and I-215.) They even have a guy that's showcasing how he hand pulls the noodles in the open kitchen! 

Shang Artisan Noodle offered four different types of soup noodles: beef noodle, pork belly noodle, pork rib noodles, and seafood noodles. Of those, you get to choose what KIND of noodles you want: knife cut noodles, hand pulled noodles, or regular noodles. My boyfriend and I got their beef noodle with hand pulled noodles. My friend got their beef noodle with knife cut noodles and my other friend got their pork rib with hand pulled noodles.

You can absolutely tell that the noodles were hand pulled because they were all different widths! The noodles that I had in my bowl were a good texture and somewhat al dente, however, my boyfriend stated that his noodles were a little mushy. I'm not sure if that's because his was sitting in his bowl a bit longer or it came that way. His bowl and my friend's bowl with knife cut noodles were served first so they waited for us to get our food before digging in. The beef were really really tender, which is really good! That means they braised it long enough!!! My friend's pork ribs were pretty yummy as well -- it as a really good and familiar flavor to it! Tastes like mom's braising! 

The soup base, on the other hand, was a little on the light side. I mean, it can be seen as a good thing or bad thing. To me, I felt as though it was missing something. To other people, it may seem to be the perfect balance. It's not like I'm going to drink the whole bowl of soup so it's fine. 

Towards the end of our meal, they gave us a complimentary dish of celery salad! It was a cold salad with celery, peanuts, and carrots! I love celery! And the sauce that they used was really yummy :)! Would definitely get this dish again. 

Also! They serve you watermelon infused water, which is really unique. I can't say I liked it though haha. I'm not a watermelon fan so watermelon infused water doesn't do much to me. You are able to just ask for regular water!

Overall, decent food and decent prices. I loveeee hand pulled noodles! So glad that the Chinatown area finally has something like this hear by. Would definitely recommend people in trying this place :)",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,3,2,4,LPuMuwcShRge8Psy3iPvsA

Hand pulled is perfect and consistent in size and the knife shaved has a thicker and chewy consistently. I didn't even bother with the regular noodles. The Dan Dan noodles were good, but a little spicey even when we said no spice. It probably wouldn't be good without a little kick. The shang beef soup was delish with the hand pulled noodles. It was so flavorful and the cuts of meat were a good balance of meat and slight bit of fat. The pot stickers (both beef and chicken) had a great outer crust which is the reason why you have to wait 10 minutes for them to come out. Definitely worth the wait though although I couldn't really taste the difference between the beef and the pork. The spicy won tons were plentiful and we ordered it not spicy so it's perfect for kids.

Despite the noodles being homemade, I was actually a bit disappointed with how tough they were. Maybe I just like my noodles softer but I preferred the homemade noodles at Noodle Man more.

My favorite dish was actually the beef pancake appetizer! It's $5 for 4 pan-seared pancakes and beware of how juicy they are! Definitely try to poke a hole before biting or cutting into it - don't say I didn't warn you!

I've tried the Shang Beef Noodle and the broth's flavor wasn't memorable for me. I do like the portion size and the amount of beef that they give though! The beef was quite tender and fresh. This dish is probably the best bet here for me. 

I've also had the Dan Dan noodles which I was disappointed with since Shang's version doesn't have the classic peanut flavor. To me, the combination of peanut + spice makes the dish. They got the spice part down though! The dish also includes ground pork but the dish as a whole wasn't enough to make me full lol.

A couple of trips to Fremont St and the outlets, but that was about it.  Which always bummed me out since I knew there were plenty of interesting places to try.  So, with my conference over and nowhere else to be, this was the perfect time to check out something new!  Something like...a nice, hot bowl of beef noodle soup!

After hearing so many great things about Shang Artisan Noodle, I almost immediately put them at the top of my list of Vegas bookmarks.  Once I stepped inside and took a look at the menu though, it's easy to see why folks like them so much.  Not only did all of their noodle dishes look really good, but so did all of their different types of dumplings and potstickers!  Fortunately, I was able to make my way back on another stop in town before I could get to writing this, so I got to try even more for my review!

-- BEEF PANCAKE (4 pieces)...$5.49
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=xxw1xgg_hu3xW-hPI-uHuA)
More dumpling than ""pancake"", but this was pretty interesting!  In a way, this is essentially like a sheng jian bao (fried pork soup dumpling) with its pan-fried skin and soupy broth.  That said, while the broth is flavorful, I'd still prefer the variety over this beef one.

-- SHANG BEEF NOODLE SOUP - Beef Broth, Braised Beef Brisket, Veggies, and Choice of Noodles (Hand-pulled, Knife-shaved, Plain)...$8.95
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=C9pBFkDbuoidtVUp-XdrtQ)
As tempting as their other noodle dishes looked, I knew I had to get this one the first time I came here.  Thankfully, it didn't disappoint!  Each piece of beef was both meaty and tender, the noodles had the perfect bite, and I loved the broth - so deep and robust!

-- PORK & CABBAGE POT STICKER (6 pieces)...$5.49
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=fzg_WZHMUKaGLe5YVvi51Q)
I may not have expected much out of this dish, but this was pretty good!  The potstickers were pleasantly plump, the skins were tender and only slightly thick, and the filling itself was rather tasty.  Plus, it had a good ratio of meat to cabbage.  Not bad!

-- PORK BELLY NOODLE - Pork & Chicken Broth, Braised Pork Belly. Veggies, and Choice of Noodles (Hand-pulled, Knife-shaved, Plain)...$8.95
(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/shang-artisan-noodle-las-vegas?select=wNvKKr_6FFHXzKwLMBN68Q)
Despite how the hand-pulled noodles seemed a little off this time around (knew I should've tried the knife-shaved one!), this was solid.  This broth wasn't quite as rich, but I LOVED the pork belly!  Not only was the portion quite generous, but every piece was huge and only slightly fatty.  Delish!

Even though my second trip here wasn't quite as amazing, I should also point out we were a bit tired of noodle soups when we came here (our two meals before this one were ramen).  For me, Shang is a fantastic spot and their beef noodle soup is well worth checking out.  With so many bookmarks to work my way through, I may not necessarily make it a point to come back.  But if the opportunity presented itself?  I'd never say no to that!

If you're in the mood for something with a lighter soup (chicken broth) and healthier ingredients (shrimp, squid, fishcakes, veggies), this is the noodle soup to get. 
I always get the knife-shaved noodles because it's more traditional and crafty, and I always feel full after an entire bowl of chewy noodles.

One standout is their freshly made ""Spicy Wonton"" appetizer, which offers a comfortable heat that is accessible to most palettes.  I loved the silkiness of the wonton skin as my teeth broke into the delightfully, juicy pork center.  I also enjoyed the thick skinned ""Beef Pancake"" (eat these in small bites or the juice WILL shoot out the other side!) and the fantastic ""Beef & Onion potsticker"".  Those deep fried ""potstickers"" you've been eating elsewhere?  Total garbage!!!!

Their signature noodle soup, ""Shang Beef Noodle"", was sumptuous.  Not spicy or robust like the Taiwanese version, but the beefy flavor I sought was well pronounced.  That had everything to do with the braised beef brisket combined with all that delicious bone marrow broth.  And THEN there were all those hand pulled noodles underneath it all!!  Slurp after slurp, bite after bite...wonderful.   

Other items:

Sliced Beef Shank: Served chilled and topped with balsamic vinegar sauce, this was another great starter.  I appreciated the tender and slightly gelatinous texture.

Shang Fried Rice: The preserved bean sprouts were the dominating flavor, which may not be a hit with fans of Americanized Chinese, so the Yang-Zhou version would probably be preferable.  I liked it, but it's not for everyone.

Cucumber Salad:  The combination of cool cucumber, tasty sesame sauce and the slight heat of chili oil on the bottom was a winning combination.  

On my ""to eat"" list for future visits is..........the rest of the menu!!

Other tips:

- Do not let the noodles sit for long (ahem phone pics, cough,cough) as the texture will change and they are best as soon as served.  

- The ""Hot"" items are not that spicy, just flavorful, so specify if you actually want HOT.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,136,113,5,iWNilPfwrzAhDwQXhc8phA

Came here for on a weekday, the place is small but just about nice for lunch time. Didn't have to wait in line and seating is specious enough you won't feel uncomfortable. 

We ordered a Yang-Zhou fried rice and seafood noodle soup. When the food came we're little shock  inside. The fried rice has great presentation, but it cost $9 for a small portion. For lunch, at a local noodle shop, this just made us kind of disappointed. The noodle soup was served in reasonable portion. The soup base was delicious! The hand pulled noodles has good texture to it too. 

The restaurant is very clean and pleasant overall and service was great. Just think they should reconsider how much they're charging for their fried rice, or should give a bigger portion at least.

5579610,2017-01-08,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"This is probably my most favorite find in Vegas thus far. I was looking for a noodle place and this place popped up. Shang is a little restaurant that specializes in hand-pulled noodles. 

[1] Beef noodles - It seems that most of the patrons in the restaurant at the time ordered the beef noodle soup. My roommate got this and she really enjoyed it. It's served with bok choy, green onions, and cilantro. The broth is delicious and the beef is extremely tender. 

[2] Dan Dan Noodles which is a dry noodle served with minced pork, sichuan pepper, chili oil and scallions. I'm always craving cold udon which can sometimes be similar to dan dan noodles, so I opted to go against the crowd and get this dish. I really enjoyed the hand pulled noodles, the minced pork was perfectly savory, and the chili oil pulls everything together perfectly. 

[3] Spicy Wonton - Delicately wrapped wontons served with chili oil, green onions, and sesame seeds. Really really good dish, I would order this again for sure. 

[4] Beef Pancakes - another favorite dish of mine, I always order it whenever I get the chance. The presentation of the beef pancake at Shang was unconventional, they're more like little cylindrical fried dumplings. Really good, also another must order. 

The bill was surprisingly cheap for the amount of food we got! There was only one server that night and she was holding it down!! I can't wait to tell my friends and family all about this place.",x2-TP8fd4G0OqkgDyKt3IA,7,3,5,pPMl_7_WCl9lYU_HDQzQnA
5588930,2016-08-30,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"We were driving past the other day when my husband noticed the sign for Shang's and randomly decided to Yelp it. Reviews looked good and the place is brand new! And when he said hand-pulled noodles, I was sold. The first time I had such noodles was in Chinatown in NYC. And it was amazing. So today we went back to try it. 

When we walked in and got situated, one of the chefs in a big open window started his hand pulling noodle thing. It was great to see how fresh it was! I wondered if he automatically starts pulling noodles because he knows people will order it.

It wasn't so busy but service was great. We got water infused with watermelon and were helped right away. 

Firstly, the chef provided us with a dish of pickled cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. He wanted to know I'd it was worth putting on the menu. I really like these types of pickled veggies, and I thought it tasted great! But honestly, I'm not sure if people would order it. Maybe if it was $1-2. But would that be worth it?
 
We ordered a variety of things and everything tasted great!!

Spicy wonton
Beef pancake
Cucumber salad
Shang's beef soup with hand-pulled noodles
Pork belly soup with hand-pulled noodles
Dan Dan noodles

The spicy wonton was tasty. And surprisingly, it was hot. I'm used to this dish being cold, but having it hot was delicious!

The beef pancake was yummy too. It's more like a fried dumpling filled with beef than an actual pancake. It had some broth/soup inside like shanghai dumplings. So when we cut them in half to share, we lost all the soup!! :( 

The cucumber salad is sliced cucumbers topped with a peanut-y sauce. It needed more flavor to me, so I dipped it into a mixture of the provided soy sauce and chili sauce. So much better!

The beef and pork belly noodle soups taste completely different. The beef is slightly spicy and salty. The pork one is slightly sweet. But both are very savory and taste great!

The Dan Dan noodles are delicious as well. But is not a soupy dish. Slightly sweet as well. 

The wonton soup comes with no noodles. Tastes like Chinese seafood soup. Also good.

I can't wait to go back, this place was so good! And its here in Vegas and not somewhere ridiculously far like New York :)",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,2,2,5,_4wvkuPI5vCT1zbZ31TGkA

The beef noodle soup was good. Beef was tender. The broth was full of flavor. Spicy Wonton was good. A bit flavoring than most places that just drown it in red vinegar and chili.

The pork belly was delicious and I liked the broth. However, I preferred the brisket in the Shang noodle soup as it was more flavorful and the broth was much richer. The spicy wontons though were really good. One of the best I've ever had. It's not ""spicy"" but it does have a little heat with sweetness to it.

The meat and vegetables was good but not the very best. The bowl does contain a really big portion for only about $9. It's definitely worth coming here especially when it's almost winter time this place will get super busy.

We started with the cucumber salad, beef pancakes, and spicy wontons. The cucumber was unique and good. Beef pancakes were really nice. The spicy wontons were a little bland. For entrees I ordered the Dan Dan Noodle and my girlfriend ordered the Beef Shank Noodle.  The Dan Dan Noodle is a dish without sauce and was great by itself but adding chili oil made it much much better. The beef shank was very flavorful; the broth was a little bit on the sweet side for my taste and the shank was not as tender as I'd hoped but overall a great dish. The only issue I mainly had was that when we ordered the food, my food came out way, way before my girlfriend's food. So my dish had to sit for a bit before touching it since hers didn't come out.

All their noodles are handmade and you can actually see them making the noodles by hand.  One of my favorite noodles is their knife-shaved noodle.  They use a large piece of noodle and use a sharp knife to shave little strands of noodle directly to the boiling water.  
This is my favorite because it tastes chewy and not too thick or thin. 
I ordered their Artisan Beef Noodle with Knife-shaved noodle and I also added extra noodles for $1.50 extra.  
Their beef broth was full of flavor but not spicy enough for my liking.  But it's okay, they have a container of spicy sauce on the table which tastes spicy enough.

Let me start by saying this place is good and fairly priced in case you don't want to read the rest of my review. The restaurant is very small and can only hold roughly around 20 people (I'm guessing) at a time. I came for dinner and beat a huge wave of people. I was able to be seated and finish dinner and still saw the same group waiting. The menu is limited with a few appetizers and 3 types of noodles. Everyone at my table got the hand pulled noodles but I want to come back and try the other two. I got the Shang Beef Noodle with extra noodles. The broth was delicious and the noodles were very good. My friend got a wet noodle plate and was told it wasn't as good as the Shang Beef. My biggest complaint was the main dishes were brought out way before the appetizers were. By the time the appetizers came, we were all way too full to enjoy them. We got the beef pancake and wontons, both were mediocre for me.

This place does not by any means do justice to Chinese noodle soups. Very Americanized.

The soups were passable, not great and the beef shank and stew were the strongest points for the noodle soups. The spicy wontons weren't bad but they were tiny and timid.

After we told the server that our beef was frozen she brought out a complementary dish cucumbers with sesame sauce on it. But....the sauce on the cucumbers was not edible either the taste was unflavored sesame wallpaper paste.

The pork and cabbage potstickers were very filling because of the thick wrappers used and the plentiful contents inside which were cooked perfectly and quite juicy.

Love this spot! Came here the other week for dinner. It was empty and I was the only one there. Parking wasn't a problem. 

A pulled noodle joint in Vegas. Love it. 

Order their most popular noodle dish. Beef was favored well and tender. 

I also order the gyzoya. Average. 

Customer service was great. 

If I'm ever in the city craving noodle and want something different then ramen, I'm sure to keep this place in mind. 

I'm a fan.

Food: 4

Pork Rib Noodles with Knife Shaved Noodles: The ribs were cooked perfectly. They had the right amount of seasoning and were super tender. I wasn't a fan of the broth. Because it's supposed to be a chicken and pork based broth, I thought it would be lighter, but it was as dark and heavy as traditional beef noodle soup.

Chicken Chow Mein with Hand Pulled Noodles: The dish was a tad too oily and salty, but it was pretty tasty. The chicken wasn't dry and it had great flavors.

* Note: Knife shaved noodles are thicker and chewier than hand pulled noodles.

Service: 4

The servers were really nice, attentive, and super patient with all of our questions. Food came out pretty fast too.

Ambiance: 5

The restaurant is located in a small strip mall, and there's plenty of parking. Although the strip mall is not the nicest looking, the restaurant is very nice on the inside. It's modern, well-lit, and clean. Customers have the choice to sit at the counter or table, but all seats will afford some view of the open kitchen.

I was in Vegas for the weekend and was craving some beef noodle soup and came across Shang. I was amazed by the noodle options they had because a lot of place do not have fresh knife cut noodles. I live in LA and was never able to find a memorable Taiwanese knife cut noodle restaurant. That being said, I was so excited to try this place out. The first time I came here, there was a short wait since it was a Sunday afternoon. Luckily, we got a seat at the bar and was able to watch the amazing workers make our order fresh. We ended up trying the Shang Beef knife-cut Noodle, Beef Shank noodle, and Spicy Wontons. The Shang Beef Noodle was amazing. Everything from the texture of the chewy noodles to the flavorful beef broth deserves a solid 5 stars. The spicy wontons were pretty yummy as well, but it is a little on the spicy side. I would say it is considered medium spicy for all those that can't handle spicy. I came on a second time a few months later and also tried their Shang Fried Rice and that tasted great as well! It kind of reminded me a little of Din Tai Fung's fried rice for all my LA friends that love DTF. 

All in all everything was amazing, the quality of food to the customer service. I ended up placing an addition two Beef noodle soup orders to take back with me to LA, that is how much I love this place. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas or those that live nearby!",2xq3kA-X6o_wPQht76lWag,0,0,5,umAub5qNxu15Ows67t07GQ
5795301,2018-04-22,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"My husband and I ate here three times when we were visiting Las Vegas a few weeks ago.  I mentioned to my husband that I found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it because the reviews were pretty good for this restaurant. 

ATMOSPHERE:
Welcoming and clean atmosphere.  There's an open kitchen to watch them make the noodles and cook your food.  

It feels so exciting to be able to watch someone making hand pulled noodles.  You can choose three types of noodles:  hand-pulled, knife-shaved, or plain noodle.  If you want to order extra noodles, it's an extra charge of $1.50.  

I wanted to give 5 stars overall, but couldn't.  For the service, I would definitely give 5 or more stars, but for the food, I couldn't.  

SERVICE:  
Definitely 5/5 stars.  If I could give more stars, I would.
The service here is exceptional!  Best service ever!  I wouldn't write this if this wasn't true.  I'm very picky about service.  If the service is not good at an establishment/business, most of the time I dread to return or would not return to that establishment or business.  

1st day - There were a lot of people waiting outside.  Found out that there were two large parties.  The restaurant is not that big.  I think it fits about 30 people.  We waited for about 20 minutes or so for a table.  
Both of the servers working that night were very nice, courteous and friendly.  They asked if we needed anything several times even though they were very busy.  

2nd day - We were greeted by a different server and he was also very nice, courteous and friendly.  He provided excellent service to us.   He also asked us several times if we needed anything. 

3rd day - We were greeted by one of the same server from the 1st time we dined and he again welcomed us with a smile.  We definitely felt welcomed and was provided excellent service again.

FOOD:
 -  Shang Beef Noodles $9.75 with Knife-Cut Noodles
1st and 2nd times were 5/5.  The knife-shaved noodles were chewy and the plain noodle (almost like spaghetti type pasta) had good texture.   The soup had a lot of beef flavor and was piping hot.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  We added extra noodles every time.  

I couldn't wait to eat it again for the 3rd time, but the 3rd time, the soup was not hot and the noodles were soggy.  I was very disappointed.  I felt nauseated afterwards because I ate it lukewarm.  If my food is supposed to be hot in temperature, I need it to be piping hot.  My husband was ok with it.
___________________________________________
 - Chicken Chow Mein $8.75 - 2/5
The first bite I ate was good, but then I realized that it was a little too saucy.  I think it would've been better if it was cooked a little longer.  It needed the high fire flavor too.  

 - The hot sauce in the jar on the table lacked flavor.  

Just a thought:  I didn't like the fact that the workers in the kitchen do not wear gloves.  There's sometimes more than one person touching the noodles too.  A person would grab the noodles with their hands and place the noodles into a serving bowl.   Thinking about this, it's not sanitary.  It'll be better if the noodles are cooked and immediately put into the serving bowl.  

Overall, I would definitely come back especially for the service.  Next time, I would request for my food to be piping hot.",U6uj33zxsDKzN-Y_97S0OQ,0,0,4,mui9XxL6KpAc8KaG3LvffA

Even when I'm ravenously hungry, I always leave satisfied. Depending on how much self-control I have that day, I either end up with leftovers or slightly uncomfortable from eating too much.

Additionally, they do have vegetarian options: Tomato & Egg Noodle and their Tomato & Egg Rice, which is essentially one flavor option, but boy, do they do it well. The flavors are simple, yet harmonious. The sweetness from the tomato, the savoriness of the egg, the fresh component from the bok choy, and the great texture from their hand-pulled noodles work amazing together. A+ veggie option for my non-meat eating homies.

5/5 customer service
5/5 price and quantity 
By far the best Chinese noodles in Vegas, hands down! They offer two different types of seating: noodle bar (where you can see the chefs make the ramen, fresh every day) or regular 4 tops. The restaurant is fairly small so if you catch them on a busy day the wait time fluctuates from 15-20 to 35-40 (depending on the number of people in your party of course). 
I've never tried anything another than their Shang's beef noodle, it got me hooked from the beginning. Love the tenderness of the beef and the flavor of the broth. You're given three options for your noodle type: hand pulled (long and thin), knife shave (thick and chewy) or plain (kinda like angel hair spaghetti). I've tried all three and the hand pulled are my favorite, it goes great with everything. The knife shave can be too thick, to where it can fill you up really fast.

5918951,2016-09-13,5,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"Another bookmark conquered off of my extremely long list of Yelp bookmarks. And it was an excellent decision deciding to come here too.

First impression is how clean the restaurant is. It could easily be a cafe serving just coffee or plated desserts. Not at all what I would stereotypically imagined a Chinese restaurant to look like from the abyss of my imagination.  That is a very good thing indeed.  The interior design is well conceptualized and executed, obviously the work done by a professional designer and contractor from scratch.

While we were looking over their simple menu, one of the chefs was making the handpulled noodles ??? from scratch (I didn't see the dough being made, just the very important part where the chef transformed a ball of dough into magical strands of noodles using nothing but his hands and physics, much practiced technique of Chinese noodle-making, without the aid of machines to roll out sheets of dough into the proper thickness and cut into the desired width).  He made it look way too easy!!!

At first I was going to order their hand cut noodle, but opted for the hand pulled noodles, since it was literally being made in front of our eyes, as we sat at the counter, right in front of their kitchen where noodles are hand made and the noodles are cooked and plated.  And I settled on ordering their Pork Belly HandNoodle ??????, while my friend ordered their Dan-Dan Noodle ???.  

It didn't take too long for our orders to be made. The Dan-Dan Noodle ??? came out first, followed shortly by my Pork Belly Handpulled Noodle.  The noodles are easily the main draw of coming here to eat. My Pork Belly Noodle was served with a very good broth, not oily or too salty, just a well made broth with 95% tender braised pork belly. (No preserved cabbage served here though, which is more of a Taiwanese style).  

The Dan-Dan Noodle, according to my friend Jason, looks to be too salty (too much Dan-Dan Sauce) which he confirmed right away.  But he still liked the freshly made noodles.

The complimentary (due to checking in on Yelp) Wonton in Chili Oil ???? was not very impressive. The wontons on their own were above average, which are also made with handmade wonton wrappers. But their sauce was the underwhelming component that failed this dish.

In spite of the disappointing Dan-Dan Noodle and failed-to-impressed Wontons in Chili Oil, I still enjoyed the food enough to look forward to coming back again. However, next time I will give their Hand Cut Noodles ??? a go, I expect it to be every bit as good as their Handpulled Noodles.

We ordered shang beef noodle, dandan noodle, tomato/egg rice and the beef potsticker. 
Shang beef noodle was my favorite of the night. The soup had a lot of flavor and the meat tasted good. However it still didn't taste like the beef noodle that I used to have back in Taiwan. 
Tomato egg rice tasted like any tomato egg rice you can make at home. But then I didn't expect much from it anyways because it's just stir-fried tomato and egg on top of steam rice with a side of veggie. 
Beef potsicker had a nice presentation but the taste was very average. 
On to the last item of the night which was dandan noodle. This tasted nothing like dandan noodle I have anywhere else and it was cold. At first we thought maybe they brought us the wrong item because the people making the noodles behind the clear glass and the waitresses were all non-Asians (I know this sounds horrible but can't help but being a little stereotypical here). But then the waitress ensured us that it WAS indeed dandan noodle. She was nice enough to offer a little sesame sauce on the side to go with it though. At the end when I went to the bathroom I overheard the two 'chefs' talking to each other in Mandarin. This made them screwing up the taste of dandan noodle unforgiving to me. 

Overall I didn't enjoy the food as much as I thought I would. I think I was hyped up by the reviews too much before coming in so expectation was too high. However I did really like their interior decor and how you can see they're making noodle.

Simply fantastic.

I'd totally go again. Clean and courteous staff combined with a great menu made this a five-star dining experience for my group.

Overall, I was just really impressed with this restaurant. I ordered the Beef Noodle Soup with hand-pulled noodles, which was just phenomenal. I want to try the knife-cut noodles next time. You actually get to see the staff create the noodles from scratch too, which was entertaining and super IG-able good (hint: use the boomerang setting). The beef was tender with a good combination of fat. The soup was simply delightful.

Price-wise, it was extremely affordable and I left satisfied. You definitely get your money's worth. We also got beef pancakes, which were good;however, I'd probably skip this appetizer next time.",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,3,2,5,yspHEHqXGws1ZqciPyYTrQ
5947892,2017-08-02,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"This place is the BOMB! I went with the Shang's beef brisket and hand pulled noodles. Wow, the flavor was amazing, and I don't think I've had fresher noodles. Perfect texture. I added in some chili paste they provide on the table to kick it up -- be careful, because it's legit chili and hot. I had not previously experienced Chinese noodle soup like this, it reminded me of Vietnamese Pho, and you eat it the same way: with a large spoon in one hand and chopsticks in the other. 

The service was excellent -- efficient and friendly, but not overbearing. The restaurant is spanking clean, and you can also watch the food being prepared in the open kitchen. 

My only suggestion would be to lower the sodium in the broth. It's pretty salty, but I will admit that I am not a huge fan of sodium. But I can't wait to return and try other items.",zxmIKyEX89aY0QLC1JJksA,0,0,5,3T5KlIKmw_1reTnsdSK_HA
5947902,2018-02-15,0,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"I gotta say, for the amount of people waiting for Shang Artisan Noodles, this place was as average as it gets. Service was decent though.

I got the Dan Dan noodles with hand pulled noodles and the pork and cabbage potstickers. The issue with the Dan Dan is the sauce was not as peanut-y as I would have liked; the flavor lacked depth to it. It seemed like straight up soy sauce and chili oil, and the preserved veggies were not very pleasant with the noodles. Because of the flatness in flavor of the veggies sitting in the sauce, the veggies didn't add anything to the dish and tasted exactly like the sauce in which it was sitting. The dish would benefit greatly from a touch of sweetness or even vinegar. I think that would balance it out a lot more. That being said, maybe the soup noodles fare better than the dry.

The potstickers were also only ok. The skin was a little thick for my preference and almost seemed slightly undercooked. I don't think I'll be back.",ocyu2o8Cb0qIsJmMrInUrQ,1,1,2,m16P_pNNMdUqQ-xR6qWJ_A

This restaurant is small with just a few tables and there are 10 seats at the bar where you can watch the cooks do their magic.  I ordered the beef stewed Noodle, chili oil wonton, Dan Dan Noodle. The beef stew was tender as I expected. The Dan Dan Noodle was just ok for me. The sauce for the spicy wonton is a bit too salty for my liking.  Also, the meat stuffing is not much for the wontons.  These young servers were very fast and one of them offered us water while we waited for our seats. You don't often find that kinda treatment.

This spot is tiny, if it's busy be prepared to wait. Other than that, the decor and environment is very nice. All of the employees are friendly and helpful. I wasn't too familiar with the menu and they always offer great suggestions. 

I only come here for the noodles, I've tried some appetizers and they were not to my liking. I hear they're popular but it just wasn't good to me. The chicken chow mien is the real winner. I find myself craving that often. The soups are delicious as well. And the broths are full of flavor. 

The prices here are great. You can have a fresh, delicious, guilt free meal at a great price. If you're looking to try something new, come here.",dL4_drDAJAPCsiw1y-xPNg,1,2,4,cRFlnGGb3PABZOvXMiZVEA

My meal on this visit was the Shang beef noodle with the knife cut noodles. The broth was rich and full of beef flavor. The beef was very tender and tasty. Although it was a deep beef flavor, the broth was not overwhelmed with fat.

5961915,2016-12-27,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"What type of Chinese person doesn't eat rice? Me! I can live without rice but I simply can't live without noodles. Hand-pulled and knife-shaved noodles are some of my favorites and I have been dying to try Shang Artisan Noodle.

It was only 11:15 (15 minutes after opening) and most of the tables were already full. Within 15 more minutes, the entire restaurant was packed. There was only one guy waiting tables at first and two people in the kitchen so service/food was a bit slow but they tried their best. I love that you could see the guy pull the noodles. It was very cool!

We started with spicy wontons. I'd give these 3 stars - they weren't spicy enough and the sauce was too liquid and did not have enough chili.

We also got two bowls of noodles to share: Shang Beef Hand-Pulled Noodles and Dan Dan Knife Cut Noodles. I'd give both of them 4 stars but for different reasons.

The Beef noodles had a good flavor (although my own beef noodle soup had more depth of flavor than this version). I wanted to love the hand-pulled noodles but upon closer inspection, they varied too much in size. I understand that they are handmade but the precision just isn't quite there.

The Knife Cut noodles had a more authentic texture. However, I'm not sure what part of the sauce mix makes it ""Dan Dan"" style. I was disappointed that it wasn't really Dan Dan noodles at all.

If you're looking for great tasting hand-made noodles, Shang meets that criteria. Authenticity is questionable.",2HchhLgGj16aITZGVy0hqA,3,2,4,vSZZZkiaxvZvDoN-RVWWoA

5995179,2017-04-19,1,JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw,"If there's anything worthy of five stars, it's good food, service, ambiance and price. This restaurant had a rating of five star across the board for me. Mind you, me and my girlfriend are not a fan of Chinese food so it takes a lot of me to say that this restaurant won us over. Let me go over as to why: 

Food: we shared an order of chow mein, beef noodle soup, and beef cakes. Very flavorful to say the least. When you're there, I highly subject to order soup since this is their highlighting meals. Regardless, I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the dishes. 

Service: The noodles are handmade as you see attendants stretching the and kneading the dough. That was one of the most memorable parts of the visit and I love how transparent they are about cooking your food. You know you're eating quality dishes to the highest standard. Also the waiters were on point about their service. I love how friendly they were and always asked if we need anything else. The food was also quick to deliver with only the beef cakes that experienced a bit of a hiccup. 

Ambiance: beautiful and modern. It's modest in size but very intimate for dinner with friends. Its brightly lit with adorable sets of utensils along with them. Every elements in the restaurant flowed with the design from the colors of the wall to the soup spoons. 

Prices: amazing. It really shows that good food doesn't have to be expensive. And to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if they bumped up the prices just a tad bit more but the fact that they keep their prices low with large portions is admirable. They're definitely consumer-friendly in all aspects. 

A must try when you're in the area! Oh and after your meal, save room for dessert which is found right next door!",PJjpm8Kb4u2DHvj8yBhn0w,5,2,5,OTONAYIPW8dlsRRs0i6Qvg
