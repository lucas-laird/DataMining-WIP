He didn't know what he was doing and after a 15 minute transaction his employees had to fix the payment problem that he couldn't. I will never go to this one ever again!",e12niGwUJRGCNxFyB9aJ9w,0,0,1,t56WSR-WaE9wRObxdn-AVg

This place is just not one of the better Taco Bells in the city. Typically there are longer than average wait times and the service is decent at best, even by fast food standards. 


FYI, there are decent options to eat at TB..

-Chicken Soft Tacos are only 170 calories each
-Chicken Burritos are a bit more at 420 calories each

I like to grab either 2 chicken soft tacos or 1 chicken burrito...my cheat food :)

Honestly, it's not a horrible location, but you can definitely find better Taco Bells in Las Vegas.

2 stars.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,3,3,2,R78lf6lFtM9ZdAHYgs1_7g

If I do review fast food it is not the food I am reviewing because there is a standard of quality that must be maintained or the standard of the fast food chain will be compromised however that changes within the management of each chain.  

Whew with that said, The quality of every meal I get here is excellent as far as fast food goes.  However the quality of customer service goes above and beyond.  They are super nice in the speaker always polite and the order is also correct as well as the side/sauces!  I am always happy and happy to be happy in the speaker and at the window to the employees because they are so nice!

I will continue to eat here because I have never had a problem and the employees are so extremely NICE whats up?! Thank you...",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,2,2,4,Wde-m53Gom5yTkidNrUFig

You are MUCH better off going a little farther down the road to Chipotle and get a steak bowl there, with ~650 calories and a dollar more, you'd get much fresher ingredients and deliciousness. I wouldn't recommend Taco Bell's Cantina bowl to anyone who has any bud tastes at all.",f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,0,0,1,ytbdDtGWDVJhlULdTdEh9A
