91081,2017-03-12,0,kXxSkjIByGp4X6-FIO8_Qw,"We've been coming here with my family for a few years now and I'm ashamed to say I've never written a review. Rudy, the owner/operator, and his amazing staff have never let us down. He's an ex-New Yorker like we are, and appreciates the east coast diner culture from back in the day, and it really shows in his attention to detail and customer service. They treat us like family and shower my kid with attention. The food is high quality, portioned well, and always cooked properly. I know Rudy takes great pride in sourcing good ingredients, and it shows. Running a diner is no small feat, keeping up with a large menu is a challenge these days for a small business owner. 

We come about once a month on average, usually for breakfast and the food is great. Big, fluffy, never over cooked omelettes are my thing.  They never have a problem with substitutions, and will work with you on making your meal right. They even let my wife substitute sausage links or bacon for toast and potatoes to fit her low carb style with NO UPCHARGE!!!  My daughter loves their French toast and I must admit, it's pretty good, plus the staff treats her like a princess. Seattle's best brand coffee is brewed fresh constantly, always piping hot, strong, and never stale. This is 'our' diner, a very special place in the NY/NJ ethos. 

Bottom line pros: Tasty standard east coast style diner fare, big portions, family friendly atmosphere. Best breakfasts: omelettes and chicken fried steak. 
Lunch menu is solid too. Great burgers and sandwiches and perfect steak fries. 

Bottom line cons: Not a fan of the pancake batter, it's got too much vanilla flavor and isn't dense enough.  That's really it!",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,0,0,5,8OeklynnqQqpeq6gf5Fw0A

This is a great example of one of those businesses I just moved to the area and thought this would be a good place to try for breakfast boy was I wrong.  As soon as I walked in and sat  down the waitress gave me look like what am I doing here. I almost left then which would have been a great decision. She took my order of eggs over easy bacon crisp and pancakes.  The order arrived and at first glance look very good. The eggs and bacon were perfect and the two hot cakes looked good. Then I tasted the hot cakes. I have no idea what kind of batter they use but the taste was awful. Two bites was all I could handle. I set the plate on the opposite side from me in hopes that either the waitress or the owner might notice I was displeased with the hot cakes. No luck there. I went ahead and ate the eggs and bacon and waited.  And waited some more. Finally the owner came by and I asked for my check. Still no mention of the uneaten pancakes. Finally my waitress came by and volunteers to bring me a box and I told her that would not solve the ""problem"". She ignored that comment,took away the pan cakes and that was all from her. I then asked the owner for the check, paid $10.00 for two eggs and 3 pieces of bacon. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

They have a 3 item (your choice) omelette option and I went with that.  I got mushrooms, spinach, and pepper jack cheese.  The omelette came with hash browns and toast.  I opted for rye toast and it was the swirl rye.  The omelette had a large amount of the three items.  Coffee was brought before I ordered an refilled several times.

A few things about the place.  It's small and quaint with Coca Cola memorabilia.  The menu says breakfast is served to 10:30.  I arrived close to 10:30 and the server, Brenda, told me they could stretch the time a bit and that they will make an omelette any time of the day.  The menu is limited.  Don't expect to get stuffed French toast or exotic flavored pancakes.  This is a basic diner with basic diner food well prepared.  The neon sign inside says 50s Diner and I think they go by just The Diner at LVM because of the other 50s diner in town.

3994122,2015-12-10,0,kXxSkjIByGp4X6-FIO8_Qw,"So, truthfully, I was really looking forward to eating here.  Unfortunately, the old waitress staffing the small joint wasn't up for serving my party.  Full disclosure: we were a group of 4, two girls and two guys.  It was the late morning after a long night on the strip and we all had the remains of makeup still on our face.  The two guys in our group have long hair and we aren't white.  We aren't stuffy or old or upper middle class.  We were comfy and young and we were polite and hungry.  But no service.  Sorry we didn't pack polos.

The waitress tells us curtly that it'll be a couple of minutes when we walk in but we don't mind waiting.  She is the only waitress but there are only two tables with people eating and one waiting for their check.  There are at least 6 tables free (small place).  She hands the couple their check and suddenly isn't short for words.  She's talking and joking and laughing and smiling.  She chats for a bit with their table then turns back to where we are and tells us it'll be a bit longer, she has to get a table ready.  No smiling.  She starts wiping down one of the clean tables.  Then she rearranges the menus on the table.  Another wipe down.  After that she doesn't turn toward the door and goes straight for the television.  She starts channel surfing.  Slowly.  Then she starts playing with the volume.  Up.  No wait, too loud.  Maybe a little louder.  Changes the channel again.  She walks up to another table to talk while avoiding our eyes.  We see a sign that says they stop breakfast at 11.  We missed breakfast?  Forget it.  Waited, sorry, WASTED 15 minutes for an empty restaurant and a racist old waitress.

Save your money.  And please ma'am, save your judgements.",geHwxyVCU7q-7Nl4Ce8iDA,3,2,1,qtXvJoziLlMyrGwkrLK5fA

4074982,2013-12-08,0,kXxSkjIByGp4X6-FIO8_Qw,"OK, so the other day (12/6/13) we returned to The Diner at LVM Resort, but this time for lunch.  We had a fine breakfast some time back, and really enjoyed meeting the owners Rudy and Donna (cook and waitress), so we figured we'd give lunch a try.

Once again, we were struck by the immaculate appearance of the place; all tables and counters spotless, all floors likewise, all vinyl booths crumb-less, all windows large and streak-less.  This place is kept in tip-top shape.  And we love the 50's diner décor.  Sort of, ""Route 66 meets Mel's Diner.""

Upon seating ourselves we were immediately approached by Donna for our drink orders, and then we perused the menu.  My wife opted to start with the chicken noodle soup, and I was a bit skeptical of the chili.  Donna suggested a small sampler, which sealed the deal.  I ordered a bowl, and she suggested chopped onions and cheese on top, which proved wonderful.  For $4 it's almost a meal in itself.

My wife's soup was great tasting and filling.

I ordered the Reuben on rye with extra dressing on the side, with fries.  The spousal unit ordered the corned beef on rye with cole slaw.  Both tasted great.

In addition to enjoying another fine meal we also enjoyed a chance to visit with Rudy and Donna.  Rudy grew up under the thumb of Russian communism in Czechoslovakia, and highly prizes his freedoms in America, and the capitalistic system that allows him to run his own business and fail or succeed based on his own hard work.  He eschews all forms of communism and socialism, and makes a lively case for the free enterprise system that drives (used to drive?) America.

Hurry on out to The Diner at LVM Resort (breakfast and lunch, no dinner).  You'll love the food, the jovial service, and ,if you want it, the lively conversation.  

You'll have to work to find them, about a block and a half north of Blue Diamond, on Arville, at the entrance to the fancy-schmancy motorhome park called the LVM  Resort.

It's ""resort"" quality at 50's diner prices ... with a dash of joviality mixed in.

Overall experience was fine, not fantastic. This cute little place has potential though. Service staff needs training on how to be efficient when stopping by a table. They seem to have that mentality where they just keep their head down and do a task instead of looking around and being alert to the needs of the other customers nearby (and a few more smiles wouldn't hurt). Not a bad idea to drop checks shortly after food is served like they do at other breakfast joints.

The Yelp app update came in handy Sunday morning when I was too lazy to think of what I wanted for breakfast. On the Search button it listed The Diner under What's for Breakfast? At first, I was like - ""what the heck is the LVM resort?"" As a Jersey girl who LOVES her diners, I was excited to give this place a try. It was just down the street, and when I looked at the map - I thought it was in a residential subdivision. You could only imagine my surprise when we pulled into this Spanish Trails-esque  entrance and found this adorable diner right where Yelp said it was. I have never heard of a motorcoach resort and apparently I've been living a mile from one for years. The Diner is tucked away on your immediate left as you turn into the LVM.

The service was AWESOME. I mean I've said awesome before and meant it but the service here was truly and absolutely MOST awesome.  Our waitress and the owner took great care of us. There is a fine line between great service and obtrusive service and here was nowhere near that line. I felt like I was at a nice person's house and they were excited to have me over. It was perfect. BIG plus - we ordered coffee and they let us know they had almost every flavor of creamer we could imagine. And they give you the bottle for your table. This amazed my husband. He took a picture of it and everything.

The food was great diner food. If you love ""true"" diners, then this place is a must-eat. If you've never been to a true diner or you aren't sure - it's a must eat for you too. We both ordered the same thing at the waitress' suggestion : chicken fried steak. It was plenty of food for the price and everything was cooked perfectly. The CFS was crispy & crunchy, the gravy tasted lovely - my husband scarfed it down and I could barely finish my plate.  

The 50s diner & décor is just homey to me. The white walls, red vinyl booths, old school coca-cola napkin dispenser, the old posters on the walls - it brought back a lot of memories of diner-hopping when I was a kid.

This is our new favorite spot. We can't wait to go back and have breakfast again, but I think we'll head over for lunch sometime very soon (they aren't open for dinner). The waitress let us know that their burgers are fresh not frozen and they strive for fresh-quality as much as they can.
