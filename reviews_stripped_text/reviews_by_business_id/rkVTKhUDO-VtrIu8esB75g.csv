Cashier was nice and friendly, but sorry to say the food was not up to par, not even close to Panda Express. Hubby had high hopes for the ramen since it's in their name. I ordered something basic that should be hard to mess up; it left me wishing I paid the $2 extra for the fried rice so the fact that they used a cheaper rice grain would have been masked.",HcWa8zbMDJbpOt0IzDg5PA,0,0,2,Ds-ppT98HjOw2YnNTKqaNg

I felt like the cooks there were like ""let's see all these fools pay top dollar for the bullshit food we gone make today."" Jokes really on us because they're open late and it seems on weekends type vibes, a lot of the drunk people will go there for a quick bite. They'll see the menu looks bomb af and then they'll tell their whole squad to come over and just eat here. Because that's exactly what happened to me for a party of 5 who were behind me in line lol. Anyways I wouldn't go here for food again even if all the food places are closed. Take the L and save your foodie troubles till the next morning or available foodie idea to come up. We're in Vegas so there should be more options out there besides this crap. You don't get what you pay for over here so beware of fake reviews to boost up their stats lol.

Pretty much the selections at this food court aren't highly rated on Yelp, but  at least Tiger Wok has some decent reviews. 

What's ordered: 

Crispy Noodles w/chicken- They were crispy white noodles (they seem like the ones you find at an Asian grocery store), it came with sauce to spread on for some flavor and of course chicken pieces (my choice) for toppings, all housed in a boxed container. This entree tasted okay nothing special. The portions were good, the crispy noodles wont be as crispy anymore once the sauce is spread on but the flavor and chicken add-on was just decent.

Tonkatsu Ramen- Portions good, the pork toppings was tender and tasty. The broth has some seasoning to it. My verdict with this choice just made this one to recommend on their menu.

Overall good spot to try out but don't expect to pay cheap. I already paid $9 for my crispy noodles and then paying additional for meats to go with that really?!",FaPrtK-SB9sygQuxndPm3Q,4,3,3,2Omn-LTMOwcl4dunL9i7ZQ
