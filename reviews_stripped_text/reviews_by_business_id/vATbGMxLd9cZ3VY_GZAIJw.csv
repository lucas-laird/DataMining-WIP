Fish tacos were good not great, but everything else was perfect. If you're looking for something other than the overpriced strip stuff, Charlie's could be on your list!",jLZ_pnuO5iqs-_Ymbdj3DQ,0,0,5,0Eu-ntAzaHECdn-wjNdNqg

After my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I surveyed the area.  Some old dudes playing video poker in the distance.  There is an old school 70's style fireplace north of the bar.  Lot's of Cariba'esque type decorations all over the place.  It's a mix of Captain Ron meets Margaritaville but Margaritaville is down on Boulder Highway.  When the old dudes left, it got quite other than the mellow rock station.  The barkeep was not one for conversation, so I finished my beer and bailed.  Could be another decade before I return but you never know.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,5,4,3,u8HHpgGG7JNmneBU4Sqckw

The decor of this bar is unique and I really liked it.... it had a unique layout and felt comfortable. 

Since the bar was slow I saw the cook sitting in the back corner smoking cigarettes watching TV and as i ordered, I was sitting there hoping he washed his hands before he prepared my meal... the prices were decent but here's the deal my sandwich did not come with fries if I wanted fries it was $2.99 extra. I am fine with paying extra for fries, but come to find out that extra $2.99 was not for a separate basket or a full order of fries, but for a small handful next to my sandwich which was not worth the extra money by far. The other thing that was not worth the money was the sandwich itself ....it was horribly mediocre and i ended up going somewhere else after I ate the sandwich to get another sandwich i knew was going to be well prepared.

The service by the bartender was quick and attentive and I'm giving this place three stars because of the service and the atmosphere.... but the food was horrible and their slot machines didn't seem to pay (maybe its the dark cloud over my head)

I'm not entirely sure if I'll be back to this place, I really miss the Charlie's Bar on Durango",fCExFIeu2BT35FSx2Yz2aA,1,0,3,50kVFOBSJ75tOwbbN-5QqQ
2543521,2018-05-07,0,vATbGMxLd9cZ3VY_GZAIJw,Lisa is the most disrespectful and unprofessional bartender that I've ever met I was born and raised in Las Vegas Nevada and have never been treated so poorly after gambling $300. I asked for the owners information she refused to give it to me. I'm absolutely embarrassed for her and for the company that she works for someone like that should never be employed in a place where new customers come and will never go again.,L6Y-AJl4ekjQr_SsrblDGQ,0,0,1,-9Fm1hd5VH2M2wbCdOYeFw

My only ""complaint"" would be it's kinda dark in there! I was there for lunch, or really a laaaate breakfast. I liked that there wasn't crazy loud music. I ordered the quesadilla, my aunt ordered the fish taco's and my grandma got the pancake breakfast. Me and my aunt enjoyed ours, very tasty. my grandmother LOVED hers!",8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q,1,0,4,-794GFObBKLnYSqD5lQTPg

It's a cute neighborhood bar with a regular crowd. I liked it!",3f7670ovPXhTH-EyXj5yWA,0,0,5,MKKTHp4KUaOzxt0UAziDdA
