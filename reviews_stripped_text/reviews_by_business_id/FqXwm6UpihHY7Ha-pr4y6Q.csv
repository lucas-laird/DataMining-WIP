We went on the recommendation of Yelpers and it was a truly delicious dinner experience.  The service was attentive and our meals were tasty.  Bonus = we didn't have to go inside a casino or hotel, so it was a quiet and intimate dinner, which is a nice respite from the crowded Strip.

To begin with, the garlic bread was hard to resist, and the salad was really a treat with the delicious marinated tomatoes. 
I had the shrimp parmigiana which was excellent.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and their sauce was one of the best I 've had. My husband had the chicken parmigiana which is his go to dish and was not disappointed.",MfhHWexSTur6HSNj3oDB9w,0,0,4,tSJV6hcoj0BREgbyCeYQsg

The main three items, though, never disappoint and unless I am super hungry, even the lunch portion causes me to take some home with me. 

On this last occasion I arrived for a 1pm lunch meeting with two others. Most of the lunch crowd had cleared out and the waiters were setting up for the dinner hour.

303880,2010-07-19,0,FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q,"I wanted to find a nice Italian restaurant outside of the confines of a hotel-casino.  Thanks to YELP, I found Pasta Mia West and was impressed by the fact that there were 13 reviews ... every one of them was positive ... and they covered a wide array of dates and backgrounds.

The food was excellent.  We ordered a variety of dishes ... veal parmigiana, chicken piccata and a pollo dello chef (chicken of the chef).  Each was served with salad and a side of pasta.  A basket of garlic bread was brought to the table.  The portions were quite large; surprisingly, all of the plates were emptied.

Our experience was marred at the beginning by a special request that was shunned.  One of the members of my party wanted their complimentary side of pasta sauced by a combination of marinara and alfredo.  The waitress indicated that would not be possible without the additional purchase of a side order of pasta ($8.99).

How ridiculous!  All that was wanted was a little alfredo sauce to mix into the marinara which came anyway.  To salvage the mood of the orderer, I agreed to pay the $8.99 and we ended up with a large platter of pasta covered with the desired sauce, together with the side of pasta pomodoro that came with the dinner.

In another minor issue, the salad dressing choices were limited to a house Italian vinaigrette or mix-your-own oil and vinegar.  

The restaurant obviously has a following ...it was busy.  The taste and quality of the food was excellent.  We saw some very interesting daily specials being served to neighboring tables.  A couple of minor things would have made this a perfect evening.",_JfmW4r2z1p-aEU5nZeOkQ,0,0,3,5JZzR5MRwDegNDoa9Xh5bA

The seafood specials were meant to have mussels, clams, scallops, calamari, shrimp, and white fish over linquini, but both were missing the white fish and one was missing the scallops. We didn't mind because both dishes were chock full of seafood and the omitted items weren't missed. The lobster ravioli vodka sauce was very thick and bland and needs something to brighten the simple dish such as a drizzle of fresh basil sauce or some cooked, chopped tomato.

A lot of restaurants in Las Vegas claim to have great Italian food and don't deliver.  Italian food is a tough market for Las Vegas restaurants to set themselves apart.

I was looking at 2 dishes either the puttennesca or a chicken dish. So I asked the waiter what was better and also if the olives in the puttennesca were in fact black olives as stated on the menu or were they kalamata olives like so many dishes have.  
Well the waiter said 'oh they are black olives because that's what the menu says, but I would go with the chicken dish.'i asked how the cappuccinos were and he said good.

I wanted pasta so I opted for the puttennesca because it has black olives not kalamata olives. The dish came and the olives were kalamata olives!

My advice, if you are a waiter learn the menu and don't just say get an item because it costs more so you get bigger tip.  Bad idea.
Not going back and I'm glad I didn't get a cappuccino. Probably premade from a packet.

My mother-in-law heard about Pasta Mia, located across from the Palms Hotel, and wanted to check it out.  We were all game.  Man - was that a great decision.  There's a huge sign that states that a free bottle of house wine will be offered for parties of 4 or more.  Sweet!  And we were attended to by Liz and some of her colleages and they were attentive without being over bearing.  We didn't have appetizers to start because given that we were visiting, we all were expecting to eat our entire dinner portion (no where to take leftovers).  So I don't have any comments to share on the appetizers but the garlic bread was SO GOOD.  Again, so good.  Salad with the homemade dressing was a hit and I was the only one that opted for soup with my meal and that was nice and tasy as well.

When the portions come out, you'll be blown away. Huge portions - definitely enough to share.  My husband had the chicken pesto fettucine, I had the chicken and mushroom pasta (yum) and I can't remember what everyone else had.  But everyone was happy as a clam at the end of the meal.

The sauces were so subtle and flavorful that each bite was a delight... and allowed to melt into my taste buds. The pasta was cooked perfectly, a texture that dissolved readily. Incredulous feelings crept up on me, and I tried the lasagna too... the reward was the same, but a little different spicing. And each was thoroughly enjoyable by its own merits.

The togo boxes they use here r the styrofoam with the flip up lid that dont really seal so they saran wrap the containers and the heat from the food builds up condensation and waters down ur sauce. If u order to go ask for sauce on the side or be prepared for a bit of a mess. Pasta was flavorfull but a bit watered down but I think its because of the wrap job. Fried mozzarella was swimming in the sauce so it was a bit soggy when I finally got to eat it.  I will definetly try the food again but will instead sit down there for dinner.

I liked how this place felt homey and it didn't felt like a restaurant that you just have to order food, eat your food, and leave. I liked how I could relax and just enjoy a nice conversation with my husband and eat delicious food. Their food was so good and for the prices, it was even better! I didn't feel like I was breaking the bank coming here for a yummy Italian meal. 

We ordered the calamari, which came with a bowl of marina dipping sauce. The calamari was fried with light breading. The breading didn't overcome the calamari which I feel like happens to a lot of places, the breading was a bit salty but still good. The marina sauce helped with the salty breading and the lemons they give you along side the calamari helped too. It wasn't too filing either! They gave us just enough to help kick away the hunger pains. The bread they gave us too was hot and crunchy. Who doesn't like warm, crunchy bread?! I know I do. We ordered from the dinner menu. My husband got the cheese ravioli with marina sauce and I ordered the chicken parmigiana. With the meal you either get soup or salad, he got soup. I got salad, his soup was good. Had a nice flavor. My salad was yummy as well. The dressing was something I have never had before, it wasn't too sour like how some Italian dressings can be. It was a good solid side salad. It was lot bigger too. Our entrees came out, his cheese ravioli I liked a little better than my chicken parmigiana, only because I was stuffed from all of our other food. But we shared our entrees. The parmigiana had two big portions of chicken you could totally share this with two people. Both the entrees were delicious. Not too salty, not too overpowered with sauce. It was good dinner food!

 The reason I'm giving this place a 5 star rating is because the food is delicious and you get so much of it. The atmosphere is one that I am happy with. Everyone we dealt with from our hostess to our server was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. We had a happy dinner here!

Their basic house salad is very fresh with a dressing that was so garlicky and good I almost wanted to drink it.

I requested the shrimp scampi to be served with angel hair -- it is normally served here with vegetables and penne pasta on the side.

The service was excellent and I look forward to returning to try many of their other dishes. I don't eat veal, but the way the diner at the next table was gushing about his osso bucco made me wish I could try it.

The appetizer was fried mozzarella cheese. I thought it would be those frozen sticks -- but it was delicious fried triangles of cheese, covered in delicious marinera sauce. The salad and garlic bread were good -- pretty standard, with a great house balsamic vinaigrette. 

The entrees were outstanding. I had the chicken parmesan, which was tender, crispy, and delicious. The portion was too big, and it came with a side of penne pasta. The vodka sauce penne my boyfriend had was really delicious. Everything was obviously homemade. 

The dessert was homemade cheesecake, and it was good. Not mindblowing, but very tasty. The house wines were fine. For $6.95 a glass, a nice drinkable chianti is all I ask for. 

The service was good, but perhaps a slight bit understaffed. For a tip: They have a BUY ONE ENTREE GET ONE ENTREE 1/2 OFF coupon on their website.

I was so shocked I just stood there in disbelief, I asked no what?  He said you can't be in here with a dog,  so I replied,  because we have a service dog, we can't eat here, his reply was no.  I asked about sitting outside being that they have outside seating, he said no you have to go somewhere else.  I was so disgusted with how we were treated and their responses that I felt the need to make this review to let others know Pasta Mia discriminates against people with service animals and possibly against lesbians, since we received such nasty looks before they even saw our service animal.",cJHO3HYFXVolPGcMaiZwgQ,0,0,1,_HEcOSVME6u8yEwPHNQgSw
3155044,2011-08-01,1,FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q,"I need to clarify a couple of things that have been previously posted about Pasta Mia.  

First, when one eats/dines at a nicer restaurant than Denny's, service is usually slower to give the diner time to relax and enjoy the meal and the company they are with.  No one in a nice establishment is going to hurry you through your meal or constantly keep interrupting you with ""Anything else?""  The busboy will keep watch and re-fill glasses of water without interrupting your table conversation.  Trust me, someone IS ""paying attention"" to your table, even though you may not be aware of it.

Second, the food here is incredible and can hold it's own to any upscale, very pricey restaurant on the strip!  If you order Alfredo Sauce be sure you understand that ""all"" real Alfredo Sauce is a heart attack waiting to happen!  Just the same as a McDonald's Big Mac!

We were looking for some Italian food yesterday and happened to pick Pasta Mia because we saw it from the road and it was close to the hotel.  What a fabulous surprise!  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce and I had the angel hair pasta bologense (sp?) (meat) sauce, and a side of Italian sausage.  The food was the best Italian food we have ever eaten - and we have eaten plenty!  It even beat out my own Italian cooking (this is very hard for me to admit).

If you have time for a leisurely meal and love good Italian food, then I would certainly give Pasta Mia a try and form your own opinion.  I am glad we did!",Wkov9p6qK-ZN_zU0XJoFOg,2,1,5,fq8s6gkaiiWnloSqXFpU0Q

House salad had a weird taste and the dressing, flavorless outside of garlic. 

We continued with a lasagne ($19) and chicken picatta ($22). Again, both were lacking in flavor. The side of penne pomodoro for the chicken wasnt a good match. The sauce was super watery and didn't stick to the pasta.

The food is so good! The complimentary garlic bread is delicious! The dressing that comes with the side salads is very tasty. On my most recent visit I had the linguini with clams. I am always hesitant to try this dish at new places, because there is another Italian place that does a version of it which is one of my all time favorite dishes.

Hidden in a dark little strip mall near the Palms, Pasta Mia did not disappoint.  The caprese salad was LOADED with fresh mozz and perfectly ripe tomatoes.  Dinner came with a shared salad that was mostly a bowl of some of the most delicious lettuce greens I've ever tasted... it was like I'd just picked it up myself at an organic market.  And we enjoyed our dinners as well (including veal francese, lobster ravioli, and the gnocchi).

About the gnocchi, I've almost completely sworn off ordering gnocchi out because it's consistently mediocre, or worse.  But when our server mentioned that it was made in house and as an Italian, she highly recommended it, I changed my order from the orange roughy to take a chance on the gnocchi.  I was not disappointed.  It was as fresh as homemade, cooked perfectly, and the sauce was quite flavorful.

If you're vacationing in Vegas and need a break from the hotel/casino restaurants, this is a good bet for some tasty Italian.  The menu is short and pretty basic Tuscan, but there's a long list of interesting specials, and I always take that as a good sign.

Also, we slipped in about 20 minutes before closing, and in some restaurants, when you arrive towards the end of the evening, you get the dregs in terms of food and service.  That was definitely not the case here, so bonus points for that.

Finally, I ordered a glass of chianti, and it was shaky, but that's not unusual for a glass of house chianti and frankly, I should have known better.  If you want wine, you're probably better off selecting a bottle here.",tYXmFkgbuUqtndYO48YHQA,1,0,4,dg0rbKh3vbHuZUHtObAnOw

Their starter salad is perfect, zingy, and the dressing tries to compel me to lick the bottom of the bowl.

The garlic bread is serviceable, but it's free and plentiful and I can't complain even if it is a little dry. Besides, I can use it to ""lick up"" the salad dressing for me!

However, tonight stunk. The chicken Marsala, while edible, was never cooked off...tasted like raw wine was poured in...and because we had a Groupon as a gift this time, we didn't complain. 
I am celiac and work around menus. I ordered the Lasagna Bolognaise, with its rich description of cheeses and ricotta layers...I knew I could find what I liked and push the noodle aside. It...however...had zero ricotta and was 80% noodle and thick, oily meat sauce. A starchy bechamel hovered and looked like Elmer's glue.
So, we showed Liz the menu's description and she gladly served me a wonderful appetizer of eggplant, calamari and roasted peppers.
However, insulted us at check time with an $8 fee for salad (that comes with entrees). 
I could agree with this if the entrees passed muster, but, they no longer do. Which forced me to order an appetizer to replace the lousy entree.

Both lunches came with choice of soup or salad.  We each got the salad which came with a creamy Italian.  It was good.  Each lunch came with rigatoni with red sauce.  The sauce was good--nothing exceptional but there was certainly nothing wrong with it.  We passed on getting any dessert.  What was served was more than enough for lunch.  My iced tea was refilled without asking and my friend's water glass was refilled.

Lunch was $10.99 each and they took the coupon from their menu page (buy one entrée and get half off a second entrée).

4237428,2014-05-10,1,FqXwm6UpihHY7Ha-pr4y6Q,"There are two things that are hard to find in Las Vegas. 

Authentic and good Chinese and Italian Food. I'm not the only one that says that. I have an acquittance from Italy, and know many native Chinese people who live in 
Las Vegas, who say the same. 

Pasta Mia is NOT New York or San Francisco quality, but it is decent for Las Vegas.

My first suggestion is to get there early or make reservations. It fills up fast. 

They bring you out a loaf of house garlic bread, and it is excellent. They charge about $3 for a second loaf, but it is well worth it. 

The service is good, and they do seem to have a good selection of wines. 

The pasta and sauces are acceptable, but not worth ""singing"" over. 

This is a good place to take the family when you are craving pasta. 

If you are trying to impress someone with your knowledge of Italian food, go on line and see when Southwest has a sale to San Francisco, or Jet Blue is going to 
New York.  You just can't get great Italian food in Las Vegas.",QvLg2kxqHHahxxOlHlEIZw,1,1,3,bPaKlqe_u1wKy10mdnL6pQ

Unfortunately they get a -2.5 star. for service leaving them at the lowest 1 star that Yelp allows. Only way I could describe it was rude and unprofessional. We got there 2 minutes after the doors opened and were the third table seated. Asked for a highchair right when we were seated. 15 minutes later and still no highchair. We finally asked the busboy and got the highchair. Then we had to ask for bread which all the other tables got within minutes of sitting down. After that we ordered and then we sat for nearly an hour while other tables that arrived after us received their entrees. We got a spaghetti bolognese and a lasagna bolognese so neither were complicated orders. Not once did we even get asked if we wanted more water. My husband made it a point to make eye contact with the waiter and busboy whenever they passed us. They'd just look away and continue helping everyone else but us. Finally my husband went and spoke with the owner/manager who was extremely apologetic. He went back to the kitchen and within minutes we had our food that I reviewed above. But the waiter just kinda abruptly put the plates down and again he was gone helping everybody but us. Never asked if there was anything else we needed. Just dropped the plates off and left. Once I noticed the middle of my lasagna was cold I asked again to speak with the manager and explained to him that not only was my food cold and we'd waited an hour but the wait staff straight up acted like we weren't even sitting there. The manager was wonderful and even comp'd the whole meal (which we didn't expect) for the trouble and said he'd talk to his staff. Apparently he did because within minutes the waiter came out with an attitude saying ""I did not ignore you, you saw I was busy"" granted business did pick up a little bit but neither I nor the owner thought it was busy. The waiter then proceeded to snatch up our plates and walk away never even asking if we wanted to take leftovers home. The busboy followed not even a minute later and refilled my water without saying a word but by that point the meal was over. I waited a couple minutes to see if they'd wrap the food and they didn't the manager was by the door so I again said something. The waiter said ""i didn't know you wanted them"" ...well buddy you never asked! He went and found our to go bag and we left but not after the manager again profusely apologized and asked us to please give them another chance in the future. We likely won't be back because we're not local.

The only person who's service got a 5 star was the manager. He was wonderful and went above and beyond to make up for the terrible service of the rest of his staff.

My 19 dollar chicken picatta was basically chicken breast swimming in a soup with some cheap veggies on the side (a whole stock of celery,  boiled potato slice, and carrots) - I was expecting it to come with pasta. Instead I get a side of macaroni doused in some bland tomato sauce. Garlic bread tasted bland.. is that seriously possible? I'm not kidding. I love garlic, it tastes like straight up plain bread. I'm just so disappointed, considering how much money I spent. This tastes like some sub par, fake Italian restaurant food (not going to name names) and I'm really confused by the reviews I just read.

The two Italian restaurants frequented by us are Pasta Mia and Nora's.  Nora's is always my first choice, but I seem to be the only one with that mindset.

One thing I will say is that Pasta Mia is consistent.  But for me, that means consistently average.  Sauces are runny and don't stick to pasta; garlic bread is crunchy in an unpleasant way; getting your check can be the slowest part of the meal; servers are good about keeping on top of things; there are plenty of daily specials to keep things intereste; etc.  Yes, that was a list of both positive and negative things I experience, but it should be noted that I experience these things on a regular basis.

Nothing has wowed me, or even satisfied me, enough for me to wake up one day and say to myself, ""Self, you need to eat at Pasta Mia today.""  You're not doing yourself a disservice if you eat here, but you can be doing yourself a favor if you decide to go down the street to Nora's.  Does that make sense?

My GF's  Fettucine with shrimp and mushrooms in a pink sauce was dreadful. Too much sauce (seems to be the house style), too much cream in the sauce, and pretty small tough chewy shrimp, without much taste. Not many shrimp thankfully but it was $24.00!!!

Looked out on the outside patio which you can sit at when the weather is not so hot.  

Mom and I each had a glass of sauvignon blanc which was very low cost compared to most places.  My mom hates paying $15 for a glass of wine.  Here is more reasonable around $9. Meals start with soup or salad.  My uncle and I had the basic green salad, mom had the soup which I think was minestrone.  

For entrees, I had the veal piccata.  It was really tasty.  Nice tender veal with a lemony butter sauce, lots of mushrooms and capers.  And a side of veggies - potato, carrot and broccoli - nicely cooked.  Also all entrees came with a side of penne with tomato sauce.  The sauce was tasty.  My tomato flavor, not too heavy.

We have a 2 year old and an 8 month old and  I want to make sure the restaurant welcomes kids and always book 4:30 or 5:00 reservations so as to not infringe on prime time dining with possibly noisy children.  (Emphasis on POSSIBLY as these kids and parents have it together, but you never know)  I also tip 20% plus depending on how we are treated.  Our reservation for 5 adults and 2 kids in highchairs was 2 weeks ago on a Sunday at 4:30.   We were slightly late and restaurant staff wasn't bothered about that.
  We were approached by our waiter, an older, white male, frail looking, white hair, with a thick accent.  We could feel and tell immediately he was not happy at all we were there.  Obviously he disagrees with management that children are welcome.   He dragged an easel over to our table and set up a specials menu for our viewing.  The glare from the windows we were facing made the menu seem as if it was in the dark and I couldn't read it.  Very clumsy at our table and others I saw him taking it to.  He did tell us verbally of the specials and then left without asking us our beverage order.  Some time later, a bit too long, our complete order was taken.
Our service from there was just fair and the food for my family was judged the same.  Our beverages were brought first as they should have been, but refills were a problem.  A picture of iced tea was brought to my son and daughter in law, but my daughter and hubby, the parents of the kids weren't offered refills for their sodas.  My daughter politely asked for refills and was given a very snippy reply, but did eventually get the refills.  I had wine and a glass of water but wasn't asked if I wanted another of either when both were empty part way through the meal.  I would have ordered another wine IF I could have gotten the waiters attention, but settled for a water refill from the busboy as he was clearing our dinner plates.  Food came to us at an appropriate pace but we weren't checked on until we were almost done.  Again, we all thought the food was just fair.  I'm not sure if that was because of the tone the waiter set when he first approached us and made us feel most unwelcome.  He seemed harried and too stressed to keep up with the demands of his customers.  Our dining experience sucked and none of us will return.
As I said before, I take my family out once a month.  Capos restaurant ""More business info"" section said not good for kids.  I called because I really wanted to take my family there.  They assured me that kids were welcome and we had a wonderful experience last year.  Food and service was great, and we were treated like royalty. I like to find new places to go and enjoy  taking my kids and grand kids to restaurants they probably couldn't afford so finer dining is on my list.  Unfortunately, Pasta Mia West let us down and treated us as if we smelled and shouldn't have been there.

This Italian place is seriously a hidden gem in Vegas. I never knew it was here until I found the groupon! So boyfriend and I decided to take a look and check it out.

It's hidden in the corner so look for it! It's pretty big on the inside. We were seated really quickly. It kind of took a while for the waiter to grab our drink order though. He also took the orders of these people who came in after us, and my boyfriend definitely knew I would yelp about that. Then, the busser came with water and garlic bread (we got it before those girls did) and the bread was SOO good. The other yelpers weren't lying! You definitely need to dip it inside the oil base that they provide you on the table. I am really craving some right now as we talk about it.

So, I listened to the previous reviews and ordered the calamari. It. Was. Delicious. It's super crunchy and probably the best calamari I've ever had. It definitely did not disappoint me. They also give you a HUGE bowl of dipping sauce which, for me, is GREAT cause I like to smother my food with sauce (and usually when I get calamari elsewhere I would have to ask for extra sauce multiple times, lol). 

Now to the pasta. My boyfriend got chicken marsala and I got the spicy pasta! They were both mouth watering. Once again, smothered with sauce so no problem with flavor there. The pasta was cooked very nicely. And I was just amazed by the quality of the food!

Until we received the bill, I thought the place was alright. I had forgiven the fact that the waiter spilled water all over my friend's wife's hands .. Twice.

The chicken parm and gnocchi was pretty delicious, I must say. I tried my friend'a chicken marsala and it, besides the carrots and broccoli that came with it, was pretty lousy.

Things turned very sour when we got the bill. My buddies Marsala and my parm each included a side of spaghetti. He asked if there was an upcharge to switch to angel hair. They said no we can substitute it. I ordered next and didn't ask about an upcharge, but asked if I could swap for gnocchi. The guy said sure. My friends wife changed her spaghetti, to one with a meat sauce. Again, no mention of an additional costs.

When the bill came, there was an $8 charge for meat sauce and $9 for gnocchi. The server played dumb with us so we asked for the manager... I calmly explained that wanted substitutions and had no intentions of paying for an upgrade. We were never made aware that we would be spending an additional $17 (the price of one full dinner) on substitutions. I also explained that any server I've ever encountered told us when additional fees apply to substitutions and ask if it's okay....

Her response?

""Well, did you eat it already?""

I couldn't believe it. I've never met such an arrogant manager who didn't hear us out. We had already spent $100 on the meal, it wasn't about the money. It was about the fact that they failed to acknowledge that they charge heavily for substitutions.

Let me just say this first, if there was an Italian restaurant I don't mind spending a little more money for good food, it would be at Pasta Mia. 

The service was quick and sharp as they refilled our water when it was half empty. At the right time, they'll ask if we needed anything else. The food came out quick too which was a bonus. 

My girlfriend and I had the meaty lasagna which was so good! It was saucy just the way I liked it and super cheesy. If there was a little bit more pasta with it, I would've been happy but I can't complain; it really satisfied my pasta cravings. 

We also got mozzarella sticks which weren't sticks at all. It was beautifully plated as it was embedded in sauce. Absolutely delicious and I highly suggest to order it if you're looking for a good appetizer. I'm not sure about the sauce, but whatever it is they're doing, it's absolutely perfect. 

At the beginning of your meal, they offer garlic bread which was not as good as I thought. Save room for the real food because this garlic bread isn't gonna do justice for you.
