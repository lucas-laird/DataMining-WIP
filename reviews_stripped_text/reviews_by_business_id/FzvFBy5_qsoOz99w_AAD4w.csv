We like our pho with egg noodles which is usually an additional $1 extra (Jenni Pho, Annie Pho, China town, etc...). This place charges $2 extra, we were blown away! Not that it was a deal breaker, but for a cost spiked way more than the better pho places even the ones in the casinos, we were at least expecting quality. Epic fail! Owner or management needs a reality check on their product quality this place will never be a standing wait room kind of place like the Ramen Kobo that just opened on Durango/215. Waste of money, time, and a disappointment. I can't say we never gave it a chance, we tried it twice there will NOT be a third time!",eehTX2tvKForsYHBSsj0eg,0,0,1,pJLnGy9ZKMNXd5DTkQhFmA

Our waiter was attentive and cheerful and food came out quickly. Great price for everything you get.

The place is not very big, thus I can only assume it would be better to go during non-busy hours to avoid long wait times and ease of getting a table.

Definitely try eating your pho with the Hoisin and spicy Sriracha sauce, either putting directly into your pho or, as I like to do, i put it in a small sauce bowl and dip my noodles and meat in before eating to get more sauce :))

Second time I ordered it, admittedly it was around 11:15 am so maybe the soup broth didn't have enough time to steep, but it was very flavorless.

Also tried their red curry dish, but after a few spoonfuls did not try any more. It was watery and not like the red curry flavors from Archi's, Pin Kaow, etc.

A big plus would be if they offered delivery, but at the moment, dine in or pickup only. Friendly service over the phone though.  Good for when you're in the mood for some pho in the Mountain's Edge area, but too lazy to drive too far for it.

925494,2017-07-31,0,FzvFBy5_qsoOz99w_AAD4w,"Ok so I've come to realize this place is actually half Vietnamese food (pho) and half Thai since they have diff flavors of pho and also Thai dishes such as pad Thai, papaya salad, etc. I ordered the panang curry with chicken as my usual go to for Thai food and I was a little disappointed here. My panang curry flavor was right.. kinda but what made it a disappointing experience was the fact that it came out like a soup! I've included a video of how watery it is. Oh and it came with onions.. which panang doesn't usually but I thought it was fine bc you can throw just about any vegetables my way and I would enjoy it except when it's a raw onion... and I love onions. Just not the raw ones. I really want to like this place since it's nearby my neighborhood but I can't. I've been here 3x and each time I try to give it a chance and get something new and hope for the best but every single time it tastes like fast food. Or like.. no love put into their food kinda thing. The pho is very bland. Even with a ton of fresh squeezed lime. The crab Rangoon just tastes like nothing special. Maybe if they would get a better wrap or thinner or something. I can't put my finger on it. The Thai tea I've got once and never again! And I absolutely love Thai tea. Sigh. Ok well the only thing that i did enjoy here is the spring rolls. I like how the noodles in the spring rolls are super thin. And I'm glad the peanut sauce is good.

928261,2017-10-19,1,FzvFBy5_qsoOz99w_AAD4w,"Between the cute name and the fact that it's not strictly a Vietnamese place (it's half Vietnamese and half Thai), my expectations were not high. But so deep is my phobession that I'm always looking for new places to add to the rotation, some variety, something different, and when I finally tried it I came away very impressed. I've been coming here regularly ever since. This place is not merely worthy of inclusion on the pho rotation; it's one of my favorite places on the list.

Their pho broth is very good, a bit clearer and leaner than average for the area, and the regular beef pho is very good. Note that they use beef broth exclusively, even in the chicken pho--no vegetarian pho is offered, so if that one annoying friend is with you, you'll need to hit Pho 88 or Red Lantern or Pho Kim Long.

Their shrimp pho is the best I've had. It's not really traditional; it includes several extra vegetables, and the shrimp are not served with the tails still on, a mildly annoying thing other places do. This is The Place for shrimp pho; it's fantastic.

They also do a pork combination pho, embellished with the inclusion of a poached egg, which is interesting and different. There are several pork pho options on the menu including pork belly.

The chicken pho is very good despite using beef broth. I usually balk at chicken pho with beef broth, but here, it's worth eating.

As noted, they also have a lot of Thai food on the menu, none of which I have tried so I can't speak to it.

Service is a lot better than most pho places, since again, it's not strictly a Vietnamese place. I'm so white that I can't really tell the difference, but I think the waitresses are Thai. They are very friendly and attentive and you will never be sitting there trying to get someone's attention like you do at most pho places.

One thing to consider: they are closed on Sundays and major holidays like Labor Day. It's always the same people working so it's probably just that they don't have the staff for everyone to have a day off.

One strange thing is that they don't have little dipping dishes on the table. The hoisin and sriracha and chile paste are there, but no dishes. They have them, and will give you one if you ask, but really--all you're doing by not having the dishes on the table is encouraging the barbaric practice of dumping the sauces into the broth!

Also, they always give me a fork. Maybe because I'm white?",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,2,2,5,iL8L3Mlg7mUkuAbr2C61bQ

At least the presentation was nice. The pho broth was good. Nothing distinctive about it that made it really stand out for me. I wish they added more beef balls though. As far as their service, they were pretty quick to sit and serve me. They also constantly checked up on me to see how I was doing. One random fact about this place, they charge $2 for non-customers to use their restroom. Though I'm not really sure how they enforce this rule. I'm just glad that there's a pho place that's close.

I've personally seen this place many times while traveling up/down Blue Diamond and had been curious. I believe they have a food truck with the same name? 

Came here on a Tuesday, around noon. Empty restaurant. Uh oh. 

Music, quite random. had a lot of old-ish songs which brought back memories, then you have new songs. Lol 

Looked at menu after sitting with my friend who was there already. So apparently its a viet and thai place? 

i wanted to try their quality of pho, so i opt'ed for the combination pho, which pretty much included everything. 

soup base was a bit bland. not enough flavor. not looking for saltiness or richness but the flavor you get from like boiling various bones for hours. The meat was stacked and clumped together. a bit overcooked. i noticed its the same meat used in my friends drunken noodles too. whats funny is i noticed a coloring or reflection on the beef while i was eating it. Apparently its not because its spoiled or anything, but it just so happens light hits it at the right angle, and diffracts the light, causing a pearly/gem/rainbow color. kind of a fun fact. XD 

my friend had ordered drunken noodles. didn't really try much since i was full from my pho, but i had one noodle. Drunken noodles is supposed to be spicy, flavored with chili, fish sauce, soy sauce, etc but for some odd reason. This version of drunk noodles from this restaurant had a sweet element to it too. The first thing i thought of was hoisin sauce. and no it was not from my pho, because i didnt use any hoisin or sriracha. weird to taste hoisin in drunken noodles. 

Overall, this place is ok. Probably won't come back (since i dont live on this side of town anyway) and there are better ones nearby.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,2,0,3,xdV8HcrcarbYJFC6eDk8dA

We ordered veggie egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls for appetizers, and they were pretty good, except the shrimp didn't seem too fresh. 

Sadly not really. I read reviews before choosing this place and figured like every other Thai or Vietnamese place in Vegas, mixed reviews are pretty standard. But the negative reviews on this place were spot on. 

I got the beef brisket and flank soup, and the meat was nowhere near as tender as it should have been, and definitely had a weird color. Hubby got the beef combination and in his words ""WTPho is WTSuck."" The broth was very plain.. Had to add tons of sauce and sriracha to give it any flavor. Needless to say, next time we're craving pho it won't be satisfied here. 

On to the good.. Service was excellent! They were quick to refill our drinks and asked multiple times how we were doing, so they get stars for that. And then dessert.. Tempura ice cream. How can you ever go wrong? Delicious :)

1462546,2014-05-20,9,FzvFBy5_qsoOz99w_AAD4w,"Ugh..   I really, really wanted this place to work out.

They just opened up a few weeks ago and are literally around the corner from my house.  I kept driving by eagerly awaiting opening day as Pho joints on the SW side have really dropped the ball.   I finally got to try their Veggie Pho today, and, let's just say, I've experienced better at some of the chains that are considered really bad.

The food in itself has a lot of promise.  The broth wasn't as greasy or salty as most.  There weren't many veggies provided in my VEGGIE pho and the ones that were provided weren't very clean.  All in all, the flavor was decent..  There was just one problem.  One rather BIG problem.  I found three hairs in my Pho.  I'm a blonde and the hairs were black.  Clearly, not mine.  It sucks.  Hair is an instant meal ruiner.  Once discovered, the meal is over.   O-V-E-R.  OVERRR!  Sucks.

I also ordered their iced Thai Tea, which was delicious and the fried banana ice cream, which is pretty much impossible to mess up. The Panang Curry was delicious as well.  Great flavor.  It's just those damn hairs.  I get the shakes just thinking about them.

What do we need to do to get a great Pho joint?  I've tried places all over the valley and there's always something that ends up going horribly wrong.  I was really excited for this new place to open up as I figured they would have a new fresh product and would probably cook with some excitement.  At least for the first six months.

WTPho, may I please suggest hair nets or at least pulling hair back as a requirement?  All would have been wonderful if those three hairs didn't show up.  Now I sit, hungry and grossed out.   Also, when a customer orders the meatless Pho option, can I suggest providing more veggies?

I'm hoping these kinks will be worked out.  Keeping hair out of the food is like cooking 101.  Once I can get over the hairs, I might give WTPho one more try and an updated review..",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,9,4,2,SgLVhtJk4datXI5aUQRykg

This little joint have been here for a while and good for them, I have not been here yet myself because of all the bad reviews and from all of my friends telling me to eat somewhere else. But I finally gave in because I really really wanted Laos food and they were super close to my house. Since the people are Thai and not Viet they were able to accommodate. 

Kay and the rest of the staff is super nice and surprisingly the food is pretty good. I didn't get the pho because a lot of people have said that their pho is exactly that WTF! I can't say for myself so I will not talk about their pho but for them to have pork pho umm ok and then they throw egg in it so weird. Anyhow I came for the Lao food so let's get down to it. First the Waterfall steak is an off the menu item and Kay made it so good just plain oh beef slices but she marinade with all the spices, lime onion and cilantro and it was so good. The red curry was really really good I got it with pork and the bamboo made it so bomb. The jerky was fried to a perfect chew and crispness accompanied by the sticky rice and dipping sauce made all worth it to me because it reminded me of my moms home cooking and it really hit the spot. Then she was so nice to do the papaya salad Laos style for me but that came out super salty and had a slight awkward smell to it. I didn't like it much actually I couldn't stomach it. I should have ordered it her Thai style I'm sure it would have been way better and delicious next time. 

All in all I think I will definitely be back for their food the pho I will have to try to find out if I should continue to stay away from it or not.

Service 5/5
Food 4/5

First things first, the atmosphere is alright. A bit too bland for me, it just comes off sorta like, I don't know, like a hospital cafeteria. A bit weird, but that's how I would describe it.

Service was excellent, the server was extremely attentive. Although I WAS the only guest, so I guess you could take that rating with a grain of salt.

Food wise: surprisingly good. The curry wonton is awesome. The wonton itself is alright, but the panang curry dipping sauce it comes with is TO DIE FOR. I seriously downed three servings of it, it's that good. The pho's broth surprised me. It was flavorfful, although a bit on the flat side in terms of seasoning, it was good enough to compliment the extremely spicy sauce on their rack. The portioning of meat/noodles was beyond what I would expect for a pho restaurant, all in all, outstanding.

Check this place out, it's a nice and new startup. Needs a refresher course on marketing and they could be the next big thing in the Mountain's Edge area :-)

Edit:  **Improved atmosphere. 4/5 

The broth is as good as ever. Pricing and portioning could do with some tweaking. Either give more for the current price or charge less for the current portioning. 

Im not naive so I can assume it's because the location is really nice and they have to pay a lot, but dang, it's hard to justify spending that much money for a bowl of good pho in Las Vegas where good pho is a dime a dozen.

We ordered the curried wontons with panang curry as a dip. It reminded me of one of those crappy, frozen appetizers you get from the market. The curry was watery and hardly any stuffing inside the wonton. 

I ordered the pho. The meat seemed old and not the best quality. The broth was bland too. My husband got one of their curry dishes. It was watery too.

The server gave me the impression that she hated her job. It's not easy waiting tables but at least fake a smile.

Great Thai tea. No boba. 

The pad Thai w chicken added is my favorite so far. Flavor on point and still full of tofu and veggies. 

I've tried two salads and three Pho's: broth perfect. I think I like the tonkotsu? Pork? Not an expert but very much a fan. The lime and spice in glass noodle salads are perfect, too.

I was feeling a little under the weather today and really wanted some pho. Now, I usually go to Jenni Pho or Annie Pho but most of the time, their broth isn't consistent. Some days, it'll be great but more often than not, it's passible. So, this place came up in my suggestions and I was a little skeptical because of its name--in California, there are places like this that basically serve food that looks good but the taste is horrible. Yet, the reviews pulled me in. 

I ordered pick up because I don't want to be eating there alone by myself lol. Now, I am writing this AS I AM EATING and boy, this broth is delicious. The broth alone made me break out my laptop and write this review. Like finally, someone got it right! I got one rare steak pho (Pho Tai) and the cream cheese rangoons. You can't go wrong with the rangoons. This pho is great. All the flavors are right AND they put cilantro in their pho--some places here don't, I really like cilantro. In all honesty, I've decided to make this my regular pho place after just one bowl of pho. Not to mention, the place itself is very clean.

Service is still memorable in my books. They check up on you just enough, not where they make you feel like they're rushing you out or doing too much. They always have a smile on their face and truly look like they enjoy their jobs. They are very family oriented and I say this because they sometimes have a child hanging out with them and it seems like these folks have known each other all their lives (even if they haven't). Even when they get busy, the service is still like you're the only people in the restaurant.

I have had great pho in every city I've ever visited and that is a whole lotta pho. I was drawn to this establishment because of the clever name. Once entering, you'll notice that everything is very clean and very open. The tables line mostly the borders of the restaurant with a few small tables in the center. It kind of reminded me of a fast food chinese restaurant. I became wary right away. I immediately noticed that my favorite appetizer was not on the menu. No egg rolls. Yeah...those delicious vietnamese egg rolls that you wrap with lettuce and dip in sweet fish sauce? None. There were no spring rolls either. So I continue to browse the menu and notice that it is more of a vietnamese/thai restaurant. I ordered the wontons with curry as my appetizer thinking it would be some type of fusion food. I also ordered the Vietnamese staple, beef pho. The boyfriend ordered a chicken pho. He's very White-American and doesn't know any better. I don't know why, but I had expected some actual dumpling-style wontons, but we got some fried wonton chips with a tiny dish of watery curry. Disappointing. I was served before my boyfriend was. I thought it was because it took longer to cook the chicken..or something, or maybe there was smaller stock of chicken broth/soup since most people order beef pho. I guess it just took longer to cook the chicken because he still got bowl of beef pho, just with chicken pieces instead of slices of beef. There was something about the noodles that just didn't taste right. Like, they purchased the packages of dried rice noodles instead of using freshly made rice noodles. It just wasn't good. I didn't think you could go wrong with a bowl of pho since it is such a basic food (like fried rice), but you can. If I ever go back, it would only be because it is literally across the street from my housing community. Perhaps the Thai food will be better.",F0nR2cEBLSZtBb2hlxnpoA,0,0,2,xZBq0MDv9H_zH6ihaZ5AkQ

The Shrimp Spring rolls are also fabulous.
 I do need to add, I've never tried anything else, so I can't comment on the other menu items, we are hoping they will decide to add they cold vermicelli dishes available at traditional Pho restaurants. A bit of a disappointment there, but that's ok, when that what we want, we go somewhere else, Thank you WTPho !!",1fOC_b_x82lALBkFhXKOcA,0,0,5,RMvDcO22XtBAYwKEV4bfww

I've had pho at restaurants all over Las Vegas and I truly believe I get twice the amount of food at most other places for the same price as I pay here. They were very stingy on the raw steak in the pho. So I asked for an extra side of it for $2.50. I received 3 tiny pieces of raw steak. Pretty ridiculous.

I did notice most of the food was Thai which was a bit forboding but went ahead and ordered the crab wontons, curry wontons, a bowl of pork belly and poached egg pho for me and the hubs got a bowl of meatball and two poached eggs pho. 

Crab wontons were so cutely folded, not sure how they do that or if they're made in a factory, but the sauce tasted homemade. The curry sauce was to die for!!! I could've made a meal out of that alone.

Then the main show, the pho. Holy crap. The broth was light and not as complex as some places, I agree, but it was inoffensive and just so perfect with a squeeze of lime and a couple a jalapeños. With the poached egg (which were perfect) it just brought it to epic levels. I didn't hear a peep from my husband for fifteen minutes as he slurped his way through both noodles and broth (pretty amazing feat for him). The egg and pork belly was so perfectly cooked; not even 99% of ramen places get this right to this level.

The broth was exceptional. I really enjoyed the broth so much that I drank it all literally to the last drop.

There were enough Thai basil, sprouts, and jalapeno to go with it.

4151326,2014-04-24,0,FzvFBy5_qsoOz99w_AAD4w,"My boyfriend & I went here for the first time yesterday since it opened. It opened very recently & is very close to the gym we workout at, so we thought we'd give it a try. I'll admit, it wasn't the best experience we've had, but we've also had worse. 

We walked in & was greeted by one of their waiters saying that we can take a seat wherever we wanted. I'd say it was a nice place, small but clean. Nothing too special about the interior. 

The service however wasn't up to par. Our order was taken by a Hispanic gentleman. In no way am I racist, but that language barrier can really be difficult to overcome. My boyfriend & I noticed that when we took our order & the order of other customers close by. The staff was friendly, but I believe they were not trained well enough just yet. 

Our order took much longer than expected. We ordered their Shrimp Spring Rolls as an appetizer, I got the Beef Pho, & my boyfriend ordered the Salmon Curry. The spring rolls came out pretty quickly, as we would expect of a simple appetizer. However it took maybe 20-30 minutes for our entrees to come out. Unfortunately the owner had to come out from behind the kitchen & ask us what we had ordered, since we were sitting there for so long. It turned out that our order was accidentally placed as to-go & was just sitting there for a good while. 

What saved what seemed to be a very bad experience was that the owner gave our meal for free because it had taken so long to bring out. He was extremely apologetic about the whole thing. But enough about the service, on to the food. 

Shrimp Spring Rolls: They weren't the most amazing rolls out there, & I'll be brutally honest, they were a bit plain. The shrimp to noodle ratio wasn't balanced. There was definitely too much noodles & our rolls fell apart when we ate them. The peanut sauce wasn't all that great either & wasn't spicy like the menu said it was. 

Beef Pho: The pho to me was one of the best I've had. It's up to par with Pho Kim Long, which is usually a long time favorite among me & my friends. It wasn't like most places where it's a lot more broth than anything else. They didn't skimp on the noodles & beef, & the beef was seriously DELICIOUS. Some big pieced in there too. 

Salmon Curry: My boyfriend ordered this one. We were skeptical at first because the sauce for the curry was really runny. However the portion size of the salmon itself was actually a good size, better than most restaurants who like to serve smaller portions because salmon can be so expensive. But at only $11 for the salmon, side of broccoli, & rice, we weren't complaining. The taste of the dish was a WHOLE differently story. It was SO GOOD. Even though the curry was runny, it tasted amazing. The salmon by itself was flaky & seasoned perfectly. The combination of the two made for a very tasty dish. My boyfriend even liked the broccoli & he HATES eating broccoli. Like with a passion. Needless to say, this dish will probably be a favorite of ours. 

Overall, the restaurant definitely has a to learn. Need to work on the service & organization so that things don't get confused. But what they lacked in their training, they made up for in recognizing their flaws, learning from them, & their tasty dishes. The owner was sweet, so I directly tipped & thanked him for taking care of us. Considering they had just opened up, we weren't too hard on them, & we assured him that we'll definitely be coming back for more.",mJJPSyLVXeKHa0x6rLQ07Q,3,0,3,z4XIQmWBUUqbNbwZvTYnaA

Recently, I noticed the average yelp reviews was 4 stars, so I thought that maybe finally there's a good Pho joint near my house. When I came in, I noticed that Pho was the only Vietnamese food on the menu, most other stuff were Thai food. The name WTPho is very misleading, because it gives the impression that it's a viet restaurant.

Anyway, when you go to a restaurant with the word ""Pho"" in their name, you gotta try Pho, right? I ordered the special combo Pho and it came out pretty fast. Once I saw the bowl, I know it was going to be bad even before trying it. The meats looked really old and has a funky smell (usually associated with old cooked meat) with a slide shade green. I took a couple bites just to confirm my suspicion. The broth itself was very bland and has almost no flavor (no star anise or beefy flavor, just a the spiciness from the cinnamon). I was hungry and I couldn't even eat 1 quarter of it. Overall, Pho was bad. 

The two stars were for their customer service and cleanliness. Unless I'm in the mood for some Thai food, I will not come back here for Pho.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,3,1,2,WdInD_7pGGCjAJxt_uW1Lw

My order was simple and straight to the point since I was craving some pho.  I was surprised that the options were very limited when it came to pho, because pho is in the name of the restaurant.  I asked the server about which type of soup was the most popular and went with his recommendation, the ""Beef Combination Noodle Soup.""

Once home, I opened up my bag and found everything neatly separated.  The broth was still boiling hot and had 3 beef balls thrown in.  The broth was nice and clear, but was lacking richness.  The taste of beef had a very small presence, the broth was dominated by ginger.  Luckily, they provide hoisin sauce, chili sauce, soy sauce and limes for seasoning with your order.  

The rice noodles were perfect.  No complaints there.  Bean sprouts, chopped chives, thinly sliced onion, chopped cilantro and basil leaves are provided as well.  Very fresh.  

The amount of meat provided is small, but no complaints about the quality.  Everything has been cooked in advance with the exception of the rare steak cuts, but it all warms up and cooks a little more if thrown into the broth immediately.

This place is not worth driving across town for, but if you're in the area it's a great alternative to fast food.  This will not be my last visit.

I assumed it was Vietnamese but when I spoke to the server she was Thai and there was Thai food on the menu.. ok nothing wrong with that just threw me off. let's get to the food.

spring rolls(2/5)- was just meh! it was the shabu shabu sesame sauce used for dipping. didn't like it at all. 

beef jerky( 3.8/5)-  served with sticky rice and this was actually pretty good only thing that could've been better was sauce. 

pad see ew shrimp (2/5)- what really turned me off about this was the $12 they charged for this dish. I personally expect this dish to either be done right or you failed in this case you failed. flavor was the main thing here they tried to play safe and make it more sweet than anything.

pho combination and brisket (2.999/5)- I like their pho here. the beef had great marbeling and the tendon was delish. I like how their broth is clear and not greasy but was just a little bland. 

I think this place needs a lot of work to find their niche. I couldn't find myself to give this place a 3 star rating based on their food service was fine but I think for the food we got it was a little pricey. now that I tried this place I'll probably won't eat here again. there's so many better Thai restaurants in Vegas",aWXGwath_dSGPwNdFiy9BQ,5,6,2,qQ_saEQiEY9TrDn95jLW3Q

As a first time customer they have greeted my boyfriend and I and told us we were able to chose our own seats. From there our waiter provided us with our menus and asked for our choice of drink(s) right away. The waiter took less than five minutes to bring our drinks and was ready to take our order. Our waiter gave us recommendations and their all time customer favorites, which I really appreciated as she knew it was our first time there. I ordered the Chicken Pho, rolls, and my boyfriend got fried rice with some type of ribs. 

About 15 minutes later we received our order and presentation wise it was nice. However, we received a little bowl of sauce for our rolls and in the middle of our meal I had to hold off to wait about 10-15 minutes for another small bowl of sauce. Taste was okay, it did not stand out to me as much as I would expect it to but it's like any other Pho soup - it satisfies you. Rolls were hot on the outside but a little cold on the inside. My boyfriend's fried rice was good, especially the ribs. The only problem was the cold rolls and wait time to get a small bowl of sauce. 

Costumer service was average, we had different waiters who served our drinks and took our orders, to delivering our food and giving us refills, and someone else giving us the tab. The first person who was our waiter was very nice but as it came to the others, it was not as exciting as our first waiter. The girl who gave us our tab stood over my boyfriend as he signed the receipt (felt weird and a little pressured that she could see what we plan to tip her, etc.) but we left and no one thanked us as we walked out the door.

The face front not to much to say about it just looks like a normal business. Inside was nice and clean not too much clutter inside. 

There are numerous flower vases on the counter that look as if they were after thoughts to fill in space- alrighty.. Seating is nice and comfy for the allotted time you need to eat PHO

Food- i was a little confused as I was thinking it was a Vietnamese restaurant but when looking at the menu you discover that it also features Thai offerings. The Pho is tasty for being off the Asian parkway. Thai food needs more authentic flavors. I had the drunken fried rice.. There wasnt enough BAM! BOOM! Thai flavor. No need to tone down the traditional flavors!!! C'mon

The staff is very friendly and quick to assist in any fashion you need. I will return to try more things and to see if this review has made it to the lap of the owners! Good job",iRuVZPnyeBpPeLBNZNFtjg,1,3,4,vS9W4V7H27kprGH4h1TAEw

Had the BBQ pork pho with egg noodles (love how they serve egg noodles), ginger chicken, and Thai coffee. Everything was great.

WTPho is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas i have been to pretty much all of them. They are constant every time I have been there over the last year I have been very satisfied with the bowl of pho. The broth is a perfect balance I love the think sliced brisket. I order extra brisket and noodles I would like a large bowl option but most places don't have that option.

Their chicken pho broth is delicious. It has a hint of cinnamon to it that I've never tasted in any other broth but it makes theirs really special. The addition of mushrooms and bok choi in the chicken pho makes it truly delicious. 

I have only tried their pho so I cannot speak to anything else on their menu but I have never been disappointed. I only do pick up orders and I think the majority of their business is that way because the restaurant is never packed when I go in. 

They give a generous portion of all the add ins and a generous serving of protein with your soup. The chicken isn't dry like some of the other pho places I've been to. Try it soon!",WnheFaHC4RyDNTf6scisyg,4,1,3,CkAiU_ED3uaeGU9D0rn1tg

I get their steamed tofu Pho and love their crab rangoons and shrimp spring rolls! I've also had their chicken and mushroom Pho and enjoyed that as well!! The food is always marvelous!
