Anyways. This is the first time I'm trying anything like this. I saw it on a friend's FB page and had to try it.  It was actually good. It reminds me of the Mexican candies...the spicy ones on a stick. Not sure what they are called...but it tastes like that. Lol.  So it's just mangos in that sauce and a scoop of ice cream. Mango ice cream. I'm sure you can ask for another flavor if you like they have other flavors.  

The mango wasn't hard...it did get that way later because of the ice cream but that's reasonable. And it want sour or to mushy...you know the overly ripe ones. But it was nice.  I did have the ice cream melt a bit and used the straw to eat this.  I did use the fork to eat most of the mangos first...but...good find.  

Now I have to go back and try the crepes I saw on the menu...

Btw min $5 charge to use your card. That's fine because this drink is $5 and some change. :) just fyi though. And small place. Only a few tall tables...worth a try if you haven't already.",wKF94_BSlODc_v17hDZ9sw,1,1,4,ZNvWp35dzSORdfMjXYT-Nw

There are different variety of desserts from popsicles and ice cream to strawberry water and crepes. Great service and the place is really clean.

I usually order the corn with covered with mayo and mexican spice. I think its called Elotes. The other thing I get is the fruit with the spices. If you havent tried it, try it. Its BOMB! and its all BARATO LOL

The lady taking orders spoke perfect english, which was great to see. I'm sure that will really help their business. its always best to have someone bilingual. 

Prices went up. $1 each item. Not a huge price hike but enough for me to notice. I'm sure thats something they had to do because of grocery prices going up. So its okay with me. 

Everything was delicious like always. I will continue to come back and praise them to everyone we see. Yum yum in my tum tum.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,5,4,5,xqLjII8TP6-HpzVKVAEcsw

I wanted a cold treat but not the usual ice cream in a cup thing, that was for my little girl. I came across cremosas, which caught my eye. I was going to go for a safe and easy strawberry flavor which had fresh strawberries in it but the nice lady pointed another choice which had nuts on top. I'm not a fan of desserts with nuts but I trusted her. I'm sooo glad I did :-D Ohhh boy was that good! She put sweetened condensed milk on the bottom of the cup then added whip cream. The flavor reminded me of a pecan praline taste :-) I was instantly hooked.

My mom ordered strawberry crepas, it seemed thin/plain, but she shared with me and it tasted good. Not too sweet, not too much whip cream. 

While we were ordering, I felt as if the lady was rushing us so she could sit in the back room again. There were no other customers, so I don't get it.

I would come back if I were in the area, but only to try the rest of their menu.",nbLYmUvi9uYIZy64TvcRyw,1,1,3,aGNFkNOkNU_yPrWoG6hVpg

3630471,2014-12-29,0,xgWRBPr3k8iJp10cZE9GHw,"This hidden gem is located off Decatur Blvd and Twain Ave, close by Chinatown. My boyfriend calls it ""Hispanic Village"" due to having a well known (but small) Mexican Market on one side and a food taco truck, in front of another Hispanic store, on the other side. I never dine in but the place is decent enough to come in with a couple of friends and relax after your order is made. They have high tables w/ tall chairs that, to me, doesn't look comfortable. 

Customer service is always 5/5 - Never any rude ladies. They seem a bit intimidated if you don't speak Spanish so my boyfriend orders for me (while I stand awkwardly there). Once you walk in you are greeted and handed a smaller sized menu that has their prices stated. 

I've ordered an Elote - It was not as good as the Elote lady/man who go around the neighborhood with a cart. They held back with their seasonings. 
The Mangonada was delicious but not worth $3. I can get a bigger size for the same taste within knowing neighbors. 
So the only reason I keep coming back is their cup containing mango slices, mango ice cream with chamoy and a tamarindo candy stick to finish it off. It is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT DELISH. Pricey ($5) but worth it until I find another place.

Only con to this place is the price. I love good customer service and I love mango with chamoy.",-jL7hLAAwOnCAWKQlL9Wew,1,0,4,-0y9Hc-0VpLGsO8S5viDhw

But I love the corn and fresh juices so I kept coming back anytime I was in town.  I later met the owner Hugo and he's a really nice guy.  He was able to explain his menu and gave me details on how things are made.  The sorbet is so yummy and house made.  So are the juices.  U can't go wrong when coming here.  Can't wait til the new place opens. It's unfortunate that they went thru a fire and are working out of a temp truck but they still have a lot of items.,YRcCH25NCFqB2wCcjtUJEg,3,0,5,ZdqXgbG8Ai6TAPSYeFzIxg

The freshly made gaucamole being made at the table was the highlight of the meal. It was a nice touch. The gauc also was really good. The rest of the meal was okay but not the best I have had of any of it. Beans and Rice were so so. The tamles were good but nothing to brag about and the asada taco was good as well but nothing out of this world. I have had better a cheaper street vendors. Overall this is a nice authentic sit down resteraunt but nothing that blew my mind minus the guacamole. 

I will say the service here was top notch though. Really enjoyed the friend and attentive atttitudes of all those we met.

4265101,2014-01-10,0,xgWRBPr3k8iJp10cZE9GHw,"My husband had a strawberry-banana licuado (smoothie practically liquified) and I had a chamango. 

The hubs's licuado was tasty. Mine, on the other hand, was the worst Chamango I've ever had :(  It was started w/ Chamoy on the bottom then large chunks of fresh mango, then 2 scoops of some mango sorbet then more large chunks of mango. In between there all that there were layers of Chamoy. I think I counted 3 ice cubes and then it was topped off w/ Chamoy, a fork and that straw thing w/ spicy stuff (OMG, I grew up in San Diego, you'd think I'd know the proper terms :T). I'm used to the mango blended w/ ice and sugar then layered w/ the Chamoy and enjoying through a straw, this was too much work and overly sweet! 

I was super disappointed especially since when you try to yelp/search for places like this here in Vegas, we got some slim pickins!

We'll be back, but I'll have a go at something other my beloved Chamango.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,0,1,2,V9aIT8eoksRWvm1jxv4CnA

They have over 20 flavors.  I tried the Guava-creamy and fruity.  It you are looking for something more icy and refreshing--try the lime flavor.  They have a lot of other things I want to try there.

The Chamango we picked up is tasty! Although, the first time we came here the mangos were hard and sour. It was not the deali-o. I also forgot a straw the first time around.

Second time around.. DAMN GOOD. The mangos were super sweet! Soft! Delicious! And I asked for a straw! But.. I did this gesture with the lady that made it look like I was asking for a joint. Eventually I figured it out and decided to start pointing instead. For those who don't know how to say straw in Spanish it's ""popote""

So I found the trick to eating this on the way back from Vegas to Cali. You let the ice cream sorbet melt a bit. Eat the Tamarind stick first. Then dive into the mangos getting bits of that ice cream and chamoy sauce. Let it melt some more on the drive... Then when it looks like its slushy drink it from the straw! HELL YEA. Then eat more mangos.

It's great. I loved it. I hope to come back and have SWEET mangos.

Don't forget the napkins.",Q3lp4hnDOflAO2Ul6u9JvQ,4,3,5,yjRwN_vi9h7p91oZfojspg
