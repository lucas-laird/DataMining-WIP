The pizza is something special with extraordinarily fresh mozzarella and a tasty sauce that had some texture, but not too much ... for a person like me that won't eat chunks of tomatoes.

They kept the pizza in the ""crisper"" for a good 25 minutes while we finished our beer and by the time we got back to the hotel it was pretty soggy. Sticking it in the oven mostly brought the crisp back.

From the look of the salads around us, they were generous

I really like this place and would definitely go back.

55839,2012-02-15,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"I honestly can't believe some of the rave reviews I read here.
Pizza's OK, but really nothing extraordinary. Fairly standard, typical thin-crust pizza I've had better at my local bars.
 
Our pizza arrived less than really HOT the way I want it to arrive since pizza cools quickly. At $2 per topping I would expect them to be more generous with their toppings than Pizza Hut.  
The House Salad is plain and boring. For $5 for the small salad you'd think they'd try to differentiate it from every other house salad out there... but no.

Lastly, the beer is overpriced also. At $5 for a Sam Adams Lager I'd expect a tall glass or large mug. I was disappointed to see it arrive in a small, what I'm guessing to be, 12oz. glass.

There is better value (better pizza and beer) for the money elsewhere. Change that...

156835,2013-03-30,1,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"Four of us stayed at TI for a college reunion and were looking for nearby cheap places to get food. Grimaldi's showed up on my Yelp app, so we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did!  We had a large pizza with pepperoni and black olives ($18) and a personal-sized pesto pizza ($10).  It was more than enough food for the four of us, plus 6 leftover slices, and we were all starving.  Those 6 slices sure came in handy when we staggered back from the club 6 hours later... :)  The pizza was outstanding.  It was thin-crust and had real slices of fresh mozzarella (you can tell when you see the round blobs on the pizza rather than the uniform coating that most commercial pizzas have) and deliciously salty pepperoni.  The black olives were a little too salty for some of us, so we would probably sub those out next time for something else.  The quality of the pizza was definitely right for the price.

I called ahead and walked over to Fashion Show Mall from TI (about 10-15 minutes), and our order was ready when we got there.  (HINT: it's all the way at the ""back"" of the mall by Dillard's in Zone D on the lower floor, near Chipotle).  The lady on the phone and the server who rang us up were both very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and intimate, so I would definitely come back to eat in as well.

I always order the same thing a pizza with red sauce with pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage and jalapeños. Let me just say, for a pizza restaurant, they are expensive. A personal sized pizza with red sauce and the aforementioned toppings will run you about $18. That's 6 slices of pizza.  It's expensive but the taste is really good and the quality of the toppings and ingredients are good so when you're on the road and want a good slice of pizza it's worth it to get quality. I have been to this location in the Fashion Show mall here in Vegas about 5 times in the last 2 years. Twice, in the last week. The consensus between my friends and I are the same. This location is VERY slow. Like, sit down and wait 10 minutes before you place a drink order slow. Place a drink and meal order and wait 10 more minutes for your drink and 30-35 minutes for your pizza slow. The quality is not consistent and there doesn't seem to be any concern with any of this. The people have for the most part always been pleasant. I've only felt ignored once. Tonight I ordered my regular order and my pizza came out burnt. I didn't think the server should have even brought it out to my table, but he did. He was nice, but he didn't acknowledge it was clearly burnt. When I said something he hesitated and said it was ""just a little burnt"" and explained it just got a little too close to the coals. I tried to eat it, but the second slice in (the first wasn't really burned) I had a very strong charcoal taste in my mouth. I asked for another one and it came out, this time it wasn't burnt, but it wasn't really browned the way I'm accustomed to it being, therefore the crust and pizza was ""flimsy"". The taste was there but the experience wasn't. I paid for my check and took my pizza to go. I spent $22 before tip. Don't know if I'll be back to this location. They definitely have good food but you have to pack some patience and time to eat here.

They also have seasonal cheesecakes and tiramisu. My favorite is their tiramisu, where the lady fingers are soaked with just the right amount of espresso.

The place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar. I liked the ""renewable"" wine bottle chande-lights.

For the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the ""house-made"" Fresh Mozzarella. The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good. Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it. The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings. The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread. The winner on that plate was the ""house-made"" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese. Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)! 

The service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost. First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser. Whuh? And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check. He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered. And I don't think they put a rush on it. Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made ""on-the-fly"", meaning  it should have been made top priority.

A thin, chewy but satisfyingly crisp crust.  Slightly sweet and slightly salty sauce.  Meats that were not overly salty themselves (a common issue) and unusually small 1"" pepperoni rounds that managed not to emit excess grease.  The cheese was sublime, providing great texture and foundation without getting in the way.  Cooked expertly with some char, but not too much. Wow!

First off its not a huge place. Its opened so you can see out and right in front is where they periodically do fashion shows so if you sit outside you get up see that if you don't mind the blaring music and singing for a bit. Inside it's nice and cozy with leather booths against the huge mirror.

That's ok totally our bad. Wish we had more time to look and decide. Just felt a bit rushed n not sure why.

2492179,2012-02-23,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"I've been to another Grimaldi's and this one was a disappointment. First off, why the hardcore full court press sell to buy wine, salads, and something from the bar? If we wanted any of those items we simply would've ordered them. We were not asked once to order these items but twice. This is a pizza joint yet it really felt like going to an Olive Garden where one is pressured to buy an appetizer, cocktail, or dessert in order to jack up the bill. Ridiculous. 

Now, the pizza.  The pizza was mediocre at best and certainly not up to snuff at the other Grimaldi's location we've been too. Ordered large sausage pie but it was really light on the sauce and the cheese. I actually like sauce all over my pie and cheese as well but the cook just drizzled on the sauce and then filled in the gaps with cheese. In other words the entire pizza was not covered with sauce or cheese. Also they usually put a decent amount of fresh basil on their pizzas but not this time. Maybe two small pieces of basil on an entire large pie? Very disappointing and as a result of my wife and I will not be back to this location. 

I guess we will pay a couple bucks more and tryout Dom Demarco's across town. my wife did order the homemade tiramasu to go and she said it was pretty good. It was 5 dollars. 1 other strange thing even know this is a sit down restaurant it does not have bathrooms???

The service was exceptional and our server was very friendly and as soon as she found out that I was a Grimaldi's newbie, she gave a helpful breakdown of the menu and gave plenty of time to decide. 

As for the food, it is up to you to create your own pizza creation! They have the options of a classic red, personal white with garlic (no sauce but it comes with extra cheese so yay), or pesto as the base. Sizes are: personal, small (16 inch), and large (18 inch). The rest aka toppings? That, my friend, is entirely up to you! You can choose to be a minimalist or go big with whatever toppings you would like. I ended up getting a classic red with Italian sausage, garlic, mushroom, and green peppers. Since it was NY style pizza with a thinner crust, the wait wasn't long at all and before I knew it, my beloved creation came!

It filled up during the course of our meal.

We went with our servers recommendation and shared a small pizza. For our toppings, we picked sweet red peppers, sausage and mushrooms. The size was plenty for two people and we couldn't even finish the final slice. The pizza was good, but far from the best that I have ever eaten. The ingredients were all fresh and high quality, but I felt that the sauce lacked flavor. It was a little bland for my taste.

Our servers were very attentive and helpful. We seemed several servers attending to us, rather than just one. This wasn't the case throughout the restaurant, as a few tables near us were being ignored. A single man seated next to us complained very loudly, as he kept getting passed by and had been waiting to have his order taken from the time we were seated to the time our pizza was on the table.

The White Pizza was okay for me; I'm a little bias from Secret Pizza's White Pizza from Cosmopolitan, sorry!  The Pepperoni pizza with Sausage was delicious, where I actually enjoyed the sausages more than the pepperoni. Weird, I know...

I call it 'Stacy Style Salad' -  with no onions or olives, but with extra feta and dressing - she also requests for (2) orders of cut salami to it. Sounds a bit much, but they are always accommodating to make this, and it is pretty delicious. My son and I usually share the salad with her or get a pizza of any variety. Always good.

Why I gave this location a 5 star was because of the service that was provided to us by Javier. He is the bartender/waiter. One of the realest, sweetest human beings you'll meet. Not pretentious, his fantastic personality and always looking out for you. His likeability gave us such ease in dealing with the Christmas shopping crowd that we were dealing with outside of the restaurant. The three of us enjoyed his style and ""I got you"" demeanor so much.  We hope that he has a great Christmas cause he has made us enjoy ours.

We look forward to coming back and requesting for Javier as  our preferred server. If he isn't there and moved on, we would be totally understanding of it cause our assumption would be that he has moved on to do better things which is what we feel he deserves.

The food is great here and for any visitors coming by shouldn't be disappointed, even if it is a chain. I highly recommend this location and remember to ask for Javier!",Qa67LO6dGw1mKTy7R3YgwQ,0,0,5,6-1-WhODrA9NsdbkbdNXEg

Weird location being in a mall, though you wouldnt notice until you walk outside. We ordered 3 large Pizzas. Pesto, White (garlic and cheese) and sausage and pepperoni  (cuz Dre hate veggie pizza). 

Service was slowwwww. In fact they messed up our order, however they were extremely courteous about it that we got the original order as well as 2 small ones and 1 extra large for a total of 6 Pizzas! 

Pizza was pretty good, I wouldnt say the best but still good and the fact they gave us extra helps. My favorite of the three was the white and the sausage and pepperoni. Crust is thin and foldable, new york style.",8RhA5uJ7NBFjsoBxJAjljQ,2,2,4,jDO1loXMLZtzIh3xsghTnw

pepperoni
mushroom
anchovies
extra basil

But, based on the prices and fact this is in the Fashion Show Mall, I don't think I'd recommend going anywhere else there for a bite.  Forget about the food court overflowing with 2 star options.  There's Neiman Marcus with its own restaurant, and places like Maggianos and The Capital Grille too, but those are obviously in a different price range with a totally different experience.

Here, I got a personal pizza (12 inches) that starts at a $9 price point, then goes up a couple bucks depending on what toppings you add.  I think that this size could actually be shared among 2 people if you wanted to.  It's thin and saucy, and the portion of cheese to crispy crust is well balanced.

It's a cute little place, I sat at the bar but looked around at the brick walls, the fireplace, all the photos, and of course the red and white checkered tablecloths.  So it's not just some impersonal generic pizza joint in a mall.

The pizza is made in a brick oven and you can see them put them in and take them out - the oven can hold quite a few pizzas! The time to receive the pizza was very reasonable and it was delicious! We opted to get half with just pepperoni and then the other half with jalapeños and bacon (not my choice lol) but it was still fantastic!

3590936,2017-09-28,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"Stopped in here with my dad who was visiting me a while ago. We decided to get lunch before hitting up the Avenger's Station at Treasure Island. 

Located in the Fashion Show Mall it's at the far end where they sometimes play movies inside of the mall which where they sometimes have their fashion runway. Moana was playing at the time so it was a bit noisy but other then that it was an enjoyable experience for my dad & I.

We ordered a medium ( I think ) pesto pizza with black olives. I'm a huge pesto (& olives addict honestly) fan & my dad had never had it before ( I mean seriously?!) so I decided he must experience this greatest once & for all. We got some sodas to go with it & called it a day. Although it was lunch time, we both had not ate anything yet so 2-3 slices each was more then enough for both of us! 

The crust on the pizza was a tad burnt. It didn't make it bad but I'd prefer normal. My dad however is a burnt bread type of person so he actually preferred it that way. To each their own! If you like it cooked longer then you'll like the pizza here. Taste was decent enough & waiter was nice. Checked on us every once in a while & made sure we were doing alright. 

While this place isn't bad there wasn't anything stand out about this place. It's your typical American Italian style pizzeria with that red checkered look that a lot of them have. It's a cozy little chain restaurant. We enjoyed our time there & I wouldn't mind coming back if by chance I was invited by a friend or was craving pizza while shopping.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,1,0,3,eXfUkfYAoFnCR3ZHPftqTQ
3614294,2017-06-26,14,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"What kind of ex-Brooklynite would I came to Sin City but didn't check this place out? :-)

It was just another sweltering hot holiday weekend in Vegas.  I spent the the afternoon sipping cocktails by the pool, and the morning riding the coasters of Stratosphere Tower; it's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it! :-)

We wanted to go to Grimaldi's for an early dinner to allow plenty of time to get to Kevin Burke's one-man comedy, ""Defending the Caveman"" at Harrah's; we walked into the restaurant just after 5.  The atmosphere was convivial, warm, and very New York - in a Vegas sort of way;-)  There are checkered tablecloths, and lots of brick.  
 
Grimaldi's makes their pizzas in coal-fired ovens.  Why?  They say that pizza and Calzones baked in their signature coal burning oven offers a crisp crust and a unique flavor and that is just not possible using gas, convection or wood burning ovens, and that their handmade mozzarella, fresh ingredients , 'secret recipe' dough and pizza sauce make them the most award winning pizzeria in the United States.  Quite the hype - will the Carboholic's Delights they serve at Grimaldi's stand up to it?  To find out we ordered a personal coal-fired NY pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and garlic. Also a Calzone with pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms.

Grimaldi's menu lacks any non-veggie starters; given that the pizza doesn't take very long to cook, that's not a show-stopper, but it sure wouldn't hurt if they added garlic bread or Bruschetta for those of us who like to eat carbs while they wait for their carbs...

We didn't wait long for our food, but I was still very eager to try mine!   Grimaldi's original venue was built underneath the Brooklyn Bridge long before my personal Escape from New York, but I never heard of it until recently; that made me several decades overdue for my first Grimaldi's fix.

Saving what I assumed would be the best for last I started with the Calzone.  Ricotta cheese is a default with Grimaldi's Calzone; it was smooth, creamy, and delicious!  Given it to do over again, next time I'll include sausage, but the taste of this Thing of carb-intensive Beauty was wonderfully balanced even without meat - I don't think I've ever tasted a Calzone this good!

Moving on to the meat of the matter, let's talk about Grimaldi's pizza!  Unlike a lot of NY pizzerias, Grimaldi's sells only whole pies; no single slices are available.  I was surprised when I saw the thickness of the crust up close and personal - for my money it's distinctly thinner than traditional NY Pizza; not quite Neapolitan, but getting pretty close.  It was so thin that I was a little concerned about this pizza's ability to stand up under another meat topping and extra cheese, so we went with just the two meat toppings and garlic; no problems with ""independent suspension"" on the first or second slices.  It was a slight issue with my friend's third, but nothing major.

What did it taste like?  The scent of basil leaf added an enticingly to the pizza's delicious aroma; I took a bite and the sauce yielded a burst of fresh tomato flavor; the cheese was exquisite!  It's not shredded - it's pure white, fresh mozzarella cheese, melted on the surface into a nice, thick chewy texture.  The crust, slightly charred by the coal-fired ovens, was crisp and chewy; the flavors of the sauce, the pools of cheese, and the toppings blended into a deliciously satisfying pizza experience!

With friendly, efficient service, incredible pizza and Calzones, and five locations in Las Vegas, Grimaldi's is an exceptional star pizza joint that is now a permanent part of my Sin City rotation.  I enjoyed this visit so much that I just may check out the Mother Ship when next I return to the Big Apple.

Tip: There's only one thing wrong with Grimaldi's, and one reason I can't give them a five star rating  - absolutely no outside wine or liquor is allowed.  Who knew that on Grimaldi's world Atlas, Las Vegas is now a part of Kansas? ;-)",Rm-lTmUSoOt2Y13i27vCZg,16,15,4,oF63EUXASjEWRhTR3eWhFg

The sauce is watery and acidic. The crust is tough and flavorless.
And yet, the place was packed when I was there....really packed!!!
Could be another sign of the apocalypse.

This ""coal-fired, brick-oven"" hustle is meaningless. 
Doesn't make this much better than Papa John's. But costs twice as much. Not that I'm recommending Papa John's cuz I'm not.
But I am saying there are many pizza choices in Las Vegas that are better than Grimaldis. Including the newly-opened Dom DeMarco's.

But for me, the little neighborhood joint on Twain called Sicili, will do just fine.

Don't waste your time on this place; leave it for the pizza muggles.

Usually get a large pizza or 2 and salads and the the caprese salad. Pizza is always fresh of course because its made to order Una brick oven pizza which gives it a nice crispiness to it. Ingredients are great as well as the choices. Love the flavor of the sauce and cheeses. The caprese salad isn't great though I wouldn't get it again. Love their salads especially their Greek!

Both locals and tourists come and go so your product will either keep you in business or drive you out.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is darn good.  

I was with a friend and when she smelled pizza in the air she all of a sudden wanted to sit down and eat.  There's another pizza place here, California Pizza Kitchen, which is good as well.  But we've never had Grimaldi's before so we decided to sit down here and try it out.  So come to find out we'll be dining a New York pizza.  I've had a Chicago pizza so I was curious to see how it competes with a New York style pizza.  

We shared a small white w/garlic pizza ($16) and added mushrooms ($2), pepperoni ($2), and artichoke hearts ($4).  A $25 pizza split between two people is not bad at all if you're saving money for shopping.  There had to be at least 20 toppings so have your go with it.  Secret to a good pizza however is the sauce and cooking method.  The sauce was delicious and the coal burning method (love wood burning as well) worked perfectly.  Our pizza was delicious, I just don't know what makes this a New York pizza.  Service was good but it took so long for our pizza to come out and it wasn't even busy inside.  Our quick dine wasn't so quick.

Do come and have a pizza!",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,1,1,4,FoKIT47CRcAD2N7et6e92Q
4039426,2012-12-22,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"I've heard a lot of good things about grimaldis and went to this location after Christmas shopping.

It was pretty empty.

We were seated right away and had a male and female server who doubled as the hostess. 

The menu is small, which I like. There are three pizzas to choose from in a large or small and then you can choose your own toppings.

My friend and I just ordered a mushroom pizza to split and a caprese salad.

The salad was good, but I can't imagine how you'd go wrong making that. They give you salt, oil, and balsamic on the side. It was a good portion and shareable at $8. 

Our pizza was served shortly after.

The woman served our first slice and we ate the whole large between the two of us.

The crust is very thin, the cheese was very good, the mushrooms were fresh, and the sauce was just right.

It was a very good pizza. They found a very good recipe for their proportions and ratios of cheese versus sauce versus crust.

The only thing that didn't make this a 5 star review is that:

1. They never refilled our drinks until we asked when leaving. Sure he offered a to go cup, but it want busy because he had a bite of food from an off the clock employee's food while he was on the clock but that's beside the point.
2. A customer leaving broke a wine glass just by putting his jacket on. Although they handled the situation well to make the customer not feel at fault.. They said don't worry it happens all the time.. First they shouldn't keep wine glasses on the table no matter how nice it makes the table setting look since their tables are so close together. Second the staff said it happens all the time and not to worry. It just feels dangerous, uncomfortable for who ever did it, and could be avoided. I hope it doesn't happen all the time for safety reasons.  

I'd return to try their special mozzarella and meats on a more adventurously topped pizza, but maybe not this location.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,0,0,4,_izwnXxAZrEILqQtZiq20g

The inside is very nice (not really what you'd expect in a pizza joint)- red/white checker topped tables, surrounded by framed pictures of New York City points of interest (bridge) and old-time celebs (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin) on all the walls. There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.

The service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair.
 
About the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc.). If you get any starters, it's several choices of salads. Also has desserts, cold drinks, and wine & beer.

The husband and I were looking for some place to eat near the Fashion Show Mall, but we didn't want to eat in the food courts. Grimaldi's popped up on the Yelp app. The location is near the ""back"" of the mall (in relation to the Strip), but it's definitely worth the trek.

We ordered a ceasar salad (great salad, but not the best I've had) and a small pizza with pepperoni and red peppers. The peppers are amazing! We split a cannoli for dessert and it was one of the better cannolis I've ever had.

  Grimaldi' s obviously has fans. At 2 p.m., there was a ten minute wait. And they are putting up a new Grimaldi's caddy corner across Las Vegas Boulevard in the Pallazo.
  With a fashion show taking place, in the vicinity of Gramaldi's, the wait was not boring. When the tables are all occupied, they hand you a beeper resembling a pizza slice. When a table is available, it goes off.
  I enjoyed my personal thin crusted pizza topped with mushrooms. It seemed to be the equivalent of four slices of standard pizza. The taste and quality are commendable.

Got a large pesto pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. So delicious! It fed three people comfortably, but I think we should've ordered a large salad to split as well. Portions are HUGE. If you really wanted, the small salad is big enough to be a meal in itself. I just wanted more pizza since it was so delicious my stomach didn't know if it was full or not. 

Service is a little on the slow side, but I notice that they make each pizza to order, so most of the wait time is definitely because of cooking. You will never see your order sitting on the counter.",fL8ujZ89qTyhbjr1Qz5aSg,1,1,5,CfALQR5WTESYHsx0VP5Wow

As a big fan of New York style pizza, I was super excited to try the place that everyone has told me is a ""must have.""  ....""Must have forgotten the flavor"" is more like it.

We ordered a pie with spicy chicken sausage, black olives, and mushrooms, and a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken.  The pizza was insanely bland.  The sauce was really lacking in flavor, spice, and salt and moreover, the whole thing just kind of tasted like bread, to be honest.

Here's what they did RIGHT: the crust (although the flavor was just okay) was the PERFECT amount of crunchy.   It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and had the structural integrity to hold up the toppings.  The spicy chicken sausage and my salad were both good, but it didn't compensate for the overall lack of flavor in the pizza.

5 stars for how they address mistakes.
3 stars for the pizza. 

My elite friends wanted to try this right before we left Vegas. I had been to the one in NYC, and supposedly they use NYC water here. I was willing to give it a shot. I still dream about NYC pizza 4 years after my visit there (I couldn't eat California pizza for 6 months afterward; it just made me angry) so I'm a little skeptical of anything this far from the east coast. 

It's a small restaurant inside of a mall, and gets crowded quickly. We were a party of 7. You can see the fashion shows from the restaurant.

We ordered a large white pizza, a large pesto, and a large meat pizza, along with a large Caesar salad. The salad was perfect. Not for the health-conscious with the amount of dressing used, but perfect. The they started bringing us small pizzas. We told the server that we had ordered 3 larges, and since the pizzas took so long to make, the manager told us to go ahead and keep them on the house and they would bring out the larges. The 3 large pizzas were more than enough alone to feed our table, so we had sooooo much extra pizza. They also accidentally brought an extra large meat pizza, but told us to keep that one as well!

I wish the rest of our visit was just as great. Before and after the pizzas were dropped off, we were completely ignored. I had to ask three times for another beer because it was forgotten, there were empty water glasses, etc. Maybe they could somehow tell I had too much beer over the weekend and didn't need anymore, but still!

The pizza was good, but didn't blow me away like the NYC version had. They did a great job on the crispy crust. The pesto was my favorite, the white pizza was too garlickly, and none of them seemed cheesy enough. It didn't have that life-changing, holy-crap-I-am-moving-to-NY like other pizzas I've had, but it was still good. 

Could have been a 5-star experience if the pizza and service were a little better! I enjoyed Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan much more.",QJW33YrUGp-wVMI8M5mObg,4,7,3,P9sPiQhthnr3oZIUPaPd3g

There was one incident that happened that I wish there was a way our server should have dealt with this issue.  We were seated about 15-20 minutes before these two couple who were seated right next to us in the front patio area.

The thin crust hits the spot and surprisingly does something that seemingly no other pizza place in town attempts - the New York pizza.  The large pizza and a large salad is enough to feed 3 hungry men, so don't feel like you have to buy a ton of food. The environment is nice, but therein lies the rub with Grimaldi's.  With the nice environment comes the vibe of ""upscale"" eatery, along with the high price tag.  Which brings me to my 3-star review.  I don't care how good pizza is, it's pizza.  There's no reason that a person should spend $25 on a pizza (plus tip). So yes, I finally found a place in Vegas with good New York style pizza, but unfortunately, the pizza is too expensive to enjoy frequently enough to really care.

I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!

Service was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar.  They only had one server for the entire bar area, AND she had tables in the dining area.  Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day, but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an ""off"" day for them.

Not particularly by choice, but my mom worked there and irresponsibly (love ya mom!) brought home those lovely grease filled, cheese and meat covered circles of dough to my family nearly every other day.   Anytime I was hungry, Pizza Hut pizza was waiting for me in the fridge and I developed a dependency to my pan pizza friends.  Fast forward 20 something years and Pizza Hut was still my pie of choice over Dominos, Papa John's, etc.  I dug Metro Pizza, CPK, and others, but not until I had Grimaldi's did the wool finally get pulled from my eyes.

(begin food review)

OH THE CRUST!   I'd never had authentic NY pizza prior to Grimaldis (I'm sure there's some New Yorker reading this right now shaking their head due to their belief of what real NY Pizza is.   To them I say:  no one cares).   Once you go coal blackened, you never go back.   Every pizza I've had since has paled in comparison (here's looking at you Settebello).   I like every type of pizza you can get here.  The Regular with some Pepperoni is simple and delicious.  The White with Garlic and Anchovies.  The Pesto.  no, THE PESTO.  My absolute favorite.  Pesto with Pepperoni and Meatball with some jalapenos on the side.  Absolute perfection.   I typically eat the Eastern location which I find the most consistently good, though I did try the Fashion Show one a few nights ago and found it just as good on that one visit.  Ingredients tasted fresh, crust was that perfect nearly chewy texture.  Several calories were devoured that night.

One other shout out: the bartender that was working that night was fantastic.  I sat at the bar for about half an hour waiting for a friend and he made one of the best double jack and cokes I'd had in a while.  I had several throughout the night (note to reader: this may or may not have influenced my food review).   I dont remember his name, but the next time you're in the Fashion Show and need a buzz before you get lost in the 20 floors of Forever 21, swing by Grimaldis with $10.50.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,5,5,5,1h5mLPduHqiXFcKS7rRdXw

You get a total of four slices whether you get the personal or small; it's just that the slices are bigger if you get the small and of course more expensive.  They charge for each topping so it can get pretty costly depending on what you get.  

We were pretty full from the pizza but we got cheesecake for dessert anyway :p  We were hoping to try their butterscotch toffee cheesecake but it wasn't available.

The salad, which was slices of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, was alright.

It was inconvenient to have to walk over to Johnny Rocket's for a side of ranch that so many like to eat with their pizza. Other than that, we had a great experience and we were highly satisfied with the pizza quality and service. Mr. Grimaldi, please introduce ranch dressing on your menu so we can visit you more often. I'm sure if you asked your employees how many customers ask for ranch, they will tell you a ton!",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,0,0,4,J9_FWEIzdhCf2Vm2UQw4Sw

5765452,2015-02-12,3,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"It's a small restaurant with a lot of style and character, but it looks out of place tucked into the stark white Fashion Show mall. I was with my parents and brothers, we decided pizza sounded good. The hostess sat us without a smile. We asked what beers that had on draught and without even answering she just pointed at the black book in the middle of the table that listed beers and specials and walked away.

We looked over the menu (our first time to Grimaldi's) and discovered that there's only pizza and salads. For a large pizza with no toppings it starts at $16, each topping is $2+. More expensive than I had anticipated, especially with picky little boys. We started discussing going somewhere more kid-friendly for my brothers. The server came up and you could see the disappointment of ending up with a family at her table. Fashion Show caters to tourists and people willing to drop a lot of dough, so she probably sized us up as cheap and not good tippers.

No smile. No greeting. We gave our drink orders at first, but her attitude really killed any desire for me to be there. I am a FOOD & BEVERAGE SUPERVISOR, all I deal with is customer service all day long. Her obvious disdain made me get up and ask her to cancel our drinks. She said, ""Oh."" in the most lackluster way possible and walked away from us. That's it! I was personally insulted. I'm sorry my family didn't measure up to your expectations, but we were ready and willing to eat, drink, and tip well. Grimaldi's will not get my business again, not for high prices and poor service.",jnO_038DjWXknuDVVNPSKQ,3,0,1,ffjCVegYxX43hT7Ufx_D9A
5775760,2016-12-25,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"This place is located in the middle of a mall, next to the Santa lane. I was having such a hard time giving them five stars! For the following reasons:
#1: my husband and I went in and had to wait 8 minutes until we got seated. Cause the hostess wasn't around to seat us, while the other servers just kept passing by us & ignored us or even bothered asking us to be seated. 
#2: the hostess decided to seat us next to the loudest area next to the kitchen, where all the noises the blaring, while there was another four top that was clear and empty, next to the entrance, with less noise. Later be known, she sat that table with 2 people at that 4 top. Hmmm how's that for my four stars? 
Now let me get to the third and bold one...
#3: their food is good, they missed a tiny portion of our order, but aside to that, our waitress decided to rush us while we're still eating and gave us our check by saying ""NO RUSH"" and even offered us to box my pizza to go, WHILE I was still eating. Is that even common??? Talk about being ""NO RUSH!!!"" What a fucking joke!
#4: Well, I ended up eating one more slice, and husband paid the bill, and as we walked out, we discovered there was a bit of a line! Know what? If that was the case, they should've been a lot better in managing time, tables and food prep! Had they NOT made the mistake on my pizza, I would've gotten my meal done earlier than expected. 
Food was good, service wasn't what I had expected! #crappyservice #failedservice #restaurantfailed",u2KO-AweffgaJ-jTA5MEmw,0,0,3,pWsDZt6b06JHy8DvkTf0Kg

5836953,2016-12-24,0,3nf-a84p8LC41_WAIvJPjg,"Had to give this place a look because of all the buzz I heard about it online. My verdict: Good pizza, but not worth going out of your way to try it if you're on vacation here. 

I split a large Brooklyn Bridge pizza - a pie with tomato base, ricotta cheese, red peppers, and hand-picked Italian sausage - with a couple of friends. The first few bites were delicious, and I really enjoyed the ricotta cheese, which was sweet, creamy, and rich. After settling in, though, I found the ricotta a little bit too heavy and overpowering, so I would suggest splitting a pie two-ways for variety. Lastly, the crust nice and crispy on the edges, but extremely soggy in the middle. Don't expect too much from Grimaldi's, but still a solid slice of pizza for the price.",HqeWYYS0k7fZ5vhdgqWIzw,0,0,3,rr2yPlOtYBo7R2JLdxKN7w

Service: 2 Stars.
Ugh....Where do I begin? If you get a server named Jilani, beware!! You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No ""Hello"" or ""Welcome,"" just ""What would you like to order?"" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked ""You want me to box that?"" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server. 

Food: 4 Stars.
Not the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients. Although once in a while, the cheese would completely fall off the slice.

- food is average
- service is good, average prices
- restaurant has a strange mildew smell 
- inside Palazzo hotel

The long of it:
Bland bland bland! I wanted more flavor, I kept adding salt and parmesan cheese to my food. Definitely disappointing! Secret pizza at Cosmo is way better than this place.  I started with the Caprese salad, which is huge btw. This is definitely good for two. They don't season it at all, you kind of have to just do it yourself with the balsamic vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. For pizza, they let us do half marinara and half white. Definitely thought the white pizza was lacking garlic flavor and the cheese they use is a bit rubbery. It's not that type of cheese where it has that nice stretch to it and you have to pull and pull...know what I mean??? Ugh overall, I would not come back. I'd rather have Papa John's pizza.",Hn_fblVIABJSA3jMhNhfMA,2,2,2,NUGkIa24ACkrTX2cRMIqxg

This one deserves a 3.5 and can up the scale to the 4 level if the flavor was turned up just slightly on the pizza pie. The flavor on our sausage, pizza, and mushroom fell a little flat. I wanted pizza and beer, so at least I got that, and over all for being located inside a mall pricing was not too bad. Service was good and the atmosphere pleasant; it wasn't NY but I'll settle.",OneCWV0KQmhr0-VTh1p5fQ,0,0,3,bnEWgFS92yJFwaKNBBPFLw
