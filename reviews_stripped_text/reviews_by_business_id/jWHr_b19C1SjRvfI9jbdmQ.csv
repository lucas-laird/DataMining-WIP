This looks like a familia owned Carne asada joint.  A place you would normally drive by & miss.  It's worth to make that turn into the shopping center & stop for the Carne asada.

They have many dish options, legit authentic mexican dishes.  I finally settled for  the Carne asada plate after looking at the menu for a good 5 minutes.  Everything looked good.  
Two people can easily eat out of one plate.  The Carne asada was very good & tasty.  Had that char taste as if you just barbqued it outside.  I felt like I was eating at my madres house.  My niece swears by the caramel grilled onions in the salsa bar.  She gives this place 5 stars just for the onions. This place is legit.

1057583,2012-10-21,0,jWHr_b19C1SjRvfI9jbdmQ,"Dependable, tasty tacos. 

I've only eaten the carne asada and el pastor tacos. But I've had them both a number of times.

The carne asada is served with cilantro, onions, and refried beans. The addition of beans is different for me, but I enjoy them. Those tacos are solid. They are consistently enjoyable. Not earth shattering, but good. 

The al pastor, on the other hand, is a different story. Sometimes it is ""good"". Tasty and pleasant. But there are times that their al pastor is AMAZING. I don't know what they are doing different on those days, but I plan to find out. I am not a fan of pork, but the taco filled with semi-sweet, perfectly charred tender meat served with pineapple is the best I've had in town. Again, they are not consistently outstanding, but they are always tasty. I would add an extra star if their pastor tacos were more consistent. 

I am a fan of this local joint. Did I mention they have a self-serve bar with grilled onions and jalepenos? Delish.

EDITED TO ADD 
IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: After eating here more than 20 times, I stumbled in a few times before the lunch rush. And guess what? The carne asada was amazing. Like award winning. Come in later (as I often have) and who knows what you'll get  (Ok to delicious fare). But come in around 11:00 AM,  and get ready to be moved. Possibly to tears.

Coming from LA where I know what's up with my Mexican fix, this place definitely serves Mexican food that can quite possibly resemble my beloved taco trucks in my hometown. The Asada can definitely be cut to smaller pieces, however everything else is as good as it gets. My personal favorite was the chorizo. I only got a single taco of chorizo and it was a mistake because I should have gotten maybe 10 more. They normally don't list the chorizo burrito outside the breakfast hours but if you ask, they will give to you. It's spicy and juicy. The pastor is cut from spits and served with the pineapples which gives the juiciness as well. The asada burrito was okay at best. Excess of rice and beans which takes away the taste of the asada. Nonetheless, I can easily eat 10 tacos. 

Tacos are only $1.35 so take that Tacos El Gordo ($2.00 excluding taxes)!

If you want to wing it, there are pictures of many of the foods on the menu board. I have never had anything bad here. The portions are large and flavorful. 

Seating is a little limited, so you may have to stalk tables at lunch time. This time our group had several different plates. The Carne Asada plate was a little over cooked. It was a little burnt and dried out. The burrito is a safe bet, you can get it wet (sauce over it) or dry. The sopes are always a good bet as are the tacos and enchiladas. You can get Coke from the fountain or in cans, but I prefer the bottles, it adds that special something to the flavor.

Listen carefully for your number to be called, it can be a little hard to hear sometimes. Check out the condiment bar at the end of the ordering area. Watch for the roasted peppers to come out, they bring the HEAT!

Cabeza Taco - AMAZING. rich, smooth, and with the cut of the salsa from the salsa bar, really how you want one of these bad boys to taste!

Chorizo Taco - sorta dry, which despite how rich i'm sure the meat was is a bit shocking.

Al Pastor Torta - really quite terrible. The whole thing was dry and the pastor was bland. There wasn't any mayo or cheese in there to moisten it up and as a restaurant, that based on it's various graphics bills itself as a pastor joint you'd think they'd be able to do better.

I guess maybe the should advertise with pictures of cabeza? probably not because cabeza looks sorta gnarly but lawwwd its' good",Eypq5gLLjCapBVVnMw_MyA,1,1,2,IZ6ns2UoT6ZA7wNVL5O6Pg

First we come in and there are flies buzzing all around, but against my better judgement we continued. We step up to the counter after looking at the menu to a lady who was very displeased to having to wait for us because we were taking too long looking at the menu I guess. We then order 1 super nacho with lengua, 3 al pastor tacos, 3 sopes of carne asada and 1 lengua torta to go. After ordering and signing the receipt the lady became disgruntled that we didn't leave a tip on the receipt, (she didn't provide any service other than taking our order and expected a tip?) She then proceeded to ask what we wanted to drink, the horchata was empty, the fountain drink soda lines showed out of order, the only thing they had was a lower than average tasting jamica. So we take our drink and sit down at the only table that has been ""kinda"" wiped down. Flies are still rampant and can be seen along the salsa line. We finally get our order, server brings our food and grunts as she lays it down, clearly still displeased at the no tip. I try the nachos, now I'll give them credit for the amount of meat on them, however this plate of nachos was not put together well or with any thought. The nachos themselves were in the middle of the plate, the refried beans (about the average household sized spoon worth) was on the side, the creama on the side, the guac and pico on the side, and all the meat was placed on top of the nachos themselves, it was not placed well and ended up being a crap nacho plate that took such hassle and forever to try and eat, after quitting the nachos I looked over to the al pastor tacos, these were the driest pastor tacos I had ever seen, like it looked like the went and dropped them in the middle of death valley to cook, left them out over the period of 2 nights then served them on what tasted like year old expired corn tortillas. I being hardheaded and always trying to give places a chance proceed to try to eat these bland and dry tacos where the only flavor from them were from the dry cut canned pineapple slices that were on them. (I've never had a dry pineapple slice until today.) I try to chase them down with the drink only to find out it is 80% ice and 20% jamica!! There were no refills allowed on the crap drink and I was forced to try to recover any saliva I had left. As with most Mexican or ethnic food places I was really excited to give it a try, but in the end I'm more excited to write this review to help stop people from making my same mistake. If your next to this place and you want Mexican, go down across the street to Tacos Tijuana or tortas gigante and get food that you will for the most part enjoy.",X7mx2zqKsXtA0BRXErpPqw,0,0,1,oxcUT3FsVgQNUe2OyekWBw

Idk what kind it was but it wasn't lengua for sure and the cashier even repeated my order twice back to me. I didn't know my order was messed up until I got home. Another reason why I left 4 stars is because I order 6 tacos to go and they piled 3 on top of the other 3. Seriously? You could have given me 2 foam plates and put 3 on each plate instead of putting 6 on 1 foam plate. It doesn't cost you that much to give me 2 foam plates and foil to cover it.

I was hungry, and I needed something that was both fast and tasty. With the amount of time I had before the Lakers game, I wasnt looking for love, a casual fling would do just fine. My tastebuds were willing to accept a one night stand. 
But really, a guy can still dream, no? 
God, if only I could find it. 
A place with salsa in bottles on the tables.
Maybe a couple jars of horchata on the counter.
And fresh produce, greaseless tortillas, and no sour cream in the building...
Someday...someday...
  
In my head as I drove across the strip I started doing the map out. 
Ohana BBQ? No eastern and WS is too far...
I decided Id go to Eastern and Trop and that would be my cutoff. 
There use to be a ""Super Burrito"" over there, its gone now, I learned that the hard way, but there was still other Mexican joints around it that warranted a sample. 
I decided on Tacos Tizon and dove on in.

This is one of those places thats incredibly hard for me to rate.
it could fall between 2 and 4 stars, depending on your expectations and your order. 
I got the Pastor tacos which weren't my style at all but for some reason I think I will order them again. The Pastor is done kinda Hawaiian style. They had flat long chunks of meat which was seasoned kinda pastily (pastey? paste-ish? with a paste like sauce?) which was mediocre but was somewhat saved by thin slices of pineapple. This is probably why I will order them again, because it was a little different. But in the end, I think its a flavor thats not really up their alley. They need to stay their lane on this one. Just cook the damn pork, chop it, grill it and slap on some flavor. Something tells me none of the cooks make theirs at home with the paste/pineapple combo. 
I also got some Carne Asada tacos and those can come with pinto beans. These were a little better, although needed some help from the salsa bar, which, while fully stocked, came up a little shy in the ""hair on your chest"" department.  
Soooo, foodwise its average. 
But unfortunately, theres more to life that just treating your tongue to spice and laughing at the fall of the Laker dynasty from a self inflicted food coma. 
Theres a little thing called $$$$, which is why this place gets the extra star from me. The board says tacos for 1.28 which is a hell of a steal, but for some reason they only charge me 88 cents per. Which is rediculous. I always order six, and then after they charge me the 88 cent rate, I order two more. Im wierd like that. At 1.28 a taco Im just fine w/6, but at 88 cents? I feel like Id be losing money if I didnt walk out with at least 8. 
I dont know why they charge me that amount, nowhere on the board was that listed, and it was a Monday the first time it happend, so it wasnt Taco Tuesday madness or anything like that. ""40 cent Markdown Mondays""?
Probably not
Anyway even if the 88 cent doesn't last and 1.28 is the rate, I would still say the tacos are worth it.

Best freakin burrito I've ever had!!! It was amazing I told everyone about my experience here. So tonight I was at the apple store at town squire. Yes, I drove all the way here to see if the they could replicate the amazing burrito again. Well they fell short but it was still good. It was hot but a bit dry. Not enough beans for my taste. The last time I was here the meat was freakin amazing. It was juicy and crispy. This time no crispy no juicy. I would have rated this place a 4 but man this place was filthy. The first 3-4 tables had crumbs on them. I bet if I added all the crumbs I could have created an asada plate!!! I didn't think it was a big deal maybe they just had a rush or shift change? I'm not sure but I was the only customer in the joint at this point. I went over to the salsa bar. Grilled onions and jalape√±os all gone!!! Don't really care for them but hey they must have been good right? You can get a pretty good view of the kitchen area from there. Omg the floor was a mess. There was paper and food on the floor.
