I'm not big on Kosher food but to be honest, If ur looking for a great steak or some really good food in general this is definitely the place to go.",FxxVgVi41DxdEjz5r-0JeA,0,0,5,67WJBprSzMvqp65OQNjlvA
955547,2018-02-12,0,G8SFOD9TKCSic2o0hyKc0Q,"I'm pretty sure most of the 5-star reviews are from friends and family of the owners. The service staff is poorly trained and the food is mediocre at best. 

The ribeye is a very thin cut and the fat was not rendered properly, so it was chewey. They need to use a thicker cut and teach the cooks how to render fat on a steak. 

The brisket was average and served with what tasted like (and probably was) powdered/canned gravy and served with a paltry side of soggy veggies. 

The biggest issue, however was that my colleague's chicken milanaise was served uncooked in the center (not just pink, but jelly-like raw). The reason it was raw in the center is because the cooks haven't been trained to pound the chicken breast down to an even thcikness, so the breast was much thicker in the center (football shaped) and won't cook evenly. We alerted a nearby server who took the dish away. 

At this point you would expect a manager to get involved, but the staff had apparently not been trained sufficiently, and we waited almost 15 minutes until my colleague requested that the order be cancelled entirely. The staff took the chicken off the check, but no other apology or compensation was offered to my colleague. 

Here's the problem with this. Staff should never be able to remove items from a check, only management (which is how 99% of restaurant Point of Sales are set up). So I would be willing to bet that a manager removed the item from the check, yet failed to investigate why. This exudes a lack of training and/or unprofessional management. 

My colleague's mother, upon is paying the bill, expressed her dissatisfaction to our server at which point he asked if we wanted a manager to visit (he shouldn't even need to ask at this point, but instead just inform us that he would be getting a manager involved). The manager apologized (in a somewhat unprofessional manner, saying she was upset about what happened and was going to lay into the kitchen staff), but that was it no other offer or compensation. So my other colleague left a bad review here (which was deserved). 

As we were leaving, the owner/manager chased us down and asked if we left a negative review. She then rudely asked us to remove the review (so of course I'm doubling down) because it hurts their business. Well, if you don't want bad reviews, train your staff properly, train your cooks properly

She had the option, at this point to tear up our check and refund it, accept full responsibility for the substandard food and service, at which point she wouldn't have even had to ask us to take down the review because we would have changed it to 5 stars volunatarily. 

Moral of the story, its not the screw ups that define you, but how you handle them.",7gQwoxYfxVt1ZL7C6WoZQA,2,1,1,warmYbJJC0Xa3gphtyilJQ

2379325,2018-01-23,0,G8SFOD9TKCSic2o0hyKc0Q,"One of the most amazing and delicious kosher restaurants in the US!

Freshly prepared dishes, wholesome ingredients, super attentive service and out of this world food, simply the best. I am extremely picky when it comes to restaurants and Ace of Steaks goes above and beyond any expectations. 

I had the pleasure to dine here a couple of times during my stay in Vegas and the quality of the food and the service were just perfect. You can see that there is lots love and passion invested in this restaurant. The owners truly care to offer their customers an outstanding experience.

Ace of Steaks is located on Sahara fairly close to the strip, so you don't have to travel to the outskirts of Vegas to eat kosher.

Most of the dishes are Persian from various kabobs to tahdigs and stews as well as steaks and a flare of Italian like their fantastic flat breads.

Their Persian dishes are freshly made and delicious, all their meats have great flavors and simply melt in your mouth.

I loved everything I ordered, but my favorite dishes were their Shish Kabok and their Soltani, which is a skewer of shish kabob and a sweker of ground beef koobideh kabob.

They had 3 dessert options, I tried two of the cakes, the Chocolate Lava Cake and the Pecan Bread Pudding and they were so good I couldn't believe they were parve.

The servers were very professional and they went out of their way to make sure I was happy with my meals, you don't see it often at kosher restaurants.

All in all I can't wait to visit Vegas again, just so I can eat at Ace of Steaks. Their Persian food beats any kosher Persian restaurant I have ever tried even in New York and LA.",mg1AXDDRWMJCcB9VubqMwQ,4,0,5,lzor-5cNmjnAZvQs-xO_PA
2489452,2018-02-14,0,G8SFOD9TKCSic2o0hyKc0Q,"This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. Avoid if you can!

We went to this location for an event with around 10 people. After we ordered it took 45 minutes before the first set of entrees came out. 3 people got their dishes and then the rest of us waited 10 more minutes before we got the rest. All food should be brought out at the same time. The quality of the food was sub par for the price you pay. Gravy looked and tasted like it came out of a pre-made pack. Veggie portions were minimal. The food was not prepared properly for some of us and had to be sent back. They forgot some of our food that had to be removed from the bill later. Then when we ordered dessert, again, they brought out the dishes at different times. The desserts should be even easier to bring out at the same time!

The worst part of the experience was that the fact that two of us were very nauseous the next day.

Went there a few days ago for early dinner. We were hungry and in a hurry. The place is fairly new and feels very warm. The owners (especially the lady, Ellie) greeted us and spent some time with us to tell us about their story. The service overall was outstanding. The best I've ever witnessed in Kosher LV joints. 
Now, the food: A-MA-ZING. Super fresh, came out 10 minutes after ordering. Ordered a number of things: sliders, flat bread, koobideh, chicken... All dishes very succulent. The meat was extremely tender and everything else was just cooked and presented to perfection. Felt extremely satisfied and so did the wife. I sincerely recommend to both locals and visitors.

So I ordered a half chicken kabob half shish kabob and they accidentally gave me the Barg when I modified my order. They were soooo nice to bring it for me on the side and allow my modification without a fee. I loved how excellent the rice was made and the half Salad Israeli style option.

And yet, Kosher food options are slim pickings round these parts!

Everyone who is anyone was telling me to visit newcomer Ace of Steaks since they opened in the fall and I was a bit hesitant to do so since I've had many misses with ""just opened"" establishments. Nonetheless, I headed off during lunch time to see what all the hype was about.
Here is why I believe they will be successful. We judge an establishment by how it looks decor wise/cleanliness, how we are treated from the minute we walk in the door and obviously the food.  Ellie and Moshe painstakingly looked at what they didn't like about from their personally experiences being restaurant patrons and made sure not to have those mistakes happen here.

Decor is very modern with clean lines and a bit of Vegas history in the mix: the leather booth seats in the restaurant were hand made by the same designer who made the large ship in front of Treasure Island Casino. They are also planning on helping local Vegas artists by displaying their paintings on the restaurant walls to help them sell as well.

Their staff, actually enjoys working here. Ellie personally drives home the fact that this is a family team effort and that every member of her house matters. I loved that when I asked my server Rubi, what she recommended from the menu, she didn't just point to the most expensive item on it, but she suggested things that she really enjoyed trying and why. It made me want to try more items than one person dining solo could nor should.

We eat with our eyes before we eat with our stomach. Presentation of each dish was thoughtful and beautiful. Ellie explained how dishes were served in a different way at first but through trial and error and trend, they started to change it up a bit and it works really well here.

Everything I had for lunch reminded me of meals I've had at the dinner tables of my LA Persian friend's parent's homes (and yes there is a difference btwn East coast and west coast Persian food!). The dips: Matbucha, Hummus, babsganoush, candied walnut coleslaw, the Tahdig with the flavorful Ghorme and Gheymeh stews, Variety of kabobs, the cumin laced cigars. One could taste that they were all made with love and care.

I didn't have room for dessert but I ordered them anyway! I'm not a fan of pareve desserts because they usually taste off. But I have to say their creme brulee  was spot on, the pecan bread pudding was not clawing sweet and super moist and who can say no to chocolate lava cake.
