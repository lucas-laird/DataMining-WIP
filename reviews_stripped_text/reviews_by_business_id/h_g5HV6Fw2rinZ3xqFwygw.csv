It is worth the time n effort cause Silverton Casino Resort is fill with activities for both young n old. There is a huge aquarium with live mermaid show. And a huge sports shop the size of a football stadium. U will definitely burn away the calories after a delicious meal at the Seasons Buffet!,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,4,7jf2sHJWNy5cCtn0ufTZOw

226205,2015-01-26,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"We have been to Silverton's buffet several times now.  We were very impressed the first time, which was a Saturday night.  But our review has gone downhill since then; I believe our visits since have been on Sunday nights.  The Stations are hands-down much much better.  Because the Stations get so many more people, they have much more of a selection and the food is much fresher and of better quality.

Everything was just okay with some things better and some worse.  The chicken noodle soup was good, and nice and hot, not always the case with buffets.  Salad toppings very minimal.  The grilled veggies were very good; my husband was very disappointed with the pizza which looked good, but the crust which looked pretty thin, was not crunchy.

The supposed 'rice pilaf' had no pilaf, just dried rice and some awful spice.  Went back up and took a stuffed cabbage figuring I couldn't go wrong; tasted like it was covered in ketchup.

Desserts very so-so.  Rice crispy treat had no flavor--how do you mess that up.  Soda completely flat; couldn't tell if it was pepsi or coke; maybe it was neither.

They don't use the paper placemats which I actually like because I know it is pretty clean.  Only give you one fork.  Service is good.

Overall disappointed.",yKcrC-MfRjqSi9GrVXEr3w,1,0,3,X9wi2CbWybJRSU5h9irdqg

Simple but effective menu~ somethings are really great and others are just typical or ok. Had not been here for awhile, but we saw an ad for bogo and decided to try again. Glad we did as they have a new executive chef who has revamped the menu and added some more interesting and fresh items. For example, the deep fried tofu salad with chilli and the keifer lime stir fry chicken. Can't go wrong with a selection of roasted vegetables (jalapenos and garlic included) or the fresh shrimp and cocktail sauce. All in all (bogo - $7.50 a person), if you make wise choices, you can get a great meal.",to-2EIRXGkhV3dWcwnllig,1,0,3,GyzsU1K7vpey3lzT7QIeIg

They only had ONE cashier for both the VIP line and the regular line. Every minute or so another senior folk with a VIP card would come in and she would take them before taking us. After an hour it was finally our turn, the clerk asked us how many people were in our party and proceeded to ask us if we had a players card and if we wanted to sign up for one...then started making small talk. REALLY?! If I wanted a player's card, I would have waited in the player's card line. I was so irritated because she was taking her sweet time. Don't mess with hungry folks. As soon as we passed the cashier, it was all smooth sailing. The food is not bad and neither is the service once you're in. The place itself is gorgeous.

Also if you sign up for the Silverton Casino players club you can also get a discount. Come early for dinner because sometimes theres a pretty long wait. 

The buffet has a good variety of food. There's different themes through out the week. But one thing I must say about this buffet is that the crab legs are great. Theyre pretty fresh in my opinion and they also serve them hot. You just have to ask the ppl in the back to get it for you. The staff there is pretty nice.

But for a cheap buffet, the food was ok.  The prime rib was pretty good and they had some pretty tasty grilled veggies.  Oh and the German Chocolate cake was ok.   On the other hand, the mushy egg rolls and funky dried out cinnamon muffins were inedible.

And our service was horrible.  Our waitress was EXTREMELY slow... and I mean that both physically and mentally.  We asked for sodas for our group 4-5 separate times and she NEVER go them right.  Two diets, two rootbeers and two Sierra Mists.  Is that really THAT hard?  What's worse is it seemed like she couldn't have cared any less that she kept bringing us the wrong drinks.  She would just shrug and take the wrong ones over to another table.  Pretty lame.

Overall, I would add this to my list of places to eat only if you have some kind of seriously great coupon and you just want to get lots of food into your stomach for cheap.  If you're looking for great quality and good service.... keep looking.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,1,1,2,yKn8bIoJZh7l_6b-S73_Ig

491596,2012-12-14,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Have you ever left a buffet still hungry? Well until I ate here this is the first time I can ever say that I have. This place was terrible. The choice of food that was offered wasnt bad until you ate it! Not lying I filled my plate full of the seemingly decent buffet food brought it back to my table and was so disapointed with the flavor. The words my mom use to tell me growing up is right never judge a book by its cover! The food didnt look terrible but man every single bite I took I wanted to puke. 

I must have filled my plate up four times and left it on the table full of food. The waiterss even asked is everything ok? I told her the food was eaither under cooked or over cooked or had a funky flavor. 

I gave up on getting the poor quality food from the buffet bar and went to there pasta bar were they make to order hoping for a fresh cooked plate of pasta. I picked what I would use at home to make an awesome Alfredo and gave my plate to the older man who could hardly speak English. After telling him what sauce I wanted he dumped half a bottle of olive oil and water in a frying pan heated the oil and dumped all my fixings in the pan. As I stood there watching him basically deep fry my food he asked what noodle you want yest just like that!! I said fedachinie noodle he said no we no have then he pulls a box out of the cooler under the stove and squeeze a load of spaghetti noodles in his tongs and says this what we have. Um ok that will work. So he throws the noodles in the frying pan and then turns around behind him and fills his spoon with Alfredo sauce dumps it in the pan at lets it simmer. No I didn't miss a step he never drained the gallon of oil! He says ok finished and dumps the slop on my plate oil and all. Sorry I usually tip but not this guy! 

I bring the plate back to my table thinking it cant be that bad I'm hungry and need to eat!! I sat down dug my fork into the noodle and took one bite and spit it back out on my plate! I can not tell you how nasty it was. After inspecting my plate my wife says holy crap babe look at all the oil separating from the sauce on your plate. It made me sick so yet another plate left. 

On to the deserts now I was done trying to get a hot meal maybe they have some pie or ice cream or something. Yeah just like everything else every pie looked like it was a week old and there cream things just looked that things. 

I'm very surprised that this place was the worst buffet ever. I mean it looked like it was an upscale place. You look around and you feel like your dining in an expensive restaurant I dont get it.",IzBQ-tzwG2GIPcb-Uo5gVg,1,0,1,MUYEmwyKxIgL90iYQCClag

I find the quality of the food to be mediocre at best, The majority of their vegetables are canned; corn, candied sweet potatoes, Sauerkraut, peas and carrots, etc.  However, the mashed potatoes and broccoli are fresh.

I am a vegan, so that limits me and what I can eat.  I do like their pasta bar and their salad bar.  My weakness was the dessert bar.  The dessert bar used to be great, but they seemed to have changed bakeries.  Now the cakes are too sweet and very dry. 

Our friends are not vegan, and they said the quality of the carving station was poor.  However, the turkey was pretty good, with a nice gravy. The price for the regular dinner buffet is $13.99, which is $1.00 less than the, Feast buffet at Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock Hotel.

The brunch buffet itself was pretty good.  Lots of choices, although the dessert station was a little underwhelming.  There was a champagne bar where the server would make any variety of champagne desired.  My only complaint was that there was a huge seafood section with crab legs, and I would've eaten a different meal at the buffet had I known that.  Looking at all the giant piles of half-eaten crab legs kind of makes me ill.  But it's a buffet - the gluttony shouldn't be surprising.

Service was good, although we were seated in the back section, where the tables are very cramped.  All-in-all, though, it was pretty good for a free buffet.

I enjoyed the made-to-order pene pasta with clams and pesto - pasta is probably available every night. Very hard to figure out the available choices. I also enjoyed some of the whole pig - probably only available on Polynesian night. The kalua pig was good.

The prime rib was tough, dry (even mid-rare), and full of gristle. How can a kitchen ruin prime rib? A lot of items look to be ""take from freezer, heat, put out."" Mostly, I found myself trying a couple bites before leaving it on the plate in hopes of finding something good.

Ice cream was soft and airy - not smooth and creamy. The pies were almost tasteless. 

People behind the buffet counter looked exhausted and completely unhappy to be there. While not busy (first clue at 7:30 on Saturday night), I waited 30 - 120 seconds before getting the attention from a worker at the pasta and prime rib stations.

We dined here Friday night which was seafood night. Adults, which they considered age 7 & up, were $22.99 & kids aged 4,5, & 6 were half price. I made sure we got our money's worth with the many plates of crab legs we ate. It also came with complimentary beer & wine but I can't say for sure if this is nightly or just the seafood buffet. They had the usual favorites for kids such as pasta, pizza, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes etc. 

The dessert buffet was tasty with a good variety of cakes, pies, & other pastries. They even had a selection of sugar free desserts for those seeking them. My favorite was the more than half dozen flavors of ice cream made in-house. They even had root beer floats made to order.

All in all, I was happy with our buffet experience and the kids were happy with it too. On top of all the great food selections, the service was awesome & that usually isn't the case with a party of 18. I would definitely go back here again if I stay in the same area the next time around. But based on the other reviews, I may stick to Friday night seafood fare.",rYyecWVUE5N4N-RE0mcBKg,1,0,4,18hNkVXe_nRGOAegsL8_yA

food here is good. the AC can get pretty cold, but the decor is nice. decorated with the different seasons, obviously, 'cause this place is called ""seasons."" service was also really good and attentive.

pesto pizza was awesome. they also have a ""build your own pasta"" section, which i didn't do.....sadly. there's a lot of choices from different pastas to sauces to ""toppings"" like olives, artichokes, capers, etc. how cool is that?!

oh! they also have ridiculously awesome brownies. i'm not much of a dessert person, but i'm mad addicted to brownies, and i had to have TWO even though i was full already. moist, fudge-y and chewy. PERFECTO!",FLnAOjMvsjX7SFPOGxUVHg,1,1,4,U_DGvb-fHWpaVs8Oaik7rQ

I chose 3 due to what happened when we first arrived. At 5:30 on a Saturday there was no line. We walked right p to the cashier. My dad really wanted to go here. Now he has a club card to Silver ton, and I had received a coupon in the mail for a 2 for one buffet so off we went. The cashier tells my dad this is not our card. Rally? it says silvetrton right across the card. Not once did he say your card is outdated, or why do you not go to the club booth and get an updated one , or wait let me call for you. Nope not once ounce of customer service. Honestly I could tell my dad was getting pissed, so I did not even think about running and getting one myself. My dad told the kid forget and paid him. 75.00 for 3 people. I was expecting a huge assortment of food for this amount of money. Honestly there was not that much to chose from. We grabbed some food sat down and I could tell my dad was very upset. He honestly felt disrespected as to how the kid was treating him. and he was not enjoying his 75.00 buffet. We asked our server Gabriel, who by the way was fantastic, to ask a manager to come and talk with us. Gabriel checked back with us to see if she had arrived we told him she had not. We explained what happened and he went to get her again. She did arrive and I told her what happened. She asked for my dad's card ,saw it was outdated, asked my dad to go with her to the club booth, she got him a new card then honored the coupon. Which of course was the right thing to d. My dad seemed relieved after this and really liked the manager and that she treated him with respect and not as an old man. We finished our meal, found Gabriel gave him a generous tip and were on our way. 
Now I will say the food we had was very good. The desserts far too sweet. And our server needs a huge promotion!.

Not any of the other staff that works in the restaurant. When issue we had was our two for one coupon was given away to a random person because they didn't check his ID.  Then when we got to the front they check their IDs and they still couldn't honor the coupon. The coupon would've saved us about $15-$20. So it was very annoying and we actually got an argument with the staff and that shouldn't of happened.

Mostly known as lechon to the Filipino community. Yum! The lechon was good and tender. Skin was crunchy. I also had fried rice, cream cheese wontons, and the noodles. Finally a place with noodles which I was craving earlier. The waiter was good about refilling our drinks. The cream cheese wontons were huge and had a good sized amount of cheese. I wish I could have taken more pictures but I got caught up in the food and conversation with my BFF and her fiancé. 

For dessert, I got the sugar free desserts. Trying to watch my sugars. I got a small sugar free cheesecake and a small sugar free fruit tart. So good. Cheesecake tasted smooth and fresh. They also had the regular desserts such as fudge, red velvet cake and so much more. Wish I could have had more but I was already full.

With that being said I was still hoping to walk out and not feel guilty for blowing 50 bucks on dinner. Ofcourse it didnt work out that way. I still feel bad the next day. The only thing that saves me from getting really pissed was that we got to see the mermaid swim around in the huge aquarium in the casino area. She put on a great show so it was worth it in that respect.
  I gave the place a star because at least the drink lady was nice to us. She seemed to be the only one actually working. The other buffet staff were just rude. I could even hear them complaining because we asked for a booth. That really pissed me off! I got a players card before we went to the buffet to get a slight discount. We still ended up paying $13.99 per adult. The kicker is they charged my 8 year old son adult price! I almost lost it. He hardly eats anything...well not like an adult anyway. They did charge my daughter half price because shes 6 years old. I assume she'll be an adult when she hits 7...lol. What a joke.
  So the food flat out sucks. Most of the food tastes microwaved and even some stuff feels like its from the day before. Their wonton with crab was hard as a rock. I did like their bbq ribs. That was about the only thing that was decent. The guy cutting the rib roast was just hilarious. The first time I went to get a slice he gave me a paper thin slice. It was so tiny I thought he was joking but then he walked away... So I went back later to get another slice and I told him to give me a thick slice. Son of a b*tch gave me the same sized slice. So I asked for another slice. Bastard gives me another thin slice then he walks away. I was wondering if I was on some kind've hidden camera show or something. But after talking it over with my wife we came to the conclusion that they probably are told to only give small slices out because the one roast they have probably has to last the whole night. Just lame! So this place isn't worth it. For the same money other casinos have way better buffets and the quality is so much higher.",E3pXvQwKsPBQGQ7RkLrN3g,1,1,1,zI8j2aut76ciYStX1PwcUg

1669793,2010-03-01,8,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"My favorite part of Vegas is the trip home. It has slowly become a tradition to eat here on the way out of Las Vegas. Although our whole group of girls loves this place, I am probably the only one who looks forward to leaving more than anything else for two very delicous words: crab legs.

The one thing I have spent my buffet eating trips loving is shrimp and cocktail sauce. Especially when there horseradish standing by. Now although I am still quite enamored with them, I think I have found my buffet soulmate in crab legs. Simply amazing. I am lucky enough to have a Tina Z. in my life who used to work at Red Lobster and has taught me the kung fu art that is extracting crab meat from the shells, but you'll figure it out. Trust me. Hot or cold. With or without fatty butter. I am starving just thinking about them and a little sad that I don't have my next trip out there planned yet. 

Anyway, for those who don't obsess like me, the rest of the buffet is also excellent. Waffles with strawberry topping or funky french toast covered in crunchy oat things. Pizza with a side of full roasted garlic heads (you read that right, not cloves, heads). Oh and my other weird obsession, bagles with smoked salmon and cream cheese. So good. The dessert bar is also pretty amazing. I fell deeply in love with their coffee flavored flan of some sort. And many flavors of ice cream! Blueberry pie! Man it's a good thing they're located in a different state beacuse I don't have the time to go to as many TKB classes as it would take to burn off these calories.

Oooh and the mimosa bar. Not sure if it's an everyday thing, but on Sunday there's a mimosa bar in which you can have champagne and pureed orange, mango, white peach, and a couple of other flavors. By Sunday alcohol is not usually on my list of what I want to drink, but I have started to try a glass here or there.

Whenever you can find the time to fit this place into your Vegas trip, make it happen. Oh and you'll only spend ~$20 for a Sunday burnch. So worth it.",gi9yQpVJj2Mps5SbBMMHSA,8,8,5,qTK_2dhBqv3IGsyQ3VM-8Q
1692719,2013-12-17,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Seasons Buffet is okay. It's not the best buffet I've ever been to, but it is decent enough that I don't mind coming back here from time to time, especially when a family member has a free buffet coupon to use.

I know it's silly, but I love that Seasons has honey mustard as one of its salad dressing. It's my favorite salad dressing and I don't often see it at other buffets. The food itself is good, nothing fancy or life changing, but good. You can order a plate of custom pasta from the pasta counter which is nice and there's always enough food that I like. There is also plenty of food that looks greasy and unappetizing to me.

The dessert counter is where Seasons Buffet fails though. For as often as I go to Seasons, I find a lot of their cookies and cake slices dry and difficult to eat. Only once did I find a moist cake to eat, their Boston Cream cake, and I was so surprised.

The things that shone through were the ""make your own Pasta Bar"" You fill a bowl of veggies and then chef cooks your choice of pasta and sauce. The penne alfredo w/garlic added was cooked perfectly and tasted like  a real homemade sauce and is almost good enough for an entire meal as they serve you a giant plate. Of course, you have to keep trying other stuff. Also in the very good category were Fried Clams (crispy), Fried Shrimp, creamed corn (with peppers), lima beans and pearl onions and they had some decent carving stations if you like sausage and red meats. I was hoping for turkey. Overall the deserts and salad's were very average and the polenta, minestrone soup and a few other dishes did not cut the mustard.

1925565,2013-11-28,1,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Very disappointed in the turn this buffet has taken.  I've eaten there probably 50+ times (four times in the last two weeks) and in the last few months it has just become OK as opposed to a place I'd want to eat.  

My biggest disappointment is that they have removed the beef brisket from the line up.  It was always my favorite and one of the most flavorful tender briskets I've had.  That was the main draw for me, as with many of my friends.  

Now I've been told by Silverton that they have brisket every day.  I'm not sure what they think brisket is, but what they are serving is roast beef.  I'm from the South and I know my brisket.  What they are trying to pass off as brisket is actually a cut of meat from hind quarters of the cow as opposed to a flat cut from the breast section.  Brisket can be flaked apart with a fork, as opposed to having to be cut with a knife the way the roast beef they are serving has to be.  

Also, it used to be a much wider variety of food on various days, now it is the same thing every day!  The only thing that seems to change up is the Asian section.  

I asked to talk to a manager tonight, right after we arrived.  I explained how much I loved their brisket and asked when and if if would ever be back.  She said she would talk to the Chef and let me know what she found out.  She never came back.  

I was recently traveling for 10 weeks, so I wasn't in during that time, but if I recall correctly, things started changing before I left.  I was told that they had a new chef, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with some of the changes.  It was perfect before, why change what isn't broken.

I sure hope I don't have to take Seasons Buffet off my recommended list.",nTGPIseYL1KiIpi7ZelVNQ,2,1,2,tLKDn4FHwxHtARh78IJlkA
1950003,2016-05-04,21,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Seasons Buffet is exactly the kind of hidden joint I'd expect to find when exploring eateries outside of the Strip.  And although, it's not really all that totally off Strip, it's far enough away that your efforts to visit them will be rewarded with extra attentive service and better eats.

Best of all, Seasons easily outshines other similarly priced buffets with the sheer quality and variety of their offerings.

So, first of all, the place looks great: modern space with plenty of legroom so not to impend on the comfort zone of fellow diners, a back wall filled with enough tvs to watch the game and the Food Network at the same time, and best of all, each and every serving station is pristine.

I liked finding two buffet items normally not served during lunch: grilled veggies and brisket.  The brisket was tender and juicy.  It was a little under seasoned but if you dab a little BBQ sauce, it's bound to impress.  The grilled veggies were crisp, slightly caramelized, and probably one of the healthiest things I may have ever had at a buffet (is that sad?).

The showcase item was their fish tacos.  And I'll be the first to admit, they are exceptionally done.  The outer taco shell is crisp-ily grilled while the inner shell stays bendy enough to help house, not only the moist and tender fish, but all the fixings that make it so yummy.  My only gripe is that you're limited to only 2 tacos per order . . . which, I guess, in retrospect is pretty smart considering I'd probably go overboard and OD on them.

The desserts were a little disappointing . . . but to be expected for a buffet.  They were mostly bad but not completely terrible.  I was able to finish half a scoop of cappuccino ice cream and a sliver of cake; although, the fact that I don't remember what cake should say something.

Fortunately, instead of ending my outing with dessert I had one last order of fish tacos.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,30,28,4,Ya0Jk4VT0dZjbQTj-cyglA

The other eateries at the Silverton get good reviews and often have very good specials, but even though I am tempted to try them, I constantly find myself eating at the Seasons Buffet.

The biggest con of this buffet is that it is a bit on the small side and has limited selection. That is the only thing keeping it from receiving 5 stars. They do have different theme nights so that variety does make up a bit for the small size.

That being said, it is one of my favorite buffets. The food is good. They manage to put out food that tastes good without being overly greasy. Other buffets like greasy food since grease tastes good and is filling, but not here. They manage to provide a great spread for the price without resorting to having half the items being fried.

I remember when only a few months ago one would be waiting an hour or more in line on a Friday or Saturday night before reaching the cashier, then an additional 20-30 wait to get seated.  Last night (Friday) my wife and I thought we hit our own mega lottery when we saw no line to wait in.  We soon found out why.
For the admission cost, using our gaming card, of 2 adults @ $13.99, a minor @ $13.99 and a child @ $6.99 we paid about $49 + added tip.

Unfortunately pre-tipping is a double edged sword.  Sometimes your server is more motivated to proved better service because they see you gave them great tip or they figure, mehhh, they got your $ so I don't care at this point.  Well, ours was in the second category..what a slug.  We had to ask for our frigging silverware.  Asked for extra napkins, and no, that does not mean just 1  each for the kids.  Drink refills, empty plate takeaways, don't get me started. 

The food selection was abysmal!  The crab legs were removed from the buffet and replaced with a made to order bananas foster/cherries jubilee section.  (This is not mentioned on their website incidentally).  The self peel shrimp that shared the crab leg section has moved over to where the sushi was offered near the salad bar.  Yup, you guessed it...no more sushi offerings.

Let's see what else did they cheapen out on which is selected in their lower buffet price?  Oh yeah, they offer meatballs in their Italian section, but no pasta for them, yup, there's no pasta offerings at all.  C'mon folks, pasta is a cheap, buffet fill the masses up cheap category.  I fact, the only noodle type offering they had was chow mein.  

My kids were disappointed as one of their all time faces at this buffet was the coconut shrimp, which was no longer offered.

The guy at the carving station was obviously in a pissed off mood the night we were there: he was literally dropping/throwing the meat on the plates anywhere.  

The positives?  Hmmm????  The cabbage rolls were good, the carved beef, (when you recovered from your plate almost tipping over from the asshole chef flopping the meat onto it), the yams, the shrimp, the lemon chicken.  You get the point.

So I guess, we won't be returning to this buffet anytime soon.  For the same price, one is better off going to GVR;'s buffet that has a much wider election that is a whole lot tastier and better wait staff too.",mvCj6kjmLJSsgvqpD36sIQ,1,0,1,p2cEUtBiPpKGo3f4q9DT2A

Thru the month of Oct, sign up for a players card and get a coupon from one of the kiosks to print out a BOGO coupon for the same day. That comes out to about $5pp for a buffet. And you know what? The food wasn't bad! Now this isn't the best buffet ever, but for $5pp it served it's purpose.

The fish tacos are surprisingly good. The fish is grilled, not fried, so you don't have to worry about soggy fish. The fish itself is very moist and smooth. Lots of other standard buffet items, but what sets this place apart is the cooking stations. You can get made to order pasta, meat at the carving station, etc. 

Another tip is to play some games the same day you get your players card. With only 50 points you get a coupon for another free buffet! We used it the following Sat for the Bellini Brunch. Surprisingly, the food at the brunch wasn't as good as the Thurs lunch. There were some standouts though. The eggs benedict was one of the best buffet benedicts I've had. The Hollandaise was make correctly. Very rich and buttery, with a nice kick of lemon tartness. There's prime rib at the carving station, and some ho hum sushi. Desserts were better on Sat tho.  The Bellinis available were raspberry, mango, sunset, orange, and another I'm forgetting.

I'd definitely come back again this Thurs to take advantage of the BOGO. Hey that's tomorrow! If you come between 2-3pm there won't be a line. We got in line right before noon and we waited 40 mins to get to the cashier. The dining room isn't that large, so all tables were full.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,8,6,4,NUzjBAQJEn4zfPIaIqXl0g

Even before the discovery of hair in my scrambled eggs, they were pretty unimpressive, coming from the culinary tradition of ""let's mindlessly let some eggs bake on the skillet, then chop them up with a spatula and call it 'scrambled.'""

The waffle was inoffensive. No fruit or cream, though, and you'll have to fight the omelette station patrons to get near the maple syrup. Don't forget to hit the salad bar for butter. It's next to the cream cheese, which would suggest bagels, but instead the only bread you'll find there is dinner rolls

Most of the breakfast buffet, other than single tight wedge of eggs, potatoes (bland), and waffle squares, is Asian fare and lunch-suitable items. My one vegetarian choice was some macaroni and cheese of a neon orange hue, right down to the squirts of oil that came out of every bite. Ick.

Dessert selection was less remarkable than I remembered. A sort of croquembouche is on display, but nothing that elegant is actually available. Flan, cookies, carrot cake. I remember that on previous trips, those made since Seasons turned on me, usually resulted in a ""decent but unremarkable"" dessert buffet experience for lack of other options, but this time I just wanted to get out. I did make myself a salad, and that was fine, but couldn't stand on its own as a reason to dip into the dining budget. (Keep in mind that, with 2-for-1 coupon, my meal was only $5.40.)

Unless you are a captive tourist with a coupon, you can do better at so many other places. In fact, I'm hard-pressed to tell you where you can do worse.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,2,2,5essvceGPHCTSLi0AwJEYg

2354494,2011-08-25,1,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"First, let me explain my star-rating if I may.. 

NO buffet, not even the M Buffet will ever get 5 stars. Why? BECAUSE IT'S A BUFFET, that's why. Let's be real here folks, buffets are glorified cafeteria food, the same food if not a slight grade above employee dining food. So when we're talking buffet ratings, a 4 star deal, in my opinion would be the MAX. 

When the stress of the day along with record temperatures leave my brain fried, I tend to not be in the market for even the most minor decision making. Though I am not a huge fan of group troff dining, it seems to be the best bet when undecided is the verdict for where and what to eat for dinner. 

If you are not starving when you first arrive at the Silverton, have no fear, the hour wait just to be seated (even on a Wednesday) will have your stomach growling by the time your butt hits the seat. 

Salad, soup are your usual suspects at any buffet along with the dessert station. But the Italian cuisine was delicious and not your typical spaghetti and pizza, they threw in some rolled eggplant, and fried raviolis, yum! The Asian area was pretty decent..well the noodles were good, the fried rice tasted like Mexican rice to me, which worked out considering they didn't have a Spanish themed station at all there! (weird). 

The carving station: WOW, I'm not sure what sort of animal they slaughtered for the ""prime rib"" but it could very well have been a dinosaur. I've never seen a bone-in hunk of meat so large in my life. Since I'm not a meat eater this made my stomach turn and I quickly sprinted past the station to some more animal friendly choices.. such as mac and cheese (yum) and some fried fish. 

Dessert was decent. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to peel a crunchy layer back from anything I tasted, it was all sliced and served fresh! Best part was cheesecake and ice cream (chocolate chip mint), worst, the pumpkin pie (ick!). 

All in all, was it worth the wait.. sure, almost anythings worth the wait when your starving, ha ha. Would I eat there again, sure, why not.

2360860,2011-12-04,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"They've stepped down the quality of their Polynesian Night a bit. They got rid of the tako (octopus) poke and the quality of the roast pig was bad, two of the main reason I go there for.  The roast pig was dry and completely cold, some gelatinous substance was even forming, almost wanted to throw up after eating a few pieces.  The ahi poke, which they do have, is a weird recipe I think they were trying to stretch it out by adding more veggie ingredients.  As always I am a fan because I get to stuff my face with lau lau, kalbi ribs, poi, huli huli chicken, made to order pasta, desserts, kalua pig and cabbage, but now I'm kinda debating if the buffet is worth the $20.99 for the Polynesian Night.

As far as local casinos go, I'd say it's above average. Definitely better than the coast and most station buffets. 

Last time I went was on Friday for their seafood buffet. I ate crab legs, peel and eat shrimp, oysters rockefeller and a decent paella. The crab legs were a little overcooked and hard to crack. They are precut which is supposed to make them easier to crack but the shell was a bit rubbery so they were kind of pain to deal with. When I did get to the meat it was not overly salty which I really like. Lots of buffet crab legs (and buffet food in general) is too salty for my taste.

This Silverton runs some good promotions periodically and Friday night we bought 2 buffets for the price of 1. It was $25 before tip. We arrived around 6:30ish and there was no waiting but there was a decent line when we were leaving. The service was pretty standard. Our waiter brought us drinks, extra napkins and cleared our plates. Which is important to me. When I am finished eating I want my plate out of my face, now.

Of course this isn't the fanciest restaurant but the atmosphere was overall really nice. The ambience was quiet and quite intimate almost. Went here with my husband, it was $19/person with a members card. Service was good and attentive. The asian guy as our bus person and the ladies at the cashiers were friendly. No line on a Friday night around 7!
We had a good experience but disappointed in the limited amount of food. They had a German section, seafood, salad, Italian, asian, and dessert. They all contained about 6 dishes. We didn't even try the salad because it looked..well plain. The watermelon was sweet though! The Italian section was probably the richest flavored. Had pasta, pizza, other stuff I don't recall.  The asian was nothing extraordinary. Singapore noodles were probably the best in my opinion. Egg drop soup was good. 
I didn't try much of the German food, but my husband did. He is German himself and he didn't want me to try some of the things because he said it'll give me a bad rep of the food lol. 
They had good sir loin however. Went back for seconds. 
Seafood was mostly fried stuff (cod, oyster, clam, shrimp). 3/5 for those. They also had cocktail shrimp (nothing special, was low the whole night) and cedar plank salmon(not too big of a fan). 
The dessert had the biggest variety but nothing that appealing. Chocolate strawberries were good. Only three ice cream flavors (Neapolitan).",xz1jrij3rrSU3t2eTsXirg,1,0,3,GbfHt9hqB_NYowcRyR6Ccg

This buffet is amazing!  I would have gave this place a 5 star rating if it weren't for the ridiculously long line and grumpy lady at the dessert counter.  Aside from that.. superb and highly recommended!

Pros:
  +  The best Prime Rib I have ever feasted on
  +  Inviting ambiance with spacious seating
  +  steamed crab w/ the option to toss in flavors

Cons:
  -  Lines are way too long
  
Okay, let me start off with the negative...  I met my girlfriend at Silverton since I was coming from work.  My girlfriend arrived at 4:30pm.  I arrived at near 5:00pm and we didn't get to our table until 6:15pm!  That's ridiculous!  Friday is Seafood day (which is the day we went) and starts at 4pm.  I was starving by the time we got in (good considering I was about to devour AYCE style).  Dinner on Friday Seafood night is $22.99 with your Silverton card.  This is a good price in comparison to the likes of Wynn and the M buffet.  I hated the wait, but was really surprised at the quality of the food.  The service was really good too aside from a grumpy worker in the dessert section.  

Overall:
  I would highly recommend this buffet to people.  This is overall the best buffet I have ever been to.  The quality, price, and service combined makes this an awesome experience.  

Tips:
*  Different days have different specials:
Friday Dinner is Seafood Night
Thursday Dinner is Polynesian Night (Hawaiian)
Tuesday Dinner is Cowboy Night (BBQ) 
(I'm not too sure about Tuesday being Cowboy night.. Call first if you are interested in this one.

*  Try the Prime Rib....AMAZING!

*  The crab laid out is cold crab.  If you want boiled crab, you have to ask for it. 

*  Don't forget to get your crab sauteed in flavor. I got Garlic butter YUM!

*  Save room for dessert: a selection of sugar-free desserts.  I'd recommend the Cappuccino Ice Cream (this one isn't sugar-free).

*  Show up early to avoid the wait in line.  

* Sign up for the Player's card for free buffet at Silverton.  

*  Lunch hours end at 3pm and Dinner starts at 4pm.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,1,2,4,BNVHgRs_McirrIiTMUvilQ

For breakfast they had bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, biscuits with country gravy, french toast, granola, oatmeal, country fried steak, potatoes Au Gratin, and a ""make your own omelet"" section. The country gravy was probably the best I've ever had! Not too thick and it was just oozing with flavor. It was so good we even poured it over our omelets. We went back to the buffet for breakfast seconds and that's when we noticed the whole other half of the buffet was now open for the lunch selection. They had an Asian food section with chow mein, orange chicken,broccoli Beef, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and fried rice; An Italian section with pizzas, pastas, and I believe they were opening up a ""build your own pasta"" section because I read some sign that read: First, choose your own sauce. And the salad bar with a few choices of soup. Since I was already kind of full from my first plate, I just got a bowl of tomato soup, which was very tasty. Don got a giant piece of brisket, which he described as ""ok,"" but within a few minutes the whole piece was nonexistent. Before we left, I checked out the dessert section which included assorted pies/cakes, gelato, gingerbread cookies, and breakfast pastries.

2978957,2012-08-23,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Went for brunch for the third time here and it was the best it's ever been. Simply because of their crab legs. I mean, damn. So good. I like the ones you have to break with your hands. It's more fun to me! Yeah you have to work a little bit more, but at least you don't have crab falling out of its shell like aria and cosmos Buffet. The other two times I've been here, the crab sucked. Plain and simple, it was smaller - harder to snap and it tasted terrible. Now it's totally different!

You have 4 options on the crab. Cold, steamed, Cajun sautéed, or Garlic sautéed. Both sautéed were delicious! 
Another part of this buffet that I enjoyed was the Asian section, the chicken dish and beef noodle dish was great. And the pizza was really good.
I think this is one of the best buffets because of the food but how can you beat the price??? $17.99, for free champagne too?!? One of the best buffets for the money in Vegas!",sKiHN8YAavBvWC0DsT5UOw,1,1,4,2PQcIFOI_ECTozvaAM4-mw
2989311,2018-04-16,2,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"This buffet is located at the Silverton Casino. I have stumbled away food drunk from this Fine Epicurious Gastronomique establishment many a time. If I time it right I hit it on a Saturday which is Polynesian night where I spend a few hours devouring Fred. (Fred is the name I gave to the roasted suckling pig) Although, Old Fred is long gone his name still lives on in memory through is brothers and sisters who graciously offered up themselves (as Fred) every Saturday night for the firm price of $23.80 gratuity not included. 
Besides Old Tasty Fred. This buffet offers up a lot of tasty Polynesian fare that one might miss unless of course you go to Polynesia. Or come here and stand in line for almost 2 hours with mostly Polynesian folks some the size and strength of tanks that could easily kill you with one punch. That being said,  you know the place is worth it.
Some of my personal favorites are the Ahi Poke, Lomi Lomi, Tako Poke, Sushi, Kalbi Beef Ribs, Suckling Pig with Crispy Skin, Kalua Pork Loin, Pork Lau Lau.

The beverage server was on the mark - our cups were never empty of coffee. Unlimited Samosas were included which was great - and I am not a frequent drinker but I did have one Saturday.  Good amount of food to choose from and everything tasted good.  Nothing really to complain about.  Not top notch but worth a revisit.,n1nwqkkD3Y3GyydprQqVsg,0,0,3,p4DjOAlEC6jB-kKn2oNsMQ
3098874,2014-09-30,2,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Well I've been here several times now for the Polynesian night  and I have to say that the food is good for the price. That being said, I only go when I have the two free buffets  promotion (with the Silverton Rewards Club  Card) and with only two people... so yeah, it's really worth it. A lot of items are hit or miss but overall I can't complain and it has actually gotten better each time I go. There usually  isn't much of a wait and the food is always hot and generally fresh.  If you haven't tried it in a while, wait for the promotion and try it again after all free food is better than.. well okay.. it's free food, deal with it.  For the rest of the review, keep in mind that we brought two teens with us that took our price from free to just over $40 before tip. Also, this review is ONLY for the Polynesian night.

Now, for what's good. Their tuna poke seems to occupy a considerable portion of my plate each time. The giant roasted pig freaked the kids out but whatever, they think McDonalds rules the world so they don't count. The roasted pig is very good every time I have it. There was also some salt and pepper pork that seriously made an impression on everyone at the table including the grumpy, texting teens. There were a couple of soups that were really good especially the one over by the sushi that had the clear noodles. I don't remember the name but it looked so nasty that I just had to try it and to my surprise it was actually very good. The Wonton soup was very good as well. The mashed potatoes and bowtie pasta were great. I even had a couple pieces of a spicy tuna roll that didn't offend me as sushi on a buffet can often do.  Also, the peel  and eat shrimp was good but naturally should have been fail proof one would think.  The oysters are usually decent enough except for the fact that they ran out of them by 4:45pm. We arrived at 4:30pm and they open at 4pm and I didn't even get one. Not cool. I stood there and watched as the guy in front of me filled up two plates until there were none left. I was impressed with his lack of consideration for the line of  people behind him and yet jealous at the same time.  The empty space was replaced with clams that had something on them that I wasn't all that impressed with.  The clams were fresh but the topping just ruined it for me, not my thing I guess.

 Some misses were believe it or not the macaroni and cheese. Bad enough to spit out. Same  goes for the macaroni  salad and popcorn shrimp. Just bad. Like take it off the buffet entirely kinda bad. No really. Now for the prime rib. Usually it is pretty good. This last time was different. It was cooked entirely rare and if anyone wanted it cooked differently it was sliced and put on a grill to be cooked to their liking. As I watched cooked slices being handed off to other customers it looked like nothing more than a bad steak. I opted for mine rare as I generally like it. Unfortunately I couldn't even eat that. I felt really bad having to leave an excellent  cut of meat on my plate. It just felt wrong.

Overall, the food (on Polynesian night)was good enough to go back, when it's free (or BOGO), if you don't bring teens, just happen to be in the area and are in general just really hungry enough to not care.
You just need to find what you like and stick with that. Unfortunately this isn't the type of buffet where you walk in and love every single item that they have. I give it three stars only because I know that what is good is really good and that comprises more than half of the buffet. As for the rest of the buffet,  it may be a bit blah but a person can only eat so much anyway. I just go back to the good stuff and that works for me. If I had to pay the regular price of $21.99 I probably wouldn't go.

While in the car I was reading reviews on here and started second guessing my decision. There were such AWFUL reviews I was nervous but figured since I had a BOGO coupon it would be worth it even if it was meh. 
When we arrived the atmosphere was great, I loved the layout of the place. They have a BELLINI BAR! They offer peach, pomegranate, mango, and raspberry bellinis as well as mimosas! And they're all included in the brunch buffet. I've had build you own bloody bars but choose your own bellinis? I was impressed. 
I held my breath walking up to the food and let out a sigh of relief when I saw that not only was it clean, everything looked fresh. My first plate was stereotypically brunch. I got waffles, an egg frittata, bacon, sausage, and a blintz. The waffles were actually soft unlike any buffet I've been to, usually they're hard as a rock from being under a heat lamp. The bacon was thick and delicious, the egg frittata was good. Overall my first plate impressed me as I was expecting dry, gross food. 
The second plate I loaded with mac and cheese, turkey from the carving station, stuffing, and mashed potatoes which I smothered in gravy. I also got some sort of Mexican soup. The turkey was moist, the gravy perfect, and the mashed potatoes were to die for. I don't know why I was in a thanksgiving food mood but I was, and it was awesome. 
For dessert I got a Boston creme cake and a red velvet cupcake. Both were excellent. I had about five different bellinis. Overall it's the best brunch buffet I've been to in Vegas aside from wicked spoon, which is higher end anyway so you can't really compare the two.

First, it is easy to access (right by Highway 15) and it is easy to park there. The line at the cashier can unfortunately get very long though. I was there on a Sunday and since they had a BOGO deal the line was very long and it took us over almost an hour to actually pay and then get a table, when there were a lot of free tables available... 

Once in there, service was good and the food decently good as well. This buffet is reasonably priced and you get food that really isn't that bad for a buffet. There is also a rather large selection of food options.

The main problem with this buffet is that they will kick you out after 90 minutes there! So be ready to eat and drink as fast as you can, which can be a problem since the lines at the bar are sometimes pretty long and it can easily take 10 minutes to get one drink. At some point, the bar ran out of clean glasses and I didn't get any drink for over 20 minutes...

I liked the meat when it was freshly put out (for example i kinda had an older piece of bbq pork i didn't like, but my husband got a new piece and it was pretty tender).  I liked the shrimp cocktail because they devein the shrimp, and it's easier to take off the shell.  The shrimp tasted pretty fresh! I've had like a boiled or tough kind of shrimp so this was pretty good.  The dessert wasn't too bad. Overall was pretty good considering we got it for free!

Our waiter came by three times to check on us, each time asking if I would like a refill on my iced tea. I said yes please three times and yet never had it refilled even once. 
This was one of the worst buffets I have ever been to. Don't let this review detour you. Give it a try, but go into it with your level of expectation being pretty low.",OXwmkyamQ5H6Ed0xZo_kQA,4,0,1,nh-0sjyoYzJC2wKP26kD5Q

My Mom and I went to this casino to watch the Mermaid Fish Feeding Show but saw their $5 Seasons Buffet ad as we walked out of the elevator. It sounded a good deal so we lined up for the buffet. With a price like that, naturally who would let that pass? There was a line of people waiting to get in, both locals and tourist. But it's all worth the wait.
Immediate service upon getting seated. Our drink orders were taken and served fast. Generous food on the buffet line-up. Self-service, all-you-can-eat. Seafood (with crawfish, shrimps, crab legs among others), Salad Bar and Desserts (includes my favorite German chocolate cake. It was rich and creamy and loved the mint ice cream with my preferred toppings of nuts, chocolate fudge, butterscotch cream, sprinkles, M&Ms), Italian, Meat Carving Station, Grilled Vegetabes, Asian, Mexican, Soups, Fresh Fruit, and American cuisine. Hush puppies, Pecan Pie and Prime Rib were excellent. Food is tasty through all the bites. Ever-hospitable servers and buffet station servers were attentive. ""Live Action"" Chefs cook food fresh. Food servers dressed in brown country-style outfits with boots. Booths and table seatings abound in this large dining room. Decor is very pleasing for a hotel that's somewhat new. We go to this buffet at least twice a month.

Mondays are also Seniors All-Day Buffet Day at this Seasons ""Live Action"" Buffet at Silverton Lodge Casino at 11am-8pm for $5.

One of the cooks sliced me of a big honkin' piece of crispy skin, and I saw that no one was touching the pig's feet, so I asked for the ENTIRE front leg/foot :) the top half was very meaty and tasted more like Chinese-style roast pork, but from the kneecap down, it was totally inedible, just bone and tough skin. The ahi and tako poke were good, as was the lomi salmon and the 3 bowls of poi I had.

Dessert was kinda sad...no haupia, and slim pickin' on the rest of the sweets. The company was better than the food.Guess I'll stick to Island Flavor next time I'm in the mood for some Hawaiian grindz....ALOHA!!!

3813514,2017-04-18,7,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"This review is based on their Polynesian Luau Buffet every Saturday evening. My family and I have been homesick and was looking for a place to enjoy a Hawaiian style dinner. We have been reccomended by fellow 9th islanders and my parents stumbled across an Ad inside Las Vegas edition of Kama'aina magazine and with the help of Yelp we decided to give this place a go. We haven't been to Silverton in years so we were bit surprised to see the upgrade throughout the property.

Once we arrived at 5pm, there was a long line with the familar Pidgin accent that was spoken among the many customers in line. The Aloha spirit was present including the many Ohanas(families) that filled up the Buffet. It took approximately 30min. when we finally got seated inside plus it didn't help that they we came across alot of Uncles and Aunties, Lol. 

The food items that were present was abundant in selection and typical to what you would find in Hawaii. FYI, Hawaiian food is influence by 5 cultures that includes China, Japan, Philippines, Korea and Portugal. This unique blend of cuisine is known locally among Hawaiians as, ""local food.""

The items that we had were,
-Roasted Pork w/ the head of the pig.
-Ahi Poke
-Tako Poke
-Lomilomi Salmon
-Pork Laulau
-Teriyaki Beef
-Seaweed Salad
-Cucumber Salad
-Kimchi
-Poi
 and various items.

Everything was fresh and delicious with a few items that could use a little improvement. The Teriyaki Beef was a bit dry and the Ahi Poke was a bit salty but consistent with flavor. I personally like the Pork Laulau, which is pork meat that is wrapped up in Taro leaves and steamed. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere felt like we were back home! It would've been nice if they had a Hula, Polynesian and Tahitian Dancers to set the mood, Lol. Even having island style music play in the background would've been nice to have. Then again I could wait for the Pure Aloha Festival for the Entertainment. Overall, I would personally come back and take family and friends to check this Buffet out.

No. No. No. No. I don't think so my friendly friends.

Here you go: 

Waffles not good. 
No butter or whipped cream or fresh strawberry to go on waffles. 
Only cheap nasty strawberry giz goo stuff. 
French toast was some weird deep fried crap with oatmeal on the outside. 

The fruit spread was just 2 bowls. One watermelon and one other melon cut into crude chunks is a $20 brunch... there should be beautifully sliced fruit... not disgusting hunks of fruit put in a bowl.) 
The orange juice had a bizarre Tang like flavor to it. 
We got up for 3 minutes after having only been there for 15 and when we came back they had cleared our table. How nice.

We visited the Seasons Buffet TWICE in a one month period for their Polynesian Luau.  First time was because got a coupon from a Hawaiian magazine that offered a 2 for the price of 1.  Second time was because the brother in-law was in town.  I handily admit...the 1st visit with the one FREE buffet was soooo much sweeter!  Mainly because it was cheaper.  I delve in cheap.  Except with health insurance, you can never be too cheap.

Of course, for a Saturday night the buffet was busy!  Line wasn't too bad though, maybe a 15 minute wait.  And lots of Hawaiians!  Can't be all that bad then, right?!  Go where the locals go!

OK - this being a specialty night with their Polynesian Luau, I stayed away from the other 'American' food for the most part to focus on the island eats!  All Hawaiian food for me, baby!  And I gotta tell you...I enjoyed all of it!  It was really almost like being at home on Maui...except the lack of a proper BEACH!  

Food was ONO-licious!!  That means 'yummy' to some of you!  I get it, may not be the top in quality when compared to an actual luau in Hawaii but the effort is totally there!  The local Hawaii food we're used to was all there:

-FULL roasted suckling pig!
-Pork Lau Lau!
-Ahi poke!
-Lomi Lomi Salmon!
-Teriyaki beef!
-POI!
-Even Haupia!

I think I ate like King Kamehameha!  Multiple servings of everything!  I understand some of y'all think this kind of food is well...gross...but for a local boy this is a taste of home!  I definitely stuffed by belly full!  Quality of food was great too even with some minor missteps.  Roasted pig was good but wish the skin was crispier.  Ahi poke was good but should have had less onions.  Same thing for the Lomi Lomi Salmon.  Teriyaki beef was good but sauce shouldn't be runny, beef should be MARINATED in the sauce - not sauce poured on afterwards.  Poi was surprisingly pretty fresh, not sour!  Haupia was made like back home, perfect!

I'm not gonna complain about the price either for Seasons Buffet Polynesian Luau, cheaper than a luau back home!  With the Silverton player's club card, only $19.99 a person!  Totally good value for all you're getting!  And don't forget, you still get access to all the other buffet eats like prime rib!  Pizza!  Sushi!  Absolute food fest.

Had an excellent time at the Polynesian Luau at Seasons Buffet, we'll be back again for sure!

Like many of you guys, we check yelp before we visit the place. 

It's Saturday brunch. This is by far the worst casino buffet we've been to. Fried food is dry and hard enough to be a weapon. If there is food fight in this buffet, people will seriously get hurt. I got chicken fry steak. Took a bite, feel like I was biting into a hockey pot. Shrimp popcorn, hard and chewy. 

Sushi display is something I've never seen before. Usually sushi station is clean and organized. But not this one, sushi is piled up on top of each other, rice got stick to each other, filling is falling out. It looks like a one big plate of sushi fry rice. 

Every single station we saw was messy and not clean. We never seen a buffet this messy and not organized. As we watched the employees who prepared the food behind the station, we realized why. 

Unlike most buffet, most buffet when food it out, they pick up the tray, clean the area, put in fresh tray of fresh food. But not this buffet, the employees put food on top of old ones, they don't even bother pick up the old tray, they simple scoop the new food and slap into the old tray. As a result, food is getting more salty, hardened, messier....

we don't know how's the new chef and what the ""good yelp review "" were talking about. Don't believe those. They are NOT TRUE.",Vip3CX1S9Ed6C57JLAeqHA,7,0,1,8laleOn5htRTYjEP3SHUhA

How do you have bad service at a buffet? Seasons manages it! The person who led us to our dirty table was a fat balding woman who didn't greet us, instead jutted her fat arm into the air half way across the restaurant for us to follow.

4142668,2014-03-27,7,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"So let me start off with a basic fact about me...I am NOT a buffet person!  I will NEVER, EVER  suggest we go to a buffet.  I only go when I am outnumbered or when family is visiting. So take this review as you may.  

I went here for the first time this week since I had family staying at the Silverton.  I have eaten at many of the restaurants there and have always been happy, so I was aware of the food quality level and just went with it.  

It started off with us in a short line to pay and be seated.  Even though it was a really short line, it took over 25 minutes to get a table.  I'm not sure why, because there were a lot of open tables that I could see and they seemed to be adequately staffed, so I am not sure where the disconnect was.  So that just put me in a bad mood because I was pretty hungry.  Just a warning for y'all, when I get hungry, throw a cracker or something at me because I turn into that girl from the Exorcist when I am starving.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Next up, the food.  I was actually surprised how many sections they had available.  There was a soup and salad bar, pasta bar, pizza, American comfort food, Chinese, Mexican, roasted/grilled meats, and a dessert bar that included freshly made ice cream.  It wasn't a huge buffet, but i found plenty of items that looked and tasted pretty good.  No, it wasn't as big as the World Buffet at the Rio or fancy like the Wynn, but it was ok for what it was.  So yay for that surprise!

The service across the board was hit or miss.  Our table server was very nice and on her game.  She did great.  The hostesses were all a bit grumpy.  Some of the chefs behind the food counters were not happy to be there, but the chef at the meat craving station was just adorable.  The chef in the dessert section was happy.  So it was a little all over the place.

So Seasons is an average buffet for Vegas quality.  If you are a buffet person and in the area, it is an ok place.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,9,7,3,B_qYQ5eCvfeS-SSs7e7_dg

My friend got a coupon in the mail and he invited me to come, my guess it is Hawaiian nite, being that there were many Hawaiian dishes, food was just okay but the most worrisome thing was that there are no dedicated serving utensils for each dish, and you have to use the same utensil for serving multiple items, I have a allergy to shrimp, and at the pasta area, the lady used the same spoon to ladle each ingredient, they have shrimp and clams to make pasta and the same spoon was used for garlic, cheese, onions etc , I told her I had allergies and she said it was fine, and continued making my dish, after 1 taste my mouth became itchy and irratated! My allergy is not as bad as some people's , so I have to wonder how many people they have injured or made sick due to this lack of basic food safety techniques???

After only 45 mins after opening, they ran out of the good sashimi (eel, tuna, shrimp, salmon) and just had ""ok"" rolls and a whitefish, not sure what it was.   The pickled ginger was the peak of the sushi menu - chilled, and plenty of it.  (Sarcam if you can't read it..)   

So, then I tried the pork.  The crispy skin (best part) was all gone, but the pork was tender. 

The poi (gotta ask for it) - and yes I asked for some - was a bit sweet for me.  

Lessee...the favorite luau food was the chili-lime chicken, because it was crispy!  The huli-huli chicken was ok, but a bit dry, so make sure you get plenty of sauce on the bottom of the pan.  

I passed on the prime rib- was overdone when I saw it two times.  Then the third pass on the way to the dessert bar, I looked good, but I was full.  the chocolate cake with mint ice cream was good -but average.  No gelato.  I looked for some fresh cut fruit, but it was canned, so passed on it.  

In conclusion: next time, and only with the $11 price tag, I'll try the beef, lau lau (hidden away), som-moah chili lime chicken wings, and eat the non-sushi items.  

Peel and eat shrimp is available, plenty of good choices with dessert and non-sugar added options, but try it once, and try something else.

We, being from Vegas, were not impressed for a Sunday night buffet. The buffet itself is very small in comparison to many others. The food was not terrible, but I wouldn't give it rave reviews either. Hubby tried the Ahi Poke, took one bite and didn't eat the rest, I could tell my looking at the barely pink ahi it was not fresh and tried to warn him (he thought maybe they put a 'sauce' on it that made it that color, he tried it anyway. Not good, not sauce, just not fresh. They had Round Sirloin that my hubby thoroughly enjoyed, I felt it was over cooked and very dry, luckily they offered au jus and horseradish. The au jus had bay leaves floating it, I felt that was weird considering it looked like it came from a package, and had very little flavor, I think they added too much water to the package. I had a salad I made myself, of course, its a buffet, but the eggs (I believe it was the eggs), tasted like soap. I tried each bit of my salad separately, thinking maybe it was the plate, or my fork, but only when I grabbed some egg did I get the soapy flavor. It was weird, and I didn't finish the salad that was left due to it having egg. I tried the pizole, I have nothing to compare that to since it was my first time every having it. It was good, there was a nice hunk of meat in it and it had a flavor that I enjoyed. I tried their spring roll, w/sweet sour sauce, the spring roll was good, but the sauce was way to sugary for my liking, and not enough sour. For desert I had lemon meringue pie and carrot cake. The lemon meringue was good, and the carrot cake was good once I cut the hard sides off it (they need to take note and put paper on the sides to avoid this like other buffets do), but the frosting was to die for!

I even gave my credit card number to hold the reservation as the guest list for my party was 25 people.

We arrive at Seasons on the night of my rehearsal dinner and the incompetent girls at the register know nothing of my reservation. In fact, they point out to me, ""We don't take reservations"".

However when we got in there and looked at the selection, we couldn't believe how SMALL the buffet is. And how SMALL the crab legs were. We grabbed our first (and only round) of food and sat down. I realized I hadn't seen anything to cut the crab legs with and asked my server, who pointed me back the crab legs. I went back, seen nothing, and asked one of the cooks where I could find one. He said my server would bring me one. Great. I told him I was pointed here and he went and got me one. Again, small crab legs, the steak was fatty and over cooked, corn was soggy, just about the only thing we liked was the mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. And other than these items they had pizza, chicken, and fries. What a selection! Also, the desert looked like it had been sitting out for hours and tasted like it too.

It is very comparable in quality and pricing to the Feast Buffets at GVR and Red Rock, which are the feature buffets for the Station Casinos properties. Like you should do at any buffet, it's important to do a full assessment of the food offerings before choosing anything. Once you've analyzed the situation, then you can make well reasoned food choices and pace yourself as necessary. There always ends up being a few items that catch my eyes and allow me to leave full upon completion. A plus is that coupons for 50% off a buffet come regularly in the mail, which make the buffet an especially good deal. Since it's the closest casino to my house and the coupons keep arriving, I'll continue to come.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,1,2,4,8ZaOH565xIFJ8ujPPmlHBQ

Very pretty. The food was good. We went for lunch. Our buffet was comped because we joined and played in the Silverton Player's Club. The service was good more ""help yourself"" as opposed to what you'd experience say at the Mirage. However, I did notice the lunch buffet was only around 10.00 as opposed to the mega strip resorts being around 24.00 for lunch. I did not see what dinner cost was. The food was delicious and good quality. Overall the buffet was about half the size of the Mirage but remember you are paying half the price of the Mirage. I had the brisket and it was delicious!

But boy, what a spread this is! And all you really need to do is look around and see Hawaiians everywhere to know that this is the place to be for an awesome Saturday night buffet. I'm sort of a neophyte when it comes to this style of food but with the vast selections of seafood (no crab legs though) and even sushi, this was a good deal.

1. Hardly a line....everyone is at the strip which is so not the place to be, and look at me and my girls....3 people ahead of us...we are so close to crabs it's not even funny and I'm not just saying that because we are leaving Vegas.
2. Large round tables! Yes! I hate having to sit at square tables where you can't hear what is going on at the end and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the ketchup. These tables are huge and me and my girls can get to business which involves sharing photos, memories and mimosas.
3. CRAB! What the hell happened on the strip? I went to the buffet at the Bellagio for Sunday brunch and there was no crab! Are you joking? Whatev...we are at the Silverton, so pile it on. 
4. No rush! The friendly servers at the Silverton want you to sit down and stay awhile. No one pushing you out or frowning when you take obnoxious group photos.
5. When you are done eating you are steps away from the BASS PRO SHOP! Hello? Are we out of mace? It is a long trip home....we may need to check out the tents in case we get stuck somewhere....wait...are those stuffed wildlife? Who doesn't love stuffed wildlife? And the Gun selection! Wow! Well, you can definitely spend hours in the Bass Pro Shop that's for sure. Last time we left I ended up with a bottle of water, a pack of red vines and a giant stuffed Jackalope that we fondly named ""J-Lope"" and yes, she was so big she needed a seat belt.

The line wasn't terribly long, but it was rather slow. Just doesn't seem too efficient so I am sure $5 days must be ridiculous. 

Bellinis come in 5 flavors and I tried the raspberry and the passionfruit (they also had a pomegranate, orange, and pineapple I believe) which was decent, but I just didn't feel like having a drunk morning and getting all of the flavors. 

They have a basic salad station, breakfast food station (with a omelette station), chinese food area, American (with lamb and steamship beef roast carving), Italian station , seafood area (with steamed crab) and dessert (with ice cream station). 

I didn't try the steamed crab because it was a long line and I wasn't in the mood but the lamb and beef was okay. The surprising standout was salmon that was slightly smoked and served with a creamy dill sauce which was juicy and flavorful. 

Desserts were pretty meh. I took bites of cakes that werent very good and finally satisfied my sweet tooth more with the cheese blintz from the breakfast area which was good and a scoop of ice cream.

Service was pretty decent. The plates were cleared pretty fast and drinks refilled. 

Overall, it was a OK buffet. Nothing too terrible, but nothing standout. If you aren't here to get drunk or eat so much crab legs you give yourself a allergy then it might not be worth it, but I guess for some $20 isn't bad either.

I checked the reviews and figured it was worth a try. I should have checked the ""not recommended"" reviews section on yelp. This place was awful. Completely inedible garbage. It's rather suspicious that only the good reviews are shown and all the negatives are hidden. We went on Wednesday night at about 6:30pm for dinner. My husband had the Tomato Basil bisque, roasted chicken, and white rice. His thoughts were that the soup was actually a paste, the consistency of glue, the chicken was like cardboard, and the rice was crunchy. I tried the chicken soup, roasted turkey, corn on the cob, mashed potatoes, mac-n-cheese, stuffing and cranberry sauce (I was desperate to find anything worth eating). The chicken soup almost definitely came from a can, the turkey was juicy but devoid of any and all seasoning, corn on the cob looked promising but tasted like nothing at all and was somehow greasy, mashed potatoes were bland, mac had an off putting taste, stuffing was most likely a box and the cranberry sauce was totally canned. For dessert they kept with the theme. Pound cake that was dry and crumbly, strawberry sauce that clearly came from a frozen tub, and cookies that were probably sitting out all week. Look, I get that this place is cheap, but its really not that much less than other buffets in Vegas.

We thought that maybe it was due to it being kind of late and decided to give it a second try the next day, especially since it was free.  About an hour or so after we ate both of us had major upset stomachs.  So the second day we went earlier, but it was the same story.  Neither of us could really find anything that was very good and my husband only made it half way through dinner before he had to run to the bathroom.  I'm not saying it was food poisoning because it could have just been that the food didn't agree with our stomachs, but we complained to the managers and instead of pretending like they cared (because I know they really don't but its their job to at least pretend like they do) they tried to blame it on the half a hamburger my husband ate at HIS OWN WORK before we left for vegas (my husband is the manager at his restaurant) and they never apologized.  I only asked for one thing from the managers and it wasn't free nights at the hotel or anything.  The only thing I asked for was if they could comp us some pepto bismol from the guest shop and they wouldn't even do that.

The line wasn't too bad for a Friday night and it was their seafood buffet too!  The service was okay, not slow, but we did have to flag him down a time or two.  

Now, the food, the only reason to hit a buffet.  Meh.  Yes, that's my official review of the food.  I didn't touch the crab (I'm still traumatized from Darin C.'s picture, I really can't get that out of my head) but tried other seafood items.  It's really small compared to other casino buffets, but there was a decent amount of choices.  The prime rib was okay, I was able to get the yummy end that wasn't overcooked.  The hubby appreciated he could get his order grilled and not have to eat it medium rare.  There were fried seafood (shrimp, catfish) choices that got a thumbs up from the hubby.

Baby enjoyed herself, mainly because she loved all the compliments she kept getting from strangers.  She did look sad when they left and no one was telling her how cute she looked in her pigtails and new dress.  (A sudden vision of whats to come)

Anyways, would I go back?  Probably not, but it wouldn't be the worst place to end up.

- Come around 6-7pm, You'll be in line for a while. 
- I've eaten here a few times before, and their players card is pretty lenient with giving half-priced buffets. After a few rounds at the tables, I usually get a free buffet, or sometimes BOGO. They have a BOGO on the Casino Guide too. 
- In retrospect, I should have just used the BOGO for their new and improved Polynesian buffet, Saturdays from 4-9pm. The list looked great! All the favorites, including poke. Definitely going to come back for that! 
- Anyway, I usually get their chicken noodle soup and the salad. Better than Sweet Tomatoes in terms of soup. Their chicken noodle broth and chicken are great. Noodles are actually macaroni. Haha. Their salads have baby corn. That a premium veggie at ST. haha. 
- I don't get the Asian food much, since it takes worse than a cheap Chinese buffet, but I haven't had it in a while, so I decided to delve into it. The Sinapore noodles were like a spicy pancit, which I liked. Get the Wanton soup and Lemon chicken. 
- They have a chef making pasta for you, but I passed this time around. Typically, it's a bit too wet for my liking. Drenched with sauce. 
- Get the mussels, clams and shrimp. Goes out fast. 
- Service was quick. 
- Feast buffet has more of a Variety. But for about $8 a person, with a coupon, It's a good deal when you got it!",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,4,5,3,ZagewrIYMs34AzFev2rDuQ

Hmm with the salads it's a nice spread. Even tuna poke salad. And the fruits like watermelon were juicy and sweet.
From the lau lau to the roasted pig delicious. They never let the side dishes empty out. It would be nice if they had a ice cream machine so I could make my own sundaes. And the ice cream Batista didn't have any bowls either. Guess ill grab a soup bowl next time and bring it over. All in all a pleasant delicious experience.

       - Bellini Brunch - This review will be just on the bellini brunch. I've tried their lunch and dinner, but I much prefer the brunch.
       - Crab Legs - They steam up hot crab legs and give them out by the plateful. This makes the Brunch worth it already. There are a couple different dipping sauces (I like Cajun Spices) to choose from (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw?select=5VpD4EFcZid5P_yFHV4SQg#5VpD4EFcZid5P_yFHV4SQg).
       - Champagne - There's a champagne station to grab your mimosas and other brunch drinks.
       - Brunch - They have all the regular brunch things like an omelette station, bacon, sausage, country friend ham, eggs benny, waffles, etc.
       - Clams - They have steamed clams that are pretty good.
       - Cutting Station - They used to have prime rib which was really good, but now they only have roast beef, ham, and lamb.
       - Dessert - They have the normal desserts you'd see at a buffet (pies, ice cream, pastries). The two things that they have that others don't are donuts and a chocolate fountain.
       - Overall - I come back for the crab legs, clams, and generic brunch items. If you don't like crab legs or clams, there's probably no point in coming here. There are a lot of other brunch buffets with better items.
**Price**
       - $17.99 with Rewards card - Bellini Brunch - Sundays 9am - 3pm.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend the Sunday brunch if you like hot crab legs.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,1,4,k3FQzhXnNMst2bqN1RbxhA

I was watching our server running between 15 different tables. There was no time for guest service other than get them their drinks and clear tables. It took 10 minutes before we saw our server because he was swamped. 

The food quality is substandard fare. The salad bar was one of my favorite stations because it had roasted beets. There wasn't anything special, but it was consistent and well kept. The shrimp cocktail were not bad either. Other than that, I would skip everything else.

I wouldn't go again. Salad bar was the best part. Spinach and strawberry salad was the highlight. Desert ok. Most signs did not match food.  For example: The ""fried chicken"" was roasted and dried out. Fried pot stickers were steamed. 

Drinks were so slow. I had two cokes. I was by myself. And it took 15+ minutes for my first one. I already had eaten most of my salad before it came. 

Very minimal offerings. Pasta bar (dry dry dry). What I assume was supposed to be Asian bar. Had lemon chicken, spring roll, dry noodle, etc. Prime rib was tough. 

Just not impressed. Small and dinky. Blah service. Dry food. I went on Friday August 22, 2014.",zPgciDoAeJXmgeDLDGpRxg,2,0,2,AkcwuwF-uAMUprC1AwGZJQ

5482273,2017-07-11,1,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Not good at all or how I remember it from last year. We got to Bellini Brunch with a little less than 2 hours before it ended. There was a long line to pay as well as to get seated. There was a sign that said all guests were limited to 90 minutes because they were so busy. Thankfully it didn't take too long to get seated. As for the food, it was mostly yuck. The bad- The top round wasn't tender. All of us who had it could not cut through it or chew it. The clams weren't fresh and smelled like dirty ocean water. Mussels smelled as well. Carved turkey was dry. Fried shrimp tasted stale. The desserts were horrendous. The cupcakes were dry and crumbly. While the lemon curd cake was moist, it barely had any flavor. The coconut cake didn't taste like coconut but instead the frosting and filling tasted like vegetable shortening or margarine. I hate wasting food, but I spit out a lot of it!!!! The good- their pizza actually tastes delicious. The mashed potatoes were great. I love how they offer a ton of grilled veggies by the meat carving station. To make it worse we were there when they started changing out the Brunch items for dinner that started at 4pm. The people working were so aggressive in cleaning the place up. There were several times I'd be waiting patiently while they swept crumbs away and wiped down the counters in between serving trays. I got side eyed like I was intruding in their space. Or they would just jump in front of me like we were hassling them. I get it, Vegas is damn hot and can make both servers and customers miserable, but still! Made me want to leave, what horrible service! I wasn't trying to jack from the dinner menu, I was just trying to enjoy the 90 minutes at the buffet that I paid for. While this place is relatively cheap, $19.99 regular price, $17.99 with Silverton Rewards card, it has not lived up to what we experienced last time.",Y6Ax3JHhwPasZLSjTaQLqg,0,0,1,9LqPC9gmiGU1Zf3H7Epydw

5546223,2018-02-20,3,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"We have gone to the Season's Buffet at the Silverton many times simply because it was closest to where we were staying at the Oasis RV Resort. We get in and have dinner on Friday. Some nights are more than 3 stars but overall it rounds down. 

They dinner on Friday is called the Harvest Buffet (?) for  $22.99 regular price and $19.99 with the casino rewards card. It's not a bad deal considering you get all you want to drink (milk, soda, coffee, tea), appetizer, soup or salad, entrees and dessert. The thing I like about a buffet is that I can try many things but the bad thing is the quality isn't high. You might find some things you really like but most is just ok. 

Harvest buffet means fresh food from whatever season it is (I'm told) with different stations of Soups and Salads, Seafood Station, Carving Station and American, Italian Stations. It was regular food-nothing I could say was seasonal and the Dessert Station seems the same as always-pies, cakes, etc. 

We tried the Polynesian Buffet once but it was right when they first starts it (way back) and I wasn't happy they replaced something we liked. So I don't think I gave it a fair shake-though my husband loved the pork. We will try it again after reading the reviews. I'm not sure why it's more expensive  but it's $23.99 regular price and $21.99 with the rewards card. 

Sunday from 10am - 3pm they have a Bellini Brunch which is a nice treat for breakfast out. They have the regular breakfast foods with some that are a bit more special. Just the Bellini cocktails make the meal. It was 
$19.99 regular price and $17.99 with the rewards card.

Seafood Night is Thursday (which is odd since I always expect it on a Friday).  It seemed high for what we got at 
$32.99 regular price and $30.99 with the rewards card. The seafood was pretty generic and nothing special for a Las Vegas buffet. 

We have gone on Mondays for the 50+ Buffet Day since we are over 50 and get 50% off a Buffet all day. The small print is is not just for your age. You must have Gold, Platinum or Diamond Silverton Rewards Club card which means playing a lot. Then you have to get a printed coupon from their machine and show a valid photo ID. I don't play that much. My husband qualified for the Golf so he would get half off and mine would be full price. The meal was good for half off but not so great at full price. 

We were a bit disappointed with the buffet. Casinos used to bring you in by offering good buffers at a reasonable or cheap price. Now, the price on some nights is high enough so I expect more.  Considering you get a full meal, it's pretty good.",2z2A6ayPZmlVwZFK-uz60w,8,3,3,3UnFopT5Ix3gw45vrysaAg
5548977,2015-01-07,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Came here on Xmas Sunday on the way home to LA.  Came here around 1:30pm and there was barely a line.  Only fail is that there was only one cashier and she took forever.  At a normal buffet on the strip, it should have taken 2 minutes max to process customers.  When it was time for me to pay, the cashier asked if I had a players card.  I told her no and she said that it would save me $2 off per person and all I would need is 1 card for the entire party.  Seeing that there was 5 people in our party, it would have saved me $10.  I told her that I didn't want to go get the card as I didn't want to stand in another line.  But she insisted that I get the card.  So I obliged and picked up the card.  Anyways, there was a promo that day that if you play and get 50 points, you get a free buffet.  Too bad I didn't have time as the buffet closes at 2:30 I believe.  
The Sunday brunch was a Bellini themed brunch which also served Mimosas champagne & beer all for $18 per person with the players card.  For those of you looking at the whole pig, that's only on Saturdays during the Polynesian themed dinner.  
The decor inside is very nice and looked high end.  The food area was clean for the most part, but small.  It's your typical buffet and nothing about it will really wow you.  Some of the food was pretty tasty but for the most part, it's pretty decent.  I really liked the eggs benedict.  It was served in what looks like a cupcake paper liner.  I thought it was a good idea since you don't end up breaking the egg yolk while trying to pick it up like other buffet places where they just put like 12 eggs benedict next to each other and you have to pick it up the right way without the sauce, yolk or ham falling off.  I thought it was one of the better eggs benedict I've had.  The sauce has a touch of lemon tartness and the ham wasn't dry.  The english muffin wasn't hard as a rock either.  
The prime rib was overcooked and on the tough side even though it was on the medium side.  
The steamed clams was a bit salty but it was flavorful.  I almost forgot, the Posole was probably the best I've had.  It had just the right flavor combination.  Was not bland like a lot of places I've been to here in LA.  There was big chunks of meat and it was tender and not dry at all.  
Like most buffets, there were different stations ranging from Chinese to Mexican to American.  Overall I would liked this place as it's not crowded and won't burn a hole in your pockets.  I would like to try their Polynesian nights but I've heard that it can really get crowded.  So come early if you plan on eating here on Saturday.",WpCqwLoXyRL8Yx0NbPzxDw,0,0,4,WJxtq3DKJiing5FAfucfFA

Sign up for a card at the player's club and the day of the BOGO print out a coupon at the kiosk and head to the buffet. The coupon is only good for that day.

Also the same day you sign up for the player's card, play table games and earn just 50 points and you get another coupon for a free buffet to use anytime you want.

The buffet is pretty good for $9.99, then factor in the BOGO it's only $5/person. Can't beat that deal, as you can't even get full of of $5 at a fast food place.  There's Mexican food (fish tacos, menudo, pozole, or albondigas soup, ground beef tacos), carving station (roast beef, chicken or turkey, and even their skin fried, ham, grilled veggies), Italian (pizza, pasta), Asian (Pad thai or chow mein, beef and broccoli, egg rolls, Asian soups, string beans), and salad bar.

We have visited during Polynesian Night and I have to say the roast pig was damn good eating.   The seats are comfy, the servers are nice and the buffet is clean.  

The only drawback to our last visit was an incident with one of the buffet custodians.   The guy behind the buffet grabbed a can of something and sprayed it on a mess at the Chinese food station.  The spray also landed on the white rice and along the rim of the white rice.   It sort of freaked me out because my assumption was that it was a cleaning agent.  After inquiring, they showed me it was a food safe generic non-stick spray coating (Pam) and that it was harmless.   I still stayed away from the white rice because who wants Pam flavored rice?   They need to find a less intrusive way of cleaning.  

Maybe I am over reacting to having food safe non-stick spray coating my food but it just turned me off.  Yet another reason I don't like buffets!",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,2,1,3,yhOoLC0VhQH0M926qAbPKw

I think I liked it even more since it's a seafood buffet, and I love seafood! They had a fair amount of choices available, from shrimp ceviche to pad thai. They also had meat options, which was pretty cool. One of my favorite things to eat was their king crab legs -- they give you these neat little tools to open the crab legs, and man, there was a lot of meat inside! The cocktail shrimp was good as well. If you're a bread-lover, they've got some great raspberry bread! Surprisingly tasty!

As for dessert, I'll admit their selection wasn't great, but it wasn't totally lacking. They had some good ice cream that wasn't too frozen nor too melted, which is how I like it. They also offered waffle cones for the ice cream! Bonus points!

One of the things I was impressed with at the buffet was their service. Our waiter was constantly available and always refilled our drinks -- even without us asking! At one point I gave my sister some of my iced tea (I poured it into her empty glass) and he even refilled that drink with iced tea even though she hadn't ordered iced tea to begin with!

Overall, I'd come here again -- I had a decent experience and pretty good food. Left without having a heavy feeling in my stomach and a food coma, yet I was extremely satisfied. If you want to stop at a buffet and have a seafood craving, this isn't a bad place to chow down!

By the way, the decoration is quite nice and the place is very clean and spacious!",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,2,2,4,-SgALZ6Njybl7ivpgul6qA

It is spacious and looks amazing.  The food was also very good.  We received a buy one get one half off from another person in line which decreased our bill significantly.  I enjoyed the Italian and Chinese food the best.  My six year old son enjoyed the ice cream.",cnnIe3mbtGqgVIsRMbLgTQ,6,7,4,w7BHuXtyjPjyUZKmFf6C1g
5688668,2010-08-15,0,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Note: This review is for the Polynesian buffet that the Silverton has on Thursdays, though I'm not sure much changes from the regular buffet. 

I usually wouldn't go the Silverton buffet since we have so many other good places I'd like to eat but someone wanted to go so I decided sure why not? Have to try somethings at least once.

The decor: Not bad, it was actually pretty good, not completely amazing but not so cheesy and tacky that you're reminded that you're at a buffet and feel like a tourist. But pretty much what you'r expect from a buffet, one thing I didn't like is that the bathrooms are outside and in the casino, not that big of a deal for some but kind of bothers me.

The service: Excellent. Very attentive. Everyone was nice, conversational, relaxed and everyone just seemed real kick back.

The food: The primary purpose of going to a buffet. Can't say I was impressed by anything they had to offer. It wasn't the worst buffet I have ever had but all the food just seemed to be real basic. There was your Italian section - eh, you're Asian section - yawn, salad bar, small dessert area and a couple more areas that weren't very memorable. If you were hungry, it would've done the trick but my biggest problem was where was the Polynesian food? It seemed like their regular buffet with maybe 4 or 5 Polynesian dishes. They had some pig, mahi mahi, and pig/pork in banana leaves and that's about it, not a lot of variety and if I'm craving some Poly food again I can't say I'd rush back here.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,1,0,2,TW1meU9u21St4OQSbYIfyw
5698816,2015-12-28,1,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"I suggest you go during Saturdays when it is Polynesian night. Unlimited lechon(roasted pork) and poke! It was heaven! They have a ton of dessert choices (pie, cheesecake, ice cream, etc). The line outside was super long and it took us 45 mins to get a seat. I think they need more cashiers up front to hurry up the line. In general, really enjoyed the place. I also liked the steak and the different kinds of seafood. If you have the club card, you can get a free buffet meal when you earn 50 points on the first day, which was a great deal. I wish they had more fruit options and faster seating.",T8bE7HApV3z_o4fMmhTxtg,0,0,5,1no6KUj5pmW_hhL9B2kjOw

The pizza looked like it has been sitting out.  Got some chow fun from the asian offerings.  It was cold.  Tried some of their sushi.  It was terrible.  Sadly the best thing I had was the mashed potatoes.  Those were hot and fresh.  When we were leaving the buffet my husband got immediately sick.

The food selection was I thought very limited. 
The Asian area had noodles and fried rice. Lemon chicken which was very dry and over cooked. There was 3 soups. The egg drop was Luke warm. Didn't finish my bowl. The crab wonton were so over done. I took 4 and only ate one. This is usually one of my favorite. 
Moved over to try the Italian area. Tried the stuffed manicotti which I thought was good. I should have put more sauce over them  a bit that was my bad. The clam chowder was very good.  They had fried catfish nuggets and planks. They were good.   
I had a slice of pizza and it was really tasty.  The desert table was delicious. I ate 3 different cup cakes. They were moist and delicious. 
I really wanted to try this place,which I am glad I did , but I don't think I would go back or recommend this place. There are several other restaurants located there and you may save a little bit of money and get better food.",m-OM7OAZZzFrhZm3_oWisQ,0,0,3,bFuksMCg6rUNjdILRdB6NA

5778776,2013-08-08,1,h_g5HV6Fw2rinZ3xqFwygw,"Guess I forgot that I already thought this place sucked 2yrs ago. My friend had a $25 dining credit, so it ended up costing about $5 for 2ppl. With that in mind, yes it was totally worth it. Actually even for the $14 full price it was an ok deal since it includes soft drinks, dinner and dessert. 

I cant think of even one thing that stood out as good - everything we tried was pretty mediocre, bordering on bad. Even the ice cream doesn't look like real ice cream anymore - they seem to have switched to dairy dessert stuff. For people that work in casinos - it's about the same quality level as employee dining (that isn't a good thing)

You're better off paying twice the amount for a better quality buffet on the strip. For reference, the Main Street buffet is much better than this.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,3,1,2,GNS9AHV4Xic-VDZnU-DApA

Dad also had a 50% off coupon so ... score! Overall food is better than wedding banquet catering and the Steak was surprisingly great. Some dishes were a bit more on the salty side which I didn't mind, at least it was better than the blander dishes on their seasonal menu. But the most surprising dish of all was the sausage stuffing. It was actually super tasty and just the right thing I wanted for the holidays. Everything else was okay, and slightly above average. At its price, I think it offers great value for what you're paying.

So I know what your thinking 5 stars really?? But I'm here to tell you they are indeed worth the 5 stars I gave them.. Listen people if you want the Balligo then GO THERE.. But you if want something reasonable and actually good then come here..
We went during lunch and luckily got in right before it bacame packed and yes it was buy one get one half off or free.. 
Trust me it was a great time all the food was seasoned good and there was something for everyone and trust me I'm kind of a picky eater some would say, but I loved the choices they had ..
The staff was friendly and so was the manger that was there making sure everyone was seated and that the food was hot and ready.. And she spoke to everyone ..
I get some of you have a bad time time at this place and I'm sorry about that but for I can say from my visit there I had a great time, service was good and the food was great.. I will def. will come back again maybe next time for Dinner..

We have absolutely no complaints about the food. And I wish I could rate 4.5 stars instead of 4. The only critique I have is that they make it kind of hard to locate spoons (for soup, ice cream, etc.). And also, our waitress didn't come around as much as we would've liked for drink refills.

On this occasion I had friends in from out of town who were in desperate need of AYCE food. I suggested Seasons and off we went. We got in line (which was scarily long) and started to wait. We heard rumblings of a free buffet offer and took turns to go to the Rewards Club  booth to sign up. My fella and I already had cards, but we got free buffets and $5 in slot play for signing up newbies, score!

It took us an hour and a half to get through the line and everyone was getting pretty antsy in line. My friends had a show to get to, so each passing minute was making them nervous about leaving on time. We finally got seated and off they went to scrounge around for a plate of food before they had to run off. The food is always pretty solid for buffet food but I had to deduct a star for slow service and the long line. They did deal with it the best they could as the servers and the rest of the staff were obviously overwhelmed with large amount of people filtering in and out because of the promotion. They definitely need to account for this and staff more people on the weekends.

All in all, a solid buffet that I usually suggest to friends and family when they're looking for good food on the cheap. Bets of all, they have chocolate covered strawberries. I know, the simple pleasures.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,2,2,3,E93_XJRw3BlJ1LqHRyVGOQ
