Jose is our go-to server and is INCREDIBLE. Super attentive and kind. My boyfriends dad is celiac and he goes above and beyond to accommodate him. We only go on days he's there. If you're thinking of dining here ask for him.

189411,2015-02-15,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"Just because I was silly enough to try and order a healthy option, does not mean that I wanted kid meal sized portions. 

I ordered the salmon with asparagus.They started out with a small salad. Nothing special, but at this point things seemed reasonable. Then I get a plate consisting of a small piece of salmon, three sprigs of asparagus, and something wrapped in a cloth which looked like a pastry. After finishing the salmon and asparagus I open the pastry to find that it was actually a lemon. Wish I knew that before I ate the salmon. Not feeling like giving them more money I then proceeded to eat a bunch of their bread, since this was all white bread this completely undid my plans of trying to get a healthy meal. 

As this was a $35 option I figured it should at least give me a reasonable amount of food. My expectation was wrong, I easily could have finished two of those meals. The $8 bowl I got for lunch at Chipotle was more filling, more healthy and a whole lot less disappointing. 

With the possible exception of the bread, none of the food I got was actually bad. if I went into the place planning to spend $60 a person maybe I wouldn't have had such a bad experience. Although nothing I got seemed so exciting that I would willingly part with $60. 

The only positive thing was that the casino gave us a coupon for a free bottle of wine. For free wine it was actually pretty good.",dlqDwVh6rWMCQTCHVKtNPQ,0,0,2,-G6HWTfE4iN09VpAdI7XcQ

556379,2012-08-12,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"On Saturday, August 11, 2012, six of us had dinner at the Silverado Steakhouse. My dad's prime rib was tough had to be sent back. Unfortunately, the waiter didn't check in on us until the end of our meal. When my dad had him take the prime rib he then asked, ""Would you like a pork chop""? The table went silent. Sure, my dad went to a steakhouse to have a baked potato for dinner and a pork chop for dessert. 
   I ordered the salmon. When asked if I wanted pressed or baked potato I chose the pressed potato. My order came without potatoes. Upon questioning the waiter he said my salmon didn't come with potatoes. I wish it hadn't come with salmon. You'll understand soon.
   When the bill came my dad's prime rib dinner was still on it and had to be sent back for correction. Maybe it was the waiter's first day?
   My salmon was extremely tender, bordering mushy, but had a good sauce and flavor so I ate it. A hour or two later I didn't feel right. It wasn't long before the food poisoning symptoms kicked in. Oh my, what a couple hours. I'll leave it to your imagination. By early morning I was fine and, without a desire to contact the Silverado for fear I might get a free salmon dinner coupon, I chose to write a review. 
      I should say that the other four diners enjoyed their meals with no side effects. If you're in Vegas, and in the gambling mood, you have a 66.66% chance of getting a good meal here.",47vYPkNkUAUy5tIHUG2JgA,1,0,1,do4FvQlFtXVSVVrHmysTSg

818474,2014-10-27,1,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"The bone in ribeye special was fantastic - especially for the price that included a salad and potato. Most high end steakhouses would have charged that price for the steak alone.   The wait staff and service was great - once we finally got in. 

And that's why I only gave the place 2 stars. Honestly, the steak and wait staff deserved 5 stars, but the maitre d's will go out of their way to be assholes.   Been here 3 times, and every single time I'm told there is a 45 min to 3 hour wait for a reservation and told I HAVE to make a reservation - even when the restaurant is empty at 5pm on a Sunday or Monday night.  

Empty when we walked in. Half empty when we returned for our mandatory ""reservation.""  Still half empty by the time we left. Why did we need a reservation?

Plenty of waitstaff to cover the tables. Plenty of support staff to refill drinks and clear dishes after each course. So the only reason I can see for the forced wait time is to add an air of ""high end"" exclusivity, but guess what?  MUCH better steakhouses like Del Frisco's or The Palm can accommodate walk ins with no wait during off peak times, and within 10-15 minutes during peak hours, so I have to assume the maitre d' is either trying to force us to kill time in the casino, just being a dick, or the place is horribly managed. 

Even through the food is great, it isn't worth a 3 hour wait, especially when there are options right down the road at the Silverton, the M, or Green Valley Ranch.

We started with the crab cake appetizer. PLENTY of crab a good crab-to-filler ratio and the sauce was tasty. Next up was the house salad with their house dressing which was wonderful! For my meal I had the seafood special. That particular day it was Sea Bass with Scallops - WONDERFUL! Moist and flavorful fish, perfectly cooked scallops. There was a potato side and vegetables. They were just average on the creativity/unique scale, but they tasted just fine. Typical steakhouse sides.

I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I felt the meal was very good, but there wasn't anything super amazing that would really pull me back in over some of the other great Vegas steakhouses.

1011763,2014-03-10,2,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"Finding a great steak is something of a jihad for me.  I will invade small nations to find the right steak.  But sometimes, scouting missions just don't end well.

Silverado Steakhouse is located in the South Point Resort and Casino, about 8 miles South of the Las Vegas strip.  It's not worth the drive from the strip to get the food, and if you happen to be a guest at the South Point and happen to be a steak fan, be prepared to add $30 to the cost of your evening for the taxi ride to areas with better steak dinners.  Resorts like to hold their guests and their money hostage, and the South Point is no exception.

The service is good but not great; the ambiance is old style Western steakhouse, with leather-lined seating and paintings of Western scenes on the walls.  Because the hotel guests are virtual captives due to the distance from other offerings, reservations would be highly advisable, lest you find yourself waiting hours for these guests to finish mediocre steak at inflated prices.  The wait staff is attentive without being intrusive, although the poor English of one server left my dinner companion a sparkling water drink without ice until a request was repeated.  

I had high hopes for great steak after getting a very good Caesar salad.  My companion had her house salad tossed in a bowl, tableside.  However, once our food arrived, these high hopes were dashed.  While my bone-in rib eye was properly cooked, it was flavorless, surprisingly tough, and a large piece of gristle apparently made of bulletproof kevlar ran through the middle of my steak.  The presentation and portion size was excellent, but ultimately, the steak was a bland, tough disappointment, made more disappointing by the high-end price of the steak.  Really, this is a $25 steak, not a $43 one.  I've had better steaks for less money.

Likewise, my companion's Ahi tuna was a disappointment.  It was over-blackened and dry.  Looking at it from across the table, I thought she had gotten a piece of coal, not blackened fish.

Ultimately, high prices are what does this steak place in.  The food is okay, but not great.  The prices say the food should be much better than it really is.  Since Las Vegas is something of a steak mecca, visit another steak mosque and don't make the pilgrimage to Silverado.  And if you find yourself trapped at the Silverado, just remember that the hotel has a shuttle (with a lousy schedule) and taxi, allowing you to escape to a better steak place.",OAKvz_-efZUljMdfK5MurQ,2,1,2,IOz5MBHpe-vwBZZZ16UrFg

I personally am not a fan of casino dining, but boy was I surprised. 
From the moment we were greeted, to the end of our evening, we enjoyed one of the best dining experiences since moving here.
The ambience, (we sat in a back corner booth) was the cool, old style steakhouse feel! The staff was professional, attentive and very warm and the Prime Rib was the bomb!!!

Ironically, the first time I had their rib eye at medium well, the flavors that came out of the beef were delicious. It was aged beef, and to this day my mouth still waters at the perfect sear of the beef, the perfect seasoning, and the rich fat perfectly marbled into the meat. I should have definitely ordered the steak medium. Which is why I came back a second time to order it medium. 

My father and I came back once again to have this amazing steak, even when my mom and sister were tired of eating so much meat. I think it was late at night that my father and I craved Silverado, so down we went to grab a late night steak dinner. I ordered a rib eye once again, having it cooked medium. The steak was cooked perfectly, but the disappointing factor the second time around was the fact that there was an over-usage of butter over the meat. The buttery flavor was much too strong this time around, and it overpowered the seasoning and the natural taste of aged beef. Nevertheless, it wasn't bad. This is why I'm not giving Silverado a full five stars. Consistency is very important to me.

As a side note, these guys serve huge complimentary salad starters. Be careful with the salad. They could make you full before you even start on the steak.",Gzk_hBOnjDjB43d-hNvliQ,0,1,4,eWLXQWtWG1UCQ5kRpHVgug

It was by far one of the best steaks that I have ever had.  Additionally, the server was amazing.  He did a great job at building rapport with his clients and making them really feel welcome in the restaurant.  The ONLY reason that I gave Silverado a 4 star instead of a 5 star is because of the ambience of the restaurant.  However, I do understand that it's inside of Southpoint hotel and Casino, so it probably has some restrictions.  When I am spending $100+ on a dinner for 2 not including drinks, I want to feel like I am in a very high-end restaurant.  The ambience was a 4, which is still great in my book.  

Overall a great experience and I am happy to continue to eat there.  Recommend the bone-in rib eye. It's fantastic!",E4QZhCxsWHiZPkUikDXgAw,0,0,4,5btZgxKgZKxjZga6o1A1gg
1698010,2017-04-22,2,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"I was invited to join some friends for Easter dinner.  I hadn't dined here yet so I was looking forward to it.  

We arrived on time for our reservation.   We were seated immediately which is where the welcoming service began.  Kelly was quite attentive and friendly during our meal.  She provided wonderful and accommodating service.  

In the beginning a variety of plentiful bread was placed at the table.  The bread is warm and served with lovely decorative butters.  Instead of ordering their 4 course Easter menu, I chose a few regular menu items. I started with the wedge salad.  Delicious! The scrumptious salad is covered with blue cheese, onion, tomato and lots of bacon.  You can't go wrong with bacon.  

For my entree I ordered the lump crab cakes.  The salad pretty much filled me up so I was glad to have the appetizer for my main course.  The crab cakes are served with a sweet red pepper sauce.  It was really a beautiful presentation.  Now the sauce was just ok and didn't really compliment the crab cakes.   Eating them just as they were appeased me.  The abundance of meat and combined herbs made my taste buds happy.

My partner had the house salad, tossed tableside, and declared it very good.  I had the lobster bisque, which was quite the best I've ever tasted.  We both ordered the filet with baked potato, both of which were served hot and perfectly prepared.  A scoop of delicious ice cream, served in a martini glass, ended the meal.

However, this time everyone's a winner! I've been here a couple times and I must say their steak here is definitely worth the trip..

My dinner starts with their house salad that consists of heart of palms that I would say is the key element that makes thesalads texture unique to most and taste much better than the ordinary. I'm not a big salad fan but I love the salad here. 

As usual, I order the Rib-Eye char-broiled, cooked medium-medium well and a side of bearnaise sauce (doesn't need it, I just like switching up the flavor occasionally). The steak  sweats rich flavor and is cooked exactly as I please with just a hint of pink through out. Slicing through it is like butter and after my first bite its silence.. Its flavor rivals the best of them! I was really skeptical of this place because I usually check other 'foodies' reviews/comments or recommendations before trying a steak house for the first time. Well like I said in the beginning, everybodys a winner!

Honorable mention: I have also tried their Chilean Sea Bass (occasionally available) and it was wonderful not to mention quite large.

The salad with house dressing (tossed in front of you) was quite good. I knew the rib eye would be pretty large so I refrained from finishing the salad. The bread is good too.

This is a tough one. I genuinely want to give this place a higher rating. But I can't. 
One: yelp has as five star rating which ignores the halves...
Two: it's not over til it's over

Let me start by saying that the energy in the restaurant is elegant. It has the feel of a classic, high-end steakhouse. But the beauty of the company is that they recognize that money is money. They don't demand you come in wearing a three-piece suit and tie. If you so desire, shorts are acceptable. And while that may not be the 'proper' thing, Fuck that! I'm hungry, wears the table. Gold star.
I was greeted warmly by the host, who was in a nice suit. Spiffy tie too.
Sat at a nice booth and then introduced to Chaker, my second-hand man. He offered the standard cocktails, bread and butter but as I already had a glass of wine, I declined...no hassle. 
Then Keith came over. Nice man. Been with the company since inception, ten years ago; and a proud member of the staff, ""wouldn't work anywhere else"" he said. 
I ordered a small Caesar salad to start, to be followed by a blackened 16oz rid-eye and lobster tail (addition charge of course) And for the side, asparagus, cause even death needs a green fence. 
The Caesar: good clean fresh lettuce, almost no ends, just good rich green romaine. Long thick parmesan strands and croutons. (when the fuck is someone gonna realize that croutons make no sense in large blocks...break those things up and let the crumbs decorate the lettuce so that when I spear my greens, I get the taste of a crouton without the annoying trouble of trying to scoop up the bread along with it) All things considered, it was one of the most complete Caesars I've ever had. The dressing was evenly coated and the lettuce in nice manageable bites. Every bite had all the elements. Fucking croutons...
*on a special side note, while delivering the salad, Keith accidentally knocked over my wine, but he didn't miss a beat, he asked me what I had and then immediately disappeared and reappeared with a full glass of Merlot, I should have asked the name because it was a hearty well balanced blend that paired well with the entree. 
The business: I should have taken a picture at the beginning and the end. This fucking steak was a cowboys wet dream. Perfectly tender. Perfectly juicy. I even chewed the bone. That being said one of my hesitations in the fifth star begins here. I asked for the steak to have ""a line of pink"". My steak was pink almost all the way through. Having said that...I was wrong. The chef was right. But sitting there, I couldn't help but think, 'that's not what I asked for'. And while I may have been wrong, doesn't he owe me the opportunity to learn from my mistake??? I couldn't answer it...although, sitting here now, if I saw someone roll in and order the steak, then turn and call for ketchup...I would have stood up, walked over and punched him in the face. That's how good this steak was. 
As for the lobster, wooooo doggy! The most well chosen, well cooked lobster. It was a steak crustacean. And while I did try the butter with it...it only took away from the complete flavor of the meat. Check that. I did use the juices from the steak. There were just enough on the plate to keep all the proteins wet and flavorful. 
Asparagus. What do you say about these things. They were perfectly cooked. End to end soft but tender chew. No salt needed. Though, they did hold the butter nicely. 
Now, up until here, I was thinking to myself, five stars. Well, four and a half. But then I ordered cappuccino and the X-rated sunrise. 
The cap came out first. What genius decided that all coffee products should be served at boiling temperatures? I still can't taste the middle of my tongue. Which I'm sure fucks with my ability to properly rate the sunrise. Having said that, a libation is supposed to have alcohol in it. Big cup. Lots of liquid...mostly juice. If I wanted a $9 orange juice I would have asked them to squeeze the oranges at the table. I'm not saying you have to poison the drink, but if there is tequila in the bowl, I want to taste it. 

In closing, let me say that even now, it kind of hurts to list only four stars, because I say to you, 'if you can find a better steak in town' call me out, so far I haven't had it. (and I say that having sampled much of the strip) 
But here's the rub. This meal cost $126, top to bottom, including tip. I once had the same steak and lobster combo at the Stardust casino for $12.99 not including tax. And to be totally fair, that steak and that lobster were, without question, just as D elicious. You do the math. 

with love,
my compliments to the staff and the chef,

My mom got a comp here from South Pointe so we decided to check it out. They allowed us to get 2 full course meals with dessert included. I ordered the filet mignon. I always order medium rare for my steaks but I should have gone with medium for this cut since it's a lot thicker than other cuts. The steak came out pretty bloody so I was a little skeptical on finishing it. I mean, it was good.. just a little under cooked to be called perfect for me. It was also very chewey and hard to swallow larger pieces. If I ever come here again, I will definitely order  medium.

Service! They were great. I wish I could rate my review at 5 stars but it was hard with my under cooked steak. Our server was super nice. He introduced himself and we had little conversations here and there. 

They wheel all of our food out on carts. The presentation was very pretty too. For the price, I'm not sure if I'd come here any time soon. Everything was decently priced for a steakhouse but as I college student, I would not come here on a regular basis.

The steaks came with a Siverado salad that was tossed table side. The house dressing was delicious.

It was swimming in salty gravy with what I am pretty sure was boxed mashed potatoes (and again with lots of salt). Jonny ordered the filet mingon. He asked for medium rare, but it was meant to be rare. I say meant to be because it was all pink inside, but no blood! It was bone dry and again very SALTY! We then ordered the cheesecake. Jonny asked if the deserts were pre-made.. The waiter responded kind of shocked that we would even ask that. The cheesecake was most definitely pre-made.  The plating was beautiful, but the cheesecake was hard and extremely cold! The garnishes of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries were not fresh. The stick of mint chocolate was delicious, however. Jonny called a manager over to tell him about our experience. The manager seemed unfazed and comped one of meal items without us even asking, and the bill was still over $75 without alcohol.. Which leads me to believe the manager is used to these complaints. The food was terrible. The service, however, was better than most places. The servers were very friendly and personable.",nxFp2lqU4FhZX8PCAB8nbg,1,0,1,O8qciA94Tb1GejkQuKpngA

I've been going to Silverado Steakhouse for several years now and always find it a great experience.  Generally, I like all of the restaurants at the South Pointe from Primarily Prime Rib to Michaels (the best, but really, not the most accessible because of the price point).  As to Silverado Steakhouse, the prime rib is definitely superior to Primarily Prime Rib, although it is a good deal.  If the price bothers you, the Cafe has a prime rib as well, but it isn't as good.  

I generally order the Bone in Rib Eye when I eat at the Silverado, but I have also tasted the lamb, pork chop, and, when they have it, the Chilean Sea Bass (which is dynamite).  Overall, for the price point, this is an excellent restaurant with great service and great tasting food.  I am not going to claim it is the best steak I've ever tasted (Michael's Top Sirloin, Gordon Ramsey's Steak's Rib Eye Cap, the Bone in Rib Eye from Old Homestead - just to name some other Vegas places), but it is great given the price point and accompaniments that come with the meal (salad and potato).  

Finally, the service has always been great here.  While not at the level of Michael's, the staff are always polite and courteous without any pressure to upsell alcohol or menu items.  The service style is similar to Primarily Prime Rib with a busser and a waiter, so you can usually get your drink order in immediately and enjoy the bread while you look over the menu.  

I'll happily come again and again to this Steakhouse, especially on Mother's Day / Father's Day / Special Occasion when they offer a pre fixe four course meal with wine.  I would recommend making a reservation in advance, but you can likely just walk in if you're willing to wait.",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,2,1,5,YFZ6mYXNQCIjb_e9HZm8Vg

Even after we sent it back and got a new one, it was still overcooked! We never got the salad that was supposed to come with the dinner, until after dinner was over and the bill arrived. We were never even offered the salad, or asked what kind of dressing we would like! I happened to notice. when the bill arrived, that a salad was supposed to have been included! It is for these reasons that I say that Jose was a terrible waiter. He did not take good care of us at all...hence the $10.00 tip. His tip would have better had he taken better care of us. He was also not particularly personable. Our busser was nice, and the manager, Gary, offered to take care of our meal the next time we dine there. Hopefully we will be able to give a better review next time!  We have been here several times in the past, without incident...and enjoyed our experience.

3167794,2014-08-03,2,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"About a month ago, we went to the Spazmatic's at South Point and ended up winning a $100 certificate to the Silverado Steakhouse. Being that the wifey is a steak fanatic, she was pretty excited, but for whatever reason, it ended up taking us until the very last day that the certificate was good to come here. Oops. 

The Silverado Steakhouse is also located in the South Point and sits right next door to Don Vito's. Since this is in a casino, you may way to make reservations, which we did and ended up getting sat in a nice, comfy booth off in the back. The restaurant itself is pretty good size, it's dimly lit and definitely has a fine dining feel to it.

Even though it is a steakhouse, there's a lot more on the menu then just steaks. In fact, there's only 4 cuts on the menu and a filet trio in the entrees section. There's a quite a few seafood options and although each meal is served with a salad and your choice of potato, the rest of the sides are a la carte and priced at $7 each. For the kiddos, they offer a chicken fingers plate for $13.95, which isn't on the menu. Plan to spend at least $30 a person though. With drinks and a dessert, our bill came out to just over $100 for 2 adults and a child.

Now don't get me wrong, I love a good steak...but I'm not a huge steak eater and usually have to be in the mood to order one. Thankfully, I was feeling one that night and ended up going with the 8oz filet and chose it ""Oscar Style"" which includes a king crab leg and asparagus topped with béarnaise sauce. For the price ($45 total), I wasn't wildly impressed. The steak was cooked unevenly and although it was an extremely juicy, tender steak, there was little flavor. Even just a touch of salt and pepper would have probably made a world of difference. The crab was decent and I liked that it comes pre-shelled but they drenched it in the béarnaise sauce. Everything else on the plate was just ok. The asparagus were undercooked and the mashed potatoes were pretty bland. We also shared a peach cobbler which was only $7, but was lacking in flavor and came out cold inside it's little cast-iron skillet. 

If it weren't for the service, this would probably be a 2 star review. The service was pretty much perfect and exactly what you'd expect for a place like this. Our drinks stayed full the entire night, the whole staff was extremely friendly and our waiter was great. All in all, I'm glad we got the change to eat here, but I'm sure we won't be back anytime soon.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,5,4,3,7_raXneQKztlds1uKJ9cKA

Even though I always stay at SouthPoint, I'd never eaten here because the prices seemed high compared to all the other food options in Las Vegas. But my friend wanted an evening of fine dining without having to drive anywhere.

The dining room is very old school with large circular booths and dim lighting. I started with the Lobster Bisque ($8) and must say it was the best I have ever had! It was rich and flavorful with many chunks of lobster meat. Our salads were prepared by our waiter, who rolled out a trolley cart and dressed them tableside - a very nice touch. 

My entree was a Braised Beef Short Rib ($28) with mashed potatoes in a rich demi-glas gravy. The only way to describe the rib is ""Flintstone-ian"". But the meat was tender and delicious as were the potatoes and gravy. My friend had the special of the evening, Halibut with Scallops ($40) in a white wine butter sauce accompanied by mashed potatoes. Her piece of fish was huge and came with three large scallops. 

Service was attentive, but our waiter didn't hover. This was definitely one of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas and well worth the price. Can't wait to go back on my next trip!",B9B0MkFmQNCfXjdiXndqxg,1,0,5,PiVPsQfJn5b3WUvTDRQacw
3189894,2011-02-23,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"Sure the decor is a little cheesy but for the price and quality of the food you get, I will happily look past it. The first time we came here I set my expectations to low to medium, based on it's location and price point. After a lovely first meal, however, we decided to again visit this establishment on our recent trip and I am so glad we did. 
Once again I will bring up the price point, but only to illustrate the value of what you get. A large Cajun Ribeye with a side baked potato and a very generous sized salad will set you back only $34.00. This is about a third of what my boyfriend and I normally pay for a good steak dinner. The blue cheese salad is great, and I love the hearts of palm and artichokes that they generously add to the mix. The Ribeye is very large and tender and I love their blackening seasoning. Not quite on par with Morton's steak quality but a close runner up. A loaded baked potato? What's not to love? Oh and to you bread lovers, they hook it up! Pretzel bread buns, brioche style buns, and a great crusty raisin and nut artisan style bread. Yummy!

Basket of assorted breads and salad to start.  As stated in previous posts, salad is hand tossed in front of you with chosen dressing.  Picture did not come out well, so not in here, but I really liked it.

I had looked at the steakhouse menu when I was in the casino before and I decided it was time to try it.  I tried to make reservations through OpenTable with no success.  It said there was nothing available for 2 1/2 hours.  I tried through their website and got the same message.  I called and got my reservation immediately. I recommend you call to make a reservation.

I was seated promptly in the back of the restaurant where it opens up and is a bit wider.  The walls are lined with booths and it was at one of these booths where I was seated.  I was asked about water almost immediately on seating and I ordered an iced tea which came quickly.  I took some time studying the menu.  I opted for the 16 ounce, bone in rib eye steak pan seared with cajun spices.  I asked for it blue but i realized pan searing the spices might take it further than I normally like my steaks but it was fairly rare.  The taste of any cajun spice, however, was absent.  I was surprised how much I liked mixing the BBQ and plum sauces with a piece of steak.  BBQ is definitely not me but it tasted quite good that way.

With you meal, you have a choice of baked or mashed potatoes or you can get a vegetable instead.  I went for the baked potato all in.  The meal also includes a house salad which is mixed greens with a champagne vinaigrette dressing.

For dessert, I got the sticky toffee pudding and this was the only disappointment of the meal.  The pudding was swimming in crème Anglaise but it turned out that this was OK.  The cake was dry and it needed the crème to moisten the dry cake.

It turns out that their food is MUCH better than I had ever expected.

Nice atmosphere, dim lighting, high back deep upholstered booths, vintage photos, overall an upscale steakhouse feel.  They were able to sit 7 of us on Sunday night around 7:30 pm without much wait, which was great cuz i was one starving mofo as i arrived into LAS.  

The food was okay, for a casino steakhouse.  I started by splitting an escargot appetizer which included mushroom caps stuffed with the snail in garlic butter then baked in puff pastry.  Reminded me of being on a cruise ship b/c thats probably the only other place i've tried escargot.  it wasn't my choice but i enjoyed it.  The menu states they use ""prime"" grade on their beef, so i was anxiously pleased.  Tried their smallest cut prime rib @ 12 oz and it was alright.  Nice texture and flavor but mine was a little more done than the med-rare i ordered, but i didn't mind too much, b/c 1) i was hungry; and 2) my plate was under $20, so score on value.  They serve up a generous pour of red wine by the glass with a conservative selection with most being around $7-$10, so score on value again.

So this place is not quite a memorable steakhouse but it is also quite above a casino coffee shop.  i was fairly satisfied with what i got for what i paid.  if i wasn't brought here i probably would of never set foot here, but when traveling i just go with the flow and see where it takes me, and in Vegas it's usually better than not.",e-Bh0XDCOgYMaC-BmdxkAQ,2,1,3,NOUReoFRH416AI39YyuDbA

My husband and I have been dining here for at least 6 years, and we've enjoyed it every time, we'd never had a bad experience, until Saturday, December 30th.
We hadn't dined there for about 4 months, so we were really looking forward to our favorite place.  My husband made reservations requesting Roger in the special requests.  We do not ever dine there without Roger, b/c it's just not the same.  When we checked in at 5 p.m. we were surprised and let down to learn that Roger is no longer with them.  I feel that they should've informed us of that PRIOR to our arrival so that we made decide to go or not.  Suffice to say, we were disappointed, but we stayed b/c we were hungry and didn't feel we could find another place given the holiday weekend.
We've also ALWAYS ordered the crab cakes, and couldn't find them on the menu.  I asked our server, and she informed us that they were removed.  We were disappointed, again.  
The entree was good, not exceptional, just good. Service was good, but it wasn't Roger.  In fact, as we glanced around the restaurant, none of the servers looked familiar, it's like they have an all new staff.
Then came the desert.  It is definitely not as we recalled.  We ordered the warm apple crisp and the sticky toffee pudding, we've had both in the past, and remember it with vanilla ice cream, but not this time.  They were both swimming in this stuff, when we asked the staff they described it as a Crown Royal ice cream!?!?  I'm still confused.  
I'm sad to say that we won't be returning.  Change is good, but it is too much.  Too much good has gone.  You should remember that old adage, ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it.""  It wasn't broken.  It was beautiful.  It was our favorite.  We're locals, and out of all the beautiful restaurants in Las Vegas, we would always choose Silverado.

5279058,2017-06-29,2,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"Chosen for the first in a series of dinners to discuss food, mentorship and the future of Hospitality in Las Vegas, it was as a group of five including one local Mentee that a group of five was greeted by a pleasant hostess and led to a table towards the back of the room. The space which is decorated in hand painted murals and vintage photographs is elegant yet comfortable as patrons of all ages and demographics were seen smiling over plates of both innovative seasonal options and traditional Steakhouse fare.

Embracing the old way of doing things in terms of service, the Potatoes loaded and Salads tossed tableside, it was over the course of nearly two-and-a-half hours that Keith, a young mentee named Ben and three others shared stories and opinions about the current state of the industry and how Chef Norman got his start cooking in his Grandmother's kitchen. He and four of his brothers are all Chefs and Keith himself a Marine Corps veteran who came straight to Las Vegas and landed a spot at Bally's where ""Chef Warner - that old-time Chef who gave me my first shot, he took me through the paces from Graveyard to Swing shift to Days.""

Enjoying three styles of warm bread from Great Buns Bakery and a glass of house Wine with appetizers, the underage mentee abstaining and keeping a good distance from the glass throughout the night, it was over an amuse composed of both King and Blue Crab with only a bit of filler that stories about Keith's time opening The Mirage were remembered. ""A great 'wow' moment working with Mr. Wynn and Certified Master Chef Gustav Mauler"" was cited as an inspiration to do things the right way; the same way Silverado cooks their tender Mushrooms in Burgundy Wine with Garlic and composes the Caesar Salad topped in Dressing with a bold smack of Worcestershire Sauce and Anchovy Paste.

Making almost everything possible on-site for nearly ten years since moving from Suncoast to South Point, Chef Norman stating ""I'm not a mover and a shaker, if I'm with a good company I'm gonna stay."" It was while further discussing his time at the Mirage and then Treasure Island that he first suggested passion as the most important thing a youth can bring with them to the industry, ""because if you aren't passionate you're just spinning your wheels,"" a memorable bit of truth recalled between bites of Barbeque Prime Rib 'Tacos' served on crispy Won Ton Shells.

Enjoying dinner during Las Vegas Restaurant Week, the Chicken Vesuvio cooked in sweet Wine with Artichoke Hearts and Mushrooms is a crowd pleaser befitting a Casino described as having ""a local feel."" It was here that Chef Keith spent some time discussing how a background of discipline benefitted him and contributed to his worldview and his reasons for working with the Epicurean Charitable Foundation. ""Right after I graduated from boot camp, I was out on my own, right out in the world so I had to grow up quick. One of my first bosses in the Marine Corps was just that kind of guy - took me under his wing and taught me the things I needed to learn. Those are the kind of things I try to give back.""

Noteworthy for setting a high standard in Allergy awareness, every restaurant on the South Point property deemed allergen friendly and recently winning ""a national award for the best Allergy Program through a company called Allertrain."" The South Point's Food Safety Manager went on to say that he became interested in such things while teaching students for nine years at the Art Institute. ""So when ServSafe was mandatory, a lot of the properties who knew I taught food safety reached out to me.""

Thoroughly enjoying a clever plate called the ""Filet Trio,"" a trifecta of Steak Medallions served on toasted Bread beneath housemade Sauces, it was as the group carved up the 16oz Dry Aged Rib Eye that Keith went on to say, ""I've never believed that Health Departments should have to make us do what we as Chefs should be doing anyway."" He followed up by saying, ""We really have to raise the bar - protect the A."" His parting advice to Ben was to treat ""every day as a learning experience and never forget that.""

Certainly not planning to skip Dessert after such a meal, though the lack of an on-site pastry kitchen does mean most items are imported from elsewhere save for the best-selling Beignets and Vodka-spiked Dark Chocolate Ice Cream served with seasonal Berries, it was with a smile that Ben stated ""there is not an employee on the property who won't mention how good Chef Keith's attitude is or how passionate he is."" As dinner was finished with Coffee alongside Sticky Toffee Pudding and a Warm Apple Crumb Cake, the contended crowd departing on Chef Norman's advice that ""if you can maintain [a positive] attitude and make sure that everyone is better in your presence you're going to go a long way.""",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,4,vV69gGqE2p0u7BiMNRFfdQ

5371314,2017-09-25,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,Everyone was very courteous here during my 1st time experience. Ordered the Braised beef short rib entree with house salad and mashed potatoes. Very good. Wish it was a slightly bigger portion for almost $50. My brother and his friend ordered the Prime Rib. Their entrees were a lot bigger and looked more satisfying to the eyes lol Overall the food was great. The bread they brought out were pretzel bread sticks and raisin with walnut bread. Both were okay but not great or terrible either. Overall I had a pleasant experience. Thank you,eguB3eXzLRK3h40Oi0Iw3g,0,1,4,VDPSPOQvOsCK2vjOGuN9zg
5373082,2011-05-29,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"From the notes of tonight, Silverado Steakhouse is not a place that does a singular specialty item. Instead, they execute everything well. Our party of four decided to grab a a range of items and share dishes.

All their appetizers are $13. We ordered half a dozen raw oysters, jumbo lump crab cocktail, and a jumbo shrimp cocktail. The oysters were fresh and briny. The shrimp were monstrous and firm. The crab was the best out of them all. The huge pieces of crab are nestled on a bed of avocado and cucumber. A spritz of lemon and a bit of the sauce made for perfection.

Do not pass up on the cognac lobster bisque. It is ambrosial. The decadently creamy stock is them topped with small pieces of lobster and parley to mix in. The Caesar salad is also a good addition. It is the classic style, but could have used a bit more acid and anchovies. All salads and soups are $8.

For entrees we got the twin lobster tails, a 12oz steak and lobster tail, lamb chops, and the salmon. All of these dishes were delicious. The lobster took center stage. They were firm without being overcooked, juicy, and buttery on it's own. The lamb chops came in three on top of a demi glaze reduction. It was so good that I passed on dressing up my potato to dip in this sauce. The salmon was moist and flaky. The steak was cooked to a beautiful medium rare and thick. The surf and turf and lobster tails are at market price. The lamb chops were $39 and I do not remember how much the salmon cost. All meals are accompanied by a salad and a baked or mashed potatoes. We also got an order of asparagus and creamed corn. The former was cooked to perfection while the latter was just ok. Lawry's version is hands down the best. The last  time I went to Primarily Prime Rib, it was better. Maybe it was just a bad batch for the casino. Both cost $7 each.

We finished the night with their chocolate peanut butter bon bon and New York style cheesecake. Both are superb, but the bon bon did not stand a chance. 

The meal was only enhanced by the company. This is a perfect place for an intimate group to get together and have a slow course meal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,1,1,4,6cTnggnQeNCdNPpr1MTsDg

5447499,2011-01-15,2,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"We went here for Christmas Eve dinner. And only because we couldn't get a last minute reservation anywhere else. I must admit I had very low expectations. Well, let me tell you I was pleasantly surprised! Our wait staff was fantastic. The service was absolutely superb. The food was even better. I was happy with the fact that the meals came with salad and sides. The price did end up being outrageous for a local spot. But that was our fault. We went all out. We had dinner, desserts, wine, coffee and cocktails. The only negative I have about this place is the decor. If they got rid of the dumb murals and replace with paintings and turned down the lights a bit it would change the perception 100%. I would eat here with anyone from anywhere and be sure they would not be disappointed with the food. Turn up the atmosphere a notch and it's an all around winner. will be back again and again!!",FAsoP7gzkDmFdP-eYuysmw,1,1,4,ZA2RdnMz5b116CEYbj3-nQ

On a local recommendation we decided to forgo the restaurant The Cut at the Venetian to go to this local steak house..We called to let the restaurant know we were going to be 10 minutes late..When we arrived we sat down and waited..and waited..and waited until someone came over..no apology just what can I get you to drink..really?!

From the service to the food..big letdown! Our server was awful! No customer service, no polite conversation and then completely disappeared after we were done eating..

Empty plates sat in front of us way too long. My baked potato was cold..my caesar salad was drowning in salad dressing. And the waitress disappeared at the end of our meal!

My brothers, moms and Uncle's steaks were good..mine for being a strip was over done and had basically no flavor..So I asked for some Bearnaise sauce which you should never have to put on a strip..when the waitress brought it it was cold and had begin to settle..fail again!

Both were fine but nothing compared to the best steakhouses in LV.  It was nice that the steaks came w/ a potato and salad.  Sides were below average.  The creamed spinach wasn't good and the sauteed mushrooms/onions was not worth $7. 

Had reasonably priced bottles of wine which were fine.  Bread served was the same as every other restaurant at Southpoint.

I would definitely choose Outback over this place.  Not saying the steaks were bad..they were fine but just not worth going back for in a city with so many excellent places for steak.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,7,5,2,_BIbZj1MK4rshzfHfPMk8A
5626287,2014-07-14,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"First time here, and we had high expectations having heard that it was very good. 

Atmosphere is ""old west steakhouse"" with a cowboy theme, completely appropriate for the cowboy-themed South Point Hotel. 

The rumors are right! We started with the shrimp cocktail. Three perfectly cooked and very large shrimp. Followed by a tasty house salad, prepared table side with a champagne vinaigrette. 

Our dinners were bone-in rib-eye, filet Oscar style and a bowl of penne and a meatball (from Don Vito's next door) for our 8 yo son. 
We had mashed potato, a baked potato and steamed broccoli as sides.   The food was excellent. Meat was tender and flavorful. The oscar style comes with two strips of king crab meat.. Never seen anything like it!  

Service was very prompt, attentive and personalized without being pretentious. We were very impressed with the restaurants' willingness to cater to our son's desire for pasta.

This is a good steak house. The salad that accompanied our filet mignon was huge and delicious. It could have served as a meal by itself. The baked potato was also quite big and covered in a tasty preparation that enhanced its flavor. The filet itself was properly prepared and lightly covered with a tasty sauce. The wait staff was quite personable and , between the waiter and the bus boys, our glasses were never empty. There were many choices of wines available, but none very notable.
So why only three stars? Because this was just pretty ordinary. Ample portions of food that was good, to be sure, but nothing special in terms of preparation.",ElqtFedDDqa3og3nQY2Amg,2,0,3,YqyaX8zDMT79VtEcKr9bYw
5711277,2018-02-14,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"An average steakhouse conveniently located in the South Point Hotel Casino and Spa with stellar service and traditional ambiance. The restaurant is situated in the back right corner of the casino.  We had a reservation for eight at 6:30 on a Tuesday that turned into a party of 12. The hostess was able to easily seat us by combining some tables.  We were promptly greeted by a waiter accompanied by an assistant. He was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Complementary bread is served which includes traditional dinner rolls, pretzel buns and berry loaf.  The bread was room temperature and a bit on the tough side.  The wine list is sufficient with a good by-the-glass selection.  I ordered an eight ounce filet with garden vegetable which comes with a tossed side salad.  The salad was just lettuce, artichoke and cherry tomatoes.  If you had wanted to upgrade you were looking at an extra $10.  The steak came medium rare with five asparagus spears.  Overall the quality was fine but not what I would expect for the price.  Make sure you ask for the horseradish sauce as it makes the dish.

We picked Silverados because it has both steaks AND prime rib.  We are sooooo happy we came here! Service by Kelly (and helper Matt) was impeccable, absolutely amazing!  Fried green tomato appetizer with goat cheese and balsamic glaze was delectable. Salad tossed at table had both heart of palm and artichoke hearts with a light, house-made vinaigrette was wonderful.  My husband praised his filet (and he's really picky) and my prime rib was perfect!  This restaurant is our new Vegas favorite.

5750405,2011-12-14,4,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"This was about as mediocre as you can get.  Food was certainly nothing special.  The prime rib I had was worth half the $38 I paid and certainly wasn't a prime cut.  The horseradish was the runny, canned variety.  The bread served with dinner was OK but was cold and some pieces were very stale. 

The salad served with the dinners was great and I could have left after that.  The portions were very large but lacked any special preparation, taste, or flare.  

The wine list is rather decent if you aren't looking for a great bottle - and if you were why would you eat at the South Point.  Prices were excellent on the wine.

Someone in my party had the halibut that looked great and I would try that next time I go.

The service was rather apathetic and slow.  Nothing to make you feel special. I would rate the service as a step below Outback steakhouse.  This really irked me as I can put up with mediocre food if the service is excellent.  Why be in the service industry if you don't have any charm or warmth?  Not to digress, but I can't believe how poor the service is in Las Vegas at Casinos for the most part.  People, we're in a recession - if not depression in Las Vegas.  Service people in this town walk around like zombies.  They really need to step up their game in this restaurant.  It took 45 minutes to order and I was wondering 'what happened to my server, did he go on a break?'  My water was never refilled as well.

I would like to return to this restaurant but would rather go to the restaurant atop the M resort as it offers better (well actually has) views, same prices, and a well trained staff.  I have written other reviews pertaining to the South Point to express the positives and negatives I have experienced ranging from their hotel to other restaurants and have received responses from management which is nice to the extent that I think they will do something about it.

So South Point why shouldn't I go to the M resort or Lawry's instead of the Silverado Steakhouse? I receive better food, service and atmosphere.  Please put some effort into this place.",pHQcEJbsYThyl_861tc8ug,10,9,2,feUw5m2r9IdUMnK1TkyPqg

5850344,2014-07-11,0,JijwZPUuFqQqUekNR--dfw,"This place was HORRIBLE.. Sorry, not being mean, just honest.. We usually go up to the Mexican food restaurant at the South Point to get our steak because the steaks are good and you get chips, rice, and beans, etc.. We decided since the steak was good there it would HAVE to be better at the actual steak house.  

So... my parents were here and my dad's in poor health so it will probably be his last visit and we decided to try it out and they have a $29.99 meal that includes: soup or salad, steak or fish, baked potato or veggies, and dessert..  My mom thought she saw something that said you could forgo the dessert so I asked the waiter about it and he looked at me and said, ""Uh, no.""  So I said, ""Oh, okay, we just thought we saw something about that, well then I guess we'll do the special!"" I smiled, but he acted like I was wasting his time even though it was 5:30 and there were only 4 or 5 tables with people (we were the largest party with 5 people).  

So my dad ordered the wedge that comes with the special and asked if he could have it without tomatoes and the waiter said, ""They're whole tomatoes you can just take them off."" So we just kind of acted like, okay.. BUT, when dad's salad came the tomatoes weren't on it, so maybe he recognized how rude he was.  Anyway, then we all ordered and we all ordered steak.. 3 of us ordered medium rare and 2 ordered it medium.  Our steaks came and they were TINY and cooked WRONG.. We decided to just enjoy our time together, but when we left we all couldn't believe we spent $200 with tax and tip and 1 drink a piece for 3 adults for such a terribly cooked meal, horrible service, and a rude waiter.. 

Like I said, we were trying to have a good dinner with my dad before he left this morning.  OH, and the vegetable that comes with the meal was julienne so it looked like a tablespoon of stripped carrots and zucchini.. Needless to say we went home and ate (no we're not heavy people, in fact we're thin)..  And one other thing..  We were by the kitchen (and like I said, the restaurant wasn't busy so why?) anyway,  we heard the F bomb about 5 times back there until they put on some classical music, but we could still hear yelling and cursing.  

Horribly cooked food, horrible and old atmosphere, horrible waiter, horrible serving size, and just ruined the evening for all of us.  For the record we're all from Montana and know what Medium Rare or Medium means and what good steak tastes like.  Our steak at the Mexican restaurant in the South Point was leaps and bounds better and they cook it properly.  Never again!",iJm1JG-J8cFr9VafC6qIRQ,1,0,1,DR51uPW9ZUo59FW_V3N8_w

Personally, I liked the raisin bread.  My boyfriend and cousin had ordered the rib eye, which they described as to die for. The meat literally melted off the bone and into their mouth. My cousin described it as the best he has ever eaten.  I had the filet mignon, which was also just as good. It was really juicy and perfectly cooked.
