When it is hot in Vegas, this is a great place to cold down and indulge in their delicious sweet creations.

The ice cream is so creamy and rich it's hard to resist licking the plastic container your four scoops of deliciousness comes in, and ok, I almost did lick the container when I was done but a stranger would've seen me (my brother and sister in law would have to but they would understand and not judge me).

They seem to also have deals other days of the week too.

So 4 starts: The only thing I was disappointed in was the lack of seating outside. It's a walk-up window, which is fine, but non-existent seating is a dealbreaker. Lots of families, running, yelling kids (its an ice cream joint on $1 cone day right!?!) but the lack of seats made the commotion a little nerve racking for me.

Some are a little richer or sweeter than I'd like (choc.  peanut butter and chocolate raspberry truffle), so I stick with chocolate malt w caramel, banana creme pie, chocolate pecan, or chocolate marshmallow.

I always get Oreo ice cream (simply because their board is overwhelming and I don't know what's in any of the funny nicknames for flavors) but I'm reluctant to come back because the customer service is always less than desirable. First, there isn't anywhere to sit because there are always people sitting on the ONE bench outside, so by the time I get home and comfortable to eat my ice cream, it's melted. Second, there is just a stupid window which makes you feel completely isolated from the person making your ice cream when they literally shut the window while you're talking. And last, the people always take forever. What are you doing back there? All you have to do is scoop the ice cream... I'm not just talking about something I don't know about...

Now that's something to boast about being in existence for almost 70 years! 
I was 1st introduced to this deliciousness by my  husband about 7 years ago & that has left such an imprint in my head that whenever we get to go back to his hometown IT has to be the 1st pit stop before doing anything else .
 I think they're most popular for their Chocolate Pecan Ice Cream so it's just fitting that my 1st order for their opening day would be such & it did not disappoint!

I have a 2 year old that loves ice cream but he's not ready for the regular cones yet so the baby come they offer is perfect. He loves vanilla and it's the right amount. Every time my family goes there we order it for him and no problem, but today we were helped by a teenager/maybe early 20s kid who refused to give him any. He explained ""the baby cones are for babies! He wants ice cream he needs a regular size!"" I'm sorry but is the rule now only a infant can have a baby size cone? It wasn't even the matter of price because I know they offer the baby cones for free but if it was a big deal we would have paid for it because it's just the right size for him. But this guys literally refused! I don't know if he was trying to make money or thought we were taking advantage but it put a bad taste in my mouth!

712432,2015-11-16,1,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"This place seems busy usually but I can't understand why. It was dead tonight, Sunday at 7:30 pm. I've been here three times and it seems like the employees never know what they are doing. What's strange is they leave the dippers in the freezer which makes it impossible to scoop the ice cream. Each time I watch them struggle with trying to scoop the ice cream and get it out of the dipper. Have they never heard of a ""dip well"" that you leave the dippers in that trickles water so the scoops are always rinsed?

Tonight I got a banana split which is supposed to be a split banana (hence banana split) laid along the side of the three scoops in the container but only got a few slices dropped in beside the ice cream. Then he put the whipped cream on first before the toppings. Common sense should tell you this is wrong for anyone who's ever seen a picture of a banana split but he's an untrained teen so I can't blame him. For toppings, only a very awful tasting over portioned crushed pineapple and crushed maraschino cherries. Absolutely awful. And then no chocolate syrup and no nuts. Then he hands me the open container with the pineapple and crushed cherries spilling all,down the side from where he ineptly tried to put the toppings along side of the ice cream and whipped cream. Can't put it on top, whip cream came first. 

The last time I was there I got a hot fudge sundae and also no nuts and a smidgen of fudge. The way it looks is always unappealing. This is what happens when you turn your store over to be run by teenagers with attitude. They really don't care about what they are serving and when you're looking for a sweet treat to lift you up its quite frustrating to be served this crap.

They opened this store in a nice neighborhood with families that have probably a little more than the average families expendable income. If they provided a better customer experience, better product and presentation, they could get away with charging more. Serving poor quality product and giving poor service just because the price is low is not a mixture for success.

Two of us each went with our own 4 scoop sampler. This is an incredible deal at $4.25, and they have so many flavors that it would seem impossible to choose just one. 

We tried the following:

Coconut Cream Pie -- Awesome. Really the best coconut ice cream out there.
Cake Batter -- Just cake batter ice cream. You can get this anywhere. Though, it does have a large amount of sprinkles.
Chocoholic Chunk -- Tastes remarkably similar to Haagen Daz. Also good but not my favorite. 
Butter Pecan -- Tons of pecans. They really aren't cheap with their additives, which makes for great ice cream. 
Buckeye -- Real mini buckeyes make this a good ice cream. I could use more of a peanut butter swirl or something, though.
Spouse Like A House -- Too malt flavored for me and not enough pretzel. This was my least favorite.
Salted Pretzel Crunch -- So good. You have to love caramel and love chocolate covered pretzels. Luckily, I love both. 
Graham Central Station -- By far my favorite. I don't even like honeycomb, but it was perfect in this ice cream.

1702480,2015-02-08,3,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"Happy to hear a new ice cream shop opened up nearby my house with homemade ice cream?! After seeing their flavor choices on yelp once they opened, I admit I was not really excited to try anything because the flavors all sounded basic, nothing unique. I had no urgency to try this place and I am sucker for homemade ice cream. 

I've tried it and I don't get the hype. 

4 scoop sampler- salted caramel truffle, chocolate chocoholic, oreo, peanut butter chocolate something. 

The ice cream- soft and creamy but not in a good way. In a way that it will melt within a few minutes. We tried to take it home and we live a mile away. As soon as I got into the car I noticed the flavors melting into one another since all 4 scoops were next to eachother in a small plastic container which had ridges. Not to sound too picky but with ridges it melts into the ridges making it harder to eat. I would prefer a styrofoam cup over the plastic with ridges. Flavors are not memorable. They taste is very sweet, very artificial, and not special in any way to make me return. 

Service: people mentioned 4 windows. I didn't see that. I saw 2 people working. One was cleaning and one was stressed taking orders. There is this window that slides open. It was awkward because the girl working there asked if I wanted a sample. She held the door open while talking to me and had a hard time holding it and writing it down on her little notepad at the same time. Her awkwardness made me feel like helping her. I find that sliding window annoying because it stops the interaction much like a drive through window. If the ice cream was $1 a scoop I can see it being acceptable. But for $3.50 a scoop I would expect to have a place to sit (although there was a bench or two,one family of 4-5 people took over that area) and to be able to interact more with the person giving me the ice cream. Anyway I wanted two samples. She wrote one down halfway and the other she didn't write down. I never saw someone write a sample down. When she went to get it, she forgot the one she did not write down. I thought that was kind of sad. But she must have been overwhelmed because when she went to give me my ice cream I noticed her entire backside of her arm had blue ice cream smeared over it as it was dried on so it was there for a while. Gross! Take some time to wash your hands people. That's not ok.  

The sliding window showed even more awkwardness as she was unable to get me spoons and my ice cream without it slamming on her while my ice cream would have been thrown aside if she let the sliding glass door go. I just wanted to get out of there but I noticed she didn't give me napkins nor did I see any outside on the counter. I think napkins are a must for customers to have access to in Vegas summer heat.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,3,1,3,iAfyIeN2kXFm6mpfOlpDcQ

We got the 4 flavor scoop. Strawberry cheesecake, pistachio, their flavor of the month- key lime and Oreo. It was all really smooth. Next time we know we'll be fine with just 2 scoops of Pistachio! We put the leftover in the freezer for later. 

I'm not a fan of really sweet things and Pistachio was the least sweet of them and strawberry Cheesecake was the most sweet. I could try their no sugar added ice cream next time too. I wish they had a vegan ice cream flavor- I would be all over that!

2284124,2015-06-01,0,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"I first heard of Handel's Ice Cream from my bf. We decided to try the place since his dental professor claims it's the best ice cream in town! 

There was a line when my bf and I arrived at the location. I quickly noticed that Handel's was not your typical ice cream shop. Instead, they had two windows for placing your orders and a bench for sitting on the side. We didn't mind waiting in line, since there were so many flavors to choose from and the line seemed to move fairly quick. I ordered the ""4 flavor sampler"" that had butter pecan, birthday cake, cookies & cream, and rocky road. I was really impressed on how creamy the ice cream was, especially for the butter pecan!

Pros:
-$2 Tuesdays
-Bigger Scoops (in a cone - except for the ""4 flavor sampler"")  
-Good Service
-Affordable price for ice cream (awesome for those on a college budget!)

Cons: No place to really sit

Although I am lactose intolerant, I still make occasional stops for that butter pecan & waffle cone! Just pop in some lactose pills and you're good to go! I've tried Blue Bell & Cream... in my opinion, it still does not compare to the quality of Handel's Ice Cream.",aMEUgCLUF7HnEwq4URrkGA,3,1,5,-4ixbY8ZAKKPd4pgu86VkQ

Coming to this ice cream shop gave me flashbacks to an old place I visited in Kansas City when I was just 15 or 16 years old. It really doesn't seem to fit in the modern age, and I love that.  There is no establishment to enter, just windows that face the outside so they can take your order and hand your dessert off. There are some metal benches outside, but they aren't comfy. I took off a star because I would appreciate some seating so that this could be a date night. At the moment its just kind of a pick-up and go home place. Still, if I am completely honest, the vibes I get from ordering at the window are cool. All the employees are friendly and chill (get it?). Actually, I think I will give that star back. I would like chairs, but I appreciate them for what they are.

Judging by their other locations, it looks like they originated in Ohio. I am so ecstatic they chose to start up a shop in our own little city of Vegas! Do yourself a favor and get the sampler. You get four very decently sized scoops so you can try more than one flavor for only slightly more cash than a single scoop. Boyfriend and I always do the sampler! My favorite flavor is Ore-Dough. It's an Oreo/Cookie Dough mix that gets everything right! It isn't listed on their website so they may be late at updating.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,3,2,5,yXDryzVL0cORNUylML10DQ

I was a little turned off at first by a few things: One, this is an outdoor place. You go up to the window to order and there are only benches outside to eat at (which are really hot in the summer, so we ended up eating in our car with the air on). Two, some of the flavors have strange names, so you don't know what they are unless you ask. Three, it was kind of a long wait and there weren't that many people there.

But, the good outweighs any negatives here. The staff are very helpful. I asked what some flavors were and they were happy to tell me. They gave us samples of the flavors we wanted to taste. I asked one employee for her recommendation on a flavor, and I'm so glad I did. We got the four flavor sampler, and that's the way to go. It's around $4.25 for four scoops of ice cream.

I kidn of dig their set up. Just 4 walk up windows, no inside seating, but you can see where all the magic happens through the window. It is a little odd not looking at the ice cream as you make your selection. Given some of the odd names it can be tough to know what's what. However, I tried two samples and they were super cool providing them. Cost for a cone is less than Baskin Robbins and on Tuesday's I learned they have $2 scoops. If I lived closer I would definitely hit this place up on the regs. Being in the Henderson/Green Valley area that's just not possible.

For my maiden voyage I went with an old classic, Cookies & Creme. Or I think it was Oreo chunk, something along those lines. The pics from fellow Yelpers is what put it over the top for me. They are not shy with the Oreos, which is how all versions of this ice cream should be. Super creamy, Oreos were soft. And while there were a lot, they were spread out, so you didn't just eat the Oreo then have none for the rest of the journey. It was perfect. My wife went with the Cookie Dough and it was disappointing. Not a ton of dough and a little blah-zay. She loved my selection though.

Handel's only does window orders, so there's no building to enter. The order window closing on you as the employee grabs your order is a bit off-putting at first, but you get used to it, it's basically a ""walk-thru"" instead of a drive-thru experience. There are a few benches outside if you'd like to sit down and enjoy your treat, or you could always pick up a pint to take home. Our first visit was a bit of a revelation that we had been missing out. I got a single waffle cone of mint chocolate chip and my husband got the graham central station. When they say ""single"", they really mean way more than one scoop. The waffle cone was delicious, and I ended up leaving a scoop of ice cream in a bowl and popping it in the freezer for safe keeping. My husband has already been craving his graham central station selection. The girl helping us was very friendly and happily let us sample a few items since it was our first time. She told us their most popular flavors are the graham central station and the butter pecan. I did eventually go back and try the butter pecan, but found it way too buttery, while my mom thought it wasn't buttery enough (she's crazy lol). There are a lot more things for us to try here so it'll be nice to pop in here over the summer when it's hot outside.

My top flavors are pistachio, peanut butter parfait, praline pecan, and cheesecake. The best thing about their ice creams is that each ice cream flavors have the actual food in it. For example, cheesecake has cheesecake bites and pistachio has actual pistachios, etc. 

My least favorite ice cream flavor was Reese's peanut butter cups. I avoided getting the Reese's pieces one because I don't like Reese's pieces. I got the peanut butter cup expecting it to have crushed up peanut butter cups but instead, it was crushed up Reese's pieces! I don't know if the girl got my flavor wrong since she only remembered one out of my four flavors and had to ask again, but that was the only disappointing part of my meal.

I LOVE   ice cream  and my cousin (Anika C.) took my daughter and I here for a 4th of July special treat in Redondo Beach, CA. There are numerous flavors to fit your fancy from Vanilla with Oreo (my fav) to Buckeye and Graham Central Station; the flavors are endless and delicious. We were able to get a sample to tease our taste buds until we made it home. 
Don't let the line intimidate you...it goes by fairly quickly, once you try the ice cream you will understand why there is a line. This establishment has a walk up window to order your delectable creamery which gives it a nostalgic feel. On Tuesday's scoops are $2.00, you can purchase a pint to take with you and they have handle pops and so much more. We get the 4 scoop sampler so we can continue to try new flavors...which have not happened yet because we are satisfied with Birthday Cake, Cookie Dough, Vanilla w/ Oreos, and chocolate peanut butter brownie!!!

 I've had bad interactions with other businesses because of my lackluster reviews BUT I haven't had a bad interaction with them. And I'd like to keep it that way. 

If they serve you something, and it's not to your liking, they'll fix it. They try to do a good job. 

And I get it. It's homemade and hand-scooped so all the servings can't be uniformly good. But it's frustrating to buy a quart or a pint or some scoops and get home and it not be what you wanted. The 4.5 star overall rating shows that plenty of ppl *are* getting what they want so take my review with a grain of salt. If the flavor sounds appealing try it (especially on Tuesday) and *you* will probably like it.

My daughter got a scoop for her daughter-Oreo-to go for the two dollars (she is 8 & had some last nite & tonite & has enough left for dessert tomorrow nite!).

They make ice cream from scratch and you can tell from the flavors and textures. It's smooth and not icy like something that's been sitting and refrozen like other places.

I chose the twix parfait and did not regret it. It was quite large and my boyfriend told me I would not finish it. Well he was wrong because I basically inhaled it. Their hot fudge is so good!! Almost as good as nielsens hot fudge. In this case coming in second to that is not a bad thing.

But if there's one thing that's going to get them outside to brave the harshest of frozen desert temperatures in the winter, especially if they're the Yelping type, it's ice cream. 

I don't know much about the history of Handel's, just mainly that they're from Ohio and people all across the country love them. This new location, while possibly different from others I've heard about, is completely walk up service only. It's located in a shopping center on the NE corner of Tropicana & Hualapai. And even with a space size that puts pretty much every ice cream shop in town to shame, there is absolutely no where safe from the elements that is customer accessible. Well, besides their own vehicles of course. With 5+ walk up windows preparing to operate during all business hours, there shouldn't be any problem getting you served up pretty quickly though.

On the menu, you're going to find probably way more options then you'll know what do with. There's hurricanes, sundaes, parfaits, ice cream sandwiches, shakes...the list goes on! And if you just want a good ole fashioned scoop or two, there's about 40 or so different choices between the regular ice cream flavors, sherbets and the monthly special. I'm all for having options, but to be honest, there's almost too much here. It could be just be my indecisiveness kicking in, but it was a bit overwhelming. I will say this though. The 4 scoop sampler is one of the coolest things they offer, and I'd imagine it's got to be pretty popular. It's exactly what I ended up going with, and is a steal at only $4.25.

It took a while but we ended up going with Banana Cream Pie, Buckeye, Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House (vanilla ice cream with peanut butter ripple and chocolate covered peanut butter pretzels swirled in). Each flavor was spot on with what they described and I'd have a hard time picking out a favorite of the four. The banana had a nice, smooth whipped cream type texture and big chunks of banana. The Buckeye had plenty of whole candies in it, which are basically like a big Rolo, but with peanut butter inside. And both the Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie and Spouse Like A House had plenty of peanut butter flavor without having that terrible frozen peanut butter texture. All were a tad on the sweet side, but very creamy and delicious. The only thing I didn't like is that they all started to melt pretty quick, even in the January winter weather. I imagine during the summer, it'll be tough to finish before you have sugar soup.

For being all window ordering, the service is very friendly. Each employee we talked to was very friendly and seemed to be quite knowledgeable about the products. With our visit being on the first day open, I think that's pretty impressive. Adding that to good quality products at great prices, I'll definitely be returning to Handel's!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,9,6,4,yc7IrRN5FOqhxnOGSPeIsA

I could decide where to start... literally there are so many things to choose from... they serve everything out of a window which reminds me of the snack shops along the beaches back home. 

There were 2 workers working there when we came... they seemed young.. the guy that took care of us could not remember our scoops so he had to keep coming back to the window... we ordered the 4 scoop sampler which is just scooped into one clear Togo container. Definitely thought that there would be some dividers or something. 

PINK CHAMPAGNE SHERBERT - light & also had a pretty color aahahaha 

ORANGE SHERBERT - not my choice... but it was still OK 

SPOUSE LIKE A HOUSE - thanks to Jin N. Review we got this for the big brother & he liked it w/ the chocolate 

COFFEE CHOCO CHIP - My choice & it was good definitely had a whole bunch of chocolate chips in them which gave the coffee a more espresso flavor 

STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE - Could use more if the cheesecake flavor

STRAWBERRY x2 - Cant go wrong w/ strawberry

CHOCOLATE - Chocolate is chocolate

I really don't understand why everyone is complaining about the lack of seating? I don't understand how you could give this place less than five stars.

People find anything to complain about. Vegas has large chain restaurants and lacks the ""mom and pop"" shops that you can taste the love in whatever they serve.

Portion sizes are generous, with a ""single scoop"" actually consisting of three small scoops of ice cream. The product itself is pretty good. There are plenty of chocolate truffles in the chocolate raspberry truffle flavor, the New York style cheesecake ice cream was also full of cheesecake chunks, and malt balls and bits of graham crackers dotted the Graham Central Station ice cream.

I pulled this place up on Yelp before heading over and didn't realize, even after reading others reviews that this place has no actual store front so keep that in mind. It is walk up window service ONLY. That wasn't too big of a deal but might take some reconsideration in the summer time on hot days or for those who have a car full of kids. 

Handel's has an extensive menu full of fun names and sweet flavors of creamy goodness. I didn't want to be one of those people that didn't know what I wanted, but I guess I was. I asked a total of three questions and was given short agitated answers by the man behind the window. I'm sorry I don't know what cookies or candies are inside your ice cream flavors sir. The man was impatient and seemed rushed to get me away from his window. I quickly ordered a cone with graham central station and paid in cash. I was at the window a total of two minutes...no one was behind or in front of me. 

The ice cream was delicious with swirls of graham cracker and chocolate and a nice healthy service for less than $4 but I don't feel welcome enough to come back and worry that not having an actual store might hinder customers with small children who want to pick a ""color"" or need a place to sit while eating their cones.

ATMOSPHERE:

Handel's Ice Cream from Ohio is the latest frozen treat spot to open on the Southwest side of town. Walk up windows are your only choice here, and it's standing room only like we did,  in the evening, and while it was in the 40's. Just like Luv-It Frozen Custard, your car is your dining area...

BITES:

A wide variety of flavors to choose from, sundaes, shakes, splits, pints, you name it, they got it! I went with the Four Scoop Sampler ($4.25) so I could try four of their 25+ flavors offered. My choices were Banana Cream Pie, Blueberry Cobbler, Salted Caramel Truffle, and Spouse Like A House which is malted vanilla ice cream with chocolate covered peanut butter filled pretzel pieces. I enjoyed the Banana Cream Pie and Spouse Like A House, but my other two flavors were a bit too sweet for my tastes. I also got a bite of Wifey's Cherry Cordial Sundae, and that too was very sweet! overall, just okay for me, but I can at least say I've tried Handel's.

CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Variety, flavor options, and price point may catch people's attention, but be warned that there's no dining area, only your car, and some of the flavors tend to be excessively sweet which may not be such a good idea if you have kids. They'll definitely be bouncing off the walls!  ALOHA!!!

He insisted that he could not do 1 scoop of one flavor and 1 1/2 scoops of another. Which seems crazy to me. And I know they have done it before. Then my friends ordered and paid the whole bill. After they paid they saw that we were double charged the milkshake and my cone. When we brought it to their attention, the server was curt and handed her $6.50, the cost of the milkshake. My friend pointed out that she was still owed for the cone and tax. So the manager came over and was just as curt. He finally gave her the cash back and then slammed the window shut. I was shocked.

But customer service is terrible and MAYBE not because of the server's fault.  It's the store policy!

My daughter, her friend, and I went into the store to buy ice cream cones.  The server takes our order and hands the cone to my daughter and her friend.  Well, the scoop of ice cream falls out of the cone and onto the floor.  We made it a point to tell the server the ice cream just fell right out without tipping the cone.  He replied the rehearsed line, ""it's our policy not to replace the ice cream."".....REALLY?.....  And this after you didn't smush it down into the cone hard enough so it could stay put or that the little girl didn't tip the cone over? (she's 9)  So I had to shell out another $3.75 to replace the cone.

I think the goodwill shown by replacing the ice cream scoop for free is better than having to charge the customer more money for something that wasn't even the girl's fault.  I don't fault the server  (he's following orders from the owners) but taking good care of your customers is worth a lot more than an extra $3.75. You can always make an exception, especially when it's a young child.

When we arrived I noticed that it's a walk-up window only.  Not a problem since we were not going to eat there anyway.  They have a good size menu with lots of flavors and cookie sandwiches.  My son decided on the latter and I opted for two scoops on a waffle cone.  I proceeded to order when the girl tells me that I cannot get two scoops of two different flavors.  She stated they go by serving size.  I stood there with a confused look on my face.  Okay, so I cannot get two scoops with two different flavors? Isn't a scoop a serving size?  I'm confused.  She said no, then went on to explain their serving size.  Again I was a little confused.  Whether it be scoops or serving size, she made it seem as if I could not get two different ones on a cone.  Her explanation was a little weird to me, thus leaving a sour taste in my mouth. Especially after looking over to the gentleman next to me, walking away with two different scoops on a regular cone.

3960324,2018-04-10,0,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"My continuing mission to discover nondairy ice creams (Ice dessert) in Las Vegas has  brought me to Handel's. The mission is also to pursue those icy sweet indulgences while preserving my fragile digestive system. This time, mission was a success. 

Handel's has three nondairy options: 1) Coconut, 2) Watermelon Ice, and 3) Mango. They are all distinctly fantastic. Three options may seem measly, but this is the most I've seen in a ice cream shop thus far.  

Coconut is my favorite fruit; messing it up would have instantly made the mission a presumptive failure. Luckily, Handel's coconut ice ""cream"" blew me out of the water. The coconut was not overpoweringly sweet--something I value highly. The coconut flavor was subtle just like a real coconut. More impressive was the soft coconut flesh hidden in the ice cream, they added some welcoming texture which also retained the flavor a bit longer in the mouth once the cream portion happily melts away. Needlessly to say, Handle's coconut ice cream was a resounding victory. 

The Watermelon Ice flavor was equally impressive. As the name suggests, this is just ice with presumably watermelon juice. The lack of creamy taste is a refreshing contrast to the coconut. Again, no overpowering sugar taste here, each spoonful filled with potent watermelon flavor. The texture is soft but does not have that sandy texture most shaved ice have. It almost feels like crushed watermelon flesh. Pretty cool. 

I only had a little bit of the mango because I am just not a big fan of the fruit. However, I will not be hesitant to recommend the mango flavor to those who love mango--It had the same great attributes the coconut flavor had.

My mission to discover nondairy ice desserts continues on, but it could have ended with Handel's. If you miss out on ice cream because of dairy, Handle's got you covered.",96GpOsmTQa0UJSo_9JEOog,2,1,5,6KipthaZ7jOsEwhR7z23SQ

We biked over to earn our ice cream. There are no tables so we had to sit on the cement; hopefully, they'll rectify this. 

I felt perplexed when I read other reviews saying the ice cream was too sweet. Then, I tried it. It is, indeed, very very sweet. I ordered the caramel pretzel crunch but I got the salty Carmel truffle. No biggie but a mix up nonetheless. 

They are very nice but certainly not speedy if you're in a hurry. I've already seen a line in January! Good for them. About 40 flavors to try so we will certainly have to go again. A neighbor recommended trying something more inherently bitter like a dark chocolate to cut the sweetness. Sage advice for the next visit. 

My little one got the birthday cake. It had chunks of fondant in it. Holy moly - this could put you into a diabetic coma in seconds. Sooooo unbelievably sugary. He liked it, of course.

I decided to get the 4 sampler and my husband wanted a hurricane. The guy who helped us from the left windrow told us they can't make a hurricane anymore. It didn't need to take him to roll his eyes to show that he was being so salty to his customers. Though it looked like he really wanted to. The other guy on the right window was alright by the way. I wasn't sure if this guy was in a bad mood or something. But my husband felt so uncomfortable to the point he finally got so irritated and decided not to get anything for himself anymore. At first there was a lady in front of us that ordered and before she even completely finished ordering, the guy just shut the window on her. I felt bad for the lady because she was so sweet and she felt a little embarrassed about what he did too. Too bad we came in the wrong time as our first time.

It's a little weird of a place with no inside, you order at a window and just leave with your ice cream. There's no sitting down, so if you're thinking of hanging out while enjoying your ice cream, this is not the place. According to the guy, it's old school, like ice cream places used to be back in the day.

The only reason why I'm not giving this place five stars is the service. See, it's not the fact that you can't sit down and enjoy your ice cream peacefully, that didn't bother me as much as the way the guy who served us was acting. So grumpy, not personable at all.

And it was perfect. It was the correct Blue Moon flavor and it was so creamy and delicious. I recommend this flavor completely. I don't know how to describe the taste other than ""kind of like fruity pebbles"" but trust me, it's awesome. 

I also got to try a bite of the Nutella/chocolate hazelnut flavor (yum) and while eating our ice cream we were already talking about what we'd want to try next time! 

I honestly can't wait to come back and try more ice cream flavors here. I love that this is a local business and I adore that they sell hard packed ice cream, which is so hard to find in the valley.

The best deal is the four scoop sampler. You get four scoops of ice cream for $4.25! What a steal.

I got this and tried chocolate chip cookie dough, pistachio, chocolate peanut butter and another peanut butter flavor but the name escapes me! (oops :) ) 

I loved the pistachio-one of my favorite flavors for sure.

It's nice to see so many people are excited for this new addition in the SW community. A personal recommendation from our son's teacher was our nudge to try this place. The excitement was quite contagious as you see natives of Youngstown abuzz and reminisce their childhood days eating this ice cream. They have an interesting lay out as there isn't any tables, chairs or benches to sit on, just a walk up window to order, which I think would be challenging during summer time when people just wanna hang out and relieve themselves from the unforgiving Vegas heat. 

We got the Banana split for the hubby; Blueberry crumble, Buckeye and Salted caramel truffle single scoops at $3.50 each which in retrospect, had I paid attention or a suggestion from the lady helping us, we should've gotten the sampler instead which would have been a better value at $4.25 for 4 scoops. The flavors I tried seemed to be on the sweeter side which was a little too much for me.

The person handwrites your order and disappears. They come back with your items one by one, then when you have to pay, they take your credit card away to a back area to process your charge.

So Handel's offers a large variety of flavors to choose from. Not only that so many different ways to have your ice cream too. It's a bit overwhelming but in a good way!   Also, they are cheap either!  This is a walk up place so don't expect to sit anywhere besides the benches. 

They make ice cream from scratch and you can tell from the flavors and textures. It's smooth and not icy like something that's been sitting and refrozen like other places. Their ice cream really leans on the side of frozen custard.  

I chose the Oreo Cookie Sandwich, which was okay.  But I really enjoyed the Butterfinger Twist, which made every bite come to life.  My brother ordered a Milkshake and he feel absoulty in love with it after the first sip.

Our interaction was painless since I kinda knew what I wanted already. 

There's no place to sit inside to enjoy your ice cream. It's basically an enclosed ice cream stand. There's a couple park benches you can sit at but other than that you eat in your car or take it home. 

Over by Tropical Smoothie Cafe there's a lot of picnic tables if you wanna walk over there. 

We were there on Tuesday for the $2 deal but opted to get the 4 scoops sampler for $4. We got coconut, Oreos, strawberry cheesecake & graham central station. They were all good.

Madness
Oree-Dough and Graham Central Station
Blondie Sundae with Buckeye and Peanut Butter Parfait, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Cherry

An Ohio native of the Northwest who spent his formative years with Toft's, Friendly's, Breyer's or Soft-Serve before developing a taste for the finer things at Jeni's in Columbus, it really does not seem all that strange that it took 36 years to visit Youngstown-based Handel's Homemade Ice Cream & Yogurt but on Saturday the omission was finally righted, a trip to the Las Vegas Scoop Shop on the corner of Hualapai and Tropicana actually more impressive than one may of thought.

Born in 1945, techniques changed but formulas still using an old-school base with all flavors churned on site, Handel's Las Vegas occupies a somewhat out-of-the-way corner in the western Suburbs and with nothing but tableless benches offered as seating the layout is decidedly grab-and-go only, a few patrons wavering over nearly thirty options while others opted to do some tasting.  

Featuring four windows, though the midday only saw two open as a duo of young ladies provided smiles with the scoops, tastes of Butter Pecan and ""Salty Caramel Truffle"" reminded me of slow-spun flavors from my childhood, the Banana Cream Pie and Birthday cake trending a bit more over-sweet and artificial while a seasonal special titled ""Midnight Madness"" delivered all sorts of richness with Dark Chocolate Punched up by Oreos and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.

Affordable and sizably portioned compared to others, two scoops approximating a pint for just $4.25, it was on the cashier's advice that Graham Central Station was paired to Chocolate-Chip Cookie Dough with a mix-in from Nabisco, the former a lot like eating soggy S'mores while the later was exactly as might be expected, the texture intriguing but overwhelming sweetness difficult to ignore.

Always a sucker for a Sundae, not to mention housemade baked goods, part two of the tasting entailed a warm blondie at the base of a plastic clamshell and although whipped cream and caramel were both no better than store-bought the pairing of Peanut Butter Parfait and a treat from my Home State were as delicious as they were nostalgic, the blend reminding me a lot of Moose-Tracks - a flavor so difficult to track down in my childhood that a  three hour trip to Youngstown may not have been all that bad.

THREE STARS:  Noteworthy for its old school appeal, though nouveau Artisans have long left their flavors and smoothness far behind, Handel's is well served in its suburban strip-mall location, no doubt a step-up from the Midwest to Sin City while still maintaining its nostalgia but by no means 'destination worthy' stuff.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,6,3,v-PmK2jQvUhdaM4S3vX6Ug

5434719,2015-05-24,0,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"I'll start off by saying that I'm completely biased toward Handel's. I'm from Youngstown, Ohio where this ice cream chain originated not 10-20 years ago, but 70 years ago. Because I've been eating this ice cream since the 80s, this ice cream is my standard and what I use to compare everything else.

As far as their service procedure, one person is at the window and he/she takes your order, makes it, and cashes you out. Everything is made when ordered, including hand packing the pints and quarts. There are no seating  areas aside from a few benches. This is the way it's done at the original Handel's on Market and Midlothian in which you go and wait at least 15-20 minutes in line and you eat ice cream inside or outside your car. Should they continue this procedure like it's 1945? Absolutely not and hopefully they'll make some changes. For now, just be prepared for the wait and to enjoy your ice cream somewhere else beside a table or bench.

We shared the banana split this last visit and it was the same delicious ice cream as it always is. Some may think the sweetness and creaminess factors are high, but they are just right to me. 70 years worth of satisfied customers will also agree with me.",Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw,0,0,5,DuupAnX7GO483Tb0KSFZSg

5620687,2015-01-17,5,nlsibvBeSc8vfus2KuQatA,"Another new dessert spot serving frozen carbs has opened up.  I've never heard of Handel's before which is kind of bad since it was born in Ohio and so was I; I'm not a good Buckeye, apparently.  We came by on the first night of opening because Yelpers have FOMO like that.  I didn't know it was an outdoor establishment where you order at the counter; there's no place to eat indoors.  Because of this fact, our group of friends was standing around in a circle eating our ice cream, trying to create body warmth amongst us while we ate spoonfuls of frozen sugar; go figure.  There are a plethora of flavors to choose from, making it difficult to choose.  Thankfully, there is a 4 scoop sampler available for $4.25, which was just perfect.  The b/f chose two flavors and I chose the other two, which were Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie, Cherry Cordial, Spouse Like a House (Louse? Mouse?), and Buckeye.  Spouse Like a House, the flavor with a funny name, is vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered peanut butter pretzels and it's delicious.  I also liked Buckeye, which has chocolate-peanut butter candies shaped like the nut of Ohio's state tree.  Actually, all four flavors were fabulous.  I can foresee this place being popular with the Bishop Gorman students since their campus is right down the street, as well as any other ice cream lover.

When I finally reached the front of the line, a mean elderly lady cut me. The lady argued could cut everyone because no one was ready to order but her. This upset everyone waiting in the sun even more. When I ordered, the guy at the window slowly took my order, would come back, hand me an ice cream, then tediously  leave and close the window to go get another ice cream. There has to be a better system! It is not that this the world's best ice cream and people are lining up, getting speedy service, and leaving. People have to stand in a line for a long, long time. So do not get deceived with the long line of people like I did. Regarding the ice cream, I thought the ice cream was too sweet. Besides the long line which requires standing within a bunch of angry, frustrated consumers, there are only three benches to sit and eat your ice cream. They should add some ice cream tables.",1NbFusAiFMOLT1vOUyVr8Q,0,0,2,c0D4tCs4ex7RsrP1dVuRnA

Tons of different flavors to choose from. Almost problematically so, because every flavor is equally great. They do a 4-flavor sampler which is a great option, because then you can become addicted to multiple flavors, rather than just one.

It is a slightly odd setup. No interior seats or tables. You walk-up to the window and order and pay right there. Not a problem, just different, that's all. We found it because some lady on Family Feud said it was the best.

I will definitely be going back, but I wish they had more locations in Vegas. This one is located a long way from everything in Vegas, and could be more convenient.",QwlyaXlnt5QRZ_l2JA3TpQ,2,1,5,xRBnf6qG8gv0FA3LsYZxYg

Its like a glorified ice cream stand lol. One thing I like is the amount of flavors!!! They have classic flavors and new flavors! I usually get the 4 scoop sampler because I can never decide on one flavor. The service is always nice here but sometimes they have long lines.

Prices aren't cheap, about $3.50 for a scoop.  It was a nice scoop, and you can even say a generous scoop, but its still one scoop of ice cream.

Large selection of flavors. I bought a handpacked pint of Salty Caramel Truffle ($4.95) then went back for a hot fudge sundae made with Cherry Cordial the next night ($4.75). I think their best deal is the 4 scoop sampler for $4.75.

The ice cream is pretty good. It's not Tillamook Ice Cream good, but its pretty good. The hot fudge sundae could have been a little bigger, and had some peanuts. It's probably 3.5 stars but since its ice cream and semi-local I rounded up.

I got a 4 scoop combo for less than $5. What a deal. 

Spouse like a house was my fave flavor. A great choice for peanut butter lovers. I'm not a huge fan but this was gooooood. Oh man, it was like eating Reese's butter cups but an ice cream version or something. Imagine a cold or sit butter mouse cake. Mmmmmmmmm. We also got grape. Such an odd choice but this was also my top fave flavor. Would def go back for these two. 

I think I'll skip the Oreo and the salted caramel. I'd rather eat Haagen Daz for Oreo or that fancy shmancy McConell's salted caramel which is only sold at whole foods.

I didn't even know that this was an ice cream place because of the walk-up window. That's how they keep this place really clean, by not having a store with constant foot traffic. Smart, I suppose. They have a pretty big menu - cones, sundaes, smoothies, hurricanes, etc. So many flavors of ice cream, but I decided to be boring and try the Oreo. It really was nothing special. I am fine with my Dreyer's Cookies 'N Cream ice cream that I have at home.

Anyway, didn't come back here for a while since I am actually a fan of Thrifty's ice cream at Sweet Addiction. When I ended up here again for the second time, I decided to order the Raspberry Sherbet Parfait since it looked good in the picture. Daaang, it was delicious! Can't even remember the last time I actually had good Sherbet, but this is the only reason why I keep coming back! Although, the amount that you get is a hit or miss depending on the employee who makes it. Sometimes the scoops are huge and stacked high, and sometimes the scoops are just sad. 

The lines can be long during the summer. Maybe I'll try other flavors of their ice cream in the future, but for now I am definitely a fan of their Sherbet!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,4,3,4,GVvhqjkkU-LK_AmoICyFcQ
