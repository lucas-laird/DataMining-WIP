I remember her telling me once that she had never eaten at a Panda before so I recommended we eat at the one near campus. She agreed. I had anticipated that there would be 1 or 2 people in front of us ordering their food.

Was I right?

No

This restaurant was dead. Absolutely dead, no one except those working there was there. I gave it a 4 because of that. Overall, as always I love the food. But being today was a religious holiday I couldn't eat certain foods. that was the only down side but nothing that would bring me down or stop me from eating panda.",7QRec81IeLgHcG6Tln0D8w,0,0,4,3V5H_AOAOVRSHE4j8uqB3w

A few times I go there and order something that looks less than fresh, and they always take my order, throw out the non-fresh item I just ordered and make it right then. It may take a few moments, but I never have to ask them to make a fresher batch, they can see as well as I can, and I like that.",dOBVvU3YFkGjlAAtyKO2dQ,0,0,4,E9lgAjh3O9TMv2XyziAL1w

655786,2015-12-12,0,Z5OoLZ_gKDHZGKs6gtR28w,"This has got to be the worst Panda Express my Family and I ever ate at. The orange chicken was mushy and the honey walnut shrimp tasted like it was dipped in bad batter or something. Very inconsistent with other  Panda Express Restaurants we've had up here so far. 

Costumer service is bad as well. If I could give this a total of 0 stars, I totally would. The biggest let down was, we came here using a promo code for BOGO and before picking up our plates, we noticed an error, so we called. The guy who answered said he would change the order, but in exchange he charged my daughter for the second plate. So, no damn BOGO! My advice to anyone wanting to eat at this Panda Express, don't! To top it off, my daughter felt a bit sick after eating their food. We ordered a total of 4 plates. What a waste of a damn good promo code too. Even the Shanghai Beef was not up to par. Two thumbs down. I hope their managers see this and correct any customer service problems and let their cook know, they SUCK!!!!",re3C9Kw0s7mPDugRyw0WTg,0,0,1,12r60tIJF-6y-OqZcN3mMQ

The portions were a little more than what you would normally get which is good, and the servers were nice and quick, but it was a little rough chewing.

3698454,2013-04-14,0,Z5OoLZ_gKDHZGKs6gtR28w,"the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant.

I arrived at 8:45pm and the place was packed.  3 employees on the line and 3 cooking.  You could tell they were working hard to get everyone served quickly.

I ordered egg rolls with my meal, and they had just sold out.  It happens.  He asked me if I minded waiting for a fresh batch, and I told him it was no problem.  Well, it did take a while for them to be ready...to the point that most people might have started getting mad.  But, here's why I was impressed:

#1.  I have no idea who the manager was.  Everyone was on their game to get it done and you could tell that they genuinely cared.

#2.  While I was waiting, they apologized and I knew they meant it.  Two of them asked how my day was.

#3.  I was offered a cup to get something to drink while I waited (I hadn't ordered a drink).

#4.  When I left, he said:  ""I'd like to offer you a coupon for the next time you come in.  Since you had to wait as long as you did.""  It was an unexpected but nice touch.

In times that it's so easy to get pissed off about things that are beyond anyone's control, it's great to see that people actually care about serving customers.",TszSb9N49c8JPRevXG2GeQ,0,0,5,4pplaPCVMWwNkuZj6XV_Kg

4820034,2018-01-29,0,Z5OoLZ_gKDHZGKs6gtR28w,"Im going to start off by saying my family loves panda. But ever since we moved to this side of town and had panda at this location something is always wrong with our food. I made it a point to stop coming to this location and just take the time to go to the one thats alittle further on decatur and charleston. But today i decided we would try again and i wasnt impressed. 
The server was helping a someone ahead of me and the first thing i didnt like was  when the customer changed her mind on the food she had served, the employee thought it was ok to just put the food back into every tray that it originally came from. How is this okay??? People can be alergic to certain things and she just thought it was okay to do this even if the food had already been in one plate together. 
Second thing is of cours being a regular panda customer i knew exactly what i was going to order. One of my plates included half and half fried rice and chow mein. One the fried ricehad dark pieces in it and smelled burnt. Second was the chicken string bean and orange chicken. Orange chicken was okay but the chicken string bean wasnt all that pleasant this dish aswell had the burnt pieces all around the chicken. 
The 2nd and 3rd dish ended up both veing teriyaki chicken and orange chicken since what i was originally going to get looked horrible!That being the beef and broccoli. The broccoli looked old and the juice it was sitting in just looked nasty! I will never come to this panda again!",20BbENYaXDIZoQ8pPP8IxQ,1,0,1,S1bWEEQ7FF2R4pVfgq8LsQ

I still am a very frequent customer but what I saw at this location disturbed me..I walked in to a dirty place..where not a single person either customer or worker was speaking English. .not Mandarin or Cantonese either but SPANISH...REALLY?? Don't get me wrong: I'm Mexican too but I couldn't get past the feeling that I was going that something wasn't right. Everyone stared at ME like I was the misfit and i got uncomfortable there. I couldn't trust Chinese food being served in an atmosphere of being at La Bonita. They just made me feel very uncomfortable by not speaking English and making me feel like I don't belong..and the food looked overcooked and not fresh at all,Dff_MlN-_VZjm-AP_oFWhQ,0,0,1,JnnbayGdKPxh3XFfyqnaFQ
