The sauce the guy recommended was amazing (a mix of 2 sauces named after the chef) but what killed it for me was the rice. For one they don't offer sushi rice which is a lil disappointing, and on top of that the white rice wasn't cooked well at all. Some pieces were very hard and there were several chunks stuck in balls as if it was old.  the quality of fish was just ok too but considering it's a poke spot and only $12 for a large bowl u get what u pay for. However if the eel came with 4 pieces instead of 3 I probably woulda given it 4 stars",APFFOFEWKMv_LGf97CQHsg,0,0,3,VsZmOZg09n5xUH5h_aYGPA

I got the exact same thing I would at DIY and this was really just awful. I feel sick now. This is like if white people opened a poke place..even the eel sauce was awful.

I want to take also mention two staff members in particular who were fantastic. Jasmine, who was so sweet, helped with the protein stage of my bowl and made an amazing sauce combination that escapes me now, but was absolutely delicious. Aaron, who helped with the toppings, was spectacularly polite and friendly and put time and effort into the presentation of my bowl - so much so I asked to take a picture after he was finished to send to my friends.

It is a Chipotle style order at the counter to create your own dish. Start by deciding bowl or burrito. Then which rice (white or brown) or lettuce, then the protein decision (choice of about 5 or 6). Next which sauce (again 5 or 6 options). And then choosing the add ins (about a dozen to choose from). I went with brown rice, double spicy tuna, eel sauce plus chipotle sauce, and about 5 other add ins. Everything tasted very fresh. Huge portion - very filling. The decorating in the restaurant is spartan at best. It is set up for take out or functional eating rather than dining. Using the coupon, lunch for 2 after tax and tip, well under $20. Good value.

The inside is very nice and minimally decorated currently.  Was a few people in front of me and some seemed newer to the sushi burrito life. Some employees are definitely trying to find their groove here as I did have to point out the unagi for my burrito.

2255649,2017-03-20,0,rbQOcy2n8dBPpm5ua3VU_Q,"This is undoubtedly my favorite pokebowl/sushi burrito place in the area (I've been to 3 others). First off, the prices are pretty reasonable, about 11$ for a large poke bowl (with three proteins). That's about what I would spend anywhere else considering that other places usually charge for some of toppings Sweet Poke gives for free.

I've been here a few times already, the staff is friendly and always complies with what you ask for. Sometimes, a few members seem to be a little lacking in energy, but they're still really polite and nice. 

The food itself is amazing. I usually build my own poke bowl. My typical order is 2 scoop of ahi tuna and unagi on brown rice, but I've also tried their shrimp tempura and salmon. Fish always tastes really good, last time I ordered it the tempura tasted a little bland though, not bad but not amazing (probably because it sits with the other protein choices on the bar and is reheated)

My favorite part is definitely the sauces and toppings though. I've tried their ginger shoyu, unagi (eel sauce), spicy mayo and their creamy jalapeño. The creamy jalapeño is definitely my favorite. I always ask them to put some of the sauce on the rice since they'll typically only toss it with the fish. The variety of toppings they have is amazing! And as I mentioned before, unlike most places, they won't charge extra for a scoop of certain toppings! (Surimi crab/spicy tuna/spicy crab, seaweed salad, avocado). 

I would also recommend trying their taro chips. They have a nice texture and taste and come with that creamy jalapeno sauce to dip it in.

2955590,2017-11-21,1,rbQOcy2n8dBPpm5ua3VU_Q,"I'm updating my review after trying Sweet Poke several times since my last review. I've also compared it to other poke venues around town.

I've found that other poke places suffer from low quality ingredients and it's so evident if you just simply look at the color of the fish. At Sweet Poke I can honestly say they are as consistent as you can be. The unagi (eel) is by far my favorite ingredient here and I love how they warm it up in the toaster oven before serving. The shrimp is very fresh and thinly sliced so it's easy to consume. Don't you hate it when they serve chunks of cold shrimp? None of that here.

Lastly I see that they've added more sauces and I had the garlic sauce which was simply amazing with my poke bowl.

The prices are still a little steep considering the size of the portions. Again, the large is a decent size but the portions of the fish they give you is pretty small. But the quality is well worth it. Ps I see that they have a new lunch menu I'm gonna try out next time: Small bowl of ramen with any order of a reg bowl, burrito or cooked special for only $12 bucks. Considering the large bowl is already $12 bucks, you can enjoy poke and ramen with this special. Pretty cool!",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,3,1,5,om9lQmfClfNZKo_sQ_vJqg

I had the Dragon bowl (unagi, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado, crab with eel sauce and chipotle mayo $9.50). It was a fair portion for the price. So much food. The flavors blended together well and one of the things I love about Sweetfin Poké is they do great things with the toppings and texture. Sweet Poké did a great job all of the above. My husband had the Citrus Salmon (salmon, red onion, spicy tuna, masago, cilantro, wasabi yuzu with mango salsa $9.50). That was quite tasty as well.

I was so pleased and so excited about this poké spot that I immediately sent my poké fans a photo of my food and recommendation. Now they can't wait to try Sweet Poké too!",7xwLiQx0-lCOXBUDAcazZA,4,3,5,dbCcRRRVkfFzs1hrESBEyQ

You pick your proteins, and pretty much build your own bowl and sushi burrito.
The toppings was a total delight. It was hard to make a choice because they give you so many options at no extra charge. Loving it!
You get to choose several  sauces which is a plus. Fresh and defined flavors.
They have several locations. I went to the Eastern Ave  location in Henderson, the staff were friendly, efficient, and when I couldn't make up my mind what to put on my sushi bowl the server at the counter patiently waited. I didn't feel rushed. 
What I had was yummy! I had brown rice, salmon, tuna, crab, with sesame sauce, avocado, seaweed, etc. God knows what else I picked  but it was delish!!! My meal was less than 10.00
I've ordered from JA Burrito  and I paid almost 13.00 for a sushi bowl that barely had fish in it! Awful!

I ordered the regular size poke bowl.

The staff didn't seem to care about what they were making.
The fish was good, but the rice was so hard it stuck in my teeth.
I asked for my sauce on the side -soy sauce. She said that I could get it at the register. I asked the guy at the register and was given 2 packets. I asked for a few more and he got annoyed and actually asked me, ""You need more?"" Then he gave me 2 more like I had just robbed him.
So, I had to eat this big bowl of dry rice and fish with nothing but 4 little packs of soy sauce. 
The rice was so hard that I ended up throwing away what was left after eating the fish, since you know, I had nothing left to put on it.... and since I had worn out my welcome after requesting more than 2 packages of soy sauce, I wasn't about to ask for more.

The fish was good, I'm sure if you go, the rice will be fully cooked. If it is, you will probably enjoy your meal. But, if you want soy sauce on the side, good luck with that.

Everything combined made for an overall blah experience, but when you can't even cook the rice...

They have the necessary items to make a clean and consistent roll (bamboo) but don't bother to use them. I was a sushi chef so I am pretty knowledgeable on how rice should taste, the texture it should have, and how to roll it all up. 
For the same price as their ""regular"" size buritto I have got what I think they consider large at other establishments.

First visit I had the Diego bowl with spring mix greens + ramen combo.  The Diego bowl is basically hamachi + spicy tuna.  The sauce on the hamachi is a sweet shoyu sauce with masago and green onions to complete the poke.  A scoop of spicy tuna and we were off to the toppings.  I chose wakame (seaweed) salad, red onions, and fried sliced garlic.  Those garlic chips are so delicious!!  A small ramen was included in the combo.  Although I wasn't blown away by the ramen, I have to admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This combo is perfect for those of you who are on the hungrier side.

Second visit I went with a large Hamachi San bowl.  Similar to the Diego, this is a bowl with hamachi and spicy tuna.  Since I was pretty hungry, I opted for brown rice over spring mix greens this time.  To my Hamachi San, I added wakame salad, chili strips, red onion, garlic chips, jalapenos, and fried onions.  I was very satisfied after eating this.  There was a lot of fish to last the entire meal.  Sometimes you have leftover rice and no fish to eat it with, but not here.  Fish to the very end!!

Service: The staff was friendly, efficient in getting your poke bowl or sushi burrito right. 3 FTEs get you through the assembly line process quickly.  2 of them build your yummy poke creation with a cashier at the end.  Think Chipotle assembly for poke.

Food: You can order one of their pre-designed poke bowl or burrito creations or customize your own using their easy to follow menu in 4 steps: Pick your base, protein, sauce and topping.  Base and protein is easy its the sauce and additional toppings that really make this fun.  

This visit I created my own bowl: Unagi + Salmon + Kale salad + Chipotle Mayo + Creamy Jalapeno + Seaweed + Corn = Lovely

All ingredients are fresh and high quality.  I've paid for much more in restaurants with much less quality.  Amazing to find the quality here in a casual poke joint.  

Value:  Bowls and Burritos were at $9.50 with the combos at $12.50.  Once again, great price for the quality of ingredients.  This makes me smile

Ambiance: Plenty of seating for a franchise but I'll be ordering to go most of the time from here, because I'm always on the go.

My food was prepared properly many times before and am here often , like last night with a client was the last time.  however this time was different. the girl was not listening to me or even another co worker.  then i said yes to crab and i also wanted the salsa she told me it was a dollar. which was fine. then i said you forgot the crab. she didn't listen continued to roll it with no care of the rest of the stuff i wanted on it then rang me up No drinks no nothing. I told her she missed it she was like what not enough protein.  it didn't matter never asked what size nothing.  then when i asked to speak to the manager. i said she needs to listen and learn to take orders his response was not an apology it was ive seen her make it a hundred times she does it right.  wtf thanks as i told you after i paid the ten bucks you can keep it and handed it back to you. and didn't request a refund so you know how serious i was!

This was the first time I've eaten here and I wasn't sure on how things worked. Basically you can create your own or pick one of the ones that Sweet poke has created. I chose to make my own. So I picked salad as the base with 2 scoop salmon and 1 tuna with chipotle mayo. They put it into a bowl and mixed it all up then put it into my bowl then they added the spicy tuna on top. For the toppings I went a little conservative because I thought you could only pick 2 or 3 things ( my fault for not asking) but you can just pick whatever. They have so many options that this place will not get old for me.

Sauce is mostly what you taste so that was really a make it or break it for me. I added some yummy toppings which included some fried garlic. The toppings were great except for the garlic which was extremely hard to chew and in my opinion didn't fit in with any of the flavors. The service was pretty good.

I had a scoop of ahi, cooked unagi and yellow tail over a bed of greens of my choice.  That's 3 scoops, which is considered the large bowl and 2 scoops mix and match is the regular bowl.

Then on top of that I got spicy tuna, avocado, cilantro, ginger, seaweed salad, nori strips and whatnot until I was satisfied with filling my bowl at no extra cost.
The fish was fresh, the food was filling, prices are a little high, but we used a buy one get one half off deal to check out this new poke joint.  Solid if you're into all the fresh ingredients to doctor up the norm poke.  I stuck with a light drizzle of simple spicy ponzu as to not overwhelm by crazy bowl with more flavor.  

The next time, I think I'll need some brown rice with my poke and then mix some greens with it.  I was surprised, but they cooked by eel on the side to ensure it was nice and hot before laying those 3 pieces back in my bowl of creation.

Prior establishment was a burger joint, now revamped...  The ambiance is bare, but it's bright and open. When we first walked in and to my amazement I have the same dining chairs in our home.  I'm not sure if that's the compliment or not.  This place is clean, bright and offers fresh build your own poke. 

The large cooked burritos are wrapped in tortillas, but you can get the poke burritos that is wrapped in either seaweed or soy paper.  As I mentioned, lots of choices.  

I came, I liked, but not an everyday thing for me.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,1,2,4,TJ0FvHrqqlqCgHGkxUIqeA

SInce it was my first time I had some questions. The girl taking our order must have been new because she didn't know very much. She couldn't even explain the different sauces without having to ask someone else. I started with my seaweed wrapper with white rice and chose salmon and tuna for my two proteins. Sweet Poke has a large amount of both raw and cooked fish. You move on down the line to choose your toppings and sauce. 

They have many different veggie and fruit toppings as well as spicy crab or spicy tuna. Finally it is all wrapped up and cut for you. I really enjoyed looking at all the different Japanese drinks they offer, very unique. They also have macaron's and macaron ice cream sandwiches for dessert. 

The total was about $18 with our ""buy one, get one 50% off"" coupon. A very reasonable price for what you get. We sat inside at the small seating area. After my first couple bites the burrito started to fall apart and was hard to eat. The fish however was very fresh tasting and I loved all the flavors of the tuna, salmon, avocado and mango. I was happy with my first sushi burrito and would definitely return to try some different combinations. 

I did think it was strange its called ""Sweet Poke"", but they don't even have Poke as an option?? When I asked the girl if they had Poke she looked at me completely puzzled.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,3,3,4,Lt82wV5F68qzqjBCGCedYQ

The young man behind the counter helped me decide what to get and I ended up getting a Seattle bowl with raw salmon and it was delicious! The place was clean, the food was good and fresh, the staff was friendly and the price was good! Unlike most places, this place doesn't charge you extra for every single topping you get. I usually go to another local poké place but this will be my new spot! The food is as good as my personal usual place but the prices at Sweet Pokè are better!",WcmMeT_3fnjJniILAg7jHA,1,0,5,zH9OJN7xEeJNha1ZRN0Bjg
