Ten minutes later I'm picking up my lunch, anxious to bite into what I remember being one of the best meatball sammies ever. 

There was an odor coming from my bag. I shrugged it off. Must be the sauce. When I arrived at my office - which is literally across the intersection- and opened the box, it didn't look hot. The cheese wasn't fully melted; I could make out that it was shredded. The sauce didn't look heated up; it was chunky. The meatballs were on the colder side of room temp. I smelled & tasted garlic; where it was I'm not sure but it was too much for my liking. 

I'm disappointed. 

Having never been to the actual shop before today...it's small & cute. I noticed several crock pots with ladles in the kitchen I assumed were keeping the hot sammie contents hot. (Not sure what happened to mine because it wasn't close to hot.)

Everyone was nice & friendly. Huge chip selection. Pepsi products only, so if you're a Coke person like me, beware. Tables were clean. Kitchen was clean. 

Just wish my sammie was hot-I'm sure it would have been better than what it was and more fab like I remember it to be. I have half a sammie I'm not sure what to do with right now. It was loaded with meatballs too!

I ordered online. It's $1 delivery fee for across the intersection & a $10 min order. My sammie was $9.50 for a 12 inch. They serve breakfast too...mental note to try that one morning.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,1,0,3,0F8lZ5R-SZ1_DFFZAFE88A

862941,2013-02-01,0,n5bR03mFAvZSYvki9MeW7g,"Munch-A-Sub is the best sandwich shop I have tried in Las Vegas, hands down! I first heard about this place from some co-workers who absolutely raved about it. They had their sandwiches at some training they were at and couldn't quite remember the name. when I finally figured out the name I was totally stoked because it turns out Munch-A-Sub is right on the way to work. Sadly though, they close at 4PM and I get off work at 4PM.

So I got off early one day and stopped by and picked up a 12"" roast beef sub with all the fixin's. YEE HAA DADDY! The roast beef was that perfect rosy red medium rare with tons of yummy beefy flavor goodness.

Yesterday I got off early again and took the wife. We shared a 12"" corned beef with cheese and sauerkraut, ruebenish as they called it, that was a hit for both my wife and I. And she's a very picky sandwich eater. Meaning that she is picky about her sandwiches, not that she will only eat picky sandwiches.

The 12"" subs are run around $10, but are worth every penny of that. They are easily twice the sandwich on multiple levels than those of a national sandwich chain that shall remain nameless.

I can't fail to mention the owner and staff; wonderful! Welcoming, gracious, appreciative and helpful. 

We will be going back as often as timing allows",_8qu8GfnQCv0yae2i-OU5A,1,0,5,T2sX4m-Ctz3ig3LpgxTfyw

935116,2015-12-30,0,n5bR03mFAvZSYvki9MeW7g,"Everyone knows Vegas is a burger town. The pizza is mediocre and the subs are downright terrible. But I was in the mood for a cold sandwich and just happened to be in the industrial part of town and found Munch A Sub.

The reviews were good, so I stopped in and was pleasantly surprised by the very East Coast vibe the place was giving off. I ordered a sandwich with roast beef, turkey and ham, trying to recreate a classic I grew up with in south Florida. To my surprise, the sandwich was really great.

It all starts with the bread, which is exactly the type of hoagie roll that every sub shop should be using. It was soft on the inside, but perfectly structured on the outside. The meats were a good portion and weren't the typical store bought slices you see around town.

I also ordered a soup, Italian Wedding, which was a great thing to eat alongside a cold sub. One of the owners of the shop, who also took my order, was nice enough to even bring me a meatball for free so I could try it. Needless to say, I'll be ordering the meatball sub next time I'm there.

Overall, this was probably the best sub I've had in my 8 years in Vegas. The Butcher Block over on Rainbow also does subs that are really good, but every time I go there, they act annoyed at the thought of making a sub and it seems like they really only want to sell their meats.

The only real knock I can give Munch A Sub is that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke, but that's just a preference. Oil and red vinegar would also be cool to have out on the tables, but that's just me trying to recreate my favorite sub shop from back home.",BwoZMzp8iqeNFwGMhS25Dw,0,0,5,KyHi53VToEfVBNfadYfA6Q

The 12"" sub was plenty big and the bags of chips are a good size too.  I had the Italian sub and it was pretty good with fresh bread and good oil and vinaigrette.  So far so good.

I came back a second time, ordered the roast beef and it was not very good and pretty bland.  That wasn't the problem.  I could see right into the kitchen and one of the workers was eating a small piece of a sandwich while leaning over the bins.  If that wasn't bad enough, I saw her dip her finger into a sauce and lick her finger off then go back to making sandwiches.  Yuk!!!  Seriously???  

Well, I figured that that probably happens in a lot of places so I came back another day because I was in a hurry and the place is close to my office.  This time, I see the same woman back there eating potato chips.  Neither of the 2 women working there wore gloves.  I saw the other one grabbing handfuls of lettuce and tomato slices out of a bag with her bare hands and putting them in a bin.  The wear no gloves for anything.....  

I had the Italian sub again and it was covered with the vinaigrette - way too much - and a ton of pepper.  Very disappointed.  Between the hit or miss quality and disconcerting hygiene I don't think I will ever go back.",7vFTQ1Lk0kUUL8PNL8kLgA,4,1,1,-o6-GONklVuA2-EN82Sjig

1641790,2018-06-19,0,n5bR03mFAvZSYvki9MeW7g,"Awesome, just awesome. Likely the best 12"" cold-cut Italian sub I've had in so many years I can't even remember where that was. So when I ate here, it was sort of like traveling back in time!

When I walked through the door, the smell of the spices from the kitchen filled the whole space (and it's a small space) and it literally made my mouth start watering! I knew right then, before even looking at the menu, that I was in for a real treat.

The sub was gargantuan, a very generous portion of cold cuts, brimming with tomatoes and lettuce and such. And the bread, heavenly tasty, way beyond what is typical found embracing such a sub. The side of potato salad was also very good. Plus a small drink, came in at $10 before tax. The sub menu has plenty of choices, something to please anyone. They also serve several traditional spins on pasta&meat: spaghetti&meatballs, penne&sausage, you know the drill.

Again, it's a pretty small space. Partly of the expected Italian décor, only a light touch of the expected red & white motif. There's some vintage Vegas a bit of Manhattan on the walls that, I expect, speaks to the nostalgia, perhaps the history, of the owners. 

Being of sharp business mind, I was also impressed with the business strategy of these owners. This restaurant is buried deep inside a large industrial zone ... I only stumbled in here because I was having some of my custom auto lighting worked on up the street (at 12 Volt Solutions) ... and I didn't see any dining competition anywhere in the neighborhood. A monopoly, sweet. And they deliver, demand for which I expect is constant. And, in harmony with the workforce that surrounds the place, it's open for breakfast at 7, lunch at 11 and dark at 3pm.

A virtual monopoly, superlative product priced as good value, and short working hours to boot - now THERE'S an enviable business strategy. 

Not on any main drag, but not too far from one ... and not hard to find. On West Tropicana, near The Orleans, turn south onto Cameron. Then about a half-mile on the left.

The #43 is a roast beef and turkey combo, with super-fresh bread and an ample amount of meat. My only gripe is that I added provolone and didn't receive it, so maybe this isn't the best place for customized orders.

Was in the area and did a search of places close by to eat for lunch and this place turned up only 1 mile away. This is one of those places that are located in a business type/plaza setting. Parking is adequate and there are just enough tables and chairs inside to seat about 15 people.

What I got was the 12 inch Philly Sub ($9.25). Has roast beef, melted provolone, mushrooms, onions, and special seasoning. I thought it was kind of weird that they used roast beef for the meat when it should be thinly sliced sirloin. In any case it was very good. They really load up on the meat and the bread was def the kind that you would get in Philly.

For a complete meal which includes chips and a drink will come out to 12 bucks and change. Kind of pricey but after eating the sandwich I was so full that I almost didn't eat dinner later on that night.

Some notables. Since they are in this business/plaza type setting they are only open Monday through Friday. On the Yelp listing the hours are 9 am to 4 pm. On their website it says 7 am to 3 pm. Im assuming the website is more correct because they are serving breakfast now. I recommend that you call first if you are bordering on these times.

In closing, this is a pretty good place to eat a nice sized sandwich. Just don't expect to come here for dinner.

They had a corned beef footlong with a large soda for $9.50 as a special of the day. I ordered it and like previously said stated by others, the sandwiches are 12"" and stuffed with meat. Now down to the taste. The corned beef sandwich I had was decent at best. It wasn't as salty as I've had or prefer. But It did make me full. It wasn't bad, I'm just a little picky when it comes to corned beef and pastrami.

Bread was pretty good but they didn't do anything to it. I like the bread thrown on the flaptop with a little butter.  The meatball themselves were decent with nice texture and flavor but they needed to put enough sauce on it.  They sprinkled a little mozzarella on it.  I wish they put it under the salamander or broiler and a little parmesan would have been nice.

The moment you walk in, you are instantly greeted by beautiful smiles from all the ladies that work there. The shop itself is small, quaint, and actually quite perfect, They offer an array of subs, sandwiches and  salads and prepared with a fantastic attitude!

I ordered a hot Roast Beef sub sans the onions. Served on a soft luscious bread, so soft it makes me want to sleep on it. The roast beef comes in heaping amounts followed by generous servings of mushroom and provolone. I can only assume if ordered with onions you'd get no less of a treatment. 

As I take my first bite, the juices from the roast beef come oozing out with an insane amount of italian flavor. The big chucks of mushroom add just the right amount of texture followed by the creaminess of the provolone. 

Also the sub doesn't remind me much of New York City--it did satisfy every bit of craving I've been having.

Pretty much the only time you'll be around this place is... never. I mean it's tucked away in a industrial area that's directly behind the Delano. I only found the place because I left a meeting starving and Yelped, ""Random Sandwich"". Yelpers know, whenever you Yelp any type of food item and you're near the strip you either get chain locations or a fine dining restaurants where a salad cost $23.

Munch-A-Sub is very underwhelming from the outside, but when you walk-in the bright colors and the ""NY look"" perk up your taste buds. The menu is filled with salads, sammies, and a few pasta dishes. l was a little nervous to order pasta in a place like this so I went with the classic lunch. Pastrami on Wheat. 

This thing was a monster, tons of veggies, heavy handed on the pastrami, and just the right amount of mustard. I ordered the twelve-inch sandwich and it was more than enough. If you do happen to head here, I recommend the six-inch, because this was a lot food. 

The service here is basic and the food arrived promptly. A few things that bothered me: The bathroom, it's located in the back, through the kitchen, behind the prep table, and once you're in you realize it's also the storage closet. The Price, my sandwich with a bottled water cost $14 w/ tip, dayum. A little too rich for my blood when it comes to deli style sandwiches settings. 

Not my first choice, but if you're near the Middle Earth of Las Vegas pop-in and spread some local love.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,10,6,3,FrE9eSRcncZo1Q_68IOlMg

And since I ordered a sub yesterday for lunch, only ate half, I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Like, woke up this morning craving the other half of the sandwich good. 

So for lunch I was looking for a sandwich but I'm generally unimpressed by Port of Subs which is the closest sandwich shop to me. Thanks to Yelp, I spent some time researching the number of sandwich shops within a 5 mile radius. Narrowing it down to two choices, Munch a Sub won, mostly because of the Yelp photos and the name. It's a good name. Oh, and you can pre-order online. Personally I think preordering food is 2016's greatest gift to us.

Anyhoo, I preordered a meat & cheese sub with banana peppers. By the time I got there it was ready. This is great compared to some other lunch places nearby that really do want 30 minutes to make my food. I don't understand how that's helpful, I get like 30 minutes for lunch and I can't waste it waiting on someone to get through a line of people to make my food. Some places just don't understand pre-ordering. So I get to Munch a Sub and I notice it is almost a hole in the wall. People are right, there are probably enough chairs & tables to cater to the die hard, must eat in the place, patrons. I am not one of them.

I work in the area and had gone into Munch A Sub a couple years back for lunch. The sandwich I had then was good, and the guy working was really nice... But Vegas is a city with many options for lunch, so I didn't go back for a while... Actually, I kind of forgot it even existed... 

Some of my coworkers started getting lunch delivered by Munch A Sub, and they left a menu in the break area. I noticed that the selection of food offered had dramatically increased since I had eaten there, so I saved the menu...

From time to time my boss likes to treat his staff with breakfast, and therefore we are always on the lookout for a new place to try. I remembered Munch A Sub had expanded their menu so we decided to get breakfast sandwiches from them. The sandwiches come on either an english muffin or a croissant (higher price for the later), choice of breakfast meat, and cheese. 

Damn these are some good breakfast sandwiches! I split one with a coworker because the croissants are on the large size, and I am trying to watch my figure. It was still plenty of food for both of us... And according to my boss, it's the best breakfast sandwich he has ever had!

Their motto is ""the best kept secret in town"" and I understand why. They're located in a convenient but out-a-the-way small business district that you could drive by for years without noticing. They're also only open for the local business crowd but believe me, it's worth searching them out.  
They are the antithesis of the crappy corporate sandwich chains. 
Yes... Some chains bake their own bread, but not like this. This is real home made bread. It has flavor, it had body, it has a great chewy crust. 
These people know what a great sandwich should consist of. 

They do all the usuals, only better than you've ever had em before, and they do others like Italian sausage or meat ball mix, and the best meatloaf sandwich that equals my own mothers. They make a calzone that's pretty incredible. Their French dip with au jus.... Heck, they're all good.

Also I've never had Tostitos salsa verde chips in snack size so those being available was just wonderful! Love this place officially, anytime I'm down in this neighborhood I'll be back.",dmKQFAo8RINXt4kdbMEMEg,0,0,5,KSVKH5XHhXG1foK0ms0DKQ

Friendly counter service and food quality was very good, with freshest bread and generous portions.  I have a feeling if you wanted something special they would accommodate your cravings, providing they had the ingredients.
Many thanks to my friend Ray for the invite and turning me on to a classic sub shop that offers so much more!

My husband ordered the Italian which is absolutely delicious and I ordered a chicken cordon bleu and was surprised with cheddar cheese instead of Swiss and it was amazing! Their bread is fresh and fluffy! We've been looking for our go to sub shop in Vegas and so far nothing has compared to the quality of service or food that we've received here!

I requested a 12"" sub in a sour dough and Stepahnie called me very quick to let me know the consequences of having my sub in a sour dough since I added a bunch of things to it, so I changed the bread to the white sub.
The sandwich was awesome and it was just as I expected it except that it was a 6"" sub, for which I called back and they explained that when I made the bread switch it reset back to a standard 6"", but Stephanie didn't hesitate to send the other half within minutes of the initial delivery, which was an awesome gesture of hers.
The delivery arrived sooner than expected so I'm very pleased fort that as well.
The reason I'm giving a 4 start eating is due to the food itself. Although it has an awesome presentation the taste is very ordinary, good enough to calm one's  hunger but nothing out of this world; the potato salad however was a bit old, the potatoes were rubbery and tasted weird, not spoiled just funny due to the age I suppose.
Price is good as well, can't complain for that, I would just suggest putting more flavor to the food.
Will definitely come back due to the awesome service, but will stick to the subs only.",kx_U9ZmF--Ef7hMj2gMqdw,1,0,4,3M3VCB74fGN4uQQ2gt1HKg

The staff was super friendly and nice and knowledgeable and help us with our right choice of sandwich we were looking for.

Pretty much the reason I never go to Subway because I feel like I get jipped with only two turkey slices on my sandwhich, but I digress. I got the chicken salad on a sub roll. Delicious chicken salad. Literally THE BEST chicken salad I have had in my life. The bread wasn't that great, but I'm partial to wheat. It was also soggy, but I waited a good 20 minutes to eat it. Next time I'm definitely just gonna grab a seat and eat there to avoid the soggy bread. I'm telling you though I grabbed a fork and just ate the chicken salad right off the bread. It's a little pricier than your standard sub chain, but keep in mind their gonna give you a heaping helping of meat. You can tell that the owners really care about their business and customers too. Very polite speedy service. If you're looking for a $5 foot long this isn't your place, but if you want to support local business and get a yummy lunch look no further!",Yvj5Hws7hkHriZZuxsjQcg,2,1,4,LwNTdB0KO7qJ6Jskzd23Pw

If you are accustomed to East coast style subs that are filled with quality ingredients on great bread... This is your place. Where the other sub shops (looking at you Capri...) have a lot of bread and not much inside... This place piles it on. 

My favorite by far is the Roast Beef #29. Their marinated mushrooms they put on it are unbelievable. 

Really cool family ownership. Just wish I didn't have to drive in the middle of an industrial park I don't work in to get it.",u9s3pSpJAUD1ME6PI7ZEVA,4,1,5,N3BOvVt7RmP9PrJlDxc0FQ

This is in the middle of nowhere surrounded by businesses you don't typically go to, but the sandwiches are really really good.  A tad bit expensive, but worth it in my opinion.  My favorite is the 4b (I get the large, so it's $10 instead of $9.25 for a regular with a drink).  It's a meatball sub with marinara and bacon.  I also got a breakfast burrito here once (their salsa was great in it), and I couldn't eat the rest of the day.  

One warning: there is a $1 surcharge for credit/debit cards.",54ANhcwkZm0zK-bEuEfnpw,2,0,5,7Z_zy6fVyp4niiO0YrPRDA

What I am honestly a fan of is their breakfast menu. They offer good food at reasonable rates. The English muffin sausage with cheese is huge and the sausage is King of that meal. 

Whether you want to walk in or have delivery this place is a must. It is good, fresh and tasty food.

You can't go wrong with their roast beef sandwich, one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches. They have like 30 options to chose from when it comes to their lunch menu.
