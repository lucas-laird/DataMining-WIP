The kid was nice to me, but just decided to stare down my shirt as I leaned over the counter, so freaking rude. So after that we waited about 10 minutes to get our food, and even though it's fast food I really don't mind waiting for good food, but when we asked for ranch for my wings they said it was 42 cents... I said nevermind. And when I got my wings I opened the box and they where small, and no sauce on them. I started to eat them and they where really soggy. Like they had been sitting out at least for 3-6 hours and then they put them in a microwave. GROSS!! And then I looked on the receipt and it said you only get one ounce of sauce! Cheap!! So my boyfriend decided to get 2 for $6 burger and a chicken sandwich. And he just says they where nasty. He did tell me that the little cheese bites that where in the burger and chicken sandwich... he says they tasted like fake cheese and they where a bit rubbery! Cooking 101... a microwave it's used for cooking!! This place needs to be shut down! There fries where okay, but I would have rather gone somewhere else.

Wendy's, Mc Donald's, and Burger King. Compared to those three
chains it rates a one star because it does NOT stand out in any
facet of the fast food competitive environment. Checker's lacks
top locations, the inside seating is small, the food is merely OK,
yet prices are higher than at those three chains. If Checker's was
in Haiti, or today's Venezuela, it would rate 4 or 5 stars in those
countries. But, IMO, in the USA Checker's is below average. If
you are starving and you pass a Checker's you won't die if you
buy a burger there...but if your stomach's growling can be held
in check 5 minutes longer then find Mc D, Wendy's or B.K.",MPlMQddB2VlkpE7DtxJh9Q,1,0,1,6qthuDGzNS7ExHOVYyrOqw

1098549,2015-01-05,0,PbNKg8t_VNKzxPKydtkFDg,"I had high hopes for this place. When I learned that they were building one (at this location), I was incredibly stoked because (previously) they only had 1 on Boulder/Lamb and that was way to far for me to drive.

This would be the first time I have been able to eat frequently at a Checkers since I moved to Las Vegas from Georgia 10 years ago.

Unfortunately, there are just too many flaws with this place for me to overlook, and here they are:

(1) The cooks can't tell the difference between sandwiches: I ordered a Big Chicken Deluxe... the only difference between the 'Deluxe' and the regular Big Chicken sandwich is that the deluxe comes with a tomato and cheese. ON 2 OCCASIONS IN A ROW they forgot to add the tomato and cheese. I had to bring it back to the counter and explain it to them. The SAME staff prepared it both times... so apparently they don't learn their lesson nor do they care.

(2) Pricing and menu layout is inaccurate and incredibly confusing. They have a HUGE sign on the OUTSIDE window stating that the ""Big Chicken Deluxe"" is 2-for-$6 yet on the menu (at the top) inside the building, it says it's 2-for-$5 ... I pointed this out to the cashier and she did nothing to get this corrected. So, I ended up paying MORE than what the menu says.

(3) For some strange reason, they make EVERYTHING available except napkins. Keep in mind this is really greasy food, so you're going to need some napkins. But, if you want napkins you have to go out of your way to ask them for some because they don't have the foresight",XlW0fpO5JN2CxKswMoiT2A,1,1,1,1zHYNz7FdfO1VAwdQmVriQ

They were having burger and sandwich specials for every budget, 2 for $3 and 2 for $5 mix and match.  I went with the 2 for $5 with the Bacon double burger and the Chicken Sandwich on sourdough.  This place seems to be a blend of Jack in the Box and Arby's.  

My Chicken sandwich was over microwaved because the edges were so hard.  The Bacon burger tasted very salty maybe from the type of bacon used.  Bacon also very dry and crumbly.  

This business should focus on product quality late night instead of speed.  If they took a few extra moments to improve the final product and ensuring things were fresh they could be busier.

I visit checkers very often as it is close to my home and usually quite satisfying. However last night was probably my last time. I always order the half pound chicken box meal with BBQ sauce. My first frustration was being stuck in line for 30 minutes with employees that didn't seem to know what they were doing. 

The only friendly person i saw was the girl that gave me my soda at the window. When I got home BBQ sauce was poured all over my chicken inside the box which blew me away. I was instantly disgusted because being fast food this is not okay and highly unexpected seeing I order here frequently. The BBQ sauce was even different and not the normal sauce they hand out. Already being frustrated I called the restaurant and the person answered HELLO.... after seconds of pausing thinking i called the wrong number the person says and I quote, ""What would you like to order?"" It gets worse. I asked for the manager and the gentleman states to me that the manager doesn't speak very good English. Again blown away, how can you manage a facility and speak little to no English being a primarily English establishment. 

I went into detail as to what was wrong with my order and the employee stated to me that the staff must of been lazy as to why sauce was in my chicken box. With confusion I told him I always order the same thing and this has never happened, why has it happened now. He said he didn't know.

I was originally going to go to McDonald's because the service is fast, food tastes good and the prices are clearly displayed.  However my buddy suggested Checker's instead. My lunch at Checkers turned out to be a disaster.   We went into the restaurant and there were no customers waiting. I thought to myself, this should be nice and easy.  Both my friend and I ordered the Spicy chicken combo.  While we were waiting for the food, my friend noticed a sign that said 4 items for $3.  We asked the guy at the register about why we were charged higher and he said that we ordered the chicken combo off the menu board. I asked well what the heck did we order that was different from the special and he said that it was the same chicken but because we didn't specifically state that we wanted the special, we couldn't get it.  I then told him that I want to cancel my order and get a refund so I can order the special.  For 18 minutes, no joke, we were going back and forth with this guy trying to get a refund. He eventually and reluctantly gave us a refund.  Meanwhile, our food was sitting on the counter behind the register the entire time we were arguing. The food of course was colder than Antarctica by the time we got it.  I filled out the survey online when I got home that night and asked to be contacted by someone in management. Today, it 's 02/17/17 and I still have not received a call from anyone.

The reason for the 4 star reduction is because of napkins and 3 stars because of the really crappy engineered drive through. Its the thinnest drive thru we have ever driven through. we made a wide right hand turn from the pick up window and still scraped our rim. Ok so I thought maybe we are just somewhat retarded and decided to eat our food in the car and watch other cars and how they navigate what I felt was crappy design. It took us 15 minutes to eat our food and in that time frame we counted 22 cars, 14 of them being Suvs out of the 14 suvs 9 of them hit the curb or ran over it. The other 8 vehicles 3 hit the curb. 

I would never ever recommend this place to anyone especially anyone who cares about their cars. If someone from Checkers reads this, I really think you guys need to redesign that drive thru.",5GKyq26mStA4bfjakyfzsg,3,0,1,wzXn8dIkLUnWHFGBRgwWRw

On my visit it was dinner time and there were about 8 people seated. The decor of the restaurant is kind of a 50's retro. The menu has a large selection of burgers and chicken and from reading the advertisements they are very proud of their fries.

Ordered the ""Big Buford"". It is a double burger that comes with American Cheese, pickles, red onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mayonnaise and ketchup. The produce was really crisp and fresh. The cheese was not melted on the burger which suggests it was put together to order and hadn't been assembled prior to my order. The warmth of the beef eventually melted my cheese. The bun was fantastic for a fast food bun. The bun had a kaiser like consistency and was a step above the normal sesame seed standard. The burger had a nice seasoning.

The fries were different from most chains I have visited. They had a batter that gave them a nice crunch and the seasoning had a peppery note. Good flavor and I appreciated the effort. 

The meal was super cheap and filling and I was satisfied. Please take my four star with a grain of salt. I am measuring this place with other fast food chains in its market (Carl's Jr., Jack in the Box, McDonald's etc. ) and I think it is a step above.
