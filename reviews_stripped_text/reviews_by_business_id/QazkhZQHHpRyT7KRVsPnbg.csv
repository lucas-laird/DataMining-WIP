535836,2016-05-05,0,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,"LESSON LEARNED: NEVER START A TAB!

I went to Mulligans Landing for the first time to meet some friends on Karaoke night. The place was clean and lively, and besides the karaoke, there were two pool tables and an electronic dart board. I ordered a beer and gave the female bartender my debit card to hold for my ""tab."" About halfway through my beer I noticed they had a shift change and my bartender had gone home.

My friends and I had a great time playing a crazy team dart game while people sang. I ordered another beer and shot a game of pool. Pretty fun night overall.

When it was time to go home I asked for my bill. The dude behind the bar went to cash me out but the register needed receipt paper. He went through four rolls and five minutes until he managed to print my bill. Instead of the normal printout where I can write in a tip, he handed me a receipt for $15.50. I asked why and he mumbled something about it being the computer's fault. I thought the amount was high for two beers and I was right, there were two shots of Captain Morgan on my bill!

I told the bartender I only had two beers and he said: ""The girl in the shirt with musical notes all over it said to put those on your tab."" She was one of my friends who had left a few minutes earlier. I thought he must have just misunderstood her because she would never do that, so I would just settle with her the next day at work.

It turns out that she doesn't drink Captain Morgan, and neither does any of my other friends that were there. So I figured it was just an honest mixup and I learned my lesson to pay as I go with cash only...then I got the final charges on my card and and it was $20.50! That's exactly $5.00 more than my receipt! That is intentional over-billing.

So instead of paying $7.00 plus tip for two beers, I ended up paying $20.50. That's almost three times what I should have paid! I'm glad I didn't have $70 worth of drinks because by their math I would have ended up paying $205!

So, what I thought were ""accidental"" billing errors was really deliberate over-billing. And it's a shame, because I had a good time and was planning on returning regularly. NEVER AGAIN.",QRaa2kpfD0PYHL7oIiRHkw,5,1,1,iKZIRKkKC19-hP5vxs1Jpg
574416,2012-12-05,0,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,"My girl and I headed here to enjoy a mellow night out while visiting in Vegas.  I was weary when I saw the karaoke set, lifting an eyebrow and giving my friend a sideways look.  Then the music started in, as what I thought was the juke box.  NO WAAAY, that guy is singing live?!?  There were a few bad apples, but for the most part it was truly entertaining.  Bartender needed a little teaching on how to make a manhattan (guess no one orders them in Vegas, he had never made one!) but all in all a good place.  The second bartender made a nice old fashioned...yes I was in a classic and classy whiskey girl mode.  I loooove the old airplane them to bar, fun and playful decor!  I would visit again for a mellow non strip kinda night.",m7ZZYDT24BNieJB_Nll0iw,1,0,4,9d_BCrYzoUK6e4ZQHt1OEw
863671,2016-02-15,0,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,Didn't even get a chance to see whether this place was a good chill spot or not because I was treated very poorly by an employee upon entrance. It was about 10pm and my colleague and I were looking for a beer and some dinner and decided Mulligans sounded like a good place to go. The door was locked and we thought it might be closed until we saw a doorbell. We rang the doorbell and heard a buzz so we attempted to open the door and it was still locked. So we tried opening the door several times as we heard a buzz constantly going off as if it might even be broken. We heard a woman inside yelling something about the door and tried again. Still locked. Finally the door opened by a Mulligans employee yelling at us that the door was open as we insisted it was locked and we continued to try and open the door. She put her handheld buzz device up showing us how she used it to unlock the door and we explained that we tried however the door was still locked. She was extremely rude and clearly very angry with us that we didn't walk into a locked door. I will never go back here again for the way we were treated and I hope this employee is aware of her terrible service and that attention is brought towards her behavior towards paying customers. She had blonde hair about mid length and a bad attitude. We ended up going to another bar grill and I tipped graciously for the kindness and wonderful service that Mulligans did not provide from the minute upon entrance.,z92jqGbEEtmW5pTRauSzog,3,1,1,Y-q0SZ4SL_psjQFcUIvibg

When you build a relationship with a bartender another comes in to replace. So unfortunately the new doesn't know I'm a regular. Tonight when I went I was ask to moving from the machine so gamblers can have them. I'm just as much of a paying customer then a gambler. So my husband and I left early where I was expecting to spend the evening watching kareoke and ordering more drinks. I'm sadden by this and will not be coming back.,-tkF9tLShT5t4xsFf6xCEw,0,0,2,UL7tdZB9nV5BuzHDs4pkZg
2069233,2010-06-27,0,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,"Mulligan's Landing; sounds familiar huh? That's because I did a review for Mulligan's Border just a couple of weeks ago and touted it as my ""Cheers"" bar because we go there so often and everyone knows our names. Well this isn't our ""Cheers"" Mulligan's but it is owned by the same people, but with a twist. The bar is run by the people that run our Mulligan's, however; the grill end is run by Wholesome Foods of Las Vegas. (http://www.wholesomefoodslasvegas.com) That throws a bit of a spin on the review because now the review may be for Mulligan's Landing but it's really for the room run by Wholesome Foods. Get it? Yeah I know, weird, but these kinds of cooperative business arrangements happen more often than you may think in Las Vegas.

So here is the skinny... Wholesome Foods is a boxed lunch caterer, therefore the food served at this restaurant is their boxed lunch on a plate. The good news... the food is awesome. My wife and I were only looking for a quick Iced Tea but when we browsed the menu for S&Gs and noticed Chicken Quesadillas and ordered up the appetizer. We were waited on by the chef (yes chef, from Le Cordon Bleu no less as displayed on his chefs coat) and got to talking and we decided to try the Shaved Roast Beef Sandwich with a creamy slaw. The food was as advertised and pretty darn good. Good use of spice in the quesadillas gave them some zip and the Pico was fresh. The Roast Beef was very tasty and tasted confit if a bit salty. The slaw on the other hand was great. It was cream with a bit of what has to be champagne vinegar to give it a nice zing.

The d√©cor was ""Areo"" inspired because it is right across from the NLV Airport. You get the feeling that back in the day this had to be a favored hangout of pilots and crews in the aviation biz.

In the past this establishment has suffered from mismanagement apparently but you have the feeling that the staff is trying hard to correct that. Service what very good and the people in the place seemed happy.

This will not be a hangout spot for me but if I am in the area and looking for a bite, this place is added to the spots that I like.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,3,1,3,RCLL4eWse1V_459OUnAU2A

2276918,2012-09-20,2,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,Mulligans is Iceacholics spot every Wednesday nights. To be honest not the food come for every week but hanging out with the boys and two of the coolest bartenders EVER Heather and Ron. They do close the kitchen down early so by the time we get there too late. The inside really nothing much there couple bar games dartboard or boxing punching game. They do have karoake nights and comedy nights certain days of the week. Small bar nothing special but the people that work there make it special. SHOUT out too Heather and Ron. If your looking for little dive bar have some drinks with friends in the area. Great choice! =))),iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,4,4,l5x8Yb4NvrhqrTNeMf7CXg

5228010,2017-02-04,2,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,"I'm really surprised that I haven't written a review for Mulligan's Landing yet.  I've been here on several Friday nights for Karate Karaoke over the last few months. 

The first time I was here, last summer, I wasn't impressed, but I think it had more to do with the crowd.  

New management has taken over Mulligans as of November, and things have improved, in my opinion.
The last 3 times I've been out for karaoke have been super fun.  The drinks are pretty cheap here, although to be honest, I don't really remember prices...they're cheaper than a lot of other karaoke spots, that's for sure.  

Karaoke here is awesome.  Unlike some other bars, they can play the music loud, and they have a great selection.  I love singing here.  They've actually just built a booth for the karaoke host, so the singer gets the whole stage!  Nice improvement, especially for a wanna be diva like me. 

So, a few days ago, a friend messaged me to ask if I'd tried the food here at Mulligans yet.  

Food?  I thought all they had was fries...so, for a Friday afternoon/night date night, my husband and I popped over.  

Tiffany and Skye were behind the bar, and they were friendly, funny, and prompt with service.  Two Shocktops with orange at...$3.25 or $3.50 a piece isn't bad at all.  After we'd ordered, I noticed that they have Kilt Lifter for under $5!!!  I'm getting one of those next time!

We took a peek at the brand new menu, and on Skye's recommendation, ordered the Loco Burger.  I also ordered the fried mac n cheese balls. 

Food came out pretty quickly, and it was REALLY good....for being bar food, it was exceptional.  

The Loco Burger:  caramelized onions, bacon, green peppers, mushrooms, and a 1/2 burger patty in a fried tortilla shell, served with an AMAZING cheese sauce, pesto aioli, and sour cream on the side.  This normally comes with guacamole, too, but I'm allergic, so they left it off.  

This was incredible.  The burger was well seasoned, and cooked perfectly.  All of the toppings were delicious.  The cheese sauce is made from scratch, not canned or bottled.  This is not a meal for the faint of heart:  its rich, and HUGE.  Recommended to split with someone.  Its a LOT of food, but really delicious. 

The Fried mac and cheese balls were awesome too.  Bits of bacon and jalapeno gave it a great flavor, and the inside was creamy and yummy.  Really enjoyed these a lot, but probably wouldn't order these two items together again.  Rich food upon rich food...it was a bit much.  They're excellent, but not a good pairing together.  Lesson learned.  

Had the opportunity to chat with chef Ralph, who proudly let us know that EVERYTHING in his kitchen besides the french fries are all made fresh every day.  This scores extra points with me.  Nothing beats fresh ingredients.  

I really liked Mulligan's Landing a lot before.  The bar staff is nice, and pretty prompt.  They have karaoke on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and now a brand new menu.  I don't go out much these days anymore, but I will most definitely be making it a point to come out a lot more often.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,5,3,4,VIQytO5LHtrMbiIXTmESUw
5835449,2011-06-25,0,QazkhZQHHpRyT7KRVsPnbg,"Mulligans is my main Monday night squeeze. 

They host a weekly comedy open mic every Monday at 10PMish that I've been frequenting since December of last year, when my ""comedy thang"" began -- I go to comedy open mics at least twice a week, if not more. I don't even perform, I just like going. Some of the comedians are cool people, and some of them are good comedians ;) But it's always a good time.

It's one of those bars where the employees hang out there on their days off. ALWAYS a good sign. Happy employees make happy customers. On top of comedy, they also host karaoke on weekends and have a gang of regulars who come out. It's almost like Cheers - very nice bartenders. Although some of them can be a bit absent minded at times and you may have to flag them down for a drink, they'll be smiling when they get to you. I'm assuming it's a friendly smile and not a ""mwahaha I made you wait"" smirk, but who really knows - or even cares when they have good, cheap drinks. 

They lose one star because their kitchen closes early, around 10pm. :( We're spoiled when it comes to Las Vegas bar food - I get that. But with pubs like PT's and The Lodge in the area that have 24 hour kitchens, Mulligan's should at least consider that on nights they have events like comedy, they'd benefit from keeping it open until at least midnight or one.

Check it out if you're in the area on a Monday, or Friday/Saturday night :) Be prepared for good times and leave your frown at home!",I2uNXg4uOhZyPq-a3FmLsg,0,2,4,knQ6ZFkNb64FjWo0otr86A
