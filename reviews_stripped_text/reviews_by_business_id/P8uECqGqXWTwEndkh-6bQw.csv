38712,2013-01-11,4,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"My time these days doesn't really allow for writing many Yelp reviews anymore, but I had to chime in with a four star review for a solid Las Vegas spot.

Unfortunately it seems that anytime Fieri stops by, the idiot reviewers come out of the woodwork. That's really the case here on Yelp, so let's clarify some things:

1) Yes, the restaurant is in Moondoggies, a bit of a dive bar.  That's mentioned ahead of time in all the press, so you're lame if you're going to ding them a star because you had to get a babysitter or you didn't like the vibe. The rest of us enjoy the booze, the Bills (not really, but you get the point) and the surroundings.

2) Yes, the suicide sauce (and fries, I assume) are spicy! I'm not really sure how one would think otherwise. Go to Tex Wasabis if you wan't faux tasting food. 

3) Yes, this place is serving up a Buffalo-style pie. It boggles the mind how people just come in and say ""not very good pizza"" without more because they have no respect for the different types of pizzas one can get.

Alright, now that's all out of the way, so what'd we get that made me rant and rave so happily?

Stinger pizza - Absolutely delicious. One problem with Vegas eateries is that places often try to be trendy by throwing gut-busting ingredients into a dish without any conception for how they go together or how they leave you feeling. The buffalo chicken, steak, peppers and cheese on this dish seem like they'd have that problem (and might, if you eat the whole pie) but a slice on its own has an awesome flavor profile.

Royal sandwich - Simple, tasty and done right. Makes me miss their sandwich shop back when it was downtown. 

If you like great food and know you're okay with a certain vibe, go...you won't regret it. If you don't, that's fine too...but don't write an unfair review of a place as a result.",C1_AvND8ApbjfZlKbtbbEA,6,3,4,o62IgdMF882T4RqPEORm9w

To my astonishment the customer service was subpar, and both the staff and environment seemed a bit culturally bias.  The Guinea's Pie was amazing!!! Though I prayed and hoped that my food wasn't tampered with during my visit.  However, I've never been in a restaurant establishment in this millennium, where I was treated like a ""colored"" person in the south during the Civil Right era in the 1960's, not only was I treated like an outcast due to my skin color/orientation, but racist paraphernalia befouling our nation's president laced the walls of the establishment.  

At this point I'm unsure as a consumer if I should trust the Food Networks, Diners, Drive-In's and Dives television show or suggest that other foodies partake in visiting establishments featured on the show if the quality of service and environment is such as Naked City Pizza Shop.

All of them were delicious but the Guinea pie was the best.

For appetizers, the suicide fries are only for the brave of heart. I love them but my boyfriend would not even try them. They are hot! The garlic buns are like cinnamon rolls but with no cinnamon and add garlic and cheese...aka awesome.

Finally the location, I personally love that this place in in a dive bar! It a not that scary like other reviews have said. I thought it was awesome. The service is ok. I have had great service and ok service but the food is worth any experience.

I'm originally from Buffalo, NY (home of awesome hockey and football and amazing wings!) and it's so hard to find pizza and wings that are actually good outside of the Buffalo area! There's NY style pizza, Chicago style pizza, real Italian pizza and then somewhere in the middle is Buffalo style pizza. Bubbly doughy crust, sauce that's not to acidic and not too sweet, the perfect ammount of nice molten cheese and little pepperonis that curl up and get nice and crispy. You can't get it outside of Buffalo unless you are from the 716, move and then open a shop. And that's exactly what happened! Saw this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives after just moving to Vegas and I hightailed it to this dive bar with the best pizza and wings west of Buffalo. It's really the ONLY place to get good wings. And probably the only place outside of Buffalo you can get a chicken finger sub (which is the best of both worlds!)! They have Loganberry (a HUGE hit with me!) and make inhouse blue cheese sauce. As long as we are stationed here, I will be going there for my pizza!

Once you enter, there is a small window where you place your order. I ordered the first pizza on the specialty pies list, called The Stinger. Each bite was a different combination of delicious flavors, from the crispy chicken tenders, spicy peppers, melted cheese, and fresh, piping-hot steak. Needless to say, I dream about this pizza when we're not together. The sides are great and perfect for both a pizza restaurant and a bar. Had the poutine fries, and if you've never had them, they are as weirdly delicious as you think they'd be.

Service is standard. I've never had a bad experience, and though its never been exceptional either, I don't mind it. You really don't get attentive service here, but remember, you just ordered this pizza from a small window inside a bar on Arville. The product is the star here, and they have something beautiful.

So, if you have seen Diners, Drive- Ins and Dives then you've heard of this Dives mythical existence.  If you blink you will miss this pizza bar as it is disguised as a plethora of places that have nothing to do with pizza. There is a 2nd hurdle being the point of entrance hidden as something of a speakeasy. Being the adamant foodie extraordinaire that I am, I defeated the resistance & entered the dark, smokey cave. 

Rapid fire 1st impression:
- A dozen compressed bar stool cushions beneath the cheeks of replicated ""Norm's"" & ""Woody's"".
- Bartender smoking a cig. (no extra charge)
- Red solo cups for anything N/A.
- Food orders are placed thru a small window reminiscent of a roach coach.
- Nobody other than fellow treasure hunters acknowledge your existence. 
- Sanitation? Questionable.

With all that said, the pizza was worthy of reoccurring business & the garlic fries were average. Spoken camaraderie with fellow dining patrons made this experience all the better.

547049,2011-12-25,1,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"I heard they had poutine here, and I had to check it out for myself. Moon Doggies has a great atmosphere and good energy. I ordered the poutine to go, and they were clever, keeping the gravy separate from the fries and cheese, so the fries wouldn't get soggy as I drove home.

Now, the only downside I can give is that they used shredded mozzarella cheese, instead of cheese curds, so when I dumped the gravy, the cheese became one big layer of melted cheese, instead of mixing with the fries as it's meant to happen.

So, be sure to mix the cheese with the fries before you dump the gravy on, or just eat there and let them do it for you...either way, the fries are good, and the gravy is salty, which is how I generally like it. But, mixed with the mozz (which is salty, as well) it can be a little over-powering. So, be prepared for that possibility.

Would I go back? Definitely. It's too good to let a few small issues keep me away.",rjHT4jvohnZQmXnf9eO_aw,3,2,3,V-jvzWubbtfub0vAlPjWzg

It's a dive bar. One door in and a back door. When you walk in, the bar is on the right and there is seating on the left. It's not very big. There are only about 9 tables. I can only imaging what this place is like on the weekend or for dinner. (They do offer take out) We went at 12:15 on a Wednesday afternoon. There were only 2 tables available. Phew. The service was slow, but there was only one guy working his ass off. We weren't in a hurry, so that wasn't a problem for us. Now, on to the food/drinks....

So it's a full bar. Any drink you want, they can make it. I had a Bloody Mary and wow! They make their own mix and its great. Perfectly spicy and didn't include the usual accompanying ""salad""... Only a lime wedge. : )

Food... I wanted pizza. I ordered two 1/4 sheet pizzas (6 square slices each). I'm only going to mention the one off the menu because it was AMAZING! The steak and cheese pizza. First off they use a white garlic sauce instead of red sauce for this pizza. (I HIGHLY recommend having this sauce over the red sauce if you make your own pizza combo. It is so tasty.) Then steak, cheese and jalapeño peppers top the pizza. Hands down the best tasting pizza I've ever had.

My husband got the Naked City & I got the Guinnea(reviews & menu say it has meatballs but it was a flat piece of meat that I thought was sausage). Have to say these were different than any other pizza I have eaten.
I cannot understand how an Italian named Guy Fieri could call this good. The place is a dive, but I wouldn't care if the food was good.
I will go back to try a sandwich but it better be a whole lot better than the pizza.

The poster said it was reinspected and reopened (I read this review after eating the pizza).
It has become VERY popular because of the segment on Diners, Driveins & Dives, very disappointing but another restaurant featured on ""Chopped"" called Rosemary's diner isn't a dissapointment and we go there again, it is a breakfast & lunch place only. Another recommended foodie recommended place is right next door to Moondoggies(Naked City Pizza) it is called Desuno tacos,if you order food from both NCP and Desuno they will let you eat your food at Desuno, good to know if you have kids, but you must have ordered from both places.
The crust was like bread, not pizza dough...granted you got a lot of food for the money, but I wasn't impressed to go back for pizza, I will try the sandwiches and review that at a later time.

The suicide fries definitely bring the heat, but it doesn't linger too long, so you're not wishing for death later in the night. Nice and hot while you're eating, but gone when you're out in the casinos later that night.

The Guinea's Pie pizza was excellent. Probably one of the better pizza's I've had, if we're being honest. The meatballs on the pizza are awesome by themselves, but combined with the ricotta, garlic sauce, spinach, and mozzarella it really turns into something super-powered.

I don't know why people complain about being neglected? I talked to two servers and Mike the owner. Had a great conversation. Mike even brought over a couple of tacos from his taco shop next door to check out. Great too! 
Pizza on a scale of 1-10 rates a 10. Then Mike told me of the other place his brother runs across and down the street from Hard Rock Cafe where they do fresh pasta everyday! I will make it there, next stop for sure. You gotta try at least two small pizzas cause taking the rest to hotel was a treat to eat by the pool!

We had some friends that posted pictures on Facebook and it looked delicious so we decided to check it out.  We went in a little before 6pm on Monday evening.  There wasn't a sole around - no customers and no employees. We figured they would be doing something in the back and would be around shortly. We sat down,found some menus and picked out our food, and waited.  We started yelling towards the back. No answer.  We walked into the back area and even around by the register.  Not safe at all but never saw anyone.
When we eventually gave up, we saw Moondoggies next door and went in there to see if they knew what had happened and they have a window to Naked City.  We went to the window where we could see three workers chatting away.  The two girls looked at us and pointed to each other.  The blonde girl drew the short straw and had to deal with the customers.  I explained that we were waiting next door for quite a while but that there wasn't anybody there.  In a very accusatory manner, she told me that she was the only one working on that side and she had to step out for a minute to get some boxes.  The word choice wasn't the best but could be overlooked.  Her obvious inability to tell time might even be overlooked but imagine a 5 year old princess right after you take away her ice cream.  This was the attitude that we encountered.  It was obviously insulting to her that we had the audacity to want to eat in a semi-timely manner and we immediately walked out.  There was no way we were getting spit-free food.

It was pretty busy, so service was slow. It looked like there was one waitress (Possibly two) for everywhere that wasn't a bar.  She was friendly, but if you are going somewhere after dinner, plan accordingly.

When we arrived there was a hockey game on, so the sound from the game wasn't too much of a distraction, but when they turned off the game and put on the music, WOW IT WAS LOUD. I mentioned how absurdly loud it was, but the waitress was either deaf from always listening to loud music or didn't hear me. Bring your ear plugs if you are averse to loud noises.  Seriously, Airplane takeoff's are not this loud. The volume was up so loud that one of the speakers would occasionally cut out.

The Pizza we ordered was very good, and even at the ""Wee"" size is enough for two.  We saw a table of three order the ""Frickin' Huge"" size and I doubt they were able to finish it.  It wasn't the best Pizza I've ever had, but it is certainly deserving of its reputation of a good pie.

Overall, if we were to return in future visits to Vegas we would get our Pizza to go. The loud noise, in addition to the bar smoke (Its a bar, so I expect people to smoke, especially in Vegas, the worlds largest smoking area) make the ambiance a little more dive than I'd like to spend time in.",zF10BKjK4Lz9U_8Yqw28ww,1,0,3,On8e84jE1sbImxW7l-yyfw

 The huge, huge pizza is $32, we ate about an eighth of it, and my son will eat the rest of it for a week or so. We saw two large gentlemen attempt to the pizza eating contest (apparently if you can eat a large in 30 minutes, I assume it's free). Yeah, they ate about 1/4 of it. It is really good.

1708660,2014-02-25,0,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"I was *highly* skeptical when my girlfriend brought me here.

First off, she found it on a show on the Food Network, a channel whose hosts and content I have found generally worthless.

Secondly, they serve Sicilian-style (square) pizzas, a type which I don't care for.

Thirdly, the owner's trademark pizza (""The Guinea"") doesn't even use tomatoes or tomato sauce, which seemed bizarre and wrong-headed.

How wrong I was.

We ordered two of the small pizzas (or ""Wee"" in Naked Pizza parlance): the Guinea, and the Meat Lovers.  I figured the Guinea was going to be a throwaway, since it is a white pizza, but since it was what caused our visit, I figured what the heck?  

It is superb.  Outstanding.  Delicious.  And I am saying this as someone who normally hates hates HATES both Sicilian AND white pizzas.  Evidently I had never had them done right before this.  Now I will be confused and unsure of my pizza-ordering for the rest of my life.  Oh well.  The meatballs are hand-made and fabulous, and the white sauce is creamy and flavorful.  The crust isnt oily or heavy -- complaints I've had about other Sicilian pizzas.

The meat-lover's was also good.  Not the same ""I-once-was-blind-but-now-I-see"" type good as the Guinea, but decent.

It took a while for them to come out, but it was worth it.  The portions were large enough that we took more than half of them home (and just had them again for lunch.  They were still good, both cold and reheated in the oven.)

The bar itself is a pleasant, dumpy, dive bar.  Not too smoky while we were there.  Service at the bar was friendly, and we didn't have to wait much.

Last time I was here I went to the Paradise location, this time this location better met our needs.  It was around 10 PM and we needed some quick food on our drive back to St. George, Utah, so we did a pickup order through the Yelp app.

20 minutes later we arrived to pick up the food and found that it appeared to be closed.  Luckily some locals pointed us to the attached bar where you can pick up the food late at night.  I'm really not sure we would have figured this out on our own.  Inside the bar there is a small window that you can talk to the pizza people through.  They told us it was still being prepared and would be done soon.  We sat at the bar and waited.

We got the food and got in the car...my girlfriend did the ordering and I don't remember the pizza that she got.  It was the smallest, which is still a decent size, philly eggrolls, and of course my main reason for being there, the suicide fries!  These fries are amazing.  

We started our drive as I entered spicy nirvana.  The flavors are amazing, the pain is real, the heat is fantastic.  I sweat in two new places that I had never experienced, inside my ears and on my eyelids.  It was painful, but so tasty.  I just kept going, fry after fry, until I had to stop.  Everything was so good and I had finished about 3/4 of it, with a few peppers left over.   I don't really know how to describe the flavor, but it is just amazing.  Don't eat these if you can't handle seriously spicy food.  They are so good.

I had some of the pizza to calm me down and take away the heat.  I like their crust, not thin, but also not too thick.  The cheese was delicious.  The philly rolls were pretty good as well, but I only had a bite or two of them.

Overall it was another great visit, 2/2 so far.  I look forward to next time I have an excuse to eat here!  Prices are good as well, only $5-6 for the rolls and fries and the pizzas are big!",wxuVZTfo1pThbqfzz97uLg,2,0,5,ezrZvfXsnb5_xF4rGJ7yzA

1837019,2014-05-20,1,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Bookmarked this placed based on their claim-to-fame of having the best sandwich in town- as rated by LV Weekly in 2012. Returned a few times for various pizzas, and my verdict is that while the crust is consistently good, items are generally hit or miss.

The ROYAL HOT SUB sandwich was my BF's favorite: Italian sausage, capicola, and mozzarella chopped in two equally enormous halves. Bread didn't seem particularly fresh, both meats were fairly dry to me, and there was no moisture on the sandwich, lending an overall dryness to the whole affair. It worked for my guy, and apparently for the staff at LV Weekly, but it wasn't the best to me. 

SICILIAN WINGS were underwhelming: 50 cent surcharge for this flavor, for reasons unknown. Wings were perfectly cooked to tender and juicy, but lacked flavor. Minimal sprinkle of garlic and parm outside, mostly smaller wings, again they just didn't really do anything for me.

BEEF ON WECK Pizza of the day was not my style but I really appreciated the creativity that went into taking a NY sandwich and creating a pizza version of it; beef on top, horseradish sauce, creamy mozzarella, and a salted/seasoned crust. Flavors are strong and bold, tasty, but not something I'd eat more than a slice of.

FATBOY PIZZA is the bomb though: Cappicola, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, crushed tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. It smells amazing and tastes even better, the tomato and basil really add a lot of flavor. I like that though it as several meats, they're distributed in such a way that it's an overwhelming grease bomb like other meaty pizzas. 

 I think I need to leave this place on my list to visit again and try the Guinea pizza when I have a bigger appetite (or perhaps after hitting the gym). I've been mostly underwhelmed by non-pizza options here.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,1,3,KLW2a6I3DVimr2HpbPCa_Q

They claim to be a Bills and Sabres bar but sadly that's not the case.

The first time I called the girl asked me if the Sabres were a football team! She proceeded to tell me I had to call back the next day and ask the bartender. I had my husband call later that night in hopes of speaking to someone else and getting a definitive answer, after all our friends from out of town were driving all the way from the strip so I wanted to be sure.

The Good:
- The hot sauce was actually hot. (All too often, the hot level is barely medium.)
- The hot sauce had a different and interesting flavor. Not your average tavern wing sauce.
- The suicide sauce, of which I got a side of, was one of the best super-hot sauces I've experienced.
- On the day I went, Naked City had partnered up with Fukuburger (food truck).
- Moon Doogies itself is an ok dive bar.

The Bad:
- The wings themselves - the chicken - was not of good quality.
- The wing sauces are very thin and liquidity. While the flavors are good, there is a lack of substance.
- Everything comes ""take out""-style. You can sit at the bar or a high-top table and eat, but you're doing so out of styrofoam containers and little plastic cups.
- The wait for the food can be quite long.

The Ugly:
- The dipping sauces, ranch and blue cheese, were awful - among the worst I've experienced. (Good dipping sauces are a requirement for achieving good wing status.)

Now, admittedly, I've only tried the wings here. The menu was intriguing enough that I anticipate a return visit, where I'll try the pizza and maybe some other items.

I read a lot of the reviews so I was worried about the service, but I had no problems.  I was the only one in the ""eating area"" so maybe it's hit and miss depending on how busy they are, but the waitress came fast, the food came fast, and she came back often.

I ordered a Wee pepperoni/sausage and it was exactly the type of pizza I like.  The cheese stretches out, the crust has a crispy outer texture but is softer inside, and the sausage is the crumbled kind, not the Domino's type nuggets.  I'm not a huge red sauce fan but I didn't even notice it.

I got the wings (naked) with the suicide sauce on the side.  People are right when they say it's spicy but it doesn't stay with you.  I'm guessing it's habenero.   

The total for the pizza, 10 wings, and a soda was $22.  I managed to get through about half of it and I'm a pretty big eater.

I'm definitely going to go back when I return to Vegas in the future.  Everyone has different tastes in pizza, and if this is the style you like, you're going to love it.",Ap0-JqUsibRaVSlTf_HqnA,0,0,5,F-j_zXUoRSrbDm4uCIHdgw

Guinea's Pie: meatballs, spinach and ricotta. All amazing.

Margehrita Pizza but they spelled it as ""Margarita:"" tomato, basil and mozarella. The basics.

2250563,2011-08-11,4,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"I'm really disappointed in Naked City Pizza Shop. How dare they be 20 minutes away? I can only imagine how delicious this pizza must be when it's hot and fresh, and I'll never know unless I eat it there.

Which is never going to happen. Any place with a big banner that says ""Smoker Friendly"" isn't going to be seating my sensitive nose. That's not a criticism: NCPS is inside Moondoggie's bar, so the smoking is reasonable; I get it. But I can't mix the smell of cigarettes with food, so it's my loss. 

NCPS was suggested to my husband here on Yelp when we asked about where to get a pizza that wasn't NY-style or Chicago-style. I love Grimaldi's, and I don't hate Chicago-style, but where ARE all of the ""normal"" takeout/delivery pizzas with a thick crust, evenly spread toppings, and cooked all the way through? (I thought it was Metro. It wasn't. Northside Nathan's is a fave, but it's also a bit far for take-out.)

I'm glad a Groupon came up or we never would've bothered to make the trek to this dive, and I mean ""dive"" in the ""fun, casual, non-derogatory"" sense. Mostly. Even so, we waited until the day the coupon expired. The lure of a potentially good pizza almost didn't beat out location and atmosphere.

I got the ""not-so-wee"" (half-sheet) with mushrooms, ricotta, and garlic. This is a new combination for me and now one I look forward to trying elsewhere. (If I ever find an elsewhere.) I've been eating this pizza for three days now, so believe me that they're honest about the sizes. The ""frickin' huge"" is the next step up and more for dining in with six friends. The step down is the ""wee,"" which I imagine has the benefit of more edge pieces.

Ah, the rectangular pizza and the problem of the edge-less middle pieces. It's one issue that keeps me from getting take-out at Northside Nathan's any more, but NCPS's middle slices were so good that I didn't mind the lack of edge, and a fine edge it is. Chewy, thick, but not hard and kind of fluffy. I could've done with an air bubble or three, but this is good.

My husband got the Stinger without bleu cheese and with ""red sauce"" as opposed to no sauce, I think. (The red sauce has a tiny kick to it - nice.) Let's just say that his didn't last three days.

I was really intrigued by the cherry-chocolate malts, and in just the past few days they've added online ordering, but it's really not a place I want to hang out - not inside, and not in the parking lot, either. For that I have to dock a star. But this is just the kind of pizza I'm looking for... now someone please tell me where to find this in the southwest?",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,4,4,4,DScBM4Br-KRZOlbRBvAo-w
2261640,2011-07-28,2,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Alert - this business does not have the same menu as Naked City Sandwich Shop!!!  So there is no tri tip sandwich on the menu.  There is no kimmelweck.  Yelp transferred the reviews from Naked City Sandwich Shop here but it is a completely different menu!  The current Review Highlights are not accurate.

That being said, pretty darn good food!  The pizza was awesome!  I'm usually weary of square pizzas as they tend to be too thin for me and lack flavor in my experience.  But this was good stuff! Thin crust, a little crunchy, and so flavorful.  I highly recommend the Fatboy.

The subs don't really hold a candle to the Naked City Sandwich Shop offerings.  But the sub I got was pretty good.  The Stinger, which has steak and boneless buffalo wings, was inventive.  Note - the pizzas and subs share some of the same names so make sure you clarify what you want when you order.

The poutine was pretty good (fries covered in gravy and cheese curds for the uninitiated).  I've never had poutine before so I have no frame of reference.  But the fries were excellent!  My favorite kind.  Skin on, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  So yummy!

Chris, the guy running the entire operation, took my groupon without a problem.  There were some unique specials on the board, such as pork ragu, so make sure to check the board beside the window before ordering.

The restaurant will only deliver within one mile and I can't get the online ordering system to work, ever.  Even when it was Naked City Sandwich Shop.  It's inside a smoky Moondoggies.  Just look for the sign that says pizza by the slice.  I dig the food but it's not in my hood and video poker bars are not my thing.

We weren't sure we were at the right place when we walked in but the staff was friendly and assured us we were. Pretty typical dive bar atmosphere, the owner is from Buffalo so there was a ton of Buffalo stuff on the walls which was nice as that is the area we are from. We ordered two wee's to split between four of us: 

The Ginuea: This was featured on the show so we tried it. Fantastic!! The sauce was what put it over the top for me.

The Margarita: I was a little disappointed in the lack of sauce and basil(I was just expecting/wanted more) but every one thought it was good.

We finished with the fried dough: powdered sugar, chocolate sauce and fried=mmmmm.

We inquired about getting a cab to get back to the strip and the waitress called one up for us. I told her I would include her name and I forgot it (I'm very sorry!) but she was great.

Since Santora's closed (reopened under a new name, shut down and reopened under Santora's w/o Buffalo food ), I've been feening for some good ""back home"" food.  We saw the DDD episode and my BF's friend wanted to check the place out so we went this past weekend. Waitstaff is friendly, but service is a bit slow. I'm not sure if they were shorthanded, but the owner of the place does step in to help clear tables and such.  The menu made me hear Angels singing from the heavens.  They have pizza logs which are cheese and pepp w/ a touch of sauce wrapped in an egg roll wrapper and deep fried. They also do Philly cheesesteak logs...same theory. Chicken wing dip is something I make frequently for my friends out here for parties, so we skipped that.  Was delighted to see chicken finger subs and the Stinger!   Was disappointed however to get the chicken finger sub and it didn't have lettuce, tomato, or cheese /onion on it as I was expecting :(    The stinger is cheesesteak, chicken fingers on a sub roll with traditional toppings. The wings were just like home, crispy on the outside, juicy in the middle...however some people think they're overcooked because they're used to the wings being soft all the way around out here, and honestly, that's not the way Buffalo does them people.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Hot sauce is actually hot!  It's just like home. Normally, I'd order hot out here and get something along the lines of medium but this place does it right!   Now, the pizza. I've been struggling to find good pizza out here and the best I've had thus far is Mama Mia's on Buffalo near Flamingo, or Northside Nathans.  This place does a good crust.  The crust actually rises and is airy and soft.  The toppings are fresh, and the sauce is not overly acidic or sweet with tons of tomato paste.  I tasted home.  :)    Next time, I'm going to get the poutine fries which are french fries topped with brown gravy, and cheese curds on top of that. It's more of a Canadian dish, but Buffalo NY being so close to the border of Canada, we know what it is and it's great!  
Will definitely be back to watch our football team lose yet again this season, and drink cheap beer $2.00 bud/bud light drafts or bottles during games. Same story for the Sabres.",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,3,2,4,eds_tga1dHB6l-byr1wJug

No doubt one of the best pizza shops in Vegas, but the consistency is all over the place here.  We normally order from this location so maybe the other 2 are different, even though this is the original. 

I don't even know if they deliver LoL I think they do, so you should get it... so why 3/5??

Once, we ordered a pie and I waited the 20-30 mins before going in and went to the window for my pickup.  The girl at the window proceeds to tell me there isn't an order by the names I've given. Hmmm. I verified we called the correct location and she asked the other employees if they knew of my order... Low & behold, they knew we ordered and said all the orders weren't coming in at all. I'm thinking, if you know this, why not handwrite the orders until the problem is solved by management/owner? I waited for the pizza and wasn't even offered a discount, free drink or anything...

I work a lot of conventions in Las Vegas and encourage the booth owners to order pizza for setup days... we order the largest pizza. I'll tell you, the first time, it was so amazing, I actually ate 4 slices!! I couldn't move for 10 minutes, but every bite was worth it, but it's been 2 years now and the last times, I can barely get through 2 slices before calling it quits. Even if I'm ""starving"". Sometimes the crust is so thin and cardboard tasting, other times it's burnt and disappointing. I honestly don't remember the last time having a perfect Naked City pizza. 

I'll keep trying them because there's always those days when the pizza maker is on effing point, and those days make you understand why people love pizza and this place.

The woman at the counter wasn't friendly. I had never been here so didn't know whether to leave tip when I order or at the table. I added my tip to the order which I hate doing. I prefer to tip after not before I get my order. No thanks from the employee, just abrupt service from a worker who clearly didn't want to be there. I was irked at myself that I left a tip for her.

2621875,2013-08-02,2,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"After realizing there is a buzz about this place being on the Food Network, I had a chance to stop by here for lunch!  A friend and I shared a Guinea's Pie.  This pie comes with meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese, and was the one featured on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives.  The show made it look really good, so we had to try it!

The pizza, cut up into squares, was quite tasty.  The dough was well crafted, and the cheese was high quality.  The ricotta comes in a thin layer I think, and blended really well with the mozzarella giving it a slight creaminess.  The spinach was light and went really well with the pizza. Probably the most impressive thing about this pie was the sausage.  According to the show they make the sausage from scratch, starting with grinding the meat.  It was superb!  

The bar that Naked City is in is nothing special unless you long for Buffalo, NY.  Bills posters line the walls, the dark dive bar atmosphere lit lightly with blue lights.  The service was top notch and fast.  The water was served from flip top bottles and tasted filtered and fresh.  The beer selection was a little weak, but they did have a local Tenaya Creek beer on draft that made up for it.  

Is this the best pizza in town?  It is damn good, and probably the best ""Buffalo"" style pizza I have had, however there is at least one pizza place that goes above and beyond this one (however it is more of a NY style pizza).

2641321,2014-08-13,16,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Located inside of the diviest of dive bars, but that's not the issue to us - we enjoy a good dingy dive bar.

We came here for 2 reasons:
1. I had an emergency late night pizza craving. 
2. This was the only place open past 12am that had decent reviews (namely because Guy Fieri recommended them on Triple D.)

I'm just going to put this boldly out there - the pizza was a lie. 

I can't necessarily state that Guy is lie on this one, because I bet this place used to be good, then triple D aires, then the word gets out, then the hype man takes the stage, then they cut massive ingredients and quality to make a profit. Right. It's a sad tune we're all too familiar with. 

The pizza itself was very dry and I can honestly state it was pretty much all thick, dense dough. The dough wasn't even special or memorable - not even slightly sweet or anything that would make it stand out. The tomato sauce was barely noticeable and it wasn't robust, or striking in flavor. The cheese was also extremely limited as well. Everything fell seriously flat on our taste buds.

The toppings were all few and very far between. The meats were sparse and standard, nothing to holler home about. There were tiny specs here and there with spinach. Seriously!? How expensive is spinach, that you can't even hook an honest paying customer up with it? It was truly nonexistent.

Let me ask you this, why did we get the pizza with no love? I think my theory is concrete and valid. 

Here's what we regretted ordering:
Fatboy ""not so wee"" Pizza: $21
- subbed sausage for spinach 
- subbed salami for ricotta 
- this pizza advertised basil yet they some how forgot the basil? (forgot? or, on purpose... my paranoia is beginning to wonder...)

Pit BBQ Wings: $8 (single = 10pcs?)
- hahahahaha they either, a.) Skimped us, or, b.) Don't know how to count - either way, that's totally annoying and frustrating when you pay for 10 wings and expect 10 wings, but get 9. 
(To be fair- the bbq sauce was robust & the wings were well sauced)

Ranch: free 
- very runny and watery 

It's pathetic that I had a better pizza slice at Sbarro in the mall the other day - the red pizza sauce they had there was full of life and flavor, plus they probably put 1 handful of spinach on that 1 slice of pizza. Sadly, that's the opposite of Naked Pizza.

The only thing they got going for them is this: open until 3am. 

$31 bill for a disappointing pizza dinner is not cool, not cool at all. We wasted our time and our dime.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,25,13,1,Zo7frBXca_bGjhnFr-fOmA

The food is still  slightly above average but no longer amazing and I tried the Tomato Basil soup the last time and it was slightly below average  to me.  You brought my expectations up and then right back down Naked City.

The service  has been very good all 3 times I have visited but I felt the need to update my review as to not steer fellow Yelpers in the wrong  direction. The sandwiches are  OK to slightly better than OK.   It is better than Subway? Yes. Is it worth going out of your way to find? Not really anymore.

The name  and old school pictures on the wall still get points from me. The inconsistency the last 2 times I have gone  and the above average prices deserves and update in stars. 

I am hoping this is a hiccup that Naked City can fix because I would love to see it do well. As of right now I don't feel its worth going out of your way to seek it out. If you happen to be in the area and want to make a trip downtown or to Luv-it then its worth trying out.

2732721,2010-08-11,4,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not the biggest pizza fan, I do not have a ""thing"" for pizza, I think the majority of the pizza places in the valley are waaaay over priced and overrated, and there is a surplus of pizza/italian restaurants in town to create an internal ""demand"" for me. And after working in a pizzeria for a summer when I was 19, I was pretty much over pizza for the rest of my life. However, this teeny-tiny kitchen with a window inside a dive bar (Moon Doggies) that has blacked out windows, and still requires you to ring the door bell at 11am, is by far the best pizza I've ever had in my life. 

Normally, I don't even crave for pizza, but after the last two times I've visited this place within the past 2 weeks, I still can't get enough of it. But these Naked City guys and their tiny spaces with their big food ventures are hitting it out of the park with their sandwiches and pizza. 

The pizzas themselves are ""Buffalo, NY"" style, which I guess means having rectangular pizzas, like Sicilian style, but with a much less thick and dense crust. That doesn't mean that their slices aren't dense, because they most definitely are and filled me up with 2 slices. But when they're hot, the crust is crispy on the outside, and moist and chewy on the inside, and the cheese is bubbling hot. The first time I went, I got the Guinea's Pie that had meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce, and mozzarella on it, and I asked that he add some basil too. It was out of this world. Plus the guy that was working there was super nice and humble, and was really, really glad that we liked his pizza. 

The second time I went there was to pick up a pizza to go, and this time I got the Veggie Pizza--with sweet and hot peppers, onions, tomato, broccoli, olives, spinach, mushrooms, mozzarella, and red sauce--and added some meatball to it to satisfy some meat-loving co-workers. What they don't mention in the menu is how spicy the crust is from the hot peppers. I love spicy food, and this was just in between ""I can handle it"" and ""Whew, I need some water!"" spicy. While the crust didn't maintain it's crusty/chewiness on the drive over to North LV, it was still pretty damn good. I also got the Naked City Bread Basket, which was not as good as it sounded in the menu, but may have also been due to the travel time it endured. It was a little hard and dry, but the toppings made it okay.

As a fan of Naked City Sandwich Shop, I was happy to learn that they also use that awesome garlic mayo in their subs at their pizza shop. I have yet to try their sandwiches, pasta, or wings, but I wouldn't mind giving it a try if I could tear myself away from their pizza for a minute. 

One more thing about their pizzas: they're HUGE and CHEAP! Aziz B. and I each got our own ""Wee"" pizza, which I think translates to medium, and they were like a large anywhere else. At 11 bucks a pop, they came with 8 slices where I could only finish 2, and Aziz--an actual pizza lover--could only finish 3 of his own. Now that was something of an eye-opener to me. Well, so was the slightly inebriated and possibly stoned bartender we were chatting with as she drooled over our pizzas, but that was to be expected.",T5vVvAqlZiKcPIXS857kQg,5,5,5,Wvmm8IG3gZLj2fJfbm8fTA

After hearing so much about Naked City Pizza, we wanted to see what all the hype was about! We came in here hungover from the night before hoping to get a bit of grease to soak up what booze was left in our systems, and this seemed like the kind of place that could help us out with that  kind of problem. 

Naked City Pizza is basically a kitchen with some designated seating that is inside of a dive bar called Moon Doggies- hahahahaha. I'm sorry that name ""Moon Doggies"" is just hysterical to me lol!! 

This place is  Buffalo NY inspired, as the owner is from B-Lo! Being from New York myself, I can honestly say this place looks like an Upstate NY dive/greasy spoon spot with it's décor, and age stains coating the bar. However, I have always noticed places like this seem to have the best food.

Anyway, we ordered mild wings and a pizza with spinach, onions, and meatballs. Are wings were the first thing to come out, they were cooked perfectly, not soggy, and had a slight bite for being mild wings-delicious! The pizza was next, it had a thick crust, and the meatballs on it were the size of New Jersey!! I was expecting the typical crumbles of meatballs you get on a pizza, but not this one it was huge- but that was okay with us! The pizza was delish as well, they use a good quality dough, cheese, and sauce.

She seemed really busy but as I was watching her, she wasn't really doing anything and she was being rude about it toward other guests. I saw when we walked in that she was sat 2-2 person tables and 1-3 person table. 7 people total. She continued to help 1 of the 2 person tables and told us and the other table that she would be with us shortly. It took too long so we left. We went and spent $85 at another restaurant. I'm sure this happens all the time here. The bartender saw us but didn't really help. YOU NEED A HOST!!! I cannot stress that enough. The 10 minutes I was there I didn't feel welcomed at all. I feel like its worse than just retraining your staff. You need to teach them how human beings should be treated.

I'm usually not a huge sausage fan, but I couldn't get enough. I could have literally eaten the entire pizza myself!!!

The incredible menu doesn't stop at the pizza. I've also had the stuffed mushrooms and wings, which were fantastic. I don't know how anyone could have anything negative to say about the mushrooms as they were SO delicious!!! I've never had better! I'm dying to try the pasta on my next trip!!!

1) 0% cleanliness. The tables had crumbs on them, the floors were really dirty and the restrooms just indescribable. I almost lost my appetite. Worse than a gas station.
2) The pizza dripped fat like I've never experienced in my life. Specially the pepperoni one. Fat dripping like the freaking Niagara Falls.
3) The door seemed broken, being slightly open letting cold air and street noise in. The counter lady was gentle enough to close it, after struggling to do so.

3062197,2012-07-08,4,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"So tried this out for the 1st time tonight ...
Quite a distance from our house but nevertheless.

The place is definitely a ""dive"" so it does fit into the DDD well.  I had to let my eyes adjust for a few seconds when I walked in because it's dark :)

Once I could see - we walked over to the takeout window and were greeted by a really nice waiter. He asked if it was first time and if we wanted some suggestions but I had my mind made up before we walked in lol.  

We opted for the ""not so wee"" (about the size of 2 of their menus) size of the ""Fat Boy"" which consisted of Mozzerella cheese, fresh tomatoes, fresh sausage with delicious fennel seeds, pepperoni, ham and fresh basil. I also ordered a small poutine (for those not familiar it's fries served traditionally with brown gravy and cheese curds). Since I have an aversion to curds - I asked them to make it with just Mozzerella and they were happy to do it. Though I've had poutine in Montreal on several occasions - I grew up with cheese fries and gravy in Philly and for the life of me - it's a struggle to cheese fries in this town unless they have nasty nacho cheese on them.

The poutine was great. The fries were freshly cut, not very greasy and had just the right amount of cheese. They put the gravy on the side which was a brilliant idea as it was a 20+ min ride home - this way they weren't too soggy.  I'm not sure what else they put on the fries but I could have made a meal of just these fries. They were great!

As for the pizza - it was also great. I loveeeee that they make their own fresh sausage and that they use fresh ingredients on the pizza. Though it wasn't your typical ""dive"" pizza that I'm used to getting in a pizza shop back east - this was some damn good stuff. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is that I would prefer if the pizza toppings were spread out more to hit the 4 corner pieces. Since the pizza is rectangular most of the ingredients are focused towards the middle of the pizza do when you grab for a piece along the edge you don't get to taste all of the flavors.

The entire staff was friendly and kept us up to date on our order.

Something with crust that's quite chewy, not undercooked, wet, floppy, or any of a dozen different complaints I can have with pizza in Las Vegas. Naked City was one of the suggestions in that thread as a place which might satisfy my pizza specifications.

You see, I'm one of those people who, every time they read a review for a pizza place that starts with ""As everyone knows, Las Vegas is a mecca for great pizza....."" sighs in bogglement that my tastes are, apparently, so different from the LV mainstream with regard to pizza. I've searched high and low and nothing has perfectly fit the bill.

That was until I braved Moodoggie's Bar to pick up a ""Stinger"" pizza with red sauce and entered pizza heaven. Let's not split hairs - the place looks scary, the bar is right out of the early 80s, complete with sit down Galaga coin-op. The ""pizza shop"" is a window looking into a tiny, slightly grimy-looking (though I'm sure that's just age and it's perfectly clean) kitchen. And yet somehow it all works to create my idea of perfect pizza. A thickish crust with not too much sauce of the kind that isn't overly sweet or overly gloopy. Delicious toppings, correct cooking time and wonderful taste. It all came together to produce a huge ""not so wee"" pizza that I inhaled in an evening.

I can see why the place gets mixed reviews. Its appearance combined with the massive deviation from what most people seem to regard as ""good pizza"" is sure to throw a few cats among the rating pigeons, but if you're like me, and the thought of another sloppy, undercooked pizza that people tell you you're supposed to ""fold up to eat"", give Naked City a try.

I was thrilled to see that this place had one.  So I decided to go there for lunch.  The place is inside a bar called Moon Doggies.  I was disappointed, because of the cigarette smoke.  The bartender was really nice.  However, the girl at the window was very business and not friendly at all.  I ordered half a Beef on Weck and a slice of pepperoni.  And then I ordered a beer from the bar.  The pizza came out first.  I could not taste any sauce on it.  It was in a square and I got a corner piece.

The sandwich was the big disappointment.  If these people are from Buffalo, then they have never eaten at Schwabl's or Charlie The Butcher there, because this is NOT Beef on Weck.  It was more like Philly Cheesesteak style beef, not rare, sliced roast beef.  And it was not rare, it was completely cooked.  The Kummelweck roll looked like a hot dog bun with caraway seeds and salt on it.  I'm giving it three stars, because the bartender was super sweet and it seems like a good place to have some beers or drinks, but I definitely would not order food there again.",gmYU_SLgpWgafgSejWdzTg,0,0,3,mJk_NIAyLFdPya9Dcsedeg

We built our own medium pizza with our choice of toppings: mozarella, pepperoni, mushroom, and bacon. It's not only crunchy, light and airy but hearty. There was so much leftover. I didn't have room for Suicide fries or Wings. Prices aren't bad.

3577067,2011-01-26,3,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"After once again searching Yelp for some of the higher reviewed places near where I live I found the Naked City Pizza Shop.  

The pizza shop is located inside of the Moon Doggies bar.  It's not even sectioned off like a Subway inside of a convenience store, it's really just a window in the wall.  It can be quite difficult to find if you've never been there before -- it's on the northeast corner of Arville and Desert Inn.  The bar itself seems to have bar seats for 15 people and small tables & high chairs for another 15.  It's the epitome of a dive bar but it seems to be clean enough.  Aside from the video poker at the bar, there's a golf arcade game, a hunting arcade game, an electronic dartboard, and one of those punching bag games.  Smoking is allowed everywhere, if that's make-or-break for you.

I came with a friend around 1:30 PM on a Tuesday and obviously there was little traffic.  The guy running the shop was really nice and attentive.  Huge bonus points for that, although some of the other reviews talk about bad or slow service so your mileage may vary.  We decided to try a little bit of everything and planned on taking quite a bit home with us.  Like other reviewers note, whether or not you eat there, everything is served in the styrofoam takeout containers.  If you eat there you do get some plates and plastic cutlery though.

We got some single slices of pepperoni pizza, a ham sub, seasoned fries, garlic buns, suicide wings, and fried dough.  Even a single slice of the pizza is huge and tastes great with a good sauce, great cheese, and superb dough.  I believe they call it Brooklyn style but all I know is it was great.  The pizza reminded me of Pizza Hut when I was a kid.  I don't mean in terms of taste or quality, but for me it was always a treat to get to go to Pizza Hut as a kid.  Nowadays I find their pizza quite bland, perhaps because my taste buds have changed, perhaps because their ingredients have changed.   Anyway Naked City's pizza gives me that same feeling as when I was a kid.

The ham sub has a lot of ham and a lot of cheese in it, and the bun of the sub is toasted, but it's just like something you would make from stuff you got in the store.   I would imagine some of the heated subs using their pizza ingredients are better.  The fries were great.  Done perfectly, and even the small for $2 filled up an entire styrofoam container.  The garlic buns are like garlic bread with cheese, served with marinara (which Naked City calls 'red sauce' on their menu).  Absolutely delicious with the bubbly browned cheese.  The wings themselves are large but nothing special.  The suicide hot sauce is quite messy but very hot.  The fried dough was quite good and covered in chocolate sauce.  It, like pretty much everything else, filled up a single styrofoam container but it wasn't ""heavy"" as far as desserts go.  

The chef/server was really nice and as I mentioned above service was fairly fast.  Even though we ordered the dessert along with everything else he said he would bring it out a while after we had gotten the rest of our food and he even brought over a pitcher of soda for us so we wouldn't have to ask for a bunch of refills.  I'll be honest, I think the quality of service at most places in Vegas ranges from average to terrible, but this was top notch.

Overall, I'm a bit torn.  The food is great quality, huge portions, and very cheap.  The location leaves a lot to be desired though. I get the feeling that such good pizza and sides are almost wasted on the patrons of a bar when it deserves to be in a restaurant on its own.  This is definitely a diamond in the rough.   I'll probably go on my own again, get takeout, or order delivery, but it's pretty unlikely I'd take a group of friends or my family there.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,5,4,4,R8mP_B_yEPf37QC10haQ6g

It's every bit as wonderful and decadent as you might have heard, and you're probably going to obliterate any notion of health consciousness you may have once had just to get through.

For one, I can't come here without ordering the suicide fries. I love spicy food, and these fries speak to me in ways that most places that boast spicy dishes could ever begin to understand. The fries are crisp and awesome, drenched in a truly hot sauce. The problem here is that I can't hardly justify eating a mound of fries when I know I'm gonna have pizza. They just give you so many fries, even with the small order. It's a dilemma because I don't let myself come here very often because I don't want to gain a hundred pounds, so when I do visit, I've got to have pizza , and I've absolutely got to have fries. Also, I don't like to waste food, so you see the beginning of my problems.

Then the pizza is massive, covered in cheese... I'm full after just a few slices, and my wife is never any help. Dough is light and tastes surprisingly fresh. It's so good I usually push myself to eat more when I know I shouldn't.

I just can't hang with this place.

The Pizza here is made from scratch down to the meatballs, and the quality is noticeable. Due to this added quality assurance protocol and time honored method of ''Freshly prepared,'' you may have to wait for your food. Be prepared for a lengthy wait, though it is well worth it. Prices also reflect quality, but again the increase is worth it, and I will say a mediocre increase considering the taste and quality are exceptional.  Here you order your pizza by the sheet. 1/4 of a sheet was more then enough to feed 2 friends and myself, and half a sheet should keep your fridge well stocked with delicious cold pizza leftovers. A whole sheet? I dare not order it. That's cold pizza for a week! Think of it as the birthday party pizza. 

Suicide Fries = HOT FRIES. I like hot, and the sauce on these should not disappoint unless you inhale Ghost peppers by the handful, then you sir are the exception. 

The added plus of being located in a bar is the drinking options. You have plenty of beer and hard liquor choices to cover all bases. Enjoy your epic pizza!",bgJLZAEaB04x9UQIm3sATQ,6,5,4,cOCuHEwSJ8JQan6IaJ3iRA

I went here to try another spot on the Triple D list and I'm starting to doubt Guy's taste bud's, he is 50/50 so far in my book. Drove into town looking to try a good eating spot. Went here with family and got a big surprise once we got there. It's a bar/lounge nothing for the Fam. Being from the Windy City I know good pizza. I felt like we ordered a hot n ready from Little Caesar's. It wasn't nasty but it will not get any recommendations from me.

When I got there it was a guy out front drinking a beer, he said he owned two tattoo shops, and he was pumping the place up saying, everything was good. Hahaha it amazes me how different people taste's are telling them something is good versus what is really good. I'm totally convinced that if there were a taste test to prove that some foods are not as good as others, I think a lot of people would like the crap food over the good flavorful foods.

 I also ordered the wings with all the sauces I like my sauce on the side so I can actually taste the wings and my wings were dry and brittle. The sauces were typical. I get better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings and sauces to. 

The fries were rubbery and soft nothing to brag about, I was really disappointed with my order, but I'm sure it's hit or miss when you do take out, but nothing can save that pizza flavor, it doesn't matter if the pizza is cold or hot when it's good it's good, and this pizza needs some more flavor added to it. 

Other posts on here mentioned the staff and I had a little blond help me with my order and she was making me feel like I was asking for to much when I asked for more Ketchup. She wasn't pleasant at all. Oh and speaking of the ketchup. I heard they make their own, they should stick to buying it from the market. Not at all impressed with the watered down taste.

The bartender at MoonDoggie's was also really friendly, though his personal selection of music from his iPod varied from heavy metal to R&B music lol.

I would have rated the pizza a 7 out of 10 (with 5 being an average pizza). The dough was great, the pepperoni was great, but the cheese was where they missed. The cheese was tasteless and I had to add a little bit of salt and peppers to give the pizza that zing that I was looking for.

Being from near Buffalo this is a taste of near home.  If you are from Upstate or Western NY get your butt here!!

Even if you are not from NY, you'll live this pizza. We have been a couple times and brought friends. It's our go to pizza place. Yes, the puzza take awhile but they are done right!! We recently ventured into the appetizer portion of the menu...  Seasoned fries. Delicious!!  Do you know what a pizza log is? Usually it's this totally crappy yet weirdly addictive frozen egg roll looking thing filled with cheese and pepperoni and deep fried and the grease squirts out the end and gets your date in the eye and leaves a big grease stain on your shirt.

The sub was pretty bland which is hard to do with a hot wing themed sub.

As for the poutine, I struggle to review it. I'd actually classify it closer to a cheese fries and gravy than a poutine. If you've eaten at a diner in NY or NJ, you've had this dish... fries with some sliced cheese melted over the top and brown gravy. While the flavor was decent (good gravy which is important) the fries definitely needed to be more well done - a good poutine needs crispy fries in my opinion. That said, this also isn't what I would consider to be poutine. A true poutine has nice cheesy curds located throughout like nuggets of gold that you discover and cherish like pirate's booty....

So there was no way I was going to miss out on the first day they open.  I worked out for 2 hrs in the morning in anticipation of the calories I planned to consume...ha!

The restaurant is located inside Moondoggies video poker bar.  I was pleased to see that the menu was much larger than their sandwich shop....so I went big and ordered a Slice of Cheese, Slice of Pepperoni, Slice of the Pie of the Day (Royal, see menu pics for details), and an order of 3 Chicken Fingers.

The Pizza came out first.  I tried the Cheese Slice first.  It is a thick crust.  The menu calls it Buffalo, NY Style Pizza....I've  never had this style before.  The pizza is loaded with Cheese....the crust is soft and doughy, not how I usually prefer my Pizza but it was good.  There is a good proportion of sauce.

The second slice I had was the Pepperoni.  It has the small slices of Pepperoni and the best part is that the Pepperoni is slightly burnt...+1 in my book.  Again, good proportion of sauce and cheese.  Nice zing to the Pepperoni too.

The third slice was the Royal, which was the best of the 3....no wonder it was the Pie of the Day!  Cappicola Ham, Italian Sausage, Mozzarella, and Ricotta goodness all in one Pizza Pie!!!!  The meats are very tasty and fresh....this combo went well together.  I am glad I splurged and went for it.

The last thing to come out was the Chicken Fingers....they were good, not great. The sauce was Mild and the appropriate spice level.  The fingers were not the crispy style, but the soaked chewy style.  It was ok.

Moondoggies is an older bar, so don't expect a great atmosphere....it's a video poker bar and it is not in the suburbs....and hasn't been Gentrified....yet. ;-)

Was a little strange to get your app at the same time as the meal. As for the pizza, it is Sicilian style (rectangular) which I'm not a huge fan of because I like crust, so you have an entire mid section of pizza that is all alone because I eat around it. We ordered half margherita and half back home. When the pizza came out it looked good, but as I got a couple bites in, it started to taste gross. They bake the pizza with the basil on it instead of putting it on after, so the basil is wilted and burnt, the tomatoes tasted canned and the cheese was gross to look at after 15 minutes, it became hard and formed, and the crust had an overwhelming taste of yeast, clearly not quality ingredients.

We went today for lunch because I needed to try the Beef on Weck, a Buffalo favorite that's right up there with wings and it was great! The kimmelweck rolls were perfect and they served it with horseradish, it took me back home. The wings were spot on and the only negative for me was they were served with fries instead of carrots and celery and I prefer a different kind of blue cheese, just my preference. Unfortunately I cannot comment on the pizza because I was too full to even take a bite but it did look good!

This is some good freaking pizza! Obscenities flew out of our mouths, uncontrollably, as we feasted.  So delicious! I am sure it depends what kind of pizza you like;  I like a fluffy doughy marvelous pizza.  Some people prefer that crappy crispy cardboardy stuff.  

We had the guinea pie - Chris proclaimed it was his favorite.  My favorite now too! AMAZEing.  Meatballs, ricotta, garlic, fresh mozzarella. YUM.

We also had poutine, and the pork ragu fettucini from the specials board which came with chewy, delicious garlic buns, and a zesty sald with vinaigrette.

Just to finish of our carb fest, we ordered the fried. dough.  This does not such.  Warm chocolately powdered sugary goodness.

So $32 for four people - is this a joke? Salad, pizza, buns, pasta with a pound of flavorful shredded pork, and fried dough?!?! What a deal!

I order a pizza and some suicide fries. 

I will say I loved the fries. Just hot enough that most will want to steer clear if you don't like spicy yet hot enough that those who love heat will enjoy. I will be back here for these alone. 

I will say I wasn't that impressed with the pizza. I have had better and worse in this town. I think this place might get some benefit to being a dive. It's what I call the food truck effect. Any food served from a food truck is automatically 3 to 4 times better than it actually is. Just because people like dives and loves food trucks. The pizza here is good but nothing amazing. I can see ordering pizza hear in the future but wont go out of my way for it. 

Last but not least on my second visit in under a week I had the suicide wings. They were just okay as well. Where did the heat go. Would have liked these much hotter. 

I say give this place a try if you like dive bars, but be warned if you take your rose colored glasses off it might just be a slightly above average place to eat.",AuC6R6-F2tZsISm7NIriOw,1,0,3,uawfMgUd94voJl1StJIAyg

Located in Moon Doggies, a little dive bar, this place is super laid back. Walk in all the way to the back and order from a tiny window.  After you order, you can hang out at the bar, knock a few back and play some Deuces Wild, or take a seat at one of the tables or booths. When your order is ready, they'll bring it out to you. Paper plates, napkins,  plastic utensils, and water are all self serve near the entrance. The music is blaring, so you kinda have to be a loud conversationist. They were playing punk rock and ska when I've been. 

As for the food,  the pizza isn't the greatest, but good enough for the price. The crust is thin and a little hard. They used these tiny little pepperonis that reminds me of frozen pizza.  The portions are generous, though,  and you can order their special of the day by the slice. My favorite special so far was the chicken fried steak, with chicken finger pieces (I think) and country gravy. So good! I regret not ordering a full pie... 

I usually get the poutine, too, the frickin huge size (good to share with 3-4 people. I don't have anything to compare it to, but I think it's tasty. The gravy is runny, but flavorful (the cheese curds not so much). 

Another item I always order is the zeppoles. Deep fried pizza dough, covered in powdered sugar :D They come stuffed in a brown paper bag (how charming) served with chocolate syrup.  I like to take them home and doctor em up. Sprinkled with cinnamon, or dipped in caramel, with a nice cuppa coffee, they're addictive. You get a lot of em, but they're best fresh,  so if you have a lot left over, just nuke em for a few seconds prior to enjoying.",Sn7SkFeZZTLqapjFf3d16Q,1,0,3,PGsWzdG2z1t1SeBSeMzYcg

The egg rolls were stuffed with pepperoni and mozzarella cheese in an egg roll wrapper and then deep fried.  They were good, but nothing special. 

We got two types of pizza. The first was the guineas pie.  Meatballs, spinach, white garlic sauce, and ricotta.  The second was the bacon and egg pizza with arugula, pancetta, white sauce, and brown eggs.  Both pizzas were good, at least the toppings were.  The thing I don't like about the pizzas was the crust.  It just didn't have enough flavor.  Very bland and chewy, needed salt. The meatballs had a lot of flavor and so did the white sauce.

We tried the Guinea's Pie and the Fatboy. The Guinea's pie came as a gooey, thick crust pizza. The crust itself on both pies were not doughy, but fluffy with just the right amount of crispness for that real oven baked taste and texture. Loaded with gooey mozzarella goodness and a white garlic sauce that isn't so strong that it overpowers the cheese, spinach and meatballs. 

The Fatboy was flavorful with its meaty toppings of salami, pepperoni, ham, italian sausage. Closer to what a traditional meatlovers pizza would be without overloading it so as not to overpower the taste of the tomatoes or the crust. Another very good pie.

French fries, gravy and cheese...simple enough yet not offered in most places on the west coast.
I walked into this place and wanted to walk back out. Moon Doggies is a smoked filled local dive bar that houses a pizza shop inside. I was determined to get my poutine fries and ventured inside. Finally put my order in after standing at window for only 15 minutes, I figured how bad could it be?
Fries were greasy, gravy was something I could have heated up from a jar, cheese curds looked like tapioca balls that I thought were supposed to melt into a gooey cheese blanket but alas no. Overall, a disappointing but should have known better from the looks inside experience.

I got 1 of each pizza - all cheese and Naked City. Also go the stuffed mushrooms and zeppoli.

For the pizza, the crust got a little soggy but the flavor, toppings, and cheese were great overall. The stuffing for the mushrooms was mostly sausage, I think. It was unpleasantly firm and lacked some flavor, though the sauce made up for that. The zeppoli also lacked some flavor - just tough dough with powdered sugar. Thankfully, there was some chocolate sauce for taste.

we walked in (just two of us) in front of a group of four or so people. The group that came in behind us sat behind us as well, and they had their food before we even were acknowledged and got a glass of water.
We tried asking the male waiter for water and he continued past us (ignored us!) and helped the table behind us, taking their order, bringing them several plates of food. The waitress then told us that the other waiter would help us. we were continued to be ignored.
i felt bad that it was the waitress' first day, but the other waiter was of no assistance to her (or us), which made the entire establishment look bad. He kept walking past our table to serve and check on the group that came behind us.
it took 20 minutes for a glass of water and an additional 5 to get my coke. we waited over a half hour for the garlic rolls (an appetizer) and about 50 minutes for a ""wee"" sized pizza. 
Meanwhile the group that came in behind us has had a ""not so wee"" sized pizza (medium), a couple orders or wings, etc. and the waiter kept bringing out plates for them while we sat with one glass of water. The group of people behind us finished and paid for their meal as our fricking appetizer was coming out.
the ONLY reason we didn't just walk away is human courtesy to the poor waitress on her first day.
Looks like this place needs to be on food network again for the show ""Restaurant Impossible!"" because the male waiter was a complete ass - either that or he was racist and ignored my boyfriend. I literally saw him make eye contact as we asked for help and he kept it moving to the group just past us...that came in after us!

4484338,2010-03-29,3,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Can somebody please tell me what all the hype going around this place is about? This tiny sandwich shop on Las Vegas Blvd. was recently opened by two chefs, one of whom is the chef at Diego restaurant in the MGM. My husband and I read a very positive review in the Weekly awhile back and decided to try it out. They were applauded for their house-cured and smoked meats, and the fact that everything ranging from pasta salad to pickles is made in house, except the bread. My husband is a big sandwich lover so was excited that there might be a unique new sandwich shop in town, and close to our house at that. The first time we ordered the Naked Chopped salad ($7.99) and the Naked Veggie sandwich ($8.99), which were both disappointing. The salad wasn't chopped at all but came with massive slices of so-so meat and a few boring vegetables. The Naked Veggie was served on semi-fresh pumpernickle bread that was so thick you hardly tasted anything but. The filling wasn't good either, with unseasoned veggies and a terrible eggplant ""stuffing"" (as if the sandwich needed more bread). We were disheartened to say the least but today decided to give it another try. They were still new when we first tried it so perhaps they needed some time to adjust. This time my husband got the Royal sandwich on a kaiser roll, that was still way too thick. The hot cappicola inside was good but basically it was an average sandwich that was too heavy on the bread. It came with a side of pasta salad that could have been great if it wasn't under-done and under-seasoned, a side of homemade giardinera (not bad), and a habanero pickle (spicy and tasty). I was  feeling under the weather so I ordered the tortilla soup ($3.99) which was hands down the worst tortilla soup I've ever had. It was completely one dimensional and tasted like tomato paste mixed with hot water. It is prepared with tons of avocado chunks (who likes that much hot avocado?) and the toppings consisted of cheddar cheese cubes, sour cream with chilies, and stale tortilla chips. You would think that a chef of a Mexican restaurant could make a decent tortilla soup but this was inedible. I had two bites and threw the rest away. I called to let the girl at the counter know how disappointed I was but all she could say was, ""Did you add all the toppings?"" ""Yes, but it probably would have been better if I hadn't"" I thought. Nothing could make that soup better. What we don't understand is why this sandwich place that is mediocre at best is getting all these rave reviews on Yelp! and other sites. If anyone has had a good experience there I'd love to hear it, along with a detailed explanation as to why. It seems to me that they need to stop spending so much time curing all their meats and start spending time making the food taste good.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,5,1,1,R-1wMdtTrQ_O3mb8jODJXQ

- Good pizza
- Relaxed atmosphere
- Off the busy strip

CONS:
- slow service when more than 3 tables are filled
- it's SO dark inside
- miscalculated check DOUBLE CHECK YOUR CHARGES!!

Pizza was yummy. I tired a Build Your Own, and the Guinea's. The Guinea's lacked the garlic flavor I was expecting, but the Build Your Own pizza we ordered was delicious thanks to the sauce and dough. The dough is crisp, yet doughy inside. Here are my ratings (1 - 10, 10 being highest) for items i tried:

Build Your Own: 8
Guinea's Pizza: 5
Suicide Fries: 7
Garlic Fires: 3 (needs garlic!)
Chicken Wing Dip: 7

I was very UNIMPRESSED about the check. Our group ordered a number of items from the menu and many of them were charged incorrectly on the bill. There were items that were $0.25 - $7.50 overchared.  Also, tax was incorrectly calculated as well. The waitress told me that each item price on the check included tax, but this was obviously incorrect since some items on the checked actually matched the menu price, while others were higher than the menu price. 

I hope the manager(s) decides to convert to a computerized system.",tZVMXfhjanIrCVaxLeT0XA,2,1,2,iv4TZDUCvMN9VA5zuFc9Gg

4611254,2017-12-26,0,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"I take no joy in giving a bad review. But, since I depend on good AND bad reviews when researching a new place, I think it's important.  That said...whoooo boy, was this place bad!  Really, really bad.

We planned a family trip to Vegas.  Knowing we'd come into town hungry, we decided to eat a quick meal away from the casinos.  We found a great deal on Restaurants.com and after reading the reviews, we thought this would fit the bill perfectly.

Some of the best places are found in dives or 'hole in the wall' spots, but our first impression was dismal. It was 3pm on a Saturday, there should have been some form of life. Instead, the room was dark and empty with a TV blaring Family Feud. The lone employee stood behind a small counter that didn't even have a hint that food might be found there.  Just a small, empty counter with a loney bathroom-type sink.  Most disconcerting was a total lack of scent!  Even if the kitchen was in back, we should smell that wonderful fragrance of pizza.  Nope. None.  Not even the merest suggestion that anyone had ate in that room that day.

We decided to press on, encouraged by all the signs saying how they had been featured on The Food Network  We ordered the Guinea Pie in the full sheet (knowing the teen boys and leftover pizza go together like teen boys and leftover pizza!)  At nearly $40, it was pricey, but FOOD NETWORK approved.  To take the edge off the long drive, we ordered the poutine fries as well.  Thirst, was another matter. A small retail-type cooler offering a modest selection of small individual sodas and water was the only option.  We ordered and began to wait. And wait....

And wait.

After 25 minutes, we began to realize that we had made a huge mistake.  The lady behind the counter would leave for stretches to get supplies from the bar, but never interacted with us.   After 30 minutes, we wondered why we had not at least received the poutine.  I mean, unless you are growing potatoes, it should not take that long to make fries.  After nearly 40 minutes, a couple of boxes were handing to us, and she again disappeared.

The poutine was cold. Dead cold. No gravy, some sad-looking white clods and limp fries that were as frigid as Melania Trump. We immediately sent them back to the kitchen to be reheated.  The pizza was even more disappointing. The thin, uneven edges looked like a too-small amount of dough had been stretched to make it fit a large pan.  They were over-cooked and saturated in a deep coating of oil.  The toppings were not even remotely to the edges; actually starting at the 2nd piece in. 
The sliced meaballs were overcooked to the consistency of dog chew treats.  Then I lifted up the oily mass to expose an actual undercooked crust. Seriously, how much skill is needed to both undercook AND overcook a single pizza? After a single bite, my sons and I threw down the pizza in disgust. My husband, however, doesn't like the make rush judgements and braved a second bite.  The vote was unanimous: this was hands-down the worst pizza we had even eaten.

How bad does things have to be to request a refund from a Restaurants.com coupon?  We hated to do this, but we were about to leave a restaurant after a single bite (or two!)  The lady apologized, refunded our money and then gave us the nearly reheated box of poutine for the road.  In the car, we each braved a bite to see if our decision had been too rash.  Uh...no.  We pulled over and threw it in the nearest trash.

We have found some amazing gems in different cities using Restaurants.com and Yelp.  It's a great set of tools to use when you want to avoid chains and discover something new. In this instance, we took a gamble and lost.  I'd have to advise you to pass this one up.",pbKRmieartVZJprVRDhvVQ,0,0,1,vUPlIGlbDQB3pBDpQCpuFg

After zip lining down Fremont Street, we decided to hit up Naked City to use up my $20 Groupon. That got us a large Poutine ($5), 20 Hot Chicken Wings ($13), and a slice of cheese pizza ($2). The pizza slice was for my friend. I had no interest in trying it.

So how was the Poutine? I can't compare to the Poutine I've had in Toronto because it's been a couple of years. For sure, it was Freakin' Huge. That's actually the size designation - Freakin' Huge (not ""large"" as I stated earlier). I'm not really sure if they use cheese curds, but it was yummy and gooey, albeit slightly salty after a while. It's definitely something you could share with a few people.

The Chicken Wings were also good. It's not hard to make good wings, but I suppose it's not hard to mess them up either. My cousin said she really enjoyed them, but she admitted that she's been craving wings recently. I give them the thumbs up. They were pretty large too.

Located inside a run down bar, this place looks a little sketchy. The parking lot is not very well maintained, and the bar itself is dimly-lit and old. But don't let that deter you from the fact that the pizzas here are amazing. 

Our table got the Frickin' Huge Naked City Pizza, and the pizza definitely lives up to the name. The pizza came in a 13"" x 9"" sheet pan. This pizza definitely feeds about 7-8 people and costs only $30, so that's a deal right there! The toppings on this pizza are pretty standard: pepperoni, sausage, sweet peppers, onions, olives, mozzarella cheese, and red sauce. Both the pepperoni and sausage add a spiciness and saltiness to the pie. The olives and cheese also added to the saltiness and greasiness, while both the sweet peppers and onions were overshadowed by the other ingredients. I think the best part of the pie was the crust. The crust was thin, crispy, and flaky. It balanced out the fat from the toppings. 

The service was definitely way below average. Since it's a bar, you have to order the pizza from the back / from the bartender. There is no table service at this place. After you order, you're pretty much left on your own. Wait time for the pizza was actually pretty reasonable for the size of the pie. But other than that, you'd have to get our own water, plates, utensils, and napkins. All are located in one area, so that's convenient. But the tap water tasted a little weird, so I'd steer away from that and just bring your own. 

Overall, the pizzas here are really good. When it comes to craving super greasy foods, this is the place you should go. Even though the location is a little sketchy and the service is below par, I would still recommend this place.",jVmVkhZ8NX0eGk5DhSeNUA,3,2,4,yMYbgN9KwAu8NDsi0SD59w

Like most people that travel to Vegas, I heard about NCPS via DDD on the Food Network. This might be silly to say, but the thing that drew me in was the sound of a pizza cutter slicing through the sound enhanced crispy crust of one of their pies on TV.

The atmosphere is obviously a dive bar. Since we came while the sun was up, it wasn't noisy and not crowded in any respect. I'm sure if we came a little later in the day, it would have been standing room only, as there really isn't a LOT of room to sit.

We ordered a wee guinea pie and a wee loaded fries. The fries were a bit on the salty/over-seasoned side, but the sour cream, bacon and cheese helped cut through the saltiness. The pizza... oh the pizza...

The pizza was FANTASTIC. I'm usually not one for ""white"" pizzas, but this was really well done. The sauce wasn't overpowering but still had a great flavor that complimented the meatballs and spinach. The crust tasted just as good as it looked, it was thick without being too heavy or greasy. Overall, it was a very well made pie.

In a nutshell: The atmosphere isn't for everyone, but the food and service were top notch, enough for me to make another trip here next time I'm in Vegas.",QNb1ffvoWAJIdF0hF5B5DA,1,1,4,V36A9QpqHtgHq8D5ZaAMdQ

If you are more a red sauce fan this pie is for you! This place is very casual and a great place to go if you are looking for something low key.

Love my dive bars. Always my go-to hang out spots. So for a late night beer and carby greasy food, come here!

Here, you go to the bar grab your drinks, and at the opposite of the end of the bar is a small window where you order your ""I will regret this later"" food. 

I went with a friend here since I hear a lot of rave about the place. I noticed by the entrance door they have plates, napkins, and utensils. You sit yourself, you grab whatever you need and enjoy. They do bring out your food to your table though. 

I tried the poutine. Not too bad. Not sure if Canadians will like it, but yanno. Might have to come back and try other special fries they had in the menu. 

Zeppoles in a greasy brown paper bag. Eat them fresh! These sugary, thick bread dumped in chocolate is really tasty! Generous amount in the bag! 

The pizza, I wasn't a fan of. I had to rip it up to eat it. It was way hard and I couldn't finish it. Noticed the roof of my mouth torn and cut up too after eating the pizza. Cut to where I tasted my own blood....and the pizza was the last thing I ate.  

Anyway, this is a divey bar. Don't expect clean elegance. Expect a rough looking bar with fattening huge portioned (sharing is optional) bar food and good beer. Give it a shot.",GLFFf8XbOoRJuxZxGfUd8g,4,3,3,ne5PBc04UDuGgOG0G3T0Zg

I recalled an episode of Triple D mentioning Naked City Pizza. So I googled the Arville location.  Drove from the hotel to the place. I saw the sign which said Moondoogies bar with Naked City Pizza underneath, a lil confusing because the entrance is just a divey bar, luckily I got a whiff of some nice pizza pie. 

The place itself had a dark ambiance of a real dive bar, I did feel like I was an intruder from the looks I got from the indigenous bar flies. I made beeline past the bar towards one of the waitresses who quickly glanced me up and down, to size me up ""Tourist"".  She had a nice ink sleeve going on but had a rather nice sunny disposition. 

So I ordered a couple of pies. A wee plain cheese for the kids and a not so wee Naked City Pizza Pie for us. It took awhile like almost a half hour, so it would be helpful to order ahead of time, which I did not do.  The pizzas were spot on. Glad I braved the iffy location, Better then the crap from CPK (which I know isn't saying much)

I knew what to expect before walking into Moon Doggies and had been looking forward to trying this pizza for a long time.  It was my heavyset brothers that finally got me to go and I'm very glad I did.

I expected the service to be downright garbage and was very suprised to have an attentive and polite waiter.  We order two Not So Wee pizzas along with some Pizza Logs and Poutine.  The pizza logs were incredible but the poutine was a little cold in the middle.  It still tasted good but cold cheese is not something on my 'favorites' list.  The pizza were great as well and this has to be one of my favorite types of crust ever.  Fairly thick but also pretty light tasting.  We were all big fans of this place and were very glad we came.

I think Naked City Pizza has a good thing going but it would be nice if they could get their own stand-alone place.  That's just me.

I've been coming here for YEARS and I've never found any other pizza as good as Naked city. The Poutine Fries are to Die for (my mouth is watering) the gravy it come in is made there, they add chunks of Mozzarella and they season the fries to perfection. I'm old school when it comes to pizza so I typically have Pepperoni and cheese but I have also had a few others. One of my favorite is the Back Home Pizza it has Mozzarella, Pepperoni and Italian Sausage, the pepperoni has a perfect crunch around the edges, the Italian sausage is has the perfect amount of seasoning and the Mozzarella is stringy how a cheese should be. I don't know how they do it but the food in all the years I've been here is consistent and never disappoints. P.S. they have cheap drinks and who doesn't love cheap drinks???

5050235,2011-02-12,4,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"""I didn't know it was a take and bake pizza."" 

I took a bite of the crust as I love a good crust and that bite was really yeasty/doughy. I looked at the dough where I bit and was still translucent so therefore still raw. I grabbed from the other side of the pizza my 2nd slice, without crust. That was cooked, but still needed to be baked for a better consistency. I looked carefully at the pizza and the dough was rolled unevenly so the sloppy base made for the uneven cook. Like Angela stated about the sauce- she had a slice with no sauce and I had a slice that I could see the sauce present without digging for it. 

Shouldn't have to re-bake or watch each bite for raw spots when Angela H and I were plenty happy to wait 20 minutes to get a 'za but could wait longer if it meant not rushing to get it done. I looked at the crust on peoples pictures and can see those are brown and toppings like pepperoni are crisping at the edges. Just so people don't think I'm just looking for something to hate (though my review pattern is rarely negative) please look at the pictures. I posted a piece of pizza with all the toppings off so you can see the crust thickness change and the pale pizza crust and bottom. I'm sure some people will say ""it's just a bad day"" but uneven pizza dough and sauce is careless and seeing the crust isn't even brown but choosing to box it up anyways isn't the pride and quality control I'd expect from a raved about place. Yes, I cook some shit wrong, made a new recipe and it sucked- not for lack of care but inexperience. I've cooked certain things over and over (like you do at a restaurant) and can keep a decent standard on such items because I baby it and won't serve what isn't at least cooked well. 

 It LOOKED good, SMELLED good on the drive back home, the toppings were quality, but if you don't have the dough down right, cooked right then it isn't a fucking pizza. Might as well put those toppings on some sandwich rolls so I can enjoy the nicely spice-y sausage bits, red pepper, olives and pepperoni. Grease doesn't bother me too much, but just a note there was a good amount of it to dab off. $17 for a large and the only consolation I suppose is the groupon. Also we got cheese bread which gives me visions of dough bits with cheese. We got a sandwich roll stuffed with some cheese, mostly spinach and chopped garlic. I'd be cool with a spinach sandwich but it needed more seasonings other than the garlic so it was just A-OK. 

The settings really don't help. Neither of us was aware of what Moondoggies was about and partly wasn't sure if we have the right place without any pizza indicators on the outside. Odd that there isn't even a little sign... Alright, odd that it's in a bar, but I can dig it like how some  PTs have Robertos tacos attached. It's not quite separate but connected to the bar situation, but just a window on the wall of the bar where you can order.  It was just an odd vibe for two ladies to walk into a bar full of men with a few stopping to look at what we were doing. Odd vibes and no real seating aside from the bar or pool table, we hightailed our plans of staying in and took it to-go. Takes a lot to make two loud, social with all kinds of people kind of bitches want to just go home instead of stay in a environment. It wouldn't have been a place we could have comfortable conversation. 

I don't get the hype. I don't know about second chances with this one.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,6,1,apum3S-4jdTGGQR4ZE4FWg

Welllllllll I guess you can. The pizza was bland, not enough marinara. The dough was undercooked (even though it took 50 minutes to prepare) and the chicken fingers...they were more like chicken pieces half cooked on the pizza. It was just missing something! I also ordered suicide fries! I love spicy food. I order a 10 in Indian and Thai food and eat grilled peppers as a snack. But these fries were tasteless. They were JUST spicy. They taste as if someone just poured hot sauce and threw on some jalapeños. Nothing special.

That was the first sign that we were in trouble. We ordered 2 wee pizzas and then one of the really big ones split between two flavors (the Naked City and the Guinea). The kitchen reportedly messed up and made those as two separate medium sized pizzas (not a big deal at all) except that they forgot about the Guinea all together, so they made one for us about an hour and a half into the experience. Then another server took our fresh pizza and took it to another table, so then that had to make another. We actually never got the original order until after we had paid and were walking out the door three hours into the journey. We brought home the Guinea and reheated it for dinner and it was awesome.

I was already pressed for time, and I told her that when I saw that the pizza came out.   Thank goodness it was still hot!  The cheese was cheesy, and the pizza was really good.

I had been to Moon Doggies years ago and thought it was a cool little dive bar and the food at Naked City Pizza fits right into that category. Dive bar food. Ordered the ""Back Home Pizza"" online (bonus points for easy online ordering!) and got the half sheet for $18. Pictures online and on Yelp looked pretty good. Was ready when I arrived (on time) and my small interaction with the person at the window was not enough to judge service. Soon as we walked out I opened box and knew I had probably made a mistake. This did not look as good as it did in the pics and it looked like cheap ingredients. I was right.
I regretfully devoured 4 slices as I was pretty hungry. But that doesn't change the fact that I was wishing I had a better pizza to eat. I can't speak for the rest of the food there as this was all I got.
They get 3 stars only because its fair (I guess) for the price and its in a dive bar so I shouldn't have expected as much as I did. Drunk food is all I can say it is at this point.",sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ,2,0,3,hKJzLutlstkuPMKA5lPhrQ

So this place is kind of uninviting. It is inside Moondoggies bar, which is dark and musty. Adults only kind of place, so leave the kids at home (or go to the other location...).

For drinks, I ordered the loganberry because I have never had anyting loganberry. Server said it was pretty popular in New York.  It was hard to describe the taste, but most like a watered down berry juice. Next time I'll just have some ""pop.""

I shared the small size Guinea pie with Ramil B. and it was the perfect size for us.  It was cut in 6 pretty good size pieces and I was still able to take 2 pieces home to the husband who loved it.  The pizza here is definitely a winner and I would come back to order it again!  Some great things about it are the homemade meatballs and the ricotta cheese!  Kind of on the greasy side, but crust was on point. 

We were curious about dessert and ordered the fried dough, which was a humongous portion that I just took it home.  This was OK, not worth ordering. It simply was fried, drizzled with chocolate syrup and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Nothing exciting here.

You have 2 options, deal with it, or really take it to go. As soon as we cracked open the square box, the aroma of tomatoes and fresh basil completely infiltrated our mind, body and soul. OMFG, the pizza was astonishing. It seems to me NY pizza is kind of favored here in Vegas. This is not the same thing at all. The crust is thicker, a little soft with slightly crispy edges. It is all loaded with plenty of groceries, and I mean quality items too. WOW! Perfect ratio of crust, to sauce, to toppings. Check this out, we did not ask for, nor did we need any extra parmesan or red pepper flakes. The sauce is zesty, with a welcome kick. Daily doses of ""The Fatboy"" could keep me from being slim.

A full sheet is 24 slices and the generous amount of toppings on a pie of that size easily wiped out a garden and slaughtered a couple hogs. Unless I'm up against a bet you can take my yelp tagline and toss it. The in-house meatballs and pepperoni they use are top notch, the dough is a perfect texture and taste, the quality cheese is plentiful (see pics of my guinea pie) and it eats well the next day...(5 minutes at 350 followed by 2 minutes at 400 to get it nice and crispy with a perfect melt). If you want a tasty pie, you can't go wrong with the Rebel (used to be called the Fat Boy) or the Guinea pie which was featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives.

Other unique items I've tried were the poutine fries, which were excellent, as were the pizza logs. Got to love the creative menu of delicious bar food made using quality ingredients.

They also stay open til 3am which is conveniently dangerous for the waistline.

In fact, the pinnacle of Las Vegas-style patio dining just might be at Naked City. If you know Las Vegas patio dining, you know it means overlooking a parking lot. Well, here you not only overlook the parking lot, you pretty much sit in it and also overlook OG. Sandwich, Strippers, Custard (at Luv- It's)--I have a feeling that is a common Friday trio, but not for Gabi and me. We stuck to the Naked City that was serving lunch.

I was a bit sad that the Naked Greens weren't baby greens and sadder that it took what I consider a long time to get our order. The turkey was definitely good and real. Overall, a solid sandwich, but I don't know if the thought of it lingers with me. I think that is the mark of an outta this world sandwich--a lingering thought.

Open since 1999 and the focus of over a dozen visits, everything from the original on Arville to Naked City Tavern and even Chef Palmeri's menu for Bacon Bar the subject of discussion at some point in the last four years, it was finally in late April that Naked City Pizza Delivery was experienced in the form of catering for twenty, the results expectedly not *quite* as good as fresh from the oven, though not far off either. 

No doubt a fan of the Restaurant with four current locations, Michael and Chris' newest spot inside The El Cortez recently visited and soon to be enjoyed again for ""Paula's Supper Club"" on May 1st, it was to a smorgasbord of favorites that staff was treated, Caesar Salad with Housemade Dressing proving a popular choice for those looking for something light while Wings tossed to Medium spiciness were called ""the best I've ever tasted by one"" and ""not spicy enough"" by others.

Wowing skeptics next with Pizza Logs, the listed Pepperoni replaced with housemade Fennel Sausage to great effect  beneath  a crisp and golden Shell, it was from four 'half-sheets' of Pizza that attendees were allowed to pick, the two orders of Cheese selected by the Rep to 'be safe' largely leftover as staff found Naked City's DDD-famous Guinea Pie and Chicken Finger slices most enjoyable though the eponymous Pie with Onions and Roasted Peppers also proved popular for those who didn't worry about their breath for the second half of the day.

Rounding out the afternoon with Palmeri's best-in-Sin-City Cannolis, the normally filled-to-order shells holding up even better than Pizza Crust which has suffered just a touch of sog in transit, suffice it to say that all were more than satisfied by a lunch of good ingredients cooked by people who are putting their time, money and hard work on the line to do something they love...and if you happen to see a Social Media post suggesting Monkey Logs are available do not hesitate to place an order for them.

N/A:  In a city of two million with over forty million visitors annually it is probably no surprise that independently owned businesses often take a backseat in terms of advertising, but when considering options for catering nothing is more disappointing than the number of dollars being funneled into spots like BJ's, PF Chang's or Café Rio - money that would much better support Las Vegas' small businesses if people would just wake up and stop being so lazy.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,12,5,DkOsYpvc95HctjA9J5QRag

I had 2 pieces of pizza by the slice:

Pepperoni slice: Wasn't very good at all. You don't expect pizza by the slice to be fresh so I was willing to overlook the fact that it tasted old, but I don't think that it was originally a pepperoni pizza. It looked and tasted like it was a slice of cheese pizza that they just threw some pepperoni on top of and heated up because the pepperoni wasn't heated through like it should've been had it spent as much time in the oven as the rest of the pizza.

Chicken Parm (slice of the day): This was actually pretty good besides the fact that it too, tasted like it had been out a long time. The crust that they use is a little thicker than I prefer but the breaded chicken on it was tasty. 

Philly cheesesteak rolls: First off they give you 4 big rolls for 7 bucks which is an awesome value. The first bite wasn't overly impressive but these things are addicting and get better with every bite. Crispy egg roll shell, steak, onions and peppers, and cheddar some how come together into this crunchy, savory, and cheesy bite of goodness.

Chicken Fingers: Looking at them I thought they may be frozen but they tasted fresh and very good. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside covered in a tasty buffalo sauce.

Overall, I liked my meal. I'm not going to be extra critical on the pizza that I knew wouldn't be fresh. The prices are very reasonable, food was tasty, people were friendly. I'd go back but would try fresh pizza ;).",wt6x85nZ_JVEjHG1Mh_fNw,0,0,4,uvLo0QcXf6HphBw8b-wmPQ

That's just it, this place is all about the hype. Yes, it's a decent pie, but the toppings were sparse. The pizza also isn't anything that you can't find elsewhere and it just doesn't stand out. It's good, but not great and definitely not remember-able. 

Where NCP excels is in the sammie & fry departments. There are unique offerings and tasty combos. Suicide fries offer a mighty kick and are best served with milk to kill the fire. Not for the faint of heart. My go to sub is The Guinea which as a pizza is meh; when translated to sandwich is crave-able. (I'm salivating as I write this!) With it's combination of house-made Italian sausage, sweet and hot peppers, onion and ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese! This is a sandwich worth driving across town for. 

I also had one of the best Osso Buco of my life here. It was a weekly special and it was tender and juicy.

I often see posts about them going there, without me, and I will be honest I get a little agitated. I have to tell myself that them getting it at 10pm or later is a good reason for me not to feel too bad about being excluded, but it stings. 

Maybe I have low standards for atmosphere, but I just do not care how a place looks as long as they produce good quality food and I am not in immediate danger of getting shanked. It is true that this establishment is located in a poorly light bar, but the drinks are cheap and the food more than makes up for it.

I have only been there once, and I can only think about how delicious the Guinea's pie was. For me, the true test of a pizza is whether I am willing to eat it's crust. I am not a huge fan of crust because it can be too doughy or dry. With Naked City Pizza, I found that I was not a particular fan of the middle slices of the rectangular pizza because there was no contrast to the gooey toppings. This would be one of the first times that I did not force myself to eat the crust and just enjoyed it. 

The wings, I love wings and seem to always be in the mood for them. Ordering with friends that do not handle spicy food too well, we decided to go with hot instead of suicide. I found them to be delicious, although not as fiery as I would like. They still proved too hot for the sensitive individuals in our party, so watch out. When I get the chance I would hope to try the suicide and confirm if they are something to write about. 

We also had the cobb salad in a vain attempt to justify everything else we ordered. The crispy cuts of bacon, chunks of blue cheese and dressing was just a reminder of how delusional we were.

We get the medium size which is called ""Not So Wee"", good size for dinner plus left overs. We've tried the ""Fat Boy""  with Salami, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, roma tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. 
 If you like a meaty pie, this is for you! Our latest order was for ""The Stinger"" with Chicken fingers, sirloin steak, mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, bleu cheese, sweet and hot peppers and onions. I could actually do without the steak, it was more like the meat you get on a cheesesteak, it didn't do much for the taste. We got the fingers on the pie with medium hot sauce, it was yummy. I dipped mine in some ranch dressing. I dig this pie.

5391793,2011-09-08,3,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Naked City Pizza Shop, hidden inside Moon Doggies Bar.  

I've been to Moon Doggies a few times over the years.  It's a nice dive bar with real character.  It's a good change in a town where it's hard to find such places.  Going here is a little intimidating the first time around, but definitely a fixture to this city.  Naked City is a welcomed addition to Moon Doggies; the previous pizza place that leased the kitchen was not that great and left the watering hole void of food offerings for a few years.  

This was my 2nd visit to Naked City, and we just can't seem to get away from the daily specials that the chef has to offer.  (The chef is also the owner, waiter, delivery driver, and busser)  

The special on our first visit was a hot roast beef dip.  The thing that set this apart from your average French Dip was the addition of horse radish sauce and a roll seasoned and toasted like garlic bread.  This was excellent.  The beef was also unique; it was roasted in house and cut thick, but still remained tender.  I hope this special becomes a regular item.

The second visit we tried the pulled pork Bolognese.  Extremely flavorful, but may be too bold for some.  This was a deliciously refined dish, much too soigne to be served in a dive bar.  However, this fancy plate of pasta fit perfectly with the approach of Naked City, offering unexpectedly great food in a blue collar setting.  

We also tried a few of the regular menu items between the past two visits:  The medium wings were very flavorful, but had a sweet note to them.  I'm a simple guy when it comes to me, so it wasn't my cup of tea.  The garlic knots were excellent, I really recommend.  The ""Naked City"" Pizza is very well executed.  We also tried the Poutine.  The Poutine is a must have and needs to go on everyone's bucket list as a must try before they die.

Naked City is losing a star for the location.  Food is amazing, but the neighborhood is a little scary, and the bar is extremely smoky.  I must also warn everyone, do NOT order soda from the bar, I don't think they have every changed or cleaned their soda lines in 20 years.  Stick with the hard liquor or beer.",KlD2U69cqxi01TelonOtxw,6,4,4,dpHH6DmNK6WgtghGoYYkeg

It was spicy but I was able to handle it. I can't say much about the Guinea Pie because my taste buds were over powered by the hotness of the fries. However, I do have left overs. 

I was disappointed that they don't have fountain drinks, had to get a can of coke. Nothing wrong with it, but by the time my food came out my coke was warm and there's no ice. I like my drinks ice cold. Also, expect to wait, I ate at the family side not at the bar.

We ordered Back Home Pie, chicken wings and Paper Bag Zeppoles. The Back Home Pie was greasy as hell, omg I broke out looking at it, the crust was good but the sauce just soaked up all of the center pieces. I had one piece and that's all I could swallow. The chicken wings were average. The Paper Bag Zeppoles were gross and we threw it out. The costumer service was great, but probably won't be ordering the Back Home Pie or Paper Bag Zeppoles again. Now I have heart burn along with a broken heart.


Update #3: Maybe... third times the charm? Um... nope from 2 to 1 star. And it really sucks because I really wanted to love this place.  I wanted to tell my friends this was an awesome spot to go to. We ordered a pizza to bring to a friend's house warming party but it was mistakenly made at the wrong location. One thing which would have solved this problem was when they answered the phone they followed their greeting with the location. Once we went to pick up our pizza they explained to us that they didn't have it and they wanted us to drive to the other location to get it. We weren't going to drive 30 minutes out of our way to get the pizza so we wanted to reorder the pizza. The guy refused to make us the pizza... told us he was wasting product. I want to point out that his reaction was of a man who had this kind of thing happen to him all of the time. They also had a slice of the day deal and they could have easily sold the other pizza. We ended up going to metro pizza. 

I don't know why we keep on trying to go here. The place is filled with smoke because they are located in a bar. I think they are separate because I always get good service from the bartender.

So, we decided to order pizza at work and really wanted Naked City.  We'd heard so many great things about the pizza and were seriously salivating after looking at the menu online.

The location on Paradise is closest to us, so we tried to place an order online.  The website is horrible and wouldn't allow us to place an order, so I called.  Unfortunately, the person I spoke with was totally clueless. She said she didn't think they had a delivery driver yet and to call back in 15 minutes or to try the other (this) location.

So, I called the Arville location.  The young lady I spoke with was very friendly, but said that we were out of their delivery area.  I explained the situation and how the Paradise location had bascially said they couldn't help us, even though we are less than a mile from them.  The kitchen manager ended up getting on the line and she was awesome.  I explained to her what happened and she said that, although they typically don't deliver to our area, they would take our order and get everything straightened out.

We placed a fairly large order:

Pizza logs - Hand rolled egg roll wrappers stuffed with pepperoni, mozzarella and red sauce. These were good, but VERY greasy. Beware.  Also, the cheese was not evenly distributed and the red sauce was on the side (for some reason I expected it to be inside).

Guinea's Pie - Featured on Diners, Drive Ins & Dives Meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese. VERY good.  Although I had to add red pepper flakes for a little spice.

Steak and Cheese Pizza - Sirloin steak, three cheese mix, sweet and hot peppers, onion and white garlic sauce. My favorite that we ordered! It was really good and super cheesy and the jalapeno added good heat.

Fatboy Pizza - Salami, pepperoni, ham, Italian sausage, roma tomato, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and red sauce. My least favorite. Not because it was bad, but it was just typical pizza. The other 2 pizzas were somewhat unique, and this wasn't. It was good, but just didn't compare to the others.

Overall, it was expensive (basically $90 for everything, including delivery fee and tip). Not something we would order often, but the 3 ""not so wee"" sized pizzas were HUGE and we still have leftovers.

I am really happy that Nicole, the kitchen manager agreed to assist us. Unlike the Paradise location, she didn't turn us away and was happy to make things right.  It's things like that that will make me order again.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,7,3,4,C7LC7sjCltU17cp7nFAvIQ

The restaurant was closed when we arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday night but moon doggies next door is open til 3am and has a window to order. We opted to eat in and I have mixed feelings about the experience. For one: the pizza was really yum so credit where credit is due. But two: moon doggies is the epitome of a dive bar and I can't really get on board with a place that allows smoking within the establishment.

For pizza, I'd recommend the Guinea Pie, which was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. I believe we also got the Naked City Pizza, just for classic's sake. The pizzas themselves are okay. Vegas is full of delicious pizza and I can't in good conscience say that this was the best one I've had while in sin city. That being said, the pizza here is pretty solid so if you can handle the secondhand smoke and sticky floors, you're in for a real treat.

Note: also featured on triple D was the suicide fries which--for those that have a propensity for spicy foods--would probably be at the top of the ""to-try"" list while stopping in.

Parking is available in a small adjacent lot. The area is not the safest so if you're stopping in late late then make sure you bring a buddy! (Or two, or three.. there's a bar here you could actually just hang out for a while).",2PpCp3l1c_yzcY236ptEKg,0,0,4,MtVEUZNxmkEzLrRGsVZ4wg

4 adults 

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 5 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - We are here because of Food Networks Diners, Drive Up and Dives.  The bonus is that is a Buffalo NY pizza place!  I was born in Buffalo and visit my family out there, I wish I could visit more often.

Atmosphere - A bar with a kitchen.  As we walked up I noticed a sign indicating you must be over 21 to enter.  Very rare in Nevada, I do not think I have seen a sign like this since my last visit to North Dakota.  So a cozy dimly lit place filled with Buffalo Bills and Sabres stuff.  We sat at a curved booth and noticed right away that the table would rock badly if any weight was put on it.

Food
  Drink - Normally I do not comment on it but since this all about Buffalo I will.  So I asked if they had Genny, for those who don't know that is Genesse out of Rochester NY.  They did not have it.  So she started listing off so common Canadian beers that you can get in Buffalo.  Then she said Loganberry, my wife said I lit up like a kid on Christmas day.  It is a hybrid berry that they make into a drink, I love it!

  Appetizer - Wings of course, 20, two orders, a hot and medium.  I think we got all hot which was fine with me.  Good size, all had a good amount of meat on them. 

  My Main Course - Duh pizza!  We got a half tray.  Memories of eating pizza in Buffalo in my Aunt and Uncle's house flood me.  The tray reminds of grade school of lunch room pizza, this aint that pizza!  We ordered half pepperoni and half cheese.  The best thing about Buffalo pizza is that the pepperoni's, they are tiny compared to standard pepperoni.  When they cook they curl up to hold the grease.  These little pieces are heaven on a bed of cheese.  The pizza was loaded with cheese and was so gooey. 

  Dessert - Really I gorged myself on pizza!

Service - 0ne waitress worked about 8 tables, and she worked it!  Bonus is that she is from Buffalo!

Future - I can see future visits to this place on my visits to Vegas!",gVO3VZwCu54Otc7bUB33Mg,1,1,4,vniOHlzk_EAhVZRfzo7efw

Didn't realize before that the restaurant itself was IN the bar, but it really wasn't that bad.  It's a little dark, but the place isn't horrible to be in overall.   
Ordered a ""Wee"" sized pepperoni pizza which was HUGE.  It fed me and my girlfriend and we still had two slices left over.  I caught a glimpse of the famous Suicide fries on the table next to us, so I decided to ask the waitress exactly how hot they were.  She said, on a scale of 1 -10....  she would rate them at a 10 1/2.  She offered me a sample of the suicide sauce that the fries are smothered in and I accepted.   Just a small taste of the sauce warmed my entire mouth and my throat.  The sauce tasted amazing and despite the heat, I still couldn't resist dipping some of my pizza crust in it throughout the meal.  
Since my girlfriend doesn't appreciate spicy food like I do, we went with an order of the garlic fries.  You could tell they were homemade and they were AMAZING.  Hot salty fries with fresh garlic and covered in Parmesan Cheese and spices. 
Took one star off because of the service.  The waitress was really nice, but she never asked us if we wanted a drink until our food was almost gone, and I couldn't get her attention at all throughout the meal. Seeing that my mouth was still on fire from the suicide sauce, I almost jumped the bar to get my own.  However, when she did come over she was really nice and was quick to help us when she did finally notice.  
Also, place was really cheap.  We ordered the Wee sized pizza, two drinks and some garlic fries and the total was $20.

I ordered the bacon and egg pizza, my friend the marghertia pizza. The wee one is $13 and contains 6 squares (not slices) but its plenty filling as I could only eat two before being full. I found the flavor delicious, the crust was thick but cooked right. It was a pretty good pizza.

The bartender was excellent, very entertaining, and kept up with the crowd as the place filled up to capacity within a half hour. It took about 40 minutes for our pizza to get done which is a little long, but they were doing lots of take out orders as well as servicing the customers in the bar.

First off, the place is tiny.  There are a few stools and a bar to eat at so you should consider take out if you're with a larger group or if it's during the rush.

I tried the Naked Royal which is a warm sandwich with Italian sausage, hot capicola, and fresh mozzarella cheese.  It was fantastic.  Great balance of flavor between the sausage and capicola.  It's served with your choice of homemade pickle, various pasta or potato salads, and homemade pickled vegetables.

These guys make everything fresh on site except the bread.  Sides, pickles, and even freshly roasted deli meats.  As such, the choice of sandwiches is small but that's good because they can focus on quality.

BUT the food is terrific. The guinea pizza is yummy with the fresh, chewy mozarella and the crust to crunch on! When they say hot chicken wings, believe them and order milk! But still tasty while dripping from the heat! Not daring enough to try the suicide fries but the garlic fries had the same texture that made in n out famous. By the way, the portions are outrageously huge!!!! the 'Wee' size (smallest) could easily feed a family of four. Then save room for the canoli for a dessert lovers dream. Not too sweet, just delicious!",an4Q16pHp_5RkoM9H6Wdvg,0,1,4,Fn7Z_n4IhMDBRBVnvOtTkg

They arrived in a Togo box, more than 25 minutes after they were ordered and they were soggy. I was willing to give these baked/fried wings a chance but they just didn't do it for me, and I tried 3 different types of wings, Sicilian, medium and BBQ. Sicilian was by far the best. I did however order a steak and cheese that was fire! Steak was seasoned perfect and it had the right amount of spice. The pizza was good because the cheese was perfectly cooked on the top but the crust wasn't all that. It was an experience all together but somewhat inconvenient for dine-in and the trip to the bar next door for drinks was just odd. Luckily, they have a friendly service crew to keep the hungry patrons happy while they wait.",JKsDUKDiiJFGxr9S3IkYmg,0,0,3,ws4CMImo2KwIL_W7elwWdg

Just taste the salty sausage and not much else. They need to add pickled veggies or something to counterbalance the saltiness of the sausage. Overall, cant complain too much since it was a great value at $10. Don't go here for the Ambiance though.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,1,0,3,iPcfqxzuE9NLqFVHIfcHzQ
5910061,2013-01-14,1,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Let me start by saying that I did see this place on DDD. My girl and I make it a point to try at least one place recommended in a City by Guy. It's killing me that people are slamming this place for being a Dive, when they were warned, told, cautioned or whatever Word you want to use, that its a Dive. Sorry, I hate bad reviews for an Owner trying to make it and somebody slams his dream and future success for nothing. Rant over. That night we had a Wee size Steak and Cheese Pizza, Ceaser salad (small) and Sicilian flavored wings. The Pizza was very good to judge it by Pizza Hut standards is just not fair. This Pizza from dough to oven looks hand made and the taste is the same. The cheese could have more generous but the flavor for what we had was amazing just as it was. The salad was good. Not your typical Ceasar but very good. Now lets talk about the wings, THE SICILIAN WINGS WERE ARGUABLY THE BEST FLAVOR COMBINATION I HAVE EVER TASTED. we had an order of 8 and as stuffed as we were I wish we had ordered more. Do yourself a favor and try them. Ambiance was as a Bar should be. Minus the Bills decor ( Saints fan here) lol. We can't wait to go back and this time we'll skip the salad to make room for more Wings. Or maybe just order more wings. Lol. Great place. Service was just as you would get in a Bar and very knowledgable about the Menu. Try this place. If you have kids order ahead and take it back to your Hotel, you won't be sorry.",XLD6kubIF2PxJf5s7cAzCw,1,1,4,fF3tC7lnOph6vBe2vkOqIQ
5924311,2013-09-10,0,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Came here for a late lunch on Saturday. Both the Moon Doggies bartender and waitress for the NCP seating area were friendly. The two of us ordered the stuffed mushrooms, he ordered the beef on weck, and I tried a slice of the pepperoni (I like to order a piece of just cheese or pepperoni to test how tasty a place's most basic pizzas are without adding other flavors into the mix yet).

For the stuffed mushrooms, $9 seemed kind of steep for 6 small ones. They were decently tasty, & accompanied by a creamy sauce & strips of mild peppers, but I wouldn't pay $9 for them again.

The beef on weck resembled what it was supposed to be, though the meat was thinner & more overcooked than you'd usually see, it didn't come with any horseradish or a pickle, and the bun didn't seem to have been dipped in au jus (all normal hallmarks of this type of sandwich). Overall, it was a fairly boring version of beef on weck that neither of us would likely get again.

The pepperoni pizza had two kinds of cheeses -- a bottom layer of sliced cheese that tasted like provolone, and shredded mozzarella sprinkled on top, only partially melted. It felt and tasted overall like an undercooked frozen pizza. I wouldn't order it again, either. Though it was a good size (TWSS), and it wasn't the worst $2.50 slice of pizza I've ever had (the dough/crust is pretty nice; soft on the inside, with a crustier outside), it was no higher than a 3-4 out of 10.

For now, I'll award a 3 and hope that when I'm able to return and try a specialty pizza, it'll warrant keeping that score.",g1YLVOwquTJ5ILeWIwqW9Q,1,0,3,Tw-OS8moXhfARpxkd5aviQ

Had one with sausage, pepperoni, garlic crust, And couple other things. Was really awesome! Even the ""small"" size could only eat half of it, but took it back and ate rest for dinner.

5959815,2011-02-15,7,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"Groupon alert!

As a Groupon addict, I'm always excited when they offer one for a place I've been dying to try. 

We decided to order a pizza for takeout, since we were feeling pretty lazy after an exhausting weekend of doing nothing. I decided on a Not so Wee Royal and a Wee garlic fries. I was tempted by the Poutine, but I'm just not a big fan of gravy and cheese. I ordered the pizza on the well-done side based on some previous reviews about the pizza being under or unevenly cooked. 

When I got the pizza home, I was excited to take a bite. I didn't find any of the crust or dough issues that previous reviewers had mentioned luckily, so I was happy about that. I adored the texture. It was chewy and I really enjoyed the sauce. The added touch of ricotto was delightful and added a sweet flavor to accompany the savory. I was very happy with this pizza. My fella, on the other hand, wasn't as impressed. He stuck mainly with the garlic fries, which were much more garlicky than I would like. If only they used real garlic instead of garlic salt and I would've been sold!

All in all, I was very happy with my meal here. I have a feeling I won't be eating here too often, unless I go with a friend. Hehe.

I look forward to trying more menu items here sometime soon.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,7,4,0maHH_Eaxfcc1sPQNMycaQ
5962606,2017-04-10,0,P8uECqGqXWTwEndkh-6bQw,"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. The crust has so much flavor, nice thick cut pepperoni. Wings are fantastic, The fries are great. To me Joes NY is good not great and overpriced about $5 a slice. Metro pizza looks much better then it tastes soggy crust. Tasted better when reheated in toaster oven. Pizza Rock Good but again $5 a slice hit or miss but its good. Naked city not a thin crust ny pie. Go try it its a dive thats part of the appeal of naked city. I grew up in NY but I dont think NY pizza from NY is that good anymore. 
Try it you will be hooked and its cheap compared to other pizza in LV",QsDgWVcSzY9k3st3SBU_wA,0,0,5,ORscv5D46rgA5Qj0FOZnUw

One of the best pizza places I have had so far and they are open late night apparently and located inside a bar! Definitely a great hangout place.

Parking
Pretty spacious could be limited during busy hours but it is inside a bar so might be best to rideshare over.

Service
Food is brought out to your table and there is self-service water, utensils and napkins by the door. The bar itself seemed fine people just hanging out and having a good time.

Food
Suicide Fries - Not a fan of this. The spicy level is pretty high and I would eat it if it was more flavorful since I enjoy tasty spicy food not spicy just because. The fries themselves were okay. I would definitely pass on this unless you just feel like something spicy. *2 stars*

Guinea Pie - I was pleasantly surprised by the tastiness of the pizza. I was very skeptical when it came out in a square form. The crust reminded me of a thinner version of the now trendy pretzel bun. I think the garlic sauce is what really made this pizza stand out as the best pizza I have eaten thus far. *5 stars*",nWS4xS4lAfi9xeW8uABx8g,1,0,5,TBnxSmYvysJk8zUm9gu7sg
