The sides were not ""homemade"", straight out of some store bought container. The beans out of a can, no special seasonings. The ribs were ok  but no sauce and needed to be cooked longer. Ribs shouldn't fight you to come off the bone. The chicken is too salty! I heard there is MSG in the ""Flavor Crystals"" that's why it's so salty. Well, if so, they are supposed to tell people about that and give them the option to eat that! No professionalism or respect for customer service anymore...

New Planet  Hollywood location...same shenanigans.",Ok3oGBsrZZNLRhaVk0zASw,0,0,1,xS76kF_BgN5F_7GI_9o7EA

I also ordered a red velvet waffle and a plain one just incase I didn't like the red velvet waffle since I'm not a fan of red velvet cake. It was sooooo good. I got my order to go, but tasted it when I got in my car and couldn't stop eating it!!!

Heard they're moving to a new location, so Goggle it! It will be worth it...",1oBWrKCDvH221hueHla2Rg,1,1,4,hCEjMFoGkC5vxXZYuU4V2g
