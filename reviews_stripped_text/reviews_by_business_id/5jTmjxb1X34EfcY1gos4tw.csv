The food is on par with every other restaurant in the chain that I've visited, which is to say incredibly greasy and fattening --the way an item named ""Fatburger"" should be.

I've never had a bad experience here, but it could stand to be a little cleaner and the food is still only a notch above standard fast food fare.",UYACF30806j2mfbB5vdmJA,0,0,4,bRHQiLHxqrYfMEE4MXQYlA

However, I did come to this location on a Saturday to try it out and ended up just walking out since I saw 6 people sitting down at tables but told me I had to get in line behind them. Yes, these people were sitting down because they did not get their order in standing up. One guy even had his feet on a chair. Seeing that made me realize that I was better off going somewhere else. Not sure if they were understaffed but it appears they were overwhelmed with a few customers that they couldn't get to anyone else.

The day I did go, the staff had fun while working with each other but they seemed fairly aloof and detached in regards to customer service and interaction.

The food was so good, I'm willing to try another location. But I felt like I was being treated by McDonalds or Walmart employees while here.",g9pTLCAoinvLbICiRzWsIQ,1,0,2,8E8gBrxz6IsLORq88eqXPw

The last three times I've been here have been horrible. Two times ago, we were the only people in the place and there wasn't a clean table to be found. We had to ask someone to clean a table. A guy comes out with a dirty rag (smelled like dirty dishwater) and smeared the table ""clean"" and left with an attitude. Haven't seen him again, but still. After that, we've ordered takeout.

Last two times the service was TERRIBLE. Last night OVER THIRTY FIVE minutes to get three burgers and we were the only ones there. Now, that would be fine (it's not fast food) except they made our shakes first and they were all ruined before we even got our food. It's TAKEOUT! Are we supposed to drink our shakes before we leave? I guess I have to take the whole family with me to pick up our food, not sit down at the filthy table, drink our shakes at the counter while we wait over a half hour for a burger where the bread was hard, the meat was over cooked and the guy behind the counter looked like he wanted to be ANYWHERE else.

However, when I walked in, there was a gentleman at the grill wiping it, lights were dimmed and chairs put up. I asked if they are already closed and he replied almost,I then asked if I could order something since it was only 15 after 9 and they are not due to close till 10pm.. instead of responding he turns and goes to the back....So I waited (mainly just to see if he was going to come back or wait, hoping I would leave) he then comes back out about 3 minutes later and I ask the same question...then I ask to speak to a manager he points to the a wall and says you can call.  I said what is the manager's and is there a number or card....he replies no...I again ask for the manager's name and he replied Eduardo.  I said, I saw another employee in the back when I walked in can I speak to him. The 2nd employee comes out and tells me he was cleaning the bathrooms and he was the acting manager.  He nonchalantly apologized for the other reps behavior and asked if he could help me...Sir, you have turned off the lights, picked up all the chairs, turned off all the grills and have bathroom hands...what exactly is it that you think you can do for me at this point?  I am in complete shock at the lack of anything that this place of business had to offer me, which was nothing.

1182815,2010-12-17,0,5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw,"First, I feel like I should defend Fatburger from those who complain about the price or the length of wait for the food.  Yes, a fatburger costs more than a Quarter Pounder or a Whopper, and yes it takes longer to get.  That's because (A) it's a thicker (fatter) burger with fresher ingredients, and (B) it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp waiting for you to come in and order it.  A fatburger is cooked to order, so they are fresh.  Quality is a positive thing, even if you have to pay for it, or wait for it.

In my high school days, when I had a little extra to spend, I used to go to Fatburger with a group of friends and get some chili-cheese fries covered with diced onions and a chocolate milk shake made with real ice cream.  We would hang out in the lobby, listening to that great old time rock 'n' roll and classic soul that they always play.  Those were good times.

Now that I try to eat healthier, it's been a couple of years since I've had their chili cheese fries or milk shake, but I still go to Fatburger once in awhile just for their veggie burger.  Kudos to Fatburger for offering a healthy alternative to standard fast food fare.  (If only In-N-Out Burger would introduce a burger with a veggie patty).  Fatburger uses a substantial Boca patty in their veggie burgers, and it makes for a tasty, satisfying meal.  It's probably the only thing I'll ever order from Fatburger anymore, so it's a really smart way to keep people like me coming back.",wM1cuy_w6qsdWLeqQFWqVA,1,0,3,mARcZrf83gfWeb-DJ8JrtA

The ignorant cashier with tats on her hands took my order repeated back my order several times after I clarified NO ONIONS. She kept saying everything? I had to consistently clarify NO ONIONS. She finally said ok.

After waiting 15 mins for my order, I drive home to take a bite into a saturated burger full of uncooked white onions!
I specifically said NO onions! I hate raw onions on burgers! 
So call to tell her she messed up on my order. All I was asking for was for them to remake it but she insisted on arguing to justify she's right. She only heard what she wanted to hear and didn't want to admit wrong. Again all I was calling for was to have them simply fix and remake my burger. She was just wasting my time and breathe. 
Clearly nothing was going to get handled over the phone.
She lacks good work ethics and has no understanding of customer service skills. 

I'm so annoyed. 10 min drive, 15 min wait, had to drive back and wait for her to refund my card. That's about 40 wasted mins of my life I'll never get back!

The location on the strip is open 24/7 and is the perfect choice when you are trying to nurse yourself into zombie mode.

Being a Zombie would take some sort of miracle. Fatburger, can be that miracle.

On my way home from the club the other night, I got hungry. There really isn't too much in the way of convenience at 5am near my place (I can't wait to move to the Strip). Thankfully, this Fatburger location popped up like an oasis in the desert.

I walked in the store and the pos system was down so they had to write my order down, I got the honey garlic crispy chicken and a side of onion rings the chicken was rubbery and I don't think it was cooked fully through because of the texture, way too much honey garlic sauce it made the chicken breading soggy or maybe that was because the meat wasn't cooked all they way either was it was a disgusting mess. The onion rings must have been cooked at a low temp in dirty oil because it was like an old nasty crunch and oily at the same time. I heard no sizzling coming from the fryers. I threw it all away and ate left over from the fridge. Thanks for a horrible experience. I used to love fat burger now I don't think I can ever eat there again. I'd give a half of a star if I could.

Overall a solid experience, although the burger should have been outstanding and it was not. Condiments were spot on, patty was not especially flavorful but still delicious. I can respect an establishment that doesn't freeze their meat. Bun was dry. I think if I had ordered some cheese it would have been better. 

Fries came out hot and were good, but not great. I figure if I can get a more satisfying burger and In N Out for half the price Fatburger as a franchise needs to try harder.

Recently they've been outclassed by SmashBurger and I can say there's not much reason to go back. The burgers are average and served with relish and lots of mayo which makes for an odd sweet taste. Fries taste about the same as those from the frozen section of the grocery store and are rather limp. 

This location had particularly bad service. Went in around 8 pm on a weeknight and there was only one staff member behind the counter, trying to fix a broken milkshake machine. Took about five minutes for other staff members to show up and even then they hung around the kitchen area. We had to wait for the first staff member to finish making milkshakes to help us and then he was incredibly unfriendly. On top of that there's no drive-thru.

There was some smell emanating from the restroom that smelled like spoiled air freshener if there is such a thing. My girlfriend said it was almost overpowering in the restroom. It was a really sickly sweet smell. I'm not sure what it was but it didn't make the burgers taste any better.

It began with ordering our food. My mom ordered a burger without the bun, which isn't anything outrageous these days, but for the woman taking our order, she had to go back and get the manager to assist her in completing the rest of our order. In total, we were up at the counter for over five minutes. 

After ordering, we sat down and waited...and waited...annnnd waited...annnnnnnnd waited. I'm not exaggerating when I say we waited 20 minutes for our order of three burgers and two fries to arrive at the table. And it's not like the place was packed; we were the only people there, other than a party of five that walked in about ten minutes after we arrived. 

Once the food arrived, the manager apologized as one of our burgers was incorrect, but we didn't really feel like waiting an additional 20 minutes for a new one. There was definitely some temperature consistency issues as well, since our food was hardly warm by the time it arrived, most notably the fries. 

After bringing us our food, the manage went outside to smoke, as she was sitting right outside the window next to our booth. Another large party walked inside and started ordering. Once again becoming frustrated with the ordering system, the same employee who originally took our order when to the door and shouted to the manager ""Get your ass back in here!""

I called to order a veggie burger- ahead of time so that it was most convenient for me & the workers. Someone speaking almost no English answered. I said I wanted to order- he asked someone: 'Do you want to  take an order?' She said, 'no,' then came to the phone. I started to order- she said, 'will you be here within ten minutes?' (I would have been). 'Because it's 9:42 & we're not supposed to take phone orders.' 'Its 9:36 & you close at 10.' 'We go by the work clock, which says 9:42.' Are you kidding me? You go by a fantasy time about when you prepare to be closed? (I didn't say this- I thought this). I hung up - wrote a letter to corporate & I vow to take my business elsewhere.

I usually get an XXL (double cheeseburger) with grilled onions, pickles and all-beef chili. I'm a low carber so I'll get it served in a dish with no bun. I love the beef here and I love how it is cooked in all of its own delicious burger grease. Sit at the counter and talk to the cooks while they prepare your dinner, and order a soda that you can keep refilling yourself at the self-service soda bar (this location has Coke Zero and Gold Peak brewed tea, both make my tummy happy). 

I love Fatburger's handmade milkshakes too (and their skinny and fat fries) but I've had to give those up due to all the carbs. But if you can, try their skinny chili cheese fries, they are the best. They melt shredded cheddar on them which is the key to good cheese fries. There are also a long list of possible toppings you can get on your Fatburger from relish to fried eggs to bacon and grilled onions. They also make grilled chicken and veggie burgers too, and both are good. You can also get your burger on a whole wheat bun or wrapped in lettuce.

Everything is cooked to order here so once you order you are given a number. They'll deliver the food to your table.

Plus, seeing that breakfast is served all-day, I can see a breakfast fanatic (me) frequenting this place on more than one occasion.

Don't come here expecting extravagance. You get your typical breakfast sandwich: a bun packed with a sausage patty, cheese, and a fried egg on the bottom. The fried egg was a nice touch, which gave it more a homemade taste that you don't get in most major fast food joints. It's not a gigantic sandwich, but it's a good enough size to get my fill. Although it doesn't specify in the menu, the sandwich comes with a side of tater tots too.. score!

I'd skip out on ordering the OJ. Turns out, it's the bottled concentrated Tropicana stuff. Does not taste fresh squeezed, nor does it taste fresh. Reminds me of the sour OJ sipping sessions during depressing hospital visits. Definitely gonna roll with a coffee on the next visit.

Prices more than reasonable for the breakfast menu. I got my sandwich, tater tots, and OJ all for under $5. I end up spending almost twice that much getting something off the regular menu.

Came in here at 5:50pm to order two burgers to go, one medium and one large, with cheese and no tomatoes, and some fries. The cashier was very nice, however don't be fooled, a nice face does not mean a sense of urgency. My order was punched in at 5:59, and since I know the burgers are make to order, I expected the food to be out in about ten minutes.

Wrong. The female cashier and the male cook had absolutely no teamwork whatsoever. They were all over the place and were literally falling apart, with only 4-5 orders on the screen. There was food just sitting under the heat lamp for a good ten minutes before she decided to grab it and hand it off. At the 20 minute mark, I was getting impatient, because an elderly woman got her order (two burgers) before me, and she ordered after me. I politely asked where my food was, and the cook said it was coming right up, and that if I had a complaint, it wasn't their fault because they were short handed. 

That's a load of BS in my opinion. I manage a high volume restaurant and any competent staff can handle multiple orders, ESPECIALLY when the whole menu is essentially burgers and fries. Even with two people, with proper teamwork, sense of urgency, and a sense of priority, they should be able to handle a work load, especially since it is what they are trained to do. 

6:34 comes around and I finally get my food, along with one other woman that was waiting for her orders to come out, which had a long ticket time as well. The cashier went up to me and said if I came in next time and said they botched my food, I would get a replacement. I don't want a replacement. I want to go into a food establishment, and get my order within a reasonable time period. 30 minutes is not acceptable ticket time for two burgers that weren't even made properly.

First and foremost, the biggest flaw: NO DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. In this day and age, I didn't think they were still making fast food restaurants that required you to get out of your car. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that this is a big mistake.

Secondly, the service is very hit and miss. One time I asked for the thin/skinny fries, and they put the larger steak fries in my bag anyway (which if you ask me, aren't as good.) One time they tried taking my order when they weren't even standing at the register, and needless to say I wound up repeating it several times. 

Another thing that is really weird about this location is their jukebox. It brags about free music, yet the LCD appears to be covered up. On top of that, it even has money/credit card slots. Seriously? Having access to free music would be a great way to kill time while waiting for my order, but it looks to me like this damn thing doesn't even work.

And another big flaw.... the PRICES. For a medium burger and a small  order of fries, its TEN DOLLARS. And this is WITHOUT A DRINK! The food at Fatburger is excellent, and I believe they would be justified in asking slightly more for their items.... but this is ridiculous.

If you MUST eat at a Fatburger, go to one with a drive-through - and be prepared to pay more than you might want to. This is a place that has the potential to be great, but this one needs a drive-thru, improved service, and lowered prices before I give them anything above 2/5.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,2,_oCDQAywrSBV05c30gFDlA

Definitely banana, and some other kind of ""exotic"" flavoring like a hint of coconut or mango or something.  I was hoping for something along the lines of a Sonic pineappple milkshake (BOMB, btw), but it wasn't.

You get your choice of skinny or steak fries.  I got the skinny, and noticed they have an extra coating of crustiness, like Burger King or McD's.  I like them better than In 'N Out fries, although I worry about what makes up that extra coating.

I asked them if they could do a 'protein style' burger without the bun, and they were happy to do so.  They basically put the patty on top of all the fixin's, and put the whole thing in a cardboard container (like the fry containers at In 'N Out).  

I like that they have different Tabasco sauces for you to choose from too, and saw a bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce on the counter too.

5129744,2013-02-10,0,5jTmjxb1X34EfcY1gos4tw,This isn't the best Fatburger in the world... I've been here a handful of times and it usually takes a bit too long to get your order. The burgers are a bit too salty for my taste too. On the other hand they have FANTASTIC real milkshakes and are open til like 3 AM. If I'm looking for a better burger I'll either grill it myself or drive down the street to Fuddruckers.,bKhfZoTppbT2cnnP38wiUw,0,0,3,byESb1iE6dZFZBag00Kabw

I couldn't help but try out Fatburger again after the whole discussion between In&Out and Fatburger.  I wanted to make sure that my choice between the two were correct.  And, hands down I will choose In&Out over Fatburger.  Sorry Fatburger fans.

I chose this location just because of convenience.  What I like about Fatburger is the fact they take call ins, the patties are fatter and thicker, and the choice to have an egg in your burger is available.  Mmmm, such a delight to have egg in a burger.

Downfalls are that the meat is somewhat hard and dry, the relish on the burger doesn't do anything for my pallet, and the taste just doesn't do it for me.  There's just something missing.  I thought the onion rings were good but all that oil just lost me.  

Staff were great and awesome.  Lady calling out names when the order is up seems cheerful and willing to go above and beyond.  I liked her enthusiasm.  :D",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,2,3,Qqyrm3QEaorwcKzeNsbbqQ

We went here for dinner on Friday night, a quick stop for ""fast food"" on the way to the airport.  Is Fat Burger fast food? because this place was anything but fast!

There were 4 people working, 1 cashier and 3 ppl prepping food. It took 15-20 minutes for our order (2 burgers, shake, drink, fat fries) to come out.  The server brought us our food and I asked ""will my shake be coming out?"" and the chick gave me a blank stare and walked away muttering ""I don't even know what's going on.""  Really?!  Did I just witness that?  My shake came out...5 minutes later.  My burger with cheese and chopped up bacon was bomb-tastic btw. So freakin good.

Called back 3 minutes later and went to voicemail. Waited a few more minutes and called again still went to voicemail. So I called from my husband's phone and wouldn't you know, they answered. I said I was calling to place an order and the guy straight up hung up on me. Can't tell you how much I love Fatburger, but this definitely pissed me off. Definitely not going back. Called 5 guys across the street, 10 minutes before closing and they happily took my order and had a smile on their faces. Love spending my money on places that deserve it!

Anyway, I got the veggie burger and mom got the regular. Both were pretty good and the fries were awesome! Best fries I've had from a fast food chain to date. I say this because it had been YEARS since I've eaten at Fatburger, let alone ordered their fries because the burger always seemed to be enough. I was starving this day! lol!

Staff was very friendly and the cashier working that day was pretty darn cute, I might add. ;)

Every time I come here (which isn't often) I'm so disappointed and today I decided to write a review. The cashier was super rude, I paid 18.00 for 2 burgers and fries for my daughter and myself and the lettuce looked days old and my French fries were ice cold. There was no ice in the ice machine and it didn't smell too pleasant. One of the workers tossed his empty juice bottle across the room (I guess trying to make it in the trash) and it fell in the area where the veggies are. (Poor decision on his behalf) needless to say I will not be coming back to this location because even though it was only $18.00, when I spend money I expect better than this.

Food was served fairly quick seeing as how the food is made to order and fresh. Burger was big and juicy (I ordered the XXL 1lb burger) the veggies were fresh. The only thing I suggest they do is get heartier buns that can hold up when topped with 16oz of juicy beef (half way thru the bun wasnt sloppy soaked but it was pretty weak) the beef had a great seasoning to it and the fries, which are my favorite kind steak fries (fat fries) were cooked perfectly.
