Overall she looked and talked so short with me again as if I was bugging her by being there at 8:30 in the morning. Just super unprofessional. I think that's the down fall sometimes of young workers.

Wasn't really expecting to find a Brazilian açaí shop in Vegas, but even so, this place left me sad and disappointed at the pale imitation of what a real açaí smoothy is suppose to taste like.

I used my maps app on my iPhone and still couldn't find it until I called and asked where exactly they are located. The sign is so small. I ordered the Spicy Shoyu. It was the only thing I ordered and when it was  done being made it looked delicious. When I got home, my food wasn't spicy, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't what I ordered. I put some soy sauce on it because there wasn't any sauce at all, which I thought was really odd. I started eating my food and I couldn't stomach the tuna. I always order tuna poke at my regular sushi spot and have never had issues but this time it just wasn't good. It didn't taste good to me. It even smelt funny. I couldn't finish it. I took two bites and had to throw away the entire thing away. What a waste of $13. I don't think I'll come back; to this location or any other. I had my hopes too high for bowlology.

Josh K. Of Bowlology,

The poke bowl I ordered was $11.90 with tax. I put $1.00 for tip because when I called and asked where you guys were located and the guy on the phone was nice about it- SO, my grand total was $12.90.  Sorry, it was a waste of $12.90 EXACTLY.

Obviously, other than air in the cup which is free for them, granola has to be the cheapest ingredient. The 2 stars is for filling up the cup with literally half granola. 2 large Makai Bowls/Cups for basically $22 is not cheap.

The workers could care a little more though, like welcoming their customers or thanking them on their way out. But for the most part, they're chill and friendly with a smile.

The wait isn't that long, being that they're usually always busy during lunch hours. I still appreciate their craftiness in making their acai bowls and how great they taste! They have a variety of bowls, juices, smoothies, and even shelved products near the counter. They also have what seems like local business cards on another table near the pick up station which has extra napkins and spoons on them.

The interior is very hipster-like, not to mention all their clocks lol, and they've got free wifi with no purchase needed! They also have a couple tables outdoors if you just wanna relax in the sun. I'm fond of their music choice because it fits perfectly in the whole theme of the place. VERY RELAXED.

This place is great, with a variety of acai and pitaya bowls to choose from for a healthier healthy snack option vaguely similar to a froyo place. Even the regular-sized bowls are a generous portion and can easily serve as a lunch.

Interior décor is modern rustic, and the employees are genuine and friendly. The bowl-building beauties behind the counter are happy to walk you through the menu or make a suggestion based on what you like. My pick is the original acai bowl, which is topped with bananas, strawberries, and honey. Delicious!

Only suggestion is to implement a loyalty card deal- pricing is pretty fair for the value, but I can see myself coming back pretty regularly and would love to be able to earn a discount of some sort.

EDIT: They now have a punch card! Five bowls gets you a freebie. Cards are at the register, you have to ask for them to sign. Now if they can just upgrade to the sturdier cardboard containers and clear bubble lids (like at a froyo joint), so that you don't have to cram your fruit toppings to take the order to go!

EDIT #2: They now offer poke bowls exclusively at this location. I was really disappointed with mine. For the price, it was less than half of what I receive elsewhere and lacked flavor.

I really wanted to like it, and I did when I was given a sample. 

When it was made it was then blended with premade apple juice and within 2 minutes it was cold soup like and melted not making it very appetizing. But I did enjoy it for the first 2 minutes, then it started melting. Again I wouldn't know if this is common practice to blend with apple juice but I do try to stay away from juices unless they are freshly squeezed and this was not. 

I would like to try other acai bowls and so I would have something to compare it to. Others seem to give it great reviews which is what brought me in.",Apj8bnqWlnaiSu4YDl0wDA,1,1,3,-oZIB8jnWDRIiWNeCANP3w

My wife decided on the chocolate dream acai bowl. The blend hand cocoa in it. The topping was strawberries, bananas, chocolate chips, and honey... Yum! My wife just wishes there was a little more chocolate flavor to the blend.

I chose the body builder. Peanut butter in the acai blend! Topped with strawberries and bananas sans honey and almonds. I loved mine, but it also needed more peanut butter in the blend. 

There bowls are so fresh and filling. I always feel energized and satisfied after having one ! We will definitely be back!",rwsz4-xScU0KwwRArsHZhQ,0,0,5,qaQ2go6QmLFOY-5qoTEhnQ

This is ridiculous!

The customer service is approachable so talk about what you like. They will customize bowls to fit your taste. They have two sizes. I usually get the smaller size and feel full for my whole workday.

Don't know what an acai bowl is? Imagine eating a bowl of cereal full of chunks of fresh bananas and strawberries. Now imagine that instead of milk it's a berry smoothie. It's like eating dessert, but it's made with many healthy ingredients.

Body Builder- You'll hear customers ordering this acai bowl all day long. As a regular acai bowl eater I can really taste the peanut butter in this one. Relative to ones I've had these are creamy from the almond milk. Apple juice mellows out the acai too. Thank goodness they cut the toppings into bite-sized pieces. A generous amount of honey covers the top. The only thing this one is missing is fresh coconut flakes. These guys are so nice I bet they would put it on there for me. The bottom has the perfect amount of hemp granola.

Peanut Butter Lover- Naturally I had to try this pitaya bowl. Sure enough it has a strong peanut butter flavor. They were kind enough to let me try it with chopped almonds on top, which it usually doesn't and that made it even nuttier. The color of the pitaya is a startling pink, but it very mild and fruity. Don't be scared to try this one. Super good.

This place is great, but I do wish the seating was a little more ergonomic. Most of the table and chairs don't match and make the eating experience a little uncomfortable.",mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA,6,5,5,ZyIb0xYO9rQ91M6TD_llAA

The menu and set up for ordering is not set up well cause when u walk in to the counter you don't actually order there. Me and the hubby stood there hella confused until the guy told us that we needed to walk toward the back wall to sit and look at the menu. 
Regardless, menu was pleasing and lots of choices. Pretty much what I expected: acai bowls, juices, smoothies and this thing called Pitaya. Not sure what that is.... Looks like dragon fruit and I don't know why they wouldn't call it that on the menu instead of making me google it. 
So we went to counter to order where the girl named Kennedy was super abrasive and had horrible customer service. She barely made eye contact and you could tell by her attitude she didn't wanna be there. She was super unpleasant and when I saw her grab 2 large bowls when I ordered 2 small bowls, I thought she didn't hear me so I repeated that I didn't order large bowls. She quickly and angrily told me: ""those are not yours!""
Then we paid and there was no way I was giving her a tip with her crappy attitude. 
We ended up ordering a small body builder and rise and shine.
Rise and shine is their basic bowl. But truthfully I'm not a sweet kinda person and the body builder hit the spot! A wonderful combination of just enough peanut butter topped with almonds gave it a salty and crunch taste. And when combined with a strawberries and bananas totally scrumptious. 
Totally will be back! But too bad that girl had such a bad attitude for such a positive and healthy work culture and environment.

Only recently opened, this place seems to know what it wants to be:  your neighborhood shop to get your Acai or Pitaya fix in the form of bowls, smoothies and juice.  So far it's been a great experience.  Go in and you'll find yourself in a simple place with a trendy air about it, and a very nice staff.  The ladies who work behind the counter are super personable and do a good job of remembering returning customers.

The bowls come in two sizes, but don't be fooled, the regular size is filling.  You have a number of menu choices for what goes in your bowl.  If you're in the mood for a smoothie, you can also go that route, along with a number of additives to enhance your order.  The ladies will also let you substitute fruits on top if you need to, or prefer.

The only odd thing about the store is where the menu is located and where to order.  Don't sweat it:  walk in, go to the back, look at the large menu, then proceed to the register to order and pay.  No big deal.  They'll work out the signage and flow, I'm sure.

You can enjoy your order right there or take it to go.  Just grab a lid from the counter if you need to bolt.  If your plan is to sit a while, keep in mind there's very limited seating inside the shop.

If you like Acai or Pitaya, give this place a try.  If you're looking for a recommendation, try the Berry Good or Rise and Shine bowls.  I think your mouth will be happy!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,6,4,4,FUfGG8hhiH_37v--07_ttA

Right when you walk in, everything is a little too sterile. There needs to be something welcoming to the place. It's missing music. All you hear are the blenders. Get some reggae up in here, just any music at all and it would make it a great place to actually hang out.

Finally, the granola. It's one of the main aspects to every bowl. Their granola is a little cheap. It's a very puffed rice granola which is cheaper and doesn't pack as much nutrition when full pats are used.

Interior: Nice and spacious with that korean coffee shop sort of decoration but not the best place to hangout in since the blenders are pretty busy.  

Service: Everyone here was pretty nice but not so much the guy working there who seemed to only have love for the women and not for the fellas. 

Food: I get the body builder which is pretty freaking awesome.  The frozen treat is nicely blended with no bits of ice or fruits while infusing a nice nuttiness from the peanut butter they add topped with fresh slices of bananas, crunchy (but not hard) granola pieces and honey.

Overall: This place is great as a summer time treat and as a healthy alternative.

The space is clean & minimalistic with a cute organic style. The menu--including juices, smoothies, açai & pitaya bowls--has lots of delicious options and combos, so making a decision was tough! Side note - the menu's oddly placed in the back corner away from the register, so in addition to having a hard time choosing between yummy options, it's literally difficult to order because of this odd setup. Why not put the menu on the wall behind the cashier?? There's even room for it!

Either way, I went with the regular sized Berry Good açai bowl, $6.99. My order took about 5-10 minutes since they blend everything fresh - luv that. The açai blend had excellent texture but lacked tartness, perhaps too much banana in the mix. They really load up the toppings though!

I like the fact that they have so many different options to choose from in terms of acai/pitaya bowls. My personal favorite is the Ocean because it's topped with watermelon, kiwi, and strawberries. I haven't encountered many acai bowl places that incorporate watermelon so when I saw that as a topper, I was excited. 

I've tried their sushi bowls as well. I've had better but theirs will do if you're craving or if an acai bowl doesn't fill you up. They don't have as many options to choose from and if I remember correctly, there's only 3 variations you can pick from. 

They also have a nice selection of smoothies and juices you can pick from. All of which are tasty and fresh!

The taste that makes you want to eat healthy for every meal. 

At first I thought the price was a little high, but now I am more than happy to pay the price. It's a much healthier alternative to ice cream. I could honestly eat this for every meal of summer. Also, it is GMO free!

4613754,2017-09-11,1,_JbuDLG7SFEtiCVDT1M0CQ,"I was super disappointed. First off, my cousin and I love getting acai bowls. We crave it ALL the time. I ordered the Berry Good bowl from the Hualapai location before and loved it. So i convinced my cousin that she had to try Bowlology. We have tried multiple establishments that sell Acai bowls and i told her that I really liked Bowlology's the best. So today I was finally able to convince her to try it out. This was the first time I had tried this location and was expecting it to be exactly the same. To my dismay, it definitely wasn't.

Right from the moment we walked in, it was not a great vibe. The cashier was not welcoming at all. She didn't even say ""hello"" or ""can i take your order"". Nothing. No words at all. I awkwardly approached the counter and just started to order, assuming that she was ready because she had not said a word. So i ordered the Berry Bowl. Exactly like i did at the other location. Berry Bowl with Acai, and my cousin ordered the Makai. Right when we got it, i already noticed that mine was different. It was more of a pink color than the bowl that i got before. I also know that Acai bowls are much darker than Pitya, so im assuming they made it with Pitya. The consistency of the blend was very weird. I think the amount of bananas that was mixed into it may have caused it? I'm not sure but it was like a weird thick mucus like consistency which i feel would only be from the bananas. Was not a fan. Super sad that it was not what I was expecting at all. The toppings also weren't as fresh as expected. I got a good amount of mush blueberries. No bueno. AND on top of that, now my cousin doesn't believe me and is not a fan on Bowlology. She was not a fan of her bowl either. The taste didn't do it for her. Hers also wasn't as blended as I've seen others in the past. I'm hoping that it was just this location that was the problem and will hopefully try to convince my cousin to give the other location a shot. 

But as of right now, it looks like i'll be taking a break from Bowlology and just stick to Nekter, as they are very consistent with their bowls.",UrrntfZuj8xz-h9iHrtjqA,4,0,2,ZfN9nWDUIMx6MW6hCyQ-wA

Changes to the menu: now you can pick in your acai bowl whether or not you want acai or pitaya. I rather like that option because I am personally partial to pitaya, and now I can try different mixtures and such.

We go to juice bars a lot.  Figured we would try a new one out.  On average I would say we wait 3 minutes for juice(2 of them) to be made once ordered, 5 minutes at most - and that is when it is busy.  In most juice bars there is 2, maybe 3 employees working.  Here, they had 4 and with no line it took somewhere between 10-15 minutes to get our juice.  During that time we got to watch one employee throw something that appeared to be food at another employee, one employee playing on a cell phone, and another dancing around with a garbage bag on her head.  All of which would honestly probably be okay if someone had just made our order in a somewhat timely manner.  When we did receive our juice, both were in mason jars.  Mine was sticky and hers was dripping beet juice from the bottom( a lot of it) which she luckily didn't get on her clothes(Ultimately what brought this down to one star).  We didn't exactly wait for perfection when it came to the juice.  Her Acai bowl came out quickly and she enjoyed it, but that was easily overshadowed by everything else.  

Nektar juice bar is 3 minutes from here, and The Juice Standard is 8 minutes from here.  With competitors that close that deliver the same product as good or better in a fraction of the time in containers that are easy to drink out of that aren't sticky or dripping, then why would we return here?

They apparently changed where you order, so the menu is in an odd placement at the back, then you go 10 steps towards the front to order. 

Service: 3 - a little slow for there being no one else there but my friend and I. I didn't mind waiting that day, but if it was a day that I would have been in a hurry, I'm not sure I would have been okay with the wait time. 

Food: 3 - I got the Feel Good pitaya bowl, which is dragonfruit. I guess that it all depends on what fruits you like, but I'm not a fan of really sweet things and pitaya is a bit sweeter than acai. 

So I still prefer acai. 

But even then, the bowl was still too sweet for my liking. There was way too much honey and too much juice blended with pitaya. 

Still, this place is not bad, it's just a little too sweet! But people that have super sweet teeth would like it a lot more!!",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,2,2,3,cRJEB5uLlT7aWmQYKssSPw

I'm a sucker for pitaya bowls. I always choose them over acai bowls. The quality of the pitaya/acai bases are great: smooth and thick. Although, the toppings on the bowls have been cut down compared to when they first opened. You get a large portion of pitaya/acai and granola, but not enough fruits on top. 
My biggest issue was my most recent visit. I ordered a Feel Good. My fourth scoop in, I found a long blonde hair hanging off the spoon. 
No matter what, the food industry will always come across mistakes here and there. The largest role about these situations is how you handle it, and intriguing your customer to return. I immediately returned the bowl to the workers and they did not hesitate to remake a new one for me. When I received the new one, on top was the old spoon I previously used where I discovered that piece of hair in my bowl. 
Overall, I wouldn't come back to this place. It was an option to go to because it was a Sunday, Juice N Go was closed. The menu is also limited compared to Juice N Go, where you can completely customize what you want for your bowl. I'm glad acai bowls and juice bars are expanding here in Vegas, but I think I'll just stick to Juice N Go.",d1ikJdDdB9XzOxc4z3duNw,1,0,2,Q1t0PDdj3yUQXayIJodHHw

Ordering was confusing. I told the girl at the front that I had never been there before. I figured the menu board behind the cashier was it. Actually you order from the menu located in the back. Each type of bowl has (b) blended ingredients and (t) toppings. Like I said, I had never ordered this before so I thought b & t were different variations. I ordered ""a bear bowl. I guess the "" t"" option."" The cashier explained that wasn't a thing. I wish the menu board explained it because I felt dumb! 

I liked the bear bowl. It tastes like how I think froyo should taste. Unfortunately, a froyo sized cup is $9.95! I tried the chocolate dream ($7.95) also and it had no chocolate flavor other than the chocolate chips. 

While the bear bowl was delicious, I can't afford this on the regular. There was no loyalty card either. I ended up going to Whole Foods to buy acai packs and goji berries to make my own bowls at home with all the other ingredients that I already have.
