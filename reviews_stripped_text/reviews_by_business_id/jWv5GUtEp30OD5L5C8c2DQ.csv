I ordered steak and eggs and should've sent the steak back as soon as I noticed it's discoloration upon delivery. Sad to say it was the worst steak I've ever had in my life.

The lady took our order, never looked at us, just what she was writing down and never came back to check up on us. Had to wait for coffee and water refills when the place was half empty. And the biggest pet peeve I have when paying with cash is when the waitress asking if I need change, umm yeah I do. Never acknowledge us leaving the venue or anything, just complete silence. Maybe if she did her job correctly I would of left her with a 25% tip. 

P.S. there is one guy in there who is really nice, always on the floor greeting and checking up on ppl. Might be the owner, but they do need more people like him in there.",LTD2NAIin8vBRFHv9CKrfw,3,2,3,71pIGqQAgXz_aCPKohHzxQ

He must have said that to all that came in and as the ones the had eaten already were leaving, I heard them say to him your right it was worth the wait. 
I had the ribeye and scrambled eggs with home fries. The ribeye was cooked to the way I requested and the home fries were really tasty. 
Then I added some of the gravy on the potatoes. Let me say that gravy is phenomenal perfect on top of anything on my plate. The service was quick and wait staff very pleasant. And yes as I left I said to the greeter ""it was worth the wait""

The restaurant is located in a strip mall, with very easy access.  The owner walked to each table to greet us and find out about each of his patrons with friendly conversation.  The restaurant is clean and well lit, with plenty of helpful servers.

The food was average diner style food.  We had the french toast (probably could have used vanilla and maybe whipped cream w/berries to jazz it up a bit)...but for diner-style, it was on par.  My husband enjoyed the pancakes, they were large and fluffy (one would suffice).  Eggs were fresh and cooked soft, the way we like them.  The breakfast bacon was thin, but cooked properly.  Skip the orange juice...it was very concentrated and tasted canned.  The only good thing was that we saved the 2 bucks it would have cost, because we ""checked in"" on Yelp!

All in all, this is an okay place for quick, cheap eats.  The service and warm welcome we received are both worth a return trip!",worFdw_7a0CNoq0-ZsEtKw,0,0,3,e5HtmsW2Rymc3L4szSEZSQ

It seems there is usually a wait cuz he holds a clip board with the wait list and takes your name with an estimation of when u can be seated. U can also do take out as well as sit down.

Venue is on the narrow side with two long rows of tables and chairs, still a good size. And everything is blue guessing his fave color to walls to tables to chairs and its a nice touch that he puts vintage pics of his family on the walls. Being a family oriented person myself I could def appreciate that.

Menu varies from breakfast food to comfort food to subs and sandwhiches and burgers. My fiancee and I had breakfast the mamas French toast, with 3, eggs n two sausage patties, and pancakes and bacon with a brownie. All was delicious.  Pancakes were fluffy and perfect and the brownie was ginormous and it was served nice and warm. And it was only like $6.75 and $8.75 for huge servings.

Service was good nick checked in on us when we were waiting for our main dishes and asked to staff to put a rush on our order. Turned out a big takeout order came in and they were catching up. We didnt ask too and they comp'ed the brownie. 

Overall nice breakfast eatery. Would come again for the chicken fried steak plate!",QxmsYLVEfr_hLY86FjpiCQ,0,0,4,LEGR3abbgnhWDZvmLho8tw

We walk and are warmly greeted by the owner, Nick!  He called Ken by name and we were both welcomed with a big smile and warm handshakes.  Coffee was quickly brought over by the sweet waitress, Juli.  I hope I didn't get her name wrong.  She was super friendly and provided the most amazing service - I would go back for just that, but I am very happy to report that the food was just as wonderful.

Ken ordered french toast and a side of hash browns.  I have been trying to behave lately and was still in a food coma from Fogo de Chao the night before so I ordered their veggie egg white omlete with home fries and wheat toast.  Let me tell you - it was the best egg white omlette I have ever had in Vegas - so fluffy and seasoned perfectly with large amounts of FRESH veggies.  It was perfectly cooked.  The home fries were delicious too but I prefer them crispier - that's on me though there was absolutely nothing wrong with them.

Juli was very attentive and friendly throughout and at the end Nick came by again to see if everything was ok and thanked us for coming.  I can see this becoming our regular Saturday morning breakfast place!",WD8jE11b1jaXaGgrMM-gnQ,6,2,5,-3lZ7R8aAX7l8apyZKo_Xg

AMAZING SERVICE 
great food 
And excellent price. I loved the service from the minute I walked in to the minute I walked out. Nick really knows how to take care of his customers and not to mention how friendly and nice his daughter was helping me with my order.  Being a first timer there looking for a quick and delish breakfast before heading back to Cali this was definitely a great choice. Will definitely be returning for more

We also got a cup of beef and veggie soup that came with the sandwich, and it was packed with juicy pieces of beef. You could tell the soup was freshly made. 

Overall we really enjoyed our meal. Everything came out to less than $18 which is amazing. Definitely give this place a try!!",Ixta59UVf0TCxXJ8tFcB4g,4,4,5,zYcsJqq3sx1_TF8HqNn67Q

I love chicken fried steak and get it at almost every chance i can for breakfast.  So no surprise here that is what I ordered.  It looked amazing and seemed like it was going to be delicious but unfortunately it didn't taste nearly as good as it looked.  First the gravy was starchy and lacked flavor.  Then the steak was too thick and tough for my liking and it also lacked flavor.  I kept taking the next bit hoping it would be better but it wasn't.  Needless to say I will never go back to this place again.  My wife got an omelet and it looked pretty good but she was also disappointed.  Their French toast looked good so if you go maybe try that.

The sausage, which I think was supposed to be pork, tasted more like turkey sausage that was about to go bad and the sourdough bread I ordered turned out to be Texas toast instead.  I had the house potatoes on the side, which were more like fried potatoes than actual house potatoes. They were extremely salty and hardly palatable.  The only part of the meal I enjoyed was the poached eggs which was perfectly cooked and had a creamy center.

I ordered a more traditional breakfast of pancakes, bacon and hash browns, while my husband chose a breakfast burrito.  Both were amazing.  More importantly was the level of service you receive when you are here.  The owner circulates constantly and makes a point to stop and talk to everyone.

We were personally greeted by the Mr. Mama himself, an extremely friendly Greek guy from Detroit who has obviously been in the business awhile.  And as soon as I caught a glimpse of what people were having- oversized omelets, big stacks of pancakes, and home made hash browns I knew we were in for some good chow.  

The Denver omelet was as good as it looked.  Served hot off the grill, lots of cheese, fresh peppers, onions, and ham chunks, it was big and it was delicious.  The hash browns here are ethereal.  Very light with a nice crunch on the top, not greasy, made from fresh potatoes, these are probably some of the best hash browns I've ever had, and I'd venture to say that if you are a hash brown snob like me your search for the perfect hash browns in Vegas will end here.  If a place gets their hash browns down you know that everything else is going to be prepared with equal care and quality. 

I should mention that the wait staff was really friendly and efficient, and that the prices are extremely reasonable given the quantity and quality here. 

This is really the breakfast you want, and I doubt that you could find anything like it over on the Strip for any amount of money.  We will definitely make this our breakfast spot on future trips to Las Vegas, and to Mr. Mama, thanks for the delicious food!",N-5qDBcD6aLGa6zw1LsL6w,0,0,5,sIa_PO5pz3PRlRqRqW50eA

We tried to order soft and hard boiled, respectively, to be told ""we dont boil eggs here""... um what? ok whatever, poached soft and poached hard, then.

All the eggs came at an in between, not really hard, not really soft state. I didnt complain but my wife did, and in response the waitress brought a COLD hard boiled egg. When we told her we wanted hot eggs she went and 'warmed' that same precooked egg, which was grey in the center. When we commented on microwaving eggs, she said ""we didnt microwave it, we boiled it"". WHAT? I thought you ""didnt boil"" eggs? Then when the bill came she had charged us for that egg!

I ordered my steak rare, it came out medium. When I commented on it, the waitress brought a replacement, that was rare, but it was very mediocre, and it was NOT a ribeye as was stated on the menu.

My wife ordered orange juice, and what they brought was orange, but it wasnt juice. She said it tasted like SunnyD.

This isn't the place you would go to if you were trying to impress your relatives with the surroundings, because it is located in the middle of a little strip center with auto-related businesses, etc. and when you go inside it is just a basic decor. This is, however, the kind of place where you can bring the newspaper in with you to read while eating, which is what we wanted.

We had the same experience as the other reviewers - we were welcomed the minute we walked in the door. Service was fast and friendly and we had the French toast, side of bacon, a Denver omelet with a cup of fruit. All of it was good. The biggest a surprise was the bill - for all that plus two drinks we had a check of only $20! After spending $70 the night before for a couple drinks and 2 appetizers at the MGM Grand we were thrilled.

My husband had the California breakfast burrito and he was more than happy. He offered me a bite, but no - sorry, I'm way too busy with my French Toast.

I don't know if the guy at the door is the owner or not, I am assuming so as he seems to be the heart and soul of the operation. He was friendly, talkative and made you feel like part of the family and he appreciated you being there. 

You could see the food being made and the whole kitchen staff. The kitchen staff reminded me of gents fresh out of the pen, however they worked hard, looked like they appreciated having a job, looked like they just belonged. I was thankful to them and thought they kicked butt. 

I come to Vegas 3-5 times a year from S. California. If I am alone then no doubt I go to Mr. Mamas at least 1 time for breakfast while I am there. If I can I work to talk friends into coming with me to Mr. Mamas. 

My favorite is the Chili Omelet. The Chili is amazing. I love it. I am sure that the chili is homemade and fresh because it is so good. If they ever tell me that it is canned then my heart will be broken. LOL",zyJWc8oW8JpPg2xXMQsnAA,1,1,5,wCDAHx98lKUJSq0K9Y8PUg

We stayed right in the strip, and was not interested in paying $30 for eggs and toast. So we found Big Mamas on yelp, and let me tell you, it is hands down the best home cooked breakfast food I found in a long time. 

We were in Vegas 4 days and loved mr. Mamas so much we ate there every morning, Nick the owner remembered us the second morning. He has a great owner and you can tell he loves his restaurant and staff. He walks around from table to table thanking everyone for coming in and insuring that their meal is to their liking. 

We had a car, driving took us about 5 minutes from the strip, one day I overslept and my friends left me so I took a cab, it ran me $10, which was worth it for their ""Cali omelet"" 

Our first waitress we had was Yota, it's actually a longer name than that but she laughed at me because I couldn't say it. Yota is Greek with a beautiful accent, she is super personable and make you feel like family. We only had her one day but went back because of her. 

The last 3 days we had Julie, who is just as sweet as Yota. Julie brings her son to work each weekend,to teach him responsibility! What a great mom!!! Her daughter also works In the kitchen. She had our orders down pat day after day! 

The restaurant itself is in an industrial type space with is decorated with bright blue walls and colourful table tops, makes it so home like. 

THIS IS A MUST DO IN VEGAS!! Don't pay for over priced food in Vegas when you can eat at mr. Mamas

To Julie, Yota, Nick, and the whole staff, thank you for being you! Our trip was made more memorable by all of you and your cooking, we will be back!!

I've since returned twice for breakfast with my family. I had the pancakes both times. I really like that I can get a short stack with bacon and it doesn't cost a fortune.

- The Food. Portions are large (an omelette comes with a side of hash browns and they are super super tasty). It's one of those large ovular shaped plates that will last you two breakfasts. You MUST try the BISCUIT!!
- The value you get based off the large portions is awesome.
- The service. We got to meet what seemed to be the owner there and he gave us all a hearty hello along with how we liked everything and even held the door for us as we left. The other servers were so diligent in making sure we had everything we need.

So quick tidbit: Mr. Mama's it not named that because of a relationship to a mom (even though it may seem to be that way). Rather, it has origins of Greek descent and the owner is so happy to share it with everyone.

The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive despite the fact that it was so busy! Two people came by to greet us and let us know that there will be a small wait.. Which I didn't mind! It's the small things that matter :)

The beef vegetable soup and chicken noodle soup was hearty and delicious! I love thyme in my soup and this one had plenty! I can already imagine myself ordering this and having it delivered to me for those cold winter nights in Vegas :)

I ordered a custom omelette loaded with veggies and sausage, and it was huge!!! The omelette wasn't overlooked, the cheese melted perfectly on top and layered inside, so each bite was wonderfully goozy and delicious!

First off this place is in an industrial complex.  You walk in and the furniture is outdoor lawn furniture.  The space is horrible.  It seems like they should be making nuts and bolts in this place,  not food.  Hey if you your gonna do a low rent cheapie food spot that's cool,  but the bill should reflect the savings, not the furniture.  

Excellent warm greeting at the door.  Burt is hopeful at this point.  So Burt sits down, no butter.  They have ""vegetable oil whipped spread"", and when you open it looks more disgusting than it sounds.  Some yellow colored, coagulated mush that has decomposed and separated in a little puddle of water.

RED FLAG - No Splenda offered.  To Burt this means they are cheap and wont carry the more costly Splenda.  Which in turn means they are also using whatever ingredients are the cheapest, not which taste the best.  

The chicken fried steak was highly recommended on Yelp.  It literally made Burt gag.  Beside being cooked in some nasty flavored oil, it was smothered in chipped beef gravy.  Burt almost spit it out.  LITERALLY   

The cinnamon french toast was also recommended.  That was good.  

The staff was super friendly and extra nice.  Burt hates to slam a place on just one visit.  But some spots are just so bad you can never go back.  Maybe everything else is wonderful.  It's hard to believe all those great reviews can be wrong. Maybe Burt just caught them at a bad moment?  I hope so.

decent $2.95 breakfast - the usual 2 eggs, potatoes toast, bacon/sausage/ham. Also tried their version of the grand slam - cost $5.95.

If you want a low key place--the type of place with plastic patio furniture for their indoor diners and reasonably priced breakfast fare, this is the place for you. Now, don't go expectin' any fancy-schmancy gourmet pancakes like at IHOP or Denny's; this place keeps 'er simple by offerin' the basics without the fireworks, 'cept for a few omelettes among the eggs, hash browns and bacon basics. What it does better than any other place is service though. You enter and are immediately greeted by the dude cooking behind the counter and then swept to any open seat by your server. Within good time, your food is ready, your belly is more than full, and you are on your way with another salutation from the dude behind the counter. So, why not 5 stars? Well, I wasn't in love with the acclaimed chili omelette, as it tasted more like diced tomatoes than chili (2 stars), but luckily that was my co-eater's dish, and he loved it. I on the other hand kept to French toast and eggs and was happy but not blown away (still looking for CRUNCHY French toast, and other than trying Jinky's flaky French toast, haven't come close).

Avoid the breakfast burrito! The burrito has all the standards: sausage, potatoes, eggs, cheese, and bell peppers. The flavor of the bell peppers over powers the burrito and the sausages were bland.

Topped with homemade salsa and sour cream,  the flavors blended with the avalcado  so well that I felt bad adding hot sauce to bring up the heat level.

Fairly large dining room.  Calming blue decor makes you forget the scorching sun outdoors.  The owner was on site checking on customers and their enjoyment.  I like those brief encounters.

Nothing to look at, but when you dig into the gooey cinnamon roll you won't be able to pay attention to anything but your taste buds.  Holy cow.
Eggs were fluffy and not greasy.  Pancakes were equally fluffy, and flavorful.  Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly.

I was sorely let down by the reviews. I dont understand what there is to rave about. I ordered biscuits and gravy and the hubby got an omlette(cant be bothered to remember it) biscuits were ok, loaded with butter- not that theres anything bad with that, but thats just it. the gravy was too thick, almost like gelatin, sausage in the gravy lacked flavor. gravy just lacked flavor, where was the hint of maple syrup the hostess kept talking about? one more thing.......seasoning people, if you can't make it taste like it has a 'hint' of maple syrup, make sure there's enough seasoning. The only thing that helped improve this meal? the 2 over easy eggs i had ordered and then promptly placed on top of my meal with pepper and salt.

hubbys omlette was just meh as well.......and that frustrates me alot, because for a breakfast place to produce cripy omelletes? again lack of flavor, egg was way over cooked, it was so blah i dont even remember what all was in it much less came with it.

totally affordable, but i guess i got what i paid for and definately not worth the 30 minute wait for us.

We're foodies at heart and love mom and pop places but this place made me just want to take my business to an IHOP.

My favorite thing about this place was that they got you in and out quickly and there was little to no waiting time.

Don't expect big Vegas vibe.  This is a normal place probably for the locals.

The two most recent times were today and yesterday. My cousin, our GM, and I loved our omelets so much we had to order them two days in a row for breakfast. We called between 7:30a-8:00a both times and the food was literally to us within 10 min, no joke (our office is just around 1 corner from them). Hot and delicious. Hmmm if only Angelina's down the road could take a seriously lesson on customer service from Mr. Mamas that would be nice! Anyway...the delivery driver Sean is super awesome, always chats with us and very friendly. He seems to like his job there and has nice things to say about the restaurant which always make it a more enjoyable experience for the customer :) 

My cousin and I got the Greek omelet both times and both times they were great. The eggs are always cooked perfectly and you can tell the chef knows how to make an omelet; I've had some pretty nasty ones like where they were stuck to the pan or the edges were hard from starting to over cook. Eww. The ingredients you can tell are fresh and not from a can. In the Greek was spinach, tomato, and feta cheese which is my fav part. Our GM had the veggie omelet made with egg white only and side of sliced tomato's. Again egg whites cooked perfect. I wish I woulda taken a photo :(

I thought that's kind of strange for a breakfast joint but the owners must be Greek. 

We were seated and our service was prompt and good. Food was excellent! After eating I got up and was waiting for the rest of my party and was telling the hostess how great everything was and she thanked us for coming in..

Turns out her father is the owner and the original location was in Michigan and she pointed out pics of her grandfather and her great grand father.  WOW! I love hearing a restaurants history.

No burnt edges and nice runny centers :) My mom's omelette was loaded with feta cheese and the chef integrated garlic and spinach perfectly.

I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a try.  Spot on!  It is exactly what the reviews say: a cute hole-in-the-wall place on a strip mall just a mile or so away from the strip.

I wasn't sure what to order, I like to look at other people's plates when I arrive at a restaurant and kept asking the server to tell me what they were. I'm a huge fan of biscuits and gravy so that's my go-to breakfast when in doubt. The French Toast on the table next to us looked delicious and I was leaning that direction.  Then, I saw it, the Country Fried Steak... holy schmoly, mother of all cholesterol... I couldn't take my eyes off it, it was staring at me from the table next door... and if I kept really quiet I could hear it calling my name.  So I canceled the French Toast and went with the Country Fried Steak.  The wait seemed like an eternity but my wife assures me it was less than 10 minutes; and then, it arrived.

A huge breaded, fried piece of meat, laying next to a plateful of hash browns, three eggs on top of the potatoes, and gravy all over the steak.  I didn't know whether to smile or cry, I was so happy.  So after taking a picture I began the careful operation of breaking the egg yolks so they could infiltrate the hash browns.  This must be done carefully so that there is enough egg yolk to go around.  Trust me, with three eggs, there was plenty of egg yolk to turn the carefully-cooked hash browns into a golden, delicious pile of oh-my-gosh!  Each bite was celestial and I found myself quietly moaning inside my mouth as I enjoyed this wonderful breakfast.

I ordered a biscuit and gravy on the side, just because it's not breakfast without biscuits and gravy.  The biscuit is not really a biscuit but a roll under disguise.  My recommendation, skip it.  My wife had the big breakfast with eggs, meats, biscuit and pancakes; she could only finish about half of it.  She loved it also.

The servers were very friendly, the owner is a hoot.  He has a really groovy, deep, radio voice that fits his former wrestler frame just right.  The place can fill up fast, when we arrived there was no wait (10:30 am) but it quickly filled up and we saw people waiting for a good 15-20 minutes for a table so be prepared for either scenario.",9972nq6ibwhYGC7r6D9yHQ,1,0,5,35XkhEbVpHSc6SefdGiB8g

Shortly thereafter our waitress was over for drink orders.  She was incredibly attentive and so friendly.  

After ordering, our food was out in a flash.  It was so quick I couldn't believe it was ours. I went with the Mr. Mama's sandwich that was piled high with turkey, avocado, bacon, lettuce and tomato on sourdough.  Yum!!  Delicious sandwich and so filling.  For my side I went with the soup of the day- chicken noodle.  I guess it was more chicken and no noodle.  It still had a great flavor and didn't mind there not being many noodles in it.  

It's definitely a great breakfast or lunch place.  They serve breakfast all day so maybe I'll have to try that at their new location on Jones.  Thanks for a great lunch!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,2,1,4,u6oSdrVmKiJVxlvqehlDZg

Quick effortless refills, prompt billing, and the guy (assuming to be the owner) walked to the door and opened it for us when we were exiting and thanked us for having breakfast with them. Nice people they got here.

Food: Greek omelette was so yummy. You can taste each ingredient which complimented each other so well. At first I was worried that it had garlic because I don't want it to be overwhelming but it was delicious and balanced the dish. Hash browns had great texture.  My friend thinks they lightly butter it for the crispiness.

Good home cooked meals but the wait is about 30-45 minutes. That's expected when the Yelp reviews are plentiful and great! The staff was very welcoming and friendly (bumped them up to 4 stars for this).

I ordered the gravy and biscuits which I'm not 100% sold on simply because of the biscuits themselves; they tasted kinda ""broken"" and not solid, almost like they were old. BUT the gravy was delicious! You can tell it was homemade and didn't make you gag after a few bites. Very light and just the right amount of flavor. My wife ordered an omelet which tasted ""okaaay"" however she ordered it w/o yoke and cheese; the very two ingredients I love so I cannot base it on that.

It was Monday morning of the holiday weekend, so it wasn't a surprise to have to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4.  I observed that the hostess seemed to be a manager or supervisor of sorts; she was on top of every thing that was going on in that place.  

Turns out our server was fairly new, and the hostess did ask us for any feedback on her performance.  Later one of the guys in the kitchen came out and made the rounds asking everyone how everything was for them.  It was evident that they really wanted everyone to be happy.  I really appreciate that.  

I had the french toast, which was delicious. I wish the bacon were more crisp, but it wasn't overly flimsy; I just like mine extra crispy and I would've ordered it that way if I'd thought about it.  But it was Monday after a long weekend in Vegas.  

Food was very good, but the commitment to service is what stands out for me. I'll definitely go back to try other things on the menu the next time.",_mqnF5sH8tZGW_vJmMuIww,2,0,4,1nItRx98gVVDcRPf3MCEeQ

1848455,2014-08-20,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"So the first time I went was well over 2 months ago and I went by myself the first time. This time I came to eat with my sister and a friend and not even upon opening the door were we receiving EXCELLENT service right away. 

We didn't even open the door, the owner was the one that opened it for us. Definitely he started taking care of us right away letting us know it'll be a few minutes before being seated and gave us menus to look over. 

The place is clean and always well kept. The staff is definitely a reflection of the owner as the staff are extremely polite and always on top of it. 

This time I had a burger which was seasoned very nicely. For a ""mom and pop"" brunch diner joint it was a very big and delicious burger cooked to order. Your buck also goes a very long way at this place where as the portion sizes are huge. I also think they make their own ranch sauce which was also very very impressive. 

My friend and sister ordered their famous Mamas country steak and eggs. And it definitely did not disappoint.  The country gravy sauce on top really brings the meal together and yes the has browns are also seasoned and taste to perfection

We also ordered a small cup of chili which was more a bowl size order to me. Just the right consistency on the chili, not watery and not salty. I like my chili chunky and it was just right and enough that all three of us were able to try it. 

There was so much we had to bring home. The place is always packed and the customers keep coming back I'm sure not just for the food but also for the amazing customer service received upon entering the establishment. 

Half of the dinning experience I always say is service and Mr. Mamas really has it all to a T! Again I give it to the owner who makes his way to each table to ask how they are doing and it makes the whole dining experience more personable.

However, even though my friends and I were all hungry, the food was just A-OK. It wasn't as spectacular as all the other yelpers said it was. It was filling though and gave me the energy to endure the 4 hour drive back to LA. I ordered the Mr Mama's stack, which consisted 2 sausage links, 3 pancakes, and 3 eggs. I only managed to eat 1.5 pancake, the eggs, and the sausages. The dishes were a tad bit under-seasoned, and was nothing spectacular.

I'm not much of a breakfast person but I love a good breakfast burrito- opted for one here and the tortilla was soaked in so much grease that I went through several napkins wiping down my hands after each bite. The tortilla was so soaked that it was transparent in parts. The filling had a limited amount of flavorless cheese, plus peppers and onions, but was virtually void of salt and pepper. Bacon was requested well-done but seemed undercooked and added no texture to the dish.
I did not eat or save the second half of my burrito as I'd originally planned. For $7 I wasn't particularly bothered.

This may be a great place for an omelet, but it's pretty hard to screw up an omelet. Portions are decent and service is friendly, but the breakfast burrito shouldn't be on the menu if it isn't done well.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,9,3,2,v6TNlSXziwBbHi9wcu_vtg

One tip: They will offer but if you're not sure: try their gravy. It is absolutely delicious but it is loaded with sausage and the taste is a bit different than other places might have. Be adventurous, just go it and you will likely love it too....but if you're the type who likes to test the waters first....request a sample.

It never popped into my head though when thinking of a place to eat. But, finally, when craving breakfast food last week, I remembered and stopped by. 

Still on my mission to find the best chicken fried steak in Las Vegas, I closed my menu as soon as I saw it on there. Easy choice. Upon ordering, the waitress asked me to try the homemade gravy sauce that was to be smothered on my CFS before I ordered it. She informed me that their gravy in particular contained a little but of honey and wanted to make sure I would like it before I ate my meal. How very nice ! I did indeed end up liking it, and stuck to my order. 

As far as the food went, it was pretty good. The sweetness of the gray paired well with the savoryness of the CFS. The batter was good and crispy and thin. The scrambled eggs were cooked great. Was it the best CFS I've had in Vegas so far ? Nah, but it'll go to the near top of my list.

All in all, I'd go back. I definitely want to try some other things and I can't get enough breakfast foods. Service was also great. My coffee never went below half and all the waitresses had smiles on their faces.

Everything was delicious based on the crowds and our selection of meals. Great French toast! Simple and fluffy. Nothing crazy. 

The chicken fried steak is amazing. Great breading and the gravy gives it an amazing finish. The gravy is not for the weak-hearted. Plenty of sausage, bacon and maple syrup! What? Maple syrup? yes, and it is wonderfully amazing. 

Biscuits and gravy? Awesome for the same reason stated above. Sausage patties are well seasoned and a cut above average. The service was good and attentive. Good coffee too. Wonderful experience and would return when in Vegas.",lSOq0fJMTpxDy5vEa2rO-g,0,0,4,5G9cWsJbV3XHbGVlA_SU5w

We felt very welcomed from the moment we walked in to the restaurant. From that point, we had a very good feeling that this will be a breakfast we'll remember. My usual breakfast of choice is corned beef hash, but since i did not see that on the menu, I got my next favorite: pancakes! I ordered the short stack pancakes with two eggs and sausage. Even though the diameter of each pancake is larger than my face, I can proudly say that I ate it all. So soft and moist. 
Another item worth mentioning is the French Toast... It does not disappoint! If possible, use the syrup as a dipping sauce instead of pouring it over the French toast, so that you can enjoy the crisp & sweet taste of the bread with each bite.
However, the whole time I was eating my meal, I was eyeing out my friend's Denver Omelet and hash browns... So I asked her for a ""bite"", and oooh... it was good! (I had more than one bite) But I've got to admit that I am in love with their hash browns. It's prepared exactly the way I like it: crunchy on the outside. It tastes like shoestring fries, in hash brown form. I should have ordered a side of hash browns with my meal, but there is always the next time... Yes, next time!

While I was considering on going back to EggWorks for brunch, I really wanted to try a place highly recommended by many Yelpers.  And so Mr. Mama's popped up on the list and the reviews looked promising.

This restaurant is away from the Strip located in an industrial area... a hidden gem, really.  I knew it was going to be a Mom & Pops type of place based on the reviews and photos shared by many.  

My friend & I arrived and I immediately saw that the place was busy and full, but I took that as a great sign.  We were greeted by the wonderful hostess and we were seated in less than 5 minutes.  Our server got our drinks and she gave us time to look over the menu.  My friend and I really wanted to try everything.  haha... we were really hungry.  

So we ordered the following and this is my review of the food.  My friend and I shared each plate so we can try a bit of everything-

*  Mama's Breakfast Burrito:  You have a choice of bacon, sausage, or ham for your burrito.  I chose bacon :)  Burrito cut in half and plated with an orange slice twist on the side and salsa in a small container.  I took a bite of the burrito without the salsa so I can really taste it and I was impressed!  I live in San Diego so I know what a taco shop breakfast burrito tastes like.  The burrito was different, but in a good way.    It had great, fresh flavors with every bite.  I added the salsa and Cholula and it was ecstasy in my mouth.  haha.  I highly recommend you try the burrito!

*  Mama's french toast:  My friend ordered this.  The french toast was really good and I could really taste the cinnamon.  Definitely homemade and delicious!

*  Steak and eggs (daily special):  I'm used to graveyard specials after a night out at the clubs/ drinking for steak & eggs.  This wasn't bad, but I prefer the usual place I go to for steak and eggs.

Overall, my experience at Mr. Mama's was great!  The staff is very friendly and very attentive.   The place is clean and inviting.  Also, the owner checks on you to make sure your visit is good and that you enjoyed your food.  I would definitely come back and introduce this place to my family & friends next time we're in town.",ObKZ3m8W8nobuI6rH0tTQA,10,0,5,K0ivnT3lAN_UWr3zxyy_mA

I've only eaten there a few times so far but I must say, it's amazing! I'm writing this right after I just had the best omelet of my life. I had their Cali omelet this morning and WHOA. Didn't even use any ketchup or hot sauce on it. You can tell the ingredients were super fresh. I was watching the guys in the kitchen work and they were very detailed with their cooking! I have yet to try their lunch, but soon will. The owner Nick is super friendly every time I've came in for a pickup and treats you like family.

A gentleman who looked like the owner came to our table to make sure everything was ok with our food and also made sure we had enough refills. They really know how to make people feel welcome here! I should probably mention the amazing French toast huh! Well the French toast, eggs & bacon were perfection! My French toast was fluffy and powdered with cinnamon, it kinda reminded me of my mom's French toast back home. You gotta love a place that makes you feel like you're back home.

This was my first time to this establishment and when I asked for a tble for two he put me off to ask other patrons who were not looking to be seated if he could help them. After they said no, he came to me and said ""the wait is going to be 45 minutes do you want to wait?"" I noticed only 2 large groups waiting to be seated so I politely asked how many other tables for 2 were before me. He rudely said ""do you want to wait or not!"" I said ""that is why I am asking how many are before me because it may move faster than 45 min and I'll wait if there aren't several tables for two waiting."" He then said ""three, so are you going to wait or not!"" I said yes and sat down to wait for my friend to join me. When my friend arrived and asked how I was doing I told him quietly that the host guy was unnecessarily rude to me. The owner/ host guy overheard this and approached us picking a fight with me and being extremely hostile and arguing with what I said privately to my friend. I said ""you were rude to me for no reason and there is no reason for you to continue harassing me."" He then said ""I own this place and you need to get out!"" I said ""what? You are an ass hole."" I was obviously confused and rebuffed by what had just occured and left. While discussing alternate breakfast plans he came outside to continue to harass me.

If you are willing to stuff ur food down ur throat, chug ur drink and run out the door, I recommend this place and ask for Julie. They normally interviewed u as u r leaving but they didn't even try with me because maybe they saw I was uncomfortable and pissed. Oh I forgot, while I was eating, the waitress asked around 5 times if I wanted a box or take our plates.

I think the reason for the high ratings was the cheap prices. You do get what you pay for. If you want cheap big portions, and not too concerned about quality, then I guess you'll be happy. 
Anyway, let me start off by saying the people who work here were very nice and I have nothing negative to say about that.  The food is just average, greasy, diner food.  I ordered the breakfast burrito w/bacon. It had American cheese, bell peppers and onions, hash browns, and eggs. Was $6.75. The flavor was not bad but it was quite oily and not worth the calories! I also tried the breakfast sandwich. Got it on an English muffin with eggs, ham and American cheese. Came with side of potatoes and we chose the breakfast fries. This was also $6.75.  This also wasn't bad but there was sooo much butter on the bread. But it made the flavor good if you don't mind all the grease! The potatoes were bland, a little dry and not much to them. They came in a half round shape.  The ambience inside was well.. Not much of an ambience. It's in an industrial area so the restaurant was just an industrial type open room with the kitchen in the same space.

I was greeted by the owner as I entered and he did a great job checking up on me throughout the meal. Ordered coffee, and the short stack combo with Pancakes, eggs, and bacon. While the eggs were a little on the dry side, everything else was cooked perfectly and tasted great for being a traditional breakfast. On top of it all, the prices were VERY reasonable - paying under $13 for a VERY filling breakfast with the combo, coffee, and a muffin.

I found myself and a group of friends sheepishly walking into Mr. Mama's about 25 minuets before close. We proceeded to ask if it was okay. There was no one else around and presumably the staff was more than ready to go home. We were about to turn around but the owner was overjoyed and demanded that we stay because he is here to serve us. He made us feel very welcome, and genuinely happy to have us come in. 

We sat down at our table, the only one taken in the place, and got out orders taken. The breakfast menu is huge and made it quite a challenge to make a quick decision. We got some omelets, chicken fried steak, and cinnamon roles mostly because of the yelp recommendations. 

The cinnamon roles were godly. The frosting seemed to be home made and very thick. Omelets were delish, and all of the breakfast side fixings were perfectly prepared. My chicken fried steak wasn't all that extra special. I couldn't finish all of it because there was so much breading on it, that my mouth and stomach was a little overwhelmed. 

Regardless we were so happy to have eaten here for brunch. Made our bellies happy after a long Vegas night. Next time I stay on the strip I bet I come back here, just hopefully a little earlier in the day!",p2lzjUMFdYAx77KNVkZSfA,4,2,4,iRT6cNWK4iTpFokZahpz9Q

2741112,2013-04-15,1,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"My girlfriend and I had been planning a trip to Las Vegas for several months. I have had enough the of the Las Vegas greasy buffet meals so I began researching other places for us to eat while we were in town. While searching the main Yelp page of Las Vegas I came across Mr. Mama's. Upon further review of Mr. Mama's I observed they were offering a Yelp deal of $20.00 for $10.00. After reading the wonderful reviews of Mr. Mama's I purchased a Yelp deal. 

My girlfriend and I decided to pay this place a visit on our way out of town. Mr. Mama's was located right off of the 15 south so that made the decision even easier knowing we did not have to backtrack. 

My girlfriend and I were able to find Mr. Mama's very easily. Mr. Mama's is located in a very industrial part of Las Vegas, Mr. Mama's is actually located in a small little strip mall and you would probably drive past this place without giving it a second thought, well if you are in the area have a third thought and stop, you will not regret it. 

The vibe inside of Mr. Mama's is a great one. The chairs were lawn chair type of deal but seemed like a more upgraded version of such. The tables had a nice little beach theme going with all types of Ocean life displayed on them. 

My girlfriend and I walked in and were seated right away. Soon after we sat down our waitress 'Julie C' came over and asked if we would like anything to drink. Before ordering our drinks I advised 'Julie' that we had purchased a Yelp deal ($20 for $10), Julie asked if we purchased it several weeks ago, I said we did. Julie advised us that Mr. Mama's no longer offers that deal but they would honor it. My girlfriend ordered a Black tea and I ordered a decaffeinated coffee, Julie told me they did not currently have decaf coffee but she would brew some just for me=) I decided now was as good of a time as any to check-in using my Yelp application on my Iphone, when I did I received a second Yelp deal of one free beverage with the purchase of a meal. I asked Julie if we could use both deals during the same purchase and she said we could and we did just that. 

I advised 'Julie' that this was our first time here and what would she recommend we order. Julie advised us that Mr. Mama's is known for their omelets. I was not in the mood for an omelet and neither was my girlfriend. My girlfriend ordered the Breakfast burrito and I ordered the French toast breakfast that was served with 3 eggs any style and your choice of bacon or sausage, I went with sausage patties. 

Both of our breakfasts were spectacular. I absolutely loved my French toast; the bread was egg bread that was crispy on the outside yet nice and doughy on the inside. It was simply amazing!!! My girlfriend's breakfast burrito was pretty darn good; I enjoyed a few nibbles of her food as well. 

Shortly after we finished our meal, the Owner of Mr. Mama's began walking around the restaurant asking all of the patrons 'How was your breakfast,' after he engaged every table in a short conversation he thanked you for your business and told you how much he appreciated you being there. I thought this was a very nice touch; I am very much about supporting local business. I would much rather give my business to a local business than a big chain or Las Vegas buffet. Our bill arrived and with the both Yelp deals our balance was $0.00. We left 'Julie' a nice tip for simply being 'Awesome.' 

I am not sure when the next time I will be in Las Vegas but when that times arrives without question I will come back here. Mr. Mama's is a business that is only open for breakfast & lunch so make sure you call ahead to find out their hours. As we exited Mr. Mama's everyone continued to thank us and wished us a good day, as we exited the doors I noticed a 'People love us on Yelp' sticker on the door and I will have to agree with you there Mr. Mama, when you are putting food out of your kitchen with pride & love that truly shows=)",QSA05SquUKJZnxasypxvjg,8,6,5,nzyHx1Tf988pBJnyZrraLQ

The Western Omelette is made with the perfect combination of sausage, mushrooms, green & red peppers, and green onions. The cooks get this combo just right, and its a large serving so be prepared to have a little extra to take home.

There were 7 of us so it took a while for us to be seated so as we waited, we reviewed the menu to figure out what to order.  

The owner (I think he was the owner?) was awesome.  He kept checking up on us to make sure we were okay while we waited.  The family that was occupying the table he wanted to sit us at was taking a little longer than he had expected.  He mentioned inn a jokingly matter that if we all went inside and stared at them, perhaps they would leave quicker.  That was funny.  I actually went inside to do that but no one else followed.  

When we were finally seated, I had the opportunity to try the:

Breakfast burrito with no peppers and a side bacon
Cinnamon roll
French toast
Chicken fried steak

Julie was our server and she kept my coffee mug full.  Everything was delicious.  The cinnamon roll was sweet but not too sweet.  It had the perfect amount of cinnamon and it was soft and warm.  

The bacon was thick and crispy yet a bit chewy.  It was not greasy at all.  

The breakfast burrito was filling but it could have used more sausage in it to balance out the potatoes.  It was served was fresh home made salsa which was a nice touch.  

The chicken fried steak was also tasty.  Not too heavily battered or oily and it went great with the gravy.  

The french toast was a nice finish to breakfast.  My only complaint would have been the breakfast burrito.

Now that I got your attention, Mr Mama's sure got mine after having lunch there the other day. I was impressed in a lot of ways.

For starters, from the outside, the place looks like a nice little hole in the wall/mom and pop type of place. But when I opened the door and walked in, I had to do a double take. It's kind of like that one closet from that Narnia movie. Yeah, that closet. 

So I am directed by one of the many servers to any table that's available. The menu's are all ready to go on all the tables. What a concept. You come in, grab any available table, go over the menu, order, eat, and you're out. These guys definitely got a system down. I would say I was helped out by at least 3 different servers. That's why their service is very good. They are constantly running around. 

As for the food, I noticed a lot of good choices. But that day, I was really hungry and I was not gonna settle just for any burger. No sir. So I got their biggest burger called Mama's Burger. Damn. This was a case of my eyes being hungrier than my stomach. Two half pound patties, slices of avocado, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, cheese, and an onion ring. At first glance, I didn't know how to attack it. I kid you not, I was rotating my plate just looking for a chink in the armor. In the end, I ended up trying to smash it down with the palm of my hand in hopes of getting it down to the size of my mouth. Needless to say, I could only eat half of it. At that point I felt like running away crying to Mr. Mama himself (or is it herself? I don't wanna assume anything you know?). Ok, so I had dinner covered.

The only thing that might be a disappointment is their hours. 6 am to 3 pm. What if I wanna redeem myself for that burger and it just happens to be dinner time? *flashback to that lunch moment* Ok, I take it back, that's not really a disappointment.

So, umm, yeah go check this place out. Don't forget to redeem your free beverage when you check in.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,17,15,5,ji0BHx98ndT3DVIerNXq-w

It is a bit off strip (even further from downtown where we usually stay), but totally worth the drive.  Don't be put off because it is in a strip mall.  The interior layout is a bid odd because of this, but the decor is nice and the place is super clean.

This is a nice family owned breakfast place (they also serve lunch).  The owner greeted us shortly after sitting down and was very friendly.  I love places where the owner is engaged. The staff excellent and the service was quick.  The food was outstanding and reasonably priced.  I had the Mama's short stack pancakes with eggs.  The pancakes were excellent and the eggs perfect. My wife had an omelet that she also enjoyed.  

In summary, this will be one of our normal places to hit whenever we are in town!",j4-JXlN-DJihIV20yQop6Q,3,2,5,h4LVCPDURtAlDE3IH7A-0A

2906457,2013-09-23,6,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"This to me represents the real Las Vegas that the locals would experience. When you look further than the glitz and glam of the strip you find some charming little (and odd) places. 

Mr. Mamas offers great food in an odd industrial atmosphere. The restaurant is in a strip mall industrial park. When you enter the building you feel as though you should be getting tires installed or picking up wholesale plumbing supplies. But instead there is a kitchen that makes excellent breakfast food! It's so weird!

My wife had the breakfast wrap and myself the Cali Omelette. Although they did mess up my order (I had asked for no sour cream) they were quick to fix it and the server was very nice. I enjoyed the food; it was defiantly a step above Denny's. Fresh avocado and more than reasonable prices. I think our whole meal after tax was $16!

Now the weird thing: they refuse to stock peanut butter! I've never experienced a breakfast place that intentionally didn't have peanut butter!

I had a long chat with the server about this and apparently it's not an allergy issue, and many other people have requested it. She begged me to talk to the owner as he ""will not listen to requests from the staff"" and told me a story that only after enough customers demanded did they finally get Splenda despite the other servers all telling the owner how much it was asked for. 

I found the whole thing a little weird. Had I not been so full from the omelette I probably would have been more annoyed. I ended up not eating the toast as a result. Just can't do jam. Too sweet. 

So anyway all and all it is a great place to eat. Nothing special or exotic but if you are looking for cheap eats off the strip come on down. Good basic local food in an interesting location. If it were not for the owners not listing to their staff if give it 4 stars. I'll update the review on my next trip to Vegas.",OPtv-lFAgcddoUuHCcTHUQ,2,1,3,1NPgc0w39vkPfwiiiwJpNQ

Place was busy around 11 on a Monday. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes, but no big deal. Figured it was a good sign. 

My companions were happy with the Philly Cheesesteak and Ruebens. The side salad that came with the sandwich looked good and hearty, and I'm told the ranch dressing was good. I don't know if it was homemade or not though - doubtful. 

I ordered a Cali omelet as a scrambler. Brilliant as I'm not really a fan of omelets - never a good egg to stuffing ratio. It was very yummy - topped with pico, sour cream and avocado (ripe!). My ONLY complaint about it was the sausage was chopped up cheap processed patty sausage. I would have preferred crumbled sausage or at least a higher quality processed patty. (I am happy I did not order eggs with sausage patties on the side as I would have been very disappointed.)

Sourdough toast was also delightful. For some reason I was hungry for toast so it fit the bill perfectly. 

Service was good - friendly and fast despite being busy. 


Overall it was pretty good. I wouldn't say it was GREAT breakfast, however. I'd love to try a cinnamon roll (looked great).",qntMtvOSAOpkjyOlTp3q-w,1,1,4,i6hV9OH0NcyshVjWF0yJrA

My boyfriend selected this location after asking a friend of his who used to live in Vegas where a good breakfast spot was.  His friend told us to immediate go to this spot.  To hang up and drive as fast as legally possible.

We're so glad we listened to him.  Mr. Mama's is a hole-in-the-wall spot but you can tell it stays busy, with the amount of tables packed into the restaurant.  We were immediately greeted by everyone and seated, with our beverages soon to follow.  If you don't know what you feel like eating, be warned.  EVERYTHING on the menu sounds delicious.  I went with an idea in mind but still ended up having to choice between 3 dishes.  I settled on the chicken fried chicken dish and loved it.  Juicy on inside, moist on the outside and nice, thick country gravy.

The owner came up to talk to us when we were done--it seems that it's his M.O. there and is a part of the charm of Mr. Mama's.  He pointed out that he remembered chicken fried chicken from his childhood and that's why he included it on the menu.  Hands down, this was one of the best food spots I've been to in Las Vegas.

We arrived for lunch seconds before they closed (they serve breakfast and lunch only). The kitchen seemed less than pleased (turn off that ""open"" sign!) but we were warmly welcomed by both our waitress and the owner. I ordered a pastrami on rye.

It was a very good sandwich, although the pastrami wasn't stacked high like a deli would do it. After my first bite I thought it lacked something. Seeing a bottle of mustard on the table it clicked that this was the missing condiment. After spreading some mustard on the marble rye I was quite satisfied.

The owner spent some time with us, telling the stories behind some of the pictures on the wall.  He was a very congenial fellow and we enjoyed the tales of his family history.

Prices were fantastic. The food and service was great. But...uh-oh..the bathroom was rather messy with garbage overflowing and toilet paper all over the floor (yelp removed my photo - see below). Mr. Mama's is not conveniently located to the Strip but worth the short drive if you want inexpensive delicious food.

Mr. Mama's yelp stats sure make you stop and wonder what's goin' on here when yelpin' for breakfast options in Vegas.  The yelpster in me could not resist THAT kinda temptation, so I pulled the ""head of the household"" card & off we went.  We weren't thinking much of it, when we first pulled up to its unassuming strip mall location.  Things were hustling & bustling inside though, and we waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday morning before getting a table.  Not bad at all!  Our server, Julie was pleasant to interact with.  It seemed like a team atmosphere here, with everyone working together to ensure a pleasant customer adventure.  We sampled a few things from the menu...

*MAMA'S CHICKEN FRIED STEAK & EGGS:  Nice & hearty meal!  What's wonderful about my dish was my hash browns AND C.F.S. were NOT SWIMMING IN GREASE!  As a matter of fact, all our dishes demonstrated that whoever was runnin' the grill, has got some serious skills and attention to details!  Both were perfectly crisp.  The steak had a good thickness and size to it as well as juicy & tender.  Their homemade gravy had a thick consistency with chunks of bacon and sausage mixed in... so GOOD!  One of the better C.F.S.s I've had in my life.
*MAMA'S FRENCH TOAST:  Well prepared Frenchies!  Moist inside, yet the exterior had a bit of crisp to it.  Just the way my light-eater likes it, so he did pretty good for it being an adult sized meal.  His 3 eggs were scrambled just right with a bit of creaminess to it.  Sausage patties rounded out the big breakfast.
*SWISS MUSHROOM BURGER:  This was probably the best sautéed mushrooms I've ever seen.  And the patty?  JUUUUICY!!  Add to it perfectly crisped onion rings and my Lil Man was one happy camper!
*DOUBLE CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES:  Huge double stack of fluffy dense pancakes dusted with powdered sugar.  Too much for my munchkin to handle but he liked it nonetheless.
*GREEK OMELET:  Big omelet with 4 eggs stuffed with feta cheese, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and spinach.  And again, UNGREASY, perfectly crisped hash browns. Delicious!

Mr. Mama's is yum!  No, really... YUM!  Yes, there is a gruff, simple look to Mr. Mama's, which is quite the opposite of the extravagance of The Strip, BUT ya kinda expect that with a name like ""MISTER Mama's!  The entrees we ordered were breakfast perfection, as was the burger, of course ;) and all ""the blue shirts"" were friendly and attentive.

Even offered us drinks on our refill to go for our drive back to San Diego. We were shocked! No one has ever offered us that before. We were kinda shy and cought off guard by the offer . So sweet! The best service and best food. Will be back again.,cHtc4MyOpjcclOHwcucwHA,0,0,5,2epFGt7EK5QG5-2ErWgOSw

Well New Years day they were closed so we were sad but we found another great place if it happens again. 

We came the next day Jan 2nd and had breakfast with the kids and they were amazed at the cinnamon roll. They ordered their food and said yummy.
We left a tip for the Kitchen and of course our waitress got a nice tip. Food was hot fast and fresh.

Now on Saturday the 3rd we came back again and had same table and waitress. We ate and had a great time again and left tips for all the help. Trust me you will not be disappointed with service. We counted and had four if not five different people ask if we needed anything or cleared plates quickly.

They will be moving about a mile up Russell Road in a week or two. I hope address changes on yelp so I can visit them when I come back to watch the Super Bowl at the end of Jan.  I would miss my chance to being a regular.",aI1Em2C76_2tuaaLyNxO6w,1,0,5,0Ffqp1WFljN57OjJepTd-A

Okay Mike !!! Chicken Fried steak. $9.75???? And enough left overs for another meal!

Mr. Mama's is located about 10 minutes away from the strip, convenient if you need to fuel up (both yourself and the car) before heading out go town. It's on a block with auto parts stores, but will be easy to find because there will probably be people waiting outside when everything else is closed. We ended up waiting about 10 minutes at 9 AM, but the crowd grew bigger and bigger as we ate.

My standard breakfast order is biscuits and gravy, but I decided to mix things up a bit (just a teeny bit) with chicken fried steak. Our waitress asked if I wanted to sample the gravy first because it was a little different - made with sausage and maple syrup. The gravy is a little different, very thick, with a hint of sweetness and a bit of tang. Still delicious though on top of a very crispy chicken fried steak. The hash browns are to die for - quite possibly the best hash browns I've ever had. Super crispy, like how did they get this thing so freakin crispy?? Pancakes are really fluffy and the French toast is made with huge thick cut bread.

I can't wait to come back. I seriously started salivating at the thought of those hash browns. Great service, everyone is very friendly and we were checked on constantly. Definitely a hole in the wall to check out!",CK-W4WhlmLKOZF-50WmmpQ,11,2,5,uXqY-5x_MVBUIf_QERelMQ

My fiancé had the veggie omelette which he enjoyed. It was a good portion of veggies and eggs; one didn't overpower the other. My brothers ordered the Mama's French Toast and Mama's Burger. Four thumbs up! It became their new go-to for breakfast while visiting Las Vegas. 

The service was also friendly and efficient.

3295028,2014-03-30,4,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"Here are the ""negatives"":
The food is average; better than Denny's but not deserving of 5 stars or (omg) the ""#1 vegas restaurant"" on trip advisor. 
For example, the over hyped french toast is  just standard egg bread french toast. What makes it disappointing is that they serve it with Land O' Lakes ""48% Fresh Buttery Taste Spread.""  I prefer butter. Any breakfast place that warrants 4 or 5 stars should serve real butter. Also, they dont have real maple syrup but serve the corn syrup based maple flavored stuff. Again, I guess most people are OK with margarine and corn syrup, but I dont care for it and I dont think that makes me a food snob or a ""foodie.""
The hash browns were cold in the middle and bland; barely crisp. 
The hot tea (this is admittedly a nit pick) was just a cup of hot water (eg no little metal pot for a second cup) and a tea bag. And $2.25--no bargain. 
The eggs and bacon and toast were fine. Standard fare. 
My friend's omelette was average. 
Maybe the gravy and biscuits are excellent, but we didn't try them. 

""Pros"":
Friendly staff and good prices.

I ordered french toast and eggs.  BF got french toast with eggs, hash browns, ham and coffee.  The price for 2 meals and a coffee was under $16. Not bad!

We had the Chicken Fried Steak and the Cali Omelette. Both absolutely delicious. Not greasy like many breakfast places in town. Lots of flavor and spices. And the Cinnamon Roll was also amazing. Very soft, warm and fluffy. 

The people are very nice and there is plenty of staff so that they can spend more than the usual attention on each guest. The owner Nick is such a nice guy, and he has a great philosophy; focus on his product and the rest will follow. He spends his money on his staff, which makes the product amazing for his guests, and they leave happy and tell the friends and then yelp about it. That is money better spent than on advertising a poor quality product.

I ordered the double chocolate chip pancakes stack without powdered sugar and butter. Along with the pancakes are eggs done your way, and a beverage. The pancakes are huge, and I love the crunchiness of the chocolate chips. As for my scrambled eggs, they were delicious and legit. None of that powdered box crap ""eggs"" are served here.

Service was with a smile, plus it was quick. My friend and I arrived just before the long lines formed, but still had to wait. However, we were seated within 10 minutes. Our food also arrived shortly after placing our orders. Speaking of lines, do expect to wait.

It has to be earned.

With our Las Vegas trip planned  for the PBR Finals, I had already Yelped and decided what places we were going to try on out trip.

Mr. Mamas was at the top of my list.

We got to Mr. Mamas and were immediately seated.  
The staff was so friendly.
Our server was on the spot, my coffee cup never got below half way.

I had a Cheese Omelette (Pepperjack) and added tomatoes.
Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.
and he also ordered some French Toast.  Everything was DEEEEEELICIOUS!
The portions were generous.

Last but not least talk about REASONABLE PRICE!!! Our breakfast was only $20!
We redeemed the YELP check in offer for our Beverages.

We had a lovely chat with the owner about his and his families history in the food business.   I loved the old photo they have of one of their restaurants in Detroit from long ago, complete with the mob guy in it coming for his weekly protection money.

The next time I am going to Las Vegas I am going to be more excited about my trip to Mr. Mamas then my trip to the rest of the town.

Great Breakfast and a wonderful owner and staff.   I so look forward to eating there again.

Located in Las Vegas off The Strip but in a small strip mall and w/in two miles of a strip club (it's Las Vegas after all, so most likely) Mr. Mama's stands as a testament to delicious food served up in nothing more than a hole in the wall establishment. They are serve breakfast and lunch and are only open until early afternoon (about 3). It's not a very big place and the wait for a table can be a little long.

We visited on a Sunday afternoon (around 1ish) on our way home. There were already several parties waiting ahead of it. We walked up to the guy working there to put down our name on the waiting list and he was super friendly and offered us all menus to look over while we waited. This was good since when we were finally seated we had already made up our mind what we wanted. My wife ordered the Cali Omelette, my friend got the Mama's Burger, and I ordered the Mama's sandwich (turkey, bacon, onions, avocado on an onion bun) w/ a side of hashbrowns. As we waited for our food, my eyes drifted over across the room to their tv that had the current NASCAR race on. I halfway expected them to have a copy of ""Mr. Mom"" in the DVD player.

The food came not too long afterwards and was extremely hot. The hashbrowns had a decent amount of flavor and were nice and crispy just how I like them. Dat Mama's sandwich tho- turkey was delicious and there was plenty of avocado inside. The onion taste overall was not overpowering and everything tasted fresh and plate presentation was awesome. My only gripe was that I noticed every plate on our table had some sort of small chip in it and a spot or two on the wall next to us also appeared to have some minor paint chippage, but honestly this did not affect food or service and should be an easy fix.

I really liked this place a lot and the friendly service and wonderful food certainly warrant another visit on a return trip to/from Vegas.

3577084,2011-10-12,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"I reviewed this about 6 months ago and things have changed a lot here.  Apparently the owner of the place had problems with the people that were running it before and came in to do everything himself.  The result has been great.  Not only is he a very friendly guy but he has added new menu items, the old ones use better ingredients, and there are daily specials with lower prices.  

My standard is the bacon & eggs.  The eggs are made just right, the bacon is a lot better quality than before, and the bread used for the toast no longer feels like it's pumped full of air.   Now instead of just hash browns you also have the option for home fries which are fresh and very good.  At the time of this writing if you show up between 6 AM and 10 AM there are several breakfast specials that are usually $0.50 off.  That means you can get a sit down great tasting bacon & eggs with home fries and toast for less than $5.  

Unfortunately every time I go I'm in a breakfast mood and thus I haven't tried a lot of other things on the menu.  There are hamburgers, deli sandwiches, salads, and even some things you wouldn't expect like lasagna.  I believe the owner is Greek and there's a definite Greek flair to some of the menu items, such as being able to get feta cheese on a lot of things as well as gyros on the menu.  

Service is great and quick.   I've been here probably a dozen times since the owner has taken over and I have no complaints.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,7,2,5,PPjy_LRg9K9znoI98ZyVaA

A side avocado slice that had turned Brown and pinkish white tasteless tomatoes added insult to injury. 

Plastic chairs and tables round out a generally depressing atmosphere, with staff who are too cheerful to tell how bad the food is or how much they're screwing up. They got reprimanded by the owner for just about everything he could think of right behind me.

The owner (who happens to live a couple of developments down from me in Henderson) greeted us as we walked through the door, added us to the wait list, and gave us a menu to peruse while we waited.  He advised that there would be a 15 minute wait, but it turned out to be less than 10 minutes.  While we waited I noticed that he interacted warmly with everyone who came in and kept a keen eye on the food coming out of the open kitchen as well as on the service.  This is an owner who takes great pride in his restaurant (IMO) and I appreciate that.  Once seated our waitress was quick to take our order and bring our drinks.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and I am told the coffee was very good ($2.50 each).

We started with the cinnamon roll to share.  This thing is huge!  It came out hot and fresh.  The icing was too sweet for my taste, but I ate around the icing without issue. $3.50

I had the short stack pancakes (2 cakes) & eggs with extra crispy bacon.  The pancakes were also huge, but they were fluffy and had a nice traditional flavor.  I almost got through one!  The scrambled eggs were good and the bacon was thick cut.  $7.45

My dining companion had the steak and eggs w/ hashbrowns.  He advised that the hashbrowns were fantastic, and that the steak was okay, but he would likely order something different in the future. $9.95

We felt that the pricing was reasonable, the staff fast and friendly, and the food was good.  I like that you can order breakfast all day, but the burgers and some of the other lunch orders coming out of the kitchen also looked appetizing, so I may try one of those next time.

As we were leaving, the owner shook our hands and asked about our experience.  Nice to see he cares this much.  We will be back.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,7,5,4,IOiegKd9lQ6UiNqqAo6lzg

3884242,2014-11-12,9,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"ANOTHER BIG TIME FAIL FROM MY YELP COMMUNITY!!

Craving some serious breakfast after a long night of partying. I had already bookmarked this restaurant prior to my Las Vegas Trip based on the stellar reviews. We ventured away from the strip to this restaurant located in an industrial area inside a small strip mall don't flinch you might miss it. 

My wife and I arrived at 1pm., placed our name on the wait list, Very friendly gentlemen greets us and tells us there is a 25min. wait. I says no problem. We were seated within the time frame, our waitress takes our order right away as we were starving. I usually stop at Starbucks to get a coffee when eating at most breakfast spots as the coffee tends to be weak but I overlooked my instincts lazily and decided to try theirs. Well unsurprisingly the Coffee was super weak. As soon as I added creamer it turned milky instantly. My Bad $2.50.

Food/Prices- I opted for the DENVER OMELETTE with home fries and Toast Price was decent under $9. I asked the waitress if I can sub bacon for the ham that comes with the denver she said no problem.  Our order took a little while to come out. The presentation looked great big portion for sure; better than it tasted. My OMELETTE- TOTAL grease pit, they used tons of oil to cook it, plus the cheese stuffed inside was your poor quality cheese used at most LA style burger joints that increased the greasiness further. First couple bites were very mushy eggs were not cooked that well, upon further inspection I also noticed very little bacon in my omelette so I began to open it up and noticed they didnt even cook the bacon at all prior to stuffing it in my omelette. The potatoes were the only thing that came out good they were hot and crispy. I couldnt finish it even though I was starving i did enjoy the potatoes but was very dissapointed. 

My wife ordered the French toast special, served with Eggs and Bacons under $9. Her eggs also cooked with tons of oil, bacon was good. The French toast that everyone raves about was weak yo. First of all it was served cold, next it had no flavor you couldnt add enough syrup to give it flavor. No moistness, no tastes of eggs or cinnamon ever touching the bread. Maybe they dipped the texas toast in milk and pan fried not sure. Was a total fail. 

Waitress came by asked us how our food was, I told her I was disappointed with the french toast coming out so cold. She opted to warm it up for us but by this time I was completely disillusioned with my meal. I decided to pay, leave and will not come back. 

Prices are Good; Portions are Big, Service Is Good, However, I prefer quality over quantity food was not on point. Sorry Yelpers this was a fail dont do it! Should have tried the breakfast spot at my hotel not worth the hassle of leaving the Strip.",twx2ZgFUbat87vGQ_tFbPA,4,0,2,rEwnf1K8WXqAKIpv0wE-6A

My vegetarian husband got the California omelet.  Be forewarned - it is not vegetarian!  He read through it on the menu, and normally the meat would be listed first.  Well, he saw a string of vegetables, and clearly stopped reading.  With a name like California, I think he also assumed it wouldn't have sausage.  Well, he found out after he scarfed it down, that it had sausage.  Well, at least he enjoyed it going down...
My daughter got the double choc. chip pancakes, which were the special of the day.   AMAZING.  The pancakes were so light and fluffy.  The double choc. didn't mean choc. chips in choc. batter though.  It meant white and milk choc. chips in regular batter.  Will post picture.

The great thing about this place is that you are greeted by the owner when you walk in and again while dining, and again when you leave.  There are very few restaurant owners who meet and greet you in Vegas so this is really a nice touch. 

The menu is simple and the food is great.  Breakfast and lunch.  The tourists from Las VEgas Blvd flock here, amazing and well worth the drive.   If there is a line, usually only a 10 - 20 min wait, so no worries.

I don't eat beef, so no idea about the burgers.  

The CHEF SALAD may very well be the best of Las Vegas.  Also, Mr. Mama's makes most of its salad dressings, incredible.  

Their french fry's are unique, not sure what is on them but so addictive.

The hash browns are to die for.

The Veggie omelet is also easily the best of Las Vegas.

The tuna sandwiches are great.

Well buffets out of the question and we weren't feeling the In Casino Cafe's so out comes the Iphone and Yelped. On a side note, Can I get a shout out for Yelp! Damn, seriously. How did I ever survived without Yelp? It's got everything you've ever need as far as getting info on nearby Eats. There's folks that are still in the stone age era using the ""yellow pages"". Who uses that anymore? I get home, I see the new edition on my doorstep and out goes to the dumpster. No need for that hunk of junk. Now back to our regular scheduled program. 
Read a few reviews on other restaurants and Mr. Mama's stood out. Didn't have a ton of reviews or pictures but all were positives except one from Sam T. that gave 3 stars but his review was positive as he's gone there 4-5 times and the only part that didn't meet his expectation was his order didn't have onions as he requested. But Nick (owner) followed through and granted his request. So I think the 3 star rating was harsh and unwarranted. Hope he reads this and corrects his rating. 
I had the Mr. Mama's French toast and it came with eggs and Sausage/ham/bacon. I chose the sausage. The portions were plentiful and left me wanting for more. My wife had the Denver Omelette and she loved every bit of it including what she called the Hash Browns... amazing. 
Our waitress, Julie, was amazing and attentive. Ear to ear smile and that gets contagious. We almost wanted to give her a hug on the way out. Weird? or just great customer service that are hard to come by nowadays. Nick, the owner as mentioned above was super cool. He was in the process of updating his Yelp page as we were there and even surprised us with a complimentary dessert (Cinnamon Roll). Thanks Nick! 
So all in all, we had a great experience and will definitely be back whenever we're in town. Mr. Mama's is now stamped in our routine books as we hope to be regulars.",DH1RJp2dUrq2U94-70HELw,4,2,5,raABZu9rw92S24R_mpldBw

Also ordered the steak and eggs which is a thin rib eye, home fries, 2 eggs and toast for only 10.00. Then we also ordered the Cali omelet and that was 4 eggs, home fries and toast. Total with drinks came out to 35.00 for 5 people!!! The Cali omelet was so awesome!! Sour cream on top, sausage cheese and grilled veggies with avocado.

We lucked out with only a 5-minute wait, but I have a feeling that this is a rare occasion here.

I had the breakfast burrito, a massive tortilla stuffed full of egg, peppers, mushrooms, cheese, onions, topped off with a spicy (though not overly so) sauce that was, quite simply, to DIE for.  Coffee was delicious and plentiful - the server kept coming back and refilling, over and over, without being asked or even prompted.

My husband had the Greek omelet and said that it was easily one of the best he'd ever had.  I didn't try it for myself (which I'm now sorry for), but I could see feta cheese and lots of filling spilling out over the sides, which is always good news when you're hungry and hung over!

The decor was ... interesting.  Sort of almost like a farmhouse, country style - the chairs are actually in the style of wooden recliners, something you'd see on a back porch somewhere in a rural area.  Service was great - I think the owner was actually in there running things on the morning we went.  Prices are very, very reasonable (especially for a touristy town like Vegas).  

Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  We've found that a lot of the best places here are in little tiny strip malls like this one.  

Mr. Mama's is well worth the drive and you'll get better food (and service) than any place on the Strip - I'd lay money on it.

The Cali omelet with sausage and cheese topped with sour cream, salsa and avocados slices was fresh, hot and super tasty. It was served with hash browns and toast  I loved it!

French toast was fluffy and soft sprinkled with powdered sugar. Not overly sweet or doused with too much cinnamon or vanilla which can really ruin french toast. It was served with scrambled eggs (not seasoned much so you'll need to shake on some S&P) ms the bacon was crispy on edges and chewy. 

Portions are big so be ready to get your grub on! 

They have oj, cranberry, apple juice, coffee and the standard soda options.

As soon as I entered, a server told me to sit anywhere I was comfortable.  That's what they said to everyone entering the restaurant and it's really a nice way of saying, ""Come on in.  You're welcome here.  make yourself comfortable.""

I had coffee quickly and the server gave me the password for the wifi which was quite zippy.  I like when it works the way it should.  I ordered the Cali omelette which is Cheddar Jack Cheese, Sausage, Pico de Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Topped with Avocado.  With it came hash brown potatoes and two slices of swirled rye toast.  The menu says all omelettes are made with 4 eggs. 

The breakfast was really very good.  My coffee was refilled and I had a good time watching the cooks do their thing behind the counter.  They do a fair amount of take out and it was interesting to watch them get the boxes and bags ready.

Mr. Mama's is in the commercial area in the Valley View/Decatur area and there are a number of car repair places there.

We ordered a side of home fries for 2.50 and honestly the side and what came with the food still didn't quite make up a great serving. People rave about the amount of food but I am but sure why. The omelette was supposed to be 4 eggs but there is NO WAY that was the case. 

So about that coffee. I could tell when I saw the waitress pour it and I could see through it like water that it was a problem. Very disappointing. Fortunately I was so cold that it just was nice to have a hot  beverage. Service was very accommodating and friendly.

I should start by saying the place is packed. We waited 30 minutes for a table, and word is that the wait is pretty standard...but it's worth it! During the wait, we had a great conversation with the owner, and we quickly saw why people were loyal to this place. He seemed like a really great guy running an honest establishment.

When we finally got seated, we realized that the great service is universal at Mr. Mama's -- everyone was friendly, our coffee never ran out, and our food came out quickly. Not to mention, the food was just what we were looking for -- simple diner-style breakfast.

So Mr Mama's is a heart and soul Breakfast brunch place that is heard but not seen. Hanging out with elite Yelper HH and her trusty sidekick RM, we after many back and forth landed at Mr Mamas for a hearty meal before a few sneaky afternoon beverages.

Like a lot of hidden places here in Las Vegas, Mr Mama's is located in a strip mall, with a small sign and a far from cafe or restaurant styled front of house.

Once inside Mr Mamas, it is clear this business is a well Oiled machine. With a basic decor of blue walls, TVs and a few paintings Mamas isn't anything fancy to look at. This place let's the food do the talking. Ordering the Denver omelet, white bread toast and an ice tea from the menu, our group waited maybe 10 or so minutes for the food to start rolling out.

The Denver omelet was great, your typical omelet done right! The Hash Brown Potatoes were a little dry but tasty. Others in my group all loved the food, particularly our golfer Freind Shaun, who destroyed his breakfast sandwich like some sort of golf crazy hulk monster with zero body fat and huge guns!

My hubby came to pick me up for lunch and we headed over to Mr. Mama's.  We walked in and stood at the front for a few minutes before we were greeted.

My hubby got a Reuben and it was delicious!  I had the chili cheese burger and it was ok.  The burger was awesome but the chili was weird.  I am a chili con carne style chili girl and the chili here was more of the Midwest style of a more tomato-y style.  If I had just gotten a regular cheese burger I think I would have been much happier.  Oh well.  It wasn't bad, just not the style I really like.  Don't get me wrong, I still chowed down on the burger though.

We finished up our meal with a cinnamon roll that our server recommended.  It was one of the best cinnamon rolls I have ever eaten.  It was a big one and we decided to split it.  Once we started eating it though, I think we both wished we had ordered two so we wouldn't have had to share.  Ha ha!

Be sure if you take a cab to get a card for the taxi service - there are not that many cabs around so you will need to call to get one to get you back to the strip or wherever you are staying.",poysGbmxvnniBWbNybgpUQ,0,0,4,TIsOs5efM8C7-sGx3TS8Ow

Nick is very proud of his establishment and also shared a family story of the pics he has on wall. I love the fact of how spacious it is and they do not pack you in like sardines. If this was a breakfast spot in Los Angeles they would have added at least 15 more tables so that when you get in and out your seat it's like moving down a movie aisle row with butt in people's face, ridiculous!!! But anyway our fabulous waitress informed us they are moving to a bigger location next year, so I'm sure this will be even better. So I had the biscuits n gravy, they let me sample it first because it is a distinct flavor, and something different. Flavorful and fresh plus they have nice size portions.

I agree with others in that service here is excellent.  Servers are nice, prompt and attentive.  Coffee was decent and servers make sure your cup is always full.  Portions are generous.

Veggie omelet:  ordered only egg whites with very little oil, and they did a good job with it.  Came with cottage cheese, which I like, and toast.

Steak and eggs: smallish piece of steak but not sure we really should be eating more than that.   Hash browns were crisp but tasted greasy.

They gave us a fresh cup of coffee to go when we asked for a cup for our current coffee --  that was nice of them!",io0hdSvRt7OosDYv2mKRzA,0,0,3,58alsHPZ-SA5YWC4NCbmBg
4286433,2012-04-18,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"I was on vacation in Vegas last week and just did a quick Google search for breakfast locations on my phone. After skipping over all of the chains (I hate them) and the really expensive locations in the major casinos/hotels, I found Mr. Mama's. 

Although the location (in a strip mall) didn't really give the impression this was going to be a positive experience, I can gladly say first impressions are not everything.  As others have said, if you don't have the address already, you would likely pass it right by. 

The restaurant is modestly decorated, but very spacious and clean! The tables and chairs are nothing fancy (read: just plastic outdoor furniture), but the staff was friendly and the food was fantastic. 

I had the veggie omelet with egg whites and hash browns. Nothing fancy, again, but very well prepared and a great value for the money. It was a two egg omelet with lots of veggies packed in. 

Two others in my group had french toast (which I had to try) and it was also delightful. Well prepared, sweet, not too sweet though. 

Now my sister had the homemade biscuits and gravy, and let me tell you, they were FANTASTIC. The owner stopped by and asked how everything was and mentioned that it was HIS recipe and wanted to know what we thought. It was great. The sausage seems to be more of a standard sausage, not breakfast sausage. So there is a bit of a flavor difference, but it is different in a very GOOD way. The biscuits were moist and fluffy. I would highly recommend that dish. 

Also, again, the owner came over several times to check on us, ask how the food was, and just chat a little bit. When he asked how my omelet was, the cook (the kitchen is open to the dining area) asked what I said. It gave me the impression that they all care about what the customers think and how they are doing their jobs. I love that. 

So again, I would highly recommend Mr. Mama's for food, value, and the hospitality!",D43-U7OrkCZ8Ktlnx-oOiQ,2,1,5,nhjjyiO0VU0z4zhgKY8vaA

4293893,2014-06-27,1,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"Well, in my girlfriend and I's ongoing quest for the best breakfast around (that's reasonably priced), Mr. Mamas has entered as a serious contender for first place. 

After seeing all the great reviews on here, and looking at the incredibly affordable prices, we decided we had to try it. 

My girlfriend got French toast and I got the California omelette as a scrambler. 

My scrambler was INCREDIBLE. Seriously one of the best egg based breakfasts I've ever had. The sour cream/salsa/avocado on top really made the dish, and I happily finished up the 4 egg monster. 

The French toast was good, perfectly cinnamon, but not overly sweet.  I'm not a huge French toast guy, so I don't consider my judgement too accurate. 

What was also nice is that they had little coffee mate French vanilla packets. I haven't seen any other breakfast place offer something like this, and I don't know why! I love using flavored creamer in my coffee, it's one of my favorite things about drinking coffee, and having that option here with unlimited coffee just made the value that much better!

The service was also great, and we really enjoyed chatting with the staff about the food and the restaurant. 

The decor was basic, but works just fine. I would say watch out Babystacks (our current number one), but the truth is they are very different. For an omelette? I'm going here. For a sweet breakfast of specialty pancakes and other sweet items, I'm going to Babystacks.",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,2,3,5,ECyQ4gOTrMJsgNAZPz_zqg

There was 4 of us and as soon as we arrived there was a huge group of people waiting to get seated. The gentleman, whom we assume is the owner, greeted us and let us know it would be about a 30 minute wait and asked if we wanted to stay or go somewhere else. We decided to stay and the huge line in front of us dwindled down quickly and we were seated within 20 minutes tops. 

We got served coffee and it was delicious. The coffee was very smooth and it just tasted like good quality fresh coffee. Each couple ordered the cinnamon bun to share and it was huge. It wasn't the best I ever had but it was very good. 

I decided on the chicken fried steak with a side of pancakes and it was delicious. The chicken fried steak was nice and crispy and the meat was juicy. The gravy was delicious and had great flavor. The pancakes were amazing, not everyone can impress me with their pancakes but these were perfect. 

My partner and her friend both got something from the lunch menu while me and my friend got something from the breakfast menu. We all were in heaven and we all agreed that the place was great.

Nice staff. No wait to be seated. I was by myself. I ordered two eggs and toast. That's it. After 25 minutes, I asked my server about my eggs. She mentioned that there was a big to go order. So basically, somebody sitting on their ass was more important than a customer sitting in the actual restaurant because his order is bigger. I asked to talk to the big buff owner who made me feel that I'm selfish for wanting 2 eggs in less than 25 minutes. He was also confrontational, rude and slightly threatening. So I got up and left. Wasted my time and showed me how much he values me as a customer. I guess he didn't really need my money.

I was finally able to get a table here this weekend with no wait; I know that's a rare thing here. We usually do a little drive by on Sunday mornings and opt for another breakfast location when we see the horde of people standing around the door. But this Sunday was our lucky day!

The staff was super super friendly upon our arrival. The ""Make yourself comfortable"" line got me too. It's a very customer driven way to say ""Have a seat."" Nice touch, guys.

I wasn't impressed with the menu. It was incredibly ordinary. It was pretty much your standard diner/American fare menu. No playful item names or interesting combinations. I was at least hoping for an original take on an breakfast tradition (I love that!). 

I opted for an egg white veggie omelet and my partner went with the breakfast burrito. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and white nice and pipping hot! However, I really can't say that there was anything memorable about it. It was a standard egg white omelet with a side of toast and fruit. I did appreciate that the waitress told me the fruit was out of a can. Many places wouldn't be so forthright with this information. The breakfast burrito wasn't great either. It was a little on the greasy side and a tad undercooked on the hash browns inside. The food was done well, but again, just very standard.

What I took away from this place was the stellar service. Julie, our waitress, was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. She told us they all read the Yelp reviews and do everything they can to improve on their business with the customer feedback. Multiple members of the waitstaff came to check on us and refill our coffee - all with a smile. 

Like I said at the beginning of my review, I really want to like this place, but there was just nothing memorable about the food. If you are craving a simple home cooked meal with stellar service, this is your place.

2. They don't serve fresh fruit. (only fruit cocktail out of a  can) 

3. They don't serve real Jam. 

If you serve breakfast, and do not meet at least one  the criteria listed above, then your establishment belongs in the same echelon as Dennys. 

Why this place has 4 stars and 630 reviews is beyond me. I question if I even at at the right restaurant? 

During our wait, the host gave us a 5 minute speech on how ""the owner buys only the freshest items for the menu"". - Fresh like a can of fruit cocktail.

Sorry to kill the buzz here, but I am sure Mr. Mommy (if he even cares to read yelp) would appreciate some constructive and much needed feedback amongst the hoards of shallow praise.

thick, meaty gravy with bits and pieces of sausage, bacon and a sharp smear of maple flavoring all atop dreamy, flaky biscuits. a must re-order

home fries cut so thinly, they were almost potato chips

eggs cooked to a T.

&a breakfast burrito that could rival kelly's back home. a smidge shy of crispy on the bacon, but it makes up for it in melty, cheesy goodness and a homemade habanero salsa that Hoang T. said he would drive 400 miles for

& the best part? why, mr. mama, of course! ""the wait's gonna be about 20 minutes, is that alright with you folks?"" ""would you like some water while you wait?"" ""this here is my grandfather....""   just like in the movies..

Update:
Breakfast was so good we went back for lunch. My wife had a great Cheese steak and Onion Rings and I had a Mr. mamas burger (1 Pound). Both were excellent. One thing we noticed just sitting there. Do you ever notice how they usually clean a table in a cafe. Just wife off the table right where the people were sitting. At Mr Momas we watched them take everything off the table, then wipe it down and then dry it off. Each and every table, each time someone got up and left.

Sadly, the cinammon roll is NOT homemade, as it seems judging from the big picture on the Yelp Mr. Mama's homepage. There is nothing special about it at all, in fact. Coffee wasn't great but I've had worse. I appreciate that they tried to use a bit of seasoning on the homefries, but they could definitely use more! Without a doubt in my mind, this is 2.5-3 STAR FOOD PEOPLE.

Mr. Mama's is good though, if you want a straight up omelette at a fairly decent price. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but I would come back for ""breakfast"" if in the area, or to try the chicken fried steak. 

The waitress was VERY nice and checked in with me often +++++ The owner also seems to be a sweetheart, so I hate to burst your 4.5 Star rep, but I gotta be real.

The food: excellent. The first time we ate there my son ordered a burger for breakfast. He loved it so much. That's the reason why we came back again. 

I had an omelette the first time and couldn't finish it all. Big enough to share.  The second time I had the BLT sandwich.  So good, couldn't finish it, but took the left overs to go and had a great snack on the plane back home.

I was confused and thought we might've turned into the wrong plaza, but nope! Upon arrival, the door was opened for us by a friendly gentleman who also seated us. Menus are already on the table. Everyone here is extremely nice and attentive. We opted to order the Biscuits and Gravy with Hashbrowns, French toast (2), a Cinnamon Roll, and a side of Sausage Patties.

Biscuits and Gravy: One of the best I've had thus far. Different and delicious! It was perfectly seasoned. Since the gravy is prepared differently, the waitress asked us if we'd like to try a sample of the gravy first before committing to the dish, but I was already set on getting this dish and needless to say, I was really glad I ordered this! Most places overly salt the crap out of the biscuits AND the gravy, but not here! You won't be disappointed!

Hashbrowns: Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I don't know how to describe the exact seasoning, but it's not just S&P. It's surprisingly good! Crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside without being mushy. Mmmmm, more please!

French Toast: Standard, but still satisfying. It's hard to make French toast really stand out unless you get fancy with flavors.

Sausage Patties: Great flavor and cooked well! I hate places that cook the freakin' meat out of the damn patty to where it is hard and dry!

Cinnamon Roll: By far the most disappointing thing ever! It did not taste like a cinnamon roll...plus the icing was all powdered sugar. I prefer the cream cheese based icing for cinnamon rolls, or if you're just going to go with the powder sugar icing, at least flavor it in some way so it tastes more than just wet powdered sugar. Yuck. I feel like the Pillsbury crap is better and tastes more like a cinnamon roll. I wouldn't buy this ever ever ever again.

For myself, I had their French toast and a side of bacon.  FT was pretty good and the side of bacon was a nice, generous portion.  Also, their coffee was really good, I sure love my diner/greasy spoon coffee.

I split the chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravey and california omlette.  Everything was super average.  You know when you can tell if a dish is appetizing from the moment you see it? When I saw my chicken fried steak, I knew it was overfried, the quality of meat was NOT good, and the Cali omlette was simply too greasy and just overall Blah.  The biscuits and gravy was huge--and just Not good. 

I can't even get into the specifics about the composition of the dish and the flavors, the meal was not worth the calories and grease.

On this day, I was to meet with two friends who live at different ends of the valley from myself.  I live in Henderson, along the I-95, another friend lives downtown and the other lives in Southern Highlands.  We needed to find a joint in the middle.  Nothing better than an opportunity to use the good 'ole Yelp app to find a stellar joint!  When I pulled this place up, I noticed that there were 400+ reviews with an overall rating of 4 1/2 stars.  In my book, that's amazing!  

The first thing I though of when I arrived was that it's located in a very awkward strip mall.  The mall consists of auto detailing shops and auto parts shops.  Then there's Mr. Mama's, a brunch joint opened until 2pm.  When I walked in, there was 30 minute wait.  Smaller place, compared to other brunch joints in the valley, however, it was quaint and homey.  Another thing you notice are the blue walls.  Holy moly, that's a lot of blue. Must have been a really popular color to the owner.  The table tops are usual 4-seaters, decorated with blues, yellows and greys.  Our server was young and super sweet.  She was pretty attentive the entire time and was super personable.  

For brunch, I got a couple of things.  The first thing was the Western Omelet for $7.50.  This 4-egg omelet was stuffed with sausage, mushrooms, peppers and green onions.  This dish comes with your choice of potatoes, I chose hash browns, and also came with your choice of toast (mine was wheat).  The omelet was huge!  Full of flavorful sausage, chopped red peppers offered festive color and the hash browns were nicely fried.  The outside was crispy and the inside was soft and delicious.  The only think I noticed was that there was a lot of oil on the bottom of my potatoes and eggs.  So great but a little greasy.  I would still recommend this, though!  My second brunch item was the full stack of pancakes for $5.75.  It was 3 pancakes stacked with butter and maple syrup.  The cakes were light and fluffy, pleasantly fragranced with buttermilk.  Nothing beats a good pancake for brunch!  Everyone should also add this on to their meal :)

All in all, I definitely see the hype to the ratings.  I will definitely be back for more in the future.  This is a great place, centrally located and offers a great menu for brunch.

Food -3.5 Stars
Pricing - 5 Stars

The service was good (I did however feel a little rushed), pricing was great, but once my omelette came out and I dove into it, I was a little dissapointed. Dry, and pretty tasteless - Nothing worse than a dry eggy omelette. The avocado was delicious and gave some more flavor to my food. I was happy such a large serving was given to me with my food. The portion was huge but I needed to add ketchup and salt to my food. The service really saved the day on this one... I would be willing to go back since the price was right, but just try something else.

Don't be fooled, it is a mom n' pop shop inside. The staff was super friendly and knew we found them on Yelp (they said a majority of customers are referred from Yelp).

Reviews in YELP shows many positive feedback but I am pretty sure they are all related to the burgers and omelettes served at this place.

Ideally a salad should be served as per the room temperature and if it says grilled chicken then it should be freshly made and warm. At this place when the server brought my salad it was freezing cold even the grilled chicken. It seems they just bought this salad from some kind of freezer. This proves that they do not make it fresh, all veggies are preserved even the chicken must be old. It was so bad that I returned back the entire salad. Didn't asked money back as they should always know through customer feedback so that they would really think about improving their standards.

Seriously guys what it takes to make a simple salad? Please work on basics and then go for the main course.

Not recommended to anyone if they are going for health food at this place.",AkorXek0of7KCvgqgLtPeg,2,0,1,8wZh_2UGQG04w9Y2uPIidg

I went with the Chili & Cheese Omelet ($7): Cheddar Jack Cheese, Green and Red Bell Peppers, Green and Red Onions, and Mama's Chili. The chili was a bit sweet and watery in consistency...I'd order something else next time around.  I also noticed the eggs weren't as ""fluffy"" as I am used to, comparing it to other omelet specific spots in town.

Since their chili is relatively popular, I either missed it on a good day, or my taste buds prefer thicker-hearty chilis with a hint of spice. This was a bit sweet, boring and not for me.

I'm sure I will be back at some point...I'll try some of their other goodies next time.

I went because I have been craving chicken fried steak, and this place popped up on yelp. I book marked it and visited when in the area.  

Close to the strip, so compared to the hotels, the prices here are really favorable.

I ordered the chicken fried steak ($10.50)-came with choice of 3 eggs (soft scrambled), potatoes (hash browns), and toast (biscuit). The gravy was creamy, thick and included not only ground sausage but bacon pieces (my waitress told me about the bacon-had she not, I'm not sure the taste was noticeable). The hash browns looked perfect (I was trying to assess whether fresh potatoes or from bag/processed-I couldn't figure it out for sure). The crust was perfectly fried and the flavor of the chicken fried steak was pretty good. The eggs did not have a lot of flavor and assumed it was carton/processed scrambled eggs. 

The Pros: 
- value (good/large portions for the price). 
- the owner and staff are very friendly and communicative.
- I ordered, literally, before I sat down in the chair at the table, food came out fresh and hot, 10 minutes later

The Cons:
- the parking lot is busy/full on weekdays - little strip mall with at least 6 other businesses 
- wait time can be unexpected. I went on a weekday at 11:45ish, and the wait was 15-20 minutes-the est. was right on
- the atmosphere is not great. I think overall, it felt a bit dirty.
- I sat by the kitchen door and later (after I ate half of my meal) noticed that the shelves had a lot of cans (tomatoes, beans?) and boxes (biscuit mix). I prefer when I go out to eat minimally processed/fresh/scratch made food. I can use pantry items and boxed bake mixes myself. I wondered more about how scratch made my meal was-this may seem kind of nit picky, but when you go to small mom/pop places, I think it is more likely/expected.

Overall, my visit was OK. Would I return, maybe, but only if close by. I also would have to consider the time/day as I gather (based on other reviews), the wait time can be long.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,3,1,3,N1bWbAK5kh1njudlP02BMA

Double Chocolate Chip Pancakes with Two Eggs and Bottomless Coffee (Daily Special)
Single Serving of French Toast

One of the longest standing members on my breakfast 'to-do' list and a place to which I'd purchased a $20 discounted gift-certificate some six months prior it was finally on Saturday that I drove down to Mr. Mama's and although the small breakfast and lunch spot is unlikely to win any awards for innovation it can only be said that this truly is a place committed to putting a smile on each patron's face.  Undoubtedly a locals institution in which nearly every other customer was a regular with orders frequently anticipated by staff it was just past 7:15 that I was invited to seat myself and with no less than three servers offering to get me coffee as I perused the menu it became immediately apparent as to why the restaurant was filled to capacity by eight o'clock.  Focused mostly on diner staples with a whiteboard of specials just left of entry while prices trend far lower than almost anywhere else in the 702 my meal began with Mr. Mama's oft-raved $3.50 cinnamon roll and with a soft, yeasty base rife with cinnamon and butter beneath sweet frosting the hype proved justified, a smallish biscuit proving less worthy its $2.75 tab, though still quite good.  Preceding next to plates more hearty it was with a thin slice of French Toast that my meal moved on and opting this time to bring my own maple syrup from home the result was improved, though still nothing to write home about, particularly when compared to fluffy flapjacks studded with dark and white chocolate, a daily special matched with two eggs and at least six cups of coffee for less than $9.

Likely generating its fan base more through low prices and friendly service rather than by location or particularly excellent food I cannot say I'll be rushing back to Mr. Mama's soon, but for locals on a budget or those with little one's looking for a good breakfast at a great price the restaurant definitely fills a niche - the open-kitchen of blazing-fast line cooks and televisions tuned to college football providing a bit of entertainment for those interested in such things, as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,3,XiXppxsvofOtQSaaSuF4vA

This place is super blue. Blue tables, blue chairs, blue menus, blue walls...everything's blue. They say the color blue makes you lose your appetite. I had a particular song in my head:

""Yo listen up here's a story about a little guy that lives in a blue world
And all day and all night and everything he sees is just blue like him inside and outside
Blue is his house with a blue little window and a blue corvette
And everything is blue for him and himself and everybody around
'cause he ain't got nobody to listen to
I'm blue da ba dee da ba die...""

Mamas Homemade Biscuits and Sausage Gravy:
2 buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy, potatoes and 2 eggs. The gravy was so good and the biscuits were homemade. 4/5

Western Omelet:
Made with 4 eggs and for an additional $1, I got mine with egg whites only since I don't like egg yolk. This has sausage, green onion, peppers and mushrooms, a side of potatoes and toast. 4/5

Hashbrowns:
The best I've had in Vegas. Very tasty, crispy and golden brown on the outside, soft on the inside. 5/5

Cinnamon Roll:
The size of a small plate and smothered with glaze sprinkled with cinnamon. It was a tad bit dry and doughy. Eat this quick before it gets cold. 3/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,5,4,DdqSG13uuNA9QCBlku2HQg

5339867,2013-02-26,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"We saw the great reviews for this place and decided to check it out last Sunday morning since it's right down the street.

My hubby was hesitant at first because its location is not where you would think a good breakfast place would be (it's in a strip mall next to a faucet store and a hardware shop).

The moment we walked in we received top notch service. The kitchen is behind an open counter and all of the guys behind it said hello and welcomed us. There were about 5 other tables but one was like a party of 10 plus. We sat next to a table of a couple who apparently were regulars because both waitresses referred to them by name and gave them an affectionate hug and ""how have you been"". All good signs.

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak and I took the waitresses advice and ordered a daily special - the breakfast sandwich and beverage for 7.25. I had went online took advantage of Yelp's 10 for 20 deal but our bill only came to 19 bucks so I didn't.

The steak looked awesome and the gravy looked delicious. The hubby ate it right up. He said that he like it - it wasn't too greasy or fatty and the gravy was great. My sandwich was quite yummy - but the bacon was the chewy kind - not the crisp kind like I like...but my honey told me that he prefers the chewy kind (I learned something new :) so no fault there.

I must say I really enjoyed the coffee and I'm quite the coffee snob! My only complaint was the eggs were underseasoned - both mine and his but nothing horrible - they were definitely cooked perfectly.

I thoroughly enjoyed when the owner\manager guy came by and asked us how the food was. He ended it with a sincere ""I appreciate you guys, Thank you"". And for whatever reason -- I really believed the guy -- he seemed like he really meant it!! Plus the waitress was really on it and she even said, ""did yelp bring you guys in"" and we were like yes... I still can't figure out how she knew that.....lol


We are definitely coming back. The hubby was drooling over the Mama's burger pictures so we are itching to use the coupon for a big lunch.

The price, service, and food were top notch and we are looking forward to coming back!

It is clean and the staff is friendly but there is nothing exceptional about the breakfast other than the long wait to be seated.

Mr. Mama's fit our criteria of being fairly close by, affordable, and having fairly decent reviews. The location in a sort of random strip mall didn't inspire thoughts of the greatest meal, nor did the somewhat ordinary looking interior. Thankfully I've learned not to judge a restaurant by its looks and Mr. Mamas did not disappoint.

Between the omelet,  pancakes, and french toast that was ordered at our table, nobody had any major complaints. Given the atmosphere and the prices (which are very affordable), the food was probably better than we were expecting. The side of toast could have used a bit more butter up front, but that's nothing a little extra jelly won't compensate for.

The service was friendly and attentive. By the time we left they had a pretty decent crowd in there. We considered stopping in for breakfast the next day, but slept a bit late and opted to just get on the road for home instead.

We shared a few things. Their famous fried rice, I can't remember the name right now... and it was phenomenal. Now, I will always think that my papa's fried rice is the best but this place came pretty close, and that is a huge compliment! We also got their red velvet pancakes.

A ""whole in the wall"" type of sit-down restaurant with a cozy, quick and painless menu. 

My sister and I were exhausted from our last night on the Strip and were headed back to Phoenix. We looked up places to eat here on Yelp and found Mr. Mama's with good ratings, so we ventured off before heading back to Phoenix, AZ. 

The wait was 30 minutes, people packed out the door and the kitchen was non-stop. But the host assured us ""trust me, it's worth the wait."" My sister and I figured since we don't have a Mr. Mama's in Phoenix, we'd sit it out and see if he was right.

It's your typical breakfast food. Nothing off the wall nor one-of-a-kind about the options. 

What IS off the wall was the service. Every single employee was absolutely welcoming, smiling, courteous and extremely helpful being as we were from out of state. Our host was so welcoming and insightful. Our server was sweet, constant and observant. and (who seemed to be the owner) walked around along with the host and made connective, casual conversation with many, if not most of the tables. He expressed his gratitude for all of our service, had a story or two for those who engaged in deep convo and had a smile with complete confidence on his face the whole time.  

Not only will I be back for the yummy food (which, don't get me wrong, everything was cooked to perfection and tasted absolutely satisfying), but for the great customer service my sister and I received.

I placed an order for an omelet with american cheese, bacon, bell pepper and grilled onions with a side of hash browns, Texas toast and grits.  The omelet was good but after a while it tasted dry and like it needed some flavor (some salsa would've been perfect!).  

Order Accuracy: D
My Texas toast because sourdough bread at pickup and my hash browns became onion rings (which come on, onion rings and an omelet doesn't even sound right! I know its Vegas and all but really!?!)

Selection: A
Very extensive menu and it's widened by many options that allow you to ""build your own.""

Service: B
As soon as I walked in I was greeted and my order was ready.  The girl that took care of me had a bit of an attitude, but my day was off to a good start so I didn't let it get to me. 

Price: B
The price for my meal was around $15-17.  To me that's a little steep, but it was a lot of food and I was definitely filled up so I'll meet you halfway on this one. 

Other Thoughts:
Whoever is working the phones/pickup area needs to be an outside of the box thinker.  Like I mentioned earlier, some salsa really would've made a huge difference on the omelet and they included no sugar for the grits.  It just so happens my hotel has a coffee maker so I was able to find some in the room.  You are literally right around the corner from the strip so it's not that far of a stretch to assume that you're going to get a lot of tourists.  If its someone's first time eating here, they won't know the questions to ask when it comes to what comes with the order or what they should've asked for. Be that person that thinks outside of the box for us tourists.",kuJZm9Bpj0ZMnSruSvBjig,0,0,4,uEjn_A3RuUUdxuAyoa0S5A

Then I found Mr. Mama on Yelp. We headed over for breakfast before heading to Red Canyon...there was a 30 minute wait, but if this place is THAT packed and people are waiting with no problem (and they have over 1,000 reviews...) we knew it'd be worth the wait.

I'm still pretty blown away by how good it actually was. You know the feeling...you read the reviews...you see the photos...you over hype a place in your mind so much so that when you actually eat there it's a let down. Well, not here. Mr. Mama delivered! 

First, we have to start with the hostess - who is Mr. Mama's daughter. She greeted everyone with a smile. Handled the list like a pro. Bussed tables. Sat people. Even helped bring out plates. We had to tell her at the end of the meal how awesome she was - I really meant it. That place runs like clockwork mainly because of her. She made it a point to say her dad taught her - love family run businesses!

Ok, so on to the food.

Giant Cinnamon Roll - fluffy, gooey, sweet, delicious. WHOA! Get this. Mind you it really IS MASSIVE...so share it. But man, this was hands down the best cinnamon roll I've ever had. *come to think of it, it was the only homemade cinnamon roll I have ever had, but still....get it!

Choice of meat and eggs - 2 eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. $6.75. WHAT? First of all, it was delicious - BUT THAT PRICE THOUGH!?!?! It's crazy they can make a profit on it. The hashbrowns were great. Eggs are eggs...and the bacon was thick and crispy! It was quality food...at a super discounted price!

The wife had the Cali omelet (minus the sausage) - I took a bite and it was delicious as well.

The coffee they serve was also really good. They bring little french vanilla creamers which might not impress most people, but I thought it was a super nice touch.

Overall, we left stuffed and only spent ~$25. If we lived in Vegas I'd be the DUKE of this place, I have no doubt about it. If you're in town visiting and looking for a great meal on the cheap...hit it up! As for you locals....I envy you.",2qKOL7C7WbG_M3EOWvTFxA,20,12,5,7MagLkNXi9yOesKkdNX_kw

Now onto the food lol I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs with a side of french toast. My stomach did the ordering not my brain because apparently this was way to much food haha The chicken fried steak really good. Good batter, tasty meat, and awesome gravy. Color is a little off putting but after eating it, it was really great with the chicken fried steak. It came with eggs, toast, and hash browns. So it was a full on breakfast and everything tasted great. I thought the hash might have been a bit oily but together everything was still very good. I order the side of french toast ONLY because it was $1.50 haha and I was only able to eat half of it because I couldn't even finish my original order haha.

Came here near closing time and didn't have to wait. Clean. Decent seating area. Good sized menu. Reasonable prices. 

Very friendly main host who came and chatted with us and welcomed us.

Food came out quick. Excellent omelette with the cheese, spinach and chicken all blending in nicely. Throughly enjoyed the fresh avocado on top. Fresh flavorful crunchy hash brown. Great home fries but I liked the hash brown better. Yummy rye bread with butter. Good hot fresh coffee. Excellent waitress who kept the coffee flowing and was very pleasant. 

Love places like these with excellent food, great prices and a warm welcoming atmosphere.

5557773,2013-01-23,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"Vegas was our last stop on the way home from a long 2,000 miles road trip. We did not expect to eat anything exciting on our last leg of the trip home to Bay Area. I was not even looking for breakfast since we gonna have lunch at Bakersfield. But since the drive is 5 hrs away I though we better have some breakfast to start the trip home.

Looking around Yelp, being me, always on the hunt for hole in the wall local eatery I stumble upon Mr. Mama when I select filter $ for price and best rating. The deal was even sweeter with the restaurant special promo. So it was like half $, I was thinking if I got burn by Yelp youngster review, then oh well, who care it didn't cost much.

The place is locate on main street in the middle of a industrial/commercial/office retails. Thanks to my silly Waze GPS, the uncooperative software showed the location of the restaurant on the opposite side of the road. It takes me 2 detour to find the restaurant.

We was seated right way as soon as we entered the restaurant. Our server, Julie (I hope I got her name right after 11 hrs of driving) was prompt and courteous. Due to my clumsiness, I dropped our silverware, and BAM, like a ninja, without asking Julie come right to the table with new silverware within 10 seconds (no joke, she was that fast). We ordered our food, and drinks. I hope they didn't think that we was rude when we asked for hot water to mix our super strong Vietnamese coffee, since we didn't order coffee from the restaurant.

It takes about 15 mins for all of our food to arrived. We ordered Steak n' Eggs, Chicken Fried Steak, Mama French Toast, and Sausages and Eggs, stuff that you would expect to get at any breakfast joint. Our food portion was larger than normal breakfast restaurant especially with the price they are charging. Without further ado let me go into the food quality. Our over-easy eggs was perfectly cooked, no burning at the rim, the yoke was oozing and creamy. The steak also cook as we instructed and tender. Harsh-brown has nice crunch and French Toast on point and fragrant. The French Toast has a rich cinnamon aroma to it and deserved to be one of the better slide I've ever had. Chicken Fried Steak and gravy was amazing, and best of all, none of the frying stuff was greasy, including home fried. The food simply good, and a lot of it. I guess they must have been part of feed America program, the owner send out complimentary cinnamon bun for our table. To top it off our server asked to refill my OJ, this will be the first breakfast restaurant offered to refill my OJ, simply WOW (funny how I ordered 2 OJ since I didn't know they refill OJ)

Some of other reviewer also mention about the level of outstanding service Mr. Mama has. They are all correct. I think people who have the ""LOVE"" for whatever they are doing will provide you the outstanding service, simply because they love what they are doing. It shows from the owner to the server. The owner did come out and chat with us for a min or two. After chatting with him, he reveals that he was Greek descendant, which explains the blue floor to ceiling wall. It's Santorini Blue for those who could not make the connection. I would think it would be nicer if they have some white table or stuff just to enhance the blue.

When ranking food quality for the amount they are charging, it is by far the best food quality vs price. You could go to fancy breakfast restaurant and spend twice as much to get about the same enjoyment without the family, friendly of mom and pop shop where every customer is matter, where every meal is matter, where the word of mouth is how a business survive and thrive. All I could do to support their commitment by patronize the local business spread the words about their great food and left the restaurant with a full stomach (until 10 hours latter, as we did skip lunch at Bakersfield on the way back home.)",AXcuXpZsP3VxhZI6qmfq3w,3,3,5,Uvmn8aJaS_fwzF0Vt2a5mQ

While it is located in a small strip mall off the strip with a very uninspiring front, once inside I could understand the rating.  

The owner met us as we walked in and made us feel immediately welcome and important.  The staff was super friendly and obviously loved their jobs and represented the place well.  The owner also came over to our table once we were waiting for our food (a properly short wait) and told us about the picture on the wall as being from his grandfather back in Pontiac Michigan and the restaurant he ran during the depression.  The owner and his staff rate 5 stars alone and genuine hospitality and appreciation for my business is so unusual these days.

I had a French Dip au jus and my wife had a Grilled Chicken Sandwich.  Both were very good, cooked well with fresh ingredients.  

The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was that the food needed salt and pepper but in my opinion, that is fairly common these days with all the attention being paid to sodium.  A small price to pay (adding salt) for having a very enjoyable lunch while supporting a business that appreciates it's customers!

The food was good, the staff were attentive and friendly and the atmosphere had a family business feel.

I was drawn to Mr. Mama's by their high yelp reviews and their affordability (only ""$"").  
I met a friend there for breakfast and we were immediately greeted by our waitress.  I cannot remember her name, but she was very attentive and patient with us.  

We were a little indecisive with what to order and she recommended getting their omelets and their french toast.  We both ordered omelets and they were both delicious. 
 I cannot remember what my friend ordered, but I ordered the ""Spanish Omelet"" and I was thoroughly satisfied.  The hash browns were crispy, but not too crispy and the portions were pretty big.  
I also ordered a coffee and it ended up being free, because they have a yelp deal for a free beverage if you check in.  

The owner came around and talk to us.  He was very friendly and when we told him that we find out about them on Yelp, he would make jokes about if they lived up to their yelp standards.  

Overall the experience was very pleasant.  I think the menu is decently priced, and the staff is more than accommodating.  
The only thing that I am not too crazy about is the location.  It is nestled in an area where majority of the businesses around them are automotive repair and parts shops.  I missed it the first time trying to find it.  I can see the convenience of it though for their patrons who from out of town or on the strip, because it is near a I-15 Freeway entrance.

I also tried the french toast due to the raves about it, and, again, it was totally standard home kitchen fare. Nothing I would go out to get.

Well you guessed it, this place came up so I told my brother, lets go.

This place is located in an industrial strip mall next to a hardware store. Once we got there there was line almost out the door. 

We finally sat down and ordered our breakfast. 

The wait was really worth it. I ordered the Greek omelet and it was awesome.

The food was fresh and was a hit. I will be back.

They also serve lunch so I will give that a try.

Downfall is the restroom situation has to be changed to accommodate more traffic. It has a tiny bathroom and there is a wait to use it when its busy.",p85Lq9SorEmHjhLZg3l0cw,0,1,4,ZFn6QFjzsnGVF96mrDzEiw

As we walked in the door we were immediately greeted by Nick, who we believe might be the owner, and told us to sit anywhere we would like.  It was lunch time and starting to get packed.  We didn't wait long at all for our order to come out.  After reading the reviews on Yelp prior to going, I was in the mood to try the Chicken Fried Steak.  Told my waitress I wanted the chicken fried steak.  She asked how I wanted my eggs, I told her scrambled.  She asked how I wanted my potatoes - hash browns or what?  What is the what?  Did I have other option she didn't mention?  I just ordered the hash browns and got sourdough toast. I thought the chicken fried steak was very good.  My husband ordered a turkey sandwich with pepperjack cheese with grilled sourdough bread.  It came out with the bread toasted instead of grilled which made the sandwich a little bit dry. Grilled bread would have been better as requested.  The sandwich came with a large side salad which was very crisp and fresh with a very good ranch dressing.  Nick kept checking up on us to make sure we were happy customers.  We didn't mention the bread because we had a limited lunch break and didn't want to cause a fuss.  It wasn't Nick's fault the request was wrong. We had to tell our server twice what bread he wanted and how he wanted it prepared.  If I could choose another waitress I would have.  She is the only thing that really hurt the place getting five stars. When we left the place was packed with only one table open. But overall this is a good, friendly place worth coming to.

We will start with the good.
Food was fast
Hash browns were some of the best I ever had

Okay now that's done, the bad......
The chicken fried steak wasn't seasoned and there was so much breading on it that the out side was crunchy and the inside was mush. I asked three people where my husband and my toast where and it didn't come till I was already done with my meal. My husband never even got his toast. 

Four different people came to our table not once did anyone ask ""how is everything? Is there anything I can get for you?"" 
All the waitresses were huddled around the soda machine talking....one flaying her arms around and one bobin' her head like she was sha nay-nay. All of them asked if we wanted refills we said yes every time but no one ever brought us any. 

What made it worst is when I'm assuming the owner came and asked how was everything I couldn't say anything I took a long pause and all I could say was I just got my toast and I'm done with my meal. He says oh I'm sorry the toast was late. No guy my toast just came as you walked up. All I got was a ""sorry"" 

No I won't be back and I won't ever mention that anyone should go...

5915777,2013-09-09,7,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"I should have went with Breakfast. I should have ordered an omelet. 


Let's start with my biggest annoyance:

I ordered a bottle of water. Menu stated $1.00. They rang me up at $1.25. Only a quarter, so I didn't complain or gripe about it. However, they should charge the prices on the menu or ring items up correctly.


So my coworker read the blackboard and saw a special for Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich. So this is where I talked myself out of getting the omelet. I was like ""mmmm, Philly. mmmmmm, cheese."" So we subbed out the American with Provolone cheese and it was good.

Our meals came, except coworkers was wrong. Instead of making a Philly, they made her pastrami. The waitress caught it so that is good. However, I really hate when one person is eating and the other still waiting for food.

I did order a side salad with my sandwich and I must say, it was a pretty decent side salad. Too big even.

Now onto my Philly. Overall it was a decent sandwich. It was well seasoned. I took two bites with bread and ate the rest sans bread. With bread, you would not have gotten any complaints from me. It all complimented each other pretty well. However, when you took the main ingredient and truly made it stand out on its own, that is another story. The meat was tough and a little dry. The guts of the sandwich came with lots of bell peppers, onions and mushrooms. This is a plus to me but in the end, I thought it could have used more meat.


Customer service was mostly great. I am not sure of the beach tables and lawn chairs but hey, whatever works. They should keep flyswatters handy too because we were swiping those little pesky flies the whole time.

Our waitress also didn't ring us up at the special price noted on the blackboard. She charged us menu prices. So again, it all comes back to my first complaint. 


Maybe if I had ordered breakfast, I would have had a better experience with my food. Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,6,5,3,NLGxus1F-57JjSyB6Mbj_A

My son had pancakes and bacon.

The food was good but not great but I definitely would suggest coming here due to the very low prices, and friendly staff.

It is very clean here and people constantly coming in even on a Thursday morning. 

I wouldn't suggest ordering The chili cheese omelette but looking at everyone else's food on the other tables, looks like they have A lot of delicious items.",mEZKlO9PKDiqOjVZ-lyN-A,0,0,4,Bua_lXn5kNkYZQt0wwNamA

My boyfriend and I mainly go here for the chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes are always cooked perfectly. They're moist and doesn't need any syrup. The chocolate chips are enough. 

Today, we ordered a patty melt since it was a special that comes with a side and a drink. We ordered it with a side hash browns.  The patty melt was delicious! It has grilled onions, rye bread, and our choice of cheese (swiss). I loved how it was completely customizable.  The hashbrowns were also cooked perfectly.  The top and bottom was nice and crunchy. 

The service is also very good! They are always kind and courteous. 

The only down side is that they are usually busy during breakfast and lunch time.  But a busy establishment usually means that they're good, right ?

They say 20 minutes wait but it's usually not that long. Ordering take out takes only about 10-15 minutes for the order to be ready. Fast service is always a thumbs up!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,3,3,5,f5wFfSGfwz5GEBNKDJ0Ing

We were greeted warmly by Mr Mama himself and were seated quickly. As we perused our menus, our drink orders were take and Mr Mama chatted with us a while. He told us they have been open for two years now and 80% of their business was tourists, which I found pretty surprising seeing as they are in a relatively industrial and local area. 

The place was packed but service was hospitable and quick. Refills were on point and the food came out quickly. My ham and cheese omelet was solid and so was the albacore tuna melt. Very tasty and reasonably priced. Everything we had was fresh as well. Definitely sad that it took me so long to give Mr Mama's a chance.

With service and food as fabulous as it was, I anticipate returning to Mr Mama's often.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,7,4,a7npZQ_wqarf8Itq_Cn6YQ

This place is fantastic! Service was awesome. Food came fast and it tasted fabulous. Not to mention the cheapest breakfast we have had our entire stay! Will be coming back here every time we visit.

5962906,2015-03-16,4,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"I was very intrigued to eat at Mr. Mamas.  Saw them listed in Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the U.S. for 2015.  They were #77!!  Well, I was very excited to try them, but they did not meet my high expectations.

We visited on a weekday at about 9:30am, and they were packed!!  Fortunately, the wait was only about 20 minutes so we decided to stay.  

My cousin ordered the Cali Omelet ($8.50).  It looked amazing!  She said that it tasted pretty good too.  

My wife had Mamas Short Stack.  I got to taste hers.  The pancakes were good, but not outstanding.  ( 3 stars )

I had their Chicken Fried Steak.  Looked good and tasted good too.  Better than the average diner.  ( 3.5 stars) 

Read about their Cinnamon Roll being really good.  While I found it taste fine, I was not impressed.  ( 3 stars )

Mr. Mamas in Las Vegas can be recommended for serving good diner food with a smile.  Much better than diner food on the Las Vegas Strip at much more affordable prices!!

Mr. Mamas is just not better than most diners in my hometown.  With that being the case, I can only give them 3 stars.  They are A-Ok in my book!!",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,4,3,3,L80c222EmEWJqbXAsm7U2A

5968431,2014-12-11,0,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"What's a girl to do when faced with the responsibility of choosing a breakfast joint the day after a long road trip? Yelp, and Yelp it good! I exhaustedly scrolled and read reviews. ""Black Bear Diner,"" I thought, ""Nah, it was just okay and the dishes weren't clean and lipstick stains were every where on our utensils and cups there... Oh, ooh, Mr. Mama's? What a paradox! Let's look at the photos...""

I was sold. By the ratings, reviews, and especially the photos. I texted everyone where we would meet in the morning, and on the drive there on a Sunday, the roads were clear and our GPS led us to a pretty industrialized part of Las Vegas that I've never seen before. My friend and I were earlier than three others, but we were instantly greeted at the door and our table was ready as soon as we were given menus to look at. 

The joint is bigger than you would think as they utilized their unit very well with their seating arrangements. But, wait! You don't want to hear about seating arrangements! Let's talk food.

Our table ordered: the chicken fried steak - which had the perfect amount of gravy; greek omelet - it was very great, but I got tired of eating it after a while, but I also added bacon on the side; cali omelet - that thing is PACKED with things, I mean avocado... F'real; and french toast - which was not too soaked with butter or soggy at all.

Overall, the experience was memorable and a pleasant way to finish a Vegas trip with my friends from all around the country. I truly recommend Mr. Mama's for their service and their fast-served, but amazing tasting food!",99KMytx3JyxTFdyUztHkpQ,4,4,5,CgtSQwJsYU1y8toDgvArwg

5982536,2013-03-03,4,jWv5GUtEp30OD5L5C8c2DQ,"I searched for well rated breakfasts in Las Vegas and I think this was the top hit for central Vegas. The reviews were right on the money. An added bonus was the $20 for $10 yelp deal. 

It's in a industrial oriented strip mall on south decatur right off of the 215. It's clean inside and the staff is friendly. I read in previous reviews that you order at the counter. This is only true for take out now. Since it was purchased a year ago, the new owners have changed a lot of things, our waitress said. One of which was table service. So now you sit where you like and order from the menu with a waitress. Nice. The chairs are patio chairs but it's okay. Mainly because I expected a nice little hole in the wall with good food and great prices. That's exactly what I got! Great little place. Down home cooking. Comfort food. 

I had the chicken fried steak special which came with my drink. I think it was $10.50 or $10.25. My son had the corned beef sandwich. I also ordered decaf coffee and they brewed a new pot for me. Refills were plentiful and quick. We didn't need to call our waitress for anything and the kitchen got our orders perfect. 

There is a TV with captions on for watching the news when you're eating breakfast. I always like that. It was constant traffic the entire time we ate there. Pretty popular and that's a good sign. I hope they're around for a long time, I would love to come back. They're only open for breakfast and lunch. 

Both dishes come to the table steaming hot, and with nice portions. Everything was nicely seasoned. I added a little salt and pepper because I always do anyways. They also had tapatio, ketchup and tabasco at table. Btw for the coffee, they had vanilla creamer as well as regular. The decaf is the sort of coffee with a sharper bite. I don't drink regular coffee anymore so it was nice finding decaf with some substance. Not the stuff that goes down mild without any taste. It was good and even better with the vanilla creamer. The gravy over my chicken fried steak was tasty. Lots of chunks of sausage. The breading on the steak was nice and crispy. Not greasy. Big points for that. I ordered my eggs over medium. They got that right as well. I hate eggs that still have a little sliminess in the whites. So it was brilliant. 

If you're coming in with the yelp deal as I did, it's actually hard to use up all of the $20 bucks. I ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu. Drinks are $2.25. Sodas and coffee..etc. Most things range between $6-8 dollars for nice big meals.

I would come here without a yelp deal and pay regular prices, it's on our list of places to eat now when we're on that side of town.",A5h9B2u72GsK3oSmo-Iw5w,6,4,5,OhBDzgtmexddln-7WL_dqw
