106653,2010-12-21,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Went here yesterday for my first Smash Burger experience. Over the noon hour is was quite busy but we had our food within about 10 minutes. This lunch hour wait is on par with In N Out next door. 

I had the BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger. It was pretty good but the application of BBQ Sauce was thin at best. For an extra topping I ordered jalapenos and they came out raw, I was expecting the pickled variety. I probably wouldn't have those again. I also ordered pickles as a topping and these were quite good, thick slices similar to a Clausen, not your typical hamburger pickle chips. 

For sides we had the regular fries and fried pickles. The fries weren't bad, sort of reminded me of McDonald's, although I would have liked a few more. The fried pickles were not too good, pickles were sort of mushy (star deduction) For now I will stick to ordering my fried pickles at Memphis BBQ or Lucile's. 

Second star deduction is the price. Don't get me wrong, the burger was good, but so is In N Out and for less than the price of one burger at Smash, I can get a whole meal at In N Out. I'll be back, but not often.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,3,1,3,DdcOqcHff8zMm-NO4_PphQ

I ordered a Sin City(?) burger with fried pickles and a beverage. It was delicious. The burger wasn't overcooked to an inch of it's life, like most rubes would like it and the fried pickle slices were tangy and suprisingly tasty. I actually got my food fairly fast too.

I've heard about them in other parts of our City. The food is good, but not great. I had the grilled chicken salad and fries. Salad greens not crisp and the chix, so-so. The fries are cut so small that you might need tweezers to eat them! (LOL) Now the price. This small meal was $9.71 without a drink and small tip. An average price of $12 for lunch, right next to many other restaurants with much lower prices will not work for this business. I'm sure the manager at In and Out (next door) is laughing, as his/her sales go up and up. Students have an on-campus meal plan for around $7 ( all you can eat). Why would they pay $12 to walk off campus?

When I came in to pick it up the line was nearly out the door so I asked if I could just pay, without standing in line (since my food was all ready just sitting on the counter in bags) and just grab the food. The girl there said she only had one register open and I had to wait in line. So as I wait for about 15 people, think, decide and pay, my food is getting colder and then by the time it's my turn she opens up another register! Really? She couldn't do that 15 people ago when my food was luke warm?!? Then as I'm carrying a drink and my hands are obviously full another girl tries to load all the bags into my hands. I nearly dropped everything. I'm 7 months pregnant so it's obvious I'm struggling and they don't even offer to help me out or leave my bags or drinks to make a few trips... NOTHING.

It's a burger joint but it took me a couple minutes to figure out the menu and cashier was not really helpful in explaining what's what so I decide to settle on mushroom swiss burger (how bad can it be, right?) and sweet potato fries (can't mess it up either, right?).

So after 5 minuted I get my tray and...
Burger: meat is good, cheese is just 1 slice barely covering half of the patty and mushrooms are... pretty much non-existent. It came with no lettuce and tomato so I had to ask for them from kitchen (and cashier never even mentioned that I need to ask for it all!) 

Sweet potato fries: epic fail... pool of oil on a bottom of the basket! That's the first time ever I had to ask for refund in a fast-food! But heck no, I'm not paying for the oil change... even McD can do fries better.

Bottom line: FAIL. Bill (before refund for fries) was more than $8 (and no drink!) So.... stick with the establishment next door for burgers - for $8 I'll get burger, fries and milk shake. I wonder how long will this place last here...",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,3,0,2,KM7Vj5KkolM3QofUdSdLmQ

Sister and I ordered the Sin city smash burger 1/3 pound and it was not bad! It's on the salty side, though. If the burger didn't have any bacon on it, then it would be perfect. It is not your clean, petite, cute burger. It's greasy, artery clogging, and bold junk for your tummy.

The fries were pretty solid, waaay better than In-n-Out's, whose fries reminds me of eating styro foam. It has a flavorless and weird texture IMO. 

The fried pickles from here are not special and we could've done without. They were not crispy, barely battered and rather pickly (you know, sour and pickled lol). 

All in all, I was satisfied after devouring the helluva burger from here. Satisfied, but guilty. I might need to run 5 miles to jump start my digestion, though. Prior to entering this place, I joked with my sister and said, ""I hope this place doesn't make us take one"".. (....you know, ...a smash? ha-ha) and it didn't! I know, I'm gross.

BTW, one reviewer mentioned that you have to clean up after yourself? I asked the cashier just to be sure and was told to leave my trays where they were.",74MEs3l1jQTaBPpOgv8t7w,2,1,4,kfuDK7w_V6sAe03ozqloRQ

The restaurant was fairly clean. There were some tables that were not wiped clean and the drink station was a bit unkept. 

The food was ok. I had the larger of the two burger sizes available. In my opinion, it wasn't that big of a difference. The flavor of the burger itself was just ok. I like that the burger was cooked on a skillet top, to seal in flavor, but it was negated by being slightly over cooked. Oh yeah, almost forgot, as they did, I didn't receive the style of burger I had ordered, but wasn't on the mood to say anything, so I ate what I was given.

I felt dirty after paying $21 for two people. Bachi Burger blows them away at the price point, or go next door to In-n-Out and spend half the money for a better product.

The burgers are maybe a step above Burger King -- dry, grainy beef that gets its only juice from the grease of the grill. No real taste to the meat, though the saving grace was the preparation I ordered with pepper jack, jalapenos and guacamole.

The fries are OK, nothing special. We had the sweet potato fries, which were nicely seasoned but disgustingly greasy. We also ordered the ""veggie frites"", and what a mistake that was. There was no batter, just some vegetables dropped in oil and fried. They tasted exactly like if they hadn't been fried, yet with all the grossness of hot dripping oil. Avoid the veggies and their $4 price tag at all costs.",GuhSD-jy--l7yG2HvFR8TA,1,0,2,yZuYP1GLfbpNkP7iEvLEXA

Me and bob were walking from the bank, both of our stomach growled, it was so funny, we were hungry for something filling, so we looked around to see what was near us, we saw a In and out burger and right next to it was a smash burger, our eyes lit up. I been craving a good burger. I wanted to try the spicy Baja,(was 5.99 since I got the smash size) I was on a diet, but it looked good so I got that, my bob ordered the bacon cheeseburger(was $6.99 big smash) and a large drink  which was $1.89. Came out to to 14.87 which is not bad if you want a really good burger. 
The tables were nice and clean and customer service was good, but I wasn't say great cause they kept on passing us by when we wanted something. 

We sat right in the middle, our burger's were ready in 15 min, which was great cause we were starving, Were are not crazy about the fries, so we just got the burger. They were so messy, so glad that they had napkins on each table. I loved there sauces, I was a happy girl when I got done eating that burger, so was bob. I think I will get that Spicy Baja again, was SO GOOD, I recommend it!!

I can overlook the fact that my order was screwed up and had to be remade - that can happen anywhere. I got the fries in the olive oil and they did taste good, but were soggy and the bottom ones were left in an oil ""soup."" The burger itself was unremarkable. The meat did seem to have a specific taste to it, but any taste it had was overshadowed by the large bun. It's almost as if the burger had no taste at all. In the end, my throat was coated by something in either the fries or the burger that I was attempting to spit out all day, and similar to another review I read, I had a stomachache for the rest of the night.

On the plus side, the service was great and the people were really nice.

Maybe the stomach issue could be attibuted to the fact that I'm not for the most part used to grossly unhealthy food. If I ate McDonald's after years of not touching it, I would have a similar experience. Given the option, I would instead go ""Fat"", ""Five"", or just go in and out.

Two of my children (in their 20's) along with my wife and a newborn granddaughter checked this place out on a Monday morning around 10 am, they open at 10 am. I decided on the Buffalo burger, regular fries, and a Vanilla Milkshake, my wife ordered the Classic with Haystack Fries, (which are shoestring type onion rings), my son-in law ordered the ""Sin City"", with a root beer float (Hagen-das ice cream), my daughter got a Classic with Smash fries, and root beer float. The total for this visit $47.97. I check out the facilities before eating to just wash my hands and get an over view of everything. The restroom was very dirty, especially the corners and the walls, I won't describe it was just bad. They do have a sign indicating they want to be notified if the restrooms are dirty, but who are you really going to tell with one person talking orders, a line of people in front of her and no one else within eye sight. I liked everything I ordered, the fires are salted with sea salt, I should have asked for no salt. They were very salty; my wife didn't care for the grilled onion on her burger and the Haystack fries tasted like a squirt of grease with every bite. My son in- law loved every bite; my daughter said she loved it all, but I tasted her Smash fries and I didn't care for the herbs and spray of olive oil on them. Our granddaughter sleeps through it all, YES. They offer fry sauce, it has a horsey radish taste to it, not for me.

I guess it's probably a little overboard, but it's a great burger to have every now and then.

2179247,2016-12-17,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"This was my first Smashburger ever, apparently they're in the ""higher prices but higher quality"" burger chain space also occupied by Five Guys, Fatburger, etc. 

Just for an idea, burger/fries/drink here is probably going to run you $10-12. I think the lowest meal price you can get away with would be around $8-9 for the smallest size of Smashburger, regular fries and a soda. 

You start by picking your burger size. I had one of their ""$12 for $7 coupons"" so I sprung for the largest bacon cheeseburger combo'd up w/ Smashfries and drink, which was just over $12 before coupon. For the most Bigly of the burger sizes, I was expecting a meaty patty akin to a small double cheeseburger. What I got was more like what I expected the ""regular"" size to be ... in fact the patty didn't even fill the regular-size bun.  The beef was also questionable, like when you buy high-fat cheap Walmart burger meat, mush it into a patty at home to fry in a pan and don't drain it off, and it comes out all fat-drippy. Regarding beef quality, their website says they use ""100% Angus"" but that's basically a meaningless marketing term (http://www.chowhound.com/post/angus-beef-marketing-term-642330). I expect $12 a meal for a good grass-fed burger, not so much Walmart ground beef. 

I know this is an individualized thing, but they do shoestring fries here, which are by far my least favorite of the french fry styles. The ""Smashfries"" upgrade is only 20 cents extra but I don't feel like it really improves the experience -- they're just tossed in olive oil and rosemary, which makes them taste more like a flavored potato chip. 

To conclude on a positive, the restroom is one-at-a-time and well kept. Also better seating environment than most fast food with a lot of high-backed booths.

tl;dr for an asking price of $12 I feel like the burger size and quality of the beef and the fries is just not quite there. It's a little better than the bottom-dollar fast food chains, but not enough to justify double or more the price. Opening up right next to In-N-Out is ... well, ""bold"" if you want to be nice, ""suicidal"" if you want to be brutally honest. I'm no big fan of In-N-Out but it's definitely a vastly superior value proposition with the quality not standing up here.",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,0,0,2,4xyf4uo_YpY2_NsyG1r37g

2318820,2012-08-09,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"In my opinion, there's nothing above average about these thin, over-salted burger patties. 

Smashburger gets one star for a nice and clean restaurant, and two stars for the smashfries (rosemary, garlic, olive oil - delicious). 

I ordered the Spicy Baja burger. It comes with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, onion, tomato, and spicy chipotle mayo on a chipotle bun. When I placed my order, I asked for avocado instead of guacamole. It wasn't until I sat down that I realized they charged me $2 extra for that substitution. Usually, I wouldn't mind, and correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't guacamole made by mashing up avocado? And the piece of avocado that came on top of my burger was the size of two fingers and all I could do was roll my eyes. 

Overall, the burger was nothing special. The patty was salty and a little dry and did not have much flavor. The burger was not juicy, it was greasy. There is a difference. Why eat here when you can walk 50 feet north and have In N Out?

My friend ordered the Sin City Burger and when he was about half way through his burger, he looked at me and said, ""this just might be the most delicious thing I have ever put in my mouth."" O_o

I walked in solo since I was just getting a take out order. The line was pretty steep and it took a good 10 mins before I could place my order. I decided to have the 1/2lb Sin City Burger(lettuce,pickles,grilled onions,bacon,swiss cheese and a fried egg) w/Smash Fries and my girl got the build your own burger(lettuce,tomatoes,pickles,mayo,mustard,swiss and avacado)w/fried pickles and a couple sides of ranch. Now just from the looks of it, you would think these burgers were great right??...WRONG!!! To spare you my complaining, the only thing I liked on my burger was the fried egg. The bacon was burnt and the burger really just tasted like onions and overcooked meat. Well, thats pretty much what I was eating(Duhh).The ""egg bun"" they have is pretty basic and so are there fries. My girl said her burger tasted like Sh*t(fyi:It didnt really taste like sh*t, I had a bite of it when she was done, pretty bad, but no sh*t taste :) Also, im not an expert on avacado, but is it suppose to be brown?? Well the stuff on her burger was. Lastly, the reason for the 1 star is the lack of quality in simple sh*t that should be good, such as ranch. This had to be the worst ranch ever. It tasted sweet like Kraft ranch you by from Wal-Mart. Cool people, Horrible Food.

I went to like for burger places in two days trying to find a really good burger. On my way home from work I yelped and saw the great reviews so I decided to stop by. Ordered burgers for the whole family and they all loved them. No one person complained. I love how juicy the burgers are. The bums are fluffy and airy and def add to the experience. I also like all the burger combinations. My burger today was go in 60 seconds. I considered ordering another one :-) There are really no cons here.

2759566,2012-09-23,5,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"As Austin Powers would say, ""Smashing baby, yeah!""

I have tried every one of their burgers and my favorite is the Spicy Baja! 

With that said, for you noobs and/or connisseurs, your perfect starting burger and sidekick should be the All-American or Classic Burger and Smash Fries.

All their burgers are made from 100 percent angus beef and come in two sizes. Smash and Big Smash for a dollar more. They also have grilled and crispy chicken burgers for all you chicken fanatics.

The fries and the other sides alone can keep you coming back. Obviously, if you get a Big Smash, good luck in finishing your sides. What I usually do is one of 3 things. 1. Get a Smash size and side. 2. Just get the Big Smash cuz its much bigger so you dont really need a side. 3. For the few times that im really hungry and/or im with people, I get the the Big Smash and at least one side and sometimes two so we can share.

For a complete list of their menu and contact info, go to their website: www.smashburger.com

Service is decent and they try to get your order out in a timely manner. From all of the locations I have been in, their bathrooms are one person occupancy rooms. So sometimes you have to wait. 

Random story. I was wanting to go to Gamestop to look for a game and subconsciously, I pulled up into the parking lot of a Smashburger. I guess from the color scheme it can easily confuse you if you are not paying attention. Nevertheless, I went in and got my Spicy Baja. Of course I still went to Gamestop later on.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,10,6,4,3yIKHbMJOTXGlUXEUfdqfg

Ok now for the review. The location is pretty bold, I mean they actually setup right next door to In and Out. They decor upon entering is kinda trendy, really modern and easy going. My wife and I were greeted with a smile and helped out right away. She ordered the basic Smash Burger with Avocado and some sweet potato fries. The fries were cooked with garlic salt and rosemary of some sort. That made for an interesting blend of flavors in my mouth. I ordered the Sin City and Chili Fries. The fries alone are bearable but nothing worth stopping traffic over. The chili was really simple but the onions made it a solid dish. The real jalapenos is what saved this dish. Without them it would have been just another layer of chili sitting on top of some ok fries. The Burger was awesome at first, then the last half just tasted like soggy egg break covered in egg, beef and bacon. They did however include some really cool ketchup packets with the meal.

I hate to say this, but it really wasn't worth the hype. In fact I don't think ill be going back anytime soon. If i had to chose between them and the competition next door, it would be double double city all day long. I wont waste time comparing them to anyone else, but i will say that there are much better burger joints in Las Vegas then this,",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,5,2,2,SvktegwjfIxU5zOQmx7CKw

2931776,2010-12-18,1,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Smash Burger is in the same vein as Fat Burger and Create: a quality (but expensive for fast food) burger joint.  It probably deserves 3 1/2 stars--putting it ahead of Fat Burger and on par with Create.  

Which isn't to say that Smash Burger is only a simple burger place.  They have salads, chicken sandwiches and a decent variety of toppings (think full classic selection of toppings and choice of buns, but not a cornucopia of exotic toppings).  Generally, Smash Burger has adopted the classic, simple and clean style of a fast food burger joint and improved on the quality of the ingredients.    

Ground beef should not simply be a carrier for the flavor of toppings and Smash Burger gets this.  (Applause sign lights up).  The burger meat is tasty and fresh (not a frozen patty) and I assume that it is full fat because the meat itself is delicious and quite flavorful.  I ordered their signature Smash Burger (cheeseburger with tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, ""smash sauce"" and ketchup).  That's a lot of sauce on one burger, but I could still taste the patty--rich and peppery, textured but not overcooked.  And Smash Burger does love pepper.  The patty had a distinct peppery taste and a similar seasoning showed up on the sweet potato fries.  So, if you order a burger, know that you will have to enjoy pepper.

They do have an inventive list of sides for a fast food place (fried asparagus or fried pickles anyone?).  We went with the sweet potato fries and Smash Burger did a good job.  The fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but the seasoning was peppery and delicious.  It more than made up for my floppy fries.  We topped this all off with a vanilla malt, which was excellent (but, honestly every malt is usually awesome).

All in all, it's a solid on-the-go burger joint.  It can't touch the best Vegas has to offer, but for the price it offers a great experience.  Next time, I think I'll try their Spicy Baja burger and see how the patty does with jalapenos on top.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,4,3,3,sCEw8h7ek-8RIqU3l9rcgQ

Oreo Shake was pretty good as they added
Oreos to make nice crunchy bits instead of it all being decimated. 
The spinach and goat cheese burger was interesting and the avocado club wasn't that special. However the major negative was that the beef patty was precooked like McDonald's. It looked like it too. I remember  the burgers taking a long time to make but my order came out pretty quick. This only means cooked to order days must be over. 
The meat came out dry and a bit unappetizing. Salt may have been used to hide that fact.

2955587,2011-07-12,1,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"I got done with class one day and I was starving, and to no one's surprise the first thing that came to mind is Smashburger.  Very close to UNLV, so it was within the proximity of accessing food before reaching maximum hunger.  The thought of biting into one of the great burgers they have was undeniable.

I ate the Sin City Smashburger and it was good.  I had the 1/3 pounder with fries and it filled me up very well, I can't imagine how filling it would be with the 1/2 pounder.

Now let me note that Smashburger may not appeal to anyone.  You have to be at the right mood and hunger to really enjoy this smashing, oil-drizzling, fatty patty monstrosity to its fullest potential.  To the average eater or person with medium hunger level, it can get nauseating very quickly.  It's greasy goodness can leave you feeling rounder by each bite, the fat patty becoming harder to swallow by every minute, and a guilt trip that can last for days. My only justification for eating was because I'm going to be in the hot sun and swimming for the next couple of hours.  And to be honest, I don't even know if that's enough to burn off all the calories I ate.

With each passing moment I noticed that the burger got saltier and saltier.  Maybe my hunger was dissipating and finally my body started listening to my taste buds.  I could not finish the fries without drowning it in ketchup to lessen the saltiness.

Still, it's an experience.  It's hard to find an unique burger joint with so much greasy and eggy goodness (many of their burgers have eggs in it).  I'd definitely bring my friends over for a big burger eat-out.  I can't imagine myself eating here everyday unless I want to look like a pudgy round asian guy rolling around sponsored by Pizza Hut.  But it's a great place to visit once in a while, probably on a special occasion.

A little greasy, oily and salty, but would it be crazy for me to say that's part of the charm? Because it definitely is.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,0,4,jZc6OSiBLt1BG2oxGPakRQ

However, the menu is much much larger, offering chicken burgers, hot dogs, and shakes, which I've yet to try, and expect to review in the future.  If there was a Shake Shack Burger in the West, Smashburger would be its close cousin.

Sin City Burger:
-designed for carnivores (as it doesn't come with any lettuce or tomatoes)
-beef patty is meaty, flattened, and has a wider circumference than the rest of the burger, so you take more time eating and enjoying it.
-fried egg and caramelized onions complement each other, and the yolk adds to the savoriness.
-egg bun provides a hint of sweetness
-a bit oily, as it was evident that oil was dripping from my fingers.  does not diminish flavor and experience of the burger.

Smashfries:
-crispy
-rosemary and garlic seasoning is superb

Prices tend to be a little higher, as the burgers are fancier than fast food joints.

I don't really mind the food but to be honest, I can't leave the place and tell my self that it was worth the money I paid. 

Don't get me  wrong... the food is good, waaay better than the slop you get at mcdonalds, but keep in a mind that an average combo is around $11+. To me that approaches the same cost as a sit-down restaurant which this is not. Smashburger is celebrated and improved fast food but its still the same stuff. 

The restaurant itself is pretty minimal, big paint words like SMASH and BURGER all over the walls. The tables and seating area are better than would find at most burger places in town but this particular location is starting to look a little run down to me. Cracked seats, food under the table, - it needs maintenance.

You can't really complain about the burgers here though. They are big, taste good and are satisfying. They have enough options and add-ons to satisfy pretty much even the most pickiest of eaters. There are different buns, burger sizes, toppings, everything you could want. The ingredients are of great quality and the food is consistent. 

The fries on the other hand is a totally different story, I've had every incarnation of fries they have on their menu. The smash fries, regular fries, sweet potato friends, pickle fries and to me, they all suck. The regular fries I swear to god are the same thing at mcdonalds, the sweet potato fries look and taste like they have been fried 3x.

I was really excited to try this place after being tired of In/Out and wanting something gourmet but also delicious.  It's a little bit more expensive than going to a normal fast food place, but it is worth it in terms of taste.  I got the Sin City burger which has all the things I love, breakfast in a burger + onion straws.  I love eggs and bacon on burgers, and the egg was cooked decent.  A little overcooked for my liking (I prefer over easy), but it's not exactly a restaurant I would assume cooked eggs to the specific likings of costumers.

Downside, although the burger was tasty it was oily.  Oilier than most burgers I've had.  It didn't take away from the taste, but I know when I'm eating it that I'm probably digesting more calories than a normal burger, which makes you feel more guilty than normal.  Aside from that I also had sweet potato fries which were really good until I got to the bottom and the last fries were too oily for consumption. This place also gives me a small vibe of dirtiness.

Anyway, I decided to give it a chance and finally ate here. 

Upon entering, I was actually a little surprised at how nice the interior looked. It didn't look like it was going to be much from the outside, but the layout of the place is nice and spacious. It has a modern, well-maintained look.

I ordered the mushroom swiss burger with a side of their smash fries.

The mushroom swiss burger was pretty tasty. I decided to go all out and asked if they could incorporate a fried egg in my burger, which they gladly obliged to do! I wish the egg would be a little runny so the yolk would break and add even more flavor to the burger, but this fried egg sufficed (and I guess it's better not being messy lol). The burger buns were soft, the mushroom flavor was there, and the burger patty was juicy -- that's a perfect burger in my book!

Their smash fries were pretty good, too. They were thin shoestring fries that are tossed in olive oil, rosemary, and garlic. They were cooked to perfection and had a crunch to them (but they weren't burnt or brown-looking). I usually don't like soft fries because they get soggy easily, so this definitely was a good choice for me!

I was delighted that this is near campus because it's super convenient for those in-between-class meals. It's a place to go to if you want a more customizable burger than the burgers at In-N-Out next door. In my opinion, it was worth the visit here and you can't go wrong with a good burger for a decent price!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,7,7,4,4VqFLqt6a0p0bZc7wslHFQ

Just as soon as one of the employees finally steps up to the register to take the order...

I had to wait with nobody in the ordering line ahead of me. Maybe two minutes, which wasn't terrible, but it reminded me of the bad service last time. The Mushroom Swiss burger ended up being the most captivating option. It had truffle oil, mayo, mushroom, swiss cheese, and the burger on whatever an egg bun is. I found it to be quite tasty and not too salty at all.

Congrats, UNLV location of Smashburger, you have regained a couple of stars. Maybe I will patronize your business establishment in the future. Having said that, I wouldn't really drive out here (or to the one on Eastern) when I have a fast food burger craving since I'll just fulfill it with In-N-Out or some sort of coupon instead. We shall see.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,0,0,3,r_W-zdwN3bGbyL7r-nNuLw

I love 5 guys burger and fries and the famous In-N-Out, so I was already to write this place off.  Their sign looks like a GameStop, no sure if they are going for the geek crowd.  They have a few speciality burgers or you can design your own.  I went with the Sin City Burger, Fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun, but being from California I added avocado.  I also order a side of their smashfries, tossed with rosemary, olive oil and garlic.  So good, the egg bun is soft and the flavor of the meat has some special seasonings.  Overall, a great burger, but I hope I can get the Sin City burger at the other locations too.

The Bad:  Why has it taken me so long to try this.  I thought they were only in Las Vegas but I just found out they are in San Diego also, when with they be in the OC?

The Ben:  The guy at the counter asked if this was my first time here.  I said ""why yes it is"", then he gave me the total.  I asked ""do I got something for my first time here"" he said ""nope, I just have to ask that"".

I'm not entirely sure how much less factory these guys are.

Their burger is nothing to Yelp about.  Haha.  That will replace ""write home about"" pretty soon.  I liked their aoili sauce.  The only reason they get four stars is that they allow you drink beer at the store and it's only $3 for domestics which is approximately 150% cheaper than a casino.  They ran out of regular fries.  The line was long and it took a while, but seriously, if you want a better burger, you really do have to wait for it.  They give you a number and bring your food to you.  This is a great concept because you get to sit down and drink a beer and FB while you wait.  I still think Five Guys has the best chain burgers around followed by Fuddruckers and Fatburger.  Fukuburger, the Vegas burger truck has mediocre burger patties with incredible sauce.  One of these days, I'll order a Five Guys, wipe everything off it, and put the Smashburger aoili on it or the Fukuburger sauce on it.",Jed-PEquPj78qyejkevQyQ,0,0,4,DkJRtnNm33mSnFb-vihChQ

I asked to switch the mayo for chipotle mayo. I was very pleased with my change, as it turned out great. The chicken patty was nice and thin, and came out hot hot!

4369516,2012-05-10,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"I go by this place almost every week. Tonight was my first time stepping inside.

The layout confused me at first, I wanted to walk straight ahead after entering the doors. Then my friend waived me over to the left side where the menu was on the wall. The counter where you order is near that.

I like the simplicity of the menu. Either pick a burger that they've created or make up your own burger with different options/toppings. What I did not really like was that the server at the counter did not know what ""gluten-free"" meant. He had a very ""wtf??"" look on him. He went in the back to talk with the cook, then came back and brought out the employee handbook. We then flipped through it to find their allergen section. 

Here's what I can remember from the handbook:
* Angus burgers are okay when ordered without the bun and without ""fried toppings"" like the haystack onions
* You might have issues with cross-contamination as everything is cooked on the same grill
* Fries are not okay and there's obvious cross-contamination in the fryer
* Premium and malt milkshakes are not okay (obvious reasons)

We were in a dangerous mood, so we stayed and ordered. My gluten-free friend ordered a Sin City burger, sans onions, sans bun. I got the ""Rebel Special"" all-American burger, sans bun. I also added an egg on top.

The burgers came out on a plate. I was expecting it to be wrapped in lettuce, so it would be more burger-like, but it was like an open-faced sandwich -- or rather, a hamburger steak with toppings. We were given forks and knives to eat it with. Should have taken a pic, but we were starving.

My ""burger"" was decent. It had cheese, pickles, raw red onions, and some ketchup/mustard. The egg went really well with the burger. My only gripe was that the burger meat itself was a tad over-seasoned. Not sure how my friend's burger was, but he scarfed it down quick.

The cost for all this was about $20 (including drinks and a regular shake). Worth it? I don't know. But it was nice to have a ""gourmet"" burger for once.",GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w,0,1,3,93Nwa8_8qaDY3Mtm9U4gKw

Dining room was clean and we were greeted promptly and told they would be right with us. There were only 3 tables occupied in the entire building but the staff was flustered and in panic mode trying to run food, answer the phone, and god knows what else.

My friend knew that would cause jealousy at the house so we ordered 3 more for the other pups at home. We each got the sin city burger, hers with no egg. After a SUPER long wait we got our greese soaked paper bags.......... (like REALLY soaked). Got back to the house and began eating. My burger was ok...... nothing remarkable (Double Double animal style is FAR BETTER) Fries were ok but I got the Olive oil and rosemary ones....... the cup they came in had at least 1/4 cup of I guess a mixture of fry greese and olive oil which made me have to throw most of them away. My friends burger had a big ol fried egg on it so she was bummed out. When it came time to dish out the ""Fido burgers"" I saw that it was just 5 beef patties in a salad bowl......... that's not what was described.

My experiences have been ""okay"" but more like... hey, I've had better burgers than this experiences. Therefore the 2-star rating must be awarded, especially after the visit I had last night after work.

All day I was looking forward to trying out the Baja Burger. I wanted something spicy, something meaty, something satisfying. I figured - this would be it! I was wrong. The burger was actually quite bland, unless I happened to be biting into a jalapeno. There was only a couple times I said, ""Hey, that's spicy"" and even less times I thought ""This burger is totally worth the price I paid for it"". 

I suppose Smash-fans are lovers of all the toppings you can apply to burgers here. Perhaps the different sides you can pair with your burger as well. But to me - it's just not worth the price tag.

Baja Burger - 5.99
Smash Fries - 1.99
Coke - 1.89
Total - $11+

Note that Smashburger does NOT make combos. You must order these things separate. Almost 12 bucks for a burger combo? No thanks. I'll go to a sit down restaurant, pay that much and then leave a bit more for a tip. That would be better than this.

Overall the food was NOT BAD. The burger's bun was actually the most enjoyable thing I had. The Smash fries were not what I expected. Yes, I tasted the rosemary, but not so much the garlic. Plus my fries were teeny tiny fries! Like, I had gotten the bottom of the entire batch!

First of all, this review is specific to this Smashburger. The other location I go to, the Lake Mead location, is really good, but is more hit-or-miss. This location seems to be consistently good, so I like it a little bit more. 

Now, the food: the food here is good. My burger was really good, the tomatoes, lettuce and onions were good, and the sauce was good, too. It was a good burger! The bread was pretty good, too, so no complaints in that department. The fries were good, even though they were a little bit thinner than I like them. All in all, great food!

The burger itself was great.  I ordered a small make-my-own burger on classic egg bun, topped with grilled onions, fresh jalepenos, fried egg, avocado, and goat cheese.  For some reason, this combo truly worked.  It was darn tasty.  The egg was not runny at all, but it still added a special flavor.  It was initially forgotten when my burger arrived at the table, but was quickly brought back.

I also ordered the sweet potato smashfries.  The concept of the added spices is great on fries, but the sweet potato fries looked double fried, completely different than the regular fries my friend had.  Also, each bite tasted like soaked in oil - and it was oozy.  I did not eat much of the fries.

It is quite expensive (especially with my add ons) but the small burger is the right size and as a clean slate is under $4.  I would return for my specific combination of deliciousness.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,4,2,3,qaAp-1eX1KtmxSOYBjrGLg

4620460,2010-12-23,5,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Let me preface this by saying that this is solely a review of the Sin City Burger. A coworker made a Smashburger run for lunch, so I put in an order for a 1/2 pound SCB. I haven't been to the restaurant, so I have no idea about service or environment.

Having said that, the SCB was crazy good. It's a little strange that the burger patty has almost twice the square inch-age as the bun. I guess that's the result of the ""smash"" in the company name. Despite its juiciness and relatively small bun, I was somehow able to eat it all without mess. Maybe I'm just biased towards any burger containing egg, but the SCB is oh-em-gee good.

I've heard good and mediocre things about Smashburger. I'm glad my experience swayed to the good side. I noticed they have malts on their menu. Ever since I learned that Sonic no longer does malts, I've been looking for them everywhere. I foresee Smashburger in my not-too-distant future.

This isn't my favorite location but it's close to work so I come here pretty often. Everyone has always been nice, place is clean, never any issues... Yesterday I got an email introducing their new Spicy Cowboy burger which looked darn good. The picture not only displayed the lovely burger but it detailed the ingredients as well. I called Smash, ordered this new burger to-go and it was ready for me right when I arrived. So far so good. Usually I drive straight back to work and eat my food... but this time I decided to sit outside on Smashburger's patio, and I'm glad I did. I ordered the large size, but mine seemed very anorexic. I took two bites and thought, this can't be the right burger. I recall several items listed on the advertisement that I'm just not tasting in my mouth. I pulled the email back up and noticed my burger was missing key ingredients, bacon and bbq sauce (how do you forget bacon on a bacon burger). I know it's a new burger, but if the picture in my email has the ingredients, I'm pretty sure they have it in the kitchen area. I went back in, went up to someone that looked like he had authority (he had a special red shirt on), explained the bacon was missing, he looked at me and said ""okaaaaay"" (kind of in a ""what do you want done"" type of tone). I was taken aback by that response. Then he said ""so do you just want bacon added on the burger?""...seems the easy fix would be apologize for the mishap and make a new burger with all the ingredients...why are you asking me what should be done? I handed him my burger assuming they'd want to investigate to make sure I wasn't lying, and they proceeded to put bacon on my half eaten burger and gave it back to me. I asked ""did you put it back on my original burger?'...he said 'yes, did you want us to make you a new burger?""...at this point my lunch break was running short and I didn't have time to wait for a new burger...I said ""no"" and left disappointed. I'm not so much upset over my burger being made incorrectly, mistakes happen. My annoyance is from how it was handled when I kindly brought it to their attention. Handing me back my original burger that was bit into was ugly. Smh.",5iizOuKy4xK5eXjIS4R5OQ,2,0,1,mXbEuKWkP3azs7bvCPEcTQ

4845413,2011-04-11,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"I'm in love with a burger!  And it's called Smash Burger! 

One of the guys in our party absolutely LOVED this place once he discovered it in Dallas.  In fact, he lives in LA and drives all the way to San Diego to get one; because that's the only place where they have it close by.  So naturally, when we got to Vegas and he found out there was not one, but TWO, here, he wanted to go.  SO I was more or less forced to go.

But I have never been more grateful.  It's funny because the font on the store looks like Gamestop, and our friend works for them; maybe that's how he discovered the place...  Also funny that there's an In N Out just down the street.

It's a $6 burger joint, so you're paying for a step up from your regular fast food joints; and you probably won't eat here every day, or at least couldn't afford to on most occasions, he he he.  The Sin City burger was the bizomb tho, applebacon, cheese, on an egg-bun.  SO good.  Doesn't seem like they use pre-formed patties either.  You can get the 1/3 or the 1/2 point size, I opted for the smaller for this first time.  Also had the fried pickles which tasted like fried zucchini, so that wasn't much of a big thing.  Wasn't too hungry so I didn't get to try the Mint Chocolate Milkshake, but I totally would've if I had room for it.  Definitely gonna hit this place up again!  Gotta try the other burgers!  I could see why my friend likes this place so much.  Good restaurant-style burgers with barely any wait and decent prices!  

Service - It's a walk-up counter, so that doesn't really get factored in here.

Parking - Gonna have to drive or cab it here, cuz I'm sure you're not staying way off the strip, unless you live in the area =p",mteJOlja359dj7XYQnKzCg,1,0,4,la3Hq3CYAh90PlbhDEL16w
4911341,2012-10-22,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Still my favorite burger joint. Got the buffalo grilled chicken on lettuce. Served up with plenty of sauce and bleu cheese. Nom! This burger would have earned them six stars, if I could have that many to give them.

They were out of sweet potatoes - bummer! - but made up for it with great customer service and super cheap Oly beer (flashback from my Seattle days). Being that they are located next door to a college, I honestly wasn't expecting good service (sorry, kids,) but was VERY pleasantly surprised. We were greeted by a friendly person as we walked through the door. She was busing tables clear across the room, but took the time to welcome us. 

The man at the counter was efficient and patient (with my ""trade-this-for-that-and-make-sure-this-other-thing-doesn'-hit-my-food-and-can-I-get-a-salad-fork?"" quirkiness, I have been known to bring order takers to tears. He held up his end with a smile and some friendly banter.) When he came back out to break it to me that they had run out of sweet potato fries, he didn't deliver it in the typical ""sucks to be you"" fashion, but showed genuine remorse and offered to make it up to me. I got free cheese and onions on my replacement order of smash fries. Good job, kiddo.

Was reading some other reviews, where folks actually complained about the spicy fry sauce. Seriously? That's one of the BEST parts of this joint! Some people are so vanilla-bland brainwashed by the likes of McCrapper's that they wouldn't know good food if it bit them back. I mean, for crying out loud, it says spicy - what where you expecting?

4934495,2012-04-14,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"This 4 star review is due to their awesome shakes, so let's start with that.

1.  Shakes - It doesn't get any better when you get a nice thick shake, and also the mixing canister it came in that is half full still of the amazing liquid gold!  Tasty, thick, and just right.

2.  Service - If you go right at lunch it will be crowded. We went during spring break and being next to the university and all, it was still busy with business types.  They ask you if you have been there before, and I said no, and they took my order. I have no idea why they ask you if you have been there, because nothing was explained.  However, complimenting the service is that they deliver to your table and they are friendly.

3.  Selection - Salad, Chicken, burgers, you have  great variety of burgers to choose from. IT is a bit overwhelming to figure it all out, however, everyone enjoyed their selection:

Ceasar Salad with chicken - Nice. Tasty, very little dressing which is perfect, and we added chicken on top. Thinly sliced and very succulent.  

Classic Hamburger with Cheese - Just right size for the young ones. They did finish it, anything larger would have been an issue.

Classic Chicken - Nice. The chicken is also cut so thin, it is juicy and just right.

Beef Chili - Not too spicy. good tasting. Plenty of bits in it and it is not soupy.. Nice and thick...

Sweet Potato Smash Fries - These were very nice indeed. Such a subtle flavor.

Chocolate Shake and Butterfinger Shake - simply to die for.

BURGER: 
Baja Burger: see photo: my bf ordered the 1/2 lb beef baja burger. He said the jalapenos although were raw (uncooked or pickled) werent hot at all. He was kinda disappointed in that but he agreed it was a really good burger. He said he gave it 3.5 stars

BBQ bacon/cheese burger: I loved it. Its bbq was on the side. It had bacon *(which if it was on there I couldnt see it) those onion straw type onions. all on top of an egg bun. It was delicious.the show stopper was the patty. it was cooked to perfection, it tasted like one of those homemade patties that was so good. If it wasnt for the patty I would say next. but ti was THAT good. 

SMASH FRIES: OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC. these were good but i love garlic so for me they could stand to put a lil more garlic on these. 

SERVICE: EH.. Let's face it I'm not coming here for the service.. but for the food and a great burger. the guy that took our order didnt really atually take the order but more like just stood there waiting for us to order. Not once did he say what would you like? etc. So we just pretty much had to tell him what we wanted. He at least asked if that was all after we finished ordering. He was just plain weird. 

Would I come back. Yes. do I hope that guy is there w/ the weird name.. no probably not. this is def. a placed to try.

I would rank it just a bit over In and out Burger, but only cause you have more options here. The Burger are as well never frozen and deliciously prepared. The actual smashing is more a marketing trick to get a new burger chain on the market and visible. But that doesn't really matter. You can taste that the burger are fresh and nicely grilled.

I would have loved to have a chance to see when they are grilled and prepared as with its possible to most IN-out Burger locations. But it is not possible at least not at this location. I have to check others.

But that said i can finish it off with the verdict: it is simply a good burger for a fast food chain.

My husband, Joel and I stopped in on a Friday night. It wasn't very busy and the staff was already starting their closing chores. For a second we questioned if they were open or not. It was only 8:30 and lucky for us they are open till 10pm. 

It took us a bit to decide since we weren't familiar with the menu. I choose the California Burger with no Ranch and Joel ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Smash Fries and a drink. They have a large selection of fountain drinks, but I didn't see any tea. Our food was out to us at a pretty quick rate. My California Burger had avocado, bacon, mayo and tomato on a whole grain bun. It was kinda dry, but I think it was because I asked for no Ranch. Joel's was amazing! It was full of mushrooms, onions, mayo and was dripping with Swiss cheese!! We actually ended up switching burgers. I also really enjoyed the Smash Fries. They were shoestring fries that were covered in olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Great flavor combination. 

I've seriously been dreaming of that Mushroom Swiss Burger since we went. I haven't had a great burger like that in a while.

I got asked for a water cup and they even cut their straws in half to fit the size of the smaller cup. 

Prices are good. A little more expensive than in n Out and I think it just depends on what you're in the mood for - I can't say one is better than the other.  

I wish there were more of these around the valley!  I will be back to try many more burger combos!",rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,0,0,4,MqhbMsueV4NrWYqjQzxvLA

The Sin City burger doesnt dissapoint. I had the Smash fries with the rosemary olive oil. Delicious. The line moved fast and our food came out quickly. Im From Colorado and they keep up the quality of food in diff states which is good. The Lack of people at In & Out Speaks for itself.

5361287,2011-06-18,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"**Summary**
       - Hulk Smash!!! - They really do smash the patty pretty flat. I ordered a 1/2 lb. burger and it was a good half inch larger than the bun. It also creates a slight burnt crisp to the edge of the patty that tasted good.
       - Taste to Guilt Ratio - The flavor of the burger is amazing, but it's also incredibly greasy. I wouldn't recommend for anyone on a diet.
       - Price - The price is comparable to other non fast food burger joints like Fatburger, Create, and Five Guys. Price being equal, I'd definitely shell out my Hamilton to clog my arteries at Smash Burger.
**Price**
       - $10 - $12 for a burger, fries, and a drink.
**Ordered**
       -  1/2 lb. Sin City Smash Burger - One of the best burgers I've had. It features a fried egg, bacon, haystack onions on an egg bun. The patty is smashed flat so it's a lot larger than the bun. The fried egg wasn't runny and it combined with the rest of the fixins to make a delicious heart attack.
       -  Smash Fries - Rosemary, olive oil and garlic added to fries does seems strange at first, but the flavor of rosemary is unexpected and tasty.
       -  Haystack Onions - Pretty much string thin onion rings with a chipotle mayo sauce. I didn't really like the sauce too much, but I don't really like chopotle mayo.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place if you like burgers. It's truly a step above your average fast food burger with the higher prices to prove it.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,0,4,vIXiI6ll3WbvciruuFiufw
5373083,2011-04-07,0,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"UNLV is a virtual Mecca for cheap prices, good quality, and diversity in cuisine. Every time someone brought up burger joints, Smash was a destination worth mentioning. It was never the first on the list, but as I continue to cross out places I have tried, it was time to give them a taste.

When I entered, the cashier greeted me and asked if I had been there before. Usually when you reply no, the other person would explain, but he just asked for my order. That was not a big deal because I am usually set before I step anywhere near the register. The customer service was good overall, because when I did not order a drink, the cashier offered me a cup for water.

I had a job interview today, so I opted for the avocado club smash chicken sandwich because it did not have anything that would leave a lingering smell. If it was any other day, I probably would have gone for a burger with the works. The chicken breast was cut in two to cook faster, I liked this style because it allowed the meat to stay moist and juicy. Often the breast dries out and become overcooked if left whole. On top of that, they add four crisp strips of bacon, four slices of avocado, ranch, mayo, lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat bun. The sandwich is delicious, but pricey for the university area. At $7.99, you can go to In-N-Out and get a double double combo meal with a shake. At Smash, for the price of everything you would get next door, it would run you close to fifteen dollars. The food is good, but for that price I would probably go to Bachi Burger or Holsteins. I could pay a little more for a more unique meal.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,1,3,8WWKpJAkX3kNQZOeD0XRBw

After being wowed at the CMYE at the new location in Henderson, I jumped for joy when Smashburger came up on Groupon. Only having 30 days to use the Groupon, we dropped in when we were sort of in their neck of the woods since this is a bit out of the way for me.

Located near the University, next door to In and Out and across the street from Cafe Rio, it is surrounded by all of my favorites. The restaurant was clean and there were a few but not many people eating. We had no problem using the Groupon and knew right what we wanted: The Vegas Burger, The Truffle Mushroom Swiss Burger, Fried Pickles, a Blue Moon and a Fat Tire.

The beer was brought to our table and we were offered frosty mugs - why yes of course! I love that! The food came out shortly after. It tasted much like I remembered with 2 distinct differences. 1) the Vegas Burger had PILES of sauteed onions! UGH... I like a little bit of onion, but this had seriously about 1/4 cup of them piled on and melted into the cheese... way too much! 2) both burgers were extremely greasy! That was one thing we noted during the CMYE, the burgers were juicy but not greasy. In fact, the owner had touted that they taught the cooks to sear in the juices so it wouldn't be greasy. Also, they toast the bun to keep the bun from getting soggy... well, that was not our experience. I enjoyed the fried pickles however.

The food was good, don't get me wrong, I'll return to Smashburger again... it just wasn't the experience we'd had at the other location, it truly was a let down.",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,5,3,3,__Lx1klxqySM2PwnTwAL1g
5529382,2012-08-27,5,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Found a BOGO deal and I wouldn't come roaring back here based on what we ordered.  What we had was OK but OK just doesn't cut it in a town full of great burger choices. 

Got the Spicy Baja which was described on the menu as with ""pepper jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, spicy chipotle mayo and fresh jalapeños on a spicy chipotle bun.""  Not spicy enough for me.  People who order this want to burn and it fails to do that.  The patty was big and it looked like a great burger but it was overdone to my liking.

I liked my wife's Sin City burger much better.  We actually ended up switching halfway through.  That burger was stacked with ""fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions, haystack onions and our smash sauce on an egg bun."" I ALWAYS want eggs on my burger.  The flavor was much better than the Spicy Baja and if I would order this if I were to do Smashburger again.  

What's with the metal tray things they serve the burgers on?  A plate would've been better.  I found them awkward.  Stuff will fall off your burger and it would just be easier to scoop off something without holes.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,10,7,2,ewwrk181rAXbtVLqsi3MfA
5549945,2011-12-12,3,-AD5PiuJHgdUcAK-Vxao2A,"Awhile ago when Smashburger first came to town on Lake Mead, I gave a scathing review of one of the worst burgers I thought I had ever eaten.

And then time went by and I had a Five Guys Burger and I realized - maybe I was too hasty about Smashburger, as that burger made McDonalds look like a delicious gourmet meal at Joel Robuchon.  I found it that disgusting.

So some Groupons came up and my husband and I jetted down here because he hadn't tried it before.  And I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it compared to the first time.  So I may go back to Lake Mead and try them again and see if I can update that review some time.

But I still have issues with some of the other items - The fried pickles, onion strings, and fries are not that great, still.  And while I love a wheat bun on my burger, the one that use at Smashburger just is too doughy and big for the burgers they cook.  The regular ones (yes I know, white flour bread is bad), are much better.

I also pointed out the addition of fresh jalapeños and showed her that the ingredient was not listed as an item in the menu to which she replied ""yes they are"" so I again pointed to the menu and showed her it was not listed as an item, to which she replied ""ohh but they are and ingredient"" and ip suggested adding it to the ingredients list on the menu.

Visited on Tuesday 8-23-16 around 6PM. $26.32 got us a kids grilled chicken meal, a milkshake, a chicken sandwich with fries, and a cobb salad.  

Yes, I had a salad and a milkshake.  Don't you judge me.  I see you over there with your judge-y looks.  

$7.99 classic cobb salad - Menu says it has fresh greens, a fried egg, applewood smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions, cheddar and blue cheese topped with buttermilk ranch dressing.  I asked for no blue cheese and chose crispy chicken to go on top.  

When my salad arrived I was a bit perplexed....there was a big scrambled egg sitting on top next to the chicken.  The menu says it's supposed to be fried and I guess they broke the yolk and just said ""fuck it"" and threw it on my salad.  I never thought I would say I have eaten scrambled eggs on salad but...there ya go.  Those are the cards I was dealt.  I didn't say anything to the staff about it...I just sat there and ate my weird-ass salad.  Their ranch dressing is gross...tastes like hidden valley.  They use spring mix lettuce and the chicken was perfectly cooked...moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  

We split a $4.29 chocolate banana milkshake and it was perfect.  I like how they serve the milkshake in a glass and give you the leftovers from the metal mixer container.  It makes it really easy to split between two people. 

 My husband got ""veggie frites"" instead of fries and they were delicious and next time I go back I'm going to just get a basket of those and not share with anybody.  They were green beans and carrots shaped like fries and sauteed to perfection.  They taste almost exactly like green beans from a cheap chinese buffet, which I love.

I ordered a sin city burger and it was tasty. The patty itself was well flavored. The bun was soft and buttery. My egg was just how I not like, well done and crispy. But overall it was a solid burger. Bacon was one strip cut in half to try to cover most of the burger, didn't work out so well.

The regular smash fries suck though. Bland, limp and major suck-age. The haystack onions were pretty tasty, just kinda greasy. 

I walked away from this place really enjoying their burger but I don't know if it is the best burger ever.
