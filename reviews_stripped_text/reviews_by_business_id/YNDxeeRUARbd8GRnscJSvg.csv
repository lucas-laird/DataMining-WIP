33872,2014-12-16,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I was part of a 16 person party celebrating a wedding in Las Vegas.  This restaurant was so impressive.  Beautifully, but subtly, decorated for the Christmas holidays.  Spacious floor plan where your table isn't on top of the family next to you. It was dimly lit, inviting and cozy. 

Because we were such a large group, we were tucked into a long oval table that just about had its own zip code! We had one dedicated server--probably could have used two given the size of our party.  Our dining experience lasted close to four hours, which was just too long.  We did have an outside wedding cake brought in and the restaurant was gracious enough. to serve it.  That probably added an hour. 

I ordered Rigatoni (I think--this was a few days and 2,000 miles ago).  It came piping hot and was delish.  Everything was very good--fresh bread, good appetizers and good size entrees that seemed to please all.  I heard no complaints.  Only compliments.  

I live 2,000 miles away, so it's doubtful I'll make it back! But if I lived in the area, I would certainly return!",2PtljXA3PemXAPr2uPQp7A,0,0,5,BtPP7aQOI4O2V5EdTELqUg

I noticed they also offer vegan food on the menu.  I can not wait for a reason to go back.  Maybe Saturday alone is reason enough!   Trust me. Go.

Everything we are was seasoned perfectly and cooked excellently! Try the vegan risotto, gluten free pasta, and the chocolate moose (also vegan). 

The entire staff from the servers to the chef all the way to the GM knows what they are doing and can pair each dish with a delicious wine.

Our vegan food was not tasty. (Try adding flavor to your vegan sauces there's too much nutritional yeast)  Perhaps get staff that aren't prejudice to any kind of humans sex,color, homosexual etc. A happy/nice waitress or waiter is just as important to have during a celebration.

83990,2014-12-01,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Unfortunately, one of the better Italian restaurants in Las Vegas has been reduced to a mere shadow of its former greatness, due to seemingly poor management. 

I have visited this restaurant many times since it opened and have been increasingly disappointed. Last night, the food was below marginal, seemingly pre-cooked and re-heated...both my wife and I soon felt nauseous and could barely finish our meals. 

Prior to dinner, in the lounge/restaurant, our guests and I noticed a sickening smell, similar to that of raw sewage...not particularly appetizing. 

In a city of many notable Italian restaurants, there are several that far surpass this room. Although, when it first opened, this restaurant was in the area's elite rooms, it is now a place to avoid, especially if you value the time and expense placed on fine dining. There are now dozens of preferred Italian restaurants in the area, and this is not one of them in my opinion. I would avoid this restaurant if at all possible.",E_82FE-ua7hBJLtRGm4fdw,1,0,1,eQ26GrjC4pznOXKaaZqr-g

During the lunch rush they're incredibly slow to make something as simple as a turkey sandwich. If you order something pre-made and ""hot"" be ready to be underwhelmed. I ordered the lasagna and its consistently lukewarm to cold. The chicken parm is the same way. The only consistently good thing on the menu seems to be the orzo pasta salad, which is cold to begin with.",wwY5-7d7BaqiOibqnJWZGA,0,0,3,GncYjkn-F1BPODIbQtFEdA

Oh well, we came to try the food and get the service everyone expects when goes out. Otherwise what's the point in getting the experience...About the service: first, please don't forget to give the menu, as we got ours 15-20 later after we sat down, next we ordered drinks and those were served 30 min later. I expect drinks to be served as they ordered, so I could have another one with the meal...but didn't happen at that place. Ordered bread, which was good but nothing special. Once the main meal has been ordered we waited another 20 min for that to be ready and that didn't impressed us at all.

173451,2011-10-13,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"On my previous review I was upset with the way that they added extra charges to our bill without our knowledge, meaning that they offered us things without communicating that it cost something.  It was very tricky the way they worded it.  I used to be a server and would always make sure that the customer knew that something was an additional charge.  
Anyways, I had filled out a comment card and 3 days later I received an e-mail that apologized for the lack of communication from the Manager.

207916,2015-10-11,1,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Absolutely one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in a long time!!!... Our reservation was at 6:30, hostess was very nice sat us, we were given a halloween drink menu and the wine list, and that's where the good service ended, 20 min later we still don't see a waiter, 30min later I'm guessing what was their sommelier came over and asked if we were interested in any bottles of wine, we had an event to go to so some ordered glasses and other cocktails. He tried to walk away because we weren't ordering bottles ( which we probably could have if they didn't waste our first 30min) but we pretty much made him take our orders... 30mim In!!!... Next a man left us oil and vinegar but never any bread... 45min in WE DONT EVEN HAVE FOOD MENUS and still have not seen/been introduced to a waiter... Almost an hour in a man walks up with menus and says "" here you go guys, I found you some menus"" and walks away!! At this point we are dying of laughter, we wish we could have left but with another event to go to we wouldn't have been able to have dinner at all (our reservation was at 6:30 and the event at 9, we figured a little over two hours would be enough time for dinner, the event was ten minutes away).... A full hour in and then guy who dropped off the menus comes backs and says "" so are we starting with any appetizers?"".... We planned to but now we have less then an hour so that's out of the question, as we ordered our entrees we made it very clear to him how disappointing his service and lack of urgency and attention was, he pretty much shrugged his shoulders at us, no apologies, nothing... We finished ordering and still we don't know his name so we said ""hey! What do we do with this oil and vinegar?"" His reply "" you should have bread""... Someone else brought cold hard bread out.... All the entrees came out together, the small portions were annoying only because we planned to order appetizers but couldn't because of the service...food was okay, one person ordered the filet mignon medium rare, it came out medium to medium well ( but again we can't send it back because they put us in a time crunch so he either he had to eat that or not eat at all).... Dessert time? No... They bring out two birthday desserts ( yes we were celebrating two birthdays in all of this mess) they had a halloween theme to them... He set them down and walked away....ten minutes after they finished those he asked if we wanted dessert menus, we are all just baffled at how unorganized and unprofessional this waiter is....We said we don't have time for desserts ( although again we would have all loved some) and asked for the check, he set down all the checks took payment and said ""have a nice night to the table"".... No apologies, no acknowledgment, no accountability, no nothing, and do they not have a manager, or anyone to check on tables otherwise? What the check did have on it was his name, Erik... So thank you Erik for your lack of professionalism!

278837,2012-01-29,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I can't beleive I am reading reviews of this place that are anything other than ""this place is horrible"".  Are you kidding me, am I on one of those gag shows.  Only a person who has never been out to eat in public could have enjoyed this food.  Everything, and I mean every single item brought to the table, was purchased pre-made, frozen, deep fried or baked, then put on a plate. It all tasted like it came from the supermarket.
The crab cakes had no crab, just mush, we had to send back.  I am from Maryland, so I usually lower the bar when it comes to crab cakes when ordering them out, but this was the stuff you buy at safeway and fry up.  I rarely ever send soemthing back, but i had to.

The next freezer to fryer to plate dish was fired cheese.  The sauce was stragiht from a jar, the cheese greasy and tasteless.  If you ate a cheap buffet in pahrump and thehy had this included, this is what it would taste like.  I swear it loked the same the next day co ming out as it did going in the night before.

Next up, the fabulous contadina frozen ravioli with straight out of the jar sauce.  No flavor at all. eating it was a chore, but by now I was hungry as the prior pre cooked slop was uneatable, so I managed to get three down.

Final worrd, if anyone likes this bar food, you have never eaten at any restaruant with a real chef.  IF i read one more reveiw how ""mama loved it"", i will track you down, force you to go to Piero's or Bouchon and make you try real food.",Z3dXS_3_2nogMhT_MeUMeQ,0,0,1,b0p4M-LUjnNbMoK4THzksw
283340,2012-10-14,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"This review of Panevino Deli Cafe (PDC), just off Sunset across from the airport, is based on at least twenty visits over the past year. The deli, which opened about 10 years ago, promotes itself as an upscale gourmet Italian deli with upscale prices to match. It's geared more to locals and business persons than tourists though I have seen tour buses at the restaurant before. Whereas the attached Panevino Restaurant has a great view of the airport and the Strip, the deli generally looks to the south and southwest out over the parking lot and adjoining commercial/business district (though the view over the restaurant's courtyard is nice). Panevino also offers private banquet facilities. My Yelp review is only for the deli which is open from 11:00AM to 5:00PM, Monday through Friday except holidays.

The deli space is fairly large and clean and has the look of a modern deli with its large glass windows, wood paneling and Italian-esque decorations. The staff is friendly and efficient. The lunch menu offers full- or half-portion Italian salads, fairly large sandwiches and hot main dishes. The deli also offers a selection of various Italian side salads, 3 different soups and quite a selection of pastries, cookies, gelato and sorbetti. The eating area offers 20 or more tables indoors and 4 or so outdoors (mostly for smokers). You place your order and pay the tab at the cash register and wait for your number to be called. Some days they are crowded at lunchtime but the order usually comes out in 5 - 10 minutes. Sandwiches are served in baskets with either a bag of chips or a small portion of average tasting coleslaw or another salad (in a small plastic container -- probably 2-3 ounces or so) while main dishes are served on clean white plates; both on a large fancy plastic tray. You pick up your own utensils, napkin, condiments and fountain drink. They also offer several different Italian sodas, flavored waters and other beverages.

Mostly when I eat at PDC I order a sandwich, chips and a soft drink. The overall quality of the meals I've been served is somewhat variable. I usually like the meatball sub with its three large warm meatballs, melted provolone cheese, tangy tomato sauce and sprinkled on Parmesan cheese served on a fairly large and crusty Italian roll but sometimes it is prepared with a different bread, cool meatballs and a sauce that is just not quite right. I've also had the French Dip (OK, sometimes fatty), the Reuben (greasy), Big Turkey (eh), and Grilled Chicken Club (OK) sandwiches as well as a few of their hot meals including Meat Lasagna (not like mom's -- her's is sublime) and Chicken Parmigiana (OK I guess). A lunch sandwich with chips and a small soft drink usually sets me back about $12.

PDC is a place I love to hate. It's convenient to my work. It offers a clean and attractive eating area as well as a friendly staff. My biggest disappointment is with the ""meats"" they put into the sandwiches -- they're just not what I'd expect from a gourmet deli. They don't seem to make these ""from scratch"" in their kitchen. It does not have the gourmet mouth-feel or taste to match the upscale prices. Is it really easier to serve processed turkey roll than it is sliced roasted turkey? What about the meatballs, the corned beef and the others? To me the deli-""meat"" is obviously the reformed ""roll"" stuff that many restaurants like to use these days. Perhaps it is a ""sign of the times"" that restaurants sometimes use these industrial substitutes to lower costs or offer more choices; but for me, it just makes the food seem cheap and overpriced.

By the way, they now offer a customer loyalty card -- buy 9 lunches and get the 10th free. Warning: only one stamp per party (rather than per person or meal ordered).

-- 4.0 deserved stars for the beautiful deli and 3.0 disappointing stars for the deli food",4X42EKnSLFofO0WgEINbBQ,0,0,3,krEbnkjH_0HVhP9jtTPhNQ

Let me tell you I was let down from the service to the food. The dishes were bland and uneventful. Every one seemed to have the same plain red sauce on various dishes. The sauce tasted as if it came out of a jar. The service was slow, our waiter forgot cocktails and did not explain specials to us. He did not offer cracked pepper for our salads and I had to ask the busser for it. I would expect this caliber of service at IHOP or Fridays, not a fine dining restaurant. I had family in town and they were disappointed as well. In fact nobody at our table enjoyed dinner. We brought this up to the manager who did offer us free food which we declined because by now we were ready to leave. They did not take anything off of our bill. We had a plethora of food left over at the end that we were going to take home to the dogs but decided just to throw in the garbage.

449114,2011-03-17,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"The service, ambiance and view of the strip are incredible at this place. We had reservations at 7:30 and showed up earlier than planned but the staff was more than happy to accommodate us at a table. I was surprised it wasn't busy during the typical dinner rush instead people trickled in around 8:30 pm on a weekday. 

As i do with all my reviews, I try to sample a little bit of everything on the menu so I can to give a fair review. Honestly their bruschettone is phenomenal. So much flavor on a piece of toasted ciabatta bread that includes mozzarella, eggplant, tomatoes and basil. Of course complimentary bread with olive oil and vinegar is always a good thing. 

We ordered a couple dishes: Chicken & Asparagus Risotto and Spinach Ravioli. Both dishes were flavorful but my risotto was pretty dang good. As full as I was getting I kept trudging along in hopes of finishing it, alas I failed! By the time we were done with dinner there was no room for dessert! 

The meal went perfectly with a glass wine but as others mentioned, not much of a selection when buying by the glass vs the bottle or half bottle. They did try pitching the half bottle but we settled for wine by the glass. 

Overall it's a great place to experience off the Strip - same quality, same price but less chaotic. The service is wonderful and the ambiance is relaxing as you watch planes coming in for a landing or taking off. I highly recommend this place if looking for a romantic setting that's not crowded and not as loud as other restaurants.

501677,2014-05-29,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"First timers, dined here for my husband's birthday on Tuesday night. We have been in Vegas for 10+ years and still had never tried this place. I had high expectations going in... and was VERY impressed. It was SUCH an enjoyable experience! 

Sommelier was great, and the wine menu has a nice selection. Erik, our server, was absolutely fantastic. Friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations. As the sun went down and the lighting at our table became bothersome to me, he went out of his way to move the three of us to a more comfortable table (with three people, multiple courses, and multiple bottles of wine, this is quite inconvenient for the staff). MUCH appreciated.

The food was amazing! My favorites were the Braised Short Ribs (incredible flavor, perfectly cooked meat. Bonus - delicious bleu cheese mashed potatoes with that as well), and the Four Cheese Ravioli (we actually enjoyed this as a second appetizer course for the table to share. Fresh yummy pasta, fabulous vodka sauce). 

Loved the atmosphere. Trendy, romantic, and cool vibe, but not overpowering and ""club-like"" (as some Vegas restaurants can be). Would love to have cocktails in the beautiful bar area next time as well... will definitely be back! A+!",SDxIW29SKMPogFficNhIzg,2,2,5,sxd6wU8TakCAzHcy_snovg

542946,2011-11-13,1,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Not really sure why this restaurant doesn't get more praise on the Food boards, but we had a great time here.  It was my wife's Birthday and we decided to celebrate here......and boy am I glad we did.  The staff was very friendly, nice, and accommodating (had to push back our reservations 1 hour).  The view at night is spectacular.  Being that it's just a few minutes south of the strip, you don't get that hustle and bustle feel to it, but you're still close enough to see the Vegas lights.  Very nice.  

We started with the Fritto Misto.  The calamari was cooked perfectly and was very tender.  The texture was very light and crispy and not oily at all.  I also liked the shrimp was came along with it too.  The Tomato sauce was very flavorful and not too spicy....just right.  

For our entrees, my son tried the Pollo Alla Brace and loved it.  He's NOT  a foodie and for him to make mention of any meal, it has to be good.  My wife tried the 4 Cheese Ravioli with Italian Sausage and the Vodka sauce.   She really enjoyed her meal as well, and her only gripe was that the portion was a bit on the small side..lol.  For my entree, I had to get the Cioppino.  This is my go to entree whenever it is on the menu and Panevino did not disappoint.  It was sooooo good, perhaps one of the best I've had.  Lot's of seafood and all perfectly cooked.  Half a Lobster, clams, scallops, and tons of fish.  The broth was slightly thicker than I've seen before but was piping hot and loaded with flavor.  The grilled Garlic crouton was perfect for soaking up the soup base.  I couldn't finish the entire thing, but thoroughly enjoyed it.

The service is impeccable... The staff pays attention, but they don't hover. They're always very friendly but not overly familiar. 

We both started with salads. I had the Spinach Nani, which might be the best salad ever created. My date had the Pear and Gorgonzola salad, which was outstanding as well. For entrees, I had the Tagliatelle with Lamb Ragu. Handmade pasta tossed with a light, tomato-y lamb sauce.... so perfect. My date ordered the Risotto with Chicken and Asparagus. The rice was perfectly cooked, the chicken moist and tender, the sauce - perfect. For dessert, we shared a cannoli, and while it wasn't my favorite dessert, it was still pretty decent.

I love everything about the restaurant. The design and ambiance is modern and comfortable, and it's never felt stuffy to me. It's a great date restaurant, and is, according to my date, impressive.

I've been to Panevino at least a dozen times over the last 5 or 6 years. It's one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and I've never been disappointed.",HGINFgk9adbHHE6AfnhpwA,3,2,5,KtIfESnOsS2y4pIvpOXxeQ
561739,2009-10-18,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I'm in Vegas for work for about 3 weeks every year. The worksite is about a mile away and there are not a lot of food choices in the area. One of the 'locals' recommended PaneVino and for about 4 years now, this is my favorite lunch spot in Vegas. 

The food is fresh and appealingly displayed, and the service is fast (a definite criteria for lunch). Plus it is not a chain restaurant. I prefer the deli (for speed of service) but I have eaten in the restaurant and the food is good also. This review is for the deli. 

The menu consists of sandwiches, soups, salads, pizza, and hot 'cafeteria' items. You order at the counter, pay, take a seat, and they bring the food to you in very nice wooden trays. You can pretty much preview the hot items, which are mostly Italian dishes, and the salads in the 'cold' case. Between me and my coworkers, we've tried most of the items and I can't remember any complaints. My favorite is the seafood salad ($9). This is loaded with jumbo shrimp, calamari, octopus, and mussels, all tossed in a light vinaigrette. The serving is very generous, with some greens (I always ask for a tad more greens which they always happily accommodate) and a couple of slices of excellent Italian bread. 

They make homemade gelato and sorbets and at $1.25 a scoop, you can't go wrong. 

But the absolute BEST thing they sell are Pignoli - Italian pine nut cookies. I've brought them home and my sister-in-law, who is Italian, gives them the thumbs up. Definitely have these.",ZBKKZeltFfzFM8_-M9sN9g,1,0,4,VLbEL4ksQVE_VYbGyePF-w
565622,2012-04-01,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Truly, an unacceptable experience.  I created a Yelp account just for this place...

I'm very surprised to see all the positive feedback, but am assuming that those who happily dined here were expending their bill to their company or something similar.
$$$ doesn't properly describe the cost of this place.  Try $23 for gnocchi and another $20 for sliced chicken on top of it.  How is this even possible?  Especially when the food tastes like leftover Chef Boyardee?

Oh, and they charge you for bread; that's always a blast at an Italian restaurant.  Moreover, it wasn't Italian bread, but rather some sort of mastodon pita.  There's nothing wrong with that if the bread was good, but it wasn't!  Honest to god, the prices are so unforgiving that restaurants on the strip still prove to be way cheaper.  Don't be tempted to come here unless your CEO has your bill covered...and even then, give him fair warning or he may just fire you for the cost of this incredibly lame food.",hD4Eazz3gMaAsJj8o7aKdQ,3,1,1,bbke0i1T9kscxSWmcsquQQ

Appetizers were awesome.  Calamari and Shrimp...fried to Golden Perfection.  Carpaccio just the way I like it, no capers.  Probably the moistest crab cakes I have ever put in my pie hole.  Also, my favorite salad in the whole wide world; Pears, Candied Walnuts and Gorgonzola Cheese mixed with Rocket (Baby Arugula) and dressed with a simple vinaigrette.

Entrees were superb!  Perfectly grilled Rib Eye served with little velvety clouds of gnocchi.  I honestly don't know how they grilled the steak so perfectly...my dining companion wanted it medium rare...and it was, but with the most savory and charcoal laden grill marks.  Four Cheese Ravioli was wonderful served dressed with a tomato cream sauce flecked with house-made italian sausage.  The Short Ribs were excellently prepared however, the Blue Cheese Mashed Potatoes were a bit over-powering in contract to the delicate succulence of the Short Ribs.

The service started out very attentive then waned as the meal was winding down.  The real shock was how the waiter plopped our PLASTIC doggie bag on the table as if to say...""here's your leftovers, now pay the bill so I can go home.""  Odd thing was, every other diner who had leftovers were given a branded Paper Bag and it was set either on a chair or beside one of the diners.  You'd think after shelling out $120/person not including tip our waiter would have been less cavalier in his wont for us to clear his table.

Normally, this would have resulted in a less than desirable tip however, since I plan to return here as it is only a few blocks from my house, I over-tipped.

700902,2017-11-11,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Well, at least there wasn't a cigarette butt in my salad. And, that's as kind as I can get with this place. I'd hoped to avoid the poor service and tourist-gouging prices of restaurants on the Strip, but found this place lacking in a number of key areas. For starters, we were kept waiting at our table for 10 minuets before our harried server arrived to greet us. Not even our water glasses has been filled (no busboys?). The lethargic service continued throughout the evening. 

At this point we'd had enough time to memorize the unimaginative menu and placed our wine and food orders.  I was surprised that the salads arrived well before the wine and that the wine server (ah, the busboy) appeared to have never used a corkscrew before and mangled the cork while struggling with his attempt to remove it. The WORST part, however, was that the $75 bottle of Chianti was served ice cold. When I called attention to this, our server was smart enough to send over the manager who explained they kept it this way because of the extreme temperatures in Las Vegas. That might fly in the summer, but I visited in mid-November and it was 66 degrees outside. To his credit he offers to decant the remaining few ounces of the bottle, but the damage was done and basically a potentially decent bottle of wine tasted like chilled Welch's Grape Juice. No other apologies were offered. 

I'll note that our pasta entrees were okay, but hardly worth $29 for lasagne. The total for wine, two salads and three pasta dishes was a whopping $225 (pre-tip). All I can say is that that money would have been better spent on a better meal and better service any one of this town's better restaurants.",2iUDEY60G3W1uirpfWTgRw,1,0,2,A9sucJQGN_ZcKSj0_2HNcQ
704527,2012-05-02,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I used to be a regular patron of the Deli -- getting the same, fantastic cobb salad 2-3 times per week. Yes, the salad was a little pricey, but the lemon vinagrette dressing was absolutely worth it -- and I would tell anyone that would listen to go to Panevino However, in the past few months, I've seen a major change that does not sit well with me as a regular customer: 

1) I always get extra dressing (which I pay extra for, understandably). For the to go order, it used to come in large plastic cups, but they reduced the size of the plastic cups by half. Now, to get the same amount of dressing I used to get, I'm paying double for the extra dressing. 

2) The base cost of the salad increased. So, along with my extra dressing that I now have to pay double for, I'm paying a full $2 more for the same salad, which was originally priced on the high side. I now pay around $12 vs. $10. The lemon vingrette is good, but it's not worth $12.

3) The salad used to come in a large plastic container. They have switched to a styrofoam container which seems smaller than the original plastic. Even if it's the same size, I hate using styrofoam simply for the environmental impact (and I'm far from an eco freak).

4) The quality has declined. I used to never have a problem getting the same great salad, but now, frequently, the tomatoes are mealy, the bread that comes with the salad is stale and the dressing is severly watered down.

I'm very disappointed with the decline of the Deli and I now only go when I absolutely have no other choice (I work in the area), which tends to be once every few months. I hope Panevino takes note, reverses the recent changes, then I will gladly return as a regular customer.",vWS4o3_NhHVlJ5g30Gw4Tg,0,0,2,afdrmLEwIBx5KKRV4j6xXA

While the menu is Italian, they recognize that sometimes vegans enjoy a night out and have a special menu for such persons.  The vegan options were introduced to the dining room over a year ago and I have made an effor to try all of the dishes.  On Friday I had the Barley & Mushroom Soup for an appetizer and followed it with the Roasted Vegetable Tortellini for an entree.  The soup was a perfect appetizer size and served hot.  It was a little salty which might be too intense for some people but I enjoyed it.  The homemade tortellinis were served with a fresh marinara sauce and asparagus spears.  It too was served hot and seasoned perfectly.  

My husband didn't see his favorite dish on the menu (Roasted Vegetable Pasta Primavera) but that wasn't a problem.  We asked the waiter if he could inquire about the chef making the dish for him.  It must have tasted great because there wasn't one noodle left on his plate.

1. Ambiance!  Beautiful architecture, picture windows, and fantastic views translates into a great dining experience.  Oddly romantic for being right next to the airport.

2.  Service!  Had a 20 + party and they took care of us nicely.  Not everything was plated at the same time, but, I understand.  Good for groups.

3.  Food to ingest!  They have two sides, the to-go and the dine-in. I've never been to the to-go but it appears to be lunch only.  The dine-in side is a bit pricey for the quality, I have to admit.  I tried the blackened shrimp with fettucini in a parmesean cream sauce (about $26).  It was, meh.  Not flavorful at all.  

However, I stole some of my neighbor's short ribs and blue cheese mashed potatoes  ($31) and it was heaven. ORDER THAT.  I heard someone else bitching about how gross the lemon chicken was so....DON'T ORDER THAT.

Last month was our anniversary. I called ahead during a weekday (just to make sure) and told them I was celebrating my anniversary w/ my wife. Neither of us are fish fans and she's a vegetarian so restaurants that can make minor changes to accomodate her diet move to the top of our list. We both had freshly made pasta dishes and they were excellent. 

...back to the story... At the end of our meal when we asked to see the desert menu, they brought out  a DELICIOUS desert (chocolate mussy kinda thing). It had ""Happy Anniversary"" written in chocolate syrup across  the plate and 2 forks for us to share. Yes, it was free.

Came on a Saturday night, around 9p. We were starving, btw, so at that point even the table looked appetizing. The place was totally DEAD! 9p...Saturday night...VEGAS!? Even for being a little late and off the strip, this is a huge sign that the place isn't doing well. 

Absolutely gorgeous ambiance. Greeted by a very sweet gentleman; he claimed to be the sommelier (but he was also playing host.. Hmm.. Another sign?) Sat at a very comfortable booth facing the large windows with a beautiful view. Reminded me of Top of the World at the Stratosphere (without the spinning).

The waiter came to greet us, told us about a few specials and that they were out of quite a few items. Together we ordered two Caesar salads, one cup of soup, the shrimp and scallop ravioli and two glasses of wine (Grand total, $103).

Salads came out freezing cold, we were not offered fresh ground pepper, had to ask TWICE, because the salads came out at different times. I've had a better Caesar in a plastic to-go container at an airport. Cheap, shitty lettuce and thick, super mayonnaise-y dressing. I was so unimpressed with the ravioli; it tasted like something you'd get at the Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. With a $30 price tag! Are they out of their damn minds?!

I recommend going somewhere else for dinner. There are SOOO many fantastic restaurants in Vegas, and if you're going to spend that much, you may as well enjoy it.",5VxUSNMXRYWPMPB0ely63g,2,0,2,zU-ibGjGVy60ET_5uDybiQ
959662,2016-04-23,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"The service was excellent, and our server was very attentive. The rest leaves a lot to be desired. The ambiance was dark, even mid-day, however it has a decent view of the airport. Still, the place felt like an old vestige of a restaurant that may have already seen its prime long ago. The food was not good, other than he artesian bread, which was definitely the highlight - but at $7 for a single piece - uh, no. The salads were passable, though I really didn't care for the overly sweetened house vinaigrette. My wife wasn't a big fan of the kale/legume salad, either. It was supposed to have some sweeter type of sesame-based dressing, but instead tasted bland. Then came the shrimp cocktail. The FIRST time they brought it out to us, the pieces of shrimp were covered in a mysterious pink creme sauce which we both passed on and sent back (Flag #1: Less-than-fresh ingredients are usually covered in something unnecessary). They were brought back out sans the pink creme. The cocktail sauce looked like a dark, jarred, thick ketchup-like mixture, and tasted sweet - similar to chili sauce sold in grocery stores that comes in a plain jar with a hint of horseradish added to invoke a similar flavor to that of actual cocktail sauce. The shrimp was obviously frozen and thawed using a boiling/steaming method and had lost any flavor resembling that of fresh shrimp by the time it was served. The shrimp had that taste of a slight hint of wet dog (a byproduct of it losing all its flavor in frozen storage....not unhealthy - just unsavory by any stretch), with the slightly rubbery consistency of a hard boiled egg white. I had ordered a linguini with clams and spicy red sauce. My wife ordered the vegan meatloaf. They brought me linguini with red sauce (no clams - a mistake that actually only brought me relief after having tried the shrimp). My entree was so saturated with butter I had to send it back as well. I got it back without any butter. The sauce was canned. $20 for the pasta - and it tasted like what they would serve at a really cheap buffet at best. My wife was impressed with the meatloaf, though she didn't care for the tomato sauce either. It seems like the vegan options show potential, however it was too little to save our overall unpleasant lunch experience.   Two appetizers, two ice teas, two salads, two entrees, one piece of artesian bread...$103 later and - rest assured - we will not be returning. We've spent less on the strip and had actual fresh seafood and real cocktail sauce (not jarred).

Great food, great wine list, great service.

We were in town for CES - so were 115k other people.  So going out to dinner is really really difficult.  Except if you know about this restaurant!  It's way off the strip, but has a view of the strip and airport.   There not a bad table in the entire place.  

We went there one night with clients around 9:30pm, the kitchen closes at 10pm during the week. Our clients were running late do to a miscommunication with a cab driver, Panevino's chef told us no problem, sit back and relex. He kept the kitchen open until our guest arrived and had a change to review the menu and order.  

We went there one more time before leaving LV with some of our vendors as a thank you - it was a weekday - we arrived at 8pm and left at 11:30pm. Remember, the restaurant closed at 10pm - but they never said a word to us about the time, nor did they hover around trying to get us to leave.

Why indeed. The view is beautiful and if you have lunch here, you will get to look out on the east potion of the Valley through huge floor to ceiling windows. 

FOOD: the food is very tasty here. They focus on Italian food and take the time to ensure the pasta, sauces, side dishes are cooked properly and seasoned well. They care about quality at Panevino. There are times I find the dishes to heavy (you know I'm talking to you short rib risotto), but it's better than solid. It's very good. 

The lunch menu caters to nearby businessmen but they are willing to make you something off of the dinner menu if you ask. 

VEGETARIANS MOUNT UP: Do those on a plant-based diet know about this place? Because they have one of the most interesting, delicious, and extensive vegetarian (and some vegan) menus I have seen at an upscale restaurant in this city. Why isn't this place crawling with veggie-focused foodies looking for options on the east side of town? 

SERVICE: I have to say, as a service-focused reviewer (yes, I just gave myself that pompous title), I have had some of the best service while eating at Panevino. I struggled with giving them five stars based on the service alone. And during the last visit, our server Choy, provided such personable, kind, attentive, and knowledgable service that I want to go back when she's working next time. We told Choy that we wanted to look at their banquet halls and she took us to the hall and showed us around. We got to meet some of the special events staff and I appreciated the professional and expert information and service they provided.  

If you've been in this town for over a month, you have experienced what passes for service in this town.  I love what Panevino is doing and that they seem to care about the customers who frequent the place. That quality sets them apart from so many places in Vegas. There is no gimmick here.

This is a beautiful place. Outstanding choice for an intimate date or dinner with close friends.
Warm rich colors, dim but golden lighting (very flattering), and sensual design elements make the subliminal case for a very good night, indeed.

Our Server, Erick, was absolutely top-notch. Very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly without ever being obtrusive. Charming as heck. He's the smart buddy that you want, giving you the inside scoop on the menu and the place overall. 

The food was good. ...and I mean solid good. But it wasn't surprising or overly special. There was never that moment of ""OMG, This is the best thing I ever put in my mouth"".

...except maybe the creme brulee. Not everyone loves it - but if you are a fan (as am I) this is *exactly* what it should be. Perfectly crisp caramelized sugar topping that cracks open to reveal a truly decadent Madagascar Vanilla Bean custard. Perfection.

Having lived most of my life on the East Coast - where Italian restaurants are as ubiquitous as Mexican food is here, I would say that this place holds it's own among the better Ristorantes. Nobody will be disappointed.

ALSO: Vegan Food. Vegan Food. Vegan Food.

Also Gluten-free and organic options. Lots of them - and not just hidden away here and there - but featured in their own ""Vegetable Based"" menu. Lots of interesting descriptions. I'll definitely return just for a vegan meal.

I found this place because I'm vegan and I saw that they offered a separate plant based menu. I had no idea that my experience would far out weigh my expectations. Visiting Vegas it isn't always easy to find good vegan fare. But Panevino hits on all cylinders. 

The Wynn has plenty of vegan options, but what it's missing is the passion behind it. That's where Vincenzo comes in, the general manager at Panevino. He is Italian from Italy, educated, hospitable, charming, and vegan for 8 years. That's where the passion at this restaurant comes from. 

He is the person behind the in depth, delicious plant based menu. Created by a vegan for vegans. Trust me there's a huge difference between a restaurant just service plant based food vs. someone who really cares about the difference it's making. That's Vincenzo. He said to us ""I want your experience to be like you're at home"" and he delivers on that promise 10 fold. Plus we enjoyed our conversation with Vincenzo as much as we enjoyed the food and service. 

Our server Michael was excellent. Very knowledgeable about the menu and recommendations.

saw this restaurant on a bunch of our client's expense reports and decided if it was good for them, it would be good enough for us too. came on a thursday afternoon, and the place was about 1/2 full. it is business casual, btw. and it seemed mostly like a place for power lunches and business deals. made me feel like i'm all grown up.

when we had been seated, a person in our party, who was dressed mostly in black, was asked if she preferred a black napkin. i've never heard that question in my life. didn't even know it was an option to take! 

first came the bread - tomato focaccia that was chewy and fluffy, and warm - best i've ever had, and some ciabatta, and some regular baguette. all with olive oil and balsamic. only bad thing - this was never refilled, and it should have been. we wanted more dipping oil!

i ordered the seafood linguine and it was divine! received a small plate for shells as well as a shellfish fork. however, the plate was brought ahead of time, and not with the entree, which made me wonder what it was for. it came with a delicately balanced tomato sauce and more seafood than noodles - which is awesome! scallops, clams, mussels and shrimp. all of which were fresh. not a fishy piece in sight. 

our water was constantly refilled, and the waitstaff was extremely attentive (except for the dipping oil). 

i am definitely coming back here next time i'm in vegas, even though it's off the strip! 

the prices were also decent! i think my pasta was $22? worth it!

The order that I am describing here is not importance, but the sequence of arriving thru leaving.
First, the place is nice, good view, location of the table was amazing, but (Vegas) there is a huge billboard with the name of the restaurant that just in the middle of the view. Who do they want to advertise, to people inside the airplane?? 
Second, the service (Michael) ... Nice guy. Ok service.
Third, wine list. Simple, nothing extra ordinary. With a wine cellar so big they could make a more variety. The waiter did not bring the wine for the taste. Just brought the glass full and that was it.
Fourth, the food. Most important, but ... I order ossobuco with pasta. My wife order risotto with shrimp and scallops. 
The ossobuco had a sauce, it was cold, the meat was warm, the pasta was horrible. Did not have any flavor and you could see the lack of care that was in the plate.
Her risotto was warm, not hot, the scallops were ok and shrimp was tough to chew. The seasoning was way to hot for a risotto. Almost a risoto mexicano.
No chef, nor the su chef were there. Just cooks.
After they noticed that I did not eat they tryed to serve me something else, but the meat was going to be cold or colder and I would eat by myself. Ended up eat just the meat. The manager (I think) came to see what was happening, but I told me I did not wanted anything that I would eat the meat and finished.
The check ... In full almost 100 dollars. Paid. There is one place that really need all the money they can get. First and last time they saw mine. O well one more experience to tell you!!",_wcaBqOXJ0pK9wGs3jbd6g,3,0,2,g3sczd5mgodKmLPmWvnZKw

The service was also spectacular especially from the GM of the restaurant. We were given a very special and genuine dining experience especially since we are Vegans.

1595656,2012-06-13,2,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I've been here several times and one of the things I love about Panevinos is the panoramic view of the strip without having to be actually ON the strip.  The restaurant, located directly South of the airport offers floor to ceiling windows that give great views of both the Strip and all those travelers coming to Vegas with high hopes of becoming Americas next millionaire, then leaving with their tail between their legs.

The restaurant itself is quite large with the dining area to the right and the bar / lounge to the left.  The lounge is a good place to catch happy hour as it is quite spacious with plenty of stools at the bar and plenty of booths and tables around the lounge itself.  This used to be open to the dining room, separated only by a low dividing partition but I have heard that it is now fully enclosed.

My favorite thing on their menu is their short ribs.  I realize that doesn't sound very Italian however if you decide to come here, I would highly suggest them.  The ribs are served in a red wine reduction sauce and presented over mash potatoes that are whipped with blue cheese.  The sweetness of the wine and the saltiness of the blue cheese are an excellent combination paired with the tenderness of the ribs.  The ribs are very tender and a knife is not required.  If the potatoes aren't your thing, you can always substitute pasta.  IMO, I wouldn't change anything about this dish.

If you're looking to stay a little more to the traditional Italian, the penne vodka is always a good bet.  Their vodka sauce is one of the best that I've had.  Rich and creamy, coats the pasta extremely well, yet leaving you wanting more.

A full bar and a very good wine selection is served as.  The wait staff is knowledgeable on the wines that are served and will offer their suggestions when asked.

One of the draws to Panevinos is their service.  Each and every time the service has been well above par.  From the way one is greeted by the hostesses to the those who are clearing your table, the service is extremely friendly, helpful and friendly.  From the time you sit down to the time you finish your meal, you get the feeling as though you're the only one dining at that time because the service makes you feel special as you walk through the door.

Parking here is a breeze.  Since it is located off the strip and in the front of a business complex, there is plenty of parking available during the evening.

My only knock on Panevino is their pricing.  The beef and fish are priced for what you'd typically expect however their pasta dishes are on the high side.  Portions are decent.....but still a little on the steep side as far as pricing structure goes.

This is definitely a good place to meet for dinner to conduct some business, socialize or to just take in the views and enjoy your time away from The Strip.  One of my Vegas favorites.",PWR1pzxJysOQsc3eG7SkDg,11,9,4,H3jr91PU0juQBGRVlU_PXw
1638838,2016-06-06,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Panevino is the restaurant that you never knew you were looking for. I've passed Panevino and at one point worked around the corner for years and have always said one day I'm going to try this place. Well that one day finally came, and it was well worth the wait. My lady told me to pick any restaurant to dine at for my Birthday, and though a more popular strip restaurant came to mind I went with Panevino. First let me say Panevino exceeded our expectations. This place is amazing! I personally feel finding a great place to dine that has great food, environment and customer is extremely rare in Las Vegas and Panevino has perfected all areas. Upon entering Panevino the first thing you'll notice is how clean, fresh, casual, laid back and classy the dining area is. To the west of the building there is also a bar and lounge. At around 6 o'clock in the evening they raise the curtains to reveal an extraordinary view of the Las Vegas Strip and McCarran Airport. Customer service is just ridiculously awesome. Everyone you interact with is extremely pleasant and welcoming, it feels like you've been there before and they really missed you. The food is exceptional! We started off with wine, bread and an olive oil with balsamic vinegar mix. The bread was fresh, the olive oil had a rich nutty flavor and I know this sounds crazy but even the water tasted refreshing, not like the typical funny tasting tap water you get at lesser quality restaurants. I love Riesling wine but it is very hard to find in restaurants and if they do have it its not very good. We next ordered Crab Cakes for our appetizer which were crispy Maryland-style crab cakes with honey-mustard dressing, and though $20 for two crab cakes the size of silver dollars may seem expensive, you will definitely want to order more. That $20 will seem like a few pennies for the best crab cakes ever! After being amazed by our appetizer we were extremely excited about our main course meals. My lady ordered the Rigatoni Blackened Chicken which consisted of rigatoni with blackened chicken breast, saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and roasted bell peppers in a spicy tomato sauce. Her dish tasted fresh and authentic. I ordered the Assorted Grilled Fish which consisted of grilled lobster, salmon, shrimp, scallops, tuna and Chilean sea bass on a bed of saut√©ed spinach and roasted potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce. I experienced a sense of euphoria with this dish lol. All jokes aside, if you close eyes while eating this meal you will feel like you're dining along the ocean side in Southern California. Rarely do we ever order desert because nine times out of ten we get some type of generic brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream, but not at Panevino! We ordered the Panevino Trio which was a tasting trio of cr√®me br√ªl√©e, tiramis√π, and lemon pastry cream Napoleon. Only thing I can say about the desert is try not to lick the plate, it might be frowned upon in this type of establishment. This year my dinner experience was the highlight of my birthday and there is no need for my lady to ask me where I want to dine next year... I'm going to PANEVINO!",m6UN-OZB_6R3Q52yw9loYQ,0,0,5,R2YK15Len45iPkzyT7SycQ
1641186,2017-03-05,7,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"When it comes to Italian dining, I'm usually cursed with strange happenings.  Well the curse strikes again.  We walked in with reservations so getting seated quickly wasn't an issue.  When the hostess asked if we wanted a table to booth, I said booth and we were sat at a table.  Ok.  No big deal.  I assume maybe she didn't hear me.  Then after our water was poured she asked if we could move to a booth since a 'regular' was coming in and wanted that table.  Again, no big deal since we wanted a booth to begin with.  We were there for a while and no one sat at the table we were moved from.  I think these things only happen to me.  Moving on...

I had ordered the Chicken and Asparagus Risotto.  I love risotto.  Their dinner portion is quite small comparatively.  I think they could have made this a bit more flavorful as well but it was ok.   My husband ordered the Lasagna  Bolognese.  It was delicious and put my meal to shame.  The flavor from the Italian Sausage was bursting.  I only had one bite but would be sure to order that next time.  

We had good and attentive service.  The dining area is dimly lit for dinner making a great ambiance.   Im hoping the curse will be broken for my next visit.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,7,6,3,vgVvx42-hHgpAJBI-1NIVQ
1645714,2015-01-21,8,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I was initially impressed by the spread of salads in the deli case as we walked in. Variety and freshness were on point, and pricing for a pick-three salad sampler was reasonable: $8 plus upcharges for salads with meat, makes sense.

But the portions were small, and a pile of shredded lettuce was hidden under my scoops falsely making them look like more. They were very fresh, but lacking flavor: orzo salad could use feta or something else to perk it up, quinoa was the favorite but a little plain, cucumber-tomato salad had no seasoning whatsoever, and the cherry tomato caprese scoop I got had a scant five pieces of mozzarella.

BF paid $10 for a corned beef sandwich: thick bread and meat, plain and boring, but would have been fine if the meat was good. Unfortunately it was dry as hell. For the prices and image they're setting, you'd think they'd have a good quality mustard to dress it up, right? Nope, just packets of generic-brand yellow. We tossed the other half, unable to choke through the dryness any more.

Dining room layout and decor are oddly reminiscent of a hotel breakfast bar, before you even consider the disappointing food. Staff is friendly enough. Salads are okay. But nothing here is worth the prices they're asking- and I personally steered clear of the Italian offerings they had, as they were served cafeteria-style.

I'm not a fan of overpaying for food, but have no regrets if the food is worth the price. The food is not worth the price at Panevino.

Small portions of tasteless food can fetch $20-30 a plate, which in my opinion is too much. The best part of the meal were the salads, but at over $10 a piece, were hardly worth it. I tried two different pasta dishes, each one underwhelming. The lemon chicken was dry and required a healthy dose of salt and pepper.

If you are looking for a beautiful restaurant and care little about how much the food costs tastes, this is the place for you. Otherwise, you can find comparable food at your local Olive Garden.",NC7BnFILf671F7-VeZ_q5w,2,1,2,pXPx7KOZc2GAFuCPUgcJZQ
1746103,2010-03-27,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  It is great for a romantic dinner or a business lunch or dinner.  It is near the offices of a lot of the slot machine manufacturers, so it is a popular business haunt of gaming industry executives.  It has a great open lounge area with comfy couches and a fireplace for a great ambiance.  Others have adequately described the great views, so I won't go into that. 

Several reviews have questioned the service but I have always found it to be outstanding.  Santino is usually the Maitre D' in the evening and is gracious and sincere.  The wait staff is very professional and helpful and Robb the Wine Sommelier is outstanding (try the Dutton Goldfield Pinot Noir -- a great value at about $68).

But the star is the food.  My favorite dish is the Grigliata di Pesce - a huge mound of seafood on a moist and flavorful bed of diced potatoes and sauteed spinach.  It includes a Grilled Maine Lobster, Salmon, Shrimp, Scallops, Tuna and Chilean Sea Bass.  It is a huge amount of food and I have no idea how they do it for $38.  I have never finished it.  My second choice is the Sea Bass, that comes with very nicely prepared grilled veggies and has a subtle wine sauce that allows the fish to be the center of attention.  Very nice!

There are a lot of other great Italian dishes that are outstanding.  Mostly, I have tasted them off other people's plates because I am so impressed with the fish here.  I have had the Porcini Mushroom Risotto and it was incredible.  Another great thing about this place is that they will make off-menu items.  If you have a craving for pretty much any traditional Italian dish, they can make it.  Chicken Marsala, Chicken Parmesan -- no problem.  They will also serve a fantastic desert of fresh berries drizzled in Gran Marineri with powdered sugar and whipped cream.  Excellent!",l-1O0xAIVQZhIp_B5X9cTw,1,0,5,3BKM2py-vTmgwROZ_u1EEg

For me it's a special occasion kind of resto because you will pay a pretty penny but let me reassure you, they won't let you down. 

It's a bit off the beaten path, when you start to see airplanes you know you're getting close. I wasn't expecting a view with my meal but the beautiful architecture throughout was definitely intended to draw your attention toward the amazing views of the strip. No wonder it made the Best of Las Vegas list for Restaurants With a View. 

Among my favorite dishes were the cioppino and ravioli. As for the drinks, Lights Out (appropriately named) caught my attention because it was the first time I've seen everclear on any drink menu before. That brings me back. 

The ambiance sets the mood for a lovely night out with your loved one. Dim lighting and modern decor gives such a welcoming and romantic feel. This resto has some of the best service I have ever experienced, IMO anyway. This is a huge part of why it stands out to me. Right down to cleaning the crumbs off your table & always making the right suggestions for your meal.

A recent visit started with a Margherita pizza for an app. It was outstanding with just the right touch of ingredients and flavor that mad e it just right. The main course was a homemade Capellini al Pomodoro, Angel Hair pasta with Pear Tomatoes, Basil, Garlic and Extra-Virgin Olive Oil. My mother could not make this better. It is the simplest of pasta, but Panevino made it in such a way that the flavors just came bursting through. 

This has been my experience almost every time I come here, and I have been here about a half-dozen times. The flavors are just delightful. 

The service was very good. It was very light when we were there, but the traffic picked up by the time we left that the place was almost full. I get the impression that the place is a local hangout. People seem to know each other. That's good, because, again, the big reason I like this place is the lack of convention and tourist traffic. 

I see many fellow Yelpers have had trouble with the service. I can say I have never experienced that. It has always been spot on and I have been here when it's been quiet and when absolutely packed. 

As has been my custom in Vegas recently, I asked if the bar had a blender. It did! And, thought, Brandy Alexanders were not on the bar list, they whipped one up for me. A little too thin, but tasty. That makes Panevino a great place in my book!

I had been to the restaurant side previously, but this was my first time to the deli side.  VERY different than the restaurant, which exudes ambiance with fine dining and a great view, plus the homemade italian taste.  The deli side is cafeteria crossed with restaurant - so very casual and (sadly) no view.  Definitely a great spot for lunch.  Seems to be great for business workers!  

LOTS of menu options - and while I am not a vegan, I noticed they have a large selection for those who are.  

They have a large selection of salads, sandwiches and hot items.  We tried the seafood salad (my boyfriend had this before and likes it), and I had the cobb salad.  My complaint with these would be the portions.  I would expect a lot more ""salad"" for the price.  However it was fresh and tasty!  Avocado for the cobb was slightly too ripe for my liking (more mushy than I would suggest for a salad, maybe okay as a spreadable for a sandwich).  

Sitting near the hot food while eating made us desire a piece of the meat lasagna too.  The sauce was delicious, loads of meat, noodles were fresh.  It came with a side of potatoes that were slightly crispy, and a very good accompaniment.  

All in all it was a wonderful lunch experience!  I would definitely go back, probably ordering a sandwich or hot food instead of the salad in the future.  

I noticed they have wi-fi too, for those business workers who need to eat through lunch... and desserts for those with a sweet tooth!",U6Bi44pwgiIt-IEK2GhiGQ,0,0,4,wf4WKeuOB0NIHcVD7HJYNA

We were met by a delightful Maitre d' who looked after us all night, while we were dinning.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing nice plush booths and a view of the Las Vegas Strip. The service staff was outstanding and was willing to help at anytime.

We both started off with cocktails my husband ordered a Martini garnished with olives stuffed with blue cheese.  I order an old cocktail and I was delighted to hear the bartender could make me a ""Tom Collins"" served in tall glass. I was told Panevino Restaurant make their own sour mix. The best ""Tom Collins"" I have had in years!  We ordered the bread that is served raised with Balsamic Vinegar. It is definitely an experience to taste this delicious thin bread ballooned up and dipping it in Balsamic Vinegar.

My husband ordered the Penne Alla Vodka Con Crema DI Pomodoro Fresco (Penne with creamy vodka-Tomato sauce and Parmigiano cheese) he was delighted with his selection.  I ordered the Pollo Alla Brace (Grilled chicken breast-marinated in Extra- Virgin olive oil, mustard, garlic, crushed red pepper and rosemary on a bed of roasted Potatoes drizzled with Lemon Sauce). The chicken was delicious and prepared perfectly.

2149650,2016-01-08,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"We had the very good fortune to be able to get in at Panevino last night, despite the fact that the city is currently swamped with all the other CES attendees looking for good food in the evenings!

Panevino is out near the airport end of the strip (south), only about 10-15 minutes from Fashion Show mall area even in heavy traffic.  Beautiful building, gorgeous intimate setting inside with a bar and lounge area with couches in addition to the restaurant area.

After we ordered our wine (2008 James Gang Zin, Paso Robles - absolutely fabulous!) we ordered the Warm Artisan bread and the Calamari & Shrimp Antonio appetizer (crispy calamari and shrimp with a side of spicy fresh tomato sauce).  Both good starts, the bread was especially interesting and outstanding - it was a huge, inflated flatbread, about the diameter of the plate the brought it on. When you poke it, it deflates & resembles a large, round pita, only it tastes much, much better - salty, yeasty goodness even if you forego the oil & vinegar dip they make for you at the table.  I will add that because we ordered the Artisan bread (which only lasted moments between 3 people), we were less full of bread than usual (is this a good thing or a bad thing?), but we were passed over for the complimentary bread basket I later noticed surrounding diners had, which I assume was complimentary (versus the $8 Artisan bread) and which I would like to have been offered nonetheless.

I started with the Pear & Gorgonzola salad: diced pears, arugula, caramelized walnuts, Gorgonzola, Belgian endive and radicchio in a lemon dressing - it was OUTSTANDING.  My compatriots both had the Caeser salad (hearts of romaine in a classic Caesar dressing, shaved parmesan cheese and homemade focaccia croutons) and both enjoyed.

I was in a vegetarian mood after all the meat we've had this week, so for my entree I chose the Agnolotti Ricotta & Spinach - homemade half-moon ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach in a creamy Parmesan sauce.  It was nothing short of divine, and I could not have enjoyed anything more. It was exactly what pasta should be, total comfort food that assures you everything is right with the world on the first bite.

My husband had the Linguini Seafood (linguini with shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine and a touch of lightly spicy tomato sauce) - I tasted it & it was very good if you prefer a tomato sauce over a wine or cream-based sauce.

Our dinner companion had the one of the off-menu specials: lobster ravioli in a vodka cream sauce, and he said it was fabulous (judging by the look of it, I'd agree!)

For dessert, we had the Panevino Trio because I thought it would be a good representation of their best desserts (the waiter agreed): it included a
tasting trio of cr√®me br√ªl√©e, tiramis√π, and lemon pastry cream Napoleon, all of which were to DIE for. All were perfectly executed, and a bite of each was just the right amount of dolce to end what was a very satisfying meal.

We've been here 10 days so far on this trip, and this was absolutely our best meal yet (and possibly our best meal in Vegas ever). Everything was perfect from the moment we walked in the door: friendly hostess, kind and efficient server who knew just when to show up and when to lay low, stellar cuisine, beautiful ambiance. And just like that, Panevino rose to the top of my list for MUST EATS while in Vegas.",CvWJ_4HnsMQvQEeyZ6S5iA,4,1,5,1rRM5bV587LMOWmRdJu8RA

What a great place to grab a few comfortable chairs and relax with friends or just the two of us. Wait for it... SOMEONE (that better be fired by now) put up a HUGE, ugly, stupid, interior wall in the bar/lounge area and blocked the view! WTF? 

Let me get my head around this: You own a place with one of the best views IN THE WORLD, literally THE WORLD and you put up an interior wall to block it? Think about this, you can only have this view if you are off of the strip AND there is nothing between you and the lights of Las Vegas Blvd. Panevino is the ONLY place on the ground floor with a view like that. 

Maybe they don't care about the bar costumers and only the dinners, who knows? I do hope someone got fired for this stupid idea. We will have to settle for PTs down the road. 

The food might be great and we may try it some day, but one of our regular haunts is dead to us as a cool, classy lounge.  We joke when we drive by Panevino: ""wanna stop in a look at the wall?.. Nah"".",aZ2DKwGjjTfrGn4AOSI34w,5,1,2,gyGpa83haP0TAZ12IFc-YQ

This a treat in itself for a delicious fresh well prepared gourmet meal. For under $10 I enjoyed a divine eggplant parmesan and mixed green salad with what tasted like a homemade balsamic vinaigrette dressing. They have a daily rotating lunch special and a variety of gorgeous fresh salads all displayed in the deli case. The service is counter service and you leave your plates at the tables to be bussed. The line is usually long (a sign of good food indeed) however the counter servers roll through it with ease and charm your wait is never more than 5 minutes..

I guess they take the ""Panevino"" label quite literally, and you must order food AND wine. If you don't want wine, the waitstaff will scoff at you and mock you for being cheap. That's right: the waitstaff will judge you for what you order. I didn't realize that I had to get the most expensive dishes or whatever else they had in mind for me; I thought I could just order items that I wanted. I guess not.

The food was very good, and the atmosphere is nice, but the condescending waitstaff has no place treating customers with disrespect just because the customers aren't interested in drinking wine.

Though this place seemed to be a ""boys club"" with golfers and business professionals, all of that testosterone was washed away by the impeccable service and delicious food. 

Bruchetta was off the chain in terms of flavor, and the homemade spinach ravioli's were superb. I quality controlled my date's risotto and WOW! Fantastic! 

For an off-strip fine dining experience with splendid ambiance, remarkable views (if you like to watch planes land), and mouth watering eats, Panevino is your spot. Not exactly budget friendly but a great place to splurge on a swanky evening out without the chaos of the strip.",9ktB1WEZx6ytMsRxRIMiJg,3,2,5,oP3W45DkJ25J1WS0EIdMXw

The drink menus change for each season and the calamari is very tasty. The happy hour lasts from 4 to 7. The chicken skewers are excellent. I would come back to taste their large steaks or veal chops.

Thanks to the Panevino staff providing an excellent taste test. They know how to make you feel like number one. If there is an Italian dish that you would like, but don't see on the menu, ask them to make it. If they have the ingredients, they like a challenge of creating other classic dishes.",r5ggPC6OccLk6dDl5yqsJQ,3,0,5,Ddxq_W23Qit4kORzFihe8w

I give this place 3 1/2 stars for the simple fact that it's a healthy alternative and the amount of options they offer when I comes to salads and sandwiches. Some of the sandwiches are more plain than others but they will prepare anything pretty much how you like it. It tends to get busy during lunch hours but nothing crazy. Just know if you are on a time crunch at 12 to be back 1 you might have to wait a little so keep that in mind. I enjoy the pastrami sandwich and the French dip.

2411127,2016-07-02,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"What a hidden gem! Found just off the airport/strip, a place that will surely exceed your expectations. I came here on a Friday night with my girlfriend. 

Driving in, this place doesn't look like much. More of a oversized bar. Next to a bunch of business building and small business hotels. 

Once inside, the ambiance is immediately set. Dim lighting, very nice decor, an entire wall of two-story windows that show a clear and beautiful view of the strip! Very romantic setup. I love the music as well, a mix between chill edm, future classic, and deep house. Didn't see that coming, but it fits perfectly.

Service was great. They were very attentive and on top of everything. 

It definitely was slow for a weekend. However, this place is only known by locals or when they have conventions in town. So they usually are busy on odd nights. But, it felt like we had the whole restaurant to ourselves, which I'm ok with.

Food here is amazing!

We ordered:

Fried Calamari - Bomb!

Eggplant and Mozzarella Bruschetta - Amazing!!

Scallops - Cooked perfectly

Lobster Ravioli - Bomb!

Short Rib pappardelle - Really good

Osso Bucco - Awesome!

2411445,2017-02-20,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Ok so first off I think it's quite weird that the bar/lounge area is not ""typically"" open before dinner..... Our reservation was at 5pm and we arrived maybe 10 minutes early, and the manager saw us outside and invited us in because it was raining. We sat at the bar and gambled and had a couple drinks. Why is it that a parties that arrived after us got sat before us???? Makes no sense. 
Our server was nice, talked a little bit. Informed us of the specials which I wish I would've got the lobster ravioli.....I had the osso bucco which was just ok...I've had much better elsewhere. The meat was dry but the risotto was good. My bf had the ribeye, he said it was ok. The cream of corn was not good. Too much butter and not enough heavy cream. Way more salty and hardly sweet. Lots of fat off the ribeye steak. Yes we know it's a fatty cut of beef but this piece had tons of fat. Almost just as much there was meat. He said this sure didn't seem like a 22ounce steak. The best part of our meal was the calamari and shrimp appetizer. Sad because it's just breaded and deep fried...
I didn't feel as if this experience was worth the $280 we spent for 2 people. 
At least the view was pleasant with a window view. The airport was much more nice to watch with all the clouds and rain. Glad we got to experience to place but I don't believe we will.

2466532,2009-02-23,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I went to Panevino last night with a friend, and I absolutely adored it.  

The decor and architecture of this place are lovely and interesting.  It's a very open layout, but my friend and I sat at a table on the window, and it was very intimate because of the way the tables are setup.  

We both ordered the tasting menu which is a GREAT deal.  $55 for an appetizer, salad or soup, entree, and dessert.  Considering that an entree alone runs you anywhere from $25 -$45, the tasting menu is a steal.  You do pay a few extra bucks if you want steak or osso buco, but I think it's still worth it.  

I started with the prosciutto e melone appetizer, which was actually the only semi-disappointment of the night.  It was two lengthwise slices of honeydew each with a strip of prosciutto on top.  It was simple, and could have been better presented.  Obviously it tasted great, though.  My friend got the carpaccio, and that was excellent.

I had the pear and gorgonzola salad, which was very nice and light.  My friend got the mozarella e prosciutto salad, which was simple, but looked great.

For the main course, I had the lamb porterhouse, and it was excellent.  It was served with grilled asparagus and a potato cake (which was not great).  The lamb itself was perfectly charred in olive oil and rosemary.  There was no sauce, but it didn't even need sauce.  An excellent dish, cooked perfectly.  My friend got the ribeye with the porcini mushroom sauce (from the filet mignon), and he said it was fantastic.

For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee.  It was very rich, and in fact, a bit creamier than usual (which is saying something, for creme brulee).   He got the tiramisu.  Both were full size desserts, and after everything else, it was almost impossible to eat dessert.  (We managed, though).

We started with glasses of prosecco, and moved on to a bottle of Dolcetto d'Alba ($48), and then limoncello with dessert.  All were excellent, and while the drinks here tend to be on the pricey side (especially for Vegas), the wine list was a good balance of budgets, and the limoncello was homemade.  Yum!

It was a wonderful experience, and we lingered all over dinner for almost 3 hours.  The service was great.  Our server was there just enough but not too much, and the sommelier was at our table twice to ask if we needed help choosing a wine.  Overall, the servers, bussers, and somms all worked really well as a team, and we were well taken care of.

I have heard the martini happy hour is fun, so I'll definitely go back for that sometime.  If you're looking for a fabulous meal, I highly recommend Panevino.",3MDLJVzOBurN0R5sl9WUPw,0,0,5,553fCohZAW9bysES_tpOtQ

2471112,2010-01-28,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"PanVino is two faced.  Fortunately, they're both delicious!  
PanVino's dichotomy delivers both gourmet dining inside the main restaurant and equally tasty lunch time treats at the attached Deli.

This review focuses on the main restaurant and dining area.  PanVino is snuggled comfortably outside the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip, right across form the airport on Sunset.  Expect top notch Italian fare and the feeling that the disembodied ghosts of the Rat Pack themselves may materialize to have drinks by the fireplace. 
 
SERVICE : 
To say it has ""Old Vegas"" feel sells the ambiance short. The personable experience and the attention paid to the guest isn't a gimmick.  The staff is warm, appreciative, and genuine.  You get the feeling that these people are glad you stopped in.  Expect a warm greeting, a handshake, expect to feel like you want a martini.  

AMBIANCE : 
PanVino has it.  In Spades.  The main dining areas are constructed of spotless tables flanked by comfortable leather booths. Awesome for a romantic one on one and equally capable of entertaining a large scale function.  The interior is well thought out with rockwork meeting up with supple leathers while ironwork twists over private dining. Windows facing the strip are canted at such a degree to give you pause.

FOOD:
Italian classics at the peak of their preparation.  
the Mushroom Risotto is unreal.  The Gnocci, on a whole different plane. The best Tiramis√∫ I have had. Period.",E_ajMGs3ncNs_Gq0hTKvUw,1,1,5,h4783Ki6Ti6zN59SFqHOKg

My next visit I might try that just to have a cookie or a piece of cake ;). The food was good and salad was fresh. Caesar dressing is always great tasting here. Will definitely be back again.

One of the nice things is the Deli Cafe items can be packed to go and they accept call in orders if you want to pick it up. 

Don't forget to have your stamp card stamped, 9 meals and the 10th is on them (up to $14 pre tax value).

We came here for their lunch sandwiches. I ordered a wonderful pastrami sandwich. It was quite large with plenty of meat and very filling. The pastrami was flavorful and the sandwich itself was juicy. Add chips and a drink and it was all under $10. 

They carry all kinds of other sandwiches, desserts, salads, and hot meals. We didn't get to see the dinner room, but they have a restaurant area as well. The parking lot is quite large so that should be no problem at all.

My girlfriend and I both had a glass of the house wine which was good, we aren't big wine drinkers but we enjoyed them with dinner. 

We first ordered the artisan bread which was a cool, a balloon-like tortilla with Olive oil and balsamic vinegar, not your traditional bread and butter but we liked it.

I got the seafood linguini which was a good, sweet and creamy sauce. All the shell fish was perfectly cooked. 

My girlfriend got the blackened shrimp fettuccini Alfredo. It was lightly dressed and very tasty. 

Last we got the assorted sorbet plate, which allowed us to choose 3 ice creams. All delicious. The manager even surprised us and comped us desert, which wasn't at all necessary but greatly appreciated.

We got to the restaurant right before the sun started to set. The restaurant has these huge windows overlooking the strip, you can see how beautiful the sky looks when it transitions to night. We had a nice booth, it was comfortable to just lay back and order our food and enjoy the view of the sky. The music playing made our experience that much more enjoyable. The tables were spread out to feel like you had just enough room from your neighbors and still felt intimate enough with the person you were with. I enjoyed the atmosphere tremendously. Plus the waiters weren't always on top of you.

Apart from our bread we received, we also ordered the calamari and shrimp appetizer. It was so good, it was so fresh tasting and the shrimp was so full of flavor. Probably my favorite calamari appetizer I've had. (I've had so many calamari appetizers to boot, haha) But it was delicious. For dinner I had a caesar salad, and my boyfriend had the blackened shrimp fettuccine. Both my salad and his pasta, weren't drenched in sauce and had the right amount of flavor. It was so good. We were so full from dinner, that we just sat in our booth and talked. We enjoyed the view of the strip at night time.

I hate coming in super late because I know everyone's trying to get out of there and most of the time everyone is rushing and not that attentive. The hostess assured me it was perfectly fine and not to worry. I should have trusted my instincts. I think the kitchen was ready to get out of there. 

Service was great, but we were very disappointed with the food. I wasn't super hungry so my husband and I planned on splitting everything. We started with the caprese which was fine...it would be tough to mess that up since it's pretty much tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. Then we ordered the 3 cheese ravioli...the raviolis were cold even with the heated sauce on top and the raviolis themselves were really hard. We wanted to be easy going so we just asked our server for fried mozzarella instead which he happily did. 5 min later I look up and here comes out server. I'm thinking to myself ""wow they cooked that really fast. I wonder if someone else originally ordered that for their table and they gave us priority.""  Come to find out we got it so quickly because it wasn't cooked!!  It was fried on the outside, but the cheese was ice cold, not even melted at all.

I ordered the ""assorted grilled fish"" entree which came with a side of spinach.   The lobster was prepared well but fairly small.  The scallops were a bit burnt.    The salmon was too salty to taste while I could not even stomach another darker fish on my plate.

There are a lot of choices to choose from for salad, soup and sandwich, so good luck with the combo when you need to pick one of each. :)

I've found that the French dip sandwich is exceptionally good. The au jus isn't very salty and a dip of the sandwich in the au jus gives the roast beef + bread just the right amount of flavor. I round up my meal with chicken noodle soup and a Caesar salad.

It was still very bright outside, but once we got inside it felt like night had fallen. The interior is pretty intimate with dim lighting and artistic architecture.

We were greeted at the bar by the friendly bartender right away. There were only two other people at the bar and they seemed to be regulars, which was a good sign. The bartender gave us a rundown of all their happy hour specials and pulled out a special Halloween cocktail menu (themed cocktails FTW). I decided to go with the Arachnophobia and Don got Child's Play. It took a while to make, but I didn't care because the cocktails looked so cool! My ultra blue drink was topped with black spiders and cotton candy that literally just arrived from It's Sugar. Some guy sitting on the other end of the bar even came up to me and asked if he could take a picture of my drink! Don's drink was pretty strong, which he enjoyed. It had crushed Fruity Pebbles around the rim of his martini glass and a creepy eyeball just floating around (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UpRyw9XAlGNrKNqyZGUNHA/l.jpg). If I had the time, I probably would've ordered another Arachnophobia because it was so tasty and not overly strong. The cotton candy made it all the more fun!

Using my Nearby feature on my Yelp phone app while at the South Strip Bus Terminal in Las Vegas, I located this nearest eatery.  With only a couple of hours before my bus departure, I walked the 100 yards to this Deli.

Once I entered, I felt quite welcome.  Most if not all of its patrons were local LVians.  I took a quick turn of the place to see all it had to offer.  All of their salads were well displayed and looked fresh.  

I opted for 1/2 a seafood salad - simply because of presentation (you eat with your eyes first).  It looked really fresh.

Taste:  The salad was indeed fresh.  Some of the freshest shrimp, calamari and octopus I've had in LV.  The salad was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette.

Because it was a cold drizzly day, I also ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup.  I know, this is a weird combo; but, it worked.

What's great is that if you are wearing dark pants/skirt, they ask if you'd like a black napkin upon seating you (which I think is very considerate so that you don't leave with white fuzz when you're done). 

Service: A+ Very courteous and professional 

Food: A+ Good size portions so that you can eat 1/2 now and take 1/2 home for lunch/dinner the next day. I had the penne with eggplant, sun dried tomatoes... and it was GREAT. Light but filling so that I took 1/2 home. My companions ordered the veal special and the risotto... both of which were very good. (I like to sample everyone's food if they let me. LOL!) 

Wine Menu: A+ Good selection. 

Ambiance: Very nice.... It's ""street level"" ... meaning that you are not elevated.... but you do have a really good panoramic view of the airport and strip... so you can watch the planes land while the strip lights glitter in the background. 

Good for business meetings: Yes. They managed around us and our stuff....and refreshed drinks without interrupting us which I couldn't figure out how they did that (of course, I wasn't paying attention either).

As for the ambiance, the lighting was absolutely horrible and then through the dinner the light flickered and then there was dimming of the lights.  You figured they'd have the lighting figured out by now.

The service was the worst part of my visit.  When I pay this much for dinner, I expect the food to be good but I'm also expecting for some high quality service.  The place wasn't even half full so they can't even use the excuse that it was a busy night for the poor service.

1. When we first sat down, we were given a wine list and it probably took almost 20 minutes before we were given a dinner menu.  And when we were given the dinner menu, we were told about the specials in 2 sentences and no explanation of the specials.

2. I asked the waiter for if there were any bottles of syrah.  He looked absolutely clueless and pointed out the SHIRAZ rather than the SYRAH and said that's all that he knew they had.  After he left, I flipped a couple pages and found that there was a whole listing of SYRAH's.

The polenta was not creamy...it was gritty.The lamb chops were ok. My husband's were a nice pink color...mine were overdone. They were lukewarm, and the crusting was soggy. They had a stingy smidgen of sauce...not enough to make them memorable, and it was a horrible pairing of these with the polenta, which was also quite bland. The dessert was absolutely disgusting. Soggy, stale tasting pieces of apple...it was too disgusting to even eat. We voiced our disdain, and the waiter returned with a duo of an apple tart and tiny piece of tiramisu, which was one of the worst tiramisu I have ever had! For an Italian restaurant, that tiramisu was a complete embarrassment to the establishment. All the food was dry, like it had been sitting in warmers too long. Our water glasses were dry for an extended period of time (probably because the waiter knew that he would be getting an 18% gratuity automatically added to the bill, regardless of his service).

My hubby had meatloaf, and I had spinach ravioli. At one point, the manager, Mark Lopez, stopped by to talk to us about our choices. We ended up talking for a long time about how the restaurant began their plant-based menu. It was quite a transition for a traditional restaurant. However, Mark is a committed guy. He really wants to affect the health of the people that come to this restaurant, but the first goal is to make sure it is delicious. He is succeeding.

C had the Grilled & Roasted Vegetable Salad and I had the Pear & Gorgonzola Salad. We each raved about our salads (to one another). While my salad was wonderful, I found it strange that they didn't use crumbled gorgonzola, instead opting to place one solid, one inche cube of cheese on top of the salad, making it difficult to eat it with the greens. I soon pushed the cheese away, after struggling with it, and enjoyed a really nice pear salad.  ;) Really the flavor of the salad was simply divine (even without the cheese).

We shared the Lasagna Bolognese and we're glad we did. It's a very rich lasagna and more than enough to share. As it was, we were so satisfied, that dessert was impossible.

The Linguini Seafood entree was served with perfectly cooked pasta with shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine and a touch of lightly spicy tomato sauce. A tasty dish with a  nice mix of seafood, however the mussel was not thoroughly cleaned and contained some grit.

The Chicken Piccata was not a winner. It is a Pan-seared chicken breast in a lemon-butter and caper sauce on a bed of roasted potatoes The chicken breast was bland, lacked seasoning and was a tough piece of bird. The dish was unacceptable and sent back to the kitchen. Although the wait staff offered a replacement it was declined. The meal was removed from the bill.

Based on this visit we will not return as there are many other Italian Restaurants around town that do it much better.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,2,KCmmrn7exvpAyKj-uLMdtg

Over time this place is starting to go mainstream with losing some of the homemade items. A lot of the pasta was made onsite in the beginning but since the new head chef, some things are missing. The homemade Lemoncello is gone... and once you've had the good stuff nothing compares. I have been to Panevino at least 40 times since they have opened and frankly I still go back. Yes some things have gone mainstream, but you cannot get a better southern Italian meal in Las Vegas.

I'm always skeptical of expensive Italian restaurants in tourist areas, as they're often just using tomato sauce from a can and charging you $17 for it. But everything at this place was perfect. We called for a reservation and asked for a table by the window for the fantastic view of the strip. When we came in, they led us right to a table with a perfect view. The servers were all so polite and extremely prompt with new silverware for every dish we had, refilling our wine and water. The food was SUPERB. My boyfriend looked like we would cry when he finished the rib eye and he said he didn't ever want it to end because it was so good. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli with a parmesan cream sauce, which just melted in my mouth. We also had the bread which was like soft pillows, plus the fried mozzarella which was divine. For desert, we shared a tiramisu, and it was fantastic. If you are looking for a very romantic, low lighting, nice ambiance, great scenic view, amazing food and service, you have to try this place.

Clientele is higher end the venue gives you that romantic feel with large, high windows with great views of the strip.  Panevino is 5 stars all the way for venue.

We went for Happy Hour but also shared an entree from the main menu. Happy Hour includes about 10 dishes which are discounted appetizers off the main menu.  They also have about 10 wines at $7 each.  The main menu is very extensive with both a plant and non-plant version of homey Italian dishes.  Prices are astronomical though with an average pasta dish unbelievably close to $30.  Appetizers are around $16 as well.

The Happy Hour trizza, salad, and fish tacos were fine for the price of about $6-8, but didn't seem worthy of the venue.  The fish tacos were a bit cold, the salad was basic, while the trizza was the standout with cheese, pepperoni, and spinach/mushroom varieties.  Quality was just average and seemed more of a neighborhood variety.  The spinach ravioli came with about 5 raviolis.  They were fine and unique with a walnut filling and spinach cover, but for $5 a ravioli, not worth it at all.

The bar area is well worth a visit alone.  Come during Happy Hour and get a quality drink for a good price between 5:00pm and 7:00pm.  Happy Hour and venue 5 stars.  Restaurant itself probably falls around 3.5-4 stars.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,4,jtrT4ojEFhCc81nlMPgfrQ

The plant-based menu is amazing. I've had almost everything on there and it's all super delicious. My husband (who's non-veg) loves it here and said he'd go vegan if every meal was like Panevino's meals.

The other night I tried the braised beef short ribs. They were absolutely amazing. I've been dreaming about them every since. Boneless and completely melt in your mouth deliciousness.  Served with blue cheese mashed potatoes. $31

My roommate had the lemon chicken and of course I had to try a bite Very moist and tender, really good. $29 he also often orders the risotto $28-$30.

The huge standout was the Caprese Martini, yes I said that right. CAPRESE MARTINI. Holy goodness it was good. It's only a seasonal drink, but I'm hoping that it sticks around for a little while. It's a little steep at $11 but oh so worth it.

In the past I've had the Blackend Chicken  Rigatoni $28 and a super yummy Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli $27. Everything is always amazing.

Among our group last night was Major Martin, a pilot who referred to the design of the place, with its curving glass wall overlooking the airport runway at ground level from across the street, as ""the sexiest air traffic control tower I've ever seen"".  The view of the Strip across the runways is stunning. The proximity and ease of access at ground level makes Panevino a simple choice.  If you aren't in the mood for a full dinner, the bar is exceptional.  This venue has always served me well as a spot to meet for business at lunch as well as dinner or cocktails.  

Our party of eight included the discriminating tastes of the Consul of Chile and the Consul of the Czech Republic, visiting with a former consul of Slovakia.  Though we had two more in our party than our reservation, the staff quickly and happily extended the table.  The chicken risotto was perfect, with great care apparent in the freshly chopped ingredients.  The creme brulee was likewise ideal. My companion's tagliatelle was reportedly the best ever.  Other dishes were likewise said to be fantastic.  

The extensive wine selection here is usually a hit and reasonably priced.  Last night was no exception. Staffed with a crew of well trained professionals with wonderful, welcoming customer service attitudes, this would be a five star rating except for a few minor flaws, the occasional empty glass, the uneven table, the nuances here and there.  But take into consideration that this is a high-end ambiance very well priced, a tough arena in which to compete.

My local friends were thinking we would just have lunch at the deli, but to our surprise the main restaurant was open.  What a beautiful space!  Interesting curvy windows that face the strip and the airport.  The decor was warm and inviting.   Right in the middle of the restaurant is what appears to be a support pole but is a mosaic lady's leg, although I'm not sure you would realize what it was from a different angle.  I am sure at night this is a very romantic space (2 members of our group got engaged there), and it is definitely upscale.  Our party had just come from wine-making and we were casually dressed and a bit rowdy, but that didn't affect the service or our welcome one bit.

It's funny that the other reviewers mentioned the choice of napkins because I made comment to my friend that I loved them!  We all had white napkins, but they were so nicely textured and such high quality - okay I have a thing for linens - that I knew we were in for a treat.  The service was excellent and our 2 waiters had a great sense of humor, although we did not get the table dance we asked for, the cute blond waiter did do a little Irish jig for us!  

They had a nice variety of wines by the glass to choose from and reasonably priced at most under $10 a glass.  They brought out fresh breads served with a small dish of olive oil and topped with balsamic.  I had the linguine with seafood, mussels, clams, shrimp, scallops in a light and fresh tomato based sauce.  It was wonderful, especially the scallops that just about melted in my mouth.  Yum!  Nice sized portion, I didn't finish all the pasta, but there wasn't enough to take for later.  The dessert menu read like the best food porn, but we had homemade cherry port and chocolate brownies waiting for us at our friends, so we passed.

3459553,2012-07-09,2,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Breaking news kids! Panevino has a vegan menu....2 items only but still...it's a start!

Panevino has been a staple of ours when we've felt like having a meal at a nice Italian restaurant that offers us vegetarian options, a nice ambiance and not dealing with the craziness of the strip. As per what we've known to be customary, Panevino delivered this time again. 

The restaurant is elegant - dark. slightly dressy, a great view of the Strip and the airport and impeccable service. 

I ordered the vegan tortellini - made in the restaurant 100%, the shells were stuffed with some kind of tofu mix and all sorts of veggie goodness! Asparagus tips scattered the plate in a rich tomato sauce. A +!

Husband ordered the second veggie dish - the veggie burger. Yes, I yawned when he placed the order but DANG is that thing good. The patty itself is made in-house with a mix of veggies, potatoes and breadcrumbs. Yummers. Served with the BEST grilled veggies (asparagus and an insane roasted potato) and a vegetable broth based dipping sauce (french dip dreams perhaps?)...this was one solid burger. If I'm in the mood for a veggie burger...I'll probably head here the next time I'm back in Vegas. 

Our friends ordered the halibut which apparently was so fresh and crazy delicious. The lemon chicken was also quite delicious I hear. 

Prices are a little steep - approx 25 dollars for each veggie dish and 30-35 for the fish/poultry. 

Panevino is a dependable staple for a non-strip but centrally located pleasant Italian dining experience. 

With the vegan additions (I hope they multiply the menu options), Panevino came through for me in a big way this time!",pngNlr9t4HObDgecGH_jaw,2,3,4,8KIdn1J92noVYTSzYlqgpw

The decor inside is really cute, and the side of the restaurant facing the airport is ALL glass - so you get some entertainment watching the airplanes.

We had a huge feast for 5 - appetizers, soups, entrees, desserts, and sodas (no alcohol) and it came out to be $250!  Luckily my company was paying, because that's a lot of money!  It would have been way less expensive if we didn't splurge on the appetizers/soups/desserts.  The entrees are large and reasonably priced.

Here's my breakdown of everything I tried:

Fritto Misto (calamari) - excellent
Bruschetta Vegetariana - like classy pizza!
Pappa di Pomodoro (tomato soup) - tomatoy goodness! (very thick)
Farfalle alla Contadina (Bowtie Pasta with Chicken) - incredible

The sorbetto that we had for dessert was crumbly and kind of hard to share (we were reaching over for bites and dropping icy crumbs everywhere) - but was just the sweet I needed after a big carb-filled lunch!

In the case of Panevino you get poor service and a forgettable dining experience. A spontaneous dinner plan for my wife, kid and myself resulted in us coming here after our first few options were busy. I'll admit I looked like crap with old jeans with holes and a raggedy flannel shirt. That slightly homeless look lead to our server directing us to the back page of the wine list with all the cheap stuff with ""the items we would be comfortable with."" I know I looked bad but I thought I looked better than the guy at the bar wearing a track suit.

The meal started out ok with two small crab cakes, breaded on the outside and topped with two delicious sauces. Dinner took a sharp turn south with the hummus rolls. It sounded interesting and even looked good. Unfortunately, it had an odd smokey flavor and an aftertaste that had me reaching for my wine and bread to cleanse my palate. My wife had the filet. Laying on a bed of mashed potatoes and smothered in a thick mushroom sauce, it wasn't the best grade of beef. For my entree I went with the short rib risotto. The deep and savory flavor of the chunks of beef were satisfying, but the grains of rice had a soft, mushy overcooked texture. Desserts were slightly better. They get points for sending out a complimentary strawberry shortcake. Two layers of light, crispy puff pastry sandwiched a layer of strawberries. We also followed it up with a chocolate souffle that came out unusually quick. Baked to order? Probably not, but the rich, dense, chocolatey dessert with chocolate ice cream wasn't bad. Any dessert overloaded with chocolate will typically get a positive reaction from me.

The place is romantic and intimate with a nice view of the airport and the Strip in the background. Unfortunately, the food wasn't on par with the atmosphere and the service made the experience even less enjoyable.

I figured the combo is a great way to try out Panevino.  The combo includes half a sandwich, side salad, and a cup of soup for close to $10.  I decided on the meaty (prosciutto, salami, capicola), cup of chicken noodle, and a side of Caesar salad.  I was very full after eating this combo.

There is no argument that Panevino is a spacious and impressively designed restaurant with an abundance of parking. It has a mid noise level with a romantic-ish ambiance and dim lighting. 

Unfortunately the night I visited, service and food was not on par with the aesthetics. Service was slow and servers seemed confuse. Dishes that were ordered came out all together, however the servers had no clue who had what, isn't that service 101? Water was filled, but rather infrequently and several times we were left without water for at least 15 minutes. Empty plates were picked up one at a time? What? Why would they pick up only one and run back to the kitchen? Waiting for them to complete the bill transaction took what seemed to be a decade. Perhaps it was a fact that we were a big group and our total bill being over $600 meant they were getting a big tip regardless, but nonetheless disappointing. 

Onto the food! Food prices may seem reasonable for a classy Italian restaurant, but portions represent no value. Four cheese ravioli came with FOUR ravioli, good lord, how can you even get satisfied with FOUR pieces of ravioli, especially for $26. Maybe if they caused orgasms in your mouth then it could be justified, but it did not. The Shrimp and Scallop Risotto ($29) was a better value, as it had just enough protein, but unfortunately the shrimp was overcooked, oh well. At least they served free Italian bread with oil and vinaigrette. 

Will probably pass on Panevino in the future, sorry.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,6,2,2,Y_62kVZgVLxR6DWg2_2WCA

They offer 22 different varieties of fresh salads and 21 different varieties of sandwiches. You can order salads and sandwiches in half portion. They also have daily special hot dishes and deserts. 

I enjoyed both their meaty (prosciutto + salami + capiolla) and caprese sandwiches. However, mixed berry cake was a bit too sour for me. A small plastic bottle of S. Pellegrino water is selling for $4. It sounded a bit higher to me when I saw $5 per half portion of sandwich on my receipt and the latte is only selling $4.50 here!? Next time, I will order coffee or something else to go with my sandwich. Panevino Deli is 3.5 stars in my Yelp book.",VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA,0,0,3,aPRzvXkLTJq74iFsAAetqA

Wasn't sure what to expect being that this restaurant is located right next to the airport, a ways off the strip... in kind of an industrial area.  While the menu is Italian, I wouldn't say it's really an Italian place, but I would say this was a very nice restaurant, with great food, good service, and a great vibe!  I was actually really surprised at how nice it was inside.  I had the Ahi Tuna... seared to perfection.  My friends had pasta and both of them loved it!  We ordered a special artisan bread and that was good too!  Nothing was bad.  I guess this is somewhere to go if you want to eat like a local in Vegas, and get away from the strip.

My only criteria for dinner was that it was away from the strip and it had to serve amazing lamb. (Birthdays aren't a birthday for me w/o my fave dish!)

The view OF the strip was amazing. You can even see the planes fly into town as it's near the airport...kind of bittersweet if you ask me cuz I was really homesick for my birthday...

The place was super romantical. You bring a date here, and you're sure to score! Don't take my word on it tho....lol

Since it was October, they had specialty alcoholic drinks like redRum, Bettle Juice, Hannibul Nectar...and they were quite tasty!!!

Another great thing bout the restaurant was that the owner made you feel right at home...from the first step in the place...with a hug and kiss on both cheeks... MAG-NE-FEEK

3682381,2014-12-01,1,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"The food and service are some of the best in Vegas- beats the Steve Wynn steakhouse hands down!!!

Mark, the Assistant General Manager and Mixologist puts any drink I've ever had to shame- and I've had very good hand crafted drinks. He gives an unbelievable attention to making high quality/craftsmanship drinks!!! Each season he creates a unique drink menu with a theme. Not one drink has High Fructose Syrup, artifical anything... you WILL thank me! 

It's a less rushed vibe than many spots on the strip with better/equal service at friendlier prices. And a phenomenal view of the strip.

For food, let me say that Carnivore's, Pescetarian's, Vegitarian's and Vegan's will delight! 

I'm partial to the Plant based menu options (thank you Vincenzo!!!). and many of my meat eating friends have enjoyed these dishes as well! 

I've been told they serve 'one of the best steaks I've ever had', the seafood platter is abundant and fresh, desserts are amazing! I've sent 20-30 people to eat at Panevino since discovering it several years back and I've only had people RAVE about it after dining- not one person has given a negative report!!

They also have a deli open during lunch which is worth a trip en route to the airport or casual lunch if you live in Vegas. 

You owe yourself the treat of dining there :-)

Within seconds of sitting down, someone besides the host took our drink order. Thirty seconds later we heard the dinner specials. one minute after that, we were asked if we had questions about the menu. 30 seconds later we had our bar drinks. We ordered a bottle of Malbec Wine from Argentina that was to die for. The staff constantly returned to refill the wine, the water and soda. The appetizers, salads and the meals arrived in a very timely fashion. I took the advice from the review by Gary T. and had the Grigliata Di Pesce ( Lobster tail, Salmon, Shrimp, Scallops, Tuna and Chilian Sea Bass Sauteed Spinach, Potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce) and was grilled just enough to get the grilled taste. He was correct about the $40.00 price tag. It was worth every penny. My wife shared a lamb chop dinner with her mother and asked if one of the three lamb chops could be cooked different. The lamb chops arrived cooked perfectly and tasted great. Two were cooked well done and one cooked medium rare. These guys also made the evening special with a birthday dessert for my mother in law.

3969887,2015-03-18,4,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I had a certificate from NPR and I requested Panevino.  I went yesterday for an early lunch that would be my meal for the day.  I arrived shortly after they opened at 11:30 and there was one other table occupied.  Before I left a bit more than an hour later, many tables were occupied.  

My server was Erik.  He was great!  He asked me if I wanted to hear the specials but I wasn't interested in what was being offered.  I did ask him the size of the tomato soup because I wanted an entr√©e also and didn't want to overdo it with the soup.  Satisfied it was smaller in size and not a bowl, I ordered that.  I then asked if he had his choice between two dishes which would he get.  I took his suggestion and ordered the bowties country-style.

 During this time, I was brought my iced tea and a trio of sliced bread--focaccia, Italian, and ciabatta.  The runner also had containers of EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  I asked him for just the olive oil.  I don't like balsamic mixed with olive oil for bread.  I needed some salt for the olive oil but there was no salt on the table so I did without.  The bread was very fresh and very good.  I had two pieces so not to destroy my appetite.

The tomato soup came and after Erik ground some fresh pepper, I tasted it and it was a winner.  This is not your normal pur√©ed tomato soup.  Rather, it was more like seasoned, squeezed Roma tomatoes.  The soup had good body to it.  A very auspicious start.

Then came the bowties country-style.  After some freshly grated cheese was added, I tasted the bowties.  Great flavor.  Country style means it's served with chicken breast cubes, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, roasted garlic, and a parmesan-white wine sauce.  This was very good!  Had this not been my meal for the day, I would have stopped and had some boxed to take home for later.  Instead, I bit the bowties and finished them off.

Erik approached and asked if I was considering dessert.  He got a dessert menu and before handing it to me said, ""I usually recommend the dessert trio.""  I looked over the menu and he was right on.  That's what I ordered.  I was brought a plate with a demitasse size cup with cr√®me br√ªl√©e, a small square of tiramisu, and a square of strawberry pastry cream Napoleon.  All three were good, but the pastry of the Napoleon was tough to cut.  There was no flakiness to the crust at all.

This was a great choice for lunch/dinner.  I could look out the window and watch the planes at McCarran taxi to runway 1L for takeoff.  It's across Sunset Road but it was close enough to enjoy the view.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,8,4,tu2IfAf825Epm30M2iTynQ

Panevino Service:  All my visits have been during the extremely busy business lunch rush or the Friday evening dinner rush and the service has consistently been on point.  Servers are all moving with sense of urgency and the kitchen gets the food out quickly.

Panevino Italian Cuisine:  Fettucine Alfredo is an Italian dish that can go wrong quickly if cheap ingredients and preparation is off in any aspect.  Panevino's has always come through for me.  The Alfredo sauce is on point with the creaminess texture and very flavorful.  The Fried Mozzarella has always been fried perfectly where it's still cheesy af (like me) in the middle.  The spinach salad is also a consistent performer as the ingredients are fresh, proportioned perfectly and the caramelized walnuts add a little something extra. High quality ingredients are utilized and you can taste it in all the dishes.

Panevino Ambiance:  Tall ceilings with huge glass windows by the airport runway make for a very nice open main dining area.  There's a high end classy vibe and the lights are dimmed considerably in the evening to make for a great intimate dinner environment.

The portions on the food are slightly less than I'd expect for the price point but it definitely makes up in heavy taste.  Quote from a friend ""These dishes are small and there's no unlimited bread sticks like Olive Garden?"" smh..we aren't at Olive Garden mf. =)  This a solid stand alone $$$ Italian joint off the strip that I'd like to visit more frequently and not in a business capacity.

Walking in the place is nice, clean, and a good location to meet a professional for a casual lunch or just to grab a quick bite. Prices must have gone up since some of these other reviews as i didnt see any of the $5.95 specials which is what i was looking forward to honestly. 
Check the online menu and consider those the be the accurate prices, because they are. There are a few chalk board specials but they are all in similar price range as well maybe just combinations and or seasonal items as the specials. 
I wasnt paying so i got the cheapest thing on the menu a $6.95 Mediterranean salad and it was less than exciting. I think the lack of vinaigrette made for a bland salad. Fresh yes... something to help the mushy olives taste and texture not so much. Everything looked very good from others plates and it might have just been what i ordered. Im sure that with another chance and me ordering say a sandwich it might turn out a little better although im not too big on paying $10 for a sandwich. I think if the place is a nice setup for a lunch especially if your trying to eat light and fresh.

But you could look at it a different way. Maybe time away from all the slot machines and drunk kids playing blackjack isn't a bad thing. Panevino was nice and quiet when we got there. It's dimly light with a very elegant environment. I think the greatest thing about Panevino was the view of the strip. It really allowed you to take a step back and look at Vegas with all its bright lights and flashy decor.

Their menu is simple and not cluttered with a billion things you can order. I like that.
We ordered artisan bread as a starter to feed our group. It's awesome finger food. A friend described it as 'whoopie cushion' bread. You kind of wait for it to deflate or pop it yourself...depends on your mood or how you did at the tables I guess. Then rip away.

I got their blackened chicken rigatoni. It came perfectly al dente and the pasta has such a good bite to it. Homemade. The sauce was great. I normally expect most pasta dishes with chicken in it to contain a bunch of overcooked meat. This wasn't the case...I can't stress how soft the chicken was. It's like god himself cooked it with his bare hands while he was playing the slots and drinking a brewskie. Totally worth it and very good.

The service was lacking for the prices, I shouldn't have to ask for refills on drinks when my glass is empty. Awful.

My boyfriend of 5 years had proposed to me shortly after entering the restaurant, and the staff made our night so memorable and amazing. The manager had started us off with some complimentary fluffy bread that was filled with air. It was absolutely delicious and had tons of flavor for bread. We started off with some crostini for an appetizer, and then for dinner I got the plant based raviolis and my (now) fianc√® got the chicken. Our server was so kind and went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Another manager took the time to ask how I became plant based, and let it be known to me that he intends to expand the plant based menu. For dessert, they were kind enough to bring out a beautiful tray of desserts, and sparkling moscato. They also took our picture. I cannot express how much it means to me to be treated to exceptionally from the entire staff. Not to mention the food was beyond exceptional.

It was good, but would have been better if it was less salty. We also ordered a Rice Aracini ball and french fries. The french fries were crispy and not too greasy; however the Aracini Ball was a bit of a disappointment not enough cheese and  very bland. The biggest let down of all were the desserts, especially since they looked so tempting in the display case. We ordered a cannoli and the chocolate mousse creme brulee. The cannoli shell was not crispy and flaky and the marscapone was dry. The creme brulee was ok, nothing special about it at all.

Thirteen salads range from $6.50 (half the selections are in this price bracket) to $8.95 (seafood). Twenty-one sandwiches range from $5.95 (cheeseburger) to $8.50 (#15 combo- half sandwich, cup of soup, and a side salad). Also has hot food (fifteen selections) that range from $1.75 (fries) to $9.95 (meatballs). Soups are $4.50. The full size desserts (cannoli, tiramisu, creme brulee, cheesecake) are $5.00 but the mini size desserts are $2.25. Also has cookies, gelato, and sorbetti. 

I like the spinach salad for $6.95- baby spinach, bacon bits, egg slices, roasted almonds, and raspberry vinaigrette- mmm, it's really good; I've had it the most, at least three times. I don't remember if I had the chicken or turkey sandwich (had it once) but what I had was good. I remember the dessert being really sinful (also one time)- yup, a few hundred calories at least.

Pretty much every aspect of their normally amazing service was molasses slow, clumsy and not polished at all.  We waited for water, wine, salad, entree and desert. What should have been a 90'ish minute or so meal was THREE HOURS!!
Our newbie busser poured regular water into our Peligrino sparkling, apologized and got of another bottle which we were charged for.
This place normally has top level service but tonight was the C team.  The restaurant was busy but not jam packed CES level busy. No managers stopping by, nothing remotely special in what is normally a great restaurant.  The food was good.

4382341,2016-05-22,1,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"My review is for the deli side of the restaurant since I haven't had a chance to eat in the dining room yet. Since I work nearby this was a good lunch option for me recently. The location is easy to find and there is ample parking. 

Inside the caf√© is a bright room surrounded by windows for plenty of sunshine. Even at peak time there were plenty of clean tables. I also like that the staff clears the table at the end of the meal which gives it a slight edge over a similar option like Panera in my book. The menu board above the registers offers plenty of options including salads, sandwiches, soups, a few hot options like chicken parmesan, and desserts. If you wear glasses I'd suggest bringing them in since the board writing is fairly small. 

We arrived at the peak of the lunch rush to a long line. There was a lone cashier doing his best to move the line. It took about 10-15 minutes to place our order, but once at the front we were greeted with a smile by the friendly cashier. Fortunately, it didn't take another 10-15 minutes for our orders to come up. 

The Chicken Milanese sandwich was giant. Other sandwich options were normal size, but my pick was a very generous portion. Each half resembled a full size sandwich. The chicken was tasty and I liked that I was getting plenty of vegetables on the sandwich. The pesto mayo on the sandwich was tasty. The sandwich is served on a thick, crusty bread which was delicious. Even though I loved the taste of the bread I'd probably request a different kind next time. It was really hard to eat a large sandwich on hard bread. My side of Potato Salad was to my liking. 

The dessert options were calling my name so I ordered the Lemon Cake. This was delicious. The cake was delicate, the lemon flavor was perfect, and the coconut flavored sauce on the plate really enhanced the other flavors. 

Since I am food obsessed I didn't pay attention much to the cost of lunch, but my coworkers felt it was on the pricey side. I looked back at the menu after their comment and I think the value depends on what you order. Certain items were large portions and others came in more modest portions.

The caf√© offers a punch card which they offered my coworkers. I'm not sure why, but I wasn't offered a punch card and I'm the one that will return. The caf√© also allows orders to be called in for those on a time crunch!",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,6,4,4,B7A1YUtuI4HI5c8EpCzTWg

4421966,2011-03-04,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"My boyfriend chose this place for my birthday dinner after suggestions from his boss.
We both got the Prix Fixe menu which was $55 for a salad, appetizer, entree and dessert. 
I got the beef carpaccio for my appetizer and he got the bruschettone - his bruschettone blew my Carpaccio away.  My Ceasar 
salad was very good and my boyfriend really enjoyed his Spinach Nani salad. 
I am not a huge Italian food fan, so I was very worried that I wouldn't find anything on the dinner menu I liked so instead of getting pasta
I got the Bistecchine di Agnello which is three Lamb Porterhouse which may be one of the best things I have ever eaten. It wasn't 'lamby' or gamey or
tough. To be honest, if I hadn't know I ordered lamb, I would have sworn it was beef - delicious tasty beef. It was so much food I couldn't touch my third
porterhouse. Walt ordered the Gnocci and he loved it, I couldn't eat a entire bowl of it, but he sure did!  
The staff were very vocal in recommending the white chocolate cheesecake and the chocolate creme brulee as the best choices, and we took their advice.
The chocolate creme brulee is a creme brulee sitting inside a chocolate mousse cup, it was presented so nicely with Happy Birthday and Balloons created with
fruit flavored sauces. The winner was the white chocolate cheesecake though.  That plate had a flower presentation which was such a nice touch.

The staff was very attentive and even asked if we wanted black napkins because we were both wearing black, which is a detail I haven't seen in awhile.
Panevino is in a odd location with a fairly gaudy sign on the street, but the view of the Strip at night is very nice. It would be a great place to go
on New Years or the Fourth of July to see the fireworks.

I was disappointed in the lack of selection of wines by the glass, as they really focus on bottles and half bottles of wine.",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,3,2,5,jxRjN0CVG2JKNS7Lkv9sxQ

The photos of Panevino is far from false advertisement. What you see, is what you get. My experience with spendy restaurants, the Maitre D's always seem arrogant, but not at Panevino. As soon as we walked in, the Maitre D's acknowledged us with a smile and greeting. Plus, they greeted my wife with ""Happy Birthday."" They sat us at a U shaped booth with a nice view toward the Las Vegas strip. We also arrived perfect timing because the sun was setting and we had front row seats for that. Furthermore, our waiter, the waiter's assistant, and the server were also awesome. They all had an excellent balance of humor and professionalism. 

Now the best part, the food. For appetizers, we ordered crispy calamari and shrimp; and crispy Maryland-style crab cakes drizzled with honey mustard dressing. The crab cakes were phenomenal, the crab melts in your mouth. The calamari and shrimp were also delicious. For our main course, my wife had an Alfredo linguini with shrimp and the shrimp had that grilled taste to it, yum! I had the homemade spinach cannelloni filled with ricotta cheese and spinach in a fresh tomato and bechamel sauce. My wife and I normally share our dishes, but the dish I ordered was so appetizing that I did not want to share it (but I did anyway). For dessert, we were full and were going to pass even though their Tiramisu sounded delicious. However, something even better and memorable occurred. Our waiter surprised my wife with a complimentary decorative dessert plate with two cannoli's, chocolate cursive writing ""Happy Birthday"" with a chocolate balloon, and a lit candle.

Everything fell into place when I selected Panevino for an early client luncheon with myself and my manager. The only downside of an early lunch meeting with a client means no wine to pair with my dish, but even without the wine, Panevino delivered.
We were quickly seated in a booth that faced their large windows overlooking the Strip. 

Definitely would like to come back here to be seated here at night, with my hubs, for a romantic dinner. Service was quick and efficient. Our server let us know about their specials for the day, and then brought out drinks and complimentary bread.

I ordered the Seafood Linguini because yes, I am going to order the seafood when I am dining on the company dime. I can say this, I ate every piece of that dish and I enjoyed every single minute I ate it. This dish was spectacular and it came with: shrimp, scallops, clams, New Zealand mussels, garlic, white wine, and a hint of spicy tomato sauce. Panevino comes packing an extra punch with fresh-made pasta. Yes. If you have not eaten fresh-made pasta you're missing something in your life.

Unfortunately I did not get to order an appetizer or a dessert since lunch meetings tend to run on a bit of an ""hour and we're done"" kind of mantra.

I actually loved that Panevino was located just outside of the strip.  Not as hectic, more personal, yet still had gorgeous views.

Panevino had the BEST, yes the BEST, Ossobuco I've ever had.  Packed with flavor and paired perfectly with saffron risotto.  I ate the entire dish and trust me when I say you could have rolled me out of there.  I was so stuffed but I couldn't stop eating.  I thought I was done until the desserts arrived.  In the middle of checking the dessert menu, the manager brought out an entire tray of desserts for our table.  My favorites were Cannoli and Chocolate Mousse w/Creme Brulee Duo.

When you check in to yelp, you get a free glass of wine. I chose the white, and it was a nice mild selection.  They put complimentary bread on the table that was fresh and tasty.  

I ordered the seafood linguini and it was delicious. The linguini was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of pieces of seafood throughout the dish.

I had the pleasure of recently coming here for my company's party and I have to say I was quite impressed. The set up was great! We had our own private room along with a separate entrance and side bar. The perfect setting for easily socializing.

As for food we had a set menu which started off with a crab cake appetizer. These honestly were some of the best crab cakes I've ever tasted. Next up was a house salad, very simple and tasty. For an entree we had a choice of chicken, steak, salmon or spinach cannelloni. I went with the steak which had a great flavor to it, but unfortunately it was too overcooked for me. The side of potatoes though, man those were good. To top things off for dessert we had tiramisu. A perfect ending to a delicious meal.

They were able to accommodate us despite the busy holiday. There is a great view of the strip through the giant windows and the inside decor is modern yet romantic. They have some charming booths set up that face the windows; I definitely recommend reserving those in advance. 

Our server was extremely friendly and informative. The overall service is definitely 5 stars. 

We started with the scallops and crab cakes as appetizers. The scallops were my favorite and the crab cakes were good but not the best I've had. They provided us with a loaf of white bread (cold. I definitely prefer warm..) with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I had the veal for dinner and my boyfriend ordered the ahi tuna because unfortunately they were out of the Chilean sea bass. This was a downer because my boyfriend chose the place specifically because they had sea bass on the menu. I give both dishes, the veal and ahi tuna 3 stars. For how expensive they were, I expected better, but they were certainly enjoyable. The portions are very generous, so we were able to pack half of our meals. 

I had the featured chardonnay and wasn't a fan, so I ordered their glass of riesling. I can't say I made the greatest selections on the wine in general so that affected the overall enjoyment of dinner. I recommend asking the server for a good suggestion on wine pairing.

Overall, I recommend the place for a special occasion. Be prepared to spend some money if you want the full experience and be sure to make reservations or call in advance to check for availability.

I visited Vegas and my parents knowing that I am a vegan, wanted to take me to try Panevino's Plant-Based Menu. I was astounded by the amount of options this menu contained, especially as I know, that it is difficult to make Italian food vegan. However, the cherry on top of the incredible experience was meeting the passionate and charismatic General Manager, Vincenzo. We were able to speak with him about our excitement regarding the menu and he let us know that he crafted it! Vincenzo is a certified starch-solution and plant-based expert! Starch solution is high-carb veganism with minimal oil. He was able to describe the menu items to us and let us know the intricacies of creating each item in the healthiest way possible. I would have to say the coolest part of his personal and informational talk with us was that my family members who weren't vegan were able to hear Vincenzo's educated and passionate opinions on plant-based living. It was so eye-opening and my family felt truly inspired by his passion.

The calamari was crispy and seasoned perfectly. I also loved how it comes with shrimp.

I ordered the short rib risotto and it was amazing. It came with a tomato based sauce with thick chunks of short rib that was so tender it just melts in your mouth. This dish was just perfect. My friend ordered the sea bass special and that too was so delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked and flaked nicely with a buttery smooth taste. One of the best sea bass dishes I've ever tasted. 

We ordered the Tiramasu for dessert with port wine even though we were stuffed! It too was delicious and went perfectly with the wine.

Our server was amazing. He never rushed us and was always attentive but not obtrusive.

All that being said, a dew fair warnings: this place isn't for the poor. No offense of course, I myself am not a rich woman Lol, but be expected to drop a couple hundred dollars on dinner for two here, and even  more if you get some fancy wine. We expected to drop a load of money there as soon as we walked in & that was fine, but if you're not looking for a pricey meal, steer clear. Also, you'll want to dress up. Dress to the nines, it's a very fancy place & if you don't dress up you'll stick out like a sore thumb and probably catch some side eye from the other diners, although I don't believe there is any particular dress code, and I'm certain the staff wouldn't treat you poorly, it's definitely a place you'll want to show up looking your best. The sparkling water isn't free, and neither is the after dinner coffee. Try to get a Booth (or table) on the window side, as the view is a nice dinner companion.

I've been to Panevino numerous times and have always had a 5-star experience in terms of food, service, and overall experience, other than on New Year's eve e few years ago.  I'm going to stick with a 5-star rating because of their standard performance, which has always been consistent all but the one time on New Year's eve.

Their wine list is extensive and their sommelier is very knowledgeable and polite.  The best bottle of chardonnay I have ever laid lips upon was at Panevino, granted it was upwards of $500/bottle, but hey, when you have a date trying excruciatingly hard to impress, take advantage;)  I can't speak for all of their entrees but the salmon and the rib-eye are grilled to perfection.  The caprese salad is worth mentioning as well.

Overall, I romantic date spot with a great view and perfect food.

I'd give 5-stars, but the markup on the bottles of wine is prohibitive. $55-75 for bottles that are $15 at Walmart...yes, Walmart. J. Lohr is the example I remember.

My wife had the vegan meat loaf topped with a unique tasty tomatoe sauce and a side of delicious risotto. So many vegan and gluten free choices here.

I chose the chicken Milanese for my half sandwich, minestrone soup and potato salad. I took a very long time for our food to be ready. They call out your number and you go to the counter to pick it up. I thought they had somehow skipped our order or we just hadn't heard it being called. Finally after 15 minutes we received our order. My sandwich was very good. The only complaint would be that the outside of the bread was too crisp. The inside however was nice and soft. My minestrone soup was just ok. The vegetables were sparse and were cut up extremely small but the flavor was good. The potato salad came on a Omar and was a huge portion. It was very good. Nice and cold and good flavor. All in all I had a good experience but would not recommend going on your lunch hour when you are pressed for time.",1M7qbeQoL8O5r_cUVEuKEw,0,0,3,s0qSmxjzZcrtnCOs7jWZsw

Celebrated by locals and convention-goers for over a decade, its location adjacent McCarran with floor-to-ceiling windows providing a unique vantage of south end of the Las Vegas Strip, it was with a friend and fellow writer that dinner was enjoyed at Panevino and as much as the spot may go overlooked by the local food media the quality is actually on par with several celebrated 'darlings,' while the room and service go step-for-step.

Treated as guests of the house, a request to undertake a family-style tasting seeing the kitchen select plates that they felt to show the Chef's work best, it was to nearly a dozen of the restaurant's long-held signatures that the evening unfolded and starting off with fluffy pan caldo and balsamic dotted olive oil alongside two drinks it was admittedly an unexpected treat that I truly enjoyed the Rum and Chartreuse Avocolada, as boozy sort of smoothy with no lack of vegetal creaminess and just enough sweetness added by coconut sorbet and pineapple juice.

Next presented a basket of warm housemade bread, the foccacia quite remarkable while the baguette was dry and out of place, course two featured a quartet of scallops with a light sear contrasting the nearly raw center, the piquant red sauce playing a robust foil to the sweetness of the mollusks while creamy cr√®me fraiche added a tangy finishing note.

Described as a signature of Chef Mario Andreoni, the second appetizer of the evening was presented as a trio of paired bites, and although the marinated artichokes were mild and by themselves quite pleasant the roll of pork proved quite unbalanced after the marinade, entirely overwhelming the cheese and eggplant to the point where the later was not detectable in a single briny bite.

Served throughout our meal by a waiter who'd recently been imported from elsewhere, but also looked over closely by General Manager Vincenzo Granata, whose years of training at Le Cirque have no doubt been put to good use, course four featured a duo of pastas and with each made in house the quality of San Marzanos and fresh Mozzarella were all that was required to accentuate the feather light potato dumplings while ribbons of  Tagliatelle were perfectly al dente beneath a robust and meaty short rib ragu.

Admittedly a bit pricey considering the off-strip location and a style of cuisine that can be found without the beautiful room and service for as much as 50% less within ten miles of the space, entrees consisted of Osso Bucco and Cioppino each priced at $49 and while the former was every bit as rich and tender as that at Ferraro's atop textbook saffron risotto the latter was mostly a one note experience, the seafood itself just fine while only the taste of tomatoes were detectable in the broth.

Moving onto desserts, the first round offered by Vincenzo while two more were selected to test the mettle of the pastry staff, suffice it to say that the ""souffle"" is nothing like one would expect from the description and although rich enough to be sure, still a textural disappointment as was the ""tart"" that presented more like a soggy millefoglie.

Treated to a double espresso on ice, my friend electing a simple cup of brew, round two of desserts stuck more closely to the classics and thankfully was executed with far more precision, the lemon cake light and aromatic alongside what is amongst the city's most restrained and balanced Tiramisu.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,9,3,EbqIdiloK_Q3qd37rPqNdA

Cioppino:
Losbter, salmon, shrimp, mussels, scallops, tuna, sea bass in tomato broth. Great fresh taste without having a briny feel/taste. 4/5

Short Rib Risotto:
In red wine sauce and parmesan cheese. Risotto was perfectly cooked and the short rib was very tender. 4/5

One of the best tasting salads I've had with no meat in it. I normally feel like I'm being punished when I eat a salad but this one was pretty enjoyable. It has mandarin orange pieces, pear, arugula, walnuts, endive, Gorgonzola cheese, radicchio with lemon dressing. 4/5

Chocolate Souffle:
Comes with chocolate gelato. Well-executed souffle with a runny center. 4/5

Panevino Trio:
Creme brulee, tiramisu and lemon pastry cream napoleon. A nice dessert sampler. However, the tiramisu and creme brulee were just marginal. 3.5/5

We decided to come here &  It was simply disappointing coming here.  I was so sad that I'm giving it a 3-star but it wasn't as great as the reviews & friends says it was.

My ratings:

SERVICE: (4.8 out of 5 stars)
I must admit, I wanted to give an extra star for the service they provided but man the taste of the food had to take it away.  When we were seated the took out the extra silverware, but they ended taking a little too much because we ended up with only one butter knife & one napkin.  We asked for an extra butter knife & napkin but they completely forgot about it and remembered when we asked a second time.  I didnt mind that they forgot about since we were sharing the napkin & butter knife. 

FOOD: (overall: 3.0 out of 5 stars)
As the sound of one loses would hear, ""wahhh wahhh wahh"" 
Appetizer: 
Shrimp & Squid Calamari (2.8)
The cost of the calamari & the size of it was not worth paying.  The taste and the flavors of it was not as strong as I would like.  The aroma was magnificent but taste was pretty bland.
Carpaccio (2.7)
Brio has better carpaccio.  I tried putting the beef carpaccio on the complimentary bread we had & added some parmesan cheese to enjoy this appetizer more. The salad that it had was very tasteful, I actually really liked it alot.

Entree (3.0)
Mine: Blackened shrimp with Alfredo fettucini sauce.  
The shrimp tasted amazing, it had the right amount of flavoring.  The alfredo not so much. The pasta was thin & it reminded me of one of those dinner plates that you microwave (lean cuisine,etc).  The pasta & alfredo sauce almost tasted exactly as the microwave dinner plates, how sad is that? sighs

Ambience/atmosphere: (4.5)
Very intimate and relaxing.  The view is almost spectacular since you can see the Last vegas strip from your window seating and the airplanes coming & going. 

We didnt even bothering ordering any desserts just because we were  that disappointed with our food.  I guess we wont be dinning here anymore.",oDyEexUT09e3XhxIp0-Wxg,3,3,3,tVz5gM9K4qBkuxFAX0hfCQ

So my husband and I started with the Forbidden Fruit and Morning Buzz, both martinis were awesome, those dangerous drinks that don't taste like alcohol but will put you on your ass. The rest of the party got lovely glasses of wine.  We were also presented with a delicious complimentary bread basket with olive oil and balsamic for dipping.
We shared some salads, the Andrea salad was amazing, how can a salad taste that good?
For entrees we got Veal Piccata, Bone in Ribeye with Gnocchi, Assorted Griilled Fish, and the Spinach Tortellini. Everything was delicious. My husbands gnocchi was the lightest and best I have ever had. My grilled fish was simple but so good with such a variety of seafood, and I was able to switch out the potatoes it came with for some pasta. They were very accommodating.

5556340,2018-02-24,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Upscale Italian vegan food?! Say no more, I'm there! 

Been wanting to try their vegan menu for months & finally got to on a Friday night thanks to the fianc√©. He made the reservation with no complications and we were seated right away upon arrival. The restaurant is huge, splitting into a separate deli/cafe area, then the main dining hall, then towards the back is the lounge/bar area with a nice romantic ambiance. We got to sit by a lovely view of the Strip which he was able to request while making our reservation. 

There's a separate plant based menu that includes a variety of vegan dishes that all sounded so amazing! There's even two vegan desserts that the restaurant offers. I decided to go with the spinach ravioli with their house made ricotta and my fianc√© went with the short rib risotto. Both dishes were good but not as great as I had hoped; my dish only came with 5 big ravioli pieces considering the price & I was still kinda hungry after. I had to eat more of the complimentary bread afterwards so try to satisfy my hunger. 

We also got the Panevino trio which includes a creme br√ªl√©e, tiramisu, and a lemon tart which were all so delicious - highly recommend this dessert! 

The service was great; server was very attentive & we always had our table cleaned right away as well as had our waters refilled ASAP. 

Overall it was a nice first time experience, I just hope the other dishes I try next time are more satisfying than the dish I had. But other than that, I definitely recommend for a nice fancy date night; don't forget to try to get a seat by the window view of the Strip skyline!",rKdGiLfeE55TClso9GtjsA,4,0,4,0NYg-5hj2DrpIJI_rjI0EA

5586769,2011-09-06,1,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"Off the strip but not so far off that visitors would be put off, tucked away in an office park along the southernmost boundaries of McCarran Airport, Panevino is not just a restaurant but a beautiful experience.

I brought my Mom here for Las Vegas' Restaurant Week and the $50.11 prix fixe menu from which we chose the Pera e Gorgonzola salad and the Carpaccio Piccantino to start. As an additional treat to share, we ordered the Crema di Carciofi e Finocchio, an artichoke and fennel soup. For entrees, she had the Ravioli with vodka sauce and I chose the grilled salmon.

But before we discuss the food... 

I did my #socialmediawhoredom thing and checked in, finding a check-in bonus on FourSquare! Every time you check in, you get a free glass of prosecco. Mom enjoyed that while I perused the wine list and talked to Gabriel, the manager and sommelier. He helped me choose a fantastic cabernet (yes, with fish! I am happy to report that Gabriel subscribes to ideas that I believe more people should also subscribe to... drink what you like, the rest will fall into place). The sauv blanc he chose for me later was a bit sweeter than the profiles I described/asked for, but it was still a fantastic wine. Gabriel knows his stuff, and he's happy to share.

OK. Foodgasm time. The soup was really good, but something, I didn't know what, seemed missing. Not to say it wasn't complex and deep and fantastic, but... something. River, our waiter, noticed I was considering the soup a bit more than most and said he knew what I needed. Returning with a pepper grinder, he cracked a generous three turns or so into the bowl... and it was PERFECT. Exactly what it needed and without detracting from the soup as it was served.

The salad was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet and peppery. The pears were perfectly poached and the cheese was so creamy and fresh that I'd question whether or not the cow was back there somewhere. Really, really done well. The carpaccio was fantastic, shaved perfectly, and had a great fresh taste to it (OK, so maybe the cow is gone now). There was certainly not enough of it on the plate. Definitely in my top five!

The ravioli was executed perfectly, the vodka and homemade sausage sauce was tangy and meaty and just a bit sweet; really excellent. I will say I had hoped, based on the description, that there would be more sausage as part of the dish. The salmon, cooked rare by request, was by and large the best restaurant salmon I have had in years. Tender and flavorful and flaky.

Mom also had a homemade bread that looked much like the food-borne love child of a pita and a sopapilla: a rolled dough, round and relatively thin, with a great rise/puff to it. That was gently treated with olive oil, wonderfully chunky sea salt, and some herbs. I tasted it with the garnish and found it didn't need the proferred oil/balsamic dipping plate.

Desserts were a strawberry napolean (flaky, creamy, sweet; fab) and a creme brulee-filled chocolate mousse... Yeah, that. Seriously the most amazing dessert I have had. Ever. Again I say ""foodgasm."" The plates were beautifully decorated and the service was amazing.

Service. As busy as Panevino was that night (a private party in one area, a large party not far from us, and what looked like a very busy restaurant), the service was efficient, perfectly timed, and very personal. River and Gabriel know food and were generous with their time, finding out what we liked, engaging us in conversation, and making sure that everything was exactly as it was meant to be. Add to all this a fantastic view of the airport and the strip (nightime tables by the window, all the way!)... it all comes together for a great ambiance and intimate, personal, tasty experience.

Driving by Panevino last night I suggested to friends we go there for dinner.

I ordered the Warm Artisan Bread.  We were nicely surprised when it came.  Didn't even take a pic and dug in.  It was so good.  I ordered the Artichokes & Zucchini.  That was just ok in my opinion.

I ordered the 'Ricotta' and Spinach Dumplings for dinner with vodka sauce.  That was yummy.  Hubby ordered the 'Ricotta' and Spinach Ravioli and the Pasta Fagioli soup.  Both were delicious.

 My father-in-law ordered the special salad that they offered that night and his wife ordered Blackened Shrimp with pasta.  They both like it also.

I ended up with minestrone soup and the Mediterrano Salad. MY guy got the lasagna. 

I have heard it can get pretty busy, but we arrived for a late lunch and it was pretty chill. It did take a minute for our food to come out, so I don't think this is the place for a ""Quick"" lunch.

They acknowledged our plant-based preference without us mentioning it other than in reservation notes.
 Michael was our server.  Professional and friendly.  We received the Artisan Bread and the Hummus Rolls (highly recommend those for anyone).  The eggplant in the hummus rolls was tasty and creative.  Perfection. 
  We ordered the Fried Artichoke side as another appetizer.  Lightly dusted in flour and most likely lightly fried in a pan, as opposed to a fryer, which left them tasting delicate and delicious.  
  For entrees we split the Grilled Vegetable Lasagna and the Organic Spinach and 'Ricotta' Ravioli.  Both really good.  The ravioli took a far first in my book though.  The lasagna was full of vegetables and not heavy on the noodles, which to me is great!  The ravioli was incredible and completely oil-free!  Cashew tomato vodka sauce. Walnuts. Basil. Homemade pasta.  Love it.
  Vincenzo, the general manager, was exceptional with his hospitality and conversation.  The staff was helpful and on top if their game.

It just did not compare to my Grandmother's cooking.  However, as I have recently eaten at some great Italian restaurants (Scarpetta, Angelini Tratoria, Fabbio's retaurant, etc), my opinion has changed.  These restaurants are able to serve Italian food that is NOT what Grandma makes.  They serve fancy and innovative dishes that are something special.

I ate with Mr. Riches at Panevino, and he felt the same.  Panevino didn't have anything that blew me away.  The meatballs for appetizer were good, but nothing special.

But we got the booth we had requested, and began with salty and warm Artisan Bread  that billowed like pliable Pita Bread, and was heavenly to eat either with EVOO or butter.  This cost $6.00 but was well worth it.  The complimentary regular Bread Basket also contained three types of tasty bread.  Fried crispy Mozzarella Cheese was great with a mild Marinara Sauce, and the golden Calamari & Shrimp Fritti was very good.  But my request for an aioli to go with the calamari was declined because the chef reportedly did not have some needed ingredients available, and the place was too crowded with diners.

Minestrone Soup was chock full of assorted vegetables.  My Caesar Salad was big and very good, and one of my party enjoyed an impressive looking Grilled Vegetable Salad that included red and yellow peppers, Romaine Lettuce leaves, asparagus, artichoke, and eggplant.

Service was good but not as attentive as before.  I had to ask for an Iced Tea refill once, and a straw twice.  And, a server was slow in bringing an ordered glass of wine and a cocktail.  The dark wood tables no longer had a linen tablecloth placed over them, so I thought the place looked less refined than previously.  But a nice touch was that lemon slices were served with plastic picks stuck in them.  

The Veal du jour was Veal Piccata, which was veal scaloppini in a very lemony Lemon Butter, Caper, and Parsley Sauce served with tasty Sauteed Spinach and fine, diced Roasted Potatoes.  The spinach was not creamy, as I now prefer.  The other diners at my table reported that they very much liked their Veal Marsala and Short Ribs with Mashed Potatoes and gravy, but I was told that the Four Cheese Shrimp Ravioli dish was cold. 

A Dessert Trio of Strawberry Napoleon, Creme Brulee, and Tiramisu was a great finish to a fine meal, but Diane and I were disappointed that a Dessert Duo is no longer offered.  We were told that this is because the restaurant no longer serves Chocolate Mousse.  When Diane expressed surprise that there was no artistry on the dessert plate as in all of our previous visits, and laughingly asked our server to take it back because of that, he reached out to grab and return the dish to the pastry chef to provide some decorative touches.  I said that would be unnecessary, and we launched into our wonderful desserts.  Then about 10 minutes later our server reappeared with a ceramic platter with nothing on it--just a special plate decorated with colorful fruit gel in the shape of leaves and blooming fruit.  It had a message written on it in Chocolate Gel that read ""Thank you For Dining With us"" (see pic).  This to me was a very nice, above and beyond gesture, and it helped to narrowly preserve a five-star rating for Panevino, which is still my favorite Italian restaurant for alta cucina in or outside Las Vegas.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,8,5,5,5UNUJjKGo76yy6K1ggMKDg

I work for a very large casino in Las Vegas, so I eat at 5star restaurants all the time, and I can honestly say this place blows them all out of the water. The ambiance is amazing, and the view is the absolute best I have ever seen in Vegas. This includes better than the rooftop views of Stratosphere, Voodoo Lounge, and some of the other clubs around the city.

The Gnocchi at this restaurant is AMAZING!

The rest of the food was amazing as well. We actually got Guacamole and chips as an appetizer (why an Italian place has Guacamole and chips I'm not sure though!) and it was the best I have ever had. The Guacamole was fresh, our waiter told us they made it per order fresh, and it tasted like it! The chips were amazing, and I would guess they made those there at the restaurant as well. Me and my girlfriend couldn't get enough!

Their drinks were great, we both got the pomegranate cocktail (forgot the actual name) and it was really good.

After dinner we went to their lounge, which is really nice, and they actually stayed open late while we finished our drinks before heading out for the night.

All in all, I would honestly say this has to be the best dining experience I have ever had, and we will be back. This place is for the ""romantic couple"" though, not the casual lunch I would say.

However, during my this last visit on January 6th, things have changed. The atmosphere was there. The food was good. The service- the waitress... not so good. In fact, her hospitality and behavior was quite terrible and I was definitely not pleased. I was entertaining co-workers from out of town and was embarrassed that I had suggested Panevino.
Issues; slow service, did ask if we wanted to order drinks, tried to talk us out of ordering an appetizer, did not offer parmesan cheese for ravioli dish that obviously needed it, tomato soup was warm at best, offered cracked pepper and there were no salads on the table. Order 2 Peronis and she delivered 1 (had 2 on the tray). Just completely clueless.
I do have to say that the manager did show great concern for the issue when I brought it to his attention. He offered to provide desert or wine to correct the issue, but I was up front and let him know that I was concerned for the service and was not looking for freebies. He did end up removing some items from the final bill.
In closing, I will eat here again because I believe that everyone should get a second chance. I just hope that I do not have a similar experience, because there will not be a third time.",rX8AHWz_0apK5MUBKfOnIg,0,0,2,RW-7ohv0InhU6hd2BAwUUg

We had a choice of salmon, steak, or chicken a salad, bread, and dessert. 

Very nicely presented and timed. I'd recommend the salmon, then chicken, then steak. My steak was tougher than it needed to",LTTDNbzWHsoGOdxYNIdSqQ,0,0,3,UtJeNBVMNFaimMKTVvv5Yw
5880384,2017-12-19,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"So what intrigued me to go here is because my family and I have been trying to find all the plant based eateries in the city! I came across this Italian restaurant who I seen had a pretty decent looking Plant Based Menu. 

We came here on Dec. 18th for my brothers birthday. 
It's definitely a beautiful place for a birthday. I'd suggest to go when it's dark out so you can see the lights of the strip. They have a great view of the strip from almost every seat.

& The service was good!!!

As far as the food goes, my husband and I ordered from the Plant Based Menu. 
And parents got otherwise (in photos.) 

I really enjoyed the bruschetta! That was my favorite appetizer. 

The other food I ordered I got weren't worth the price in my opinion. Including my entree. I ordered the Vegetable Lasagna. No where on the description of the dish did it say ""Gluten Free."" There was no pasta in it!!!!  
Although, It did say ""Low Oil,"" which indeed it was. The dish over all was lacking in flavor, sauce, and should've had the traditional marinara sauce and at least a few layers of pasta. It was very bland. I was pretty upset about this.

But I would try to come back to try something else.

They have plenty of options to choose from, including soups, salads, sandwiches, pasta, and desserts. Their food is prepared with great quality items and always tastes freshly prepared. 

They have their own parking lot, so it is a quick place to get in and out of. They have fantastic food, good service, and I would consider it a very top notch business.",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,0,0,4,SXVKH8CdMBOfopq1xm5ufw

I have been wanting to stop in here for lunch for a while, unfortunately it was very disappointing. Three was a short line so we had some time to browse the large selection of sandwiches, soups and salads. After ordering you sit down and they call your number when its ready, not sure why they can't just deliver to your table? 

We ordered the chicken club and the tuna melt, both with potato salad. It took quite a while for the food to be ready and it wasn't that busy. The tuna melt was awful, it was really fishy and obviously not albacore tuna. It tasted like the cheap chunk tuna in cans and the bread was quite hard. It also had a really thick cut slice of tomato that I didn't care for. 

The bread of the chicken club was also hard. The sandwich was better than the tuna melt but still fell short of our expectations. The one thing we did like was the potato salad so that saved a one star rating. I really hope the actual restaurant is far better than the deli as I would still like to come back and try it some day. As far as the deli, no reason to return.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,1,2,je1FldUAYL6BtZCCjsSxwA

We played about 40$ each in the machine before we even got our drinks, which once ordered, took another 10 minutes to receive. We were asked if we wanted the happy hour menu, and we said yes, and expressed we were hungry. Another 10 minutes later we get the menu. Then 10 minutes after that, she asked if we wanted another glass of wine, we said yes and proceeded to attempt to order food but she walked away. You guessed it about another 10 minutes later we got out wine and she walked away abruptly as if she didn't want to take our food order. We decided to just to leave and asked for our bill. We waited again for her to bring it, and guess what. Nothing was comped for gambling.

Being an Italian food snob, I can say for sure, this is one of the finest Italian dining experiences I have ever had. I think what I like most about this place is the location.  It's away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  If you are visiting Vegas and want to get away from all the glitz and make believe of the hotels, go to Panevino.  Yes, It's that good.",t8mN38niaaT_Ec4aWZ_80g,1,0,5,k1uNyUJlUWalNfjXOZsINg
5930294,2017-12-05,0,YNDxeeRUARbd8GRnscJSvg,"I had such a disappointing experience last night. I've been to Panevino several times prior and been blown away by the food. I'm vegan and gluten free so it's amazing to me that they offer a plant based menu and label what is gluten-free. I've tried the lasagna and the pesto mushroom risotto. I remember being blown away by the lasagna and thinking the risotto was pretty good but simple.

It had been a few years since I visited panevino last and I wanted to surprise my boyfriend for his birthday. The service was nice enough I suppose but not the most genuine feeling. I added in my reservation that it was my boyfriend's birthday and that whatever to make it a little more special would be wonderful so they gave us a happy birthday dessert plate at the end of dinner which was lovely and a nice touch.

My main issue was the food. I've had the hummus rolls dish several times in the past and it did not taste the same. I remember loving the crispy arugula on it but it didn't have any sort of flavor this time around. I had to salt that dish a lot.

I got minestrone to share and that was just.. not good. I've had minestrone from a can that was better than that.

I should've stuck with what I've known but I decided to try something new for the entree. I ordered the ricotta and spinach dumplings. I swear I got another appetizer. The dumplings were just little balls of spinach that were lightly breaded. Literally just little balls of boiled spinach mushed together. It would've been lovely as an appetizer but for a $26 entree I expected something more substantial and somewhat filling, at least. I understand at these kinds of restaurants portions are small but there was like I said, no substance. I was upset as soon as I received it but I didn't want to embarrass us by complaining about it. It really was not worth ordering.

I ordered the chocolate gelato with warm almond milk as my dessert. Awful. Just terrible. No creativity behind it. Maybe my expectations were too high but I expected a fancier dish than two little scoops of gelato soaked in a terrible tasting almond milk with slivers of almonds and dried cranberries randomly thrown in. I've been more creative than that in my own kitchen. I ended up having to eat around the slivered almonds and dried cranberries because it was too Trail mix for my taste. Maybe if they had gone lightly. Either way not worth ordering. No noticeable effort in that dish whatsoever.. I would've preferred the gelato on its own.

My boyfriend said his shrimp was ok. Minestrone is his favorite food and he didn't care for Panevino's. His prime rib was also overcooked.

I'm very disappointed by the food and experience and if I could go back in time I would have gone elsewhere. It's even more disappointing because of how wonderful it was when I last went those other times years ago.",tiNBpM5jQQvFAw_1zQWTGQ,1,0,3,w7fXDSo5ACaZ3W1NyTDGvw

It's clean, has ample parking, beautiful view, great for events, awesome happy hour specials and the manager is circling around constantly for anyone's needs. The lighting and music selection make it incredibly romantic.

It is a little pricey but when you want to go somewhere nice and you have someone with dietary restrictions - this is a place that can accommodate everyone. Very impressive plant based menu. Most chefs are intimidated by doing something along these lines and they kept it classic, simple and tasty. I never regretted not ordering the meat dish. Yum. All of the dishes that came out were made with attention and care. You can tell someone took their time on the food because nothing is rushed. Plenty of desserts to choose from.
