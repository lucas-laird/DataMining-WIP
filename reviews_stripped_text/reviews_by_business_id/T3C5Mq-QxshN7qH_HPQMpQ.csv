We came rolling into the drive thru which was absolutely packed with cars spilling out into the parking lot.  The decision was made to proceed and wait it out.  The line moved rather quickly.  A #5 (ultimate cheeseburger combo) was ordered.  I went only with some onion rings.  As we made our way car by car through the drive thru...I spotted what appeared to be a fireplace?  A fireplace that can be seen inside and outside?  Crazy!  The number five was as ordered and my onion rings were fried to hell. A fireplace???,HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,4,1,3,JQ46KHHovT3a5Fp-ArwJQQ

It looked great so we thought we would try it.  I asked the waitress what size the ribeye patties were (how many ounces) - no one knew.  So we ordered double meat and double cheese to go.  They were the worst burgers we had ever had in our life!!!!!!  It was like chewing shoe leather!!!!!   So dry, we almost choked!!!!  The curly fries were good.   We ordered the 7 piece jalapeno poppers.   Half of the order didn't even have jalapenos in them, just the breaded cheese.

I went and chcked it out as soon as it opened. We all know what food Jack Box offers us, so I won't waste anytime on that. The food I did get was pretty fresh and tasty like it should be, but took a little long to come out to the table. I will give them the benefit of doubt for now, because it was quite busy inside and in the drive thru as it had just opened days ago. This location is unique as the inside dinning layout is completly different from what we are all use to with Jack in the Box, all of the old locations being the same pretty much. This one really hits the mark. Stylish, clean, has a really good feel inside. Extra kudos to this location for having the touch screen order kiosk right at opening, and the fountain drink selection is bigger too. I will be going back often, I'm so excited!",5RLxzxLIY3ZXUUksr_dtXA,0,1,4,o4J1F2M43lir_8runwSjgw

Jack is constantly coming up with different and unique sandwiches so the menu does not get tired.  They always have the top sellers but it's nice to try new taste offering's.  

Another great thing about Jack, is that they serve breakfast ALL DAY! Not til 1030 only unlike the other chains.  Oh yeah don't even try to order breakfast at 10:32 because you just won't receive it.  

The one thing at this Jack that I cannot wrap my head around is that they have a fire place that can be visible from both the inside and out.  I cannot imagine them doing a Fireside chat at Jack in the Box.??? If we lived in Colorado or Montana I could understand, but this is Vegas. Why does any one need a fire place.

I don't eat a lot of fast food because a lot of it just doesn't taste good to me.  I ordered the Southwest scrambler plate, which is scrambled eggs with cheese, breakfast potatoes, onions, bell peppers and bacon (or sausage or both). I had it with the bacon and it was very good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the potatoes, especially.  A lot of places don't cook them well, they're still hard, but these were cooked all of the way with some crispy bits. This was a big portion, more than I could eat at one meal. 

I wish they would make a version of this scramble with avocado slices on the side and chipotle sauce drizzled on. I would have ordered an iced tea with it, but they seem to serve Gold Peak and I am not a fan at all. 

I ordered and paid with one employee and he was exceptionally polite and efficient, and then the employee who gave me my food was also very nice.",msxc1VlPTD6E-0Kns7bIFw,1,0,5,JCokhWFt3SbQ2OYycfr2gA

4301034,2018-05-23,0,T3C5Mq-QxshN7qH_HPQMpQ,"Went to Jack in Box at El Capitan Way, LV NV ( with Lowes & Del Taco as their ""neighbors"") to get my usual regular tacos. I decided not to do drive thru as most of the time drive thrus take forever. Going in, a couple was ahead of me. While waiting, my eyes roamed around, observing how the crew was working, the cleanliness of the place, etc. Inside the kitchen area there is a counter (near the cashier where they get drive thru payments), where they bag the food items. On it were 4 regular tacos, just sitting there. Didn't mind it much. My order was taken. Knowing orders take a little while, I sat. Then I saw this lady who maybe the manager or supervisor  (wearing gray shirt, black pants & what looks like a headphone) grab those tacos in the counter, bagged them, then gave it to me! Who knows how long they were sitting there?! Didn't say anything; I thought this one is more suitable as a complaint given directly to the company. Didn't eat the tacos; threw them away.
Disappointing, dangerous, very scary! And to think I did so many drive thrus ordering the same item!!
I don't think I'll go back anymore; that's it for me with that place. I'll switch to their ""neighbor"" Del Taco & see how they do.

5050079,2010-10-13,1,T3C5Mq-QxshN7qH_HPQMpQ,"Guilty pleasure-their churros.

It has like a cinammon cream inside. Nothing like biting on a warm churro...thing though it has a tendency to squirt out the cream! Just a warning. I got it on a light colored shirt and stained it. 

Now the big complaint is that if you do late night drive thru- check your bags before driving away. 

We've gone only a few times and they forgot things 3 times maybe out of 5 visits....and somehow it's always what the BF ordered since he orders a few smaller things and I just usually want just a salad and churros.

Also don't assume they put the proper sauces in your bag- he got a appetizer trio and didnt get marinara, ranch or sweet and sour. 

Nothing makes me more irritated than going home and things are missing that you paid for and now theres not enough food. So don't do it to yourself...check it because they're not paying attention at this location.

I should add that they just opened, so hopefully it's just a learning curve and not the usual disposition of the staff here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,2,2,3,1QA_NVeNl0DTlI-HWiNEDQ
5193073,2015-09-17,0,T3C5Mq-QxshN7qH_HPQMpQ,"Been to this location a time or two. When I order tacos no sauce I always get extra sauce instead. When I ask for shakes no topping I tend to get extra whipped cream e as well. I've learned to just not request the omission. Today was the have all be all. I ordered a #3 and two chicken strip kids meals. Some with curly fired. When I got my order there was NO sauce and when I asked if I could have S&S for both my kids chicken strips and buttermilk sauce for our curly fries, I was given one of each to spread between 2 chicken meals and 2 orders of curly fries AFTER I never received the fries in the first place. When they finally gave me the missed fries they were just as burnt and dry as the chicken strips my girls refused to eat.

If that wasn't the kicker, when paying I handed over my credit card and was asked to see ID. It sounded good because when I told the cashier I've never been asked for ID before she explained everyone should be carding. Asking isn't as important as REALLY CHECKING! Just to test the theory I handed over my sisters ID with a totally different last name and picture. The cashier puts the card up aside the ID hands the ID back, then swipes the card. Perfect, now I know they accept credit cards without ID and if they ask for it, they don't confirm the name.",QCGi-M-5vceWRUWwZcGrKA,0,0,2,Vjr9E4JFRJkhliLSZthaRA

I tried calling but there was no answer, and it was 11 pm so I emailed not wanting to go back.
