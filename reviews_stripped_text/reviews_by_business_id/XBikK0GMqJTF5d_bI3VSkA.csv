127715,2012-08-22,0,XBikK0GMqJTF5d_bI3VSkA,"I have frequented some of the other Zabas locations in town, and I was excited when this new location at the Plaza Hotel opened up since it is close to where I work.  

I went there for lunch and was happy to see that the ordering process, menu, and prices were about the same as the other locations. The staff was fast and friendly. Although after ordering my chicken burrito bowl things got odd. 

The first issue I encountered was that they didn't have any fountain drinks, only bottled Pepsi products that cost about $2.50 per bottle. You can go over to one of the neighboring fast food places to get a fountain drink if you want.  With the overpriced bottle of soda, the price of my lunch went up to over $11. 

Then the only seating available are some tipsy and uncomfortable tables and chairs about 50 feet away from the restaurant. While I was sitting there a homeless looking person walks up to my table with a cardboard sign saying that he is stranded and needs money and just stands there about 2 feet away from me and my food waiting for me to give him money.   

Encountering these folks outside the casinos in downtown Las Vegas is pretty commonplace, but inside the Plaza Casino? This person went to the other tables in the area and did the same thing.  The person finally left on his own and I didn't see any security come through.  

I got a very sketchy vibe from that whole experience which will probably prevent me from going back to this particular Zabas or any other restaurant in the Plaza for that matter. It is a shame, I was really looking forward to this place opening.  Although I still give this Zabas three stars for the food being good. But the Plaza really needs to clean up its act.",B6CP8YfIzuKnvSZ_4U1zOw,1,0,3,3ETn2MmyuZfAh_bonYExoQ

I jumped in the line and ordered a chicken rice and cheese burrito and an order of taquitos.  I was not disappointed. The ordering process is similar to a Chipotle or Subway. You pick your ingredients as your going through the line. 
The food was ready fast and the staff was friendly and willing to answer questions about the different sauces and ingredients. The price was on par with the location and food. Give it a shot",utBlxXoHV9NeCedXh9LZ0A,1,0,4,S40kuNPqL5D98ujaEwk5VA
237607,2014-08-14,1,XBikK0GMqJTF5d_bI3VSkA,"The tacos here are pretty delicious. I've had the grilled chicken and the shredded beef, every time I've been here, both were good and tender but very under-salted. They have little salt packets in the checkout area, so you can just add salt-- not too big of a deal. Besides salt, the seasoning is pretty tasty on both meats. I've had the street tacos, crunchy tacos and the nachos. My boyfriend had the beef taquitos; they were small but he thought they were good. The street tacos are tasty, the tortillas are soft and pliable but they didn't fall apart from the filling, although they could have been grilled a bit longer. They weren't the best traditional tacos I've ever had but they weren't terrible either. The crunchy tacos are really, really good. They're nice and crispy and the shell is actually very tasty. The nachos are equally awesome. They don't give much meat so I usually add extra and then it's perfect. The queso is tasty and so are the toppings you can add. The lettuce is always fresh, as are the cilantro and onions. The salsa is also very good. I've never had the mildest salsa but the hottest one and the second hottest are both very good. Their pinto beans aren't great, the juice is very thin and they don't have much flavor. Again, this item needs salt. Overall, the tacos are excellent if you add salt to the meat. They also have PBR on tap so that's pretty awesome. Their service is good, no one is extremely friendly but they're not awful either. Food comes out relatively fast, I will continue coming here and I would definitely recommend this place. Great, quick food and they have pretty good deals like two tacos and a 12 ounce PBR for$3.99.

And they other women talked in Spanish to some women that had her kid running all over.

Aside from your standard chicken, steak, salsas, they have shrimp and fish and from what I can remember as extras they had cilantro and limes! I think for the burrito option, they ask if you'd like the tortilla to be whole wheat or not. It seems they cook the fish to-order so you know you're getting something off the grill which is nice, but might not be a good choice if you want to just grab and go. Zaba's provides a nice alternative in the Plaza if you're not feeling McDonalds or Subway. This place isn't 24 hours like the aforementioned but if it happens to be open while you're here, why not? This is a solid place and their portions are generous enough to make you feel pretty full (granted, I've only had their Zaba bowl).",AetrQWUfAguSAvgcJ8K0CQ,0,0,4,HxycT_EsTjZ3afbPH2E8Cg

I have to say we have walked by this many times in the past with no customers in site so we never tried it. I feel like no one really knows it's back there?! First visit (sorry forgot to take pictures) ordered a shredded beef burrito with white rice, veggies, pico, cheese and sour cream. This was absolutely delicious. The flavors were point on and the burritos are pretty huge. We also tried a fish taco I thought the $4+ was a little steep BUT after having it I would of paid more. That as well, so good and fresh! The fish was flaky and a big piece I was impressed. I ordered the way it was listed on the board and I wouldn't change. Everyday since we tried it just a week ago I had been craving it... so last night made another trip. This time I tried a chicken taco and a beef taco in flour shell (this is what is listed in the picture) on them I added white rice, pico, cheese and sour cream. I also ordered a small side of Guac which will be a must for me now on! I can say as of now the shredded beef is my go to but I'm also a shredded beef lover and this place really makes me love it! Just like the first visit it was same quality and was just as delicious. I agree with other people comments it is much better than Chipotle and seems better priced. They have other items on their menu besides tacos and burritos and I'm pretty excited to try more. So if you're in the mood for fast Mexican where you can see it made right in front of you with a decent price tag you should TRY THIS PLACE!

The fish (Cod) was cooked to perfection and not too greasy or 'fishy'.  Everything tasted pretty fresh and the combo of flavors was really good.

It's like they just didn't give a f..... Asked for wheat she started a regular, questions it then she gave me a wheat tortilla. Didn't ask for lettuce, but I got it anyways. Then she ""wrapped it"" and I get it, these are big burritos, but it was like sloppily throwing a blanket over the ingredients, completely unable to eat it. Bottoms ended up dripping all out and over me. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! I used to live accross the street from Zabas on Durango, this place can't hold a light to that one.

Items are made fresh and the fish is made to order, so I know it's piping hot. Fresh, light and healthy Mexican fare. I look for the freshness and consistency when I'm spending money for lunch everyday and Zabas has it. Pricing consistent with Baja and Chipotle, could be a tad less.

In addition to the extra charge for meat, she insisted we could not have pico AND sauce in our burritos without incurring another extra charge. I didn't even ask about adding corn or onions to my order because I'm not a millionaire, folks!
Price aside, the burrito girl should really have worn a hairnet because I found a hair in one of my last bites. I wonder if there was an extra charge for it?

I'd suggest the Subway next door for a cheaper, hassle free, quick breakfast if you're a fan of fixings and accoutrements.",FEEX7lK47G-sn2o0FdS5FQ,1,0,2,il8zYandoPiKSRDhyKrwjA
