I ordered the lasagna and garlic bread. I was told it would be delivered in 45 min - 1 hour. I called after 1 hour 20 minutes and was told it's on it's way. I finally got it about 10 minutes after I called (1.5 hours after ordering). The lasagna was barely warm, almost cold, and the garlic bread was dry and hard. The soda was cold, which tells me the lasagna sat there for a while before the delivery guy grabbed the soda out of the cooler and brought it to me. I ate it because it was late and I didn't want to go anywhere. The next day, I was sick to my stomach and spent most of the day in the restroom.",d5amwjWJVTwFnqP8RVhj-Q,10,1,1,avPWtEhqRLIcxqBdEhk0bA

So they said delivery was going to take 30 mins so about a hour and a half goes by and I get my food and I open the wings and I have 12 wings so just by doing the math 12 wings wouldn't add up to 3 pounds unless I'm stupid.  The pizzia was the most greasy dirt of pizza I've ever had I called the uneducated  manager and he said he didn't make the menu and starting cussing at me. The smart choice here is insted of sending 30 bucks and cafe verdi call your closest napolies pizza and get good food.,mRYuyqenV67UvWsajHYkIg,6,1,1,TSt-5W9IsvVDU5IGw2lwig

Like cmon dude my fries are cold and you didn't even bring the right pop! So again I got hungry and thought I'd try my luck. The wait time again is an hour an a half. This time once the time was up my boyfriend called and inquired on our order which was supposed to be "" en route"". Not even five minutes after my boyfriend got off the phone my driver calls me and tells me he's just not leaving and it's going to be 20 mins to get to me.

The least you guys could do is let me know in advance you guys were short handed and once again it's always better to call your customer first, then for them to call you!

We ordered the pickup special and a fettuccine Alfredo. The pizza was good, and only $5. The fettuccine however was overcooked, bland,  looked old, had zero protein whatsoever and costs almost $10 after tax!! There is more sustenance in HALF of the pizza I ordered.  When i complained the lady looked at me and said ""it's been that way for years, and your the first person to complain."" Riigghhht.

I visit Las Vegas often, very often, for two reasons, one is for friends, the second being Caf Verdi. I accidentally found them when ordering in after arriving in the middle of the night once. The guy said sure they deliver and we ordered Pizza and a Philly. Well the delivery guy couldn't find the hotel and then couldn't find the room, but we did finally get the order, unfortunately it was cold and an hour late, but even so, what I tasted was bliss. Going to the caf the very next day we ordered it again, fresh this time and it was ecstasy. The weird thing is that their Philly Cheese Steak it not quite a real Philly, it is a weird Las Vegas Mediterranean version of one that is just fantastically delicious. If you go to Las Vegas and like Philly Cheese Steak, Caf Verdi is a must.

My boyfriend and I had order from them one night ( the lasagna meal for two) and the meal was a 7 1/2 out of 10 for us - the garlic bread arrived soggy but the lasagna was pretty good. We decided to eat there again but dine in this time, no one was there - but there phones were ringing constantly. It's obvious they make their money from people ordering around campus & because they're 24/7. It can't be the food because that night we dine in I had felt nausea; but this is something I deal with almost all they time so I thought it was just me. We were up late once again and decided to go back to Cafe Verdi for the same meal, arrived again no one was there. The phones would NOT stop ringing and I thought it was a good thing for business, I would be happy that it's a busy night. The lady who works there was complaining and so was almost everyone else besides a bald white guy. Our food was brought out, customers actually started coming in to dine in - I cut my meal short and took everything to go because their vibes were killing mine. They were so pissed that the phone wouldn't stop ringing and it was becoming a bummer - I felt as if they were ungrateful. Anyways, late at night my stomach once again started turning and twisting about 20 mins into it I ran into the bathroom and threw up everything I had for the WHOLE day. It was terrible, I knew it was their food AGAIN; my boyfriend felt nausea as well so it wasn't just me. We were disappointed and decided that we will never support Cafe Verdi again. The food was most likely under-cook due to them rushing and having bad attitudes about their jobs; if you hate your job QUIT it. BAD FOOD - BAD SERVICE!

When an hour came and still no food, I realized I should check this place on my map. It was a 20 min drive away and there was construction in between in a lot of areas, oops. (I recommend checking traffic before ordering delivery.)
So I was expecting my food to be in really poor condition especially with all these negative comments. 
I'm not gonna lie, when I got my food it smelt terrible. I'm pretty sure that's because of the hot pickle.. Naturally the fries were soggy, so I was worried my burger would be too. First I took of my wilted lettuce, then I took a bite. It was amazing!
Maybe because I was starving, maybe because I was expecting it to be soggy and sickening, but it was wonderfully crispy and the flavors were really great! Then I checked the chicken fingers, I was also expecting them to be soggy like the fries were, and yet again I was happily surprised! The weren't soggy at all, in fact they were perfectly crispy.

Chicken: Barely warm at all, hard, overcooked, tasteless, and under-seasoned.
Waffles: Overly sweet, really small, and cold to the touch, as if they had been in the cooler. Soggy to boot. Lucky I just got a toaster that is big enough for waffles. My old one wasn't.
Chocolate Eclaire: Was upside-down in the box, so all the chocolate stuck to the styrofoam. So now my Chocolate Eclaire is just an eclaire. Filling is not pastry creme but some weird, whipped, sickly sweet, artificially colored mess.
Sauces: Bleu Cheese was just Ranch with tiny bits of mystery cheese in it. Buffalo sauce was missing entirely, so I had to make my own.
Tiramisu: Tasty enough but definitely not authentic. Not made fresh but purchased elsewhere, I know because several other restaurants in the area sell the same mediocre tiramisu, plus it was still frozen in the middle.

We ordered a variety of things from the menu. My coworker Bridgette and I decided t go splitsies on a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. The pizza was great in our opinions. The onions were sweet which was a nice offset to the mild spiciness of the Buffalo sauce (personally I would have liked to have had more of the Buffalo sauce, but the amount there was perfectly acceptable). The crust is plain in general with no pizzazz or distinct flavor. For a CHICKEN pizza there was a lot of bacon and the ricotta cheese was a nice compliment to the dish as a whole but not necessary. In the end we both went back for seconds and I would recommend it.
We also ordered Jalapeno Poppers considering we are all fans of the classic BBQ side. The taste was 'good' but it lacked the spice we look forward to as a group. In my opinion they were a bit cold, but that was probably due to the wait time. All in all, not bad and we would recommend for flavor but not for spice.
On top of that we ordered Mozzarella Sticks. There is nothing defining about them as they are your run of the mill freezer appetizer but notably the marinara sauce was thin and oily which was disappointing and kind of gross. I would not recommend if you are picky.
My coworker ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs; he enjoyed the pasta, and the sauce was 'soupy' he can be quoted as saying ""the meatballs taste frozen and processed"" and he would not recommend it to a perspective customer.
My boss ordered the Steak Calzone Everything - no mushrooms. He can be quoted as saying the calzone was ""decent"" but he gives it two thumbs up.... This inconsistency in enthusiasm is probably due to his personality but I digress. He would ""definitely recommend"" it to a perspective customer.
Lastly I ordered cheesecake being the resident sweet tooth of the office and am sorry to say I was disappointed. I was looking forward to a great slice of dessert and what I got was pre packaged and frozen. After it defrosted the taste was mediocre.
All in all a lot of the food came off as frozen and not fresh but it's still edible and of average quality.",havOgrlfWYoKQwGtBS7anQ,0,0,2,sLKRYo5p5aTk7DqSviQHjA

The mushrooms were fried just right; the mozzarella sticks were oozing cheese; the poppers were spicy; onion rings were just okay; my only complaint with the platter is the fried zucchini - it was very mushy and I couldn't eat more than one, but my puppy loved them!

Got one of there flyer's on the door and decided we were desperate enough to try this place for their spaghetti, meatballs and pizza. Boy, what a mistake!!!!

It was cold, extremely dry, flavorless, the noodles were dried out like they were cooked yesterday. In their menu it states they ""only use the finest quality imported pasta"". BULL $HIT. If they did, they imported it cooked already. Now for the meatballs, low grade hamburger meat cooked in grease with absolutely, I mean absolutely no seasoning or flavoring and small, way to small for the price of them. The pizza was dry, crust was hard as a rock, cold and the pizza smelled & tasted like one of those frozen pizzas you get from the supermarket. The toppings besides the pepperoni was sparse, a light sprinkling of about a half a hand full for a 24"" pie. And guess what the soda that came with the meal was warm. Warmer then the pizza and spaghetti. We called back to get a refund, and the manager (or some flunkie with a fake foreign accent (wasn't quite Italian, maybe Greek)) gives us a bunch of lip about how their food is cooked fresh. After about 10 minutes of bickering back and forth, the ""manager"" claimed that all his food is frozen. Gee, hence the freezer taste of everything. We finally had to drive to their location and surrender our food (which was fine, it was stinking up the house) and got a refund. YUCK YUCK YUCK with a serving of YUCK.
