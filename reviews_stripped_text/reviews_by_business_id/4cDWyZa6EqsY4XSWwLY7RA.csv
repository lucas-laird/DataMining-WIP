Go Raw Cafe will change your mind.  My husband (the pickiest of eaters and I can safely say a vegetarian junk foodie) and I both LOVED the food here, we were just shocked that it was all raw.

Try the Mexican sampler plate or the International Sampler plate to get an idea of what you like.  Of course, you could go to the salad bar, but it's just salad.  Let them cook.. erm, prepare for you!  The chili was also just amazing, full of beans and almost a curry finish.

The gentleman working the cash register was incredibly nice and helpful.  There are a bunch of cookbooks to check out while waiting (I ended up buying two, I'm a believer!) and of course, some pretty tasty desserts.",UccZtdL8a6HdEhnfpaOhkg,2,1,5,fqR_Q8LGxJfllVkUzC0xCA

This place has really improved over the years, as far as the variety of food and recipes go!

I brought a non-raw friend and he was fighting me over my italian sampler plate. The zuchinni spaghetti was amazing!!! It tasted better than the real thing and better than I can make at home.

On another recent trip I got the sushi. The serving was so big it lasted me two meals.

And can't forget their hamburgers! (raw food vegan but taste better than the real thing!). Whenever I a craving an unhealthy burger I hurry up and get down here right away! Their hamburgers are so good it always does the trick. The bun is made of dehydrated sprouted grain bread. When you have condiments that are real food - the flavors are so much more intense.

If you are looking for some of the raw prepared packaged foods like raw chips and tortillas they are a few dollars cheaper here than they are at whole foods.

They have a few shelves of pre-packaged raw fooda, supplements, and drinks like kombucha.

They have a great raw food salad bar that always has lot of unique variety like raw dressings, soups, and tropical fruit. 

They make fresh vegetable juices and smoothies, with optional superfood supplements.

There is a large selection of books on nutrition and raw food.

They sometimes have raw desserts like cheesecake that are to die for.

It was pretty good and a healthy alternative to the fast food options nearby. Also, they are really fast compared to other juice bars I've visited. My only gripe is with the service. Never really that friendly or engaging. On my last visit they wouldn't let me pay with debit, I guess the machine was busted. So, I paid with cash, received no receipt, and realised after getting in my car and heading to work that they had charged me $11 for one juice, twice the actual price. Kicking myself for not speaking up when I thought it sounded high. I will probably still pop in for a juice once in a while, because at the end of the day you go for the product.

913122,2010-08-30,0,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"While I was planning a week long business trip to Vegas, I tried to find healthy vegetarian restaurants in advance and came across this restaurant.  The high prices didn't bother me because my company was paying for it, but it was the service that ruined it for me.  For starters, there were 2 or 3 ladies there who barely spoke english and it took them a while to come to the register to greet me.  So I order 1 enchilada $8.80) and a 2 oz shot of wheat grass (menu said $1.80 for 1 oz and $3 for 2 oz).  I went to pay and the lady told me to eat and pay later in case I want to buy something else.  So I eat my enchilada, drink my wheatgrass, and go up to pay and it was $16 and some change!  I asked why it was so much (not that I REALLY cared, haha) and she said $8.80 for the enchilada and $6 for 2 oz of wheatgrass.  Apparently they have ""updated"" prices on the wall in an inconspicuous area and the prices on the menu are no longer valid.  It made no reference to the updated prices on the menu and the sign with the wheatgrass price didn't make reference to it being an ""updated"" price.  After a couple of minutes back and forth and the cashier telling me that her owner wasn't there and that I needed to pay $6 for the wheatgrass.  It ended with me paying her $3 and giving her my phone number so the owner can call me if he dares to try to dispute this.  This started out as a place where I planned on eating lunch every day during this trip, and now it's a place that I have no plan on ever revisiting.  

Side note:  I went to get a smoothie at Tropical Smoothie Cafe after I left (because I didn't want to pay (have my company pay) the $8 they were asking for a smoothie, and they had 2 oz of wheatgrass for $2.75.",Id-uSf_hrHpj6hVCDPjfog,5,0,1,tsnvEv-rprgSNY7jRhARjg

The food wasn't the problem, it was the older gentleman that works there. He came to the table to ask us how the food was, we told him it was fine. But then he tried to convince me to spray some kind of salt spray on my food to try it out.(There are bottles of this spray on all the tables) I'm not a big salt person so I said ""No, thank you, it's just great the way it is."" He pushed even more for me to try it. I just wanted to enjoy my food and have my conversation with my friend. After I told him very nicely that I wasn't interested in trying it, he mumbled a bunch of stuff. The only thing I made out clearly was ""I guess you're going to eat your food the way YOU WANT to, that's fine."" Which I found incredibly rude. There was a lady about 1 feet away waiting for a juice she ordered who saw and heard the whole thing. She gave me a ""what was that about"" kind of look.

963952,2011-12-16,1,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"Stopped in here the other day and had a lovely experience. I was feeling under the weather with the beginnings of a cold / funk. The kindness and care I received was second to none. While this cafe specializes in raw, I wanted some hot food and they suggested the cooked vegetable curry soup. It was a generous portion and seemed nutritionally balanced with brown rice, veggies, and legumes. Warming and delicious, just what I needed in a vegan comfort food. We all need different nutrition at times, so I really appreciated the cooked option.

I also let the waitstaff recommend a juice to boost my immune system with a little spice to help clear my head cold. The tomato-spicy one was delicious and pure, just enough cayenne heat. The flavors were really well balanced.

While the ambiance is not exactly warm and fuzzy -- it has more of a supplements store or grocery feeling -- the people are wonderful, the food is pure, and I was filled with gratitude that we have such great options for vegan and vegetarian / pure food in Las Vegas.

I think a lot of heart goes into this business! The pricing seems reasonable when you think about the volume of fresh / pure ingredients they have to source, and how food prices have been going up. Of course being mostly raw, the food is different and the textures and temperatures may not be what people expect if they are coming from the standard american diet, but I recommend giving it a try, perhaps in stages.

While I focus on juices, they also have smoothies and prepared dishes. This is a raw food focused establishment (hence the title). They offer steamed vegetables in the hot bar along with soups and brown rice, but I believe those are the only selections that are cooked at Go Raw Cafe.  Don't discount them if you are a carnivore. This is simply a place to come and get healthy, whole foods. No matter what food plan you are following, we can all agree that getting more raw vegetables in our diet is a good thing. Come and try out the salad bar and grab a raw food cookbook. On Saturdays and some Sundays there is a jazz flutist. You read the right, a jazz flutists. His beautiful music just adds to the ambiance of the place.

Plus for just 3 ingredients it was like $6-8 for such a small size. And I understand juicing isn't the cheapest, but I've gone to other places with better juice recipes for better value. Well, despite the pricing, I gave it a shot. I wasn't too sure which to select so I asked the man at the register for some advise between two of the drinks and he has no idea what to tell me. He had to look at the menu and all he did was repeat the ingredients each drink had (which was no help cos I obviously already read their ingredients) so I just went ahead and ordered the Body Cleanser juice and it was only okay.

2441004,2014-05-18,5,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"disclaimer to start: I have been to quite a few raw/live restaurants. (wooohoo!) And DEF a ton of vegan ones. As that is my lifestyle. Not to mention the fact that as a part of my business, people pay me to create healthy recipes. Not only for people personally, but cookbooks, blogs, etc...including raw.   I have  even taught people how they can prepare delicious raw & vegan food at home in a class format.

On that note:
We were excited to check this place out and taste another fun take on raw amazingness.  And sadly, from the moment the cashier opened her mouth the tone was set, it seemed. She was flippant & rude... especially when we asked to get almond ""cheese"" on 1 side of the ""pizza"".  The man and I both wanted to try and I am not a fan of nut cheeses. (or fake cheeses in general... or fake meat. For me... it freaks me out that something is not being what it truly is. I could prob say that's how I feel about fake people too! haha!)  That brings me perfectly into my biggest point...

Technically ""raw"" is anything under 119 degrees... SO, you could potentially  have warmed items that still maintain the delicious nutrients that all raw food offers. AND--- our fav places in LA do this.  For example... the biscuits and gravy do not come out ice cold. Same as their pizza. 

The pizza was ice cold. And apparently every thing they serve is that temp. Or room temp. That really turned me off. I really don't know any time I would say... ohhh, I am totally craving a cold enchilada. I spoke with what seemed to be the owner to ask a few questions and of course... he was offended and will prob reply to this post. But alas... I am hoping it causes him to re-evaluate the temp? the service? As I know it is probably super easy to not have any worry regarding temperature.  The Buckwheat bread it came on was great! BUT--- we could've driven to whole foods and bought the same bread ourselves and assembled our cold dish at home. (especially with the price point so high)

The menu also said it came with ""walnut sausage"". Throwing small pieces of walnut on a cold piece of bread does not a sausage make. Another one of our fav places at home has an incredible walnut sausage... that is a delectable mix and packed with flavor... not just the walnut.

Which brings me to ANOTHER item on the menu they call ""fries"".... we were like... cool! Let's see the fun spin on ""fries"" done raw. Come to find out these are merely avocado slices. Just. Avocado. I LOVE avocado. If you say it's avocado. But don't tell me it's fries.

SO---  in a nutshell---
the flavors were actually quite good. 
BUT--- I could buy at the store and assemble at home. (was hoping they built more ingredients in house, especially with the price) 
Don't tell me things are NOT what they actually are. ""walnut sausage pizza"" is not cold store-bought bread with nuts on top. Fries are NOT avocado. And please make a disclaimer somewhere.... ANY where on the menu that says all of our food is served cold or at room temperature. (I know its a RAW place... but I know RAW... and it doesn't have to always be cold or room temp.)  then, we would know what to expect and probably really truly enjoy our experience.

Let me start with the good the female  working the counter was very friendly and welcoming after I told her it was my first visit. She suggested juice ( Green Zing- granny smith apples, lemon, ginger) based off my bitter/tart palate I described to her. 

I ordered the green zing and the gimme the beet 'cheese"" burger with a house salad. 

The juice was made rather quickly.  I was really looking forward to it. Tasted like motor oil and was ""luke cold"" pretty disappointing start to my first experience but no biggie. 

The beet burger came out and I really enjoy veggie burgers especially house made.  The ""living bread""  it came on had the thickness and consistency of beef jerky but tasted like tree bark. The beet burger itself was only slight less disgusting.  I  came into raw very hungry so for me to say it was terrible is mostly shocking to myself. 

The house salad was the best part as it was mixed greens kale and a flax seed oil garlic dressing that was just OK and that's rounding up a bit. The salad was by far the best part of  and otherwise awful meal.  I ate the entire  meals as I was hungry. After eating I was literately turned off by the thought of more food even if I went  next door to get a slice of pizza. 

They do not refrigerate or cool  or heat items to keep with the ""raw"" theme. That didn't seem like a big deal to me but only added to the awful tasting tree bark flavored meal I just ate. I like the concept of ""raw"" and natural yet they put to go items in plastic bags, plastic cups that are not made of corn or anything sustainable or green.  They have bottled juices and vitamins in a refrigerator as you walk in but then everything tastes ""luke cold"" as if nothing is refrigerated that you order.

I wouldn't wish Go Raw on my worst enemy. If anyone wants a free  get juiced card with a stamp on it, it's all yours.   Skip it  and thank  me for saving your taste buds later.",40m0541Z_KexYkdvvqHJIQ,14,6,2,0e3qaTpi_CB-6q1NSdDKQg

So I said ""Uh I'll try the Salmon Roll"" and she says ""Sold out"" Okay uhmmmm...""the Veggie Roll?"" and she replies ""No, out of Seaweed"" Dang okay...then I start looking at the menu again and I hear her let out a heavy breathe. Wow! How Rude! Then I saw the ""Salmon"" Cakes w/ ""Fries"" & Veggies $15: ""tartar sauce"" accompanied by garlic flat ""bread"", House Veggies, & your choice of avocado ""fries"", or jicama ""fries"". and my boyfriend orders the Blood Transfusion $8.50: 2 oz. Wheatgrass & Coconut Water. She rings it up, we pay and then she walks back to sit with the guy she was talking to so we sat down. My boyfriend told me he was planning to get something to eat also but didn't want to deal with the rude lady. By that time we kind of already lost our appetite. Trying the food, the veggies were very good, nice and fresh and I also liked the avocado fries. I never received the garlic flatbread and as for the Mock Salmon, it was extremely sour and kind of smelled a bit rank. I finished the veggies and avocado but left most of the mock salmon. My boyfriend's drink was really good but I mean it really was just coconut water and wheatgrass, you can't really mess that up. 
Overall, I would want to come back to try different items on their menu but the really bad service just kind of turned me away from this place for a while.",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,24,6,2,X2R2kSYOpAe1u_mpJgywJA

My quest started while I was still living in Manhattan so there was no shortage of great vegetarian and vegan places to try. Fast forward to me moving back to Vegas. Sheesh....no wonder everybody is a little chunkier here! 
I wanted really badly to love the Go Raw Cafe. It's close to home, it's on my way home from the gym and I've been digging trying different foods. Hell even the reviews on Yelp seemed good. 
My wife and I popped in today for lunch. I had the ""Gimme the beet cheeseburger and fries and she had a small salad she served herself from the salad bar. The place overall is very plain and casual. Looks like a small market with a couple tables to sit and eat. Nothing special or noteworthy. My ""burger"" was ok and definitely different. My wife said the salad bar ingredients seemed fresh. The part that makes this place hard to visit again is those 2 items with no beverages came to $22! Now I'm all for paying a little extra for good ingredients and ambiance. I really don't think this place is worth the cost. The one employee I had contact with was very solemn and automatic. I saw they had iced mochas on the menu for $7.88 and smoothies were about the same. Really? You thought Starbucks was rough! No amount of ""hip"" or ""fresh"" or ""healthy"" is going to convince me that I should pay you close to $10 after tax and tip for a coffee. It's really a shame because places like this need to exist and grow but with this economy and those prices and inconvenience (no drive thru or late hours), I hardly doubt they will. Take 40% off those prices and put a smile on your face when a new customer walks in the door....then we will talk.",nwvnNIixvyYTg4JS8g3Xgg,3,1,2,wT3NiQ8Da34wJZQcYpncGg

I walked in and the woman behind the counter might have grunted a greeting or maybe she just glared at me.
The place looks like all the skanky vegetarian places that were in Santa Cruz, CA when vegetarians were always skanky hippies with questionable hygiene. I thought vegetarians had come a long ways from then. Vegan food can be exciting and palette pleasing. It doesn't have to be depressing.
It didn't smell good in Go Raw. I'm not sure if I'd say it smelled bad, but it just reminded me of the yucky hippy places of my college days.
I did the ""salad bar"" for $9/lb. I took small helpings of most everything.
The cilantro salad dressing was like an acid bath on my tongue. *shiver* Thankfully I hadn't put much on. But it  was like Go Raw VINEGAR!
I had some stews that didn't seem raw...and they were warm. They were okay. Nothing exceptional. Some yam dish. Some other undescribable dishes too.
I left feeling hungry and slightly grossed out. There was nothing in particular that grossed me out so I don't know why I felt so yucky.
When I eat vegan food at a place like Native Foods in Costa Mesa, CA, I leave feeling like I've filled my body with awesome. But I left Go Raw feeling like I'd just filled my body with yuck.
I wouldn't return.
OTOH, it looks like most of you are loving it, so maybe it's just me.

I have never eaten here and the hubs and I are on a quest to eat at every healthy spot in  town to discover all the hidden gems. So I was super pumped thinking  I might be discovering a potential new favorite place. 

The ambiance is organic, there are healthy books and naturals that you can pick up while your there, not a huge selection but they offer some. I noticed that they have a salad bar and it looked delicious and fresh, but because I can get a salad anywhere I wanted to hit that menu. 

I went for the ""cheese burger w/fries"" and my hubby had the wrap; however we experienced a problem while we were paying. The lady at the register ran my husbands card twice and it generated a ""transaction failed"" so I used my card and it went through. My husband checked our account to ensure it didn't go through and it actually charged twice. We had to call the bank to verify it did . We told the lady that the machine actually did charge my husbands card, and she began to argue but not so much in an argumentative tone but with a ""that's not possible because the receipt says failed'' tone. It was really hard to make her understand, I told her it says that but the bank says that it actually did go through. So we dealt with that which wasn't a great way to start our first visit but it was resolved and by the time we were done, I was kinda over it. 

 The ""burger"" was good, didn't lack flavor , but I feel like something was missing from it, that there could have been another component added to tie it together but at that point I wasn't sure what it was. My husband was a little upset that the collard green that was used for the wrap wasn't deveined, he ended up just peeling it off and eating just the insides. We both ordered a smoothie, which was good but not the best smoothie I've ever had and in fact I could make the same one at home, and better.  I may try this place again, but it didn't stand out that I am willing to make the trip from my house across town to eat here again.

3590967,2016-01-11,2,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"Got some take out here yesterday since Happy Cow told me that it was the closest vegan place to where we were running errands at. It's in a little shopping center like most places in Vegas & it was pretty easy to find. 

I'm a vegetarian who is about 80-90% vegan when it comes to cooking at home but I have never had raw foods at a restaurant. By definition I didn't really know what a raw foods lifestyle was, I only had a generalized idea. After coming here I did some research & realized that it's that & some more. Long story short raw foods is about eating unrefined whole foods in their natural state for better health as heating food takes away from the nutritional value of fruits/veggies. Anyway I learned that it's not as crazy as society makes it out to be it's just about creating meals like any other but getting the full benefit from the plants. 

As a first timer here I was a little confused when I walked in. There was a lady sitting at one of the tables, I didn't put two & two together that she worked there at first since when we came in she didn't greet us or anything. I looked at the wall which had a juice menu but not food, turns out they have paper menus by the cashier which I took home for future reference. The lady noticed we seemed confused so she helped us with that. She was nice, just a bit reserved, she explained some of the dishes to us & I appreciated that. 

There are a lot of options for juice & food. They also have a salad bar. No pictures on the menus which is usually how I like to decide because I'm very visual & I can tell immediately what I'm going to like by looking at it. Being offered so many options is nice but having to read through them frustrates me a little. It is a plus that I could take the menu home though, at least in the future I can read comfortably & know what I want for the next time. 

The half size is good if you're a small gal like me & can't put away too much. It's a decent sized meal & I was super full at the end of it. We ordered a half size of enchiladas & a half size of vegi-cotti since they were sold out of lasagna. Both were very good & not over bearing on flavor, just right. The enchiladas were so satisfying & I loved the guac & dips on the side. The veg-cotti was really good too, the only downfall was that it stunk super bad of what I think was garlic. Our car ride home was a little tough lol but stinky-ness aside it was yummy. Price is a bit high which I can expect when eating out but overall I see myself coming back since the food was great, especially the enchiladas. I would like to try other items in the future & perhaps even visit the other location by the Lakes. It also inspired me to attempt more raw meals at home as well. Thumbs up & will def be back. 

Oh forgot to mention! - They sell some raw snacks, tons of vegan supplements, & cookbooks too which is nice.",rx6TW2QmrfImGX0dvLyPQg,2,2,4,4IB1LriH4Ar7_bxiI50urg

We split a house salad with the house dressing and the Mexi-Sampler plate.  My friend also had some sort of smoothie that I think had beets in it.  I ordered water - I really wanted a Diet Coke but was afraid to ask for it, lol, so I settled for water.

The salad was possibly the best salad I have ever had!  It consisted of mixed greens, tomatoes, onions, avocadoes, sprouts (I usually hate sprouts), and walnuts.  I'm not sure what was in the dressing but it was delish.

The mexi-plate was also very good.  I think my friend said a couple things were a little spicy but she's a ""Gringa"" so take that with a grain of salt.  She also really enjoyed her smoothie/juice thing.

I left feeling full but not lethargic - I will attribute that to eating raw and wish I had the discipline to eat that way.  However, my family would revolt at the thought!

It's a little pricey but I'm willing to pay more for good, wholesome, healthy food.

The burger was great. Filling, and fresh. The ""fries"" on the side were slices of avocado (yes, please) dusted with some kind of magic raw fairy powder that made me forget all about their fried and very long distant cousin the french fry.

A bottle of water for the road and a wheat grass shot came to $25. I know it's raw. I know it's fresh, but that's still a little too pricey for what I had.

I ordered the veggie wrap, which had avocado, sprouts, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, and a nut paste in a kale wrap.

However, I took the rest home to my husband, who is even more of a meat-eater, and he couldn't believe how good it was either.

As part of my yearly Lent (Latin: Quadragesima - English: Fortieth) I like to give up meat for the 40 days of fasting. Las Vegas does not have many places that cater to the flexitarian or no-meat eaters. So it was some what difficult to find a place.

The place I went to was GO RAW CAFE. I was craving a beet juice due to all the  sun exposure from all the bike riding around Hoover Dam. I felt a tinging from perhaps the onset of a sun blister. Beet juice for sun blister is the way to go, since beetroot has lots of the amino acid, lysine. 


The place is not the best, and not the worst. It had what I was looking for..raw juice. They were limited on the vegetables and fruits they carry. Guess I'm spoiled with the juice places found in Los Angeles (Pico-Union neighborhood), and Bedford Stuyvesant, Bushwick (Mr. Kiwis)  In addition, they sell books on juicing and other supplements.",IhMKAIVDxCyfn3eVaeSqAA,0,0,3,rLPj1rgd61u91KEB8DOx2Q

The only thing we had to try to control the fizz were some paper napkins, which didn't impress the staff too much. Sorry - but we had to protect our laps from bubbling mango soda!

We shared the chips and salsa - which was fine. The salsa was really good and fresh, but there was only about three tablespoons of it. And the flax chips were OK, just a little thick and soy tasting.

We then got the vegetable sushi, which was quite good. A large serving of a maki-like entree, except without rice or fish. It basically tasted like a delicious mouthful of vegetables that I wouldn't have tried without some outside encouragement. I mean, I never thought I would truly enjoy raw enoki mushrooms.

My friends got the portabella wrap and beet-cheese burger. The wrap was ok - very salty marinated mushrooms and 'almond cheese' wrapped in some raw chard. The burger was slightly better - tasting very much like nutmeat and also served with a generous helping of 'cheese.' The salad that came with the burger was large and really, really good.

We did add salt and pepper to everything, though. Generously.

All in all, I would recommend this place if you want to get out of the unhealthy eating-out lifestyle. The food is more of an experience than some omnivores might be up for, so keep that in mind when planning a night out.

And don't use more than one napkin!",D1_-n5rmdurJ5l-L2hzqmA,1,0,3,ik_d5wSVX54k62DWry-IVw

5231972,2008-09-04,7,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"NOTE: I am a major carnivore. I hate veggies and health food makes me squeamish. Keep this in mind.

I found the food here.. well kind of gross. We got 2 sampler platters and honestly all the food tasted the same! I realize maybe my palette isn't ""refined"" enough to tell the difference between fake lasagna and fake enchiladas, but seriously the food was all so similar and boring. Props to the people who can stand to eat this stuff all the time.. it takes some ridiculous will power.

As someone with a degree in the biological sciences I think the concept of raw food is completely unfounded and ridiculous... but I have to appreciate that there are others that disagree with me despite the overwhelming lack of true scientific evidence in their favor. Our bodies create their own enzymes, there is nothing wrong with this. There isn't an advantage to eating enzymes, and plant enzymes don't help your body perform better or even aid in human digestion.

Ok anyways, not to start a heated vegan debate here, but I can say 2 facts about eating there. 1. The food is PRICEY. Seriously we're talking $8.88 for a smoothie.. WHAT? I guess ""quality"" is expensive, whatever. 2. I have felt sick for the 12 hours since eating this so called food. I know it takes awhile to get used to raw food, and the first time you feel ill or something, but I don't very much enjoy feeling ill after eating ""healthy"" food. I don't get it. 

Advice to carnivores.. this place isn't for you (ok duh, that wasn't very helpful). If you're feeling adventurous like I was, good for you, but be warned that our stomachs aren't made to handle this ""living"" food and you might not be happy after eating there!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,6,3,2,tn_SKXRZ0jgfcB_BUPzAcg

5250915,2012-07-01,0,4cDWyZa6EqsY4XSWwLY7RA,"Finally tried this place and I found it very tasty. I've been experimenting with eating more raw foods so, this place has been on my radar even more. I'm not sure that any person would love this cafe but if you're a vegetarian, or interested in having a healthy meal to accent your regular SAD (standard american diet), I think you would like this place.

I arrived early and noticed they only had very small (for my liking-15 ounces) bottled waters, I walked over to Smiths to buy a large water for a fraction of what they were selling theirs (didnt even check their prices). I had my own water canteen/bottle, so just filled that up and walked back to meet my friends for lunch.

We chatted at a table and perused the menu. I order the vegi-cotti. I chose this because it came with a side of their pasta primavera so, I could try two dishes at once. Both were yummy. I ate one vegi-cotti and half the portion of pasta primavera and took the other vegi-cotti and remaining past home. It was a very generous portion but it should be given the price of $13.88.

The PP was strips of zucchini, the shape of thicker linguine. The sauce was a very tasty tomatoey sauce. The vegi-cotti was their in house Italian veggie mixture (including basil and parsley) cut very small so it was easy to eat, as it was stuffed in one of their sprouted flat breads (kinda looks like a thick darker tortilla). My recommendation, eat the entire portion at the restaurant. The leftovers, while still tasty, the sprouted bread had a crunchier or firmer consistency when newly prepared. The left overs were a bit soggier but, still tasty.

My friends (have been to Go Raw before-this one and the Sahara location) shared the Mediterranean Pizza and the Enchiladas. They said both were very good.

Food is good and fresh. Prices are high. And, I think for these prices they should have some cold tap water in pitchers with lemons or cucumber.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,1,1,4,77bUWCWfSD2XFv4QGJFXZQ

From the menu - house salad | kale salad with cilantro dressing. Those are in the current rotation. I was stuck on the Beet Burger and the Mexicali Pizza for years - those are great too. The new coffee cream dessert in the fridge is one of my all time favorite desserts. It is up there with the raw mint chocolate chip ice cream I had at Pure Food and Wine in NYC.

The salad bar is small, but all I need. The fresh cut fruit (esp the pineapple is always phenomenal.)

The food is the other part of the fun: great-tasting raw entrees  such as enchiladas, pizza and sushi - my three favorites.   At this location there is a salad bar, which is an excellent way to sample some raw foods in small doses if you are new to eating this way.   The juices and deserts are heavenly!

I have ordered the veggie wrap all three times, & the full order is definitely more than filling.
