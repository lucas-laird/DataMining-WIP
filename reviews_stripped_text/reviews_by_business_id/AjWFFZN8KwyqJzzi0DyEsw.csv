The meat is really juicy and flavorful, and what really makes the burger is the homemade bun (I had the Parmesan). The waffle fries were cooked really well, too. Not sure if it's the best place to really watch sports, though; the TVs are rather small.

Also it's part of Bally's now, not Paris, and it's branded a ""sports grille.""  This is my first time here so I don't know what it was before.

I had the bleu cheese burger and it was excellent.  My wife ordered the barbecue chicken burger.  The kitchen ran out of barbecue sauce and substituted some barbecue aioli which she didn't like. I didn't think it was cool to do a substitution without checking with us first. Glad she doesn't have an allergy...

The fries were good but at the end of the day they were just fries.

25 mins after being seated we got our waters that we asked for AFTER people who got seated after us and who ordered cocktails. Yes, they delivered paid drinks before free drinks. That's how they roll. The guy blamed his bus boy. Way to rip on the place you work.

Food came out around 10:20pm. Honestly, the food was decent. I enjoyed every bite of my L'American burger and fries. When he dropped it off, the wiater said ""I'll be right back with more waters."" They never came.

An older couple next to us complained to the same wiater about wait times and asked for a full refund on their check. He got a manager and they talked for a bit and got their refund. We didn't want to be a harsh because the waiter is just doing his job. It's the managers fault for overbooking the place.

We straight up told him we didn't want to tip because of the awful experience, but that we'd pay for the great food.

If they're busy, don't eat here. If they add you to a list to be seated, go somewhere else. If they're quiet inside then I'd recommend the food. We expected to be in and out withing 30-45 mins to get our night on in Vegas.

But the FRIES, both waffle and ""shoestring"" fries which are really not thin enough to call shoestring, are both frozen Albertson's french fries, I've tasted them before, there's no mistaking.  Really poor quality french fries for the price you pay to eat here.  You get better french fries at a Denny's.

If you've heard of BLT burger in Mirage, or LBS at Red Rock, and thought this would be a similar upscale burger joint, you are as mistaken as I was.

124293,2012-02-05,0,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"A little over a year ago Burger Boy and I went on a burger eating binge across Las Vegas, and were able to check off most of the locations we wanted. One of them that we didn't get to, and one that took me over a year to get back to, is Le Burger Brasserie at the Paris. It's a location that seems to fly well under the radar of burger enthusiasts in town as I never hear about it, and the few times I've brought it up in conversation no one seems to know what I'm talking about. And even though it's a strip location and not the hidden local gem I'm searching for, this place is still an unknown that I'm glad to have discovered.

The restaurant is located in a strange transitional connector area between the Paris and Bally's amidst a few retail stores and other touristy junk. The venue is billed as a 'Sports Grille', but due to the lack of sports events going on the night I was there I didn't really get that feel, but instead it just felt more like a typical touristy strip restaurant. Not that this is a negative, just wasn't all that fancy or unique of an interior.

The menu is French themed as one would expect, with your typical offerings of sliders, salads, entrees, and of course burgers, but all with a French theme and French names. For burger patty options you can chose from beef, vegetarian, salmon, chicken and turkey. And if you're feeling really spendy you can order the 777 Burger, with Kobe beef, Maine lobster, a 100-year aged balsamic served with a bottle of Rose Dom Perignon Champagne. I was not, so I went with a Le Paris burger, which came with Brie, caramelized onion and smoked bacon on a caramelized onion bun. The bartender talked me into getting the waffle fries which I typically don't like, but more on that shortly.

The burger came out in a nice presentation with the top bun next to the rest of the ensemble, and an olive stuck on top. The bun wasn't quite cut in half as the top portion seemed extra thin, but didn't present as much of a problem as I feared. Upon first bite I was impressed with the burger; the meat had great flavor, was cooked perfectly, and was proportioned very well to the bun. The brie and onions also had really good flavor, and the smoked bacon was cooked just right. The bun was sweet and delicious, and almost had a croissant flavor to it which I appreciated. The French theme carried through all the way, and it was great.

The waffle fries were also quite good, even considering the fact that I don't typically like them. This selection prevented me from checking out their regular fries, but based on the burger and waffle fries I had, I'm sure they're ok. Also, the pickle that came on the side was good, but I'm starting to think that's it's kind of hard to mess up a pickle.

The overall price of my meal was $21.08, which included a $12 burger, $4 waffle fries and a $3.50 iced tea. While I have a bit of a hard time paying over $7 for the fry and drink portion of my meal, the total price for a strip location, as well as the quality of my burger was more than acceptable.  So although you may have never heard of the place, and the Paris probably isn't too much of an attraction these days for locals, Le Burger Brasserie serves up a great burger and is worth checking out. Plus, it's located very close to the garage entrance so it's easy to get in and out of the property without straying too far.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,3,0,4,wRnhXrWNICBMdnveE2NdxA

""BEST BURGERS IN VEGAS - BURGER BRASSERIE ""  um....not even close. 

I think it's supposed to be a restaurant. Or is it a sports bar?  I've still not decided. Decor is lovely, comfortable actually.  Spacious.  Very spacious. Variety of sized tables to meet varying groups of patrons.  Bar itself is large, TVs tuned to every sports network possible.  Compared to the atmosphere the menu is a bit confusing.  Build your own burger, gourmet burgers, sliders, gravy fries, Almond Joy cheesecake and pretzels are a few items on the menu, to include a $777 burger. It does come with a bottle of Dom however....

I came here during the week for dinner.  Lots of empty tables; servers standing around twiddling thumbs, watching tv, talking amongst themselves. Took forever for our bright purple haired server to take our drink order.  There must have been a drought as our water took an eternity to arrive.  We had questions about the menu and were told not only was the menu new, but the food was better because everything was freshly made as opposed to their last menu where everything was frozen.  I opted to build my own burger, nothing fancy.  Requested it be cooked medium well & an hour later it came out rare.  My server argued with me.  Back it went and an hour later my replacement showed up.  Unfortunately it wasn't the burger I built; it was supposed to come with fried onion straws/slivers but instead someone put chopped red onion on it.  Not that it really mattered bc by the time it arrived I was no longer hungry as I filled up on my ok fries during my wait. I had it boxed up & ate part of it for dinner the next night...

I arrived here at 6:30pm & did not leave until after 10pm.  This is how S L O W they were.  Purple haired server rarely checked on us.  We went to the bar to have the bartender replenish our water & beers.  As I mentioned, numerous staff doing nothing; it was THE MANAGER you saw working, busing tables, delivering plates, setting tables & the like.  We did discuss our experience with him & while he did not comp any portion of our bill, he did give us his business card with ""2 free entrees next visit"" written on the back. We asked if he would have our server bring our check. 30 minutes later it arrived. It took just over an hour to pay it. Unacceptable.  Needless to say we tore up our ""2 free entree"" pass.

Overall the food was just average. Certainly not good enough to advertise themselves as having the Best Burgers in Vegas. The service was miserable.  I wished we stayed home. Cheers to your visit being better than mine (I hope)!",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,3,1,2,vd1WtB1rF-2lZamxiFmhtA

The meal itself costs $777 but that includes a bottle of Dom, without the fancy champaign the burger its $77 I believe. Enough with the repeating 7's the burger comes from the finest cut of Kobe beef, imported brie, caramelized onions, prosciutto, a lobster tail which is all topped off with an aged balsamic vinaigrette that made me fall to the floor. If you want a lengthy detailed description just check out my blog. 

After my cousin and I devoured the burgers the Sous-Chef came to our table to thank us. After I told him it was my birthday he told me that he was going to make a custom dessert for the both of us. I accepted and what was brought out cannot be described (look at my blog again for pictures). I am not a fan of sweets but I felt obligated and had absolutely no shame stuffing my mouth. 

After we assessed the damage which was very reasonable for what we ate we tried to finish off the drinks we ordered and I could not for the life of me ingest anything else. To this day I cannot say I have felt anymore full than I did that night. Our walk from Paris to the Venetian had to be one of the most grueling experiences of my life.

Like looking at boobies?
Fugetabodit !!!!

This is literally the only place I'll eat lamb burgers, but everything is A1 top freekin' notch. Your girlfriend/wife gotta have a sense of humor though as the staff is tastefully, scantily clad. Wandering eyes are inevitable. I went three times last week during a convention I had to attend for work, and it was well worth it every time. I'm a picky eater when it comes to burgers, and everything they do is excellent, right down to the bloody marys. In addition to being gorgeous, Karli is quick and polite. She was working the bar every time I came in, thank god. In layman's terms, she is the shit. Tons of big screens throughout if you want to watch a game, and great happy hour specials, including beer buckets. a lot of really comfortable booths that provide more than adequate privacy, should you so desire. 

I don't know what they do to the lamb, but the flavor is a lot better than anywhere else I've ever had one. Melt in your mouth goodness, consistently. The steak fries are perfect as well.

I then asked to speak to the manager. The waitress came back and said to us, "" the manager is too busy to come over."" .... ""Too busy,"" really? The waitress then came back and sweetly asked for our drink order and reintroduced herself, I'm sure in attempts, to salvage her prior rude behavior. Then after 15 min the manager came. We then asked if we could sit in the section I wanted and the manager repeated again to us "" you have to wait until another server clocks in."" I then asked why 3 parties got sat, in the section we wanted. He said "" you didn't ask for that section."" (I had been asking the whole time) He then, smugly, let us move.

I ordered the hot wings as an app and was very impressed with them. I haven't had great wings in a long time and they were cooked perfectly and were quite large.  I have never had a Lamb burger so I wanted to try it. I must say it was probably the best burger I ever had in my life. It was really that good!!!! I was really amazed of the tenderness and taste, with virtually no game taste. My buddy ordered the Kobe burger with waffle fries. The burgers were cooked very well and the price was just right, about $20 per person. In Vegas for what we ordered, that is a definite win. 

The only thing that I was disappointed with was the service. It literally took 10-15 minutes for someone to come to our table and get our orders. There weren't that many patrons in the restaurant so it was quite upsetting to me.

Burgers were good but I screwed up by ordering them medium well. Was worried the patty was going to be too juicy causing the buns to be soggy but the patty was slightly too dry for my liking, I'm sure medium would have been perfect. All in all the taste was still good enough to warrant a 4 star.

This joint is right on the border between Paris and Bally's. It looks nice and inviting. You might wait a little while to be acknowledged. You might wait even longer after you're done for someone to let you pay for your meal. You might wait a bit for a drink.

The burger is decent; better than many. They claim to be able to make burgers medium-rare, but mine arrived medium both times. Still, even medium, it was a good burger. It's a few dollars overpriced.

The fries are soft and unremarkable. You can replace them with some onion rings, which are good, but they are eight dollars and you get five of them.

Overall, you'll feel like you paid too much for what you got.

Bottom line: if you're in Paris or Bally's, you'll find a decent burger here. But it's not worth traveling for.",JV0asALxmnJGmnfrHul0tg,0,0,3,jN0inhp8860_DsD-FCaPkg

I have a big weakness for a nice juicy cheeseburger, especially when it has onion rings in it.  After ordering L' American cheeseburger, I quickly noticed that it was the type of sandwich that requires you to have a special hold to the burger.

The kind of hold the demands you to let the sandwich know who runs the show.  Hold it, or be held.  If you show weakness to it, you will fail miserably.  Two hands and a firm grip. each finger evenly spaced on the sides.  Respect it, and it will respect you.

We looked through the menus and gave him our drink and food selections and he ensured us he got all the orders in before the kitchen closed. Lets fast forward an hour. The food still hasn't come and now it's around 9:50pm and we ask about our food order. He says ""oh, the servers didn't bring you your food?"" Umm no. He goes off and says something about it bring their fault and he'll check with the kitchen. He comes back in 2 minutes with a salad that we ordered and said it would be in him. Ok things were looking a little better. We didn't receive the combo appetizer we ordered but hey, at least now we could finally get some food in our stomachs. 

Fast forward another round of drinks and we ask for our check - happy hour drink specials are annotated on the check. But so was the salad. What happened to ""the salad will be on me?""

Only good item was the bun, but the bun was so large compared to the burger that it over powered the small thin burger. Was extremely disappointed in all the food ordered-Parmesan lemon wings, hot wings both were made with same base wing (over battered, prob started with same frozen wing product). Sure you can find another place that serves better burgers in Vegas as the bar was set so low here.

 When we walked up to the doors, we were greeted by a couple of hostesses that were way too ugly to have such a shitty, snooty attitude. They barely acknowledged us and just pointed inside to the bar and said ""seat yourselves""
 We were too hungry to care so we sat down at the bar and the bartender just seemed tired, overworked and didnt really care about the people. To him, we were just another party crew passing through Las Vegas.
 He handed us all dirty, sticky greasy menus and disappeared for 10 minutes.
We finally gave him our drink orders and he was snappy with his response and seemed so annoyed by us, the people who tip. 
 When I ordered my Guinness, he just poured it in the pint, one pour and let it sit and settle by itself. Any self respecting bartender would NEVER pour a pint of Guinness so poorly. If I were a manager or the establishments owner, I would give him his walking papers just for his lack of respect to Guinness and the art of the ""Perfect Pour."" I let that slide in hopes that the food would be great.
  
I ordered the Blue Cheese burger and when it finally came out, I sank my teeth into it and, while it was a tasty burger, it was without a doubt the greasiest thing I have eaten in very long time. 
 It had disrupted my stomach that I could not even eat it anymore. It was heavier by the grease and not by the meat. Huge bun designed to fill you up and distract you from the fact that youre eating a greasy pile of beef in a huge doughy bun.
  I perhaps wouldnt have been so disappointed by this if the $15 burger at least came with french fries, but I left with a stomach ache and never a desire to return.

I would never recommend this place. If you want to eat a burger. Do NOT go here.

How strange, though, that the streets of the City of Light were clogged with one-armed bandits and semi-nude girls in tiny can-can outfits. And how oddly chunky and un-chic the Frenchies were getting!

Oh wait.  Righty-ho.  We were, in fact, still in the U.S. , albeit  in the Vegas zone. Still dazed from our flight, the traumatic car-rental Borg Palace at McCarran, and from getting an unexpected  upgrade to a suite 1/8 the size of Nevada at Harrah's (for 70 bucks!!!  marble clad Jacuzzi the size of my bathroom! a wet bar! view of the Strip!  disco balls!! whoo-weeee!), we were totally looking for a calorie-fest to celebrate the beginning of our driving trip around the Southwest. and we'd read some good recommendations for Le Burger Brasserie.   Plus we're both Pariso-philes, and we were hungry, so the deed was done.

They don't make it easy to find, whomever the Dark Forces of Casino Restaurant Planning are, but eventually we found ourselves to the slick yet bland-ly sports bar-ish brasserie.  Now, this place resembled a Paris brasserie about as much as Spongebob Squarepants resembles Pepe Le Pew, but it was okay. It's a large, multi-level space, but apparently not large enough to house a restroom.  For that, you had to wander into Bally's casino and mix with the weeping lady with the Farrah-cut and the embroidered jeans. Ah, the million tender heartbreaks of Vegas.

Food?  I had the Frenchieburger, or whatever they call their burger with Brie and carmelized onions. I asked for it rare and it came medium.  Given that flagrant disregard for my bloodlust, the damn thing was pretty good.  And the fries...well they were supah-dupah.  It must have been the double frying they got...My thighs expanded just taking that first sniff, but they'd been dipped in rosemary and possibly fried in lard, so who was I to argue? Heeeaaaaaveeeeennnn!

S, who was still not quite as wicked as he was gonna be, got a turkeyburger. I say no more. He enjoyed it and claimed it was juicy and tasty.  I thoght he was gonna go all manorexic on me and disdain the fries, but after the first few he too started making those embarassing primal sounds and we just stopped talking for awhile. 

It was Cinco de Mayo and they had $3.00 Coronas, which in Vegas seems to signify a bargain.  Clearly, they've never been to Pittsburgh (the bucket-o-scotch special at Dell's? $1.25).  I disdained the South of the Border Lizard Pee and got a nice stout Black n'Tan to wash down what i was hoping would be a nice bloody patty.  Be that as it may, our meal was  just fine and not as exorbitant as many of the gotcha! casino eateries.  In fact we passed on the mundane dessert offers (the usual brownies and crappy cheesecake offerings) and waddled off to work of 1 fry's worth of calories in the sweltering and ca-ray-zee Vegas night.",LQ_woP6Lt0vOj3BBGgp1Ow,3,2,3,WVGbtI70sGkmWAS5DsrmZg

The burger seemed small at first, which worried me because I was very hungry, but as I ate it I realized that it was deceptive. It was quite filling, but in a good way. The fries are separate, so we ordered waffle fries to share and I really enjoyed those.

My only reason for knocking it a half star was being charged $4.00 extra for red bull. I realize vodka red-bull is usually expensive, but I paid an average of $10-13 in Vegas and was fine with that. But when you tack on $4.00 but didn't indicate that anywhere on your menu, or did not inform me verbally... that's kind of a downer. I would have ordered something else to drink.

But overall it's a pretty decent place to eat when you're hungry.",S9kSawG9Ry10RlUkdGZvAQ,4,3,3,tQtqYM8nerJHDO17jnCl9w

We were enjoying a staycation at Paris and decided to have dinner here. The hostess said it was a 45 minute wait for a booth and a 15 minute wait for a table. There were plenty of open tables and booths so I don't know what the deal was. We waited patiently and after 15 minutes we were seated at a small table right where you walk in. I asked if we could sit at one of the other open spots and was told it would be a wait. I am assuming thet just didn't have enough staff or something. 

Our server was great and checked on us often. The $4 charge for a pepsi was a rip though. I ordered a combo meal for $22 that got me any burger, fries, and shake. I chose the Le Paris Burger and it had brie cheese, caramelized onion and applewood smoked bacon. The burger didn't have much flavor and disappointingly seemed to be a frozen patty but the brie cheese and bacon were good. My waffle fries would have been better if they didn't come out cold. My peanut butter shake was the best part of the meal and 5 stars alone. The service and shake were good but for a place with ""burger"" in their name.....the burger should have been more of the star than the bacon that came on it.",eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,6,5,2,co6ghOkBNRGjeDoIu-7Ktg

I ordered the turkey burger sliders which intrigued me because I have never heard of them the description in the menu made them sound so tasty.

Twice we just stopped in for drinks and once we ate dinner here. 

I had the French burger with brie. It was delicious. Very juicy. Was a bit sloppy trying to keep it all together, but overall, delicious. The waffle fries - eh - just average. Nothing great to speak of. We had great service with one of the bartenders and not so great with another... but luckily we had the good one twice. That worked out well. 

Regarding drinks - the bloody mary mix is good. Not horseradishy.. which is great! Added a splash of tabasco, and it was perfect.

Here's the real kicker - the mimosas. You get a mini-bottle of champagne and orange juice. None of the poured from a large bottle stuff. The whole little bottle. Well worth the $9. 

The location is very convenient in the walk through from Bally's to Paris.

The burger was covered with a generous helping of fresh medium bleu cheese which stayed well placed on the patty down to the last bite.

My friend got the Pork no-bone sandwich. Basically shredded pork stringy off the rack of ribs, glued together with light and very slightly spicy BBQ sauce, then lightly breaded (with Panko..?) and quick fried. Served on a toasted long bun.

For those who want it hotter a few shakes of tabasco kicked it up, but it had lots bleu cheese in it.  yum!

This place is pretty good. They have a decent size menu and plenty of options if you aren't in the mood for a burger.

We started with ""hangover cure"" bloody Mary's. They were good, but definitely not the best bloody Mary I've ever had. 

We share an appetizer sampler which had chicken wings, mac & cheese balls, and a few other things i can't remember. The chicken wings were great! However I was not expecting the mac & cheese balls to have meat in them. That was a little weird for me. 

I ordered the burger with Valveeta on it. and oh my goodness it was tasty! Perfectly cooked Medium well and with an onion bun it was a very simple yet delicious burger. 

My friends ordered a french dip and salad to share, and they liked the salad but definitely were not fans of their french dip. I was extremely greasy and the cheese sauce on it was pretty gross. After tasting it I agreed with them. 

Our service here was average at best. All the servers were women in corsets and booty shorts so I don't think they hire them based on their resumes. 

While we were dining, a woman at the table next to us started choking on her food. Luckily a man at the next table jumped up and sprang into action to give her the Heimlich and help her get the food out of her throat and breathe again. I know most servers aren't required to take any kind of CPR course so I wasn't shocked any of them weren't able to help. Luckily the woman was completely okay once she was able to cough up her food, but I was rather bothered by the fact that management was no where to be seen, and once he did come out he was on his cell phone calling an EMT (as I found out later) The restaurant did guy the man a round of drinks for helping the choking woman so that was awesome.

Great quality as far as taste and freshness.  If this restaurant was closer to home, I would consider going again.  However, I was bothered by the ambiance.  I understand it is located on the strip, but why is your hostess dressed in fishnet leggings and a corset that looks like it belongs in a strip club?  The other staff are sporting World Cup soccer T-shirt's.  The lights were low, and the scenery feels a bit more upscale...A bit.  So if you can imagine eating fancy sliders and chicken fingers while watching a half naked hostess(who really didn't even fit her clothes)walk around, you can understand why I felt uncomfortable seeing some elderly people trying to enjoy there dinners.

2014746,2018-05-25,1,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"I've honestly never felt the need to ever rate a restaurant as 1 star, but this place definitely took the prize for one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to in my life.

The only friendly person was the host who had a friendly greeting and seated us immediately. The prices are relatively appropriate (about $14+ for a burger w/ no sides, $8 appetizers) to the high cost of eating in Las Vegas but it was kind of a bummer that they did not offer combo meals during our visit. There was a table of 8-10 businessmen sitting across from my table and the server in our section was busily helping them. After about 10 minutes after being seated, the waiter came over, took our order, and just zoomed off to help the businessmen group again. We had to flag down another person to ask for waters and our food came after 15 minutes.

I ordered the Italian burger which was mediocre with a medium patty. The flavor was not bad but the patty was on the dry side and the bun was not buttered or prepared in any way at all. The girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken fries, which was essentially old fries with diced Tyson buffalo chicken tenders bathed in buffalo sauce and crumbled bleu cheese. It looked like a stoners creation and we only managed to take a couple bites before calling it quits. The onion rings are actually AMAZING. They look and tasted freshly battered, fried golden brown, came in a large portion, and well worth the 8 bucks. Apparently it's inconsistent though because other reviews had subpar onion rings.

The biggest issue at this establishment is the service. Sitting across the group of businessmen I can see our waiter going above and beyond with his service by making small talk with the group members, constantly checking if they need refills, and finally bringing out complimentary mini ice cream shakes to the whole group to finish their meal. The same waiter never brought us out waters, never came around to check on our food after it was brought out, and also charged us extra on our receipt so we had to wait another 10 minutes to get it fixed (because he was nowhere to be found).

The restaurant itself is open late and doesn't look too bad from the inside or the outside. However, don't be fooled because the food lacks quality and unless you come in a large group you won't receive any service. I much rather have dinner from a vending machine because it'll be faster, cheaper, and probably just as good tasting.",lZiqaMOH-thX0t48mT0Qug,2,2,1,ffxAhmpm1IfIIMDl4AEdYA

The fries were over done and had that batter stuff on them, which I hate, so the shrimp and the fries tasted the same - like nothing!

It's got the name of an upscale restaurant, with the serving staff that you'd probably expect to find at Planet Hollywood (casino), or maybe a strip club. This isn't to insult the fine ladies, they were very attractive and I do not mean that insultingly. It was just weird.

Weirder still was the interior straight out of a NYC dive bar, with bar staff that were doing crazy tricks a la TGI Fridays, but with the the conversation (IE: good) of a good, well-hidden bar in the aforementioned large apple. 

More confusing still was the quality of the burgers, which were, frankly, shockingly good. I wanted more when I was done. Fresh avocado, nicely cooked medium burgers, and great blue cheese. In fact, the whole meal was delicious.

However, this was covered by the malaise of everybody pretending to be excited at the USA playing Brazil in an irrelevant soccer tournament, and the faint sound of bees buzzing that is the sound of a crowd. And, yes, this was really annoying when you're trying to enjoy a meal. 

I just don't know what to make of this place, but I'd certainly go back and eat there. It was just a bit dissonant. I don't know, don't look at me. What am I, a bar scientist?",0jJf8FAW-EmkwrQnXTGdTQ,0,0,3,WHFGlfyC8WX963DzH7qJjg

Minus my initial introduction from a hostess that just did not understand her role as the front person for the business, where the key is being understanding, diplomatic and patient. (Fail, Fail, Fail). My guess without reading all the reviews is a portion of the lower stars were from customers that faced a similar situation to mine, in dealing with her. (No names should be mentioned and won't) The truth is I hope she got canned for her horrible attitude and unprofessional approach to me and my party as it is the proper way to handle these types
Once seated inside, peering at the well appointed dining area, grasping the classy menu (yes, even burger joints can have sophisticated menus from structure to content) I was totally at peace and ready to order. The service was excellent, never needing for an item that wasn't available nor offered.
As we had a member of our group that was under the weather and spoke no English, I ordered for him a bowl of Chicken Noodle soup with extra French Bread and butter. The butter must have been hand churned as it was better than any I have had to date and the French bread was equally as outstanding, crispy, flaky, doughy served up piping hot.
So few places do Mojotios and even less will prepare an wildcard fruit Mojito like strawberry, which our server Kristine assured us was no problem and it was delivered swiftly and the bar alchemist did a splendid job in its creation. If your not into such beverages, you can enjoy a cold Coors Light for the rock bottom price of $8.00. No not for a 12 ouncer but a 24!
The Classic (Le Classique) medium rare, with a side of Bearnaise sauce, served on Parmesan bread was a real delight, quality ground beef cooked to perfection, but it paled in comparison to the Saveur Burger which just reached the pinnacle of burger predictability. The Petite cone of French Fries was far from petite as it was ample enough to provide a nice side order for a few patrons to share.

Unfortunately I can not recall the young mans name that was the MOD on the day we sat to eat at Le Burger Brasserie Sports Grille, but I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to him as a true food and beverage professional manager. When I first began this article, I mentioned a very unpleasant situation that was thrust upon me and my guests of not doing of our own, The young Asian gentleman (the MOD-Manager on Duty) listened to my explanation of the unpleasant reception we were greeted with. There was no wavering in his demeanor, he listened intently, sat us immediately and checked in with us after our meal had come to its completion.

Two of us ordered dessert. I ended up getting the Chocolate Tiramisu and my friend ordered the Dessert Sliders. The tiramisu was fantastic. It came in a cup, which was kind of weird. You had to dig deep in order to get all the flavors and layers. It was a HUGE portion, so watch out! The sliders were very interesting. It was something I've never seen before. They looked like mini burgers, but they were really raspberry, mango and cheesecake gelatin shaped into tomatoes, cheese and a patty. It was surprisingly pretty good.

They do have a happy hour from 4-7 so I suggest coming during this time to save money on drinks. Beers alone are about $8. I had the blu cheese burger and it was very good. The waitresses are dressed very provocative but I can't say the price is necessarily worth it because I got stuck with a male waiter....I was not pleased. I would take a look around to see who's serving where and request a certain table or go to the bar.

I don't want to waste your time with me droning on about the ambiance, swanky red and black interior, bar in the middle, dim lighting and several LCD tvs around the area. The sexy (some) servers in their skimpy red corsets and black boy shorts.

A girlfriend and I choose the following:
In true American fashion, I ordered the Le Paris burger-medium.
Brie, smoked bacon, and caramelized onion on the oven dried tomato bun.

She had the NY strip steak (medium) with waffle cut French fries. 

They have 3 types of french fries:
Thin (petit)
Steak cut (pomme)
Waffle

Most joints usually include fries with your burger, I'm surprised to find out that's not the case here. I thought maybe I could just have some of hers, but last minute to get my own thin cut fries.

The server goofed on the order and got me the waffle fries too. I didn't care too much to correct her and I'm glad I didn't cause they were yumm-o! Nicely salted, and felt like I was snacking on chips. 

The burger was delicious. I forgot there were any onions because they were nicely caramelized blended well with the smoked bacon. The tomato bun was a nice touch to it., and a side of a pickle. I wish there were more brie...

The steak was good too. I like to ruin my steak with A1, and I enjoyed this without it. 

All in all, a nice place to go if you're craving a good burger. Definitey coming here again. Wish I had the extra $777 to blow on the infamous 777 Burger.

To note: I'm not a huge burger fan, and for some odd reason I was craving one that day. I still day dream about the burger I had there.",NNN9qmqS-obqC1ozF-GNvQ,2,3,5,lFq8NVtdtvTMioC9bYjwmQ

I ordered the beef burger and she ordered the chicken one.  We also ordered the fry sampler with waffle and petite fries.

The burgers were pretty tasty and a good size.  My only complaint was that the meat was VERY VERY salty.  Both the beef and chicken were seasoned with something with tons of salt.  The waffle fries were ok but the other ones were just 'eh.  They needed some kind of aioli.

I'm so glad I listened to her. My medium-well L'Italian was deliciously juicy. And the mozzarella was generously thick. The arugula was so green and fresh, and the server even let me sub out the proscuitto for a fried egg, for free!

The sil had Le Paris, that comes with Brie, onions and bacon. I didn't try it, but she clearly enjoyed it. 

They have 3 types of frites -- regular, steak and waffle. We went with the steak fries, which are generously salted, but oh so tender.

We had a beet and goat cheese salad that is so good that we cannot stop enjoying the dish. It contains regular and golden beet. It is very refreshing as the dressing is light and sweet.

The burger we ordered is the salmon burger. It is a big piece of good salmon. I usually am not so passionate about salmon. But this one make me want to have more. The salmon is fresh and the meat is juicy and soft. 

We ended the dinner with a trio sorbet. There are three scoops of sorbet with raspberry, mango and coconut. The sorbet is thick and tasted like fresh fruit. We enjoyed them so much. I was a bit annoyed at the time it took to prepare the dessert dish. We wait additional 20 min just to get the sorbet after the meal.

In all, we like the food very much. Even without the Groupon deal, I think the price range is reasonable with the quality of food you get.

The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because of the service. When we came in, we were led to a very small 2 person table with a few shopping bags on hand. We asked for a larger table so we can put things away and eat comfortably. Then we were pointed to a table by the entry door and service station that has a lot of foot traffic and no privacy. So we asked again to be seated more inside as we saw there was an empty booth adjacent to inner wall. The waitress just looked at us and said that it is not cleaned. We were then just said ""forget it"" and sit uncomfortably on that noisy table. But honestly speaking, why can't she make any effort to accommodate customer's request? How hard would it be to ask someone to clean up the table? There are a lot of ways to better handle the situation than simply decline customer's wish.

I'm one of those who generally doesn't complain to the server or a manger if something is not really all that good. I figure if they knew how to do a better job, they would. Having worked in restaurants for 40 years, I know for a fact, they don't take customers' critiques seriously.  

This place was so-so at best. Prices were about par for the course for a Vegas casual eatery. 

I had the lamb burger. It was more than well-done, which meant it was drier than Red Rock Canyon in August. Neither ketchup nor mustard helped. The onion rings I ordered looked impressive, with huge slices stacked on a spindle. The let-down came when tasting them: extremely soggy(!!) batter and VERY mushy onions. I had 2 of them. Total waste of money.

Waitress was OK...nice enough, but not super attentive.

We were disappointed that a ""French"" place didn't carry French beer.  But that wasn't the problem... If a restaurant has ""burger"" in the title, their burgers better be good.  The bread was overdone.  The meat was dry and not much flavor.  We got the bleu cheese burger, and the bleu cheese tasted like that nasty Athenos brand from the plastic container.  

A plus is that it is a sports bar... so come get a beer and a snack of french fries... then go somewhere else for dinner!

Heard from my friend Yohan that this place had a pretty dang good burger so I went to verify with my non-burger loving mother again.  She ended up getting a salad this time and seemed to enjoy it.  My burger was pretty plain.  No frills.  That being said, the patty was seasoned enough so that it didn't need a lot of help in the condiments department.  That being said, while it was good, I don't think I would crave it unless I already happened to be in the Paris hotel and casino.

WHAT I ORDERED: 

Le POULET (salad) - 3/5 pretty tasty, but nothing spectacular

Le CLASSIQUE (burger) - 3/5 solid patty, adding a special sauce might push it to 4/5

Sweet Potato Fries - 4/5 how can you go wrong with these?

STAFF:
Exceptional.  Our waitress was attentive and genuinely sweet.

WAIT TIME:
No wait time Saturday around 6:30pm

PORTION: 
Hearty sized burger.

The portions and quality of burger match the price well.

The restaurant is located in the Paris Hotel on the walkway towards Bally's.  The cuisine is good and tasty.  The restaurant has a great variety of hamburgers with Kobe and lamb also on the menu and a variety of toppings.  If you enjoy a gourmet style burger, this place is the place for you.  

The service is mediocre at best.  I wanted patiently for about 15 minutes for a table for two.  Although I hate waiting, it is a part of life and you live with it.  Once we were at the table it took another fifteen or twenty minutes to order.  Minutes later we got our beverages.  The food took another half an hour to receive.  

I understand that good food takes time.  Note: a hamburger in a restaurant does not need that much time unless the establishment runs out of food.  Ridiculous.  The waitress was not attentive.

The burgers are good. They are fresh and they give ample portions. 
My complaints would be as follows: The burgers are served on tissue paper and a mesh wire basket. For a $10 hamburger served without fries this is pretty ridiculous. Would a plate be too much. 
Secondly fries anyone?? $10 and no side? That just can't fly.

Service was just okay. Not spectacular so that part I would give 3 stars to. What gets the 4 stars here was the food. Mainly what I ordered...

They have lamb burgers. I LOVE domestic lamb. In fact, growing up, we ate more lamb than beef, so when I see it on a menu, I tend to go that direction. The man had a turkey burger with Swiss which he enjoyed, but we both agreed my burger rocked our mouths. I ordered it Mediterranean style with a freshly baked onion roll. What this consisted of was a perfectly medium cooked lamb patty, feta cheese, kalamata olives and about 1/8 of an avocado. OMG, so delicious, I wanted to eat another one of these today (with the Le Crap place, I should have)!

My boyfriend ordered the burger with blue cheese, and I ordered the burger with grilled onions.  I don't remember the name of the burgers as I didn't take a picture of the menu.  Both burgers were recommended by our waitress.  She offered superb service, so no complaints on that.

We also ordered the onion rings.  They are huge and stacked on top of each other in a tower form.  I think in total there were 5 onion rings, dusted with cheese powder. The onion rings were hot, but didn't have any onion flavour.  Perhaps there was too much batter. 

The burgers looked good and had good presentation, but it didn't taste good at all.  Not juicy and dry.  The blue cheese burger was very pungent, so I guess if you love blue cheese, you might like this burger, but it covers all the other taste. 

Was really disappointed.  On the plus side because I'm a diamond member, right before we were leaving and paying, the manager came and gave us two sample sizes of vanilla milkshake for being a diamond member.

There are several televisions and one large projection screen for viewing sports while enjoying burgers and drinks.  There is a full service bar and  bar seating as well as tables and booths.  

The menu consists primarily of burgers, a few salads, appetizers, shakes, drinks and a couple of sides.  Prices for burgers run in the $14-18 dollar range along with a gimmick ""777"" burger which costs $777.  I tried to ask our server about it, but she wasn't listening to me, a theme which continued throughout the night. My wife had the bleu burger which came with bacon, and a delicious house made sesame bun.  I have never seen so much bleu cheese on a burger and although I enjoy bleu cheese on burgers and steaks there was way to much cheese.  My wife had to scrape off the excess cheese.  The burger itself was cooked perfectly with a little pink in the center.

I ordered the No Bones Rib Sandwich.  It was served on the same house made sesame roll and when I picked it up it weighed a ton.  Seriously that sandwich weighed at least a pound. There was a large amount of boneless rib meat, onion strings and some type of pickled cabbage or slaw.  The sandwich looked and sounded better than it tasted though.  Unfortunately if was just okay for me.

We ordered a side of fries to share and were hoping for the thin crispy delicious fries served in the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, but unfortunately we got plain old fries which broke in half every time we tried to dip them in the tasty spicy ketchup that it came with.

The highlight of our meal were the alcoholic shakes. We ordered the cookies and cream and mint chocolate shakes which were pretty tasty for $8 each.  Although Holsteins and Burgr serves better shakes these were pretty good and cheaper than the other two places.

Our server was friendly and attentive but irritatingly only spoke and listened to my wife.  Now I have worked in food service before and I know that female servers will often focus on the female when serving couples as to not risk the female thinking the server was flirting with her man, but this was just outright being ignored. Perhaps the skimpy outfits the servers wear played a part in this, but for me this was just BAD service.  Our food also took at least 20 minutes to come out even though the place was not busy.

Overall even with the $20 for $40 Groupon we still spent $40 after tip.  We had a burger, a sandwich, one order of fries and two shakes. Without the Groupon our bill would have been $60 assuming a 20% tip.

The problem was that they seemed to have forgotten about the beers and they just sat there for like 15 minutes getting warm.

Trying to get one of the server's attention was also quite the task.  

Then the waitress comes and puts down a beer in front of my friend who picks it up to drink...and the waitress proceeds to grab the beer from his hand and says ""this one isn't yours!""    What kind of waitress just grabs something out of your hand without saying something first?!

Which, due to the abovementioned method, I would end up getting full before I even get halfway through the meat patty.  

Yet I find myself finishing Le Burger Brasserie's lamb burger with fried egg topping - must either be the lack of food from the day before, or the overexertion at Tryst the previous night, or neither.  Maybe the burger was just that much more superior than any other gourmet burger I've encountered.

3135790,2014-11-18,11,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"It is easy to miss this early adopter to the ""gourmet"" burger craze currently in full swing. Burger Brassiere is located in the walkway that connects the Bally's and Paris hotels. While actually closer in proximity to Bally's, it is in fact part of the Paris property.   it is as much a sports bar as anything with a large bar area booth seating throughout the restaurant.  You are never out of TV view and there is always a game playing on the flat screens. 
I like Burger Brasserie for a few reasons, they do have a quality burger and some clever sides at a reasonable price, they have a beverage HH everyday from 4-7, and they offer discounts to total rewards members. The biggest complaint is just the noise level and the fact they can get very busy to the point of it effecting service.
Anyhow it is a great place to grab a draft and a burger and enjoy a game. In my opinion it beats the sports book at both Bally's and Paris. 
I have been several times over the years and it's been a while. My last visit recently was a pleasant reminder that they do a reasonably good job of the sports bar theme with some very nice comfort food. 
I mixed it up this time and ordered the very rich and decadent  French Onion Burger
caramelized onions, gruyère gratinée.  It comes dry so the condiments are up to you.
The burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was pillowy soft. A touch of Dijon 
Mustard and this puppy rocked.

So many options for my burger with so little time, it literally made me drool and left my head spinning. My dining partner and I were very pleased with the environment....very clean open space with televisions galore. We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server who was very friendly and attentive. 

Knowing that the two of us were going to be sitting in our seats for a while enjoying a little college football we decided to go all out. We started off with the potato skins and a yummy arugula salad with gorgonzola and granny smith apples. The salad was crisp/fresh and the 'skins didn't skimp out on the cheddar, bacon and sour cream! The burgers that came out after were so very good. I had to order the Le Paris Burger because I have a love affair with brie cheese. The brie was melted, topped with caramelized onions, bacon and was cooked perfectly. We ordered fries and rings which were both very crispy. I loved the fact that we could order dipping sauces to dunk them in. I suggest the garlic pesto....YUM!!  The only complaint for the evening was the dessert. The beignet that we had were not something that I would have again....but that's what I get for ordering beignets outside 'Nawlins.

Anyway, we had a decent time here but probably would not go back.

I wasn't too fond of the restaurant interior. We were seated at a booth that felt rather grimy and outdated. It is also fairly dark inside and the table setup is sort of crowded. I am not sure exactly - but something about being there was just off and I never felt comfortable during our meal. Aside from that, our waiter was a very nice guy, but overall service was clumsy and scattered.

For dinner we started off with the gravy fries, which were delicious by the way. We followed up with a french dip style sandwich and custom kobe burger.

I was recently in Sin City for work and we had our department dinner at Burger Brasserie. We were a large group, so I feel slightly bad for giving criticism, but the service was painfully slow. Some of my coworkers were on their second drink while others hadn't even gotten their first, many of the food orders took a long time (possibly misplaced?), and our server never asked if we wanted additional drinks.

Beyond the service, I found the food to be just blah. Once again, read someone else's review regarding their burgers, but as for their appetizer platter, french fries, shrimp Caesar salad, and tomato bisque soup, I was unimpressed. The appetizers were average (yet obviously cost double since it's Vegas) and my ""tomato bisque soup"" had to have been marinara sauce. My coworker even said it tasted like the same sauce she got with her fries. The only positive note for the food was that their shrimp was surprisingly delicious.

Pickle was quite good, though. Living in San Francisco has spoiled me.
Beers on tap were mostly your standard domestic fare; Bud, Miller Lite, etc. - at least they had Stella and Sam Adams...

The menu was impressive.  Sure, they had the traditional cow burgers, but they added turkey burgers also. And salmon! And lamb! And, relegated to the bottom right corner of the menu, were some vegetable burgers that may be perfectly tasty, but who would come to a burger joint for that?

I chose the lamb burger, and ordered a side dish of fat fries and waffle fries.  I'd figured they'd give me two smallish servings of each type, but no, they trotted out a full order of potatoes.  Although initially I got the petit fries with the waffle fries, the waitress realized her mistake and brought out a full order of steak fries as well.  Turns out I liked the petit fries better; they were crispy and seasoned, the steak fries were kinda bland.

As was the lamb burger, surprisingly.  I'd chosen the lamb because I thought it would have a darker flavour to it, but apparently this is not the case.  Don't get me wrong, I've got no doubt that this was one of the better lamb burgers out there.  But I've come to realize, after eating here, that I shall be keeping my lamb on its rack, and having the traditional cow in my burgers.

The condiments, by the way, are plain old condiments.  Ketchup and mustard come in the standard squeezable bottle, and the pickle was just a pickle.",mQo3ip0w2t7ESFAAuFf0_w,0,0,3,zIqB_G5ifXJd_MdiGMtNVQ

Our real reason we went here was to watch the Lakers v. Nuggets b-ball game.  There's a couple giant screen TVs (over 100 inches) and then the place is surrounded by HD flat screens.  They also serve 100 ounce 30 dollar beers (not sure what flavors) and the bring them out in these really cool bong looking containers, not to mention 4-7 happy hour with 2 for 1s.  The only draw back to that is that you have to go up to bar to be able to get the drink special, kind of lame....

The petite frites (skinny fries) were surprisingly lacking in flavor, it needed more salt or seasoning.   

As for the Parisian themed outfits they make the girls wear (white booty shorts, go-go boots), there are a few of the gals sporting muffin tops who really need to order their tops one size larger (sorry, I am just being honest).    

A burger, fries, chicken wings and 2 diet cokes was $30 before tip.   We were in and out of there in about 25 minutes flat, so it's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat that is a step up from the hotel cafes.",RrKNg5pqOEAmmjdPqu3efQ,0,0,3,dsjQMtaxErUbjwP1nvysPA

Cheetoh-dusted onion rings, poutine, and Mac and cheeseburger bites that are to die for. Yes, you read that right. They one upped mac and cheese bites and added delicious ground beef. I'm a fan of their waffle fries, but you can order regular fries or sweet potato. I decided to go with a traditional Kobe beef burger with crispy onions, while my girlfriend tried the lamb with avocado and bacon. Both were excellent and cooked to perfection. The cherry on top of all of this amazing food was the Oreo shake we ordered. I am not big on shakes, but this is hands down the best milkshake I will probably ever have. It was spiked, though you couldn't tell. It was smooth, creamy, and I couldn't get enough. The presentation of the food is also really fun. Cones for fries, and the burgers come with toothpicks in the center with BB initials. Little touches like this are sure to be appreciated by those who pay attention to detail.  The service is a tiny bit slow, and the burgers do take a bit to cook. The waitresses dress in very showy outfits, so it's not the best restaurant for kids. There are bright red corsets, fishnets, and clevage involved. From the outside you can already tell it's a sports bar. It's not really French themed at all, except for a french word thrown in the title. This restaurant definitely caters to men. There are games on the flat screens and a hearty drink menu. It's best to go during Happy Hour to take full advantage of their selection. The price is moderate for a Vegas restaurant, especially one located inside a casino. We paid $40 in all for the appetizer, drinks, and two entrees with fries. I wish the fries came with your burger, since you're paying $9-15 for just a singular burger. Not cheap, but certainly could have cost more since it's Vegas. Well done, Burger Brasserie! (Get it?)",jkfYfwtJBUamD-j5-QOvEQ,1,0,4,AIfZRf5gj6Azjf5O3bcTqQ

1. The food was COLD. The place wasn't really that busy, being that it was 10:00pm, but our waitress seemed to be so frazzled the whole night. It took a while for us to order and receive our food. My boyfriend ordered the kobe burger and I decided on the lamb burger, in addition to an onion ring tower. When the food finally arrived, with the onion ring appetizer arriving after the burgers, we found out that everything was room temperature or cold. However, I was so hungry that I decided to ignore it.

2. FOREIGN OBJECTS in the burger. Halfway through my burger, I bit something hard. It turns out that it was a hardened piece of PLASTIC from the patty casing. I immediately reported this to the waitress and she apologized and went to the back to talk to the chef. She same back and asked if I wanted a new burger, which of course I said yes (I was still hungry!). 5 min later, she delivered a fresh HOT lamb burger and it was very tasty. The burger was comp'd from the check.

I think the only good thing that I experienced during my last visit here is that they make a delicious frozen raspberry mojito. Cheers!",GyEiBEmdjq7i1L9M2PGaNA,3,0,1,uhxVKqC1lH5VFIapCFR2bQ

The service was average, the girls are busy and working lots of tables so I get it. 

The positive? My Le' Paris burger was delicious!! It had Brie cheese, carmelized onions and bacon on it, the combination of those flavors was awesome!! 

I would probably go back for a quick bite without a wait.

My opinion is that this is an older Vegas restaurant that used to be poppin' and now it's lost some of that hotness that's so important in this city! I would guess that this gets a makeover into a different restaurant in the near future!

We waited to be seated for about 15 minutes which was OK except for the fact that there were several empty tables.  They're just understaffed enough they can't clear all the tables to accommodate the arriving guests.

Our server, Leo, was a personable young man and answered questions we had.  He's the reason this isn't the two star rating I'd normally give for the food.

Le Burger Brasserie--good burgers and such.  No, not really.  They're burgers made from frozen patties.  They are so uniform in diameter and thickness they have to be packaged ahead of time.  I asked for mine rare but it was more toward medium rare.  My wife asked for hers medium and hers was cooked the same as mine.

The burgers were not at all juicy.  They look pretty, so to speak, because they come in their paper-lined metal basket with the side of lettuce and tomato.  I got a bleu burger and my wife got the Le Paris, a burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, bacon.  My burger had bleu cheese and bacon with a half avocado on the side.  You also get to choose from among 4 or 5 options for the kind of bun you want for the burger.  When I leave a burger place and the things that stick in my head about the meal are the avocado and the bleu cheese, then it wasn't a great burger experience.  

For dessert, we shared the beignets, 5 small rounds filled with mascarpone and served with chocolate dipping sauce and whipped cream.  They were OK, but nothing I'll remember.

Spending an hour and a half having a burger is also too long.  It turned out to be alright because I was watching the college football game on their big screen.  We got out in just enough time to walk to the Jubilee! Theatre for our show and we had some time to spare.  

I'd recommend going anywhere else for a burger.  I know these are Strip prices but give me something a little more worthy of the price you're charging.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,5,1,3,fd4YG1na4-96FoPnMy-hvw

The service:
The service was completely subpar for such a seemingly swanky place. They got it wrong from the start. Our order came out in what can only be described as clearly over the average wait for a meal-close to 20 min. BUT WAIT, there's more... that simply alone wouldn't warrant a single, lonesome star. 

During our meal, our server didn't come by til the end only to refill our drinks; didn't engage us, didn't ask if we needed anything-granted we didn't actually need anything, but it still woulda been nice to know she's on top of things. 

Finally after our meal-which I'll write about in a sec-it was time for dessert. I would've asked our server for a dessert menu but she was MIA and after sitting there for 10 minutes with empty plates someone else comes to collect them. So I ask HIM for a dessert menu and he has this ""deer in headlights"" look. Lol. He just says, ""Ok"" and walks away never to be seen or heard from again. But our waitress did come by eventually, NOT with a dessert menu but with the damn bill. WTF happened to the menu? Lol. Sadly, it took another 20 minutes from the time she brought the bill to us getting up after paying. 

Now the food: 
I myself ordered the Campagne turkey burger. It was pretty good, but turkey was a bit dry. It was definitely lacking something though. BTW, don't expect fries or ANY side to come with that burger though. You'll have to cough up $7 for fries-which would be fine if they were fantastic fries!!! But they were just ""eh"". And as for condiments or dipping sauces? They don't have much and what the do have is ""fancied up"" superfluously.

-Served quick

-Le Saumon Salmon (their salmon burger).  I had this on my most recent visit and was actually surprised.  I've had their burgers before and rather stick to a good old fashion American burger.

Just Okay...
-The rest of their burgers. I've had their Le Kobe Burger and Sliders on past visits.  Let's just say that I wasn't too impressed, especially since their known for burgers

You can order a  burger with a beef, chicken, lamb, turkey, or salmon patty.  They have a full list of toppings and condiments you can add onto your burger.  The list includes regulars such as cheeses, avocado, bacon, and grilled onions to the obscure and unique such as crabmeat, grilled shrimp, and even seared foie gras.

My favorite treat at this restaurant is the selection of 3 different kinds of fries.  You can choose between shoestring, steak, and waffle cut fries or a combination of your choice between the 3.

A few minutes later, our waitress brought two separate Caesar Salads on two plates, so we assumed she had somehow misheard and put in two orders. I grumpily ate mine, although it was indeed an above-average Caesar. The dressing was creamy and had a nice acidic bite running through it, while the croutons were fairly flavorful.

I find Cold Stone's ice cream to be fairly sub-par compared to Ben and Jerry's and even Baskin-Robbins, but it's the endless possibilities and creativeness that make it fun and a tasty treat.

That being said, I certainly don't think that the Brassier burgers are sub-par. The actual patty - I've experienced a turkey and lamb burger - has been good.  Not amazing, but good.  I was hoping for a really game-y experience upon ordering the lamb burger, but it wasn't the lamb experience I was expecting.  The toppings are great - a gourmet variety including brie cheese, harissa hot sauce, buffalo sauce (on a chicken dish), cranberry sauce, caramelized onions, and on and on.  And the bun choices are also fun.  Fries are crispy and salty, just great.

I ate at the bar and had great service throughout the evening. My burger with bacon and brie was delicious! They were also serving $1 drafts of Blue Moon and Stella for happy hour - not a bad deal at all. Sure, the pricing on the burgers is a little high, especially since they come a la carte. But the burger was big enough that I was stuffed after eating it - no need for fries or any other kind of side item.

Overall I was very pleased with this place. I know they run a lot of good drink specials to bring folks in since they're located in an awkward place between Bally's and Paris. Check them out! But sit at the bar.",rKbHJVoreU_p_Hj1JVqHaw,1,1,4,W1OjgdDCynuSPzp1811ccg

I had the cheeseburger , yes that's its name nothing fancy just A Cheeseburger. It was made with velvetta that gave it an interesting flavor and a pickle that reminded me of grandmother's homemade bread and butter pickles. Condiments are provided on the table such as ketchup and spicy brown mustard but trust me they need nothing else. Mine came a perfect medium on a toasted fresh made bun. She had a Cheeseburger but changed her cheese to a smoked cheddar. I sampled hers and found it delicious as well. Again condiments would have just brought this dish down. On this visit we went with french fries that came with a very interesting in house made condiment that was akin to a wasabi ketchup. The staff was attentive without being overly friendly. Drinks stayed filled and checked on us frequently without being annoying. We found this wonderful place by a groupon offer which left us paying half price. Our first visit was so good we returned 2 days later. This time I had the chicken sandwich and she added bacon to a cheeseburger and switched to velvetta. Our side item choice this time was onion rings which are great but made even better because they are made with Cheeto powder in the batter! Absolutely delighted with this fun choice. Our server Amanda was a bit more friendly on this visit and the service was even better. I only give it 4 because without the groupon offer it would have been a bit pricey for burgers and fries, but we enjoyed it so much I will return each time we come to Vegas even if I have to pay full price. They had very tasty sounding milkshakes that all contained alcohol sadly we were too stuffed to try them but rest assured they will be top of our list on the next visit.",n87RobGZgoyTkJhy2jUWBw,2,1,4,h_5yIJKHW4nKZsD7SjkLZw

omg this salmon burger is one of my favor and the best i have tastes the salmon patty is used with real salmon and is made fresh and does taste homemade not some manufacturer made salmon patties. the salmon patty was charbroiled and it was well done and it wasnt dry and it was moist and the bun they served with was hot and crisp. they gave lots of veggies and mayo with it. i always like to include a side of horse radish to give the burger  a kick. also the fries is a hit and miss sometimes the waffle fries can be burnt or sometimes its just crisp good. the first time i had the crisp fries they were absolutely good and was soooo fresh with the ketchup and horse radish mixed together. if u like the blear your sinus do what i dipped my waffle fries in. 

even the regular hamburger my friends said it was good. i didnt try it but i saw the oresentation and the smell it does looked good. 

the prices of the burger were kinda pricey for 15 and 13 and etra for waffle fries. the price of the burgers are worth it tho becausw you pay for what you get. i definitely  do come bakc when im in vegas because there burgers are delicious. 

service here is great and they do give good service. and were honest when i left my wallet and came right back for it they already had it in the back for me to come back and claim it. i almost had a heart attack lol.... but this place does satisfy my hunger buzz and burger cravings.",gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ,1,2,4,Hw667ZGiX0Vcm61hJBkKiA

I didn't think I was hungry since it was 10 pm but somehow our group ended up in this quite spacey, dark, nicely decorated sports bar. I glanced around the restaurant and I mainly saw older... uuhh white haired men. The waitresses wore uniforms that consisted of bustiers and fishnet stockings and all I remember is: wowww fake boobies and how is she so toned and ripped?? (while eating my greasy fatty food =) )

Our waiter was nice and patient because we were being indecisive. He recommended 'Le Paris' Burger, so with two other friends we ordered that and 'Le Combinaison.' The food seemed to take a bit while, not tooo long, but still testing our impatience just a little. But all the orders came out together and us girls DEVOURED everything.

Le combinaison (12.99) is like a typical all-american sportsbar sampler with hot wings, chicken tenders, potato skins, onion rings, popcorn shrimp, celery and carrot sticks, with ranch and bleu cheese sauce. omgggg. i haven't eaten so much greasy and fried and calorie-glorified food in so long, especially around the time I went to this restaurant because I was trying to look fit for vegas (we went right before summer was ending).

And Le paris (11.99) burger with brie cheese, caramelized onion, smoked bacon, and I think with pickles on the side? I don't know what made this burger so delicious, but it was juicy and flavorful! That burger disappeared so quickly. :( hahaa. I would definitely like to eat the Le paris again.

Oh and wash the oily food down with blue moon with orange slice garnish. yummm start off Vegas by being a fatty ahhhh! 

In my opinion, the portions weren't too big so the orders were a little bit on the pricey side. And I'm sure I would've rather used the money for something mindblastingly delicious (albeit expensive) elsewhere in Vegas. But the food left us satisfied and content. I think it might've been just my stomach from not being used to eating such greasy food in so long, but we were walking down the strip and I had such a tummy ache.

Immediately greeted by the hostess and brought to our booth, and our server came by to take our drink orders shortly after.  I can't remember her name, but she was attentive, and gave us great suggestions and recommendations on the menu.  We ordered 2 burgers and the waffle fries, all very tasty.  While the burgers were good, they were so over powered by cheese.  Now don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but when there is more cheese spilling out of the burger and all over the plate, it's a little much.  My husband had the blue cheese burger, and I could smell the pungentness of the cheese from across the table.  The actual burger itself was good.

We got a 2for1 entree from the Total Rewards booth and figured we would give it a shot. We have walked by the place several times through our many trips to Vegas. The place looks cool from the outside, with all the TVs on sports and all the great looking girls all dressed in their corsets and what-have you. 

As we sat down, we were greeted by the waitress. My wife and I were starving and the first thing my wife asked for was the onion ring tower and she asked if she could rush it, because she was so hungry she was about to pass out. We saw her go around the corner and not even a minute later she flew around the corner with the onion rings. The waitress said she had taken someone else order. I don't know if that was the case or not, but it was great that she made it happen.

My wife and I each got the Kobe Burger, I added bacon on mine and my wife added avocado to hers. We tried each others and they were both juicy and very very good. They burgers are normally $20 ($19 for TR members), even if I paid full price, it would have still been worth it. We will make it a point to come back here every time we come back to Vegas. The service was amazing and the food was great too. 

For the people who don't know, if you get a discount like 2for1 or something like that. Please tip your wait staff off of what the total bill would have been. They still worked for that money. And usually they don't give you half the service they normally would, just because you have a discount. They work hard for that money.

I opted for the Le Bleu (I like bacon and avocado, but asked for it without the namesake cheese) and found it to be very flavorful on the onion bun. At $12 without any side (all sides are a la carte) it was a tad bit pricey but not too bad for Vegas and the ordered toppings were not skimped on, with my burger being topped by a full half of an avocado and three medium thickness cut (the good stuff!) flavorful bacon.

My buddy who was with me had the Salmon burger and said it was pretty good, but complained about the fact we did not go to the buffet, I reminded him the line was nearly an hour long and that changed that. 

The servers, though scantily clad, are efficient and courteous. The kitchen seemed to be a little slow, taking about twenty minutes to prepare our food (cooked medium...but slightly overcooked) despite the eatery being pretty empty.

The beer selection is not outrageously priced but nor is it too great of a beer list and the lack of a line was nice. There are televisions throughout the establishment which makes me believe it may get pretty busy during large sporting events with people drinking Miller Lite, of which ads are plastered all over the place.

If you want lunch and don't want to wait in a line to be able to sit down this is a good option to consider, though I still much prefer Houston's California Burger and just about anything at the Counter to this place, this has nudged in to the top five of best burgers i've had...and I've had hundreds.",4XxQSlRLhECpr9rcOcc6rA,0,0,4,-tGFIvLADVvgGwEnKnXT6w

I had never been here, but was planning an upcoming trip to Vegas, when I saw a Groupon advertised. I briefly checked out their menu and decided to purchase the Groupon. 

When we arrived, we were seated immediately, as there was hardly anybody there. This place seems to be more suitable for adults. The wait staff was good, very friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything and that our drinks stayed filled.

I ordered the French onion Burger and man was it goooooood!!! The cornmeal bun was just right, not too big, not too small. I ordered my burger well done, and it was cooked just right. The cheese was ooey-gooey and the french onions were very tender and had a perfect balance of flavor. The burger was expensive, I believe $14 or $15 and it did NOT come w/ any sides, just the burger.

My husband ordered the housemade cheddar dog w/ cheese curds. It was about a foot long and had cheese melted on top and down the sides. You could tell that the cheesecurds were also housemade and not out of a freezer, they were tempura style. There was also some sort of redpepper relish on top that was tasty.

This place is super expensive for a burger joint. I purchase my burger, my husbands burger, a plain cheeseburger, pretzel appetizer and 3 soft drinks and the bill was over $70!!! We did not have any fries or side dishes w/ our meals, everything is a la carte. Even w/ my Groupon I still ended up paying over $40. They have a burger called the '777' and it costs just that, $777!!! I dont think I could even convince myself to order that even if I had that kind of $$$.

The food is really good, but for that price I would have rather gone and had a nice steak dinner w/ all the fixings, appetizers and dessert. If you dont mind shelling out over $14 for a burger, I would recommend eating here cause everything we ate was delicious and the service we received was good.",Zy3KuvFENmz2ZT2XtU7ZVg,3,2,4,vtvnXMJ10pyscPAgbpggcw

I stumbled upon this restaurant--attracted to a posted ""special $19.95 combo"": your choice of their standard hamburger or cheeseburger; your choice of fries or onion rings; and a pint of draft beer. I stepped in, curious to see what I might receive. 

The restaurant's complete menu, with pricing, is posted on their website. The bottom line is that regardless of the special pricing, the taste, texture and flavor of the cheeseburger and fries was great. The portions were good enough to satisfy my hunger, without leaving me uncomfortably ""stuffed"".

The staff provided great service. And as I was dining alone at the bar, my bartender/server was a great host-conversationalist in between fulfilling bar orders.

Here's my bottom line: There seems to be a trend in Las Vegas to have burger restaurants affiliated with celebrity chefs.

4810791,2014-04-23,1,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"The menu changed pretty drastically and I'm fully convinced that it's been (gordon) ramsayed. Let me explain what I mean. I've watched enough kitchen nightmares and eaten at Ramsay's burgr to realize that by the time Ramsay is done with a restaurant, the menu becomes short and concise, portions are very exact - just enough to get full, and combos so to speak are non existent. Now I don't know for a fact that Ramsay had anything to do with the drastic changes (it's just my theory), but it sure felt that way.

I enjoyed my food, but honestly, I was really disappointed with the changes. There isn't much unique about this place anymore. Before, they had all sorts of different options for burgers - lamb, salmon, chicken, burgers (even a kobe beef option), and it had sort of a French twist to it. Now, everything was pretty standard for any other high end burger place. I was kind of fantasizing about the lamb burger, so seeing it removed from the menu was kind of tragic to me. It also somewhat annoyed me that about a third of the significantly reduced menu entrees were hot dogs or bratwursts. Not that I have anything against hot dogs, except the name of the restaurant is BURGER Brasserie.

They also used to have combo options, where you could add fries and/or milkshakes at somewhat of a discount as opposed to ordering separately, and those were gone too.

I got the shaft bleu burger and my boyfriend got the french onion burger. Mine was delicious, but there was a bit much bleu cheese for my taste. The french onion was good, but in my opinion, it's pricey for just being gruyere and onions.

We also got the gravy fries and the chocolate nutella milkshake. One thing that I thought was odd was that all the milkshakes on their menu had alcohol, which is fine because I didn't mind the alcohol. But if I didn't want the alcohol, I would have been a bit upset to pay for it and have them not include the alcohol. I liked the nutella shake from my last visit a lot better. Don't know why, but it wasn't as good this time. The gravy fries had really delicious flavor, but unfortunately were a touch too oily for my taste and also, like I said, I feel like it was Ramsayed because the portion was considerably smaller than what I expected (last time when we got bleu cheese fries, the portion was very generous - the bleu cheese fries were also no longer on the menu). I mean I'm not expecting them to be healthy by any means (they're called gravy fries for pete's sake), but I didn't like seeing all the oil seeping out.

Service:
Our waitress (Nicolette) was wonderful. She walked us through the new menu, and came to check on us enough, but not too much and she was very friendly.

The hostesses on the other hand...were just meh...there were three of them that were just kind of huddled around the stand. There was a wait time to be seated, even though there were plenty of open tables. (This might not have been their fault though...I don't know if the restaurant was understaffed or something...I don't know this for sure, but regardless it was still weird to me.) When it was our turn to get seated, they just called out my name. But they didn't call it very loudly and I think it was just chance I heard it, because my boyfriend didn't hear it. There's a water fountain right outside the entrance to BB and there's a lot of people walking through so it's hard to hear. But it seemed like they weren't making a lot of effort.


Overall: I'm disappointed with the changes. The experience this time really was just ok, hence the 3 star rating. There's nothing special about this place that will really cause me to make a special trip anymore.",GXGONxG4EaoipS_sox_87g,1,1,3,eQgkZl-bL5GzT7ZWqSjW7g

The pretzels were 2 hard sticks and 4 soft very large nuggets with 2 dipping sauces, one was a spicy mustard and a very good cheese dip.  My husband ordered the BBQ chicken burger and I built my burger.  He felt the burger was plain as are most chicken burgers but not bad at all.  My burger was a beef burger with mozzarella, sundried tomatoes,  lettuce, and garlic aioli which was delicious...it really hit the spot.

4958083,2016-10-05,1,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"Had a decent lunch at Burger Brasserie on a Thursday.  We arrived around noon and it was not crowded, but certainly busy.  We sat right down and were given the trivia question of the day.  Apparently if you get the question right (which we did) you get 10% off your final bill.  I don't know if they offer you the 10% off if you get it wrong as a nice gesture, but it was a nice little start to the meal.  Our question was about Super Bowl I, and we knew it without using our phones.  No idea if they allow internet-related help in answering the question.

Our server had too many tables, basically half the restaurant, but she did well.  She hustled for refills and beers for us, and we received our food in a fairly reasonable amount of time.  Additionally, she got us the bill and processed the payment quickly.  So, no issues with the service.

To eat, I went with the sliders, which are smaller versions of the cheeseburger (cheese, tomato, pickles), the blue burger (blue cheese, bacon, and garlic aioli) and the Paris burger (blue cheese, grilled onions, and bacon).  Our table also split an order of fries and an order of onion rings, which was enough for 3 people.

The food arrived after about 12 or so minutes.  It was hot and clearly had just been made.  The burgers are small, even for sliders.  And, the meat was thinner than I was expecting.  But, it was cooked properly to medium rare.  The cheeseburger was pretty basic.  My favorite was the blue, but it and the Paris burger were pretty close.  Both had strong tastes of blue cheese and bacon, which is typically a good thing.  I didn't get much of the garlic aioli on the blue burger.  But, I liked them, probably just due to the blue cheese and bacon.

The sides were also fresh, in fact the onion rings were too hot when we first got them.  They are dusted in Cheeto dust and served with what I would describe as a hot Cheeto ranch sauce.  The Cheeto dust was unnecessary but the sauce was really good.  Surprisingly good.  We all liked it and dipped both the onion rings and fries in it.  The server noticed we were running low and offered to bring us more.  Very interesting sauce, and one we all liked.

The fries were standard thin french fries, served with spiced ketchup.  It's not spicy, but it definitely doesn't taste like standard ketchup.  Again, I liked it.  Bruger Basserie does sauces very well in my limited experience.

I can see watching a game here, it is definitely a sports bar type joint.  As far as the burgers go, there are plenty of places on the Strip to get better burgers.  But, I've also had worse on the Strip.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,1,0,3,Oq5my01nalyW72om_WqTQw

Wife and I had been heading out of Vegas that time around noon, and decided we better get sometime to eat. We hadn't had breakfast and to be honest, weren't really all that hungry. I guess that's what a week in Vegas will do to anybody. We actually split the le kobe with crispy bacon on a seasame bun with the waffle fries and the chocolate shake. It was pretty good, maybe we should have had a sauce or spread on it. Didn't realize we had to add sauces for an additional charge. The patty wasn't bad, although I'm sure that guy wasn't made in house. The waffle fries were crispy and hot, however way over salted with the seasoning. The chocolate shake was good too. Nothing out of this world. Actually, we would probably try it again. 

The hostess was actually one of the more friendly out of all the restaurants we dined at this round in Vegas, however our server was hasty and a little insincere. When she picked up our bill, I had wanted to use some hotel credits towards the meal, and remaining balance on my debit card. As I'm trying to explain to her she is still walking off with the check.

After being in & out of the 110+ degree temps outside, we were in desperate need of hydration, so it was extra-annoying that our waiter approached our table a couple minutes after we were seated but then when he was a foot away, he abruptly turned around & headed back into the kitchen for something.

My burger was very good  though I think it's hard to go-wrong with cheese & caramelized onions on something. Another redeeming factor was that I was going thru my iced teas pretty quickly (I had 5 or 6 during the 75 minutes we were there) & the staff --not always our waiter-- did a great job keeping them refilled -- a lifesaver.

Not any sort of view or much ambience inside the place, so we're paying the high prices due to the location on the Strip (again,no view of anything though)  & *perception* that it's a classy! upscale place.  If I'm back on the Strip with friends looking for an upscale burger place, I'd rather try something new, but wouldn't have any major qualms going back to Burger Brasserie -- if you're going to eat on the Strip, you can't be a cheapskate.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,1,0,4,lstrFh8G_m6958PQE_OOeQ

I ordered a hawaiian chicken burger. It was the most digusting chicken burger I've ever tasted. The chicken tasted very artificial, almost like styrofoam or something. It just didn't taste like chicken at all. Sadly, a McDonald's McChicken taste way better, however, I don't like McChickens.  There were small pieces of bones insinde the chicken, so I ended not finishing my burger. Without a doubt, the chicken patty was frozen stuff from Costco or something.  It was very poor value as the burger cost almost 15 dollars yet it came with no fries or anything else.

This place was our last stop for dinner before heading back to the airport this past weekend.  

When we got there around 6, there was a 25 minute wait but after looking inside, we noticed a lot of open tables.  At least 10-15 tables open.  We waited anyways, then after 15 minutes, we asked how much longer and why there are so many tables.  I guess they were severly understaffed... hmmmmmm.

Anyways, the wait time was pretty accurate and we got sat.  Friendly waitress came over and took our order.  I got the burger/fries combo with the regular beef burger.  You get to choose 1 topping, of course i have to choose bacon.  And waffle fries.

Others in our 4-some got the lamb burger, the kobe burger, and some corn chowder.

Everyone enjoyed their food, service was good.  But the restaurant always had the ~10 tables open and the servers didn't seem thattt busy.. oh well.",8-ycEWbiKEwlE96jfyLjpA,0,0,3,6WSNi_d8f8B-YBd5P0u2fA

We were served by the bartender and occasionally one of the waitresses.  The bartenders wore long pants and button-up short sleeve shirts.  The waitresses wore a belt that looked like shorts and a revealing top with push up bras.  The bartender was not hot.  The waitresses were.

We were sitting next to a couple chowdah heads from Massachusetts.  They had lame swagger and were throwing attitude at the bartender which he was tossing right back.

One of them tried to hit on the waitress, offering up his room number.  She scrawled a quick ""0"" on a napkin and handed it to him, replying that his number was zero.

What seems to be so incredible...at Le Burger Brasserie! - Akon (angel)

Located close to the connector between the entrance of bally's and paris shops, is this cool sports bar. It looks upscale but the prices are very reasonable (especially for vegas) and not to mention there's a ton of tv's with a good view from almost every seat in the restaurant. I ordered the classic burger w/ sauteed mushrooms on a toasted sesame bun (they let you choose your bun and toppings) and while the burger was cooked well, the mushrooms were overly salted. It was also somewhat messy to eat, probably should've used a knife/fork now that i think about it lol. The waffle fries (which you have to order separately) were really tasty though so thumbs up for that. I did however enjoy the exciting football game that was on (although disappointed that the seahawks won). One other thing that i would like to mention is that although the menu has alot of french names for their food, it doesn't seem like this restaurant is french inspired at all...more like an american sports bar with a french theme.

SKINNY FRIES - Fab!  Crunchy on the outside, deelish on the inside!  One order feeds 2-3.

ONION RINGS - Nice tower of rings.  Start with the biggest, juiciest ones 'cause you can't eat 'em all!  One order feeds 2-3.

BEER - Our waitress recommended the pale ale from Bend, OR and it was awesome!

SERVICE - Although a lot of reviewers complained about their service, we had nothing but a great server!  Timely, smiley, attentive, and happy!  

PRICE - A GREAT price, especially for a place on the strip inside a nice cool casino with ambiance galor.  (between Bally's and Paris)

BUNS - OMG, I almost forgot the buns!  All of their burger buns are freshly made by them every day.  Holy cow!  Melt in your mouth goodness.

The tower of onion rings was very good and very plentiful - enough for multiple people.

As I walked in the place was fairly empty and when I asked for a table was told there would be a short wait.  After about 10 minutes I was called to the front and taken to a seat at the bar.  I explained to the hostess that I would prefer a table even the small two seater and they reluctantly sat me at a small table nearby next to the bar.

My gut was telling me after this to leave but I was extremely hungry and the menu looked appealing so I hesitantly took the seat at the bar.  My server Christina was friendly enough to begin and took my drink order quickly.  It then took about 10 minutes to get my Pepsi and have my order taken.  I placed an order for the Cilantro Lime Chicken Skewers and they took about 20 minutes to come out from the kitchen.  When my food arrived my drink was near empty but was not offered a refill by the server and instead the bartender (I didn't get his name) saw it and asked what I was drinking and quickly brought me another.  

My server walked by my table about a dozen times or more but never stopped to see how anything was or ask if I needed anything further.  I was not offered any additional items and even had to track down another server to ask for my bill so I could pay and go.  I was at the table for well over an hour for a single Pepsi and skewers (which had decent flavor but lacked anything to put it over the top).  

The pricing was quite reasonable for the food but the flavors were a bit lacking and the service from Christina was as poor as can be for me.  I did notice her larger parties got plenty of attention and service but me being alone seemed to put me in a lower class for service.  I normally tip very well but I was so fed up with this place and the wait that I simply left a $20 on the table and made my way out of the place.

I actually was looking at getting an additional dessert item but was never offered and didn't feel they deserved my business.  Overall the service was a 2 star (the 2nd being the bartender stepping up big time for refills and making sure I was okay when he saw that I was getting frustrated) and the food was actually quite good.

The place may look nice but when you get treated as a second class citizen because you aren't part of a larger party is a bit concerning and I probably would not return in the future.",WecdW6ba1-V2MgR19Mo7cw,7,4,3,3o-gtYMKtxjQ1Pgexsww7Q

While the build your own burgers are without a doubt the star of the show, there is very little on the menu that dissapoints. The cheeseburger mac and cheese bites are delicious, the buffalo chicken dip is savory and rich, and the shakes are creamy with a satisfying edge.

In all my years of coming to Vegas, there is a lot that is overpriced. This place, however, is not one of them. You get what you pay for and then some.

This place by far is one of the better restaurants my wife and I visited while in Vegas. 

We decided to go to this place for lunch on 05/17/13. Since it was later in the evening and we planned on eating dinner in a few hours we thought we would make it a light lunch so we both decided we would order salads.

Our waitress (Who's name was Zenzen yeah I know) was by far the best server we had. She was cheerful, helpful, and very attentive.

She took our orders which was a chopped salad and a grilled chicken ceasar salad. My wife ordered the chopped salad and I had the grilled chicken ceasar salad.

The meals arrived in a reasonable amount of time and not only did they look good and plentiful but both salads tasted delicious as well. I mean my grilled chicken was grilled to perfection and the salad was dressed with just the right amount of ceasar dressing and cheese. And it also had soft croutons (If any of you are like me when it comes to salads then you know it is hard to restaurants that serve salads with the softer croutons because I can't stand croutons that are hard enough to break or chip your teeth). My wife said her chopped salad was also perfectly dressed and seasoned. It was actually so much that she couldn't even finish it.

Overall this place is a must visit if you are ever in the Bally's hotel. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because I didn't order there specialty which are burgers which I can not vouch for. However, the chopped and grilled chicken ceasar salads are top notch.",t5y9jjoa8aednFPyRiPtog,2,2,4,yACwRpGj9PruC4K_Ht-qIw

It was about 5:40 when I sat down at a high top in the bar area and most of the bar seats were taken with the restaurant was about 1/3 full on a Wednesday.  

The bartender came over and greeted me within 2 minutes and I received my drink within 2 minutes of ordering plus my food surprisingly arrived maybe 5-7 minutes after that. 

The burger and fries were tasty and the bartender continued to check up on me appropriately throughout the time I was there. Plenty of TV screens which could feature a number of sporting events (tonight was a variety of baseball teams). 

Music is playing and there is lively conversation but it's easy to talk and hear the person you are with. Tables and booths are available and afford privacy compared to some restaurants which stack the tables together as close as possible.

Burger $13, fries $6 and happy hour 2-4-1 drink another $6 for the two. While yes you can find occasional am discounts here or there or utilize coupons I consider this a very good deal for the strip. I definitely recommend.",GIAu7utkTWoEKrMkO1tG3w,0,1,4,aswWQC6NSUnHNukwgvmIWA

For starters, you have a variety of options to build your own burger. You can pick what kind of bun you want, what kind of cheese, what toppings, etc. My favorite creation is the blue cheese burger on a roasted tomato bun w/mushrooms, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, mayo and ketchup (disgusting I know, but so delicious!).

Things we liked:

The ""grilles"" portobello/peppers/onions/spinach burger (vegetarian) was __amazing__.

The sweet potato fries were standard but good.  I've definitely had much worse.

One of us got a real beef burger, I don't remember which, but she loved it.

The booths are comfortable and the dark wood look is very nice.

The tiramisu was EXCELLENT.

Nicolette was a super guide - friendly, knowledgeable about the options, warm and patient, even though she had way too many tables to handle, and couldn't be around all the time.

Which leads me to things we liked less:

She did have too many tables, we thought.  At these prices, she must be making a fortune, and I support that because she really seemed to care about serving everyone well.  But it did take a while sometimes, and my coffee was cold and then empty before she came by.  I had to ask her for a refill of it.

They don't have any soy or almond milk for coffee.  That stuff keeps longer than regular milk; I wish they'd think to offer it.

I feel like they can't decide whether they're a sports bar or something a little quieter and classier, more like good ol' Hamburger Hamlet (if you know them).  I found being surrounded by TVs seemed a bit distracting, though I really appreciated that the sound was more or less off.  Aside from the TVs, which were out of the way up high on the wall, it was very nice.

The ""le legumes"" burger is a few steps above Morningstar.  The toppings made it very tasty, but the patty is kind of an afterthought.

The espresso shake was really light on the espresso.  It looked so good on the menu!

The paper the burgers were served on seems less pretty than the rest of the theme.  Everything else is in dark rich colors but the paper was borrowed from Johnny Rocket's.  I daresay people will love their food more if they step up the paper.

One of our burgers came with no top bun. (?)  Happily, the recipient was planning on skipping the top bun anyway.  If there are psychics in the kitchen, this should go under ""things we liked"", I suppose.  We never asked for the bun; perhaps the kitchen is still wondering where the extra top bun came from.

The prices are strange, as others have pointed out here.  The main bits are Vegassy medium priced, but all the extras add up and despite our groupon, we ended up spending more than we expected.  On the other hand, the excellent tiramisu was only $5.

That said, if you can get the Groupon, by all means go.  I wish I had another one of those portobello burgers right now.",PsQY0_HOymP8Ad_mbuC5TA,0,0,4,jR-yUUEWIWoCSXk3lwTC3Q

We ordered a couple of draft beers and two burgers, with two fries and a side of gravy.
Our beer was flat, the burgers were okay, and we only received one order of fries (no gravy).  We called over another server (Was ours on break?  We didn't see her for most of our meal) and said that we needed cutlery and another order of fries (and our gravy).  We were told that she would let our server know.  I guess she never did.
My husband had to walk around the restaurant and take cutlery off of other tables.  We decided to just eat our food and forgo the other order of fries, and the gravy.
Towards the end of our meal, the manager walked by us and gave us a thumbs up from across the restaurant.  I guess this was his way of checking in?

That was the only place I would do burgers in Vegas because they were just so good.  Every time I mentioned Burger Bar though, someone would always ask ""Have you been to the burger place at the Paris casino before, it's just as good"".   Well, on my most recent trip to Vegas last month, I finally tried that ""burger place at Paris"".  It's called Le Burger Brasserie and it is very good!

My wife and I stopped in and first noticed that they had a good ""bucket of beer"" special that consisted of 5 or 6 of the larger aluminum beer bottles in a bucket of ice for a decent price.  We naturally started off with that and then ordered our food.  I ordered the Kobe beef burger and my wife went for the turkey burger.  Similar to Burger Bar, they have many different toppings for the burgers (although I don't think they have quite as many options as Burger Bar).  I went with mushrooms and bacon on my Kobe burger.  We also ordered two different kinds of fries, skinny fries and waffle cut fries.  The food came out quickly and we dug right in.  My Kobe burger was wonderful.  My wife's turkey burger was very good too, but I think Burger Bar has a slight edge in the turkey burger category.  The fries though....these were the best fries I have ever had.  Amazingly good!  They had some type of seasoning on them that faintly reminded me of those Hot Fries snacks you find in the chip aisle at the store.  What a great taste.  We ate every last crumb of the fries.

Overall, we had a fun time and a great casual meal here.  Very good burgers and fries.  As far as the competition goes between Le Burger Brasserie and Burger Bar, I still prefer Burger Bar, but this place is close behind them.",h_nErN5SHrDmjKPfplfs_g,0,0,4,LEVGnmfOWZCsLB8EcIxp1w

The food this time was my dissapointment. My boyfriend ordered a BLT and that was average. Seriously how could you mess up a BLT? I ordered the Buffalo chicken dip. The best part of this dish was the pretzel pieces. The chicken dip was overly greasy, unflavorfull, and the chicken tasted bad. That is if you could find the very small chicken pieces.

It's a kobe beef burger, topped with 100 year old balsamic vinegar, imported brie, imported proscuitto, carmelized onions and a lobster tail.

First of all, this burger is very big.  Two of us shared it and were stuffed.  So when you look at it relative to the price, it's the same as having 2 entrees at a normal restaurant.

Secondly, it was the best burger I have ever had.  The beef was so tender and delicious, it melted in your mouth.  Add in the toppings (including the perfectly cooked lobster tail), and it was heaven!!!!

Stopped  in for a quick burger for dinner here figuring how hard is it to mess up a burger when it's actually part of your name, right?  Wrong!  To top it off, they were running a restaurant week special, usually designed to showcase what you can do to promote your restaurant. This was an all around fail. The special offered pita chips and spinach dip, a couple of burger prions which I choose the pastrami burger,and cheesecake for dessert. The dip was good,  unfortunately the pita chips were burnt. Not sure what they were trying to do there.  Then comes the burger. Only the burger in the middle of an otherwise empty plate. Not even garnish.(maybe they were trying to showcase...?)  Basically a pretzel bun, burger cooked a perfect medium-rare, (realty the only good part)  1000 island dressing (aka ""special sauce"") grilled onions and a pile of thick cut pastrami. First on a burger, the thick cut meat was way too much.  Hard to bite thru everything, and since the bun wasn't toasted,  the special sauce soaked thru the bottom turning the whole thing into an over salty (heavy pastrami) mess. Sat at the bar,  was never asked how everything was, not even when they picked up the plates with only half the burger eaten and most of the app left.   After 10 minutes of sitting there with no other service I finally just got the check and left skipping the last part of the dinner which was a piece of cheesecake.  I was never even offered the dessert ...  If this is how they show what they can do for restaurant week,  I'm glad I didn't get any deeper into the menu.  Next time in Vegas if your at Ballys or Paris, this us a definite skip!  To many other options for good food!",ZqCVNoLUXKR2QwUoSgEGAA,0,0,1,T2TbjpF3Ovh6BhOaIXAxQg

However, it was an ordeal to get it.  I sat at the bar and the bartender (who is well known) was just grumpy and inefficient.   He didn't come by our part of the bar for over 20 minutes at one point and everyone was waiting to pay, to order or something.  He has a shtick that he peddles and some people buy it, but you know, I just want to order a drink and a salad.  

It shouldn't take 20 minutes and I shouldn't have to listen to how awful people are or how stupid the POS system is.   Listening to other people complain isn't something I like to do.  And when I'm paying for the privilege, I like it even less.

The burger here is filled with a montreol like steak seasoning and might really appeal to some, but it was just okay to me. The beef is Angus, but I can't remember if they reference a grade of beef.

Burger Brasserie satisfied my craving for beef avec Le Paris Burger: Juicy, medium cooked burger with bacon, brie cheese, and I believe it had some garlic aioli. Also got a side of delicious sweet potato fries, but the burger itself was already enough food for me!

Cooked well, nice and hot, and filling. They also have an assortment of fries, to which I would agree the waffle fries are the best out of the three (and with the ranch for dipping... ugh, let me wipe off some drool!) On top of that, the dessert sliders are really something else! The dessert sliders are shaped like the name, little burger like dessert treats that are sweet and addicting. I would recommend for anyone who does eat here, order the dessert sliders at least once for the experience!

Happy hour is also a great deal at this location, reasonable and a good assortment of drinks to choose from. I've only been here once, but from my first time around I'm interested in coming back again when I'm down that way on The Strip!",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,2,1,4,EJvsq1ulCUYi1mza5s17vw
5806932,2007-10-12,0,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"When chef Hubert Keller opened Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay in 2004, it was a bit of a gamble. How would people react to a gourmet (read: expensive) hamburger restaurant? The answer: with gusto.  Never a town shy about imitation, upscale hamburger joints are multiplying. One of the newbies is Le Burger Brasserie, which professes to be ""a French interpretation of an American classic.""

**The Menu
There are in fact choices other than hamburgers, but I barely noticed them. The emphasis is on burgers. Like Burger Bar, Le Burger Brasserie gives you a choice of basic styles (beef, lamb, vegetarian), and you specify what kind of bun and what toppings you want. The French influence seems to be limited to the copious use of ""Le"" in names.

**The Atmosphere
Pretty typical sports bar. Lots of televisions, fairly informal. Service was friendly and efficient.

**The Meal
I ordered Le Classique (a standard beef hamburger) on a sesame seed bun, with Swiss cheese, pancetta and a fried egg.  To accompany the burger: waffle fries, and a bottomless glass of Pepsi.

The hamburger, ordered medium, was seriously overcooked, with no pink visible and not much juice. However, its flavor was just fine. The fried egg was OK, the pancetta was very good, and the Swiss cheese was...well...Swiss cheese. Overall, this paean to cholesterol was a pretty good hamburger - better than fast food versions, but in no way a gourmet burger.

The waffle fries were crisp, but large enough to still allow for some soft insides. I would have rated them highly, but they didn't have much flavor. They were a lot like the hamburger: pretty good, but not gourmet.

**Summary
If you're in the mood for a decent hamburger, are nearby, and are willing to pay a premium over fast food joints, then stop in. However, given the so-so quality, I'd be inclined to try one of its competitors, in the hope it was better. If you want a great burger, go somewhere else (e.g., the bar at Bradley Ogden).

**The Bill
I neglected to write down the price.  My vague memory is that the burger was about $10, and the waffle fries were $3. To this, add drink, tax and tip.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,3,Q0YCGAe1PHTxnrls5_rXow

2 for food.

Came on a Monday night with a groupon and my total rewards card.  If you have the card, you pay the 1.00 cheaper price for each option.  

Wasn't in the mood for a veggie burger( don't eat beef) and my girl didn't want to split the chicken burger so we ordered some apps and a salad. 

Soft and crisp pretzels with a beer cheese sauce and a beer mustard
tator tots with cheese, speck, green onions
hot dog sliders
chicken cesar salad.

Pretzels 9.00

The pretzels were really disappointing.  They were not soft pretzels, they were pretzel BUNS.  The same freaking buns that the hot dogs sliders were served on.  Oh, I can't forget the 2 pretzel rods that were on the plate( the crisp selection).  Very expensive for a some pretzel rolls and 2 pretzel rods.  The cheese sauce and mustard were very boozy( good if you like beer).  We took the rods with us, tried to eat them the next day by the pool and they were staler than shit. 

Tots 9.00
These weren't so much tots as they were leftover mashed potatoes, zushed up with cheese, ham, and green onions. Then, mold them into a large tater tot shape and throw them in the deep fryer.  Did not like these at all.

Salad

Lots of chicken, not that much cheese, croutons, dressing.  Basic, 14.00

Hot dog sliders

Smallish dogs, wrapped in bacon, thrown on a pretzel roll that was slathered in margarine, topped with small fried onions.  I didn't eat these( don't eat beef), my wife said they ""ok""

Maybe we should have gotten a burger?  We might have fared better.  They were running a special, a make your own burger, fries or rings and a soda for 25.00.  They only carry pepsi products so that didn't sound good to us.   

We had a groupon, 20 for 40.00.  We spent 1 extra dollar, plus tax and a generous tip since service was really good.

I like the layout of the restaurant and the decor. I like the music they play and the fact that you could watch sports. Even though I like the outfits the staff wears, call me crazy, but the little shorts the females wear could be a tad less short since personally I don't like being eye level with their cellulite thighs and buttcheeks while I'm having a meal. Once again, maybe if I were an ""assman"" this would have been a non-issue. 

The bib lettuce, Gruyere and apple salad is DELICIOUS. It has the most fantastic mustard dressing. A stand out burger for me was the one with caramelized onions, bacon and brie on a caramelized onion bun. I like that you get to build your own burger if you wish and that you have multiple types of buns, toppings and sauces to choose from. My favorite burger here has been the lamb burger! I have also tried the fries, buffalo wings and banana bignets. All top-notch. This is an all around solid establishment!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,2,1,4,Bn-oAjgIVeAHFmfkaXIDww
5976027,2012-09-10,0,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,Went here recently with a couple and their child. The women wore these small vests representing each NFL team (I think mine was some secondary team that people don't care about). The waitress was so average and boring. She was annoyed that we did not have players cards and she acted like we didn't belong. My friend got the veggie burger and liked it well enough and I got a burger. Couldn't have been too awesome since I do not remember the type but it was a little dry. The beer selection sucked and I think I walked out of there over $30. Just average fro Vegas.,X0X3hiKv5CigUec1XYi_pg,0,0,3,rMTY-mqFw1kX9gJcNqHo7w
5988342,2007-09-12,0,AjWFFZN8KwyqJzzi0DyEsw,"Something about the word ""Frites"" intrigues my db and I for some strange reason.  We can't help but think anything with ""Frites"" must be better.  In fact, while we were in Vegas for 2.5 days and we had Frites at least 3 times...(mind you, we only had 5 meals in vegas)

Anyways, we wanted something simple and I haven't had a burger in ages. Looked like a fancy place from far, but from looking at the menu, it  was reasonable and they served FRITES. Too bad you have to order it in addition to your burger - so less one star for that.

Our server wasn't the most friendliest and most attentive. He wasn't mean or anything, just a little stale.  In fact, I was a little jealous of the tables around us because their waiter was so friendly and personable. I remember thinking ""I wish we had him.""

I've had better burgers elsewhere like Armadillo Willys (at half price burger Saturdays) or Red Robin.  Frites were ok, may be a little too crunchy  all shoe string like for my taste.  I kinda like soft hot centers.

Not sure I'll be running back to this place.  It sure was convenient though cuz my feet were killing me from wearing high heels the night before and we were staying at Ballys.",6esVcPs_-ijZit2yAR2uGQ,1,0,3,WyqdqaoyQM4_RYbdVBp49Q
