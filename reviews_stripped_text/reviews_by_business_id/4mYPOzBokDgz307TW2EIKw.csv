The Stratosphere as a hotel is what it is: decidedly average, geared toward the guest trying to enjoy Vegas on the cheap. The Courtyard Buffet should be an affront to any guest's sensibilities. It is undeniably the worst buffet in a city loaded with buffets, and one of the worst I have ever experienced. I only ate at the buffet because I had a free voucher as part of a promotion. 

I felt very alone in the dining room surrounded by the host of aged gamblers and tacky tourists taking a break from the tables and slots and eat their one meal of the day; they seemed more interested in the Keno numbers than the slop on their plates. I cannot blame them for liking the food; I am not sure that anyone of them knew better. I would never eat here again--even if it were free.

Wide variety of food- they have a station with breakfast breads and pastries, a fresh egg/omelette station, as well as a vast array of other foods: Chinese (fried rice was awesome), Mexican, Italian (decent lasagna), and a carving station with turkey and ham. They had plenty of crab legs available, although they are cold, and I prefer them warm. There's a huge dessert island with lots of different cakes, pies, cookies, and tarts. I particularly enjoyed the tiramisu! 

Service was awesome. Our waiter was the most pleasant server I've ever had at ANY buffet.

I came here with my partner during the week of Christmas. We were staying at the Stratosphere and wanted to try a buffet, but unbeknownst to us, every buffet jacks their price up during Christmas week. Luckily The Buffet didn't increase its price at all, it was very cheap comparatively, and it was right down stairs.

I read the reviews on Yelp and it greatly deterred us from going right away. We discussed where to go if not here, but after much debate still decided to go with Stratosphere's buffet. We walked in cautiously, expecting it to smell, or have poop covering the walls, or for there to be awful people eating there after reading the awful reviews. Fortunately there was none of that. The place was relatively empty and everyone eating there looked normal. 

A server quickly arrived at our table to take our drink order. I got a cranberry juice. I got up for the food and immediately walked over to the breakfast (we went for the brunch). Breakfast food is number 1 in my book. I'll admit that The Buffet doesn't have the largest variety of breakfast food, but what they did have was some pretty nice choices.

I grabbed a biscuit, threw a sausage patty on top (patties over links for me) and then smothered it in biscuit gravy. I took a scoop of the chorizo + scrambled egg combo, picked up some French toast, rested an eggs Benedict on my plate, and then piled on the bacon. When I got back to my seat there was a my giant cup of cranberry juice.

The sausage and chorizo was great. The eggs were a little over cooked (common at buffets) but the chorizo had tons of flavor. The eggs Benedict was delicious! The hollandaise sauce wasn't too overpowering and it didn't have a funky taste to it like I sometimes get. It was creamy and the egg was perfectly poached. When I stabbed it all the yolk poured out. The French toast was a little bland and it wasn't fluffy. Needless to say I wasn't a fan of that. The bacon was perfectly cooked to my taste. Not rubbery and not too crispy where it tastes like a salt lick. My definite favorite was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuit was soft with a crispy outside and the gravy was rich with that smoky flavor in it. The sausage patty that I put on top just completed the combo and made it a favorite for me. I immediately ran back up and grabbed seconds of everything I liked.

After having seconds of the breakfast food I scouted the lunch/dinner food. There was much more variety when it came to that, but still not huge amount. A lot of the food looked tasty, but because I was already three-quarters full, I had to pick and choose. The mac and cheese looked good, and I got some ham. The mac and cheese was tasty, but very typical (nothing wrong with that) but the ham was too dry. It was a little leathery which was most likely from it sitting out and no one eating it due to there not being a lot of people.

I can't say I ate a lot of dessert, but I grabbed a cookie and cake. Both were very typical and average. They had a good amount of choice surprisingly along with an ice cream machine. My partner loved the desserts and had a huge plate full of them.

Overall I thought the buffet was great. It had a the most affordable price at the time when compared to other buffets, the breakfast food was delicious, and the whole place was pretty clean. It lacked in variety though. I walked away sickeningly stuffed and very happy with our decision to give it a try.

I was pleasantly suprised though - I was able to get some steel cut oatmeal with brown sugar and granola on top, breakfast potatoes loaded with onions, bell peppers, guac, and salsa as well as a plate-ful of fresh fruit and sourdough toast. The meal came with unlimited champagne but I didn't drink. If you do - you'll definitely get your money's worth. The way I see  it - if we had gone somewhere like a divey diner I would've spent the same amount, possibly more, if I ordered seperate sides and orange juice/coffee. The wait staff was nice, she brought us our coffee and orange juice, as well as champagne for my friend.

They offer EVERYTHING from breakfast to crab legs to pastries to cookies to pasta to burritos to salads. It's an overwhelming amount of food.

There are several stations to choose from and a nice variety of desserts including an ice cream machine.

If you come in expecting a Four Seasons type buffet, of course you will be disappointed.  I stayed at the Stratosphere and tried the dinner buffet once ($21) at 4pm and breakfast buffet  ($18) once around 8am.    Both were totally acceptable and fine.  At dinner I tried the Mexican bar, the Chinese bar and Dessert section.  Pork tamale was flavorful, there were flour tortillas, condiments, etc.   Chinese food (fried rice, chicken wings, beef, noodles, etc.) was good---beef  and chicken were very tender (I was pleasantly surprised).  I was especially surprised by the dessert bar.  Cake was moist, as were the cookies and bread pudding.  At breakfast I tried the chorizo eggs, various types of hash, biscuit with gravy, a dollar sized pancake and french toast.  Biscuit was fairly dry but that is not a surprise at any buffet but the pancake, while not made to order, was also nicely soft.  

I am frequent patron of high end buffets in LA  which cost $70-$100 per person (Four Seasons, Ritz, etc.).  Stratosphere is of course not on that level, but it IS a great bargain at $21.

1)First all other hotels give discount to their guest at the buffet, except for these guys. It was only $20 but after the garbage they served. They should charge no more than $5, maybe even free.
2) All of their food is either out of a can, bag or box. There are no chefs their and you can tell by taste and presentation that the food was not prepared by any chef.
3) OLD FOOD, AS IN A FEW DAYS OLD AND REHEATED. You can tell by looks, texture and taste the food is more than a day old. The food is supposed to be fresh but you won't find that here.
4) Lack of staff, there is one person in the entire buffet to attend all the tables. This little lady, she clears the tables, brings the drinks etc all the above and more. And the rest of the folks are walking around from dishwasher to dining area. 
5) Prepare for the bubba gutts lol. Really you will be on the toilet within five minutes after leaving and most likely loose your appetite halfway through.",agP0ztPFhU715H5c6cHYJw,2,1,1,oAoU9X3LoDiSD0IFLdqPIw

From not having croutons out for simple salad, to the lack of meat they offered. (NY strip steak) friend chicken and some assorted fish. No seafood except a small dish of sushi, No eel sauce. No crab legs. Lack of service for drinks. Desserts were stale.",V2kw7jG-4J7CflHm0guxpg,1,0,1,tReQIoRPyX-hJyquMPY3eQ

The buffet is certainly not Waterfront or Borgata Buffet-like but they do have a decent selection of carved meats and veggies. I came here for Breakfast and the breakfast was OK as I had the french toast, eggs and sausage. The dessert options were disappointing.",jjSG0aHEwL-mFQQtkTNjHQ,0,0,3,W8EoYQOZ7RWWA3HTHYFPbQ

I had the creamed corn soup, it was way too thick. It was more like thick gravy than soup. Their sushi, forget it. The entrees were just below average overall. Will never come back.",NIRscyJstCqMzBt0IyWsWQ,0,0,2,xbKHi5RD-jBTFBw_pfy1rg

At $20 a pop, it was absolutely not worth it.  Kids are the same price; we should have gone to their burger joint.  If I had more time, I wanted to try the buffet at The Cosmopolitan, but we had to head back to Primm.  Of all places, I figured Statosphere would have a decent spread, NOT!  Everything was salty, the potstickers were probably from Costco Ling Ling's, total blah & big disappointment!",5UDpc2CMOgbf3GePS6SGVA,2,2,1,US0smtUBHSFW7UcoIyd2Tw

We have an orange card and rec'd $5 off I believe per person.  Plus Stratosphere sent me a buy 1 get 1 buffet coupon (along with some other offers).  So we gave it a shot because it was only $16 and change for the 2 of us.  It was VERY good.  The made to order omlettes were very good.  There was a lot to choose from.  With drinks included and having a couple of mimosas, you couldn't beat it!  Now, would I pay $20 plus tax per person???  Probably not.  But if you have an offer or get the $5 off its a pretty good deal and was not busy at all for a Sunday morning!",5WfazfTVJBRIWJWGCZpE5A,1,0,4,T2hBryc7WklcxFKLv-zdJg

5945332,2016-09-04,0,4mYPOzBokDgz307TW2EIKw,Expensive and the selection was really sad for a hotel buffet. definite lack of seafood... the desserts are the reason why it gets 2 stars. Lots of selection even though it was mediocre. I would not come here again since i can get better food for less else where.,v5TqRI7jBwKglVmaEBEPPg,0,0,2,RuAlJGC0-mKt8ovEfi8obQ

When you walk in the buffet line seems like it would have a lot of food selection because of its size but when you actually get in there you don't end up with a whole lot of choices. I'm a desert person and I didn't like a thing on the desert buffet.
The dinner buffet wasn't too terrible but with all your choices in Vegas I wouldn't stop here again.",O47958lYja38dwX1ZyVkhQ,2,0,2,9QCXfmUqMtZUQJPwpHEZFg
5988773,2017-07-27,0,4mYPOzBokDgz307TW2EIKw,"Very underrated buffet. Went for dinner. The choices were endless. So much stuff, everything hot & fresh. Nothing I tried I didnt like. Workers were fast and friendly, place is so clean and price are reasonable for vegas buffet standards now a days. I had a free aria buffet which is like 45 bucks. Everything was terrible, food dry and not warm. Left after 15mins. Thank god It was free.Stratospheres buffet was 22 and was 100x better. Jyst shows you newer, fancier and expensive isn't always better. Will keep returning here .",kRJjMqJuO4w6QTVWuSz45g,0,0,5,CYbrkd7p9JSXgUym9b8DOw
