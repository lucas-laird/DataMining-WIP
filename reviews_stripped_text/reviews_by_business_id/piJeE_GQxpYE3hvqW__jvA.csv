My girlfriend, uncle and I were seating down waiting to get service but that service never arrived. We waited for at least 13 minutes and no one ever came to ask us if we needed? water, food or anything. If they would have been busy or if there would have been not enough employees, I would understand. But that was not the case, they had plenty of workers and the place was not full at all. Every body else around us were getting served no problem, we decided to leave since no one really cared to talk to us. When we were walking out, no one and if there was anything wrong or anything, they just looked at us like whatever.

Atmosphere:
It has a very upbeat vibe. The pictures on the wall sets the mood for great conversations and deep questionings...what came first ..the chicken or the Egg? Seriously, the question did come up! There are pics of chicken and eggs in the Cracked Egg, as well as the picture hanging over my table which read, ""BE NICE or LEAVE...THANK YOU"". So the atmosphere was great. 

Very well Attended:
We noticed that there were a lot of people there on a Wednesday morning at 9 am, which is a great sign so we ventured in. What really drew me there was the potential of having Pumpkin Coffee Cake. Unfortunately for me, that doesn't start until next month. I was informed that OCTOBER IS PUMPKIN MONTH! YaY! I'll be Back! 

Fortunately for me, I did try the hot Apple Cinnamon coffee cake and that was so delicious and hot out of the oven.

I ordered a basic skillet meal which was delicious and very filling. I had to take half the food home..maybe the coffee cake was the culprit, but seriously, one must have cake first!

Wait Staff: Attentive
The overall experience was really sweet. Great people watching, plenty of tables and really sweet wait staff. My coffee was always warm.. I will return for that Pumpkin Coffee Cake for sure!!

However, there was one particular aspect of having breakfast here that has induced me to write a very negative review. The food (and the quality of the food for the value) was pretty mediocre, which would normally earn about a 3 star review from me. But my experience with a staff member working the cash register has earned this location something else. After finishing my breakfast, never having dined here before, I was unsure if I was supposed to pay the check to my waitress at the table, or I was expected to carry the check up to the cash register myself to pay. After waiting at the table for 5-10 minutes, I reckoned I should walk the check up to the front counter to pay. Upon reaching the cash register, I asked a young woman in her twenties behind the counter  - ""should I pay here?"" - to which she promptly replied while motioning back toward the rear of the restaurant - ""No, you should pay it back there - in the bathroom."" Okay, a young aspiring comedienne, not smiling at all, deadpan delivery, got it. I shrugged the comment off, smiled, and proceeded to pay the check. Upon completing the transaction, she once again went for the jugular - ""Next time you come here, pay the check in the bathroom, see how far that gets you."" Okay, that was a little bit TOO rude, inappropriate, and no longer funny by anyone's standards. While I was driving away, I was a little bit stunned that someone would be so pointedly mean-spirited not once, but twice. I contemplated driving back there and berating this young woman, but decided against it, vowing only never to frequent the restaurant again. Management should absolutely dismiss her. One or two of her fellow women coworkers were within earshot of this whole episode, and likely recall it, should management wish to take action.",ip4dmZ5Vy_pUrIoO1J-uRA,0,0,1,AUs3VAkYf09ElnAwmQbRFA

On this visit I brought my family. My son was begging for room service but since he decided to wake up at 6 am I decided to drag them out for a real breakfast. Service was excellent! Ordered drinks and they were out before I could check in on yelp. The coffee here is really good. I like the mugs they serve in. 

Kids menu is simple and all of the items are inexpensive. The kids each wanted an order of chocolate chip pancakes but I think they could have split an order because the pancakes are a good size and dense; 7 yr old had 1 and 5 yr old had .75 of 1. 

Wife ordered the garden veggie omelette, $9.85. Comes with choice of hash browns or house potatoes, and choice of toast or coffee cake. Do yourself a favor and splurge on the coffee cake. It's a whole lot of food. I went with the sweet potato skillet, $10.75. Has the same options as the aforementioned meal. All that food was only $41+$10 tip. One of my favorite breakfast spots.

Right now the coffee cake has gingerbread cream cheese filling, probably a seasonal thing because of Xmas time. Last time I was here in summer the regular coffee was just as good. 

Stop by for breakfast if you are hanging out by red rock. They do have several of these establishments around Vegas. Hope you get to try it out. Happy eating!",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,5,4,5,46stDurx_K_6WyNEGgsubQ

I found myself piling on the salt and pepper to give it flavor. My boyfriend ordered the south shore scramble with egg whites. His ended up being mainly cheese and chicken. The portions were decent sized but they lacked substance and flavor. My hash browns were a tad greasy and sat very heavy in my stomach all day. Bacon was too crispy. The customer service was good though. 

There's too many unique breakfast places in Vegas to go back to the Cracked Egg.

It was not enough to have my opinion changed. I think if I was to go to the cracked egg the one on Cheyenne is where I would go.

It tasted okay but did not look very appetizing on the plate.  It looked like a pinkish mash. The tortilla chips were also mushy. It seemed like they were trying to make a healthier version of chilaquiles, but the execution was so so. Still, it was eatable. My husband had the carnitas omelette which was fine. Our friends two of the skillets and the eggs Benedict. All of which were also fine. The best part of the meal was the coffee cake that they offer as a side. It's served warm with a sugar glaze on top. This place is an okay breakfast option if your favorite place is too packed. I think the wait that we experienced was because this is a new place.

Luckily, either I visited at a good time of day, or they worked out the initial kinks in service, because I had a lovely experience.  The restaurant is bright and cheerful, with a semi-open kitchen. There are several large booths and tables throughout, as well as patio seating (no dogs allowed, the sign is pretty prominent). 

I was seated promptly, my drink order was taken right away, and my server checked on me throughout the meal. I enjoyed my Californian omelette, which was served with a choice of home fries, hash browns, or fruit along with a choice of toast or coffee cake. Next time, I will definitely get the coffee cake, because it looked great. I was able to sample a piece (my friend got the coffee cake), and it was really yummy. Apparently, they have different varieties daily. Prices were reasonable, with most items averaging between $10-$12.

FOOD:
The Enchilada -- Had just the right mixture of ingredients.  The sauce to pepper to tortilla to egg ratios complemented one another exquisitely without overpowering each other.  The hash browns were crispy (at our request) and tasty.  The coffee cake side was warm, sweet and delicious.

Croissant French Toast -- very tasty.  The bread was a little chewier than I'd hoped for but in retrospect, some croissants are chewy so I'm not sure this is avoidable.  The berries were absolutely delectable - fresh and full of flavor.

I don't need a menu!  Seriously, you've gotta order their country benny.  The yolks are perfect and creamy (I'm salivating thinking of it now- it's almost pornographic!) thanks to a perfect cook every time!  The gravy has just the right amount of sausage, plus no paprika or green chiles or any other weird additions that you'll find in other breakfast joints.  The biscuits are always fluffy (once I had rock hard biscuits and they replaced them immediately) and I just love the rich combination of yolk, gravy, biscuit, and sausage.  I wish they were open 24/7, but I'm saving more money by only going in the mornings.

The coffee cake is fresh baked and always delicious.  I've never tried any of the cream cheese types, though (no thanks).  I've sampled some other things on the menu, but only when my boyfriend orders because I just cannot part from my one true love, the country benny.

We got seated immediately at a two top, although the weather was lovely enough to sit outside. The menu averages as a basic breakfast and lunch place with a traditional coffee cake offered as a side. 

My boyfriend ordered a classic eggs & bacon which is served with toast and potatoes and I was split between the Ole Benedict and chili skillet, choosing the latter. The food came out quick and hot within 5 minutes! 

Our waitress was decent if you include the business of the restaurant. Helpful and gave us attention when needed. Overall the food was great, enough cheese to satisfy the best fanatics. But nothing over the top in quality to make me a regular.

2716904,2015-11-13,2,piJeE_GQxpYE3hvqW__jvA,"Rock solid and consistently good.  While not my favorite breakfast place in town, it's probably the one I go to the most because it's the perfect blend of convenience, tasty food and an always friendly staff.

Location.  Parking right at the restaurant can be difficult.  If you dont strike gold and find a spot in front of the restaurant, just park in the large lot that spans the front of the shopping center facing Charleston Blvd.  Getting into the parking lot is easy, but getting out can be tricky depending on where you're trying to go.  The Charleston - Hualapai intersection can be a challenge.

The Food.  As mentioned, the food is consistently good.  Over time I've tried all but one of the omelettes (the Carnitas is my favorite), three of the ""scrambles"" (try the Southshore Scramble for something mild, or the Southwest Scramble for a little zing), and three of the Eggs Benedict (the traditional Eggs Benedict is my favorite, with a side of bacon).  They also have amazing salads for a breakfast place.  I've never ventured into the pancakes, french toast or other similar breakfast items because I love eggs for breakfast enough that I never seem to stray away from them.  My wife and friends routinely get these other items though and have never been unhappy.

If you have a gluten sensitivity, there's a significant menu for you as well, so dive in!

The Staff.  In the end, the Cracked Egg is a large chain, and there are a number of similar breakfast chains out there.  I've been to a few.  (I might like breakfast.)  Big chain restaurants are..well, big chains and honestly it's hard for me to give them a rating higher than a three.  In fact, I usually don't review them unless they stand out for some reason.  In this case, the staff at this Cracked Egg location is what makes this a four star review.  So go, enjoy the food, and let the staff take care of you.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,3,5,4,2fwukyxomzK5_ybQWH3Ghw

Who doesn't love cool names for the items they order? Some probably find it cheesy (no pun intended) but I love the creativeness! You get an option of potatoes, toast and coffee cake with any of the omelet's. Since I was already drooling over the previous YELPER's pics of the coffee cake I went with that of course! Something cool that they do is change the flavor of them every so often. Mine just happened to be apple! Yum! When our food arrived everything looked and tasted great! I had to give them a couple extra brownie points for nailing my request for egg whites on the omelet! Majority places NEVER get it correct and I always have to end up sending it back. Can't be trying to kill me with all that cholesterol! 

Check out was great! Our cashier was friendly just like everyone else we encountered that morning! Asked how our dining experience was and even welcomed us back as soon as possible! I noticed as I was paying for our breakfast that they have a rewards program and when I fill this form out I could get $8 off the next breakfast! I can't wait to return!

The few downsides of it, is I went on a Sunday at 11am and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table.  I don't know why they have such a small location for the business that they do?!   The service is a tad on the slow side, but they do get the orders right, so that's not a big deal.  However, if you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  It is in a busy shopping center to begin with, so the parking can be a bit of a challenge.

I wanted to take my boyfriend to breakfast for his birthday so I looked up some places since we are from out of town, and I decided to come here. The menu had a bunch of delicious options from peanut butter French toast to croissant egg sandwich. The variety of egg Benedicts caught my eye so I decided on the Veggie one with avocado, spinach and grilled tomatoes and my boyfriend chose the Pastrami Benedict and an order of chocolate chip pancakes. 
My order was a beautiful display and tasted even better than it looked. I enjoyed every single bite! My boyfriend loved his dish as well and we could barely get into the pancakes since we were quite full with our benedict plates. Price was reasonable for the amount of food and service was great, very friendly waitress and bright, welcoming, cute decorative setting.

The coffee cake was tasty however, have you ever microwaved coffee cake and it is really hot in the center plus has a feel that screams microwaved? It was kind of like that. I would rather have a piece of warm coffee cake that did not pass through a microwave(just seems like it did).

My meal was very tasty but the shredded pork in the Rancheros had hard edges like it had been sitting out.

Lastly, when we walked in and asked for a booth, the hostess gave us a gas face as if by asking for a booth we were throwing off the table rotation by not taking a two top.

3870362,2016-11-10,1,piJeE_GQxpYE3hvqW__jvA,"To start off, some of the complaints people have about this place are ridiculous. One person complained they don't have wifi. Is your company or ADHD really that bad that you can't hold a conversation with them? Is multi tasking really that much more important than sitting back and relaxing for 45 mins? What could you possibly be doing that's so important that you really need wifi for anyway? And no. If I'm there trying to enjoy a meal on the patio, I don't want someone's dog there, regardless of breed or size. Unless it's a service dog, why would you expect to bring it everywhere like an accessory? I'm sure they would rather lose the one customer that was butthurt they couldn't bring their animal to breakfast instead of losing three or four customers that would want a dog there. As for the service complaints, there are no complaints from me. I came for a quick breakfast with my mom. Everything came out fast and hot. We were asked if we had everything we need and if we needed anything else, let her know. Then we were left alone to eat and have a conversation without the server coming by every few minutes interrupting us asking if we needed anything. If I we did need anything, we would have gotten her attention and communicated with her instead of rearranging some dishes on the table and hope that she could read our minds that we needed something specific. 
My mom got a veggie skillet which looked good, but not my type of thing. Plus I was craving their chocolate chip banana pancakes which definitely hit the spot. I also had scrambled eggs and sausage patties which you can't really mess up. If you think the food is bland, there is not much to do about that. It's all about personal preference and restaurants can't please everyone. They aim to please as many as they can, usually. Other places do what they do regardless of people's opinions. But that's usually certain types of food. Overall I've never had a bad experience here, and I would definitely go back. As for the price, meh, not too cheap or expensive. If you say you'd rather go to Mcd's then so be it. That's another case of opinion. Maybe you prefer that peculiar Mcd's flavor that's in all of their products. I'm not sure what that is, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.",q5j3gxZbF_qCviRctL9wzg,0,1,5,X1v5_ou9ymZjK-yDGxiwOw

The service was great! There are a ton of menu selections yo choose from.

We got the corned beef hash, north shore scramble and the kids got chocolate chip pancakes.

The north shore scramble was ok, if you like onions then this is the one for you. We don't like onions THAT much so we didn't care for it. 

The kids liked their chocolate chip pancakes. It tasted like any other chocolate chip pancake. Nothing special. It was just the pancakes, no fruit or meat option unless you order a side order.

In less than five minutes, my server brought the skillet over and it looked great!  It also tasted that way.  The chicken pieces were real chicken--not formed chicken.

Based on Yelp research I chose The Cracked Egg because it has generated some good reviews and was very close to my hotel. My server, Tabitha greeted me with a smile and, very considerately, steered me to a larger table in the nearly empty restaurant. at 6:45 a.m., instead of compelling me to sit at a smaller table as many other places do. She provided the restaurant's extensive menu promptly and simultaneously took my order for coffee. The coffee was good and she diligently re-filled my cup until I cried uncle.I ordered two Blueberry Pancakes after she patiently explained that I had the option of ordering one, two or three, which the menu did not make evident.

The pancakes, unfortunately, tasted dry and leaden.They were not fluffy and light. They were hard to eat.They could not stand up to the excellent blueberry pancakes that I have had at Blueberry Hill restaurants during prior trips to Vegas. Perhaps the recipe can be tweaked because this is a family, and not a corporate, restaurant?

Prior to my leaving, Tabitha let me know where I could find some much needed cold medicine.It is the combination of her excellent service, the fact that my food experience diverged so much from the majority and the likelihood that I did not order the correct item that explains my decision to award an extra star.These factors would induce me to try The Cracked Egg again if I stay at Red Rock in the future.",MZe_LcXsXv-U7y8Oa6RPVg,3,1,3,zaE8q2IwXkTFl8sr_HGjng

Our waitress was very sweet and immediately brought us coffee. And offered us a nice warm strawberry coffee cake very yummy  I had an omelette of spinach mushrooms & Munster cheese it was very good. Although a lot of melted cheese. Which our waitress noticed I was scrapping off. And asked if I would like another one without . I said it was fine just the way it was ! Coffee kept coming .

To Whom It May Concern:

I live very near the new Cracked Egg restaurant at Charleston and Hualapai. My inquisitive 3-year-old daughter watched with great anticipation as the new ""muffin store"" was being built, and the morning of 4/27/14 I took her there (she was very excited). I would normally bring my wife and 1-year-old son, but my wife was home sick with a cold.

What followed was the worst customer service experience of my life. Given the recent opening of the restaurant, wait staff and hostesses were understandably unpracticed and the operation wasn't running as smoothly as I expect it will over time. However, when I complained to the manager about needlessly waiting for 15 minutes after it was our turn to be seated, a man approached me, and with no introduction or conversation, promptly escorted me out the front door (my 3-year-old daughter riding on my hip), and rudely and loudly told me to ""get in my car, leave, and never come back."" I encouraged him to listen to me, his customer, and he rudely told me ""look around, are you the only one here with an infant?"" 

I'm not a loud, large, or scary-looking man; in fact, I'm a 47-year-old, well-respected member of the business community. I serve on two high profile community boards, and own and operate a small, local business. Suffice it to say, I've never been banned from any establishment, and found the whole experience horrifying, especially in light of having my young daughter with me.

The saddest part of this experience is my 3-year-old daughter now speaks (unsolicited) about the ""bad man at the Cracked Egg who wouldn't let us have pancakes and bacon."" She shouldn't have to worry about facing hostility at any of our neighborhood establishments. It's shameful.

Sincerely,
Jeff G.",eKa8oxv3BFHzln6U2os6gw,13,2,1,MyJ0FZNGzIbnFh3i59BJzA

So the original plan was to go to the new Egg Works in Summerlin, but my friend actually drove us to this joint which also recently opened.  

Saturday brunch - 25 min wait.  Well, let me take this time to walk over to Smiths and buy cookies and Cheez its.  At least there was something to do during the wait.

I give the food 5 stars.  All the dishes were super good.  We ordered:
- California omelette: bacon slices wrapped in an omelet with a sliced avocado on top, served with seasoned potatoes and choice of coffee cake or toast
- Hot Pastrami sandwich on a roll.  There were some bacon slices and cheese.  The seasoned fries were DELICIOUS, very seasoned and tasty.  Crispy, not soggy.
- Nutella french toast topped with mini marshmallows and graham crackers.  We thought this dish would be too sweet for one person's meal, so we shared.  Right amount of Nutella, it wasn't lacking.  Didn't even need to really dip in syrup bc it was sweet.  Only ate half of it.

Service was not the greatest, hence the 1 star deduction.  The coffee cake was never brought out, so we asked the waitress to pack it to-go for us.  We waited a while for the check.

I will definitely go back, but I hope the service is better.  If only this were Egg Works and they had that yellow egg on the table to notify servers when we need assistance.",SAPltgfFSgI1K9aUuOWcXw,4,2,4,DYWNwPWAwGcwJ9omovRJlA

A sure flavor explosion mejicano style.  Make sure to chose the coffee cake as your side of carb if you want to reach a state of bliss.  Coffee usually not as solid as I like so you have to request multiple cups.  Spacey service but eh.

5523357,2016-08-01,0,piJeE_GQxpYE3hvqW__jvA,"Our first trip & it was awesome! Our waitress, Cory, was super attentive and knowledgable of the menu. When I asked about the corned beef she assured me it was yummy and then went a step further and said if I didn't like it she would bring me something different! A+ customer service for sure. Honey had a ""big bad wolf"" omelette and it was perfect. The corned beef hash skillet was amazing - fresh cut corned beef cooked with the peppers, onions & potatoes. None of the greasy, overseasoning of most breakfast places. I did like the seasoned potatoes better than the hash browns. One of the highlights of this breakfast place was our toast. Pre-buttered, perfectly toasted bread & they had mixed fruit jelly. Truly awesome! If our next trip is this good, it will become a regular spot for us! 

Edit: too good to be true. 2nd visit. Our waitress, Natalie,  is awful. Dropped the check before she asked how we are doing. Slow on water refills. It's crowded again, but not too long a wait. Monte Cristo is terrible. Cheese isn't even melted. Both ham and chicken are still cold. I may just be spoiled by better sandwiches I've had other places, but the potatoes are on point. Honey had an omelette again, but the almost $3 up charge for sour cream and bell peppers is saddening. Our birthday girl had plain buttermilk pancakes & she is chomping away. Overall, I'm sad this place didn't live up to our expectations from our last visit & we won't be back any time soon. 

Gave it some time & gave them another try. This visit was much better. Coffee cake is great (red velvet) & our food was cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Andi, was great! Honey had the green scramble & he really liked it! Lots of veggies & th green sauce is awesome.",n1cGg7NpJspFPUcyYO4lzw,1,0,4,m6e3LaCa8HR7wVEBbAV-tw
5546935,2016-09-26,0,piJeE_GQxpYE3hvqW__jvA,"The overall attitude of this place seems catering to an elderly consumer base.  They don't offer wifi and this is explained by a sign that says ""we don't have wifi, talk to eachother and pretend it's 1995, an obvious affront to younger more connected individuals who like to multitask while enjoying a morning meal.  

Our server seemed timid though he did well trying to personalize our guest experience.   it could be argued that the entire exchange was awkward and lacking a sunniness that one might find in someone with more experience.  We ordered our food and had to ask for more creamer, even though we placed the empty creamer container on the edge of the table.  

I ordered the low fat scramble and my partner ordered the veggie skillet.  I had the coffee cake as my bread and my partner ordered the sourdough toast.  

The lowfat scramble was actually delicious.  I would recommend ordering it with no salt.  This is how I ordered it and the dish was delectable!  There was chicken and tortilla chips which were not crispy because they were mixed into the scramble.  Not sure if they were meant to be crispy but it tasted good the way it was served.  The coffee cake was not very good at all.  It was actually a cherry jam coffee cake with white sugar frosting.  I wasn't expecting this for coffee cake in my limited experience is a plain sometimes cinnamon spiced pastry to sweeten your cup of Joe.  I would not recommend the coffee cake unless you are a fan of highly sugary items and cherries.  I am neither.

My partners skillet was the most lacking of the breakfast experience.  Again, it's hard to know what happened, whether the small differences were by design, the effect of a new or bad cook, or simply just a bad day in the history of the cracked egg.  For instance the seasoned potatoes were cold and seemed pre-made.  They were dark with seasoning even though I requested light seasoning.  The broccoli which came in the skillet was seemingly steamed, but the spinach was not.  So there was a mix of different cooking for all of the ingredients and it was off putting.    Also my toast was cooked fine.  

We ordered a waffle for the table and it came out soft and light. I wanted it cooked more but I didn't want to bother the waiter.  He asked the table next to us if they wanted their coffee to go, but once he gave us our check, he never once checked on us again.  We asked another of the wait staff if we could have our coffee to go and she brought us huge Styrofoam cups full of coffee.  Not what we asked for.  But still cool.  But a little excessive. But a nice gesture.  So anyways, we got a good experience in the end but not without some effort on our own part which somehow defeats the purpose of ""service"".   

When we finally told the hostess who was checking us out, she showed no remorse and offered no apology.  She just handed us our receipt and was over it.  Over all, we felt that the prices we paid did not reflect the quality of experience we received.  Too bad.",8BOdwgSHMx8PTACfRILyXg,1,0,2,zbsYMMOs7Od02tz5gXUgUQ
