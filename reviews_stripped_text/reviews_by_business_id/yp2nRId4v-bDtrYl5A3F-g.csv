I notice some of the positive reviews say Nittaya's is hit or miss, but I can't bring myself to go back.  Servers here are awkward high school boys who forgot numerous parts of our order and brought things out in incorrect order (one of our apps came after we had finished entrees, drink never came, etc.), way strange for an upscale restaurant in this part of town.  Makes no sense.  Fried ""famous"" spinach salad lacked any kind of heat or flavor.  The coconut soup was boring and one note, again no flavor.  Nothing wowed us, and we tried a good assortment.  With SO many fab Thai restaurants in this city (ie. Lotus of Siam where they have an expansive menu of authentic and super memorable dishes), this should be last on anyone's list.  I'm guessing they cater to people with timid palates who want a quiet and cute atmosphere for date night and food comes secondary.

The First Rule of Nittaya's Secret Kitchen
is you DO NOT talk about Nittaya's Secret Kitchen!
(Except to tell awesome people who love amazing food.
Always tell other awesome people.)

I heard it through the grapevine that this place was amazing, and oh-WOW-uh!
I knew before my meal was over that I would become a regular 
& will attempt to try everything on the menu, eventually.

Extremely intimate & cozy (for now), so become one of the initiated

The food is the true star. Nittay's Secret Kitchen serves ""Thai Tapas"". I was skeptical that this was just another marketing term for ""not enough food"". I was pleasantly surprised. Generously portioned, beautiful and tasty creations graced my table. The World Famous Spinach salad is a revelation. Deep fried Avocado with panko crumbs and two sauces will make you swoon.

The waitress was very kind and patient in explaining the dishes. It didn't seem to have come from some rehearsed dialog, as she genuinely cared about the food and service. We chose the chicken pad thai and tapas called Golden Pouches. The pad thai was most definitely the best version of the dish that I have had in town and was a spitting image of my memory of my Thai friends' family's home-cooked pad thai. The chicken was tender and the flavors were amazing! Earthy, fresh, noodle texture was perfect and not rubbery... We ate the whole thing and when we go back again, we would easily order that dish a second time. The golden pouches are potato and curry seasoning wrapped in egg dough that is fried. They are made to look like little pouches, and they are so good, crisp, hot, and spiced! Reminded me of Christmas... Those were off the tapas menu, and were big enough to be satisfying. 

The ambience was very nice, subtle decor, music from Massive Attack playing in the background... Did not have a chance to try any wines, but the selection was very decent given the size of the establishment. The bar section looked very inviting. Overall cozy feel and welcoming. Would certainly go back again to try more dishes, if only for the kindness of the staff, not to mention the quality of the food.",30z04dffrJuM2XAcfEL8_w,0,0,5,4gbq8Ux3yh2GKucdGya9XA

For our entrees, the green curry with chicken and penang curry shrimp were my favorites.  The flavors were excellent, and there was some definite spice to the dishes.

We went to Nittaya's for dinner last night and it was quite busy. We hadn't thought to make a reservation (our fault) but there wasn't a long wait, which was nice. The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable. You get quite friendly with your neighbors, which is good if you are social, or if you just want to look at their food. They do have some outdoor seating, which looked pleasant, and we'll definitely try next time. 
On being sat, we were offered a fruit infused water. I thought it was very nice, subtle, and something a little different. 
Before I go any further, I have to admit that I am NOT a Thai food expert. I have actually actively avoided Thai food for years because I couldn't handle spice. I only recently began developing any spice tolerance and  I was hoping a ""fusion"" place like Nittaya's would help ease me into a heretofore unexplored cuisine. I was definitely not disappointed on that count.
My husband ordered the fried avocado as an appetizer. Unfortunately, it took a REALLY long time to come out of the kitchen. We kept watching food for the table behind us whiz past while we could only stare longingly at it. Finally however, it did come out and oh, it was worth the wait! The avocado was a brilliant green, with just enough coating to give it a delicious crunch without being oily. The sauce that came with it was bright and flavorful and just a little spicy, perfectly cutting through the creaminess of the avocado.
For entrees my husband ordered the duck curry and I ordered the tofu curry, and here is where we came to another service problem. My curry came to the table roughly ten minutes before my husband's ever made it out of the kitchen. The waitress was extremely apologetic and offered us comped desserts to make up for it. Again, the food was totally worth the wait. The tofu was nicely seared (which many places don't bother to do) and the sauce, although a bit on the sweet side, was very delicious. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his duck curry, saying the duck was very moist, tender, and perfectly cooked. I tried one of the cherry tomatoes from his dish and though it was a little spicier than mine it wasn't overwhelming.
Then it was dessert. I chose the Thai Donuts, while my husband got the fried banana rolls. Both came out piping hot and absolutely delicious. The only complaint I would make about the donuts is that I would have liked a ramekin of some kind of sauce to dip them into. 
The waitress apologized again, and assured us that the kitchen normally runs much smoother. We told her we appreciated her candor, and that we would definitely be back. And we will!",WbJuDPwlDctt7QD8nQhetw,0,0,4,9ERScTcNR0XPSCV6TMkwJA

I've tried curry which they ask between 1-5 and we had a 5 (which my friend asked for a thai 5 not a white guy's 5, since he's had some places skimp thinking he can't handle it) and it wasn't that spicy at all.  Although he did get the Duck Curry, which too spicy might overpower the dish.  So it's understandable.  My other friend got a 3 tofu curry.  TO DIE FOR!  I loved it and I am normally not a curry fan.  Although eatting a whole dish by myself I don't know (that's just not my dish nothing against the food)

I prefer Pad Thai.  They have tofu and chicken, but we asked for Duck.  They made it for us.  It was heaven! I would ask them to make it again!

I have lived in this area for almost 8 years, and I am embarrassed to say I have never stopped by.  I stopped in and placed an order for take out, but was immediately taken back by the very intimate and sophisticated interior decor.  I know Thai, and this was much more White Orchid. Very classy, very inmate.  

For sure, there were still classic Thai accouterments adoring the walls, but it was not overdone.  I really wish I could rate the wine bar, because it looked above-average, and who doesn't want to rate a wine bar? 

I can rate two things: a few of the dishes and the service I received. 

I ordered Curry in Young Coconut, Basil Beef, and Tofu Pad Thai (always have to try the Pad).  The Basil Beef was excellent (similar preparation to Mint Beef), sweet and savory.  The Pad Thai was also excellent.  Not overdone, not too sauced, and the waitress asked if the included egg was OK - as a Tofu dish, I could see how egg may put some people off and this was a nice touch.   

The Curry Coconut?  Oh my.  It was the perfect dish. Amazing curry spice sauce, mussels, clams, scallops, and whitefish all roasted inside a coconut.  My son hasn't stopped talking about it for two days.  This is a definite must-do.

The service was very polite and professional and did not lack.  

I can't wait to go back after finding this gem for a proper sit-in dinner.  Maybe I will get  to review the wine bar, too.  For the sake of review only, of course.

The restaurant is very cozy with a rustic feel to it.
We went afternoonish so it wasn't busy at all, two other couples, so it was very quiet. Service we pretty quick with seating us and taking our orders, but again it was a quiet afternoon. 
We ordered 3 tapas dishes and 2 main dishes and it was way more than we had expected for just the two of us, but the more the merrier right?!
We started with the shrimp jalepeno poppers, crispy pork, and the stuffed chicken wings. 
For our entree we ordered the home style shrimp pad Thai and the drunken noodles.
I love when Thai dishes have a good kick to it, but was a little disappointed when I didn't get just that. The shrimp jalepeno poppers had maybe the littlest kick to them.
I also ordered my drunken noodles with spice and was more overwhelmed with the amount of basil in it. To be fair the menu description clearly lists the main ingredients as egg, chicken, and BASIL.
All in all, I really did like the restaurant and the food as a whole and would definitely come back! Maybe just ask for a bit more spice next time :)",FXqZ66RyoTZ6O4gMFl9pNg,1,0,4,CVgYCViFtPDQDivQvzogXA

Nittaya's is definitely an elevated and more stylistic type of Thai: seriously tasty and satisfying dishes with a modern tapas flare. Deep and unique flavors in every dish and sauce.

Today one in the party ordered Pad Z-U beef.  I thought it curious that there was some wadded up plastic wrap under the rim of the plate, and removed it.

It didn't look good, and our companion, having had the Pad Z-U two other times here was very disappointed.  It was served lukewarm too.  

The other two dishes:
-eggplant with basil sauce and added tofu was fine, though tastier on prior visits

-eggplant with peanut sauce ordered mild, but came more medium-hot, but good

Nittaya's is a small, nicely appointed restaurant on the corner of Rampart and Lake Mead.  The restaurant has a long bar with comfortable looking leather stools and just eleven tables set with little oil burning candles, white table clothes and fresh flowers. When we arrived on a Monday night, at 5:00 pm, we were the  first guests to be seated, but by the time we left two hours later, the place was nearly full.

Service was wonderful.  Our severs were friendly, knowledgeable of the menu items, prompt, and unobtrusive.  Our server even asked if we'd like to sample the wine we decided on before we committed to order it.

Nittaya's has two menus, one for traditional choices of appetizers, salads and entrees, and a tapas menu featuring a vast selection of Thai inspired little dishes. The restaurant also serves a decent selection of wine and beer. My friends and I decided to order several dishes from the Tapas menu and share them.  

We ordered the ""World Famous Spinach  Salad"", bbq ribs with five spice, curry potato puffs,  mango shrimp, beef jerky, pork egg rolls, and crab wontons.  The true winner in all of those selections was the spinach salad which wasn't really a salad.  It was tempura fried spinach leaves served with a tangy sauce that contained cashews and chicken.  It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend anyone who dines at Nittaya's to try it.  The beef jerky was also good and not like traditional tough dry slices of beef.  The jerky was tender, tangy marinated pieces of  beef with a good amount of heat.  I enjoyed this dish very much, but one of my dining companions thought it had a little too much heat.  The mango shrimp were ok.  They were small size, shelled shrimp wrapped in bacon and served with a creamy mango sauce.  They were good, but would have been better if the shrimp were bigger and the bacon a little less overpowering.  The crab wontons and egg rolls were good but did not stand apart from those sold at chain take-out restaurants.  Two of the dishes we had were disappointing, with the ribs having a nice flavor, but being so tough they required a knife to eat, and even then took a little work to get the meat off the bone, and the curry potato puffs (curry flavored mashed potatoes, shaped into little semi circles, battered and deep fried), being so sweet they bordered on being candy.

For dessert we tried the Thai donuts and coconut ice cream.  Both were heavenly.  The donuts were little fried rounds of fluffy light and incredibly delicious dough that was not overly sweet, and were served with a caramel sauce which added  just enough sweetness to make them one of the most delicious donuts I've ever eaten.  I would love it if Nittaya's sold these exceptional little bites by the bag full with a generous dusting of powdered sugar as I would.buy them daily.  The coconut ice cream was served in a pretty little covered pewter bowl.  The  texture was  somewhere between an ice cream and a sorbet, and was so delicious and bursting with coconut flavor that I wished I could have bought a quart to take home.

The price for dinner for the three of us, which included several rounds of wine and beer, was $130.  

Overall, I liked Nittayas and will return to try other dishes on the menu and to have those incredible donuts and coconut ice cream again.",YVAJ4Xddij0Y2Nl48fDdFg,0,0,3,YMdouKOg0-nPwq7uQSmH5g

All tables are way too close to the others, leaving little room for some privacy. Altough the decor might be called intimate, it appeared a little to dark for my taste, with black table linen. Service was excellent though and restrooms were immaculaty clean.
The food was tasty, but not extraordinary. Avocado rolls were delicious, but so are those at other places (Cheesecake factory, BJ's in Henderson). The spinach salad was fried, but that was our mistake as we did not check. Komol serves a similar dish that is just as good. Drunken noodles (flat noodles with ground chicken and veggies), was great, although Dangee Thai on Pecos makes them better. 
Overall a very enjoyable lunch but the Eastside of town has just as many enjoyable places. Komol is great, but StickErice is still my favorite Thai!

We brought a bottle of our own wine and they allowed us to do that and we were glad to pay the nominal corkage fee. We even ordered a bottle(or two? ) from their better than average wine list. 
The wait staff was amazing. My daughter kept saying, ""Hey Josh, could you bring us some lettuce bowls for the pork? Can you bring me some shishito peppers?"" He catered to her like the foodie queen that she is. That in itself was impressive. Most waiters approach teenagers with a bit of awkward disdain, glancing at the mother before they feel the child's food request is valid.. Josh was amazing.

The only reason I removed a star was due to the limited menu but I assure you everything on the menu deserves 5 stars. The spinach salad seems to be everyone's favorite and with good reason. I had the pad see ew, fried rice, and spicy basil chicken. This place seems to only use the freshest ingredients and the customer service was excellent. It is indeed a bit pricey but that should be expected from a place that serves only the freshest produce on its menu. The atmosphere was intriguing with the mood lighting being very dim. The comfort was tight but not crowded. I will definitely be returning back because they certainly know how to treat their customers unlike some of the other local businesses in town that I posted negative reviews for.

Somewhere along the line there had been some cross contamination as I had an allergic reaction. When I later called to speak w a manager about my frustration with the poor communication and/or execution of handling food allergies, they apologized and said there's nothing they could do but would like to offer me a free desert.

And not to mention, he offered us to have dessert like in replacement for the meal. During us explaining to him our issue... He was never sympathetic or tried to say sorry about what had happen.. I'm sorry but if chicken doesn't have a right texture I won't eat it nor will I give it to my 2 year old son. So I sent it back.. Never was asked to remake it... Nothing was said ...

She was so rude!!! She said she would not take it off the bill what so ever and that the chef tasted it and it's fine... & if we want they can box it up for us ! WHAT?

After hearing about this place for years, I finally tried the secret Thai kitchen and was not disappointed. Our waitress recommended the ""favorites"" fried spinach salad and secret dumplings as starters. We tried both, I would not get the spinach salad again. Each piece of spinach is deep-fried although the lime vinaigrette is tasty this was extremely heavy and not my thing. The dumplings were OK but I probably would try something different next time as well. However we did order the chicken lettuce wraps and they were so flavorful and fresh definite must for next time. For Main's we got the Panang chicken curry and the rain forest  rice both were knockouts! The curry was light and flavorful slightly spicy and creamy.

My husband loves their Phuket poppers, with shrimp jalapeños and cream cheese. The main course has all the traditional Thai curries, very good portions. I ordered spicy basil tofu and it was excellent. 
Every Thursday they do half price wine by the bottle. They have a select menu to choose from and has a really good selection of wines. You can get a nice bottle of Chardonnay (original price $36 for $18!!) it's a steal.

My friend and I went for her birthday and ordered alllll the food bc we are hungry little monsters. We got the fried spinach thingy, calamari, emerald fried rice, and pad see ew. BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE. I know, girls can throw it down. 

The deep fried spinach thing as interesting but delicious. It's literally deep fried spinach. They deep fry each leaf. EACH LEAF. How long does that take? Sheesh. Anyways anything deep fried is delicious so this is an A+ in my book. Would I eat it every day? Probably not, my family has a history or heart disease and diabetes. Would I get it maybe 1x every 2 months? Hell yes. 

Calamari also deep fried. So can't go wrong. Pad see ew, is the same as every other Thai place. Can't go wrong ordering this either. Out of everything, I probably wouldn't order the emerald fried rice again. I mean it was good, but it just kinda seemed like green curry with rice but without the saucy part. Does that make sense? Like why would I order this when I can just order the green curry, is what I'm saying.

1695680,2016-09-17,0,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"My friends and I decided to try this place out tonight. I thought it must be bigger at first when we arrived, because the parking lot was 2/3rds full. So while we're waiting for our 3rd, we step inside and see a podium that isn't being manned. The place looked cramped, and they had a table everywhere trying to maximize the space. So I looked around real quick, there's no one ready to step up to the podium. Someone is performing bus boy duties 3 feet away from us at a table, but he can't even look up to us. So, turning around to see the bar tender, she makes eye contact and then wanders down to the farthest point of the bar, away from the door. The two of us stood there for close to 5 minutes, and actually turned around to leave when we were boxed in by 2 more customers coming in the door. Now the podium is right in front of the door, and there's a table in-between the bar and the wall, so there is no where to go. 4 people at the front, and the area is so small, we can't even shut the door. 
Finally, the bus boy walks into the back, and our waitress/hostess finally comes up and asks who was first. My friend and I took her attention and asked to sit outside while we wait for our 3rd to show. A table we wanted outside was unmanned when we arrived, but had yet to be cleared off. She said it'd be 3 or 4 minutes for them to clear, and so offered to step out to wait. After those 4 minutes, she brought us a menu to look at, but the table still wasn't cleared. (I really hope they had half the crew call in or something, because she was all over the place.) After dropping off the menu, the waitress/host steps back inside; finally coming out a few minutes later to clear the table herself as the guy who was performing bus boy duties before is now nowhere to be seen. So she tells us the table is ready, and we take a seat. 
Our 3rd person shows up right after the waitress brings us water, and then we waited. And waited. About 15 minutes have gone by, we've all looked at the menu 3 times, and she finally comes back and asks if we wanted drinks. So, not to miss out again, we place our drink and meal orders all at once. And then it seemed like ground hog's day, because we waited some more. And more. Almost 10 minutes later, the other 2 with me get their meals, which was surprisingly quick for meal prep considering how slow everything else had been. About a minute after that, the bus boy finally makes another appearance by trying to give our 3 beverages to the couple sitting next to us (who are almost done already, mind you). And then we waited some more. I still haven't gotten my food. My friends and I have been talking for about 5 minutes now, and I still don't have my food. I finally tell them to start without me, and then after nearly another 5 minutes, my meal finally arrived. 
Now, I have to say, the meal was awesome. The dish presentation was on point, and the food tasted better than it looked. But for the 3 of us there that night, only one of us got rice with our meals, even though the menu showed all of them coming with it. And once you start eating hot, you burn through your drinks, so they couldn't get refilled fast enough. Our latecomer to dinner mentioned her curry was much hotter than the menu suggested, and mine was as well (luckily, I prefer hotter.) We ended up being there for over an hour and a half, and once we finally got our rice, we had to get up from the table to ask for drink refills after about half an hour had passed without an employee in sight. 
We finally got to see our waitress come by again at closing, and she asked if we wanted any deserts. We declined and just asked for our check, and then we saw her right back. Not surprisingly, they're making a mad dash now to close the place down. We had our bills inside of two minutes, and before she can turn around, we put our cards in and handed them right back. The bus boy decided it was time to make another appearance, and he starts clearing off the cushions from all the outside furniture while we're waiting for the cards to be processed. We chatted for another minute or two after signing our receipts, and you can see he's getting impatient for us to go so they can clear the table and snatch off the tablecloth. I quietly suggested to our friends we should go, and before we can step off the sidewalk to the parking lot, the table is cleared of all remnants and he's back inside the door. 
All in all, the food was amazing. But as I hopped back into my jeep for the short drive home, I was relieved I came here with friends inside of bringing a date. I can't say it's a place I'll ever go back to unless they decided to move to a bigger location and hire some more staff to help.",HeoolPKjgiQkXMRlJxp0-w,0,0,2,WQNyV2zqBhb98Tz7zVN4yA

The menu resembled a clipboard with a number of papers attached. Half the menu was dedicated to the food and half  dedicated to wines.
our interests were focused on the Chinese dishes advertised and those were presented as tapas rather than like dim sum which in a Chinese restaurant they would've been.
We ended up having three tapas plates and one entrée dish. Each of the Tapas plates were tasty and imaginative. The entrée was a smartly presented dish of fried rice with pineapple chicken onions and cashew nuts.
I think the key to the Tapas dishes is to make sure you have the proper sauces to accompany it with. In most cases, the default sauce worked well but I would recommend asking them for whatever other kinds of sauces you happen to prefer like a soy sauce or a hot sauce.
The entrée dish was a pineapple fried rice with chicken onions and cashew nuts. The dish was presented in a pineapple half shell which allowed you to take it home and eat the remaining Fried rice and cut some additional pineapple from the edge. My wife loved it.
in closing, I would recommend coming early because it appears to be a very popular nighttime get together place. It's a little pricey with each of the Topos dishes being about $10 each and the entrées between 11 and $18. I will be coming again!",UJbAY6g49M4Nq_h_c6aGkg,1,1,4,KOwuq-CnLe1pyFec9HcYFg

The decor is beautiful and I'm the type of person who really appreciates the little details like fresh flowers at each table and complimentary infused water.

The food is fantastic, packed with bold flavors. I'm a big fan of the sweet & sour coconut soup, pineapple fried rice served in an actual pineapple and the famous spinach salad! I could drink the dipping sauce straight for the salad! I also appreciate that every dish is so beautifully prepared. 

Prices are higher here and of course you could get cheaper Thai food but no other Thai place looks like this one. It's about the overall experience here and it's a great one.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,48,47,4,DFr-gPmqTrrt1otxzn_kzQ

You can dip the leaves as you go and eat it like nachos, or dump on the dressing and attempt to use a fork. Either way, your taste buds will be quite delighted. You can share this as an app or order it as your main, like I do.

Nittaya's Secret Kitchen has $11 lunch specials that include a salad and potsticker, as well as a Happy Hour (Mon-Thurs, 3-6PM). The Not So Secret Salad is also $11 though, so I find myself ordering that instead of branching out to try new things.

2008639,2011-04-18,0,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"Generally, I find the trend of fusion restaurants to be an empty fad.  Most of the time, one restaurant blending two culinary traditions simply fails at both of them, rather than creating something interesting.

So I walked into Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, which offers a fusion of tapas and Thai foods, with a heavy bias.  But I left pleasantly surprised because Nittaya's has mastered the art of juggling -- offering a wonderful selection of Thai and tapas fusion dishes that are often better than what you'd find in Thai or tapas restaurant.  

When we were there, we had the fried avocado for an appetizer.  It's the only time I've ever used the terms ""airy"" and ""fried"" to describe the same dish, but it really was an inventive combination with the delightful fried crispy shell surrounding the soft tastiness of a fresh avocado.  If you head over there, I'd put the fried avocado on your ""must have"" list.  

We also ordered the spinach salad, which was tasty, but not quite as magical as the fried avocado.  The spinach salad also comes with fried spinach leaves, which are tasteless on their own.  But dip the fried spinach leaves in the sweet cashew sauce provided on the side and it's fairly tasty.  A distant second to that lovely avocado, but creative in its own right.

For the mean course, we stuck with a more traditional Thai and ordered the red curry with chicken.  And kudos to Nittaya's for not dialing back the spice.  The red curry was spicier that I was expecting and super flavorful.  And they treat the ingredients right.  The vegetables?  Cooked and crisp.  The chicken?  Tender.  And they didn't skimp on the vegetables in the curry.

All in all, one of the better Thai places I've eaten in Vegas.  The prices are a little steep, but creativity doesn't come cheap in culinary land.

Ask waiter how much it was to substitute shrimp for chicken.  He said 2 to 3 dollars. End up paying more than three dollars to substitute the meat. Asked him why it was over three dollars( despite asking him in advance )he said it could be anything.

I ordered the garlic endame and basil chicken entree. The endame was good but nothing special. I would have liked a little more spices. The basil chicken was awesome!

When we arrived on a Thursday afternoon, around 5:30p, this very cute and intimate restaurant was pretty much empty. However, the host asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), and said that he wouldn't be able to seat us because it was 1/2 priced wine night, and they'd fill up. Um..okay.... (looking around empty restaurant)... Well, can we sit at the bar? Long pause. How about outside? They hesitated, but said they'd set up one of the outside tables. That was a process that took awhile. Because it was a bit breezy outside, we asked if they could set up the outdoor space heater. Another process.  That finally being settled, we sat down at the somewhat shaky table.

From that point forward, things went well enough. The sangria is delicious and beautifully presented. We ordered the fried avocado, the veggie potstickers and the mango bacon wrapped shrimp. All of these offerings were very good and again, the presentation was lovely. Service was friendly and pleasant. 

As the evening progressed, the wind picked up, and even with the space heater, I was downright cold. I asked our server if it was possible to move us inside to finish. We went inside, and while it was busy, there was a small table right by the bar. She said that the reservation wasn't until 7, so we would have plenty of time to complete our meal. So...why weren't we just seated there in the first place?

The seating issues did put a bit of a damper on the meal, but I am willing to give Nittaya's another try.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,8,2,3,V-85VheuTAA37q4J_p4koA

It is a secret kitchen because from the outside, it looks dark -- almost like it's closed. There isn't an ""open"" sign, so at first, I actually thought that they were closed. The door also sticks a little bit, so you really have to yank hard to open the door. I thought that I was the only idiot to get tricked by this, but while sitting inside, it looked like several others were also fell for that trick! Guys, the secret is that Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is actually open! 
I'm glad that I was able to make it for happy hour, as I got to try some of the appetizers. They definitely have more of the ""common""/""less exciting"" tapas on happy hour (e.g., dumplings), but I was satisfied with everything I ordered. For tapas, I shared the bacon wrap shrimp, the garlic edamame, and the fried avocados. You can't really go wrong with bacon-wrapped shrimp, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the shrimp. They definitely weren't shrimpy shrimp! The garlic edamame was REALLY good. It was really garlicy and had a nice kick to it! I think that they might have pan fried it, instead of steaming it, to give it an extra crisp. The fried avocado was really good! Again, most things are good when fried, but what really made it above and beyond was the cilantro sauce. 
I also got the kao soi to share for an entree: the kao soi is really good! It's a bit pricey, but the portion is generous. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough to share, but there was plenty. The curry had a rich, spicy, coconut-y flavor, with a few large chunks of pork. 
I ended up sitting at the bar. The bartenders were friendly and willing to make recommendations and help explain some of the items on the menu.

My husband and I were starving so we started off with three ""tapas"" - the shrimp patties, stuffed angel wings, and spinach salad.  I love the spinach salad!  It's tempura spinach leaves served in a big cone (like French fries) with a yummy dressing on the side.  The shrimp patties and stuffed angel wings were also very good, but the spinach salad stole the show.  The shrimp patties were pretty much what you would expect.  The menu says ""Thai spices"" but the patties aren't spicy at all.  Decent size and the plum sauce drizzled on top tasted great. The stuffed angel wings are a little different than what I'm used to, but still yummy.  A lot more chicken than ""stuffing"" and with cilantro.  

For entrees, we had the spicy green bean pork and the basil beef.  Their spice rating system is from 1 to 5.  The spicy green bean pork can only be made a ""2"" or higher.  Hence the word ""spicy"" in the name.  We got the pork as a ""2"" and the beef as a ""4.""  The ""2"" was just perfect for me and the pork with green beans was delicious.  The beef was also good but I could tell it had more oil on it and I would probably break into a sweat if ate too much.  The entrees come with white rice, which was cooked properly.  All the plates come with little orchids on them and are served family style.  I liked the presentation of all the dishes, especially the spinach salad.

For beer, they have Peroni, Blue Moon, and Coors Light on tap. We ended up having two Blue Moons, which went really well with the food. They do have some more interesting beers by the bottle, such as a Joseph James stout.  They have a very nice selection of wines but all the red wine is stored on shelves, so it might be too warm.  But they did have a sign outside offering 50% of wine by the bottle on Thursdays so I may have to check that out.  They also carry some sake.  

Most of the desserts have coconut.  It's a Thai restaurant so I expect that.  We ended up having the Thai donuts, which were really tasty.  The caramel sauce is supposed to have coconut in it, but I didn't taste it.

They took my restaurant.com certificate, no problem.  Service was great - very attentive and helpful.  

Small, cute place.  A little dark, especially in the bathroom, but the décor is nice.  Looking at the reviews, I think this restaurant has been paying attention and making adjustments because I didn't have close to the same experience other reviewers had.

Speaking of bills, I'll start there - we were shocked when the bill arrived, and were anticipating it to be about 30% more than it was. For $120 (before tip), we ordered:

The famous tempura spinach salad
Corn fritters 
Wontons 
Spring rolls
Shrimp pad Thai
Chicken pad Thai
FOB rice
Emerald rice 
a Thai iced tea

If you've been here before, you know that is a lot of food! We took home leftovers for sure!

My friend is a pescetarian, and our server was happy to have our dressing for the spinach salad prepared without ground chicken. She also pointed out that the corn fritters contained pork when she brought them to the table, which I thought was nice since we were sharing, and my friend hasn't seen the item description. 

My heat level here is 1-5, I ordered a 3 and was happy with that...their 3 would be a 4 at Le Thai. My FOB rice was astounding - full of tender chicken, and juicy pineapple. All the shared tapas were fantastic also!

One of my companions and I split tapas of beef jerky and egg rolls. The jerky was quite good, but the egg rolls seemed pretty standard. The spinach salad is amazing, and as I live close by, I drop by frequently to pick it up at lunch time to go. The entrees we had were very good... just the right amount of ""bite"" in the items that were supposed to bite. 

A couple of downs that kept me from giving it a fifth star. First, the room is *really* dark; so much so that my 17-year old couldn't see the menu, and he can read the Lord's Prayer off the head of a pin. The manager told me they'd had a few comments about this, and may invest in some penlights to help patrons. Since the menu is eclectic, it really helps to be able to read it. The second thing was that two of my companions are vegetarians, a fact of which I made very clear to the waiter when we came in. One of my companions ordered the Tofu Pad Thai, which she said was quite good until she was about a third through it and found that in addition to the tofu, it contained... chicken. Buzz kill. They were very apologetic, but this should *not* happen, ever, and it was exacerbated by the fact that the restaurant lights are so dim that it is sometime hard to discern what you're eating. 

Overall, I thought the food great, the service acceptable, but the ambience too dark.

I had read an article about Nittaya's Secret Kitchen in a local magazine and decided to give it a try.  The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious!  As an appetizer, we ordered the ""spinach salad"" and the potato pouches in curry sauce.  Both were amazing.  I had never had tempura spinach before and I quite enjoyed it, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce.  I think the measure of any Thai restaurant can be found in what their curry tastes like, and this one did not disappoint.  I look forward to coming back and ordering a curry entree next time.  The third dish we ordered was the drunken noodles.  It was a little on the sweet side, but still very tasty.  The reason why I knocked off a star, despite the phenomenal food, had to do with the snooty attitude of the hostess/waitress as we walked in.  My boyfriend and I decided to bike to the restaurant (so we were both in casual/sporty clothes) and the hostess/waitress seemed surprised when we said we wanted a table to eat there.

NITTAYA'S SECRET KITCHEN is the answer to all my food prayers. Her food gives you that warm feeling inside like it was cooked especially for you & makes you want to give the Chef a hug for such great food. 

A must try is her ""WORLD FAMOUS SPINACH SALAD"" its the most DELICIOUS thing I've ever tasted. Individually tempura fried spinach served with a chicken larb... OMG! i could seriously eat this everyday. 

You should also give her Pad Thai a try... its not your typical ""sour, orangie looking pad Thai"" It has the perfect balance of sweet, salt & sour 

I could honestly go on forever about this place but you guys should check it out for yourself. If you're all the way on the other side, it worth the drive!!",xMtBdVMLqcQtCAChxLRSYQ,0,1,5,cDFwIaNbI5Yft_WD2PyKjQ

Nittaya is one of the sweetest and nicest owners that you will probably not actually meet. The secret on Nittaya's has been out for a long time...almost as soon as she moved up Lake Mead, transitioning from take-out to one of the nicer Thai restaurants in town. So, unless you knew her from her previous incarnation years ago, or you are a true regular at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen, then the amiable chef and owner is probably the only secret left at Nittaya's.

The World Famous Spinach Salad with tempura spinach, lime dressing, and chicken has lived up to its name. I had loved Nittaya's curries before, but this was the dish that brought heightened interest and demonstrated that there was a lot more than traditional curries and noodles  to be had at Nittaya's. It used to be a staple anytime I came and I will still return to it from time-to-time.

These days I am just as likely to branch out and try something new, or return to something that I haven't had in a while. One of my favorites is the Salmon-Avocado Curry--green curry with eggplant, avocado, and zucchini. I don't see myself getting tired of this dish anytime soon.

Nittaya's can hold their own against most of the Thai restaurants in town. Certainly one of the better options, but what separates them is that they are one of three elevated Thai restaurants in town that incorporates great food with a lovely ambiance.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,25,21,4,h-0s9bEqOahrqHKQViuOzA

The atmosphere is dim lit and very romantic and comforting. They start you off with a strawberry mint water which was very refreshing. We started with the spinach salad because it was so highly recommend on yelp. No idea how they fry and tempura loose leaf spinach like that, but it was very good. A little heavy and a very large portion for two people, so we barely dented the plate but it was still delicious. It was served with a special sauce that is rich and decadent, so be sparing. The Thai tea was a must have. And we split the green curry salmon which was served with an avocado on top, eggplant and zucchini. It was large enough to split for two. We were stuffed but had to order the mango sticky rice for dessert which was in season, and which I will probably be craving for the rest of my life! It was superb! I appreciate the fact that They only have it on the menu when the mango is in season and is just right. To me, that Really shows that Mrs.Nittaya is very dedicated to her menu and her beautiful creations. I would love to meet this fantastic chef. Every plate was divine. Decorated with flowers and special care. I highly recommend. My favorite curry is yellow, or massaman,  but I had to try something different.

My first visit there was a great experience, the food was tasty and cooked to perfection. We did have some miscommunication on the level of spice in my Pad Thai however. They offer a level of heat between 1-5. When I asked my waiter her opinion of the heat, she wasn't of much help and kind of insinuated that they don't make their food too hot. So I ordered a 5 (I like my food hot), but not so much that I can't taste the food! That said, I requested a 5, and told her if I wanted to go hotter, I could always add some in on the side- sort of determine that level on my own.

When she returned with my food, she said, ""I ordered you a 5, but I had them add extra to spice it up"". Hmmm. Well, that extra spice they added made the food intolerable. It was beyond what any restaurant should serve if they want their patrons to actually taste their food. It wasn't enjoyable at all (and I can eat hot chili peppers for breakfast) :)

Overall, the other food we ordered was very tasty. So we returned another night for take out. This time I ordered a level 3 for my Pad Thai. The second time around was not as impressive as the first. The Pad Thai had almost no flavor, spice or otherwise. Even after adding an entire container of chili paste they provided on the side. It was just bleh.

Asked the wait staff about the salad and potsticker and they just gave a rather blank, ""huh?"" kinda look.  Five minutes later, the salads came out and were strangely bland with a lot of vinegar on the lettuce.  

Another issue is that you are given two forks and a napkin, no knife.  So because we ordered noodle dishes, we asked for knives, again, blank look from the wait staff.

This place is cute and they worked very hard to make it look amazing...which it does.
The waitstaff is awesome. They are attentive and they are friendly.

The food is Thai food for people who haven't had real Thai food. Thai food should have layers of flavor all working together. 

For example..we ordered the Coconut Soup and the FOB Rice (Fresh off Pineapple Boat). These items were tasty, except the chicken that is being used for this was cooked in such a way that they could use in in both dishes. These means that the chicken has to be cooked with no discernable taste. Although the soup and the Rice were really awesome, when you get to the pieces of chicken, they haven't been able to develop any flavor and they are extremely bland. This takes a potentially awesome dish and kills the awesomeness.

We did order a few appetizers, Curry Puffs, Secret Stickers, and Edamame. The Curry Puffs and  Secret Stickers are interestingly enough cooked in what seems to be a Bisquick-type dough instead of the typical Thai-style dumpling shao-mai wrappers. The Edamame had the layers of flavor and heat that I was looking for.

When I expressed to the waitress that I wished that the food was a little hotter, she did bring me three things to add to my meal. The first one was a dish of pepper flakes, the second was something that may have been sriracha and the last was the sriracha with the pepper flakes in it. Thai sauces should vary, not just be about heat but should be about traditional Thai flavors.

We also ordered 2 entrees, the Crying Tiger Steak and the Kao-Soi (Pork Shoulder).
The steak arrived cooked perfectly but cold. (This is why many restaurants will tell you that a plate is hot when they serve your food...a room temperature plate will lower the heat of your meal by 10 degrees or more by the time it gets to your table) and the Kao-Soi in this bath of really tasty but a sloppy mess of slightly overcooked egg noodles. The pork was cooked perfectly. All was tasty.

WIll we go back? No.
There are so many places in Vegas that we will only return to the ones that have memorable food...and there are a lot of Thai restaurants to visit.

2604556,2017-01-01,1,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"I hate writing a bad review but my experience was unpleasant and I felt compelled to vent. 

First let me start off with the fact that it is New Year's Eve and the restaurant was packed and I placed a to go order.  

The food is expensive for what it is, the portions are small but it tasted good (not amazing) based on the reviews I was expecting the best Thai meal of my life.  The total was $78.95 for potstickers, Bouillabaisse, Cornish hen, Pad Thai, bread pudding and fried banana.  

I was told that my order would take 1 hour to be prepared but since this was my first time driving there I wanted to make sure I was there with enough time.  It only took me 7 minutes to get there - so here is the breakdown I placed my order at 5:51pm and I picked it up by 6:27pm hardly 1 hour.  

The place was packed,  and the place is very well decorated.  I must say I'm a little bummed that I won't be returning because I really think I would have enjoyed my dinning experience there.  But coming from the service industry mistakes are all about the recovery. 

Ok now on to the negatives, my chicken Pad Thai was missing I called them right away to let them know and they said I can come back pick it up.  At this point I just want to sit and eat so I called them back and said that I was going to eat my food first so it wouldn't get cold and I would call them when I'm on my way so they could re make it.  Ok so this where I think it just went down hill for me, my food was cold!!!  The portions are already small for the price but the being cold on top of it?!?!   The Bouillabaisse was tasty but cold, the Cornish hen was a  dry but tasty, the potstickers were a little  raw, the bread pudding was hard and the fried banana was soggy.  Just a really expensive bad meal. 

So recovery--  hardly I call to them and stated that I just wanted my money back, the girl who answered the phone said she would give me a credit since they messed up, I told her that I most likely won't be returning and that I would like my money returned to my card.  She said that there wasn't a manager available tonight and she would take my information down and someone would reach out to me in the next couple of days.  As I was asking her for the managers name she had already hung up on me.  I tried calling back twice but no one answered.  

So unfortunately I have to give this place 2 stars and I probably will never return.  I read so many things and so many friends have recommended it that it truly breaks my heart that I am the one who had a bad experience.

Update went back last night to get my refund and a manager never came to talk to me, they took my card gave me the refund and ushered me out, no apologies.

They do an excellent job of taking spices and adding flavors that are new and delicious without over doing it. I can't wait to try other things on their menu. This trip we tried the spinach salad (what a shock it's so good), the chicken masaman, the eggplant curry, a noodle dish that was top notch and the Phucket poppers (the most disappointing and still excellent). 
If I had one complaint it's time to replace the chairs unless it's just the one I had. It was extremely uncomfortable. No reason to downgrade restaurant, just a note.

I've read earlier reviews, and it looks like they have established themselves nicely now.  The interior is very upscale, which wine glasses and fancy wood furniture.  The dining area is small, but nicely designed.  Wine bottles are fancily displayed in wooden shelves behind the bar.  There is even a small outside dining area, which might be nice on a summer night.  The easy listening music would have touched my inner yuppie, if I had one.

I had no issues with the service.  I made a bit of small talk with one of the waitresses, and she explained that Nittaya's has only been open for two months.  My water was always full, and they asked me how my food was.  This also was the first Thai restaurant I've been to where the waitress folded my napkin over my lap.  I wasn't even with anyone!  Can't complain there. 

My order: Thai tea, Crab Wontons, and Curry catfish.  
Overall impression: descent, Americanized Thai.

Thai tea was average, very creamy, but not very flavorful.  I would go ahead and skip the Thai tea at Nittaya's.  The water though had fruit in it!  This is how my old stoming grounds, Thai Grill, does their water, and it makes for a very refreshing, slightly tangy drink.  

The Crab Wontons were a little bland on the inside.  They used some sort of either immitation crab, or low quality crab, mixed with cream cheese and a couple of herbs.  The fried shells were nice though, thick and well prepared.   They came with two sauces, a sweet sauce and a spicy one.  Both were good sauces, particularly the spicy one, and they made the crab wontons definitely more doable.  Overall though, I wasn't too impressed.  

The curry catfish was alright.. not great, not bad though.  The curry sauce was thick, and on the sweet side, but in this case that was ok because catfish is always a little better with sweetness to offset the ""dry"" catfish taste.  The portion was a little small for the $13 price tag.  The curry came with a nice change of pace though: baby bok choy.  This did give the curry a little bit of a unique taste, I and enjoyed it.  

Overall, due to the sweetness of the curry, and the not-so-thrilling crab wontons, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Nittaya's again over some of the better, more authentic Thai restaurants in Vegas (see my List), but it would be a good spot to bring a date or the parents maybe.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,0,3,gcnQsmuZSbwbCGr_qemsYg

We had the Thai beef jerky, the spinach salad (this, alone, would be 5 stars), crab fried rice, drunken noodles, and the Cornish hen.

What's great is that this is just off rampart and lake mead, so it's a lot closer than other Thai places. Will probably back again to try more of the menu.",WTE4gtyCs1eJDSCj2Afo_A,3,3,4,6bTtNHWx08rkWQ4_4G5aDQ

I've been in Vegas two years now and just came across this place. I was happy to see they had the papaya salad on the menu (as many Thai places if been to don't) so I ordered it with sticky rice. You have to eat the salad with sticky rice, with your fingers....it's the only way in my opinion. Do it. It was perfect! The perfect amount of peanuts and spice. In love- so happy. I ordered the pad Thai, because---u just have to. And it was great- although I could only eat a few bites. Too stuffed from the salad. I am looking forward the trying the mango/coconut dessert and some curry dishes. When I first started eating Thai food those were the best...all I ever ate.

I haven't had Thai food in a long time, and it turns out Nittaya's is less than 2 minutes from my house. So I drove there to get my grub on, only to find that Nittaya's is packed to the gills.

Fortunately, there was a spot at the bar that I was able to squeeze into, and had a good conversation with a Vietnam veteran that I had a lot in common with. Having been to Thailand, my favorite dish is a chicken massaman curry, so that is what I ordered. Plus, I got some chicken pot stickers to whet my appetite. I will say that the menu is quite large, and there is a whole lot to choose from.

The pot stickers were excellent. Slight crisp, juicy inside, and the soy dipping sauce made for a perfect bite.

Then came my curry. The portions were very generous, and included a big bowl of white rice. Everything tasted exactly as it should, and the curry was the right consistency and flavor. The only thing I could gripe about was that it was not spicy at all, and could have used some heat. Next time I was ask them to bring it. :)

Besides that, it's a bit on the pricey side for Thai food, but I enjoyed it and will come back for more.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,0,1,4,m1WyAVZcan57R0FBqPv_Bw

An overall great experience from the moment we arrived. First off, this place is a very small restaurant. When we walked in they asked if we made reservations. Of course we didn't because we were first timers. But luckily there was seating outside and Mother Nature was being kind that day. 

Someone automatically brought out our Lemon & Cucumber infused water. Fancy? The best water I ever had in a restaurant. Did NOT taste like tap water like most restaurants. I pay attention to the waters! I can't stand when waters taste like unfiltered tap water. 

Our waitress, Devynn, was amazing. She gave us great suggestions on what to order. 

World Famous Spinach Salad $11- this is a tempura spinach salad with a lime dressing that has ground chicken, onion, cashews, and carrots. This is probably the most unique dish I have ever ate in my life. You can either toss the salad with the dressing OR eat it like chips and salsa. We went with the chips and salsa method so we didn't drown the spinach tempura. It is a MUST GET. They are famous for this! I ordered it and the beau finished it! Lol that's how delicious it was. 

Beef Jerky $8- bomb! It actually wasn't too jerky if that makes sense. You were able to chew it and not struggle. It came with a roasted chili sauce that added the right kick. 

Shrimp puffs $8- they were like wontons that had shrimp, cream cheese & curry mixed inside. This was probably my least favorite in the meal we ordered BUT still had a good taste to it. I honestly could not taste the shrimp.. 

Chicken Pad Thai $16- BEST PAD THAI in town, hands down. They have really good spices so we ordered it as a level 2 and oh wow it was amazing. Spicy but not too spicy. It was a large portion which was appreciated. The noodles were cooked perfect. Everything about this dish was perfect. 

The presentation of the dishes were beautiful too. They added an Orchid to each plate. How did they know that Orchids were my favorite!?

Two of my favs, together for the first time? The thought was blissful enough for me to trek it up to Summerlin for a taster (well, the intrigue of thai tapas and, of course, my fab book club!) Sadly, I was a bit disappointed.... but maybe it was because my expectations were set too high. 

The venue itself is a bit of a surprise... the dark, somewhat seductive decor and lighting are nice... but don't really spring to mind when you think thai tapas. 

Service was extremely slow, though the servers themselves (two servers kept trading responsibilities throughout the night) were very nice. 

The food itself was hit or miss. Hits: White Fish Cake (the dipping sauce was awesomeness), the mango coconut rice (the bomb), and a visit by the chef/owner to our table at the end of our meal. Misses: Papaya Salad (especially after tasting some of the other fantastic papaya salads that Vegas has to offer), Panko-crusted avocado, and crab wanton (oil factor was out of control).  We tried several other tapas which were MEH.

We waited 5 - 7 minutes for the server or anyone and nothing then a group of 3 came after us and immediately got water. We still hadn't received water or even eye contact at this point. About 13  minutes later I had to flag down the Asian busser to take our order he said he would bring the waitress again we waited and nobody came out. When the waitress went to fill the group next to us water she finally noticed we were staring at her and she came to fill our water. I had to ask her if she would take our order. So finally after all that we ordered crispy pork, crispy spinach salad, and avocado curry.. The group who came after us and ordered after us got their food. Finally when our food came it was delicious and we ate everything. But we had to flag the waitress down for EVERYTHING! Water, sauces, extra rice. Like wtf? Not even once did they come up to us and check us and make sure we were okay. We basically had to beg them to help us. Then later I asked for the check because once again nobody came to check up after they took all our plates away. I asked a white waitress for the check, then a group was next to us and water was spilt all over my purse and the group who was reviving the water. I mean that's okay but I had to clean up the water after he spilt it. Yeah.. Not cool. After another fifteen minutes of waiting for our check we had to ask another person to get it. Then we had to wait another 15 min to get our check and finish everything. I was so done by then.

Their expanded dining area makes seating more spacious now and easier to get up and move about. Service at Nittaya's has been consistent for me for years...regardless of whether it's lunch with friends, a romantic dinner for 2, or a gatherings of a large group of people.  

On my most recent visit we ordered Red curry chicken with brown rice (+$1) and stir fried mixed vegetables with white rice from the lunch special. There are 14 dishes on the lunch specials  menu to choose from and all come with both house salad and a pot sticker for $11...a very good deal for a clean establishment, with yummy food, in a nice setting. 

As soon as you sit down, they will bring you cold, infused water with fruits and herbs...today it was with strawberry and cucumber...or you can go ahead order a glass of wine from their nice selection of wine.

Their decor is spectacular and they have had many different large paintings on their back wall, I assume they change it out when it's been sold(?). I think it adds a bit of excitement to dining there, that you will typically see some new art. I can't rave enough about how much I love the atmosphere and staff at Nittaya's. It great for a date night, or dining as a family since ever dish is large enough to share.  

The food here is phenomenal! I am yet to be disappointed with anything I've ordered. I usually stick to the Pad Thai, Massaman Curry, Potstickers and Rain Forest Fried Rice. The Pad Thai always comes out spicy even though I usually ask for it more mild, so watch out for that if you're not a fan of spice. Other than that, the other dishes are normally served more mild.",IMbd_761a2q3B-4YXx-WAg,4,3,5,ldcaqDZ-so1kssAN3Wb9yA

I stuck with the two dishes I normally order when first trying out a Thai restaurant which is pad Thai and yellow curry. The pad Thai was solid but like most Thai restaurants the chicken was chewy and dry. I wanted a yellow curry but did not see it listed on the menu so I asked the gentleman serving us. He said the yellow curry is the Massaman curry. I have been to ample Thai restaurants and have never had a Massaman curry that is yellow in color. Another thing I did not understand is why brown rice substituted for white rice that comes with an entree is the same price as a side of brown rice. This policy does not make sense and the quality and taste of the food I have tried does not warrant the high prices.,hulIBBzPsCaQDcoh_JgSBA,3,2,3,_93GUuhVR9u0DC9KFg7lRQ

I don't think any dish should ever be more than $12 unless there's crab or duck or some expensive protein in there.  You can find outstanding Thai food in Chinatown or Eastside for less than $20 for a full meal.  At Nittaya's you struggle to find an item on the menu for less than $20.  Even the salads are almost $15.  

Now that I got the price issue out of the way, I'll say that the venue is quite nice and romantic.  The staff is great and there is even a nice outdoor area.  The food was hit or miss for me. The chicken panang curry was outstanding.  But the bok choy wasn't even cut in the dish.  The chef just threw an entire piece of vegetable, root and all, into the dish so we had to cut it ourselves.  The dish could also have been better with more veggies and less chicken in my opinion, but it was tasty nonetheless.  The papaya salad was a nice dish and had a good kick.  The drunken noodles with chicken were fresh.  The chicken had a nice larb taste to it and the noodles were slimy as I like them.

This place is so small that the person sitting the farthest away can hear your conversation.  If you have any form of Claustrophobia, please stay away.  The decor is very dark, but suitable for a wine/beer bar.   This may be considered ""hole in the wall"", but its nothing close to that description.  Its located at Rampart & Lake Mead which has huge plazas at all four corners and a lot of traffic.

The wait staff was 2 young White males who had the attitudes of, ""what time is it, and when can I go home?""  But what can u expect from kids who have no idea what customer service is about.  The other was a young Asian female who took our order.  She was very nice, but the language barrier came into play when asking questions.

The Food:

We had to try this ""famous"" spinach salad.  Ummm people, its fried battered spinach with a salsa sauce that tastes like the dressing for papaya salad.  Only in 'Merica can we take something healthy and ruin it.  Think of potato chips and dip people, there is no ""Salad"". 
 

My entree was Green Curry, vegan.  I asked for more veggies since im not eating any expensive animal protein.  That was not the case or (language barrier).  It tasted like plastic and was basically a bowl of bamboo shoots.  There was only 7 little pieces of bell pepper in it.  Why am I paying 15$ for this again?  When I asked the waitress about it, she got very defensive/annoyed, and did not even try to see my point of view.  I also chose brown rice (which is an extra charge) but it was too mushy. (Used too much water cooking it).  

My friend's entree was pad-Z-U, vegan, which was just as bad.  Swamped in oil even after asking to use smallest amount of oil.  Very little veggies that had no flavor.  it was also too spicy for her, but then again they never asked.

They never asked us how spicy we wanted the dishes...wow seriously?

THEY ARE NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY!

We did find out Nittaya's Secret though!  Its called charging a fortune for low quality bastardized Thai food...and then retire and laugh at all you suckers!


The prices are just silly...I dont mind paying 15$ for green Curry if everything is organic, but for a small bowl of spicy plastic, no thanks.  I just wanna know why am I paying this price?

Oh the ""Tapas"" ripoff idea....yeah so their tapas (very small) portions are the same price as a normal size entree from any other asian foodie place.  There is no reason to pay these prices.

WARNING: Although we voiced our concerns to the waitress and we only ate a few bites of each item, they never offered to to remove them from the bill (other than the mushy brown rice) which tells me they are all about the dollar.  They just don't seem to care

The lad who took my order was nice and very helpful, as I was trying to make wise food choices for being a Nat noob. Upon his recommendations and my own inclinations, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp with mango sauce, red curry, and pad Thai (had to, it's my guiding light for Thai food judgement). Total: $43.24. Bam.

The space is cozy and intimate, and you can tell it's a local's spot. When I walked in at precisely 9.54 pm to pick up my order, there were 3 people seated away from each other at the bar area, chatting away. Very cool. It kind of reminded me of DW Bistro.

On to the fooood.

Bacon shrimp was not as awesome as I thought it would be. I couldn't taste the shrimp, but I certainly got the texture of chewy shelled animal. The bacon was good because bacon is always good. Mango sauce? Good not great, not particularly sweet. I was expecting a great flavor, something like a bacon wrapped date gives you. But this one was lacking in the flavor and texture department.

Pad Thai was very yummy. Great flavors, just enough heat, and plenty of chicken and egg to beef it up. I also appreciate that it didn't have that weird red dye color from the sauces most places use. Yay for quality ingredients!

The curry was overwhelmingly spicy. It overpowered the delicious coconut and spices underneath, of which I caught glimpses. It had a nice mix of bamboo shoots and red bell peppers.

The water they serve was infused with Strawberry and another fruit (can't remember). I could taste it a little in the first sip, but ultimately it's just iced water. Still, it was refreshing 

Half off bottles of wine on Thursday evenings; if I wasn't leaving the city that night I would've taken them up on it!

All the menu items sounded really good and authentic. Prices are slightly higher than normal but their lunch specials are really good deals (salad, a potsticker, and your entrée for only $11). After eating their lunch, I want to say their prices are justified. I guess I'll have to come back again to find out.

Service was also very good, water was refilled consistently and staff was very friendly.

I got the drunken noodles which came out with a small flower, cute. Flavor was solid, and meat was great. The chicken was minced into small bits, it was juicy and full of flavor; I almost thought it was pork! My only gripe is their spiciness is toned way down. I wanted it to be super spicy like many Thai dishes are so I bumped up the spiciness level to 4 (normally one). Unfortunately it was only a ~2 in terms of heat in my opinion.

Located in a small strip mall on Rampart, this is definitely no secret. If you come on the weekend be prepared for a long wait. The interior is tiny with tables too close together and a bar area that has almost no separation from the dining room. The massaman curry ($16) is excellent, as is their ""World famous"" spinach salad ($11). Crispy, light tempura batter covers a heaping mound of spinach. Add the chicken  and lime dressing to it and it's unforgettable. For more subtle flavors, the coconut soup ($9) is the way to go with a thin, smooth broth bathing chunks of chicken, tomatoes and mushrooms.

If you can get a table, dining at this modern Thai place is worth the trip to the westside suburbs. It may not get the press that other popular Thai places get, but they are more than capable of challenging the heavy hitters in town for the title of best Thai restaurant.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,8,7,5,uXGIa3e3xDHhdeSQGQA07w
3524645,2016-09-15,4,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"Went to this place for lunch today and I am glad I did! This place is really a secret because it took me about 5-10 minutes of driving around the parking lot to find the place. The restaurant name is small so it is easy to miss, but place is located on the corner of the plaza with the dry cleaners. 

Upon walking in, I was impressed with the decor and atmosphere. This place has a more upscale feel to it compared to other Thai restaurants. Kind of reminds me of a winery (and they do have quite the selection of white and red wine!). 

I ended up ordering the massaman curry with chicken (I don't think you get to change the meat, but I didn't mind) which came with a small salad and one vegetable potsticker. The salad was really good because of the light dressing and the ingredients were a nice change from just the standard iceberg lettuce with carrots (they actually had cucumbers and some other veggies). The potsticker was really fresh and I really liked how the outer shell was crispy which gave a nice contrast to the contents. My curry was really good as well. The potatoes were fresh and had a strong flavor which I haven't really experienced in other restaurants. The chicken was nice and moist (not chewy like some other places) and the serving was pretty good considering the quality as well. I also ordered a glass of thai tea which was pretty good, but not the best that I've had.

Overall I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It has a nice, intimate atmosphere and the staff are really nice and attentive. Their water is also fancy! Today the water was infused with strawberry and some other fruit which I thought was pretty neat. I will be back to try some of the other dishes! 

FYI, the lunch specials are around $11 which is a couple of bucks more than other places, but it is worth it! Do it and treat yourself.",29yBaTFMSh-l6wNwy9d_mA,6,5,4,6NMZ3oAqCDK4V1lp26ur4g

We had three small dishes: Golden Pouches that's potatoes inside an egg pastry with curry sauce, the potatoes was fresh and I like the curry sauce;  E-Saan Sausage which is pork sausage with lemongrass in it. I love the crispy pork belly. The pork belly was quite different the way they were prepared. It had a thicker breading but nonetheless they were so crispy and mouth watering.

The service was good. 
We also enjoyed the hot teas. They have a separate hot menu so don't forget to check it out. They also have happy hour from 3-6, and half priced select bottles on Thursdays.

Spinach salad - something different..it was pretty good and probably the only good thing we ordered
Chicken satay-4 skewers stabbed in a pineapple..very bland
Lamb chops - tender but way too heavy on the sauce
Tamarind shrimp - tasted nothing like tamarind..more like shrimp in fish sauce
Garlic rice - it was decent
Bread pudding - I don't thing it was made with bread at all..had more of a rice consistency,  too dense and no flavor..The homemade coconut ice cream was made with too much water..it wasn't creamy at all, more icy because there was too much crystallization. Also had a piece of hair but we just let it go

$100 for a couple of tapas, one small entree, and a dessert. I wish I could say it was worth it but it wasn't. To say that they're fine dining is a joke.

I didn't know about this place for a long time until I found it on Yelp, probably because this part of town is not known to have a good selection of restaurants. My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the restaurant, we went back within a week. 
They serve fusion Thai cuisine. They have well-known Thai dishes like Pad Thai and some non-Thai dishes with their own twists. Either way, we enjoyed every dish that we ordered. Unlike a typical Thai restaurant, they pay a lot of attention on the food presentation too. Every dish comes out beautifully decorated. 
The service was awesome. Because it was our first time, we needed some help with ordering. Fortunately, the waitress was extremely helpful. She recommended some food with wine, and we literally like everything. She stopped by at our table a few time to make sure that we are good. It was a pleasant experience.
The restaurant is relatively small. It's better to make a reservation before you go. My reservation was at 6 P.M., and the restaurant was already almost fully occupied. The music is on the louder side, but not annoying at all. I don't think it's a good place to take kids because you have limited space for highchairs. It's a great place for a date though.

This restaurant is located in our neighborhood and so we thought we would give it a try. The ambiance is well decorated, cozy and nice. Good for a dinner where you'd like to have conversation and not have to talk loudly. We had the deep fried spinach salad which lived up to the hype of being a signature dish here. We split that as an appetizer, and we ordered the Kow Soi noodle entree. Our server mentioned that the entrees are big, so that should be enough for the both of us. And she was right. This entree was HUGE! Prices were a little more than your average Thai place, but you get your money's worth. We were too full for dessert but the items looked great. 

The only area of improvement I would suggest is that in the main dining room there is a huge chalkboard mentioning happy hour, yet we were told it was only available in the bar area. I would suggest maybe not posting it in the dining room as we were confused as why it would be in there and not maybe featured near the bar area. Just my two cents. Happy hour ends at 6pm and when we asked at our table they mentioned it was over and only in the bar. (The time was 5:50pm). Again, just a preference to ensure a great dining experience.

My fiancé and I visit at least once a year and I lived there for a short time a couple years ago, while doing a scuba diving internship.  I've taken a coupe cooking classes  there as well, with a wonderful teacher named Miss Ya.  I'm very fond of a couple dishes that I learned during my first course, one is one of the spiciest dishes there is....PAPAYA SALAD!  And seems to be showing up on more and more on menus here in Vegas recently and the other is Massaman Curry, and we get both almost every time we eat Thai.  

After reading about this place in the Weekly and then reading the reviews on here, I've been wanting to go.  Two of my favs, Thai & Tapas, YEA!  Our first impression, like a few others have mentioned, is that the decor was a little off.  After careful consideration, we decided that we should offer to donate some of our Thai artwork, perhaps in exchange for some food, lol! 

Anyway, here's what we got:
Papaya salad- my fiancé even commented on it being quite authentic
Lemongrass soup- was pretty tasty, but I needed to spice it up some more with leftover papaya salad juice :-))
Massaman Curry- we both thought it was savory and had very good quality ingredients.  Although it could've been spicier and we were never asked what level of spiciness we wanted on anything.
Spinach Salad - I had to save the best for last even though we ate this before the curry.  It was simply AMAZING!  If you go here, you have to get this!  SERIOUSLY, this is not to be missed!    

Overall, the food was all pretty darn good and I will definitely call in orders, but the atmosphere is a little funky, however we'll see if we can't help change that :-).

We found Nittaya's based on decent Yelp reviews, hubby's choice, and he hit it out of the ball park again. (so far, all of his out-of-town Yelp food picks have been winners so I suppose I'll keep him around!)

Bulletted thoughts:
-Super tiny space, fills up fast, definitely make reservations even if they are last minute.  We did and got two seats at the bar (we're not picky, we're there for the food!)
-Great service, even sitting at the bar

We Chose Tapas Plates All Around:
-Avocado fries---Yes
-Spinach Salad---Hell Yes
-Beef Jerky---super salty/umami chewy chunks of beef--do it for something different
-Mango Shrimp--Yes

-Coconut Sticky Rice Dessert had some of the freshest, softest most wonderful mango I've ever put in my mouth.  (Probably because I live in Buffalo NY and the only mangoes we ever see are hard-as-a-rock, funky, nasty, bitter things.) Hell-to-the-yes!!!

-A must-eat if you're into Thai.  We will recommend this to anyone traveling to LV who wants a taste of life outside of the strip (read: much more reasonably priced food done by someone whose not a rock-star celebrity chef who likely has no idea what's going on in their corporate kitchen)",ptw9__kpx647eTWve0aLVQ,2,1,5,IL62boQmR7lwyvdMw-aZ-A

They were very understanding.

Onto the review. We started out with a pitcher of red sangria, not the best I've had, lacking some flavor, but the presentation was beautiful, topped with an orchid in each glass. There were so many appetizers that I felt compelled to try, but I settled on the Koh Samui Shrimp, only because I've been to Koh Samui, quite honestly that was the only reason, coconut shrimp usually doesn't do it for me, but this was actaully really good, I liked the dipping sauce. 

For my entree I ordered the young Coconut Curry, which was served inside a hollowed out coconut and served with the most amazng rice I think I've had. It was so light and fluffy, 5 stars alone just for the rice. My friend enjoyed her Tofu Pad Thai. 
For dessert, or as it's listed on the website, happy endings, we shared the Ginger/Lemongrass Creme Brulee, I'm a sucker for anything ginger and/or lemongrass, the flavors really came through.

Start off the meal with their famous spinach salad. As the parentheses on their menu implies, this is not really a salad, but delicious nonetheless. Spinach leaves are individually coated and battered in tempura and deep fried. It has a great spicy lime dressing dipping sauce that accompanies it. This dish is surprisingly large and filling, and probably should not be shared between only two people. 

For main courses, we shared the popular basil chicken, crabmeat fried rice, and drunken noodles. Of the three, I loved the crabmeat fried rice as it had a generous helping of real crabmeat. The drunken noodles also had ground chicken and basil, which made the order of basil chicken somewhat redundant. 

No meal is complete without a happy ending and the family style coconut ice cream is perfect to share. I love the house-made coconut ice cream, but the coconut sticky rice at the bottom became quite hard from the cold ice cream and I wasn't sure if that was the best use of sticky rice.

Our waiter was a nice, polite young man.  We ordered our drinks and placed an order for 4 small tapas. We waited, waited...watched people come after us, order, eat and leave and we still had NOTHING. Our waiter said our ticket was lost in the kitchen so it will be right out?? 48 minutes after placing our appetizer order we finally had something to nibble on. By this time the entire patio was empty and the staff began to clear the table cloths, etc. Not once did someone from management even stop by the table. We had to wait again to place an order for dinner. We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai with a level of 3 of 5. It came out Zero of 5. Absolutely no spice at all. If we had a spice tray we could have tried to add some flavor.  After 2.5 hours it was a long process. The food should have been much better based on all the reviews.  

We will give this one more shot but they will need to seriously step it up. The food (will post pictures of each): Phuket Poppers: Jalepenos,  stuffed with cheese, breaded and cut in half. It has 6 but size pieces which equals 2.5 jalepenos for $9, 5 spice Ribs: ribs were spiced nice but were tough and not much meat at all. Presentation was nice. Would have preferred tender meat and more meat than bone. Larb Chicken Cups: romain lettuce leaves with chicken larb on top. Needed more lime, a few more slivers of red onion and the spice tray. Volcano Shrimp: bowl of butterflied shrimp, breaded in a bowl with sliced jalapeno slices that are presented on fire. Presentation was nice but only 4 shrimp and again not a lot of flavor. Yum baked shrimp ordered spice level 3. 5 shrimp served on a bed of romaine lettuce in a sauce. Forget the sauce. This came with the most flavor of any dish. Pad Thai shrimp: OMG this was just a bowl of super slimy noodles, NO and I mean NO flavor and 5 shrimp, few bean sprouts and tablespoon of crushed peanuts on the side. Two of us took two bites and told the third person they could have it. 

All three of us were just shocked and out evening. Again not once did the manager stop by our table. We weren't sure if our nice waiter had screwed up with our ticket or if management is just poor.

I didn't care for the texture of the noodles and the taste profile was too similar to the peanut dipping sauce.  for an entrée we ate the salmon with green curry and avocado.  i'm not a huge salmon or curry fan but the dish was really good.  the curry had a nice spice.  the avocado added nothing to the dish, nor was it very eye appealing.  for dessert we shared the sticky rice with mango.  it wasn't my choice and I really didn't care for it at all.  service was good and the beer was cold.",BeitdSC8JuthwhzjGrObwA,1,0,3,nYcf0wfaW3Z0wRvjk9KD0g

It was about 1 PM and during the time when the lunch specials were in effect.  $11 for a variety of lunch dishes that includes a pot sticker, and salad, and the dish of your choice from the list of noodle or rice dishes.

I opted for the green curry chicken with rice.  The menu had a notation that the dish was one of their spicy dishes--just what I wanted.  They did not ask for a hotness number I wanted such as a scale of 1-5 or 1-10.  It was made the way they make it.

First up, I was brought a pot sticker and a small salad.  The pot sticker was OK.  Nothing special and a bit soft on the bottom from the sauce on/under it negating the frying of the dumpling.  The salad was great with the flavor of rice wine vinegar being very prevalent.

The curry was very good and I was surprised that it had the zing it had.  Most places that indicate a dish is spicy with a small pepper or some other notation aren't really my spicy level--they're too mild.  This had a bit of zing. More would have been better but this was OK.

Service was good throughout.  I had never been here before, so when I walked in and saw the bar, I sat there because I was dinging solo.  It was only after my eyes got acclimated to the darkened interior that I realized there were two rooms.  It's quite a nice restaurant.

Service was very good.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lunch special pricing at $11 is higher than other Asian restaurants doing lunch specials and I didn't see anything different about the quality of my lunch compared to other places I've been.

Nittaya's is worth another try for the evening menu.  There are some good sounding items I need to taste.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,15,8,3,bOt7n4Vbm_CGJbLBvQi9OA

My girlfriend Jesse and I stopped by Saturday night just for a cocktail. 

We ended up ordering the signature spinach leaves appetizer and some red curry shrimp. Spinach was greasy and shrimp was too spicy.

Service at the bar was very formal and attentive but the restaurant was quiet and everyone was on a date night.  So we probably didn't pick the best place to come and have a girl's night. 

When we were waiting for the check I decided to ""check in"" on Yelp.  I usually check in after I leave a place and I noticed there was a Yelp Deal. 

One free glass of Sangria with check in woo-hoo! Right?  WRONG!  Mr. Four-Seasons Bartender suddenly turned Motel 6 and wouldn't honor it.  (He's the blonde guy with glasses) He said I should have told him that when we first got there. Huh? Just for that, I won't be back.

I had tried to dine here previously but it was just too  busy. I did my due diligence and made a resi this time. The process was pleasant. 

Our reservation was respected and we were promptly seated. It was packed and service was notably slow. We were in no hurry so this was not an issue. I believe it was at least 30 mins before we even ordered apps. Plates were promptly cleared and water always filled so we were not abandoned but we barely saw our actual server. 

We had mussels, volcano shrimp, soft shell crab, and sausage. The mussels were life changingly good. The coconut broth was divine. They were perfectly tender and I literally ate remainder of the broth with a spoon. The sausage was pungent with lemongrass and very tasty. It was served in whole sausages but with all the fixings to make lettuce wraps. Yum. The shrimp were cooked nicely and tasty but nothing special. The soft shell crab was delightful. 

We had the signature fried spinach salad which was tasty and unique. 

We had the duck curry and avocado strip steak with green curry. I didn't dislike the duck but would not order it again. The combination of lychee, pineapple, tomato and curry ultimately did not work for me. I think warm pineapple freaks me out a little. The steak was phenomenal. The avocado, eggplant, zucchini and green curry were all perfect. The curry was the perfect thickness and texture. Absolutely delicious. 

We had a bottle of wine and our bill was just over $200 for 4 of us. We were uncomfortably full. My co diners had a dessert and a glass of dessert wine. I didn't partake. I would return tomorrow and order the mussels and steak and refuse to share.

The Spinach was light & crispy but the dressing seemed different-I can not exactly identify what was different.  I usually can not stop eating it but after 3 bites I was satisfied.  We also ordered the Fried avocado appetizer which was very tasty-the avocado was smooth and buttery and rich. 

I ordered the Beef Pad Z U (their spelling).  It just did not taste ""right"" to me (not bad, not horrible though).  My husband tasted it-thought the meat was chewy but declared it ""ok"".  We took it home.  He ordered the Duck Curry which he declared ""pretty good"".  One friend ordered the Salmon Curry which she liked.   Our other friend ordered the ribs which he loved.  

One con about this otherwise delightful place is the seating.  I am not a tiny person and have no one to blame but myself.  That said, the tables are so tightly placed as is the bar ""area"".  People generally will scootch their seat back and the people at the bar scootch their seat back.  Our party was already seated in the back and all avenues to get to our table were blocked with patrons having their seats back just a little BUT since the tables are so close together it was almost virtually impossible to get to our seat.  I noticed all of the very slender servers and staff having to turn sideways and such to get back and forth between the tables. (So of course my sizable ass was not getting through without a chair or something being moved).  After dinner we felt almost trapped at our table and did not feel comfortable trying to leave until the table behind us cleared.

The secret stickers were much better than your average potsticker, stuffed with meat and spices, deep fried, and served with a delicious sauce. The garlic rice was buttery, redolent with the flavor of garlic, and a great taste of cilantro. I would have any of these dishes again.

I'm going to start by saying that I have had Thai food plenty of times in SF but will admit that I am not an expert, although, I will say that Thai and Vietnamese share a lot of the same flavors and herbs.

Let's start with the atmosphere, it's very quaint and has a very mellow vibe.  White table cloths and lit candles- lovely place for locals to have a ""date night"" away from the kids.

The menu has Thai Tapas- smaller plates/appetizers that range from $4-$8 a plate as well as a good selection of entrees as well as a beer/wine/sake bar.  Wish I didn't have to work the next day otherwise I would've had a nice sake with dinner.

Okay- so we ordered a few different entrees/tapas.  Here's the low down:
Chicken Satay- nice and moist, slight char from grilling (which I like) and peanut sauce

Lemongrass soup-reminds me of hot and sour soup(which I love) but slightly salty. Normally I would eat it with white rice to balance out the saltiness, still still good nonetheless with great flavor

Spinach salad- the BOMB!! hello, not like a typical spinach salad!! The leaves are individually dipped in a tempura-like batter so is very light and comes with a ground chicken larb. It was SOO good! This dish alone would bring me back all the way to the other side of town for!

Green Curry with chicken-again, since I am not an Thai food expert, it was good but a little on the sweet side for me.  I usually have curry Indian style so am not used to the slightly sweet coconut flavor but the vegetables were perfectly cooked.

Combo Pad Thai-again, slightly sweet but nothing a few lime wedges and some sambal can't cure. 

We finished with the coconut sticky rice and sweet mango.  Loved the coconut sticky rice but wish it was a little more moist. Mango was perfect, sweet and ripe.

Overall, A+ for me, will definitely be back to try the other dishes on the menu!!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,4,3,4,oB2YqbQ6_A1mzfRbhupqig

Many things sounded good to me but my wife is a vegetarian so she stayed away from the dishes that included meat.

The Chicken Satay was very good while the beef as good, but nothing to write home about. 

My wife had a spinach salad that had tempura battered spinach and a citrus/cashew dressing sauce on the side.  I should point out that this dish normally comes with chicken but they told her she could elect to have it with tofu instead or without either entirely (which she elected).  I tried it and it was very interesting and tasty.  

We also ordered Garlic Edamame which was fantastic.  It had a great garlic flavor and they put in Serrano peppers as well in there which is a twist we had not tried before.

Nittaya is located at Lake Mead and Rampart and is a west side local favorite. The decor is thoughtful and warm with wood and fabrics and an intimate even romantic feel. The restaurant feels small with two adjacent dining rooms and a wine bar.

The food is undeniably delicious with the usual variety of a top notch Thai restaurant. As good of Thai food as I have ever had, including Lotus and Thailand! While I dine here alone at the bar or as a couple often, I prefer going with a group so I can over order and get deeper in the menu.

My favorites are the citrus steak salad and the Kao Soi. The FOB pineapple rice is a great addition to any meal and the chicken dumplings are excellent. Actually, everything is delicious.

Firecracker prawns were deep fried breaded shrimp with some sauce drizzled on, really would a ramekin of sauce kill you?  Normally I am used to prawns in yummy egg roll wrappers. 

My husband sent back the drunken noddles because it had eggs, which we have never had in any Thai restaurant ever.  He then got a very unremarkable basil chicken which was had so much gristle he had to spit it out.  

My crab fried rice either had fake crab or really terrible crab.

In comes Nittaya's Secret Kitchen. This place is phenomenal and during every bite I knew I had to leave nothing but outstanding remarks. 

It's in a little corner barely visible from the street but when you walk through it's false door you enter a space that captures an atmosphere all it's own. 

For starters, I recommend the Lemongrass with shrimp soup. It it to die for. If this is the only thing they did well, I would keep coming back for it. However, that's far from the truth. Everything we had was fantastic. Truly a restaurant I hope to see expand. 

Kylie ordered the citrus steak salad. She wasn't in a spicy mood but thankfully, there are plenty of options for those who either lack the pallet or the tolerance for spicy foods. The steak came out perfectly cooked to medium rare next to this beautiful bed of salad with a citrus sauce along the bottom. Never too overpowering.

I've been in a seafood kick as of late. The polite staff recommended the seafood madness mix 3. Although, a huge fan of spicy food, I decided to not over do it the first time to keep the balance of the dish. A simple 3 on their 1-5 scale of spicy is sufficient to keep most happy. Out came a wonderful presentation of mussels, shrimp, and fish next to a flower and a plate of steamed white rice. Dig in because you won't want to share. 

On the drink side, they offer wine by the glass or the bottle. 

I highly recommend this place.",zKAwyRCGNpZ0fHu67YBUrg,2,1,5,hje_tsiAhT__WTPPDvVeLQ

4484347,2010-10-06,1,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"Nittaya's Secret Kitchen won't be a secret much longer, as this tiny neighborhood gem in Summerlin has a lot of potential. Tucked back in a small strip center off Lake Mead and Rampart, it is a little tricky to find, but is worth the search. They describe themselves as a Thai tapas restaurant, implying there may be some fusion going on, but in actuality you can just expect a lot of Thai appetizers - really good Thai appetizers - and some traditional favorites. Most things on the menu taste healthy and clean, and there are plenty of vegetarian dishes. The tofu preparations here are better than most, and the eggplant dishes aren't heavily saturated with oil as they often can be.

You can't leave without ordering the unique Spinach Salad ($9). This isn't really a salad at all, but rather a mound of lightly tempura battered spinach leaves that serve as chips for a tangy 'dip' made from ground chicken, whole cashews, cilantro, carrots, and onions. The leaves are delicate, yet pack a crunch, and the spicy, sweet, loose dip is like a meat-fortified salsa. Sounds a little strange, but it's to die for. The Chicken Ginger Salad is similar to the Spinach Salad, except the spinach is replaced with iceberg lettuce, you get a lot more chicken, and you have the addition of tender julienne ginger ($9).

Skip on the 'Shrimp in Pastry.' Though tasty, and dramatically presented, there is no pastry to be found (just wonton wrappers). The shrimp are overwhelmed by the cream cheese, and the jalapeno and leek don't come through enough. It's also a culinary no-no to put inedible items on a plate, i.e. pineapple rind (see below). What the 'Shrimp in Pastry' lacked in cohesion of flavors, the 'Thai Bouillabaise' made up for, though the mucky color was off-putting. They also use frozen green lip New Zealand mussels, an ingredient I feel there is no excuse for in good places. Though I loved the broth, that was the break in the 'make-or-break' of the Bouillabaise for me.

I love that they have outdoor seating with views of the mountains in the distance, but the best kept part of Nittaya's secret is that you can get a $25 dining certificate on restaurant.com for as little as $1 when you sign up for their email list. Although I'm annoyed by their almost daily notifications, the discount codes are incredible and I save about 80% off their regular restaurant certificate prices on any given day. Plus, it encourages me to try new restaurants I otherwise wouldn't, even if I do defeat the purpose of the discount entirely by over ordering. If you go to Nattaya's make sure you visit restaurant.com beforehand, even if you don't have a code, because it will still save you $15 as a visitor.

Finally, go knowing that the service at Nittaya's is slow. Your food arrives promptly once you order, but everything else seems to take forever. The staff is friendly enough to compensate for this shortcoming, though it is worth taking into consideration if you are short on time or don't particularly like to linger. Hopefully this is just part of their opening pains.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,8,4,4,5kCkGeCnMDBF5BJ9HtOV4w
4484766,2011-08-18,1,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"This little place is beautiful, with just the right lighting to make it a special romantic hideaway. That also makes it a little difficult to read the price-gouging wine list, where a glass of Riesling goes for $12 for one brand and $10 for another. I think Nittaya has lost sight of the fact that this is a neighborhood restaurant nowhere the Strip. 

The waitress, whose English made her nearly impossible to understand, did a good high-pressure job of pushing the Tempura Spinach Salad appetizer, and we were glad she did. It was outstanding, though it's now $11, not the $9 previously reported.  Our party of four also ordered the Fried Avocado  appetizer and the Shrimp Patties, but the waitress brought the wrong shrimp appetizer, saying they had similar names.  She changed it cheerily.  The avocado was very good, but the shrimp patties were ordinary and greasy. 

For our main course, my husband and I shared a Chicken Musaman Curry, served with a side of jasmine rice. This was the only dish that didn't have an elegant presentation. It was good - not the best, but certainly not the worst Musaman I've had - but could have benefited from less sauce and more chicken. They didn't offer it with beef, which I like better. 

The other couple had much bigger appetites, ordering Salmon in an Avocado Curry, a Crab Fried Rice, and Catfish in an unidentifiable reddish sauce. She liked her salmon, he hated his catfish, and the fried rice was lukewarm. 

With visions of Yogurtland dancing in our heads, we bypassed dessert here. 

If we were to return, we'd probably order just from the appetizer/tapas menu. But then again, almost everything on that menu is either fried, stuffed with cream cheese, or both. We'd probably be best off leaving that kind of food for the younger set.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,3,1,3,7nVHM0x4Qz-8m-BnSRolmw

I just wanted to go somewhere that served Coconut Soup for my sore throat and some place very quiet because I also had a headache. I wasn't feeling too great as you can tell. When we stepped in it looked very cozy with the brown, gold and brick walls. The tables were draped in white it was very calming. 

I started off with the Coconut Soup it came in soup dish. The dish was a little shallow meaning that there was only one serving. I'm used to places like Thai Barbecue that serves it in a big silver server which comes with more than enough to take home. I was sick so I was hoping for more. I know that this is a Thai tapas place but my soup wasn't on the tapas menu so I thought it would be bigger. The soup still had a nice taste and the chicken pieces were not too big which was perfect. The only thing is I wish the soup was served hotter. 

My husband had the Citrus Steak Salad which had cucumbers, tomato, red onion and spicy lime dressing . That was really good and the meat was nice and tender. 

I tried the Grilled Mango Shrimp that was served with a Spicy Mango Sauce. I was afraid the dish might be too salty because of the bacon wrapped shrimp but it was a perfect balance of salty and sweet. It reminded me of the shrimp I used to order at Tom Ham's Light House in San Diego years ago! It was delicious! 

We also ordered some fried rice. It was good but I don't recommend taking it home because it doesn't taste good the next day . The rice is too mushy that it just doesn't keep well.

4585773,2016-07-29,1,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"Wow. I've been here so many times in such a short time and it is my all-time favorite restaurant. The service is always amazing and the food is out of this world. I've tried many thai restaurants in Vegas and this has by far the best food. Try anything here, and you will not regret it! 
Everytime I come, I always make sure to order the chicken pad thai, crispy pork belly, and of course, the mango sticky rice. 
The chicken pad thai is very flavorful and it is bottom line AMAZING. The flavors really come alive once you squeeze the lemon on top. The noodles are always well cooked so there is a little chew to it. 
The crispy pork belly is a hit or a miss with the portions. The difference in sizes vary with a big difference depending on the chef. But regardless, it is soooo good. I usually don't like foods with a lot of fat, but my goodness.. It just melts in your mouth with that very light crispiness. The sauce that it comes with on the side complements it very well. It is a tangy spicy sauce. 
And my favorite... The MANGO WITH STICKY RICE! This place was the first place I've ever tried this dish. I will not eat this at any other place because my taste buds are spoiled!
When I went a couple weeks ago, there wasn't any mangos ripe yet because it's not the right season, so we got the deep fried banana and it was just as delicious. The outside of the banana is not your typical tempura; it's coconut shavings! It added a crispiness that's almost like a chip. The banana is also topped with coconut ice cream, which has actual coconut in it! I asked for a side of sticky rice and it paired well together with the banana and ice cream. 
Definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Don't miss out on this gem!!!",nRicr5sDYwpDUM9s2bjS4w,1,1,5,Yu_k1rrgb8P0vyqK_jfLRw

When we got there at 7:42, we were told there will be another 20-25 minute wait. If that was the case, they could have just booked us at 8:15 instead of promising a table at exactly 7:45. The servers obviously didn't want to be there, they looked so miserable that empty plates were not cleared until you point them out to them. The lady who took the credit card payments also had some attitude problem (even if it was her fault), she charged the wrong amount for the credit cards. So we told her why was that the case? Instead of her being apologetic she raised her voice at us and even moving her arms about to make herself heard. I was a little uneasy when that happened since I've never had that kind of experience before especially from an establishment such as this. Overall the food was good, except that the curry was really dry and the sauce was like eating sea water. But other than that dish the catfish came out well. After such a long wait, we would have expected a really good service at least, but nothing, nada! Not even a good explanation.

4702505,2013-02-26,1,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"This place is so flipping awesome. In December, Ruben and I took our friends visiting from England based on a recommendation. I called for a table and all they had were four seats at the bar, which was more comfortable than we expected. It was a rounded corner, so it still allowed us to be facing each other and it was still intimate. We enjoyed everything we tried and the service was wonderful. Great atmosphere!

We tried the Lettuce Wraps, Fried Avocado, Curry Puffs, Esaan Sausage, World Famous Spinach Salad, Five Spice BBQ Ribs with Citrus-Ginger Glaze, Emerald Fried Rice, Calamari, Housemade Coconut Ice Cream, and Thai Donuts. My favorites were the EMERALD FRIED RICE (I mean, phenomenal), SPINACH SALAD (they'll warn you that it's not really a salad, but it really doesn't matter because the flavor of the lime dressing and the tempura spinach is amazing), ESAAN SAUSAGE (the flavors that they manage to pack in here is so great, you'll be wanting more than the three served), and CALAMARI (wonderful batter and delicious dipping sauce).

All of us truly enjoyed our meal and had so much fun with all the dishes. Because it's such a small space, definitely plan ahead and come with a large group to take advantage of trying a little of everything! They're very accommodating and I'm so happy we were able to dine with them. I can't wait to go back!

Edit (03/01/13): Ruben and I went back for a date night and made a reservation earlier in the day. We had a rocky start; they were really busy and since we were in the back, we felt ignored. No one even acknowledged us when we walked in the door, actually. It took a while and when I said we had a reservation, they just pointed to the table in the back. Once our order was taken, it was smooth sailing (well, it also started to die down from when we first arrived) and everyone was attentive throughout our meal. It's a hard restaurant to be in if you're claustrophobic because you're in extremely close quarters to EVERYONE seated around you. I didn't enjoy being sandwiched between two other parties and unfortunately, hearing their entire conversation. So although it's an intimate space, it's definitely not for an intimate evening. I will probably request the corner bar seating next time since we had a much nicer experience there.

The food was phenomenal again and that definitely solidified my love of Nittaya's. We ordered the same four dishes that stood out last time and it was just as good as I remember. We also ordered the Coconut Soup and Spicy Basil Eggplant as well. Both were delicious, but neither favorites of mine. Since they were out of their bread pudding (I really want to try this!), we opted for the Creme Brûlée trio of Green Tea, Coconut, and Ginger Lemongrass. YUM! We're not big fans of creme brûlée, but these weren't overly sweet and the unique flavors were fun. Oh, and their Sangria is great!

I didn't try any drinks this time but they have a wide range of wine options and some unique beers, my boyfriend decide to order the Lucky Buddha beer which comes in this really unique glass.

They had a crunchy exterior with a soft stuffing including kernels of corn, pork and spices. The sauce that came with these was delicious! It was sweet and had peanuts floating in it. The golden pouches were also very tasty. I got these to try their curry sauce which was excellent. These pouches were so pretty I didn't even want to eat them! The fried avocado was also very tasty and an interesting concept. At last I tried the chocolate banana beignets. OMG these were divine. They were stuffed with a deep dark chocolate and bananas in the inside. They were then drizzled with chocolate on the outside. They came hot and freshly fried.

We promptly returned them and were able to get a refund.

The main dishes weren't so bad - Shrimp Pad Thai and Seafood Madness. But the price - $19 each?! There's better Pad Thai for half that price at a dozen other places around town.

Surprisingly this place was near-packed, though it's also quite tiny. I can mainly attribute the crowd to the fact that there are few other quality restaurants in the area.

Which brings me to my conclusion. We have basically a South Summerlin and a North Summerlin. Both have wonderful homes in beautiful neighborhoods. But a big difference - FOOD. We live in the South and are truly blessed to have a ridiculous amount of tasty restaurants in our area. Down the road from us (near Ft Apache) there are THREE Thai restaurants that are all a better value than Nittaya's.

4928906,2013-07-07,0,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"Transported upon entry, this cozy dining room with a wine bar suggests a more European feel than a Thai restaurant.  Two menus are presented - one a conventional Thai listing with adapted names for American tastes, like ""Pad Z-U"".  The other is a tapas menu with an Asian bend.  The papaya salad with prawns tasted authentic but a touch spicy for my dining partner.  We were not offered the '1 to 5' spicy range, but notice the reviews include such a choice.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed the salad 'kick' without complaint.  The catfish was presented with a tasty curry-like sauce that worked very well.  We considered tapas, but our two dishes satisfied.

The wine list demonstrates a competent selection with an adequate variety by the glass.  However, our Pinot Noir must have sat in the bottle at least overnight and lacked character.  It's truly awkward to send back glasses of wine during a first visit as these glasses were ""borderline"" in my opinion, so we shifted gears for 2nd glasses and commented politely to the waiter about the 1st.  I suggest tasting before committing until they cycle their by-the-glass bottles properly.

Service was capable and polite.  Reservations are recommended as the size of the dining room is limited for your pleasure and comfort.  I'll be back.",h9stsH2vvCmhwHdfkc_1kw,1,1,4,hrGQePFRrQ-QcIHKd5W7fw

I enjoyed my time more being with friends than being here. I will give them a chance again but for now I have other go to places for Thai.

Now I know going in that I should be more prepared and check to see if reservations were needed. My friend suggested this place without a reservation. So we ended up being sat at the bar. No worries there. Completely our fault.

To start off the dinner with friends I ordered my usual papaya salad. Theirs had shrimp so I said why not? I enjoyed the flavor more than the dish itself. The dressing was on point, but the usual crispness that you would expect from a green papaya was just not there. The peanuts did lend to the crunchiness but it was not the same. I appreciate seafood but for some reason to me it did not pair well with the salad. I don't know how the shrimp was handled during preparation but it did not have a good texture. Like it sat too long in the dressing maybe? It was just off putting. I didn't get sick after the dinner so I'm not saying the shrimp was spoiled, but it did not have the usual characteristic of something fresh. 

The Duck Breast Curry was okay. Well, better than okay. I appreciated the fact that it was a duck breast which meant no bones to pick through, but it was just not the same as other duck curries I've had at other restaurants. 

By the time I got to the dessert, I was impressed by the presentation... Then this happened. This is more of the chef in me so I don't know if it goes unnoticed by most people, but seeing that same garnish (purple edible orchids) throughout all my courses... I think it's enough. Yes there's a time and place for it but not through every single course. 

All in all, I felt the food was okay. Would I go back? I would not actively do it but if friends suggested it I will still go.",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,2,1,3,Mh0jEudFTIw76Pe-O3ke-g

We didn't even bother to order a dinner as we didn't feel like being there for an additional 2 hours. Then they tried to charge us for the beers that we never did get. I checked my credit card statement a week later and I found that the waiter double charged my credit card on accident.

Authentic Thai? No. Unless you think people in Thailand eat orchids.  But a prettied up example for Western palates.

Every dish I've ever sampled has highs and lows. For example, the spinach salad that so many rave about. The tempura spinach is excellent. Crispy with just the right salinity. Perfect fresh out of the clean oil. Unfortunately a dip in the sour, herbaceous sauce muddles the flavor and does nothing but make the dish soggy.

The server recommended marinated crispy pork, very moist with deep five spice flavor, with a crisp breaded coating, tasty. When mixed with the accompanying chili sauce, the crust becomes soggy and the oil becomes pronounced.

Golden pouches, pretty, but the deep-fried wrapper is too thick to bite through, forcing you to turn it upside down and soak it in the curry to soften. All good as the pouches break open and the creamy potato taste great with the curry.

In general Curries are very flavorful. Great coconut taste well integrated spice. You won't see chili oil floating on the surface. Proteins in the curries are well cooked.  Chicken and pork are especially tender and still moist.

Conversely, sauces don't complement dishes very well. All good, it's fun getting the pork into the curry and the spinach into the chili sauce. All better flavor combinations.

Great added touches such as an orange cucumber infused water.

Service is very welcoming and off Strip friendly.

So why four stars? Simple, The food is intriguing. Take the highs of each dish, play with your food make your own combinations.  In the end, a fun dining experience.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,17,17,4,8r2lhZD6WsPHaqi_MD83cQ

I'm pretty sure this was the first time I've ever been asked if I had a reservation...for lunch...for Thai food lol.  And it was the only time I've ever felt self conscience for my 2 year old Little Foodie Dude eating with me during lunch!

It is very chic, glamorous and date night appropriate! Service was great as well...and food was outstanding...but you'll pay for it!

Coming here during lunch is a great deal! They have $11 lunch specials (yes, expensive compared to others around $5-7 range) but they are packed with flavor and use quality ingredients...you really can taste the difference! The lunch specials also come with a house salad and pot sticker which were both pretty good.  Portions are decent as well, so you should leave satisfied :)

I went with my standard Drunken Noodles aka Pad Kee Mao. This was an excellent rendition, with lots of flavor even with chicken instead of pork! I love chinese broccoli, so I was excited to see it in the dish! I asked for it extremely spicy though, and what I got was a 1/10 on my scale...I should have sent it back, but it was soo good even without the spice! 

Also tried their version of Pad Thai. Surprisingly, this was more spicy than the request for 10/10! I really liked their version of this dish, and is probably the best Pad Thai I've ran into so far, although I don't often order this dish.

But what if you don't come here during lunch? Expect to pay $16 for drunken noodles ala carte. They had $15 desserts on the menu. Yes, there are some cheaper alternatives, but I don't even remember seeing $15 desserts in some of the best steakhouses in town!

We always get the same order and then try one new dish.
Our favorite appetizers: chicken lettuce wraps, yummmmmmy .. they come in orders of 4 wraps and yes, the sauce is on the side, I can handle a little bit of it but you really don't need much sauce as the flavors are wonderful.
The crispy spinach and the secret stickers or potstickers.

Main course we get an order of massaman curry Chicken with you guessed it, no spice 
And the Basil chicken.
Pineapple fried rice which is served inside half of the pineapple

They always bring extra spices for the table which is usually kept at the other end of the table.
We also get one other dish to try each time and have never been disappointed with the experience 

I usually pass when it comes to desert, my suggestion here... Don't! Their deserts melt in your mouth, the ice cream is creamy and yummy... the fried banana is done to perfection and the fried donuts are scrumptious.

Sharing a city with one of the most highly acclaimed Thai restaurants in the United States cannot be easy but with Lotus of Siam's largely traditional menu routinely garnering hour-plus waits for both lunch and dinner it could also be said that Las Vegas is an ideal locale for something small, intimate, and innovative - a description defined by Chef Nittaya Parawong and her Secret Kitchen.  Featuring a style described as ""Thai Tapas"" alongside traditional curries and noodles with each dish made by Nittaya herself and served by friendly Taiwanese servers in a modern yet elegant space a meal at Nittaya's Secret Kitchen is a relaxed and refined affair beginning with complimentary flavored water and although the menu featured no less than a dozen items I'd have liked to try, the decision was made to start with a variety of tapas, appetizer, and curry plus dessert - each item prepared to order, ample in portion, and served with impeccable pacing.  Intentionally incorporating fish, vegetable, and meat before progressing to dessert and focusing on the more innovative options both the crispy fish cakes and the tender duck breast would prove delicious and well prepared with light sweetness acting to temper the heat and moving on to the ""famous"" salad I really have no idea how the chef manages to produce a batter so light and a flavor so vegetal but whatever the method it should be embraced, the dish one of the best things I've eaten at a Thai restaurant and without a doubt the most innovative 'salad' I've had in years.  Moving on to the dessert menu there was never really a question as to what I would order and with tender pineapple pudding rife with coconut milk custard topped off with both ice cream and caramel of the same I really cannot think of a better 'Thai' dessert, traditional or not, nor a better thing ever done with a coconut.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,3,5,WJ9RcBMzUE7ZkYK9avS8Eg

They were able to accommodate our party, even though I made a last minute reservation on Christmas Eve. Sadly, I did not get one of the white cushy chairs; they brought in an outdoor table and chairs, in order to squeeze us in--literally. By the way, the restaurant was super busy that night, and I was just thrilled to be back.

Our server was sweet and very witty. She made the best recommendations, and made us feel well taken care of.

We ordered Pad Thai, Pad Si Ew, fried tofu, green curry chicken and their signature spinach salad. The salad was the perfect appetizer for our party of four. We enjoyed it so much that I ordered it for dessert (for the entire table of course). Be advised, this is a savory, deep fried salad, with a sweet sauce on the side.

First, the excellent customer service - I got there at around 9:35pm, but they were very welcoming and not for a moment did I feel that they were in a hurry for me to leave. Very nice!

I ordered a green chicken curry but with extra vegetables - they were happy to oblige. The vegetables were actually the star of the show - perfectly cooked, for each type of vegetable they put in - perfect balance of firm and tender.  And they did not skimp  on the quantity or variety   - mushrooms, green beans, carrots, broccoli, egg plant.  

The curry itself was of just the right  consistency-  not too thick and not watery, with just the right amount of heat and deep, complex flavor.  Just to note, the quantities are very generous- enough for two.

Only a few others were here, and the perfect time to take  your time to eat. If you plan on coming in for dinner highly recommend to make reservations as they get packed. 

For our second visit, I noticed the menu is more expansive. They do have lunch specials going for $11 with salad and chicken potsticker from 11am-3pm. The rest of the menu has appetizers, tapas, entrees, a huge list of wine, cocktails, and alcohol and desserts. 

What we ordered: the famous spinach salad w/the lime sauce, thai beef jerky w/the green sauce  (beware, this green sauce is soooo addicting), pork belly w/the spicy chilli sauce, shrimp, secret stickers (basil chicken flavored) and the muay thai fried rice. Everything we ordered came mostly off of the tapas menu and the muay thai fried rice we decided to get from the dinner menu. 

Everything we tasted has been the best thai food we have tasted in so long.  Spinach salad is enough to feed a party of 4 to 5 ppl. Spinach also has been perfectly cooked. Adding the lime sauce adds a bit of the kick. Definitely recommend for first timers. Pork belly with the chilli sauce and the pork was tender. This is the thai version of the Filipino version of lechon. Shrimp was on point with the chilli sauce. The chicken basil pot stickers, were different. Crunchy on the outside and juicy, tender when you bite right into it. Last, the fried rice was fluffy and evenly seasoned and enough to feed a whole family.

The service: by far one of the best. They were attentive, suggested other options, on point with refills. 

Overall: we enjoyed our service and definitely recommend if you want to enjoy dinner or lunch. Will be back soon.",pa8zvcFxnj6jFtywlxKf_g,0,0,5,TAGaFxHf5iMzao1eZl9IaQ

I feel like I'm always biased because of how much I like my favorite restaurants but this was different, everyone at the table couldn't stop talking about how good the food was.

This is definitely a perfect place for a date or someone to impress, it's very serene and tranquil and was just a complete relaxation from the usual (but I'm probably saying this because I went right when they opened so it wasn't overly crowded with noise and chatter.) The service was excellent, they were friendly, professional and had immaculate timing with food, refills, etc. (probably because I was one of the few there at the time but still you'd be amazed at how many restaurants suck at this). I also really liked the bathrooms, they weren't the usual dingy bathroom, it kind of felt like a hotel bathroom. I know ... a bathroom review is weird but sometimes it's just good to know. 

I had the E-Haan Sausage, Calamari, Spinach Salad, Drunken Noodles and the Salmon Avocado Curry. The curry was recommended as the ""best dish ever in the city"" by the server and with that bold statement I knew it would fail to live up to expectations. It was good, not a standout but still good. The calamari was actually really good much to my surprise. It wasn't over breaded, had the perfect consistency and the sauce was spicy but sweet, a good complement. 

The E-Haan Sausage was different, you wrapped it in a lettuce wrap and it had different toppings, original, good and different. The drunken Noodles tasted like...drunken noodles. Nothing outstanding, they tasted exactly what they were supposed to taste like. 

I was a little confused about the hype over the spinach salad. The lime dressing is actually amazing, I love lime and I could drizzle that stuff over anything but the actual salad is just fried lettuce or tempura battered lettuce. I have an inner fat kid so anything fried tastes good, I'm not a fan of carrots but guess what's good? Fried carrots. Almost anything fried can be good so I'm not sure why this dish is overhhyped.

All in all not a bad place to check out, good environment, good wine selection, but not five stars because the food was good, but I can't see myself ever craving it or telling someone they have to go here to try a specific dish.",09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA,3,2,3,__WqO5B3P1y1EXscK_8aKw

The parking was super easy. I really like the feel of the place. Nothing too fancy, kind of remind me of a regular Thai place.

World famous spinach salad-this thing was so good. It was just spinach tempura but the sauce is so good. It has a little kick to it. The spice and the limey taste really made the dish stand out. 

Crab roll-these were good. I thought the price was kind of high for the four rolls we got, however, they were yummy. 

Salmon-Avocado Curry-I really enjoys this dish. It had a green curry with a big piece of salmon with eggplant, zucchini, and avocado. You can change it to any protein you like. I decided to stick to the salmon cause that's what they are known for. This was worth the $24 price tag. 

Crying Tiger Steak-grilled rib eye steak was just okay. We would pass on this dish next time.

5845956,2017-11-28,0,yp2nRId4v-bDtrYl5A3F-g,"TL;DR Don't get the drunken noodle. Don't get any noodles. Stick to fried rice or curry. Get the world famous spinach salad, but stay away from the thai ice tea.

This place for me was meh for me. Everything was great until I had the thai ice tea then it started going downhill.  

World Famous Spinach Salad: Rating: 5/5 The best part of the meal. Really good. If you com here, you have to get the world famous spinach salad. Come with an appetite as it will fill you up. Who knew spinach would be so good deep fried. 

Thai Ice Tea Rating 2/5 I expected better. It came in a wine glass instead of a tall glass. Honestly it wasn't that great, but at least it wasn't fake thai tea made from powder. I always get thai ice tea as it is a staple drink for any thai place. Meh #1.

Crying Tiger Steak Rating: 4/5 The sauce was very good with the steak. Medium rare. I feel like one of the best thing here is the sauce.

Drunken Noodle Rating: 1/5 Honestly this ruined my entire dining experience. Not only did it come out last and late compared to the crying tiger steak, but it was soggy and falling apart. I would stick a fork into the noodle and it would fall apart from it's own weight. Not only that, it was too salty, and the sauce flavor destroyed the entire dish. The only thing you could taste was the salty sauce. I talked to a waiter about it and he said it should be like that. What it tastes like is like leftover drunken noodle plates were recycled and recooked into my plate with some extra sauce to cover up the recooking process. I wouldn't even feed that to my dog. He might die from the sodium overload.",Q3_SHSsOVwdgBzovw8Vy3A,1,0,3,9Rb-bivEp_8nNVexDCp5iQ

The food here is not exactly authentic Thai, but the flavors and the dishes are incredible! The noodles are delicious, but come here for the appetizers/tapas! Tapas are good for sharing, and I've heard their potstickers and wings are delicious!  I ordered the Secret Spinach Salad....which, despite the name, is not at all a healthy dose of spinach. It's crispy fried spinach with an awesome tangy light dressing that is just a tad bit spicy....it's incredible. I also ordered the Crab Meat Fried Rice, which was very tasty and had some good chunks of crabmeat :) 

I will definitely be back to try some more dishes.  Decor is dark & romantic. Service is solid. Only thing is they don't really like to make substitutions/changes to the menu (ie we asked to remove the fried egg from the bangkok fried rice, but the waitress said no).",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,1,1,4,3G7a0xWns9LvRE-rCmOOrg

My first few visits were exclusively for dinner and they serve great options, but recently I've tried their lunch menu and they offer some exceptional meals at a good value. My favorites are the drunken noodles and any of their curries but I haven't had one thing at Nittaya's. The fried spinach salad is always a favorite and despite not usually liking deep fried food, this dish is always a treat.

I have had this restaurant bookmarked for awhile because I kept reading about the world famous spinach salad.  I love spinach.  And I love anything deep fried.  It is a match made in heaven.  

I met a friend for lunch here and upon entering we were impressed with the elegant and serene atmosphere. We decided to start off with the spinach salad to share, and each ordered from the $11 lunch menu.  

I now understand why this spinach salad is ""world famous"".  It was delicious.  Perfectly crispy, and the larb/lime dressing that accompanied it was fantastic.  I would eat salads (even non deep fried ones) everyday if I could pour that dressing on it.  

I ordered the Basil Eggplant and it also came with a small salad a potsticker, and my friend went with the classic Chicken Pad Thai. Everything was beautifully presented. And more importantly, tasted delicious.  I had stuffed myself silly with the spinach salad, but could not resist licking my entree plate clean.  My dish automatically comes at a spice level of 1 (on a scale of 5) and I upped to a 3 to give it that perfect kick. 

The service was sweet and friendly. Our fruit infused water glasses were never empty.
