But unfortunately they do recycled old food n either reheat or cook them to a point of begin unedible or hard to chew. But their saving grace is the cheap buffet price of $7.99 n the only Filipino buffet which serve Lechon (ROAST PORK BELLY).,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,0,0,3,9xAAu8q9Kt-E4Roj7BTbnQ

Far from it, but what I most love about Joy's restaurant is its stellar customer service. It feel exactly like a ""Kakainin"" place in the Philippines. When you enter Joy's the first thing they say to you is: ""Hello! Come in, take a seat and eat."" It's a buffet place so instead of asking you to pay first, they ENCOURAGE YOU TO GRAB YOUR FOOD AND EAT FIRST. You pay later when you're done eating and full. It feels like I came home from college to eat home made Filipino food at my Lola's (Grandma's) house. No fuss. Just come in and eat.
The owner herself, Joy, whom we call ""Ate Vangie"" (Big sister Vangie), is always there to welcome and greet patrons first.  She's there talking to you casually about anything and everything under the sun. We also get to meet the cooks who greets us with smiles and who always ask if we've eaten already and if we're full. The food they have are classic Filipino comfort food and the flavors are all, no exaggeration, magnificent. Just like how Mom and Lola make it. 
Joy's restaurant is a hole in a wall but what a gem this place is. This is our go-to Filipino restaurant when we feel the need to energize.

There aren't labels for the food; as a person with food allergies, it's a problem. The 7am crowd is made up of Filipino cab drivers getting ready for their morning shift.

I never heard about Joy's Filipino Restaurant & Buffet until another place near my work (Manila's Best) closed, which left me looking for another place nearby.  Glad we found her!

Located close to Charleston and Maryland, in what some would call an 'unsavory' part of town, Joy's is down home Filipino cooking you would find in your Nanay or Tatay's house.  Dang authentic!  If you like pork, and you like things in soup, and if you like bowls of white rice, you won't have any issue's at Joy's!  Sure you could order items ala carte, but make it easy and just go for the buffet!  Eat all of it!

We wandered into Joy's around the start of lunch.  Joy's is open for long hours, like 6:00 AM to almost midnight from what I've read depending on the day.  So since we got there in the brunching hour, some breakfast items were available with lunch!  I got to feast on some morning goodies - basically my favorite Filipino breakfast of hot rice, sweet longanisa, and scrambled eggs with tomato & onion!  So yummy!

But I didn't forget to have some lunch too!  More hot rice, with pancit, tarong (eggplant), lechon kawali, and a bowl of chicken papaya soup!  There were so many other things available that day like kare kare, guisadong pusit (sautéed squid), dinuguan (pork with pork blood, aka 'chocolate meat'), fried chicken, sinigang and much more!  I was just too full to try everything.

But quality of the food was there, fresh tasting, and close to what I'm used to eating when I was a kid.  Foods were kept hot, most things weren't sitting too long (some of the breakfast items were because they weren't going to be refilled since it was lunch), and the buffet line was kept very clean.  

OK, food is good but don't judge it based on environment.  Joy's buffet looks DATED.  Like the way my grandpa & grandpa decorated their house back in the 80's.  A similar green paint was used on their walls too!  It does look a bit unkempt and rickety when you look around the restaurant.  And...the bathroom is no real joy either.  Then again, the restaurant is housed in a strip mall that seems old anyway.  But it does vaguely resemble pics of my relatives houses back in the Philippines!  Don't focus on this and just go for the food.  Eat and be merry!

Food was well priced to boot.  All-you-can-eat buffet was only $6.99 per person!  Cheapie!  But I can't remember if it's cash only or if you can use a credit/debit card.

Oh, one more tip.  If you're rich and look rich, drive a luxury car, and resemble anything of a hipster...do not wander into this area where Joy's is too late into the night!  Dress down please!  No need to gather yourself unwanted attention because the lighting around there is very suspect.  I'm not gonna judge the homeless that hang around there (the one I offered food to was gracious), but just be aware of your surroundings.  Late night robberies can't be fun!

When we walked in we were greeted by a family sitting down at a table. They were all eating and we thought they were customers. But then they told us that we pay after we finish eating and that the plates and food were against the wall. They were nice but not very professional. We didn't see a fountain machine so we asked if there were any drinks and they pointed to a fridge and told us to take what we wanted. We didn't have any ice or cups so they brought us out cups, ice (in a bowl) and bendy straws and then sat down to finish eating. Once we finished a lady got up from the table and walked to the register so we could pay. It was very inexpensive and we were trouble bringing out change so she just took the $20 bill we gave her even the the bill was $22 dollars. It was nice but weird and a bit unprofessional but not in a bad way.

The food itself was was good. They didn't have any signs up for what the food was so I didn't know what I was eating. But I had some rice with some sort of meat and veggies. It tasted good but not spectacular. They had soups and meats and rice and not much else. The food selection was very scarce. It was literally one bar with different foods. I did go up for a second helping because it did taste good but I didn't know what I was eating. My father and his friend didn't much enjoy the food but they don't like Asian food much anyways.

Overall, i would have to say it was a strange experience. I don't know if I would come back (a little to laid back for my liking) but if you don't mind the good but unprofessional guest service I would recommend it. It was inexpensive and was alright.",y8reqP_kQC5jyQkDfsibmw,1,1,3,5meknFNZ2PKUTmgKm1Q2-w
