It was close to 11 PM when I went in, and I had the Hong Kong style crispy chow mein with shrimp and bok choy with some carrots in a white sauce.  I specifically asked it be cooked in a white sauce, as they will usually serve you a brown sauce unless specified.  I also had their pan fried potstickers.  I tell you, the chow mein was perfect for me, because they used the really thin noodles and fried it up.  With the sauce and the tender shrimp, it reminded me of some of the hole-in-the-wall Chinese eateries in San Francisco.  The potstickers were decent, too.  I had a very positive first experience here.

Now, the second time, I brought my family, and we had their family style combinations.  The Diamond beef was tasty, and we gave it a thumbs up.  We also ordered their sweet and sour pork, and I didn't like it at all.  The pork was difficult to chew, and I felt like I was chewing on the lowest cut of pork there was, as it seemed to be cartilagenous in some bites.  The sweet and sour sauce was OK, but it didn't mask anything when it came to the pork.  We also ordered the pan fried potstickers since they were so tasty during my first visit.  They came out, and they just didn't taste the same...like they were lacking in seasoning.

Also, too, the family combination meal comes with your choice of soup and we had the egg flower, and we had no complaints there.  They also had some appetizers--fried wonton and fried, battered shrimp.  The shrimp had a little smell to it as I bit into it, and upon mastication, I noticed it was starting to go rancid.  

How disappointing my second visit was from my first.  I think it's hit or miss with this place.  I will try them again, but if my third visit's a flop, I won't ever go back.",YgzjhRYTQXyOMFXHYG_2RQ,0,0,3,maMHr6pJBeBh7rRJoRPb5A

Then asked how long the hair was, because depending on the length or it it could be pork hair.... Either way it shouldnt  have hair in it period.

That was ok but I waited over an hour after ordering. When I got home there was white rice not fried rice..still ok . but there was no appetizers. When I called they said sorry not tonight why didn't they let me know when I was sitting there an hour. The lady was rude on the phone so I basically paid extra for allacart.

Me and my wife heard about this place from a friend who mentioned that the cook was a well known chef in China and had previouselly owned restaurants,that where very well liked and talked about.
We ordered the sweet walnut shrimp, the xo seafood hot pot and pan fried noodles. When the food was brought out there was no disappointment on our faces, the plates looked very full and deliciously. When we tasted the food it was the all smiles no disappointment at all.
After talking with the staff, we found out that it was under new ownership and that the cooks where indeed the ones that we heard where cooking there.
Please disregard the older reviews that have been written they have nothing to do with the new place.
Thanks for reading and order something new next time.",7WB9pBDtXTtDLEtRsNcA5Q,0,0,5,a8O5MPr6uJPcAs7SEXKBzQ

When my family gets together at this restaurant we always order several or more different entrees. Such as; Hongkong Style Pan fried noodles beef (crispy noodles with sauce), salted pork chop, salty fish fried rice, crispy fried chicken, crispy calamari, deep fried tofu with shrimp, crispy salty shrimp with shell, crispy pork belly, roast or Peking duck, spare ribs in black bean sauce, snow peas, honey walnut shrimp. Try the beef steak with black pepper sauce, the sauce is awesome. They have more in their menu that we usually try, like vegetable and beef dishes. sometimes they have great specials for fresh lobster, crab and fish dishes. 

They also have a very good lunch special menu. However, having several different menu items is the best way to experience the cuisine here.",HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,0,0,4,sCnuv1R1GwDLjfglLLv2zQ

2155108,2012-02-27,0,M990h0-4g-wpJN-qlnqFAg,"Don't let the location fool you, this little restaurant is good enough to be claimed as former Las Vegas Mayor, Oscar Goodman's favorite Chinese Restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The curbside appeal may look like a place you wouldn't take a second glance at to even bother to stop by, but Diamond China hits the spot when it comes to quantity and value as well as waiting time for both being seated and served your dishes.  Another great plus, is that this restaurant is open late...I believe till 2am.  Great for your late night adventures and wanting to ease your hunger.  Once entering the premises, the ambiance of the place feels calming, casual and relaxed...more like a Chinese Restaurant.  Lunch time may become a little on the loud side but that is expected at most casual restaurants.  The plates come small (which may or may not be a good thing)  One may take it as a good way to not eat as much and pile much food on...however, one may also want to keep getting more, thinking they may not have eaten enough.  Trust me though, you will not leave hungry.  Food portions per dish is your average size, but price is low enough that even if you have a group of 6-10 and you wanted to order 2 dishes of each, you would have more than enough and still keep it at a reasonable price.  When you get your bill, you will almost think they missed some of your order.  I may not be an expert in Wor Wonton Soup...but by far, this is the only restaurant that I have been to where the Wor Wonton Soup was on point and pretty authentic and not your cheap pot sticker style wonton.

The only downside to this, is about 2 times out of my many  visits, there have been other waiters who were not the usual waiters we always get.  It could be that they were not in the mood, or had a bad day...but the service at those two times were less than mediocre.  None the less, still unacceptable if they want to have repeat customers.  Other than those 2 times, everyone else has been on point.  I would definitely recommend  others coming here to give it a try.  This place may not be the best, but is one of my favorite Chinese Restaurants in Las Vegas.",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,3,2,4,58HHj97chMVQOHDR4R3hFQ

They are open till 2:00am Friday-Saturday and Sunday-Thursday 11:00-12:00am.

We ordered to-go and I was quite surprised how quickly they got our order cooked and ready. The food we got were #150-deep fried pork chops with pepper salt for $7.75 and the #130 boneless chicken with vegetables for $7.50 

The boneless chicken with vegetables was nice because there were different kind of veggies. I found the deep fried pork chops a bit on the salty side. Overall I thought the food was just average. Portions were small which was a bit disappointing. The sizes were not what I would think would be served for a dinner. It was small and not something I would expect for family style Chinese.

I like that this is open late & I like their quick service but other than that I found this place just so-so.",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,6,6,3,olCYdKyTw7NbqdyOueIFzg

The other star came from the service of the owner/waiter/bus person in one. When we came here for Saturday lunch, we were the only customer in the restaurant. It initially looked creepy too since there was just one individual inside which was the owner.

I decided to come here with my mom and aunt after a long day of shopping to give it a try. We ordered the $9.99 (per person) dinner deal. It comes with egg rolls, won tons, soup, pork fried rice and every one in the group picks an entree. I picked chicken chow mien, my mom picked shrimp with vegetables and my aunt chose egg foo Young. We also ordered a side of fried pork chops. 

I started off with the Won ton Soup . I like my soup just how I like my ice cream and Guacamole ...chunky! I liked the bits and pieces of Won ton and pork in the broth. I'm used to a much wimpier Won ton soup so this was refreshing! I also snacked on the huge fried Won tons and egg rolls while we waited for our meal. The fried won tons are a nice size and the egg rolls are okay. 

This was more like a feast all the plates could hardly fit on the table! The pork fried rice was yummy it is made with that sweet pork that I love so much! 

The chow mien was good but the noodles were a little too thick for my taste. This may sound nutty but I like the size of Panda Expresses noodles in their Chow Mien. 

This Egg Foo Yong was okay. This is the first time I've had it so I didn't know what to expect. It's a dish made with eggs and vegetables. It was okay. I didn't try the vegetables with shrimp because I was getting full. 

The Fried Pork Chops were really good. I've never had them before so I was expecting tough crunchy meat . It was crunchy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. It was a nice surprise!

The food was okay but the sweet and sour pork was very chewy it was weird, and the water was definitely tap like from a sink. 

Also at the end the lady over charged us. We asked to have our check split in two (there were four of us) and I told her several times I was going to leave a tip in cash and she charged us each extra 6$ so the server got 12$ for 4 people with horrible service. When I told her she just kept mumbling in another language. It was disgusting honestly.

I am a server so I do know how it works. Will never return.",wVkekb8v7bFRMKAYYHrLOg,1,0,1,56rM8ItCKwi-7kbSPJpHug

I really wanted to try it because I've seen the Chinese writing as we've whizzed by and it says they have things like jook, wonton noodle soup and much more.

We ordered wonton soup, bitter melon with beef, pei pah tofu (House special tofu) and some gai lan with oyster sauce.

Won ton soup -- this was the most disappointing ever. The wrapper was mushy and soggy, most probably overcooked! the filling wasn't tasty either with bits of gristle which I had to spit out. Don't order this!

Bitter melon with beef -- really flavorful! the beef was tender with generous portions of bitter melon

Pei Pah tofu -- a lot of places don't do this dish because it's a lot of work. this dish consists of mashed tofu with bits of shrimp and sometimes with scallions although this one didn't. I didn't think the tofu was as flavorful as it could've been, but still very nice, served atop a bed of garlic spinach.

Gai lan with oyster sauce -- all prime gai lan bits, very tender and perfectly cooked!

I liked everything except for the won tons. I would come back again for the regular dishes, not the won tons. The only complaint is that the food is on the greasy side. Otherwise, not bad at all.

I'd say 3.5 stars",nzsv-p1O8gCfP3XijfQrIw,5,4,3,tLcZ19wtVnUffAoIH0Hpeg

5366266,2015-09-05,0,M990h0-4g-wpJN-qlnqFAg,I was very frustrated with our visit for an early dinner. We had a party of 6 and were the only ones in the restaurant they sat us at a table maybe made for 5 and while we're trying to order she kept trying to order other things for us instead of what we were trying to order. Then we had to remind them that only 2 of the party received our drinks and we only ordered water and a coke but they couldn't remember we are the only people in the entire restaurant. Food was ok but it was so hot inside the place and when we asked if their air was working they acted as if they didn't know what we were talking about as my father in law was drenched in sweat and we ended up having him go out to the car and sit with the air conditioning while we boxed up everything. This horrible experience nearly cost $150.00 Unless you know them and will be treated like a human I would recommend go anywhere else's than here.,iYjl5n2WecRBJWSyTx6Jwg,1,0,1,zhGYHKzwpUt_uMaaObyRtA

Decent food, great service, always good food.  Today, we had the pork with steam bun, sold by the 1/2 dozen, minute chicken with cake noodle, sweet and sour shrimp, and a stuffed tofu.  All were seasoned well, and as usually, the service was great.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,2,0,4,LVPcocAmT3kq9T1PZeZQMw
5431447,2017-09-08,0,M990h0-4g-wpJN-qlnqFAg,This place was on dirty dining on channel 13. You can youtube it and find out how disgusting it is ( They found mold underneath cutting board). I'm not surprised that it got shut down by health department for many violations. I used to go here at least once a month for many many years. Then the price has gone up but quality has gone down so we stop going there. Last time we were there probably 2013. Suprisingly we didn't get sick from eating there consider how dirty that place was.,xTv0DzawFhJF4sl3mNFQFw,0,0,1,KuhnrTLh8JMpYfLFP9jwHw

The reason is that this establishment has lots its taste and style of cooking the reasons we have been goong for years.
One they renovated then they have new workers and or new management.
This was one of two restaurants I could get cake noodle like I can get from Hawaii.
Last night was the last straw. 
We alway order the same two dish everytime we eat there.
Minute chicken cake noodle and shrimp with snow peas.
How is this the last straw you ask.
Shrimp with snow peas had no taste at all.
Sloppy, less shrimp and no straw mushrooms. 
Minuate chicken cake noodle has no gravy and noodles was too wet non the inside and some of the outside edges was burnt.
Then to top ot off the waitress had a bad attitude when I asked did you get a new cook. No! Well where os the gravy on tje noodles.
My Hawaii Friends. Stay Away and don't waste your time and money. Go to the other local favorite.",LnX7-WmpML5bY6Fzlz468g,3,1,1,XmZSV9UYf2H5xtpnzecMoQ

This one consisted of crunchy Fried Shrimp, Wonton Soup with delectable filled wontons and a nice balance of ingredients, very well-prepared Pan-fried Dumplings with numerous dipping sauces, and Beef & Snow Peas with lean beef and very tender and tasty pea pods.  I also consumed a Seafood Hot Pot all by myself that was bubbling with broth and steam amid well-cooked vegetables and some of the best edible representatives from the sea, including luscious scallops.  And, Kung Pao Shrimp contained just the right amount of spice  to provide an authoritative kick but not overpower the flavor of the featured crustacean.

All dishes consumed this night were excellent!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,5,FK4_j_HG643DE8SpLuvyww
