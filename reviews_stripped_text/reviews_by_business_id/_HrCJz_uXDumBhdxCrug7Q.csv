992694,2011-05-20,0,_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q,"I finally got around to trying Laduca's, this is after being a frequent visitor of Minuto's which was formerly in its spot. I'm not a fan of Boar's Head meats which is what they serve so I opted to order an Eggplant Parm sandwich. I was told it'd be up in 5 minutes, it actually took 25. I took the sandwich to go, along with 4 links of hot Italian sausage. By the time I got back to my office to eat my lunch (less than 10 minutes) my sandwich was a soggy mess. This can be a good thing, but in this case it wasn't. This became a greasy disaster. I dislike when eggplant is masked by fried flavor. This was just that. I couldn't taste the eggplant at all, it could've been fried anything buried in acidic tomato sauce. 

I took the links home to grill. I haven't had much luck finding tasty sausage since Minuto's closed, I was hopeful Laduca's would be good. They were actually spicy, which was great because far too often ""spicy"" is purely mild. The sausages were dry and had a really chunky texture. I prefer a finer grind of the meat, and I assume more fat, because I like them juicy and bursting with flavor. Aside from the spice these lacked any rich flavor. I guess my search continues...",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,0,0,2,xmothEXpFh903N76eQwpDw

Their famous La Duca's Sandwich (which is sort of like an Italian sub). This deli makes their own bread, their own Italian dressing, canoles, mozzarella, and their own sauce! YUM! The owners are straight from New York, with loud Italian voices, and thick accents; who are always hilarious. I feel like I'm in a New York Deli in Brooklyn. Growing up Italian sometimes you miss those home cooked meals, and this place definitely gives you the sense of home. It is not a very nice restaurant in its décor, and is not expensive. The other best thing is that, they sell multiple items there, sort of like an Italian grocery store. You can find tomatoes and pasta from Italy, fresh meat like capicola, mortadella, and salami. I love this place!",n2HyyuQ18NnsB2slsxt37Q,1,1,4,WJhPU8yWZOkO8GUNxj8Geg

I'd been trying to get a rare roast beef sandwich in this town since forever and i finally found it one afternoon when I stopped in here.
I knew it would be promising when I saw the Boar's head signage ( the main supplier of all deli meat in NY). 

I ordered a roast beef hoagie on italian bread, which was thee juiciest, mouth drooling Rare RB sandwich I've ever had in Vegas. It was fantastic and Huge, so big you could share although I probably would never because it tasted that good.

3292154,2010-08-17,5,_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q,"I just finished one of Laduca's chicken cutlet heroes and I'm having trouble breathing correctly.

I have mixed feelings about Laduca's. As a foodie, I'm glad that there's a good italian deli mixed in with the overabundance of Subways, etc, but I'm upset that their sandwiches don't keep that well. Meaning, if I grab a sandwich in the afternoon to eat at night, the bread will get soggy and inedible. It seems petty, but I'm a petty guy, goddammit.

That said, the sandwiches are delicious if you eat 'em right away! The chicken parm hero is wonderful, the laduca's sub is bonerific... it's just simple, good quality sandwiches. No great shakes here, just a good Italian sammie. Solid tres estrellas from me.

3519628,2011-02-20,4,_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q,"I saw Peter A's review and pics of this place and decided to check it out for myself. First of all, I'm a Redskins fan. I was born and raised in the DC metro area and bleed burgundy and gold. So, it makes me uncomfortable to patronize a place with a Strahan and LT jersey hanging up on the wall.

But, I'd gladly walk into enemy territory to grab one of these sandwiches. The chicken parmigiana hero was delicious. It was filled with a large, tender and lightly breaded piece of chicken cut into two strips and covered with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. The hard roll was equally tasty, with a good amount of crunch on the exterior and a chewy interior. The bread was fresh. Baked in-house, I believe.

I had this place bookmarked, but forgot about it until she mentioned that I might enjoy the Laduca Hero.  So, I made the drive out to this joint as soon as I could fit it in my schedule.  The place serves fresh food and also deli items to take home....and it's decked out in New York Giants stuff....pennants, posters, pictures, etc.  I came here for the food, not to watch sports, so what do I care?!

Here's the breakdown of what I ordered:

Laduca's Hero $7.49 (Proscuitto, Cappocolla, Mortadella, Salami, Provolone, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Dressing)

I started with the Laduca's Hero Sandwich, which was pretty big.  The Bread is a Hard Roll Italian Bread.....so if you're not into Hard Rolls, this may not be for you.  The combination of Meats and ingredients was very good and tasty.  I could have used more Dressing on it though....it was a little dry, but I enjoyed the Sandwich very much.  Fresh ingredients and well made Sammie!

Next up was the Slice of Sausage Pizza.  This year's Bender Tour has been the Year of the Sausage Pizza.....I don't know, but I've been craving it this time around.  The Crust is New York Thin Crust and there is a ton of Cheese on this bad boy!  If you want to eat this with your hands, you have to fold it.....otherwise you have no chance.  The Sauce is minimal....it could have used a little more Sauce in my opinion.  The Sausage was excellent.....freshly made and full of flavor....yum!

Overall, it was a pretty good experience....food solid, service OK.

The La Duca sandwich is a favorite, and I can usually save half of this huge sandwich for another meal. The meatballs are seriously the best I've ever found, and the garlic knots are incredible. People who work there are fast and personable. Things will slow down in the deli on a Sunday when the Giants are playing, but... ;o)",vLwojtbBMDLwHJPdIDy0ww,0,0,5,Qp9r1ijhxQlbJeC9YZjZEA
4054801,2011-02-18,1,_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q,"My lunch buddy at work grew up in New York City, and I think she has been a little homesick lately. She keeps wanting to go to places owned by New Yorkers for lunch. I'm usually down to try new places so I don't mind. Her most recent lunch spot was Laduca's New York Italian Deli. 

It was a busy day at work so we called and had the employee that answered the phone fax us over a menu so we could place a to-go order. I ended up deciding on the Laduca's Hero which was $7.49. She got the eggplant parm platter for $8.99. 

My sandwich was HUGE with lots of meat. LaDuca's serves Boars Head meats, which I love. The sandwich was huge enough that half of it was plenty for me, and I saved the rest for the following day. As Seth Y. mentioned in his review, the bread gets soggy when you save part of it. If Laduca's sold half sandwiches I would go that route for sure...

Since my co-worker went to pick up our order, I can not fairly comment on the service. I definitely plan on eating here again in the future.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,DJhAjOQDk0Q1e4BsHXgb5Q

We started off with the Garlic bread which was the only thing that I didn't find salty. It was a good size and it had a mild garlic and buttery flavor to it. Then I followed that with a Pastrami sandwich which was loaded with meat. I would normally not have any objections to it but I couldn't handle the salt. I've tasted pastrami before that isn't salty so I know it exists. Then my husband ordered the sausage and pepperoni pizza. He is more tolerant to salt than I am and he had a hard time eating it. We usually love left over pizza the next day but we both couldn't handle the salt and the grease we ended up chucking the pizza. If you are sensitive to salt this may not be the best place for you. 

I hate writing bad reviews so I'll will end this on a positive note. I liked the fact that they also had an area where you can buy fresh Italian deli items that you can take home.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,2,0,2,Zz4U5px984AIEjxuiMFUNA
5199612,2010-04-09,15,_HrCJz_uXDumBhdxCrug7Q,"The other day when my husband picked me up and needed to head somewhere without me I told him he could just drop me off somewhere, and I could get some work done. Never trust him to drop you off anywhere by the way because he has a bad sense of a good place to chill. His number one idea was Discount Tires. What? Yeah, apparently they have a clean waiting area and free coffee. I know that, but call me crazy; I would start to feel a little self-conscious hanging out in a tire store. I'd probably end up with a set of Kumho's out of guilt. His second idea was Smith's grocery store, which he insisted had a café area. I am fairly sure they don't. We were getting into an escalated disagreement about acceptable places to hang out. Starbucks was nowhere in sight, and finally, I just said: ""Take me to Subway.""

He took me to Smith's. Sometimes I think we speak a different language. 

I was not about to sit in the produce section with my computer, so I roamed around the shopping center and landed here. I only purchased something out of obligation. They have a Lavazza machine with cartridges. I opted for the chai cartridge. It is really sweet, and at $2.50 for a smaller than small cup, a little overpriced, but it was the price of entry for a table and a wireless signal. They have deli offerings, pizza and a couple of lads in front of me were pooling their money to purchase some cannolis. For the beverage, I would probably say 1-star, but they have so much else that I did not sample that bestowing 1-star would be just mean.

The café portion is sizeable, and the TVs were showing a news channel. I wouldn't head there just to hang out or to purchase coffee or tea, but when you are in tight spot being held hostage by someone who wants to drop you off at a tire store, it's a refuge. 3-stars simply because they have Wi-Fi.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,11,3,UHRglivJhlHIYO8bheTulQ
