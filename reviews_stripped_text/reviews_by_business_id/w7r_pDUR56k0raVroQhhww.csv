25170,2013-10-21,0,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"Went there on a Sat. late afternoon about 5:30pm. Not crowded. Met some friends at the party table. 30 minutes later no one had taken even our drink order. Finally was able to wave over a waiter and ordered drinks and dinner together since we had a show to go to that evening. 45 minutes later dinner came and the orders for all of us were completely mixed up. No one got the right side order with their entrees. Wife's BLT must have been sitting for quite a while because it was cold. Two of the fish & chips orders must have been sitting with the BLT because the fish coating had gotten soggy. (People had come in after us and gone before us fed and watered). Have to say though  the food (ignoring the time it had sat before being served) was good, and was priced right. Good beer choices and prices. The manager was called so we could vent to him, but he never came, but he did take 15% off the bill. I would have given them 5 stars if the waiters had been more attentive and the food had not sat so long before being served. The wait staff seemed very busy doing nothing in particular - just running to a n fro.  (These waiters want $15.00/hour? Oh please!) Hopefully, we were there on a VERY bad night. They do deserve a second try, which we will do in the near future.

OK, so I said I would give this place another chance. Our first visit was only rated as a 2 star. On this visit our experience was 180 degrees opposite. It was great and was what all pubs should be. We were seated in a booth immediately upon entering. Within 8 minutes our beer order was taken and we were drinking. (It was 2 for one night). Our food orders were taken just after the drinks were served and we had our food about 10 minutes after we ordered. Service was super! Our food was what we expected-tasted very good and was piping hot. We will visit again and try other menu items when we venture to Vegas again.",vm-krY_4TEecncrqEAGWQg,0,0,5,AyEA810D5mbu1KiKSVPn9w

99959,2015-09-28,2,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"My guy and I came in here for dinner last Friday night. The place was quite busy but we were helped right away so that was a great sign. We took advantage of their BOGO beer special from 4 - 7p. A couple of large mugs of ice cold refreshment for less than $6? How about HELL YES? We didn't even have to ask for another round, they asked and brought it right over. 

We ordered the Caesar Trojan Burger with Onion Rings and the Fried Chicken in a Basket. Both super yummy. We had a good buzz going and obviously weren't thinking very clearly because we ended up ordering dessert as well: Sinful Frozen Cappuccino Sundae Pie and Incredible Hot Bourbon Brownie Sundae. Both were very rich but oh so good. I think we'll skip the sugar overload next time though. 

I'm glad I read and trusted some of the good reviews for Steiner's. I can't believe we waited this long to check it out. This may very well be our new hang out spot!",GLp5vueztLtd8HtcvqvhBw,2,2,5,Xc-SXJC9jIOldkPMXtadtg
124278,2012-06-14,1,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"So I still don't get this whole ""Nevada style pub"" crap and I've been here for over 8 years now, but if someone claims that one of said pubs has a great burger, I'm always up for the challenge. These pubs seem like every other generic, chain-looking venue that I've seen in every other state I've been to so I don't know what makes them ""Nevada styled"" but whatever. Anyway, today's pub in question is Steiner's, not really a spot that was on my radar for any reason until someone recently suggested it. And I must say, once again I was a bit surprised.

As I said earlier, the interior is pretty typical for a 'pub'; dark wood floors, dark wood tables, and a ton of neon beer signs. But I don't think you're ever going to one of these places for the ambiance. The menu has pretty much anything you can think of in the genre of American comfort food, and their website actually claims it is 'sophisticated' at that. Click the link for the full menu rundown as it's too much to list here. Speaking just about burgers, they offer a few great sounding choices mostly named after casinos on the strip. They all sound pretty good, and I'll potentially be going back to try a couple others.

This time around I decided to skip the casino themes and go with the Kobe burger: ""beer fed, hand massaged and sake brushed beef served on a sweet sourdough bun with Maui onions and aged white cheddar cheese, heirloom tomato and leaf lettuce."" What came out looked somewhat unassuming, but tasted fantastic. The Kobe had terrific flavor and was cooked perfectly. The orange-colored heirloom tomato was a great touch; I only wish it was a tiny bit bigger so it could stand out more. The cheese was melted, a bit too subtle but good. The Maui onions were sweet and great, but a bit too much for me so I pulled them out halfway through. The bun was super dense, soft and delicious. Almost like a Hawaiian sweet roll and a sourdough had a baby. Overall this was a fantastic burger, and a total surprise.

The fries were good too. I didn't like the a-la-carte option or the $4.39 price tag, but you do get quite a lot for the price. Some slightly undercooked for my taste but good overall. What isn't good is that my burger, fries and drink came to $22.39 which is way too high for a single burger meal in a local's spot, even if it is a great burger. With a price point like that it's still tough to fight with the price of something like the Dispensary Lounge even if it is a damn good burger.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,1,4,13f0n0azbPakLnu81vvpvw
168867,2009-07-29,0,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"For being a ""pub,"" Steiner's offers great food.  My party all ordered burgers, which while not amazing, we're all solid.  Loved the fries, very well seasoned (Reminded me of the good ol' days of Rally fries).  The best part?  The stimulus package special!  We went on Monday, so all of the burgers were marked down.  $6 for each specialty burger (plain and cheese were $5)!  Great deal...Think they also had a prime rib special that night as well, although we didn't try it.

As someone mentioned early, it is definitely a sports bar.  Tons of TVs all over the place and loads of games going.  Service was decent...Nothing to complain about on that front.

Overall a great place to catch a bite to eat and watch a game!",RBLYqYof74vucvFvjKf9WA,0,0,4,EvicMZfNmCsstS5VE7CDrg

Located a few miles south of the strip, it has restored our faith in finding great, reasonably priced food in this hit and miss town. Even better, it is open 24/7 catering to night owls! The decor is reminiscent of an old hunting lodge invaded by a casino/sports bar. The clientele is a mix of locals and tourists, and surprise surprise, no one under 21 allowed, making Steiner's a kid-free zone, so take note weary parents!! Treat yourself to a sitter! The wait staff were warm and friendly without losing any of their efficiency. When they weren't serving they were cleaning, the place is immaculate!!

Situated just south of over priced drinks, spray tans, and hundreds of call girl cards on the street sits this 24 hour spot, ready to serve all of what you are looking for in drink menus and pub fare. 

Three things yelp friends: 

1. Hands down the best chili I have ever had. Nabbed some off the old mans plate of a chili burger. Sweet, tomato tang and full beef flavor. One of those true staple foods way too god like to describe. 

2. On bone lamb chops; I am used to Vegas buffets and churn n burn eateries throwing out ""high end fair"" for sub par prices and it is typically get what you pay for. This is different; under 12 bucks for 6 small lamb chops grilled extra rare and served with horse radish. Stop reading and order these. Seriously. Call ahead and order them. 

3 horse radish sauce; the king of sauces as far as I see it. Beautiful in in balance of a brine and slight heart but no where near over powering. Perfectly seasoned for those aforementioned rare lamb chops. Even my heat and horse radish phobic girlfriend celebrated this.

Decent food, prices are cheap. Potato salad left much to be desired, though. Atmosphere was pretty generic, but it's nice for a pub.

The best food I've eaten at Steiner's is their meat loaf, which most of the time is exceptional served with good mashed potatoes and gravy. The worst I've had at Steiner's are the ""buffalo shrimp,"" which are little more than overcooked, battered medium-large shrimp. 

The shrimp I was served were so overcooked, they had coiled tightly like tiny springs. Of course that made them almost unfit to eat.

Their chili is better than Winchell's or Village Pub, but the burgers at Steiner's are nowhere near as good as those at most Village locations, but slightly better than the ones at Winchell's.

Their burgers are juicy and actually taste like meat because they don't cook the hell out of them like so many chain restaurants do. The meat is actually still pink in the middle heaven forbid! Their breakfast is also really good. The hash browns O'Brien that come with just about all the breakfast dishes are great and not too greasy and the biscuits and gravy are nothing to sneeze at either.,SZ2xh6svdSJSG02qcj6z6w,0,0,4,kAdgVCeN1sdg06EbctJOTw

I liked the place before and it still met my expectations. Atmosphere is laid back, seat yourself, dark pub. One thing I learned this time was they have no kids seats. And really no Kids menu. (though you can order them a grill cheese or quesadilla for $4.99) Losing some stars there. 

I had the Kobe Burger, which was delicious. Big, Juicy, with some Maui onion, aged cheddar and heirloom tomato. Though for $13.99 they could throw in some fries. My wife had a Reuben sandwich which she liked. 

Beer list is good, not great. I did have a Rouge hazelnut brown 22oz. for $5.75 off draft, so not bad there. 

All in all the food and atmosphere, meet expectations for a standard pub. Worth going to if that is what your looking for.",x16Fl_5h9aX4tn38kKSGHw,0,0,3,zIAK-ShjdeHp6_MrgiZrlQ

What that means is the bartender caters to everyone playing poker machines while those who don't have to patiently wait. Part of the reason is because the owner encorages special treatment from those dropping hundreds away, but the other part is the server casting tip spells on the customer by random jibberish.

Most recently I went to Steiners with my husband on a Friday night because we had a coupon in our 2011 Entertainment coupon book. BoGo. Not too shabby since we love Steiners. 

The place was not very busy and we were able to sit right away. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. My husband was thrilled because he got to watch sports while we waited. 

We started out with a couple of Blue Moons and an order of Onion Rings. GET THE ONION RINGS. Yum, drool. Unless of course you are on a diet. Then maybe not. In fact, don't. But luckily it was Friday after 5pm and all calories from Friday at 5pm to Sunday at midnight don't count so we were OK. If it were not for our tight budget, we would have ordered another round of Moons and Rings. 

For dinner I had the Kobe Beef Burger and my husband had the Fish n Chips. The burger was fresh, full of flavor and cooked to order. The Fish n Chips were cooked to perfection and we were both happy campers. 

Overall we are never disappointed by Steiner's. Every time we come I leave thinking, why don't we come here more often?

Their menu has a lot of variety and during happy hour the prices for apps are good. Those I think they need to make their nachos bigger in some way. There is literally like 12 nachos. They are delicious though no doubt. 

Beer selection is also fabulously wide. They had Kronenbourg 1664, which is my favorite when I am not going cheap beer like ultra and bud light. I love when places carry this because it makes me happy to see it. 

The service is also one of the best. Jessica is on top of things as a bartender and so is...I want to say Shana but the cute blonde with glasses is the best description I have. She is fun to talk to and is also on top of it. 

One thing I do not like, is the fact that 25cent gambling is actually 50cents, but one day when I win there it will pay out more. I just like taking my time with keno, making my 20bucks last. :)

They apparently run specials on Miller products which qualify patrons w/ tickets for a drawing of random sporting items. It is quite loud during that time if you're sitting at the bar. The bartenders are very mindful of their usuals & even the newbies when someone needs a drink or a refill. We ended up moving from the bar to a booth due to it being too loud. We ordered an nachos as an app. When asked how big the nachos were, the server replied w/ 12 nachos. We both repeated back, '12 nachos?!?', 'yes 12 nachos'. Sure enough when they arrived there were 12 nachos each w/ all the toppings on them, sauces of sour cream, guc, & salsa in ramikans in the center. Def not worth the price for just 12 nachos, plus it took the fun out of eating them since we couldnt pick or pull chips apart. The server was very tentative to our requests & needs. Drinks were right on par. Naturally due to the game it was packed. The only other bummer is that they do not have a patio as it sits in a strip mall parking lot. 

We ended up coming back here 2 nights later & it was like night & day from the last time we were there. Less people were in the bar, but same amount of staff, yet it took longer to get a drink at the bar than 2 nights prior & it was busier. We ended up moving back to the same booth we were at 2 nights prior & no one came to tend to us until about 30 minutes of us sitting down.

No shift change actually happened either. The same employees were still walking around. By the time we got our food, we were about to get up and walk out.

So my group called a cab and traveled halfway across the city to eat here and everyone was disappointed. All of us were STARVING and no one finished their food. Entrees we purchased included the Orleans chicken sandwich, pork sandwich, burger, and Philly cheesesteak. We all agreed that the cheesesteak was the best but it wasn't anything above average. Penn station has cheesesteak that is just as good and they are fast food. Furthermore, our waiter wasn't attentive at all.

Steiner's is at the corner of Blue Diamond and Las Vegas Blvd.  Close to the Strip but far enough south that the prices are reasonable and it's mainly locals.  Their menu is large and they have a nice variety of different sandwiches both hot and cold.  I settled with a Reuben on toasted marbled rye and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was tender and flavorful and very filling.  The potato salad was just OK (a bit on the salty side).  Our waitress said they don't make it there.  My friend got the club sandwich on rye which was HUGE.  It was so massive that he took half to go.  We opted to just stick with soda instead of drinking but this looks like a cool place to have some cocktails and play video poker.  I will definitely be back.

The negatives- Not once did our server ask us if things were ok. She was not very attentive to us at all and we could rarely even see her when we needed her.

1920720,2010-10-13,1,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"On a 5-star scale, i'll start them at 5, because the food we had was very good. We ordered from the happy hour menu, got hot wings, and some polish sausage sandwiches with cole slaw.  Both came with some yummy Brew City fries.  The wings were hot, crispy, and very very spicy.  The sausage was nothing special, but good.  The problem is, this ""friendly locals pub"" was less than friendly, to say the least.  

Subtract 1st star, because...  the ditzy bartender told us it wasn't happy hour yet when i asked about specials (it was THREE MINUTES before happy hour). Subtract 2nd star because the ditzy bartender told us she had no clue what was on their happy hour menu that had conflicting specials..  We asked her about a local beer, what type it was, and she said ""um, it's kind of like (shrug) beer.""  Hello?  Anybody home?

We continue to play video poker while waiting on Monday Night football to start.  Subtract 3rd star because we were ignored once our food was served. I found out later why.  OK, We are now down to two stars. It's hard to play seriously while we are eating so we didn't hit the poker that hard while eating. Of course, the people near us were doing the same thing, so didn't think THAT was a problem. UNTIL Ditz bartender goes off duty.  

We finish food, and just before i start playing again, a new bartender shows up. He hands us our check and said he needed the machines. Really? We played, ate, drank, and are continuing to play. His answer? They needed our spot for their ""regulars"" to watch Monday night football. MNF is WHY we went there in the first place.   One more star gone.  And, it's not like they comped a drink either for playing.  We tend to go to ""locals"" pubs instead of places on the strip, and this is the first time we've EVER been treated poorly, and not been comped at least 1 drink for playing video poker.  There goes the last stars. Zero stars for them.  

So, we moved to a table to finish my beer (no, he didn't even let us sit there till i finished it.) Apparently this is standard practice, 'cause i said something to another server, and they just said, ""oh, ok"". Now they are at -1 stars, and i can't rate them that low.  Sadly, Yelp forces me to give them at least 1 star.

If you're a regular in LV, then i'm sure Steiners is OK -  good food, fair beer selection, reasonably priced.  But, just be aware that they do cater only to the Locals, and really don't care about visitors.",8KrPwxNIt2CMXP3n55WVfg,1,0,1,N45PJmDZG6I5SdSpo5_4gQ

2069227,2010-07-09,0,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"Steiner's, a Nevada Style Pub on LVBs is one of those places that I don't quite know how to describe. It is a sports bar, Irish feel pub, and restaurant all in one. From what I see they seem to be pulling it all off with good beer, plenty of sports on screens all over the place, and good food.

My wife and I come there most often for breakfast which they do pretty well. They are not the ""Egg and I"" (yay) nor the ""Hash House A Go Go"" (yuck) but a happy medium. I usually get the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs which they do well and of course there is your usual Two Egg Breakfast that is done well and reasonably priced. (It is hard to review breakfast food; it's hard to screw up breakfast.) The hash browns are good with red and green bell peppers for added flavor and interest and they use heartier bread than most other places. In all; breakfast done right.

They also have a pretty extensive lunch and dinner menu and I know the appetizers are all tasty. Personally I like the beer battered onion rings. The burgers are large and juicy and they even offer a Kobi Burger although I have not tried it... yet.

The staff is professional, friendly and responsive to their customers needs. The facility is clean and well kept. If I had a complaint at all about the restaurant it's that it's too dark. They offer a selection of free mags in the foyer (City Life, LV Weekly, etc) but it is so dark reading them is a challenge. That also means reading the menu is a challenge. It's not as if turning up the lights would reveal a shabby establishment; there is a lot of beautiful custom wood work all around and it might be nice if they showed it off making reading easier.

If you are a regular be sure to get the ""loyalty card"" and present it with your bill each time to dine or drink. After 200 points they send you a $20.00 gift certificate and they have specials and birthday offers as well. It's worth the effort for the perks.

This qualifies as one of my ""Cheers"" locals because when we come in (usually for breakfast) the crew knows our order and how we like it. Isn't it great becoming a regular at a restaurant you like? It makes dining all the more relaxing and I for one am looking for a relaxing time when I go out to eat.

So, why do I give Steiner's only 3 stars? Here is my breakdown for stars that I have been meaning to post somewhere:

1 Star: I am not coming back to this place unless you pay me and may not even then. The experience here was so bad I want it to be forgettable but it will probably linger in my memory like a tuna sandwich that sat out too long and is now sitting in my stomach reminding me of its' presence with every wicked burp.

2 Stars: The experience here is forgettable but I would return if I must. In this case the food is edible, the staff is passable, and the environment is at least clean when they put down paper mats, but I will not be chasing any rolling meat balls and taking advantage of the five second rule. You know the type of place; they are usually called 'greasy spoons' which are far too common for my taste.

3 Stars: These are nice places and I would have no problem returning. The food is good but not great, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the facility is obviously clean and maintained. While I am still not chasing wayward meat balls I might think about if they don't go too far. It will be a place I will remember as a positive experience and on my regular or semi-regular places to go.

4 Stars: These establishments have shown me something special in some way. It may be the food is exceptional (usually they have spiced their offerings a little more liberally or prepared then exceptionally), or the service is very good and the staff is friendly and always with a smile, or the environment is memorable and offers something that is not at every other place around town (like live music but not 20 screens in a sports bar). 4 star places are places I will treat myself to when I want to feel special or for a special occasion. (My wife and I have a Thai place and a couple others on this short list.)

5 Stars: A 5 star restaurant has be is something really special but this does not mean expensive or fancy. For a place to rate 5 stars for me I have to have a ""long term relationship"" with them. I have to know that going there is ALWAYS a great experience or the food is GREAT, not just exceptional or good. As of this writing I have only posted two 5 star establishments and it may be a while until I add any more. For me giving a 5 star rating means the place is special on many levels, be it the food, service or environment or a combo. I plan on giving out very few 5 star ratings.

So, Steiner's falls right smack dab in the 3 star zone and I am happy for it... and so should you. Give them a try, there is a lot to like there.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,3,1,3,y72haAFpFrCvUwoc6RH9aA

The service was average. Our waitress only came by a few times. She was nice and helped us (though we had to ask for something three times). We even had an alcoholic drink, but was not given any better service. She was busy, but she attended the bar more than her tables. I don't blame her, but it was frustrating as a table customer. 

The food was good. The burger was amazing! The daiquiri was good and the Dr. Pepper was good. 

It was too expensive though. $60 for two burgers, one thing of fries (burger alone was $20) one daiquiri and and one coke. The food was good, but not that good. 

Between the service and the price, we will not be back. The food was the only thing that saved it. Maybe going on a non-game night would be better if you want to try it. Just be prepared for a little extra price.",kmHg50YULeTSe-bJqgGZ8w,0,0,3,Tio_SFKG_xr_LQK79KyMOQ

Once they start helping us they are very freindly and pretty good but getting to that point is always a relatively long wait.  I we sit at the bar service I totally on the ball.

the good....
 While staying in the area, we were looking for a good place for a quick bite & dropped into Steiners, nice place, great video screens, plenty of games playing. Lovely waitress, fast service, yummy chicken fingers & good meaty chilli, great selection of beers. I'd normally say 4 stars.....   but wait......
  Later that day our group of 8 wanted to go out & do some 'partying' at dinner & dropped in just before 10pm.  When it took a while to get seated, we poked around because the guys were busy playing video games, we seated ourselves.  After sitting around 10 minutes we got our orders placed & waited & waited and finally ate 45 minutes later.  We were 'this close' to walking out, but we stuck it out.  The food was average, some cold, some ok, but very average. One of our meals didn't show up, I got up & went back to the kitchen to see what was up & they were just finishing it up.  Pretty pathetic for what is supposed to be a 24hr place.  Other members of our party would think I'm being very gracious & be much more critical than I.  We had the feeling this was a late night staff that didn't care about what has happening there. From this experience I can't imaging our coming back.  After the horribly slow service, they put an automatic 18% tip on....  ah ha.... that works two ways...NO INCENTIVE to provide decent service.   Very disappointing.

This place was packed on a Thu night but don't think it's an ideal spot to watch games- tvs were small and we came to watch an Okc/Mia game about as premier matchup as you can get and it was only on maybe 1/4 of the tvs with no volume.  Most tables I observed were talking, eating, drinking.

I decided to check out Steiner's as I had heard some good things and thankfully I was not disappointed. They have a few locations in town and this one sits a few miles south of the strip on LV Boulevard. 

They definitely went for mining/ore cart theme as a throwback to Nevada's history. Pictures of gold panhandlers, picks and axes adorn the walls. The menu was pretty standard bar fare: cold and hot sandwiches, burgers, salads, and a few specialties. My club sandwich was great, perfect amounts of meat and bread and they subbed out the ham for extra turkey. I love the fact that Steiner's serves up beer battered fries instead of the soggy/salty spuds you get at other places. They had a nice twist on the nachos as well:  about a dozen large tortilla chips each individually built, topped with beans, cheese, and all the other fixings you could want.

Service was pretty standard, our server came by regularly with refills and condiments, no chit chat, straight to the point. The bar gets big props for having a large craft beer selection. The beer menu is extensive, with many small and local microbreweries featured alongside with the standard domestics.

Looks can be deceiving !  Although it was very dark inside, like so many other LV bars, it was surprisingly clean, cool, and most important, well ventilated.  Plenty of people were smoking in there, and at first I was put off by that, but after a few moments I noticed the lack of smoke. Bonus!  

The food was A-OK!  I had the fish and chips, and they were just fine.  Not greasy, decent coleslaw, and crisp fries.

The quality of the ""lettuce"" (it's not supposed to be white) in the house salad was so poor I could barely find more than a few green leaves. I sent it back and our server was nice enough when I said I didn't like it, however he left it in the bill and it was worked into the price of the Fish & Chips basket at $12.99 even though it shows as ""add a house salad for $2.00"" which has me wondering if I was being scammed. I pointed it out to the server and he offered to void out the first and rerun it, however to save myself from being inconvenienced, I just took $2.00 off my 20% tip. The pieces of fish were somewhat thin, the coleslaw was too stringy with not enough mayo or flavor. The Saturday special pot roast was tasty, as were the lumpy, in a good way, mashed potatoes, although the veggies were under seasoned.

The decor in the bar is very distracting but oh so appealing. Great eye candy. The bar is so very well stocked with all sorts of delicious flavors of alcohol and liquors to mix together to make wonderful spirits. We decided to sit at the bar and did have to wait just a few minutes for the bartender to come over to us.

The bartender did give me the universal nod stating that he say me and will be over as soon as he was free. Being on that we were on a beer kick already we opted to stay with the same type of alcohol. I ordered a Coors Light when the by bartender get a free moment, and my sister had Budweiser.

4201977,2014-05-16,0,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"So... I've been here a couple times now. First for just drinks with friends who we were visiting. They love this place and frequent it all the time. My boyfriend and they all say they love the place for its beers and great food but on my last day in town that was not what I experienced. 
We decided to get our last bite to eat in town before hitting the road since we were staying right across the street. Sad we just missed breakfast:( so instead I ordered their Friday special hot valley Thai salad with shrimp. (Shrimp were perfectly cooked & seasoned) and I was eager to enjoy the rest of it, I even took a pic because it looked soooo good..but I could not eat more than two bites without my mouth scorching on fire as my face turned bright red!! No where on the menu did it mention it had those thin red and green super spicy chilis chopped up in there WITH THE SEEDS! My mouth was on fire! U can't serve raw chopped chilis with seeds in a salad. What if an elderly person ordered the dish took a bite choked and died?!? I'm not even kidding! people have sued and won for careless little things like that. Regardless, It was impossible to pick all those peppers out. Even after taking a bite of my boyfriends sandwich (since I couldn't eat my salad) he said the heat from my mouth must have got on his sandwich because his next bite was so spicy! Lol (the BLT was pretty good btw!) and we can handle spice but this was just unbearable. The dressing was not the best pair either, chili lime vinaigrette? Too soy-vinegary.. maybe a creamy cilantro lime ranch with the chilies incorporated would be better, but even ranch didn't help cut the heat.  
I know it's just a salad but it was one of the first and only plates I've ever had to send back. And it's not just about a flop order, or menu misprint... 
But the overall dining experience.  
Our waitress was great, excellent service on her part. Yes, she promptly came back and politely said she would comp the plate , asked if I wanted anything else, (no we had to hit the road) and she was friendly! 
The manager however, who we noticed walking around talking to his regulars and players at the tables not far from us, did not even have the respect for his establishment to address or acknowledge a comment or concern from a paying customer who could possibly become a regular in the future! Our friend who was paying for the meal is also a restaurant manager and he was very upset at how this manager handled my experience. Which is why I had to turn to yelp. At least come by when you walk RIGHT past us with a simple ""oh you didn't like it? Sorry"" nothing! At best a manager would offer to replace the meal, as their customer would like it, with no cost.  But he probably just grumbled to himself and assumed I was being a nuisance.  Not the case sir, maybe you were having a bad day but I hope you step up your customer service and treat all your guests hospitably, not just those who are throwing money into your table games. Disappointed :(",tX_JTUWFciERx6SC5q0KFw,3,0,2,dP0uPO9EWTzsrVEhvSJA-Q

Prices are decent and great proportion too.   This place is a pub/bar/restaurant.  

Service:  Service here is very nice and friendly.  Waitor and waitress always come by to check up on us once in a while to see how the food are etc and I think that is really kind of them to care about their customers.  

Hot wings: I think they have the best hotwings there.  Their wings are big and juicy and very flavorful.  Bigger than Wings Stop's wings and KFC.  The wings comes with seasoned fries and they're really good.  Ranch, Celery, and carrots on the side for your veggies.  You can add a side of extra hot sauce if you like to eat it with more flavor, but yea I am missing those wings right now!   

We had also ordered one of their burgers but I can't recall its name but it was very delicicious too.  All their burgers are named after a hotel from the las vegas strip area :) .   Their Chinese chicken oriental chicken salad was awesome too.  

Before we left LV to head back home, we ate here one last time for breakfast and another order of hotwings to munch on.  

Overall, we really enjoyed eating here for great food, good service, good price, and yummie wings.  We will return the next trip to Vegas.

Burger - A standard burger, but whooo can complain about such a large burger with all the elements and a side of bomb fries? For only $6 or so?

Wings - Same goes to these, so cheap with maybe 10 or so wings and a side of awesome fries!! Free ranch and blue cheese dressing too 

Fish and Chips - I don't have to go off about fries again but the fish was super tender, came with three large pieces 

Calamari - Standard Calamari

All in all, a great place to grab late night munchies, drinks, and chill with friends :)",ZIqedypXkcheImJ28pUSGw,3,0,5,muVCNq_xStA4txuMj6JGsg

4851107,2011-08-25,0,w7r_pDUR56k0raVroQhhww,"I really enjoy Steiner's, and I would say it is one of the better ""local"" bars to go to.  Food is reasonably priced and the drink specials are great.  They have a better than average beer selection, although a great deal of that is bottled.  There are a lot of televisions which is great if you are a sports fan.  

As far as seating goes, they have two cool features:

1 - There is a long table in the center of the room that probably seats 20.  They will take a reservation even for a Friday or Saturday night.  If you and a bunch of friends want to go out drinking and not have to worry about getting a table all together, this is definitely a good spot.

2 - There is a large round table that has Guiness and (I believe) Bass on draft right at the table.  You pour for yourself and pay by the ounce.  Not a bad option!

When you go, you will find that they have a happy hour from 3 - 7pm which includes reduced price appetizers and 2 for 1 drinks.  This, however, is somewhat misleading.  The appetizers are not in fact ""half off"" as some reviews have said, but instead are priced at $3, $5 or $7.  This is somewhat confusing because the menu does not actually list the price so you do have to ask.  Also, the happy hour on food ends at 6, while the happy hour on drinks goes until 7.  

The other issue is that they can't seem to get their story straight on 2 for 1 beers.  Some of the servers/bartenders tell you that if you order them they both get delivered at the same time, others offer to bring you them one at a time.  Some of the servers/bartenders think its a great idea to split your 2 for 1 with a friend, allowing you cheaper prices and the opportunity to try a variety of beers, others frown on this an seem to insist that you only order for yourself.

Once you get past the varied rules and learn the system its a pretty great place to be.",ZaXJ9AaYOqFUMkJ1ddpciQ,2,0,4,aYVaZfXZij0jBdJw3KqBrg

My first time here, and I was going to give it a four stars.  

I ordered the Chopped & Tossed Prime Ranch Steak Salad ""Pieces of chipotle marinated prime tender ranch steak tossed with roasted sweet corn, avocado, tomato, red onion and shaved fennel, served over field greens with our basil Romano vinaigrette, crispy fried sweet onions and Parmesan toast"" ($13.95) from their specials of the day menu.  Initially, our waiter told us that it was a lunch special but the chef would do it for us anyway since we came in the afternoon.  The salad looked great, huge and just totally worth it!  (I did notice the absence of the avocado though, which I pointed out later to the waiter so he knew.)  

The Big F now the Husband ordered the Kobe (Not Bryant) Burger ""An incredible burger from beer fed, hand massaged, and sake brushed beef...served on a sweet sourdough bun with Maui onions, aged white cheddar cheese, heirloom tomatoes, and leaf lettuce.  Served with a pickle."" ($13.99)  He was pretty impressed with his burger, a nice size and good flavor.  

We also ordered the Death Valley, Chips ""Homemade crispy waffle cut potato chips tossed in Yosemite Sam Steiner's spicy seasoning blend of Lawry's seasoning salt and paprika."" for $3.99.  A bit salty, but good nonetheless.

Service was spotty.  Our waiter disappeared for awhile and we wanted to pay.  We had to wave down another waiter who in turn looked for our waiter and you could tell our waiter 'disappeared' for a bit.  Did he go on break and not tell anyone?  

When I got home shortly after, I was on the toilet.  Yeah, dinner didn't agree with me.  It wasn't pretty.

2 stars...overall, 3 stars.

Went back again the past weekend and this time I ordered the Sea Breeze, Mediterranean Steiner's Pub Salad ""A mound of crisp romaine greens topped with a dressing of marinated cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, jicama, and green peppers mixed into a balsamic and herb vinaigrette.  Presented with crisp pita chips, kalamata olives, and a sprinkle of feta cheese.  Served with your choice of our succulent lamb chops or a tender grilled chicken breast.""  for $13.99.  I chose the lamb chops and three chops were resting on my salad.  Again, it was a hearty salad, and the chops were good (not as good at Blue Martini's though) and enough for the Husband to share.  

He needed to share because he made the mistake of ordering the
Wellington, Lamb Chops Appetizer ""Four chops marinated in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, then grilled to perfection.  Served with our signature horseradish dipping sauce."" for $11.99.  And it really was four chops with a dipping sauce.  It definitely wasn't going to be enough for him.  He did ask the waiter if it came as a entree option, but was told only as an app.  So, as a result the Husband was eating off my salad.  

Our friend ordered the Panaca, Corned Beef Reuben Sandwich ""100% lean and trimmed corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and your choice of stone ground mustard or 1000 island on grilled marble rye bread."" for $8.99.  It came with fries, potato salad, coleslaw or chips.  Since he didn't know what the Death Valley chips were, the waiter offered to bring him a sample so he could try it first. (I thought that was pretty nice of the waiter to do that.)  And as a result, he chose the Death Valley chips.

Service was a lot better this time!  Not only did our waiter check on us often, but the waitress who initially got us our drinks was following up on us as well.  There was no need to even worry about getting our beverages refilled since they were on top of it!  They are also in the Entertainment Book, which gives you a 15% discount every time you dine there after you use the coupon.

3.5 stars overall.

Not sure what kind of butter they use or if they cooked it on the same flat top stove where they cooked anther food before mine. It was weird. 

The mini pancakes from the breakfast special taste frozen and reheated. There is a peculiar flavor the preservatives give off when you re-heat them. I know, I was in the restaurant business for years and can tell frozen and canned from freshly made. 

Steiners has a great pub vibe. I love it here. Their lunch and dinners are great. Their service and bar are the best in town. They just fell short in the breakfast department in my opinion.",-pCIK2f47lHXiAw-uiD-aQ,1,0,1,QJCt59OT0s0v57DYHC1aXg

At first, I was  hesitant to come because my first experience was disappointing. This second time, it was better. We entered around 10pm and sat ourselves at one of the side booths. The wait staff were slow to acknowledge our presence, but after we made it clear we were there, they were more attentive. 

The menu is extensive and that can backfire. Like I said, my first experience had me never wanting to come back. I didn't care for their chili. I was impressed with the extensive salad choices. On Thursday, they have a  BBQ chicken served over cold soba noodles with tons of veggies tossed in. The marinade for the chicken remind me of the Chinese style BBQ except it was more salty than sweet. The half portion was 8.95 and was enough to tide me over. I was trying to be healthy, but could not help stealing my friends fries. They were thick cut and fried to a golden brown. Absolutely perfect.

My sister and I decided to go to lunch and after driving around, seeing nothing particularly eye catching, we ended up at Steiner's. 

Walking in, my sister said it smelled bad. It smelled kinda funky. It was also extremely dark in there, which makes me weary of sanitation. We seated ourselves and were handed menus. The menu is basically cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, chicken sandwiches and burgers, with a page of expensive salads and dinner and breakfast foods that we were either too early or too late to order. 

I settled on the French dip and fries for $8 and my sister got the BLT. We both got the beer battered fries, which were decent. My French dip was too bland and not good. The au jus tasted like it was filled with MSG. My sister said she liked her sandwich but said that it wasn't worth the price. 

We had to wait a long time for our server to ask us if we wanted to order so that was eh. Also, a waitress was carrying a huge trashcan/paint bucket/ice container(?) thing through the dining room on her way to the drink station attached to the bar. That was kinda bizarre because I've never seen a waitress carry supplies through a dining room at any other restaurant.

We decided to go into this one when we were on the blvd one night we usually go to another location.
We love the  Fajita Salads here.  You can get beef or chicken.
We always get the chicken.
It comes on top of some greens with some yummy carmelized onions and peppers, along with some jack and cheddar cheese. Mmmmm I can taste it now! Then they put pico de gallo on top. Served with poblano and sonoma jack cheese quesadilla wedges,
The dressing is guacamole or salsa ranch.
We always ask for both and extra because together it is DELICIOUS!!!
The salad is really amazing here, The combination of flavors are very good!!
There is a bar not far from where they seat people and it can get pretty loud.
The one thing we noticed is this location can get very busy I think we were there while they had happy hour or when sports maybe on because there was not many tables open and the bar was very busy.
Plus being so busy the servers are very busy so you don't get the service you would normally get. We sat for awhile before we had drink refills. 
Other than that we LOVE going for dinner you get a good size bowl of salad and there are many times you have to take it home as long as you did not put the dressing all over it.

So we had a going away dinner for a friend that was leaving Las Vegas, obviously, at another joint that served gourmet burgers.  Afterwards, the many party animals I was with wanted to turned the casual dinner into a more complete entertainment evening, and the bar that with just across the street turned out to be as fun as hanging out at a funeral with the other 2 people that showed up.  So after a quick search on the Yelp app, we all converged on Steiner's A Nevada Style Pub.

When I walked in the place looked pretty dead.  Luckily that was just the section of the establishment that was shutdown at that time of the night, which they offered to open up if we wanted to sit there.  Very accommodating.  Bonus points noted.  The section at the bar was lively with a good mix of people just hanging out and having what looks to be a rather fabulous good time.  Good sign.

After a quick looksee, we decided to sit at what looks like two long bar counter seating areas that were built right next to each other, complete with this railing this splitting the table into two halves.  Since we all knew each other, we avoided any potential awkward moments when two dudes accidentally made eye contacts with the fella across the table.  But the construction of this social table elevated the challenge difficulty of sharing plates of appetizers, which is probably what the bartenders are looking for when gauging which drunken patrons to cut off for the night. 

While most others opted for beers, whiskeys, and other adult libations, I studied their food menu under their burgers section, but made a last minute play change at the time of ordering to their Burger of the Month (I am a total sucker for these specials).  The burger was prepared a nice medium rare as requested, the toppings all came together nicely, and I was very satisfied with my ordering decision.  The nachos somebody order was good too.

Would I come back?  If you read what I wrote in the beginning, you already know the answer (otherwise, scroll back up buddy!)  Why?  Service was good, our waiter checked up on us regularly, even the cook from the kitchen came out to check if I liked the burger (nice!).  Food was good. The place was fun and not that far from where I work.  Plenty of TVs to watch whatever games or the Sochi Olympics while you have the option to chill the hell out.  Almost a no brainer.

The bartenders couldn't be more friendly and the happy hour specials are off the chain! BOGO beers from 4-7 and food specials from 4-6. This place is almost always busy, no matter what time of day. That should tell you something! 

Shout out to bartender Nicole, she's super rad!",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,2,0,5,SVVfaVJsB8hErMdNEphFdA

The variety of beer selection is astounding and not to mention the food menu. If it's just a few drinks maybe the pretzel or the chips and salsa. For a little more you have to go with the lamb chop appetizer or one of their awesome burgers. Go in once and you will become a regular!",Oa6qrobk_8hIyxMv3nZ7IA,1,0,5,5PMM9_JFL-0Ei7GYdVG6qA

I came here with my girls in need of a serious savory fix, after a long day of decorating cupcakes.

I ordered the beef dip and onion rings and it was yum. I'm a big fan of the onion rings here. The beef dip didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped, but the au jus more than made up for it. My friends were very happy with their meals as well. 

We didn't drink on this particular occasion, but after looking at their beer menu, they have good selection and I look forward to coming back and trying out some more of their food and drink options, especially the wings, soup and nachos... which looked great on other people's plates as I passed by on my way out.

Overall, very happy with this place.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,OhhpAKeaO7OYBAlkwkUsfQ
