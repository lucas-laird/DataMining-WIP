Im typing fhis review as im waiting for a piece of lemon for 10minutes now for my shrimp plate. Waiter is horrible she needs to invest in a note pad and stop trying to remember the orders trying to impress the customers. She would actually impress me more by getting my order right with all the extras i asked for.,Q7Pw8wN7fc_uUeH5H0jyJA,0,0,1,95XWUTIx-1f9vaggU3LtRA

Also the back of the drink menu says that if your waitress doesn't mention a ""perfect margarita"" to you, you get a free s'more alcoholic beverage.

Was waiting to order for 18 mins, tried to get our waiters attention every time he passed. Finally came to our table at 6:08 & my mother said we would like to order from the happy hour menu. Our waiter who was an older gentleman aged  50-60 turned to my mother and blatantly told her No. it was passed 6 o clock and if you don't like it you can speak to my manager. Are you kidding me!?? What terrible customer service!!! Not I'm sorry you're past the time even if we had been waiting there 18 mins! Than the manager came over basically calling me a liar that I haven't been there that long...I even showed him the time I texted my mother I was here and she was right around the corner at 5:45!! Disgusted!!! Manager told us no at first and than said maybe I can manually do it.. I've worked for this Applebee's before & I've been coming here for decades & to be treated like they could give a shit about their customers is beyond me... not to worry I will have no problem driving 20 mins out of my way to be treated with respect. It's not the fact of saving money for happy hour, like what's the big deal just pay full price?? It's the fact that we as your customers pay your bills. I notice when my server is  having a bad day but they still try & I give them the benefit of the doubt but to treat my mother and I like that is disgusting. Chao Applebee's on Nellie and Stewart!

Today I and my family took a walk and dad decided he wanted to stop and get a burger. When arriving in apple bees I was shocked to see what appeared to be two teens or younger girls laughing and giggling and gossiping other then attending to the door. After 5 mins I grew aggravated and asked the curly head one to get the manager. When I asked she replied by saying oh it will be a while he's to busy, and started laughing with the other girl again. At this point another lady sitting with a newborn had explained she had been waiting a half hour for a meal she placed an order for online and it said it had been done. 2 mins later the manger appears and i explain that I think it's very unprofessional to how the guest where not treated he apologized and began to seat us, when he first attempted to seat us at a booth it was a mass amount of food that has been pushed under the table I asked for another booth next to it. The two girls continued to gossip and I pointed it out to the manager. He then disappeared. The lady that had served our table was actually very pleasant and cheerful which is the only reason we even stayed to order. Through the course of us eating I saw the two girls continue to tail behind each other.

Unfortunately service was horrible for some reason and I'm sure we may of been the only party feeling this way . First for starters I feel a server should offer introduction on first in counter which did not happen with us or any other tables he sat afterward . Next our appetizer came out with our main meal which was awkward because I'm sure fried green beans don't take as long as a burger. Someone else brought out the food never seen our waiter until check time he literally walked past our table seven times asking all tables were they ok except ours not mention tables that were all seated after our arrival. So after being there looking at an empty plate for 20+ minutes he brings me a refill which he spills all over my napkin never brings napkins to replace . On top of that my refill on fries were not what was ordered originally .

When we left I noticed that their chalkboard had something removed but not by erasing but by writing over the lettering. I don't understand why not erase the info but oddly it was in the same state when I visited later in the week.  But really, it's no big deal.

I wonder how many people have been charged and didn't look. He took the 1.99 charge off and for the bad service he gave us $6 OFF. I have never been so insulted in my life and as a retention manager who deals with the worst if the worst type of person daily I know first hand this is not the way you treat your customers. This is truly sad and I have never in 30 years been made to feel this way after I spent $100 in an establishment!",imDiaw7PGpr3RY-NYQglLg,2,0,1,QDw4mjfbSlZNN14adHiKdA

We have a couple favorite servers who take good care of us and all the managers know us.  Food is ok, nothing to get excited about.  We like the limited happy hour menu with boneless wings, spinach dip & wonton tacos all half price from 3 - 6.  Also half price beers and long islands & margaritas.  We 3 shared the kicker turkey sandwich with siracha slaw.  Sandwich could have used more turkey as it was really a slaw sandwich and the bottom toasted piece of potato bread was soggy.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,3,nPZGLSdmOKxamOxS1dIyzQ

I never asked about about refills on milk. so I was confused on that one. Food was ok, it was good. I would come back here but not for milk refills.",p85Lq9SorEmHjhLZg3l0cw,1,0,3,YMIXC3yxTgcZYXIZtPCRIw

I paid through the machine,that they have on the table with my card. The next day I didnt use my card because I was sick. I checked my account only to find that my account had been hack for 209 for Rogaine that I dont even use. They had my pin which was only used through the machine on the table. Be careful paying with your card. If you can pay with cash.",5Sx6OBVlbbXNtt2aAn1HiA,0,0,1,YU5cXl9rMWW-vfFXWZ7dwA

A server should greet their guest within the first 30 seconds unless their busy than no longer than 60 seconds would be ideal. There are 3 people on the floor and no one came to our table for almost 7 mins. I'm not one to complain but when you have a restaurant that doesn't look busy, mind you there wasn't very much people here when we came in to eat dinner. Someone should come to the table and at least talk to their guest and apologize about the wait and the server will be right over. The food came out fairly quickly and the service wasn't that great. I just think the guest shouldn't be waiting that long when the restaurant isn't even busy.",qx2Qz_7EVtjHzSxbNNE-Wg,1,0,1,U9cRipuvWqE0x8mkavORYA
