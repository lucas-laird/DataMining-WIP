635964,2011-07-08,0,2ivGlp_mVzwFaPjatAERXg,"Honestly I really wanted to like this place. I think the retro building looks great from outside. Inside is another story. The both times I've been here everything feels dirty and greasy, which makes me wonder how clean their food prep area is. On top of that, the people always seem annoyed behind the counter. It's a bit of a hostile environment. They also have never really gotten my order right and really don't seem to care too much about it. 

The food in actuality, honestly, isn't that bad, but not worth putting up with all the other stuff. I've seen other people walk out since they weren't getting the time of day there....

I think this place with a new, better management could be a success. Especially since this place is 24hrs, which is a big plus for me.",LkcrdEk9-SOBbLXt0-Mvwg,0,0,2,TOhzaZrWp5BS1pk3Tq2DrA

I eat the bean and rice burrito and can say that it's good,  the salsa bar is nice with the little cups and I do recommend the red sauce.

2970798,2015-10-24,3,2ivGlp_mVzwFaPjatAERXg,"I love a sketchy 24-hour taco shop, which is why Tacos Mexico has my heart. 

After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, ""put burritos in me"", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, ""hood"" had to offer.

Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. 

The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,12,7,3,ANIA3j-PptYaZvfa8fwxag

No rice and beans, just the quesadilla and rolled tacos! I was so shocked by these prices considering the same items cost me less that $10 at any Roberto's or Don Tortaco! Not only is this place expensive, the cheese they use has a weird flavor to it that I did not enjoy. Fortunately, I was able to give my expensive meal to a, very appreciative homeless person, so it wasn't a total waste. The shop itself is pretty ghetto with a broken back door and just, overall dirtiness/run down on the inside. You would think with the prices they charge, they could fix the place up a bit!

3362440,2012-11-19,2,2ivGlp_mVzwFaPjatAERXg,"I am basing this review strictly on their ""CARNE ASADA BURRITO"". 

I've been frequenting this place for years. I've tried the other Tacos Mexico chains around town, but for some reason the one on the EASTCYDE tastes better to me. I'm probably just trippin.

Located on Maryland Parkway and Charleston blvd.  Grimy. You gotta love it. 

These folks are open 24/7. Late night grinds are great here, but use the buddy system.

Now back to said subject...

Oh their CARNE ASADA BURRITO... I remember when this beast was less than $5.00.  This burrito to me has stolen my heart. I've tried other burritos at other joints.  They were all very good, but I find myself comparing them to the Tacos Mexico CARNE ASADA BURRITO on Charleston and Maryland.  A perfect combination of beans, Spanish rice, onions, and asada. Always comes out solid and greaseless. I always opt for Chile for that extra kick, and then I dump their red hot sauce all over that thing. The girth of this burrito will make you blush!!!

Till this day, I will always support Tacos Mexico's carne asada burrito.

A few friends and I rode our bikes downtown for some drinks and we stopped here on the way home. We were actually trying to go to the Mexican food truck that is usually parked nearby, but it was pulling away as we rode up to it. So we rode our bikes back up to Tacos Mexico. Sure there were some weirdos lingering around this place, but nothing too crazy. 

Great place to grab some tacos or etc on your way home. We weren't the only ones grabbing food, there seem to be quite a few with the same idea. I got my usual carne asada tacos and they were really good. Soft corn tortillas are my favorite way to have tacos. I love that they are open 24 hrs. Staff is pretty friendly.

my poor friend, who was visiting from france, lol, tried the menudo--it was literally topped with a 1 inch layer of water and looked as tough as a bull's asscheek. the decor is diner-meets-out of business motel(equipped with deceiving signs about its rich historical legacy, blablabla).

5487649,2017-11-26,0,2ivGlp_mVzwFaPjatAERXg,"By far the worst Mexican food I've had, coupled with terrible customer service. I dined here on Saturday night at 1am... I guess technically Sunday at 1am. 

I had an inkling for mexican tonight, but I was a little impatient on waiting long lines at El Gordos, or Pepe's, so I decided to try this place out tonight. (I drove by it and there were zero lines.) in retrospect, I should have taken that as a big hint. 

I ordered a combo plate of carne asada tacos, with beans and rice, and a carne asada torta (to go)

The beans on the combo were ROTTEN. They were completely sour. (Plus they were served ice cold?  Why???) 

Wanting to bring this to the attention of the cashier (A very unhelpful girl with a hair out up in a ponytail) and to avoid other customers from getting food poisoning, I tell her that the beans are ROTTEN. She just looks at me and says, ""Ok""

I immediately realized that the torta I ordered to go has beans on it. I asked her if the beans that they put on my plate are from the same pot as the beans that came on my platter, and she affirms my suspicions. 

I asked her if I could have my torta remade because of the rotten beans, and she seemed a little bothered by my preposterous request. But they go ahead and make it anyways. 

Not once... at all... did I get an, ""I'm sorry"". She didn't even offer to replace my beans for more rice, nothing. She did absolutely NOTHING about this. No apology. No offer to replace them with something else. Not even a sarcastic, ""oops"". She was completely unhelpful and uncaring. I thought that she was at least gonna tell the cook, ""Hey the beans are bad, throw them away!""

 Nothing. 

She simply said, ""make him a new torta,  no beans"" Every customer after me was being served from that same pot.... disguuuuuuuusting. 

Needless to say, I'm not coming back, and I'm calling management in the morning. The reaction of the employee, the rotten food, and terrible service is gonna ensure me I don't come back to visit this place.",5x-oeGbDdUSogKeVPihrvw,0,0,1,EvGFaIDR51Kmx0R3MOZAGw
