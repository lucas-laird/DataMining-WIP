So I stumbled upon Benny's and I'm glad I did. It wasn't too busy and the menu is super simple, only one page with some standard bbq specials. I chose the half rack of ribs, only $9.99 with casino card. At that price I wasn't expecting much but the plate came out quickly and looked great. It included a nice coleslaw, beans, corn muffin, and a piece of corn on cob. These were some of the best ribs I've ever had. The sides were also excellent. I ate at Tony Roma's the night before and it was also good but three times the price. Very nice atmosphere and good service. Recommended.",9WQ2Abqdty17thGqRy44_g,0,0,5,IhA5Dh56CR83_QNKtHZhFw

The ribs are very good for the price. A full rack for under $15. The meat is fall off the bone. 

BBQ chicken is better a little earlier in the day as this hidden gem has pretty long hours. It tends to dry out a bit later on although it is still pretty tasty.

Cornbread is good. Beans are good.

1763507,2014-10-25,6,U73q64yVTVTKM0RgF8pIag,"I don't like giving a 1 star rating. I usually reserve that for a really horrible experience but in this case, this place earned a one star rating. I know that is harsh but this place straight up sucked. 

There were 8 of us and when you have a large group it's difficult to coordinate where to go to eat. Someone in the group suggested we check out the Binion and off we went. We stumbled across Benny's and decided to go in since it wasn't busy. 

There is no hostess stand so you walk in and find your own table to sit at, at least I think that's how it works. The middle aged waitress didn't acknowledge us while we were standing at the front. We walked around the small space seeing if there was a table for 8, there was not. There's only tables for 4. One couple was leaving and told us we could have their table to put together with the open table next to theirs. We did that. The waitress came over and did a quick wipe down with a dirty rag that left streaks and food behind. Eeww. I ended up wiping it down with the paper towels that were on the table.

The menu consists of 4 things. Full rack or half rack of ribs, 1/2 roasted chicken or 1/2 roasted chicken with 1/2 rack of ribs. Prices were really cheap. I'm thinking with only 4 things on the menu, the food has to be phenomenal. I was wrong. Mediocre. The ribs were a dry rub with sauce on the side. The sauce tasted like bottled sauce. My corn was the smallest out of the group about 2 inches long. The slaw was watery and the baked beans tasted like a pound of sugar was dumped in it. I didn't try the corn bread. My friend's chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was pink by the bone so she didn't eat it.

Service was slllloooooooowwwwww. My 86 grandma walks faster than she does. It took about 15 mins (and I'm being generous) for our waitress to come over and give us menus and even longer for her to come back and take our order. She left her bifocals on our table and when we were finally able to flag her down she mentioned she was looking all over for it because she couldn't put in our order since she couldn't see the computer screen. Great. We probably waited about an hour for our food. I really wanted to walk out but my friends said to give it a couple of more mins. Luckily we got our food after that. 

One thing I saw that really disturbed me was, I saw our waitress dumping water glasses full of ice into the water pitcher. I know what I saw. She had 3 of the red water glasses, the same one I was drinking out of and saw her dump all 3 one at a time into the water pitcher. I don't know if she was recycling customers drinking water or if she used the glasses as a vessel to carry ice. She then dropped ice on the counter and scooped it up off the counter with her bare hands and dumped it into the pitcher. I stopped drinking the water and told my friends not to drink it.

There was another waitress there, a younger one but she was more preoccupied with coming in and out of the restaurant. Can't tell you what she was doing but she wasn't working that's for sure. 

When our very frazzled and slow waitress finally brought our check, she actually gave us the wrong check. We had to flag her down and get the correct one. We spent another 15 mins waiting for her to come back with my friend's credit card. Actually she didn't come back so we went to her. My other friends went to go gamble while we dealt with her and my friend's now missing credit card. When she finally found it she hadn't processed it yet. While she was doing that she told us that the party before us forgot their credit card...uh..more like you forgot to give it back. 

Also there was a young couple smoking their vapor there which I thought was rude and disrespectful. I overheard our waitress tell the young man ""oh you go boy, just like smoking a hookah""...wow...just wow. We were there for more than 2 hours. Walk past this place and don't do it.

They should. It's nothing fancy, and your choices are limited to about 6 options. But what they do, they do well and serve fast. The beer list is not too extensive but quite varied and has something for everyone. There's plenty of TVs on the wall in front of which you can place yourself for whatever is the important sports match of the moment.  My rack of baby back ribs was quite large and fairly tender, and the one sauce they provide does enhance the flavor. People were equally satisfied with the chicken and brisket. It's a good thing there are rest rooms nearby, because you'll need to wash your hands frequently from all the saucy goodness, particularly from the ribs. If you're an easily satisfied BBQ lover, consider this place.

Downtown Vegas is the place to go for inexpensive but delicious dining.  And the casinos here have a better payout plus lower minimum bets.

We stumbled upon this gem purely by coincidence lol We parked in the Binion's Garage and just wanted to walk Fremont Street and play a bit and have dinner --but since every restaurant had a ridiculous wait...we ended up back @ Binion's. We were going to try the cafe or steakhouse, but the cafe had a long wait and the steakhouse was a bit pricy so we ended up @ Benny's. 

The wait was a little lengthy (I knew we should have just walked in here when we first arrived) but I must say it was worth it!!! We were seated and they have a really basic menu with pictures that do the food absolutely NO JUSTICE. I almost ordered 2 plates since the pictures were very basic & misleading but my cousin said to just wait and see if I was still hungry before ordering 2. With the menu being pretty limited (Ribs, Chicken, Brisket combos) I really think the prices were very reasonable and nothing was over $14. That was a major PLUS.

When they served the food, we were all actually pleasantly surprised at how huge the portions were...and DELICIOUS it was! All the sides were on hit (cornbread cupcake, chili & coleslaw)..one of my cousins even said the butter was yummy! lmao Oh & the BBQ sauce they have at the tables is super YUMM!!! I love my spicy BBQ sauce and they had a bottle of both Spicy & Mild...I smothered that all over my brisket which was just divine and tender -- just the way I like it! I also had a taste of my sister's ribs&chicken -- they were delicious as well! When my husband arrived a little later, we killed my brisket plate along w/ my sisters combo plate & he killed his brisket plate that I ordered when he got there lmao!!!

 Something new is smoking at Fremont Street. It ain't under the canopy. It is inside Binion's Gambling Hall. Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brews recently opened near the Binion's sports book.

With that said, I observed that it is a streamlined operation. The hours are limited from 4 to 11p.m. They only serve dinner from a streamlined menu. There are only four entrees. Entree one is the full rack of baby back ribs for $15.99. Entree two is the half rack of baby back ribs for $10.99. Entree three is the half chicken for $10.99. And Entree four is the half rack and half chicken for $13.99. The Binion's card discounts each entree by $2. The first thing we did was sign up for the Binion's card to take advantage of the $2 discount. All the entrees include baked beans, corn on the cob, a biscuit, and cole slaw. 

  Regardless that there are signs advertising the restaurant and a local paper featured a column on it, Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brew was sparsely populated with patrons. Setting eyes on a dimly lit restaurant that resembles an Irish pub more than a BBQ joint, we sat ourselves. Faster than a hand of Blackjack,  the friendly waitress greeted us. On account of the streamlined menu, deciding what to order was easy. I ordered the half rack of BBQ ribs and BBQ chicken and not a brew but a Coke. 

  I give Benny's Smokin BBQ & Brew 3.5 stars, the equivalent of a ""B+"" on a report card. The ribs and chicken were tasty without all the stickiness. I only used a moderate amount of the roll of papertowels on the table. The ribs were easy to cut. This was not one of those messy BBQ disasters. I was satisfied with the ribs and chicken. And speaking for my brother so was he. What could I say about BBQ beans and a biscuit? They taste the same every place I eat them. I felt the corn on the cob could of been warmer. Just like anyplace I've been to, the cole slaw was delicious. 
  Sometimes, it pays to be a guinea pig. Now I know that when I am at the Fremont Street Experience and  have a craving for BBQ food all I have to do is walk to the back of Binion's.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,9,6,3,pJaYpY1m7JFlkQYq3V2hvw

But the service....

1. Waitress was incredibly slow to take our initial drink orders. The drinks themselves came fast but refills? Forget about it. I was the designated driver, paying the bill and drinking only water and never got my glass refilled. 

2. No thank you at the end. Just a ""Have a good one guys"" as the check was placed on the counter.

I'd come back for the food but walk out if I had the same waitress.",oMRDMqk0wIni7bttUFBXuw,0,0,4,XM5Tq3VM2cuzSN5MCL3sPA

Thee service was great,  I can't remember or servers name.  I think it was Jenny.  She was really nice.   There menu is very simple.  Ribs and chicken!   Do you want all ribs or all chicken, or do you want half and half!   It comes with delicious coleslaw,  bbq beans that taste so good, corn on the cob and cornbread.   I usually don't want time spend my money on bbg, cause we do oir own.  But this was really good.  They also have a nice beer menu.    I would eat here again if I get hungry on freamont st.  My combo was $11.99.  And I brought all my chicken home.",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,5,1,5,Vk3vzV4cbIoYkFhyvLnW-w

For much less than $20 I had a fantastic meal and drink.  Spent twice this amount for dinner last night on the strip and the food wasn't as good.  

Highly recommend you stop in if you're in the area.",HIhPuKWV_r05-4w57nGFnQ,0,0,5,rMEsRj0jkIgv2K_HZt0sUQ

Additionally, I don't like the fact that their kitchen is not located inside the same area, so they actually have to walk from another area through the casino a little bit and then into the bar. The only good things are that the menu is uncomplicated and simple and the portion sizes are good. We took the leftovers home and fed them to our dogs.",QHqhVT0cAtKfxGEO3bmPeg,0,0,1,GUVy7Xh5yAA244T-UxaRaA

The food came cold but I just wanted to get the hell out so I held back. We were the only table sitting at the time which was 4 PM. Yes I stiffed the waitress. She spent her time talking at the bar. Service seems to be that way everywhere. Thank god I'm a good cook. Maybe that's why I'm complaining. Nobody knows how to cook.,axSAqEwXbrrEMvuwN5ymRg,0,0,1,mRCaqTTFCpQMOye8VXLf6Q

He didn't like the sauce on the meat, I didn't mind. He prefers the sauce on the side, but they don't offer it that way. The corn was awful, I didn't eat it. Cole slaw was plain, nothing to write home about. But, they waitress was very friendly, and they let us share a plate. I thought the price ($13 for a full rack of ribs with sides) was very fair. I liked it.",QHYmvzo_SWxvmCASkyBq7Q,0,0,4,Ff-aIMhHmBUWdBonEf5Htg

They also have a bunch of beers on tap.

Tonight I went in and ordered the full rack of baby back ribs 14 bones. It comes with delicious baked beans, coleslaw, corn on the cob and a cornbread muffin.

There are two sauces on the table to choose from...sweet or hot and spicy BBQ. I tried both and liked both of them.

The price is very affordable especially if you have a players card.

I'd be definitely coming back to get me BBQ on.",yu3vMi8XbG3w7iVWStdCTA,17,17,5,MmgaLz9nwDUloEEhE2cmLA

They don't even offer pulled pork.  I don't understand how a BBQ joint doesn't even have pulled pork.  I'm bewildered.,oe6ii9t_jSUjScnXOWMhmQ,0,0,2,lcu0TvQtV3Qe36xmYXP1BQ

I always get the 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 bbq chicken dinner for a low price if $13.99.  I believe it is only $11.99 if you are a club member.  This meal also comes with Cole slaw, beans, corn, and cornbread.  I always think I can eat it all, and the reality is I can't even come close. (!)

Good service, good prices, and good food. What more could you ask for?  There are still good deals in Vegas!",EGRcixxBNi92pqm_YIhIqw,0,0,4,D2HCQMxOwR9Cb6gC5gFD7w
