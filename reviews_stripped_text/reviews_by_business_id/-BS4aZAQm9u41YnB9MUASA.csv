The lamb loin was tender and the shrimps seasoned very well. Service was amazing thank you Amine.

When we arrived,  they had only been open about 45 minutes. We were seated right away and ordered the drink special. We decided to try two appetizers, the spreads and the lamb sausage appetizer.  The spreads are hummus, eggplant and an olive spread served with hot pita bread. All were delicious. For our entrees we shared the roasted lamb and the kefka tangine. 
Everything was so good and we were very happy with our entire meal. 
The only reason I did not give them five stars is they were slammed and were not prepared for the customers that came in after we did. The place was packed literally 15 minutes after we got there. I think they are experiencing major growing pains.

The brochette was like a shish kabob with pieces of chicken on two skewers.  The chicken was tender, perfectly cooked, juicy and had the most wonderful flavor from the marinade.  The brochette was served with rice and a stuffed tomato half which were both delicious.  The chicken tagine is like a stew of tender pieces of chicken with potatoes in a slightly spicy sauce.  Very tasty! The chef also sent out to our table a pastilla which is round baked phyllo pastry dough stuffed with chopped chicken, almonds and eggs and sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon.  It may sound like a strange combination of entree and dessert, but the sweet and savory flavors went together so well, we finished it all.  The atmosphere is lovely and even better was the belly dancing performance.  We had a great time and had some wonderful food at a very reasonable price.

895941,2014-05-25,0,-BS4aZAQm9u41YnB9MUASA,"We live in Las Vegas, and eat out a lot; a restaurant has to be really great for us to review it. But Argana knocked our socks off. 
 
The restaurant  has a beautiful interior: gold and red striped seats that look like pillow cushions, to make you think you're dining in a nomad's tent, and the light fixtures look like colorful glass lanterns (very pretty at night, when it's dark outside). And on Friday and Saturday nights they have a belly dancer, who encourages patrons to get up and dance with her.
 
My husband and I shared the following:
 
- a trio of mideastern salads (hummus, baba ghanoush and olive tapenade), with a generous basket of freshly made, pillowy soft pita, which the busboy kept refilling;
 
- an appetizer sized b'stilla (which they call ""pastilla""), which is ground chicken in a filo pastry shell, served  with an orange-and-greens salad;
 
- two beef skewers (they use FILET!), with a rice timbale, a couscous-stuffed tomato and a shredded white vegetable salad that was so good, it was our favorite thing there. (I swore it was shredded apple, but our waiter said it was white cabbage); and,
 
- boneless beef shortribs in a date and red wine reduction sauce, with tiny apricots and toasted almonds.
 
Let me stress, all the food we tried was SO GOOD. And all that, plus a glass of red wine for me, with tip, came to $70.00.
 
Everyone was so friendly. The waitstaff were incredibly attentive, the chef came by TWICE to talk to us, and the owner asked us how we liked our meal as we left.

We ordered a lot for two people, because we wanted to take food home with us. Ha! Our plates looked like locusts had swarmed through when we were finished. I guess we'll just have to go back soon ....",PhYPPprJkuXaJlcKqsFmVQ,0,0,5,McEm0xD7HN-ppO85pvyoSQ

Staff is friendly and helpful when ordering.  Everything on menu sounded great.  We got mixed dips for appetizer.  In house made pita bread was soft and warm.  Baba ganoush was light and a bit smokey flavor.  best i have tasted.  Pastilla is interesting - a filo pastry filled with ground almonds and chicken- sweet and savory and good.  Entrees of spicy shrimp (huge) and baked fish (with potatoes and peppers).  Both entrees were so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  I got the braised chard because of all the recommendations on yelp.  It is not to be missed.  It is actually a cold salad type of dish.  hard to explain but just take my word and order it.  William, or server, was so cheerful and brought us over some tea to try.  We will definitely be back to order more off the menu since we want to try all the items.  A great addition to the neighborhood.

Unfortunately, we only saw her for about five minutes of our visit, but she was incredibly talented. Her presence really added to the atmosphere.

HARIRA SOUP: made with tomato, lentil, and chickpeas, this had good seasoning. Hearty, comforting, great with the traditional bread.
KEFTA TAGINE: stew-like dish with Moroccan meatballs, tomatoes, and poached eggs. Unclear why a saucy dish was served with a fork, had to wait to request a spoon. Flavors were just okay: I enjoyed the sauce but the meatballs were a bit bland, and the eggs were overcooked. I believe the dish would have been significantly better if they were cooked properly. 
MECHOUI ROASTED LAMB: Very nice dish, really loved how the moist meat was complimented by the fresh mint leaves! The sea salt, cumin, and harissa sauce really added to the dish and allows you to customize the seasoning. The meat tasted more like beef than lamb though? Odd.
MINT TEA ALMOND PANNA COTTA: Doesn't initially appear to be a panna cotta but it is surprisingly successful. The flavors all somehow work together, despite my initially being turned-off by the grapefruit on top (not mentioned in the menu description). BF inhaled this dish, really loved it. I found it enjoyable but also very odd. The mint tones in the dish almost come off as a bit medicinal.

The food was fairly tasty but did not particularly wow me. Maybe my expectations were set too high but I expected to be a bit more satisfied for the $70 dinner. Perplexed about why the couscous is not offered as a side but instead is only available as an entree.

The braised beef was very tender, but a little too sweet for my taste since it was marinated with apricots, honey, and cinnamon. However the lamb dish was ok, it lacked flavor but the lamb was cooked well. Also do order the mint Moroccan tea.

Now, on to the main dishes... My husband ordered the chicken tagine.  The chicken was so tender and juicy and the sauce was so yummy. I ordered the chicken brochette,  which is basically a kabob.  Once again, the chicken was tender and juicy and the spices that it was cooked with gave it a great flavor. It also came with saffron rice, potatoes and an incredibly yummy tomato topped with parmesean cheese and spices. For dessert,  we ordered the panna cotta. It had a great citrus flavor and was very refreshing- the perfect ending to an amazing meal!
We also ordered a bottle of the Moroccan wine, which perfectly complimented the flavors of our meal. At $45/bottle,  it was totally worth it.

The Argana is located in The Lakeside Center on West Sahara, tucked back in a corner behind The Outback Restaurant. The plain exterior of the restaurant belies the beautifully designed and decorated interior. We were met at the door by our server, who promptly seated the six of us in a cozy but roomy corner.

The interior of the restaurant was immaculate and the Moroccan decor immediately imparted a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Realizing some of us had not tasted Moroccan food before, our server ( didn't get her name) explained the most popular dishes which helped us in our selection. We decided on appetizers and ordered up the calamari steak and a sampler named ""The Spreads"", consisting of pita bread, and several savory spreads like hummus. All absolutely delicious. 

My wife ordered the lamb chops which were accompanied by flavored cous-cous, seasoned potatoes, zucchini, and a small cabbage salad. I ordered a braised beef rib dish with a sweet, prune/plum sauce. The meals were served with very nice, small, round loaves of Moroccan bread that had just the slightest hint of anise flavor to it.

The meals were expertly prepared. The aromas and spices were exceptionally good and the flavors were a delightful new experience for us. We topped off the meal by trying and sharing each of the desserts. The almond filo roll, similar to bak-la-va but not sticky, a Moroccan mint tea panna cotta, and the cinnamon crème brûlée - all were fresh and delicious but the crème brûlée will put any Italian version completely to shame. Excellent. Period. We thoroughly enjoyed dining here. It was delicious and a definite do-over.

The food is out of this world, highly elevated Moroccan cuisine.  The chicken in the chicken tagine was the juiciest we've ever had.  The merguez (lamb sausage) is served with delicious harissa (Moroccan hot sauce - fantastic!), and the braised beef short ribs were so tender that we didn't need a fork.  We also tried the kale salad - delicious lemon flavor, very special.  The food is prepared with great care, and you can taste the love in every bite.  The pace of the meal is relaxed, so we were able to have a conversation and enjoy the entertainment, without feeling rushed. 

The belly dancer was very entertaining.  There was a different one each night we were there.  As part of her set, she asks individual guests if they would like to try to dance a little.  My wife and I gave it a go, and it was great fun.  Bring some dollar bills for the dancer.

A couple of times, we chose the chef's tasting, and got some delicacies that aren't even on the menu.  We also had the good fortune of speaking with Christopher Hajji, the chef.  He is a famous private chef, who has catered to many celebrities that come through Vegas.  He has a passion for cooking that shows in every plate that comes out of the kitchen.

3864120,2014-06-29,3,-BS4aZAQm9u41YnB9MUASA,"Authentic Moroccan food. This place is truly unique to Las Vegas as we do not have another Moroccan restaurant here, (Marrakech is faux Moroccan, sorry). This place is tucked away in a strip mall behind Outback, little difficult to find if you're not familiar with this center. 

We started out with a bottle of Moroccan wine, not on the menu, but just ask, it was really good, if you like Cabs, you will like this wine. 

Ameen, our waiter had suggested we start out with the Calamari Steak appetizer as well as the Pastilla. The presentation of both was so pretty, I didn't want to ruin it by eating it! The Calamari was so tender and soft, it melted in your mouth, the flavors of lemon and the chickpea relish really made this dish different from any other way I've had calamari. The Pastilla was almost like dessert, I love sweet and savory and this dish nailed it. Layers of filo dough around chicken and egg with almond, dusted with cinnamon. It was delicious.  

I love Tangine cooking, the meat is so tender and the flavors of the spices come bursting through the food. We tried two different dishes, Braised Short Rib and Mechoui Roasted Lamb. Both dishes were equally amazing, and very unique. The Short Ribs were so tender, the meat literally fell apart with a fork, the flavors were so evident, seasoned with cinnamon and honey, marcona almonds and dried apricots. This is served with Khobz, or Moroccan bread, to dip into the juices left in the Tangine.
The Lamb Tangine was so good, seasoned with Sharmoula, a spice similar to cumin, and served with Harrisa, which is a condiment, the brilliant color of orange would make you think it is made with carrots, but it gets to color from roasted red peppers and smoked paprika. This is also served with fresh mint, the combination of the flavors were great. 

We finished dinner with Mint Tea Almond Panna Cotta, very unique, not sweet at all and more of a citrus flavor.

On Fridays and Saturdays starting at 6:30 they have belly dancing, we caught a few songs, and she was really good! 

This place was truly amazing, I can't wait to return.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,16,12,5,8M4zGSGmPXiSlROleZRh1Q

It's a great addition to the area, and I hope to god it is successful as it seems to be the only Moroccan in the area that serves such high quality. I would argue better than a ton of restaurants on the strip, and much more affordable too!

The calamari steak is a must order item, and I also highly recommend any shrimp dish, the lamb sausage, the appetizer of mixed dips, the braised chard (not what it seems!), and the panna cotta. I would gladly reorder any item I've had there, with the exception of the mussels. The flavor was great, but for some odd reason they choose to use the frozen green lip mussels rather than fresh. 

My one concern, other than the place being hard to find and therefore not attracting a lot of drive-by traffic, is that I think the chef is temporary. He is apparently a big wig chef in Morocco (which if you ever meet him he will inform you of in typical chef fashion), and his friend owns the place. I hope the quality will be maintained when he leaves.

Currently I would place Argana as one of my favorite off Strip restaurants in Vegas, and would suggest it to even the most discriminating foodies.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,9,6,5,pTlXQDEBS76DR0GJpV5feA

4848136,2014-06-21,1,-BS4aZAQm9u41YnB9MUASA,"I'm in love! I've been desperately waiting for a good Moroccan restaurant to open in town that doesn't require me to order a six-course menu of mostly non-Moroccan dishes since my trip to Morocco in 2005, and it's finally here.

I started with my favorite dish, chicken pastilla, which included a citrusy salad on the side. It was perfectly delicious and so nice to be able to get it in Vegas without having to spend the day cooking it myself.

Our second appetizer was the spreads, and although I don't like spreads and hate olives, I was addicted to the olive tapenade.

I ordered the scampi appetizer as my main course, but what they served me didn't resemble scampi at all. I thought they gave me the shrimp tagine, but it didn't match that description either, so who knows what I got, but it was good. It was loaded with shrimp and large beans with plenty of sauce for dipping our Moroccan bread. The shrimp was the ideal size for the ultimate flavor. I probably should have verified that this was scampi, but I didn't really care.

My husband got the kefta tagine, and as with most foods he enjoys, I don't like this kind of dish, but I found myself stealing meatballs off his plate every time he turned away to check out the belly dancer.

We skipped dessert, and soda is served from a can, so I imagine there are no free refills. The place was not busy on a Friday night, but I really hope that changes. Restaurants in this location tend to not last long, so I'm crossing my fingers that there are others looking for REAL Moroccan food in Vegas that will keep Argana going. The atmosphere is cozy and full of Moroccan décor, the belly dancer is entertaining, and service is good.

We came here with a few friends on Friday night, and it wasn't very busy. We were seated immediately and the service was very prompt. We decided to order family style so we can all try different things. 

We shared -

Spreads - each of them were awesome. Especially the olive tapanade. It is served with fresh pita bread - probably the best pita bread I've ever had. 
Calamari Steak - This was my least favorite. I like fried calamari, but I've never had a steak. It was okay. It was very solid and it really doesn't have a flavor to it. The sauce with it was a good spicy - seemed to be wasabi sauce. 
Braised Short Ribs - this is a sweeter dish. The meat was very tender, flavorful and it had delicious apricots in it.
Mechoui Roasted Lamb - This was my favorite. The lamb is roasted for 4 hours and it just melts in your mouth because it's so tender. The flavoring was awesome. 
Spicy Shrimp - this was my next favorite. The sauce and spice...it was so good. And yes, pretty spicy. 
Kefta Tagine - These are meatballs that are very good in a cumin sauce with kind of poached eggs. 


The waiter recommended their Moroccan mojito type drink - so we all had that. He made them pretty strong and they were very good and refreshing. The only thing is, it is very sweet...so it makes for a nice little headache later if you drink too much as he warned. 

Overall, we loved this place and will be going back. There were a couple of waiters working and they were both very tentative and helpful. The food was awesome. Best I've had in town for Moroccan. The only thing I feel lacking is the atmosphere. It's nice, but I feel it needs to be darker and more red...I've been to a few different places and they're always very dark, red everywhere and the belly dancers are very much featured. Which, they do have a very good belly dancer, but it just seems like it's just lacking a tad in theme. 
But, that for me is not anything to steer you from this place.
