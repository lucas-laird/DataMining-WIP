I been there for several times, but every single time was a horrible experience. I went there with my friend, at that time, we are the only table there. We ordered a lot of food, and I try to talk with my friend. Unfortunately, all the staffs who work there are talking loudly, and then they start singing. Since they have karaoke in the dining room, there are four of them start singing in front of us. We couldn't even talk with each other. We try to get some help from then, but seems like nobody cares about us. My friends are from another state, and them had really bad experience in Vegas. Not willing to go there again.",1GB37QOsfwIbBfdxvue0hw,0,0,1,z3FRFRkhhjUzv5XP2qIG6Q

They not only offered Chinese BBQ and hot pot, but also karaoke. We ordered some Chinese BBQ, including beef, tendon, lamb, chicken, squid, duck neck, bum, rice cake and etc. Most of them were spicy, which were really good.

3851320,2017-04-01,0,yw9VoFdKeN0EAerh1VceVQ,"It takes a lot to upset me enough to leave a bad review, but this place definitely took me there! We get there and was taken to small room where they were setting up the sound system and karaoke machine. We waited fifteen minutes for them to TRY and figure out how to get it to work. After all attempts failed they took us to another room. The system was working in this room, but after singing one song, the microphone died! We had to go ask for new batteries. For someone as technologically savvy as myself their system is not user friendly at all and very limited with the selection. Then once you play a song there's a 50/50 chance they don't have the instrumental for it and you have to sing along with the original artist. Are you kidding me?! There's an option to turn the original artist off and when we did that the lyrics and music were TERRIBLY off! When you turned it back on it worked perfectly! They obviously have an issue with their system they need to fix! Overall my whole party had a terrible experience. To top it all off, when it was time to pay, they tried to charge us for the time they couldn't get the machinery to work. When I tried to explain that, the employee holding our debit card charged our card anyways. Needless to say, we don't be coming back. It was my brother's birthday and we went there to celebrate and my brother left very unhappy. We tried to make the best of it but they gave us very little yo be happy about. I strongly recommend Karaoke Q Studio over this place!",mj8ez9tIWZsgRPdLeG6Cwg,2,0,1,pz2rh8s0Zkg4V1uQUMGKAg

That item was literally a Hebrew National Hot Dog, cut and seasoned with cumin. That was disappointing. It was cooked well and the added seasoning is something I would not do at home, but the disappointment comes because I was expecting a sausage. Just call it a hotdog, guys, and I would have not ordered it. On a positive note, I suggest getting the ""Grill Wrapped Beef or Lamb."" This is the first time I enjoyed cooked celery!

The ambiance is casual, there was no wait, and the staff is super friendly and attentive. I came in a group of four and we got two hot pot bowls and a few skewers. The broth was delicious and there was more than enough food, even though at first glance the bowls seemed small. They also came by and refilled the bowls with hot water so there was always enough soup. For the money, this was a good dinner choice.

I'm a huge eater and thought the hot pot (lamb) wouldn't be enough but I actually couldn't finish it. A bowl of rice comes free too with the pot. The soup tasted great. Had some Asian herbs and stuff that I could definitely taste.  

As for skewers I personally love the grilled buns served with condensed milk, as well as some chicken gizzards. Don't let those organ name parts scare you off! Asian places are famous for these and it's cooked really well. I actually want some again now as I'm typing this review..",EeQMTre1P0i7hZQFUXUOHQ,1,0,5,VTBennyfhKLqO5ozwarnOw

5775097,2016-10-13,2,yw9VoFdKeN0EAerh1VceVQ,"I passed by this restaurant / bar / karaoke, when it was too late to be seated at sushi neko. I quickly realized that it was new so I was like, ""why not give this place a try."" Came in on a weekday night, wasn't really busy. I didn't wait that long to be seated either. 

Customer service (1/5) - they really lacked communication skills. First off, we had to ask two different employees if they served rice (it wasn't on the menu) the first employee said that they only had bacon fried rice. Then we asked the second employee and he said they do serve white rice?? Second, our server didn't know which food was what. Pretty much we didn't know what we were eating. Third, my boyfriend was waiting by the registers to be rung up, but they were just standing there looking at him. There was a bit of a language barrier or it probably was just communication skills? 

Food (2.5/5) - Price was ok ($5 or less for a skewer). But majority of the food had the same seasoning... so they all tasted almost the same. The seasoning was overpowering for some dishes. But my most favorite would have to be the grilled oysters! I never been to a restaurant that grilled their oysters! Grilled oysters are my favorite! They add a bit of garlic on top and it tasted heavenly!! (This was probably the only thing that didn't have that seasoning). 

Overall, it was an ok experience. I may come back for the grilled oyster & if they improve their communication skills. But they are a new restaurant, so I'm hoping it was only because they were new! Would love to come back if customer service and other things change.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,3,4,3,I3pUFPyRgRfdCpsGJbxYsg
