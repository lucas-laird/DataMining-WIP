14378,2015-06-27,0,Q-1JCkmzNBJk6jC7K_AUZA,The service was absolutely terrible. They have a three person to a hookah maximum and they make you buy another hookah it was seven of us and they made us buy another lamp just for one person they have a 15% automatic gratuity added to your experience the waitresses were rude and the owner was an a****** also I asked for a glass of water and they said I can only get water if I ordered an entree which is ridiculous. Also for parties of 8 or more than 20 percent gratuity they removed all of the alcoholic beverages from the land on so its just hookah in food the food is terrible it looks like TV dinners and it was completely dead the atmosphere was boring in there was nobody in the lounge. I can totally understand why no one was there because their prices are ridiculous is $16 per land and like I said a 15 percent gratuity automatically added to your bill it was seven of us and our bill was $58 however they do take 10% off your bill if you tag them on social media which I feel is false advertising anyway. I would not recommend this place to anyone and I would not be returning for business,KZ2yIbhqmfQbkPkUJTGggg,1,0,1,ydmhiaJoiUvjzpEMTxPEtg
80647,2014-07-08,0,Q-1JCkmzNBJk6jC7K_AUZA,"Went there a couple days ago to satisfy my hookah urges I usually go to local hookah lounges around Lasvegas and support the small business in our area I walked in and the room was mild dark with a couple people at random tables and I was greeted after the employee was done talking to his friends , which was not cool. 

I asked for anything he suggests because I'm not a picky smoker. 

When I received my hookah it had about 6-7 small coals on it and was told that's all he has lit at the moment , I smoked it for 10 mins and it seemed not to be lit all the way I asked for new coals nd then I was brought out a new batch which was just put on my bowl still on fire . Burnt my bowl nd I told the staff about it nothing was done they left me with the bowl that was burnt 

In my experience with Hookah-lounges is a lot of people approach me if there's a complaint they  fix it right away with this one it seemed as if they didn't want to fix it

The owner then came in an employee told me that that was the owner and if I had any questions just ask I approached  the owner and asked him politely if I can get a bowl change and he told me yeah it's half-price right now if you checking yelp I told him my situation and still did not fix it nor give me a new bowl  all I really wanted was to smoke some hookah and do work on my laptop
And this whole situation ended  becoming a hour-long inconvenience",Nym1l6I0gMFrr9WCAcMO0w,1,0,1,S31PTQruVhbSd526gl30PA

Recently visited this establishment and the customer service is far from being superior, not even average. It was VERY dissatisfying. 
The server seemed like she didn't know what she was doing and had no personality whatsoever. Where do they get these girls from? 
Anytime I would try to get their attention, seems like they are on their own little worlds or too busy just ""hanging out"". Really not a good look for the business but I guess whoever owns this place doesn't seem to care about what goes on. 
Another thing I noticed is the subpar bar.The drinks they have are watered down and overpriced, you might as well ask for a non-alcohol drink.
I must admit the hookah is great, but that's about the only good thing I can say about Hookah Masters.
The place is pretty big but it feels like a freezer in there.
I feel bad for those girls working there who have to walk around with close to nothing on, which by the way I think it's tacky. You've got these girls walking around with their asses hanging out, wearing fishnets. Kinda whore house-esque.
Another thing I'd like to point is, there is the DJs are average. There's really nothing special about whoever is behind that booth, pretty much supply the background music because no one gets up on the dance floor. Boring.

Overall I would not recommend this lounge to anyone. 
The two stars are for the great quality of hookah.",ie5rMjg11S19lqX1FZu5Vw,3,0,2,DQ0HDTmsR-9m7LdtPL3Odg

We visited this place on a Sunday night and ordered pizza first and I must say that it was unpleasant... It was not good at all, had no flavor. We didn't eat half way when the hookah we ordered arrived (pineapple flavor). The hookah was great but after some hits I unfortunately threw up right where we sat. I didn't make it to the restroom sadly and I threw up all the pizza right by my side. I recommend this place but surely don't recommend the pizza at all.

So three of us came to smoke hookah and two of us just to hang out and eat. 

First we walk in and not a single person greets us. We sat there for ten minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. 

We were told we had to pay for bottled water unless we ordered food. Then were were told we had to order two hookahs even though only three is us were smoking. Then we were told that we had to order food or an extra hookah or leave. Then she didn't even bring all of our drinks. Then she took our food order one trip at a time. Then she wouldn't tell us what flavors were in the ""special"" hookah mixtures. Then she was openly rude to us and talked to us like we were 5 years old when she brought out the hookah, telling us not to knock it over.

A little too pricy for me personally since most places are $35 AYCS for 3 people.
The hookah girl is pretty, but she's not very attentive (we had to ash the coals ourselves for the majority of the time) it seems like a family owned place though so there's that
At first an obscure movie was on, and after ESPN, so that was cool! I heard that this place was supposed to have music, but unfortunately not on my visit :(
The lighting is nice and the lounge is big so we didn't have too sit TOO close to anyone so that was nice :)
They only let you change the shisha after an hour so we had to keep smoking even when it started to get harsh (we could have waited it out but waiting 20min+ for a new flavor just seemed too much of a waste)
Overall it's a nice place to go to if you don't want to be bothered (starbuzz is great if you like attentive staff!) the staff here is really chill but they don't really smile or come by at all really, you kind of have to flag them down
The food was good! Burger was on in-and-out level (which is decent) but the fries were just amazing (as amazing as plain fries can be!)

1588344,2014-08-02,4,Q-1JCkmzNBJk6jC7K_AUZA,"Underwhelmed by my daytime visit for food- the location is lit like a nightclub 24/7, even at 11AM on a Sunday when all I wanted was to satisfy a killer wing craving.

As it is, they seem to have a group of regulars sitting at tables and watching Law & Order with their laptops and a hookah, seems like a chill place to hang out and get work done. Wifi is free, which helps. There's hookah smoking here but no cigarette smoking allowed, which I appreciate because I can't stand that smell.

Lady we placed order with was friendly, her mom was the cook, order took about ten to fifteen minutes to come out, which was fairly reasonable. Had time to sit and look around, liked the lighting effects and modern décor/seating, but found it odd that they don't have more lights on during the day or anything to make it a little more restaurant-like for non-nightclub hours.

Food itself was just okay: 12 piece spicy garlic wings just tasted like mild buffalo sauce and no garlic, for 12 wings we were given 2 tiny cups of ranch which would not have been sufficient if they were the spice temperature we actually ordered. The beef shish kabob wrap was dry and had no sauce, side of Caesar salad was bagged at an angle so the dressing dripped out of the box and all over the bag.

EDIT: Subtracted an additional star after a traffic incident with an employee in a company truck covered in HML contact info and logos. He was speeding, tailgating, and nearly sideswiped my car in 5 o'clock traffic about a block away from the lounge. Dangerous on it's own, unprofessional when representing your company.

Also the price is good for the hookah, and fries are bomb but they charge gratuity for every transaction and in my opinion it was not worth a tip. One time the waitress did not even service us for almost 45 minutes. And the hookah got burnt and we wanted to order drinks.

I am from Los Angeles and I came here with good expectations since the lounge I go to in LA recommended me to go here. When I first came in, I decided to order a pineapple bowl since I thought it was going be my last bowl of 2014. I was literally getting no cloud from this pineapple bowl. They didn't fix it and instead, the owner Sargis tells me that fruit bowls are not about thick clouds and smoke. At first, I just told myself that if that's the case of the fruit bowl, then I guess fruit bowls suck and I'm never going to get it again. But during few days after I came back from Vegas, I decided to get pineapple bowl from other lounges and my god, I get really fruity nice thick smooth clouds and smoke out of it while lasting over 2-3 hours. I came to realize that Hookah Masters are nowhere near being masters of packing bowls.  I was heavily disappointed with this lounge.

Although I shouldn't have done this, I decided to get a regular refill because I didn't enjoy the pineapple head that they served while I craved to smoke because I literally got no smoke out of pineapple and it didn't feel like I smoked anything. So I decided to get Fumari Spiced Chai and Fumari Lemon Mint. Bowl burnt out after 20 minutes, and flavors tasted weird and burnt out. I've smoked in my house and also in other lounges, so I am very aware of what it's supposed to taste like.

They use low quality Exotica 8.1 charcoals. Ashes stick to the coals like a magnet, so they're hard to ash off. Since ashes cover the coals by sticking to the coals, it decreases the heat output, hence, not heating the shisha effectively to give good thick clouds. Only way to take ashes out of the coals is to use the tongs and carve it out using edges of coal plate. You can't even blow them out. Terrible charcoals. They use crap quality Egyptian hookah Caravans. KM is superior to Caravans and after smoking at top quality lounges in LA where they use KM hookahs, Caravans do not compare. Dream hose is the only thing great about this lounge. I have a dream hose and dream hose gives good clouds since it retains the smoke and has no leak throughout the hose but yet, for me to get no clouds while using dream hose, it's clearly their lack of skills in packing hookah while using low quality hookah parts and coals.

Yelpers, beware. If you plan to redeem your check-in discount, you will be required to write a 5-star review for this lounge in order to claim your discount. LMFAO. What a joke. Every 5-star reviews I've written for the lounges I enjoyed never required me or even told me to write a review for them. I've done it on my own will because their places and lounges were awesome that they deserve to be known by others of what kind of experience I had with the lounges. Why not advertise on yelp site like this then ""Check-in and write a 5-star review for 50% off on regular refill""? If you are not satisfied with people wanting to check-in and redeem the discount, don't offer it at all.",L_lg0UMaMz2RFtB_pW4YLw,5,1,1,2JK_O4rpR-HdtFJyCwgOlQ

My fiance actually ended up throwing up in their bathroom from the hookah. We didn't feel welcome here from the lack of sincerity from the employees.

 The owner messaged me on Yelp mentioning a change in staff. That's great and I hope you do better with new faces and management. I appreciate you reaching out 1 year later, but I'm leaving my review since it was an actual experience I had. 

--------  original review ---------

The music was so loud I couldn't chat with my friends. The prices are too high for below average bowls. I got a head ache and sick from smoking it. Staff isn't friendly at all. I didn't feel welcome there either. I would never come back here again.",9cGVREDE62j47aSVlxHhjw,5,0,1,G49aIBBAbzOy91d3EDqylQ

It's a nice-looking place, but more loungy than restauranty. We had the chicken kabob with rice and salad. It was good, but not outstanding as the chicken was a little dry. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and there were only a few customers, mostly smoking hookah and working on their laptops. I always thought hookah smoking was a social activity, but all these folks were there alone and spread out throughout the room. There wasn't any music. It was very quiet except for the sound of a cop show on the TVs and.....coughing. Hopefully it's more lively later in the evening, but the food just isn't amazing enough to draw us back.",BbS3gs_iRr1JAXIbVmAWFw,1,0,3,Msjw-o8dtuTEdQa8044kvg

I felt bad only one guy was working and running around like crazy not really his fault. Hookah was not that good the coals got ashy really fast and the bowl got harsh even faster after only about 30 minutes. I didn't try any of the food just the hookah. Don't plan on going back for the money I rather go back to other hookah lounges in the valley that were the same price or cheaper. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

The staff was friendly which is always a plus. The waitress replaced our hose once just to make sure the flavor was fresh. My friends loved the hookah here. I don't smoke hookah so I went to the bar. The limit on credit cards is $10 which is understandable. The bar tender was friendly and nice but the bar top was so high and I'm a short girl. The bartender was nice and friendly.

A few of my friends wanted glasses of water and they were told they couldn't have a any if they weren't ordering food (even though 3 out of the 5 ordered food). Also, we had to purchase two hookahs for 5 people because they have a 3 person max on each hookah. We are from out of town and were 5 of the probably 8 people there so it kind sucked that they couldn't bend the rules enough to give them water and allow my two friends to sample our hookah since it was a new experience for them that they weren't sure if they would like or not. We end up purchasing two hookahs. One of the people that I was with was asked to take her hood off her head even though we had been sitting at the table for about 35 minutes. The woman that waited on us was extremely nice though. It seemed like EVERYTIME she came back out to us there was new rules that she had to explain to us. It seemed like she was getting coached from the manager. We all received our foods about a hour later. I was the only one who enjoyed my food. One of my friends was served rice and a piece of old salmon. She told the waitress that she didn't want it and we had no time to wait for another dish. He refused to take it off of the bill. We were treated like crap by the manager and we were the only people in there that weren't there just for the wifi.

The owner is pretty awesome and knows his shit. They only use the best hookahs(KM) and flavors. No over price marked up BS like rumbar($35 for a standard hookah and ONE coal!) just because it's Vegas.  This is a real hookah bar for people that love hookah.  

We went on a Sunday night so it was quiet which was what we were looking for.  This place definitely has the club vibe. So if you're not into that come on a slow night. 

If I had any constructive criticism for the owner....  I would say do the club vibe on a few nights a week and on the other nights,  turn off the smoke machine and strobes and just let it be more of a relaxed vibe, and more of a lounge.

4849147,2013-12-10,2,Q-1JCkmzNBJk6jC7K_AUZA,"Scantly Clad Waitress, Decent Hookah, and Great Menu 

Everywhere my hubby and I travel we always try a new hookah bar (we met at one). So why would Las Vegas be any different?

We were initially going to go to Luna Lounge on the strip (Thanksgiving night and they were closed) so we ended up at Hookah Masters Lounge (HML) which was a pleasant surprise.

Hookah and Server: I will say I was a little hesitant when we walked in an the server was prancing around in underwear but she was wonderful! Super friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable. My fiance is Arab and of course only smokes double-apple(no matter where we go) so of course this was different, but to our pleasant surprise they had Nakhala - which is what many traditional smokers use. The hookah wasn't ours (of course we think we have best at home) but it was good - the server was efficient at keeping hot coals on the hookah and consistently checking on us and each of the patrons...maybe her efficiency came from a lack of pants? Meh - she was was awesome. 

Atmosphere: and setup in a way that could accommodate several large groups of people. Being over the age of 18 we still decided to sit on that side of the establishment as it was more populated.  

Food: Although we didn't actually eat there we did receive a menu to look over and by reviewing it they have a great selection ranging from appetizers, sandwiches, and entrees. Hummus, Hummus w/Sherwma, Mozzarella Sticks (can't go wrong with fried cheese), Sherwma Sandwhichs (Beef and Chicken), and even platters Beef Kabob, Chicken Kabob, and Kafta Kabob... Just to name a few.",mdnodIJO-BnK_15yFCJDcg,3,2,4,MRwfjn6ftxoY4UrMKs-6JA

5053744,2012-10-08,8,Q-1JCkmzNBJk6jC7K_AUZA,"So i came to this hookah lounge about 2 months ago on a trip with my girlfriend to vegas. Her friends decided to take us out to this hookah lounge that night but my god was it horrible. For starters before even entering the hookah lounge you are completely taken back by the horrible odor surrounding the location. Thanks to the lounge being built on top of a sewage line all you can smell on the way in, is all of Las Vega's combined bathroom trips. As soon as you get past the horrible smell and make it through the doors you should be fine considering most of the smell is masked by hookah flavors. The lounge is incredibly huge, however, the space between the tables and walls make you feel like you're smoking hookah in an airplane hangar. I don't know about you guys but that just makes me feel awkward. The service is horribly slow, the manager relies on the staff of all women prancing around in their underwear to cover up the fact that no one working there cares about you as a customer. The owner/DJ takes it upon himself to put the music up to a point where the person 2 inches away from you can't hear you scream. Lets not forget the prices, they conveniently forget to mention the fact that there is not only a one drink minimum per person but also a seating charge. Instead they leave that bit of information hidden in the menu for you to find your self. 
Now lets move on to the most important part of a hookah lounge, its hookah. The hookah was simply average, not exactly the level of someone who calls them selves a ""hookah master"". 
1) Packed above the rim - you should never do this, it burns the flavor out too quick
2) Too much water in the base - Makes the hookah produce less smoke all the while still burning your flavor, which leaves you unsatisfied and cheated.
3) Flavor burned too quickly - Within 15 mins of smoking the flavor burned out which isn't normal at all, I can pack a hookah at home while half-ass-ing it while 4 people smoke it, and it'll last at the very least 30 mins.

Overall my experience at Hookah Master's Lounge was pretty bad as you can tell. If you still want to test your luck then try it out, you might catch them on a better day then I did. They should consider taking the master out of their title, they really don't deserve it.",oMgaDByBGGJX7-ciJDp6JQ,19,2,1,jvXio_qG4Fa4zgSeYPmmag

My friend and I ordered a apple bowl with blue mist.  After waiting for 35 minutes, we received a hookah with a normal bowl (not the apple bowl we ordered).  After telling Rochelle that she got our order wrong, she just said, ""I guess that's what i heard ,"" and walked away without even trying to correct the ""so heard wrong"" order or even saying sorry.  We were so mad and we wanted to leave, but we decided to at least pay for the water that we ordered.  After paying $5 for 2 bottles of water, SHE LITERALLY THREW OUR CHANGE ONTO THE FLOOR and was yelling at us.

I'll start with one of the most important aspects of a business, the customer service, which was basically non-existent, minutes after we recieved our hookahs, the tobacco in one started to get burnt, we all smoke our fair share of hookah so we know what we were talking about, so we started to complain about it, so the employee tried a couple troubleshoots, but was not able to get rid of the burnt flavor, then a female from another table approached ours who claimed to work there, and basically argued with us and was extremely rude. We stopped smoking that hookah and when we went to pay they still charged us for it without doing anything to try to accomadate us. Besides the ""customer service"" the music they played was not the right type for a lounge and brought our mood down.
