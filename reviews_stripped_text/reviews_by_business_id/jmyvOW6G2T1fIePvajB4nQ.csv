I liked that it was quiet and they had tvs so I could watch the baseball game. But the one closest to me was super dim. The waitress apologized about it so that was cool. Honestly the best thing that I ate there was the chips and salsa. I probably would go back but it was a little over priced in my opinion.,SKwmLJr-T1imNAzOPu_FIg,0,0,3,nzamnsXttTSQa2fnx7MYzQ

We were attended to and food served just in time. The staff have Spanish/Cuban accent, dressed simply but appropriately. Food was superb, even better than a Cuban place we went to in Manhattan.

The food was bursting with delicious flavors. It was actually quite unbelievable how good the food was in this restaurant.  I wish we had a Cuban restaurant this great near our home.

We were able to use an Entertainment Book coupon and get one meal free, SCORE!  For as many times as I have eaten here without a coupon, it felt very well deserved.  

I seem to always gravitate to the Pan Con Bistec - a steak sandwich on cuban bread with shoestring potato chips on the sandwich!   I ordered a side of black beans, why not??  Where else would you get the best black beans but in a Cuban restaurant!  

They serve complimentary hot cuban bread that is delish!

I visited their soon to be new location and purchased a few pieces of restaurant equipment.  A young Mexican couple, *name redacted*, were working for the owner of Cuba Cafe and the Landlord, and Owners of Sergio's Italian Restaurant, Across the street, Mr. Napoli and his Daughter.  The restaurant was absolutely filthy.  There were roaches and grease everywhere.  The couple were on their hands and knees cleaning and scraping, with grease and rotten food covering their bodies and faces.  
         They told me that they are homeless and that they have lived and will live in the restaurant, until they finish cleaning it up and repainting it.  They explained to me that Cuba Cafe had not paid them for any of the work.  After complaining to the Landlord they were told, by the Landlord, in my presence, that he would pay them with the old broken greasy equipment that they were able to clean up, regardless of what Cuba Cafe does.  Basically, they can keep the equipment fix it and sell it.  I decided that I would help them move and clean up the equipment, outside of the restaurant.  I was well aware that they could not sell the equipment, in this condition, and that it would take a few months to be sold.  
          We rented a large u - haul truck.  We were in the processes of moving the equipment onto the truck when the owner of Cuba Cafe, *name redacted*, brought over the Landlord and told the couple that he made a new deal with the Landlord for some of the equipment, *the desirable pieces that worked*, and that they were evicted immediately, for continuing to complain about getting paid, that if they don't leave the property the police will be called.  

          They were not paid, and were once again homeless.  I let them borrow the u haul until they could find a place to store the few pieces of damaged nasty equipment that they were allowed to keep.  After 2 days, they could not find a place to store the equipment and were living in the u haul.  I ended up storing the equipment for them for a year.  They were given a key to the storage unit.  They never came back and I don't know what happened to the married couple.  I have not spoken with them since.  

          You can't hire people, without pay!  That is slavery.  I don't care if they were drug addicts, criminals, or etc.  I'm sitting here tearing up thinking about what they did to these good people.  If you have money, pay the poor what they deserve.  These people did a very good job cleaning up his restaurant.  If you've been there, just remember who cleaned it up.  They did an amazing job.

This is not a fancy restaurant, and somehow that inspires confidence as soon as you walk in. Every table gets a basket of grilled bread with butter - simple and delicious. The platanos maduros (sweet fried bananas aka plantains) were flavorful and not too oily. The lechon asado (marinated pork leg) is on the menu cover for good reason. It is famazing. The pork was very tender and succulent. That said, I can not recommend the sandwich cubano. I don't know if it's because I can't appreciate it or I've simply had better (Paseo in Seattle), but it was quite plain. I was expecting more punch especially when compared to the lechon asado.

At 2:30 on a Saturday, we were the only customers in the place, and while I know that's a slow time, it seems like we should therefore have had BETTER service, not worse! It took a while to order, and after we did, we had to chase down the servers several times to get refills on our drinks.

While the service was poor, the food was pretty good. Three of my friends had Cuban sandwiches, and--surprisingly--it was the first time for two of them! All three loved them, and I'm glad they now know the power of the Cuban! A fourth friend had the chicken sandwich, which was nothing special; and my husband had the daily deal: pork bruschetta, which was a skewer of tasty marinated pork with peppers and onions. Yum!

I got the tasting plate, which at $16.95 was one of the more expensive items on the menu, but it had an abundance of traditional favorites: ropa vieja (beef), puerco asado (pork), and pollo Grand Marnier (chicken) with rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a nicely dressed lettuce salad. Loved the beef and sides, but the pork and chicken were a bit overdone. I also had a mojito, which was heavy on the mint--but also heavy on the booze!

There was a special that we later were told was most nights the same. It was a small filet, rice and beans, and the steak was in a pepper sherry sauce. My two friends both got this.
I got the Lechon Asado (pork) with yellow rice. It was to come with beans and rice but they let me substitute the yellow rice. Also served to the table was a kind of warm, puffy bread. Crisp on the outside, and soft and wonderful inside. My pork was tremendous. Couldn't ask for more. I'd recommend NOT getting a side salad (extra cost). We didn't and I'm glad as I was full afterwards.
I did try my friends steaks. Wow! Melt in your mouth nice! I highly recommend both meals. I'm not sure how cuban the steak is, but it was superb.

We had the sandwich Cubano, Media-Noche sandwich, an order of tostones, an order of moro rice, and the fried pork tapa which I requested with rice.   
My dining companions had the sandwiches and while the sandwiches were good, they were not stellar.  Have had better sandwiches.  The moros rice was good, but an average good.  Tostones were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Very nice.  The garlic sauce that came with the tostones was not good. It was just the commercial store purchased chopped garlic which doesn't taste the same as fresh garlic. Not a smart way to cut costs. The tapas came with two small pieces of pork and the rice and beans. The two pieces of pork were enough for me but it was not as tasty as I expected it to be. This dish at $8.99 is a bit pricey.  I found the pricing in general to be a little high for the area and the ingredients of the dish.  Let's face it rice, beans and pork are relatively inexpensive.

I was warned not to go for the Cuban sandwich though, because that's pretty standard anywhere- come here for more adventurous dishes.

The sampler plate is a good option, with four different meats to figure out which you like. The spicy stewed pork dish was my favorite, but the shredded beef was good too. A thick sliced pork was on the dry side. And I've never really been into maduros. Solid intro option.
But really keep an eye on the specials- came in and found Pork Bruschetta one day and it was flipping fantastic. Two skewers of grilled pork with veggies, like a cuban take on kabobs, over a flavorful rice with a tomato-based sauce. Everything was full of flavor and the meat had a great smokey taste to it. Bonus points for siding this with a light salad with crunchy cabbage and a slightly sweet dressing, which really complemented the heavier main dish. Wish this was on the regular menu!

Cuba Cafe is a great leisurely lunch option. An evening visit will treat you to live music and dancing, but I prefer to converse. Full bar available.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,18,4,fGyTQwm0BTiinksUDNlzng

The buttered toasty bread brought to the table to start is also quite good.

They serve it with garlic sauce drizzled in olive oil and another specialty sauce, The items on the plate were just getting better tasting than the other after each bite.For our Entree The ""Lechon Asado""(Shredded Pork) was wonderful. I personally ordered the ""Ropa Vieja"" (Old Rope shredded beef) which is one of my favorite cuban dishes cause it has a similarity to the American ""Beef Stew""or ""Mechado""  from the Philippines. When it was served to me It didn't have the overflowing sauce that I had expected. But to my amazement as soon as I took a bite of the beef with the ""Moros""(rice&beans) It was euphoric.

2703425,2016-10-14,11,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"Let me add something here.  Cuba Cafe' has some seriously good Cuban food.  There has been some migration of Cubans and Cuban-Americans from Florida, providing more choices in Cuban food to this growing metro area, and that's a good thing.

While I may stick to ropa vieja, my friend went with the vaca frita.  Translated, ""vaca frita"" means ""fried cow.""  That's not appealing, but then ""ropa vieja"" means ""old clothes.""  I got to sample a forkful or two of that vaca frita and I would make it my first choice for lunch or dinner going forward.

The service by the main waiter/server was quick, spirited, and on point.  There was some sharing of duties with someone who performed a host type function and took orders for drinks and any appetizers.  We did order some croquetas.  They never arrived.  While I often use the expression ""on intravenous demerol"" for people who appear to be checked out, I'd say this individual, despite being very nice, had some ""deer in the headlights"" stuff going on instead.  This turned out to be a fortuitous event.  Between the main platter and some flan, we didn't have any room for those croquetas, despite how good they generally are.

My friend told me that another excursion to Cuba Cafe' was undertaken solo the following week.  It was for the purpose of eating some of that vaca frita again.  I think I might dream of that vaca frita tonight.",_K9sKlA4fVkWI4hyGSpoPA,20,20,4,WgZ1CIgCBM_qFYdw_kRkhw

We ordered pineapple mojito, coconut mojito (had no coconut flavor), we had the sampler for an app. So good a little of everything. Not big. Not enough to split with more than 2 people.

2865920,2016-10-31,5,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"Best Cubano sandwich, ever.

In fact, one of the best sandwiches of any variety, ever.   A sandwich I will never forget.  Like I won't want to eat one from anywhere else because any other one will suck in comparison.  That good.

It was a substantial sandwich: plenty big enough to share.  In hindsight, however,  I wish I would've ordered one all to myself.  Not that I could've finished the whole thing in one sitting.  I just would've loved to have whipped out the second half for a late night room snack.  

The key ingredient that made this sandwich so special was the roast pork.  It was simply the most perfect roast pork you could possibly imagine (and I'm giving you credit for an excellent imagination).  The sandwich was pressed, as Cubanos always are, and it was impossible to understand how much meat was packed inside just by looking at it.  But once you started eating it, it became clear that there was a hell of a lot of meat in there.  The sandwich was quite filling.

We started with an order of croquettes.  My wife thought they were just OK.  I thought they were really very good.

The other highlight of the meal was the house made Lemonade.  I have never had any lemonade like this.  It tasted exactly like the lemon dream pie my mom makes.  I have no idea how they make that lemonade, but definitely one of the most unique and one of the tastiest I've ever tried.

We also ordered a tastting plater, the empanadas were very good but that was about it and the waitress offered my husband some chimichurri sauce to go with the fried plantains and we finished the platter and the sauce was nowhere to be found. Then our food came and it was alright tasting, my husband churrasco was ok and the yuca con mojo where somewhat dry. The sandwich was good. We also ordered some mamey shake which had a very strange flavor as if they used frozen mamey to make it.  When we got the check it was wrong so they have to go fix it.

It's a Cuban restaurant that is a cross of authentic food with an upscale presentation and higher standard of service.  Yet without a higher price tag.  Imagine if Nana had taken a culinary class.  It's in a 3 star neighborhood with 4 star food.

There are mainstays like toasted Cuban pork or beef sandwiches.  Plantains, bruschetta, croquetas and the lot are all there.  The other tapa sized dishes include 2 lamb chops that are so savory, shrimp and Mahi ceviche and a masitas fritas pork medalion with a nice texture to it as well.

As far as the mains you can't go wrong with the Lechon Asado, easily my favorite main.  So tender and dripping with some kind of delicious sauce with rice black beans and that really fresh tasty salad.  Mix all these in each bite and it may become a favorite for you too.

The Camarones Al  Ajillo is a Cuban twist on scampi lemon buttery sauced GIGANTIC shrimp with black beans and rice.  Better than any description I could ever attempt to give.

Not too fond of the Ropa Vieja.  A shredded beef and sautee'd peppers and onions. 
It must be an authentic dish.  It's not bad I may just be spoiled by the other courses. 

You can't go wrong with an espresso and a Leche Flan or Tiramisu for dessert afterwards.

You wont break the bank here and you will be satisfied.  I still taste the savory and decadently rich sweetness of the meals here.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,5,3,4,Y3S5-RM6LQbpIyrbZrpaLg

I had a riesling and my husband had a good but not strong mojito. 
I really really enjoyed the generous space between tables, for you get just the right amount of privacy, and I cannot abide sitting elbow to elbow with other diners.

One observation, which is easily reparable, is the lack of lighting for reading the laminated menu. It was dark in the restaurant.

Their menu isn't HUGE but has most of the Cuban staples. Ropa Vieja was a must for me. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I even make it myself, however today was a day I would like to spend away from the kitchen.

We ordered the avocado salad and lamb chops to start. The avocado salad is basically just an avocado cut in slices and nicely arranged around a small cabbage and tomato salad. The avocados were tasty and soft but the salad in the middle lacked some flavor. I threw some salt on the avos and ate just them. The lamb chops (from what I heard) were very good. I don't eat lamb so I can't elaborate on this.

For entrees we ordered the ropa vieja (appetizer portion), a side of rice to sop up all the juicy goodness that comes with ropa (more on this later), a rack of lamb and the tasting platter, which consisted of ropa, a chicken dish and a pork dish. When the ropa came out, there was NO JUICE! :( I was disappointed to say the least. Every time I have made this or had this the beef was always swimming in that tasty juice. Because of this the ropa was pretty dry. The flavor was good but because of the lack of moisture I couldn't even eat it with the rice. The lamb chops (again from what I heard) were good. The spinach that comes with them, although good, had no real flavor. It needed some garlic or other flavoring. The tasting platter was good as well. The pork was fork tender, the chicken was spicy (just as my friend had ordered it), however she too stated the ropa was a little dry for her taste. 

For dessert we ordered tres leches, flan and guava with cream cheese. The tres leches tasted like store bought pound cake that had been soaked in milk. The flan actually tasted more like tres leches than the real thing. I am not a flan fan because of its texture but this was a little stiffer and more like a cheesecake. The guava with cream cheese was swimming in a sweet sauce and not what I was used to. I am not familiar with the authentic presentation of this dish, however when I dined in little cuba in Tampa, it was always served as a slice of guava paste topped with cream cheese. This was more of a runny paste soaked in simple syrup topped with a line of cream cheese.

All in all the experience wasn't horrible, however I would not go back. They messed up on the bill and overcharged us, and then when it was corrected the total was still the same. I was not going to argue over $10 so we just ignored it. The bread they give you in very good and with a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate it was worth the try. I guess I will be searching for more Cuban restaurants in the very near future!",LEXKyVpF1Utm6eJOsQIz8A,1,1,3,twszzBP8_VbmbUReY_bMGw

The staff is incredibly personable, and the service is great. I don't think it's ever taken more than 10-15 minutes to receive our food. My favorite thing to order is the Cubano with some fried yucca. The yucca comes with a delicious garlic sauce.

I also like to order a Cuban lemonade, which is lemonade blended with some ice and mint. It's incredibly refreshing and pairs well with their food.

This is a really cool cafe and what seems to be a family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Cuban style artwork. When I called them, they mentioned to make reservations if you have more then 5 people.

Their happy hour is from Monday to Friday, buy one get one drinks from 5pm to 8pm and live music and dancing from 9pm.

The menu is loaded with a good variety of choices. It was tough to choose what I wanted and I asked the server what is popular. He said the Tasting Plate and The rack of Lamb. They bring out a basket of bread, buttered and toasty.

I got the tasting plate, because I think it would be a good idea and I was very pleased. It was priced at $16.95 and was one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get an abundance of traditional favorites. It has Beef ( Ropa vieja), Pork (Puerco asado) and Chicken ( Pollo Grand Marnier) and comes with rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a lettuce salad. My fave was the beef and the rice.

The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly but was slow. We waited a while for the food and the check.

I've recommended and brought many friends and relatives here and they have all agreed that compared to Versailles or other Cuban restaurants we have been too this is by far the Best. 

Even my Cuban friends have loved the experience and food here. Today I was back in Vegas and as is usual for me I went in for lunch with a friend who had never had Cuban food. She LOVED IT! The croquetas were delicious, as was my Picadillo (as usual) and the Salmon was exquisite.

I ordered the tasting plate to get an overall of their food.  The tasting plate consists of three meats--lechon asado, pollo tequilla, and ropa vieja.  The lechon was tender and juicy but I didn't get any of the garlic taste that the menu speaks of under that plate.  The pollo was very good and the sauce on it had a nice kick.  Far and away the best part of the plate was the ropa vieja.  This was juicy, tender, and very flavorful.  Along with the plate was a small salad and some rice and beans, the well known moros y cristianos.  There was a basked of cuban bread with the meal also.

For dessert, I had the guava shells with cream cheese.  I had iced tea and it was refilled promptly.  Service was very friendly.  A man and a woman were covering the tables and they worked well in tandem.

If you haven't tried Cuban food before, this is a great place to start. For the uninitiated, the tasting plate is your best choice, both in value and variety. You will get a little bit of everything. Their black beans and rice is very good, although I'm not the hugest fan of cumin in Cuban food. Their lechon asada was melt in your mouth good. If you are looking for the ""old reliable"" of Cuban food, go with Ropa Vieja. The shredded beef is delicious. 

I would skip the yucca as it was cooked too long and became mushy. It had a little bit of garlic, but I love my yucca with a ton of garlic. The tostones (plaintain chips) were decent, however, I prefer them crispier.

Just be prepared as the prices are a little bit on the higher side for the food. Entree plates are around $13-15. 

The service left plenty to be desired unfortunately. Our server arrived quickly to the table but then proceeded to disappear for at least 20 minutes after we asked for a few more minutes to decide our order. It was hard to actually get our server at the table. The water at the table was never refilled and plates hung out on the table for too long. 

It was also a bummer that there was no live entertainment even though I believe Saturday nights were supposed to have live entertainment. The music they piped in got me dancing in my seat so that was a win.

Searching for nearby new places to eat I came along the reviews for here and decided it was time to try some Cuban food.  I have actually pulled into the parking lot thinking about trying this place one other time but didn't so I was happy to give it a shot! 

Here is a list of what we tried. 
-For appetizers (Tapas) we had Empanadas de res o pollo beef or chicken we had beef.  As one reviewer before me mentioned it was a work of art it was a light crisp crust with a very flavorful filling I could have just had a few of these for dinner.  
-Tamal criollo homemade tamale the masa was a darker color with a bit more flavor then what I have had before it was good however it was a bit dry for my taste.
-For dinner we followed other reviewers and tried theTasting plate a combo of Roos Vieja, rich spicy beef simmered with onions and peppers.  Pollo Tequila Mar chicken with herbs and a spicy tequila  sauce.  Lechon Asado marinaded pork in a garlic olive oil this was my favorite it reminded me of a well cooked turkey dinner!  Served with Moros Cristianos a black bean rice good but saved that for lunch because this is a TON of food.   Also served with Maduros ( a fried sweet plantain) 

All in all the food was good the price was fair for the serving side the ambiance was nice.  It is a busy restaurant a constant flow of people on a Monday night!  The service was good the cooking was a bit on the slow side but like I said they were very busy so I won't fault them for that because they did bring our apps before dinner so we were fine chatting while waited. 

I am going back for a lunch of a cuban sandwich soon I can't wait to try that.  I also noticed them bringing out to almost every table the Batidos a Cuban milkshake in many flavors I don't quite know how I am going to fit this all into my stomach but I am going to try.",dOfw4EqYemgl21qtJ8D9jQ,3,0,4,EJOaYEzBRyh0OcEW3KpstA

One of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.  For my meal I got the Lechon Asado, which is roasted pork shoulder.  The meal comes with black beans cook in the rice and a small salad.  I  also ordered a side of plantains.  The serving of pork was generous.  The pork was marinated with a garlic mojo and flavorful.  The meat was very tender and moist.  The rice and beans were excellent. 

My friend  ordered the bistec empanizado which is a breaded thin steak it too came with rice and beans and a small salad.  I tried the steak, it had great  flavor but was a tad dry.  Still very good. 

They will bring you bread for free.  The bread was very good.

Came with some friends to eat dinner. They shoved us all the way in the back corner and then forgot about us. I totally felt like Baby in Dirty Dancing and I was waiting for Partick Swayze to save me. Because I was hungry and I am pretty sure it was a legitimate half hour before they came to take our food order. Luckily we were having a good time talking about catching up so we didn't make a fuss, but it was still a little bit odd. 

I have food fomo where I want to try several dishes but I am afraid that I might order one that I don't like. So I definitely went for the tasting plate because I wanted to try a little bit of everything. We also ordered a plate of tostones and yuca. 

Tostones were not as crispy as I usually like them to be but I liked their dipping sauce. I won't offer up my opinion on Cuba Cafe's  yuca because I really do not like that starchy dish, no matter how many times I have tried it  when my Cuban fiance orders it, or at my future in-laws house for family dinner, or when I lived in South Florida for a little while. With my tasting plate, I thought the the chicken was the best of the three different proteins. The black beans and rice were delicious. I am always a big fan of maduros and they did not disappoint.

Greeted with Latin beats and a friendly staff is the best way to come in out of the cold. We were immediately tempted with their BOGO Happy Hour mojitos...coconut, pineapple flavors. Being ""lightweights"", we asked them to take it easy on the alcohol--well, I don't think the bartender's heavy pour hand got the message since we both felt a slight buzz after only a couple sips :) Warm buttered bread was very much a needed alcohol buffer.
The menu offered many appealing choices from tapas like empanadas, tostones, to chicken, beef and seafood entrees. The one item we were looking for wasn't listed on the menu. It was a favorite entree offered at Havana Grill...the pollo ala plancha. But, ASK and you shall receive!  Our server said they did offer it and 2 orders later we enjoyed our favorite marinated thin chicken breast topped with saut√©ed onions, served with a medley side salad that was the perfect addition to complete this healthy & delicious meal.

4451637,2013-07-19,5,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"I was hoping Cuba Cafe would be a knock-out because it is so close to home, but it came in at just A-OK after my husband and I made a special trip here to use a Restaurant.com coupon I've been holding onto for awhile now. 

In the past I have not had a lot of experience with Cuban food save for the couple times I have been to Havana Grill (which is in Henderson). The couple times I had had it I really enjoyed it, and was hoping Cuba Cafe would produce some of those same feelings. 

Let's start with the fact that the place could use a serious face lift. When we walked in I thought we had entered an Elks Lodge dining area. Have any of you out there been in an Elks Lodge with a dining area and a bar? Do you KNOW what I'm talking about? Anyway, besides the Elks Lodge feel it is also very PURPLE... purple walls, purple table clothes, purple curtains... man, I haven't seen that much purple in a long time. So the ambiance is less than appealing. How about service?

There were two people manning the floor - what appeared to be the waitress/hostess and a busser. However, the busser handled the majority of the tables. He brought our drinks, refilled our drinks, brought our food, asked us how everything was, cleared our plates. The only thing he did not do was to take our order and deliver the check. I couldn't decide who our actual server was, but the girl waitress/hostess wasn't very congenial, except for when I asked for our fried plantains to be brought out before the other food...

Speaking of food. We ordered the fried plantains as our appetizer. My husband described them as ""Tasting like an onion ring on the outside and not-ripe-enough banana on the inside"". He was right. The plantains were not what I was hoping for. As for main dishes I got the bistec sandwich, which is a piece of flat steak pressed with tomato, lettuce, and little potatolings that are fried with a sauce of sorts. This was a pretty good sandwich, but I wish the steak had not been as chewy/sinewy as it was. My husband, who wasn't into the whole ""Cuban food"" idea ordered the chicken sandwich, which was basically exactly like my bistec.

Our other side was french fries and they are nice a fat, crispy, none of them were soggy, actually quite enjoyable.

Overall with the purple dining experience and the not-so-amazing food I have to go with 3 stars. The place isn't bad and maybe I should have ordered something else, perhaps the ""ropa"" meat dish everyone exclaims about, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full plate. This place is so close to home I am not going to say I won't be back, but I don't think it was good enough to have me running back for seconds right away.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,4,3,qEh712KlZaz8kKFHoIWXMA

This time my daughter ordered their pollo guisado/fricase and I don't know what happened but it tasted like burned (ahumado, como que se quemo en la olla y como quiera lo sirvieron) so I don't think we'll be ordering this dish anymore (it is a shame because we like this dish very much and in other occasions it was delicious).

I wrote my last review 3 1/2 years ago and gave it four stars.  It's quite a distance from home, so we're not regulars.  I think we were there once after that first visit.  But this time we were meeting friends from Henderson and, like so many from that part of the valley, driving anywhere but nearby is an odyssey to be undertaken, well...never.  So we shlepped to East Tropicana, after convincing them that Cuba Cafe was worth their short drive.

The guys each had a Bud Light, my girlfriend ordered a Pinot Grigio, and I had a German Riesling that was excellent.  So far, so good.

We gave in our orders, and the waitress returned to tell my friend that her Mango Salmon was not to be; they were out of salmon.  She switched to Lechon Asado.  Her husband, Mr. Picky Eater, ordered Rice with Chicken Breast, probably the plainest choice on the menu.  Mine ordered Chicken in Peanut sauce over linguine, and I stayed with the same tasting plate as I had the first time, mainly because I had a hankering for maduros, the sweet plantains.  But there were just two small pieces.  My dish came complete with a serving of...ALUMINUM FOIL, nestled right in the beef.  When I pointed this out, the other waitress snatched it away, saying they'd remake it.  It's noteworthy that from the moment we entered the restaurant until our departure, there was not a scintilla of a smile from either of these two.  It was more like the ice in the water that we weren't served. 

My friend said her pork was tender, and she liked her dish.  Mr. Picky picked at his food and said it was okay.  Then again, I've never heard him rave about anything anywhere.  I had some of the linguine dish.  The chicken was very tender, but the linguine were a little too soft for my taste.  Not mushy, but I prefer al dente, which this wasn't.  Though Cuban food is not known for its spice, this was described as having a peanut-chipotle sauce, but there wasn't much chipotle to be found.  My replaced Tasting Plate was okay, sans foil, but was oversalted.  I always turn down water when it's offered, because all I ever drink is wine or coffee, but this time I sure could have used it.  Except it wasn't offered.

At 9 p.m. almost all diners were gone, and that's when an excellent latino band started to play.  I love those congas!!!  Apparently, this place turns into a club on the weekends, when they're open much later, complete with dancing.  My advice, if you're into this kind of music - my personal favorite -  is to go for a drink, the music, and some dancing.  Because if you're there for dinner...

The real ""fun"" started when we got the check, which was delivered without us asking.  No one bothered to ask if we'd like dessert or coffee.  And it was just ONE check. My friend had asked for separate checks right when we ordered.  Moreover, it's a good thing we checked that check, which is probably why it's called ""check"" in the first place.

Two beers had become four.  One pinot grigio became two.  The elusive salmon wasn't in the kitchen, but it was right there on the bill, along with the lechon asado that was substituted.  WTF???  The waitress gave us some double-talk about her ringing up the drinks and the bartender also ringing them up.  And when I asked to see a manager, this very young woman said that she was in charge.  Maybe, but it sure seemed like the other woman was more owner-like.  To their credit, they did make good on the bill by removing the extra drinks, making it two checks, and comping both my friend's and my dish, though we didn't ask for anything except to remove the charges that shouldn't have been there.  Still, it made for a very unpleasant finale to a meal that was in a nice setting but oh, so ordinary.  And I'm still thirsty.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,12,6,2,-mS3fdoTNHbAa_AW7kh1_w

From the outside this cafe looks like a ghetto bail bonds fast food take out.  But when you walk into the cafe you smell the amazing food and the decor is a cafe in Cuba.  At 2:00pm on a sunday this place was buzzing with people.  I ordered the picture on the front page of the menu.  Some kind of roast pork.  My girl friend and her boy friend ordered the tasting plate to share and got a side of the Lamb appetizers.  The bread is buttered and crunchy.  My fav!  My Pork meal was delicious!  The meat was tender and juicy.  Full of flavor.  Comes with rice and beans and a side salad.  The tasting plate was pretty good.  Comes with the pork also and two other meats, rice&beans, salad, and plantain.  The Lamb chops (2 pieces) was what stole the show.  We ordered medium and it came medium rare.  How lamb so be.  Flavor again was out of this world.  Lamb is my favorite thing to order but also the hardest thing to get right.  They lamb is great.  5 stars!

4870296,2014-07-05,0,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"Mmmm Meat. I've only been to Cuba Cafe for lunch, but it's a pretty great lunch place. I am still trying to get my south florida native husband to come with me and offer a final verdict (I'll update the review when I do), but for my midwestern money, this is pretty darn tasty cuban.

If you can't decide between ropa vieja and lechon asado, you can get both with the tasting plate. The buttery bread that comes free is sort of ridiculously delicious for just bread and butter. I don't even know what they do to it. 

The plantains, both sweet and savory are wonderful; I've gotten soggy tostones at other cuban places not in florida, and these are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and come with a garlic oil that's meant for slatherin'.

Pros;
- Very tasty food, very friendly staff that will translate and recommend for your incredibly white co-workers without embarrassing anyone.  
- Prices are pretty affordable for the amount and quality of food; it's a ton of protein and greens, so it's definitely not fast food pricing. 
- Never feel sick after eating here, even if I eat way too much. It's also possible to find Low Carb options if you can resist the bread and plantains. Good luck with that?
- Easy parking in a location easy for locals.

Cons:
- At least at lunch time, the restaurant is a little on the dark side. It can be a little hard to see your food.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,0,0,4,M7BytYYBEUd7zjWt9xU0AA
4884710,2010-09-28,2,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"Cuba Cafe is okay, but nothing too special.  I come to Cuba Cafe simply for their sandwiches.  Cuban sandwiches are cheap and, almost always good.  I usually get the Pan con Bistec (steak sandwich) or the Pan con Lechon (roasted pork sandwich).  While I have had much better of both, the other Cuban restaurants in town are so mediocre that I settle for Cuba Cafe.  Make sure you ask for a side of mojo or any sauce they have with the sandwiches.  They are rather dry otherwise.  

The empanadas are one of the high points for Cuba Cafe, as well as the croquetas.  Both are a little more expensive than I'd like to pay, but are good nonetheless.  Also get an Iron Beer while you're here.  It's not beer, it's a Cuban soda.

But as the story goes by the time we'd remember it or see it, we'd already eaten. So finally yesterday afternoon after picking him up from the airport his we saw it... like a beacon in the night! CUBA CAFE! He was soooo excited. Finally! he was getting to eat at the place he'd wanted to eat @ for SO Long!

We walked in, very small - feels like you're in someone's living room its that small. Purple, pink, blue and green walls. about 4 tables - pretty much slow looking. Perfect. He ordered some kinda Cuban Pasta dish. I ordered the classic cuban sandwich since I was pretty hungry I didn't want to order anything that was too complicated or took too long to cook. It was about 820 pm. 

JUST BREAD AND WATER: We got our water, free circle cuban bread - pretty good but I didnt want to fill up on bread b/c my sandwich had bread and i""m trying not to eat carbs for dinner.. only for brkfast or lunch.  So we wait and we wait. and WAIT. and wait some more. 

OTHER TABLES: A couple comes in. They sit. They order, they drink. they eat. They finish and they leave. Sitting right next to us mind you. . The 2nd couple comes in - they sit, they order, they're eating... Then the 3rd guy.  a lone ranger guy comes in and orders an appetizer but doesnt eat it.. They i see a plate coming out thinking ooh its finally us.. nope it goes to appetizer guy who has a full plate of appetizer and ISNT EATING IT.. get's a 2ND PLATE!!!

then it happened... THE CAMEL. THE STRAW.  IT BROKE. 

My Bf and I shot up simutaneously. That was it. That finally did it. ARe you FREAKING KIDDING ME??  3 tables that walked in AFTER US were already eating. and it wasnt like we got there at the same time. Lone ranger guy walked in a good 25 min. after we got there. after 45 we had flipped a coin to decide if we stayed or left. Eventhough ""leaving"" won the coin toss I decided I was hungry and we'd already waited this long, I felt bad that the food was in preperation, how do you leave? Do we just ask how long? Do we politely tell them to withdraw the order? Do we just bail? What's the protocol? I'd never waited that long in such an empty restaurant. 

But the second lone ranger got his appetizer and his dinner and the couple that walked in 15 min. after us had come, eaten and left 10 min. ago.. and yet another couple was already eating their dinner too.. was just oo much to bear. We asked our spanish only speaking server what did we owe her for the bread and water - she asked if we didn want our order? 

my bf told her in spanish (beware if you dont speak spanish...this could pose a problem during ordering as it did for me) we've already waited for an hour for our food. She said well pasta takes a long time - really? at my house the box says 10-11 minutes once the water is boiling. and even LESS if the pasta is fresh made which I doubt is the case. Over an hr and change for pasta and a sandwich (your most popular dish on the menu) POR FAVOR. 

Never again Cuba Cafe.. next time I want Cuban I'm going to try some place else. 

We drove down the street to Sushi Twister. sat ordered, ate and left all totalling a whopping 45 minutes. chickn teriyaki, salad, miso soup, salad, 8 pc california roll and 2 shrimp tempura - all in less than 45 min.

First up is the complimentary Cuban bread...yum! It was super soft, flavorful and slightly sweet... without butter! Next time I should order a plate of this and eat it for dinner lol.

I wanted to try their version of ceviche :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=ITCFfFj3Ld3slT4V0v8kyA#ITCFfFj3Ld3slT4V0v8kyA

Not sure if this is how they do it in Cuba, but there was almost no citrus flavor at all! It was good, but there was a mayo-like sauce all over it, and it didn't have that slight bite that I have grown to love in Mexican style ceviche.

We ordered the Tasting Plate appetizer platter, which came with Beef Empanadas, Mariquitas and Croquetas :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=6-X7yQIAcyAHpDA9LJwQ0A#6-X7yQIAcyAHpDA9LJwQ0A

Empanadas were good, but the Croquetas were great....filled with Ham and Beef. Empanadas were a little bready, so I didn't eat the crusts..but the insides were yummy.

And to finish, we ordered another Tasting Plate with Ropa Vieja, Lechon Asado & Pollo Tequila with Moros Cristianos and Maduros :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuba-cafe-restaurant-las-vegas?select=KeTx5zyAkYesrDvHzq3qnQ#KeTx5zyAkYesrDvHzq3qnQ

The Pollo was ok...a little overcooked and all the flavor was in the sauce. The Lechon was good...My favorite was the Ropa Vieja! It was a rich and slightly spicy shredded beef simmered with onions & peppers. Yum!

I took off a star for service...or lack thereof.  We ordered the ceviche before the rest of the courses, and since this is ""cooked"" hours before, this should have been very simple to toss on a plate and send our way.  But ALL of the food showed up at once...the appetizer, the second appetizer, and the main course.  The waitress had a very surprised look when I made eye contact, and then the food came almost immediately after...something tells me it was waiting for a while.

I knew about some Latin places in Las Vegas but I didn't know they have Cuban restaurants. I called and made reservations for two (you never know in Las Vegas.) When we arrived I was super excited, the place wasn't very busy. The host took us to our table. I liked the place is really cute, cozy and even romantic. We were told that on Fridays they have a live band. We ordered two mojitos (of course) and empanadas to start. We ordered beef, chicken and chorizo (yes! They have chorizo empanadas! The best empanadas ever) while we were waiting we got some bread sticks which were really fresh and soft. 
When the empanadas arrived we ate all of them! They all tasted really good but our  favorite was the CHORIZO EMPANADA. We ordered for main course Cuban sandwich and ""tostones"" as a side dish.

Experiencing ""real"" Cuban cuisine for the first time just under a year ago during a trip to South Florida, it was finally on Saturday night that I sat with a friend who'd never tasted a Cubano, let alone Ropa Vieja, inside Cuba Cafe on East Tropicana and tasting our way through fifteen items by way of appetizers, entrees, desserts, and samplers the results were a mixed bag of decent to excellent with a pricepoint congruent to the quality of the fare.

Larger in size than one might guess, the low ceilings, dim lighting, and live music with a rose at each table providing a romantic sort of feel, it was a bit too close to the crooners that we were first seated and despite being at only 1/3 capacity it was not until one of several dirty tables was bussed that a move was accommodated, a large order soon to follow with minimal delay from the kitchen as conversation ensued and beverage refills were repeatedly offered.

Starting off with buttered bread that wasn't especially appealing or particularly ""Cuban"" in any way, it was not long before a duo of ""appetizers"" arrived to render the basket irrelevant, a sampler of four items including plantain chips highlighted by creamy croquetas while the empanada trended a bit greasy, a pressed Cuban Sandwich not quite as crispy as those found in Miami though the meat to cheese ratio and light application of mustard and pickle was on point.

Insisting that a Cuban friend said the Camarones Enchilados was good, though the resulting plate was little more than some previously frozen U16 shrimp cooked a bit too firm beneath a ladle of sauce not really distinctive from that at any checkered-tablecloth spot, a far better value was found in the tasting plate of Beef, Chicken, and Pork with smashed plantains and tender beans with rice - the Ropa robustly flavored by onions and peppers without being overwhelmed while the Lechon was a bit too fatty to be enjoyed in its entirety, the chicken trending a touch sweet but certainly not bad by any means.

Doing the heavy lifting on most of the food, it was still essential that dessert be ordered in order to evaluate the experience as a whole, and thankfully finding a willing partner to tackle the restaurant's two ""de la casa"" signatures, the combination of flan and tres leches an excellent rendition of each with light notes of pineapple while a 'flambe' of strawberries was tasty enough, but also a bit disappointing as I'd half-expected a fiery tableside show.

***Competently executing some Cuban Classics while also offering several options for those not entirely interested in going all-in on such heavy Ethnic fare, Cuba Cafe fills a niche for those with a craving while also offering an introduction to any who are curious without breaking the bank...or boarding a plane.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,10,3,2OY9Tw0rh-FfxCCa8zXXsw

The shrimp ceviche also came with plantain chips cut differently.  The plantain chips were...well, plantain chips.

For our entree, we got the tasting plate: pollo tequila, lechon asado, ropa vieja with Moros Cristianos, maduros/sweet plantains, and beans and rice.  I liked the lechon asado, ropa vieja and maduros.  The lechon was tender and juicy but I wish it had crispy skin to it.  The ropa vieja was tender and didn't lack flavor unlike the pollo tequila.

The service was not so good.  The server took our order and gave us our basket of bread and forgot about us.  She didn't check on us.

       - Authenticity - I've tried about 4 other Cuban places around the valley and I like this one the best. The food has a home cooked feel.
       - Quality - Of the couple things I've tried, I couldn't say a bad thing about any of them. The meat was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection.
       - Area - The area is not the greatest. It's in a shadier part of town, but the food is well worth the risk.
       - Buttered Toasted Bread - They bring you this bread before your meal. It's crazy good and definitely terrible for you (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=qfjltfAcu4Cqwqk6nQi2xg).
**Ordered**
       - $11.95 Lechon Asado - Leg of pork. It comes with moros (rice/black beans) and their salad. This is my favorite dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=1cWPUf5Xc2SiGblokqdwIg).
       - $13.95 Ropa Vieja - Shredded marinated beef. It also comes with moros and their salad. Personally, I find the marinate to be too strong, but I prefer a bit more bland than others.
       - $14.95 Tasting Plate - Comes with Ropa Vieja, Lechon Asado, and Pollo Tequila with moros, salad, and plantains. If you're unsure what to order, this would be the thing to get. It has their most popular choices all in one plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ?select=yTPnf0qnrCcXZqoCZQBfAQ#yTPnf0qnrCcXZqoCZQBfAQ).

5373253,2011-07-07,1,jmyvOW6G2T1fIePvajB4nQ,"I wish I had paid more attention to the area around UNLV while I was attending school. The diversity of cuisines are a bit awe inspiring even though some might sound better than they really are. 

Cuba Cafe is at street view, but at night does not stand out because this area is poorly lit. The restaurant is accessible through a gated patio area and the inside has less than ten tables. The quaint shop is intimate and quiet with low level Spanish music playing. 

Came here with a few friends around 8:30pm and the restaurant was steady, but emptying out. We were greeted promptly with menus and our drink orders were taken. The waitress was quick to try and take our order, but we were still deciding. After some time, Jason B. ordered the pan con bistec. A thin cut beef sandwich served on grilled Cuban bread with lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and potato strings. At $7.50, it was not a bad deal. There wasn't very much meat, but it was tender. If you are looking for a thick American style steak, this is not the sandwich for you. It was tasty and the flavors were not leaning towards any extremes. Another friend and I shared the tasting plate and an order of the yuca al mojo o frita. We were warned that the tasting plate was small and might not be enough for the two of us. If it wasn't so late, or if I was really hungry, I would understand why, but neither of us were looking for a full meal. The sampling of pork, beef, chicken, mixed rice and black beans, fried plantains, and salad was enough to satisfy. The two slices of lechon asado were tender and moist. The pollo tequila was ok, but nothing special. The ropa vieja was the stand out dish. It was flavorful without being overbearing and went well with the rice. The plantains were crispy at the edges, soft and moist on the inside, sweet, but came in three small pieces. At $14.95, if you are super hungry, it would be upsetting to see. The yuca were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. A strong garlic flavor was present in every bite while the flesh of the tuber was soft, moist, and picked up the essence of the olive oil. 

Overall I found elements of each dish that I liked, but as a whole it was mediocre. I would come again because I did not get a chance to scout out the arroz con pollo.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,3,J82UF8qb4OrCLA52xHVzJQ

I walked in with my brother and we were told to sit wherever. We sat towards the back of the cafe, which was a mistake. For starters, I felt like we were ""out of sight out of mind"" to the wait staff, as it took 15 minutes to get our drink orders. Also, they seem to have a scent diffuser back there, so with every bite I got a perfumey taste. Yuck. 

The food was good but I didn't really feel like it was made fresh. It definitely didn't have the authentic feel, and after ordering a few items from the tapas menu our total came out to $40, which seemed ridiculous. The entrees were extremely pricey, and I wasn't hungry enough for their portion sizes.

A friend found this place here on Yelp.That was 8 months ago. I am here so often, I am surprised I don't have a name tag. 

The lamb chops alone will have me stopping there for dinner on the way home from work. Add the mariquitas con mojo and an avocado salad and I am a happy diner. I am told the bread is absolutely perfect (I can't eat it, but watch it devoured every time I take anyone with me).

Proteins are always tender and, depending on the dish, cooked to order. The salads are fresh (I might suggest a little more balsamic on the caprese and avocado salads), the flavors are deep and so complicated as to seem simple... spot on. 

The latin-caribbean blend of flavors is nothing found in a spice jar and the care they put into their food is readily apparent. Sometimes the dishes can come out a little slowly... but when you bite into it, you find it's worth it. Nothing assembly line here. 

FYI: The mozzarella and peppers salad is a caprese salad... sub sweet red peppers for the usual tomatoes. I tried this on Sunday and I have a new favorite way to eat a caprese. A great, flavorful twist on a simple staple.

Everyone is ready with a smile and happy to offer assistance in making choices or - sometimes unavoidable - substitutions. (Try not to, if you can, and trust this family to feed you well.) The menu is broad and will cater to almost any palette, and the specials change all the time so that they can offer you something new and tasty to keep you coming back.

Easy on the pocketbook (sign up for their email specials and find them on Restaurant.com), always tasty, and friendly to boot, how could this not be a favorite?

The food was ok but a bit over priced for the delivered product. The appetizers were the worst offenders.   The only item that was memorable is the Cubano sandwich.   It was really tasty and I enjoyed it.   

If I was going to return, I would go here for lunch and order just the Cubano.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,2,0,3,HfiyfMfQtQ9vZ28gOyFagw

I grew up eating Puerto Rican traditional dishes and on vacays going to Cuban family owned restaurants in Orlando. The friendly workers split our taster plates on two separate plates for my grandparents who were sharing the ""Sampler plate"" which is delicious. Everyone was very sweet and would compliment me on my Afro, I felt like I was right back in Florida, I was accepted. I would love to come back when I'm in town! I ordered the Pollo Fricase with nergo y habichuelas, Black beans and rice. It was so delicious and tasted and looks like what my mom cooks at home. I wasn't a fan of the salad but that's ok! To each is own. I took a couple bites of it, I felt it was rather sweet for my taste. I had a rather large group +4 and my table felt spacious yet intimate. I liked it! And it seemed like my grandparents knew the owners as well. Well I can't wait to go back!

I must return for more tostones with mojo! It taste just like what my mom makes at home! Add some Huy Fong Chili Paste! For a kick of spice",5YDLbL76m1mzbvQbD4p0xw,2,0,5,AcJIlnNYqGwQtkIOtgKR2Q

And to be honest, I've passed this place many times without giving it a second thought.   Then, the other day, wifey and I went there for lunch.   

The place was mostly empty, but it was an unusual hour.   We grabbed a table and got started with some espresso and water.   The espresso was very well done, I don't like sugar in mine, and this was strong and flavorful.   

We decided on what we were going to have.  Wifey had a sampler platter and I got the Cuban sandwich.   Both were really good.  The pork was both tender and flavorful.  My sandwich was very good and the bread was top notch.   She had plantain chip with her sample platter which was really good.   

Overall, this is a great place if you are craving something Cuban.   Good job folks, will I be back?  You bet.",5wRCMyU9dEdkja_mO0qfeQ,1,0,4,DlU1iMedLHfQIx53IM_2-A

I have only ever eaten Cuban food in the kitchen of my friends.  This was even more amazing (and to beat out my friend's mom's empanadas, you have GOT to be good).  We went twice in a week and tried to bribe the people at the restaurant to move the entire establishment to DC.  Alas, they did not come back with us.  

Great food.  Cheap.  Cute little quirky joint.

Easy to find location.  Cute interior.  Nice Latin music.  

We tried the green plantains and combo ceviche for starters.  Plantains were piping hot with a butter garlic sauce.  The ceviche has a mayo dressing...different but super good.  Huge chunks of ceviche.  Gotta add the hot sauce for a little kick!

Can't decide on a main dish....??  Try the sampler like us!  It was all wonderful.  The rice and beans a perfect combo to the spicy meat.  

Oh and the gratis Cuban bread....so good and buttery!!!

I started with  the pork ribs.  Not a lot of sauce and they are oven cooked, so no smoky taste, but they were cooked properly and had a nice texture. They also same with a small scoop black beans and rice and a small salad.  I could have had that as just a meal for $5.95, but I wanted to try more things/
I then had the combination plate that had an empanada, plaintain chips and several deep fried items.  Were they good?  I ate them all!  
There are a large number of items that I would love to try so I will go back there with friends.
The service was also friendly, but sometimes there were a few stumbles with the language barrier, but all of my items were correct and I got to practicando mi espagnol.",1Qca4FtV1tUp-WZz9APgzA,1,0,3,86JoLhYKWtjtJeIYekALng
