Nor should it be called vegetarian if said vegetable dish contains chicken and beef broths and sauces.  Also QUIT A+WALKING THROUGH PEOPLES' yard!  There is a S.I.D.E.W.A.L.K. for a reason and you should learn to respect property.  Then after you trip over and knock over a fence in FRONT of the owner of the house you should probably...I don't know...say ""sorry"", maybe try to put it back or pick it up!  Not look up at them, then just continue to saunter of through the yard!  Also, if you get the order wrong and the vegetarian who ordered off of the VEGITARIAN MENU cannot eat the food because you messed up the order, then you should probably either deliver a new one and take the old back, or maybe...I don't know...give their money back since they just  couldn't eat it.  You probably should NOT try to charge ANOTHER plate and DELIVERY fee.  What is wrong with you, seriously?!",uYIIu4Y9WKL0WqsONsIWlw,2,0,1,elkCAB8nAXa2KPgqM-8BWQ

We order the chicken lettuce wraps, crab Rangoon, wonton soup, egg drop soup, chicken chow mien and the beef with broccoli.

I got general Taos it was good, crunchy outside...not super soft like in malls. My kids got chicken and broccoli which was on par with most take outs.

250800,2013-02-03,3,Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA,"I usually judge a food place by my overall experience as opposed to focusing only on the quality of the food and service. That experience starts from the moment I get out of my car. For starters, the moment I opened my car door before stepping out, I was met with a ""hey big man (I'm a big man), you help me out with some change for the bus?""  Mind you, I parked right in front of the place so this is definitely a demerit against them as they have every right and responsibility as a business to prevent this sort of thing from happening. It's not like I have a phobia of homeless folks, but there's nothing like having a filthy greasy booze-breathed hobo greet me at my car on my way into a restaurant  to whet the appetite.

Once I give the guy some change, I walk in to this typical strip mall Chinese take-out style eatery and am immediately greeted with ""for here or to-go?"" From across the room. When I'm ordering, I ask if they have unsweetened Iced tea. She doesn't know, she asks the girl right next to her who ignores her. We stand there for 20 seconds of silence before a man walks out and lists off the iced teas. I ask, ""Are they all sweetened?"" He lists them all off again. He didn't understand the question. I get it, this is America and there will be times where you run across a foreigner and cannot understand their language, I'm in their place, so I nod and ask for water. The first bottled water I receive had been previously opened. I tell them and they look at me like I'm crazy before getting me a new bottle. 

When the food arrives, the server places the largest plate of chicken katsu I've ever seen on the table in front of me. I would have been extremely impressed by this had I not ordered the beef with broccoli. I tell the server and I get the same look like I'm lying or something. Finally the beef with broccoli arrives on a large plate accompanied by a second large plate covered in steamed rice. Looks good! It was NOT! 

First of all, I was given a large spoon to eat my beef with broccoli. At this point, I don't feel like getting another look, so I pretend that I am accustomed to eating broccoli with a spoon and I smile and say thank you. Then I take the first bite. DISGUSTING!  It tasted like pounded beef fat covered in pure oyster sauce dipped in salt. The broccoli was a bit overcooked and every so often while hovering over my plate to prevent lap spillage, I get a whiff of some foul stank feet. No, it was not me, it was the plate. I have worked in enough short order kitchens to recognize that scent. It's filthy dish water. I was so appalled that I bothered to write this review. I would not have normally bothered to write a review of a strip mall place, but it was so gnarly that I want to prevent anyone from going to China One.",7BY6b405rPD0xmSwcXkBZg,4,1,1,vzg4j2R766EVtx5joiSfoQ

The wonton soup was huge and full on wontons, shrimp, pork, and vegetables. It was a little bland, but nothing a little soy sauce and chili garlic sauce couldn't fix!

The shrimp chow mein was also very tasty. I've had better shrimp in my life but it wasn't bad.

The general chicken is BOMB. Sweet and spicy.

I've seen this place a few times when I would go to the 99 cent store next door to stock up on some snacks; today I finally cured my curiosity and went in as I was craving some chow mein.
At first I was expecting a Panda style Chinese fast food place where the items are already made and kept in a warmer.
Not this place, everything is made fresh to order.

I was the only customer at that time and as soon as I got in I was greeted and was sat at a table.
Basically this place is like a Chinese restaurant in a fast food form.
You had your lunch specials but I was cruising through the menu and saw that they actually had a wide selection of food including chow fun.

I order the orange chicken lunch special, which comes with soup and wontons chips. The soup is egg flower with bits of corn which was mediocre but it's egg flower, nothing is special about egg flower soup.
Immediately as the soup came out my entree came out.

I went for the orange chicken first and man was it hot! I wasn't thinking I guess, but the good thing was that it was crispy. I would say that their orange chicken is the best that I've had so far that's Chinese fast food.
The fried rice was great as well, wasn't salty, wasn't plain, it was just right. Now the chow mein, it looked like linguine noodles and was just weirded out by that, and when I tasted it, it was definitely different, I've never had chow mein that tasted like that. It was okay-good, maybe because I was knocked back by what I was expecting the taste to be.

What shocked me now was the price, for the lunch combo and a soda, my total came out to $8.38! I didn't even get to finish the whole thing and immediately as I started working on it I was full. I've been eating the leftovers throughout the day and would've been the only meal I purchased had I not gone out to dinner with my girlfriend.

I recommend this place if you would like to have more money for gambling but still have food to eat throughout the day.",AX1_WeMZWLcHlpWjyOMWhA,0,0,3,3N0dz6qUpV7_s8bOMMoyNw

2339070,2008-06-04,1,Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA,"Well, I was craving Korean and we wanted to try somewhere closer to our house. I guess this experience was ""my bad""...but hey, someone had to try it right? As Kevin says, ""It filled our tummies"" and I must agree 100%.  The food was ""eh""....okay.  I guess because we were hungry!  We definitely had waaaaay better Korean food.  (Stay tuned for my next review of it).  

The outside actually looked pretty good.  Yes, quite opposite from other restaurants we go to (Hmmm...interesting...).  We went on a Tuesday about 430pm so it wasn't crowded at all.  There was just one other person sitting there,  The lady that 'somewhat' greeted us looked like she was one of the owners. I say 'somewhat' because she was distracted with her Korean shows that was blaring from the TV situated in the middle of the restaurant,  She was in front of that TV every chance she got.

We played it safe and ordered the bulgogi and chicken.  The dishes were $14.95 each,  They only had the ""cooking"" menu open at that time so we didn't have much of a choice.  They had soups and other appetizers but we opt not to have any.  I really wanted to try the seafood pancake but it was $16.95 (pretty steep for me).  There lunch special prices looked okay ranging $8.00-9.00 but that ended at 230pm. 

When the dishes came out on a cast iron sizzling plates it didn't quite excite us. It came sizzling with just onions! The meat was soft but it definitely needed more flavor.  Same goes with the chicken (mind you, they used the chicken breast. I'm used to thighs.)

Now, let's talk about the ""sides"" given.  They gave about 6 side dishes.  One was a huge bowl of salad which consisted of just greens and the dressing was a simple rice vinegar/soy sauce with a bit of spice.  The other sides were the usual kimchee stuff but they didn't give much.  We actually had to ask for more.  One last thing, my husband being in the food industry business would always tip 20% regardless.  But I have to tell you that it's a big statement when he only tipped 15% at this place!!!

2746784,2015-12-05,1,Xl70366GI5Qao-ORQYCofA,"Hungry as heck last night, I found the closest place to eat in my general area and went for it. I entered the quaint establishment China One and was promptly asked ""for here or to go."" ""For Here,"" I replied. A young girl motioned me to sit down at the booth closest to the door and take a seat. I was handed a menu and asked my beverage order. It took a couple seconds for me to decide on unsweet ice tea. I swear she was faster giving me the tea than it took for me to order it.

Since this was an Asian restaurant, I already had an idea of what I wanted and made the quick decision of General's Chicken. No not General Tsao's Chicken, just General's Chicken according to the menu. 

I went to wash my hands in the bathroom and came back to see that my food was being served to my table. All of this took less than 10 minutes, where I arrived, placed my order, and got my food. It is important to note that their were 3 additional parties dining during this time.  So up until this point, everything was good.

However, when I got my food, I was not impressed with the quality of the chicken. It was breaded to a crisp making it hard to chew. Some pieces were inedible because of it's toughness. I could barely stab my fork into the chicken to break the breading seal. The egg roll served with my dinner should have been called a cabbage roll because that's almost all it was filled with. On a side note, the food was hot and presented at the perfect temperature.

So 0.2 miles from my location I spot this place. I didn't check the review of this place so I didn't know what to expect.

I enter inside a nice small place very clean. I was greeted by a young woman who took my order. She was nice and offer a to go plate so I can eat out of the box if I don't finish my food. I went to the bathroom and 2 minutes later my food was all ready for me.

I ordered the mongolian beef lunch special it came with half chow mien & half plain fried rice,soup & wontons. Took a bite of each item. I gotta say it tastes great. I love the spicy beef the  and peppers the rice is good it just simple rice. Then the chow mien is plain too but I really like the fettuccine noodles. Plus I order a drink it was a big huge cup.

Overall this is a great place to go to have some great Chinese food without spending a lot of money. I would love to come here again to try other items on thier menu.",aQu4BBfKhHTzt-dquWWunQ,2,2,5,P_u3WGuG4xw1e0CksWiqxw
