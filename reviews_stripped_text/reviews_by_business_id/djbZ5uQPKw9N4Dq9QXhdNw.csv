Ordered a shot ski and it was about half a shot and tasted watered down. I half jokingly told the waitress that it wasn't a shot and it was weak, she immediately sicked the manager on me, manager said she would send me a free shot. The shot ended up being on the bill later.  Next, the burger I got was about as thin as mcdonalds makes them. It was $15 btw. When it was time to get the bill, my  (not free) shot was on someone else's ticket. After the shot ski thing the waitress was a total bitch.

60930,2015-01-28,1,djbZ5uQPKw9N4Dq9QXhdNw,"DON'T BUY THE SOUVENIR MUG!  

Contrary to what they tell you, other locations will not honor it for use/refill. 

Long story short, I bought the frozen mug because the server said that other locations would fill it for the ""man beer"" price and you would get a few ounces more as it is a tad bit bigger than the standard glass mug. For the $20 bucks I thought that would be cool. 

Look it to my local AZ location. Received a few comments from others at the bar and had a few folks interested in checking out the vegas location on their next trip. Bar tender filled it up when I explained what/where it was from. Having fun so far, glad I bought it. 

After enjoying my beer and burger, asked for a refill. Was told that she couldn't because the manager said no. 

Not her fault. I was upset that the manager didn't tell me himself (lame to make tipped staff give bad news; what if I was not a cool guy and took it out on her tip?) and that the vegas store either lied to me or their corporate does a horrible job of communicating what these mugs are to the non-vegas locations. 

I emailed corporate so I'll update this if they respond. In the interim, as cool as the mug is (good quality, stays cold forever), don't buy it unless you don't care about using it locally (ie outside vegas). 

Oh, the food was awesome as always and the server was attentive, important in Vegas. One star because of the mug fiasco.",3yQdZSaJyuOfhhpLZiPB0w,2,0,1,gZ9VQkw0KGyL966pdVGkGw

We came back on another day, second chance.  This time we were seated and our waitress was friendly and very helpful with the menu.  The other waitresses seemed to have an attitude.  The food was good but I later had an upset stomach from the chili.

I like the ambiance is a nice sports bar, so for games is perfect it has tvs on every booth also which I think is pretty cool.

Food 1 star:
Food was literally disgusting, sorry to say that I never like the term but someone in the back has to review the recipes.
Got a fried chicken steak that was the size of 2 plates. Was extremely thin and over fried, I woke up this morning with a stomach ache for having eaten 3 bites, tasted burned and not meat flavor. The mashed potatoes were on the button of it and I couldn't get to it because was cover from that giant thing.
My gf got chicken tender and she said said thing weren't good. They were pale and soggy from oil so she ate only the fries.

Service 3 star:
The girls at the bar were nice but a little inattentive. I didn't order extra beer just because no one asked me if I wanted more after I finished. I tried to get their attention, got pissed after waving several times so in the end when they finally came over I just asked for the bill, I didn't wanna take the chance to spend another 15 min just for the check. The girls seemed busy but the bar twas half empty.

While the restaurant does have awesome strip views to people watch, that's not what I meant by view. I meant the smoking hot ladies. That's why the fellas keep comin' back even though the food is terrible.

I finally experienced it for myself before catching a concert at Cosmo. We came in for beers and shared the mozzarella sticks and nachos. The guys have tried most everything and declare these most edible. The nachos are huge. They're decent, but I didn't care for the sweet bbq sauce and the quality overall was pretty cheap. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good. I'd get them again. Lightly breaded thick gooey cheese and a decent marinara sauce for dipping. The real winner here is the beer. We all had the manly sized dirty blondes. It's served at 29-degrees and you'll get ice crystals your first few sips. Not all beer is good so cold, but this hits the spot.

The ladies weren't as friendly to me as to the guys I was with, but they know who their target audience is. They are well trained to part men with their money. I could do without the sales pitch for golf gear, tshirts and whatnot. Just bring my beer and make it quick. Unfortunately, the bartenders were painfully slow on my visit.

(I know, Vegas is too close to Cali for my own good)  Of course, Sara has become my favorite all time waitress. She always treats us as if we are her only table.  Very personable, very attentive and quick to refill our beers...  She even taught me how to climb the 3 story wall and feel like a stud. Of course until the last time I went and she challenged me to a race up the wall. That girl is strong and swift too!

I can't count how many times I have returned to see Sara,  only to find the whole restaurant is spectacular... The best place to watch sporting events from NFL and College sports to the UFC.  Go early, get a seat, and enjoy some of the best beers in town...

You close down the area of your restaurant with a view of the strip unless it is Friday or Saturday, you charge $10 for a beer.  It was from San Francisco Bay Area....not even local.  No such thing as happy hour here.

Your recommended mozzarella a sticks were limp and flat, both in taste and appearance.   I was about ready to leave and then a strange thing happened.....you changed shifts.  I got here just around 5.  Once the dinner crowd workers and customers started coming in, I disliked you less.

You started climbing walls, and shaming grown men.....but so did 15 year old boys.

I decided to put your faults behind us all, an give you another go.  At the suggestion of another customer, not you staff, I tried the trout.  Oh my goodness, that was pretty darn good.  Having caught a trout myself last week and cooking it, yours was better.

The beer temp fluctuated between 27. Something and 32 degrees.  I'm happy to see your beer temps did not fall too low, for too long, to separate the ingredients.


As the night went on, I almost enjoyed myself....until I discovered my siphoned wallet, but that is Vegas, not you.

We spent the next 1.5 hours wondering how our wager was unfolding.  By 5PM a line for the UFC section was forming.  Everyone in line spent the next 25 minutes watching two employees struggle to detach perforated wristbands from a large sheet -- stockpiling more than the occupancy load I'm sure.

Once we were seated in the UFC section things went better.  The atmosphere was simply great, service was friendly and our beer was always refilled promptly.  5 star service.  

My thoughts on food are like many other yelpers.  Each person at the table pushed their plates away stating food wasn't tasty enough to justify consuming the calories.  1 star food.  

Following the event we walked out to the balcony.  I'd pay more than $15 just to enjoy the balcony alone.  Very roomy and comfortable with a wonderful view of strip.  5 star atmosphere.  

I'll pass on this place and  return to Sapphire Gentleman's Club for the next UFC event.  Sapphire is also close to strip hotels, organized, admits people on-time, has its own UFC section, seating and food is readily available, servers are friendly and when the event is over patrons walk into a lounge with another great atmosphere.",c1heytWKPHtMBMYJ0lTJvg,2,1,2,xB6CmLqA32xmr-LoqjJmKQ

However, the negatives outweighed the positives:

1. Volume on the speaker above our table for the football game was at airplane-takeoff decibel levels and didn't appear to be adjustable.

2. When our 2 beers arrived, the server gal had 3 beers in her hands and was confused about which might be our two, as all pretty much looked alike. So, we will never know what it was we were actually drinking.

3. Our waitress was prompt in taking our order and we were very specific that my husband wanted NO ONIONS on his burger. She understood and repeated it and appeared to comprehend it just fine. However, when the burgers arrived, his had the carmelized onions on it (which blend in with the melted cheese, so you can't just pick them off without removing all of the cheese). Luckily, I stopped him from taking a bite as he is allergic to onions. The waitress should have checked to see that she was picking up the correct order (same as with the beer, but that was a different gal), or that the kitchen had actually made a burger without the carmelized onions. He sent it back and decided he would eat elsewhere rather than chance what would come out of the kitchen.

My burger was delicious - but I'm not allergic to onions.

They were gracious about not charging for the burger mistake, and all of the servers were upbeat and cheery, but we won't be going back.",gD0UqxUEFdkUm-hcLbAj_Q,0,0,2,z8caJBR--__E7xa0uB76Tg

I booked our dinner here for a bachelor party of 14 people two months in advance and coordinated with their sales and marketing manager, Kristy Mendenhall.  She provided a contract which I signed to finalize our reservation and I stayed in contact with her up until the event to make sure we were good...

One month out, they made a minor change and kicked us from our reserved ""man cave"" onto main-floor seating.

The night of the even we showed up 15 minutes prior to our scheduled arrival time. We didn't even make it in the front door because of their unprofessional and dismissive security guard who refused to listen to me. Eventually, the general manager opened the front door and I told him about our reservations. The manager said he would have to check but never came back. We went elsewhere to eat that night.

In summary: We signed a contract two months in advance! 14 people drove from out of state for this event and never even got in the door!

I even gave them the opportunity to make up for the mistake before taking it further and writing any review.  Kristy Mendenhall apologized and said she would send gift certificates to make up for the mistake. She told me this three months ago, and still NO gift certificates have arrived. Stay away if you are planning an event here!

The good news, is after we were turned down at the door, we walked down the escalator to PBR Rock Bar & Grill, where they were happy to accommodate us and provided excellent customer service.",wzBECiSjnGvGYLUxMzcmoA,14,2,1,K10_QZGMGNoOQcKtGXemHg

One of the waitresses, I wish I caught her name told me to try the Hangover Burger - she read my mind as I had spent the night prior drinking (hey it's Vegas) and needed to recover for another night of fun. 

Our waitress, Natasha I believe - sorry I was a bit distracted :-) - was super awesome. She kept coming back to chat with us and we had some pretty amazing conversation, not to mention that she also pointed out some cool nightlife spots along the Strip. She was very attentive, brought our food out fast and made sure we were well taken care of. She was even nice enough to pose for a pic with me...a great birthday gift. :-) So if you're in town and go to Twin Peaks I highly recommend asking for Natasha, she's quite awesome...and beautiful. :-)

We were stuffed from the awesome meal but my only regret was not coming back to try the Blondie Brownie...it looked so good! Anyway Twin Peaks offered great food and great service making it for a very memorable birthday for me.

We got our shrimp blackened and our tenders fried. Both were very good. We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese which was just ok. It was kind of cold and the cheese sauce was all the way at the bottom leaving many of the top noodles without cheese. It was loaded with bacon on top so we didn't complain. For what the food and beverages cost, this restaurant was just ok. We paid $61 for lunch. Beers are $10.99 each and I got a small bud light for $5.49. I guess center strip Vegas is expensive but it just seemed high for what we got. Premium location on the Las Vegas strip yields premium prices.

Meanwhile, this location stands taller than it's peers when it comes to looks. The ladies here are far prettier than many of their sister locations, and we've been to more than half of them after sporting events when most regular restaurants are closed. (And, remember, this one has a climbing wall, which none of the other have. You can challenge your server and race them to the top. In fact, they'll even bet you they can beat you and likely take your money.) I had a few clients want to come here to watch a few games and we witnessed one girl beat about 10 guys (and make about an extra $100!). 

You came here for the food, right? Not to hear about the scenery. Wrong. This is a glorified Hooters, with better looking girls, better food, better outfits and better service and in most cases better TVs. It's actually a good place to come watch sporting events. You know you didn't come here for the food. 

On the other hand, the food isn't bad. It's much better than you'd expect at competitors. In fact, they prep it each morning and it shows in the taste. If you have to eat at a sports bar, this is one of the better ones to chow down at. There's ample beer and liquor. The difference is the wing selection, which rests below what you're used to.

And especially in Vegas, it seems appropriate to visit one of these establishments. Yes, I came with the wife, but she happily agreed. I think it was her tummy talking because she was about to eat a shoe off the Las Vegas strip she was so hungry.

We kinda stumbled on this place. For a late Friday night, it was surprisingly empty. Good for us, I guess. We get seated by the hostess, and keep in mind, it's my first time at a TP.  The girls here wear some insanely short shorts. Like, they had to cut the legs of shorts that were already labeled as Jeezus jean shorts. I mean, these were cut higher than bikinis. I ain't complaining. Nice views, and even the wife's jaw was dropping. Yeah, I got a cool wife.

We ordered a cheeseburger, a dozen classic breaded wings, fries, and a house brew.  The beer was actually pretty good, but I got the big 22 oz, and couldn'd finish it because I just had too much food in me. The burger was actually good. I mean don't expect a great burger, but for late night after club food, this burger hits the spot. But the surprise were the wings. The wings were excellent. Perfect ratio of breading to actual meat. Not so spicy, but spicy enough. Very good. Fries were fries.  Girls were running around. It seems they were understaffed, but the bar girls served as our waitress as well.

It came with fries and asparagus, I should have asked for mashed potatoes instead I was not feeling fries; but the asparagus had a great texture and flavor.

Granted, I was going for a bear and to see beautiful women with large breast. Not a high water mark to meet, but they didn't.

The place had no energy, the staff only as much charm as needed before they turned back to convo they were having with the other girls in the corner. They all looked like they hated being at work and they were completely bored. 

The appetizer platter was ok and the beer cold, but it was Friday happy and it was LAME.

Well, normally I would agree, but after 2 days of spending lots of money and walking all up and down the strip, we just needed half a day just to relax. 

We walked into Twin Peaks around noon on a Sunday and it was pretty sparse as to be expected on a Sunday without football. That worked out great since our waitress sat us down in a booth, giving us ample room for our drinks (those bigass 32 oz. icy mugs) and get our draft going. 

The food at Twin Peaks is as you would expect, pretty solid sports bar food (I went with the wings). Our Waitress Andrea was awesome, she had a great sense of humor and came back frequently to check on our drinks and any requests we had.

2012924,2013-06-23,0,djbZ5uQPKw9N4Dq9QXhdNw,"I'd like to give it more than 3 stars but...

We ended up going to Twin Peaks twice in our recent stay in Las Vegas (the first to watch the Tigers and have a few beers before we went to play in a poker tournament, I came in 2nd in that one :) the second at the end of a late night).  

I've described the bar to a friend as ""Hooters except Awesome"".  

The positives:  The bar has a number of TV screens on each side of the bar that you should be able to catch a game that interests you (in addition one screen plays an internal channel that shows various funny ""catch on tape"" incidents as well as various profiles of attractive Twin Peaks girls in-between).  The beer is advertised as coming out below freezing (with a nice little electronic sign showing the temperature that the beer is coming out at) which worked well.  Considering that the attraction is pretty much T&A I have to say that the bartenders we had each night were very, very good with the customer service.  In addition, craft beer fans, the company apparently makes at least 2 of its own beers, which are choices (""The Dirty Blonde"" which is like a Summer or Hefe, and the ""Naughty Brunette"" which is a darker beer, I liked the darker better).  Also, its kind of neat but they do have rock climbing walls on one side of the bar and you can have Twin Peaks girls cheering you on as you climb (no, I've never climbed them, still thought it worth mentioning)

The negatives:  $10 a beer?  Serious sticker shock.

I can't tell you about the food as we used this as a sports bar to watch the Tigers and have a good time at either the beginning or the end of the night.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I apparently can't rate it 3.5 and its a better time than 3 stars.  Would I go again?  Yeah, because this is a pretty good place to watch sports in Las Vegas and this was actually the second best time I had as a nightspot on my vacation.

This place is located on the recent upper level construction that is on the side of Planet Hollywood with the Evening Call, Bubba Gump Shrimp, Eli Roth's haunted house along with others and is not (as far as I know) accessible from inside the Casino itself.

There are tons of windows facing the strip.  There are side balconies and rooms for private parties.  All told, this place is great for watching a game, watching the strip, or just watching the staff.

To be fair, I did not have any food.  I only had some beer - their Blonde beer which is basically blue moon.  The taps have a temperature gauge on them to tell you how cold the beer is - proven by the mini icebergs floating in the mug.  The girl-size beer is a joke, dont even bother.

Our waitress was very pleasant.  She laughed and joked with us, and generally didnt seem phased that she was dressed like the trampy younger sister of Paul Bunyan.  Overall this place looks like it could be a lot of fun to catch a game.  The food smelled good, although strip-priced.

The restaurant has 3 floors complete with a rock climbing wall that spans all 3 of those floors. The 3rd floor has comfy booths with individual TVs as well as outdoor patio seating with great views of the Strip. Every floor has a bar and plenty of TVs and projector screens located throughout.

During the party we tried various appetizers including 4 different flavors of wings, sliders, mini hot dogs, and nachos. My table enjoyed plenty of Stellas, Coors Light and Bud Light in large ice chilled 29 degree mugs which was awesome, but also made it more difficult to chug lol.

Having only been to Twin Peaks in Texas where this franchise is a dining staple, I was pretty impressed with this one, especially with how large and spacious the venue is and the speed of service given how packed it was when we were there.

     The 18 piece buffalo wings was cooked well. The different kinds of sauces mixed well with each other.

3108166,2018-06-06,0,djbZ5uQPKw9N4Dq9QXhdNw,"The corporate hierarchy in Addison, Texas is working hard to ruin the chain.
The bean counters are nitpicking pennies by forcing the bartenders to intentionally under-fill the beer glasses and put more ice into the mixed drinks to cut back on the ""expensive"" ingredients.
The corporate lawyers are overreacting to a single bogus sexual harassment claim by one of the money-seeking waitresses to impose stringent restrictions on the behavior of everyone else in the whole chain.
Now, the rule has come down from the top that no customer is allowed more than two drinks.  (Do I really want to come watch my favorite team only for as long as it takes me to drink two beers??)
All of this puts the restaurant managers in a real squeeze.  As a group, they are all about trying to satisfy the customers and maximize profits, but the corporate rules turn them into unreasonable automatons in the eyes of customers and employees.
Twin Peaks used to be a really fun place to enjoy cold beer, good food, and the game of your choice.  More recently, it has turned into continuous arguments between the customers, the waitresses, and management.
Is this really the way that the big boys in Addison want it to be?

I really was so disappointed with my most recent first visit with friends this weekend. When we arrived first of all there was not a person in sight at the door welcoming or even directing where you can go to be helped. My friends and I decided to head up the stairs and just so happened to run into one of the waitresses who said we could sit wherever we wanted and that somebody would be right with us. Direction as followed we were eventually greeted by a waitress who took our drink orders and then disappeared... About 15 minutes later she showed back up with our waters and took the first order which was the mozzarella cheese bites as an appetizer. 

After placing this order about 20 minutes later the appetizer came out and we then placed our order for the 18pc lemon pepper wings with a side of French fries.. It took no lie about 45 minutes for them to arrive. To my terrible surprise, as I took my fork to scoop fries onto my plate there was a long piece of black hair that came out right along with the fries attached to one of the pieces of chicken! Yuck! .. Just great.. At this point everybody was extremely frustrated and the fact that these wings came out with hair on them they weren't even hot. You can tell that they had been sitting and clearly weren't fresh. 

I mean c'mon now if you are going to have people wait that long for their food at least bring it out piping fresh. I was extremely disappointed with the lack of care from the waitress because when we brought this to her attention she was super nonchalant about the whole situation and just shrugged it off like "" oh well this happens all the time"" kind of attitude.. With that being said we paid for the cheese bites and left as fast as we could... this was crazy and so unexpected because I actually had a great experience in one of their locations in Atlanta, GA and sad to say that my own city couldn't even deliver just as well....",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,5,1,1,9fwfcTgvoC1Oswm0b90sjg

I ordered the chicken and shrimp basket and asked my chicken be tossed in their green chile parsesan sauce.  Kathiee was so great that when my food arrived, she made sure my chicken was tossed in their wonderfully delicious green chile parmesan sauce.  This level of attention to detail really meant a lot (the waitress at the Henderson location just gave me a cold side of green chile parmesan and forgot, or didn't care, I wanted my chicken tossed in that sauce).  So great job Kathiee!!!  Not to be forgotten, the shrimp in my basket were huge!!!  

At this particular location, I have had the green chile meatloaf and the chicken and shrimp basket.  Both items were very good.  The meatloaf is smothered in mushrooms, onions, and gravy, but the green chile in the meatloaf adds a unique and delicious kick that I can't get over.  I would have to rate it the best meatloaf I have had.  

 I believe I saw 12 beers on tap from Coor's Light to an IPA to their very own house brews.  I've had both the Knotty Brunette and Dirty Blonde house beers.  The Knotty Brunette tastes like a good brown ale while the Dirty Blonde is a nice Hefeweizen.  Both are worth a try.  

On both my visits, the staff and service was good.  Everyone was friendly and food came out quickly.  Not to mention it is bikini week, so that is definitely an added bonus.  But if you happen to be there when Kathiee is working, definitely hangout at her bar.  Not only is she a great bartender, she is a huge foodie and is a big fan of yelp!!!",1JEXL5K6VTx01tAs6Jskkg,0,2,5,91LK3pWaXsFE3_DvPaPfFA

I already had high expectations because some friends had been here shortly after opening and the group of guys had a blast.  Personally, I've never been a fan of the gimmicky-restaurant (Hard Rock, Planet Hollywood, Hooters, etc), so I wasn't expecting more than gratuitous T&A with barely-edible food.  I'd much rather go to a hole-in-the-wall dive that has great food and great service.   

But then there's Twin Peaks...

We went today for lunch and had a little trouble finding the restaurant...at least the parking.  Twin Peaks is located on the 2nd floor of a building on Harmon & Las Vegas Blvd - right across from Aria.  We ended up parking in Planet Hollywood Casino and walking over.  Not sure whether that's the best option, but I don't believe they have their own parking.

Once we arrived, we were greeted by a few beautiful girls in short-shorts and tiny plaid shirts.  The girls had big smiles and sat us in the awesome patio that overlooks the strip.

We probably had 7-8 different servers (all beautiful girls) stop by our table when walking by, greeting us with smiles, and asking how we were.  The service here was probably the best service I've experienced in years.  No joke.  It could've been 7-8 ugly dudes and it still would've been outstanding service.  The fact that it happened to be a bunch of beautiful ladies...well that's just bonus!!

The food was great as well.  We enjoyed the Blackened Fish Tacos, Buffalo Wings, Steak Sliders, and Smokehouse Burger.  Good portions and delicious food at reasonable prices.  

Interestingly there were many groups of ladies who came to the restaurant, which is great because it's not a dude-fest.  

I will be back for the food, for the atmosphere, and for the beautiful view!!!  Haha",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,5,2,5,q2Py5Kk-ki1eXtTpkinDZg

The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived but we did not have to wait at all. The service was decently fast and nice. The restaurant is located right on the Strip, which makes it a great stop if you're planning a party night. Unfortunately, the restaurant does not offer parking but you can easily park at one of the casino's nearby. 

We share the combo basket and we chose to have the shrimp, chicken, and catfish fried. Even though it was very unhealthy, it was also pretty good for a bar chain meal. It's a pretty great deal if you can share it with someone else. This meal also came with fries which means that we weren't hungry afterwards. 

The good thing about this place is its atmosphere and the friendly waitresses. Our waitress in particular was very helpful and friendly.

Overall, my experience with Twin Peaks was very positive and I would recommend it. This is a pretty great sports bar. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",JR7AYVUJ1_Nq36UBW3XHYw,1,0,5,Mg7pzkJ1baWQjxOopq6qXQ

They do have chicken on the menu, so just makes no sense to me, i'm pretty sure people would order it. The pork nachos we had was $12 bucks and lacked a decent amount of pork, piled high with nachos and very , very messy to eat as the nachos keep falling off the tiny plate they serve it on. The burgers and fries are good. Overall a great place to get a beer, eat a burger and watch sports. They just really need to add a better variety of food to the menu. For an outdoor themed restaurant, with all the damn stuffed deer and moose heads mounted to the wall, they should at least offer a rib entree?.

They have a thermostat that shows you exactly how cold the beer is at the time. 

This last Vegas trip was the first time I ever had anything to eat there other than the Chicken tender basket. I had the chicken and shrimp and it was probably my favorite meal in Vegas.

I would love to know. 

The girls here are super nice. I was eating at a table with my friends and when my friends left....she let me move over to the bar to watch the game. There were these 2 twins working the bar that were super hot. Yeah they most def got a tip lol.

Why can't they just have like a double bbq bacon burger or something. To be fair my friends loved their burgers. I just stick to my chicken and shrimp though. 

Every guy in Vegas should come to twin peaks at least once. Check out the man size Dos equis with 2 limes. It's so damn good.",gTXm49OTYsy46UAQjotXvA,4,1,5,oMtmudaS0qASdboR_LHmmw

As for the service, we were tended to this year by Yasmine on one day and Nicoley on the next. Both were attentive and friendly (in addition to being gorgeous). These gals hustled and seemingly took good care of all of their tables. One of the Managers we encountered previously (Miller) was there again this year. He too seems customer service oriented and is often visible on the floor (vs. hiding in the back or tapping away on his phone). Real good guy.

As for the food, I noticed a few new items on the menu. I especially enjoyed the smoked and grilled wings and spicy chipotle chicken. The burgers I've had there are comparable to elsewhere. The kitchen got our orders out in a reasonable period of time, despite being busy. I've seen some places struggle with this.

Please note that this location usually has a $45-$50/person minimum during NFL playoff season, per game. I noticed many folks walk in & right back our because of this. Funny thing though, most folks will easily toss down 3-4 beers a game and a plate of food. Guess what, you just hit their minimum without realizing it.

She was obviously inexperienced and this might be why she had no clue that people like me tip 20-30%. Oh well. The drinks were decent (the one round we got). The food was CRAP. We were stuck there for almost an hour for a couple bad sandwiches and one round because we were ignored. We had plenty of time to look around and found that this place will not last very long. The waitresses are not that good looking. Half of them were just in bras and no uniform. And if you call a place twin peaks, you expect to see something. Nope.

Our server was quite friendly, we ordered appetizers, which arrived before we even ordered our entrees, about 10-15 minutes later. We had nachos, and a (SMALL!) cup of the venison chili for appetizers, very nice. For entrees we ordered the pulled pork sliders and a poblano chicken sandwich with fries. The chicken sandwich fell apart as I ate it. It seemed to be possessed by a McDonalds hamburger. One bite and everything wanted to fall out of the far side. Our server at this point seemed to disappear. When finished eating and waited a good 10-15 minutes for her to return with our check.

So much so that I asked forvher when I returned the next day. Had the fish tacos, they were awesome. Enjoyed their Dirty Blond beer. Such a positive experience I came back the next day.

Next day was a college football Saturday. Girls looked cute in their (abbreviated) favorite team jerseys. When I was informed Sierra wasn't working at the time I decided to sit at the 3rd floor bar. Good choice, awesome view of the Strip. Fun atmosphere with all the key games on TV. Although it was quite busy received great service from bartenders Megan and Ellen. Chatted with a couple of the regulars and downed several of the Dirty Blonds.

Both visits were a big improvement from my May visit. Just goes to show, a lot of the make/break of a visit comes down to your server or bartender. Definitely looking forward to stopping by my next time in Vegas.

We were seated and ordered. I had an ice cold 29.345738459 degree beer. It was like a frozen coke AKA shit. Half way through it I was wishing that I had taken the coke sample. I had the smoke house burger. It was acceptable. The fun part of Twin Peaks is the interaction with the waitresses. They are obviously forced to talk to the customers and they stand over you awkwardly while you are eating. We took this opportunity to tell the waitress that cheese was illegal in New Zealand (where i'm from) and that I am the number one importer of illegal cheese in New Zealand. I then told her i'm the Al Capone of cheese. She then went and told all the other waitresses. Hilarious. 

Bathrooms are clean. Lots of TV's, lots of sports.

The following day my bowel movement was smooth. Didn't hurt and their was no blood so that's a win for Twin Peaks as far as i'm concerned.

As far as the food goes, I had the hangover burger and it was just okay... the fries come seasoned similar to Red Robin. I paid $20 for a ""32 oz."" beer that came in a cool souvenir cup, but was very disappointed to reuse it later and discover a 24 oz. tall can fills the same cup up! Tina was either mistaken when she told me it was a 32 oz. ""Vegas size,"" (I forgive her) or they're cheating people out of 8 oz. of beer, which would be wrong. There's no way to really know, since it's not listed on the menu, but explained by the waitress. Those beers are served at 29 degrees too, which I liked, but one of my buddy's didn't since his kind of slushed up.

The girls were dressed super skanky, but they were all very sweet. There were sports games playing on multiple screens throughout the place. I know nothing about sports, but one of the TVs had some crazy ice race thing going on, so that was nuts and moderately interesting for a minute. You might hear classic rock playing, but it's not so loud that you can't hear your friends. It's a decent enough place to chill for a beat.

Whatever you do, watch the Twin Peaks promotional videos. They're really funny.

The pricing wasn't bad at all, the service was quick and it was a clean restaurant. Beers were super cold (the glasses were frozen). We got a nice seat in the sun on the balcony with a good view (as good as it could be for the location of the restaurant). 

As a side note, and I'm not counting this against them, there is absolutely NOTHING on the menu for v*gans (asterisking it so it won't show up in searches). It would, of course, be nice if they had something, but nowhere do they claim to have anything, so I can't fault them for it. I ordered chips and salsa because it was the only thing that looked veg.

I was meeting someone and we wanted to decide where to go. He mentioned he didn't want any place really fancy. We also wanted some place on the Strip. It was my first evening in Las Vegas and I normally stop by Shake Shack and In-N-Out at least once during any trip to Las Vegas so those were two of my suggestions along with FatBurger. He mentioned Twin Peaks and asked if I've ever been there. I mentioned that I've never been there BUT I was familiar with the type of place (Hooters type place) and was fine with it in terms of food options and location.

We met inside Planet Hollywood Casino and walked over to Twin Peaks. Upon entering, the place was relatively busy so if we wanted a table, we would have to wait. We decided to eat/drink at the bar. We walked around and found 2 bar stools so we sat down.

We were provided with a menu which I quickly looked at and decided what I wanted. One of the hostesses (but not the ""main"" hostess who served us for the remainder of the evening) asked us if we wanted something to drink. I opted for a large Coors. My friend had a beer as well but decided not to order a large since you told me that he would probably have problems finishing it. She asked us if we wanted a tab and my friend said yes so I also said yes. She asked us for a credit card. Since we were paying separately, we both gave our credit cards. When she returned less than 1 minute later, she gave us our credit cards and put a bill/paper into each of the glasses in front of us. 

Our hostess (Nicole) then showed up and brought our beer. We asked if we could order the food now and she took our orders. I don't remember what my friend ordered but I decided to go with the fish and chips. After Nicole took our orders, my friend told me that service would probably be slow. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait too long for our food orders.

I liked my fish and chips and decided to have another large Coors. The first thing I have to say about the beer is that it is ice cold. It is the coldest draft beer that I've ever had. I mean, there were ice crystals in the beer and even though it wasn't hot outside (after all, it was January in the evening), it really hit the spot. Nicole was very friendly and nice. She also dropped by during our meal and asked if everything was okay with our order.

The hostesses around the bar (including Nicole) were wearing bikinis, winter boots, and some type of fur hats. I'm not sure if this is the standard attire but based on the show ""Undercover Boss"", I was expecting the ""lumberjack"" motif/style.

After finishing, we decided to pay and leave. I decided to pay with cash whereas my friend decided to pay with his credit card that he had used with his tab. He asked Nicole if she needed his card again and she mentioned that it wasn't necessary.

I would have no problems returning here... although 2 days later after we ate at a burger place, my friend did ask me if I wanted to drop by here again for a drink and I mentioned no since I was full and wasn't feeling at 100% during my vacation.",b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,8,6,4,7Fz8t00-vt-O3ks59YoIeA

We started with a beer, and two margaritas. The 22 oz 'MAN SIZE' beer is $9.. the regular pint-glass sized margarita.. was $20. Yeah.. we found that out at the end of the meal. Wasn't a bad margarita, didn't taste like a $20 margarita though. I am aware that balancing the cocktail comes into play, thus not tasting too strong or too weak.. but one shot of tequila in a pint glass makes for a slightly weak, unbalanced margarita. So on to the food. Most prices are $20 and under for entrees.. good sized portions and quality tastes. 

We started with the mini Bratwurst, called the 'AVERAGE JOE'S', I believe. 3 to an order, 3 of us, so good to share for a hungry group as we expected the main course to be filling. It was.   I had Pot Roast, perfect.. hard to mess that up, but if they did it would be a disaster. It was well cooked, not over cooked, and delicious. My two dinner companions had a Pablano Chicken Sandwich and the other, had a burger.. called the 'Twin Burger' . Both were really big sandwiches and both were served with Steak Fries. (I LOVE steak fries.. these were all under-cooked and not crispy.. ) We also ordered two small sides of mac and cheese that had bacon crumbles on them.. very good, nicely al dente.. not soggy and plenty of good cheese. These were like $2 sides are were plenty due to everything else we were eating. 

All in all, if you are there, near Planet Hollywood.. check it out. It's not expensive, nothing to really wow you.. but nothing bad about the food. Filling and good. My only real complaint was the $20 Margaritas. (See Photo)

As I was walking out, a hostess SLAPPED my hand!  I contacted the Manager & their corporate office and both did nothing! In fact, I found out three days after this incident,  the hostess that slapped me was promoted! I wrote an email to the corporate office and never heard back. 
I know you're probably thinking about the other side of the story here, and there is another side, of course...my group did argue back after we were told to leave, mind you we were told to leave for no reason other than a bratty hostess.

My co-worker picked this place to spend his last lunch with the office before moving back to Kansas. This was my first time here, so I had no clue what to expect. First off, the parking was a pain in the ass. We had to fight for a spot at the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile parking lot, then walk 20 minutes (outside, then upstairs) to get to the restaurant. The restaurant had a lumberjack theme, with log furniture, moose heads plaques, fireplaces, and a massive 2-story rock climbing wall. 

We were seated upstairs, overlooking the strip. I looked at the menu and decided to go with the philly cheese steak (rookie move). The servers are very prompt and the food came out fairly quickly. The cheesesteak that I ordered was massive, but it was mostly bread. The meat was seasoned with a pound of oregano, sauteed with mushrooms onions, and covered with more cheese than meat. Needless to say, this wasn't the best cheesesteak I've ever had... not even close. The fries on the other hand was delicious.Crispy, hot, and served with a special seasoning. I looked at my co-worker's foods and most of went with the burgers. They definitely looked amazing, which is probably my go-to next time. 

Overall, it was a good experience. The servers are very friendly and attentive, the bathrooms are clean, the food was okay, and it was an unique atmosphere. There's a ton of TVs on the wall, so I'm pretty sure this is a great place for sporting events. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.",3MpzuK6s93p3pIX2GfZCWg,2,1,3,ZEK3JCqWn2bIwu0vel49UA

If they would put dressing on the salad like a normal place and not be skimpy so they can price gouge you, people would not ask for extra.

The wings were not bad, I had the chili parm sauce which was good but the wings themselves were just ok.  What I mean by that is the quality of the wings they use, there were several pieces that were fatty which tells me they don't go for high quality wings.  

The salad itself was good even though I am 99% sure it was not organic.  This place gets a lot of business because of the staff they higher so the owner/manager is not really concerned about quality.  This place is more about the view anyway.

It's located in a strip mall type set up right next to Planet Hollywood. Once you walk in it's super gimmicky with all the girls dressed in basically a stripper meets a lumberjack type outfit. Can't forget the rock climbing wall either. 

I first got a bad impression after we told the hostess we wanted to sit upstairs and she decided to sit us downstairs in a back corner. Why even ask if you don't take our request? My next bad impression came from the hot salsa that was served with our chips. I've never once in my life had hot salsa and I'm talking temperature hot, not spicy. We asked our waitress if we could get some chilled salsa or just room temp which she said wasn't possible. I'm pretty sure they had to heat it up in the first place so I don't understand why they couldn't cool it down.

My girlfriend and I went to the location on the Strip, adjacent to Planet Hollywood and the Miracle Mile row of shops and restaurants - a top-tier area if you're on the hunt for a bite to eat. You're never out of reach of solid dining options when you hit the Strip; at the time, we were just craving a snack between drinks and I thoroughly believe we came to the right spot!

The service was friendly and hospitable the second we walked through the doors here! The good-looking servers donning a smile gave us tips on the food and drink menus and kept dropping by to see if we were satisfied with our orders. A big central oval bar here means you're never too far from a refreshing pint of cold beer! The girlfriend and I decided on a couple cold brews - the hefeweizen was quite welcome after dealing with the blistering heat outside - and two wing flavours - Jalapeño Butter and Spicy Thai Chili. The Jalapeño Butter wings were coated in a buttery sauce, not too spicy, but just right! The Spicy Thai Chili were our favourites and would be contenders in the top 10 wings I've ever eaten in my life; everyone needs to try this flavour here at least once! 

Despite the restaurant being mostly empty when we went, the few other diners seemed to enjoy their cold brews, big pub-style burgers, and chatting up the servers, who were not only nice to chat with, but also quick and efficient. Of course there are better options nearby - it's Vegas - but give Twin Peaks a shot and I bet you'll leave with a good impression!",63NmoNMOek4R5DX7WA9ffA,0,0,4,dKzYxUZCEDCvrUrXGphmug

He has been to the Twin Peaks location in Chicago before, so of course he had to take me to their Las Vegas location while we were in town. We went around lunchtime on a Sunday and it was busy, but not too busy. We were easily about to get seats at a table in the bar area.

Our server was good, but not very nice or friendly. She kept the drinks coming, but always had a scowl on her face and kept standing at the back of the restaurant with her arms crossed. Not very fun! Some of the other girls had the same attitude, but there were a few good ones.

They have a rock climbing wall inside which I thought was fun to watch. One of the customers and one of the servers decided to climb the wall as we were sitting there and it was fun cheering them on!

We didn't have anything to eat while we were there, but I had their Twin Peaks Dirty Blonde Beer in ""Girl Size"" and I actually thought it was pretty good. Nice and light and had a good flavor! My Husband on the other hand had a few ""Angry Balls"" shots which he really enjoyed.

They have a ton of TVs around the bar showing all different kinds of sports programs which I thought was a great idea because you could always be assured to be able to see the game you wanted to watch.

They were a mini mountain! The chips and queso were great, love the thin chips and the salsa mixed into the queso was a fantastic flavor!
Hubby had chicken fried steak, I had the steak sliders, our friend had the philly cheesesteak. Everything was cooked perfectly and we cleaned our plates!

But noooo.  They insisted on coming here.  I guess I was just the most-sober of the group, and we all paid for it dearly in the end.

6pm, Saturday Evening, Las Vegas strip.  We wanted to watch some football, so we came on in at the insistence of, well, the drunkards.  Cue the confused girl asking how many, then us saying ""4, but another is on his way"" and then her having zero clue what 4+1 is and trying to seat us at a small table.

Next up was a waitress with possibly the worst attitude I have ever encountered.  No smile, no hello, no attempt whatsoever at being a mediocre waitress from the get-go.  Just a silent stare at all of us from start to finish.  Cue beers that took 15 minutes to arrive, appetizers that appeared at the end of the meal, and the staff simply setting plates down in the middle of the table and walking away.
We had asked the hostess, the waitress, then a manager to turn one of the 10 TVs to a different game, all of which said ""okay"", then walked away.  Tried again, ""okay"", then walked away.  A half hour later we asked again, they said they couldn't change the TVs: no reasoning, no angle as to why, just ""no"".

Food was nasty.  Cold burger I barely even tried to eat, wings that tasted like they had been reheated 3 times before ever getting to us, and a queso dip with, well... 1% cheese and chips that were soggy.

Why the heck didn't anyone listen to me?  This was 3 days ago, and we are all still running to the bathroom several times a day to avoid the embarrassment of soiling ourselves.

I'd say this place needs a makeover, but as long as they can hide crappy food, service, and overall lack of anything to do with the service industry behind fake breasts and short shorts, they probably don't care.

For starters, this place is located inside of a ""Mall"" area if I may say?. Sports bar with lots of TV's. Loads of beautiful women. Their beer is advertised to be served at 29 degrees if I'm not mistaken, which is the best! Their beer is served in mugs and they come real cold and icy. They have this temperature-board that let's you know how cold they're serving their beer at. Oh! Can't forget the rock-climbing wall they have indoor as well. They also have an additional upper floor you're more than welcome to hang out at. 

I haven't tried their food, so my review is based off of the beer selections. Will have to update once I try their food.

After hours of walking along the Strip through the morning and early afternoon, my mom and I were exploring happy hour specials for food and drink. We chose Twin Peaks for its view of the buildings along the Strip and its appetizer and drink specials.

The hostess quickly seated us on the balcony as requested, and our server patiently answered any questions we had about the happy hour special. We ordered two appetizers (each 50% off; some appetizers on the menu are excluded from the special): chicken quesadillas and 6-piece buffalo wings. We each ordered a ""girl"" sized beer, also 50% off (~$3 or so). Whether the food was fresh or not, I don't know... but we thought everything was delicious! The beers also came in frozen beer mugs, which kept the beer cool on a hot day. 

If you want to take a break from the Strip and grab a beer and some appetizers, Twin Peaks is a relatively cheap option in the mid- to late-afternoon with a decent view and good food.",798fXIPDD9ivKyHpIBSjZQ,0,0,4,U9SXNH2rnJb-3H-pltlTWg

For the record I know females who enjoy this place as well so it's not all a guy thing. Having said that, there's nothing on this menu that I have not liked. Try the Hangover Burger, in my opinion one of the best burgers I've had hands down. Though make sure you're hungry when you order it. 

Getting to the location is a bit of a challenge, you can drop your car off at the valet on Harmon or park at Planet Hollywood. If you valet on Harmon be sure to pick it up before they close that side at around 10 or 11. Otherwise you'll have to walk to the west PH valet to get it. 

The atmosphere is simply awesome. If you've had a bad day this place will certain help to forget it. They have a decent variety on tap and two house beers. The Dirty Blonde and the Naughty Brunette. The Dirty Blonde is like a summer wheat type beer like Blue Moon. The Notty Brunette is as it implies, nutty and dark like an IPA. They also have what they call a Shotsky which is an actual snow ski rigged with about 5 shots of whatever you order and what they do is line up 5 of you across the ski then they tip the ski and all 5 of you take a shot simultaneously! 

The place has three levels and if you go the third level...the view. What can I say about the view from the third level. BTW, the third level is where it's at!. You can sit on the balcony and soak in wonderful LV BLVD and city center. They have a rock climbing wall that to the inexperienced eye seems easy to negotiate but these TP girls can give you a run for your money. Its certainly entertaining to watch people race up the wall. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is due to the parking situation. Though if you're a glass-half-full kind of a guy like me, you can certainly say that the walk from the parking lot to TP offers a great deal of quality 'people watching'.

*The servers acted like they never served before .

*Customer service is terrible.
*They take your check and card before you even look at the check total.
*And they clean the table and our server checked in front of me on what I tipped!

So now is the second time i went
I brought my fiancé . 
the menu is very limited but we saw something that said ""chicken fried steak or chicken""  I assumed... Due to the conjunction.. It was just a regular chicken breast..
So when it was brought out/ it was fried as well. 
I told the server I thought it wasn't fried. Because of the wording on the menu
And her friend came over with a menu and showed me to my face how it's fried

5727462,2014-01-16,1,djbZ5uQPKw9N4Dq9QXhdNw,"Met some colleagues here.  I've actually never been to a Hooters, but my colleagues tell me the food here is better.  My priority was to get good beer, and this place delivered.  Their two house brews are both good.  They have a hefe (Dirty Blond) which was decent, but my favorite was the Naughty Brunette.  It's an amber and has some nice toasty notes.  The beers come in either a truly massive mug, or a very large, tall stein.  The smaller of the two must still be at least 20oz.  They also have a seasonal Sam Adams and Newcastle on tap, along with the usual crap beers (Bud/Miller type stuff).  Be aware that if you're a beer snob and don't like your beer cold to the point where the head is slushy, this is probably not a good place for you.

The food is typical for this type of place.  I got a grilled chipotle chicken dish that was good, if a little heavily seasoned.  Kind of a small piece of chicken, but the price was reasonable.  My companions reported that the Hangover burger was very good.  The salsa that came with the chips was also really good, with a smoky flavor.

The girls are everywhere at this place, and go out of their way to be friendly, to the point I found them slightly annoying.  We kept having our conversation interrupted by one scantily-clad server or another, trying to initiate idle chit chat.  Some guys may appreciate the attention, but as a married man, I could've done without.

The climbing wall is kind of a cool gimmick, and it's only $10 to try it.  They have 4 routes, but two are super short and should only be done by kids.  The other 2 have an overhanging section and it's fun to watch the drunken attempt to negotiate them.  The gimmick includes a ""race"" with your server, where you climb the wall and then your server climbs it and tries to beat your time.  Actually, they pretty much WILL beat your time, since it's clear they've climbed these routes many, many times.  My colleague, a very fit (and very inebriated) guy climbed the easier overhanging route in 2:34.  His server did it in 1:11, so be prepared to lose the wager your waitress will inevitably make with you.

Parking for locals is kind of a challenge.  There may be a better way to do it, but I parked in the Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile garage, then walked all the way through the Planet Hollywood to get to the restaurant.

All in all, this would be a fun place for a group of guys to go hang out and have good beer and good food.  The waitresses will definitely make sure you have a good time, and it's all good clean fun.  You can definitely do worse on the Strip, and this is a particularly good option if none of the bars/lounges in the Cosmopolitan are doing it for you (which they likely are not if you're reading reviews on Twin Peaks).",wVw3gv1fNdI2_iJIO28L0A,0,0,3,Y6Q2qq2A0aynBEB_zvvdTg

It took 30 minutes to get a water.
No one refilled it.
The food took over an hour and a half to come out.
The burger I ordered was dry and the bacon was cold.
Oh, and my cheese burger didn't have cheese..
I would have sent it back but I didn't want to wait another 4 hours for my food. 
Would not come back.


**edit
I felt the management was awesome when I brought it to their attention and I appreciate how it was handled over all.",vNRw1SLgPUyDlK8WXTYVrw,0,0,1,vLLRqCCAV1-C6L4t4AUPkA

First off, they are a true sport bar with TVs throughout the restaurant. I was quickly greated by the Twin Peaks bartender (her name escapes me) who was very friendly, asked my name and what I would like to drink. I selected Stella Artois which was served cold and in a frosty mug.

Overall, I had a great time and the next time I'm in town, I will be sure to stop by.",IhY66GZIeA9jTjwPRVhpLQ,0,0,5,tt49ZTG4GhVWQQckwG-2Qg

If you want every girl to act like they're in love with you and your very own personal stripper, you might like it. They know what they're doing and how to get big tips from those guys though! It's 3 stories tall which is pretty cool, the view from the top floor overlooking the strip is pretty awesome actually. They also have a random rock climbing wall in the center of the place. Beer is priced sky-high for the ""man-sized"" mug (that's how they get these fools to pay more, because they wouldnt want to order the smaller, less expensive size if it's called ""girl-sized). They also serve the beer on top at 29 degrees or something which is pretty awesome, You get a hint of a beer slushy at the beginning.

This would be a great place to have a drink, watch the game, and hang out with friends... If not for the over the top (not in a good way) service.",BioAFnx1elzi8DLq_Zra3w,2,0,3,lMkS_cnx5oh3llJm_iSOhw

It was pretty good, the sauce gave it a sweet tangy flavor which made this one pretty unique. The bar was lively. Great views from outside too!",5wDlvRymyKtxNDkDtNCjtw,1,2,3,8SA-nguantEbTid4k3vd9w

5950057,2017-03-15,0,djbZ5uQPKw9N4Dq9QXhdNw,I had a great experience there. I asked the hostess if she could accommodate me upstairs and she said it was no problem at all even though I was by myself. I recommend their chicken Cobb salad. The portion is huge but not exaggerated ( I didn't need a doggie bag lol) and the prices are reasonable for a restaurant on the Strip. It looks like they have a big selection of beers too! The service was fast and the waitresses are all young wearing cute little outfits. An eye candy for guys. I will definitely come back again. And try something else too.,wwKQ3KG83TB3va3rUfIbTg,2,2,5,HuL1F-754IiH0_bYtD-n7g

I went up to the bar and ordered the chicken tender and fries ""appetizer"" which turned out to be more than enough food. Besides admiring the friendly tag team of bartenders and their beautiful...smiles...I also enjoyed watching a myriad of games on the bank of TVs set up at the bar. 

Even if I had the time to race one of the staff up the famous indoor rock climbing structure, I need to spend some more time in the gym to get ready for that! LOL

For Vegas purposes, Twin Peaks is a good place to pre-game before a ""naughty"" night out.",kVyOe_qIsGAlk0wo9n9_9g,1,1,4,0IcXTrjVaBO_X1cve-mo2A
