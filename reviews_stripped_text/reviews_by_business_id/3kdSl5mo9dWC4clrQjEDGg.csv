The menu selection is vast (6 pages!) and offers dishes for both vegetarian and non-vegetarians alike.  I ordered the veggie good omelette.  The yummy omelette (I requested mushroom, spinach, and cheddar on mine) came with well-seasoned potatoes and their infamous banana nut muffin.  You must try their banana nut muffin!  It was probably the best banana nut muffin I've ever had and I'm not exaggerating.  It tasted like there was a slight hint of buttermilk in the muffins but whatever this restaurant did to them made them amazzzingggg.  

All the portions sizes are huge and I liked how I could easily substitute items that were orginally in the veggie good omelette to make my order just the way I like it.

28023,2015-07-30,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"At a little before 7am on a Sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  This was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the Vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  Here's the best recommendation I can give about the food: I came back for breakfast the next day!  And we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!

We got off to a good start.  When the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm banana nut muffin to try.  It's a house special and well worth getting.

When you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words Habla Diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  My wife wanted the Spinach Benny, but was concerned about the Habla Diablo potatoes because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  The waitress explained that it wasn't spicy at all, that Habla Diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  My wife went ahead with her spinach benny and I got the loco moco, with an extra side of the Habla Diablo potatoes.  (It turns out that the Habla Diablo seasoning is a lot like Lawry's Seasoned Salt.)

My wife really liked her spinach benny, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (But she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  I liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  Plus the loco moco was the best I've had on the mainland!

The next day, I came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  This time I had the Biscuits & Gravy, which were great.  But, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   Then I picked out the California Crepe for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  I asked to substitute some fruit for the Habla Diablo potatoes, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  My wife loved the California Crepe, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!",LpRQnAJGw8xhH0_6SNUZ7A,0,0,5,abectl3HMSWJUVR84JDiOQ

The good: Service was excellent. I like restaraunts that take a community approach to service. Our server Perry was really good but when he was taking care of another table, other employees were more than happy to help us out. 

Food was excellent. Breakfast is too often ruined by chefs getting too ""fancy"". Here it's just well prepared food with great ingredients. The house sauce and seasoning salt was a highlight. 

The bad: Nothing really jumps out. Hence the five stars.

The omlettes were just OK.. they say they are 4 egg omlettes, but they were on the small side.. looked like 3 egg omlettes.. the omlettes were frikkin caked in CHEESE.. I like cheese but it was too much! The coffee was ok.. they give you a carafe like IHOP. I like that.. you don't have to bug the waitstaff for refills. The potatoes were good.

I also ordered a short stack of pancakes. The pancakes were frikkin delicious and HUGE! I ate half of them.. 

I'd go back again but it will probably be a little while. I'd get the Pancakes again or try something else like French Toast or a Scramble.

89498,2012-04-13,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"My husband got the Lag Egg Crepe, and I got the chicken fried steak. 

My chicken fried steak was too salty and the country gravy itself was too salty too. I felt that I got overdosed with the salt after I've finished only one third of the chicken fried steak. I had my egg scrambled, and the egg didn't taste good, seems like they put white pepper in it and I don't like white pepper. So I was done with the egg with only one bite.

My husband said the egg crepe was interesting enough that he liked it, while it was also too heavy for him as it's made with 4 eggs.

The meal was okay, could be better though. We can get better chicken fried steak (with the right saltiness) at the other diner in town, so probably won't order chicken fried steak ever again at Egg & I. 

I think the best item of the meal was the banana nut muffin, which was only a side that came with the entree.

Our server was very nice though.

We don't know if we would come back again........just because we are not attracted to other menu items so much while we know we are not gonna order chicken fried steak here again.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,3,holTWM2aW3_eRNNwGdfYAA

The corned beef hash comes with ranch potatoes (think Tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. The hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. The ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. I just wish the hash was a bit crispier. Since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. It had good flavor though. 

Lastly, the customer service is top notch. All the waitresses were happy to help and near the end of brunch, the owner/manager came over just to chit chat, which I appreciated.",HEzVlIJeVpwjiNCPXNM-aA,0,0,4,ybcIaswrOibKCJM_mWpmUQ

I was so excited to try it because we're never awake for normal breakfast time. They stop seating people at 3pm, which is when we usually get there. 

The food is great. The chili relleno omelet was amazing. I'm not a fan of the ranch potatoes. I think they are a good filler though. Same about the Banana Nut Muffin. But the meal I dream about is Benedict's Garden. It's a 'vegetarian' version of eggs benedict. English muffin topped with guacamole and tomato, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. it's the greatest thing!

Service is great. Everyone is friendly. Waitresses are attentive but If you need anything, just flip the egg on the condiment caddy.",o9egV9T264-gU0LLUrjPLw,1,1,4,v33SNophbC8aFrxQVnVPVg

Its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. It wasn't even an option for an additional charge.

To be fair, my kids didn't care their Mickey Mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. And the prices for everything were reasonable. While I didn't find their eggs Benedict too salty (I am not salt sensitive), the MSG in the Hollindaise was palpable and the famous Diablo potatoes were ""meh"" (and I like spicy!).

This spot is on point and we couldn't complain about the food at all.  I got the their special corn beef and hash, with two over easy eggs on top and a side of potatoes.  Their corn beef is pulled, not the typical chopped up kind you find most places.  The flavor of this was awesome and the texture was amazing too.  I can still taste it.  On top of that, bust the yolk and it's on!  Wifey had their special banana french toast.  This thing was like a cake, literally.  It didn't have a ""bread"" texture, but it was rather good, something I've never had before and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It came with syrup, which was a waste because the taste in the french toast was just right.

Prices are cheap for what they serve, service is good, can't complain as the server stopped by a couple of times to check on us.  The place is BUSY though, so expect a wait, especially on a weekend morning.

Let's address cons. 

It's off the strip 
It has a decent wait time to be served. Place was packed and it's worth noting but they clean tables and have people seated as fast as possible. 

Pros. 

Food is great. I have paid triple for similar food. And I had the cabo breakfast burrito which is and easy item to mess up. Sause was dryer and baked on so it did not cause the burrito to become soggy. Was crisp without too much grease. 

Great customer service. 

I will be eating here again before I leave is how much I truly enjoyed my self.

237523,2016-02-22,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Average greasy spoon that would make you not hungry, but not worth the trip from the strip.

Service: Excellent
Food: Average to below average
Price: Fair for what you get, but with added costs of having to uber it there and back, it isn't worth it. 

Preliminary: We went on a Monday morning and there was no line and service was great. Other than that, the restaurant was lacking and not worth the trip from the strip. Just FYI, these Egg & I restaurants are independent from one another as I heard the staff tell another customer.

My wife and I went on a Monday morning. The reviews said their would be lines, but we encountered none. 

We got a variety of food. She got coffee, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey ham.  I got OJ, hot tea, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and turkey sausage (they only have patties in turkey sausage).  

She said her coffee was good, the eggs were as expected, but nothing spectacular, and she liked the turkey ham. The pancakes were not cooked all the way through. She ate about 1/3 before she got to the middle to discover the undercooking. The restaurant offered to toss them back on the griddle, but she declined as she wanted to eat my potatoes (which were very good).  They brought out a chocolate muffin to make up for it. It hasn't been eaten yet, but I suspect it's pretty decent. 

As for my food, the potatoes were really good! Like really good.  Well seasoned and smaller and crispy, the way I prefer them to be. My wife liked them as well.  My turkey sausage was  undercooked and cold when served.  If you like hot tea like me, savor your first tea bag, because that's all you'll be getting for the $2.50 it costs to get hot tea. And perhaps it was my mistake for ordering biscuits and gravy; as a southern man, maybe my standards are too high. The meal was reminiscent of what you get at a Holiday Inn continental breakfast in the south. Seriously, no joke, and I feel bad about saying it like that, but it's true. The biscuits were hard and as if they were precooked and then microwaved when the dish was ordered. The gravy was ok, but nothing special. 

Overall, with the cost of breakfast, plus the uber there and back, it would have been just as cheap to do the Bellagio buffet and gotten better food and more options.",wb2weBBPCs5aYBFAFRSfhw,0,0,3,AWZ8ZHhEv1t5EXs-qlubVg

Our waitress was Carol Anne. She was as good as it gets. I asked her what was the best dishes and she suggested the chile relleno omelette. I was glad to hear that as I love green chile and don't get very good ones in Florida. My spouse has the collision which was a cross between a crepe and an omelette. We both ordered potatoes with our entre and a banana muffin. I had seen the muffin delivered to another table. The omelette was awesome the green chile had so much flavor. The collision my spouse had was very good. The banana muffin was the best banana bread or muffin I have ever had. I would go back just for the muffin. Carol Anne was a great server and kept checking with us and took care of us through the whole meal. I noticed on her name tag she had worked there for 4 years and it showed.

Next time, breakfast burrito (looked like 1.5x normal size).

Just about everything comes with Habla Diablo potatoes, which the waitress accurately explained as having seasoning salt, but they've not really spicy or hot.

Restaurant is very clean, has a huge menu (almost entirely breakfast fare), and is very well staffed. Table-to-waitress ratio was very low, and tables are bussed immediately. Tables also have a little placard on a ring that's normally black smiley face, for all is well, or yellow frowny face for service please.

We had a great breakfast with banana-nut muffins, of course!

So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.

The food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried ""bits"" of potatoes - but everything else was great.

This place only serves breakfast & i believe they close at 3pm. The menu looks like a morning's newspaper, they have tons of yummy items to choose from.

Unless they are super busy and most of the time they are so just wait patiently. 

The food portion size is big, I would say that thee portion is adult men's size who is damn hungry in the morning because I never finish and always pack it home.

Came on Monday, June 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by Gia the manager and our waitress, Carole Ann.   They were both very personable.

We we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by Gia.  Carole Ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  No biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  

Gia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  She came out with two banana muffins for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  Those muffins were delicious.  Carole Ann came back and took our order.  I ordered the spam and egg over rice.  That came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin I thought that was it.  But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  

The food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  

They don't take American Express, not sure if it's just at this location. 

Thank you Carole Ann for great customer service, keep it up and I hope you get to meet Mickey Mouse!!!",T2cFrg5mQ5zRsM-ogH2K_w,0,0,5,Wwm8TxD_D321WRHC7q_z9A

The day before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.

Being a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: The place was VERY busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. Food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so I quite took my time to decide. Got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty. 
One more thing about the service: Our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !

A little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. Her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. Later, I found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! When she heard that I failed to order the banana nut muffin (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !

I guess I don't need to say more. Prices very reasonable, yummy food with a lot of variety...wish we had breakfast places like that in Berlin lol.

Since I guess we will return to Las Vegas at some point in our lives I can clearly see us going there again !",P55kxOqIe75Tu71vVOhCyw,0,0,5,AKoJTZ041Pnedx8IZcNWYQ

The skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  It was pretty tasty.  I really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.

There were three different types of Habla Diablo sauce on the table Original, Chipotle, and Verde.  So if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  Well not really since none of them are that spicy.

446284,2016-05-12,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"The food:

Blackened prime rib Benny - prime rib is diced small, mixed with veggies, served over a slice of sourdough with poached egg and hollandaise on top.  Their habla diablo potatoes are  pretty good. Crispy on the outside,  soft on the inside and dry seasoned with a reddish spice mixture that is slightly spicy. 

New York steak and eggs - this is an egg based restaurant that served cold, browned (aka overcooked)  scrambled eggs?! The steak was thin, cold,  and lacking any flavor. Their signature habla diablo potatoes were probably the only really good part of the dish. 

(I know that there is no built in firewall against poorly cooked eggs at an egg based restaurant but c'mon) 

Mimosas:
You're given a small, unopened bottle of champagne turned upside down in a glass Mason jar. A cup of pulpy orange juice is served on the on the side.  I like that you can control the ratio of champagne to orange juice. 

The atmosphere:
Farmhouse chic. Packed with patrons. There is an open air patio in the back (pets allowed). Booths in the middle, tables along the walls. 

The entryway deserves a paragraph to itself.
 One. Big. Clusterf**k. People are waiting to be seated and are either sitting along the walls or standing (most likely in the way of someone). People are lining up to be placed on the seating wait list. People are sitting or standing along the wall just inside the dining room and outside of the front door. People are ordering food to-go. People are lining up or grouping together like a human barricade, waiting to pay their bill. Honestly, even the hostess could not tell me where the line ended to pay the bill. After being one of the few courteous people constantly moving out of others' way, a new line has formed and of course they want to act like you cut them in line.",INHFOcLzPBFAEO9QHbQ6Pw,1,0,3,K04SGx8GrzVRSXWx2Q8loQ

I ordered the Works Skillet. It had peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, ham, bacon, potatoes and eggs. It was off the charts delicious. I also got the banana nut muffin instead of toast, which came out first. It was a very good and if you check-in you get a free banana nut muffin (I got 2nds). Not only was the food good, it came in a timely manner. I can eat a lot and I thought it was plenty of food. A lot of my friends had to take half of their meal to go!

515145,2012-12-06,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"My wife and I visit Vegas at least once a year.  Until I found this place (and others) on Yelp, we used to just have breakfast/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  Meh.

 Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.

To be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.

If you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.

Another smile maker is the super friendly service. Host station, servers and waiter all seem to enjoy their work and sharing pleasantries with their guests. 

Hubs decided on the Three Pigs omelette and I had the chili loco moco. All was yummy. We cashed in our Yelp! check-in bonus for a free banana muffin that was pretty good. I wish we went with a large group so we could have sampled the bacon-maple cream cheese stuffed French toast, waffles and the blueberry cakes. 

My rating would actually rest between 4 and 5 stars. It was their friendliness toward dogs that catapulted them to the top. Loved that they are clear on pet expectations so visitors can bring their furry family members, too.

From the outside, the place looks very unassuming. Not even busy. But right when we opened the door, crowds poured out, and we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table for two. The wall decor by the waiting place was cute. There were cartoons as well as sayings about eggs. Finally, we were led to our table by a super friendly and bubbly waitress.

The menu is printed like a newspaper - cool!! I've never seen that before!! (Yes I took a picture with it.) The selection is pretty extensive considering that every single item on the menu are made with eggs (like skillet items, omelettes, etc), so it took us a while to decide. I forget what we ended up getting - it was a while ago, pardon me - but I remember it being soooo good! They also customize your order so that you can have whole eggs vs egg substitutes vs egg whites, etc... Definitely get the fresh banana nut bread!! We almost got a loaf to take home back to LA even though we weren't leaving for LA yet.

The service was superb. Our waitress kept coming by to check up on us. When the busboy accidentally tossed our leftovers, the waitress felt so bad that she went back to the kitchen and got us some other foods to take with us.

It too 30-40 minutes to get our food. Really? For egg dishes? Our food was cold. I had asked for my eggs basted medium. They came fried, sunny side up. The salsa that came with my wife's huevos rancheros was bland. That was better than my tasteless food. The cream cheese for my bagel was in a small metallic packet. It was so cold I could barely get it out.

Neither of us finished our food. I don't know how anyone could want to. I was still tasting my greasy ""cordon bleu skillet"" breakfast hours later.

Make sure that if you decide to come here that you use yelp and check in to get yourself a banana nut muffin.. The muffin was super light and moist and delicious.

There are so many different things to pick from on the menu.. The menu is super creative.. I got the breakfast burrito and it was the perfect size for my appetite.. The salsa for it was delicious too (I asked for extra).. I left full and ready for the day.

First off, the location is really crappy looking.It almost made me want to find something near the hotel we were staying at. Second,  the food is not that great. It's just big slabs of cheese basically on the omelettes, and there was no flavor. Where's the flavor?! I had a bacon and avocado omelete. It had little bacon bits cooked into the egg, and it was hardly noticeable. The avocado was in a big chunk in the middle. Then it was covered in cheese and had some sour cream on top. Maybe strips of bacon would be better. Then maybe it could be tasted. 
the potatoes are way too salty and taste weird. they definitely seemed like they were frozen. My husband was not impressed with his omelete neither. 

With all the reviews we thought this place would be better. The atmosphere was drab, and the attitudes of the workers was somethin else. Even the manager seemed real fake.",BLoIldyn8G_-D7W_SBxd-Q,1,0,1,qRhmQj9Q7viHhOsVmNgt5g

Our waitress (bummed I don't remember her name) was ridiculously sweet and friendly. She provided great service. The food was delicious. I'm really picky about eggs benedict and theirs did not disappoint. I had the prime rib benny and highly recommend it, came on a croissant. We were planning on ordering a carrot cake to go and when they were out of it they gave us a loaf of carrot cake on the house - it's gestures like that that make all the difference.

1) Crazy Chicken Omelette: very good! The chicken was tender, there was a good ratio of guacamole and mushrooms, and the omelette was smothered in cheese and sour cream. Ranch potatoes on the side were fantastic, as expected.
2) Sausage gravy + sausage patty: a little on the salty side, but I thought it had a good balance of chunkiness and creaminess. I'm a bit of a sausage gravy aficionado (haha) though, so it may be that my standards are oddly high.
3) Banana Nut Muffin: needs it's own category, even if it's a side! Delicious delicious. Moist and warm, not too sweet.

I would come back! The service was great too. Even though we came right at brunch time and the place was packed, there was only a 5 min wait for two.",q0_VVlHoR7aHD9mqLub8ng,0,0,5,VOlfZsIllNlmaNqqONnU2A

The cashier lady made up excuses and said since we ordered our food with muffin (which it should come with toast or muffin) we don't get an extra one with the check-in and that we should save the yelp check in for next time.  Checking in on yelp is one thing and ordering our food that come with an option of toast and muffin is another thing since that is part of the meal that I pay for.  The principle just make no sense.

My brother didn't think it was a good idea so I went back and they had no problem noting we wanted to sit inside. It's busy but people go in and out quick. We waited for about 5-10mins. 
As usual we got seated, got menus and they asked for what drinks we wanted. So far so good with service with Amanda. She took our orders and talked a little to my 1 1/2 year old niece. Drinks came out quick. The banana nut muffin that came with our meal came out as well and it was so delish!!! My daughter and I got one each and we saved one for later. We didn't want to get full so we shared one. 
Our food came out. I had the corn beef hash with the side of potatoes. Potatoes were good. I don't know why I got the corn beef. I'm not really a fan of it but it got a lot of reviews. My daughter ate half of her omelette and saw a hair in it. We bothered one of the servers about it and she took it back and made my daughter a half order of the same omelette. Almost done with our meal, they forgot to t bring out the banana pancakes my bro ordered. We reminded them about it too. 
The lady that took back the omelette came out with a complimentary plate of these banana bread with custard filling goodness. She probably gave it to us because of my daughters omelette and forgetting the pancakes on time. Omg! It melts in your mouth!! 
I love this place and they have the best customer service. Especially when it's crazy busy in there. When they brought out the pancakes, they told us they did not charge us for the omelette and pancakes. How awesome is that??

We dined on a Friday morning around 11 and there was a wait of about 15 minutes.  The menu is cute and read likes a newspaper. 

The portions are huge and we split 3 dishes between the 4 of us. 

Catherine's Scramble: chicken, mushrooms, spinach, feta and artichokes.  I was sold on all the ingredients and the dish was amazing and flavorful.

Bacon, avocado and cheese omelette: full of bacon flavor and packed with avocados.  Usually when I get avocado with my omelette it is served sparingly with just a few pieces on top.  They were not stingy with it and filled it completely.

Corned beef hash: the good stuff, not canned corn beef.  Eggs and toast were included.

All the dishes were served with a side of ranch potatoes, which is amazing in itself.  I would eat the potatoes alone!

 Priced well with large portions.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes.

Being from Hawaii, an order of the Loco Moco was placed, along with the Ranch Club.

The ground beef on the Loco Moco was hard and a bit bland. The Club was okay and unfortunately, the onion rings were average, at best, as I am used to panko onion rings which make it flaky crispy.

We went to breakfast because my dad loves breakfast (and so do I, but not as much as him). He got the biscuits and gravy meal (as he does at most places). I got stuffed french toast, which means eggs, meat, and cheese inside.

I ate past the point of being full, while still leaving a little on the plate, and my dad finished his pretty quickly because it was so good. He said as we were walking to the car, ""That's about as good of a breakfast as I've ever eaten."" That's a top-level compliment that he doesn't use lightly.

We waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  I'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.

Since breakfast is not my favorite meal, I love it when I find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  There were so many options I had to choose from.  I was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the Tacos Rancheros.  I chose the Tacos Rancheros.  It was a tortilla topped with refried beans, ground hamburger, two eggs (which I got fried) and topped with cheese and sour cream.  I would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  My partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  It was enormous.  She could only eat half of it to which our server, Karla suggested getting the half order next time!  Shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  But, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  We both loved the Old Bay seasoned fried potatoes.  As we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  Very nice.  Oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  That's a brilliant idea!

Atmosphere: Dirty and chaotic. Clearly disorganized. Ketchup bottle was covered in icing (?) and the table felt sticky. Unsure if anything had been wiped down before we were seated. Observed a server tossing a drink out to the bushes as she was cleaning up. Left under the impression that the staff doesn't care much for the guest experience. 

Service: Inconsistent. Our server was friendly, however the young girl who took our payment at the counter was pushy and clearly unhappy to be at work. I get that it was New Year's Eve, but it was at 2:30 in the afternoon -- no reason to be so miserable and inhospitable. Perhaps she could use some coaching around how important the final interaction is with the guest, as it should always be positive in order to leave a lasting impression on their experience.

1262667,2011-01-16,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Summary:  Perhaps the best breakfast restaurant I've ever found.

Long version:  So I'm on vacation with my two adult sons (and one of the boy's GF).  Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google ""best las vegas breakfast"".  #1 on the list is ""The Egg and I"".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.  

So first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.

Coffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.

Between the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.  

But most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.  

Apparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I.",zIQvyJQPeiXkB1Y6sdO7jQ,0,0,5,n7ApNw3HgpyCC7h3Rgzulg

You will not regret coming here as long as you are looking for what they have on the menu!!",xH63knKaVhclXU2gSP1q_A,0,0,4,NN6_3ZdIOWB1UYNnPdkXFQ

He ordered The Original Breakfast Burrito. It was very tasty and a good size. About 7"" long and 3"" diameter. The stuffing was tasty and just the right spice, the sauce on top was delicious. 

I ordered the Works Veggie Benny. The vegetables were great, English muffins toasted well but not so much that they hurt your mouth while you're eating. Eggs were perfectly cooked (I am so crappy at cooking eggs that this always amazes me). My only complaint was that I wasn't super happy with the hollandaise which is 75% of why most people order Eggs Benedict (I think). 

Both came with habla diablo seasoned potatoes which were very tasty. Both of us finished our plates.

I flipped through and saw this place called Egg & I and their other location Egg Works. It looked interesting and the reviews sounded good plus had coupon for one meal free with purchase of another meal. Cool..I will take my co-workers there. Big mistake! They know best known for banana nut muffin served warm with butter but it had this weird taste as if they used artificial sweetener or perhaps the blend wasn't right because it tasted like metal or whatever it just tasted awful. It was nice to give all 6 of us free banana nut muffin but my guys wouldn't touch it!

 I ordered classic eggs Benedict, my fav breakfast choice. I was excited plus the potatoes versus hash browns. The potatoes had too much of that lawry seasoning...ugh. Then worse, my hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever had! They didn't properly make the sauce and then to make it worse, the whole dish was slathered in it! I literally used a spoon to scoop out the sauce just so I could eat everything else which wasn't much better but I needed to eat. Would never come back even if I was paid to do so plus I read other reviews where this place was actually busy and needed to go early, well we were there Saturday morning around 8am and it was not busy at all!",H1ezv5QZbSxwvdRBgxDynQ,1,0,1,iyX8e-1e0_eX9AXQ3Pfc1g

Come in and was seated right away. Service is nice and friendly. They leave the pitcher of coffee on the table which is nice to. First time here the waiter offered us there famous banana nut muffin. We don't really eat muffins but we finished this in no time it was that good. I haven't had anything like it to be honest. Same goes for my parents they never eat that stuff but boy did they love it. I ordered scrambled eggs with mushrooms tomatoes and spinach. My dad ordered the Mexican omelette and my mom ordered scrambled eggs and potatoes. The potatoes are to die for. The best I've had.

First, they have a huge menu, which makes it hard to decide what to get in the first place since I love all breakfast foods. So I went basic with buttermilk pancakes and eggs and bacon. Everyone's eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon crispy as I had requested. Short stack of 2 pancakes was more than I could finish. My husband and a friend each got some sort of skillet concoction, and I probably didn't finish my pancakes because my fork kept was always in his skillet because it was so good! The four of us were all pleased with our meal.

1363548,2012-07-02,3,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"How I'd never heard of Egg&I until last night, I'll never know. I love off-Strip, local establishments where I can get my grub on, and this is definitely on my list now. 

I intended to get my butt up at 5 am and be at their door at 6 am when they opened, but my brain determined I needed sleep more than food and I ended up putting my name down at noon-thirty, at the height of brunch/lunch time. I was told the wait was about 15 minutes; I waited a solid 20 (which isn't bad when ""15 minutes"" usually serves as code for half-an-hour) and was promptly greeted by my wonderful server. I had my food about 10 minutes after I placed my order.

My late uncle was a gourmet chef, and my earliest, fondest memories of Vegas revolve around eating his cooking. Biscuits and gravy were on the usual menu when my family and I made our annual road trip out here, and I have purposely shied away from ever ordering it because nothing could ever come close.

But, for some reason, I ordered it anyway here. Was it as good as my Uncle Ray's? 

Does the free show in front TI have anything to do with pirates anymore?

Exactly. But that said, I would probably order it again. I regret not remembering my server's name, but she's one of the best I've had in a LONG time, and as someone that waited tables and bartended her way through school, my standards of service are ridiculously high. She was awesome, and was warmer, more attentive and professional than any server I've had elsewhere in Vegas, even in those pretentious ""five-star"" restaurants you'll find in abundance in this city.

Keep in mind they're open from 6 am - 3 pm. I was told by a girl at the host desk that the best time to go was 6-8 and after 1:30.

Overall value?

Price: 3.5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4

= 4.17. But Yelp! doesn't offer a decimal rating. So a solid four stars from me. Worth visiting at least once if you want a tasty meal in a casual atmosphere without the pretentious attitude.",01TCJT7w7M0kMEqmyenFuQ,3,2,4,pkI3JmdxLELv2_ubE0wYAA

This was another one of those ""it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food"" type of places.  A lot of things on the menu sounded great.  
 got the Chicken Enchilada Omelet.  It was ok.
I forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  It was ok.
My friend ordered pork chops and eggs.  Looked great.  He said it was ok.
My cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that Rachel Ray had ordered.  She was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  Her enthusiasm seemed forced.

Breakfast is my fav meal of the day and I really like to get or make a seriously good one. 
Wow, this one turned out to be great.. 
First, we had this great server... Thaynara... She was sweet, understanding, and smart! She has patience while we figured out what we wanted to eat, so many choices!  YOU HAVE TO SEND HER TO SEE MICKEY!!!!!!!
Since we were 3, two of us decided to split the Works Veggie Benny... and Pumpkin Pancakes.. and the third party got the Chili Rellenos. 
Everything was really good.. I always hesitate to get poached eggs since so many restaurants make them in advance and have them sitting in a water bath, so in the end either you get a medium to hard yolk or a watery mess.. these were perfect, the minute you cut into them the yolk spread everywhere, the spinach and avocado were raw not cooked to death and I just can't believe the potatoes.. They were spiced and hot and really good, and we had a  choice of potatoes or fruit and since we couldn't decided Thay suggested 1/2 and 1/2.. Perfect. 
The pumpkin pancakes were moist (which I didn't expect, usually they are dry dry dry) but they were really good, like a good pumpkin cake (not pie).. 
And the Rellenos were really good, not too much cheese (which I don't like) and he really enjoyed them.
All in all a really good meal! 
It's 3PM and I'm still not hungry..
Oh, and we tried the Banana Muffins.. we gobbled them up! 
Even the coffee was OK..

It came out greasy and you just can't enjoy and finish the whole plate.  My friend ordered the pancakes and we agreed that it was the worst pancake we have ever tasted.

They were pretty crowded when we arrived but they somehow had a table available and sat us down right away.  My 1.5 year old was super cranky and everyone who worked there smiled and tried to get him to lighten up- no eye rolling or snippy comments.  

The kids got super cute menus that looked like little books/newspapers and crayons.  It kept my daughter well entertained.  Our server was friendly and super quick.  I got the eggs benedict and I'm not sure why.  I had never had it before.  There must've been a picture of it in the menu or something.  But let me tell you, it was SO good!  I've since ordered it back home in Chicago a couple different times and NOTHING compares to the one I had from Egg & I.  

Each table has a little egg figure on it.  One side is a happy egg and the other side is a sad egg.  If you need ANYTHING you just turn your egg to sad and someone IMMEDIATELY tends to you- even in the chaos of a super busy day.  We needed more napkins and had more than we knew what to do with within seconds.

Service: 5/5
------------------
The service was good. There was only one bad service experience. One of the hosts that was taking our phone number and name to seat us when ready was very rude. She looked very unhappy, and spoke rudely with very few words: ""Phone number....Name....Number of people."" We gave her the information and she just turned away. Some what rude. After being seated, our server was very polite and kind, an opposite from the host. It being our first visit we asked for recommendations, and he gave us a number of recommendations, from the stuffed french toast to the chili relleno omelette. Because it was our first time, he brought us free banana nut muffins on the house, as a welcome to The Egg and I! First time a restaurant has done that. 

Food: 5/5
-------------------
We ordered the stuffed french toast, traditional eggs benedict, and chili relleno omelette. 

Stuffed French Toast: 4/5
Scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage sandwiched between 2 pieces of french toast. Was good but not amazing. I found it to be dry, but I'd honestly get it again. 

Eggs Benedict: 5/5
The eggs were perfect, and english muffin perfect texture. However, a bit heavy with the hollandaise sauce. Overall, probably my favorite entree. 

Chili Relleno Omelette: 4/5
Cooked perfectly, with lots of flavor. Unique dish with the chilis inside the omelette. Didn't get to try much of it

Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5/5
Probably some of the best potatoes I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'd almost compare the texture to McDonalds french fries. They're seasoned with spices and we're very very good!

Banana Nut Muffins: 5/5
Best banana nut muffins I've ever had! Not too sweet and very moist. One of my favorite items we got.

Overall: 5/5
---------------
Great value, food, and customer service. Each person costs around $10-15. However, almost everyone I saw left with to-go boxes because they gave so much food!",6ypfe7ZyB4f4B0CspGdPjA,0,1,5,x4GJVEI2inYIQrIdSbyk3A

1.  Much much cheaper to eat at than on the strip.
2.  The drive is close by from the Stratosphere.
3.  Portions are VERY generous and filling.
4.  Service is outstanding with many smiles (thank you Amanda).  =)
5.  Hot sauce selection extends from regular tabasco and tapatio (thank goodness!).
6.  Saturday mornings are a little less crowded than Sunday mornings.
7.  Homemade banana nut muffin.
8.  Parking in a shared lot.

BIG TIP:  Be sure not to wait until 10:30am to get up and eat here or else you will be waiting.

So why leave the strip to come here??  To be honest, I wanted something good for also a good price.  You know that dry, empty feeling you get from some run-of-the-mill restaurants?  That breakfast where you are happy that you ate it, however, it just settles in your stomach because it has to, not because it wants to?  Exactly!

I just happened by this place on a Saturday morning.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, which can be an annoyance, or it can be an excellent endorsement for patience.  My wife had a four-egg multi-cheese omelette, and tiny as she is, she ate every bit, washing it down with coffee (that was attentively refilled!).  It came with choice of potatoes and a super-delicious muffin.  I had a specialty omelette that was filled with spicy veggies and cheese.  When it came time to kick the spuds to the side, the waitress offered fruit, tomatoes, or fruit and tomatoes!  The fruit was chosen, fresh, sliced, and nicely arranged.  I had the coffee too, and the waitress was never stingy when more creamers were requested.  Such good service.  I can see why this place has people waiting for a seat.

This place has the best egg-dish menu I've ever seen.  The price of most dishes is in the $10.00 or less range.

highlights: giant portions, strong coffee, FAST SERVICE.

First day I ordered biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. Was a little weirded out by the orange potatoes but when mixed with the gravy they were very good. The biscuits are freshly made and are amazing! Coffee was really good and strong here too.

I was very curious for the Cincy chili and got a side of that but I had to taste it and take it to go. It was AWESOME. Brought it home and ate it on a hot dog! AWESOME.

the service here was VERY fast and it was great but definitely hard for everywhere else we ate in Vegas to live up to.

lets see my other families food choices were all GIANT and everyone was really happy which is very unusual for us.

Second day I ordered the spam, rice and eggs. I think they called it Hawaiian special. Of course it was great.

The wait was manageable as we arrived in between the early morning rush and weekend late breakfast crowd.  We can tell why it is a local favorite as it the staff offers a warm welcome.

Their famous banana muffin arrived almost immediately after we put in the order.  It was so light, fuffy, yet sticky, we could have easily eaten a full loaf just the two of us.  We didnt realize you can order the full lf until a plate was served near us... 

Their menu (made to look like the morning paper - clever concept!) offered an abundant options that it could be overwhelming.

They dropped our veggie eggs benedict, so they had to fire it again... the spinach was left raw and piled in top of the itty bitty english muffin and slivers of avocados.  We love spinach, but the proportions were off - would have liked a slightly sauteed spinach or place a smaller portion of raw leaves.

Our other orders were a classic over easy eggs with spicy seasoned potatoes with an xtra side of waffles.  Since they had to re-fire the eggs benedict, the egg was luke warm and waffles were not as golden crispy as we liked.

Whoever made our batch of coffee added too much water as it was missing that needed caffeine perk.  Im sensitive to caffeine and even I thought it was too weak.

Between the 4 of us that tried Egg & I, we each got different dishes and were all very happy with the food. The portion size is huge as well. If you're not that hungry, share with someone. The omelettes are made with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 eggs. FOUR EGGS. It's a beast omelette among eggs.

Three things I will highlight: The eggs benedict, the banana nut muffin, and potatoes.
--Eggs Benedict: Order this and you will not be disappointed. The hollandaise sauce that's drizzled over the eggs is something that most places mess up, but at Egg & I, it's made to perfection -- smooth, creamy and seasoned just right.
--Banana Nut Muffin: They give this to you when you order and omelette, and don't miss out. It's the most airy, soft, moist -- yes, moist -- muffin you'll ever eat. It's like they fold air into the batter before baking. THAT GOOD.
--Potatoes: MY GOD. These are the best side of potatoes I've ever had. I'm convinced they have to be fried, but I'm not sure. The exterior is exquisitely golden crispy with a perfect seasoning blend on the outside. Best potatoes west of the Mississippi; hands down.

When I ate my meal, I discovered the biscuits weren't homemade (and were crumbly) and the gravy was unremarkable.  You can't really screw up scrambled eggs.  The potatoes were wildly over seasoned and virtually unbearable to eat.

I opted for the open-faced croissant sandwich it was loaded with cheese bacon and four large eggs even came with a side of Diablo season home fries that were really good and crispy you could even buy that seasoning to take home with you so if you're in the area and you want a breakfast to fill you up for the whole day I highly highly recommend that you drive to this location you won't be disappointed",K3aALDXCZDUMZoak1jStiQ,0,0,5,GQhMVeeGWP_2lFHxmGApwQ

Since we had a car this time in Vegas, we decided to get some brunch off the strip. We had a party of 3 and waited about 10-15 minutes before we got seated. My friend ordered the stuffed french toast, which was HUGE! The bf ordered the eggs benedict, which was not bad and good portions. I ended up ordering the egg-crepe, which was simiar to an omelette. Pretty good and not too heavy. 

What we loved the most was their banana nut muffin and ranch potatoes. O man, my mouth is watering just thinking about how light and tasty their banana nut muffin was. I could eat like 5 of those in 1 sitting. hahaha. =X We were all raving about how  the ranch potatoes were so flavorful. Plus, each dish had a big portion of it. I definitely wasn't complaining. 

Our waitress was very attentive, but not over-bearing. She told us if we needed something, we could just flip the little egg over to get her attention (reminded me of Bubba Gump's).

I will definitely want to come back and try other things on the menu, since I go to Vegas about 3 times a year.",948m27i9ZU8ODA7t-VO0Xw,1,0,5,bi1y4wtH_-xBYWRdR0IZ7g

We had a party of five and waited all of about two minutes to be seated. We must have hit the right time of morning because the place was jammed by the time we left. Well worth any wait. 

Food - The menu was expansive. So many items to choose from. I had the Three Pig Omelette with a side of their excellent hollandaise sauce. Superb. My son was pleased with his waffle. My wife, who is not a huge breakfast fan, was thrilled to see she could get an egg white omelette. She commented that you never really know how egg white dishes will turn out. She raved about her egg white veggie omelette. The two others in our party had the the biscuits and gravy and loco moco respectively. The biscuits and gravy were a hit while the loco moco was remarkably reminiscent to the Hawaiian Islands favorite dish. 

Service - The service was exceptional. In an industry where service can significantly impact the diner's experience, Oscar was fantastic. Oscar was well versed in his menu knowledge and was quick to offer recommendations and to gladly accept order substitutions. His pleasant, respectful, and appreciative demeanor really helped to set our dining experience apart from every other experience while in town. He was also aware and kind enough to notice the kitchen was getting backed up so he brought out a plateful of banana nut muffins to help stunt the growing hunger we all were suffering. 

Overall - Highly recommend this restaurant for the wonderful combination of great food and top-notch service.",OUhs8QRg0FlkuZNU87Qi5A,0,0,5,t05ZnXXHRjq8yCF6elHcOw
1684058,2015-07-09,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"My family and I decided to try this place on the morning we were headed home from Vegas. We got it off of the Triple D website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. While it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:

My mother and I both have a food allergy to Monosodium Glutamate more commonly known as MSG. It is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). For me, a little is OK, but my mother can't eat it at all. 

When we sat down at the table, we asked if they used MSG more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? Our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. My mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated Chicken Fried Steak, had to change her order. Both of chose the Sunrise Mountain and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the Habla Diablo potatoes that came with 90% of the breakfast options.

When the food came out it looked delicious, but one bite changed our opinion. While it was plentiful, it was bland. Even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.

My father, who does not share my MSG allergy, ordered a skillet. Mom and I both took a bite of the Habla Diablo potatoes from his plate and they were delicious. Crunchy and flavorful, I would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing MSG. And the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).

I gave this place two stars because the service was good and the banana nut muffins delicious. Now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...",nME_tF2ktzjsXR1rRjmDgQ,0,0,2,2GEinv-uwd82zRXLQ1HZRw

I've ordered their oatmeal, their scrambles, their wonderful blueberry pancakes that they make with multi-grain (or was it whole wheat?). I'm not sure if I ever ordered anything that wasn't good.

Their service has been great so far. They have that nifty system of turning your egg sign on your table if you need service. I'd have to say their wait staff has always been efficient and attentive.

We often frequent Egg Works, Cracked Egg, I'm not sure if it's all owned by the same company. Their menus are slightly different, some serve coffee cakes, some serve muffins. You can't really miss with either one, they are all delicious.

Highly recommend for your family-friendly casual breakfast/brunch. Beware like many great breakfast places, the weekends get pretty busy, especially Sunday during the church rush. Definitely worth it :)",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,2,2,5,xMIdT4kzAFIZwUhejObhWQ

This place has just about anything you could think of for hot breakfast, (except oatmeal) and some items you would never dream of.

The newspaper-style menu is a breakfast gazette of headlines - like carrot cake French toast, pork carnitas burritos, and just about every type of omelet and pancake you could ever imagine.

Liza was our fabulous hostess on our dining journey. This woman is the epitome of a multi-tasker, buzzing around and paying attention to every little detail, from the quality of our food to the assurance our glasses remained full... and even the fact that I was rubbing my arms and she instantly picked up that I was cold and turned the air conditioner up a few degrees, without me asking. 
This woman is amazing at customer service! 

All of our food came out together (for seven people) and it was all piping hot! We were never left unattended and were quite entertained at how Liza perfectly orchestrated her tables (including our own).

Some of the dishes at our table included:
* Stuffed French toast - like a deconstructed monte cristo with bacon; delicious!
* Vegetarian crepe - filled with veggie goodness.; so fresh and so clean-clean.
* The Classic - hot scrambled eggs, toast and ham - American style.
* Pork carnitas burrito - mexitastic pork in a verde sauce wrapped in a soft flour tortilla; to die for.
* Egg whites and short stack of buckwheat pancakes - both cooked with no oil...  I was trying to watch my caloric intake, and The Egg and I was happy to accommodate me.

Make sure to check into yelp for a free muffin that's baked fresh! They have a spacious indoor area which can get pretty noisy and an outdoor patio. The service I'm sure is great if you're a regular or a familiar face, but whatever otherwise. If you pick to eat outside, just keep in mind you probably won't get checked on too frequency (could be good or bad depending on you)",wdJKGY0xI5jpFrEL4Gm2fQ,1,0,3,4ke-qo6U3bRQOSxvi4ct2Q

Menu items of note:
Crazy Chicken - simply a well balanced omelette

Eggs Benedict Florentine - not a fan of eggs benedict in general, but I am when I come here

Banana Nut Muffin - this thing might be enough of a reason to come here just by itself

Haole (sp?) loco - on the back page, under the Hawaiian section, it's one of the more fattening things on the menu, but very tasty.

Not a fan of their homefries, so I substitute them out with fruit instead

Service:
The servers are usually quite friendly, helpful, and attentive.

Reasons why I come here:
This is one of the cheaper and healthier breakfast options in Vegas, yet there is no sacrifice in quality for the food.  Much better than the overrated Hash House a Go Go.

I saw Rachel Ray talk about the place on her Tasty Travels show and I thought I'd give it a try and get out of my ""usual"" Vegas routine.  But after going to three Rachel Ray recommended places (Vegas, LA, and Denver), I think I'm done trusting her judgment!

We went on a rainy, Saturday morning around 10:30 and had to wait maybe 15 minutes in a small waiting area which was crowded w/ folks trying to avoid the cold rain.

When we were seated I already knew what we were going to order b/c I had Yelped the place and read their menu online.  I ordered the Ultimate Skillet for the b/f (he likes breakfast skillets), and the large Cashew Blueberry Pancake for myself.  

We had the ""famous"" banana nut muffin as our bread choice with the skillet, and let me just say, it was a regular ol' banana nut muffin.  I was gonna buy a whole loaf if it turned out to be good, but really, it was nothing to write home about.  Very average.

The b/f noted that the skillet was made up mostly of their potatoes (another thing that ppl rave about).  I hardly got any of the other ingredients in there so I was disappointed in the skillet, too.

The pancake was alright.  It *WAS* big, as others have commented, but again, no big deal.  It was served with blueberry compote and I thought that helped b/c it tasted sorta dry.  The b/f thought some of the pancake was undercooked b/c he could taste the batter.  Maybe I should've gone w/ the silver dollar sized pancakes?

Also, I think cashews don't really work w/ pancakes (unlike walnuts and macadamia nuts).

The ""large"" 12-oz glass of OJ was pretty small so the b/f thought it was funny they would call it a ""large.""

Breakfast with tip was around $25 I think.  Not cheap for what you get.

I had a lovely vegetarian omelette, but I was really crazed over my banana nut muffin. It was better than I remember, and it was actually steaming in the cold weather.

Considering the overbearing amount of 5 star reviews this place has, I'm not sure why my experience was so disappointing in comparison. 

We ordered the banana nut muffin (free with a check in), the Classic, and the Works skillet. Two tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. We ended up waiting a really long time just for two entrees. But we brushed it off considering there could be many factors at play.

The Classic had three slices of bacon that resembled rubber. They were not crispy at all. I didn't like the seasoning of Hablo Diablo potatoes as I felt the seasoning was overbearingly strong. I felt like there was hardly any meat and a WHOLE lot of potatoes. 

We drank all our water and tried to get our waitress's attention. After five minutes or so, I flipped the egg to yellow (meaning we would like attention). Our waitress glanced at our table and proceeded to walk away. Another waitress promptly flipped it back to black and asked what we needed. When I said we needed a refill she said okay and proceeded to chat with the table next to us. She never bothered to grab our waters. Finally, our waitress asked what it was that we needed earlier and finally got us water.

One of the most innovative breakfast menu's I've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  Service was outstanding, our waitress, Jessica, was fast and efficient.  

The feature here is undoubtedly their banana nut muffins.  They were excellent, rivaling the best homemade I've ever tasted.  What amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   They were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  They have a slight gingerbread taste to them so I suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   I know how much work they are to make homemade which is why I really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    The food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with bananas in it.  I feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three banana muffins- mine, my son's, and a free one as a YELP check-in bonus.  I carried two out and enjoyed them later in the day.

I had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  The potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  My son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  A nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the Vegas temps and low humidity.

It's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in Las Vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.",sWSEaVR-h-WerPU1bNpNeQ,1,0,5,yV1KK-4j9y_gScdtTOIhbQ

-Huge Portions
-easy parking, no valet necessary as it's off the strip.
-They give you a big coffee carafe so you can refill your coffee as often as you'd like.

Not so EGGsellent:
-Ordered a skillet and it didn't really have the ""bacon and onion"" in it ... it was all potatos and eggs.
-The potatoes are not good.  They are the little cube kind, and they are just meh tasting.  Considering the potatoes take up the bulk of the portion ... this is the main factor that kept me from a 4 star review.
-Eggstremely slow service when paying.  There was literally a line out the door to give payment.
-off the strip

1901924,2017-06-13,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Best breakfast I ever ate!  Seriously!

I will say - my coworker and I were in Las Vegas for work.  It was a Friday, around noon and we had finished with our client earlier than expected. We did a Google search to see what was available close by for food as neither of us had a chance to have a real breakfast that morning.  After scrolling past several chains I landed on a name that wasn't familiar and highly rated - Egg & I.  I was later a little bummed to discover that Egg & I is in fact a chain, as I had hoped it was local to the area (I was unfamiliar with it being from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region and never encountering one before).  I will tell you though - I did not regret choosing this place for a late breakfast/early lunch.

When we pulled up the place was hopping.  A good sign that we picked a good place.  Inside there appeared to be a mix of both tourists and locals.  Although they were busy, we were seated very quickly.  Every plate I passed on the way to the table had breakfast food on it, and it all looked and smelled amazing.

The menu was quite extensive... what you would typically find in a diner.  The omelettes and breakfast skillets sounded especially appealing, and come to find out are their most popular choices.

Our waitress was attentive and very helpful in providing menu suggestions.  When she found out it was our first time there, she insisted on bringing us fresh banana nut muffins - which was a great touch!

The muffins were divine - served warm, they were thick and rich.  Like a really good banana bread in muffin form.

I chose to get an egg white omelette with mushrooms, spinach, artichokes and cheese.  It came cooked perfectly and I liked that the cheese was smothered on top and not actually in the omelette.  It was a nice twist.  The breakfast potatoes served on the side were also cooked perfectly - crisp (and not greasy!) on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoned with a signature mix of spices.  Based on what I've seen online, most other locations do seasoned ranch potatoes.  I liked the Vegas location's spicier take!  It had a kick, but wasn't too spicy.  I liked the blend of seasoning so much, I purchased a bottle to take home with me.

My coworker ordered a skillet and raved about how delicious it was!  

Even though the place is a chain, they must be locally franchised and I really liked how the Vegas location had the feeling of a locally owned place.  

Great food, great people and it was less than 15 minutes from the Strip and airport.  I'd definitely take the trek out for a meal or two on my next Vegas trip.",F5FjOYlaVqHMpo0Caoz6MA,0,0,5,ldqRnbYkF-dVg3FpG0RORA

My Buddy recommended The Egg & I after hearing some good things about it from other sources. I've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as B&C Camera. 

They have a diverse menu of egg related items. I was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked GOOD but ended up getting a Hawaiian themed plate which featured Portuguese Sasuage or Spam (went for the sausage), rice, two eggs any style (sunny side up), ""sticky"" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). Also came with a choice of what ever bread or the banana nut muffin everyone raves about. 

I choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. Blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. If i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be The Egg & I's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it. 

Overall the island favorite plate was good, obviously the Portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. Even with the banana nut muffin dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. For the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.

So far i do like this place. Outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. Looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong.",7A7FOLZZKL0iokQVOAEbgA,4,3,4,00p0XgfK84_1zlLxBKf0Mw

1994780,2014-12-18,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"VERY MISLED by Yelpers here. No accounting for taste....

We had the tuna melt, the Sundance Special, and the flavored coffee (partner's idea). The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.

The tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The ""cheese"" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.

I picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.

The flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.

1996691,2010-03-22,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Thank you Yelp!  We were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to Phoenix.  We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.

The special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.

One friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.

The standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.

There are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .

1 - Don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of Guinness, chances are it may fall in.
2 - Cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  Even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.
3 - Add the Egg & I to the ""must-have"" list anytime I'm in Vegas!",4DaYRzOMGcn2zoWkHLNBjA,2,1,4,sf9E2kZGtj1art8cgZ_FFg

We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. I swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. Breakfast at Egg & I was under $30 :)

They were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.

Service was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.

Breakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.

BF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.

You pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way. Overall though, a good breakfast place. If you're willing to drive a couple minutes off the strip to save some cash, I recommend this place!",rrTmcv7FtbwgjAinmS9uTA,9,8,4,9lRFqeCoNKPvWK-c4pAJyQ

Abby was great!!!  Service is very pleasant.  Angel just swung by to drop off the water and coffee and we had a fun little 2 minute conversation.  Never too busy for friendly banter here.  Menu looks great.  I ordered the Green Chili Hash.  Can't wait to try it!

Also , they have a cool way of letting us get their attention.  See the pictures.  The Black egg means everything is fine; the yellow egg means we need something:  I did a test run (didn't need anything) and they were on us immediately!  That was worth a couple of extra dollars in the tip!  Angel left a pot of coffee on our table which is a plus in any breakfast restaurant setting...

Fast forward 30 mins....  food came out way sooner than we expected.  Cook staff is ON POINT!   Green Chili Hash was phenomenal!  Rice and beans and sourdough toast a perfect compliment.  Better half had the stuffed French toast with strawberries and cream cheese.  Pro tip:  get the strawberry and cream cheee in the side (unstuff the stuffed FT).  Might be too sweet for some but by unstuffing, you can manage that sweet tooth just right!

I appreciate the choices in coffee creamers and the carafe being left of the table, which saves the hassle of tracking down a server for a refill when you've got a small cup o' joe. Good coffee, but I come here for the eggs. 

I ordered the hash, but our table also ordered a pancake plate and a waffle works. The waffles look light and crisp, the pancakes are fluffy and have a variety of fillings (but I think we got charged a different-than-base-price for these, so ask or watch out? Our server suggested something after we handed over the menus), and the crispy little home fried potatoes are so tasty! (I got a half serving of these, half serving of fruit--which is plenty of both!) My hash was homemade and nothing like that cubed canned corned beef hash, but it was pretty salty for my tastes. My eggs came out EGGsactly right and were mouthwateringly delicious for something so simple--eggs. My fiance asked for tomatoes in his scrambled eggs, and those were extra too, and we weren't informed of that/how much until we saw it on the check (the pancake chocolate chips and the tomatoes somehow managed to be about $5, so I don't know how that stacks up, but it peeved me a bit).

If they ask you if you want toast or the banana muffin, DO NOT GET TOAST. GET THE DANG MUFFIN. It is sooooo good. It doesn't look like anything special, mostly because it's flat on top and served upside down, but it's soft and moist and tasty and warm and goodness gracious, so amazing. If you're counting calories, #1 you're in the wrong place, #2 put butter on it anyway.

The little eggy signs are so helpful for when you need to track down your server--a great idea instead of trying to get someone's attention in the (can be) noisy atmosphere. 

This place is fantastic, but I pulled a star because the server forgot a side order for half the meal and didn't notify us of the upcharges on the items at time of order and after suggesting (i.e. we order regular pancakes, he suggests blueberry or chocolate chip, but doesn't mention they cost extra) after taking the menus so we couldn't see ourselves. I know some things are extra, but how much sometimes influences people's decisions--knowing if it was $0.50 versus $2.00 would have made that difference, for example.

Note that for any entree that lists sides .. they let you swap out the sides! As in, you can change out what's listed there on the menu [took me a while to realize I could get fruit/salad/etc.]. I personally am a huge fan of their seasoned potatoes and omelettes.

I loved this restaurant.  We only had to wait 15 minutes on a Sunday morning and were kindly seated.  The restaurant is a good size and was cutely decorated.  It's a really good family and brunch place.  

I ordered an omelette and enjoyed it a lot.  The portions are generous here.  The best part of this place is the service.  Our server (older Hispanic lady) was very funny and recommended different things for us.  I was being picky and she let me.  Thanks, ma'am!  The roasted potatoes here are really good.  I like hashed browns a lot and never really like home potatoes, but for once the potatoes trumped the hashed browns.  They were crispy and lightly seasoned.

I tried the chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes and the tasted absolutely AMAZING!  I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full.  I also had a bite of someone's French toast sandwich, and oh my gosh, did that taste like heaven in my mouth!!!!!  If you're ok with a heart attack on a plate, this is it.  It was a huge portion of eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage goodness.  This was probably the tastiest thing on the menu, and I had only a bite.

Their high selling point is their super nice staff. They give you the perfect amount of chit chat and leave you alone time.

Use their egg signs. Yellow Egg means you need attention; Black Egg means leave me alone.",Zqffsrm-GdChbzXjyVcHkg,2,0,3,EdFsvBTYXNYuDR8ula6aRA

This is my first time having brunch here on my visit to Las Vegas. 

The variety of food and the service totally blows my mind. 
Our server was very nice and informative. She gives us her honest opinions when we ask which of the loco moco we should try. Instead of harming business, I think this is a good practice. To be able to know what the insider thinks...

The banana muffin.... speechless. Out of this world good. Still ooey gooey and warm out of oven. New guest should make sure to take advantage of the free muffin for yelp check in.

2125442,2015-12-13,9,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Review - Egg & I


If I were looking for a reason to move to Las Vegas the Egg & I would be the reason.  Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. 

The Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.

The Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls

The menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.    

The omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.

To summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...",veUS1l3hes5PI3824b9MkQ,11,10,5,a2XmKduzi8DDx_ndBsy0ow

We ended up here and I'm excited have never received such amazing customer service from someone like I did today from Oscar.

2130696,2015-12-04,4,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"This is a great breakfast option off the strip. Took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. 

It's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. Popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. Luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. Good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.

Country style atmosphere and décor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. Old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. Prices are reasonable and large portions. I highly recommend trying their famous banana nut muffin. OMG, so good! Super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. I got mine free with my Yelp check-in. You can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entrées for a muffin. 

We ordered ""The Works"" scramble, Fresh Veggie omelet and the Hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. Everything was fantastic! Served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. It's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with hash browns and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. Enough for 2, I literally devoured everything and no regrets. I loved the taste and texture of the hash browns, lightly crisp and tender. I usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. Of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? Simple Hawaiian-Pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. Just the way us locals love them.

Most of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. Egg and I was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. Service was excellent too. Our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. Still thinking about those banana nut muffin.

2195925,2014-11-13,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"This was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  It's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. 
We were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. 
Our waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!
Firstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. 
First thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand. 
I usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it. 
It was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. 
Chile Relleno Benedict:
Wow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. 
I don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good. 
My GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup. 
I fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",j4tYYqkWb42AUFhti5L6HQ,0,0,5,6IUp0SgOs3VzU0_FMRQ4_A

The menu is huge, and a little confusing, as the staples are towards the back (eggs, pancakes and waffles) while they seem to push several styles of eggs Benedict and four-egg omelettes (not a fan, blech.)  Service was what I expect from a half-decent diner - fast and punctual.  My waffle was not served with real maple syrup, which was a major bummer.  The potatoes that are included with the standard egg breakfast were small squares but were cooked perfectly and tasted a lot like French fries from Fuddruckers (heavy on the Thyme, which gives them a reddish, golden-brown color.) There's a little stand at the table with two metal egg badges. The first, in black, is a happy egg face which states to the wait staff that all is well.  The second is an egg-face in bright yellow with a somewhat consternated egg-face which signifies to the wait staff that you're either unhappy with the meal, but mostly tells them you need something.  I was in a particularly crappy mood, so I kept flipping the egg-face to the bright yellow unhappy egg-face, and the waitress was getting perturbed with me.

Corned Beef Hash:  husband really enjoyed the ""real"" corned beef in the hash!

Eggs Benedict Florentine:  Yummy!  The sauce was delicious, I think I would stick with the original eggs Benedict.  The spinach was served fresh and not sautéed which I was expecting.

2227470,2010-10-14,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Eggs & I is a popular brunch spot for locals in Las Vegas.  We had to drop by the airport and chose Eggs & I as our go-to food spot afterwards.

The menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.

Service is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  The menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.

We started out with their signature banana nut muffin which accompanies many of their dishes.  Light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.

Our entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:

Prime Rib Benny (or Benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an Eggs Benedict version made up of prime rib.  It replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.

Florentine Benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  Pretty good.

Chicken Fried steak - I only had a few bites, but I liked it.  It's a calorie killer though.

Kay's Omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  Kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  You could make similar omelettes at home.

Brad's Chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  It came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble. 

Eggs & I is a decent brunch spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  They take credit cards, including American Express.",r9Wii37p0kEDIUt2e2_LqQ,2,2,3,Chu5DuhjU97MOan5Ni1nnA

We had the Maple bacon French toast which had a unique savory-sweet kick to it- you could really taste both the maple and the bacon in the whipped cream cheese! Amazing dessert for sharing.
The banana nut muffin that came with the yelp check in had just the right balance of banana, and was moist but firm, great texture that didn't make you feel too heavy after.
The veggie eggs Benedict crushed the eggs Benedict game, all the ingredients were fresh and the home fries were perfection. I don't usually like home fries, but these had a special seasoning that was particularly delectable. Also, kudos to Egg&I for having such a great online seating system.

Part of the plan has you delaying breakfast until you get to Las Vegas, and the plan is working pretty well so far.  At Barstow you get out your phone and you begin to review the non casino options in Las Vegas when 'Egg and I' leaps out with these great reviews and a fantastic star rating.  Sold!

When we check-in on yelp we get a free Banana Nut Muffin, and things seem to be fantastic.

Our server is charismatic, checks in often, provides us with a pitcher of water (its something like 100 degrees outside and rising), and was efficient throughout the meal.

Our omelettes arrive in a timely fashion, and so what is their to complain about.  

First, I like cheese, and so having cheese is always a good thing, and for you this may be a big plus, but there was so much cheese it was hard to taste anything else.  I had ordered the chile rellano omelette, and it arrived as advertised, but with just a ton of cheese.  

Second, the potatoes looked to be cubed by a machine, frozen, de-frosted, and then lightly seasoned prior to arrival.  They were very disappointing.  

Third, my expectations were way too high.  My fellow yelpers love this place, and so I was expecting this amazing breakfast that just didn't live up to my expectations.

In a nutshell, I'd probably go back, but with a whole different set of expectations, knowing that I'd ask for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes, and I'd probably not choose an omelette.

I thought about this long and hard to make sure I am not exaggerating. The best meal I have ever eaten was the breakfast I ate on my trip to Las Vegas t at The Egg and I on West Sahara. This is a locals eatery.

I ate the standard, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, and hash browns. On the menu it is called ""Eggs - Plus"". I added the sausage à la carte. As I was eating, the taste of the meal brought a smile to my face.


 The eggs were very good. Not greasy or salty. Very tasty.

 The bacon was the best I ever had. Not too salty, not soggy, and not overcooked.

 The turkey sausage was the best I ever had. Not greasy or salty. Tasty.

 The hash browns were the best I have ever had. These were the square pieces of potato type of hash browns. Usually this type of hash browns is greasy, heavy, and dense. These were light, airy, and had some type of paprika seasoning.

 The toast was the best I ever had. Light and fluffy whole wheat bread. Not dense.

The food is great, omelettes are full of flavor, home potatoes are decent (3 stars), French toast yummy goodness, large portions, great service.

I got the crazy chicken omelette, it's one of the tastiest omelettes I've ever had, a definite must!
Their home made banana nut muffin, delicious!!!

Btw, Kelsey our waitress was awesome!

But with the bright lights and a full schedule of gambling, shopping, and drinking you definitely need to start your day right with the most important meal of the day--breakfast. Egg & I is a local favorite and contrary to the restaurant's name they do serve entrees san eggs. *gasp* 

The offering:
*Reuben Sandwich w/ Fries: The meat was perfectly seasoned between two toasted slices of bread. mmMmmm... Oh and they gave an extremely generous offering of french fries. yum yum! 
*Fender Blender: Some type of egg and crepe contraction which was light fluffy and all around delicious. It came with an asian-inspired sauce which complimented the main course perfectly. Oh and the potatoes were spot-on!   
*Florentine Omlette (Daily Special): Ironically the daily special was not special at all . Instead it was a complete epic fail in my party.  Way too cheesy as the produce was drowning in the gooey sea.

2310882,2018-05-04,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"My good friend Keith and I yelped for best place to eat breakfast in Vegas.  The Egg and I came up on the radar and we took a 10 min 2 mile ride to check it out. From start to finish the service and atmosphere were five star non pretentious par excellent or as they might say Eggs Cellent.  
Our sever Lacey made excellent recommended dishes and her personal favorite. We shared two plates to get the best foodie experience we could in one trip. .
Breakdown. The Mexican omelette was awesome. Plenty of distinct flavors and great size plate. Cheesy and little bit of a bite of spice  We had the home potatoes which were made to perfection with hot insides and crispy outside. This was accomplished by making the potatoes very small bites almost hash size.they offered all the condiments at our table with great hot sauces. The second dish wasn't my favorite but my friend loved which was the Stuffed French toast. All the ingredients we're good and the French toast itself was very good but for me it was too much in each Bite the flavors just were not distinct enough for me. We choose the fruit substitute on this plate and was surprised how much fresh fruit they gave on one plate. 
Now the best part of this place. Reviews plenty. Write ups plenty as well. But.  The best part aside from the food was the people. Lacey was phenomenal came by like 10 times. Lino the other service person at our table was the best came by and verified with us like 10 times as well and that wasn't where it stopped. The other support staff also asked us a few times if we needed anything.  Hard to find that kind of service anywhere and they all did it with a smile.  
Side note.  Coffee was left in carafe at table so no need to waive anyone down though you probably wouldn't need to with the service as good as it was here. 
Last I highly recommend this place. The price was too good to be true for this food and service combo. Thanks Lacey and Lino and the whole staff there at Egg and I. ( Aka also known as Egg Works their other five locations)

The order arrived in about 10 minutes. I nearly fell out of my chair, the slice of ham nearly covered half the plate, it was lean, cooked to perfection. The home fries were not greasy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. As I prefer over medium, along with the toast.

I was lucky to be seated right away since I was there all alone. My waitress Amanda was there immediately to see if I had any questions and to take my drink order. She has a warm smile and made me feel very welcome. I ordered the Texas toast French toast with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I also ordered a side of toast for which she asked if I wanted it buttered which usually they don't so that was great. The eggs were perfectly over medium and they were actually seasoned. Amanda was very attentive and was sure that I was not in need of anything. I also had the banana nut muffin it was one of the best I've had in a restaurant, I am a bit partial to my own.

I will say the service through out was exceptional from the moment I walked in until I left even thought the register had trouble reading the card I had. 

The food would definitely be worth the wait, and the service I experienced was above expectations for how busy the are. Give it a try if you haven't been",H1GpHM80hC5ySAV1E17bVw,0,0,5,U_IB1yi4v-5mkctvLrunqA

ok, for reals tho - 

the GRUB:
- check out my pics, my wife got the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon, french toast, powdered sugar, and maple syrup - like the kitchen sink of breakfasts all in one bite... pretty good.
- also pictured, i got the Prime Rib Benny - ala the meaty blackened spice prime rib, poached eggs, holandaise sauce, on top of an open faced buttered croissant like a traditional eggs benedict - but kicked upped... super filling and super delicious
- fresh squeezed OJ and hot cups of Joe

the JOINT:
- typical vegas locals crowd, a little bit of everyone
- old school decor on the inside (like a country kitchen)
- outside patio seating if not a scorcher of a desert day
- they had an LCD with local sports and AC too

the SQUEEZE:
- breakfasts are always too expensive to me, so im a little jaded... but anyways, those 2 dishes and fresh squeezed OJ = approx $50 after tax and tip
- friendly wait staff and hostess
- plenty of parking in the strip mall
- vegas blvd (the strip) close

pretty good change up for breakfast, if youre starting to get tired of those casino buffet champagne brunches/breakfasts...",25NDlYy0wzjq7mh3IiCp0Q,2,2,4,9bU4MFptW_itbXHpFQsOHg

Like if they just take it one notch up it could be great. All of there food is mush there is no texture I got the California crepe and idk how they call that a crepe it was way too think but the filling inside was good. While my boyfriend got one of the burritos but he could only eat half because the inside was throwing him off. On the other hand the service is great and I like how they have a lot of different kinds of creamers. It's the little things that count. This time around I got the strawberry cream cheese French toast and my boyfriend got a scramble the one with jalapeños and chorizo I like his more than my own because they used the pre-made strawberry flavored cream cheese so it just tasted like fake strawberries but the strawberry compote that was also on it was delicious. His omelette was very tasted but the chorizo bits were so small I couldn't even taste it.

The little black and yellow egg sign was cute too, just flipping it let the server know that you needed their attention, so many eggs everywhere it was a bit on the cheesy  side.

We were seated quickly.  The service was ok. I don't know in what order the food went in or what, but this is what I noticed. 

There were 2 tables in front of my view.  One table got seated 5 minutes after us and the other table seemed like they were wating forever for their food.  I'm assuming the manager, went up to the table and apologized for their food not getting there yet.  I then noticed the table who sat down 5 mintues AFTER us got served their food first.  I looked at the hubby and said, ""how did that happen?"" AND they were served way BEFORE the table that was waiting.  So something happened to communication from the servers and the kitchen.   

I got the chicken fried steak.  When we got our food I was lovin' the potatoes!!  My scramble eggs were over cooked and hard - really no flavor.  My chicken fried steak was good, but the put sooo much gravy, I had to take half of it off.

All the reviews talk about their bannana nut muffin, but more on that later, first - the eggs...   I ordered the biscuits and gravy which comes with a side of 2 eggs (I chose scrambled) and a side of potatoes (the server allowed me to sub half of the potatoes for fresh fruit.

Everything on my large plate was done perfectly.  The eggs were warm, tasty, and not under or over done.  The biscuits were deliciously moist and puffy (best I've had in as long as i can remember) with a very nice sausage gravy.  The potatoes were original and had a nice texture but the seasoning was a bit much for my taste.  And the fresh fruit was very sweet and well, fresh!  I really don't have a single complaint about the food.  I'd go here regularly for breakfast if it were closer to my house.

For first time goers you get a banana nut muffin on the house.  I don't care if you aren't a big fan of banana nut muffins, I'm really not.  But just eat it!  You won't regret it.  I don't know what they put in this pastry (sprinkled crack maybe?) but it was amazing.

As far as  the employees go, they all seemed happy, smiling, and they were genuinely nice.  There was no wait for me although I heard i just missed a rush.  everyone from the hostess to the servers to the cook did everything just right in my opinion.

Prices are fair for breakfast.  My large plate with an iced tea came to eleven bucks and change.  More than what I'm used to paying for breakfast, but worthy for the quality of the feast, and I'd happily hand it over again.",n-U4c31vGjJ4SE91Qa93Vw,0,0,4,1PZCLuH-DOnLT_eS2vLrIQ

It's one of those bfast places where there are mugs on the table and the server brings you a giant pot of coffee and leaves it with you at your disposal.  There were different types of pre-packaged cream and sugars, including hot sauces, ketchup, and a little egg sign which you can flip over if you need servicing.  Not as ingenious as the button at Korean bbq places, but it works!

Most entrees come with a side of toast or homemade banana nut muffin.  I'm not a big fan of banana nut but my god, theirs is just divine. Spongey, soft, moist, slightly sweet and with just the perfect flavor of fresh banana flavor and a little hint of crunch from the nuts.  The nuts aren't bitter either, as some walnuts can be and it was just pure perfection.

BH and I went a little buckwild (as we always do) and we ordered three dishes: eggs benedict florentine, a half order of corned beef hash, and the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon.  The benedict was awesome and was smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were soft and runny but the English muffin was still crispy and chewy.  The stuffed french toast was pretty good.  BH gobbled up the entire plate whereas I had just a bite or two.  I thought there was too much egg and not enough bacon, but BH told me it was great with maple syrup.  I like sweet meats and breads, but I haven't gotten accustomed to sweet scrambled eggs yet, so I never tried it dipped in sticky sweet maple. Finally, the corned beef hash was very fresh and I could definitely tell it was homemade and not from a can.  The chunks of potato were creamy and starchy while the chunks of meat were flavorful, salty, and a little reminiscent of dog food (but in a good way).  The over easy egg on top made it even more delectable.

Finally, one of the best parts of the meal, besides the banana nut muffin, were their ranch potatoes.  They are roasted to a perfect crunch and seasoned with some sort of red powder - possibly paprika for a bit of smokiness?  They were so damn good, that even past my stuffing point, I kept stabbing at the potatoes so I could get every last bit in my mouth.  Needless to say, BH  and I were nearly bursting by the time we left Egg & I.  I call that a sign of good breakfast and a good start to a day.",XhnK8ABBHQNZGaoZueJccw,0,0,4,2iXMkqJOHSVmSlnUZjQ4KA

Originally my friends and I wanted to eat at Peppermill for brunch before leaving Vegas but the wait for 6 people was over 40 minutes. Called in to check for the wait here and was happy enough to find that we would only have to wait for 20 minutes despite it being packed.

There isn't much space inside for customers to sit while waiting for their table; you'll most likely have to wait outside and that kind of sucks especially in the hot summer weather. When we got seated, we were promptly given the menu and starter drinks. Service here is on point. Karla, our server, went out of her way to make everything as easy as possible for us. Instead of having us go to the front ourselves to split our check, she went ahead and split it six ways for us. I LOVE YOU KARLA.

Food portion here is very generous. You definitely will get the bang for your buck because most of the food items costs $8-$12 and only one person in my group was able to finish his order. Whatever you order, make sure the potatoes are included or order it on the side! There's Cajun seasoning on it, I think, and it's amaaaazing. You won't regret coming here!

The second time I had the chili omelet. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh delicious. They have a meat/no meat option, which is cool. And obviously I opted for the meat option. It was all cooked perfectly.

My favorite item has to be the potatoes though. Perfect little square-cut potatoes that are seasoned with what I can only describe as a mixture of the Red Robin's burger seasoning and tiny little kicks to your mouth. It's spicy but...not, if that makes sense? Probably not. You really just to go in and try.

Some plates come with what they call diabla sauce and it's delicious but beware - they charge $1 for extra.

Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that!

2640095,2010-01-23,17,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I am not a big fan of Rachael Ray, but she doesn't get on my nerves nearly as much as she did when she was all unfiltered perkiness. Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. 

Even though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. 

It honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.

The dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. 

FOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes 
AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming 
SERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning 
TOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one",m07sy7eLtOjVdZ8oN9JKag,14,14,2,YxCnQYU2YY2P4H1fNzUsAg

2676041,2016-06-04,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"So, I've come to the Egg & I on about 7 of my last 8 trips to Vegas after initially discovering it, but this was by far the best service I've had, even though service has been wonderful each and every time. Today, I just wanted to give a couple of shot outs to Brady, the Assistant Manager, and to Jesus, whom I discovered is a 20-yr  employee of the Egg & I. 

Jesus is a busboy. On my last two visits prior to the one I'm writing about (this past Monday, Memorial Day), Jesus has asked me if I needed anything to let him know, which he did again on this visit. Jesus is ALWAYS willing to help, and has gotten me coffee, filled my coffee and even scored me an extra banana nut muffin or two before. Not really his job, as his is to clean tables and make sure their customers have somewhere nice to be seated, but Jesus ALWAYS goes above and beyond what is expected of him to do, and I appreciate his hard work.

Which brings me to Brady, the young Assistant Manager. Brady is definitely young enough to be my little brother. Brady is a genuine, bonafide talker. He shoots the shit with you, but real talk. Not fake talk like I'm only here to make it look like I care about you talk, but good ol' fashioned back and forth banter. He has a tattoo on one of his forearms that says ""Family First"", and Brady made me feel like family! While shooting it with him, I told him that we had just come from Laughlin but had to detour cause one of my wife's uncles fell ill and ended up in the hospital and guess what Brady did? He sent me home with a loaf of their bomb ass banana nut bread to take to my uncle at the hospital since I told him that's where we were heading after breakfast! THANK YOU AGAIN BRADY! I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS!

I'll end this review with a little bit about the food.........my Italiano skillet was on point, AS USUAL. Onion, bell pepper and sausages were all cooked to damn near perfection, it had just the right amount of marinara and cheese that didn't drown or overwhelm, and to be quite honest, have they every messed up a batch of their famous potatoes?",eJBDhJRZhuL49rCNh_QnMQ,0,0,5,8RLNnDPbuJSU4kRH6w0zcA

For my most recent visit I got the Ensenada Burrito and my wife got the Banana Bread French Toast. The Ensenada Burrito was a recommendation from my server Amanda and I'm so glad I listened to her. The burrito was delicious. Tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. Plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call habla diablo seasoned potatoes) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. So good. My wife's french toast was sweet and delicious. The service was top notch. Amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.

Oh, and they have this black/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (Black smiley face = you're ok, Yellow frowny face = need assistant). The staff watches this like hawks. Each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. We were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. It was awesome.

Takes: The best friend and I literally planned our Vegas trip around our meals! She's the breakfast person of the two of us, and she ultimately chose Egg and I of the two places I suggested.

Two words: No regrets!

The corned beef was the homemade, pulled type of thing, and not your typical canned corned beef! The Sundance omelette is your veggie omelette complete with a side of potatoes and your choice between a banana nut muffin or toast. This omelette had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and artichokes. The feta cheese is the one that brings this omelette home! The only downside is that protein is extra; I ordered a small side of corned beef. The potatoes were seasoned (they are on the salty side, but nothing ketchup couldn't counteract). The banana nut muffin came out warm and moist! It definitely was the highlight at first bite! 

Portion size: Large! Both of us took home leftovers! We went from stomach growling to food baby status after our meal.

Service: You flip the egg to the sad one when you need something. Our servers were very friendly and patient. They gave us recommendations on the menu, one even offered us free muffins for our first visit (before the Yelp check in).

Wait Time: immediately seated on a Monday morning

Parking: Shared Lot

Bottom line: Go here for your breakfast fix! It's egg-celent!

First off: check in offer is a banana nut muffin. When it came to the table it was warm and oh my god, so good.  It's gotta be made with some sort of whole wheat or bran flour cuz it's a dark looking muffin.  It's so moist (sorry, had to do it) and dense yet light, sweet but not too much, and just literally the perfect muffin.  

I asked our waitress, Karla, for some coffee and I was treated to my own thermos of it, score! There's a little egg symbol on the table that once it's switched to the other color it signifies that the table needs attending to. Jaime wanted an ice tea refill and flipped the egg over. Within seconds another waitress (Karla was busy) was at our table to help.  What a great team!

I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benny and was so pleased with it! It's two poached eggs on top of a split english muffin, with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and spinach.  The best though was dipping those seasoned potatoes into the hollandaise sauce. They're fried and perfect to dip into a yolk too.

The hash browns we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a Trader Joe's.  My stuffed french toast, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  And the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.

I can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.  For now, our three favorite breakfasts on the West Side remain the Black Bear Diner, Hash House a Go Go, and the buffet at Orleans.",ZmKGF8ZZUo16g2ISrz4ahw,0,0,3,qsyGdrKwCm6w8ePodhGUtg

I am on a low-carb low-sugar diet. But I broke my diet to have their maple bacon French toast, twice!! It is so delicious it is better than a desert. We also ordered the chicken fried steak and chorizo scramble. Everything was delicious. We ordered their potatoes one morning and their fresh fruit the other. Their fresh fruit is wonderfully cut up slices of watermelon and pineapple and other melons. Not the yucky, cheap, cut up fruit that's been sitting there for days.
Their breakfast potatoes are all so delicious. The best way we can describe them is they are  very seasoned bite-size french fries. sooooo goood!

Amanda was incredible! She was polite, friendly, and fast without being pushy! She encouraged us to take our time and when we were not quite sure what to order she offered recommendations which we definitely took and did not regret! The cinnamon roll and banana muffin were also DELICIOUS! 

An elderly impatient man sat himself behind us and after only a minute of being sat was incredibly rude and calling out for a waitress and coffee (despite not waiting to be sat by the hostesses).

Usually the service is pretty good and friendly except when they're super busy.  Then it gets a little quick and snappy.

My friends and I walked in on a Friday afternoon and were seated immediately. The host and servers both gave us a warm welcome. My favorite part of the table set up was their egg signal at the top of their center piece. It was a photo of an egg that you could flip to indicate to servers that you needed something. No one waving your hand to try to get the servers attention, they got a system down!

Next, the food, I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, while my friend customized her scramble with chorizo plus biscuits and gravy.. The bf got some avocado omelette. All were delicious and the portions were huge! It looked like I barley made a dent in my food, but I was stuffed. The biscuits and gravy were probably some of the best I've had... And their banana nut muffins are worth a try for muffin fiends. Straight out of the oven to your table.

I planned to head back to socal early this morning and wanted to be the first one in the restaurant. I arrived at around 5:45 am and fidgeted in my rental car while checking the ""closed sign."" Suddenly another car pulled up next to me, the driver walked out and headed straight into the restaurant - the sign was magically on Open. Wtf... 

The hostess/waitress was so friendly (and at the buttcrack of dawn thats pretty impressive) that I think this partly made me enjoy not only the food but much of the rest of my day.

The front lobby is decorated with articles and reviews AND pictures of eggs in action shots which I found pretty amusing (sometimes it doesnt take much) but the main eating area is pretty diner-y so I kind of zoned out till the food arrived. Ordered the fender bender egg crepe with avocado and sprouts and something else in it and it came out surrounded by a mountain of delicious seasoned potatoes and the softest, freshest muffin i've ever had. The egg crepe is in a league of its own compared with any kind of omelet you can get at IHOP or denny's or some drive by diner. 

I sat there for a good half hour savoring the meal. At the end it was all gone - the muffin, potatoes, egg crepe and the bucket of coffee. For the amount of food I had, it was very very light and felt quite healthy. I didn't get hit by the food coma train on the way home which is a big plus.

As a heavy consumer of all things chicken, I recommend this place to everyone. Unless you don't have taste buds...then go to your local diner where your $4.99 omelet brings you to orgasm every sunday morning. If you have taste buds - go eat here. Pay a little extra. Its worth it. I would guess that this is the best ""cheap"" breakfast i've ever had.",HwmTzORmEfa9HgSfmA0RQw,1,1,5,7WqsZYaflXfaa5Xt2KfZ-A

What a gem to have in Las Vegas, definitely one of the best breakfast spots I've ever had. After looking up a few places, ie. Denny's, Hash House a Go Go, we decided to come here even though it's off the strip. We took a Lyft from Venetian and the ride was only $11. 

With a party of 10, we thought that the wait would be around an hour, hour and a half, but amazingly, it was only thirty minutes. If you are coming here though, expect a long wait, so be patient, but it's worth the wait! Once we got seated, they handed us menus which looks like a daily newspaper. Deciding what to eat here was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make since there are 8 pages of food to read. Took a while but I finally decided on the Santa Cruz Skillet. 

Santa Cruz Skillet: The order came with toast and butter (since I got the muffin with the check-in) and sunny-side up eggs. The potatoes, chorizo, Santa Cruz sauce and the runny yolk was probably the best breakfast you could ask for after a night of drinking. Portion-wise, you could easily share this with another person but I was able to finish it on my own. 

Service was amazing throughout the meal, they have a system where you flip the happy egg to a sad egg whenever you need something, genius! I would have subtracted a star for them bringing out the 2 Bloody Mary's and Michelada after we almost finished the food, but they didn't charge us for the drinks in the end.

I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...

Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it!

I was able to try the combo meat skillet, beef hash skillet, and the stuffed french toast. Everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but I think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.

One thing that stood out was their banana nut muffin. Choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. This was the only thing that was better than anywhere else I have tried. I'm not a big fan of BNut, but if it tasted like the ones here, I would choose it every time.

That is how I found this place, while doing some car shopping all morning and finally getting so desperate for food we ventured down the road. Not somewhere you think you find a great breakfast place. Or so I thought.

You walk into what feels like a family style diner greeted by a cute older woman who reminded me of my own grandma. Always a plus.

Get seated and scope out the menu, 
lots of great options for omelets. We loved Canadian bacon or what my boyfriend likes to call bacon from Canada, ordered that. Preferred the waffles over the pancakes. (Learned that from my first trip there.) Order two orders of skillet potatoes (one for me and one for Adam.) They are literally that good. Each bite is a perfectly seasoned little bite of french fry / hash brown combination. Fruit platter with your choice of three berries. Lots of orange juice because I'm a sucker for pulp and vitamin c to start out my day.

Egg & I is located off strip, east of the 15 off of the sahara exit. its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. there is indoor and outdoor seating. there were a few people waiting when we arrived but we were quickly seated. the place was full with a few tables empty. we were expecting to wait but it was already about 10AM by the time we went. 

i ordered the strawberry and cream french toast which was thick slices of soft french toast with a strawberry whipped cream cheese and strawberry preserves on top. it was pretty good. i liked that it wasnt too sweet like most french toast/waffles with fruit toppings at other restaurants.

the bf ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. it had green chili, onions and salsa. i thought it was gonna be sausage type of chorizo but it was the ground kind. if you've ever cooked or bought it at the market you know what im talking about. when you cook it, it pretty much just melts. so the skillet was as if it had chili on top. it was pretty heavy and greasy. i could probably do without the chorizo next time.

the bfs bro ordered the country fried steak skillet. this had chopped chunks of country fried steak with their homestyle potatoes and eggs with white gravy on top. it was pretty good. it tasted just like a regular country fried steak plate but all chopped up for you, if you dont mind your food touching (i know some people who dont, like my 5 yr old nephew...).

bfs bro's fiance ordered the stuffed french toast. this was two pieces of their thick sliced fluffy french toast with an omelet in between. the eggs had lots of bits of bacon in it which made it tasty but it was pretty firm. i felt like it was over cooked. maybe it was all the cheese. it tasted good though. it tasted good with either the syrup and/or ketchup. sweet or savory, whichever you prefer. 

we had also had a side of the banana nut muffin, which was pretty good. it was large on top. it wasnt too sweet which was nice. it came out moist and warm. yum!

We found this place from one of those Vegas pamphlets they hand out with a 2 for 1 coupon in it. 

And by the looks of all the other reviews, I would say that everyone knows about this place too. It was packed when we showed up. 

I got the corn beef hash with two eggs over easy and their banana nut muffin. The corn beef was fresh and their banana nut muffin was really good! Now I see shy they were famous for them. The ranch potatoes were a little too salty for my taste. They need to tone it down on the salt and then they would be really good but really didn't eat them 
because I felt my blood pressure go through the roof! lol.. 
My BF had the Chicken omelet and he gave me a bite and it was really de-lish especially if you are an avocado freak because there was a ton of avocado stuffed in the omelet.

3067609,2017-09-25,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Very good breakfast place on Sahara! I've ate here many many times and give them a solid 4 overall. 

Gets a little busy so don't go in a hurry but I like this place a lot. I want to give them a 5 star so maybe I could update later if some minor things change.

Checkout line gets pretty long almost every time so they need 2 cashiers or a faster system.

It takes awhile to get seated sometimes but they did update the seating list so you can get a text when your table is ready. It gives you an estimate on how long the wait will be.  Our quote said 15 minute wait to get seated but it was 21 min, it was a group of 6 during busy time so not bad and that was the longest I have waited.

Food is pretty good, chorizo burrito and mashed potato omelette are very edible. 

I really wish they wouldn't give you so many of those weird potatoes though. They are pretty good but not good enough to finish or take home, so almost every customer is sure to throw away a lot, my guess is they through away a few hundred pounds of potatoes every single day because no one finishes them. I would recommend they give you half the amount of potatoes and some fruit which would be so much easier on the stomach and make the meals a little less boring. 

I do recommend to stop by and give this place a try though. I will certainly be back soon.

There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.   

They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.

This lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. We drove a few miles to go to Egg and I simply because I wanted to try it based on the great Yelp reviews.
We were not disappointed. Everything was great for my first time ever eating here.
We walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a Thursday lunch hour. There were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office.
I went with the ""This Little Piggy"" omelet and it was just the way I like it. Lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. It comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! Also comes with the country potatoes which I was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. Don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than I like em. Also I got the banana nut muffin with my meal, (this thing WAS OUT-friggen-STANDING) and she brought it out before the meal, which I thought to be a little strange. But i was really hungry so it was just fine with me.
My honey got a breakfast burrito and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. Had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes.
This was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. We were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. After she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. In the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :)

The wait wasn't as long as Hash House...it was only about 15 minute for an outside table. The menu is huge and appealing that none of us could make up our minds on what to order. Eventually we did, 2 friends got the eggs Benedict and pancakes, another got the steak and eggs with rice and I got the spinach and avocado omelet with fruits and I shared the strawberry creme french toast with a friend. The ambiance is like any ordinary breakfast joint with that ""home"" and ""granny's house"" feeling. 

Everyone loved their foods, but it was so much that they couldn't finish it except for my friend who got the steak and eggs. I for one cold not even eat half of my food, regardless of how delicious it is....and I can eat a whole lot. I loved that my omelet was full of fresh huge slices of avocado and spinach inside my omelet. The fruits were fairly fresh and sweet. My whole plate cost me about $118 with tip so not bad considering I had a yummy Easter omelet, fruits and a huge delicious stack of french toast.

We arrived at about 11 for a late breakfast and the place was packed. Which is typically a good sign, but it looked borderline at capacity. Moving on, we opted to sit on the patio and it was a great choice! They had misters that added a great touch and I enjoyed people watching! Only tip would be if you don't like pets don't come out here. It's a pet friendly area and in addition to a few dogs Mother Nature's pets attended... there was a fair amount of pigeons. Almost unsanitary because they'd get really close and flap off leaving all sorts of pigeon germs in the air. The restaurant can consider enclosing the area with that garden wood or something that would keep it a bit more sanitary. 

Moving on to the food. I felt first off there's way too much going on with the menu. Pictures, eggs , burritos, omelettes, chili, pancakes, and everything is served a thousand ways! I was overwhelmed. Thankfully my baby just learned to read and knew he wanted waffles! I on the other hand ordered half a bacon and avocado omelette and a side of corned beef hash! 

At best, the food was ok. The omelette was well cooked but the amount of avocado was overwhelming, a shock because usually you don't receive enough. The bacon was non existent because of the overwhelming avocado. The hash was mushy. I'd read it in another review and thought impossible, but the flavor was good, but the texture was similar to that of fried stringy mashed potatoes.  I will brag my baby's waffle was delicious, fluffy, and crispy! I'd come back for the waffles and the bacon!",u6OIc9ndbqrd6fO_jU2xcw,3,2,3,taUpH1mJQOcS8r-qATJbmw

First, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.

The Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.

Then there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.

The Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.

I really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.

The service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.

The breakfast menu is one of the most diverse that I've ever encountered. 4-egg omelettes and scrambles seem to be the rule in Las Vegas. The Egg & I omelettes were delicious and loaded with cheese. We had a veggie omelette and a veggie scramble. The potatoes were seasoned just right. Reading prior Yelp reviews beforehand, I doubted that the banana nut muffins could live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. Excellent. Fluffy and not too heavy on the banana. Prepare for a large crowd and a wait on the weekend. The hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. The bus staff too.

Food took a while to come too but it's understandable since they were busy. 
Our server Oscar, was awesome though. He was very attentive and seemed like a chill dude. When they forgot to bring out my friends muffin that was included in his meal, Oscar apologized and brought out a plate full of muffins so that we could all try :) really appreciated it ! 
Food was also pretty good and satisfyingly filling. 
I got the rib eye Benedict and it was pretty good. Also came with a side of potatoes that were seasoned real well. Great brunch place to eat in Vegas !",25LBfv-Lp-KmiQhql33UTw,0,0,4,2O9p1kBCqNfN2VIeEwZ9Qw

We arrived and the line was out the door at 11:30am on a Saturday morning...granted it was St. Paddy's Day weekend, but I think it would have been just as long any other time.

We waited for a table for about 15 minutes. Not bad considering the line. Once seated, I checked into Egg & I, and I got a free Banana Nut Muffin. OMG!!!!!  THE BEST BANANA NUT MUFFIN EVER!  And that was just the beginning of our glorious dining experience.

Let's talk about Victoria. She's dynamite. You'll want her to be your bestie just as we all did.  She is so personable and friendly and funny and I could go on and on. She was so attentive, our glasses were never empty...even the Bloodies! She gave us her recommendations and we were NOT disappointed. 

Between us, we had omelettes, stuffed french toast, waffle w/banana, coconut and toffee and a mexican skillet. As I said before, we were not disappointed. 

If this place came to California, we would definitely make the trek wherever it lands. I HIGHLY recommend Egg and I...and their BANANA NUT MUFFIN!

We placed an order for pick up because I had a feeling it was going to be packed, and I guess I'm psychic. That also means I won't be commenting on service as much as it wouldn't be fair. 

The bomb:
I ordered the mashed potato omelette. Seems to be a favorite. Easy to see why. The omelette itself was very tasty and flavorful. The potatoes were also delicious af. It also came with sour cream that made it even more delicious af. 
It deserves its own line. The banana nut muffin. It's amazing. Ditch the toast. Be brave and go for the muffin. 
My mom had the veggie crepe. It was also amazing. I have a big thing for avocados and there was plenty of avocado up in here. Highly recommended. 
The chocolate chip pancake was great as well. Not too sweet, not too bland. Just right. 

The bad:
If you're planning to eat inside, be prepared to wait. But honestly. That's it.

3326195,2010-11-05,5,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Let's be honest here: the whole Vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  Yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  And how much do you want to eat every single morning?  Don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an ""I live to bingo"" sweater?

If you do, take a short drive down W. Sahara Ave to Egg and I.  You will not be disappointed.  Inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, Egg and I provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of The Strip.

By now you're probably wondering what ""Egg"" looks like.  Well, Egg looks kind of like Humpty Dumpty, and ""I"" looks just like ""Egg.""  Just look on their website.  Might as well call the whole place ""2 Eggs,"" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  

We came in around 9:30 am on Saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  We got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  We had just gotten into town, and I was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  You'd better believe I took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  Even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.

We couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  Also, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.

There was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  The Ultimate Skillet is not for the weak...that much I know.  A generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a Cajun flavor to it.  Paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and delicious.  The Ultimate Skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions and cheese.  The skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  WOW.  

We also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, I wasn't hankering for a pancake.  I did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  I was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  On any other day, I can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the Ultimate Skillet proved to be a bit much.  Order at your own risk.  That's a LOT of food for $9.95.

My friend had the eggs plus, which looked yummy, and a banana nut muffin that everyone raves about - it was awesome.  Their ranch potatoes are also amazing, like eating tiny square-shaped french fries.
Everything is so well-priced.  We paid $26 including tip for both of us, and considering I had an orange juice, I'd say that's pretty great.",gqimocAPnvr9V-YjYhfElg,0,0,5,5VxeV3KmUti1Lff0PwLujA

I went with a ham and cheese omelette and the person I was with had the pancakes.  We each had a banana nut muffin as well.  All was cooked to perfection and portions were huge.  My omelette came with home fries and all was delicious and perfect for the post Vegas night.  I tried the pancakes and they were great as well.  The banana nut muffin is a must try.

Service: 5 stars - the server was great and took really good care of us.

I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. This turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. The CFS itself was good, as were the potatoes. The eggs were eggs.

There is a reason why this breakfast restaurant finds itself on all the online lists of places to eat in Las Vegas, it is delicious! Mainly, the habla diablo seasoned potatoes. Order a skillet, and these potatoes will be nestled among your skillet choices. You won't find these anywhere else, and they are worth ordering! They sound spicey, but they aren't too bad, they just have a slight kick with the seasoning, but nothing that is going to make your mouth run hot.

I have tried several other dishes, and they are all great, but don't stand out much above other top breakfast places. The portions are nice sized, and you are going to get your American breakfast standard fare, no weird or fancy twists to the meals you know and love. They do have mimosas.

The ambiance is not my favorite. It is bright and the tables are pretty close to each other. The walls have farming murals painted on them, but it's not the most comfortable dining experience. The chairs and tables are pretty old and slightly worn.

With our Yelp check-in, we each received a free banana nut muffin, which was REALLY tasty. I ordered the Vegetarian Benedict (with bacon) and my husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and Blueberry Pancakes. My Benedict was really, really good, but I will say their hollandaise is seriously lacking in lemon juice. It didn't seem like an authentic hollandaise at all, but it tasted good. They know how to poach an egg beautifully, which made up for the sauce. The breakfast potatoes that come with every entree are very flavorful and crispy. My husband really liked his biscuits & gravy (he said the biscuits were very light and fluffy), but the pancakes were a huge bust for both of us. They were way too dense - the texture was pretty awful. I'm assuming that's how all their pancake batter is, so I'd hard pass on pancakes there. 
It was fun to venture off the Strip, but we'll probably stick with breakfast elsewhere in the future. HOWEVER, they offer an extremely generous military discount of 30%, which we appreciated.

We told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  Hope that's true and I'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.  

I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly seasoned potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed the dish, but there was so much Hollandaise sauce that the English muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  It was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  It almost tasted canned or something.  I took the ham off and it was much better that way.  However, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  My sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  This might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  We both loved the muffins though.  That very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.  

Despite the rubbery ham, I'd definitely come back.  The service was excellent and I feel confident that we'll both be able to find other dishes on the menu that suit us better.  Plus.... those banana nut muffins!  You'd be a fool not to try one.",_seDuTbNHvRq9P4cFRmf-A,0,0,3,KpJl8ZQAw_KAcutkgCbA6A

The place was packed and it was 1 p.m. on a Monday!  The average breakfast is about 10 bucks and 3 more for coffee. I would say sharing is a must!!! The omelets were super cheesy but tasty. The Cajun potatoes are awkwardly addicting. At first bite they taste over seasoned with cajun powder but by the end of it you will wish you had more. The banana nut muffin comes with your entree or free check in on foursquare. It's definitely not the best muffin int he world like others claim, but it is tasty. However, eat it hot or it might taste dry. And eat it with the butter then its perfection. Overall with sharing, free extra muffin, and two iced coffees and tip it was 23 dollars. Don't know if I will be back as there is too many other places to try.",-3bLjPXl6wvqS0ceGQ0s7w,0,0,4,YT4uYQcWZsDEfSc2Be7Xbg

The second visit was this past weekend with my parents and brother and sister in law.  Food and service were both fantastic.  I had the chicken and chorizo breakfast burrito, while others enjoyed the cordon bleu skillet, a chorizo skillet, a french dip sandwich with cajun fries and an eggs benedict.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, which was brought very quickly given how packed the place was - talk about an efficient kitchen.  Our cups (water and coffee) never ran dry and the waiter struck the perfect balance between leaving us be to enjoy our meals and making sure we got what we need.

3449203,2013-11-27,2,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"A groupon and good reviews lead me to try this place in Vegas. Normally, I do not go off the strip to eat. I don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when I went though, around 11am. It took about 30 minutes or so for a table. Looking at the menu, LOTS of stuff looked good and I had trouble deciding what to eat. The menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which I thought was cleaver. I ended up getting the chicken fried steak skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. Both did taste good, but I did not think it was spectacular. Portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. My chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. I mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, I couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. I think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. I'm a total potato lover and I couldn't finish my potatoes. My skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. I chose the muffin. It was good-average. I tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but I'm not a big Mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. His did not come with a muffin or toast though. I also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup I see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...

Personally, I think Hash House A Go-Go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! My brother agrees with me too. 

I don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. Just an average breakfast place. Prices are fair... my chicken fried skillet was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11. 

Go to Hash House A Go-Go if you want special yummy breakfast food... this place is just average.",4AYfs8d7M2H4TBEiHhHTdQ,3,1,3,AGTFxRCgWVziLFeLNigk0A

She was so nice and attentive, with a cheerful disposition even tho she was so busy. And she brought my husband his free muffin even tho he was having trouble with his yelp app to check in. He did eventually but was very happy that she did that, cause that muffin, oh that muffin....I think it's the best banana nut muffin I've had in my life, and I've had my share! Lol...my husband had 3 of the blueberry pancakes w/a side of bacon. He enjoyed his meal but didn't even touch his bacon because the pancakes are a pretty decent size with fresh blueberries in the pancake and on the side was a blueberry jam sauce? It was sweet just as he likes it. I'm not a huge pancake fan so I don't make it much at home so he was happy. I ordered the chile rellenos omelette and I'm so glad I did!  I saw someone's picture of it and thought it looked good!  It was!  The sauce was tasty and everything just worked so well together with the pepper...

My cousin told me about the Egg & I.  Boy am I glad that he did.  The food was really good.  There was a 10-15 minute wait but did not compare to those monstrous lines in the casino hotels.  

After glancing through their newspaper styled menu, I decided to have a four egg omelette.  Which was more than delicious when it arrived.  Accompanying this wonderful omelette was their famous ranch potatoes.  These bad boys were orgasmic good.  They were seasoned with some spices that gave it a lil bit of a kick.  But if you aren't into spicy then I advise you put some ketchup on them to dull the fire.  All in all the meal was delicious.

The service was pretty good as well.  They have a system where there is a napkin holder and on top are two pictures of eggs.  If you need some assistance then you just flip the egg to yellow.  Now I may be butchering the explanation of this process but long story short the wait staff is very attentive and helpful.

So give it a shot if you are tired of long buffet lines.  It also gives you a chance to see the other parts of Vegas.",RvCdpmzszrsbUWnrleCVMA,0,0,4,AyE-S4gF76j31YogxCMfzw
3456992,2018-01-08,12,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"On New Year's Eve morning on 12/31/2017 during my New Year's weekend vacation in Vegas, I visited to this anticipated local diner called, ""Egg & I."" Egg & I serves the customers of all ages to taste their finest quality American diner cuisines from breakfast to lunch every 365 days a year! The atmosphere is very calming and active as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to a local American diner although it has a country feel decors across the whole interior room especially their outdoor patio too.

The employees here from servers, hosts and cookers are doing a great job for making the customers like me a tremendous friendly service despite the busiest environment. No cons.

Now onto the food! I ordered the Works Omelette with a side of country fried potato cube-lets. As I ate it, that omelette tasted very good! The fillings inside from proteins (i.e. ham) plus assortments of fresh veggies both tasted flawless and elegant! It seasoned very well and neatly both inside and outside of the omelette's eggs. Also, the country fried potatoes worked as a charm. It baked and cooked properly well without being overbaked. Finally, I did tried their signature baked goods item: the Banana Nut muffin, and as a result, it tasted outstanding! It baked fresh and warm which I did felt and ate the nutty banana flavors of that muffin! Yummy!

There's plenty of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. If it gets busy, you can bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.

In the end, Egg & I is the most amazed and interstellar local American style diner restaurant that I've ever visited and discovered all thanks to my Yelp app while hanging out in Vegas.

We had breakfast there twice over a recent trip to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My first meal was the Ultimate Skillet. Bring a large appetite! My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were so tasty and fresh. I also enjoyed their sourdough toast. It was thick, flavorful, and buttery! The dish was so yummy and substantial.  It kept me going until late in the afternoon. My wife had the Bacon, Avocado, & Cheese omelette. She loved it. It was cooked to perfection; a uniform yellow color and cooked evenly through.  It was loaded with lots of avocado.  She said that it was maybe the best she's ever had. Wow!

I had to cut back on my next visit. I ate too much on the first one, although I really enjoyed it (trying to be good in Vegas???). I ordered the Eggs-Plus with ham. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right.  The ham was good. It was not dry, chewy or too salty. The potatoes were also good.

The feta cheese on top which I was concerned about was fantastic. I think that might have actually been the best part. I really really enjoyed it. My husband's dish was equally delicious. I was worried there would be too much salsa, but not at all. The side of potatoes were a touch salty. I would have preferred just a little less seasoning however, everything was really really good.

Shoulda went with the crowd and got the Eggs-cellent Omelette. Kay's Special caught my eye cause it sounded like spinach artichoke dip but made into omelette form. It was really tasty but the 3 Eggs-cellent Omelettes at the table kept overshadowing my dish. But that was my fault and not the fault of Egg & I. 

Potatoes were completely covered in a paprika type spice blend. It made them really dry. A good dousing of ketchup cured the dryness.

This breakfast joint is cute, welcoming and homey. It gets pretty packed during the weekends, especially with big parties, so be prepared to wait! But if anything, the food is worth the wait.

The selection of different types of dishes included dozens of omelettes done all kinds of ways, eggs benedict, eggs florentine, egg crepes, skillets, and i could go on and on because they also have sandwiches, french toast, and seriously I can go on.. 

I got the ham and mushrooms skillet with blue berry muffin. The muffin was moist and fresh! The skillet was their infamous ranch potatoes topped with ham and mushrooms with a layer of melted cheeses and two eggs done however you liked. Honestly, it looked super huge and I thought I would not finish it, but it was so good I annihilated that sucker!  My friend tried the ultimate skillet which had ham, bacon,  sausage and other goodies, but he said that it was waaaay too many things going on in one dish. So unless you like something super hearty and packed, try the ultimate skillet, if not, choose one or two ingredients to put into it.

Service was super friendly and kind. On the table there are these flip cards with a happy and sad face. Put up your happy face is your party is doing fine, but if you need anything put up the sad face and a server will attend to you quickly.

Hub's scramble (prime rib) had some tough meat. My chicken fried steak was ok.  Here's the catch.  It was ALL salted so heavily that we couldn't finish anything.  The potatoes were coated with an orange, seasoned salt, the gravy could have easily floated a ship. My two scrambled eggs, which HAD to actually be four because they covered half the huge place, were browned and chewy. I ate the steak after scraping off the gravy.
I've never eaten in a restaurant where the food was uniformly Over Salted. Since I have high blood pressure, this was extra-problematic for me.",22nmHXez6iDb9P_pAJs5dA,1,0,2,OjJiSwlsidZNeS_S6PNbyg

TIP: If you check in through Yelp, you get free of the delicious, moist Banana Nut Muffin. (Do it! It's worth it.)

Be prepared to wait in line before seated, ALWAYS busy. So don't come here starving because you'll end up hAngry. 

FOOD: I love everything I ordered from this place. Oh, if you eat like a bird, share The food with someone because they serve big portions. (My son and BF always finish their plates though.)

They also have rice plates, 3 choices, Hawaiin style. YUM!

DRINkS: Mimosa is not unlimited. But soft drinks and coffee are. Also if you order juice, they'd give you a carafe.

PRICE: decent price. They accept Amex. Pay at the cashier once you receive your receipt. 

RESTROOM: small but clean. 

SPACE: big space, good for groups. They also have outdoor seating.

Although when we pulled up I was doubtful, I held faith in my Yelp brethren--and I'm so glad I did. We were seated immediately for a group of 5 at 1pm on a Sunday, but that was just luck as it was a full house. 

The menu is huge and a little overwhelming because there are so many options, but I finally settled on the Huevos Rancheros with carnitas, both sauces, and breakfast potatoes. I also used the Yelp check-in for a free banana nut muffin, and she kindly brought one for each of us at the table! The muffin is so moist--we're talking stick to your fingers moist. Our meal came relatively quickly and there was silence among the table as we all dug in. The huevos rancheros were probably among the best I've ever had. It came with so much carnitas and melted cheese--it was exactly what we needed after two days of Vegas, if you catch my drift. I was wary of the breakfast potatoes initally; I'm a hash browns girl precisely because breakfast potatoes are often underseasoned. Not the case here in the slightest. Each nugget was a little crispy, but soft on the inside and packed tons of flavor. The portions are huge though, so keep in mind when you're ordering! I split the huevos rancheros and it was more than enough for two!

My friend got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were also very delicious, but super thick and rich so not what my dehydrated body was in the mood for. Gimme dat salt!

Got hooked up on banana nut muffins with the check in. Deliciously moist and flavorful. 

So when deciding to order my buddy and i couldnt decide between the chile relleno omlete and the a south west type of omlete.. so we decided to order both and split it. Ya i know l, totally adorable.

Must say the chile relleno is soooooo good. Definitely filling and hit all the right marks. Not many places can make a good chile relleno entre, alertos is the only place in oc, imo, but eggs and i got it right.

The south west type was also a good omlete. Definitely tasted the different components but it was not as awe strucking as the chile relleno omlete.

Other things ordered at the table was a ""1/2"" order of maple bacon french toast had a special type of syrup as well. This plate was a good addition to the overall meal. 

The gf ordered a carrot cake french toast. She said it was ok in comparison to the chile relleno omlete *cough cough*. But i need to be hoenst besides loving chile rellenos.. i love carrot cake! It was moist, similar texture as the banan nut muffin and with bits of carrots enough for texture. Definitely a fan.

The eggs benedict are our favorite here (totally smothered with Hollandaise).  FYI - They serve their ""Diablo Potatoes"", but change to Hash Browns or unseasoned potatoes if ordering for kids or watching sodium (The Diablo version appears to be just a ton of seasoned salt added.)

Excellent & friendly service!

This place was super popular on Yelp and won so many local awards, we were forced to check it out. Arrived early afternoon, there was pretty much no wait, even though there were some customers lingering near the entrance inside and the place was still full! Service was extremely down-to-earth, friendly, and attentive!

This place has a huge menu (in the form of a ""newspaper""...if that gives you some idea). There were so many choices it was really hard to decide on just one =( The variety is vast, but the bulk of the items were simple, straightforward, typical breakfast dishes with unique modifications/twists or add-ons. My husband's chile relleno omelet was such a great idea for an omelet...the juicy chile and the cheese tasted amazing wrapped in egg! My benedict's garden (vegetarian version of egg's benedict) was superb as well. Even though one of the items listed in my dish was guacamole, I was SO pleasantly surprised when it arrived NOT as guacamole, but pretty much a whole avocado sliced up!!! You don't get that often, even in California! +10 points for that! The whole combination of poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and avocado was such a delicious creamy mix, and perfectly-balanced by the crisp freshness of the tomatoes. I basically devoured it in under 5 minutes...and then had to wait for the husband to finish his plate *rolls eyes.* We both agreed that their seasoned potatoes were freaking AMAZING. We don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it reminded us of Cajun and it was to die for. I wish they sold it by the bottle!
 
Wonderful place, with reasonable prices (total with tax came out to be $27) and a great cup of coffee as well. The awesome staff makes it even better!",7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,0,0,4,Mo1WcT1S2kRB_fDW0vq3dA
3716217,2011-08-26,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I really don't understand the hype with this place and why it is so packed. 
The food is mediocre and the portions are so large that it's unhealthy. The service is also pretty bad. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a  with unraveled silverware and a five dollar bill still sitting on the table. She gave us our menu's and left the money awkwardly sitting there. 

When we finally got to put in our orders our waitress recommended that we take a half portion of our cheese, egg and veggie skillet breakfast dish and I'm so glad she did. The half portion was like a full portion and I could barely finish it, as it had so much thick sticky cheese on top. Also, the seasoning that they put on the potatoes tastes exactly like Dorritos and I felt like I was eating potato chips (not in a good way). 

Also I just wanted to note something that happened while were waiting for our food to come. The waitress hastily sat us at a 5 top (it was just my bf and I). A family of 5 came in about 10 minutes after us and she tried to sit them in the table next to us which could not accommodate anymore than 4 people. She grabbed a chair from our table to try and seat them there, but the family was really unhappy, it was especially awkward as we were sitting at the only table that could fit them. She then moved them somewhere to the other side of the room. I saw the family leave a few minutes later out of frustration. 

The food is really just standard fare, nothing to write home about. On top of that it's incredibly unhealthy. I understand that Vegas has very little breakfast joints, but I would rather make my own omelet at home. Your health will be better for it.",7sIOrRxlCfMpz3l-Bz27ug,1,0,2,eh00TUOj79rTtgsIahZ1BQ

I'm so glad I took a group of 10 of my girlfriends here at the end of our Vegas trip. The portions were humungous and I had to challenge myself to finish my plate. Yes, the banana nut muffins do live up to its hype!! So delicious and so fresh. Most plates actually come with the banana nut muffin as an option, but they'll give you another one if you check in!

Their menu is EXTENSIVE. So if you are an indecisive person like I am, it'd probably help kill your wait time if you take a look at that menu to decide what you want! They offer breakfast sandwiches, french toast, egg bennys, OMELETTES, specialties, and more. I went for the chile relleno omelette and I'm SO glad I did! It wasn't too saucy and the sauce they offer is super good. Their POTATOES. SO GOOD. Thank god they let me get half potatoes half fruit, because the full portion of potatoes is HUGE! 

My girlfriends and I all ordered different items on everyone enjoyed their meal :) I would say you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Definitely coming again to end a Vegas trip.

The Egg & I is largely an antithesis to what ""Vegas"" stands for. It is low key, low on panache, and reasonably priced.

I've been here now a couple of times, all in the winter and early spring months, which means I'm always on the patio, because for me 70 + degrees is perfect patio weather. The inside does seem a little bit packed for my taste, regardless of what time they're open. On the weekends, you'd be hard pressed to find a time when it's not poppin here. But that's okay, I assure you it's worth the wait.

The menu is expansive. I'm talking, there is something for everyone. Hashes, Omelettes, Scrambles, Sweets, Benedict, even some rogue brunch items which are surprisingly good in their own right. But by and large, breakfast here is the way to go. Anything with their namesake, eggs, is an automatic winner. Portions are on the larger side, but not obscenely so. You're going to walk away full, but not sickly so, which is the perfect storm breakfast in my eyes. If you're a coffee fan like myself, it flows freely here and is pretty damn good. Overall, I really like this place and would recommend it for locals and tourists alike.

Other benefits include: parking situation is easy to navigate, food itself is reasonably priced.

Located right off the strip, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat without hassling with the nearby hotels.  The prices are reasonable and they have a huge menu to choose from.  Even the pickiest of eaters have something to pick, no matter how difficult they might be.

It's a country style restaurant with a variety of egg dishes.  My favorite is the Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce is creamy and perfect and it's paired with some seasoned potatoes.  I like them, but they aren't my favorite.

I know others have given it 5 stars but I only tried it once and had the corn beef and hash it was good, different then I'm use to.  I wouldn't reorder it however.  Its not like its from a can or anything, its shredded ham and the flavor is different then what I believe Hash should taste like  The Banana Nut muffin was pretty good, but again I have had better.  The servers are nice and the place is adorable.  

However if you want your Socks knocked of for breakfast go to the Hash House A Go Go, its a little further West up Sahara and on the right.  That place has the best breakfast I have ever had.
Overall I must say Egg & I is a good place.  A  decent breakfast, however for egg critiques take a look at the pictures, unless you order an eggs Benny they over cook most of there eggs.",ZcDziqYB6gqnBkfdkQazuw,0,0,3,8p2KshmApoebUnBZUYozow

Got the Santa Cruz Burrito- NICE! Filling was scrambled eggs, chicken, and other 'yummy-ness', tasty, great home-fries. Only $10 with lots of coffee.
Great portions, excellent flavor. Good comfort food. Everything that my friends ordered looked great. They loved theirs as well.

He ordered EGGS BENEDICT.  It was served in a baking dish so I guess the restaurant feel compelled to fill it with sauce.  It was completely drenched in ""Hollandaise"" if you could even call it that.  It was creamy and yellow, yes.  But there was no butter taste, or lemon.

FYI: the Ranch Potatoes are diced taters completely drenched in Lawry's seasoned salt and they use it anywhere potatoes might be needed.  The result is ..seasoned salt EVERYWHERE!

1) Linnea went above and beyond when it came to serving. When we order she would ask additional questions like, would you like flavored creamers? And give additional recommendations towards the food choices.

2) Linnea would always check on us and see if we were doing good, always having a cheerful welcoming smile on her face and the way she talked made us feel very welcomed.

3) When there was a slight mistake, because my friend ordered steak and instead of eggs they wanted an omelet, which never happened before and Linnea brought out my stuff French toast and apologize for the confusion and mishap, that the steak was cooked inside the omelet and apologize for the confusion and wait... Which we didn't even wait long. About 3 minutes the steak and omelet was brought out immediately. Still apologizing... It didn't matter too much to us and for the fact that they were sincerely sorry. Wow what exceptional service. 

4) I was going to stop at 3, but since Linnea went above, she not only brought us our check but a ""sorry"" gift of banana bread wrapped and gifted nicely. I was shocked to see such service!!!

Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper! 

Chicken Omelet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum! 

Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.

Banana Nut Muffin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!

Eggs Florentine (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!

Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee. 

Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D",JnGjZVSlfCkKHErvO5ts4g,18,13,5,825VMohqasiMqUE0EoRazw

We didn't know we should have called ahead to be placed on ""the list"". So our estimated wait time for amy seating for 2 was 45 minutes. We gave our info and waited for our turn to be seated. 
We observed the hostess be informed several times there were multiple open tables for 2, 3, or 4 guests. Yet she didn't send messages to the waiting customers until she was told by multiple people several times about the open tables. 
After we were seated our server was good. She gave us enough time to look at the menu and place our orders.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and I had a savory crepe (I don't know the name). Our food came out fairly quickly for how busy the place was. Husband said his food was great. Mine was okay. I was thinking the turkey was going to be cubed not shredded. The guacamole inside the crepe was good. The spicy potato cubes that came on the side were good.  Only real bummer about the service was that the bloody Mary I ordered never came out. Our server realized this about the time I was finishing my food.

When driving into the strip mall I noticed the abundance of cars and line outside right away. We didn't have to wait too long, about 20 minutes and the staff was friendly, and the coffee was really good.... I don't know what they put in it, but it was waay better than the average coffee. 

My boyfriend had the pancakes and they were fluffy and flavorful, I was somewhat disappointed in my artichoke frittata...The feta cheese was overpowering and seemed like an afterthought dumped on top and I ended up scraping most of it off. It was a daily special item, so it wasn't on the main menu. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas and try one of the basic menu items such as pancakes or omelets, all of the other dishes being brought out looked great... they had good intentions with the frittata but it was less than desirable....

The chili is normally had over spaghetti with mounds of cheese and for those of you that have no one to maks out with,  get it with onions and beans.  Yummy!  During this trip I decided to go low carb and get the chili over an omelette and of course bacon.

Most of the dishes here come with theIr seasoned country fries.  They are delicious.   Since I'm a fry connoisseur,  I can really appreciate these delicious cubed and fried pieces of carbs.",r0tJtR8mIq8TVC3ZMD2rOA,1,1,3,hmJ8I7fV5DuUTyvrOri83Q

I got the Benedict's Garden, a vegetarian Eggs Benedict.  It came with English muffin halves on the bottom, then sliced grilled tomatoes, some avocado, and topped (the menu says smothered which is close) with Hollandaise.  There were potatoes and a side of some fresh fruit.  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was the special of the day.

Everything was really good.  My eggs and the mixture of avocado and tomato with the Hollandaise was quite good.  The breakfast potatoes were really flavorful and the small slice of canteloupe and fresh pineapple was like having a dessert at breakfast.

I'm trying to grin and bare it, when the cashier dashes off without a word to get her manager, because she doesn't actually know the cost of said side of tomatoes.

The omelet itself was very tasty, the muffin, while not as heavenly as some others claim, was indeed very moist and tasty and worth a try. The potato that came was what made my day. The fried squared shaped potato was crispy on the outside, but still mushy on the inside! Such a delight!

We went on a Saturday and we got seated right away, no wait.  But as we left, there was a line and that was around 1:00pm. I love corn beef hash and so I had to try their corn beef hash.  It came with eggs and toast (can choose muffin instead of toast) and if you check in on yelp you get a free banana muffin.  Our waitress forgot ours but we didn't make a big deal about it.  Corn beef hash was shredded style and I thought it was below par.  Not the best corn beef.  The place reminded me of another Dennys. Dennys being better.

It is a comfortable atmosphere and friendly service.  This is a popular restaurant, and we went on a Saturday morning, thus we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. It took a while for us to decide on what to order because everything (they had quite a variety of choices on the menu) sounded so appetizing.  After we finally ordered, our food came out quickly, and everyone was pleased w/ each of our orders.  Everything looked very good and tasted great too.    

It's not located that far away from the Vegas Strip, and it's definitely worth the short drive.  It's also a nice getaway from the chaos and traffic where the casinos are.

The breakfast skillets are superb here, served hot on the skillet with a layer of ranch potatoes.  I have tried both the Chili skillet and the Ultimate skillet, both were excellent.  I also recommend the banana nut muffin side.

I would, however, advise against ordering from their Mexican inspired menu.  They should definitely leave the chorizo con huevos to the Mexican joints.

(excuse the puns please) The people here are really nice and its nice being somewhere in Las Vegas where not everyone there is a tourist.

 So I had the eggs florentine which was really good. My motto is the more fattening the better. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, buttery and probably loaded with saturated fat, which is completely fine with me. The eggs were poached just right, where it's firm on the outside but soft inside.

My friends and I wanted to grab breakfast off of the strip and were impressed by the high rating of Egg & I. It truly lived up to the hype.

SERVICE: 
We had a very friendly server who gave us some great tips on the menu. For example, you can get half orders for almost all of the breakfast entrees. Since it was our first time, she also gave us complimentary banana nut muffins. DELICIOUS.

FOOD:
SO. DAMN. GOOD.

Large portion sizes and excellent flavor!

I ordered the bacon and avocado omelette and was super impressed. 

The seasoned potatoes were perfect, too. Yummy. 

The OJ was fresh squeezed too. 

OVERALL:

4212468,2011-08-19,2,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"So, after a crazy weekend in Vegas whats the first thing your body needs before you hit the traffic on I -15?  An IV, close... Breakfast.  The Egg & I is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  We took the back roads from Caesars and our ETA was about 5 minutes. 

The coolest thing is their ""happy egg, sad egg"" stand at the edge of the table.  Whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  We tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  Even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.

After you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked banana nut muffin.  My buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  Then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *Sad egg face Jordan, sorry :^(   But the muffin is warm and delicious.  

We had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  I got chicken fried steak covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they CUT it up for you!  This is when I found out I am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  The chicken breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  Mouth watering.  The hype about their ranch potatoes is true.  They are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  I haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  My plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking. 

The rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the breakfast burrito, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  All of which was worth the wait on a Sunday morning.

5-Stars for the overall experience.  The waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give Jordan a muffin because he was ""special,"" their happy egg / sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple G's at the tables in Vegas.",ej5h4D6QvNEpetiZd0rrpw,3,2,5,h7W9otABC5H4z2GAUp0A5Q

1.  Many of the female servers are quite attractive and helpful.

2.  The male servers that I've had have all been invariably incompetent, rude and sometimes a combination of both.

3.  For the price, (Bouchon's $18 version is slightly better) the corned beef hash is the best I've had in any restaurant.  The first time I came here, I tried it, and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else.

TRY THE BANANA NUT MUFFIN!!! Its the lightest yet moist banana nut muffin.. I was so sold I bought the loaf $7.39 with tax for one ( I bought 4 lol for pasalubong (souvenirs .. ppl bring keychains I bring food ).  Use the free banana nut check coupon yelpers!!

THE MENU is ridiculous!  EGGSTRAVAGANZA (lol yup went there).. so many choices and you still have options to go lighter or low carb.  Want to go back to try their Hawaiian Menu (heard their Haole Loco Moco is the one to try)

Prime Rib Eggs Benny -  yummy diced cut prime rib (not chewy) well seasoned without being salty , I normally like hollandaise on the side but they forgot but I didnt mind as their hollandaise was really good.  Eggs cooked perfectly! Sauteed spinach went really well to balanced out all the richness .  The croissant was really good but got soggy fast! 

Cornbeef Hash - was homemade but didnt have the extra to make it standout .  Recommend to get the chicken and chorizo hash instead.

THE POTATOES!!! - Habla Diablo seasoning which isn't spicy .. basically salt,  paprika, garlic seasoning http://habladiablo.com/product/potato-seasoning/
SOOOO NICE AND CRUNCHY TOO !! So ONO!!!

Coffee was great- medium light (not bitter) they leave your a carafe at the table.

Our server was also super sweet and constantly checked on us while even offering everyone in the table a free banana nut muffin. I did claim the Yelp check-in for the free muffin, but she was kind enough to just give everyone in our table one. What was even more wonderful was that one of our party members is allergic to nuts, so they gave her a blueberry muffin in replacement.

For food, I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Skillet with sourdough toast ($10.25). I also shared with the boyfriend as he got the Stuffed French Toast ($9.75). When you're ordering here, I know your eyes are going to speak louder than your stomach, but I can guarantee that you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. I highly recommend the Stuffed French Toast. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet with a sausage, cheese and egg mixture folded between french toast. The syrup it comes with is lightly sweet and simply tastes amazing altogether. Of course, you'll end up a little sticky but it's worth the battle. Their potatoes are no ordinary potatoes either. They give you a plate full of potatoes covered with cajun seasoning --so delicious! Not to forget the skillet I ordered, because that was very tasty as well. They melted so much cheese over my potatoes, which was my favorite part. I only had 1/4 of the skillet and was too full to continue.

The 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. 

We got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. 

Aftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called. 

The food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try. 

It didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. 

Anyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times.

If that doesn't sound appealing to you, they have a lengthy menu of options (including those that are healthy) that will make it difficult to decide. In my opinion, the menu primarily consists of classics and southwest combinations, however, I also noted Island/Hawaiian style selections. It's somewhat of an odd array, but you can't go wrong. 

The restaurant is located in an isolate shopping plaza with plenty of parking. Wait times are long; I suggest you plan for an hour of that (during peak times), with limited seating, so you may have to stand outside with the overflow. However, once seated, the service is very fast and friendly.

I'm from San Francisco, and I wanted to eat somewhere OFF the strip. (I was staying at Vdara). So I yelped Egg and I, and ventured off the strip with my rental car and my husband. My husband of course was a bit hesitant to venture off the strip, but he was SO happy I found Egg and I. (We ate here every morning of our 3 day stay). It was seriously that good.

We ordered-
breakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+
chicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO)
chicken omelet (it had a ""special"" name to it) A+
Denver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+
whole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+
Portions are big, so don't order too much!

Service was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much.

4373935,2014-03-31,1,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"We went here twice on our last visit to Vegas. Overall 4 stars, one visit was earlier Saturday the other was later sunday.

For our first visit, we went for breakfast. We were immediately seated, no waiting. Wait staff were prompt and friendly, however, not very efficient. I noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables.
Aside from that the food was awesome. The wife and I both had breakfast skillets, they were cooked perfectly and portions were spot on. We left full and happy!

For our sunday visit, we showed up closer to 11am. Told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. Staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. The wife ordered breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and it was very delicious! I had the beef dip, which was average at best. The beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. So, I'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.

On sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot. I'd rx going early to avoid the rush if you are the type of person that gets anxious easily.",4qXTMirb3noPUosWj_Pfvw,0,0,4,GGsBBcF44VGLYVcOgA0R7Q

This time around my food was a bit on the salty side but still great!  As always, The banana nut muffin is a must have. OJ had a bit too much pulp as my straw had a tough time sucking it up.

4414616,2013-04-04,3,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I finally got to eat @ Egg & I this past Saturday, 03/30/13. Monday comes along and I'm back in the office and I read that a car plows into this restaurant. WTF? I hope everyone who was injured in this moronic act a speedy recovery. I also hope they are able to be fully operational again ASAP (if not already). 

Egg & I is located minutes from the strip on Sahara. I believe their other restaurant goes by the name of Egg Works. This restaurant is open everyday but only between the hours of 6am-3pm. We got plastered the night before and somehow were able to wake up and drive our zombie behinds to eat here the next day right before noon. The wait wasn't too bad considering the restaurant isn't too big to begin with. 

Our server Jacky was a sweet heart. She was uber friendly and attentive even when it seemed like the restaurant was chaotic. How many other tables did she have with a bunch of hung over dudes, possibly acting a fool beats the hell out of me. She was holding it down like a seasoned veteran. She started us off with that infamous banana nut muffin. This is not to be missed especially with a cup of joe.

Not going to lie and say that this place serves health conscious types of food. They may have some ""lighter"" dishes but the menu is dominated by heavy hitters. Everything we ordered was either smothered with country gravy or had some sort of heavy but tasty sauce. We thought of this great game plan to all order our own entrees and add an extra French toast plate to share amongst the five of us. Bad, bad decision. One entrée is an adequate amount of grub. Anymore, you may want to check your blood pressure.

There are plenty of choices on their menu and as you can imagine, numerous egg inspired dishes. From skillets to classics, you'll find something for everyone. I had the Country Benny, you can look it up yourself. Let's just the menu states, ""This one's a heart stopper."" Need I say more? That dish was good but I also hated life afterwards. No regrets, it was delish while I was conquering that beast but just be ready for the consequences.

Egg & I is definitely a hit. I can see why locals and tourists flock to this establishment. We ate here and I had to immediately go back to our hotel to pass out and recover in time for night two. Only in Sin City...",tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w,5,3,4,sH-2TuEY02VrwCQhRxmnMw

The menu is extensive, quite a few breakfast items to choose from. Obviously eggs are the feature here with a large omelette selection. The place is homey, and they have murals of farm lands all over the walls. 

I decided to get the Mexican Omelette - Chorizo, chiles and onions and cheese, topped with sour cream. Came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - I got wheat.

Overall I was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. Usually I love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should. 

Service was SLOW. Yes, it was busy on a Saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, ""Where's the food?"". Never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.

They did have a very yummy banana nut muffin, which I highly suggest getting if you come here. AND (as of this writing) if you check in on Yelp, you get one for free!

I came here once before and got a healthy omelette. I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place, but let's be real, how yummy can anything healthy get? But I decided to give it another chance and decided to try one of their signature dishes. THE stuffed french toast: french toast stuffed with egg, sausage and cheese topped with powdered sugar. It's a heavenly mix of savory and sweet, especially dipped in maple syrup.

Most of their entrees come with their homemade potatoes. They're lightly fried to give a french fry crisp and cajun-flavored that makes it taste like Lay's BBQ chips!!

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who suggest that when dining here with company it would be wise to split dishes as the portion sizes are very generous! I ordered the Hobo scramble which was a special and not available on the regular menu. I am sucker for a scramble however the superior quality of the muffin has convinced me to sample the sweeter items (waffles) on the menu the next time I visit this place. Lots of people rave about the potatoes and I have to say that they were not what I personally am looking for in a potato. They are covered in seasoning and I just prefer a simpler potato flavor. The coffee was great and I cannot say that about many places! Here it is a good strength with a good flavor and it comes in cute mug with two happy eggs on it! Probably my favorite thing about this place is the little egg sign at your table that you can flip from happy to sad when you are in need of something. It beats having to pay close attention to flag down your waiter whenever they walk by.

I ordered the Prime Rib Benny and was more than satisfied at how generous the portion was along with how delicious it tasted!  Now I know a Prime Rib Benny isn't something that sounds all too familiar to anyone who hasn't been to this restaurant, so picture this:  juicy and flavorful pieces of blackened prime rib chopped up with poached eggs crowning an open faced buttery croissant, which is then drizzled with a rich and creamy hollandaise sauce.  It's like what traditional egg benedicts dream to be some day basically.  Regular eggs benedict is Carlton Banks, Prime Rib Benny is Will Smith.  You get the picture.

Besides the entrée itself, my order of OJ was fresh squeezed and just right.  Their lemonade was great too, which is a definite plus in my book.  I also had a taste of their French fries and Portuguese sausage, which my cousins ordered and both were very tasty, too!  The fries were thin, crispy and flavorful.  While the Portuguese sausage was not overly oily and fatty and was cooked just right.

Service was verygood, as our waiter was attentive, friendly and always available.  They have this nifty little feature on your table where there's a sign of a sad face and on the other side of it, a sign of a happy face.  When you want your server's attention, you just flip the sign to show the sad face and you'll be helped right away.  I found this to be a very memorable and smart way of the restaurant going the extra mile to offer as much quality service to its patrons.",ORSDrV_gtIE-is4YQanXJg,1,0,5,QQuGhmhxPkY24ZMY846H6Q

think this was the original, they have a number of them in vegas now

buddy had the chicken enchilada omelette, which he said was pretty good
for some reason though, their hash browns are now patties, like you get at mcdonalds....no biggie, still looked good

I had the loco moco, which was good, not anything to write home about though
it was basic hamburger patty over rice with brown gravy and 2 sunny side up eggs on top....funny the waiter asked how I would like the eggs prepared, didn't know there was a choice with loco moco!  in retrospect, probably should have gone with standard breakfast fare or my go to key largo crepe
sometimes you shouldn't try new things

The seating is pretty crammed, even when you get there early. We're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.

I also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh hashbrowns. They have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. Meh. I like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an Ore-Ida bag.

The last time we went, I asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. I can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  It's a texture thing and it skeeves me. I know I'm not the only one. 

They were really great when I sent it back the first time, but the second time, I felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. They were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (Yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.) 

I also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy. 

My boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  Kind of spongey and flavorless.

For the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice. But I know it's popular and beloved, so if someone else wanted to go, I'd go, but otherwise, I'd recommend one of their other locations.",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,2,1,3,e_fcL1fnZI5KZo_9b_z3Aw

Unfortunately I will not be coming back here anymore. I was dining at the restaurant with a friend a month ago. When two white women came into the restaurant and were seated in the table next to us.  They were having a very loud and expletive filled conversation which included the use of the N word several times. People at other tables could hear them too and were just as disgusted as I was. My asked the waitress could she speak to the manager about these 2 women. I thought she would ask the two women to leave considering they had not even placed their orders yet and where disturbing the other patrons. He just looked at me smiled and said do you need anything else. No thank you there are plenty of other breakfast places in Vegas.,-dCRhlmz6E7HHoPK69LNzw,0,0,1,4CXx8wj1c74qdXWE4ER1UA

We arrived around 10:15am on a Sunday and the place was packed! There was a line outside the door of people waiting. However, the wait was quite fast and our party of 6 was seated in about 20 min. The service was excellent - our waitress Alexa was super friendly and took our complicated drink and food orders with ease.

Bacon and sliced avocado omelette ($11.25): excellent. The omelette was huge and stuffed with ample chunks of whole avocado, bacon bits, and topped with a generous amount of melted Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. There was also a side of buttered toast and a choice of home fries, cottage cheese, or fruit (I think this is offered with any egg dish). Delicious, and a large portion size for one person. 
Heart stopper skillet special ($10.25): this was my favorite dish that our table ordered. It was one of the specials and consisted of a layer of works potatoes topped with bacon, ham, and sausage and smothered in homemade country style gravy and two sunny-side up eggs. The gravy and the runny egg yolks mixed with the potatoes and meat created a delicious creamy explosion of flavor and umami. 
Southwestern Cobb salad ($10.50): a huge salad with a ton of toppings. I was impressed that there was very little lettuce, and instead a lot of delicious toppings such as taco seasoned chicken, black bean and corn relish, tomatoes, black olives, bacon, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, and a whole sliced avocado (amazing!) with chipotle ranch dressing. 
Sundance special omelette ($11.25): veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Swiss cheese topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. You can also add chicken for an extra $2.50. The feta cheese melded perfectly with the creamy egg flavor and the various vegetables.

Experience:  I met some friends for early lunch or late breakfast.  It was pretty busy for 11:00 on a Thursday.  

Facility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. There were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. 

Service:  not the best service I ever had, but not the worst. Doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. It took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick. 

Food:  a girlfriend and I decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  We ordered the ""Chili Relleno Eggs Benedict"" special, and we got the ""chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and banana nut muffin.""  
The muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  Would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. 
The Benedict was good. I love the chili taste that cut the richness of the Benedict. 
The chicken fried steak was good, but not the best I ever had. It was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. I really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  When they first came out, I thought I wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.

The traditional eggs benedict was simply drowning in a very creamy and underwhelming hollandaise sauce and tasted like a somewhat soggy mess. Unappetizing.

The sunrise mountain, which was a croissant underneath scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese, didn't taste too spectacular either and can probably be easily duplicated at home. It looked better than it tasted.

4539914,2011-01-24,3,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I'm always happy to find a local place in LV to have meals.  Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.

Hence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(

When I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.

I tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.

Servers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again.",ehIpQo8mQHxhNIq7WAwKFw,7,6,4,E0GBx51LgLNp_fgqKoLhxQ

4549585,2017-07-03,1,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"So when I am out traveling, one of my most favorite meals in the history of the world is breakfast. And I usually like my breakfasts to be big, home style, and comfortable. So on my last trip to Vegas, rather than brave the elements of the casino buffet, I decided to get in my car and venture around the city and hit up some of the local spots.

Of course, I hit up Yelp to find out what the breakfast scene was in Las Vegas, and it led me to The Egg & I. This place is located in a strip mall, and has really really good parking. But that's just the small stuff, let's get into the real treasure within.

Right off the bat, you feel totally at home in this place. It's got all the elements of one of those quaint little hometown diners that you know and love and probably grew up with. The staff there is super attentive, and honestly made me feel so welcome as soon as I walked into the door.

 I didn't have to wait long at all for someone to come up to my table and asked me what I want to drink. As I slipped on my coffee and looked at the menu, they had a wide variety of stuff to choose from. I settled on the combo plate which had two pancakes scrambled eggs and my choice of sausage, bacon, or sausage patties. I went for the link sausage, because they said that was absolutely the hot ticket. And of course, long-time readers of my Yelp reviews will know that I always order a glass of milk with breakfast as a test for the server's attention to detail.

My breakfast was delivered by a different server and was sat down in front of me and for a brief second I thought I was going to have to make a mental note to give them one star off for forgetting my milk. When lo and behold two seconds later comes my waitress with a glass of milk. Great save on their part!

The food itself was really good the pancakes were light and fluffy, the eggs were cooked to perfection, and they were absolutely right on those link sausages ... they were the bomb diggity. The staff was really good about cruising by every once in a while and refilling my coffee and asking how things were without being overbearing. Honestly, it  felt like I was at a friend's house rather than a restaurant.

The bottom line? If you are ever out in Vegas and don't want to have to navigate through a horde of drunk people, obnoxious teenagers, or Keno players to get to your breakfast, you really have to go to The Egg & I. You won't regret it!",-d0o3YCu6Zu6hHpzNq4dUQ,1,1,5,0yBEVDDMIhT03qmkF4v69g

4561899,2014-06-24,1,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"This was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!

I came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in Vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  Both the food and the service were ""egg-cellent.""  

Anyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.

First off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  

As for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I""ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.

My other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.

What I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!

Lastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas.",PHl0poFyk2IntQ44VqGh4g,2,1,5,OJPZB842huLyIMTXz9BCYw

Hubby and I stopped in here after a couple of days on the strip and it was just what the doctor ordered. 

Him: Corned beef hash with two eggs over medium and Hablo Diabla ""works"" potatoes. So freaking delish.

Me: Breakfast burrito sub turkey sausage for bacon (because I'm watching my waist line... *crickets*). Heaven. 

Although everything we had was delicious, what really made a mark was the homemade salsa they served and the Hablo Diabla seasoning they use. So delicious and one of a kind. One of a kind is hard to find these days with so many restaurants out there in competition but these guys really do have something special.

Now the review...

The family and I were in Vegas to cash in on a Giants World Series bet.  I really didn't want the usual buffet, so we did a quick search on Yelp and off to the Egg and I we went.  

We stepped in and were quickly seated.  The televisions on the wall was great.  I could see who was playing and not playing for that Sunday's Fantasy Football Lineups.  We ordered coffee and looked over the menu.  (Note- Coffee was ok.  Better than IHOP, but not my favorite blend.) 

We looked over the menu and what a selection!  It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  I ordered the Egg-Ceptional Omelet, my wife ordered the Two-egger, and my son had the Chocolate Waffles.    

The food quickly came out and as far as portions...  they were HUGE!  My wife's Two-egger was like 4 eggs.  My kid's waffles were shaped like Mickey Mouse, which was a nice touch.  My omelet was one of the biggest I've ever seen.  Our only problem was that the chocolate waffle was without chocolate.  We had them bring out some chocolate chips and all was well again.  

The omelet and ranch spiced potatoes were yummy.  You could taste freshness of the ingredients.  The omelet had sausage, diced ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, portabella mushrooms and melted cheese all topped with sour cream and green onions.

Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. Took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. The sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. Our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the BEST BANANA  NUT MUFFIN ever !!! 

I had the Blackend Prime Rib Benny, A Grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. Also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. This dish was AMAZING ! All the flavors tied together so well and that Banana Nut Muffin will make me a return customer ! The hubby had Crepes filled w/ Mushrooms, that I take was also delicious, since  I didn't get to taste it !

A normal trip to Vegas for me and my girlfriend tends to be limited to the strip, but having driven out from San Diego, we decided to venture away from the concrete jungle for breakfast.  I looked on yelp, found this place and we started driving.

Here's all you need to know:

1. There were a lot of people waiting outside, and we almost just left.  For a two-top, we waited 20 minutes (which seemed more than reasonable for a Saturday morning).
2. The food came WICKED-FAST.  Like, 5 minutes MAX.  2 orders of eggs bene and a plate of pancakes.  CRAZY FAST.
3. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the ""ranch-style"" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well.
4. The prices were very reasonable.

100% Guaranteed that I will come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.

RANDOM NOTE:  After picking up our pup from a doggy hotel near the airport, we considered driving way back to this place for breakfast one more time.  By PURE LUCK, we saw a sign for ""Egg Works"", stumbled in and discovered that it was the SAME COMPANY.  1 in a million chance and a very happy ending for our trip.

Pretty busy for a Monday morning. Were seated within 2 minutes, great. Server was friendly and attentive. Wife had the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast...yummy. Very good with a nice sized portion. 
I had the corned beef hash. Good stuff, also a nice sized portion. I love corned beef hash and this was homemade. Excellent. Hit the spot. Great food, good service, reasonable prices.
I was not too fond of the location ( I felt it was a bit far) but I wanted to avoid the strip so I guess I shouldn't complain. 
The only CON for me was the lack of info on the server's part. I love pancakes, and always have them for breakfast when I dine out. I asked for pancakes instead of toast and was told they could not do that. Okay, no biggie. Not the first place that does this. However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option. Service is a big part of the experience when dining out.

4733243,2018-01-19,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"After a mediocre breakfast at the hotel where I am staying, I decided to look up ""best breakfast in Las Vegas"".  This place showed up in my search results.  It had over 1,100 reviews and nearly a 5 star rating.  Obviously, I had to try it.  My companions were a bit skeptical upon arriving.  However, after my first visit, I was thoroughly impressed.  The waitress and staff were very attentive.  And the food?  It was incredible!  I got the Bacon and Sliced Avocado omelet with fruit, one companion got the Crazy Chicken omelet and another got the Sunrise Mountain.  The amount of avocado in our omelets was awesome.  My one companion complained to me that it was too much avocado, but she's nuts.  There is no such thing as too much avocado.  And my other companion, loved, loved, loved the Sunrise Mountain so much that he got it the 2nd morning were went.  Yes, that's right, we went 2 mornings in a row.  My 2nd morning, I got the Chili Rellenos omelet (which was more amazing than the bacon one [I know!]), and my other companion got the Seasoned Center Cut NY Steak.  And again, it was incredible!  And the staff again exceeded our expectations.  The manager (sorry, I cant remember her name, but she's curly haired, blonde and very beautiful...hey, I was enthralled with food in front of me, but she's amazing! EDIT: her name is Abby...yes, I did go back this morning) brought out the steak and asked my companion to cut into it to see if was to her doneness preference because other steaks were coming out a little rarer than preferred.  Upon doing so, and finding it was in fact a little too rare, it was gladly taken back and finished to perfection.  

All this to say that I am preparing myself to go the gym to work up a monster appetite so that we can go this morning for the third day in a row and enjoy another EGGMAZING (sorry, couldn't help myself) breakfast!

So good the wife and I went two days in a row during a recent visit to Vegas. 

4 Star Breakdown from two days:

WAIT TIME: 4*
Day 1 : Long ( We were told 15min , and it ended up being over 30min wait.) 
Day 2 : Quick ( seated in about 5- 10 min. )


Food: AMAZING!!!! 5*


Service: 4* ( They have clever yellow / black eggs as signs that you need help)

Day 1 : Had a server by the name of Amanda, who ROCKED!!! She was the perfect      host, and made the experience great. (she gets 5 *+ )

Day 2: Never got the servers name( skinny preggo chick), she never came buy often, and when she did, she would completely forget about stuff we asked for. The guy next to us sat there for a good 20min before she took his drink order, and even longer to get him his meal. I had asked for a refill of water, and she seemed to bring water to everyone around us, except for me. The she abruptly brought us our bill that we had not asked for , while we were still eating, and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. Oh yeah I still hadn't gotten my water, so I asked her again and finally as we were getting up to leave, she brought water.

I think we beat the mad rush on a Friday morning by coming on the early side around 8AM. By the time we left nearing 10AM, there was a line out the door. Service was friendly and attentive. I was pretty disappointed with the food though. We ordered a veggie eggs benedict and a southwest (chicken/chorizo) hash. At first, the order for the eggs benedict came out wrong with canadian bacon and spinach vs. just all veggie. The waitress brought out extra banana nut muffins to apologize, which was a nice gesture especially since the best thing here was the banana nut muffin.  The hollandaise on the benedict was really watery and had a slight sweet taste to it. Overall, the benedict lacked flavor. On the other hand, the hash and the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty.

4758804,2017-10-07,3,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"When you're in Sin City and breakfast comes to mind, many people might think the breakfast buffets on the Strip hit the spot. Don't get me wrong, those are good. However, if you are looking for something a little off the beaten path for the BEST spot for breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further because the ""Egg and I"" will have you covered. With an astounding 2,500 reviews (as of October), its no wonder why this place has near-perfect Yelp reviews. 

I've actually had this place bookmarked forever as I finally got the opportunity to dine here with my lady on the morning of Saturday 9/30/17. Located directly on West Sahara Ave. (and adjacent to Arville St.), Egg and I is located in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas and only about a 10 minute drive from the Strip. Parking especially during breakfast hours can be very challenging as there are other business here. But the majority of people the park in this lot dine here.

Since we had arrived around 10:45am, we park quite a distance from the main entrance. The exterior is very rustic and looks like your mom & pop place. The interior has a very cozy and charming feel to it. Since the weather was a perfect 76°, we decided on dining at their generous outdoor patio. Since I was still tired (after not crashing until 3:30am and waking up at 7:30am), I ordered coffee. What is nice is that they give me the entire carafe of coffee! And lots of liquid creamers to go with it. Score! And our server was very sweet, attentive, and took care of us in a timely manner.

Their menu is very extensive; they have a huge variety of Eggs Benedicts, omelettes, corned beef hash, French toast, pancakes, waffles, and crepes. I finally decide on ordering their ""Bacon & Onion Skillet"" (for $9.99). My lady opted for ""The Classic"" which are two-eggs (she chose over easy) w/toast and Godshall's turkey bacon. Both of us receive their signature Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. Even though business was at full capacity, both our breakfast platters arrive in just 10 minutes.

I've got to say, I was very impressed with what I received. There is something magical about these potatoes because the seasoning in them was addictive! And the bed of eggs over the ooey-gooey cheese made every savory bite a heavenly experience. I had the opportunity of trying some of her turkey bacon and damn, this was flavorful and on point! For the price you pay, you will get enough food to carry you through the rest of the day. In fact, my next meal wasn't until around 8 hours later at 7:30pm.

A little added bonus, if you check-in on the Yelp app, they will give you their signature Banana Nut Muffin. However, we got so much food that even more carbohydrates with that muffin would equal a massive food coma. Overall, the ""Egg and I"" is definitely a place worth checking out. A great family-owned experience, quality food, excellent prices, and stellar service makes this one of the easiest five-star ratings I've given in quite some time!",yFb-Hqr8k6uIfwCQ3BO4dQ,7,5,5,4yUJ7hfSwt05bJd54RV6kw

4764549,2015-11-30,1,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I wanted to try something new for breakfast. I had no idea where to go or what to eat. I came to Yelp like I normally do. Mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and I packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.

When we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. I sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that I could park. As soon as she walked in, she called me. She said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. Nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. So, I walked in to wait.

Upon entering, I was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. I just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. Surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.

The place is really small and packed to capacity, so I was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. We had plenty space.

The server came around fast to take our drink order. She was quick to bring our drinks back too. She asked us if we were ready to order and we said, ""No, we're looking at Yelp pictures and we need some more time."" I did ask about the stuff French Toast dish that someone shared on Yelp. She smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. Then she left and took orders for people that was around us.

As soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. When she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. We went ahead and ordered. It totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. The waitress said, ""You were on Yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?"" I was happy she reminded me to do that.

She came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. I don't even like banana nut muffins but I took it anyways because it was free. I took a bite of it and fell in love. It was so warm and yummy lol. My friend got emotional lol. She said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. They were just delicious.

About 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. I order the Stuffed French Toast with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. It also came with seasoned potatoes. It looked incredible. My friend ordered the 2 pork chops that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the seasoned potatoes. Her's looked delicious too.

I LOVE potatoes so I ate those first. I put ketchup all over them and had a ball. My friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. I put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.

Next, I started in on my French Toast sandwiches. I didn't like the sandwiches. The sausages, eggs and cheese didn't have much flavor. I thought I made a big mistake. Being that I'm so smart, I thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the French toast and season the filling myself. I did, and it was 90% better. I ate the filling separately, and ever so often, I would dip the French Toast in the warm syrup that came with my food.

My friend said that the pork chops were Just okay. They were really thin, for sure. I don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. I wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and I took a bite of hers. They tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. She was right. They were just okay. She did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.

The good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. I'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.

The service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. I asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. I guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. I didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and I didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.

But also, I took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once I had actually finished it. It took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. We just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. When she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. She came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. We were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. I'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.

Although I'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, I probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",trO6aQpnXxRXqIyKQ_ryrQ,1,1,3,OkDiOBUwg5C9rbTeD3JTHg

Cincinnati Chili- It certainly isn't Skyline, but at least they are trying :) 
Fruit Plate- Fresh and someone else did all the work cutting it up for me.

Salads - I have tried two different salads here. Although there is enough to feed a family of 4, bigger portions don't make a better salad. I found the chicken really boring and dry. I will be trying something different next time.

The hostess and waitress were both really pleasent. The waitress did a excellent job explaining the menu to me and letting me know how I could customize my order. Everything I asked for was promptly brought out.

While not the best sausage gravy I have had in Vegas, it was still decent on it's own and still better than most of the sausage gravy I have had in Vegas. Nice amount of sausage throughout with a nice homemade flavor. I do believe it was made in house. But it still had the consistency of being out of a packet. The biscuits weren't as soft and tender as I would have liked, but still passable.

The bacon I got was on point. They were straight and crispy. I asked for the eggs to be extra soft. They were okay, but it was weird, the top half of the pile was cooked how I wanted, but the bottom half was cooked hard. I'm  guessing they were left on too long and not continually scrambled.

...And I am obviously not the only one in town who feels the same way.

Its always nice to know that a place you love so much is appreciated by others, and thats the feeling you get as you pull into the Egg and I on Sahara. Immediately you will notice a group of people waiting patiently outside of the restaurant for the next available seat. When I go, being a smoker, I usually go out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and a smoke with my coffee and book. The staff is so welcoming. I am a frequent visitor so they know where I would like to sit, escort me to a table of my choosing, provide an ashtray, and offer the heating lamp if it is cold outside. Always friendly, you are not just communicated with by your server, but others in the staff that notice your presence. Nobody walks around with blinders on. You feel as if they are there to enjoy your breakfast with you. 

Speaking of the breakfast; it is the best in town! The wait is never long, and the food is always fresh and hot. Makes one wonder what kind of army is stacked away in the kitchen. Spinning out plate after plate of unique dishes that dont only taste great, but are piled high on your plate, makes me want to walk into the kitchen and give its staff a huge hug. There is something on the menu for everyone's taste, and, unlike many chain breakfast places who will remain unnamed, you actually get fresh ingredients, and flavor without frou frou toppings of berries and whip cream to try and doll it up. I find myself looking at others plates and wondering what they are having with delicious anticipation of trying it the next time. My signature dish is Brads Special, and I almost never stray from a favorite, but the fact that I feel safe to do so at The Egg and I says a lot.

A pleasant ""hello how are you"" greets you at the door, and a friendly ""Thank you, have a nice day"" assures a future visit. If The Egg and I added a few floors atop its building, and offered rooms like a Bed and Breakfast, you better believe there would never be an available occupancy.",5xGO2SXrxv5_sYDrwXvh2g,1,0,5,s3iu2KXfHlCZcy1747PLTw

Coffee and water arrived first.  The coffee was in a hot pot with at least a quart of delicious coffee.  Water was reverse osmosis and highly drinkable.
My steak was cooked to order, but cold.  The waitress rescued me and soon a nice hot steak and eggs order was in front of me.

The Carnivore had eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes.  This is his preferred restaurant breakfast.  There were no weak points.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the maple cured bacon was bacony delicious, of course.  Hash browns were in patty form, but tasted lovely, and the pancakes were of the sort that I just plain love.  

This is honest food, cooked presumably with grease and butter, and is just plain good.  

The menus look like they are styled a bit after a newspaper, which is new and lovely.  This establishment has something The carnivore has never seen before.  Each table has a device on it that shows an egg with a happy face, or an egg with a sad face.  One is yellow, the other is black, and this means that your server can tell at a glance whether you need her for anything.  Every restaurant should employ a similar device.  

Amanda was our waitress.  Yes, the Carnivore still uses the words waitress and waiter.  He also will not apologize for this, or stop doing it.  In any case, Any case, Amanda was on point for our whole visit.  All questions were answered promptly, food came out superfast, drinks were topped off without any wait, and she had an infectious smile.  She either loves her job, or should move to Hollywood.

friends wanted to try this for lunch when we were in the area and i had high hopes for this place. wait for a little over 10 people was a long wait as this place is super busy. once we got seated we noticed the place was packed and our service ended up being horrible. i guess they utilize these egg signs on the tables to indicate if we need help or not and look. we were the unhappy eggs of the place. sat down and ran out of menus. we waited for over 10 minutes then got menus. after we all decided what we wanted to order it took another 10 minutes to get someone to help take our order. the guy who took our order kept hitting my friend's chair as he took his order over 20 times. after we ordered our food took an okay amount of time to come out. once it came out no one could eat because they ran out of utensils and he had to ask wishing a 15 minute period three different waiters to get us utensils (how long could this possibly take?) then we ate our food. EVERYTHING WAS SO SALTY.

i had the burger and fries (i know who gets a burger here but its what i wanted and when you have such a large selection it truly suffered). my burger came WITHOUT onions. i was confused had to ask the waiter if they give onions and he was like they should. patty was cooked with no seasoning at all. bland. tomatoes were frozen. nothing special on it like damn i know its a plain burger but its so bad... NEVER GET THE BURGER. fries were the most salty thing I've ever tasted in my life. like wow. I'm a person who licks my plate clean and i didn't finish this plate at all. biggest waste of my money. i tried my other friends dishes and we all agreed all the dishes were salty. not acceptable.

I guess b/c I had such a great experience with EGG WORKS their sister place I had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again. 

ENTREE: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. Its amazing to watch him work. Everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  I had a the tostada last time and I had really wanted the cobb salad but was torn. So this time cobb salad was my only request. 
disguisting. 

COBB: I love cobb salads. This was just plain GROSS. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of ICEBURG LETTUCE. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. They gave me 1/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word EGG in it.. i was very disappointed. You'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.
on top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since I've lived here. 

Maybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. I take some responsibility in that I guess. my bf's omelet was delicious. the potatoes were good.. so was his banana nut muffin.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & I... and yes good food vs. bad food. 

The only reason I gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :)

I was craving Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. my cousin wanted an Omelette and my Niece wanted pancakes or waffles. Yelp brought up several options and I read the reviews. The Egg and I had everything we wanted and the reviews were good. So, off we went. We got there pretty fast from the Strip about 15 mins. Upon our arrival the place was full. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait but a table came up outside rather quickly. It was a hot day but we were starving and they had cooling mist sprayers which helped a bit. We were greeted by our waiter OSCAR who was friendly and hospitable. He took our drink order, mad some recommendations from the Specials and left us to figure out our orders. He delivered the drinks with these Bannana Nut muffins we didn't ask for. I didn't want the muffin but after I had a pinch I was hooked. Yes, it was warm and delicious. With the size of my breakfast I decided to save it for breakfast the next day. We placed our orders and no time after that we had our orders. The food looked and tasted great. The portions were large and pippin hot. We were all silently eating and enjoying our meal. 

Ok for the review. I am really specific about my chicken fried steak and I rarely get it because it usually sucks unless my mom or Southern grandma made it. But this one was quite good I must admit. My only complaint was with the potatoes. They were cooked well nice and crispy but was a bit salty. I prefer to add my own salt to taste because of that. My family agreed that their potatoes were also a bit salty. But overall our food was delicious and the service Great!!

Oscar is truly great at his job and we truly appreciated his service. We would gladly go to The Egg & I again without hesitation.

Between the three of us we have two with food issues, and one cranky woman. Liza checked the kitchen for Soy free foods, and read the ingredients to double check. Really great service. Never an empty cup of coffee, food hot, all cooked great.
 The Prime Rib Benny was a tad salty but I expected that from the Prime Rib. It's delicious. The Original Benny was great, too. My daughters Fruit Plate with yogurt was fresh and a much different variety than the usual fare at other places.
  I think we'll add this to empty breakfast place slot that was opened Baby Stacks told us to freeze so the servers would be comfortable later in the day.  :/

So as you can read, I ordered the corned beef hash which does come with 2 eggs made whatever way you'd like, some pretty good, crispy, special seasoned cut potatoes, and a choice of a banana nut muffin or toast of choice. The waitress was nice enough to pass out free muffins for everyone, the muffin sounded good and everyone at other tables had them, but in actuallity it was only ok. I probably should have went for the toast, but looking at my friend's toast, I will say that they put a lot of butter on it, so if you don't want that shit, make sure to tell them, because I don't think they'll tell you. Oh also forgot to mention that the order also comes with two random slices of fruit.

I actually felt a tad overwhelmed, not by the meat, but the potatoes, while great, it was just so much starch to digest, but non the less, it was still satisfactory and the flavorings in each bite were awesome. 

Service was awesome but paying at the end seemed to drag because we had to wait in line to pay at the register....but regardless, I would definitely go here for breakfast if I ever wake up in time during my Vegas trips.",DFih6Bhiw6_slNN5z39c4g,2,2,4,cs_YAWm5qnmglTx6AZlv1Q

The Ranch Potatoes are like like Potato Chips, you can't help but pop one after the other, after the other, in your mouth.

But, it's not like I can finish it anyways, because of that damn freakin most delicious Banana Nut Muffin I have in the beginning.

Check in to get a complimentary banana nut muffin! We really liked it; it was moist and tasty. They seem to be really popular among locals so make sure you get a taste! Also, shout out to our waitress Karla; she was super attentive and friendly!

A couple tidbits: they have a dog friendly patio, they have an egg-shaped thing on each table that you can flip when you need something from the waiter which is really convenient, you pay your bill at the front of the restaurant, and they sell pre-packaged containers of their seasoning at the front. 

Speaking of the seasoning, I ordered the works omelette ($11.99) which was delicious and meaty which is just the way I like it but the star of the show was BY FAR the potatoes. They're so flavorful, addicting, and just seasoned so well. They're cut into small pieces so they're crispy and there's a ton of flavor packed in every bite. I couldn't stop myself from eating them and I constantly found myself thinking, ""These are some damn good breakfast potatoes, probably the best I've ever had."" Some people might not like how it's seasoned so much, but I loved it.

This is now my go-to breakfast place in Vegas. It's not on the strip and would require a drive but it's worth for those potatoes.",_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw,5,4,5,8ecAWjskjBnPmjz3yQ-o3w

They have indoor and outdoor seating (the patio is dog friendly). We opted to sit outdoors because it was early enough in the day that it wasn't scorching hot outside. They had mist machines and fans outside to help combat the heat as well.

Our server Kelly was incredibly nice and friendly. I was having difficulty deciding between the Veggie Eggs Benedict (Works Veggie Benny) and the Fiesta Skillet. She recommended the skillet. It was so flavorful! The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the salsa tied everything together. The portions are HUGE. I was only able to eat like a third of my skillet so keep that in mind when you go. My husband loved his burrito as well. He could barely finish the second half.

5190737,2012-11-03,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"I have a few things to say about the dishes I've tried:

- Egg's benedict: flavor explosion in my mouth!  I was recently introduced to the benny and can't believe what I've been missing out on. There are so many sensational flavors in this dish that you just have to try it for yourself!  And those potatoes - I'm not much of a potato breakfast person but could not help stealing these off my friend's plate!

- Strawberry stuffed french toast: I am more of a 'sweets' type of breakfast girl so I typically order french toast. You get 2 slices of toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese goodness.  Unfortunately, this dish starts to become a little TOO sweet at the end so it's a struggle to finish the last few bites.  (I've had to confirm this by ordering this dish twice.)  If you can share this dish with someone, that'd work out well.

- banana bread muffins: you pretty much have to try this when you go there. I'm so confused because sometimes, I've been given the muffin for free and other times I've had to order it...but whatevs, you gotta do what you gotta do!  The muffin is soft and when served warm = bomb-dot-com.

** ALSO, must note on the service. All the workers are very polite and friendly. If you ever need something, they have this egg face you can turn over at your table. When the egg is black, you're fine.  Need something? Then turn the egg over so it's yellow. I have to say, this system totally works. Because the few times we've need a coffee refill or something..flip over the egg face and *BAM* someone helps you out right away!

Even though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.

The other breakfast foods are solid. I got the eggs Benedict and they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I hate it when places drizzle that delicious egg butter concoction and am so glad to have found a place that isn't afraid of it. My husband always gets the typical egg sausage breakfast and he is always happy because in all honesty, he really comes out for those potatoes.

I've also had a few of the spicy omelettes and they have all been amazing. I watched my brother in law devour a four egg omelette. He ate through the pain because even though it's rather large, it was so delicious that leaving any behind would have been a crime.

Nearly every table was filled on a Monday morning. Our servers name was Debra and she was prompt, friendly and very knowledgable  about the menu items. 

The menu is pretty extensive. They do just about anything you can imagine with an egg. I ordered the bacon and avo omelette and my husband had the chile relleno omelette. We ordered a side of Diabla sauce, which came warm and was the perfect compliment. Our omelettes were moist, perfectly cooked, and stuffed with fresh ingredients. The potatoes at Egg and I were nothing short of addictive. It took what little will power I had on our last morning in Vegas to push away from my plate.

Drink some caffeine, ride with the windows down, stick your head out the window with your tongue in the wind.  Come ready to read & eat because you have a massive book of a menu to study before making a tasty decision, which you really can't go wrong.  Everything is very good, but very different with generous blends of ingredients.  Def not your normal boring breakfast foods.

So, if you're not awake and not ready to study the menu, use the random decision making method by closing your eyes before opening the menu to a any page and ordering the first item your finger lands upon.

You always have the choice of warm, fresh banana nut muffin or toast.  Let me repeat -- warm, fresh banana nut muffin, ahhhhh.  Just about everything on the menu is served with their yummilicious ranch style potatoes.

My favorite thing here is the Pesto Scramble (4 eggs scrambled with sliced chicken, pesto, tomatoes, spinach, and feta cheese.)  My other favorite is when they have the Country Potato Soup special, which is a creamy potato soup topped with lots of chives and some bacon.   It's not a regular menu item.

The decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as I first walked in. Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!

We went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.

Cooked just right, with a thick and creamy gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the OJ carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.
Again the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular Egg&I restaurant was a bit far from our Hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride).

My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over.

First, I can't believe they charged us $3.00 freaking dollars for a jag of hot water which I only ask for a cup so I can set up baby formula for my baby.  On top of that, no one tell us that we have to pay for hot water!  If I knew, I would've order hot tea instead of ice water... at least I got tea at the end!  Second, we tried their chili.....it was horrible!  We only had couple bites, I was kinda tired and busy taking care of the baby...otherwise I'll ask them to cancel the or exchange to something else, in the same time ask them to give me a tea bag for that $3.00 hot water cost!

Got there about 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday, and although the place was busy, it wasn't packed, so there was no wait for a table.  Started with coffee which was surprisingly good - very mellow with a good flavor.  I even thought about asking what kind of coffee they use, but unfortunately forgot.

I ordered my favorite - corned beef hash and eggs, while the lady ordered country fried steak.  CBH was in a soft patty form.  The corned beef was of the finely-shredded variety probably from a can, so don't expect chunks from a brisket they brined and carved themselves.  I'm not complaining - the stuff was tasty.  The two eggs on top were done a nice over easy.  I wasn't a fan of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, which tasted okay, but were a little too loose for me - like if you tried to scoop them with your fork instead of stabbing them, they would just fall off.  I like hash browns, home fries, etc. that stick together a bit so you can put them on the same bite as the CBH/egg/omelette/etc.  I can't believe it's just me.  Right?

The lady's country fried steak was tender and tasty.  Not out of this world, but certainly better than you'd get at an IHOP.  While I had wheat toast, she chose the banana muffin, which was great - just filling, so with the good portions of the rest of out breakfasts, we couldn't finish it.

Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.

As far as the food, it also met my expectations.

Definitely get the homemade banana nut muffin-it's moist, not too sweet but sweet enough with the right amount of flavor between banana and nut. They offer this with most of their breakfast items. I ordered the veggie omelet with slices of avocado-delish! Bacon was crispy and done-I don't like wet partially done bacon. Coffee was ok, not great but not bad so it worked. 

Service-ok. No smiles, just business as usual. And we sometimes had trouble getting the waitress to notice we needed more coffee and water. This is why I'm only giving this place four stars.",F1D2-GlQrNrLcHpNufUGSA,1,0,4,6vsJK6LhPdZpku_syAevfQ

We had to get the bus as we were staying on the strip but it was well worth the journey! This place is amazing! 

My wife had the breakfast burrito and I had the corned beef hash with poached egg. My wife devoured his and said it was fantastic, mine was so good that I can't find the words. 

I was expecting the sort of corned beef you get in a tin, I was soooooo wrong! This was real pulled beef! My eggs were perfectly poached and I cleared my plate which is rare!

Our server was a real asset to the restaurant, so good at his job. When my wife told him how we had found out about the restaurant he brought us complimentary muffins which were mouthwatering.

5659301,2011-04-03,0,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"When my brother was in Kindergarten last year, he got some sort of award for some achievement I have since forgotten, which resulted in a coupon for the Egg & I/Egg Works. I don't think we ever used it, but I had looked it up on Yelp last year, and remembered it had good reviews.

Fast forward to yesterday, 4/2/11. While eating a breakfast of homemade blueberry waffles and chillin on the patio, Lawrence T. was telling me all about how much he loved breakfast foods - all kinds. I was trying to figure out where we were would eat before we headed off to The Adventure Dome later during the day (we ended up not going.) I was bummed when he said breakfast foods were where his heart was, because it's my least favorite meal of the day. 

Around 2 PM, after driving around and me not remembering the names or addresses of the places that I wanted to try on the west side (where he lives) I spotted ""Egg & I."" Despite the fact I'm not into breakfast, I decided to suck it up and offer this place as an option because Lawrence had told me he liked breakfast so much. It helped that I vaguely remembered that it had good reviews here on Yelp. 

Upon walking in, you get hit in the face with the ""breakfast"" restaurant smell. You know what I'm talking about. We were seated immediately and took it all in. Lawrence was all into the fact they had soccer on their tv and that they had a zillion choices on their menu. Despite the extensive choices, not too long after sitting down, we ordered. I got the tortilla soup and house salad with ranch, and Lawrence got some omelet and fruit... and was mistakenly given a humongous side of the most delicious skinny fries ever (the problem was quickly remedied by a pregnant lady who worked there bringing him the fruit he actually ordered.) 

The tortilla soup, while not the type I'm used to was SO good, I could not stop eating it. The house salad rocked, especially with the sprouts on top, and the ranch dressing was on par with that of The Mad Onion (aka DELICIOUS!) I didn't try any of Lawrence's fruit or omelet, but the few fries I stole off of his plate were the best fries I'd ever tasted. Yeah, they're that good. 

I have to agree with Bonnie G.'s statement that, ""You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.""  Lawrence kept eating his fries, while saying he should stop because he was tired of fried foods... but they were too tempting, even when blanketed by napkins on top to hide them from view, hehe.  I was so full toward the end of the meal, but my salad was so good, it was hard to finally push the remainder away.  

For our meals + coffee + $5 tip, it came out to $27 and some change. We both confided over our meal that we weren't sure about how good this place would be when we pulled up to the place, but after trying the food, it was super bomb.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,4,2,4,8l0x2Lei3yro8_N0q_isIg

I had the chicken fried steak skillet.  The dish consisted of eggs over medium over a layer of sliced chicken fried steak on top of a layer of potatoes all smothered with a coat of gravy. 

I love greasy and unhealthy foods in general but I am starting to think that my taste buds are slowly changing.  The meat was dry and salty.  I had to continually dip the chicken in the gravy to get some moisture and to mask the salt away.  The potatoes were even worse.  They were doused with a heavy coat of seasoning salt.   I considered wiping each piece of potato with my napkin so that they would be edible.

I drank a lot of water that day.

I do want to mention, however, that service was nice and my wife enjoyed her huevos rancheros.

Ohhhhh... Banana nut muffin was quite good.  It was moist but not very fluffy.    My new old man self suspects that something not too healthy was used to get it that moist.  Sometimes not knowing for sure about something like this is better.",keEGOaAmr6WOmlF99CEDHw,0,0,2,DXGrhHIq7XkDZhkGADdWrA

Probably the best, highest quality ""comfort style"" breakfast offerings I've seen without being overly ostentatious in the presentation, overpriced or over hyped. 

Being good at what they do, there is a slight wait for a table but since efficiency is the norm, local families get in and out without a hitch (with full tummies and smiles on their faces). 

The service and offerings here are top shelf, you're met with kindness and courtesy that accompanies a moist, warm banana muffin. 

I gotta say, because our banana nut muffins were so good.... we ordered a banana nut loaf to go. It didn't last long after we arrived back in SoCal. :)

She began to goad me on to get avocado, which was strange after saying no several times. I repeated that it was fine; at that point i didn't care for it. Eventually I submitted but asked for only a little amount of avocado. She brings me avocado and soon after - the check. I look at the check, no avocado charge. I was happy, and ready to pay. A few minutes later, she sneakily replaces the check with a brand new one. I hardly noticed that she had done that and after looking at the check again, a $3 avocado charge made me cringe. Wtf? If it was your mistake and I said I was fine on avocado, why would you goad me on to get it? Then give me a check without it (again forgetting, but this time you forgot to charge me so might as well leave it), and replace it with a ridiculous charge?

I've been wanting to try this place for a while  now, but the crowds and the wait discouraged me from trying. All the good reviews kept this place on my radar, so when a friend wanted to try somewhere new, we came here. 

The wait was not bad at all - especially because as we waited, we had the menu to look over and wow, there are lots to look. Eggs benedict, omlets, pancakes, skillets and more. 

Today, I went with the Crazy Chicken Omlet (""you're crazy for not trying it""). It's a plateful - so much so that we got a box to enjoy it later. 

Outstanding service - They even have happy/sad face eggs you can display on your table to signal for service

I would probably come here again and again to try the rest of the menu.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,2,0,5,GLksm6WBsCuYDlAiyqduTg

Arrival wait pretty much sucked, did not help that the hostess was on the rude side.

Lo and behold our waitress (Paula) came through to save the day in the service department. She was great from the get go and stayed consistent providing excellent comfortable service that you'd want to get from a breakfast spot after a looooong night out.

Food:

The Check-In Muffin: Meh, nothing great. I'm a big carrot raisin muffin person and this was okay. Complimentary so am I allowed to give it a 2/5? 

The Big Omelette: If it's not called that then it's some synonym of the word big. How impressive can an omelette be? Order this and you'll find out. The way that the ingredients are actually layered in between the eggs is a unique alternative to the usual blanket style omelette. Ingredients a plus. 4.75/5

Potatoes: These need a review of their own. Eggs and I let me know I was not crazy for expecting good side breakfast potatoes everywhere else where I've had them. The seasoning extraordinary...cooked to perfection..add a little catsup and you've got the best potatoes I have ever had at breakfast. 5/5

French Toast: I got hit with an avalanche off the high that I was on. There was something wrong with these. Not so the taste but more of the texture. Even the berries and the whip could not save these. 2/5

Orange Juice Carafe: It seems bottomless for two, good deal, good taste. Freshly squeezed I think. 4/5

Not disappointed with my meal here. The hostess and the french toast need to be reworked a little, get her to shadow Paula and steal Blu Jam's recipe, maybe?

Food (4 Stars): I ordered the corned beef hash with over medium eggs and the banana nut muffin. I'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. The seasoned potatos were DELICIOUS and I wish I could've had more.

We ordered the Cinncinati 4 Way plate with onions. It is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. Our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. It was amazing!!! Who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? Topped with cheese and onions, this is my dish!

We couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. The food is still good after being reheated.

This is a fun place to eat. That is, it is a fun place to eat if you can get a table as they are oftentimes very-very crowded -- especially in the morning.  On those hot summer Vegas days I see people waiting outside but I don't know... That is just not for me. When you want to go is before the weekend AM crowds have hit or on the off-hours. Then, walking in and getting a table is very easy. 

Okay, now that the warnings have bee spelled out, let's get down to the restaurant. Inside, it is very Americana. Plus, the food is very Americana. Basically, what you see is what you get. 

Ordering is easy. As the name of the restaurant suggests, it is eggs and things that go along with eggs. Simply as that. Make your choice and you are all good. 

The staff is always nice and helpful is you have any questions. And, most of the times the other guest are nice though I have been here a few times when the restaurant was deluged with a rowdy or rude crew, however. But hey, this is Vega, what can you expect? 

Eggs & I is attached to a large shared parking lot. I have never found parking to be a problem. 

It is located on West Sahara, so finding it is easy. 

Overall, very good restaurant. Fun and tasty place to eat.

5810960,2012-06-19,1,3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg,"Some Words of Advice for Egg & I 

1. We came in around 10:45-11 and waited for about 15 minutes so I would say any later and you'll probably be waiting 30+ minutes..It started getting pretty busy right after we put our name down. 

2. If you are waiting in line, check out their menu cause they have a LOT of choices. 

3. Wear a sweater/sweatshirt - I know were in Vegas but the place was blasting the AC. Even our waitress had a sweatshirt on. 

4. Order a banana bread muffin, its moist and fresh and a great snack. I ordered one after our meal because I was stuffed from my plate 

5. If you know you can't eat a whole plate of food, get the HALF order. Of course our waitress told us AFTER we finished. 

6. The pancakes were the best part of my meal - order them! Only complaint was that they served it with that fake syrup. (I'm from the East coast, I'm a little spoiled)

7. My sister didn't really care for the cinnamon toast french toast - they didn't look that great either

It was a solid breakfast for a lazy morning, I think next time I would try one of their egg-dishes since they are called Egg & I

We went on a Sunday morning, for a lazy brunch and that's exactly what it was. 

The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about. 

And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me. 

Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect. 

Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right. 

When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly. 

The staff was always nice and sweet. 

This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.

In any event, came to this popular locals' spot in LV. I tried the strawberry filled French toast with bacon and scrambled eggs. I also tried a free banana nut muffin (it's free with Yelp check-in). The French toast was overbearingly sweet. The French toast on it's own without the strawberry madness was moist and fluffy; however, the strawberry filling along with the strawberry topping and the whip cream really overdid it. It was hard for me to finish.

The eggs and bacon were standard fare. Nothing to note. I tried some of my buddy's chicken fried steak. Again, decent seasoning, but tasted a bit too heavy for my liking. 

What stood out for me was the banana nut muffin. It was moist and the muffin top was crispy. Even better that it was free. I liked how it didn't have too many walnuts in it. Nice balance between breading and nuts.

They take reservations on the phone but will only hold the table for you for 10 mins - so I suggest calling as you are on your way.

We had a big group (8 BABES) 

Once we got there it was only a 15 min wait even if there was a ton of people waiting.
Not sure if it was because we called in advanced.

This place is quite large on the inside with ample seating.
A family environment.

They have this thing on the table similar to what I saw at Bubba Gumps where you can turn the sign to make it so that if a waiter sees it, they will help you. See pics!

If you check in VIA Yelp - you get a free Banana Walnut Muffin - but I got one anyways with my meal.
I ordered the Sundance Special which was a veggie omelet with spinach, mushroom & artichoke hearts topped with tomatoes and feta cheese (which would lead to my later food poisoning - not through the fault of the restaurant but mine)
It was super yummy but it was a huge serving so I had to take it home.
FYI; leaving feta cheese in a car for 5 hours is never a good idea.

The waitress is what made me change my mind very friendly and attentive (perfect service). Now to the food, not sure why this place got such high ratings but i wasn't that impressed. They seem to be all about the omelets so the other stuff might not be so good; to start i got a side of biscuits and gravy... more like stale dry biscuits with not enough gravy so again not off to a good start. So the main dish yeah i should have got an omelet but with so many choices i couldn't decide so i got the cabo breakfast burrito... bad choice the burrito was soggy smothered in sauce it was just very un appetizing and the side of house potatoes covered in that texas seasoning was one cold and dry so i don't know if i just got the last of that batch but my experience here was nothing short of just meh nothing that dennys couldn't have filled.

I have a feeling that this place is super busy all the time--the restaurant is packed with people and the service is also super duper speedy, like the servers here are always on their toes to get people in and out as quickly as possible. But they're still super friendly, so I'm not complaining because I love the efficiency of this place. 

F O O D:
Honestly the food here was a pretty big disappointment. For some reason the food here was very very salty--the ham, the sauce, everything. Eating this makes me feel super gross and pretty terrible about myself. Especially because the portion sizes here are HUGE! My friend and I shared the Stuffed French Toast and we couldn't finish it (sorry potatoes :( ). So I recommend sharing just one thing between you and a friend or you can always take it to-go. I thought the Stuffed French Toast was really delicious because it wasn't salty at all, but our friends that got the Eggs Benedict dishes weren't so lucky :(

Breakfast at this quaint eatery was delish!  I ordered the stuffed french toast with a side of bacon.  Egg bread dipped in a custard batter.
