They refused to accommodate because I wanted to order that and was sitting in the restaurant area. (Perfect amount of food.) I don't really care where it's cooked. So I asked if I could get the kids mean which is TINY, $14 dollars and doesn't even come with noodles. So I had to order noodles on the side which was another $3. I don't mind paying for what I want because I know they're a bit expensive, But they didn't want to change anything! The service ungodly awful. Refills took 10 minutes, horribly rude... I won't be back. I don't even want to give one star... TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!",0FzlQghCZJbV82uF1VWzDA,0,0,1,s7MZ6gpT3GXSRTdRXeDagw

The servers were nice.  The menu had a lot of selections.  They also served Chinese and Thai food.  Both times I have been there it was for sushi and not the hibachi, so I can't speak for that.  Thinking back, I can't even remember the name of the roll I tried and remembered if it was good.  Which goes to show it was probably just alright.  The restaurant is nice; and it is dark inside.

The funny thing, I do remember is that every time they brought out a dessert for a guest's birthday, the old school 'happy birthday' song (kids singing) would go on their sound system, haha",4b4tZehvmY1rOfXYXxjNnw,1,0,3,fTePmjuiT--fJ10GZrmEog

The menu has many tempting choices for you to choose from. We had the Hibachi dinner with New York steak, lobster tail, shrimp, and chicken. They were all perfectly cooked and delicious.  Next time i plan to try the sushi too.

Ohjah is a Japanese restaurant with Hibachi. I go to the one located in the crossing of Decatur Blvd and Blue Diamond Rd. It is hard to find a proper parking lot in dinner time. The restaurant is separated as two parts. One is sushi bar and tables, the other one is Hibachi. Hibachi is so popular that we have to wait for 1 hour to came in. There are 3 big tables that can sit around 60 people. Light is comfortable, Aroma smell good, no music here. The noise is very loud because two many people sitting together and some parties also make noise. Server busser and cooks wear nice uniform. Service is good but I see sometimes elderly has difficulty talking with server, a young Asian lady.  I observed that she tries her best serve all customers but there are too many people eating here and she is the only server in hibachi room. Sometimes the refill beverage is not in time. I think two servers may be better at the dinner time.
Food is excellent and affordable. The combination of Ohjah with 7 course is only 32 dollars. The cooking in front of you is also a show that you can enjoy it. Cooks will clean the iron plate very well after finishing cooking. Overall the experience with Hibachi make me feel very good and I definitely will come back.",-eHwUDPxuYwWmonec_iAlQ,2,0,5,Ui41AHYEsgwzHSFNRpQpRQ

192133,2015-01-04,0,sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA,"My wife and I joined friends at Ohjah Japanese Steakhouse (Blue Diamond and Decatur) recently. I was a little hesitant about the restaurant choice because I've never had a taste for sushi, but the majority rules, so I agreed. It was the night before New Year's Eve, and the restaurant was pretty much filled. Chefs were putting on shows at many tables. Patrons were clearly enjoying themselves; the restaurant was buzzing with laughter and excited chatter. Our service started off a little slow, but soon we had our appetizers. Everyone in our group had sushi; mine, thankfully, was cooked. And it was very good! Between the delicious appetizers and the salad, I was enjoying myself in spite of my earlier reservations about going to a restaurant known for its sushi. I could have left at the point and been very satisfied. 

But then the chef - I believe his name is Van - came over to our end of the table and started an amazing display of acrobatic and culinary showmanship that was a joy to watch. He introduced each element to us and was soon flipping things into the air and even flipped a cup into his hat all the while keeping a fast beat with his cooking tools. Fascinating to watch! The scallops and shrimp were excellent, and the vegetables were cooked and seasoned to perfection. But the standout was the steak. The most tender and flavorful steak I've had in years. Melt-in-your-mouth with no fat or waste at all. And we had more than enough to take home for leftovers. 

We left late, and as the chef and then the waiter cleaned the table, we asked what they were cleaning with. Lemon juice, they said - no chemicals. That impressed us. And he said they would clean it again the next morning. Overall, we were very impressed. Delicious food, very clean restaurant (even the restrooms were immaculate), friendly service and a terrific show, too. The Ohjah at Blue Diamond and Decatur is definitely worth revisiting.",woScEL_Ce5ADVz7eBgQWaA,1,0,5,ZXyZlq9WEj-n9XVyOH-jnQ

They've got a great selection of appetizers and sushi on the menu. If you don't like raw fish they serve a large variety of cooked food as well such as chicken terriyaki or noodles. This place never seems to disappoint. I'm always a satisfied customer !!!! Plus, I love the service and the attentive servers. 

Note - I usually order the sashimi salad, its spicy here though. I love that b/c it gives the salad an extra kick. Most sashimi salad I've tried aren't spicy at all, so this place makes it extra special. Different !! The baked green mussel are delish and a must order !!

Let me start off by saying the food here is definitely good. I cannot comment on the sushi, as I have never had it but the hibachi is always solid. Tonight we went and things seemed weird. 

It seems like Ohjah is getting cheap with their product. First, the chef told me he wasn't allowed to use extra garlic on my shrimp (or really use any garlic at all) because it is not procedure and he would get in trouble. Apparently management/ownership was getting annoyed with people asking for extra items and not paying. I would gladly pay for extra rice, veggie, etc. But garlic?! How expensive can a tablespoon of garlic really be. I would have paid for it had he said ""garlic is extra"" but he didn't; he just made it clear he wasn't allowed to use any garlic on ANY meat item other than steak..... Okay. 

Second, I have never counted the shrimp I get on my plate, but I would say they used to give you 8-10 shrimp per order. Today I got 5. Once again, okay. 

This was not the chefs fault by any means. I just feel as though ohjah is getting a little skimpy on their food. Hibachi is not cheap, so I will likely take my business elsewhere next time where they will gladly add garlic to my food.",0XJAqDL_nUBYivOVoiJA5g,0,0,3,xm31qUcOkrAi9qXLsixn2A

From the delicious soup and unique but delicious salad to incredible cuts of meat this place  rocks! Good luck finding a better filet mignon for anywhere near the price. The sushi has got to be my favorite that I've had. It is quite a bit more expensive than some of the more mainstream sushi spots, but too compare them to places like sushi mon would be an insult. They use super fresh cuts of fish and not even the seaweed has that nasty typical sushi flavor. It's really a demonstration on how sushi SHOULD be done. Another thing to keep in mind is the fact you are getting more than food at this hibachi and the show is always amazing no matter which chef you get. Some are funnier than others, but I enjoy getting a different routine every now and then. If you choose to eat the hibachi I strongly encourage to buy a round of sake bombs!

Came here with a $20 certificate so we decided to go big and order the boat. This was a pretty good deal as it included 3 specialty rolls, salmon, ahi tuna, and hamachi sashimi, seaweed salad, and three types tobico for only $45. Just the specialty rolls were $10 - $12 each so it was well worth it. We also ordered the lychee Saki, they had a few different kinds of flavored Saki which are good for those don't like the original flavor of Saki. We were told the boat would take about 15 min but they served us each an order of the house salad as we wait. 

When the boat came out I was very impressed by the presentation. The specialty rolls were OK, but what put the boat over the top was the slices of sashimi. Each slice was about half and inch thick with about 3-4 slices each. The quality of the fish was superb and with each bite you certainly can taste the freshness. In my mind what differentiates a lot of these sushi restaurants is the quality and freshness of their fish. Ohjah certainly displays fresh quality ingredients.

Free hot sake with a yelp check in so i had to pair that with a draft Sapporo which was literally ice cold!

I had the sashimi salad - fish was fresh topped with roe and amazing dressing with just the right kick of spiciness.  

Kids had the chicken teriyaki,  beef yakisoba.  Quality was great.  

My lover had spicy beef -adorned with shrooms, peppers, and carrots.  The beef were chunks of steak.

Pricing is reasonable and we left with to-go boxes.

As the restaurant was being built, and when it finally opened, I remember thinking (with a raised eyebrow), ""Another restaurant in a strip mall... hmm.""  I'm very glad for the overly enticing smells coming from this place, otherwise, I may not have found one of my new favorite restaurants, and a true hidden gem.

Let me just say, right off the bat, that a prerequisite for working at this restaurant is to be one of the most genuinely nice and polite people on the face of the earth; I have never seen such friendly service... EVER.  We are greeted promptly and warmly every time we dine here.  The servers are always very attentive, and extra dishes are removed right away.

The restaurant is divided into two sections: the hibachi grill side, and the regular restaurant side (which includes a large sushi bar, booths, and tables).  Although I have only ever eaten on the regular restaurant side, I must say I will definitely try the hibachi side one day because of the sounds, smells, and action coming from that room are incredible! 

The food is also incredible.  Some of the items we have had are: teriyaki scallops, tempura (vegetables and shrimp), numerous sushi rolls (the Black Widow is amazing!), nigiri, sashimi, miso soup, and the house salad.  All were equally delicious (and I'm finding myself strangely addicted to the house salad dressing -- it is mayo based and surprisingly light).  I did find the teriyaki scallops to have a bit too much of the ""char"" bits on them, but other than that, they were cooked perfectly, and the sauce complimented the flavor of the scallops very well.  The food is always fresh and delivered in a timely manner, and the plating is intricate, balanced, and inviting.  The prices are affordably appropriate as well.

I read in another review that this restaurant would be a great ""first date"" place to go, and I wholeheartedly agree (for the hibachi or the regular restaurant side).  The ambiance is very pleasant with simple and beautiful artwork on the walls, and low lighting, giving it a romantic feel.  At the same time, it is definitely a very family-friendly restaurant, and a great place to come with friends (especially with $2.50 sake bombs!).

Definitely give this restaurant a try when in Vegas, you won't be disappointed.  And if you live here in Vegas, and don't live close to this particular location, there are a few other locations in town (I have been to the Flamingo location recently, and if I were to review it, I would literally copy and paste this review in for that one as well).",W0xbWTsnPfprtFHqI-NWiw,0,0,5,HLGvx8pgno0BHisXk0zKVw

972512,2011-12-27,5,sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA,"Like most of the reviews, the Southern Highlands area really needed a good Japanese restaurant as the area is pretty barren for choice.  Luckily Ohjah opened up in the discreet and empty strip mall across from Albertsons.  The first thing I noticed while entering the place with my wife was the Chinese conversation going on between the hostess and a chef.  Being from Hong Kong, it was a bit of a downer considering we were aching for some quality Japanese food, and seeing the place was ran by Chinese, our expectations immediately dropped.  
    The decor inside is very nice, the lighting is very good, and the staff very polite.  We ordered two lunch sets, the steak teriyaki for myself, and the wife had a steak stir fry.  The waitress tried selling us sushi ( she counted six times throughout our lunch), which seemed ok if we were the least bit interested.  The salad was cold to the point of almost too cold to eat, they need to keep it out of the fridge before serving, but the dressing was decent and could have been worse.  The miso soup is mundane, which probably came in packages you could get at Albertsons or Whole Foods.  The steak teriyaki and stir fry were pretty good, although the tray they brought the food out with smelled of bleach...  Yeah

All in all, it's a decent place.  We just had too high of expectations, thinking a nice Japanese family was setting up shop, only to see frozen to fryer type food.  The real biter is the price, which makes sure we won't be visiting again.

I want to love this place, because it's so close and it's Japanese, however I can't.  I would say to try it though, it's something different in the Highlands area, and it's at least worth a shot.",z8dWMeoanQrtdn4GXbwnQA,0,1,3,x2vFrGTlVp_HEGvyNdU1Tw

I wish they offered All You Can Eat sushi, but they don't so getting the sushi platter or sushi boat would be the next best option. I love their sashimi and nigiri because their fish is really fresh. However, if someone your party doesn't eat sushi, they may not enjoy the selection on the regular menu and it would be more ideal to eat on the tappanyaki side of the restaurant. Lastly, I would have to say that the service is a little better on the regular menu side than the tappayaki side. It seems as though the waiters are a little slower and distracted on the tappayaki side. But on the regular menu side, I have to give two thumbs up to the waiters.

Had it come from my straw, I would've eaten it, but I was unsure where it came from, as it didn't come from our table.  We received a discount and the dish was removed from our check, but after an hour I was really looking forward to trying it. May not be returning..
As for the service, saw waiter a few times in the hour and 45 minutes we were there, but only received one update on the length of time for the yakisoba and kushi.",WYN-B0NZENkxXcHATYHJ1w,0,0,3,q6DQcqmZiCiNwKieSJdWMQ

It was my little boys 13th birthday celebration and his father was there with his girlfriend and family and I was on my way to meet them for a 7pm reservation when his father texted me at 7:03 (I was six minutes late) and said ""What do you want to eat? They are pressuring us to order NOW. I said ""Can you please ask them to wait, I will be there by 7:06, I am 1 mile away"" and both my son and his father were texting me back and saying, ""they are being really aggressive about making us order now so we will just order for you."" 

When I got there and sat down, our cook then showed up with the food prep. Me being the kind of girl that always loves to engage with people, especially in customer service/interactive places like this, grinned at him and said ""Yahhh.. Are you going to do some Magic for us tonight?"" and then looked at my son to see him smile back. 
    The chef BARKED back at me with a scowl on his face saying "" I DON'T DO MAGIC, if you want to see a MAGIC SHOW you go to the MGM GRAND! I cook!"". Then he continued to go on and say a few more choice things. At this point I am flat out humiliated and said jokingly ""Well I am sorry, I didn't realize it was such an insult to ask you if you were going to perform some magic for us"".  
      There was NO SMILE on this man's face and no one at our table was smiling when he said these things.  
  He made me very uncomfortable the entire dinner and that In turn made my poor son uncomfortable.  Twice he slammed down his spatula ( part of the schtick I get it) but it kept scaring me and I would let out a little shriek and laugh and he would just scowl every time it happened.
    Just a miserable experience. He was extra loud, aggressive and just so much negative energy.  Never smiled once. 
 Then they brought out the wrong cake for my son.   We had to remind them and so they brought out the one that we had bought and they sang Happy Birthday to him again, for the second time in a row. I joked to my son that he just aged a year in 5 minutes. 
 We had no sooner taken two bites of our cake when they started bringing out new plates and silverware trying to rush us out of there.  It was apparent they wanted to turn the table over and we felt very unwelcome so we rushed to leave. 
   I would not recommend this place to ANYONE.. EVER.   It's nothing but trying to get as many people in and out of there as quick as possible and they have NO respect for the fact that the customers may want to take a little time to enjoy the hundreds of dollars they just spent.
   I am finding out the name of our COOK and calling to complain to the manager tomorrow. I am sorry but no one deserves to be treated with disrespect when they are spending their hard earned money in their establishment.",6Y7nNnb3d7bb0ZOkcOhNAg,0,0,1,MskdRUnwWkOk5yUe--EX2A

We let my uncle order since they know what's good there besides, it's their go to place whenever they're craving for japanese food..

They served us tea and salad (I love their salad) for starters.. 

Moments later, they served us the order.. it was the ""ohjah boat"" consist of sushi, sashimi and nigiri.. a tempura and I forgot the other one actually.. I really love the presentation of their boat and all the food tasted so fresh and mouth-watering..

I thought it was undercooked so I told the cook he put it back on the flatiron he did for a whole 2 min I tasted it again the chicken was clearly bad it was literally like rubber we could not even bite it. I told them and they didn't care I even had a complete stranger sitting next to us try it and she was wow that is awful. I talked to our waitress she was like well I'll remove the chicken but I have to charge you for the noodles I'm thinking wow what customer service. I then ask to talk to the manager he was like well we took it off the bill I'm like that not the point the point is that now my son has nothing to eat at that point i was disappointed in this place so before we leave my son says can I have a refill of apple juice and they say we have to charge you there's no free refills even after they just screwed up his meal so wrong.

We came in around 6:30 for dinner and I realized the place was packed as soon as we walked in. I saw him as I entered and asked if we could have hibachi for 2. He said ""No, we're full but there are tables out here"". I thought his response came across very short and uninviting. I promised my nephew who I don't get to see often a fun dinner where he would get to see the hibachi chef do all kinds of cool tricks and now that's not happening so I'm trying to figure out if my nephew wants something else there like sushi or teriyaki or ramen, etc...and while I'm asking my nephew what he wants that man rudely interrupted me: ""are you eating here?"" And I swear there was no one waiting behind us. It's not like we were holding up the line. Anyways, my nephew said he wanted sushi so we stayed and got one of the tables in the regular dining area. We got water right away but then sat for about 15 minutes before that same man came to check on us and take our order. As I ordered the chicken teriyaki, he asked if I wanted white rice or fried rice. I turned to ask my nephew if fried rice is ok since he'll be sharing some of my food, and he was a little distracted so before he could answer my question, the man just grabbed the menus on the table from under my arm and walked away angrily. I thought that is extremely unprofessional and disrespectful of customers. His attitude was just indescribably rude and so uncalled for towards me and my little nephew. If he doesn't have the patience to serve, he shouldn't be working in a customer service job. First of all, the food is ok, not that impressive to begin with. I've been to many different teppanyaki places before and I've had better.  Second, I'm paying to eat there. It's not like I'm there begging for free food. I didn't pay to get treated like that.

So this review is only based off the hibachi part of the restaurant.  We have to go back and try the standard menu.

The chefs are funny and engaging! Catch a shrimp in your mouth flipped with the spatula right off the grill! I was the only one on our table to try, everyone else just had it flipped on their plate; When in Rome! err Japan?

As part of the Hibachi grill menu you get: 
1. Onion soup (nice little starter with light onion flavor). 
2. Salad with ginger dressing (warning: they drown the salad in dressing, so maybe ask for it on the side; but I love the dressing so no complaints here)
3. Sauteed veggies.
4. Fried rice or noodles.
5. Your choice of protein. I recommend to spend a little extra and getting the Filet  over  the other steak cuts.  Even though I ordered my NY strip medium, because it was then sliced before plating it kept cooking more and came closer to well done.  The Filet was more tender and ordered medium-rare came to your plate closer to medium but Delicious! I enjoy a good surf & Turf so I also had the calamari which was just ok, Someone in our table ordered lobster and scallops.  The scallops looked amazing so I will try that next time, Lobster looked a little small but what can you expect from a Hibachi grill.

The rice was flavorful and the veggies were delicious, I love me some mushrooms.  (why was the mushroom invited to the party? Cause he was a Fun-gi!).

 
We definitely will return. The bill ran about $40-$50 for two. Not bad for a date night (don't worry, it was an impromptu date night, I'm no cheap date giver). The sig-other definitely enjoyed the experience and the food.

Did i like it? Oh-jah (oh-yea) I definitely did.  Horrible attempt of a pun. Sorry.",-QmmHtp57b3zT79APvRONA,4,0,4,k7IrxtgHx0mDUMlT_yKI2A

Our friend met us there and hubby and I got there it was about 5pm and upon opening the door, there was no one there. No one. Customers or hostess. 
Ummmmmm......so I walked to the left a little and realized that the hibachi area was around the corner in a different room.

We walked ourselves around the room then found hibachi area.
I posted several pics.

Honestly it reminded me of the ""ol'school"" Benihana.......I just was not impressed. You have zero servers and if you get water or a drink you are lucky. The grill master Ven was suppose to be the best but just acted like he did not care that night.

I got the Sushi Fiji and hubby got the Prime hibachi. Mine was just a pile of unfrozen bay scallop looking fried madness and hubby kept telling Ven ""NO I'M ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH"" when he kept trying to throw shrimp in his mouth.

Our friend order a roll and saki......he was also not impressed.

The salad dressing is amazing!!!! I am not a fan of salad, but I loved this!! It is really sweet and doesn't taste like any other dressing I've ever had. Each order comes with soup, salad, vegetables, and the choice of fried rice, noodles, or steamed rice.

The basic entree is $8.95 with the items listed above, then you add whatever else you want. For example, I ordered Filet Mignon and Shrimp Teppanyaki which added $13 to the basic price. I like the menu style because it is  ""Mix & Match"" so you can create the perfect meal.

The steak was delicious and very good quality. The shrimp however had a very strong shrimp taste which I don't like. (I am very picky about shrimp!) After dipping them in one of the sauces provided it was better. Finally, the fried rice was delicious!!

Overall: Delicious and inexpensive teppanyaki dinner! I would say they are in the top 3 :)",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,0,0,4,Rt0BfP4yaLSj4N--UPq9nw

I requested my filet be cooked rare which is somewhat difficult to do when they cut it up on a grill, but it was cooked perfectly. Very tender and juicy. The others enjoyed their meals as well. The onion soup is delicious and even the kids ate it although we didn't tell them it was onion. Loved the fried rice and the crisp tasty vegetables.

We were warmly greeted by the host and seated immediately in the teppan grill room, which appears to seat about 60-70 at six different stations.  They call it a ""hibachi"" dinner. 

If anyone has ever eaten at Benihana's or the Nijo Castle (Newark, CA), I recall paying about $25-30 per Teppan entree.  Here, you pay $8.95 for the Hibachi basics: soup, salad, rice (steamed or fried) or fried noodles.  Then you choose your add ons or what they call ""mix or match"" which is your proteins.  Chicken teriyaki is $4.95, NY steak is $5.95, filet mignon is $7.55, shrimp $5.75 and so on,  There is also salmon, $5.75 scallops ($7.55),  Lobster tail (6 oz.) for $15.95, Kobe beef $48.95.  They also offer 3 basic entree items (not included is the lobster tail, Kobe beef or Halibut) + the Hibachi basics for $28.95. 

I ordered the scallops and chicken, the wife, steak and it is still cheaper than other similar restaurants.  The quality of the food is good. Portions were decent.  The soup was mild in flavor, the salad though was disappointing. The dressing was watery and you could tell the salads were pre-made earlier in the day. 

Pre-tip for our family of four with 2 kid's hibachi entrees (steak & chicken) with sodas and  a large Sapporo was $76.

They do offer lunch. sushi, sashimi, nigiri, and a good selection of Japanese entrees in their regular dining room, which has a sushi bar.

Now I know some of you might not find this too exciting but forget all that if you would to have a go to local habachi or sushi steak house here it is. I have to say this location didn't seem or look like it has a big enough space inside for this but it did. Located next to Lee's Liquor and Papa Murphy pizza it also doesn't look like there is much parking. But have no fear there is plenty on the side and in back. 

Upon entering you will find yourself in the restaurant/sushi bar side. They have a completely separate room for habachi next door. Our service girl was nice and the chef was really entertaining, I was very stoke we got the guy we did because the cook before him didn't look like he wasn't having such a great night. We came here for my Birthday celebration and everyone got a mix plate and I ordered the Ohjah Boat with sashimi, special sushi rolls, nigiri and seaweed salad.

The lobster, filet and shrimp teppanyaki was cooked and seasoned so perfectly. Meat was tender...not dried and tough like (Benihana's) and the shrimp and lobsters had great texture as well not chewy or fishy. The fried rice was yummy very garlicy just how I like it. I also got the Sushi and Shashimi boat for myself. Which is pretty awesome and more then enough food! come with 3 specialty sushi rolls of your choice and 10 pcs of nigeri 6 pcs of shashimi and a side of seaweed salad. BOMB!

No, Seriously, melt in your mouth perfection. The chicken was also fantastic. We took our kids with us and he took the time to cook their portion of the steak slightly longer and cut the steak to the perfect size for even the tiniest of our enthusiastic eaters. We also had a killer waitress who kept our drinks topped off the entire time and was very sweet to our children.

I usually go to the teppanyaki side where you start with a basic hibachi entree which includes onion soup, house salad with ginger dressing, rice (brown, fried, or steamed) OR fried noodles, and veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, and zucchini) for $8.95. The house salad with ginger dressing is good but the onion soup is a little bland and boring. Then you pick your choice of meat. I went with the NY steak (5 oz) for an additional $7.95. My steak was cooked perfectly. You also get two dipping sauces. The brown sauce is for the meat and the yellow sauce is for your vegetables. The prices are reasonable compared to overpriced Benihana.

No issues with service from the several times that I have went. I would only come here for the teppanyaki. I ordered the Ohjah Boat (rolls, sushi, and sashimi served on a wooden boat) on a previous visit. The sushi was meh and a bit on the warm side so I will just stick to the teppanyaki here. This is pretty much Benihana's but a lot cheaper where the chefs do their show with the flaming onion volcano, throw an egg in the chef's hat and split it with a spatula trick, & the chef throwing shrimp in your mouth act, etc. I'm not coordinated when it comes to that so I always decline politely.

The food is cooked exactly the way your ordered it.  It's very tasteful and the sauce they provide work perfectly with the items you order (fish vs meat vs chicken).  

Don't forget to check in because you get a free small sake bottle which was awesome! 

The price is very decent compared to other places such as Benihana.  It's about 40% less than the other hibachi restaurants.

As soon as we walked in the door the staff rushed to greet us and then got down on the kids level and talked to them for a minute. Awesome! They were also very helpful and patient with our many questions about menu items and didn't seem irritated by our indecisivness. 

We made our order and our rainbow roll was on the table within, not kidding, 3 minutes and was so SO fresh. As each dish was brought out and tasted, I was increasingly impressed. I wayyy overdid it on eating but the food was so worth it. The staff was very attentive and observant and when one of my girls started crying, they brought her over a small candy and talked to her. 

They were very polite and rushed to the door to bid us goodbye as well. 

We will be back for sure.",LaF8wiTRp6O42-wBhQIphA,2,0,5,N1OJ3n3rBJHVdwy3KIoVrw

So far, the 1st impression that it gave me was expensive dinning,but after my dinning experience I realized that I was totally wrong. 
It was by for the best Dianne I EVEN HAD.very reasonable price for an excellent quality of food and service. I think that's why the parking lot is always packed~!!!
I'd recommend make reservation B4 you come spcielly on weekends(sushi chef told me)
I set at the bar coz the hibachi was full~(it was an hour wait time on that side) we tried the sushi.The fish was super fresh ,Chef was friendly and funny at some point.If they have a little of time they even make some special dishes not listed on the menu and I got the wahoo, so yum~!!
The manager was keep asking us how's everything and told us about hibachi,such a nice and funny guy~

So funny and jokes were everywhere, such a good time. The manager was incredibly nice as well having come over to check on us after we were served food. 

Really, no complaints. However, it is very different from other hibachi places we've been, taste wise. Different, not bad. And the prices were awesome, $40 for just the two of us. We'll definitely be back.",fbbXmHoCfd6wXMHnkjgDTg,0,0,5,t1MX38FSiMq53Op_g7_r1Q

I had some friends from the east coast come out to Las Vegas to celebrate a birthday and in the midst of planning everything else I suggested this place because she loves the whole Hibachi teppanyaki thing. Now normally people are quick to turn to Benihana's when they think Hibachi however I just prefer to think outside of the box and not run to what everybody else likes. They are a bit overrated in my opinion but that's neither here nor there. Back to Ohjah..

Reservations were easy as pie to make and the young lady who assisted with the request was very pleasant to work with. We informed them ahead of time that this party of 7 would be celebrating a special occasion which was for the birthday girl! We were a bit late and called them to let them know and still are reservation was held and we began the festivities of what Ohjah has to offer. I really love that they keep things super traditional and at the bar they offer only whatever special drinks they concoct, sake hot/cold and wines both red and white!

Our chef was pretty damn awesome with plenty energy he performed many tricks to impress. The chefs attitude usually can make or break your whole experience at these type of restaurants so it's imperative that you luck up on getting one who truly enjoys the job.

It's a platter (shaped like a ship) with all sorts of nom-nom-nom nigiri, sashimi, and your choice of three specialty rolls.  So, so good.  This is a shared plate, and you need at least two people (who are especially hungry) or, more wisely, four people.  

I am a fan of the caterpillar roll, so inevitably this was one of my choices.  Tender eel, firm avocado, nicely packed rice, and tasty sauce - nom.

Ridiculous!! I was really surprised when I saw the menu on how cheap it was. Especially with the great quality of the food here.

I can only rate on the hibachi section (where they cook your food in front of you) since that's the only part I've experienced. You first start out with a small soup and salad. Veggies are already included in your cooked meal. You choose between fried rice and fried noodle (basically chow mein). Then you pick your meat. They have a pretty good range including chicken, NY steam, filet minion, shrimp, calamari, kobe, etc. They really slab a lot of the food with butter, but I assume that's why it all taste so good.

Chefs are very entertaining. They do all sorts of tricks with their knives and try to entertain you with the food. 

The only reason why I am taking off one star is because I encountered 1 chef that was a bit rude. Usually when I come here, all the chefs are pleasant and funny. Recently when I came, the chef asked how I like my steak cooked. So I said ""well done."" He gave me a nasty look and said ""really? Why bother get filet minion then?"" It caught me off guard as he came off like that. In my head, I thought why does it matter? He should of just cooked it the way I requested. I felt like he was complaining because he was impatient and didn't wanna keep standing there just to cook mine. It shouldn't matter how one likes their steak...just cook it. I wanted to complain to the manager, but I didn't wanna make that big of a deal of it. 

So I'm sorry if you encounter a douchebag chef, but most of them are really nice. Just hope it doesn't offset or ruin your night.

So, I was surprised to walk into Ohjah on a Friday night and see the place packed. It's also a sushi joint, but that side of the restaurant had a few open tables. The hibachi side was filled. That's impressive considering they had six cooking stations.

The basic hibachi dinner ($8.95) consists of standard fare -- vegetables, salad, soup, and fried or steamed rice or noodles. I added shrimp ($5.75) and a 5 oz. filet ($7.55) to the mix. The shrimp was pretty good and the filet was cooked medium rare, as ordered, and was tender, as expected.

The best way to judge any hibachi place, though, is the entertainment factor. Our chef -- an older guy -- was ok. He was friendly enough, but all the tricks he did were the same standard ones you see at any hibachi place -- tossing the egg shell in the hat, the onion volcano, etc. He also tossed shrimp to some of the guests (again, a standard hibachi trick) but only to the guys, which disappointed some of the women at the table.

If you like hibachi places, you'll like this. If you don't, you probably won't be a fan. While it's similar to many others I've been to, I'd recommend this place for a fun night out whether or not it's with a date or a family.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,11,5,4,1cMFXCSpVFjea1b7bFsuxA

The biggest upside is the hibachi. Having the chef cook in front of you never gets old to me. The hibachi basic + add-ons were all very tasty, although we noticed the cook did add A LOT of butter when he cooked.

Overall, you should have a good time here. But if you want better tasting sushi in Las Vegas, you're better off at Oyshi, Sushi Tower or Nobu (on the strip).",LUL2M-R107_ovqrLqg7d6w,1,0,3,SqEgiUHSOoGMg0dcfVszxg

I pass by this place everyday and was anxious to try this new restaurant on Decatur and Blue Diamond. On my way home from work, I saw their ""Open"" sign lit up so I called my husband right away and told him to meet me there for dinner.

We were greeted warmly when we walked in and were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar, a booth or if we wanted hibachi. We opted for hibachi. The hibachi room was huge and there were eight cooking stations. 

My husband ordered the Special Rolls Combo for $23.95 and got the Dragon Roll, Spider Man Roll and Kamikaze. I ordered the Filet Mignon hibachi which came with vegetable teppanyaki, house salad, miso soup and your choice of fried rice, fried noodle or steamed rice for $16.50.

The sushi was pretty good... Normally my husband and I like raw fish but since I'm pregnant, he ordered all cooked rolls. I especially liked the Dragon Roll because the salmon was cooked with a nice charred taste. I think I may be used to AYCE sushi so I don't think I sushi would be my first choice when I come back.

I enjoyed my hibachi meal and our chef was entertaining. I watched three different hibachi chefs and it looked like they all had their own tricks up their sleeves. The house salad was good but they were a little too liberal with the dressing. I enjoyed the Filet Mignon very much because the meat was tender and flavorful and cooked to my preference.

I was too full to order dessert but I want to try the tempura ice cream next time. The only three dessert items are ice cream, mochi ice cream and tempura ice cream.

The service was top notch even though they had a lot of patrons. We were checked on regularly and we didn't have to wait long for our food or our check. The service was surprisingly good for a restaurant's opening day!

Even the owner ( or just a very official looking gentleman) came by our table. 

We didn't do the Teppan Yaki so we sat at a regular table. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant is very clean. We got some vegetarian sushi rolls ( avocado and Asparagus tempura) that my wife LOVED. I tried them and they were very good. I got a simple california Roll and it was great too. She got vegetarian Fried Rice that was very fresh tasting with crisp sautéed vegetables. It was great. I got the New York Steak Teriyaki. It was good.

The food was super good. All of the other reviews are 100% accurate. Everything just melts in your mouth. I was a little hesitant about getting the shrimp because previous reviews said it tasted too fishy or something like that. Im not sure if they made some changes or what, but it tasted fine to me.

They separate the meats by section and individual price so that you can mix and match your plate however you want. I chose the NY strip steak and the shrimp. My sister tried the scallops and NY steak. MY father tried the sukiyaki beef and NY steak, and my brother in law tried the Salmon and chicken. 

You start with the $8.95 basics which includes the the option of fried rice, steamed rice, or noodles, soup, and salad. This is MANDATORY for teppanyaki. Then you pick from the list of meats you'd like and you just mix and match. They also offer kobe beef at $50 and lobster tail also at $15. The dishes and offerings are typically what you'd expect for teppanyaki. Same quality and flavor. Next time I would love to try the filet minon instead as I wasn't too fond of the NY strip steak. It was tougher and less flavoring. The sukiyaki beef is A GOOD CHOICE. They're full of flavor, tender, and juicy! 

Our chef was great, He was funny, and very patient with obnoxious children. So big ups to him. For a total of 4 people plus an order of a glass of reisling and tempura ice cream we spent a good $100.00. Woohoo! What a deal! That's compared to my tab at Musashi which was $160.00 for 2 people!

We love sushi and hibachi and have ate at many hibachi type restaurants in and out of Las Vegas. So I was excited and had high hopes of a new restaurant close to home. When we first arrived I noticed the interior, it's beautiful, classy and not the typical Japanese decor that so many other places in town aim for. We were seated and I immediately noticed not only the wonderful smell of others already enjoying their meals, but the menu. Every item is al a cart, reasonable and inexpensive. Considering that we have spent well over $100 at like restaurants in the past for a party of two, I was presently surprised and already liking this place. But let's be honest, if the food is crap.....the prices really are irrelevant right? 

So, we both ordered different meats to try more of the menu. Me chicken, he steak. The chef came out and was fantastically funny, sweet and incredibly skillful while cooking. It still blows my mind the cracking and throwing of eggs lol. Anyways, back to the food. It was great! The rice was fluffy, the vegetables were tasty and the meat was cooked to perfection. We have since ate here many times and we have never been let down, I have tried all of the meat/fish items on the hibachi menu and they're all equally delicious. Did I mention I don't think our bill has ever been over $60 including tip? I haven't tried the sushi because the hibachi is so very good it's hard to try something else, when we usually only go there because that's exactly what were craving.

Give it a couple minutes to cool down because it's that fresh.  

My main entree was a side of steam rice, and sashimi chief's choice (5 assorted).  The Chef's  choice was Albacore Tuna, Salmon, Tuna, Yellow tail, and Sea bass was all refreshingly delicious.  The assortments vary everyday, so get your sashimi  adventure taste buds on.  

Finally, I order their Green Tea Tempura ice cream enough to share between four people.  The deep fried tempura was excellent.  No too crispy, and not too doughy.  I can not wait to come back, and try their hibachi side.  From what I can tell the hibachi section is great, for couples, or a large group.

There are some wonderful chefs like the sir in the yellow hat who is our favorite. HOWEVER, today I had an unpleasant experience with a newer, inexperienced employee.

We brought our friends here and the chef we were given was inexperienced not just for the hibachi show (which wasnt much of a show), but apparently also in cooking. We noticed first that he burned the egg and the portion sizes of food was not enough for the table of 9 people... to the point some people had remnants of vegetables....

The vegetables were not fully cooked- cold and too crunchy. The noodles were ill seasoned. 
My boyfriend ordered a rare stake (we also had rare filet yesterday) and it was RAW. NOT RARE. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE. It was cold like fridge cold in the middle, half was cooked rare and the rest raw. Rare steak is not supposed to be Cold!!!We had filet at Mon Ami Gabi yestrday and it was no where near that infact it was perfectly cooked.

After confronting the manager he kindly went to make a new one for us.

Then. THE PREVIOUS CHEF CAME TO ARGUE WITH US!!!!! HE DIDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE JUST STRAIGHT UP ARGUING! 

The manager apologized for the chefs behavior and generously compted the steak meal. As well as preparing a better one.

I normally love the hibachi here and the chef in the yellow hat, but this one chef was just inexcusable. Thankfully the manager did his best to help resolve the situation.
And also, I do realize that some situations isnt necessarily the restaurants fault but sometimes employees mistakes, the food was still pleasing and at least the rest of the crew was still kind and concerned about our enjoyment- which I do appreciate. The manager even called us later to apologize which is a very honest and respectable thing to do, I appreciate and accept the apology.

Ohjah doesn't rise nor sinks when compared to other Japanese restaurants, they just provide decent food with good service. Their sushi reflected that mayonaise, rice, and raw fish do not bode well together. Our party ordered three rolls but it was difficult to distinguish which was which. Each was slammed with 10 lbs. of spicy mayo and sweet eel sauce over flavorless spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and/or cream cheese. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but the phrase, ""Which roll is this again?"" was spouted during the course of the meal. 

If there was a shining light in the meal, it was my hot entree. I actually enjoyed my spicy chicken. They were generous with their meat, the veggies were cooked perfectly, and it came with soup and salad. However, they should omit spicy from the description. It was more sweet and salty. I asked for extra spice but instead got an extra layer of red sauce. Other parts of the meal included a well excuted tempura. In the end, they gave pre-packaged hand cloths to wipe away all the grime and residue of your greasy claws. They have a hibachi grill if you want entertainment and flames. The atmosphere evokes dark and romantic but the clienteles are big-ass families with waistlines that match.",Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg,2,0,3,vQdytaA_P2v06Ex3biXYTA

You won't hear me say that too often, so trust me when I do. 
The pricing of the menu is more competitive than other Japanese steak houses.  Its $8,95 base price for the rice veggies and soup, then you ad your meats.  We usually have the Filet Mignon plus either shrimp, scallops, chicken or halibut.  The filet is like meat flavored butter, melts in your mouth.   Actually I wish they used a little more butter in the prep, but its always flavorful and healthy. 

We do usually get a tuna sashimi but I will say this.  the fish is fresh and yummy, BUT its cut in too large of chunks.  I prefer a smaller cut for a more delicate taste and feel.  We ate at the sushi bar once and all the fish was cut too large.

But we called on way to restaurant and made quick reservations. We get there and instantly seated. I been waiting to try the hibachi for 1st and 2nd time here and our timing was off, but this time we were in.

So we started with some sake, our salad and onion soup which are both very good! The salad is my favorite. I gave up rice for lent so fried noodles it is. The fried noodle was very good!

I got the combo with 3 choices. I got scallops, filet mignon, and shrimp. I got this the very first time we can here but no hibachi show, it was lunch time. Food was 5 stars on its own. 

Next our show, I forgot his name we had a couple bottles of sake. I guess we were waiting for more people for our table and they were very late and gave us complimentary edamame on the house while we waited. Very nice of them. Our show was the very fun!

The miso soup is good, and because I'm pregnant I haven't tried too much sushi. I did get a tempura shrimp roll once and was disappointed that the batter was soggy instead of crunchy. However, I recently had the shrimp tempura entree, and it was dynamite, so they clearly can make a mean tempura if they want. The tempura dipping sauce was a little bland. Many of their sushi specialty rolls tend to be on the hot side rather than sweet. I usually don't eat California rolls, but my husband did the other day, and it was the best CA roll I've ever had. It left me scratching my head wondering how a CA roll could be so good.

Their teriyaki is pretty good. Sometimes the chicken is dry, but the New York steak is consistently good, and tender for NY. They reportedly make their own teriyaki sauce, and do not use MSG, huge plus.

As for sides, their rice can be inconsistent, but their salads have good dressing and are pretty darn good for iceberg lettuce.

The service is decent, but there are some new servers who do things like put the food on the middle or end of the table instead of in front of the person who ordered it. Usually not a biggie, unless its hot soup they put in front of a young child...

I can only comment on the Sushi Bar since I have not tried the Teppan. I am a Nigiri Sushi addict. I am a big fan of everything in the refrigerated case in font of me at this sushi bar. So if you ask me what I like, I can just point to the general area of the fish and say ""all of that."" The only thing that I have found that doesn't blow me away, and this is strictly a personal preference, was the cure on the Saba. Still better than many others though. The daily specials on the board are well worth the price and I have not been anything but satisfied with anything I have ordered from it. I usually order an appetizer, a meal, and whatever fancies me from the specials board and I am happy.

4837502,2012-10-11,0,sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA,"My review is on the Hibachi dinner, as we did not have sushi when we went. I do want to say that I become more and more dismayed at the number of sushi establishments that don't even offer a simple Spice Crab roll muchless a specialty roll with spicy crab in it. It seems when I ask for this 'unheard' of ingredient they look at me as if I have a third eye or something and unfortunately their answer to spicy crab = ""a california roll with siracha rolled into it"" is unacceptable. For those who do not know how to make spicy crab it is merely imitation crab stick chopped up just like they do for the crab salad with a tad bit of siracha and japanese mayo. The sad thing is that the easy way would be to just chop up a crabstick and mix it with the already available Spicy Mayo.... just sayin' 

But I digress - the hibachi menu requires that you order the 8.95 base selection which is just your soup, salad, veggies and rice. Scroll down the menu a bit and it gives you the selection of meats and fishes that they serve Hibachi style. Kobe beef runs 48.95. We chose to have the Hibachi combo which allows you to choose 3 selections (excluding Lobster, Halibut and Kobe) but is a nice plethora of flavors that you can try as your meal.

The chefs are very entertaining, the meal is exciting to watch and the final outcome was really delicious. We didn't want for drinks until after the show was over and then we had to flag someone down a couple of times. Not terrible but they had spoiled us during the show serving us every time the glass became half empty.

I would definitely like to go back and see if they can do better with their response for Spicy Crab :-)",RdMD77Uwe8Mjy_EptbPa3g,2,0,4,bNa3okszWPU9pBmONWMlHQ

4848228,2014-08-20,1,sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA,"I have been here several times for hibachi dinner and I can tell you that your dining experience here will depend on which chef perform/cook your meal. One chef will give you a 5 stars experience while the other one will make you question yourself for why the hell you're spending a lot of money for a lousy meal.

My regular and favorite chef is the tall skinny (Viet) chef who always does an excellent job entertaining guests and also make a good meal. When you go to a hibachi dinner, you expect entertainment in addition to good food. As for the other chef who cooked one of my meals, granted he was very nice, he basically just focused on cooking the food and not very entertaining at all. Even worse, the food was salty and just overall not good.

Since you are sharing the hibachi cooking table with other guests, I'm not sure if you can choose which chef will cook your dinner. Due to this reason, I am now less likely to take my guests here for dinner, which is too bad since this experience is unique and could be a lot of fun compared to strip buffet.

If you plan to come here for hibachi dinner, make sure you understand the rule of roulette. Your dining experience could land on red or black, and sometimes green :-)",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,0,0,3,5FQdKAOfrBpM1VyAoZ5nBg

we've been to ohjah (or king of the ninjas so the hibachi chef tells us!) on multiple occasions since its just around the corner from our house.  at first, i thought this place wasn't going to do well since the location is kind of weird (off blue diamond and decatur, but in a tiny side shopping center thats pretty much empty).  but right when this place opened, we've noticed its been packed... all the time!

the sushi... awesome!  very fresh and the flavors are great.  they have a ton of variety too.  prices are pretty sushi normal (expect about 10ish bucks for a specialty roll, 5ish for the standard rolls).  we got the volcano roll, tiger roll, and a bunch of nigiri (white fish nigiri... sooo good!).  all the sushi, excellent.  the volcano roll was covered in this interesting mix of scallops and sauce.  my kind of roll!

the hibachi was cool too.  i love the prices... its a lot cheaper than most hibachi places i've tried before.  you pay $8.95 for the hibachi basics then add on your meats for around 6 bucks (more expensive for better meats of course).  the food was pretty good and the chef was truly entertaining.  he was super ninja with his tricks and we all were able to catch the shrimp in our mouths.  boom!

the place is stylish and the service is nice.  their only fault i think is that the waitresses always try to up sell you to more things at the beginning (but it doesn't bother me that much).  

definitely a must try!",JHFuMHQBLuQ3TtkWwx1bmQ,2,3,4,QP8zJcVNeTmzMyFWYqS7jg

Back to the food. I had Filet Mignon & hubby had a Lobster Tail. We shared. Fried rice & veggies. Yum! Yum!

My friend and I decided to give this place a try, she had told me this place had so many good reviews and the pictures made us drool!!! YELP REVIEWS did not lie! This was so gooooooood!!

We started witht he Edame and the wontons.. Very delicious not that pricey about $3.95 each for appetizers..

Then for our entree we ordered the Ohjah boat which consisted of 3 rolls of your choice along with sashimi and seaweed salad for $49

And also we ordered the New York Steak Teriyaki..$14.99

From the moment they served the food we were in awe., Loved the presentation and love how the Boat full of sushi was huge! Loved the detail with the food presentation as well. The sushi was amazing! It melted in your mouth and you can tell the sashimi was fresh with the correct temperature without the VEINS popping in your mouth! As for the teriyaki steak it was to die for!

So in the end we couldnt finish everything.. we didnt even need to order appetizers we were so full we had so much left overs from the sushi and the steaks..

But of course we still made room for their famous tempura icecream which was so good!

I must say you can tell a huge difference when ordering from an all you can eat sushi place.. 

Ohjah is one of my top 5 japanese place and I will of course return  and will be a loyal customer!

All of us ordered the three choice option at the grill which was a lot of food for under $32.  I did shrimp, calamari, and chicken with noodles!  Oh wee it hit the spot!

The ambience is fairly quiet until the chefs do their thing to entertain then the sound level spikes up, but that's the whole experience it's part of the fun.  My kids (8, 6, 5) haven't had a hibachi experience since they were babies so they finally got to enjoy it.

This place was really good. I wanted to make sure I wrote a review because it's somewhat off the beaten path in a small ""strip mall"" area next to a liquor store. Place could be easily missed.

 Tried several items on the menu (some lunch special). For 2 people, 2 apps., 2 miso soups, and 3 sushi orders - came to about $40 w/tax. For apps, had the chicken skewers. It wasn't that bad, but it was bland. I knew to stick to seafood.  The miso was good not too salty. The only roll I can recall the name of is the ""Valintine"" (sp?)

I'm not certain if it's because they're new, but having a website would be helpful, especially because they deliver. Overall, the place was clean, service was quick, and food was tasty.",pLEXc43qeQDjwIyXA0s0Hg,0,0,4,hGRpqaTfpQxP4B21u8Pw6A

5361428,2011-11-19,0,sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA,"**Summary**
       - Ambiance - A little noisy, but the decor was nice. It was romantically lit with big screens over the sushi bar. A little something for both genders.
       - Owners - First Japanese restaurant that I've been to that had Chinese music playing. You usually see them owned by Japanese or Korean in Vegas. 
       - Soup - They said the soup was onion soup, but I'm pretty sure it was winter melon. It's a pretty traditional Chinese soup. They said they also had miso.
**Ordered**
       - $12.50 Unagi Don - A decent sized piece of eel as far as eels go. A tad dry, but not bad. It comes with soup and salad. Good for those who don't want a big meal.
       - $14.95 New York Steak Teriyaki - A fairly large steak cooked to your liking covered in teriyaki sauce. It also came with a crab rangoon, salad, and a soup. Definitely worth trying if you like steak teriyaki (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sYfHxCqHpIX2HnDhw0JRAA?select=KW4CtKWK4DPBM0uOuXgjFQ).

By far the best hibachi in town. The prices are right, the service and cooks are awesome - genuinely nice people there. 

On a couple occasions if we found ourselves waiting for a bit for a few other people to join our cooking area, they've offered a free appetizer or a free drink. Not sure if that is official policy but it definitely was nice. 

The food is amazing. My girlfriend regularly gets the Salmon. I get Lobster and Filet.

Only have had a couple of the sushi rolls, mainly go there for hibachi, but they were great!

Always a fun atmosphere, always someone's birthday.

First of we opted for the Hibachi and I am so glad we did! My fiancé loves sashimi so he ordered the blue fin tuna, I do not really care for the raw stuff only in Miami and LA did I actually enjoy it!! Well I am addicted, that blue fin tuna was so so yummy. He ended up ordering another. For six dollars you get two healthy servings and it melted in my mouth with deliciousness! I am sold that is something  that  I will order again and again!
My fiancé got the trio Hibachi he chose the filet, the scallops and sole!! I ordered the lobster tail. The star for both of us was the sole! It was all delicious but we are still dreaming about that sole!! The filet was yummy and so were the scallops and the lobster but that sole was so memorable and unexpected because I love lobster but the sole was so freaking amazing! By the way my fiancé thought the lobster was awesome, too!
I was not in the mood for sake bombs but my girlfriend that was with us never had one so we decided to get some beer and sake to have sake bombs but the Hibachi chef told us they offer  sake bomb individually which is perfect! Well after the first round we got about 4 more rounds! It was so entertaining the way they do it! We had a blast! The noodles, the soup, the rice, the veggies all so delicious and tasty I had to control myself. Jack was our Hibachi chef and was awesome!! They made us feel so welcomed. My fiancé can chug like no other so they kept giving bigger glasses of beer to try to beat him in the sake bomb challenge, they failed!! Super super night definitely be back again and again! I have already recommended this place to so many! I am so glad to have this place so close to my home Southern Highlands. We like to stay close and anything like that is xtreme sushi! We never feel comfortable and welcomed there and they have some good but a lot mediocre. So this will be our regular spot hope they stay because they are so great and in this economy where people are usually staying home it helps if you treat people right, plus I'd be heart broken if the service was bad because the food was so outstanding!!

Their menu is really large so you're bound to find something you like.  I, myself like their sushi combos because you can choose 2-4 rolls from the menu (a deal on it's own), plus you get some pieces of nigiri sushi and some selected sashimi.  The price is decent also!  However if you do order one of these sushi combo platters and also plan to eat regular food off the menu (that's lots of food by the way), you should probably put in your sushi order first because they do tend to take a little longer to make these combos for some reason.
I never tried the hibachi, but there's always lots of people in there so I assume it's pretty good.

We came here on a Sunday 6 pm but hibachi table was all full. Have to wait at least an hour. They do not serve hibachi food if you sit at regular table. So I highly recommend making a reservation or call ahead if you're going for hibachi. 

The service was great, the manager was very friendly and polite explained to us about the wait. Our chef was also fun and engaging. We get to see lots of cool tricks as usual. 

Food was just alright. The crave for hibachi is all about that buttery garlic soy sauce fried rice! But it was kind of tasteless and missing the rich butter and garlic taste. Disappoint.. but the shrimp and filet mignon was good. I recommend adding garlic butter with your steak - Yum! 

Overall experience - not impressed. It's just what you can expect at an average hibachi restaurant. If we're craving for hibachi next time, we'll probably go for Benihana since now it's open in Vegas!",_KJRnZAxwEPyPhgJzQOxYA,3,1,4,dB8ITDmGxtwgH2Hqx27_lA

It has always been ok... Nothing great, and very greasy. The kids love the hibachi experience though, so we've gone for a couple of special occasions, because it's a bit pricy for what you get.

Christmas night, we finished family get togethers early, and thought it would be nice to grab a bite to eat. The places that were open were packed, so we eventually found ourselves here. We ate in the regular dining room. I ordered the salmon teriyaki. It was horrible. It tasted very fishy, and was so over cooked, that it was actually a challenge to chew.  Needless to say, I didn't eat it all.

Four hours later, I barely made it to the bathroom, and basically stayed there for the next two days. I was SO sick. My friend who is an ICU nurse had to come over and give me Zofran... This is the only thing that kept me out of the hospital, as I literally could not keep anything in me for a little over 48 hours. Merry Christmas to me! UGH.

Do NOT trust the food here. There's no need to pay for overpriced food, that can possibly send you to the hospital.",Rg5nSgIU0bKVy4A-t9-Usg,1,0,1,cVkgOFSMzf5wOJgN60fjSw
