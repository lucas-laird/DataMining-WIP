1555942,2015-06-16,1,RpNJRmL8qcWQgIyvt-DDSg,"Ordered an Italian Trio Pan Pizza & a small order of wings online for delivery on 06/14 at 7:30pm. (ORDER - 3150614213250001183026614)  The food was delivered on time (half hour) and the driver was decent enough. He brought extra parm & peppers so that's an A+!
I'd like to thank PIzza Hut for going the extra mile and unexpectedly helping me get to my ""ideal goal weight"" with just one pizza!!! We got some serious intestinal problems due to poor food quality or handling! 
One of us started vomiting violently at 1am and it continued until 4am!!
Me, well, I got to enjoy my day sitting on the toilet.
More good news; it's going to be a VERY VERY VERY long time until I can think of eating a pizza again without my stomach doing flips. So, kudos, to helping me stick to eating clean!",KE429z8SymByrMVk9_OK0Q,0,0,1,Bci8JTkqsotZ8BNrNfpPfA
1601581,2014-09-19,0,RpNJRmL8qcWQgIyvt-DDSg,"They have improved their recipe quite a bit. The last time I had Pizza Hut was when I lived on the east coast and it was as bad as Domino's during their Noid days. Now they have both made leaps and bounds with their recipes. Their sauce has gotten leaps and bounds better and their dough is decent.

We had the internet only special for a large garlic parmesan crust pizza. They are still limited on their toppings compared to other franchise pizza joints like NO banana pepper as a topping and their veggie selection is weak too.

When ordering on-line one thing that I did not like was if you were getting a pizza w/ 2 toppings you could not get 2 different toppings on each half like how Dominoes lets you do. You can also not request for it to be double baked which i like b/c these franchise pizza joints always tend to under cook their pies (imo). The other bonus is it is literally 2 minutes from our house and since Papa John's doesn't deliver to our neighborhood we've had to look elsewhere for our quick and easy pizza orders for when we're lazy.",3ZCS3niZj8GjbZY6Dx7uqw,0,0,4,pfmw0Td-wL7dMldQtBbhSg

They ran our order as take out and then wouldnt change it to delivery even though it was supposed to be, even though we tried to give them money for the delivery charge, even though it was their fault. They lied about being sorry for not being able to help. They lied by saying its impossible to write an address down on paper and give it to a sentient being driving for their deliveries.  maybe thats the problem..maybe they dont have humans driving? Wow that'd be something. With the kinda dough you need to hire a robot delivery tank army no wonder they dont give a holy fuck about customer service. Total dipshits.
Anyway now Im killing time in this dirty-floored ghetto grease bucket with knappy-ass street freaks pacing back and forth in front of the windows.

I haven't had Pizza Hut in a very long time and it has gotten SOOOO MUCH BETTER!!! I got the $5 deal pepperoni pizza and brownie dessert and the 4 pack of soda, 16 boneless wings and the Hershey's s'mores cookie. The Pizza was loaded with pepperoni and so good!

3308549,2018-04-26,0,RpNJRmL8qcWQgIyvt-DDSg,"So this is our neighborhood pizza hut.  Been ordering  food from this location for a really long time and like a tradition,  always on wing Wednesdays. Today we get one of out orders wrong. They delivered a wrong wing type.  Called the store to inform them of the mistake and to request the correct item. Now this is where my opinion of customer service and ""taking care"" of a customer comes in.  Any other establishment would have apologized and either offers a partial refund,  a notation for a discount on the next order, or offered to redeliver the correct item.  The manager,  Alberto, instead decided to have a tone as if I was trying to pull a fast one and lying.  Kept reiterating that there needed to be exactly 8 wings or I couldn't exchange them even after being told that we didn't even open them.  We already had another pizza orders and coming so he sad he would send the replacement wings withe the new order . The delivery person arrived and inspected the wrong wings and counted each one and took  the wrong ones with him.  In all my years of customer service,  in a service industry,  had I witnessed this type of customer service. I'm just blown away. And it's not the fact we didn't get to keep the wrongly delivered wings its the way he decided to handle it. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth.  Good thing the pizza and wings didn't..",bsazmgu1OqjOVG--qhnEyA,0,0,2,ROkA0Z35QzgpbYV3_ODroA

The storefront is clean, manager and employees have always been nice and helpful. A while ago I received a pizza with no sauce. And I've never had that issue again. I emailed corporate vs. calling the store, which was my mistake. I think if I would have just called they would have handled it beautifully. Corporate never got back to me. -.-

Be sure to use your pizzahut.com account to accumulate points, for every 3 or 4 orders you will gain enough points to get a free medium or large two topping pizza. Really worth it to me! Use that along with wing Wednesday hookup to get pizza and wings for about $5! You can't beat that anywhere. 

There will be your handful of homeless stragglers around, just enjoy the scenery and get your pizza.",qfP7mVenCRYqijLiWOIWUQ,3,2,5,PZigjuXcKe-3zQsq0S0WEA

3823059,2017-08-17,0,RpNJRmL8qcWQgIyvt-DDSg,"I have a BIG issue with this site on Charleston and Bruce. That problem has to do with customer privacy and confidentiality! I ordered my pizza online so I could pick up my pizza, which is convenient because I didn't have to wait, but right when I walk in I see my wife's full name plastered on a big screen tv hung on top of the right corner of he wall behind the counter.. you never know what kind of person could look up your name to possibly create identity fraud or harassment situations.. besides the fact that it was the first thing I saw coming in, they had no menu displayed anywhere which brought my attention immediately to my wife's full name. 

I would definitely recommend taking down the person's last name which will prevent everyone from seeing it and protect their privacy. An alternative way to do it is by using First name only and last initial, or last 4 digits of phone number.

Gina who says she is the manager which I don't believe because this would have been handled more correctly just told me I can't get a refund after they bought me a undone pizza last night and again this morning. I asked her if u can get a refund and give them the pizza back she said no. What I never been to a pizza hut so inconsiderate they always remake it no matter how many times till they get it right it's not like I ate the pizza I still have it I'm gonna get my money back one way or the other happy I paid with a credit card and I can charge it back and I can't wait to talk to corporate tommorow and report this fake general manager,E0sj-8UBjbylkz5K7h1_Ng,0,0,1,Q1jMlSnR6QRRWPBbuOKi3g

Took a chance on this one a few weeks back as my wife loves PH and I was amazed.  We grew up eating Pizza Hut but as time went on and there are now so many pizza joints everywhere I stopped doing Pizza Hut.  Anyways, we ordered wings and pizza here and had it delivered downtown Las Vegas and it was phenomenal.  Not sure if they are doing their wings different now but they came in a round type box and they were crispy and hot.  Usually places bring them in cardboard and they are soggy (Dominos the last few times).  

Along with the wings we have ordered the pan, thin and crispy and a hand tossed I believe it was.  We've ordered three times now from this location on Charleston and the pizza and wings have been great and the delivery has been super fast.  Overall a very solid location and we will continue to order here on our weekend pizza nights.",BXSUe6os4jS7lNQGyo77ow,0,0,5,rqzet9FhKc3xYw5zQ8gf8Q

I'd recommend calling ahead their ETAs have been pretty accurate in my cases. They also honor Groupon coupons which was awesome. Some of their toppings prices don't make sense to me which is why I rate 4 stars.,K8ZE-biKcFS6rdb332bRUw,0,0,4,w3lflM8lvEnXqSZ9rE9CIg
