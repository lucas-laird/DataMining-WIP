A very rude lady. No greetings, no eye contact, and does not speak when spoken to. Her response to saying that she shouldn't be rude to customers was, literally, ""I don't care. Talk to the manager."" I was very confused regarding her entire attitude and demeanor. I would not recommend anyone going to this location because of my experience today.",Km6EroiHMdpMjDhCLBCQhg,0,0,1,D5imKcpUPoTybyd526m6Fg

1822383,2012-04-02,2,ta8x5JgBJnKaDWfYvpEYnw,"Aaaaarrrggghh!!!! Why didn't I check reviews of this place before eating here with my kids. Maybe I was desperate because they were starving and they like Panda and the place looked like a carbon copy. I always thought Panda was suckiest chinese food; Boy was I way off on that!!!

Where do I even start?!?! We all ordered a one item and rice combo, both my kids ordered sweet and sour something or other and I ordered Kung pao chicken. The rice was just blah and my Kung pao chicken should have been called Kung pao veggies because there was only a marble sized piece of chicken and a few chicken crumbs hardly worth what they charged and no spicy-ness anywhere to be found. My kids chicken was mostly bread coating with sauce. None of the plates had any flavor and the portions were minuscule to boot. For the three of our plates and three drinks came out to over 30 bucks. I never felt so violated.

I know this stuff is on par with mall food; strike that, after eating here, I would gladly overpay for mall food. This was a tragedy of ingredients thrown together by non caring robot employees and way overpriced for the tasteless food and portions you get to even bother wasting any of your money, heck, McDonald's sounds like gourmet fare compared to this place.

Bottom line: don't Manchu Wok.....Manchu RUN the hell the other way If you happen to find yourself in front of this place!!!!",YUFtm3BB4NM6IyPSQgAzkQ,2,2,1,UB2tKJDy6_SnhCITy8Fjng

I headed to the casino, ordered a Bloody Mary, then went to go find food. The pizza looked old, I didn't want McDonalds, Rubios Fish Tacos did not sound appetizing at 1:00 AM, and the chicken place was closed...Chinese it is!

I got a one item combo plate with nothing else for $9. I asked for half and half fried rice/chow mein, and I ordered their sesame chicken.

The rice had zero flavor and was pretty old tasting. The chow mein also tasted horrible and the consistency of the noodles was gross, and the chicken was so sweet it was literally like eating pieces of candy. I went back and got some soy sauce to try to liven up the bland food, but even soy sauce couldn't help it. 

I gave up and ate some of my friend's Chicken McNuggets from McDonalds. Stay away.",rrTmcv7FtbwgjAinmS9uTA,6,5,1,RWiB_SWQ0icBDTClYlLHAw

I get it.  It's Vegas, I'm in a casino hotel, they have to soak me.  It's probably in the corporate charter: ""Overcharge on everything"".  Still, if you're going to give me a place of shitty food, at least fill the plate.  The food costs perhaps a dollar to make per plate, maybe two.  In NYC you're out the door for six bucks with a can of Coke.

Nah, the place is a complete ripoff.  Do not go here.  Ever.",dwh3oVr72IhVttaWeV9AIQ,1,1,1,SeBEtdUq1WSMGPyY-3pRig

The Kung pao  chicken wasn't even spicy or had any flavor. Neither did the fried rice and noodles. The best thing in my dish was the steamed vegetables. I would get those again. $25 for two 2-side meals and the large soda.,Y7yuNThJFQFJ1Jgx-T11WA,0,0,1,MBW3job5MKqFw3PqtV0LUg

From the outside, it looks just like panda express, the food items are even similar, but the taste it terrible.  The items just feel like fried, salty, blocks of flour (got the sweet sour pork).  The rice was way overcooked and dry (probably felt this way from sitting around for so long).  Price is way steep for what you get.

Kung Pao Chicken was equally bad, Chow Mein was unflavored noodles with cabbage. It is a food court but service is very poor, the woman at the counter clearly feels like she is doing you a favor serving you this food.  I was hungry and tried a single bite of each item and then tossed the entire meal.  There are decent food courts in Vegas, based on Manchu Wok, this is not one of them.  Hopefully with the remodel the Monte Carlo will step it up, this food shouldn't be served anywhere.  Oh and it was $12+ for a very small portion of each protein and a large portion of boiled noodles.",0-Qk4XJNYZmpTUwUHVfS5g,0,0,1,KaQXTlL0I8k-PdSS239tVQ

3977578,2015-09-29,3,ta8x5JgBJnKaDWfYvpEYnw,"After spending the early afternoon relaxing in the Monte Carlo sports book, I realized I was getting very hungry.  Knowing that my husband wasn't going to leave the sports book for another 3.5 hours until football was over, I ventured into the Food Court.  I stumbled upon Manchu Wok and saw that they offered Egg Drop Soup and I was sold.  It seems like all businesses in the desert like to blast the air conditioning, so a nice hot soup was just what I needed.  I ordered an Egg Drop Soup and a Chicken Egg Roll to split with the hubby in order to tide us over until dinner time.  The soup was gigantic!  It must have been a quart!  Had I known that, I probably wouldn't have ordered the egg roll too.  The soup was good and definitely hit the spot.  I was disappointed though that they don't offer crispy noodles.  I really like putting them into my soup.  The Chicken Egg Roll was good and had a nice flavor to it.  I made sure to grab some duck sauce for the egg roll.

Overall, a decent option when you're looking for a quick bite in Monte Carlo.",NiHQDtfUigKLYjtm3FYKSw,3,3,3,bXx5owdQivMyC6VaTLz23w

I was staying at the Monte Carlo, it was late at night, everything else was closed, & I was so exhausted from the day that I did not want to leave the hotel again. As a vegetarian i do not eat McDonald's, & I had already eaten pizza 3 days in a row, so all that was left was Manchu Wok. I am no stranger to mall quality Chinese... but, wow.

They do not have vegetarian entrees, & ran out of vegetables and would not cook more even though they would be open for a couple more hours. The other food that was not an option looked hard and dry. Obviously, they cook just one big batch of food in the morning and let it sit all day and night. 

I ended up getting just a side carton of half fried rice half chow mein. It was a tiny box for $6! Well I guess good thing because I wouldn't have wanted any more. It was tasteless, and had no other ingredients besides rice or egg noodles. No added veggies or egg or anything. It was only palatable with the insane amount of Sriracha I dumped in the box.",yto6NRayrXZRJ4zo_dSHmA,1,1,1,m_hHP-bhyfMH2z3yqU3GBg

two waters and two Soda's

No flavor, and average as the day is long with Restaurant style pricing.  If i was starving to death and found one in the desert,  I keep walking and look for a McDonalds or a soup kitchen or a dead animal  anything but Manchu WOK.

id rather eat my own puke re-regurgitated (and yes thats what i meant lol) nothing could have saved that food.

everything that could be wrong with it was.
first the basics, the portion was over priced and small
the container was something that should be used to bring home, not to eat out of
lastly, the place didnt look all that clean, but wrote that off as it just being the strip and vegas.

now the bulk....
the smell was off
it looked gross
the chicken was chewy and crunchy?
and just the most vile thing in the world- the sauce was just
