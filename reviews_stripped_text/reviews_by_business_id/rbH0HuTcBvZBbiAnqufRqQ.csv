The carne asada was of good quality beef for the price, unlike other places that used cheap greasly beef. The shrimp tacos are made with deep fried breaded shrimp which I did not know because they aren't advertised as such, but they were still good. All in all they were good tacos, for a fair price.",ey7I8HrjnmfPWURkEDBTPQ,0,0,5,JBJGTLrrPswSvHMRBkGEqg

107541,2014-02-13,0,rbH0HuTcBvZBbiAnqufRqQ,"So the homemade tortilla's are really good, but everything else is just sort of decent. But that's not a bad thing. The menu is pretty basic, so don't expect your standard array of Mexican combo plates, because they don't have them. You basically pick your poison--taco, burrito or a bowl, with a meat choice and if you combo it for $6-8 you get rice, beans and a drink. That's it. 

My mom really wanted a good tortilla with beans, so I went searching for a place with just that. She had the tacos with the chicarrones verde and lengua. She loved them both. I'm not a meat-eater, so I had their breakfast burrito, which is usually made with eggs, chorizo, rice and beans, but they were very accomodating and made the burrito to my exact specifications. I only which I would've gotten my burrito fillings in a bowl and just ordered a side of tortillas. 

The food is simple and basic, but still very fresh (one HUGE exception being the chips, but you didn't come for that anyways, right?), affordable and not in the least bit greasy. Oh and the service was awesome! The lady working the register was very nice, very attentive, and personable. It really was just like eating at a friend's place you've known for years. 

Do yourself a favor. Don't come here with super high expectations, because this place isn't trying to revolutionize the taco. It's not their schtick. But do still try them if you're in the area, because the tortillas were pretty damn good. Word to the wise, the red salsa/sauce that they have in a squeeze bottle wasn't that great. If you must drizzle a condiment on your food, the green sauce was much better.",8zb_IBPGPJjh97qe98BDWw,0,0,3,3UX6TA-xBDb_RzENoUCnaQ

The cashier  (could of been the owner, with the passion & pride she showed for ingredients and menu items) was very welcoming, and after quick chitchat finding out we were new customers she was very informative on ingredients and preparation for items we picked.  I wasn't quite sure about the combination of ingredients for my shrimp burrito. It was great. It can't be compared to other shrimp burritos I've had in the area because Abuela's shrimp burrito has a different flavor combination that's refreshingly different and it does make other shrimp and rice burritos seem plain. As for what my family had, I can't remember. We didn't share and no leftovers. Lol.  I wish We would've tried Abuela's sooner.",reDk21yGrkUGAVZx4Fg8Tw,1,1,5,3DktTztVjBmooAhJrYTAvw

391720,2012-04-21,0,rbH0HuTcBvZBbiAnqufRqQ,"Discovered this place thanks to Now Deals on Groupon, $5 for $10. Most, if not all the combs were under $10.00. I had the taco and gordita combo which comes with a drink and a choice of chips/salsa or rice/beans. You get to select what meat you want and looks like there is no additional charge for shrimp. I picked the carne asada. I added the chips and salsa and flan. All of the food was delicious and reminded me of homemade meals of my grandmother : )

I especially loved the gordita. Instead of a deep fried thick corn tortilla it was made out of thick flour tortilla. A way healthier option without sacrificing taste. The beans were flavorful and the rice moist. No skimping on the meat, it was lean and it was some of the most tasty, I have ever had. They also included a grilled green onion and grilled jalapeno.

We ordered two plates of the huevos rancheros, which were far from traditional, and paid $25!!!  I was not very happy, epecially since it was just two cooked eggs (not the way I ordered them) on top of two tortillas (not hand made) and an abundance of chopped up tomatoe and onion on top! WHAT!? Are you kidding me?! and for $8.95 a plate... I was better off cooking breakfast at home! On top of that for some odd reason we were charged for 6 xtra sides of tortillas!!! WHY!!!??? On top of -THAT- there was no cheese or sour cream added to the huevos rancheros, which is a pretty traditional part of the meal.. I wouldn't dare to ask for them to add that, because then we probabably would have surpassed $30 for a BREAKFAST for two people. We won't be going back that's for sure.. you can find better quality for that price.  This was a to go order, I did call and complain and they agreed to refund my money charged for this ""extra side"" of tortillas.. It won't make me or break me, but I would rather put that money in my jar which is used to buy toys for the less fortunate children during the holiday season, than to give it to a ridiculously over priced business. 
They also downgraded me when my co-worker went to pick up the money..  I guess they didn't appreciate me for complaining.. Well did not appreciate them for over charging me for less than a satisying meal!!!",eV8KJITfaiACQp7e04vZKA,0,0,2,sfnndRZ7NBepLx8yzjTsvQ

Unfortunately in Vegas they're far harder to come across. Luckily I was working on the east side and Ranae W reminded me of this spot.

Abuela's is clean with a simple menu of tacos, burritos, gorditas, and combos. They also appear to have recently added enchiladas, another favorite of mine. Order at the counter, help yourself to the salsa bar, and wait. My takeout was ready quick and the ladies who helped me were friendly. 

I tore into my order- 2 gorditas, one asada on corn and the other barbacoa (another hard thing to find in Vegas) on flour, $3.75/ea. If you're familiar with arepas, they're a similar pocket filled with beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and your choice of protein.

A bunch of us came by after whacking some golf balls at the range and we took up the entire middle dining area. I think there were 16 of us all together and we basically put some tables together and made one giant table to accommodate us which was also nice.

I ordered the two asada tacos with rice, beans, and fountain drink combo.  It was good but nothing really stood out except for the tortillas. There were nice chunks of steak but not a lot of flavor. The refried beans and rice were also very basic.  They did 4 or 5 different hot sauces.

I like there pineapple and fruit drinks that were next to the fountain drinks selection. Which I drank a lot of because I was very thirsty and they were delicious.

You might notice a few deals for this place. 1 free charro with a purchase of a combo when checking in with Yelp app, which I passed on at the end, filled with drink. $5 for $10 Groupon which I also passed on.

They have weekends specials for menudo and 2 other items, I am a fan of menudo.

I have tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and both were able to satisfy my hunger at the moment. The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!

My favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i'm not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.

It took 16 years, but I finally found the place that serves a bean & cheese burrito like I used to get in San Diego. Seriously, you would think this would be super easy to find. There are nine million taco shops in Vegas. Probably close to the same amount as San Diego, but the food just has never been up to par. 

Step in Abuela's. 

So I have to admit. I have a weird thing I do at taco shops. I totally understand if you judge me after reading this. I ask to sample the beans. I know, it's silly, but my favorite thing in the entire world is a bean & cheese burrito (I'm a simpleton). So if I'm going to commit to a 1/2lb pile of beans I want to make sure they're the goods. More times than not they're okay, just not great. I knew my world was going to be rocked when I asked to sample the beans and the girl up front got super excited and said I would love them. I did. The burrito was absolutely amazing. 

The only thing I'm sad about is that there aren't more Abuela's locations in the valley. This spot is pretty far from me, but worth the drive.

Also, the chips & salsa were killer. Salsa was fresh and flavorful, not a ton of heat, just the way I like it.

It was Sunday morning around 10:30, and there were three cleaned out bowls of Menudo on an empty table.  This is when I  looked back at the front door to see if I warp back to the past decade, and was about to get mobbed by a group of kids trying to sell me Chicklets.    No Twilight zone episode came about on this visit, but this Taco experience was pretty close of bringing back some memories at back street hole in the wall in Esenada.

Thanks to groupon, I bought a 5.00 for 10.00 special from them, and ordered a Taco and Gordita combo, and a couple of tacos from the front counter.    The counter girl was very friendly, and took my coupon with a smile, and told me that everything will be out very shortly.   As I sat down at the table, again I got another flashback when I looked outside...damn, this part of Sahara looks like Ensenada.    I had some pretty incredible party times in that part of Mexico, and started to remembering about those Tequila girls slammers, which was next door to a place that looked like this restaurant.   

My meal came within 7 minutes, and most of it was Carne Asada gordita, and one Barbacoa taco.     The went after the Gordita first, and this was my favorite of the entire meal.   They do grill it over a gas open flame, and it had good flavor, and more than ample of amount of meat.    The Barbacoa was very moist, and they almost can pull this off without any salsa with their version of this meat.    The rice, and beans were pretty generic, but isn't most places in Las Vegas at this price point.

Why a four start?   They forgot to give me my chip and salsa, and didn't tell me where's the salsa bar was located.   I walked up the counter, and was about to asks for salsa, but I noticed the three ketchup size squirt bottles in front.. 

They do serve most of the top Mexican beers, but this was the last thing I wanted to drink in a place like this.( For personal reasons..lol)  The food is great, but I didn't want Rod Sterling coming out, and telling me...you just drank a case of Tecate and giant bottle of Tequila , and you just entered the twilight light zone.

I came on a saturday night around 6pm and it was packed. The sole motivation for my group was to give these hot cheetos tacos a try. After placing my order despite the long line, my food came out right away, which was steange because there were at least 5 people before me that still hadn't gotten their food. We let this slide because it seemed as though they were slightly understaffed. But lets talk THE FOOD. The carne asada itself to me was delightful, not too fatty, full of flavor. But the letdown to me was the hot cheetos shell. We all felt as though it was red food coloring. There was no heat, there was no flavor, it may as well have been a normal tortilla shell. Then they advertise if you give a yelp review you get a free churro. Don't waste your excitement. It was hard, only had cinnamon on one side and lacked flavor. I was disappointed because they tried to step out of the box and weren't able to commit. I think if you are in the mood for a chip shell you are better off going with the doritos taco at taco bell. Sure your meat won't be anywhere as good as abuela's but at least you will get what you were expecting.

They make handmade tortilla... it was good! But the carne asada meat is bland and not juicy. 
The taco is pretty much tasteless and dry. I ""think"" (not 100% sure) its because they cooked a big batch whenever and just let it sit there, unlike other taco places. 
$2.50 per taco.... decent price for the size, but I can get with the same price, better seasoned, and freshly cooked carne asada meat with ""Guacamole"" at Pepe's or Tacos el Gordo and they cook the meat there when they get orders and not make big batch.",K-6hCQ6loRdQcIU3KTV_Ig,0,0,2,m4rWw8m4aa4euIroXA9YsA

She was very pleasant and informative when I asked her what they put in the tacos. The first thing she said was that the tacos are not spicy and they don't put sauce in them.  What a relief ! !! Anywho, I got the number one which is your choice of any two tacos, plus a side of rice and beans, and a drink.  This meal only set me back 7 dollars. The corn tortillas are home made and they are the best tortillas you will ever eat. I got a fish taco and a taco de asada.  After picking off the cilantro, I dug in. Both tacos were delicious!  The fish and asada were perfectly seasoned(not salty), the rice was not soggy, and the beans were so fresh. I checked in on Yelp so that I could get a free churro with my combo meal. My only complaint is that they don't make their own juices. If you want authentic Mexican food, go to Abuela's Tacos. I promise you won't be disappointed.

The chicken was good. My favorite was the chicharron verde (although it's spicy so not everyone may like it, but I LOVE spicy. Bring it on!) 

The woman who took my order said they're known for the barbacoa. I wasn't impressed with it. It was bland, like it needed salt and pepper. The fish was also disappointing: pre-cooked and oily with really thick batter and very little fish.

We shared a taco combo which came with two tacos with rice, beans OR chips and salsa, but a few of us didn't see the OR part and we asked for chips and salsa as well...Oooops! The chips were stale and we just pushed them to the side. Wifey got an Asada Taco, and I got a Lengua Taco which was very soft and tasty, and the sides weren't bad either.

I'd be hard-pressed to name another place where everyone there is so cheerful, helpful, and friendly. It's like they honestly enjoy working there, lol.
   Friendliness is nice, but if the food sucks, I'm still not coming back. We've tried 4 different combos, and they all rocked. Last time I got the burrito, and this time I got the quesadilla (stomach is still a little tender coming off Hawaiian fish food poisoning). Both were really good. BF is hooked on the gordita. We both got a churro last time- we got the nice surprise that they are caramel churros- even better than they sound. Unfortunately their flan is so popular that they were out last time, but I got some today- I don't think I've ever come across a flan that was creamier than this is. 
   The decor is pleasant and the environment definitely matches the theme.
   I think what pushed it over the edge was how incredibly nice they were to me in helping me out with my tender stomach- this was the first solid food meal I've had since the food poisoning, and by far this was the right place to go to.

Let me tell you that my daughters quesadilla was so bomb. I wished that she didn't finish it so I can finish for her. It was amazing. It came out hot and cheesy. The cheese was so good. 
My burrito was also yummy. The size was perfect and it didn't fall apart. 
We went back and I got a Gordita de Chicharron and language taco. I loved the Gordita. You can tell they make everything from scratch.  The Lengua was tender and juicy. My husband and I are always pleased and are surprised that we don't go there as often.

4720975,2017-08-15,0,rbH0HuTcBvZBbiAnqufRqQ,"I can see why Abuela's has been voted best tacos in town before. It's a step above your usual Mexican fast food and well worth going to if your a taco lover. I also don't know anywhere else in town that makes their own tortillas to order for tacos.

Abuela's has a fairly typical menu for a fast/casual Mexican place. They have taco's, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc... The one notable thing they have that most other places don't is gorditas. If your only experience with gorditas is taco bell, then your in for a very different experience trying one here. The gordita is pretty much a taco with a much thicker tortilla, and they aren't for me but many people love them.

They have all the usual meats that most Mexican places have. My two favorites are the carne asada and barbacoa, which are both well seasoned and juicy. One meat they have that isn't that standard is the green chili chicarones (fried pork skin), again, not my thing but very popular.

I've had a few different things here, but the tacos are what stand out. This isn't one of those places that serve small street tacos. The tacos here are fairly large and a two taco combo meal should be more than enough to fill you up. As mentioned above, they make all their tortillas in house and to order, and that really is what makes their tacos stand out amongst their competition.

Their prices are also very reasonable and you can't beat the $7 dollar price tag on the two taco combo meal. You get two tacos, a drink, and choice of beans and rice or chips and salsa (I would go with the beans and rice). if you want to try a gordita you can get a taco and gordita meal for only $1 dollar more.

All and all, Abuela's is above average for Mexican food, but has truly fantastic tacos. If your a taco lover, you really should try to come here some time for some of the best tacos in Las Vegas.",nGGTEoAQ214j3ReN8Pwy4g,4,0,5,KDyEiwbgWY9zmEXhY7vZ7g

The Gordita combo comes with beans and rice,a Gordita which is like a sandwich and a taco. For the taco I got Barbacoa and the Gordita I ordered carne asada. The Gordita was stuffed with meat, beans and cheese along with lettuce tomato and sour cream. The bread in the Gordita was perfectly fresh and soft. The taco was dripping with meat juice from the Barbacoa and the tortilla was fresh and hot. Beans and rice were standard but well done. Boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his menudo and even though I'm not a fan, I appreciated the fact that it wasn't swimming in oil and fat. They offer salsas by the register. There were three to choose from. Green salsa verde standard, a red sauce not very spicy but garlicky and delicious and a creamy orange sauce super spicy I'm guessing it was habanero. I ate a bit of it then switched to the red one because I couldn't handle anymore. The red one was overall my favorite because it had a very nice garlic flavor to it that I loved.

The 1st time I ordered the cheese enchiladas with verde sauce(mind you it was real mexican cheese!!!! Yummy).  I am hard to choose meat my 1st time into a place, until I can taste my man's order :) He ordered the Carne Asada Bowl.  The Carne Asada was the BEST I have had in Vegas....probably any taco shop. It was well marinated and melted in your mouth tender.  They come with chips, salsa and a drink. Great combo (Or I guess you could have tortillas also) So my next visit in I thought...I have to try the Carne Asada, so I had the carne asada buritto, with chips/salsa and a drink, my man again had the bowl.  I was so happy, it was as good as the 1st time. The burrito is perfect. Beans, rice and carne asada...LOVE it!  
The 3rd time I ordered to go, 2 carne asda burritos, chips/salsa, 2 drinks. I was sad. The meat was not as tasty, had fat and grizzle, had to take out a few pieces from my mouth...that is the one thing I cannot do.
The 4th time I went... I went on a saturday.  It was busy as I expected it to be. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla, I thought I would try the meat one more time.  My order got lost and I finally went up to ask when it was coming out and they said the ticket wasnt there so they would get on it, this was after about 15 mins or so of waiting.  Then another 10 minutes and it finally arrived. :( sad again.  Meat was nothing like it was the 1st two times I went.  
The service is great except for the Saturday. 
 I love the beans, rice, salsa, chips, and enchiladas...so I think I will stick to those items.  It is just so hard to find carne asada the way it was our 1st two visits... If it stayed like that... this place would be impossible to get into because it was delicious. 
I do however want to try the barbacoa...that is hard to get perfection as well...but I am going to try.
Great job ladies...delicious food!

Went today (11.7.17) had the barboca bowl with chips and salsa, but ordered 2 tortillas on the side...my man had the Carne asada tacos...he loved the tacos but he really loves the bowl...my barboca was delicious...cooked to melt in your mouth perfection! 
As I said before...I am just super picky about my meat but this truly is the best Carne asada I have ever had and the barboca is something I would definitely order again!!!",KQkyAtAiSAfxSQ3GCd0QUw,3,0,5,4beNnnnqnrXUxwxJ41GgVA

They wanted something quick to eat but not fast food (you know, the Taco Bell / Burger King crap). I recommended Abuelas since its down the street from the house. They said OK. 

(Now just a primer here -- My dad is a semi-quasi professional chef (has pro training but just uses it at the house) and a very finicky palate - junk food just doesn't cut it. My mom likes the finer things in life but will eat Taco Bell and such if forced)

So we arrive on Taco Tuesday around 3p, a few people inside. Pops was kind of thrown off by the walk up and order from the counter (as he is a menu and full catering type), but the lady by the counter was extremely friendly and had Dad communicating. Mom was in awe that the gal in the back was actually hand pressing home made tortillas. The order was 2 carne asada burrito plates (me & pops) and mom gets 2 carne asada tacos, chips/salsa & side of guac.

Mom's easy, plows into the tacos. Loves it. Loves the pico salsa that comes with the chips, liked the green hot sauce but didn't care for the red thicker hot sauce. Guac was good, real avocados but not much else, no problem. Roasted pepper devoured. 

Dad kinda picks at the plate at first and I think, ut oh. Then he says the beans and meat are very good and well seasoned. Hurray I didn't disappoint the pops. Ate everything but the grilled green onion (I stole that). Didn't care for the rice and chips much, but as he says, those are fillers and he thought the chip salsa was good but a tad too much salt. Overall - he was impressed and said he would return if/when they come back out. After 2 hours ago of Abuela's dining and chatting about stuff & life, it turned out to be a real pleasant afternoon.
