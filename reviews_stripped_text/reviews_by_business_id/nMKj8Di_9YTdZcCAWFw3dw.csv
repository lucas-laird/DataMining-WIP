The atmosphere is great too, the restaurant is separated from the bar along with a cigar lounge and private banquet room you can rent for parties. We will be having my husband's birthday party here. 

Glad to have this place back!",_NjmJcj2B9DX8hybhaAxGw,2,1,5,Mj4GKCX7CxER-2e5pRMWeQ

Our bride asked if we could do separate orders as we had to pay separate. I mean who carries cash on them anymore. So half way through the order we realized we added something extra. We tried figuring out what we needed to fix. The guy on the phone literally said ""oh my god"" in irritation over the phone and then put our bride on hold and then was given to Rebecca who was even more rude. She took the rest of the order. When we went to pick it up even more rudeness happened. She messed up the order and I requested an additional ceaser salad that they did not give us dressing for. We paid in cash for one order and we had to ask for our change. We did not tip due to her rudeness. We were shocked at how rude Rebecca was.

The bar area has HD flat screens over the bar and a very friendly and attentive wait and bar staff. One thing that mad me laugh was that they also have free wi-fi.

It is a local's bar recommended by a dealer at one of the casinos. It was nice because we didn't have to get up early and have to save seats to watch football. The patrons were all friendly and even the local pd ate next to us. 

Service 
5/5
 Awesome service by everyone that helped us. The bartender even asked if there was a certain game we wanted to watch and put it on for us. The wait staff was very attentive and always made sure we had drinks.

Food
4/5
I ordered the steak and eggs which came with hashbrowns and toast. My other friends order
crossiant breakfast sandwhich while the others ordered just eggs and bacon. The hashbrowns were outstanding. I think they had a light mix of cheese in them! We all enjoyed our food and it was cheap.

Decor
3/5
Big full bar area. About 3 big flat screens on each side of the bar. Smaller tables on one side of the bar. The cigar room had a ton of flat screens. Then there was a sitdown restaurant area which I did not visit.

Parking

I never been in here before but heard through the grapevine Skinny Dugan been around for long long time. They just recently went through some major renovations. So have no idea what the place looked like before. I can tell you the place looks lot nicer then you think from looking on the outside and the area it located in. Inside not really much talk about find it like lot of other small bars around town. Mostly filled with poker/multi game machines BUT there is one thing that stood out there little cigar room. It nice small size room with multiple wide screens, little bit selection of cigars can buy, and think nice little room get together small group. The birthday party about that size 15-20 people. 

The service was great! The waiter that was taking care of the room friendly and great job of keeping up with bunch of drinkers. They serve food and have enclosed separate area just for dining. I only tried the chicken nachos. Honestly. It was not very good at all. It was about as bland as you can imagine. The cheese was nothing special, not lot of chicken on top, and something not order again. Other friends in the group order food they enjoyed it.

A cigar smoking buddy and I were out late and were trying to find a place where we could smoke and have a drink and maybe a bite. I mentioned Skinny's and said ""no, it's a dive!""

Don't be fooled by the sometimes bare parking lot, its a really great place for drinks, food and watching games. I was never a fan of bar food until I started eating/drinking at skinnys.
