38623,2011-11-01,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"Went to this place for dinner and decor and ambiance was really cool - a little dark in there but I liked it.

When ordering the drink, after ordering a bottle of wine the waiter walked off - we thought he was checking the wine availability but he never came back.  So I called him over and finished ordering drinks - weird!!!!  He probably assumed that all we wanted was a bottle of wine - but he really should not have assumed and asked if there was anything else we wanted.

We were given some fresh nan bread with dips, complementary - which was moist, hot and buttery - prob the best nan I've had.

I ordered grilled prawns and my husband ordered the seabass - both were lovely.  Hot, moist, delicate flavours and melted in your mouth.  Had to order sides as extra.  Got the spaghetti squash and crushed potatoes with garlic and rosemary - which was basically mash - but both were so so yum!  I couldn't stop eating.  Food was good  on the whole.

Have rated it down because of the terrible service and the over pricing.

Waiter poured a very small amount of wine into my glass and then hid the rest of the wine bottle somewhere.  They took so long in filling up my glass each time that by the time we had finished our meal, there was still half a bottle left.  By then we were tired and wanted to go back to our hotel we just left it.  Found it all a bit annoying.",ZBgo4gWOBPAdv_StoI6voQ,0,0,3,sLl6fLCB2wfhhtNa-yfKrw

I had the scallops, which were some of the best I've had in ages.  Being from Maryland,  I wasn't sure seafood in the desert would be able to compare to what I'm used to, but these were fresher than some I've had at home.  Dessert was a bananas foster creme brulee, it was a little weird because the bananas were cold and the creme brulee was warm, I wasn't crazy about that, but it was still good.",ltZwh9ETs-WRuFWvomNgKQ,0,0,4,9Fd1olV6qQhRckIlw34PiA

My starter, marrow bones, was my favorite part of the meal and it was delicious.  Unfortunately, I wanted a spoon (maybe even one of those tiny marrow bone spoons?) to scoop the marrow out to spread on the bread, but our waiter was busy elsewhere.  I finally stopped a different server, asked for a spoon, and received another knife and fork.  Sigh.  Now, it's two weeks later, and I don't even recall what we ate - just that no-one was delighted.

I started out really excited about Seablue after reading through the menu, but regrettably the meal started on a high note but continually lost steam as it progressed. 

I was impressed with their happy hour menu, $3 drafts, $5 sangria, $1 fried oysters, And $2 raw oysters.  For those of you who follow me, you know I loves me some oysters, so I ordered a half-dozen.  The oysters had a great taste though I was not overly impressed with the shucking (I ended up chewing on a lot of shell). 

This is when everything went downhill.  We ordered the fritters, I would not recommend them.  They had NO flavor, I added horseradish and tabasco to no avail.  Next we had the lobster pop tart (puff pastry), the lobster was not of quality and it was super salty ( btw, I used to eat driveway salt as a child, so when I say it's too salty, it's a major problem).

The clam chowder fondu was actually impressive and I liked the novelty of the fondue.  This was the only thing I ordered, besides the oysters, that I liked.  I also had the truffle Mac N Cheese, which tasted like I was drinking truffle oil and the scalloped potatoes, which were not passable.  

My husband had the surf and turf, though the lobster was sub-par we both enjoyed the filet.  
 
Overall, the idea of the food makes my mouth water.  Mac N Cheese with some truffle oil?  Yes!  Lobster with puff pastry?  Yes!  But the restaurant just didn't deliver and I sat there scratching my head at the rave reviews I read.  With all the amazing restaurants back home my hubby and I frequent I was so disappointed that we spend $160 on food that I barely ate.

286722,2011-10-11,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"Had the best meal of my Vegas trip here and that's saying something since we also went to CraftSteak, Mesa, and Max Brenner. We didn't have reservations and so were put in the back table right next to the kitchen. My husband wanted to ask for another table but I was happy having a view of the kitchen. It was actually really cool to watch them work, kind of like a show with our dinner. Our waitress was fantastic! I don't remember her name but she was blond and so sweet. She made a drink suggestion that we tried and didn't like and she brought us a new drink without us even having to ask. 

We ordered the oysters and weren't expecting much since we're from the NW and were now out in the middle of the desert but they were pleasantly fresh. The horseradish had the perfect amount of heat. (We had some later in the week that was like eating fire) The bread with the dipping sauce was great. I could have eaten a soup bowl of the red pepper dip. I wish I had the recipe. The best thing was by far what I ordered which was the shrimp scampi. The noodles and shrimp were made separately and then prepared table side while the waiter explained the ingredients. The addition of red chili flakes really made the dish. 

The service was great (best waitress we had in Vegas) and my meal was the best food I've eaten all year so the four stars were for the mashed potatoes that my husband ordered with his steak. They weren't awful, just not great.

Between the hours of 5:30-7:30 (I think), they have a little happy hour menu that you can get if you're sitting at the bar or at one of the tables that are in front of the restaurant.

The happy hour consisted of oysters and shrimp for $2 for 2.  I got a half-dozen shrimp and my husband had the oysters.  The shrimp were huge and delicious.  I don't like oysters, so I can't vouch for them, but my husband seemed pleased.  We also tried some sort of avocado salad (for her) and chicken skewers (for him).  I wasn't that impressed with the salad, but that's just me being a picky salad eater.

Happy hour also had some decent drink specials.  They had $3 Stellas or Newcastles, $5 sangrias and featured wines and $5 well drinks.  Can't beat that in Vegas, right?

For our meal, shared among three people, we also had:
Beef tartare - I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this. Beef tartare can be kind of one note, but this had a citrusy taste which I really liked, and a chunkier texture than other beef tartares I have had.

Duck fat fries - Crispy and delicious.  A very generous portion.

16 oz bone-in ribeye - This was huge. The ribeye was juicy, perfectly cooked, and served in thick slices to make it appropriate for sharing.

Grilled jumbo prawns - Yum. The char on the shell was great, and the meat was flavorful and not dry.

Macaroni and cheese - Very rich and creamy, definitely meant for sharing.

The house bread was also special enough to be notable.  It's a garlic naan, crisp and buttery but not overly garlicy.

What can I say.  This place has fantastic seafood.  From the moment you walk in you know you are in for a treat.  The restaurant is very elegantly decorated and they add a little spicy touch with some LCD TVs lying around the bar in case you don't want to miss the game.  The layout is very nice as well.  Plenty of tables and booths for you and your friends to enjoy the delicious menu.

All the seafood is great here and I'm sure the other reviews can attest to that, so I'll just write a little bit about the sangria.  It's fabulous.  One of the best I've had and it even comes in pitcher size which is nice for this nice of a restaurant.  It's a large pitcher too so don't be fooled.  I like to share this with ONE friend and we both get a pretty nice buzzy sensation from this wonderful libation.  It's smooth, it's fruity, but not too smooth and fruity.

First off, the service we expereienced was excellent.  We were seated at a table that was next to a busy thoroughfare and the waiter who came up to us picked up on our grimaces and asked us if we would like to sit somewhere else; we selected a booth off to the side.  

We started off with the soup sampler and the ceviche.  Both arrived wonderfully presented, the ceviche in a star shaped bowl on top of a bed of ice.  The soup sampler came in cute little cups with cute little spoons.  The only way this appetizer could've been any cuter is if Smurfs marched it out to your table.  We thoroughly enjoyed both appetizers.  For entrees, my date selected the DIY salad and I went with the grilled salmon.  The entrees arrived simultaneously, at which time they also brought us some bread (slightly grilled pita, almost like naan) with various toppings including olive oil, a curry-like paste and crumbled cheese.  Both the salad and my salmon were great (although I wouldn't recommend the salad as an entree if you are really hungry).  We skipped dessert.

Throughout the dinner the waitstaff was extremely attentive, filling our water and wine glasses and checking in from time-to-time.  I'm one of those people who feels embarrassed if someone waits on me *too* much, but I felt like this was a good balance between excellent service and being OCD.  The restaurant itself is a nice setting; it's dimly lit without being dark.  The music is noticeable but not overwhelming so you can still hear your company across the table.  They have those cascading waterfall walls that only look good in restaurants.  

My only gripe is that I feel the restaurant is overpriced, especially the wine (hence the 4 stars).

The service was right on. Freddy our waiter knows the dishes on the menu intimately and gave us great recommendations. The evening started with Mina's scrumptious complimentary nan bread with spreads. It was a challenge to control ourselves and not devour the entire basket. The feta cheese with olive tampinade is my favorite spread.

We had the Louisiana prawns (gigantic) stuffed high with Alaskan king crab for our appetizer...WOW! It was tasty (with those two components how could it be anything but?) and cooked perfectly. The tomato and bacon chopped salad was next. This was good but a little too heavy on the dressing for me.

Freddy's  team then prepared a platter of sliced strip steak, pork, lobster, crab  served grilled asparagus, potatos and a beautiful corn with peppers. A whole lot of delicious food for four people but the we did well.

Let me start out by saying:  I love seafood.  I actually tried to make reservations at Joe's Stone Crab (which I adore), but unfortunately, Joe's couldn't accommodate me for the time I requested.  We ended up here instead.

The appetizers: great.  We had oysters, clams, and the lobster poptart.  I also had the happy hour sangria, and my husband had a couple bombay sapphires.  So far, so good.

We then get to the actual entrees.  I ordered the scallops (around $34), and my husband ordered the sea bass.  The scallops were so disappointing!  Four rubbery, overcooked scallops on a lonely plate.  Terrible.  I ate two, and thus threw $34 down the drain.  My husband's sea bass was raw.  He attempted to eat it, but eventually gave up.  The server offered to get him something else, and he asked the kitchen to prepare whatever fish it wanted.  A burned salmon came out.  My husband's a chef, and he took it as a big ""F. U."" for sending back the raw sea bass.  Nice, Seablue.  Great service there.  

The sides we had: mac and cheese (not cheesy) and another side, which was so memorable I've now forgotten what it was.

$200 later . . . .

It started out okay with the introduction and appetizers. Then it went downhill. Skirt steak not cooked how I asked. Both my sides were horrible (the marrow was highly recommended) and everything had a really bad aftertaste. I love unique flavors but nothing I ordered was up to par. My wife had a decent dish but that was not me. Maybe she will give Seablue 2 stars? She was not happy either.

Service was not great at all. They filled our drinks 2 times and never came back. I asked our waitress for our bill while she was walking right by me and I totally got ignored. At the very end (after sitting around for about 10 minutes) the manager came and cleaned up because he saw us sitting unhappy. He didn't ask us how we were doing and just cleaned up everything with an awkward silence.

Couldn't have asked for a nicer meal. Our server joked around with us and let us substitute sides for our entrees, it was great!  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I quite liked my meal so much so that I decided on a repeat visit for a family Christmas Eve dinner.

For this meal I was keen to try a tangine (my love of tangines started back in the day from a meal at Little Door in LA). I immediately honed in on the Seablue Paella tangine or the special lamb shank tangine. I chose the lamb after our server described it to me (brussel sprouts, apricots, cous cous, cue the drool). The lamb fell off the bone, and the brussel sprouts were a nice touch. I only have two nit picky things that I wish the dish could of had more of: more stew/liquid and more apricots to add a light citrus flavor. It was still nice nonetheless.

My parents split the lobster bisque, house salad and an 8oz Flat Iron Steak. I personally think 8 oz is quite a huge serving esp since it includes mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms as sides. I was going to ask if they would allow my parents to substitute some sides, but our server didn't offer that up like the one from my previous visit so I didn't feel like pushing my luck this time around. Plus made me wonder if it was just a fluke last time around. :)  I was though impressed that the staff was thoughtful enough to ask and then bring out my parents' meal split in their separate plates! Bonus points on service!

My cousins had the tasting of yellowtail crudo, scallop ceviche and tuna tartare followed by the Seablue Paella tangine. The tangine looked tasty and was filled with shrimp and mussels, chorizo, quail and rabbit. Gonna have to get that next time around.

Thanks to Philip, i tried their ""buy 1 get 1 free "" promo for locals. the key is, this applies only to the entree and not the rest of the meal ( drinks, apps, dessert, etc ) 

when i saw this promo it reminded me of The Soprano's episode when Artie had to advertise the ""two-fers"" to bring in new biz. 

IT was a buddies b-day so i treated for dinner. probably not the smartest thing since he's a big martini drinker - he powered down 3 before the meal - he is a good friend but i'm here for the two-fer, i'm a frugal bastard ! 

he had the rib-eye, i went with the bacon -wrapped chilean sea bass tagine. 
we started with the make-your-own salad - i still love that option - a laundry list of ingredients, you pick up to 10 - the key for me, the shaved slices of the Reggiano and the citrus cashews - love both; the  salad/greens - who cares about the salad ! 
also did the fried app trio - i still don't like the lobster corndogs -  at least the mustard has changed - it's not the overpowering grain mustard but more of an aioli with grain mustard, but the lobster is still overwhelmed by the sauce and the corn coating. 

The bass - great, loved that the bacon blended well with the included beans and greens sitting below the bass. The steak - properly cooked, had a nice chimichurri styled sauce on top - tasty. 

I was pleasantly surprised by Sea Blue - my last few visits were a little shaky - not sure if they have a new chef, new attitude, all i know is they've improved. 

i think the locals are better off getting the winter tasting menu instead of the two-fer but that's only if they like the offerings in the winter menu.

We were seated right away and told the waitress we had a show to catch, and she gave us great service.

Since we didnt have much time we skipped appetizers and went straight to wine and main course.  Before our orders came out they served the Nahn with the dipping sauces which were amazing.  What a random twist for bread at a seafood restaurant.

The waitress made some recommendations and I ordered the Shrimp Scampi fettucini and my wife got the woodfire grilled sea bass with a side of mushrooms.

The waiter came with a plate of fetuccini and a sizzling skillet of shrimp. He puts the shrimp on top of the fettucini and asks how much of the sauce I would like on top, he poured exactly the amount I requested and it was incredible.  I had to have my wife take a bite to confirm that it really was that good, she agreed.

She got the seabass with skin on it, after the first bite she realized she didnt want the skin, the waitress offered to take the skin off for her she said ok.  The waitress came back saying the skin wasn't coming off easily because it cooked onto it so they are making her a whole new fish.  The new fish was out in 3 minutes and was cooked perfectly with just enough of the woodfire taste to compliment the fish.

Our main course was a tagine of almond and panko crusted cod with artichoke and couscous in a lemon broth, and was truly sublime.  Along with our entree we ordered the yellowtail sashimi with ponzu and the tuna tartare appetizers, which were done competently enough, but tasted so similar to dishes we have had elsewhere that we were unimpressed.  We started with a make-your-own salad by choosing from dozens of potential ingredients on a checklist.  Ours came out looking and tasting good enough, but again we were a bit underwhelmed.  A fun idea, though, and definitely different for a high-end restaurant. 

The restaurant was beautiful, but we happened to be sitting in an area near the entrance and I had a partial view of the MGM Mall, which definitely detracted from the ambiance.

The decor needs some work though it reminds me of a slightly upgraded chain restaurant (not on the Michael Mina par). However, the food is decent. Everything is executed out to the point where you can't complain. Started off with oysters from Vancouver, BC (some of the best ), glass of wine, had the ahi tuna tartare with pine nuts and pomegranate (it needed a little something extra, I like it when it is marinated with jalapeno and lime juice with cilantro). 
For the entree has the John Dory fish and Scallops. 

It came on a bed of jasmine rice, asparagus, and light vinaigrette dressing. I'm glad they didn't drench the food with sauce like some places do. The John dory fish (first for me) tasted like a cross between halibut and scrod. It's a light white fish, firmer than a sole or tilapia. The scallops were a bit too salty for me..

Scallops and AhI as entrees - we split them with each other.  Thought the scallops were great and seasoned really well.  Ahi was a great cut of tuna but was under seasoned.  A little bit of seasoning would have made this a great meal!

We started off with an assortment of appetizers; lobster corn dogs, corn fritters, oyster sliders, tuna tartar.  The deceptively ordinary-looking corn dogs were delicious and the accompanying sauce worked well.  The fritters were sort of meh for me, especially after the corn dogs, i should have had the fritter first then follow with the corn dog.  That way, the fritter wouldn't have tasted like it was missing something.  The sliders, though the waitress said they were 'OK', were quite good, the watercress added a nice kick to go with the remoulade and fried oyster.  Eat the tartar without the pita!  The pita that came with the tartar must be for the raw-fish-fearing.  So if you like your sashimi, skip the pita or you'll find that it takes away from your bite of tuna like I did.

Most of my group ordered some sort of sea bass so I went for the rib eye with 3 oysters on the side and a glass of a Spanish red.  Plating of the dishes were haute-looking, with different color elements such as grapefruit, chick peas, and asparagus so it all looked wonderful.  

Beyond looks, there were mixed reviews around the table.  My rib eye was less than ideal, with some parts being quite sinewy, some OK, I doubt I'd order that again.  Three of us had the bacon-wrapped sea bass though two of them liked the dish, one thought it was dry.  The paella had lots of seafood, from what I saw but the main complaint was there wasn't much rice.

Halfway through my entree, I was so stuffed that I couldn't even finish it. Nevertheless, it was wonderful. 

It was probably due to the yummy Naan bread + array of hummus that they serve fresh every 10 minutes and ALLLLL of the yummy appetizers. 

Really, it was a wonderful dining experience. The executive chef was mingling amongst the patrons and that's 5 stars off the back. 

Nice ambiance, located in the MGM Studio Walk. Food, incredibly good. Service, fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant!",BLqRthBLY22d5WWBkl6drw,1,1,5,ux4zNk52QGpU6GCEYx6eeg
1442143,2012-01-20,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"Damn! Finally an excellent place to get dinner in the MGM without breaking the bank (too much)!  Seablue is freaking awesome! The food is great, their customer service was even better and the overall experience here is going compell me to come back again..

We placed our New Years Eve reservations using MGM's website which made this place very accessible and after getting seated, we took a quick look around to find the decor to be pretty cool. I think its perfect for the special occassion or even just to get dinner to satisfy your inner foodie cravings.

After getting situated, they took our drink order and send over some naan with different ""toppings"" like hummus and etc. I liked this a lot. A little too much as I tried to force myself from eating it all so I can sample the other stuff on their menu.

For good while now, we havent been quite interested in getting your typically meal complete with a main course. Recently, we have been in the mood of getting several small dishes or appetizers instead.

We placed our order and ended getting:
* Oysters - yes I know.... Shellfish in the desert? How many times have broken this rule? This is the very reason why I do. The oysters were freaking awesome.
* Maitake Mushroom Tempura - neither for us really cared for this despite loving maitake mushrooms. It was kinda heavy and not, kinda odd and not, and we were just indifferent about it. I can see though how some might like this while others (us included) do not.
* Scallop Fritters with Lime Creme Fraiche - pretty dang good
* Crab Stuffed Prawns with Hot/sour Viniagrette - yummy!
* Truffle Mac and Cheese - heavy but crazy good. Should you get this, ask for it to be brought out at the end. I always do this with these high-end Mac and Cheeses.

So we didn't end up caring for the Tempura Maitake Mushrooms and we only ended up eating one each despite getting like at least 10 or so mushrooms in the dish. They noticed it and offered to remove it from the bill taking into consideration we ate everything else.... Keep in mind this is without us saying anything at all. Usually I would have just paid for it, wrote and maybe complained about it on yelp, but I think this just goes to show how customer service oriented they are. I think that more than anything defines this place... Ok... That and the food is excellent! I would give this place 6 stars if I could, but alas the highest rating is 5 and that is exactly what they will get. The highest rating posssible. 5 stars!",cTf5rrUd253mkJtUW0DYKQ,3,2,5,iX_edVZW2Xr5WcwTnDBjmQ

My boyfriend had the crab soup, it was good, but I preferred the salad. The flatbread was great, and the dips that came with it were awesome.

We both had the bacon wrapped Sea Bass and it was great! The wait staff was very attentive (the sommelier never let out glasses get close to empty and had good suggestions on what  wine to pair with dinner) and helpful, all offered suggestions when asked and were quiet and polite when we were talking.

We told our waiter that this was our best dinner in Vegas and the chef showed up shortly thereafter to let us know he had received the compliment and encourage us to visit again the next time we were in town.

From the hostess who took us to our table to the enthuiiastic busboy and the witty and knowledgeable server we had a great time.  

Dinner was amazing!  We started with the tandoori octopus (recommended so highly by the bartender, it would have been a crime not to order it) which totally blew me away.  We also had the lobster corndogs and the yellow tail hamachi.  Both were superb.

Next we created our own salads and had a view of the kitchen to watch the chef make them.  This is such a cool option, I really dig the interactive part of creating my meal.

For entree I had the lamb shank tagine.  It came out in this sexy blue pot that attracted attention from all over the dining room.  When I took the first bite, I found it heavenly.  This dish was so stellar I thought twice about sharing even a morsel with my dining companions.  My friends had the kobe flatiron steak and the loup de mer.  The flatiron was 10 times better than the steak we had the previous night and the loup de mer was the best fish I have ever tasted.

Now for dessert.  Let me start by saying that I live for cake or any dessert.  The creme brulee trio was lucious and the chocolate molten cake was stellar.  We were completely blown away by these desserts.  I definitely recommend both!

The wine selection at SEABLUE is amazing too!  Our server was great with suggestions and even the sommelier stopped by our table to discuss some of the wines were debating on.  He gave some great tips and really worked with our price point (the night before we were treated like paupers at another restaurant because we ordered a $60 bottle of wine).  He even opened the wine for us and made some great menu suggestions.  I really respected them for not judging us for ordering a less expensive bottle ($70).  We ended up drink two and really enjoyed them.

As soon as we walked in the restaurant, we were tiny bit disappointed as the decor is way below expectation. No more water falls, video screen showing sports at the bar and nothing exciting to look at. We were seated by a brick wall, and no ""pardon our dust sign"". Time to renovate Mister Mina.
No let's talk about the important part:
Beverage: We started with a Perrier Jouet Glass as it was one of our BD. One glass was the end of a bottle and had no bubble, so we asked to change it which they have done very easily though. Second round of drinks was a Pouilly Fume and was excellent.
Food: We tried about every appetizers on the menu. Lobster Bisque, to die for; Hibachi great, Clams nice, Beef Tartar AMAZING, Veal Carpaccio STAY AWAY, Scallops fritters interesting, the complementary mise en bouche were amazing. Fries were obviously out of packaging but cooked or covered with duck fat and came with a perfect dip. 
Did not order dessert as we were full this time
Service: Our waiter was very nice BUT should have mentioned that we were ordering too much, which they usually do. Because he noticed that we did not like the veal nor the fries, he nicely removed it from our invoice which was a nice gesture.

My advice: DON'T GO before they renovate the place which they are schedule to do very soon. Instead, and to stay in the Mina family, try American Fish or Michael Mina",78C6Unw6FsFN0HGIGEcv7w,0,0,3,1tfv6YCkVXDVCFNe46qryg

The appetizers seemed promising, but were not well executed.  The stuffed shrimp with crab was undercooked (shrimp were almost raw) and very small portion.

We both opted for the winter tasting menu dinner, along with sommelier paired wines.  This included their standard ""build your own salad"".  Designing a salad with ten ingredients was a lot of fun and my wife and I picked some of our favorite items, as well as some new ones. The salads were both very good, and just the right size.

Our appetizer platter consisted of a couple of different types of bread along with a roasted red pepper hummus and a traditional hummus, some tobiki type sauce, almonds and a selection of olives.  There were generous poritons of everything and we did not eat all of it.  The next course was some skewers. There was lamb, beef and chicken, along with some seasonings to sprinkle on each.  They were all done very well and were extremely tasty.  The next course was a paella. This was different from any that either of us had ever had. It consited of not only some delicious seafood such as scallops, fish, clams, mussels, and callamari,  but also quail and rabbit along with some delicious chorizo.  It was DELICIOUS with a capital ""D""!

The chosen wine pairings for each course were very well done and went nicely with the food.

Desert was a warm lemon cake served with some nice berries and a very nice lemon sorbet.  It was the perfect way to end a very good meal.  We will add this restaurant to our long list of favorites at the MGM.",WIqWc9etTkup66Fz4eT_ew,0,0,5,Z5pDvWUMi7ELgtIgOkV6eA

I know Vegas is known for their buffets but the amount of food they give you in their tasting menu is just crazy! My mom, brother and I came no where near finishing all of the food they gave us here!

The tasting menu is around $65 per person but in Vegas that is a steal for a multicourse menu. You start with a salad that you create yourself with up to 10 toppings and that alone is a hard choice. Then they brought us some breads and different types of olives and dips like roasted pepper sauces and such and then a series of different types of kabobs. The lamb kabobs are a must here, and they even pack a hint of spice in them which I always like. My brother was a big fan of the kabobs too! And then if you aren't full yet, they bring you a seafood paella dish that is big enough to feed four people yet alone three people after already eating a ton! The paella was pretty tasty too. Various types of shellfish but the chorizo was my favorite part in that dish. I kept eating more but I needed to be able to still fit into the dress I was wearing for the club that night, so I stopped...eventually. 

And did I mention we got wine pairings too? Yup. You live it up in Vegas! But word to the wise. If you are trying to make a show at the MGM like we were, I would either eat here way earlier than you think you need to or eat somewhere else since service is a little slow and the tasting menu just takes a while.

We showed up at about 10:02pm after a three hour long cocktail reception (Who was two martinis and two glasses of red wine deep?  Not me!...oh, um, except actually me.) and despite the fact that they technically closed at 10 they were happy to seat us, bringing over a basket of soft delicious pita and hummus, baba ghannouj, and feta spread for dipping almost immediately.  I housed the bread - because if there's one thing I'm good at, it's pushing through and eating copious amounts of food while not even hungry - as we perused the menu.

My coworkers were seduced by the create-your-own-salad concept, but I'm one who doesn't like to be given too much wiggle room in a fine dining experience.  You're the celebrity chef, you tell me what's going in my appetizer.  As such, I went with the tandoori octopus, and it was as exotically delicious as I could have asked for.  For my entree, I went with the paella tagine, hoping that the spawn of two of my favorite types of dishes would be just as tasty as both of its parents.  It was, although it was not exactly what I was expecting.  It was very light on the rice and very soupy, and so far as I could tell the only thing it had in common with a tagine was that it was served in one.  It was more like a bouillabaisse got knocked up by a paella, in my estimation.  Nonetheless, it was really, really good.  One more martini and I might have licked the tagine.

We didn't have room for dessert, not surprisingly - hell, I didn't really have room for dinner - so I can't speak to that, but I'd be willing to extrapolate that it would be good.  Only caveat is it's really, really expensive.  I'm happy to pay a lot for a good meal, particularly when it's a total dining experience, but had I been paying and not the company, I'm not sure I'd have thought it was worth it.",geeRP-gkEQmiYRp5vMJ-zQ,0,0,4,XQZ6fvrrs086YRN1F-A43w

Last year the Lady friend and I took a stab at the Chilean Sea Bass wrapped in bacon... this year we just had to do the same. IT WAS THAT GOOD! Perfectly cooked, the fish flaked away ever so delicately. The bacon, well, seemed at least this year to be more infused around the sea bass rather than, well, just around it. Loved it! The fish on top of a bed of white beans and clams is the perfect compliment to this dish. The clams... I don't even really care for clams. Sea Blue's clams have a slight seasoning that make them... shall we say... IRRESISTIBLE!

We also decided to add the Alaskan crab legs to our sea bass (I added wanted to do the Lobster, the better half wanted the crab legs). Let me say this: I loooooooove crab legs. Get it as much as humanely possible. When I'm up in SF, it's crab legs while standing on the wharf and a frosty Heineken. When I go out for seafood, it's crab legs. Sea Blue's crab legs...? The ish. They are slighty steamed and come out nice and hot, none of this cold BS. Now, the butter sauce they prepare... WOW. Absolutely perfect. Though the crab could stand without any sauce as long as you eat them asap, the sauce is TO DIE FOR!

It doesn't always blow me away when I eat some seafood that everyone else seems to be enjoying. I'm a steak and potatoes guy, if I need anything more than a spoon, knife and fork to eat my food, it loses its charm. Despite this, I usually order fish or seafood plates when I go to a nicer restaurant, hopefully to train my palate or something, and because I don't eat it quite often enough.

We went to this restaurant when I was already slightly buzzed, so I didn't give a crap what we ate, as long as it wasn't fast food and as long as it looked like it was good and it was NOW!!!!

Started off with a couple of drinks while we were waiting for our table. The greeter was very courteous and arranged for bar seating while we waited, and sought us out when our table was ready.

For appetizers we arranged the manila clams, scallop ceviche and something else I couldn't remember. Now I've never tasted crack before, but I swore they laced the bread with it. The bread was a little oily but man oh man was it good even by itself. Even better when dipped in the manila clam juice! I was addicted, but it was time to move on to the main course.

The naan bread was delicious too, though it wasn't quite crack. There were three different dips, hummus, feta cheese and something else - all of them were really good.

I ordered Loup De Mer (Spanish Sea Bass) at the recommendation of our waiter who was really pleasant. When the plates came out, I started eating..... and eating. And eating.... I just did not stop. The bass was just so delicious, every bite full of flavor, seasoned just right, with that slightly fatty taste when mixed in with the juices. Wasn't dry or oversaturated, it was just right. It's something to be expected with a restaurant of this caliber I suppose, but there were no bones at all, and that's always a plus for someone like me who doesn't like to struggle with their food to actually get to the food.

Even before our meal, I told our neighbors that their plate looked delicious, and they affirmed my suspicions. It was the ribeye, if you're curious. I also tried a bit of the scallops (part of the paella?) and the chicken, both tasted great also.

It was expensive, but well worth it. We ended up charging it to our room. This is one of the very, very, very, very few times when I go out and dine and love every single aspect about the dining institution. The decor was interesting, the lighting was a bit dark, but far from gloomy. Service was great from everyone we came in contact with, and every. single. food. item. was. incredible.

Don't get me wrong, the food was good but I was expecting ""great"" because Mina's name is attached to this restaurant.  Overall, what I can say about this place is that it was ""nothing special.""  The only special thing about this restaurant was the starter pita breads that came with 3 dipping sauces.  I ordered the surf and turf and at $59 I was expecting something great.  What I got was a decent filet mignon with an OK side of lobster.  The waitress also didn't ask me if my steak was cooked correctly and had the right temperature which I assumed was just a standard question they ask at these high-end restaurants.  We ordered a side of truffled mac and cheese which was good but the caesar salad was again, nothing special.  Overall a good but boring meal.",HWye3JP0TVrW1QrvAMisOQ,0,0,3,tTRoLReKv1bNJo3-W8EoNg

The average time to get a drink from our waitress in a 50% empty restaurant was 15 mins.  She seemed bothered to get anything for a table of 10 when she gets a guaranteed 18% tip.  One of the people at the table asked for ranch dressing.  The waitress was flip and said ok never coming back to the table for 15 min.  But when the manager came over to pick up the waitress' slack she said they do not have it but would find some for her.  The manager went above and beyond for everyone at the table and deserved the tip.  Our waitress should have stayed home where I presume she would have been happier.

Naan side note:  They serve naan with a little hummus, a smear of feta spread and another dip.  When you have 10 people at a table with 2 servings of naan-- you would think we could get a refill.  It is $4 for a refill.

2230889,2008-01-06,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"Hubby and I wanted one really GOOD meal in Vegas when we were there.  We also wanted a place we could walk to and since we stayed at the Signature, we first looked at all the MGM restaurants.  I suggested CraftSteak.  Even though I have a crush on Tom Collechio, I don't think that justifies $120 per person for dinner.  We liked the varied menu at Seablue more so we made a reservation.

I have to say, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable.  I don't know if that's a Michael Mina thing or an MGM thing but it is duly noted.  The decor and ambiance of Seablue really impressed us as well.  We sat against a beautiful aqua wall that was a fountain and it was quite serene and relaxing.  The dining room also wasn't too loud, which was impressive.

So they start you off with ""bread.""  As noted in several reviews, this is delicious flatbread with three types of dips (hummus, egg plant, and feta spread).  Delicious...I didn't need an appetizer.  Also, they have a build your  own salad option, which I exercised (baby lettuce, beets, fresh bufala mozz, cherry tomatoes.  YUM!  Neither hubby or I are big fans of oysters so I can't tell you if they were good but they had many types to choose from.

We moved on to our own version of surf and turf.  I got the filet and hubby got the two pounds of king crab legs and we split them between the two of us...see?  We made our own surf and turf, isn't that great?  We're so smart.  

We both had two glass of wine as well and the bill was $170 so not too terrible but definitely a splurge.  I recommend Seablue for a lovely dining experience.  The food is very good, the service is amazing and it's away from the ding ding ding of the slot machines.",8M6suLprYcMngrJjhYl_lw,2,1,4,MtVdhWhnDH99J3ehmXv4gA
2256979,2008-01-22,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"Bread and butter?  Forget that stuff.  Instead, Seablue offers naan with baba gahnoush, hummus, and feta cheese... double cream feta, so it actually tastes like what would happen if butter and feta had a kid together.

For starters we had the build-your-own-salad, where you literally check off ingredients from the menu (at least 40 items to choose from) with a pencil, and the chef makes it accordingly.  We are still not sure if we got the English cucumber or not, and the chestnut tasted a bit... well... weird (sorry can't get any more technical than that).

We then shared the raw/marinated fish trio, which was an Asian/Middle Eastern fusion dish.  I liked the middle tuna fish best, as it was accompanied by marinated, sweet shitake mushroom slices.  There was also raw tuna disguised as a falafel, served with a slice of pita bread.  While it looked sort of like a porcupine and made me want to laugh, it tasted unique in a good way, especially with its crunchy falafel-y outer layer.

For the main course we decided to split the surf and turf.  The steak and lobster were both perfectly done, but not mindblowingly awesome.  In fact, the mashed potatoes with shitake mushrooms on the side stole the show...  for once I didn't even mind that mashed potatoes = fat + carbs.

By dessert time we were ready to cry for mercy, and nothing on the menu seemed gentle enough for our protesting bellies.  As a matter of fact the words ""chocolate cake"" on the dessert menu elicited my gag reflex.  Our waiter, who had been perfectly attentive the entire time, came to our rescue.  He asked us to trust him (why the heck not, we still haven't tipped the guy yet), and disappeared into the kitchen.  Ten minutes later he reappeared with something off the menu.  Three pieces of pear poached in 3 different ways, a glop of pear and whatever sorbetto, all served on a sugar cookie-thingy.  It was light and refreshing, the perfect ending to one of the best meals I have had in Vegas.",v6dzFJtSX8ud7H1u_SI4gQ,0,0,4,pIL7S0dMiR0ZDcmI_Dx18A

Even the naan they served in the beginning of the meal was delicious! I LOVE naan and I think all restaurants should serve naan with dipping sauces rather than plain white or sourdough bread.

Entrees were the ahi tuna (very rare) and the European sea bass. We ordered a side of foie gras too. Everything was so incredibly indulgent and the seafood was so fresh!  The foie gras was seared perfectly and melted in your mouth.

They have THE BEST yellowtail EVER!

I came here for my birthday recently because they had an employee birthday special thing going on. Made my reservation a week in advanced. When we arrived, they set up our table and sat us right away (me and my BF). They had a handwritten birthday card for me (aww!).

The restaurant is smaller than I imagined, but it was nice. The tables are set up to accommodate large parties and then they had some pretty small tables. Our table was definitely too small for us... oh well.

We started off ordering 2 different appetizers. The raw and marinated sampler. (3 items) and the bbq one (or something like that with the lamb skewers). And of the 6 items, the yellowtail was definitely the best! The other raw items were good as well, the lamb was a bit dry. And the other bbq items weren't great.

I LOVED the bread and different spreads for it. I thought it tasted and even smelled amazing... but my bf said it smelled like Crisco. But whatever, I liked it. There was like hummus and 2 other choices to go with the bread.

For the main course, I ordered paella. Which was the server's favorite and they said it was one of the most popular items. It had rabbit and quail and stuff in it. Also sausage, mussels, clams, and other stuff. I thought it was okay, not that great. Maybe I am just not a fan of paella. the BF ordered fish, which was cooked very well.

For dessert, the chocolate cake. Which was also decorated for my birthday. The little touches really make a difference to me. So even though the main course wasn't the best, I had a great time here. Everything else was great. And the service was good too.

The main reason I actually wanted to dine at SeaBlue was for their lobster corn dogs. Which we didn't end up getting... bummer. But that is 1/2 price for their happy hour (weekdays 5p-7p) along with $1 oysters and $1 shrimps. So I'll probably go back soon for HH and just hang out at the bar.

From my experience, I would give this place 3 stars. But the yellowtail bumps it to 4 stars :)",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,3,3,4,562A68zXqhcvWDyAerzDlQ

$1/ea oysters - salty and fresh, tasted like a gooey bite of ocean. Typically, I'm pretty hesitant about raw oysters on the half shell, but given Sea Blue's reputation with fresh seafood, felt like this was a worthwhile risk. I was rewarded justly.

$1/ea shrimp - I was definitely hesitant with this thinking that these would likely be more in the 26-30 count size. maybe 16-20, if we were lucky. Well, its VEGAS BABY! These were some big ole tiger prawn looking bad boys. They were tender and sweet. Worth every penny.

$5 calamari - This was a healthy sized portion, especially for happy hour. Good, but not exceptional. The fried slice of lime was surprising.

I'm sure we would've enjoyed the full meal as well, but without having tried the full gamut of offerings, its truly difficult to give it a 5-star rating.",1f7hREgQh0TGDN93HfHwrQ,0,0,4,BxgZYr1nEncebhlcoNiZjA

This place was pretty crowded on Friday evening, so service was a little slow and spotty, but still friendly.  Otherwise I liked the decor and elegant but relaxed darkened blue-toned ambiance. If you're staying at MGM Grand or nearby, its definitely worth checking out this Happy Hour out  for pre-dinner or pre-theatre drinking and noshing:

$7.50 Lobster Corn Dogs: Cute and Delicious...you just have try these! Nom nom nom!
$5 Calamari: Pretty good, but really good because of the price, especially in Vegas!
$3 Chicken Skewer: Nothing worth mentioning...
$1 Cocktail Shrimp, must order by half dozen: Best you'll ever have...SERIOUSLY! MMMmmm!
$1 Oysters, must order by half dozen: I don't like oysters, but everyone else in the room seemed to be enjoying them.  
$4 Draft Beers: Stella and Fat tire, and $15 Sangria Pitchers.

The music was quite loud, and the waiter had to repeat things as he could not be heard.  I thought that the very dim lighting was not characteristic of such a loud place, maybe I'm the only one who thinks that.

We were near the kitchen, and could see all the fun going-ons in there.  

We ordered a few appetizers - beef tartare, the duck-fat fries, and clams, all to share.  They also brought around the house bread (naan), this was fantastic, loved that.

Beef tartare was pretty bland, did not even come close to what I enjoyed at McKendricks Steakhouse in Atlanta, GA (for about the same $$) - seemed like almost no seasoning at all.  The duck-fat fries crunchy.  Clams, tasty in a white wine sauce.

I ordered the Halibut with an 'add-on' of lobster, and side dish of mushrooms (all sides are a la carte, $12).  As the appetizer plates were cleared away the waiter replaced our silverware with the correct setting for each meal ordered (neat!)

The halibut was perfectly cooked, still very moist inside, grilled, but nothing else to zing it up, maybe thats the intent.  The half-lobster tail was a bit of a workout, had to pry it away from the shell, and was about the size of an adult thumb :) My friend next to me had ordered the pork chop, and was practically launched out of his chair he  was so excited by the flavor, and insisted on sharing - and he was right AWESOME, wished I had ordered it.

Loved the mushrooms, and I also got to munch on some grilled asparagus (perfect, still had crunch) and spinach.

THE SHORT VERSION: 
5 stars for service, 5 stars for seafood, 5 stars for the decor, 4.5 stars for price, 4 stars for the upbeat modern music being played a little too loud at the bar.

If you are going for something other than fish...go to craftsteak down the hallway.
Go early for the $1 oysters and 1/2 price appetizers, but you have to sit in the bar area. After you finish cash out go back to the Host stand and get a dinner table for amazing service.

Don't let the hotel location and tourists fool you, this is excellent seafood. 

IN DETAIL:
I am very price sensitive when critiquing every restaurant. And i always compare them apples to apples, so my review of SeaBlue is based against other seafood restaurants in prime locations. It isn't being judged against water front fish house in key west. It is obviously supposed to be very expensive here due to it's location (Inside the MGM), it's notoriety (a Michael Mina restaurant), and the quality of the ingredients (flown in regularly). However, I am rounding up to 5 stars from 4.5. This is based on the 2 times I've eaten here. I still think there is some room on the menu to add some seafood options at a lower price point and have Chef Mina and Executive Chef Stephen Hopcraft create a couple of entrees in the $25 range and let us see what you can do with a lesser quality fish. (Of course the sea-bass is great...it's sea-bass, but what can you do with a cod, or a whitefish, or catfish.) 

Our meal was $73 after tax, before tip, without wine or appetizer. 
However, with that said, I feel our meal here was incredible when considering I am in the middle of the desert.
We both opted for a fish entree. I had the Loup de Mar, which is a Mediterranean Sea bass served over rice with a grapefruit garnish. My date had the Bacon wrapped Sea Bass served with butter beans and steamed clams in a white broth that I can't recall. Both were flaky and tender with a perfectly crisp outer skin. The loup de mar has a great oily taste which just melted together with the crisp skin, perfect use of salt, and a light squeeze of the grapefruit. 

Each entree was $34. Which is reasonable considering the above mentioned factors and the assorted bread basket which came pre-meal with a baked crispy pita bread accompanied by a dipping trio of hummus (garlic, red pepper, and guessing the green was a pesto). However, 70% of the time I have eaten at the fine dining strip restaurants I've received some sort of amuse bouche during the salad portion. I guess now I just somewhat expect it when the average entree tops the $30 mark.

Our server was amazing we are both in our 20's the table near us was a group of 6 in their 40's pairing wine with each course. In theory each guest should be treated the same...I disagree. He acclimated himself to each table. After introducing himself our server immediately started asking us questions. ""Are you attending a show this evening or will you be taking your time with dinner?"" ""Are you familiar with the terms you see on the menu, and if not what can I tell you about?"" After feeling us out he saw that we were laid back and only there for a simple but quality pre-show dinner. From that point on he attended to us as such. Friendly and personable but brief and to the point. I took his suggestion of the Loup de Mar which was the most inexpensive entree. I mentioned the oysters, but let him know that I was used to gulf oysters...rather than hard selling me he told me to return the next day if I wanted to try them because there was a happy hour from 5:30 to 7 every day with $1 oysters and other discounted appetizers. (This lead to my second visit.) At no time did we feel second class because we weren't on an expense account.

I went back the next day on his suggestion and got my dozen oysters, while my date had the lobster corndogs (good but gimicky and I would never order them except at 1/2 price happy hour). This is truly a gem of a find for locals who don't want to pay $14-$20 for an oysters I could get for $10/dozen elsewhere in the country.",2DECrukmumziXTBI20idTA,4,3,5,mRkYIjJ1snbIpkxSO-Ndyg

As far as Vegas celebrity chefs' restaurants go, your dollar does go far at Seablue. Among the three of us, we had soup tasting trio, fried and crusted appetizer trio, 3 entrees, bottled water (the best to date), glass of Dr. Loosen Mosel Riesling and 2 iced teas, the bill came up to about $200. 

I'm generally hard to please when it comes to service, but the staff at Seablue can be described as impeccable. They swooped in just in time to replace your drinks, and the sturdy way they gently placed your glasses and plates down is enough to make you feel like royalty. I know I'm being picky, but I did say I am VERY particular where service is concerned.

The complimentary pita and dips were heavenly. The slightly buttery pita is an appetizer in itself. Of the 3 dips, the feta with yogurt had us clamoring for more.

I highly recommend the tasting trios in the appetizers. The portions were not measley and made fantastic amuse-bouche to what's to come. I was expecting shot glasses of the soups. Instead, they arrived in full bowls. And each of us have our favorite. The overwhelming favorite had to be the white corn with grilled scallop and truffle. The roasted garlic and spinach with Maine lobster and cumin oil tasted really organic and healthy. I am about the only fan of it at the table.

I had the Tagine meal of Bacon-wrapped Chilean Sea Bass in Toasted Garlic Jus, Cannellini Beans, Manila Clams. OMG. What freshness. The best bit of surprise was in the toasted garlic. 3 teeny ones enough for each of us at the table. It simply melts in one's mouth. 

The sil had the Ahi Tuna rare. And what a great call that was. Bright pink in the middle, the tuna betrays the fresh catch the restaurant brags about. 

The husband has the Kurobuta Pork Chop, which was wonderfully seared. The olive-oil mashed potatoes and broccolini sides were done to perfection, too. 

We also had the best sparkling water ever, and the sweetest, smoothest Riesling.

I'd be remissed if I don't mention they did sweetened tea right at Seablue. Having lived in the South for a while, we never could find decent sweet tea outside the South. But Seablue brought out a tiny bottle of sugar syrup for us to sweeten our tea. THAT is the way to handle sweet tea. Not your sugar packets that never seem to dissolve.

We wish we had room for dessert. But the chef kindly gave us 3 samples of dessert to take with us - meringue, some nutty concoction, and a macaroon. THAT, my yelpers, is service at its prime.",l2xCVVInBHnHjj2YrL5vig,2,1,5,BMz6TCIBMtyCLIRvi7x5eA

My favorite would have to be the oysters. They were sweet, plump and so delicious. If it is in season, order raw oysters appetizers. 

Ordered the seafood platter and it was great. I was a little unhappy with the way they prepared the lobsters (almost like a fruit salad, had dressing on it). Took away from tasting the actual lobster. 

Sides: Truffle mac and cheese: sounds fancier than what it actually was. Thought the truffle taste was a little too overpowering, but right amount of cheese

2703762,2012-07-20,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"REVIEW FOR HAPPY HOUR:
Meh. Came here for the famous happy hour and $1 oysters at the bar and was disappointed to learn that they'd changed their happy hour menu more than a year ago (according to our server) and no longer offer the $1 oysters or $15 pitchers of Sangria. Annoyingly, as we were walking to the restaurant through MGM, the PA system came on reminding everyone to hit up SEABLUE for $1 oysters for Happy Hour. They really need to update that 'cause it's false advertising, jerks. They also no longer carry lobster corndogs.

Regardless, the new ""bar menu"" (they don't have a happy hour menu anymore) is available from 5:30-10pm or so, and they offer a $12 for 6 oysters deal and a few other items, so we ordered 12 oysters (only offer Fanny Bay--pretty good), stuffed clams (an order comes with 2) and chicken skewers (2 or 3 3"" skewers) which I believe were $5 per plate. We also ordered duck fat fries from the full menu since I'd seen them in so many yelp reviews. For $11, they were good but not amazing. The baconnaise the fries come with was awesome though.

We also got $5 glasses of Sangria which tasted more like water than wine or fruit. Disappointing.

Servicewise, was just okay. The server was sort of rude about the whole happy hour debacle, and then was kind of creepy and linger-y while we were eating.

I won't be back for ""happy hour"" at SEABLUE unless I'm staying at MGM and craving oysters like crazy.",f9q7jyNX7V-JfWpaPbW1rQ,0,0,2,yq1HEmR8XhhS1eH9deprzg

We went to the Seablue at the Borgata for our honeymoon and decided to try this location.  First of all the decor is different between the two.  This one is a bit more casual than the on in AC.  When we made reservations we told them it was for my birthday and that we had gone to the other one for honeymoon.  They assured us that they would take care of things.

When we arrived they sat us in the very front in the bar area.  There was a little card waiting for us on the table that said congrats on being married.  WTH??? I told our server (who was a great guy) that sitting in the bar area is not my idea of romantic dinner and its my birthday not honeymoon.  He apologized and sat us in the main dining area.  For the goof we got two glasses of champagne.

Our next server wasn't as friendly, but she was efficient.  My husband had the paella (which was pretty good) and I had a summer special.  I do love the make your own salad combination and OMG that warm nan bread and the three spreads - YUMMMMMMMM.   I should've gone for the root beer float but opted for the ice cream trio. 

If you go here, check outside to see if they are running any specials because they won't advertise it inside, they will advert another one (in this case a more expensive one) and be prepared to put out some bucks.

After learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, my friends and I decided to eat at Michael Mina's Seablue.  I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.

The four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The ""bread"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.

By the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue ""paella"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!

Our waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.

Damn it, Seablue...your food was so tasty, but your service blows chunks...

Were I to rate this place solely on the food, it would have been easily a 4-4.5-star experience. We walked in and were seated right away. We got our drinks pretty quickly, but that is where the goodness stopped. 

The server, I believe his name was [redacted] (don't know for sure since he never introduced himself), was kind of rude when my husband asked if they had any specials that night. Apparently they print their menus daily and all of the dishes are on there. Sorry, [redacted], that we don't know the mundane details of your place of employment.

Once we ordered, [redacted] said that he would be bringing out bread, but oddly, the bread came out after all of our appetizers had arrived. However, the flat bread and the three sauces they provide are really good.

We shared both a Caesar salad and the Poppers. The salad was pretty good, though nothing to write home about. The poppers consisted of rare hamachi and ahi on these crispy disks served with ponzu sauce. They were really tasty, but you only get 3 tiny portions of each for $22. We felt that they were a tad bit overpriced.

For my main course, I got the Prawns Scampi. They serve the prawns table-side so the whole thing looks really pretty. The flavors are spot-on, the prawns are cooked to perfection, and the fettucini was nice and al dente. In other words, there was not a bad bite on that plate.

My husband got the Lemon Chicken and ""Dumplings."" the flavors on this plate were also really nice. The only complaint was that the chicken was a little dry. Other than that, no real complaints about this dish either. 

Aside from getting us refills, our server left is alone. Not a problem, except when your alone time once your food is cleared quickly escalates to well over 20 minutes (we started a timer after the first 10 minutes). Servers saw that our table had been cleared, yet no one came to ask if we wanted dessert or the check. We wanted a dessert at one point, but that quickly changed. 

The tables around us were always well taken care of, which only added to our annoyance. A lady, one of the managers I believe, even asked the diners next to us if they are having a nice time. All the while we were sitting there with a clear table, no server in sight. She saw us this way several times with no acknowledgement. 

Finally, my husband flags her down and informs her that our server has not been by in a while. She tried to jokingly say that it was because, ""he didn't want us to leave."" No offer to comp a dessert, nothing at all. Not cool. A few minutes later, our server arrives with the check (turns out he had been chatting it up by the bar with other workers). 

We paid and we did what we have never done - we left no tip. We felt bad because the auxiliary staff did their jobs well, but our server effed up, and he knew it. They all knew it, yet they all did nothing to mitigate the situation.

It could have been a great dining experience, but wasn't. It's a shame really and completely unacceptable at any price-point, but especially at such an expensive eatery.",I_Ya_aIkNNtJ46XsmKEk-Q,4,0,2,HaShzmqGAfmLT9cOe5pugA

This was my first experience eating at one of Michael Mina's restaurants, so I have no frame of reference. Seablue was much more casual than I expected. The service was a bit negligent at times (or laid-back to put it nicely), but we were also watching the clock so we wouldn't be late for the 7:30 pm Zumanity show. 

I know that Michael is known for his trios, so I ordered the fried and crusted tasting trio to start off the meal. The gulf shrimp tempura with yuzu, plums, and shiso was alright. Nothing special. The shrimps were huge, but tempura is tempura. Nothing to write home about. The lobster corndogs with whole grain mustard were a unique idea, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The dungeness crab-stuffed piquillo peppers with house-smoked pepper aioli were the tastiest things on the plate. Overall, not bad. My tastebuds just expected to be wowed a bit more.

For the main course, I ordered the bacon-wrapped chilean sea bass, with toasted garlic jus, cannellini beans, and manila clams. The portion was hearty with a huge piece of sea bass and a lot of fresh clams. However, the smokiness of the bacon was a little too overpowering for the delicate flavor of the fish. 

My girlfriend ordered the winter tasting menu, which included yellowtail jack crudo with shiitake mushroom and ponzu, Seablue ""paella"" with shellfish, chorizo, grilled quail, and rabbit, and layered chocolate mousse cake with tres leches sauce and malted milk ice cream for dessert. The crudo was fresh, and the flavors were a bit light compared to other similar crudo I've had before. The ""paella"" was delicious and quite hearty. The dish had a lot of different layers to it with all the types of seafood and meats. The layered chocolate mousse cake was a perfect end to the meal. Not too sweet and not too chocolatey.

There is an abundance of restaurants to choose from at the MGM Grand, but overall, Seablue is not a bad option if you're craving fresh seafood. I hope you find this review useful, somewhat cool, but not funny. Sorry, I'm all out of funny for today.",51SjZEz911Af5t-EpNgk4g,5,6,4,xZZ9HrMqCqH4qo0dp-DVsg
3381764,2009-07-16,0,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"For being a seafood restaurant in the middle of the desert, Seablue didn't disappoint. Yes, it's Michael Mina, so yes, I expected good things, and I left satisfied, albeit not blown away. 

Oddly, my favorite part was the pita-naan hybrid bread, served warm and buttery and complimentary with a trio of dipping sauces--feta, roasted red pepper, and hummus. How can something so simple taste so divine?

I opted for the tagine, which is essentially a paella, and it was positively loaded with perfectly cooked shellfish. The lentil-rice mixture underneath didn't have the most innovative flavor--not much more than a broth--but I liked how light it tasted. My dining companion ordered the grilled scallops, which ended up being almost like my dish in miniature, as they were served over a very similar rice-lentil mixture. 

Dessert was a bit of a letdown. The molten chocolate cake was a bit too dry and a bit too bitter, and the little caramel ice cream cone was rock-hard and unpleasant on the teeth. 

Overall, the dining experience met my expectations--well-prepared fare, a helpful but not overly enthusiastic server, impressive decor.

My hubbie and I dined here on 2/8/11 only to find out after looking at the menu that the menu is completely different. So if you are looking to enjoy some of the items reviewed, you won't find them. I was pretty disappointed just because of that. We were told the menu changed on 1/31/11. You still get the Nann, which was really good. We ordered 2 appetizers: Crab Croquettes and Manila Clams. The croquettes were pretty good, 3 bite size pieces. The clams were applewood bacon infused which completely over-powered the clam flavor, it could have been any shellfish with all that bacon flavor. For our entrees: Lamb T-bones and Chilean Sea Bass. The theme for all meats and seafood dishes is grilled over an applewood open flame. No frills, grilled protein is what you get. My husband's lamb was really delicious and a generous portion. My bass was disappointing, it was just so basic. Salt, pepper, and olive oil, and a tomato paste shmear on the plate. If I didn't know, I wouldn't even be able to tell it was Chilean Sea Bass. The fillets were very petite and thin. It was good, but just very very basic. We also ordered two sides: Mashed Potatoes and Grilled Broccolini, again, very basic. The service was ok, nothing special, nothing horrible. We did have to ask for our beverages to be refilled which really shouldn't happen in an upscale eatery. No dessert for us, we were just too disappointed to spend another $15 on dessert. Our meal came to $140 with tip. No alcohol because I'm pregnant and my husband doesn't drink. Server said Mina changed the menu because he was re-inspired by a recent trip back to the Mediterranean.

3468434,2009-01-16,1,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"So it's Sunday night, after CES 2009, and everything on the strip looks pretty dead.  My friends Duke and Tamae just arrived from LA for another conference, and the friends still around from CES and I decide to all go together to find something to eat.  Since we hadn't gone towards MGM, Luxor, Mandalay Bay area on this trip, we decided to venture forth to the MGM Studio Walk to find a nice restaurant to dine at.  

We had our minds on Craft Steak, but when we got there at 9 pm, since it was so dead everywhere, they told us that they were just closing the kitchen.  Kudos to the manager over there who came out personally to explain to us the situation and to tell us that he was very sorry about it all, and gave us a few suggestions nearby to try instead.

After walking around a bit, we decided to give Sea Blue a try because of the Prix Fixe menu they had advertised outside.  It was also a Michael Mina restaurant, so that helped with the decision process as well.

They were hurting pretty bad too, but at least they hadn't shut down the kitchen yet, so we were good to go.  The waitress was very accommodating and helpful, and we all decided to go with the prix fixe menu.  

For the first course, I chose the make-your-own-salad, in which you got to pick 10 different things and they'd make the salad for you.  For the 3 of us who did that, we had some pretty wild salads, but overall, it was very nicely made.  The other 2 had this sashimi plate that also looked really good.  I would have opted for that, but being that I didn't have my roughage on this trip, I figured that I needed to get some in me.

For the main course, 3 of us went with the Kansas steak.  Yes, it is a bit odd for us to order that being that this is a seafood restaurant, but we set forth with steak on our minds, and this place served it, so we ordered it.  One friend got the grilled Arctic char (fish), and another went with the paella.  I got to sample a little of everything, and they were all excellent.  I was really surprised how well the steak came out.

Dessert was this layered mousse cake with malted ice cream that was really rich and I really felt guilty finishing mine... :)

All of us also went with the wine pairings for the food.  Being that I am not a really sophisticated wine drinker, I guess it was not a bad choice, but the wine that accompanied my steak wasn't really something that I liked.

Overall, the ambiance, the staff, and most importantly, the food, were all excellent.  I am sure that it would have been a livelier experience had there been more people than just another table in the other room.",sMPNFm9hBVT-dhOdUcod5Q,1,1,4,7oKWxGUJqO6QQmbyWYxw5w

The whole experience was fantastic.   Every single item we ordered was delectable!  The pre-dinner naan was buttery, the perfect level of salty, and got our appetites roaring.  My spanish bass was meaty and perfectly paired with asparagus and rice.  I ordered a side of ratatouille, and that was fresh and had the perfect balance of flavors.  It didn't look anything like the dish from the movie though... maybe because a rat didn't make it?

My friends ordered chilean sea bass and cod tagines, and those were served steaming hot.  We noticed they have a happy hour special, but that only applies at the bar.

We were eating dinner a bit late, but were seated right away.  Hostess was nice and gave us an overview of the menu and the ""winter tasting"" prix fixe menu.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive and answered our menu questions, and the bus staff was great at keeping water filled, plates cleared, wine poured, etc.

I ended up going with the Winter Tasting menu (four courses) and hubby went with an appetizer and entree.  The winter tasting menu included a ""meze plate"", with four mini-appetizers; a ""pick your own salad""; seafood ""paella"" with three meat skewers (like satay skewers); and a berry dessert.

The ""meze plate"" included a hummus spread, roasted red pepper dip, herbed yougurt dip, and almonds; all with toasted pita chips, or the bread served (baguette).  Wonderfully fresh flavors & fun to eat and share.  The salad was fine -- many choices of greens, proteins, cheeses, dressings, etc.  My paella was delicious -- not a true paella (not crunchy, etc), more of pilaf rice, fluffy with capers & spices.  Lots of wonderful mussels, shrimp, tiny octopi, fish, clams, Oh My!  in a great sauce/broth.  It wasn't soupy at all, but there was a nice amount of sauce in the bottom of the bowl.

Hubby had the raw plate trio (with a slice of yellow fin, ceviche and tuna kibbeh) that was absolutely spot-on, with all three of the portions.  We would order it again any time!  He had the artic char for his entree.  Delicious -- on a bed of aspargus with a lemon buerre blanc sauce.

We had a table of 8 people, which I dont think is too much to manage, yet we were at the restaurant for over 2 hours.  A complete waste of our time. The food was pretty good but I was really bothered by the lack of attention by the server.  We were constantly flagging them down to serve us, which is so annoying when they should be attentive to us.  At one point, we made eye contact with the server and he acknowledged us, only to try and speed by us without speaking like we werent even there.  He was avoiding us and we were not rude nor demanding at all throughout the duration of the meal so we really didnt understand his behavior.

There was a 20 minute lull between our appetizers and our dinner.  We were literally sitting around the table looking at each other, twidding our thumbs.  No contact from the waitor ensuring us that our dinner would come soon.  No apologies, no nothing.  Its like they didnt even care.

I've been to several restaurants at this level and price range and their service outshines this restaurant by a landslide.  Who wants to pay that type of money only to get horrible service?

When we complained to the manager on duty he was no help and never apologized, nor compensated for the substandard service.  He told us to come back and they would take care of us. REALLY? Why would we come back if the service was substandard to pay even MORE MONEY? Why wouldnt he do something to compensate for the horrific service at that time? He was an idiot and so was the server.  We dined there the night of my sister's bachelorette party on 3/24 and had reservations at 7:00 pm.

You can basically walk up to almost any fine dining establishment and get seated without a reservation.  With that said, I came across Seablue pretty much on a whim because I was just looking for a fancy dinner at a celebrity chef joint that wouldn't exceed $100.  

My original choice to eat that night was Mesa Grill, but their menu didn't appeal to me at the time and I felt compelled to venture down the strip to MGM since I like their restaurant alley near the monorail entrance.  Shibuya was a little out of my range so I walked over to Seablue and liked their diverse menu.  Plus, I assumed that since it's Michael Mina, it must be good.

Inside is very dark and intimate with water flowing down the walls.  The ambiance and decor worked for me as they complimented my food.  Great place for a date.  I ordered their Seablue Paella ($42, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw?select=kVRxMMlxUU30xc-rZhSqDw) because I was intrigued by the fact that it had rabbit and quail eggs.  Before the course they serve you a paper funnel full of Pita flatbread with hummus, goat cheese, and babaganoush (hella good!!!).  The paella definitely wasn't your typical Valencia style and it wasn't as much in quantity, but the quality was very good and every bite had a nice surprise as like all paellas.  The rabbit tasted like chicken though.  I guess that was expected.  My server was very attentive and actually suggested the paella for me, and I'm glad he did.  I also peeked over and saw someone eating their Kobe ribeye, it was huge and looked good also.

* RAW & MARINATED TASTING

- Scallop ceviche with tomato, citrus and avocado
- Yellowtail jack crudo with spicy shiitake mushrooms and ponzu
- Tuna tartare with pocket bread, pine nuts and pomegranate

Honesty, I can't pick which is my favorite of the three because they were all delicious!  Perfect flavors and beautiful presentation.  The pocket bread was grilled flatbread and toasted slices of bread...great for finishing up their dipping sauces too!
 
* FRIED & CRUSTED TASTING 

- Chicken and chorizo empanada, saffron and garlic
- Lobster corn dogs with whole grain mustard creme fraiche
- Crab stuffed piquillo peppers with smoked jalapeno aioli

Also a very good trio.  Not greasy and it didn't feel too heavy at all.

For our mains, I had the POMPANO, a flat fish from Florida which I have not tried before.  My friend had the LOUP DE MER (SPANISH BASS), which our server recommended.  Both were excellent, cooked over their woodburning grill.  They came with minimal sauce so that the flavor of the fish could really shine.  Each dish was served with chickpea and lentil rice, jumbo asparagus and citrus relish.  The portion was just the right amount for me after having an appetizer.

For dessert, we split the SEASONAL ICE CREAM, which is three scoops of their available flavors.  We had a choice of vanilla, cinnamon and/or caramel - all made in-house.  We opted for the first two and my friend asked if our third could be rocky road since we saw that it came with another dessert.  Our server checked with the chef and brought it out for us.

Tuna Kibbeh.  Kind of nasty.  I didn't like the creamy sauce on it but did enjoy the pine nuts.  Scallop ceviche with cukes avocado in a somewhat canned, nasty tomato soup.  SKIP ALL OF THESE.

3965725,2010-09-14,3,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"This was my first Michael Mina restaurant and let me just say that I have fallen absolutely in love. Michael Mina and Stephen Hopcraft (Bravo's Top Chef) have something amazing going on here so I suggest that you make it a priority to dine here on your next Vegas trip. Now I'm going to make sure I give XIV a try, another Michael Mina creation. 

My friend and I were planning a surprise birthday dinner for a good friend of ours and we were trying to decide between Bouchon and Seablue. The birthday girl loves steak and the rest of us loves seafood so we were looking for a happy medium that would please us all. We were also trying to go for a trendier feel so of course Seablue came out on top. I made reservations online and commented that we were coming for my friend's birthday. 

Their hostesses were probably the friendliest hostesses I have ever had to deal with and this is coming from a person that eats out in LA and OC where most places probably pay their hostesses to be super b!tchy. We first called to change the number of people in our party. Our second call was to push our reservations back by a half hour and our third call was to confirm we were coming late. Throughout all this they were very patient, friendly, and accommodating. 

Once we were led to our private table (it probably wasn't really private but no one was in our area) there was a birthday card waiting there in the middle of the table. The hostess politely pushed out our chairs for us while we swooned over the restaurant and the birthday card the restaurant staff wrote. We started off with the lobster corn dogs and garlic pita bread which was accompanied with 3 types of dipping sauces. The lobster corn dogs were amazingly juicy and the soft breading complemented the lobster perfectly. The quality was most excellent. Make sure to dip it in their mustard dipping sauce to give it a little kick.

I got the Alaskan Halibut which was served with chickpea and lentil rice and jumbo asparagus. It was a super thick halibut and it was cooked just right. It wasn't overcooked and dry. The pairing with the sweet lentil rice gave the halibut that extra umph which made the dish enjoyable. The birthday girl ordered the filet mignon and I kid you not, she finished everything that was served on that plate. It looked like the girl licked it dry. My other friend ordered the bacon-wrapped chilean sea bass and she kept raving about it throughout dinner and said it was the best prepared chilean sea bass she has ever had.

We finished up our dining experience with the creme brulee which was highly suggested by our lovely waitress. There were slices of bananas in them sprinkled with cinnamon. They also wrote out ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate. Super sweet touch that just made the birthday girl's night. 

The service is top notch here. You can't beat it. I'm excited to come back with more people. And let me just say that I was beyond nauseous and hungover while I was here but I was still able to walk out of this restaurant overly satisfied. You'll have to shell out a large amount of change here but you get what you pay for. Trust me, they truly deserve it.",yhJ1SVBSjC_R2viEh5AbUA,3,3,4,3dwJ4baAJGIkqOd6_5CfkQ

I ordered the Spanish Sea Bass off the recommendation of our very pleasant server and I was impressed by the simplicity, size of portion, and deliciousness of my meal. They definitely know their fish.

Michael Mina has another restaurant at MGM called Nobhill, and if you ask the hostess about their loyalty program you might learn that visiting another Michael Mina location in Vegas nets you 15% off.

(It pays to go during happy hour, peeps.)

I was apprehensive about the oysters. I'd never had them before and everything about them -- and the places they're usually served -- seemed sketchy. (I am nothing if a cautious eater.) But with some coaching and some fancy condiments, I downed about four of them without grimacing. I think having them first at Seablue put me at ease, but it also spoiled me, as I can't imagine them being this palatable at the next place I dare eat them. 

My favorite was the king crab, which needed nothing added to it. Just the most flavorful and appetizing crab meat I've ever consumed. That macaroni dish was something else, too. The consistency of the pasta is almost as good as it is at Scarpetta.

The bread with pita was great and the complimentary anniversary sorbet was a delicious mango/passion fruit, though quite tiny but a very nice gesture.

The service: I felt it was rude of them to seat us right near the doorway at first and facing the mall with shops, considering we came right at opening and there was plenty of seating, especially at the booths. We had to complain and only then did they relocate us to a more ""intimate"" table.  I found service to be quite slow in taking our order as there was hardly anyone there and they were just off to the side chatting with one another.

My friend and I started out with the salad. You are given a sheet of paper and a pencil to pick 10 items (lettuce, toppings, dressings, etc) for $14. We went with the basic toppings and the creamy cucumber and dill dressing. The perfect amount of dressing was mixed in with the salad and the salad size was just the right size starter.

The bread was fantastic! Warm and yummy. There is a whipped feta, spicy hummus, and some eggplant dip that went perfectly.

Had high expectations once we sat down in the swanky establishment and scanned their extensive menu. Munching on their complimentary pita bread that came with 3 fancy dips, we asked our server for recommendations. One of my pet peeves is when the server simply reads off everything on the menu when asked that question. Yes, I too can read. Exasperated, my bf presses further and asks ""Tell me the one thing that I HAVE to have"". The servers reply was ""lobster pop tart"". Finally, a useful nugget of information. This should've hinted to us that spotty service was soon going to follow. 

In addition we also chose the chicken dumplings, the burger, and truffle mac & cheese side dish. 

Hands down the lobster pop tart was the best dish out of all 4. But $18 was steep for an appetizer that took us about 3 bites to finish (coincidentally, it was the exact dimensions of a pop tart, who would've guessed). The chicken dumplings were dry and flavorless but the truffle mac & cheese was the biggest let down of them all. It was watery and underwhelming...like something out of a kraft microwavable box. My burger & fries were pretty decent, but wasn't worth the $22 price tag. I would've been equally as happy gorging on an in-n-out burger. 

For $100 for 2 people (without drinks) I expected alot more out of you Michael Mina. You have the lobster pop tart to thank or else this would've been a 2 star review.",nyXNNLKjSWtDQka5PrFoew,1,0,3,X0Z_P4N3FapaJV9wvsACHA
4291165,2010-03-02,1,3XE-poXz9CeDao-Q7pqkTw,"So I enjoy food.  No surprise there.  And,  I very much enjoy going to Vegas to indulge in my foodie-ness.  There are a great many places to eat in this food mecca in the desert, and if my bank account had no bottom, I would experience them all.

Now last year, my sister and aunt and I went to another Michael Mina restaurant, also at the MGM.  Unspeakably good!  So were all excited to try Seablue, also at the MGM, also a Michale Mina restaurant.  We checked out the menu online, found that they had an interesting pri fixe menu, and decided to try it.  

So Friday night in Vegas, my sister, cousin, and I found ourselves with an 8:30pm reservation.  The place was still pretty quiet, and were seated right away in a half-booth backed by a really pretty wall-fountain.  The ambiance was great, evoking the ocean without that unnecessary nets-on-the-wall, fish-on-display vibe.  Though the music didn't exactly fit the setting, we couldn't have been happier.  Great 80s pop and alternative--we probably sang along to every song, if not played Name That Tune...

Service was a tad odd.  They don't provide you with menus when you first sit, and the person that does bring the menus isn't knowledgeable about what's on it, so we asked him questions that he basically ignored.  The server came by to tell us about the specials and to take our drink orders.  She left without giving us a chance to ask about the pri fixe menu, which was not indicated in the menu.  When my sister finally had the chance to ask, the server gave a quick and dirty explanation of what was included, how much it cost, and that's about it.  Upon her third return, my sister finally had the chance to ask if wine pairings were included.  While we were happy to order the pri fixe (mainly because a lot of the entree items were on the pricier side), it felt like pulling teeth, having to ask two different people at least three times, if it was even offered, and what was included.

Ok, on to the food...
-The bread they bring out is AMAZING!  Fresh, warm middle eastern flatbread.  It came with a trio of hummus, red paper puree, and a feta cheese-olive dip.  All really good.  Yes, we hail from a middle eastern background; we've got years of family experience and a discerning palate when it comes to this stuff.  All very good!
-The pri fixe started with a larger mezze platter which featured all of the above, and some additional items like olives, spicy almonds, a yogurt and garlic dip, and another dip-like concoction with dates and...something?  Damn I can't remember.  
-The salad course is interesting.  Basically you're given a huge list of greens, proteins, cheeses, nuts, dressings, etc and some golf pencils to make your own.  Awesome!!  My sister and cousin worked on that while I picked out a wine (my sister went ahead with the wine pairings).  You can choose up to 10 ingredients for your salad.  We chose various greens, beets, ham, bacon, cheese, pine nuts, and a really tasty vinegarette.  One of my favorite parts of the meal.
-The main course was family style, complete with skewers of beef, chicken and lamb on a bed of tabouli.  It also included a seafood paella, which I was definitely looking forward to.  I gotta say, not so impressed.  The rice lacked flavor and it didn't have that amazing crunchy layer, which is kinda the best part about the dish.  The proteins were certainly fresh, but paella shouldn't include everything but the kitchen sink.  Pick wisely people!  Halibut, salmon, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, calamari, sausage...a couple more unnecessary proteins.  Too much people!!  

At the beginning of the people, we all cursed ourselves for getting stuffed on the bread, mezze, and salad.  In hindsight, I'm glad we did.  The lamb skewers were amazing, rocked my world, no complaints there.  The chicken skewers were forgettable, the beef had an interesting marinade, but I didn't wake in the night longing for more.  The paella was such a disappointment!  

-Oh yeah dessert.  They definitely made up!  We each got an individual portion of polenta cake and a scoop of creme fraiche ice cream in another bowl, as well as a warm berry topping.  All amazing!  We were unbelievably stuffed when it arrived.  Honestly I had forgotten there was dessert coming.  The meal definitely ended on a positive note with this dessert.  

The price: $45 per person for three courses, I believe an additional $25 or so for the wine pairings.  I sampled the wines; good, not great.  The dessert wine was a keeper though!",zA12DnH8zntG3HzXpmrYBg,1,1,3,Iaw70c7pjD8PY3RJJcufMw

For my entree, I had some type of sturgeon fish. It was grilled no charrred, burnt, overcooked. I didn't like it. I didn't touch it. They didn't take it off my bill. I wasn't happy about that.
The other half had the steak and crab legs. He raved and raved about it. But this is my review not his. Someone tell him to  open his own Yelp account. This review might have gone a bit differently.

To summarize this Ok review for this Ok restaurant. I will not be returning to Seablue nor will I be recommending it to anyone in the future. I am a huge fan of Michael Mina. I use to date this whale who would play in the Bellagio and we'd get comped meals at Aqua now Michael Mina. Not to be a Michael Mina snob but I'd eat at his restaurant maybe 2-3 times a week. So I'm use to his food being STELLAR.

He also has another restaurant in the MGM which I haven't tried but I'm willing to try next month when I return to Vegas.  

Save your money, try one of his other restaurants, like his signature one in the Bellagio. Lobster pot pie, Ahi medallions with foie gras and the ahi tartare with the quail egg, sesame oit and pine nuts, you'll be in heaven unlike Seablue where I was stuck in purgatory.

Appetizers: 
1. Steamed clams - This was one of my favorites of the course. The sauce was just TO DIE FOR. The garlic and the butteryness with the clams...MM MM good. They give you a piece of garlic bread to dip in the remaining sauce. This was kind of burnt in my opinion, but my bf gobbled it right up. 
2. Yellowtail - Almost as good as the clams. pretty darn delicious.

Entree:
1. Seafood Paella - Now, I had no idea what in the hell a ""paella"" was. I even mispronounced it! haha embarrassing. When I got it, it was totally not what I expected. The presentation was cool, with a ti-pee like cover. The meal tasted really scrumptious and healthy. It's pretty hard to make something tasty AND healthy. It's every kind of seafood you can imagine in here, perfect for seafood lovers like me :D
2. Flat iron steak - This was honestly one of the best steaks I've had in a while. No frills, cooked perfectly as asked (medium rare). It comes on a bed of mashed potatoes and giant asparagus spears. 

I believe the third option was some sort of grill fish.

Dessert:
This was the only thing that was a bit disappointing from the tasting menu. Not because it tasted bad, but because there was only one option. Their one option was a Peanut Butter Mousse. I usually never order peanut butter flavored things so I wish they had 2 or 3 options like they did with the entree and appetizer. With that said, it was pretty good for what it was. The BF really liked it a lot. The ice cream that came with the mousse made it more edible for me. 

Overall, it was a great experience at a restaurant in Vegas. For a meal where all 3 courses were great tasting and filling, I feel the price was worth it.

We shared fresh raw oysters and the lobster fritters. Both dishes were amazing. I loved how many accompaniments came with the oysters. I don't love lobster but these little gems were amazing!

For my entree I had the grilled sea bass. Incredible piece of fish. Good sized portion. I loved the sauce it came with - good heat and full flavor.

The decor is lovely. The lights look like huge lampshades and our table next to the bar had those lit indoor waterfalls. Service was only ok - they kind of just threw down flatware and plates, and our waitress wasn't too amicable. 

Between the three of us, we split the fresh/raw appetizer sampler. Three plates of raw fish (well, a tartare, a crudo and a ceviche if you want to get technical...) definitely appealed to the burgeoning fish-lover in me. The tuna tartare has a nice citrus touch to it, and is delightful when mounded over the crostini. The yellowtail crudo was also excellent. I usually hate ponzu since it tends to be too citrusy, but theirs had a nice mellowness to it. It also paired wonderfully with the shiitake on top. Finally, the scallop ceviche was probably my favorite of the bunch. Very interesting texture, and I used the flatbreads to scoop up all the juice.

Decided on the bacon-wrapped sea bass and paella as our mains. The fish was so flaky and tender, and come on, who doesn't love bacon?? The beans I could have done without, not a big bean girl. The surrounding clams were pretty huge (heh heh) and I did get a bit of grit when I chewed into one. In my eyes, the paella was the winner. It's jam-packed with all sorts of shellfish and chorizo, but the quail really shone through. I didn't catch where the rabbit was, though I didn't miss it at all. The calamari was SO tender that I tried to fish as much of it out as I possibly could. 

The final round of desserts was the creme brulee and the chocolate cake. I would seriously come just for the desserts - cinnamon creme brulee = genius!! I liked the giant palmier on the side too. The chocolate cake was just moist enough, and though I was incredibly full, I couldn't stop eating.

The food was outstanding. I have hit my seafood quota for the next week or two.",LRQTlvVNh1u-vVEg_2-Nag,2,1,4,o-xwLUhqFh3eiJxven-OOA

tomato bisque soup was rich and flavorful, thanksgiving lobster bisque soup was too creamy for my taste

For starters, we had scallop calamari and crab cakes. Scallop calamari was fantastic with the delicious sauce it was topped off with. I'm normally not a calamari person either, but I could not stop eating this dish! The crab cakes were so-so, something I would pass on in the future. After our appetizers we got freshly baked pita accompanied with a trio of sauces. We had to ask for this as they told us it was made to order. So make sure to ask for it as it does not disappoint (we were not charged for this either although it was ""ordered""). For my entree, I got the apricot -fired lemon chicken with arugula and sourdough. Amazing! It was filled with flavor and the sourdough were freshly cut into croutons and were just amazing in taste. The rest of the table got the sea bass and the mahi, I believe. Both were delicious. Another got the shrimp scampi which was presented table side, it too was delicious.

4 girls and I came here before they went to see a show. We told the waitress this and she assured us they would make it. She then proceeded to ignore us, give us a hard time for separate checks, leave off one of my dishes so that I got it when everyone else was done eating, and mix up the items on the checks. We had to flag her down or ask other waitstaff several times for the check and to order. The restaurant wasn't busy, as we were one of 2 tables. 

This place ain't cheap. The least expensive items on the menu are the side dishes for $10; most dishes were in the $20 - $40 range. I don't mind paying that much for high quality, well-made food, but fine dining places with upscale ambiances and quality food usually go along with stellar service. Not here. 

As for the food, we ordered the crab-stuffed prawns, lobster ""pop-tart,"" seafood poppers, prawn scampi, and macaroni and cheese. Portions were all pretty small, but everything was fresh and amazing. I wasn't wowed by the pop-tart, and my favorite was probably the scampi. The waiter arranged the prawns and sauce tableside, and the flavor of the sauce on the fresh fish and perfectly cooked pasta was incredible. 

All of the food was brought out at different times, so we couldn't really enjoy it together, but it was still great food.

Despite this I felt the food was overall very mediocre and overpriced, but there was definitely a LOT of food to go around.

The tasting menu was ~$100, and included items that were already on the menu. I was hoping for something more unique from the chef especially since nothing really stood out to me, but I kept an open mind.

FREE PITA BREAD: The best part of the meal. Comes fresh baked out of the oven, chewy and super delicious with 3 types of hummus to dip!

SEAFOOD PLATTER: Meh and double meh. The oysters were pretty fresh but not the best I've tasted. The real downer was the tasteless mignonette sauce which I felt didn't add any taste. The best part of the plate was the gigantic fresh shrimp cocktail, but I'm satisfied with the mass-quantity-shrimp-cocktail at the buffets too... I also realized that I think raw clams are disgusting. If you're really curious, save some money and come for happy hour to try this out for yourself.

SIDE DISHES: One of the stars of the evening was the corn, because unlike most restaurants, the corn was very fresh. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were pretty good, but nothing to write home about. The only thing I really finished out of all the courses was the corn dish.

SCALLOPS TUNA AND STEAK: The scallops tasted pretty fresh, but were not executed well or seasoned well - it was soft and mushy, and just boring. I had to add salt. Same for the seared ahi tuna, except worse. The steak was forgettable, we barely touched this dish.

(not part of tasting menu) CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE: Not that lava-y, and the cake fell apart kind of like styrofoam. It was surrounded by brandied cherries that would have tasted much better without any brandy, and topped with pistachio ice cream. I opted for the malt ice cream, which tasted like frozen sweet cream but not in a good way. Do not recommend.

(not part of tasting menu) SILVER OAK WINE 05 Cab Sauv: I think their wine selection was pretty formidable. Silver Oak is pretty good, but my favorites are still Opus and Melbury.",5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ,1,0,2,8zMheSvn9xp8BPC_mtO2xA

Their happy hour menu is very limited unfortunately.  $2 draft beers, which included Stella Artois and Flat Tire; $1 oysters on the half shell (west coast only); $1 gulf shrimp; 1/2 price lobster corn dogs, and 1/2 price calamari.

Yesterday we indulged in: 

* 4 dozen oysters on the half shell (HH $1 / reg $2) - They were only offering west coast oysters for the happy hour special, but they were nice to chuck in half a dozen east coast oysters too.  They were big oysters, if that can give you an idea of how it might taste.  I did prefer the east coast ones myself.  Served with lemon, horseradish, and two hot sauces from the bottle.  The bartender also gave us this other sauce that worked nicely with the oysters.

* 1 dozen gulf shrimp (HH $3 / reg $2) - These were big buggers, chunky and cooked perfectly.  Came with lemon, cocktail sauce, and green goddess sauce.  The green goddess sauce worked perfectly with the shrimp!

* 4 orders Lobster Corn Dogs ""whole grain mustard aioli"" (HH $7.50 / reg $15) - Four mini corn dogs come in one order.  They are tasty little things, and aren't your average corn dogs at all.  The mustard sauce was just okay though.

* 1 order Salt & Pepper Calamari ""hot & sour dipping sauce"" (HH $5 / reg $10) - Lightly fried where the tentacles still hang with a nice tasting sauce.

Service was fine, we sat at the bar and it was not busy when we arrived around 6 pm.  One thing I appreciate about Michael Mina restaurants is their use of teamwork.  It's not just one person taking our orders, but everyone else helping out with bringing the food out and clearing it too.

We didn't get any of the complimentary naan bread that other people talked about, not sure if it was because we sat at the bar or what.  But I did see another couple at the bar eating it and now I wish I asked for some.

For a very full bar and restaurant- the service wasn't compromised and was attentive. Filled drinks and staff kept passing by to see if people need things and when to bring out our courses.

The flat bread and trio spread they bring out is amazing! I never thought I would be that surprised at a friggin' free bread! I love the texture and flavor of the bread even by itself, but the three spreads: hummus, eggplant and a herb cheese were very nice pairings with this soft and flaky flatbread. Quite impressed with the fact the bread basket isn't a afterthought but part of the experience- they want to start you off right. 

We both had a prix fixe spring tasting menu

First taste
Mine: yellowtail crudo w/ spicy shitake, ponzu sauce
His: tomato crab soup 

Both nice but the soup stood out. Nice lump crab and flavor...had a pesto oil on it and was very nice. Crudo fresh and tasty but it's not memorably inventive in all my crudo/carpaccio/poke fanaticism but definitely was nice...wish it wasnt a measly thin 3 pieces, but I get why though..

We also ordered some king crab legs and were very high quality crab. Some of the most juicy and fresh legs ever,- ""sea tasting"" as crab can get. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. 

Main-both of us did the Paella. Very nice twist on a favorite...I like that it was more risotto like and had broth on the bottom that was nicely spiced. The mix of seafood in it was nice and plentiful- 3 kinds of clams, squid, scallop, white fish I could not identify along with rabbit and sausage and sweet peppers. Loved the big scallop- it was perfectly cooked and I normally don't like big scallops much. I go nuts when people overcook shellfish but all the clams were still very soft and delightful.

Dessert: Chocolate mousse cake...kinda like an opera cake with a brown sugar ice cream. Wasnt on the regular dessert menu. I liked the brown sugar ice cream a lot. The cake was good chocolate flavor and not overwhelmingly chocolate-y. Enjoyable but not mindblowing.

I have dined here 10 times in the past year.  The restaurant is consistent.

Starting off, you are offered naan bread with the perfect toppings.  Just sit back and enjoy some simple wine with this as you read over the menu.

They have an interesting concept for building your own salad (you get to check off items you want on the menu) but really, you can make your own salad at home.  Skip this and move on to the real food.

Appetizers are great.  You can opt to have a selection by category.  Would strongly recommend that you do this to get the most out of your experience.  Lobster corn dogs are great.  Also the yogurt marinated, grilled octopus is excellent.

For an entrée, there is no better option than the Chilean Sea Bass cooked in a mild broth with clams and beans in a tangine.  This is a fantastic dish.  (OK so this fish is supposedly only offered when it is accidentally caught and yet they have had it every time I have dined here.)

We were there on-time and sat at the bar to have a cocktail while they got our table ready.  They seated us and we reviewed the menu.  I chose a caesar salad to start.  My friend got the Tuscan White Bean Soup with Bacon and Shrimp.  Her soup was better than my salad.

Some naan arrived with the starters.  It comes with three spreads - spicy hummus and two others that I didn't taste.  No reason to stray from the outstanding hummus.  The naan was fresh and piping hot.

I ordered the steak.  She got the bacon-wrapped seabass in white beans with clams.  Both were cooked to perfection and outstanding.  I ordered the steak medium.  I wish I knew how I could get a steak cooked that perfectly at home.

We shared a couple orders of their tasting trios to start. The Steamed Tasting Trio, Fried & Crusted Tasting Trio, and Raw & Marinated Tasting Trio. They were all very good. Not a big fan of the Fried & Crusted, but definitely loved the Raw & Marinated. I just personally prefer raw seafood over fried.

My main is Atlantic Cod that was Almond Crusted and served on Couscous with Lemon broth and Artichokes. I can honestly say the cod was probably one of the best fish I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly. The texture was soft and buttery. It feels very light and refreshing. The lemony couscous was a perfect complement.

Service was decent and the waiter was knowledgeable. My fiancee and I ordered the scallops, the sea bass, the artichoke, and asparagus. The asparagus and artichoke sides were both decent, but nothing to write home about. The sea bass was definitely the standout of the night. It was an entire fish cooked to flaky perfection, while still being moist and flavorful. However, the scallops were just way too salty to enjoy.

Because of the scallops and the sense of run-down-ness from the lack of ambiance, the experience was just 3 stars, especially for the price you are paying. But if you do come here, might as well try the fish.",gV6iQqyFRN1Fk-Tb_G5vlA,1,1,3,o1c3Y2rM0cLOlE2hi1QbbQ

The sauces are a winner as well, in case you're not into naked shrimp (I am, but I like to shake things up every now and again). The sangria was tasty, and a little on the expensive side, but given how much I was saving on oysters, it was well worth it.

Seablue has been my wife and my ""stand-by"" dinner of choice for quite a few years. When asked by friends for a non-steakhouse choice ""Seablue is always good"" would be my reply. I hope that I didn't upset too many people by lying to them about the amazing menu selections and service that they would find.

My brother and I met in Vegas last July and when he asked where to eat one night ""Seblue is always good"" was my answer. We arrived at 8:30, were promptly seated and ordered drinks. While waiting for drinks we looked over the menu, a one sheet cardstock menu. When the server arrived with the drinks I asked if we had arrived too late for the regular menu and were looking at the late-night menu.

Our server looked at me confused and said the menu hadn't changed. I asked where the cod and sea bass tangines, the wonderful trios of appetizer tastings, the build your own salads (one of the biggest signatures of Seablue) and the lobster corn dogs were. Once again it was the same menu, but ""changes are made seasonally.""

To keep it short and sweet, the Sea bass was good, my brothers Ahi tuna was good and I can't even remember what sides we had. Our server was rude, and lying about how their full (8 or 10 page) menu was the same as the one sheet menu that we were handed was an insult. By the way, this was the same server that had handed us the older, full menu a year or so earlier. If you are changing your approach to dining, fine. But don't treat me like an idiot when I ask you why you don't serve ANY of the items I've ordered and have been raving about for the last 5 years.

Seablue now has a menu that resembles, stack, fix or any other establishment that wants to get you in and out with a standard ahi, seabass, salmon choice and a just as many steak offerings. If you want amazing fish sold by the ounce or prepared tangine style, make sure you pick the right season before booking dinner at Seablue.",wrMuU1zyKV4dD46iK5PWQA,0,0,2,rNOCUBoliMKpRnazMPdurQ

Eventually, I decided to just order dinner - it was some kind of tastings menu? I remember chopped sashimi, pine nuts, vinegrette, a few other things. It was fantastic and I made a mental note to make sure I came back the next time I was in Vegas.

Fast-forward to a couple of weeks ago. Back at the MGM Sig again, with a date and some friends. Back to SeaBlue, which was unfortunately no longer doing the tastings set. No big, surely the rest of their dinner menu would be of equal quality! We ordered several appetizers - four different ones, as I recall. They were tiny (a bite-ish per appetizer, maybe 4 to a plate), and not terribly flavorful. This includes the mini lobster things. 

When dinner came by, I had some kind of fish stew served over rice, which was mediocre at best. My buddy  Charlie had their steak and it looked okay; his wife had some kind of Firecracker Lobster, and it looked pretty good? 

When it comes down to it, it just wasn't worth the money spent - there are far better restaurants in Vegas. They did have a nice variety of oysters, so I suppose I'd recommend you chill at the bar and have some oysters and a beer, but don't bother with the meals. 

If you want sushi/sashimi I would recommend Social House, but I have not been to their new location in the Aria. It was absolutely glorious when still housed in Treasure Island.",AEdFJbm4nLuyCTa7rVAaTQ,0,0,2,VXKxxacujhvTkIES_UoOpg

Both owned by Michael Mina and this one was really good too.  Again thanks to our teammates for taking down the Yelpmazing race once again and thanks to Misti and MGM for such an awesome hook up!

Assuming the tasting would be kinda like Fiamma where it would be a set thing...the server informed us that they didn't have a seasonal menu anymore.  So we could pick any 2 tapas, split a Seablue salad, filet mignon and sea bass for entrees and then we would figure out dessert later.  Sounded a-ok to us!!

The naan that came with red pepper hummus, spicy hummus and a feta dip was a welcome surprise over the traditional bread/butter bowl.  It was really hard to tear ourselves away from it realizing we had to pace ourselves if we didn't want to just box the entrees to go without taking a bite of it.  

If they're letting us choose the tapas...OFCOURSE we're picking the most expensive ones!!  The prawn cocktail ""a la minute"" was 5 perfect shrimp poached in ocean water on a bed of seaweed and ice.  The poaching gave it a real nice tenderness to the prawns you normally don't get in a cocktail. 

Next appetizer was the lobster fritter.  3 kinda corndoggy/kaboby deep fried pieces of lobster with bacon and an upscale mayonnaise type sauce on lettuce.  I could've eaten at least 10 more.  That good.  Really!!

Seablue salad was nice and light.  The serrano ham and radish gave it great flavor.

Entrees were great.  To our surprise, we both preferred the filet mignon over the seabass.  They also gave us 2 sides..crushed potatoes and steamed spinach.  Totally unexpected!

So...much..food...what's the smallest dessert you have??  Profiteroles...rocky road ice cream in a chocolate crusted nut ball.  WOW!

The seasonal menus were priced at $49 per person but we ended up getting almost $150 worth.  The entrees still tasted great 2 days later :)

My only gripe is that this is listed as a ""romantic"" restaurant.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  Too loud, kinda cramped and the music fits group dining over couples.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,6,5,5,QtCkU_eC6_S_Z1BUSQJ9UQ

Let's just get this out of the way: the only reason this place doesn't get my 5 stars is because of the HUGE disparity between Happy Hour prices & not. Dear God.

I ate here for dinner after a particularly terrible check-in to the MGM Grand (1 star review pending) & was already in a foul mood. However, all was forgiven after my first bite. The food here is divine. I don't remember specifics because of de facto Vegas inebriation having kicked in by meal time, but the 4 main dishes we ordered were amazing. The staff is phenomenal (thanks to Tina for complimenting my fiance's engagement ring multiple times!), the food was cooked perfectly, & nary a soul at my table had anything bad to say. If you've read my other reviews, you know I'm a seafood lover, & this place delivers the goods. Tab was around $340 for 4 people, including drinks and ton o' oysters.

THEN, we ate there again later that weekend for Happy Hour. Holy sheesh, hello $120 bill despite ordering more oysters/drinks/food. Fine, restaurants have Happy Hour for a reason, but a $220 difference? Yowza.

Don't let that deter you from eating here at any time of day though. Food was definitely worth every penny in both scenarios. I've never heard of Michael Mina but damned if I wouldn't high-5 him if I ever met him.",eXEyNOp2H_itIXUoX4tldQ,1,1,4,odwk0ZXqmJ8lhVoQQA6jdw

Five of my friends and me decided to eat here, since it was comped.

The seafood platter was the best thing I ate that night: manila clams, lobster tails, JUMBO shrimp, and huge CRAB legs! YUM! It ended up being about $250 for it, but it was soooo fresh!

The bread (sort of like pita) was great, and it included different dips like hummus and cheese. For my main entree I ordered the sea bass wrapped in bacon! It was sooo good! You're looking at about $50+ for an entree, btw. The ambiance itself was fabulous! I loved the walls with those waterfalls!

The ambience is tranquil and sleek with illuminated cascading water fountains that make up the perimeter. We decided to a series of small plates (appetizers) instead of the entrees which are a bit more traditional in selection. The meal began with seasoned crisps and a trio of creamy feta, red pepper dip and hummus. The caesar was good, the soft shell crab was more of a salad taster (a lot going on); but my favorites were the stuffed prawns and the lobster puff.

Finally the freshly made mini chocolate bon bons were to die for! 4 appetizers and 1 glass of wine came to $100 after tax and tip. Not bad for the strip and an excellent dining experience.

We were seated right away and there wasn't a lot of people in the place for 730 but more people did start showing up later.  The head waiter was great right from the beginning.  He confirmed no one had any food allergies, explained the menu since most of us had never been there and was on top of everything we asked for.

We first ordered wine and the seafood platter with lobster, clam, shrimp & oysters.  Everything was very fresh and yummy.  I always thought oysters were not good but these were actually really good and I enjoyed them more than the clams.  After that we ordered family style caesar salad with crab on top.  Again the salad was so good and crab delish!  The waiters all made sure things were cleaned up and off the table before bringing the next course.  We got new plates and silverware pretty much every time.  I thought that was interesting.

Dinner came and our table had steak, salmon, halibut, scallops and crab.  Along with sides of mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, spinach and asparagus.  Everyone pretty much tasted everything on the table and wow it was all perfectly cooked.  My favorites was the steak and scallops for the main course.

(They have as many crawling options as they do swimmers, FYI.)

The menu changes according to what's uber fresh, but this is what we had:

*Michael Mina-signature trio of steamed mussels and the soup trio--these are something between small plates and entree-sized plates, let's call them Goldilocks servings. They were juuuust right. 

*delicious Arctic Char, less fishy than salmon, but just as flavorful. 

*being kind of a picky eater who has to swap out the super starchy sides almost everywhere I go, I was delighted that the sides here for the wood burning grill entrees were chickpea and lentil rice and seasonal vegetables.

Seablue is an informal place, with a glazed brick floor, lots of wood, and lively music.  Paper placemats serve in lieu of table cloths.  The overall lighting level is low, but spots on the tables provide plenty of light.  There's a fair amount of noise, but it's not overwhelming.  Service is pleasant and fast paced, but not rushed.

The bread of the evening was nan.  This fried Indian offering was served with three dips:  olive oil; eggplant spread; crumbled feta.  The eggplant spread was especially good.

Seablue offers a number of appetizers.  If you have trouble deciding, they offer several tastings consisting of small portions of three different appetizers.  I chose a marinated trio:  scallop ceviche, grilled octopus, and shrimp.  All were good, but the octopus was the star.  A piece of a tentacle, slightly spicy, firm but not chewy, with a decidedly smoky flavor; worth ordering on its own.

My entree was Loup de Mer, a fish from the Mediterranean.  Grilled, it was moist, somewhat firm, and mild flavored.  A good amount of lemon juice enhanced its flavor.  The fish was served skin on, but filleted; a nice touch.  It was served with mashed potatoes strongly flavored with olive oil, plus asparagus and mushrooms.  I thought it was very good, but some people might be turned off by the strong olive oil flavor of the potatoes.

Dessert was Pistachio Frangipane with Roasted Pineapple and Coconut Sorbet.  Wow!  I'm not sure how to describe it: kind of like a flat corn meal cake, loaded with chopped nuts and drenched in butter.  The coconut sorbet was intensely flavored and very rich.  If you like rich desserts, this is the one to get.  If you don't like fat, stay away.



My overall impression? Other than the Pistachio Frangipane dessert, nothing about this place knocked my socks off.  However, everything was good, and had character.  I liked the strong flavors, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  Recommended to all.

We had a staff of 3-4 servers depending on the course, and you can bet that if a team of servers can satisfy a really large party in a private room, they can do wonders if you're just looking for a great place to eat for a reasonable number of people in or around the MGM Grand.

We had the cold seafood platter to start, followed by the lobster bisque and a choice of fish, chicken or steak + salad, and i was really impressed.

Michael Mina, you're a culinary master! You've made me fall in love with another one of your fabulous restaurants. 

So what exactly is Seablue? It's a pretty casual fish house with an open kitchen and lit running water in the background.  Look up and you'll notice giant red-orange lanterns overhead.  The overall restaurant is pretty dimly lit though.

The meal starts off with freshly baked naan flat bread accompanied by three dipping sauces.  You'll be able to sample some hummus, red pepper puree, and a feta cheese & olive spread.  The naan itself was really flavorful and crispy and I liked the red pepper puree spread the best.  It had a really nice sweet flavor to it. For feta cheese lovers, the spread was pretty mild and the olives were not too salty.

For the main course, I ordered the Bacon-Wrapped Chilean Sea Bass Tagine ($38) and it was SOOOO good. The fish was served with cannellini beans, manila clams, stewed tomatoes, shallots, and brocollini in a toasted garlic jus.  The fish itself was so buttery, smooth, and tender that it just melts in your mouth. My mouth is actually salivating right now!!  The cannellini beans were more on the solid side and the brocollini gave the dish complexity with added springiness.  The manila clams were a little more fishy for my tastes, but it didn't detract from the other tasty components of my dish.

I ended my meal with Michael's Root Beer Float ($9). Apparently you can order this dessert at all of his establishments. For anyone who hasn't tried this yet, I suggest trying it at least once.  The float consisted of sassafras ice cream, root beer sorbet, and root beer.  Chocolate straws also stem from the glass for the illusion effect of being real straws you can drink out of.  Sadly, you can't.  Believe me I tried! :)  The overall drink was really refreshing and had a subtle minty flavor to it.   The chocolate chip cookies were DELICIOUS.  They were warm and chewy and the bittersweet chocolate and nuts rounded out the cookie's taste and texture.

I had an awesome meal and can't wait to check out another Michael Mina restaurant in the future.

Had the VIP desk at the Bellagio make the reservation.  The restaurant wasn't really full, we arrived on time and still had to wait 10 minutes to be seated.   That is when the waiting began.  The waitress assumed the whole table was having wine, when half of us were drinking cocktails. So it took about 30 minutes to get the wine and cocktails to the table.  There were 8 of us and 7 of us ordered the custom made salads.  It took 25 minutes for them to arrive.  When we complained to the manager, he said that it only took 15 minutes.  I have a stopwatch on my watch and set the timer after we had waited for 5 minutes.  By the time 10 o'clock rolled around, we were done.  Still no food.  Let's just say, it wasn't a pretty scene.  The manager was really argumentative and unpleasant.  The waitress was nice, but poorly trained and had no support.  The bread was great - perhaps the entrees would have been good as well.  We'll never know.  The next night we went to ""the Fix"" at the bellagio - the food AND the service were fabulous.",WBX9XQDXWraCcEwYaxz2VA,0,0,1,ek_xihcvCnWIvkd31uGHOA

Currently their executive chef is Stephen from Top Chef DC and I was so thrilled to meet w/ him in person (as I'm the biggest fan of Top Chef).  He came over to our table and chatted w/ us.  He had great personality and we even took pictures together.  
I would definately go back here again and would recommend this place for anyone visiting Las Vegas or staying at MGM!",WzHMN3og5FjPWoME81t3lw,0,0,5,oeN-u6vB_c1NoG6sVkf6Cw

Definitely get there right when happy hour starts so that you can get a seat because people wait outside the doors for the restaurant to open.",3ba-NJa9aWu12r6hgtmWVg,0,0,4,_6VhBXO5ZRAuyL4EJRyy4A

They range depending on the restaurant of course, but they are amazing deal for a nice 3-4 course menu.

We came here for my friend's bridal dinner.  Since there were 7 of us girls we didn't want to bother with the hassles of ordering so we asked the chef to put together whatever he thought we would like.  I must say that they exceeded our expectations.   

What came out was spectacular.  We started off with some pita bread with a trio of dipping sauces.  Then came the cold seafood appetizers: Oysters, Smoked Mussels, King Crab Legs, Tuna Kibbeh with pinenuts and Asian pear, Prawn Cocktail, and Seared Albacore.  Soon after out came Lobster Fritters followed by the White Prawn Scampi.   Save the best for last.  We were presented with 2 entrées for our main course.  First, a whole Spanish Sea Bass that was expertly de-boned.  The meat was mild, seasoned perfectly, and absolutely amazing.   Then out came the HUGE Bistecca Alla Fiorentina, a Florentine Porterhouse that was perfectly medium rare, topped with sautéed mushrooms.  It was so good even on a full stomach that it made my heart jump a beat.  Whoa, I am salivating as I write this.  For sides we had grilled asparagus and sautéed spinach, I guess those were good too.

We were given warm towels to wipe our hands before our array of desserts.  Compared to the food, the desserts didn't make as much of an impact but they were enjoyable along with my fresh mint tea. 

The service was friendly and impeccable as always.

So how much did all this come out to?  Oh, about $1200 or so...but we did have a lot of cocktails.",doK5Bf6OLlu2GdjL7x1_HQ,7,7,5,7j1vwlCUrEjlugUdWQqGkQ
