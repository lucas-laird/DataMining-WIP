Not only did they listen, they got it right and boy was it good. We have gone back again and again and the food is amazing. Try the chicken wings and pizza, you wont be sorry. It's not your cookie cutter pizza place. IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!",nJyvD2zo8vmkyFynIHbusw,1,0,5,BqEIdnyrljfBqBbG93aPMA

Just by chance I was checking out Yelp and family wanted pizza, looked up my area and saw it, gave it a chance and we are set. 1 Xlarge cheese , 1 Xlarge sausage.  Will be back again.",fXoRbexn_Xco49JhGMEz1Q,0,0,5,Tl_xFv11CEEmA8i9IUEp5g
