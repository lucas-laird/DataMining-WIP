Food was average.price ok.

The practices of the owner (a lady in casual clothes) and the server (lady named hyo won,i think.not sure) was not exactly as clean as i expected it to be. Started with the server dropping cutlery on a table in the back which was directly visible to our table. She picked it up and put in back with the other clean ones.ugh.i was willing to let that slide,given the table supposedly is clean. 

2.as the owner and server was cleaning up the table beside us,clearing plates and all the owner wiped the table with a wet white cloth and didnt wipe it dry. I didnt see her or the server wash their hands either because when the owner put the wet cloth away,she was out right away which means she didnt have time to wash. Server too.out of the back right away.no qiping hands or anything.ughhh.

Considering it was 1140 at ngit they were super understaffed but surprisingly food didnt take too long to come out. Decent waiting time.

Lastly.the worst experience.and a complete no-no for owners to do to restaurants--- 

I paid with my card..automatically noticed that there was no service charge included. Didnt want to charge the tip on the card and wanted to leave cash on the table for tip instead.but what did the rude owner do?? Said out loud in a really loud voice in front of other restaurant patrons ""EXCUSE ME! EXCUSE ME! YOU DID NOT LEAVE A TIP! SERVICE CHARGE IS NOT INCLUDED HERE!""

the nerve! I told her we were gonna lrave cash for the tip.which we already had on the table.

TO THE OWNER::DO NOT EMBARRASS PATRONS LIKE THAT.HAVE YOU NOT HEARD OF CHAGED BILL WITH CASH LEFT FOR TIP. IN THE FIRST PLACE,IF YOUR SERVICE IS GOOD YOU SHOULDNT BE WORRIED IF PEOPLE ARE GONNA LEAVE TIPS OR NOT. BUT I GUESS SINCE IT IS NOT GOOD-AS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED,THEN YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED. YOU DID NOT EVEN DESERVE TO BE TIPPED.

it was a mistake to give this place a chance despite all the negative reviews.NOT WORTH IT.initially i thought the revieqs were just because the pips who did reviews were drunk but apparently,drunk or not YOU KNOW BAD SERVICE (FROM THE OWNER) WHEN YOU GET IT.",1f-jp5X-ALP-4YrUneOhtQ,2,0,1,jdk-9AlhxkHoETDcfzmhAQ

The place was horribly understaffed, even for the 4:00 A.M. visit I had there with a friend. The customer service reflected this with nonexistent etiquette, an intolerable waiting time for the food, and unacceptable waitressing. In addition to things like forgetting our utensils and dropping dirty plates on the ground, it took us a whopping 15-20 minutes JUST so our order can be taken from the lone waitress there so we can get a idea or at least an illusion of things being in the works towards getting our food onto the table. About 80% of the tables there however were occupied and a single waitress had to take care of them all! It almost looked like she was on the end of a tasteless prank or something. 

At the end of our stay, what really broke the camel's back was the random, unannounced, and overly large forced tip included in our total. As our culture really needs to understand, forced tips logically invalidate the entire point of a tip which is a charitable, voluntary, and varying amount of money we give to somebody if we're pleased by their service.

On the plus side however, the food was pretty decent and even looked better than it did on the menu. This is the only thing that salvages the place to get a 2/5 instead of a 1/5, but either way I definitely wouldn't ever recommend somebody here.",4R3nkeki8dPWE3t8VuDzwQ,0,0,2,N8GD9mbJlZOsZ1etFSwdfA

food sucks, msg in kalbitang. we had bibimbap, fried rice, kalbi tang, tofu soup and spicy beef soup. not a single one of them impressed us.

price is somewhat expensive. 12.95 for mediocre tofu soup, and 15.95 for bibimbap. 

fried rice has no taste. i don't know if they forgot to add seasoning at all.

the food pic in the menu is totally different. bibimbap pic looks like it has plenty of veggies, the real thing is half the size and not filled with veggie. the fried rice pic is also different, it's like ordering sunny side up and you got scambled egg

banchan is only 4 kinds: cabbage kimchi, anchovy, beansprout and chinese brocolli. the kimchi taste like kimchi that you buy from ranch99 in bulk

when asked for the bill, we had to wait 30 mins

ordered hot tea that costs money and the hot water is not refilled everytime. we had to ask the server for hot water, and she's so stingy with hot water.

I'm actually Korean and felt that the Korean dishes were pretty authentic in flavour. However, thought the prices were a tad over priced but I guess that's normal because the restaurant is located in a hotel. My GF and I ate here 4 times during our stay at the Quad (aka Imperial) over the past weekend. When you order any Korean dishes, you will receive the side dishes. You receive about 4 side dishes which is pretty standard for any Korean restaurant you go to. I wished the mash potato was warmed up a bit as it was really cold, their seaweed was tasteless, bean sprouts were yummy and seasoned perfectly while their kimchi was fermented perfectly to my liking.

I was hungover a couple of times and their pho tai always cured it. Although pho is only $5 (small) from where I come from, they charge $10 and it is only one size. The broth was clear, not oily at all and they give you ample noodles and beef. Pho tai is rare beef noodle in soup but every time I received it, the beef was already fully cooked. Thankfully not chewy at all. I never could finish the entire pho (but then again I never can finish anything I eat in the States, why are the food portions so large in the States?) The broth was very flavourful, they give you the usual lime and bean sprouts but cheaped out on the fresh basil leaves. There is no MSG in the soup as it wasn't salty at all.

It serves relatively good pho
It's right upstairs in our usual Vegas hotel.

Cons: It's a big expensive (but it's Vegas... it's actually decently priced for Vegas)
The service is way iffy.
It's almost never busy?

I've been here twice, about 3 years apart.  The first time was with a friend after we got impatient waiting for the more rowdy of our group to make it to dinner.  We each had an entree, and I honestly can't remember what it was.  Not because I was under any sort of influence, it was simply forgettable food.  I'm pretty sure I only drank water, and still paid about $12.  I was unimpressed, but grateful there was somewhere easy to grab some food.

My second experience was better.  At 2am, after a night of clubbing, few things feel better than a big bowl of pho.  BF and I split a basic order of the miracle soup and some spring rolls.  Both were very good and hit the spot.  I'm not saying it's as good as some local asian restaurants, but it did the trick.  

I could swear it was the same waitress both times.  She said barely a word, stopped by only as often as she needed to, and left us to eat in peace.

This is definitely not a ""when in Vegas, go to...."" kind of place.  But it's great for a desperate midnight food run, especially as hangover prevention!",iN7T3vQoC3v_MPs2TzH5Zw,2,1,3,krtqE-jkJLU4OJZ4QzM-aA

Yes, it's vegas and food is usually over priced. But at least over priced for good food! Anyway, we got a 20% discount check for this place and it still ended up overly expensive.

Rainbow Roll: $14

And my bf got some kind of soup for $16.

And we ordered soju (she told us there would be tiramisu soju but it ended up being a regular flavor soju). The soju is $18.

They included the gratuity tip to the check, it came out to be $50. Superrr expensive for pricey food. For $50, I would have went to the WYNN Buffet instead!

Anyways, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't delicious either. It was your average conveyor belt sushi. If you can, avoid this place and go somewhere with better quality of food.

Both jjigaes were quite good, probably the best kimchi jjigae I've had in a restaurant stateside. The soondubu jjigae was good but could've been a touch spicier.

Their eggrolls were also not very good and tasted like they were taken from the freezer and heated up. As for the sushi? It didn't taste fresh and was also probably just taken out of the fridge and transferred onto a platter before being served to us. The one thing that I did enjoy was the Korean spicy seafood soup. It was a pretty good portion and not too spicy.

Aside from most of the food they serve, one major thing that stinks about this place is the service. They had switched two of the pho dishes (or shall I say ""paw"") and gave my cousin the wrong pho bowl. They gave her the one with just steak when she had ordered the one with steak, brisket, and flank. She told the servers about this and they wanted to charge her an extra $4 to add the extra meat to her bowl! Unbelievable! They obviously did not know how to handle this problem very well.

The restaurant itself offers Korean, Japanese and Chinese entrees, but I'd say the emphasis is on Korean food. 

I had the Tofu Soup, my brother had the assorted tempura appetizer, and we split a sushi that had some special name - and had shrimp, crab and avocado. 

The tempura was your average fare, no better or worse than what you would get at a typical restaurant. The sushi was very good, which was due, of course, to the rice being correct - which leads me to believe that the other types of sushi they offered would also be very good. 

I was kind of wary of the Tofu Soup because the picture of the chili pepper next to it, but it wasn't that spicy. The flavor was pretty good, but I ordered it with the beef and found the beef to be really tough and it took away from the enjoyment of the soup - maybe next time I'll order it with seafood. I'm also pretty fond of dropping a raw egg into the piping hot soup and I didn't get to experience this either. 

The prices are a little higher than what you would get off strip, or even in Los Angeles, but that is expected. All in all, a satisfying and enjoyable experience",BmlwF7AX5gTpSXtyNdqpfg,0,0,3,ewbtm_cLUAEg7zWEY9VtmQ

They added peas & cube-cut carrots to the fried rice, and to me, I think that makes the rice look like it could have come from Panda Express!

The restaurant is Korean Japanese Chinese but it seemed like the focus, waiters and perhaps cooks were Korean.  

My wife and I split a spicy (delicious) beef soup.  The waiter was excellent, he gave us extra kimchi, broccoli, sprouts, etc side dishes and an extra side of rice (for free!).

Interesting to see some of the previous experiences at this restaurant.  I suspect because of the strip location there is prob high staff turnover (leading to inconsistent service).

The price was a bit higher than I'm used to back home, but with the extras they gave us we were both full and satisfied for only $16 total!

Anyways I would definitely go back here for another meal, the restaurant (unlike the rest of the hotel) was renovated when they opened a couple of years ago.  The central location on the strip and late night hours are just too good to pass up.

One other thing I noticed, it seemed like there was a steady stream of IP hotel guests picking up orders and bringing them back to their room.  Probably a better option than IP room service.",Ly34irfwImQRQnCjrucsrQ,1,2,4,FTXwCTdlSOXqK_DvC-sWmg

1958799,2010-03-02,0,3j_mvJHnT7nJd7su_7zazw,"This is probably one of your better bets for a late, late night meal on the strip. Many of the 24 hour coffee shops in the casinos either stink or will have very long waits. Many casinos are trying to cut costs. For example, Bally's coffee shop is not longer 24 hours. That means the cafe at Paris is supposed to serve not only Paris, but also Bally's (they are connected by a shopping area). Imperial Palace closed down their coffee shop and now their late night options are Ginseng 3 or the really overpriced Burger Palace. Ginseng 3 is a bit off the beaten path so there usually isn't too much of a wait. I think we had to go up 2 or 3 escalators to get to it. We wouldn't even have know about it if we hadn't seen the advertisement at the monorail station (I'm sure the marketing guys will be glad to know their sign worked).

Ginseng 3 is pretty much like the standard 24 hour tofu houses one finds in K-towns all over. They do throw in some other stuff like Chinese food, a sushi menu, and if you want some late night Korean BBQ they will bring a small grill to your table. The prices are really high though, but that is to be expected given its location. I think I paid $17 for a soft tofu meal, which is about $7 more than it costs here in Southern California. Still, I'd take it over the $12 burger and fries at Burger Palace any day. The server did not ask how I wanted the tofu and it ended up being spicier than I like. 

I think we liked this place more than we should have because we were in good moods being in Las Vegas, had a few drinks, were starving, and felt lucky to finally find a place were we could be seated right away (everywhere else was at least a 1 hour wait).

Obviously this place is on the Strip, at the Quad, blah blah, but I find these prices ridic!

Anyway, onto the food:
There's no kids menu, so Hunnie Bunnie just had the Pho Tai ($10.99): This is actually great becauae she loves pho. The bowl was big and the flavor was GOOD. It comes garnished with sliced onions and green onions and a side of lime, cilantro, fresh jalapeños and bean sprouts.
Friend and I shared Spicy Squid with Vegetables ($21.99) and Spicy Pork Soondubu ($13.99):
The stir fried squid was extra spicy which was totally awesome and they didn't seem TOO skimpy on the squid but there were TONS of veggies, including kimchi, onions, green onions, bell peppers and jalapeños in the mix. 
The Soondubu came SKIMPY with BEEF! Yeah we ordered Pork but this is what we got. Ugh! It came with lots of broken up tofu which I HATE. I prefer larger clumps in my soup! The soup flavor was just aiight too!

We definitely approached with caution, but since we had trekked over to the Quad in the cold just to find that our original destination, Hash House, was already closed, we gave it a shot.

It wasn't as bad as we had feared. The prices are steep (no $6 bowls of pho here), the service rather inattentive despite the fact that we were 1 of only 3 groups there, but the food itself was halfway decent. It may have helped that it appears Korean-run and we ordered Korean food. The soondubu, which I don't remember coming with an egg, tasted fine. The jiggae was almost the same, with kimchi and a bit more variety. The panchan selection was very limited. 

Overall, the food and prices do not compare to anything in K-town or Cupertino, but if you're in Vegas and realllly want yourself an Asian food fix without the hassle of going all the way out to Spring Mountain Rd, Ginseng is an okay alternative.

Ginseng 3 is a 24/7 restaurant serving only food in the Chinese, Korean, or Japanese genre.  It is found on a quiet fifth floor of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino.  It catered to us because we were hungry, were staying at the IP, and didn't want to walk far way for lunch.  The ambiance is very simple, the menu categorized by cuisine, and the service par.   

I can say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of my food.  I had teriyaki with 4 pieces of California roll.  The price is moderately high, but now I learn the risk factor is low.  

To the drunk guy who  sat down at our table holding a bottle of Bud in your hand just to pay us a visit, I hope you're okay.

We had really low expectations because the place looks like it's having an identity crisis. Korean, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. and the name of the place is ""Ginseng"" which I'm sure the owners thought long and hard about coming up with something original.

Hell, room service costs more at Caesar's Palace because I once ordered salad and chicken soup and it came out to $60, not to mention that the noodle soups at Beijing Noodle No. 9 are priced at $16 with barely any noodles and flavor. So, with pho being at about $11-$12 is actually reasonable.  You're saving gas and time from leaving the strip and the hassle of parking and possibly more waiting when you get there.

I've been here a couple times - once for Korean food and another time for pho.  The food isn't the best I've ever had, but this is Vegas.  You can't expect everything to taste good since every damn place on the strip is over-hyped (except EOS).  Quite frankly, I don't remember what I ordered back then, but if I'm a returning visitor, their food was probably decent.  Anyway, we ordered 2 bowls of pho tai.

My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day, there was no wait at 10pm and the servers were friendly enough.

We ordered the tempura, a California roll and the Tiger roll, which came to about $50. That is a little pricey for me, since at home I could get the same thing for about $20 at a nice sushi place, but it is cheaper than other Vegas Strip Sushi joints. They also include an 18% tip on your bill, no matter your party size. 

The food was average. The fish smelled okay but I doubt it was fresh, but they use fake crab fill in everything to make the roll bigger. For example, the tiger roll was suppose to be avocado with shrimp inside and tuna/ avocado on top.  it came with one tiny shrimp and a small bit of avocado inside surrounded by the fake crab fill. The tuna was also not sliced tuna but a flaked tuna that was marinated and mushed back together on top.  I have had a lot better.

The tempura was okay, but I thought it was odd to see onion rings included.  Usually I don't receive onions in the tempura.  This was only okay and not greasy, but The dipping sauce wasn't as good as other places I've been too. 

I was disappointed they brought the bill without asking if we would like dessert.  So I left without trying the Exotic Bomba, which had looked pretty yummy.

What's even stranger is that this restaurant is located in Imperial Palace. I never thought that I'd see an Asian restaurant with hot stone bibimbap anywhere on The Strip, actually. So, I give this place points for even existing.

The food was, at its best, just alright. Mark S. and I came here after a visit to Oshea's bar. We had a late-night Asian food craving, and since this place is open 24 hours, we figured we might as well give it a shot. When am I going to learn that Vegas is not the place to find good Asian food?

I ordered their hot stone bibimbap with kalbi beef, which was $17 -- Yes, I paid around $17 for the worst bibimbap I've ever had. Seriously, it came out kinda tacky, with a weird ""chip"" on the top, and I have no idea what it was to this day. All I know was that the ""chip"" was super salty, and there was only one of it in the bowl. Not to mention that the banchan was non-existent. In fact, we only had a side dish of kimchi and that was about it. The bibimbap itself was way too greasy, and the kalbi tasted like ground up hamburger, which it probably was. Anyways, it was easily the most flavorless bibimbap I've ever had -- you'd think I'd at least enjoy it in my drunken state.

If you're particular about your Asian food, don't come here. To be fair though, I only had the Korean food. I didn't try the other stuff.

Either way, with its ridiculous prices and mediocre service, I will not be back. I know that Vegas is expensive, but $17 for one bowl of bibimbap that had no flavor and no banchan is just way too much to ask for.",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,2,2,2,0WRqq5xioX_RPVGpSry8dw

Of course when you're wandering through the Asian-themed Imperial Palace, it's completely reasonable to start craving Asian food -- pho, naeng myun, gyoza, orange chicken, soon dubu... this place has a more or less all-encompassing menu of late-night Asian (and pseudo-Asian) comfort food.

I was really tempted to get japchae (one of my favorite noodle dishes!) but then I spotted the bibim naeng myun (spicy cold noodles) and just had to get it. It had been so long since my last bowl of cold chewy buckwheat noodles drenched in a gochujang-based sauce and topped with Asian pear, beef, and a boiled egg. The bibim naeng myun here was fiery red but not very spicy. I had to ask for more gochujang. It helped. Pretty overpriced at $12+ but not bad.

M was really craving pho so he ordered the pho tai (Vietnamese beef noodle soup with sliced beef). The broth was okay, pretty comparable to the Korean-owned pho places here in LA. Nothing that a dollop of hoisin sauce and a squeeze of lime couldn't improve.

The dining area was reminiscent of BCD Tofu House (the newly remodeled one off Wilshire in LA) and the staff was largely Korean. Having observed that, I'd recommend going with a Korean dish from their extensive menu (naeng myun, soon dubu, kimchi chigae, etc.). Relatively more authentic. It's situated off the beaten path, up a few escalators, but if you're hungry late at night and craving the Asian persuasion, check this place out. It's A-OK!",exVzet9UvEY69NPMyG9AMQ,4,2,3,YnNcyNKCwwUOCV-ayqHdRQ

So, my boyfriend and I came to eat here around 3AM since it was close by and seemingly the only restaurant open at that time. This is definitely more of a Korean restaurant with some Chinese and Japanese items on the menu. There's even a TV playing non-stop Korean music videos on the wall.

Our waitress told us that the only items that weren't available were the bento boxes. Which was fine, because I was craving some soup, so I went with the kimchi jjigae. My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken, which came with rice and broccoli on the side. The panchan came out first, but there were only about 5 sides. I liked my soup, but the chicken was just so-so. It's probably best to stick to the Korean items on the menu. For drinks, soda is served in a can.

The service was good, but there weren't too many people there. On the downside, we were automatically charged 18% gratuity for only two people. I agree that the tipping policy should be mentioned somewhere on the menu, so it's not such a shock!

Expect prices to be high here. It is Vegas, after all. But if you're out really late, and you don't want greasy fast food, this place is worth a try.",qaDY1OE9to548_o-nWLiTQ,3,2,3,KQwmwbhAVtkPHwAamGqLCQ

Food was just okay, nothing to brag about.  I've had better.  My husband ordered Kimchi stew.  I had some flavor, but nothing I'd order a second time.  I ordered stir fried noodle with chicken.  I needed a magnifying glass to find the chicken....maybe four or five  very small pieces smaller than a walnut.  Flavor was good, noodles and stir fried veggies good.  Again, nothing to brag about.  $3 for one tea bag and hot water....a little pricey.

I had a kimchi stew, but I thought it was somewhat disappointing.  The amount of kimchi served was almost nothing...and they charged my mother two dollars extra for an extra serving when she asked. Most korean places would serve you extra for free. 

My mother and sister ordered fried rice. The portions were terrible and I thought it didn't even smell that good when it was delivered. It looked like something I could've easily batched up for under 2 dollars, though in much higher quantities. 

It gets even worse when they automatically add 18% gratuity when the service is virtually non-existent. Turned what was a 36 dollar meal in to a 50 dollar meal after gratuity and taxes. Terrible.",R9Ek3DW06t_hpIjWzovfMw,1,0,1,T08QJv7srvQLKmBrHoqaxw

Both times I went for soup, once for the beef Pho and once for a beef rib stew. Both were very good and reasonably priced (for Vegas!). The only weird thing was they gave me parsley instead of basil with the Pho???
The customer service was great and i received my to go order promptly. Definitely a place I would recommend for late night cheap eats.",vseRWjjHvSR2xKpZd-ErTw,0,0,4,CU9BYOkES0rKsPQ50wQI9g

5939232,2012-01-22,1,3j_mvJHnT7nJd7su_7zazw,"I don't know what happened? 2 years ago I used to come to ""Ginseng 3"" all the time. There used to be a very charismatic Korean kid working here who would provide excellent customer service and run the whole restaurant by himself. Also, the food was always good. The Korean BBQ beef was always flavored to perfection, and the Chinese-Korean noodle dishes were better than what you get in Korea Town.  The free appetizers were always of the highest quality because they would make all the variations of kimchee by scratch and not order it premade. 

Yesterday, I came here with my best friend. He flew in from Norway and wanted some Korean food. He had been craving it for years since the only Korean restaurant in North Norway recently went out of business. The moment we stepped in, everything was different. The server was a new guy who was extremely hands off and barely came around. The free appetizers were no longer of high quality and was that generic kimchee you get prepackaged at those Korean markets.  The BBQ beef, which had gone up in price to $25, was now almost flavorless and tasted like they marinated it for only 10minutes and cooked it in a toaster oven. At most all Korean restaurants, they give you enough beef for 3-4 people. This place charges $25 and gives you only enough food to feed one person. For only like $9.99 you can get AYCE Korean Beef at some places and it tastes 100 times better than this.   

The Sushi I ordered tasted like they made it in the morning and refrigerated it.  As we all already know, Sushi is my favorite food in the world. I didn't expect ""great"" sushi from this place, but I did expect mediocre sushi. It wasn't even mediocre! To tell you the truth, I have never had bad sushi from a Korean style sushi restaurant. Korean sushi chefs are very creative and innovative and try to invent new styles and sauces for traditional sushi, which always turns out really really good. So, whenever I want great Sushi, I go offstrip 15 miles to ""Sushi Bomb"" where many of the chefs are Korean. My sushi at ""Ginseng 3"" was the first time I was disappointed while eating Sushi at a Korean style restaurant.   

Even though the service was so bad, my friend still left a giant tip. I don't know why Europeans always leave such big tips even though service sucks?

This was a first for me. It was the first time I ever had Sushi I could not finish, and it was the first time I ever got bad service from a Korean restaurant. Usually Korean restaurants have excellent service. Not this place... Oddly, the restaurant is now busier than it has ever been. Back a couple of years ago when the service and food were actually good, they  never had this many customers. Very strange...

I'm still give it 3-stars because my friend liked this place. I guess most 
Europeans can't tell the difference between bad and good Korean food.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,1,0,3,afSrlj9w81xsr5MWG2Ex4A
