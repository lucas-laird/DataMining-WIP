Here they simply give you a bottled water which yes we were surprised but we figured that's how they give there water. Once we finished got the check and saw they charged us the water we asked the cashier since when is water charged at a restaurant she said it's because you guys asked for a bottled water which we never did that's what they brought out to us she has the damn nerve to say... ""Well you should have returned it"" no sorry no noting she simply kept saying well you should have told them and returned it! We don't mind paying for the 2 water bottles but there will be no next time. The least thing the cashier could have done was apologized but didn't even do that.

3029534,2015-06-06,1,H7liERB1ZJbaIDVcuK16oA,"Why do I always find myself having to defend restaurants on here? Especially in Las Vegas. 
This restaurants food is geared towards a certain region of Mexico and its food. That fact that your quesadilla was flat is because thats the way its made in that region its not some fast food restaurant. The reason your tacos looked like cat food is because that carne is called, ""carne desebrada"" shredded meat. I mean what presentation where you looking for? Flat and plain looking robertos taco shop, or neon colored dell taco food? 

I feel that a lot of Mexican American people born here in Las Vegas really need a fine tuning to their Mexican heritage, or a boot camp course of the Mexican region. Everyone born here lacks a lot of their own culture and they just intermingle and turn everything into mush. I am pretty sure if you invited a Mexican person from Mexico who is visiting they will complain about the quality of the meat. But thats because their meat is fresh from the same day. Americas meat is expected a lot more and put into storage for supermarkets/restaurants. Don't just come in and judge these places for what you have previously ate in these so called, ""Mexican Restaurants"". Las Vegas seriously needs better Mexican food. Most of them suck. 

  Anyway I ordered myself a burrito al pastor. The meat was damn good! I think the only other al pastor meat that beats it, for me, would be from Tacos Azteca on Tropicana and Nellis. It oes down for me like this... Al pastor meat 1) Tacos Azteca, 2) Casa Tlaquepaque, 3) El gordos tacos. So the meat was great! I wish I could have tastes the beans and rice separately, but I did not. I am a big rice fan after all. But that meat really took command in the burrito. That burrito was done quick! I definitely enjoyed the location because the inside really reminded me of a lot of restaurants down there. Just the simple color scheme of it and the design is simple. The name also grabs your attention. The food looks exactly to the pictures.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,5,3,5,jPvAoCdwCc8izu8Ttr15Vw

We don't have many restaurants here in Vegas based of (estilo Guadalajara) besides the torta Ahogada place down on Charleston, today my grandma was craving some birria and we brought here here, now my grandma is known for judging Mexican eateries since she has that (I can make this better at home attitude) she thought food was amazing! Enough said! Don't judge on your first visit come down again! Try a casuela the infamous Guadalajara tequila beverage.

My order was taken immediately and I was given a bowl of complimentary salsa and chips.  I will eat at this place again and try some of their other dishes.

Let me say that right off the bat the server who served us who by the way was the owner was incredibly rude and didn't cater to our needs at all. 

I'll make it short, the food was of cheap quality, almost like serving scraps I want to say. My order was screwed up, took almost an hour to correct and still did not make it right?! They over charged me as well, can you believe that.

After I go pay my bill and the owner again tells me it's CASH ONLY... but not no where in plain sight does it say any where its CASH ONLY. So if you do end up dining there bring cash. I mean everything went wrong, I feel very inconvenienced.  All I wanted was some good eats.

I will definitely, never go back. Also, I will tell all my friends & family how terrible my experience was. You've been warned save yourself the headache.",YeT6b_UcOfeeJHJarDr8yw,4,0,1,kWyujCF0nRfzQoaEIKzG_Q

Goat has a funny taste but he said it was alright. The carnitas plate was good nothing special. Drove 30 mins for the Barboca so that was a let down.

Food is served on very small plates. The service was good and he was on top of things bringing more chip & salsa and keeping the drinks coming.
