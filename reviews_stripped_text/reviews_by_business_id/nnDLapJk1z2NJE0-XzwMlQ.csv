After I left my previous review, management contacted me and asked that I give Gallagher's another visit. They insisted that our experience that night was not typical and asked that we revisit the restaurant after they addressed issues with the staff. 

We returned last night and were, if course, hyper aware to the issues we saw in June.  We wanted a good bottle of wine and our questions were a little outside of the expertise of our waitress. The  sommelier was very patient and when given our price range recommended a bottle at the low end of our range. He was spot-on with the wine. 

A large party was seated next to us and service did not suffer in the least. All in all this was the kind of great service we expect when visiting a nice restaurant. Let's just chalk the June visit up as a bad night that was the exception rather than the rule. 

Service was great and the food is exceptional. We'll be back.",ofyvktJU3HEFpcSKaWEhNA,1,0,5,qB37gD97AcxUFmWJyBChIQ

There was no room at the bar so we just had to wait around. The place was packed on a Friday night so I'm sure a reservation is necessary. 
My wife's heirloom tomato salad really wasn't as the menu described it. My caesar was good.
Both of our entrees were wonderful. My prime rib was bigger than advertised and full of flavor. Her filet and lobster were both to her liking. The lobster was especially good. 
The reason for taking a star away was the overall service. My wife's water glass was frequently empty and we rarely saw our server. Our bread basket was empty and just left on the small 2 top table after the salads were delivered and then taken away.  Either take it away or ask us if we want more. I was never asked if I wanted another drink either, and by the end we figured we'd just head out to the casino to get another one. 
The food was great but even on a busy night neither of us felt like we had a great overall experience, and when we're paying these prices, we simply expect better service, and they fell short.",AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw,0,0,4,xjTwY6kCwg734dVEkRnDVQ

Unfortunately at that time, we didn't have time to try their steak and the bf left vegas disappointed. 

For the holidays, we trekked back to vegas...and a part of me thinks we went back to vegas to satisfy my bf's intrigue of the dry aged NY sirloin. So to appease the bf, we went here. He of course had the NY sirloin, and I had the filet mignon.  And to give Gallagher's credit...the NY sirloin was yummy, but it didn't taste that much different than a wet aged piece-o-meat. 

The filet was small but cooked to perfection. 

Overall, very enjoyable.

35347,2011-09-12,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Sorry to do this but they earned this one star rating.  I'm trying a different steakhouse in Vegas once or twice a month and this one bombed.  Here's the breakdown:

Decor = 2 stars based on my preference for contemporary spaces.  This is old school steakhouse style without any soul.  They need an upgrade.

Bar experience = 3 stars for a decent but not great Martini.  Shaken too much so there were too many chunks of ice.

Crowd = 2 stars.  Tourists of all ages wearing shorts and T shirts.

Overall food = 1 star.  The bread was very stale.  The sauteed spinach was swimming in oil, butter, and garlic so much that I could have been eating any other vegetable without knowing it.  I should note that someone sitting near me ordered the crab legs and raved about them.

The steak = 1 star.  The Filet was bland and tough.  You'll see this in other reviews in yelp as well so you know they are not consistent.

Wine = 1 star for a terrible wine list.  Very few by the glass and selections are basic and uninteresting.  Ever go on a cruise ship?  Similiar selection.

Service = 2 stars.  The hostess was rude AND accidentally cancelled my Opentable reservation instead of confirming it!

The check = $90 for steak, side, martini, and glass of wine

Extras = upset stomach later that night.  I saw a similiar comment on another diner's review on Yelp so beware!

Avoid this place.  With so many options in Vegas, you'd be wasting your time here.",JxuLXhN63Araqd7mdRaNIA,2,0,1,yi0Xq1rKkg4OH7_mxVjrMg

77784,2017-07-25,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Let me start by saying that me and my girlfriend were given a recommendation by one of her co-workers. I came in with great excitement after seeing their dry aged steaks in the window. Pricing appeared at a first glance to be on par for a great evening meal.

We started off with a soup that was delightful according to my girlfriend. If that was the only part of the meal I would probably have given it a 4/5. 

We ordered a Filet Mignon, and the Aged New York Strip. The first cut in my Filet Mignon visually indicated a perfect medium rare, however, the first bite turned out to be a lackluster tasteless piece of meat. The omission of any flavour absolutely? infuriated me. The steak was on the colder side (medium rare should not be cold in the centre, this was pretty damn close).

Much to my disappointment, I have prepared better dinner by purchasing a decent cut at my local butcher in San Francisco or even Whole foods. My girlfriend's New York Strip didn't fair much better. Tough meat that was was not worth the effort.

I don't think of myself as a food snob, but after today I question how I was served such a disaster. If I can make a dish better without sincere effort I feel cheated and therefore have to give a rather disappointing one star.

I sincerly hope some of the other reviewers received something nicer than what we received. If you enjoy steak, please don't go here. You will be so severely disappointed.",RUUe-GIsYBw_C_m_TPKCMw,1,0,1,TmOo1OWW5_4sEx7w986o_w

When I arrived at the restaurant with my guests they did not have a reservation for me although they did not say this directly to me but you could tell as they were trying to decide what to do. They then escorted my party of 6 to a table less than 4 feet from the kitchen area. Now this was not outside the door to the kitchen but we literally felt we were in the kitchen as there were no walls separating out table from the kitchen. If you could imagine trying to have any type of conversation never mind a business conversation when waiters and waitresses were rushing by, plates clanking, and orders being given to the cooks and orders being picked up by the waiters and waitresses. So now this was the atmosphere. In regard to the food I rate it a 7 on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best.. Not bad but not what I expected for the price atmosphere aside as this did not relate to the quality of the food. I travel to Las Vegas quite frequently on business and there are a lot of high quality restaurants to chose from. I'm sorry to say that based on my experiences this time (my first time to Gallagher's) I would not be coming back.

Upon our arrival we were kindly greeted and escorted to our small table in the far back. The feel of the restaurant was semi- business casual/slightly romantic. Our waiter took about 15 minutes to come back with the wine menu. By the time he came back, we were ready to order our wine, appetizers, bread and meal.

Appetizer: The bread was very hard- may have been stale, but we were hungry. The butter did most of the job. Nothing too special. We also ordered 4 oysters $3.50/ea. Very small, but fresh and tasty. The oysters were accompanied w/ half a lemon and a teeny-tiny tabasco sauce bottle. 

Entrees: Boyfriend ordered the dry aged New York Sirloin $40 (sides must be ordered separately). The steak was medium rare, just as he ordered it. It was perfect! Full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Did not need any type of sauce. I think it was one of the best pieces of steaks I've had, but boyfriend's had better. He ordered steamed broccoli ($8) and the colossal baked potatoe ($8). The broccoli was soft, tender and delicious. It didn't need salt, butter or anything. It dissolved in your mouth. According to boyfriend, the baked potatoe was nothing special. He could've gone without ordering it. Both sides were very large portions, each side is enough to fill at least two people. I, on the other hand, ordered the cesar salad ($8.95) as my main dish because I knew I would enjoy a piece of boyfriend's steak. The salad was fresh and good. It had shaved parmesan cheese and home made ceasar dressing (at least it tasted homemade).

I would definitely return to this place. We had excellent, attentive service and a great meal. We didn't think the meal was too expensive either. Our total bill was slightly over $100.

Anyways... I agree with a few of the other reviews - this is not prime it taste like USDA at best - the meat is tuff and not flavor full & once again the meat was not cooked correctly (2 steaks ordered the same and 1 cooked to order the other not)

The service was spectacular, 5 seconds after we were seated, our drink orders were taken and the menu was explained to us. All portions of the meal were perfectly timed and the servers worked with me to get us to our 930pm show on time.

As for food. We got the seared diver scallops as an appetizer, caesar salad as the second dish, and the dry aged new york strip and cowboy ribeye steaks with the bernaise sauce. Sides are ala carte and served separately, but I ordered the creamed spinach and grilled asparagus. Everything tasted great, but the steak portions are no joke, the pictures on this page do them no justice. I barely finished half of my steak and had to take the rest home. If I could go back I would have eliminated one of the sides from my order and possibly even the caesar salad and I would have still been full. Gallagher's steaks seemed a little tougher than what I was used to, perhaps it was because they were dry aged, or maybe because they were just that thick of a cut.

We wanted to have steak before leaving Vegas. Looking at our options, Gallagher's seems to offer the best value for quality. Made a reservation to make sure we got in on time, as we had a show to catch. Definitely the way to go, since we saw a group turned away just before we got seated.

Had:
Aged Top Sirloin - the aging sure did enhance the flavors of this steak. The beef is the highlight here. They don't try to cover it up.
Cowboy Rib Eye - Big, tender and juicy slab of beef. 
Both were perfectly cooked to order. We didn't eat any steak for a few weeks following this meal because we didn't want to follow up such good steak with something worse.

We also ordered the steak fries. These were great as well. Crunchy on the outside, hot, soft potato on the inside. The ketchup, omg the ketchup! Delicious ketchup with a kick. Our guess is that it's infused with truffle oil and possibly some roasted jalapeno as well. Whatever it is, it lifted the fries beyond 'just another basket of fries'.

Our waiter was attentive throughout. 

We found out that there was an emergency in the kitchen (saw paramedics coming in), yet the only tell-tale sign was that our food took a little longer to come out. They  run a smooth operation.

It is the Gallagher's Steakhouse which their NY location has just celebrated their 81 years of operation. We went to have dinner last night and left with a very delicious and happy experience! We started off with one appetizer to share. It was the chilled gazpacho. We both liked it as it is very refreshing to start off a meal. We ordered the house-aged New York Sirloin bone-in weighted 18oz and the 24oz Porterhouse. Both steaks were huge as expected. The steaks were cooked perfectly to our preference of medium rare. It is not easy to cook the big steak to perfection. My sirloin was so thick, but very juicy and packed with flavors. The side Yukon gold potato puree was very velvety smooth. The porterhouse that my husband had was delicious and juicy and tender. They gave you the bone marrow with crostini which is special. The side sauteed green beans were very good and tasted sweet. We finished more than half of the steak and took the rest home. But we still ordered the dessert. If you've been there, you will know how special their dessert menu. The special effect when they opened the menu....not going to say what it is or else it will take away that surprise for readers that have never been there. As recommended by the server, we ordered the toffee pudding. We normally just ok with toffee, but this was very different. A very warm moist toffee cake with toffee sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was just the right sweetness. We ordered coffee with dessert and it came in a silver pot and we both like the coffee to be that hot.

The cranberry bread had a good idea behind it but end of day it was cold. We both ordered wedge salads. The wedge salad was flat and uninspired. The lettuce yellow and the blue cheese dressing watery. Fast forward to dinner I ordered the filet mignon & she ordered the rib eye steak. We ordered macaroni & cheese with asparagus for sides.. 

The filet mignon was just beautiful. It was tasty and cooked to perfection. In fact the filet mignon & our sodas is why I am giving this steakhouse two stars.. 

The rib eye on the other hand was just an atrocity. The first rib eye was remarkably overcooked and rubbery. We then we waited another 15 minutes for another rib eye that was still tough. The manager brought the new rib eye personally and apologized but the steak was still a let down. We both tried a cut. It was tough. The macaroni and cheese was undercooked. The noodles in particular were hard. The asparagus had a slightly bitter taste. We added in two sodas and the bill was $170. I never mind to spend hard earned money on great food but this experience was mediocre at best. This was just not worth the time or effort..

533507,2011-09-07,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Gallagher Steakhouse is located within the bowels of New York, New York casino. This restaurant features dry aged beef and their legendary Gallagher hospitality. Their signature 2 inch, bone-in top sirloin steak that has been dry aged for 30 days is one of the restaurant's top sellers. It should be noted that Gallaghers was once privately owned in New York until it became a franchise. Reservations are encouraged, especially if you plan to dine at around 7pm to 8pm. A dinner evening spent in this restaurant can cost you a minimum of $200 for two people. 

Overview: I have visited at this restaurant a couple of times in the past several months and I was not overly impressed by the experience. The service was good, but the restaurant relied too heavily on its name to generate business. However, in fairness, it is still an above average steakhouse. Just a side note. If you do not know how to distinguish or cannot taste the difference between a 30 day dry aged beef and a regular cut of beef, then save your money and go to some other steakhouse like Outback. It will be cheaper for you and you'll won't be disappointed. 

PROS: The restaurant offers dry aged beef, quality service, and can be easily found in the casino. The food is plentiful and an entree can be easily shared between two people. 

CONS: The restaurant is really close to the casino floor so the dining atmosphere is somewhat disrupted with the gambling action outside. Additionally, this steakhouse does not have a restroom of its own. You will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino restroom nearby. 

Restaurant Class: Upper-Middle 

Food: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The steaks are well prepared and cooked to order. Additionally, a couple of their steak entrees are large enough to be shared by two people. More importantly, the dry aged steaks do not disappoint, especially if you are a steak connoisseur. The sides and soups are somewhat a different matter. The sides are nondescript and the soups tend to run on the salty side. 

Atmosphere: (3 out of 5 stars) The ambiance and the genre falls in line with the Gallagher's theme in New York. It is lively and professional. However, that atmosphere tends to be ruined by the gaming action just outside the restaurant. And unless you are seated in a secluded and private room of the restaurant, you will not feel like you are in a premium New York steakhouse. 

Cleanliness: (3.5 out of 5 stars) The staff does a good job in keeping the tables and the dining area clean. However, because Vegas allows patrons to smoke in casinos, there is a very faint smell of cigarette smoke in the linens. 

Service: (4 out of 5 stars) The staff is professional and attentive. However, if you dining with a large party (6 people or more), the service level may diminish a bit; especially if you happen to be dining during a peak hour. Overall, there service level is consistent with the Gallagher's name. 

Restroom Facilities: (3 out of 5 stars) The restaurant does not have a restroom of its own. If you do need to use the facilities, you will need to exit the restaurant and use the casino's restrooms. Other than that, the casino usually does a good job of keeping the facilities clean and well stocked.",a03-rqifdYor-QAoOdo0cw,2,0,3,lu5iJVu6MfxtgiOgubys3w

Gallagher's deserves it's #1 rating on Yelp because it's that good.  Great food and great service.

So we were really disappointed when our dinner was not real good and took nearly 3 hours. We had wine and appetizers to start, a ""seafood celebration"" that everyone loved ( $38.00 per person but worth it) and then we ordered our main courses. We all had steaks and it took nearly 45 minutes from when we ordered them to when they showed up.. The restaurant had cleared out so it wasn't an issue of being overly busy, when the steaks arrived they were all barely lukewarm and the sides were basically cold. It was pretty obvious that they had somehow sat for a period of time before being brought to our table. I mentioned to the manager on duty and his solution after having to ""think it over "" was to first offer us new meals ( it was past midnight by then so no one was much interested in waiting around for another round) and then offered to bring us some desserts and after dinner drinks ( more food and drink but not offering to do anything about getting a lousy meal) ..

There are plenty of venues to satisfy the raunchy-party side of you.  The night life in Vegas is just phenomenal.  Not too far off, if your disposition is in the spectrum of the more relaxing, affordable, family friendly experience, Vegas can accommodate you as well.  (Sadly) My recent trip to Vegas was closer to the latter.  

While in Vegas, I definitely wanted to have a nice steak dinner but didn't want to pay a premium either.  There are plenty of steakhouses in Vegas associated with famous chefs and they are not cheap.  For some YELPERS they swear it's the best steak they ever had.  Believe me, I get it.  When it comes to steak and sushi, you follow the golden rule, don't skimp.  After all, which would you rather eat, steak at Denny's or Ruth's Chris?  You get my point.   No offense to Denny's btw.    

So how do I square the relaxing-affordable side with wanting a great steak dinner?  Simple, hidden in New York New York hotel, you'll find a gem of a steakhouse named Gallagher's.  This steakhouse is both understated and refined and I'm happy to admit, they cook a damn good steak.  I had the dry aged rib-eye with sautéed spinach and for dessert - key lime pie.  It was the perfect ending to a great meal.  I won't go into details of my dining experience except to say I was very impressed and the service was impeccable.  

Yup, in Vegas there's a steakhouse for everyone but I'm glad I went to Gallagher's.  My wallet was glad too.",JjYGxGZRN8kN1K7pOhxL-g,6,2,5,UyoJr4jNZCDvs94gXsv6RA

How many times have you had steak that you can cut with a fork?  Yes, a fork...not a knife.  Well, Gallagher's serves such steaks and they are UNBELIEVABLE!   

I always order the surf and turf.  I don't care how much it costs because I can never decide between their amazing steak and lobster.  I like to order my steak (fillet Mignon) butterflied medium at Gallagher's.  It always seems to come out just perfect that way.  

Their side dishes are not the best, in my opinion which is too bad but their main entrees more than make up for their shortcomings.  They have pretty good salads, too.  I like the spinach salad with light dressing.

We had a last minute reservation for 7:15, and were seated promptly in the very back room, tables packed in and noise level was like a bar.  We could barely have a conversation, which really detracts from any sort of dinner.  Our server was nice enough, but the guy filling the water and bringing out the bread had a really bad attitude.  He threw the bread on our table, knocking one of the knives off the bread plate.  Brought our water, when I said ""thank you"" he just walked away, he appeared to be like that with every table around us.  Then a lady taking pictures came over and asked if we wanted our photo taken for a fee.....um no.  I don't like being solicited while at a dinner that is going to cost upwards of $200, the first time she came around I was polite, but then she came around again, that time I was not so polite.  If I want a pic taken I can get out my phone or camera for free!

I ordered a couple of cocktails, they were fine, but could have had a little more alcohol in them.  I am paying $11 for a drink, I expect to taste the booze!  We had the king crab cocktail which was good.  My husband ordered the Cowboy steak medium rare, it came out almost raw in spots.  He likes them very pink and bloody, but this was just plain raw, he gave me a piece and I could not even eat it, he found a piece I could try and it wasn't even that good.  I ordered the fish they had that night, I think it was snapper and that was good.  After tasting his steak I was so glad I got the fish instead!  I have a general rule that if I am at a steakhouse I order steak, but in this case, I think I made the right choice.   For sides we got the broccoli with cheese sauce which was good, but for the amount of sauce that was on them I should have just ordered the plain broccoli as there was hardly any sauce on them.  We also got the mashed potatoes which were good.   

I wish we would have just gone to Delmonico, which in my opinion cannot be beat and is our go to steakhouse while in Vegas, or even The Palm which you can count on for good service and food.

Had a reservation but they were able to seat us when we got there 1/2 an hour prior. The customer service was phenomal, our waiter was so attentive and checked on us frequently (but not stalker frequently).  He was really knowledable about the steaks (I wanted to know which was the softest.)  I ordered a lemond drop which was the most fabulous lemon drop I've ever had.  I ordred a New York steak, my husband ordered the Cowboy Sirloin or something like that.  I should technically have given them 4 starts since they mixed my medium with his medium rare, but that being said within minutes of us letting them know, the manager was at our table apologizing for the mistake (they took my m.rare and cooked it to med) and he offered us each a dessert on the house!! Like I said, phenominal customer service.  I would definitely go back to this place.  Great drink, great food, great people!

Gallagher's was definitely the best option at NYNY so we didn't mind at all.

Dry aged beef lines the front of the restaurant, enticing the naive passerby to come check out their selection of prime cut steaks and chops.  Vintage pictures of stars and athletes line every bit of wall space that the moderate sized restaurant has to offer.  The relatively low ceilings and minimal windows create the appearance of a classic New York style supper house.  

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation so I decided to jump on the shoe shining seat and have a good old fashioned hand shoe shine.  He made quick work on my shoes and I walked off with a seemingly brand new pair of kicks.  We walked in and it was surprisingly pretty crowded for a Sunday night.  We sat down near the rear of the back room, which sounds bad but it's actually pretty nice and quiet there and also it was near the door that leads to the restroom in the hall so it turned out to be a good spot.  

Our server quickly greeted us and brought water and bread to our table.  We were torn on entrees and she was very eager to offer up some suggestions from her personal picks.  We agreed on the Ribeye and Rack of Lamb with sides of jalapeno mash and mushroom medley.  We also ordered the Crab Cocktail to start us off along with a bottle of a nice Chilean Red.

Crab Cocktail - Basically 3 sections of King Crab served with lemon and cocktail sauce.  No work necessary since it was sliced in half lengthwise for us.  Delicious.

Mushroom Medley - Great earthy side.  Not much to this so order if you love mushrooms.

Jalapeno Mashed Potatoes - Cheesy potatoes with a slight kick (very slight)   Salted perfectly and not too much cheese.  

Ribeye - For me, a ribeye is a ribeye so unless you overcook it, the only thing left is the size of the cut and this cut was huge.  Served on the bone, this is not for the feint of heart.

Rack of Lamb - The star of the show.  Served medium rare is the key to perfection.  Basic seasonings along with a good sear makes lamb one of the best cuts around.  No different here.  Soooo good.  None of that mint jelly mess or paper booties needed.

We had lots of leftovers so we took some to our room to store in ice.  We also took some olive bread as well.  Great leftover lunch the next day.

We had a great meal here for a not-so-expensive price tag.  It was really good.  We would like to try some other cuts the next time we happen to be around here.

Oh, and there's a lady that walks around taking pictures if you would like.  She comes back with like sets of pictures that she prints out and places in photo folders.  I felt like it was high school grad or prom or something.   We got to choose 8x10 or 5x7 or wallet size.  Lol.   We ended getting just one picture in 8x10.  Felt bad but she shouldn't have printed them all out without asking what we wanted first.  For better profit margin, get a digital photo frame and show all the pictures to the customer so save money on ink and paper.  Nothing wasted except battery life.

Been here for a few times and most recently after a tradeshow.  It seriously is one of my favorite steakhouse... anywhere

I always get the dry-aged New York strip sirloin, done medium rare.  It's an amazing piece of steak.  Must be around 20-24oz, it is just thick.  It's always grilled perfectly.  That first bite, when the fat from the steak just melts in your mouth... is just the best.  I never get any sauces or condiments to go with the steak since I think they season the steak so well that nothing is needed.  Having grilled with the bone gives it that extra flavor too.  Better than any steak I've had anywhere.

As for sides, that's the only downer.  All the veggies are pretty much sauteed and drenched in butter.  It's absolutely delicious but at the same time... it just might be too much.  Mashed potatoes are nothing special and mac & cheese isn't that cheesy to me.  Caesar salad is big pieces of romaine lettuce with grated parmesan reggiano.  Nothing special but the croutons is crazy good.  I can eat a bowl full.  Also got to try the fried calamari this time around.  Pretty damn delicious, especially with the marinara sauce.  But really, if you come to a steakhouse, the only thing that matters is the steak!

Located in NYNY, the steakhouse looks like a classic steakhouse from NY with the decor.  You would think it would be loud since it's right next to the casino floor but its more from the patrons that are dining and the high ceiling.  Make reservations, cause it's not big at all and it can get full fast.

If you want a lot of steak, order the Cowboy steak.  It is huge, just huge.",LyrAjv8V6HWkceuTB4Xtkw,0,0,5,vTYfuOyjQZDqOjOwP20jhA

The service was as close to perfect as I've ever seen. Dishes appeared and were whisked away very promptly, often without anyone noticing. The wait staff responded promptly to requests, even in the middle of a course service. They all had a smile and seemed thrilled to take care of our group.

The bar service was shockingly wonderful. The bloody mary was so good we returned the next day for another round. The wait staff was able to give very good suggestions to those members of our group who weren't sure what to order.

Another friend and I both ordered Porter House medium. Mine was done right, but my friend's was on the well done side. The difference was noticeable visibly. My view about steak is that while the meat quality and preparation does matter, the cooking process is most important.

i was finally able to come here after a marathon hunt for creamed spinach.  and we knew that only steakhouses would be a sure shot to get some... 

the place is casual, its dead in the middle of the food area of the NYNY.  so dont expect to completely cupcake - it is a bit busy and noisy.  i can look beyond this no problem...

we shared the cowboy bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, whipped yukon potatoes, caramelized onions, and a mushroom medley.

the steak was fantastic - nothing short of a great cut and cooked perfectly MEDIUM.  the meat was tender, juicy, and cooked on a well-seasoned grill.  that makes a huge difference in my book, a well seasoned grill.  

the yukon's were great, maybe a lil too whipped for my liking, since i like them to be a little thick.  the flavor was good, nothing that i would make it a point to order again.

creamed spinach was good.  it lacked salt, which to some may be a good thing since you can add some (rather than too much and be SOL), but i rarely grab a salt shaker, unlessi absolutely have to.  and this time, i had to.

We sent one back because it was well done and we asked for a medium.  It came out right away, no waiting an hour for them to cook another, I'm sure they 'borrowed' someone elses to get ours out quickly, which is nice.  But, that wasn't cooked much less than the first one. :(

The steak was pretty tough.   The lobster tail was a little over cooked.

If you're not used to going to really nice places, (My Mom ate with us and she isn't used to going out to places like this) and she had a great time and didn't know the difference.   If you know the difference, you'll probably want to go elsewhere.

We spent in the neighborhood of $500 for 4 people.  It should have been the best quality for that price.    Now, we didn't eat the cheap stuff either.  2 of us had the surf & turf with the lobster tail.  and a couple of glasses of wine.

Went here with a group of 8 after seeing reviews on yelp for a reasonably priced steakhouse in Vegas. $45 a steak isn't bad at all for these parts. Sat by the kitchen which means we saw the meat go into the broiler, coming out perfectly charred - got us excited! Our waiter was great, managing to find humour in our indecisiveness. He recommended a great cab sav at only $55 a bottle (I say only because the lowest price starts at about $45 and goes up to.... well... you don't want to know). We decided to order appy's for the table and paired off to split some prime ribs, NY strip steaks - my BF and I decided to split the Cowboy ribeye (our waiter's recommendation and favorite steak). 

The crab cakes were awesome; the scallops were gigantic and cooked perfectly. The clam chowder was a bit too salty for our taste  - everyone at the table had a bowl.  Then the highlight, the steaks. We were given an additional complimentary prime rib, courtesy of the chef! Each one was perfectly cooked except for one NY Steak was medium instead of medium rare - but no matter because we couldn't even finish every plate (we did wonder if the comped prime rib was because of the overcooked NYsteak...).  The crown jewel, our Cowboy ribeye. Oh my god, i was so happy we went with this. It has the tenderness and fattiness of the prime rib, but the charred and tastiness of the NY strip. I was so full but just couldn't let even one bit go to waste. 

One steak is definitely enough to share between two people if you're having appies and soups like us. We left with a full stomach and a smile fueled by gluttony on our faces. Definitely will be back next time we're in town.",L2QF06Y0Noa97Jfly2VT-g,0,0,5,XDxmMv0koD7ZuVLWznYHCw

This past trip my brother and I finally broke down and decided to give this place a try. This might be because we'd really built up our expectations, but the end feeling we were both left with was, ""Huh - well that was good, but really nothing special.""

We were seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by a very friendly and helpful waitress. She introduced us to the menu, talked about their different cuts, and took drink orders. While sipping on our manhattans, we placed our meal orders, both ordering the same thing - clam chowder, their signature NY strip, and the garlic mashed potatoes.

The clam chowder was spectacular. Thick, creamy, chunky. The mashed potatoes were good, but a bit too whipped for my liking. The steak - the signature wet and dry aged steak - was, well, tough and not all that flavorful. The waitress did recommend the ribeye (saying it was her favorite), and hindsight being what it is I'm thinking we should have listened to her.

There are many better places in Vegas than this one, including one of my favorites (Mon Ami Gabi). The place is decent, but for the price you can do much better elsewhere.",Eg1T--knapihoR2GV-Dj_w,3,0,3,D04kMP02Fq2ju5INsqkIMg

Came to Vegas for a week (yes, a full week!) with my girlfriends. We wanted a nice dinner out after having grazed our way through the resort buffet, breakfasts that came complete with margaritas, pizza, and so much mexican food we were starting to say ""ese"" at the end of sentences. 

Gallagher's appeared to fit the bill, although the raw slabs of meat in the case at the entrance are a tad off-putting. I know that they are designed to show you what you're getting, but I'm one of those ""ignorance is bliss"" people when it comes to eating animals. 

Nevertheless, we came in, were seated immediately -- side note: next to the kitchen, like practically IN THE KITCHEN. I have never been so much IN a kitchen in my life. We were about 5 feet from the cooks and the grills. I think it was intentional: along the same vein of the exposed butcher case, so you can see what you're getting and where it's coming from, but it was distracting.

Our waiter was very good. Made good recommendations, very professional and courteous. My mojito was excellent. I had a seafood sampler appetizer plate as my meal -- it had crabcake, shrimp, and calamari. The crabcakes were TO DIE for. The shrimp were good, and the calamari was fine, but not the best I've ever had. I wish I just got crabcakes. So delicious. I sampled some of my girlfriends steak and potatoes and they were just out of this world. 

Service was superb throughout the meal; the servers came and cleared our plates quickly and then used that fancy schmancy scraper thing to clear the table of crumbs and such (I love that thing!).

I would ABSOLUTELY 100% recommend anyone on the strip have a meal here. I know I will be back my next round in Sin City!",mCyH2QxkDx5cDtulJMzwyw,1,1,5,nzc3yJ81h4jlyOQpr0Z5bw

My last experience was less then subpar but Brisa and Shepard from Gallagher's wanted to make it right and invited us back as their special guests to ensure everything was to our liking. We were first greeted by Jocelyn at the front desk and she walked us over to our table. She was very kind. John our server came by to greet us and filled us in on the daily special and took our drink order. Rafael was on it as well, he came by to make sure our waters were filled and cleaned up any remnants that we left on the table from the bread crumbs. The bread there is phenomenal. I try not to eat bread but when I do I will eat it at Gallagher's. 

We started with the Shrimp and Grits appetizer. If there is one appetizer you order and you like shrimp, then this is the appetizer for you. The shrimp is succulent and cooked perfectly. We then moved on to salads. I had to go with the beet salad. Beets are great for the liver and the beets are roasted to perfection and they do not skimp on the beets. Wife loves the hearts of palm salad there. Then on to the steaks. The NY aged steaks are the way to go. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked just the way I like it. The prices of the steaks are not that expensive when compared to the plethora of steak houses around Vegas. It seems like every hotel has their own signature steak house and they offer pretty much the same thing but the thing that sets Gallagher's apart is the nostalgia and that piece of NYC you would only find there. 

The sides were amazing! The asparagus were about the size of bananas. Talk about asparagus on steroids. They were pumped up. I also ordered the chipotle cheesy Yukon gold mashed potatoes. I didn't want to share them with my wife. At first I told her they were the worst thing I ever tasted but she knew I was lying because my nose grew and I had a huge smile on my face after trying them. Do yourself a favor and order a side of mushrooms as well. 

Through the years Gallagher's has been a regular in our rotation when visiting Vegas. We always receive top notch service and the food never leaves us in doubt. All of the employees are wonderful. I wish we could eat there more often but it's great to have it as a special place for us to visit. If you are in the area just stop by and try something. You will not be disappointed and if you are I am sure they will make it right. Thanks again to the staff at Gallagher's and to Brisa and Shepard for making sure the meal was to our liking. It was nice to also see Roxanna who goes around to take photos. She took our photo 10 years ago after we had a post wedding dinner party there. We decided to go with another round of photos and told her we would see her in another 10 years. And thanks again to John for wonderful service.

Such a huge disappointment, for a $50+ steak, go spend your money somewhere else in Las Vegas because they obviously did not care about us.

The good- 

The decor is really nice, festive but not over-the-top, it wasn't distracting. I can't say that it's much like modern NYC, but it is very similar to many older and lovely San Francisco establishments. The aged steak was very good and worth the money. However, it does come on the bone and has fatty portions, so if that bothers you, please just order the filet. They are very similar in price and I find that there is no making up for those preferences. You will enjoy an un-aged filet much more than an aged new york strip.

The asparagus was excellent, it is so often overcooked.

The roasted garlic with the steak was a nice touch.

The medium- 

The salads were a good size but in faux fine dining tradition, it is up to the diner to wrestle with enormous leaves and hunks of lettuce. Perhaps this is to your taste, but as I actually wanted to finish the salad, being served whole leaves in copious dressing was unfortunate. I ordered a Caesar, the dressing was nice but for $9 I expected something a little more robust. No anchovies were harmed in the making of my salad. My partner ordered the wedge and gave up after a third, although he liked it.

I was not impressed by the hollandaise. For the price ($2 additional) and quantity it was acceptable, but the white vinegar was very pronounced and the sauce was thin. They attempted to correct the acidity with shallots, it didn't really help. The consistency was fine otherwise.

The wine list was decent but a little spare on by-the-glass. Bottle prices are average but by-the-glass was a bit more expensive than similarly priced restaurants. The pour size is standard, about 5 ounces. For a party of 3 or more, I'd just order a bottle.

The bad-

Very misleading reservations. The restaurant was in no way full at the time requested but they forced us to reserve at an earlier time. 

Guidance about ordering is lacking and the staff and kitchen may be at war. Although still lovely and tender, it was the single most done medium-rare I've ever had in my life, including my own occasional barbecue-related sins.

Did not try-

The beer or cocktails. I didn't even see a drinks menu other than the wine list.

Overall-

Good food, a touch pricy, and I'm not sure how much I believe their schtick about aging. The location is not thrilling, it's in a particularly irritating part of New York New York. Wait-staff was very nice, hostesses less so. Worth a trip, but skip the soup/salad.",-SzrrPNRVnPBwx3VHrbYfg,1,0,4,R1A2OSLUX-ks-4ma_5w8kQ

The first thing they served was the complimentary bread. The cranberry bread was bomb. My roommate and I didn't want to stuff ourselves with bread before the main dish comes out, so we didn't have much. As for appetizer, we got the portobello stuffed mushroom and caprese salad. I'm love mushrooms in general, so it was amazing for me. The portobello stuffed mushroom was really big considering that it was an appetizer. I want to say it's the size of a palm of a hand. The caprese salad was really good and different than other caprese I have tried at other restaurant. The caprese was extra soft and fluffy.

As for our main dish, I got the filet mignon and my roommate got the $60 porterhouse (since it was her birthday). We both wanted our steak to be cooked medium rare, but when the food came out, I wanted to say it was a little more on the rare side. We didn't mind so it was okay. As for my filet mignon, it was perfect! I thought the size was pretty small (in the..circumference terms?) but it was super fat and tall..if that makes sense. My roommate's porterhouse was crazy!..in a good way. She enjoyed it so much. But I wouldn't recommend for a girl/woman to order it unless she has a big appetite. It was bigger than an average woman's hand. My roommate couldn't finish it but she said her's was very juicy and fun to it.

So for our steaks, sides weren't included so we had to order separately. Each side ranges from $7-10 if I can remember. We got the cooked asparagus and creamed spinach. The asparagus only comes with 5 pieces, but they are huge and fat. As for the creamed spinach, it was enough portion for the two of us. I just thought it was a little too creamy for me.

The service at this restaurant was great! Our server was super duper nice. My roommate and I were actually going to order more, but our server was nice enough to save my wallet and stop us. The food came out really fast, so that's a plus. 

We didn't get any dessert because both of us were way too full, but I did see the table next to me had some key lime pie. So maybe I'll try that next time. This restaurant is definitely on the pricey side, but I do give it a five star because the food was worth every penny.

It's probably a 2.5 in my mind but I guess I would admit this was probably one of my least favorite steak houses i've been to in terms of their steaks. 

Bread was served cold and you are given sour dough and raisin/nut bread. I prefer the raisin/nut bread. 

Prime rib : quite expensive for 45? dollars. I might as well go to summit house and get a $30 prime rib and they are known for it and it is bigger. It tasted so-so. 

Filet mignon - To me, it was just a meh steak. I don't know how to describe it to you if you had better steaks before. It didn't stand out and the sauces that you pay for just covers the meat taste to it.

Dry-age rib eye- the best one but still didn't stand it. It's not as tender as other steaks as it is a rib eye given that you get a better taste to the meat. Would recommend it if you do choose to dine at Gallagher.

The sides- Mac and cheese was terrible, didn't have a good taste to it and was a bit too cheesy in a weird way and really overwhelm your palette. 

Mushroom - my friend and I both thought it tasted bitter which was really odd to us...
 
Potato puree- it was decent. I feel like you can't really messed up it too much. Obviously steak and potato puree is usually a must. 

Cream spinach - my favorite one. I don't know what they did with it but I actually really like the taste to it. I guess they add some kind of heavy cream that made it better to my tasting?

Regardless, I would take my money to OBVIOUSLY Craft steak at MGM or SW at Wynn. The service was still great and he was really helpful and kind towards our party. 

I would kinda rank Gallagher and Prime in the same tier in a way just cause Prime is way too expensive but I'm sorry Gallagher you be getting 2 from me.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,3,1,2,2z80BCKbd_vfG9HFc1FkeQ

Secondly - any nice place that allows reservations - make them prior to your trip - you get much better seating. 

So, when my bf (at the time) and I were planning to take a trip to vegas - he recommended this restaurant. I noticed that they were on Open Table - so I made those reservations a few weeks in advance. 

We also planned to see Zumanity at the NYNY as well - to save on the travel time. 

So we arrive right on time - despite the use of cab/monorail/walking. Perfect. We get seated in the back area where it's considerably quieter than nearer the casino area. 

Prior to arriving here, we had some fresh oysters at the Oyster Bar at Harrah's -  a little ""hidden"" gem amongst the smoke filled casino.

So when seated - we check out the menu. I decide to eat the center cut Filet Mignon and a side of 4 cheese Mac & cheese, and I believe my bf decided on the NY steak. Both were aged and tender tender tender.The bread was crusty and just delicious. 

The service here was perfect. Waiter was very helpful and extremely patient. He checked on us very few times - and only helped us when needed. It irks me when waiters check every 15 minutes - leave me alone. 

Sure, the steaks here are pricy - but considering the aging process - it's well worth it. It's vegas - and good eats are all around. 

When we return to Vegas - we are going to return to Gallagers. Yum Yum Yum.",yxZXoPPQg8oXu5My-BRfBA,1,2,5,H5Bp1QLrZhvqe3mFoNUbhg
1547414,2015-07-01,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I have enjoyed many a steak in this great town known as Las Vegas, and each and every one was delicious beyond belief. It really (for me) boils down to the consumer experience. You're paying a premium price you should expect premium service. And the team behind the bar at Gallaghers did not disappoint. More specifically Shaun. The man, a tall drink of water and was without a shadow of a doubt sculpted in the likeness of Michaelangelo's David. The Adonis of a man stands about 6'6 with a personality that was larger than life. His initial greeting was warmer than Phoenix in July, and I felt as if I just stepped into the house of an old friend. He oozed personality and always had a poignant point about anything that was topical. Weather it be the latest sports scores, current events, or 9/11 conspiracies, Shaun was always on point and informative. Some might call him a ""jack of all trades"" or a ""renaissance man"" if you will, me (after the one visit), I call him a friend.  Let's not forget the other two fine gentlemen behind the bar. Diminutive in stature but not ""short"" on personality either. I think the shortest of the twos name was Gary. Standing (what seemed to be) a mere 4'11 was surely channeling his personal idol with his Gomer Pyle hair cut. And the man only known by a letter G stood a towering 5'2. He seemed to be the strong silent type.  This was by far the best experience I've ever had at a bar, steak house, or Vegas all together.

Excellent food there. 

The service here though was terrible. Actually, I'll change that to our waiter was terrible. He was trying to be very sneaky and add extra charges to our bill to make it higher.

1565342,2011-01-14,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I believe this was the best steak I've ever had. I told my girlfriend that the only two things I *had* to do during our stay in Vegas was hit the buffet at the Bellagio and have a steak at a fancy, classy steakhouse. The steak was the highlight of our trip.

We made reservations, and arrived 15 minutes early but were seated immediately even though we were prepared to wait at the bar. I would have preferred slightly more room between tables and a little less noise, but otherwise I felt the place was very comfortable. Our waiter was very courteous. I wore a sports jacket/tie and my gf wore a LBD, but it looks like the dress code isn't that strict. Still, I'm glad we took the classy route. You can relax and go slightly more casual if you want, but if you want to dress nicer like we did you'll fit in, too.

I ordered the signature sirloin, and I can't imagine why anybody would get any other steak. The filet may be more tender, but it couldn't possibly have flavor like this and believe me it was VERY tender. I ordered mine medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. The edges were just a bit caramelized, the inside was a nice even pinkish-red. I love how they keep it on the bone, it really enhances the flavor. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop. I expected a single double-thick chop but instead it was two thinner chops, but it was still very tender. I had a taste and the sauce was a little sweet for my taste, but it was excellent. My gf loved it. She asked our waiter a question about what fruit it was made with, and he knew the answer without any hesitation at all (apricot I think?). VERY good waiter. We shared our sides, the potato certainly lived up to its ""colossal"" billing and the asparagus was nice and crisp, although I could have done without the heavy hollandaise sauce.

I ordered a wine by the glass. At the end of my second glass as we were getting ready to leave, I noticed there was a wine sediment at the bottom of my glass. I was impressed with the service and I'm sure if I'd noticed it when I started drinking it, they would have fixed it for me. So I don't hold it against them. My gf was very happy with her cocktail.

1642764,2016-11-22,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"This place is OK overall. 
Trusted Yelp to find a good steak place for my friends birthday in Vegas without breaking the bank so we made a reservation here.
Although we made reservations in advance, we were sat at the kitchen. For a place that is as snobby as the staff were, I was surprised that they even had kitchen seating? I don't mind a nice personal view into the kitchen but this kitchen was a bit noisy and carefree on the fact that customers were placed there. So the ambiance of this place was not very impressive.

The food: They had the bone in filet as their special but they didn't work too much on giving it a good price to convince me that I wanted a meal that was preselected in sides and seasoning. I could build my own filet with double the seasonings for cheaper so I did that instead. My friends had bone in NY Steaks and another filet with king crab oscar.
The best meal was the king crab oscar filet. It did add a twist to the meat that brought out a different flavor to the entire meal. I have to agree with our waiter and state that it should always be served this way. As for my meal, I tried the peppercorn and onions. It was meh overall. The steak, of course, was good but only because it was a filet. The meat is already what it was and it being Gallagher's didn't add anything special to it so i will not give credit to the restaurant in this case.
Overall, I would say it was a 4 star quality if it was based on the food itself.

Price: it was about average to be expected for a steakhouse. It was not obscene but it was not cheap. The perception of price is used in this establishment. An old marketing trick to assure that the hit to the wallet isn't visually grandiose; all items are a la carte. So you buy the items piece by piece. I enjoy the ""option"" feeling but don't think it's a fair trade value for those options in this case.

Service: Now this is where the stars fall off. Did you think I rated it poorly because I snobbishly didn't want to sit in the kitchen? oh no, I enjoy lots of different experiences and would have flipped a story to make the birthday girl happy sitting there as if we exclusively saw what goes on back stage. No, the service was extremely poor (overall). It started good actually, The reception were very professional, clean, and helpful. Loved it! The waiter was friendly and showed a lot of effort.
He came by and spoke to us, explained meals, specials, and drinks. As the night progressed, we saw less and less of him as well as not be able to ask anyone else for assistance. We started to wait for drink orders for over 15 minutes with no one in sight. So, about an hour in after ordering our meal, I flagged down some person with a suit that was headed to the kitchen. I only assumed because of the direction he was going...I mean, everyone else had a name tag and after I had flagged him down, I realized. . oh! he had no name tag. So I asked..sorry, do you work here? (perhaps a manager since he has no name?)
His response rudely was, ""Of course!"" with a duh attitude. I wanted to explain to him that he didn't fit the normal uniform and I didn't notice that he had no name tag. And at an upscale dining establishment. . . finding a man in a suit is rather common. I had a vest on myself and just a coat away from dressing better than him. But I shrugged it off as I didn't want to hold him back from where he was going. 
I inquired about our meal since at this rate of just waiting without any sign of our waiter, it may be another hour before we get to eat and will miss our show. I made the reservation for 7pm and had a 9:30pm show. We were hoping to grab a drink before it but spoiler alert, we finished dining at 9:20pm and had no time to look around the hotel.
He then proceeded to look down his nose to me and say that this was a true Italian dining experience and that I should have known this before booking this restaurant before the show. My issue here is that he started scolding me without even knowing the context of the situation or even talking with our waiter. This bothered me a lot. Is it true Italian style to wait for your drink for 20 minutes before they arrive? I think some Italians would disagree. I know I would get sober enough not to want another by then personally. i highly doubt our case was based on the theme of this establishment. I could rant on about more after this but this was the main story experience of this place. It's Vegas. Many choices and great options to partake on.

It was a spontaneous decision to eat there and we were not disappointed. There was no wait. We got seated by he kitchen so we had a great view of all the meats on being grilled. Well, all of us of course ordered steak. They only had one type of meat that they aged, and that is the New York strip. It would have been better if they had other selections that they dry aged. The steak was delicious. The waiter's recommendation of getting it medium cooked is perfect. The meat was juicy, tender and flavorful. We also ordered a couple sides. Their mashed potatoes with asiago chedder was their side of the day and it was super yummy. The staff was overall nice and very attentive. They even let one of our friends take a picture of the kitchen area. The price is fair for what they serve. Expect to spend over $100 for two. Maybe more if you order alcoholic drinks with your meal.

They said the reservation was made and all I had to do was show up.

We show up at our reservation time only to find out that our reservation wasn't actually made.  Not sure if that's the concierge's fault or it was lost in the mix at the actual restaurant.  Either way, I was a little annoyed.

Our server was Bryan, and he was great.  He was very descriptive with the menu options we had questions about and was open about letting us know what his personal favorites were.  My husband went all out and ordered the New York New York which included their dry aged strip steak and a whole lobster.  I went for my usual 8oz filet mignon with a side of mashed potatoes (potato puree is what they called it).  As a starter, we decided on the fried calamari.

A trio of bread was brought to our table, which is always nice.  Their olive bread was different, but a good different. It had that briney flavor, but it wasn't too overpowering. Almost immediately, our calamari came out.  It was perfectly crispy and flavorful, but a little on the chewy side.  A few minutes later, our entrees came out.  My filet was ordered medium and came out more of a medium well.  Not juicy at all.  My husband's steak was cooked perfectly, but the lobster tasted like it was left in the water for maybe a minute too long...again, a little chewy.

The place does not have a modern feel to it, and usually when I am going to spend alot of money on food I kind of enjoy the atmosphere as well too.

Not what we were expecting. I guess I am used to the pretzel bread, cheesy bread, and all the other cool kinds of bread you get at other steakhouses. 

The service was very good, someone there to fill your water every time you took a sip practically. My friend and I shared the cowboy rib-eye steak $38 it was very big. The steak just wasn't as good as I hoped for. The sauce on top was good. We shared 4 cheese mac and cheese and creamed spinach-both I enjoyed. But usually sides at steakhouses are always good.

A steakhouse that was highly praised on a few occasions to my boss; we were set to have dinner there Monday night. Seating was quick once the table was ready for our reservation. Staff was nice for the most part. 

They recommend their dry aged new york strip and their filet. I asked if she would talk me out of the king cut prime rib. After looking at the menu online before heading to the restaurant, I was excited for the prime rib. It is not an item offered everywhere and I try to get it when the option exists. Unless, of course, she was going to suggest something else. She said she would not talk me out of it, and I ordered it thusly. 

I had a terrible piece of meat. It was riddled with fat that the waitress tried to tell me was ""marbling"". Excuse me, I am one of the few steak eaters who actually enjoys the true marbling. This was not the good stuff. She told me I had to get to the center of the steak to find the good part. I had cut all the way through to the center and was still unhappy. I suggested that either I had a very dull steak knife or my steak was a bad cut. She said they did have very dull knives at the restaurant. Yeah, I bet they do. Why would you want sharp steak knives at a steakhouse? 

She came back after a few minutes and offered me a small cut of something else if I wanted it but I was too disgusted with my current meal to want any more. 

The other entrée ordered was the cowboy cut bone-in ribeye (what I should have gotten) and that was said to be good. Not the best, but nothing to complain about. 

We had an order of beer-battered onion rings that were very good though they only gave you four on a plate. Their calamari was average and they give you a half a loaf of a sesame bread that was probably the highlight of the meal for me.

1831302,2011-06-03,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Had dinner on a Saturday night here a couple weeks ago. We had a reservation and we were seated quickly. Good thing we had called ahead because it was pretty crowded for 6:30 on a Saturday night in Vegas. 

Service:
Service was awesome. Our waiter was a little quirky but nice. He recommended some favorites of his and asked us where we were from and made conversation even though he was busy. He was very attentive. Our water glasses were never empty as there was a guy circling the restaurant constantly refilling drinks. When I had a little trouble finding the restroom, an older waiter politely pointed it out and called me ""doll"". Can't beat that!

Food:
Food was YUMMY! Crusty yet soft bread basket with lots of butter to start with. Husband got the New York steak aged 40 days and he said it was one of the best steaks he ever got. The guy sitting next to us said the same thing about his. I'm not a steak eater and I had the salmon and it was delish! Came with a side of quinoa cooked really well. We got the Yukon smashed postatos and asparagus as sides. It's a bit of a bummer you have to order them separate but they were really good and definitely big enough to share. The sauce that came on the asparagus was great. We got the lava cake for dessert and I'm not a huge fan of lava cake so I gave that to my husband and ate the yummy ben and jerry's ice cream that came on it. Next time we'll have to get appetizers, the couple next to us got this shrimp thing that looked really good. 

It's loud in there but everywhere in Vegas is loud. If you want a quiet, romantic dinner you should go to Napa or Santa Barbara or Sedona or something. The people next to us were getting annoyed at the funny drunk at the table across the room who was telling loud stories. HELLO! It's VEGAS! And he wasn't rude, just loud. Lighten up, peeps. 

Yes it was also kind of overpriced but it's hard to get that kind of quality and service in Vegas so I would say it was worth it for a splurge. I will definitely be going back!",5CiHaA5RmXDVjPUce9Gm8w,2,3,4,U2YNTJdqs0ARSqiPQbSLnA

I went during an off night with a small party, they had the prime rib and the bone in New York. Both were Excellent.

I had a Porterhouse.. the price was a warning sign. If you are paying $45 for a New York and your porterhouse has a combined New York and Filet but yet it only costs an extra $5 chances are you are getting a little less than both. 

 I got a thin porterhouse that was shoe leather. Too thin to cook to rare/medium without burning it.

The wait staff picked up something wasn't right, I just told them it wasn't acceptable,and that I wanted a bone in New York as a replacement. Instantly the steak was gone, and the manager came out and apologized, and I got my replacement steak rather quickly. 

The New York was very nice and one of the better ones I've had at a restaurant. Flavor was buttery with a nice taste due to the aging process. Very tender.. even the fat was good.

The Caesar Salad was average, but the wedge salads were pretty good. Salads weren't huge for the price, but the presentation was nice.

No comments on the seafood we never had any.

You each order your own entree such as a steak which comes with nothing else so you all have to decide which sides you are going to share.  
I had a NY Strip which was pretty good.....not worth what they charged for it.....for that much I'd expect the best damn steak I ever had......but nope, just pretty good.  It was tender but not very flavorful. Personally, I do a better steak on my grill at home.
The various sides we shared we all very good but with 5 of us you didn't get much of each since everyone wanted to try each one.  I could have eaten the mashed potatoes all by myself but had to settle for a spoonful or two.
The service was decent.  Not very personal but attentive enough even with a good size crowd in there. 
They have a decent selection of wine and absolutely loved the Moscato.

The service and ambience were a close second to the food, and how much I raved about the steak, both the service and the ambience are no slouches.

The bf & I decided to both start with the clam chowder, get macaroni w/cheese and the mashed potatoes with garlic & herb.  We also wanted to split an entree since I don't think either of us would have been capable of eating so much meat on our own.  We decided on the the king cut prime rib...and soon found out that we should have chosen the queen cut to split.  =)

The Food:
-Clam chowder = heaven!  This is REALLY good clam chowder.  It's a giant bowl of rich, creamy chowder full of clams and potatoes.  I absolutely loved it even though it seemed pretty heavy on the clams (more so than most places)

-Macaroni & cheese = disappointment; this was honestly the low point of the meal.  I like mac n' cheese to be smooth and creamy but this was clumpy and solid (not saucy).  There were 2 little pieces of bacon in it but we didn't care for this much at all.

-Garlic & herb mashed potatoes = delicious!  I loved these super creamy mashed potatoes...the garlic flavor was perfect.  It was a special for the night but if they make it available to you, you should order it!

-King cut prime rib = ginormous slab of beef!  It was quite good but in my mind, I wasn't expecting it to be so large.  It's bone-in and I'd say about two or two & a half inches thick at least.  The meat was really juicy and tender...you could probably cut through it without a knife.  Had a nice, earthy beef flavor to it & I thought it was great.  The bf thought it could have used a little more seasoning to it but if you're one of those people that really like the flavor of the meat to come through then you'll be very happy.

**We split the king cut & there is no cost to do a split = awesome!  I know a lot of other restaurants charge some sort of fee but it's really wonderful that here it's not a problem.

Our dining experience was wonderful - our server was very attentive, cheery and helpful to us.  The total came out to around $76 for the two of us which is very, very good in my opinion for this type of restaurant.  Gallagher's is known for their dry-aged steaks and I saw many order this...and I would have ordered it as well but it looked like too much for me to eat.

The king crab legs were good but they had an unusual flavor to them, as though they were boiled in a flavored water, they were still good, just different.  Both of my dining companions thought their meals were good, nothing was ""exceptional"".  We had the mac & cheese and broccoli for sides, the mac & cheese was ok but not amazing.  We did order the sticky toffee pudding for dessert, after living in England for several years if I ever see it on a menu I get it.  It was ok, far from what you'd get in the UK, but still ok.

Oh, the beer choices were pathetic.  I realize that I tend to go for more unique microbrews and there was nothing like that on the menu and for some reason I wasn't in the mood for wine.

Overall it was good, the prices were pretty high---$70 for king crab and it's not a place I'd need to visit again on my next visit to Vegas.",vNlydqSYWvuDyJNxZ-ewog,1,1,4,KIEjRrsnOeERsS1v5r_iEQ

As expected, the steaks all came out as ordered and the aging process made them tender and more flavorful.  Ribeyes were nicely marbled but the NY steak was more lean.  The portion was very generous, especially for a fancy place like this.  Instead of wine, I got an Islay Scotch to pair with the steak.  The smokey flavor complemented the steak (or any BBQ for that matter).  I wish the pour was more generous, but that's the on gripe.

I ordered the aged NY Strip which is usually what you see in the pictures.  They cook it over a mesquite grill that makes the charred parts outside burst with flavor while still being medium rare on the inside.  I don't think you'll have any problems with any of the selections.  Might not be the best you've ever had, but you won't be disappointed.

I also got the clam chowder, very nice texture and flavor.  It's hard to get that balance right.  And the mac & cheese, which for some reason I didn't hold the bacon on.  I'm kind of getting tired of bacon.

The steak was $50, the other items were abound $8 each, total bill was just over $71.  I drank water only.

After the meal I kept noticing how the staff seemed to know when to come/interact and when to give me peace.  I went alone and spent a lot of time reading on my iPad, and they seemed to know when to jump in.  Other times they would refill my water without saying anything.  Hard to describe, but too many places talk too much and others stay away too much.  Very friendly, down-to-earth staff.

Nice decor; hard to believe you're in the middle of a casino.  I went mid-week and probably could have walked up, but when I called to ask some questions they made a reservation for me for 30 minutes later.  I wore jeans, their only real policy is no tank tops for guys.

TIP:  I received a $150 food credit with my reservation at Monte Carlo.  Since NYNY and Monte Carlo are both owned by the MGM Grand, I was able to use the credit to pay for the meal.",Ap0-JqUsibRaVSlTf_HqnA,7,5,5,6tdlQgW9kPORfn9igXLGqg

definite must eat here spot when in the city of sin, literally there King cut is probably 2 of largest prime rib cuts at Broadway Prime or House of Prime Rib x 2 that is literally how big the King cut is. 

This is serious man food (arrr arrrr arrr ""tool man taylor"" would say) Portion good, service excellent, drinks excellent, go in small or large groups they can accomodate most size parties. 

I have other steaks all over the place and this is hands down the best that I have had in Vegas, HANDS DOWN that is a bold statement, it even comes close to toppling my all time favorite Bob's Steakhouse in SF..

This I can honestly say if you are a carnivore this is the place you want to be, rare or med-rare is super flavorful all the way through!!! got to the center needed maybe a lil dash of salt but still even after 15min the meat just oozes flavor, Man VS Food in this contest MAN won, only left the fat and grissle usually I dont but due to the size of the meat I had to make room.

You probably wont eat the next day til late dinner, for some people, try to get a lil starch in you just a lil and dont order appitizers trust me you wont need them.

If there is one food type that I love in this world its steak. I was excited to finally tryout the famous Gallagher's. The Vegas location is quite cramped but the service was very good. Our waiter was attentive without being annoying. I ordered the Filet Mingon. The food took an incredibly long time to come out. We sat for 45 mins before we had our first bite...that's just unacceptable. When the steak finally appeared it was one of the worst steaks I have every had. It was like they cooked the filet on medium heat because it was very tough. There is no excuse for a tough Filet. It was chewy and didn't have much taste to it. I was very disappointed. I make better steaks at home, so I certainly expect more from a dedicated steak restaurant. I will never be returning. I would rather go to Ruth Chris' or Gordon Ramsay's The Steak, where they know how to properly cook a steak.

2227090,2012-09-11,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Quite literally the best steak I ever had.  Very nicely turned out restaurant, helpful yet unobtrusive staff, unbelieveable food.

First, let's get the one downer for this place out of the way... it's expensive.  Really good steak places are.  If that's a problem, you won't like it.

Once you get over that, be prepared to just sit there and groan for at least a half hour after you eat here.  The steaks are just that big and that good.   I'd recommend either the dry-aged New York strip (with bone, and about 2+ inches thick, plus look up dry-aging... it's incredible), or the Cowboy-cut Rib-eye (best rib-eye... EVAH, and at least a pound of beef).

Sides are also pretty nice.  We had the broccoli au gratin, wild mushrooms, asparagus, and mashed potatoes (can be skipped) at the table.  They were big enough for 2 easy and very tasty.

The staff was great.  At places this nice, the staff are sometimes just too eager to pump the tip and are constantly interrupting your conversations and groans of enjoyment.  Not true here.   Our glasses were never empty, but I hardly noticed the staff after we got our meal, otherwise.  Good job, guys.

The six of us spent about $450 with a few beers and sodas around the table, 6 steaks, and 4 or 5 sides.  It's not cheap, but if you're in Vegas for some good food... this is a great place to get it.

Oh, forget dessert, it's a joke you'll understand after you've stuffed the steak in your belly.",cwqYWgrPD4aLF4HB9ArtGw,1,0,5,7Z7s6zDQBM2Z_efh7JB88g

Being in Vegas there's clear competition on what steak house is the biggest in the game. Arguably one of the best, and up on the recommendations list with Vegas Elites; I'm glad I had the chance to cross this one off my list. 

While roaming aimlessly around New York New York, weaving through replication of roads and buildings of the city itself, you'll eventually stumble onto an extravagant array of meat. Upon closer inspection, slabs and slabs of dry aged beef sitting beautifully in their window display.

Friday night with no reservation we arrived around 730 and luckily; no wait for a table needed. The space is lightly dimmed, tables dressed with white linen and walls filled with portraits and newspaper clippings. Service from start to finish was commendable, Each one of the hostess' and waitstaff were all extremely friendly and welcoming. Atmosphere and ambiance is set for a classy sophisticated date night.

TO THE FOOD! 

New York New York - ($110) - Dry aged New York strip and a fresh Maine lobster. God, the presentation for this was remarkable. Arriving table side on a trolley, all eyes turn and are fixated on that glistening piece of meat with a gigantic lobster right beside, shell and all. The color from the two is enough to make your mouth water. As you try to comprehend how you're about to attack this monstrosity of a plate, the gracious server tells you to give him a second as he deshells the lobster for you, yes please, thank you. Enough bells and whistles, the lobster tasted like no other lobster I've had before. Without even needing to use the butter on the side, the meat was juicy and sweet and tasted unbelievably fresh. I'm sure fresh, considering how he just deshelled the thing beside me. Now to the second part of the show. The New York strip, grass fed, dry aged for 21 days, served medium rare with the bone in. This beautiful thing has changed the way I look at steak forever. I've aquired what I thought was a ""beefy"" flavor to a more intensified beefy flavor, each bite was so juicy. I don't know, perfect is the closest description I can sum up for this gigantic plate. 

Dry Aged New York Strip - ($46) - Yeah, we ordered this too, we didn't think portions were going to be this massive. Probably would have been good thought to share. BUT THIS WAS COOKED PERFECTLY TOO. Like honestly, portion sizes are damn well worth it here. 

Petaluma Free Range Chicken -($28) - Who orders a chicken dish at a steakhouse you ask? My sister. This was pretty good too, but I mean, I was devouring a steak, so a juicy bite of chicken has got nothing on the steak. 

Green Beans -($9) - Simply sauteed with garlic; this dish- our only green dish, was a nice little reassurance that we too, eat greens. 

Four Cheese Macaroni - ($10) - Creamy and decadent; two adjectives you definitely want to correlate your macaroni dish to.

Seasoned jumbo steak fries -($7) - Five star rating just for the fries. Yes even at a fine dining establishment, if fries are on the menu you better believe I'll be ordering. Nice crispy layer while you have a velvety potato mush in the middle followed with the seasoning and the added dust of cheese on top. Good god, bless this dish and bless my stomach for ever had consumed this. I'm not over exaggerating. You need to try this. 

Clear as water that I'm blown away with my dinner here. Setting, service and food all 5 stars. No complaints. Most memorable meal during my Vegas trip.",-9QrNxZ0l0cSbTYXPlsu_g,4,1,5,h25agYSICIdHOmXawBaCyQ

The ONLY reason I'm not giving this place a full 5 stars is because our appetizer, the Sea Scallops, only came with 3 for $18- and they were not really ""jumbo"" sized, and the third was was actually pretty small. For the price I wish it was at least 4 scallops, but if you're gonna only give 3, then at least make them all big. However, despite that they were YUMMY. Pureed grits (delish) with bacon wrapped scallops and a red pepper sauce-- gooood. 

My husband and I split the cowboy ribeye, which was HUGE. We were both full off this easily. I cannot imagine how anyone could eat this by themselves without having a lot of leftovers. We didn't have a fridge in our motel room, so that wasn't an option-- but we cleaned our plates and left feeling full but not miserably so. The steak was so tender and flavorful- it did have some fatty pieces as ribeyes are known to do, but I gave those mainly to my husband to eat. I tried a piece and it melted in my mouth, but in general I usually don't like the fat. The crispy onions on top were fantastic as well as the small side of greens that came on the plate. We got our with horseradish and it really sent the meat over the edge. The creamed spinach side we got was definitely big enough for two people and was YUMMY!!

Our server was extremely nice and explained everything we needed to know. The service was relatively fast and we were able to get in at 7pm on a saturday (memorial day weekend) without a reservation! But pretty sure we just got lucky because the place was definitely busy!

I can't pick a clear favorite here, the porterhouse is magnificent, the prime rib is just devine.. everything here is prepared very well - among the best steakhouses in Vegas. 

If you order the prime rib, request an additional side of ""atomic"" horseradish, and mix it with some of the regular stuff. It'll whoop your ass. Clam chowder here is really good too, not too thick, not thin, just a bowl of goodness. 
For dessert get STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. For a while it was a secret menu item, but now it's more well known. Either way, get it, it's awesome. 

The service is very good, if you can't get a table (or forgot to make reservations because you were too drunk), you can have dinner at the bar. The bar staff is awesome - and make one of the best Long Island Ice Tea around.

The mac and cheese side dish was bland as hell. Chef Boyardee could put out a better dish, which is really, really saying something.

The bruschetta came out soon enough. It was pretty good but we both thought it was a little too salty and too covered in olive oil. Not a huge disappointment but definitely not that great either.

Our entrees came out shortly after and I was thoroughly impressed. Though a bit pricey, my fillet was super tender and moist. I ordered it medium-rare (as I order all my red meats) and it was cooked perfectly. The creamed spinach was really good as well and definitely went well with the cut of cow in front of me.

Her soup and salad were both satisfying, though the salad was wrapped in large leaves of lettuce that were somewhat difficult to cut-up. After a short, small struggle everything was consumable and delicious.

As far as price is concerned I don't feel it was overly expensive. $43 is about average for a steak on the strip, I'm not sure what else would be expected. We are locals and won't be back and this place won't be recommended. We like the kind of steaks that don't need A1!! lol",V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw,2,0,2,dOv8m3gLg9YL51pUi8Pvog

It was real disappointing to see that this place wasn't first on the list. OH MY GOD!!!!! By far the best steak I have ever had. This place was exactly what I was looking for. Steak so tender and juicy that it just fell off the fork. Had the Porterhouse and my wife had a New York  strip. Simply amazing and magnificent. Had the special side for the night. Garlic jalapeno bacon mashed potatoes. They melt in your mouth.

This was the last thing we needed to end our Vegas trip! We spent our last night taking turns on the ivory throne, pooping our lives away. We couldn't point out if it was the lobster or the steak.

2430328,2014-04-06,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I want to start off by saying that I haven't been to Vegas in many many many years.  When we were there this past week, we ate at quite a few big name restaurants on our visit but was craving a great steakhouse.  I asked a friend to suggest a great steak while we were still in town so here is my two cents.

The ambiance was loud and alive, reminiscent of a traditional Chicago steakhouse, minus the sound of the casino.  When I ordered wine for our table of 6, our server (Caroline), was very suggestive about wine pairing with each course as we progressed through our meal, which I really enjoy and find a great part of the culinary expirience.  Our server was also great at answering all questions that my guests had regarding portions, ingredients and even answered questions regarding my wife's allergies.  She was pleasant and well informed.  Top notch!  

For starters, the group started out with the crab cakes and calamari, which were very good, as were the wedge salad and roasted baby beet salad.  A couple of us had the clam chowder and said it was rustic and hearty in style.

Many of us ordered the bone-in dry aged NY steak that she suggested and everyone at the table commented how cooked perfectly there steaks were cooked considering almost everyone ordered them cooked differently, we are a nightmare in restaurants!
Other's had the Colorado lamb and commented how nice it was that it was not New Zealand lamb which tends to be a bit gamey and alot smaller chops.  My wife had the Irish organic salmon and loved it, as her allergies were looked after.  Thank you.
We tried many of the side dishes and they were all very good as well.

All in all it was a very fun evening, the food and service were great!
We don't have a Gallagher's here in Denver, so I'm thinking we have to hop over to Vegas more often!",R8Von7vVfmbKHrQplQ8vXg,0,0,5,5Msc9gMTr5DPsVeJcQiLGQ

I am not a local and cannot go here whenever I want to... but I miss it :)
I have had a lot of steaks being from a meat and potato family... this was up there with one of the best I have ever had. It may have been the best I have ever had. And I lived in Calgary, Alberta (beef-land) for 3 years so that is saying something.
It was a special night in April 2017 and we made sure we were going to make it in by reserving a spot for 5pm.
The hostess for that Saturday needed an attitude adjustment and did not set the tone very well for the evening but the rest of the night made up for her. Never forget her though and her welcoming snarkiness! Maybe she was just having a bad day.
Our waiter was professional and our busser was hilarious. ""BADABOOMBADABING!""! Will never forget him either!
The filet special steak was melt in your mouth good. Thick, juicy, perfectly rare and expensive. This is Vegas, ya gotta open your wallet at a steak house. Worth every penny as were the sides. Who knew, I grew up to like brussel sprouts! I am a sucker for potatoes (loaded mashed). Delicious.
I loved the clam chowder. I wanted to bathe in it - then I wanted to swim in my potatoes! The calamari was pretty good, standard.
He loved his porterhouse steak too. The kind of thankful bites where you close your eyes and chew. Because you cannot get up and do the happy dance. Maybe next time!
The place was jumping/getting loud as the evening wore on at NY NY but we were luckily seated in a pretty decent spot. Romantic lighting. Kitchen action.
The restrooms were way across the space and out into a gloomy hallway - not unusual for this town but, meh. Not ideal.
There are so many steakhouses in Vegas but I cannot stop thinking about this place and will be heading back there as soon as our wheels hit the strip. It was that good.",is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,3,4,4,wN-4umrSd7TFgVhMGiNdbA

2439184,2010-02-23,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"3.5 stars based on my meal, not my co-diners'.

My queen cut prime rib, ordered medium rare, looked more rare under the lighting but was actually closer to medium.  The cut was so thick (or maybe it was due to a different reason) that it wasn't as tender or as melt-in-your-mouth flavorful as I like it.  I was kind of surprised, considering it's a top steakhouse.  I could barely eat half of it, which I was thankful for since I didn't overeat and wasn't in pain like everyone else.

Sides:  Sauteed mixed mushrooms (turned out to be just button mushrooms and cut up shiitake mushrooms in a wine sauce).  They were tasty, though the menu was kind of misleading that they would be a better variety of mushrooms.  Creamed spinach (really creamy, a little bitter for me, nothing special).  Four cheese macaroni and cheese (non-hollow penne-like pasta swimming in what reminded me of a thick cheese soup -- I liked the smoked gouda addition and the texture of the pasta, which was almost like gnocchi, though).  I didn't try the asparagus in hollandaise, which looked really fresh and perfectly cooked.

The chocolate-zin dessert port I had for my after-dinner drink was really delicious.  I had never seen that offered anywhere before.

So 3.5 stars for my meal.  But I tried my boyfriend's steak (the dry-aged NY sirloin specialty of the house), and the crust on that was so flavorful and fantastic.  Not 5 star fantastic, but really really good.  The porterhouse, who was ordered by a friend who'd tried it a couple of years ago and had been dreaming of it ever since, made said friend very happy and quiet.  This time it was served with some bone marrow and roasted garlic to spread on the steak.  And a friend who ordered the filet mignon said it was like butter.  

I know my co-diners would give this place much higher ratings based on their meals, but I wouldn't go here for the prime rib.

Note: Interestingly, the last time I was in NYC, I came across the huge dry aging room that is viewable from the sidewalk at the original location.  I thought it was awesome, especially since people were working inside (the one at NY NY is much, much smaller).  Did you know it was America's first steak house (1927), created and named after a former Ziegfeld Follies dancer?",MCDwKJOOiMyhJKC86kHJmw,0,0,3,NJ0xDxadSEHN2uS1pKq0cA

When we arrived at our table there was a photo of Superman wishing him a happy birthday and autographed by the man himself (I'm sure, lol).

Situated on a ""street corner"" inside the NYNY, a few steps from the casino floor, this establishment is based on a restaurant of the same name in NYC.  There is a bar that you can sit at either inside or outside, and that is where we sat on our most recent visit.

Previously, we have eaten inside, and it is classy joint.  There is a usually a hostess dressed in black who will escort you to  your table.  After being seated, you will meet one of the most professional waiters or waitresses ever and he or she will be your guide to all things Gallagher.  The service here is pretty impeccable and you will realize, as we have, that the individuals who work here are dedicated to providing a quality dining experience.

I have only tried their signature steak and the salmon (just once on this last visit).  The salmon was good, but I am still kicking myself for wasting a Gallagher's visit and not having a steak.  It is the best I have ever had there.  Sides are always great as well.  Personally, I like the asparagus and the cheesy mashed potatoes.  I usually lead with an heirloom tomato and hearts of palm salad, which is a great mix of flavors and textures.  I've also had the shrimp and grits just once, and it was awesome.

Sitting at the exterior bar, we still had great service and food without the frills of fancy dining.  

I definitely see myself visiting Gallagher's in the future with my awesome husband and maybe some friends or family.  If you are considering it, definitely try it out.",PesNFqw_8e20OK33RVfEeQ,4,3,5,CcJxJbZaTbXwA23SvzRi_Q

We were served all of the preliminaries (ex water, bread) promptly. To start out the hubby orders clam chowder, which he says was very good but, not as good as Chart House's. I order the spinach salad which contained sliced strawberries, watermelon, nuts, bleu cheese, and a very light dressing--too light, almost non-existent. I do not recommend this salad. 

With our entrées we ordered a very nice Pinot Noir by Macmurry Ranch. Our entrees were a filet mignon and a surf and turf (6oz filet and 1lb. of split king crab legs). Our sides included a sauce of shallots and Beaujolais and asparagus. Everything was amazing. Unfortunately we were so full we didn't have any room for dessert.

This night was not super busy, and it took out server,Todd, at least 20 minutes to even step over to the table. Every time he came over, which weren't many, he spoke to us while running past the table. He clearly was not interested in hearing how our food was tasting or whether or not we needed anything else. I ordered the cowboy sirloin and my date ordered the  filet mignon, we ordered sliced mozzarella and tomatoes as an appetizer and asparagus as our side. The steaks were completely dry and lacked any flavor at all! She didn't even get down one bite and I added butter to mine from the table and ate mine( I was starving and figured i may as well try to get it down). The asparagus was too oily and had a weird fishy after taste. The only good thing about the meal was the appetizer. Sad to say, I will not be returning to Gallagher's.

Nice touch with the dry-aged steaks hanging in the window, but a bit misleading since there was only one dry-aged option on the menu.  Coincidentally, it happened to be the featured item on the menu.  All other options were wet-aged, which I'm not a huge fan of.  Wine selection is somewhat limited.  Sides were what you can expect from a joint like this.  The four stars is mainly for the quality of beef and perfectly grilled to order.  This is a convenient spot for a nice dinner if you're staying in the hotel.  Availability shouldn't be a problem since it's nearly always empty.

You can easily cobble a veggie plate together, and our server was super helpful guiding me through my options. I had steamed asparagus, onion rings, mashed potatoes (yukon gold puree), a caprese salad, and the mushroom medley. They are large sides -- I finished about half. The potatoes and onion rings are particularly good. Vegans would struggle here, but if you're a vegetarian, flexitarian, or pescatarian, you'll have plenty of choices.

The drinks weren't all that impressive. They have a decent bar, but the night we were there (May 2013), their bartender had a heavy hand with mixers. The glasses are a little small and the glassware feels light. The wine we had with dinner was fine, but not all that remarkable. They clearly make their money from the steaks not the booze.

I was *very* impressed by the service. They were attentive, but never pushy. We didn't feel rushed or pressured. One server here sees my dad every time he's in town -- and has met my mom, my sister, and me over the years. She remembers him and always makes a point to check in with him when he comes in to eat. It's the level of personal service you'd get in a small-town -- something pretty remarkable in Vegas.

The decor is very masculine, with lots of dark wood, big booths, and dark green leather. Think British sporting club. It's nice, but not stuffy. It felt like a dressy steakhouse you'd find in Des Moines.

Why not just do dry aging for the entire process? Why even advertise this when it actually shows that you've gone the ""cheap"" route?

So, I order the Dry aged New York which came out overcooked.  I ordered medium rare and it came out medium.  Not only was the steak overcooked but it was DRY.  It was actually unbelievable as even when I half-heartedly cook sub-prime steak it doesn't come out dry   

My friend's steak also came out overcooked.

I sent the steak back and got a new one....it was cooked correctly this time.   The actual flavor of the steak was not that great which i guess is ultimately the REAL problem.  It had an odd gamey flavor to it that is sometimes apparently in dry aged steak but never really in this unappetizing way.

The sides and appetizers were all unexciting and the service was sub par.  Our actual waitress was decent but the bus boys were pushy and seemed like they were in a hurry the whole time.    They just dropped the plates in front of us and constantly tried to take our plates away even though we weren't finished yet.   It's like they were in a hurry to get us the hell out of there.

Overall, I would say this place is below average in the world of ""Fine Steakhouses""

I would recommend Mastro's Ocean Club if you wanted steak in Las Vegas",X8EaFdIcMn3hYdlH0hJQ7w,3,0,2,bJGRP_UbxJmrX4qdemWIhg

3038082,2010-10-08,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Very good, traditional NYC steak house - very appropriate in the NYNY Casino. 

The interior is dark in a classic steakhouse fashion. The are pictures and caricatures of various old school celebs on the walls. Actually, its a pretty good knockoff of the NYC original. It's also pretty loud - very much like the NYC original. The steaks however, I think are a little BETTER than the NYC original! 

The first thing you notice is the meat - it's aging on display right in the front window. Can't miss it. Some may find this distasteful - I find it quite cool. And make no mistake - the steak is what it's all about here. The classic NY Sirloin Strip for about $40 is served on the bone. It's juicy, full of dry aged beef flavor, and just a bit firm to the tooth - note:not tough!- as a good NY Strip should be. And yes, it was aged in the window. The sides aren't as exciting but still very good. The steak fries were huge, crispy, and served with a killer chipotle ketchup. The sauteed spinach was simple yet delicious. 

The wine list wasn't the greatest but there was a very nice Merlot served by the glass that went exceptionally well the steak - as a good Merlot should. Oh, service was acceptable. 

Is this the best steakhouse in Vegas? Probably not. But it's also a couple of dollars less expensive than the other high end steak places. All in all a good, solid steakhouse. You won't go wrong eating here.",LbtFyFzsdt-d2XDlIGVsaQ,1,0,4,DHDUHJBmmGn40GzBQ8xgEQ

I ordered the cowboy rib eye and a wedge salad, and as a group we ordered a sampling of the sides, including the mashed potatoes, asparagus, mac and cheese, and the mushrooms. I liked the salad, it was a bit more dressed up than the usual wedge and was a nice start. My steak was cooked to a good medium rare and was also seasoned well. It was a giant steak but a good portion of it was inedible fat. All the sides were pretty good but the mac and cheese and the mushrooms were by far my favorites. They serve the sides family style (like most steakhouses) but they were much smaller than I was expecting.

As for the food, I'm not a huge meat eater so I decided to forego the whole reason behind this restaurant and opt for 1lb. of King Crab legs and then munch on a few bites of steak from other plates in our party.  My legs were quite substantial, however they got cold fast since they come split in 1/2.  Not a bit deal, but when you're paying $45 for a plate of food you'd like it to be warm.  I also had the chance to taste the New York Strip and Ribeye, both cooked to perfection, nice and tender.

Steak in Vegas is just ridiculous now.  With so many to choose from and rising prices, the days of $9.99 steak dinners are fading fast away.  (Then again, it's probably a good thing those days are fading fast away.  I remember one being less tender than the wood of my desk and tasting worse that I imagine my desk tasting.)  

So my girlfriend and I got two steaks (the dry aged bone-in sirloin), two glasses of wine, a couple of cocktails, a Caesar salad and a side of asparagus was $120.  That's pretty damn reasonable.  

The steaks were very good - beefy, stronger flavored than your average piece of meat and firm to the texture without much excess juice - typical of dry-aged beef.  

I got mine medium-rare and asked for medium char.  The waitress said they can't do ""medium char"" - only ""regular"" or ""charred.""  Don't get charred.  Although the waitress said that they don't put on a heavy char, my steak came out looking black.  The funny thing was, it didn't taste bitter like a charred steak does.  A little strange because of that, but the inside meat was good.  I didn't bother to send it back because I was with a date and didn't want her to have to wait for another one to come out.  And the steak was huge.  Easily 16oz.  And at under $40 (I believe it was actually $34), it's a relative bargain in Vegas.

The wine list is standard for Vegas - over priced and not inspiring.  But the wines by the glass were reasonable and of decent quality.  The Caesar salad was decent except for too much dressing.  Thick, good asparagus were used for the side.  

Service was friendly and professional.  Just don't ask for their opinion of getting your steak ""charred.""

And that's the reason why it drops 2 stars as the expectation level of quality meat wasn't there.  I guess you get what you pay for and for $42 for a USDA Choice NY Steak Dry Aged Piece.",GBdtjcd-nMgt6V7M5KCWJg,1,1,3,i-v47I1PWnE6M1sbjhGTOg

I got the MUSHROOM SALAD as my first course and it was also very good.  It came with bacon so I had to ask the waitress to bring it back (which she said was a mistake because she told them it was for a vegetarian).  

The only vegetarian entree were the side dishes which is usually the case with steakhouses.  I got the STEAK FRIES  and FRENCH GREEN BEANS.  The fries were okay, needed a bit more seasoning but the ketchup was spicy and went well with the fries.  The green beans were also just okay.

Dessert was the usual warm lava cake.  It came with caramel toffee ice cream.  It wasn't bad but not that memorable.

The bar is covered in a stainless steel top and adorned with a chalkboard denoting the specials.  Fernando, the bar tender, warned me away from the special, a Green Mountain, because it was a girlie drink.  More so, it was probably a good warning because the co-worker I was with doesn't pull any punches and looks for the opportunities to take the shots.

The bar was well stocked, Fernando was skilled and they had Newcastle Brown (and a few others) on tap.

The next night, our dinner reservations got mysteriously canceled and again, protracted negotiations got our party of 15 drinks at the bar and the table in the back room.

The back room was especially cool, with photos and painting of pinup girls and starlets on the walls and a bar dedicated to that room (read super-fast).  It was a steak house menu - sure there were a few chicken and fish dishes for the people who will live longer, but the steak was to die for.

The waiter suggested sharing sides and we ended up delegating the selection to him!  The macaroni and cheese is great and the hot and cold appetizer sampler was excelllent - lobster, shrimp, crab cakes and more.  Mmm.

I had a filet, cooked perfectly medium-rare, topped with crab and bernaise sauce.  It was delicious.  I think that three other people had the same and others were jealous.

We had tickets to a show and only had an hour and a half to devote to dinner and we got out of there on time, surprisingly.

Here's the good. The place is nice looking enough. Our server Derek was fantastic -- very personable and excellent at his craft. In addition to him, there's a person that busses the table and came by often to make sure our water glasses were always topped off.  And after our salad course made sure all bread crumbs were wiped from the table (a bread basked of sour dough French and cranberry rye is served). Truly great service!

We each had Caesar salad that was very fresh. Served on a flat plate, the romaine leaves are left long, drizzled with dressing and croutons. So one cuts the lettuce themselves. Salad was tasty.  We ordered 3 sides -- creamed spinach, mushroom medley, and pureed Yukon gold potatoes. Sides were okay.

Here's the thing though.....ordered their Signature steak -- NY Strip bone in ($48). Ordered medium rare and cooked perfectly. Problem was the meat. It had grizzle and way too much fat. It just was a poor cut of meat and they tout it as their Signature cut?!?!  Derek was sympathetic and offered amends.  He offered to have them cook a new one, but we did not have time for that with our upcoming show. He offered to comp dessert but again didn't have time or cared for dessert then either. I thanked him, told him I appreciated that and we'd just take the check. He brought the check and he didn't charge us for either salad. Really a stand up thing to do and I didn't even ask for any compensation.

Well another year and we are back....  Strangely I order the pork chops here because I am not a heavy red meat eater.

With that said, BUMMER on this years offering.   While tasty, portion size is smaller and the presentation was seriously lacking.   2011 had two bone in chops grilled separately and arranged in a butterfly presentation.  This year it was still two bone in chops, but just that.  Oh there was a very non descript side sauce; shouldn't have bothered sadly enough.

POSITIVE side, the service of the staff inside were spectacular.  So I have to give über kudos for that. 

Will we go back in 2013?  Only if the group wants to.  I am sorry and wished for more....

Go to a steakhouse and order pork chops, yup!   These were probably the best pork chops I have had in a long time.  The confiet (sp?) that was served as garnish was awesome, as was the corn bread...

I tasted someone's steak and it was very good.  I just could not eat two big steak meals two days back to back.   I heard no complaints during the meal or the next day.

Service here was fantastic (a little miss from the personality of the two bar tenders though....stick around for drinks after, they were really not the best customer facing folks, really need to improve please).

We both had the bone in rib eyes medium rare and both were delicious.  Cooked to perfection and juicy.  Although we ordered sauces the steaks did not need them at all.  I ordered the whiskey mushroom sauce and he ordered the Stilton blue cheese sauce.  Both were delicious and came in their own boats separately.  We started with Caesar salads both of which were beautifully dressed.  I had a jumbo baked potato and he had a Yukon gold mashed purée.  We also had the sautéed mushrooms.  All we piping hot and delicious.  We each had wine; I had a glass of wonderful Cabernet and he had a delicious glass of Merlot.  We topped off dinner by sharing a fabulous creme brûlée.

I went on line and made reservations and requested a table for six near the kitchen so we could see the grill. Much to our surprise we were set up at the Chef's table. The Chef visited our table and provide great suggestions which turned out to be fantastic. The steaks are by far the best we have enjoyed anywhere in Las Vegas. This may not be for everyone but we love the action and the experience of a working kitchen. The food being prepared and the aromas are so great.

The latter happened, and we ended up dining like kings at Gallagher's. 

To be honest, I really enjoyed our meal here. We started off with the clams, which were AMAZING to the point that I wanted to drink the broth. I even requested the server to leave the broth after all the clams were eaten so I could soak it up with bread. Too much? Maybe. 

In terms of main courses, the steak portions are huge. I shared a NY Strip Steak (which was phenomenal) with a side of mashed potatoes, and left full and happy. If you're picky about how your steak is cooked, I would suggest going a step up from what you usually order. i.e. I like my steak on the rare side, so we ordered a medium, which was really a medium rare. 

Another trick to note: my friend wanted bacon and cheese for his baked potato, and our server ended up bringin out two large bowls of bacon and cheese for the table to share. Such an added, delightful bonus to the meal. Because in my humble opinion, bacon makes the world go round.

2) ... And I'm glad it was that big too, cause for the 40 some odd dollars that it cost I was thinking, ""this steak better wax my car and give me tax advice for 40 some odd dollars!""

Gallagher's assumes that its Las Vegas clientele are too stupid to understand that they're paying for the very best Prime+ but are being served Sizzler-quality USDA Choice Grade steak.

Yes, the ambiance and service -- and even the side dishes and desserts -- are excellent, but nothing makes up for misleading customers.

And I squeeezed.  And I flexed.  And I waited.  And I waited...

18 I was (3 years ago...ok fine, 4...and then some), and the twin peaks were like small mounds.  The other girls were wearing big bountiful lacy things and I still hadn't outgrown my sports bra.  They had told me that I must do my exercises.  So exercise I did...religiously.  ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3TZB3upHZY )  The only thing the Bust Song and dance ever accomplished was a deflated ego and an increase in my pectoral muscles.  When the realization came that I was gonna need a bro instead of a bra, ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfONNfAjyrc ) the insanity stopped.  Naive much?  Yes.

ENTER:  Gallagher's Steakhouse's beautifully dry aged, bright scarlet, marbled beef displayed in a sealed glass case for all passersby to admire.  It's like that gorgeous girl you had your eyes on but just wanted to look at, not really converse with.  Why?  Because she just didn't taste as good as she looked.  Wait.  I'm still talking about the cow.  Right.

The Signature New York Steak is dry aged for 21 days in order to allow the flavors to seep in.  Although somewhat flavorful, it's rather tough even when served medium rare.  Try it with the accompanied sauces ($3 each).  We liked the Brandied Peppercorn served in a gravy boat.  The peppercorn provides that perfect kick along with the brandy reduction.  

Although the restaurant advertises the signature steaks displayed in their case, it's really nothing more than a good marketing ploy.  The mystery of dry aged beef to be more wonderful in flavor is as appealing as ExtenZe for Men.  In the end, it's nothing more than a stiff wind.

The true star of the evening was the 18 oz Cowboy Ribeye.  Sure, it was bigger than my face, but I rode that cowboy like any good cowgirl would...right into the sunset.  Each bite exploded with flavor.  It was tender, robust, and served with crispy string onions which was the perfect accompaniment.  Service was very attentive and friendly, which earned them an extra star.  Overall, a decent steakhouse though a bit gimmicky.

When Suzanne Somers told me that I could have buns of steel, I took a beating with the Thigh Master.  When the Shake Weight promised to revolutionize the way I tone my arms and shoulders, I ended up looking like I was JACKING. SOMEONE. OFF.  Yes, I fall for gimmicks as much as the guy who bought that Snuggie to free his hands for the remote (as well as ""other"" activities - notably after popping his ExtenZe pill).  Gallagher's may not have really lived up to the hype, but its marketing genius keeps people like me coming in, in hopes that the product really will deliver.  Every now and then, it's good to keep the hope alive for us infomercial-suckers.

Perhaps one day, I will learn that The Clapper cannot clap off an idiot.

That my ChiaPet will not play fetch.

That I may not ""increase my bust"" by squeezing my arms across my chest...

But like my breastesses, these hopes and dreams, though late to bloom, would one day become reality...however small and humble.  You just gotta believe...preferably with a Visa or MasterCard ready in hand.",EPBLDry-ObheloH-NuvbvQ,47,47,4,KfDnpa1FNFbh2LF5HjptiQ

One problem, she miss understood and thought that we said that there would only be 6. So we go back to our table and guess what it's a 6 top. No problem they said wait here and we will reset the 10 top. This is when all goes wrong.

It is definitely not cheap, but the steak you get is huge, probably even enough to share between two people. The taste and texture were on point, and although I realize that having the bone in is what makes this a classic, the tendons in mine were quite stringy and made the meat harder to separate in some parts. So I'd probably say the price is more for the amount of steak that you get rather than the quality of the cut (maybe this isn't as true for other items). Assuming you don't mind using your hands a bit, you can probably get more of the meat than with just using your knife and fork.

Unfortunately, our dining experience was less than stellar:
- My husband was not served alcohol because he left his ID in our hotel room even though my 60-year-old-plus parents vouched for his age (he's 29). We hadn't been carded the entire trip. I get that they don't want to get in trouble, but this was annoying.
- It took about 30 minutes after we sat down to get bread, and we received our entrees ONE HOUR after ordering. We ordered after 8PM on a Sunday night, and they were not swamped with customers.
- One of my fellow table guests asked the bread/water server for an update on our food, and he said he'd check with our server. Our server Linda consequently ignored us until our food arrived, about 15 minutes later. We tried to make eye contact with her to no avail while she was checking on other tables around us.
- Several dishes were cold when we finally got them (i.e. French fries, which are never good cold).
- My husband found several hairs in his food about 10 minutes after we were served. We told our server. She came over and asked if he had saved the hairs for her to see. Who saves hairs they find in their food? That's disgusting! Look on the floor where he tossed them!
- The manager came by after our server told him about the hairs on my husband's plate. He too questioned my husband if he saved the hairs (um, no). The manager said, ""I'm surprised, this usually doesn't happen"" - I would certainly hope not!
- Neither our server or the manager offered to get another meal for my husband (again, after waiting an hour to get our food, so we were all hungry!). They took his hairy food off the bill, but such an accusatory attitude toward a guest is awful. They were both defensive and arrogant when it came to trying to make the situation better.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed. To wait an hour for food, topped off with rude staff, is unacceptable when you're spending $50+ per person on food and drinks. I work in customer service myself so I know how important it is to cater to your guests. The sad part is, it's Vegas and they don't care if you ever come back, so they could care less about keeping their customers happy.

We went there without reservations (mistake #2), but happily waited 1.5hrs.  Then we ordered our steaks (Filet Mignon and the their signature, aged sirloin) cooked medium... big mistake.. huge (mistake #3).  I asked the server how they cook their meat.. medium = pink all the way through?  The server said confidently yes.  We trusted him.  I had wrongly assumed that steakhouses tend to undercook their meat (order medium = get medium rare..).

Our steak was dry.  Both of ours.  The filet was medium well.  Some parts were cooked all the way through.  We should've complained.  But we didn't.  I almost choked on some parts of the meat.  My wife kept telling me that I cook a better steak at home.

The appetizer (oysters) were ok, but they were nothing special at $3 per piece.  The soup (chowder) and the caesar salad was pretty good.  Up until the steaks came out we were very happy.  Then the steaks just disappointed us.  Man.. I really really love steaks and I had high hopes.  

We were there with 2 little kids.  They gave us a booth and we did ok.  I always feel bad about taking little kids to nice restaurants.  It could be annoying to others there.  It would've been worth all the trouble taking little ones to a good restaurant if the meat was good.  

Now, forever I'll wonder what if I ordered the steaks medium rare.. or even rare... forever.

Service was good, but not excellent.

Atmosphere was ok.  it's an upscale, busy restaurant.  If you're gonna go here, make sure to get a reservation and order steaks rare.

I would've given them 2 stars but because it was us who ordered medium.. 3 stars for what it could've been.",qioQob5zxrnPinR6QieJWg,0,0,3,7cYhXqLSyeRrrbO2JjWgpg

It was sent back, and then came to me a bit rare.  I was hungry enough and sheepish enough at that point to just eat it.  It tasted fine, but I don't particularly like looking at bloody meat.

That being said, almost everyone else at my table ordered the dry aged NY sirloin ($38, ~16 oz with bone), their specialty.  The few bites I had of that were very very good.  Perhaps if I had had that, this would be a 4 star experience.

Probably one of if not the best steak I've had in Vegas. I've been here 3 times already and each time has been great!

First of all, this place is always PACKED.  Make sure you have reservations or you'll have a wait around dinner time.

I've ordered the filet mignon twice and the queen cut prime rib once, and also have tried the porterhouse and the cowboy rib-eye (GREAT FLAVOR).  All have been superb, but I will say that my favorite is still the tender filet. Each time it has been cooked precisely medium-rare as ordered...which is often a difficult task even at some of the best steakhouses.

The one time I ordered the queen cut prime rib, I was disappointed after having such a great previous visit and ordering the filet.  Although the queen cut was a sizable portion (but not too big that I couldn't finish) they served me a medium-well to well (see pic), when I had ordered medium-rare. (I didn't bother sending it back cuz I was so hungry, just decided not to order it again in the future). The prime rib cut is on the thicker side and not quite as flavorful as prime rib I've enjoyed at other establishments that primarily serve prime rib (Lawry's or SF's House of Prime Rib). After that, I stuck with only ordering filet, which has been consistently top-notch.

BEST SIDE EVER: seasonal mushroom medley!!  Unbelievable! You'll have to taste it to understand.

Their sauteed spinach and macaroni are great as well.

Don't forget to save/make room for their creme brulee -- it's amazing!!!

This place is not your typical snooty, quiet steakhouse.  It's actually very lively, as everyone seems to be enjoying themselves in great company. Service was super friendly and attentive.  They checked on us regularly and we were never low on water. Only slight inconvenience would be that the restaurant itself did not have restrooms and you have to exit through the backdoor to use NYNY hotel's restrooms instead. However, that's really minor compared to the quality of food and service that you'll get here =)",7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,0,0,4,Cu1vBCSd2EMhCvs1z1PvOQ

Gallagher's is a familiar and frequent stop when we are in Vegas.  We've hosted friends and family there, because of the excellent food, ambience and let's face it, it's damned impressive.

Tonight, there was a bit of a problem.  The surf and turf dish that I ordered included a pound of King Crab Legs that I attacked as if it owed me money.  That is..until I found several cold spots in what should have been a steaming pile of decapod crustacean destined for drawn butter.

""Touch it"", I implored my wife.

""What??"" she asked incredulously, thinking my sudden ardor totally inappropriate.

""The crab.  Touch it, it's cold.""

She reached out, and with a hesitant digit felt along the creamy meat.  Ohh...if it were only hot.  

""Oh Jesus"", she implored, ""send it back.""

I shrugged and said ""no, it's okay"".  Then, I found the same in what remained of the crab legs.  It was now my turn to be steamed.

Our waitress, Catherine I believe her name was, came over all giggly and gracious (here was a real pro who can serve me anytime).  ""Is everything okay?"" she asked.  I turned to her and asked her to touch it, holding out the crab leg.  ""It's cold.""

Well, this service pro went into action and summoned the manager.  His apologies were sincere, and get this...HE DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

I can't fault an impeccable restaurant like Gallagher's for human error.  Shit happens.  Let's just say we were made happy, and I got my crab fingered by the manager. 

A happy ending indeed.  We look forward to coming back to this incredible restaurant that understands that customer service is a crucial element of a successful dining experience.

Green beans as my side was simple, really nothing to rave about and in my opinion, should have been included with our steaks. Dining partner ordered the dry aged strip which he raved about; when I tried a piece, it was extremely flavorful but almost a bit on the salty side for me. It could be due to the dry aged flavor, it has an umami taste to it. I do have to say his dish was HUGE, a gigantic steak which he somehow miraculously finished.

Note: As I stated, this place charges separate for the sides, an order of steak is simply just a steak! I would think it is standard to have a side of vegetable or carb come with a steak at this price point.

Another thing to note.. Like most nicer restaurants, everything is a la carte. They did provide bread (several kinds). I had a Cesare Salad which was good, but it was served I'm wedge form. It would have been better a little more ""disassembled"".

Two of my party got the New England Clam Chiwder (the white one) and they both fished it quickly and one mopped up the extra with bread.. I'm taking that as a 'yum'.

They have a nice selection of sides, from mushrooms to asparagus to baked or mashed potatoes. The asparagus was steamed but I asked if they would grill it and he accepted with out even thinking about it...

Definitely not disappointing! Mr. J and I (of course) ordered the rib eye for our main dishes with sides of the truffle mashed potatoes and a cup of the famous clam chowder for an appetizer. All were incredibly delicious and we gobbled them all up. I was so sad that I had no room for the highly-recommended bread pudding.

We dined at Gallagher's shortly after seeing Zumanity. These two experiences equaled one really awesome night. 

My meal started off with the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom on this particular evening. I love cream of mushroom soup. This soup was just phenomenal. I would bathe in it if I could. The only bad thing I can say about it is it's filling. Naturally you should expect that from a cream based soup. I've been day dreaming about this soup ever since I ate it. 

Next was our steaks. We both ordered the fillet Mignon and I asked for mine to be cooked to medium. I also ordered the red wine sauce to accompany my steak. I checked the online menu to verify the information I was going to include in this review and didn't see the red wine sauce. Nor did I see the macaroni and cheese I seem to remember ordering as a side. I was enjoying some lovely Merlot while at Gallaghers but I don't seem to think I enjoyed enough of it to have imagined the red wine sauce and the amazing mac and cheese (which came with a ""cracker"" of melted cheese on top of it- yum!). So- they must have changed the menu a bit. 

Anyway, the meal was just heavenly. If I had to be picky I'd say my steak was a tad below ""medium"" but it was delicious so who the hell cares.

My family has been coming to Gallagher's Steakhouse since I was eleven years old. We even tried the original Gallagher's in New York and I must say, the meat in Vegas is much tastier! We came here on a Saturday night around 8 pm for my sister's 31st birthday. The food was great (there were some bad dishes, but the server took care of it for us), service was awesome, ambiance was perfect for the celebration and the wine we ordered was on point. 

FOOD: When you come to Gallagher's you HAVE TO GET THE STEAK! The meat is dry-aged for 21 days. You can see the meat refrigerator in front of the restaurant with dates on how long the meat has been dry-aged for. We ordered the following dishes: 

1. Clams, Casino: I was happy the clams weren't over cooked and they did a great job baking the clams perfectly so the inside was still juicy, but the top layer had a nice crunch to it. 

2. Lamb Lollipops: The lamb was medium rare! It was seasoned well, cooked just the way we like it and it had a tasty green sauce on top that made the dish great! 

3. Roasted Beet Salad: If you love beets and is craving a refreshing salad to enjoy, then I highly recommend this dish. The salad was a great serving size for two people to share and gave us a break from all the heavy foods like onion rings, meat, etc. 

4. Center Cut Filet Mignon Medium Rare: I know the place is known for its dry-aged NY strip, but I preferred the filet mignon over the NY. It was so tender, well-seasoned, thick and succulent. I asked for extra candied garlic cloves as well on the side to enjoy with my filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. It's a smaller cut, so it was just the right amount for me. It couldn't have been more than 11 ounces. So if you want a bigger piece of meat, I would suggest the rib-eye. 

5. Dry-Aged New York Strip Bone-In: This dish we originally had some issues with. The cut we received was really grizzly and chewy. My sister's fiancee chewed on the first piece for almost two minutes before finally spitting it out into his napkin. The waiter immediately noticed and gave us a new piece of steak that was dry-aged to perfection, seasoned well with a fine texture and buttery flavor. The fat marbling was excellent! You can also order a side of garlic cloves and the dish went well with the mashed potatoes as well. 

6. Cowboy Rib-Eye: This is the fattiest meat and it came with the bone-in. The rib-eye we received was rich, tender and juicy. It had generous marbling throughout, but primarily on the outside. It was seasoned well, but I am not too fond of too much fat in my meats, so this was my least favorite. I've had better rib-eye elsewhere. 

7. Sides: Mashed Potatoes and Onion Rings. (All dishes are ordered/charged separately). Mashed potatoes was amazing! I wouldn't order the onion rings again. 

8. New England Clam Chowder: I am not sure if I've had better New England Clam Chowder anywhere else in Vegas aside from the Palace Station Oyster Bar. What I love about this dish is it's not too thick, but it isn't watery either. The ratio of clams, potatoes, bacon and veggies was great! It was enough to share between my husband and I. 

SERVICE: AMAZING SERVICE! I always love coming here. The server was so attentive to us. We were seated in a more private area in the other dining room since it was my sister's birthday and the server still kept an eye on us. He switched our NY Strip when he noticed it was inedible. He served all the food within a timely manner and we were never left waiting long. The busser and hostess was also a pleasure to be around.

PRICE: For two appetizers, a salad and soup, three entrees and two sides, the entire bill including tip was around $290, which is not bad. There was 5 of us so it came out to roughly around $58 a person. This is reasonable for the size of all the dishes, service and quality. 

Overall, I love Gallagher's!!! I am excited to come back again for the next family celebration. 

Happy Dining,

I had a reservation for 5:30 and was promptly seated in a mostly empty restaurant.  The waiter was soon at the table with ice water and to take a drink order quickly.

After finding out the weights of the various steaks. I didn't want 18+ ounces in a steak so I ordered their ""signature house-aged bone in sirloin.""  I ordered it cooked blue.  I also ordered a side of the Special Spud.  Last night, it was mashed potatoes with jalapeño pieces, bacon bits, and cheddar cheese.  For dessert I got the Sticky toffee pudding.

I was brought a nice bread basket with two types of bread and some whipped butter.  The server brought my iced tea and it was kept filled throughout the time I was there.  The steak came and it was done exactly the way I like it--nice grill marks on the outside and cold, red on the inside.  It was a good steak.  The Special Spud was very good, probably the highlight of the evening which isn't necessarily a good thing when a side is what you remember your dinner for.  The sticky toffee pudding was good, also.  It came with some whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Service was attentive and pleasant from the time I was greeted at the door to leaving. My server was Bobby and he was a very pleasant gentleman.  I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant and it got to be fun when some more people came in and I could overhear the tourist talk going on.

A solid steakhouse but it's not in my top tier of Las Vegas steakhouses.

Steak was great and the restaurant was accommodating since we pushed back our reservation an hour. The rib eye was huge, (18 oz.) and I was glad with my decision to share it. I always order my steaks medium- rare and more often then not they come out on the medium side instead of the rare side. Gallagher's however, did a great job at nailing the perfect medium-rare. For sides we ordered creamed spinach, broccoli au gratin and mac n cheese. All were fantastic but if you have an aversion to bacon for whatever reason, they put it in their mac. I however, love bacon and thoroughly enjoyed it.

My friend ordered the sea bass, which was their special and it came out quite overdone. We informed the waiter and he took it back immediately, but then shortly after proceeded to tell us thats how ALL the sea bass were coming out.

Maybe it was an off night for them but the fried calamari we had were a little overlooked. Then I had the prime rib and honestly I've had better at half the price.

After talking to the staff I decided to go with flavor and their recommended ribeye steak.  This is my favorite cut which I have had before in other restaurants.  I did not order any sides which are all separately priced as I know the steak should be more than enough.  The steak was delivered and was cooked medium and was hot throughout and pink in the middle.  Sound just right.  While the first bites were delicious, it became tougher and tougher as well as less juicy.  Other rib eyes I've had have been a little thinner cut but much tastier and of better quality.
The service was very prompt and you might expect from a high-end steakhouse with the water glass being filled frequently.

For sides we had the yukon gold puree, very tasty, and green beans, also very tasty. They have a great drink selection, some nice house cocktails (I had the Fire and Ice I believe it was called, a fun mix of cucumber and jalapenos), and the service was great.

The only downside was the location/atmosphere. The entrance is directly from the casino floor, which I tend to like the restaurants set back more from the crowds, but once we were in the restaurant our table was seated far back inside, and it was nice and quiet.

The atmosphere ------ L-O-U-D!!! 

Service was fine.. nothing amazing... or over the top. The guy taking care of us did a nice job. 

The food....

We had the shrimp and grits appetizer.  It was good.. not amazing... just good. 

My wife, who isn't a steak fan, had the chicken.  Again... it was fine... but.. Nothing amazing. 

I had the cowboy rib eye.  It was slightly over cooked.. not tough, but not melt-in-your mouth.....amazing.  Lacked seasoning...  and if I'm 100% honest... I've made rib eyes at home that were as good or better...   the Béarnaise helped along with the onion strips. 

All in all...  the bill was $165 .. not a huge amount but the meal and experience didn't live up to the bill. Not even close... it was a mediocre experience at best. 

My advice... either cook a great cut of steak at home the way you love it... or make reservations at other steak houses in Las Vegas.  This place just didn't do it for us... it didn't live up to the hype IMO.

FYI

*** the only steak they dry age.... is the Dry-Aged New York Sirloin***   the other steaks are not dry aged per the guy serving us.

We shared the 4 cheese macaroni, garlic mash, and asparagus. In the other Yelper photos the asparagus looks woody and unappetizing. Looks are deceiving!! It was delicious and tender!

Best blind choice I have made.  It is not an overly large steakhouse, has a more intimate setting, the staff are AMAZING and the food was fabulous.  There were 4 of us and we ordered for appetizers the seared ahi tuna with melon and the calamari.  The calamari has to be one of the best calamari I have ever had.  Cooked perfectly, a lot of flavor and still so tender.  I didn't even need the dipping sauce, it was too good on its own.  The seared ahi was prepared perfectly and the blend of flavors with the ripe melon and salad was excellent.  It was light and tasty and perfect for summer.

For our main courses we ordered the New York Strip (thickest strip I have ever seen), The porterhouse (very generous), filet mignon and king crab legs.  EVERYONE cleared their plates, my son helped me with the crab, because the order was just too much for me, but they were SO good.

Our side dishes were the onion rings, the special that night: bacon cheddar mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Everything was very good, but the mashed potatoes.. WOW, I could have made that my meal and have been very happy with it.

1 star- Service
1 star- Ambience
1 star- Food
-1 star- Food (I'll explain)

Let me begin with the service. This is by far the highlight of my meal there. The service was impeccable. WE had a really kind genuine waitress who was consistent in checking on us and spoke to us with purpose and interest. There was a separate guy who filled up waters/drinks, who was seriously on his game that night! He was like a ninja! I'll take a swig of my drink and look over into conversation with my party and look back to notice that my glass was refilled.... *cue eary music* *looks around but not a prospect in sight* haha! But that was awesome, some of the best service I have ever had. Extremely accommodating.

Ambience was nice. The place has their lights low and you look around to a pretty restaurant. It feels like a classy night out, given your cutlery, the service, and the uniform the staff is wearing. But the customers are still casual so that sort of brings things back down to earth, which is fine by me.

Ok here we go, Food! I ordered the Cowboy Ribeye Steak, recommended by the waitress, with a side of macaroni and cheese. Now the steak was really good! (Next time I'll probably go Medium). I really enjoyed the steak but when it came down to complimenting it with a side, there were problems. The macaroni and cheese was bland. They attempted it with different noodles and a creamier white cheese but it lacked flavor and even after adding seasoning it just tasted generic. I tried my friend's french fries and I didn't care for those either, to my surprise! It seems like it would be hard to mess those up. They didn't mess it up but they tried a garlic seasoning or something but it ended up tasting bland. In the end I felt secluded to just the steak which was good but I wanted something else with it. For the money I paid for dinner I feel like my whole dinner should have been amazing. It's pretty pricey here guys so your wallet needs to match your hunger here

New York New York is one my favorite casinos, after seeing Gallagher's many times, my wife and I decided to give it a try. We made reservations with some friends and had dinner there on Saturday night. 

Standard steakhouse treatment, prices as expected and the food offering very similar to what other steakhouses offer. Our waiter Derek had a great attitude and he was probably the highlight of the night. Derek suggested that we tried the signature steak, Dry-aged New York steak. We also ordered a wedge salad and sautéed mushrooms to share. After eating the salad my wife fell nauseated and could not even eat her steak, she has to asked for it to be boxed. She is allergic to MSG and nausea is one of the reactions that she gets when eating a food that contains MSG. Do you know if your ranch dressing contains MSG? This is something important as some people are allergic to this product.

My steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor was really good. The mushrooms met the expectations. They served parmigiana and olive bread, they would be better it they were served warm. 

The best part of our meal was the desert, We ordered the Sticky Tootsie was served with vanilla ice cream, it was just spectacular!!! The best desert I have tried in a long time.",auOMH5MegBGf5hVEdbCjTw,2,0,3,Y1VmgLwC-acGF-LVC7cr7g

4249522,2014-10-22,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I was pretty disappointed with the quality of steaks at this steakhouse. I ordered the ""signature"" dry-aged New York Sirloin and my girlfriend ordered the cowboy ribeye. My steak was entirely unimpressive other than being slightly larger than I expected. It was seasoned well but it was hardly tender at all. I could barely taste the unique flavor that dry aging imparts on beef. Not bad enough to send back, though.

My girlfriend's Cowboy ribeye was poorly prepared. It's impressive size couldn't offset the fact that it was a tough, overcooked piece of beef jerky. The seasoning (salt, pepper, butter?) was spot on but I noticed something was off when i saw my girlfriend trying to cut through it like she was using a wood saw. I politely offered to cut it for her and this is when i realized that it was an awful steak. I tried a piece and was stuck chewing it for a good 2 mins. At that point I was tried to convince her that she should send it back. She has very little experience with steak and didn't realize how bad it was especially considering the $42 price tag...just for the steak. She decided to keep eating the dry rubber because it still tasted good but quickly became defeated after her jaw got tired...about halfway through the steak. You might imagine how frustrating it is to watch a server clear away twenty dollars worth of steak. 

We also ordered a side of mushrooms for our steaks that were very tasty. The two things that saved the night from being a complete disappointment -and subsequently earning them a single star rating- was the service and the crabcake appetizers. 

The crabcakes were amazing. EXPENSIVE but amazing ($20 for 3 small cakes). Moist, delicious, and piping hot. Seasoned to perfection. Probably the best crabcakes i've ever had. Seriously.

The service was very impressive as well. Super courteous and very informed. It was almost comical how aware the waitstaff was of the dining area. I accidentally dropped my one of my forks and - being the neanderthal that i am - was just going to wipe it off and keep using it. Before i could even reach to pick it up I had two waiters rushing to my side with a clean one. I saw this happen at another table later that night. They also scrape the crumbs off of the table using a barbershop-style straight edge. Good work guys!

Ultimately, I walked away very disappointed. After a generous tip I had spent nearly $200 for two people and felt a little cheated by the quality of their beef. Not recommended for steak. Everything else was okay.",eCePwx4TNN_ZKQ5dJbiTKA,0,0,2,v7iz2SIIoXlLKSbNUZSVlw

We sit some more before a server comes and asks if wed like a drink? Oh no welcome... Ok. I'll take a cucumber martini and can you bring a wine list. We Order a bottle of wine. 

15 minutes later. He just opens it. No talk about it no introduction. Ok. Great wine. Then asks if were ready. 

I ask about the 1 aged steak this restaurant has. [thank god I know what the aging process is because he didn't explain a thing abut it ]. I asked him if there was any feature. He said nothing except the catch of the day is mahi mahi... Which is weird because it says halibut on the board when you walk in. I asked him what was the seasoning on the fries, he asked me if I had an allergy... Then clearest bullshitted the ingredients. I responded with.... No I just wanted to the seasoning that's in the Steak Cut Seasoned Fries. I basically asked every single questioned that he could have answered had he said one sentence at the table. 

Dinner: 
Wedge.... Boring. Bland. Watered down blu cheese 

Clam chowder.... Yummy one star

Aged strip ..... For the process that steak goes through I was expecting a ton of flavor. Disappointed. 

Veal.... AMAZING ... Another star 

Mushroom medley...    Bland 

Purée...... Bland 

I order a dirty martini for dessert.. I see it just sitting at the bar... So I got up to go get it. Then ordered another drink from the bartender since my server was no where to be found.

We both had filet mignon and lobster, along with a plethora of sides and exclusive cocktails, and this place is worth every penny. It's nearly half the price of the big-name steakhouses both on the Strip and across the valley, but we felt the attention to the food and the service rocketed Gallagher's beyond the competition.
Granted, this place is not cheap. It's for special occasions, but my god: The meat is aged for nearly a month (both wet and dry aging), and the chefs take special care to cook your steak precisely how you like it. These chefs know how to deliver a first-rate steak.
Superb and delicious sides, first-rate drinks, and an attentive (but not hovering) wait staff make this our new Vegas favorite. And we're longtime locals. So you can trust us.

It was soft, tender, lots of juice, buttery, i mean its so perfect.  As far as for Rib Eye, its not as good as the first time.  But it always has the char grilled favor, which really grabs the attention.  My cut wasn't too bad, but it has some party requires extra work to chew.  I have to recommend their crab cakes to anyone who goes there.  Their crab cakes are make from real ALASKAN KING CRAB meat.  I think it really worth the money.

4462555,2009-09-24,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Came to Gallagher's Steakhouse for dinner with my friends while I was here in Las Vegas.  Gallagher's Steakhouse is the high end steakhouse for New York New York Hotel.  The décor here has that feel of an upscale NY dinning establishment.  It's a nice high end feel but comes at a price of that they really pack you so that you're really close to your neighbors and that the acoustics of this Gallagher's is lousy so you have to really speak up in order to talk to the people across from you.

They had our reservations and was able to show us our seats within minutes of arriving.  The menu here is pretty basic and what you would expect from a steakhouse, appetizers such as crab cakes, shrimp or crab cocktails, and bruschetta ranging in the $8 -$12+ range and a range of steaks such as filet mignon, porterhouse, prime rib, and a couple of chops and seafood selection ranging in the $30 - $45.  Also, sides do not come with the meal, so for your veggies, potatoes, and macroni you're looking at spending an additional $6 - $10 each as well as they have 3 sauces to choose from at an additional $2 each.

I decided to get the filet mignon medium and my friends got the prime rib and we decided to share the mash potatoes and the broccoli au gratin.  My friend also got clam chowder which he thought was ok.  When we got our meal, I have to say portion size, I was impressed.  The ""queen"" size prime ribs were huge, my filet mignon was the size of my fist.  The mash potatoes was pretty small, just barely enough to give each of us 1 spoon full, and the broccoli was a decent size head covered in cheese.

Looking forward I cut into my meat and the first bite, over cooked.  It was closer to well done and maybe even a medium well, then a medium.  As I ate my meat, the cooking was so uneven.  I would say only about 15% of the filet mignon was cooked to a medium, the rest of it ranged everywhere from rare to well done.  It wasn't even like it was just the center that was rare, it was just unevenly cooked everywhere.  The only place that was consistant was that the outside was well done.  The pieces that were cooked to a medium was very good and very tender and you can tell the meat quality is there, just the cooking was almost criminal to waste a good piece of meat like that.

My friends also had the same problems.  One got his prime rib medium well, and it was cooked well done.  NO pink to the meat at all.  My other friend just liked the outside with the seasoning and didn't like the center.  They also didn't serve the horseradish or au jus sauce with the prime rib and I know you have to pay extra for the sauce (personally at these prices and paying ala carte, they should just give it to you) but not giving them the au jus to go with the prime rib is a major faux pas.

The sides we ordered were good, probably the small portion of mash potatoes was the best dish of the night.  Very creamy and looks like they put it through a blender to get out all the lumps.  The broccoli, well it was a nicely cooked piece of broccoli with some high end cheese melt on top, it was good, but nothing special.

The service here was friendly for the most part until one of my friends asked to take home his prime rib (he probably only ate about half his food) and it got into this long and weird awkward moment with one of the waiter's assistant asking if he was sure he wanted it wrapped and asked him several times until he finally got it wrapped.

The total bill came out to be about $175 including beers and tips.  Honestly, for that much money, I didn't walk away feeling impressed with Gallagher's Steakhouse.  For the prices you pay for, the cooking quality of the steaks should be much much better.  The ingredients are there, but if you have a guy who can't cook a piece of meat evenly, let alone to a medium, or even know that a medium well prime rib has some pink to it, you're just wasting your money Gallagher's Steakhouse.  High quality ingredients and portion size can only hide so much, you still need to be able to cook.  I would save your money and go else where, 2 stars for Gallagher's Steakhouse for their high quality ingredents and not much else.",BclQLeF-geeAYb5Re98thA,4,0,2,Ga34zQNdz7rzoezvEE0VTg

Urban Dictionary describes meat sweats as:  To consume an obsene amount of meat resulting in perfuse sweating.

I got the meat sweats just watching an insane amount of meat being consumed.  One King Cut Prime Rib, about the size of a small dinosaur, landed with a thud on our table.  It was then I understood why my friend didn't order any sides.  This steak was  going to be a challenge.  

Another challenge unfortunately, was understanding the price tag.  I get it.  Fine dining atmosphere, dry aged beef and fresh seafood.  To me it was a fluffed up steakhouse.  Not bad, but not outstanding enough to shell out that kind of dough again.  

Located inside the New York New York Hotel and Casino right near the main entrance.  The restaurant is completely open facing the commotion of the casino passers by.  The bar wraps around so you can have a drink while waiting for a table.  It's decorated with photos of famous New York alumni covering the walls.  You can take a look at the steak they use in a window outside, dry aging under bright lights.  Looks like something out of Dexter.  We made an Open Table Reservation and we were seated right on time.  It took a few minutes to be acknowledged after we sat down, but our waiter was pleasant and fun once he arrived.  

I ordered the Filet and my boyfriend ordered the Dry Aged New York Sirloin.  Both our steaks were the wrong temperature.  I don't normally eat meat, so an under cooked steak is cringe-worthy to me.  I toughed through it because we needed to be at a concert.  The soup I ordered was a beer cheese soup and it was probably the highlight of my meal, along with the side of mushrooms I ordered.  The asparagus tasted like pure butter and they were cold.  Then a family sat down next to us and we watched a little kid eat a filet with ketchup.. oh boy.  It was cute that the waiter cut the steak for him though.

Man Vs. Food challenge:  Food wins!  Defeated my friend Geno, but made a homeless man on the bridge grin from ear to ear.  He was eating good that night.",_QyxWXoCVVBvNUl6s9u9lQ,7,7,3,CeFVy0Et0rskkiTPiTKiVQ

We originally booked a reservation here because it was around the corner from the Zumanity show that we had tickets for. The hostess we originally talked to was very polite and informative letting us know that a 9:30 pm booking was probably the best time since our show was for 7:30. At this point, we had high hopes for this place. 

The day of our booking we called to confirm our reservation and the hostess hung up on my bf mid sentence saying, ""No we don't have a booking under that name."" Confused, I called back, and they eventually found our name. I wanted to make sure I received the check since it was my bf's b-day weekend. She said ""Ok"" then hung up without asking me which of the 4 people under our reservation that I was. 

Our server was ok...but obviously didn't get the message about the check. (Surprise Surprise) When we asked for our check she threw it down next to my bf. Of course if he sees the check he's going to try to pay for it!!! It was his birthday, this is what I was trying to avoid!",QXmsX770P7GhYhGlCnwLiw,4,1,2,4EMDtLlMwkDK2Xc63zgBhQ

Yes, mi amigos, after nearly 12 years of sippin' on the purple drank in Houston, it is time for me & the H-town hubby to head west and live the quiet life in boring ol' Vegas.  Hmmm... whatever will a girl do for fun??

Well, for one, it's time to get my Yelp back on, and start wining & dining out more often.  Our official landing date is November 19 - Vegas, you have been warned!

Anyway, where was I?  Oh yeah, Gallagher's.  Well, we were staying at New Yawk New Yawk while finalizing the close on our new casa (maybe you've heard of it - some might call it The Bellagio - word!), so the natural spot for a feast fit for a king & queen was their high end steakhouse.  Yes, you drop some significant coin here, but it is totally worth it.  Hubby's filet was top 10 all-time, my food (whatever the heck I ordered) was really good, and both the beer & wine selection met our approval.  Plus, the bartender was super nice to us when we finished up our post-dinner cocktails at their bar.

4733044,2008-04-06,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I really love this place. I've been here a lot, though not recently I must admit. The decor is classic NY steakhouse, with wooden panels and waistaff in black and white.

I usually stick with the NY Steak and it generally comes perfectly cooked to order. I've dined with people who have also had the porterhouse and cowboy steak (both good for sharing ... actually, they're all good sizes for sharing except maybe the filets). 

The appetizers, salads, and sides are not spectacular and is classic steakhouse fare (e.g., shrimp cocktail, iceberg lettuce wedge, creamed spinach, sauteed haricot verts, asparagus). I do enjoy the spinach salad. That's not to say they don't taste good, but just not beyond all levels of deliciousness. The sides don't really bother me because the focus is on the STEAK! (please see update below re mac n cheese!)

For dessert, I like to get their sticky toffee pudding. It's very moist, sticky, and delicious. Some restaurants who serve this classic dessert tends to somehow make the cake dry. The rest of their dessert menu is very standard types of desserts and not special (though, again, they taste just fine). But if you're in the casino, you might want to poke on over to Il Fornaio for one of their desserts!

I can also count on the waitstaff for excellent service. I've never felt forgetten at this restaurant. The bartenders are also excellent and know what they're doing! Ask for a chocolate martini ... trust.

UPDATE 8/17/2009: Went back recently and they had a new mac n cheese side. It is HEAVENLY! You must try it! Also, a few people told us a story about the sticky toffee pudding. Apparently, it was the recipe of the original chef and though he has left the restaurant, customers loved it so much that they asked him to allow them to keep the recipe. :)

The food was great. As an appetizer we started with the shrimp and grits...yummy!We both ordered the filet mignon, the onion rings, and the mushroom medley. Everything was al a carte but just the right amount of food. We both left satisfied, not overly stuffed. 

The in house photographer was a strange but fun added bonus. She actually took really nice pictures of us. The only part I didn't like was the fact that she brought them back to us as actual prints. It would make more sense to have them on an iPad or tablet and then print the ones people want. It seemed wasteful and weird to think about where the prints go if we don't buy them. We bought one and the lady who took the pictures was really nice and not pushy about trying to get us to buy them.",WaK9MJBU_roT9ZgjDNor2A,0,0,4,SH7xOvHby7uWObiaAPk0wQ

this was THE BEST PRIME RIB i've ever had to date.  WOW..  i got the queen's cut of prime rib medium rare.  it was HUGE and cooked to perfection.  there was a choice of creamy or straight horseradish.  i had the straight -- the strongest, best horseradish.  see the theme??

THE APPETIZERS
MARYLAND CRABCAKES
delish!!  3 crabcakes with real crabmeat drizzled with mayonnaise chipotle.

GRILLED ARTICHOKE
an artichoke cut in half.  there were two kinds of mayonnaise to dip the artichoke in -- garlic or chipotle.  thoroughly enjoyed this appetizer.

THE SIDES
CREAMED SPINACH -- good but not spectacular
MASHED POTATOES -- would have been better if they were garlic-flavor or horseradish flavored, etc.  just plain.

THE MEAT
COWBOY RIB EYE -- HUGE cut of meat.  i tried some but my love is prime rib...
QUEEN'S CUT PRIME RIB -- the BEST PRIME RIB i've ever had.  medium rare is the way to go if you are a meat lover like me.  i REALLY REALLY ADORE my meat.  and yes, i did finish the WHOLE thing.

boo...on not having ANY appetite for dessert.  i wanted to try dessert but so could not.  in fact, i had overeaten to the point where i could not gamble either.  LOL..

MY ADVICE:
prime rib lovers get the prime rib.  you can share the king's cut between two people.  i would go with appetizers vs. the sides.  and of course, bring a GIGANTIC appetite cuz you'll need it!!!  ENJOY..

4946799,2012-09-28,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"I told my girlfriend that all I wanted for my birthday was a steak dinner and she booked us a reservation at Gallagher's at NY NY in Vegas. We walked in and the table was ready right away and it has the complete feel of a traditional steak-house and one that would be home in downtown Manhattan (or so I imagine what that would look like). We started with oysters and crab salad. The oysters were good but the crab was incredible. Very fresh and lots of meat. I would get the crab salad again any day of the week.

I had ordered a filet mignon medium rare and it was cooked a little on the medium side but it still had it's rare-ish quality that made it juicy. My girlfriend, who is not a big steak eater, ordered the house steak with hollandaise sauce. Normally, I'm weary of steak places that offer sauce on their steak. call me old-fashioned, but I was raised in the school of a good steak doesn't need anything added to it. Save for a little garlic butter, but other than that, grill it and give it to me as is. However, as she ordered it medium-well, having the sauce there was a good option. The steak was still delicious and, more importantly, she loved it.

Lastly, an odd encounter happened there that made our trip funny as hell. So we were sitting next to each other and a group of older gentlemen sat next to us. On their way out, they slipped us a note saying that we were a cute couple and to save room for dessert and to try the ""sticky toffee pudding"". But the way they phrased the note, left room for multiple interpretations. So we called the waiter over, explained what happened and he laughed and gave us his opinion as to what he thought the note meant. He apologized for the enounter, and we assured him it wasn't a big deal at all, we just thought it was funny. He said it would have made more sense if they had actually bought us a dessert, but they didn't, so he had no clue what they were talking about. HOWEVER, when dinner was done, the waiter came over with the sticky toffee pudding and gave it to us on the house as a means of apologizing for his other table. It was completely unneccessary, but amazing customer service. The food gets 4 stars, the dessert was INCREDIBLE and gets 5 stars, but the service there gets 10 stars. I work in sales and appreciate good customer service and attention to detail and was VERY impressed with these guys.

We had some friends in town over the Memorial Day weekend, and hit up Gallagher's Thursday night.  Very, very glad we did.  The table shared many appetizers, and in my estimation, the Maryland crab cakes, blackened shrimp and blackened scallops were the winners.  And, for $18 you got a very good size portion, 4 of each.  I would say the amount of food in the appetizers was atypical for a steakhouse.  The sear on the cakes was textbook, and the sauce was excellent.  Same with the scallops.  The shrimp were very large, perfectly cooked.  They are served over cheesy grits, but not too much.  Just enough that you can get bites of shrimp and grits together.  The blackening is fantastic, I think they should expand this and make it a full entree.  Very good shrimp.

To eat, I had the bone in ribeye, which comes with a load of fried onions.  This was a fantastic steak, the dry aging is really noticeable.  The depth of flavor is much greater than in other steaks.  A member of our party had the pork chop, which I thought was solid but dry.

The 4 cheese macaroni was a big hit.  The sauce is not too thick, but had excellent cheesy flavor.  The onion rings were very crunchy, but a serving only has 4 large ones as I recall.  Difficult to share, we had to cut a couple in half.  This would have been nice to know when ordering, we probably would have ordered a second helping to make sure everyone got a full ring.

The wine list was good, I would say average for a strip steakhouse.  Service was fantastic.  Very friendly and not overbearing.

He carved every shred of meat from the bone and when he was done, pointed to the bone and said ""I'm gonna miss you.""  I've eaten a lot of steaks with this guy and that was definitely a first. I almost thought he would start tearing up over it. 

We also got a Caesar salad, Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the side on special that night, mashed cheesy potatoes with bacon.

So I heard about this steakhouse from my dad, claiming it was the best steakhouse in Vegas, and while I haven't actually been to any others, I do have to agree with him that it was very good.

I had the new york steak (35 dollars) a side of onion rings (7 dollars) and a glass of New Castle (8 dollars) which brought my total for dinner to like 50 dollars plus tax and tip. I'm not a huge spender on food, so 50 bucks is a pretty big drop in the bucket for me to eat, but overall I was very pleased with the food. The steak (cooked medium) came out perfect and was almost all meat (very little fat for a New York) and the onion rings were literally huge, not like the cheap kind you get at a fast food restaurant. Service was great. Our waiter happened to be originally from CA too, so he identified with a couple of guys in Vegas for the weekend and the food came out in a good amount of time.

Once seated in had alerted the server that we are in a slight time crunch because we were going to go see kaskade after dinner. And he was understanding and got right to our order so we can leave on time. We got crab cakes for an appetizer to start and my hubby got the dry aged steak (and with bernaise sauce) with an Australian lobster tail, and I got the rack of roasted lamb and we were going to share a side of mash potatoes. 

The food was cooked perfectly, my lamb was extremely tender and practically falling off the bone, and my hubby loved his meal as well the only down side for him was he asked if he could get the main lobster tail instead of the Australian lobster tail but they couldn't do that. And personally we just prefer the Maine lobster because it's sweeter and more succulent. You must get the bernaise sauce if you get the steak, it takes the steak to a completely different level, it makes it so much better. The crab cakes was great and so was the mash potatoes.

To be fair, his prime rib put the largest serving at House of Prime Rib in San Francisco to shame, dwarfing the plate it arrived on. Our server started us off with seriously delicious cranberry walnut bread and a fluffy standard house loaf. The butter came room-temperature and lightly whipped, perfect for spreading. 

My filet mignon was tender and flavorful. As our server warned, the middle was a bit more rare than I usually expect for med-rare. I finished it easily without an additional sauce, but enjoyed a few pieces with the horseradish offerings that W requested with his prime rib. Notably, there were a few cuts that were sinewy and difficult to hack through with my knife, which was a bit dull. 

For the price of our cuts, I was surprised at how sparse they arrived. Our server recommended selecting 2-3 sides to share between the four of us. Thank goodness we did, because the filet mignon only came with a fried cassava/taro/? chip and some peppery mach lettuce. French green beans were garlicky and crisp, and mushrooms were cheesy and rich. 

Seated across from the kitchen, we could see that the bruschetta was an understandably popular appetizer. The diced tomato glistened like small jewels from the baguette slices on the counter.

5115441,2015-07-08,0,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"A five, a five, and another five. So many fives. Gallagher's is so good. Simply put, probably the best steak I've ever eaten.

The menu claimed that the aged Strip was their trademark, but I went ahead and ordered a filet mignon. A few moments after I regretted my decision, but after taking a bite, I was really glad that I ordered what I did. The filet mignon has an incredible crust on the outside, and my steak was cooked just about as I ordered it (medium rare) on the inside. I say ""just about"" because parts of mine were a bit rare, but not raw, so I wasn't at all picky about it. I also opted to get their chowder as an appetizer, had a side of green beans with my steak, and tried the calamari -- which was my first time ever having it. Oh yeah, I also had some mac and cheese.

All really excellent. If you haven't eaten calamari, I'll just tell you that (at least in this case) it's a very mild almost nonexistent flavored flavor with a slightly chewy but tender texture to it. The appearance of tentacles may gross you out if you order it, but trust me, it's good eats. The mac and cheese was also great and had a nice little bitterness to it to keep the already rich cheese from being over the top. I often tend to much prefer baked mac and cheese, but Gallagher's is some of the best non-baked mac and cheese I've had. The chowder was delicious as well, and was probably my favorite I've ever had until I wound up having some in Seattle, but that's for another review. I really liked the fact that it was a bit on the thinner side, because super thick chowders just aren't my thing. I didn't get much of a bacon flavor, but I did get a bacon smokiness which was fantastic.

Gallagher's is expensive. If you couldn't guess that by it being a steakhouse in Vegas, you'd hopefully guess it based on the look of the place. I will tell you that everything about Gallagher's is phenomenal. It was a bit too warm for comfort sitting next to the kitchen, but everything about it was awesome. I'd like to try another ""fancy"" restaurant the next time in Vegas, but it'd be hard for me to go somewhere other than Gallagher's when I know it's so damn delicious.",rFeXxtCeAGtWNdDWEu9I2A,1,0,5,cpVlKrg3LFUq7VefNQTtCg

From the beginning we were greeted by a friendly hostess and did not have to wait due to our reservation. Once seated, we were welcomed by a courteous, friendly and informative waiter. We asked for recommendations on the drinks, appetizers, and the steaks. Some were taken and others were not. I ordered the raspberry lemon drop martini, rimmed with sugar, the drink was delightful and hubby ordered his normal drink of an old-fashion with Jim Beam. Our appetizer, a waiter recommendation, was the oyster rockefeller, this appetizer was so good, it came with six sweet oysters topped with a spinach bread crumple and delicious cheese. We squeezed some lemon on top and they were gone before we blinked, great recommendation. 

Our second round of drinks, I ordered the Moscow mule, I'm a big fan of the floral notes and ginger beer in mules and the hubby ordered a blue moon. I ordered the pear& walnut salad, this was good but not great, plating and presentation could be better. My other half had the Caesar salad, same thoughts. Our main meals included petite filets and Australian lobster topped with crab. Our streaks were cook to our specifications, flavorful and tender but the star of the night was the lobster, so fluffy white and buttery...melt in ur mouth good!

What a great steakhouse find! If you're coming here for the prime rib, which we were, there's no need to order anything else. I've had my fair share of prime rib in the city and this one was probably the biggest cut that we've seen. 

First off, service was super friendly and helpful. The amount of staff they had was impressive. Since they don't serve the king cut of prime rib to share anymore, we both ordered one separately (i was starving). I got mines medium since they said in general it was on the rarer side. Super pleased when it came out; nice presentation and juicy. 

DO NOT FORGET THE HORSE RADISH SAUCE! They give you a soft creamy version and a solid form and they were just out of this world.

Sort of a late anniversary dinner for Josie and I. We had 515pm reservations and arrived early and were seated within minutes of arrival. The host was quite friendly and evoked a great starting conversation setting the mood for our dinner. Bryan was our waiter and had a great knowledge of the menu and specials. I know you are wondering (did drink service come quick?) it did. We had waters in just a few moments and our drink order was taken. We also ordered our appetizer of seared Ahi Tuna.Seasoned quite well with a creole type seasoning and braised just perfectly. It came with some melon slices and other seasonal fruits. We also then ordered a salad round. I had the house wedge with blue cheese Josie had the beet salad. The wedge reminded me of my first ever wedge at a place in Henderson Nevada, Nick's Supper Club. (NOSTALGIA). Perfect amount of the Blue Cheese dressing with small tomatoes and a couple croutons. Josie said the beet salad was perfectly dressed and had great flavor.our main course, their aged bone in New York Steak, was a perfect medium rare with no outside seasoning just the grilled natural flavor that awoke the carnivore inside me. We shared the steak so we could enjoy a full meal without left overs and feeling over stuffed. Our sides were Mac-n-Cheese and creamed spinach. Neither were overwhelming in taste. They did have good seasoning and flavor. We did not have time or room for desert but want to go back because the menu looked really inviting.
Thank you for eating at Gallagher's Steakhouse. We will likely go back and try a few items we saw that looked really good. The staff was hard working and friendly.

the steak..... the steak was underwhelming to say the least. the price really sets you up for disappointment. for a steak worth 50+ dollars, you end up expecting nothing but excellence. what you actually get is a decent cut of meat with a slightly bland flavor. i am no expert but i am sure that steak can taste better than this.

there are no sides included to the steak so we ended up ordering a side of mac and cheese. again, pretty bland. we also had another side that i have a difficult time remembering - which indicates that it's not worth the mention anyway.

We were seated next to a lady who was dining by herself, but man everything this lady ordered looked legit. So I turned to her and said you are eating like a Queen! Apparently, she was some high roller that comes to Vegas every three months and she only eats at this steak house. We have dined at Craft, Heritage Steaks, and Del Frisco on past trips, so I was very excited to try a new steak house.

Preston was our waiter and he was awesome! The next time we are back in Vegas I am asking to be seated in his section. He helped us with the menu and showed us what the more popular items were. We started with the crab cakes and the wedge salad. Both were delicious. Bread service came out and I really enjoyed the cranberry bread. 

For our entrees we got the rack of lamb and the filet and lobster tail, along with a side of creamed cauliflower. Everything was devine! I was so stuffed, and literally for a split second thought I would need to skip dessert. That is until the high roller lady next to us got the sticky toffee pudding. And she saw my eyes on it, and said you had better order it because it's divine.

And with that, we closed the meal out with the sticky toffee pudding and I did not regret the thousands of calories we consumed that night.",QQda13KQSGtBMkFx05Iw5Q,2,0,5,1iLSCTFLrYtu7xY3_pnuUA

It is one thing to recommend a place to strangers and coworkers, and quite another to recommend a place to your *boss* and then bring him there. Never mind bringing HIS boss with you, too. No pressure, right?

I made a reservation for part of our team following a long day of work at a conference in the Mandalay Bay. We needed to get out for some air and had spent nearly a week cooped up in the convention center. I thought I knew just the place and made a reservation online using OpenTable. 

Our table was ready at the reservation time, and our server, John, was fantastic. We were seated at the ""chef's table"" in the kitchen area -- which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on the restaurant and the people you're with. It turned out for us to be a good thing and we'll request that next time (it is a U-shaped booth that holds 7 people). Some of the people weren't as hungry, so they decided to split a steak and some appetizers. I just wanted the signature NY strip that I remembered. 

The place was crowded, and it took a little time to get the food, but I don't think we were ever left wondering or looking at our watches. If you're in a hurry, though, this may not be the place for you. Good takes time, so be prepared to be patient :)

All of our steaks were cooked perfectly and the shrimp+grits appetizer was a group favorite. I'm not a shrimp person, but those ""shrimp"" were like little lobster tails! The side dishes were reasonable priced, and I recommend the mac and cheese with bacon in it if they have it. The peppercorn sauce was a few bucks more, but it was a nice accompaniment to my steak. There was enough to share, so I did, and those who tried it enjoyed it as well. 

Beware the fresh horseradish with the prime rib -- it is pretty potent. 

You'll have a big piece of meat, but be sure to save room for the toffee pudding... even if you have to share it like we did. 

For the quality of service and food, the price we paid was more than reasonable and we will definitely be back when we are in town again next year. Thank you John for taking care of us!",QkNuVpkhV_wTApylrKOMDg,3,1,5,4L3nZfwp94jAormKkhbF-A

The place was LOUD, my boyfriend and I basically had to shout to hear each other which is what I would expect from a bar, but not from a nice restaurant. Our server was nice...when she would actually take the time to come to our table. It seemed as if as soon as we came in she pegged us as a young couple that wouldn't be able to afford a large tab, and therefore she wouldn't give us any sort of priority the whole night when she had bigger fish to fry. Their cocktails were very good at least. My boyfriend got steak, and I ordered the roasted chicken and I also ordered a side of green beans (at steakhouses like this, it is common for your main dish to not come with any sides at all). When the food came, my plate had roasted chicken, rice, and green beans on it, and another large side of green beans was brought along with it. I was a bit peeved with this as the menu description of my entree had not indicated that it would come with rice or green beans...or with anything, really. I thought that it was wrong of our waitress to not let me know that my plate already came with green beans on it, and that she had let me order an expensive side of green beans anyways. When I confronted our waitress, she was kind and apologetic and said that she would remove the green beans from our ticket. She then picked up the side of green beans and before taking them away, she said that if she had known that my chicken was supposed to come with green beans that she would have let me know. I don't know how you can work in such a high-ticket restaurant and not know if your main dishes come with sides or not....if you work in such an expensive restaurant, you should really know the menu. At least the green beans were tasty, the chicken ended up being dry, the rice overcooked, and Paul's steak's marinade was overpowering and not very good.

Ordered Calamari as an appetizer, it was very good but waiter didn't bring the sauce we asked to go with it until after it was finished.

Had their Rib-Eye, which the server Derek recommended over the Sirloin. It was a thick-cut, easily 20oz, and looked amazing when it came out. I found mine to be slightly undercooked (med-rare over med) however, and more importantly devoid of seasoning which was addressed by some salt and pepper (though sea-salt pre-fire would have been ideal).

The meat was somewhat chewy/tough in spots (easily spotted without cutting into the steak), which I understand is common in certain cuts of meat but would have thought they would have selected better (never had a bad cut at Morton's or Ruth Kris, could always cut theirs with fork alone), but perhaps I just got ""unlucky"" with mine this time. Mashed potatoes were excellent.

I promised myself that the next time I return, I'll throw a ridiculous bet on the hardway's with a couple of black chips in hopes the dice will hit the 10-1.  Haha, well don't get too excited cause it didn't happen, yet, that is...BUT instead I scored something just as good as I was kidnapped to celebrate a quick birthday overnighter in Sin City and to finally try one of Gallagher's steaks. 

So why this place...?
Dry-Aged beef is what we're talkin' bout peeps...that's right, not sticking a piece of meat in a vacuum-sealed bag that apparently also ""ages"" faster and in hopes to trim and reduce its water weight, hence the controversy of why very many steakhouses don't use the classical dry-aged process. As we all know time is money. Catch my drift...? 

At Gallagher's, its old school ""aging'...We're talking countless hours and days of beef being stored in a special dry-aging cooler where a complex chemical reaction process that involves an intricate equilibrium of time, temperature, and the right humidity so that the beef's enzymes begins to break down and tenderize the meat. In return, Gallagher's delivers to you one of the utmost tender and most flavorful steak you'll ever eat. BOOM! 

The Eats:
Main Course:
Dry-Aged New York Sirloin $43 
Cowboy Rib-Eye Steak $45     slightly burnt edges (-.5)
Sauteed Wild Mushrooms and Carmelized Onions $2 each
Yukon Gold Potato Puree $8  meh. (-.5)

Ambiance:
Dim lighting, tranquil noise level, semi-formal attire (Sported a Hawaiian shirt =P)

If you haven't tried dry aged meat you owe it to yourself to try it at least once, it has an ""earthy"" type that you'll either love or hate. I've had it once before and really liked it, my wife wasn't sold on the idea so she ordered a non-dry aged filet and enjoyed that. 

The place was crowded but not totally full on a Monday night around 8:30, they use Open Table so I just made a reservation through there. This place has more of a steakhouse feel than some other places in Vegas hotels/casinos. They bring you a side of a couple types of bread and butter which is enjoyable enough. I added a tomato and heart of palm salad which is one of the best salads I've had in a long time. As for the main course, the dry aged bone-in NY strip is their signature and it's a monster at around 18oz. I made a valiant effort but couldn't quite finish it. This is the best steak I've had in quite awhile and the dry aging isn't just hype, you can really taste the difference. As for the sides, the green beans were okay but nothing special so I'd pass on them next time. I was stuffed after my meal but split a slice of good but not amazing cheesecake, it's worth a try if you're wanting dessert.

All of us were alluded to the 21-day, dry aged New York cut, that raw steak dry aging outside of the restaurant was just speaking to us. We had mashers and Steamed Asparagus w/ Hollandaise for sides. When the steak was revealed, I was surprised how big a New York cut can be, it was almost like a Porterhouse cut from some steakhouses! My steak was perfectly made (medium), and upon first bite the flavor form being dry-aged 21 days is absolutely present. And the presence of that flavor is still apparent up to the middle of the meat, unheard off especially on less fatty cuts of steak. I guess one trade off with have a wonderfully flavored steak is toughness. Yes, this New York cut is tougher than the usual New York cuts I have had from other restaurants. That's some tradeoff because for me, texture is equally important as flavor in steaks. Also their steamed asparagus were overcooked, less apparent (but still overcooked) when our server exchanged it for a new one. The machers were simply delicious.

The sides were not bad but to me were too small of a serving compared to other restaurants.

5483047,2014-01-02,2,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"What a wonderful experience I had at Gallaghers Steakhouse. 

First of all, you have to make a reservation. This is one of those places that gets booked fast. I don't think you have to necessarily book months in advance but definitely call ahead if you're planning to eat that day. 

Came here for New Years and while the prices were generally $20+ more than usual, everything was simply delicious. We ordered the rib eye, prime rib, lamb chops, signature aged steak, Alaskan halibut, the seafood celebration and a salad. ($650+)

Every dish was super tasty, but I personally preferred the rib eye. it was literally melt in your mouth delicious I went to heaven status. The rub on that meat was amazing and it was just done very well. Then I would rank the rest in this order: chops, aged signature and the prime rib. The prime rib is a huge chunk of meat, and I ranked it last (although it's pretty neck in neck) because it didn't taste anything too remarkable, not to say that it wasn't tasty. It's also probably the cheapest because they cook a huge chunk of meat and then slice into portions as opposed to say the rib eye, where they have to cook each cut individually. The rib eye was just spectacular and memorable. Take my advice and order this if you're stuck wanting to order everything, you'll thank me later. 
Another note, don't order the signature aged steak in medium, we made the mistake of doing so and it turned out just a bit toooo dry for our liking. 

Our waiter was also superb, putting up with my family's desire to take a hundred family photos before we can even begin eating. What a great restaurant, every pennies worth.",U0Be1j5f0On9DrV3TPmZZQ,2,0,5,TDa1fc0CfbXtoQOnoZNFpQ

So let's start with the ambiance....beautiful wooden floors, white table clothes, with all the silverware settings. It's kind of tight as you walk through, especially if there's a sporting event going on. My husband and I were promptly greeted and seated as we'd reserved ahead. Our initial hostess was very professional, warm and accommodating. As we were being seated our server pulled out my chair (my husband has an injured hand) and even assisted my husband with getting comfortable. My only complaint thus far is the restaurant is extremely tight, my chair was almost pressed against a door which separated the dinning area. So we ordered the crab cakes to start. The crab cakes weren't over filled with stuffing. There was a little crust like panko crumbs but the crab balls were filled with succulent blue crab. Please be aware, you will have a server but multiple staff will help you throughout your meal. Our drinks never went lacking! And even though it took a moment to familiarize myself with each person servicing us, they were all very kind, efficient, and accommodating. My husband ordered the prime rib. His only complaint is that he prefers it seared, Gallagher's prime rib is prepared in the oven, but the texture and flavor was dead on. Did I mention how LARGE it was. What stepped Gallaghers game up was when our server offered to cut my husbands prime rib. I was blown away by his compassion, service, and generosity as the restaurant was packed. To compliment his Prime Rib we ordered Mac and Cheese and the Sautéed Spinach. The spinach was perfect. The Mac and cheese had a chees sauce, so if you're a southern girl like me you'll tolerate it but you know it can't compete with over baked mac and cheese. Even if you cooked it like a soufflé. Moving on I order the Porterhouse! My steak by far was the highlight of my meal. The cut was extremely generous, the beautiful grill marks, with a little blood drippings on the top. We shared our sides, and there was no way I could eat any desert. If you're looking for exceptional service you want to give them a try.",kXUTPYPulutu85qUUX48dg,0,0,4,Npvcwyp-G5rXO2C1VVy_Ew

From the moment we walked in, the staff was professional but friendly and were seated right away. As you look around, there are pictures of iconic figures all around. We were seated in a back room, walking through a half full main area near the bar, then past an empty area to a back room. I jokingly said to the hostess ""Did you hear about us? Is that why we are going to the back all alone?"" She told me that they just opened this area. I countered with ""If no one else is seated in this area in 10 minutes, we are moving to the main area."" Would you want to sit in a giant room all alone? Sure enough another couple was seated near us and the hostess just smiled and winked at me. 

Dinner was a Rib-eye for me with crispy onion strings and the house specialty, the Sirloin.  We also ordered green beans and steak fries.

Just go easy on the horseradish or you'll be making ""wasabi burning face"" in about 5 minutes like I did.

My wife got the filet mignon as usual and it was really meh.  Ruth's Chris serves a better filet than Gallagher's.  Sides were fine.  We got sauteed spinach which was nice and buttery along with the 4 cheese mac.

Service was fine.  I thought it was funny that the server really went out of his way to let us know off the bat that everything was a la carte.  

And even though I gush about the prime rib, I never go to nice steakhouses to eat it.  You can do much better for an average price of $40 a steak elsewhere in town.

Maybe it was because it was just awesomely good.

I don't generally enjoy the NYNY casino, so I tend to not go in.  I was brought here by Zumanity though, attending with my girlfriend.  And since the love of her life is meat, the choice on where to eat was easy.

It all started with the drink.  A Manhattan.  I subbed olives, because maracschino cherries make me cringe.  And I got blue cheese olives, and a beautiful Manhattan.  I ended up getting 2 more, and the waiter complimented me on my drinking.  Haha.  He made me feel like a real boy!

So we got sauteed mushrooms and some steaks.  I went with the prime rib.  There's something magical about a perfectly seared steak, sure.  But I can't roast a rack of ribs at home.  And the slightly more cooked bits on the edge of the roast make a great salty counterpoint to the moist, tender, juicy middle bits.  Plus it comes with meat juice on the side.  Love me some meat juice.  Jen really liked her steak too.

5677681,2011-02-05,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"It's Vegas. I'm a SoCal native and Vegas is ALWAYS a weekend option especially since it's only a few hour drive away. Minus all the obvious reasons one of the big attractions for me has always been food. Whether it's finding the next best buffet, a unique cuisine or just some top notch high end restaurants all concentrated into a small area. One thing I try to always do when getting into Vegas is to find a new steakhouse. Well this time around I was recommended to Gallagher's. 

First off it's a welcome change to enter a steakhouse not feeling out of place with everyone dressed up as if they were going ballroom dancing. We were seated for a table of eight. It was quite early and we had a 8PM dinner reservation. We are all meat eaters so our table had center cut filets, new york sirloin, queen cut prime rib and for myself the cowboy ribeye steak. Minutes later they came back to tell us they ran out of prime rib. I mean it's barely a quarter past 8pm. Whatever they proceeded to change their order to a steak instead. 

But back to my steak. I like it ""Black and Blue."" Now there are some places that I will make sure they know what I'm talking about but these type of high end restaurants with this high of a rating I would imagine they would know. Also my server took my preference without skipping a beat. Normally if the case I will be asked for an explanation if they don't know. When brought out of course it was clearly not black and blue but it was rare. I told the server that this was not ""Black and Blue"" and that it was rare. She proceeded to tell me ""That is how OUR black and blue is."" What the hell does that mean? Now I can eat my steak medium rare (normally cheaper or skinnier steaks) and I can eat it rare also but it's my least choice. The funny thing was that she didn't even offer to send it back to have it redone, she instead stared at me with a long pause as though to say, just eat the damn thing. I hate sending food back, possibly fear from the movie ""Waiting"" and stories from friends. So I just kept it. It tasted like wet beef. It's almost as if they kept it in a bucket of water overnight threw on the grill and slapped it on my plate. For my side I had creamed spinach which was more cream then there was spinach. This is a first also, I did not finish my steak. Blasphemy!!! It was simply that bad. You might be thinking hey you got it rare, well shoot I've had it rare many places and have loved it. 

The highlight of the night was simply the spirits menu which was a lit up menu that at first I thought it was a touch screen but it wasn't. The wine was excellent that was chosen by the server but do not remember the name, simply because I was so upset about my meal. Everyone else had similar opinions being average but nothing spectacular. 

When it comes down to it the food was not even ok. I'm surprised this place is still here with so many steakhouses popping up in Vegas now you can easily walk down the street and find another prime steakhouse. The two stars is almost out of sympathy since the only reason the second star is there is my wine and scotch. Either way it's hard to want to give this place a second chance again since there are so many other options available. Maybe once I've exhausted all other places and I make my rounds again I might give this place a try if I'm stuck at NYNY or have won a few black chips while at the table.",O9ZYUjNzidzWKuumusFojA,0,0,2,suqKNBe9PyXT_dsnPXQREw

5722791,2009-02-24,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Probably the place I enjoyed eating at most in Vegas, though also likely some of the worst service I had.

Let's hit the bullet points. Steakhouse in NY-NY. Pricey, but not excessively so (especially for Vegas).  Great food, meh atmosphere, and while I personally had poor service, my impression was that in general, the service is very good.

My dinner partner and I both had filet mignon - very, very good.  We also split a side of mac and cheese.  Not only was it enough to share (though probably not so much that you'd be a pig if you ate the whole thing yourself), but it was absolutely amazing.  Served in a metal pot, with some kind of crust baked on top... I enjoyed it as much as the steak, and I love steak, and it was a good steak.  The meat also came with one giant potato chip, which I thought was unique, if weird.  Also, not the best potato chip I've ever had, but then, I'm partial to pringles.

My one real gripe was that we asked our waiter for information on the size of the steak - and we were told 20 ounces, with a large bone.  This seemed odd to us, and, indeed, when our neighbor's  waiter came by, he gave a spiel going through the whole menu, the specials, the sizes of the steaks,etc, and it was an 8 ounce cut of meat, which seemed to make a bit more sense.  I wouldn't have minded the nice menu rundown.  I totally had waiter envy.

Also, while fantastic, the meal was over a hundred dollars.  Not terrible, I guess, but we didn't have drinks, desserts, appetizers... even separate sides.  And the atmosphere isn't what I would expect for that.  It's dark, but not especially romantic, and at least where we were sitting it was hard to forget we were in the middle of a casino.  I'd prefer to have had a little more of an escape.

So, possibility for a great steak, and based on the mac & cheese, the other dishes are likely quite good as well, but not the place to go if you want to be frugal or want to have a special dining experience.

But sometimes, it's just all about that great steak, isn't it?",cLsKgpNy8ijXCgzdAPFGyw,1,1,4,v0ZW_fuJq4thc01HqWH5IQ

This was the first restaurant I went back to when I came back to visit Las Vegas. 

If I had to choose one favorite restaurant in Vegas, this might be it. I've been to many steakhouses in other locations as well like Mastro's Steakhouse, Lawry's. But I have to say this is my favorite out of all. The price is definitely affordable and the food is just AMAZING. 

My favorite on the menu is definitely shrimp scampi for appetizer and colossal baked potato for the side. I only tried their dry aged new york steak, and I love it. Even the bread they give you on the side was really good, One minor miss for me was the desert section. I wish they had more to choose from, since there were only a few to choose from. 

One thing on the menu that I would definitely NOT recommend however, is their caesar salad. It was really not that great. I would defiantly order something else on the menu.

Our server was decent, the bussers were wonderful, the manager was phenomenal (tall white guy, short hair, super friendly) and we had a reservation so we didn't have to wait. The steak? Mediocre at best. They're specialty is NY strip- the toughest, most flavorless cut of beef. So, I got the rib eye, as did my boyfriend, since we both like some marbling- it was ginormous, but mostly ""marbling."" My boyfriend said, ""I've had way better steak for a quarter of the price."" Me: ""When?"" BF: ""When you make it at home."" To be fair, I think they grill their steaks and don't let them rest before serving, which takes away a lot of flavor. Also, I like a warm pink center, so I ordered it medium well, it came out medium rare- not okay when you're paying $50 for 1 steak.

My dry-aged sirloin steak was cooked perfectly to my specifications, and was tender and juicy in every bite. It was nicely seasoned, and had a nice crust on the exterior. So what's the problem? Well, the steak seemed to taste awfully familiar to the steak grilled in my own backyard.

I'm no steak expert by any means, nor do I claim to be champion amateur steak griller, but if I'm going to shell out $40+ for a steak at a restaurant, I typically want it to taste exponentially BETTER than the steak I make at home. At home, I usually eat my steaks with A1 sauce. Here, well the thought had crossed my mind.

The ""4 cheese"" mac 'n cheese was an extreme disappointment. I could hardly taste one type of cheese, as it was bland and lacked any flavor. The pasta was overcooked, and overall the side was just lukewarm, mere minutes away from being a cold dish. Our calamari appetizer was average, and it just didn't have that pipin' hot freshness. Although the outside breading was decent, the calamari inside seemed a tad rubbery. My wife and I did like the marinara sauce, which was so good that we kept dipping our breads in it.

Service was less than desired. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter seemed to give an overall vibe of ""blah."" The 20% off coupon from the hotel was the saving grace, but I'd rather pay full price at other places like Craftsteak, Joe's Stone Crab, and the Palm.

5754862,2018-05-10,1,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"So we are self proclaimed Meat Heads.  We love a good steak and often seek out a good steak house when we travel.  We love love love the Gallagher's in New York City, so when we realized there was a Gallagher's at New York, New York here we jumped at the chance to have a little taste of home in Las Vegas.  I am sad to report that this Gallagher's is a poor substitute for the original.  It doesn't even qualify as the first runner up... for the $1.98 beauty pagent. 
     What makes Gallagher's exception is not just their steaks, which if you visit the one in Manhattan are on display as they are aged on the premises, but the experience.  Their service, the atmosphere with all the old pictures on the walls of former famous patrons along with their traditional steak house menu, cuts and sides are all part of the package. 
     The one in Vegas falls short of an exceptional experience on every count.  Our usual order is the Porterhouse for two with creme spinach, mash potatoes  and the house salad. We were so disappointed by the lack of service.  Our steak was practically dropped in our lap without so much as a word of explanation or a offer to serve a single piece. 
This lack of service is only over shadowed by the fact that they can not possibly be using the same meat purveyor or method of dry aging.   The quality of the steaks is not the same as Manhattan restaurant.   There are no steaks on display or visible aging room. The pictures on the walls in Las Vegas look like they came out of the MGM studios set design or art department, not collected over years of actually services.  I am pretty sure Rock Hudson and many of the others were six feet under before the Vegas location ever broke ground.
    On a positive note the steak was good (not great) and did come out cooked appropriately to order.  The Moscow Mule I ordered had a nice blend of ginger and lime.  I really enjoyed the cocktail.  I suppose if I did not know the original, I might feel differently.  However, for me the only similarities between the Manhattan Gallagher's and the New York, New York Gallagher's in Vegas are the prices.

Don't fill up on the bread (delicious as it was)-- you're going to need to save all the stomach space you can for the fantastic cut of meat that will soon be coming your way. It's been about a week and I think I'm still full from this dinner.

The Prime Rib of Beef was fabulous. Our server told me it was a ""Queen Cut"", which is about an inch thick. This is the thickest prime rib I've ever seen! It could have easily been split between 2 people. Toward the end of dinner, I was completely full and just had to sit there and stare at it for a good 10 minutes to convince myself I had enough room for another few bites.

The texture was great. At first bite, I thought the flavor was good. After pouring the au jus all over it, I was in love. The au jus had a beef or vegetable broth flavor to it. It was very unique in comparison to other au jus I've had in the past. I'm not a huge fan of fat on my meat/steak, but the fat was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth good. 

The mac n cheese was good from the few bites I had of it. I was more focused on trying to take down my giant cut of Prime Rib.

I am in Las Vegas about 8 times a year for work, and I eat at Gallagher's every time I'm in Las Vegas. It's my favorite restaurant in town. 

When I get in steak debates with people, I insist that they come here with me. I'm more than happy to buy them a meal (avg. plate about $45 pp)  to show them what dry aged meat can be. Gallagher's nails it with perfect broiling. I usually get the cowboy ribeye. Despite being almost the size of a dinner plate, it's always impeccably cooked.

The texture of the steak is what will win you over. Tender, soft-cutting, and sooooo easy to eat. A medium cooked ribeye from Gallagher's is something I daydream about. You'll see. 

All of the sides are incredible. And huge. My favorite are the steak fries. Forget what you're picturing in your head: this is a HUGE baked potato, quartered lengthwise, coated with spices and served with a killer spiced ketchup sauce. 

Also try the pork chops (huge) and just about any of the desserts. Creamed spinach is also very, very good.

I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the NY steak. We shared some loaded smashed potatoes, sautéed spinach, sautéed mushrooms, and Mac n cheese. That sounds like a lot, but we also shared the sides with a few other people.

Our steaks were cooked perfectly and the sautéed mushrooms were delicious with them. All the sides were good, except for the Mac n cheese. It was pretty dry and lacked flavor. Even adding salt didn't help.

Wine list was pretty mediocre. I was surprised since it's a steak house and Vegas. I ended up with a glass of the Rioja, which went well with the steak.

While searching for other options, we also realized we didn't have the appropriate apparel packed for us to go to any other steakhouses... so we went on a hunt for a fairly casual place. My cousin found this place online and for whatever reason, we were convinced this place was a casual restaurant. I was thinking... outback-steakhouse casual. So without much thought or consideration we strolled in with shorts and my brother went in with a sleeveless shirt and felt so awkward being seated. This may not be your super upscale restaurant where they won't seat you unless in proper attire, but ""casual"" is not the average ""casual"" attire you would think. I guess I forgot, we were in vegas and the average person is dolled up regardless of occasion! Regardless, we were seated and service was amazing. The waiters knew the menu inside and out and without hesitance knew what to recommend for those who were first timers.

The food itself was amazing as well. I'm not a professional when it comes to steakhouses by all means but from what I have tried, the dry aged steak was pretty amazing. I also had the spinach salad as well as the sauteed french green beans and both were impressive. Portions were HUGE and all of us were SO FULL trying to each finish the dry aged steak. I would say men would be able to finish the steak but women should think to share no matter how hungry they may be--and most especially if you are thinking to order sides.

All in all, I would give the steakhouse a 4 because I can't necessarily say that this was the BEST steak I have ever had and the BEST restaurant experience.

Once again, we had a 20 percent coupon so decided to try this place out.

We started on with their calamari. It was tender and nicely breaded although it seems a little limped and not crispy enough. The marinara sauce was the star of the appetizer...I couldn't stop eating it even after all the calamari was gone, I dipped the complimentary bread with it. Then we had the baby spinach salad but to my surprise it had blue cheese on it which I am not a fan. On the menu, it didn't explain what it came with but ordered it anyways. The salad was decent, nothing spectacular..it was just a salad after all.

Hubby ordered the dry aged sirloin steak with the side of mac and cheese. I had some of his steak and it was pretty good but didn't taste a huge difference from that steak to a Mastro's steak. The mac n cheese was a true disappointment; it lacked season and flavor. It seems like they finished making the mac n cheese before the steak since the cheese was not smooth but coagulated.

They know their job and do it very, very well.


I went to Gallagher's for a work dinner and we were lucky enough to be greeted (once we arrivede at our table) by the Executive Chef. He hand picked a couple of our appetizers for us and made us feel completely at home.

We were served the cold and hot seafood appetizers and almost everything on these two dishes were spectacular. Everything except the fried calamari. It was a bit greasy, a tad bit over cooked and the breading didn't want to stay on. Still good needless to say. The jumbo colossal shrimp on both plates were to die for. On the hot platter it was drizzled in the most amazing sauce. Shrimps on both platter were so sweet and succulent. Crab cakes on the hot platter were the perfect size and the crab legs on the cold platter were split, easy to eat and so very sweet.

We also had bruschetta which was neither here nor there for me. It was fine but didn't blow me away or anything. 

I absolutely loved my porterhouse steak and while I love my beef, most yell at me when I order mine medium well. Pink is good with no blood for me please. But even though I had it cooked a little longer than medium rare it was still tender and juicy. One thing I was extremely shocked was how well seasoned the meat was. I didn't taste nothing more than salt and pepper but it was just perfect. Enough seasoning to compliment the meat and not cover the flavor of the steak itself.

The bone marrow that comes with the porterhouse was a HUGE surprise to me and a good one at that. I was drooling when I was eating it and enjoying every minute of it. I had only wished I had more. It was that good. 

The asparagus here have the most perfect Hollandaise sauce I have ever tasted in my life. The sauce was bright with lemon, buttery, smooth and the way it coated my tongue left me in heaven. 

We also had a mac and cheese but it was overpowered by the bacon in it and I wasn't a huge fan.

The Yukon gold potato puree was good, not great. A bit too loose for me but all the cheese that was in made up for it.

Decent wine list. Strong mixed drinks. 

Expensive dinner to say the least. But I didn't have to pay for it. ;)",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,8,4,4,SVq5kNYous5aWySR3mv13A

Every time we go to Vegas this is our ""special meal"" and it is always amazing. I typically get the aged NY steak, this time I went with the surf and turf. I wasn't disappointed. My steaks are always cooked to perfection and the flavors are ones I'm constantly comparing other steak houses to. It is very expensive but for special occasions it's well worth it. The service has always been top notch, there isn't anything I'd change about Gallagher's.",uHiRS7-9gnZAAJOL8e4BsQ,1,0,5,7TaRjcPNafvlzR0-hfVfEw
5928988,2012-11-30,2,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"We dined here for dinner on Thanksgiving Day with our good friends that were visiting from Hawaii. I don't know where to begin, but this place was such a disaster.

Service was horrible and slow. Extremely slow. So it was Thanksgiving night and they were busy, but it wasn't a full house in the restaurant. Our server (I guess I'll be nice and not mention his name) was never around. I think we only saw him 3 times. The first time was when he took our orders. Then he disappeared for an hour. We also waited over an hour for our food. He finally zoomed passed us right before we got our food, and then WE had to flag him down to get some drinks. The third time, he brought us the bill. Horrible. The guy who refilled our waters provided better service! 

The food wasn't too great in my opinion. The bread that they served us in the beginning was too hard and the butter was pretty frozen. I ordered the center cut Filet Mignon. The glaze on top of it was tasty, but the rest of the steak lacked flavor. It was also kind of dry. The bottom line: it needed salt. I also ordered the seasoned jumbo steak fries as my side. The seasoning made them taste weird. I couldn't really figure out was it was but it did leave a spicy after taste. The steak knives that they gave us were very dull as well. My husband and one of our friends ordered the dry-aged New York Sirloin. They both said it needed salt. Our other friend ordered the queen cut prime rib and enjoyed it. So at least one of us liked our food. 

FYI - the bathroom is a hoax! You open the first door with a sign that says ""restrooms."" Then it leads you to a second door with a sign that says ""restrooms."" When you open that door, it leads you to the nearby restrooms in the casino. LOL.

The bottom line: Not recommended and the steaks need salt. You know its bad when you have to have salt, A1, ketchup, and whatever else to make your steak edible!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,2,2,lE4tYDg6SvdUQhcZOvKQ-w
5933083,2014-06-08,3,nnDLapJk1z2NJE0-XzwMlQ,"Horrific.  Based on the waiter's recommendation was the NY strip aged steak medium rare.  So instead of going with the fish special I went with his recommendation.  I struggled so hard to cut the steak I even knocked off some of my sides.  I had a few bites which actually tasted ok but gave up eating because it was too much work.  He never came back to check on us and when he finally did show up I asked him about the steak and asked was it tough because it's aged?  He said no and if you had told me about it I would have changed it out for you but it's too late now.  Yet he never came back to check on our table so I did the best I could do with the steak I had.  I was so worried I was going to get ill after eating it. 

Let me backtrack a minute where when I ordered a drink it came in a glass with lipstick on it and now I couldn't even cut my food?  $200 wasted.  Trust me, there are way better steak places out there don't waste your money there!  The sides we shared.  We had mac and cheese it was good but not thick and creamy, green beans were very good and that's basically what I had for dinner, and bread.",I6fDSA3l48URn2fv6K_9Hw,7,0,2,tia3Do5M6MdUb0TZ9_41yQ

I wasn't in the mood for steak, so I ordered the lamb and so did one of my friends. The lamb was the only thing that salvaged this review from being 1-star. The lamb was cooked exactly as we requested. The steaks on the other hand were ALL totally off the mark. Two of my friends ordered their filets medium. One came out totally overcooked, like a hockey puck, the other ""medium"" steak was practically raw. I'm a fan of the medium-rare preparation, but this was extreme. When my friend asked for it to be cooked a little more, they sent it in and it still came back undercooked. He again had to request they cook it a little longer. The third time it came out overcooked, shocker.

This whole debacle was really disappointing. The birthday boy said he wishes he had just gone to Outback Steakhouse.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,6,1,2,495qro4Jkb3UKckt54a7Ig

Great ambiance and great service at this wonderful steak heaven. 

I started with the Lobster Bisque that was supercreamy and had lots and lots of flavor. 
Followed up with the New York Sirloin that was about 10 oz if i dont remember wrong. It had a great charred crust and still perfectly medium rare pinkish inside. It was melt in your mouth good and Went perfect it the Classic bearnaise. The small Ceasar as a side was delicious and the dressing was one of the better Ceasar dressings i have had for a while. 

Prices are as expected a Little bit higher here but its still a solid pick if you are craving a nice piece of meat on the strip.",qFKZoe-_3qxk-iCKp1qfaA,1,0,4,2wztiU_QTaW8fqZK-M6L1Q
