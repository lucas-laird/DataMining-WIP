No mouse or rodent of any type was to be seen anywhere.... The Chuck E. Cheese dance song played through its entirety.... No mouse. I asked several of the employees and they kind of shrugged and started radioing each other and still no mouse. A few minutes later after the song was over and all the children and parents gave up looking for Chuck E., a tiny Chuck-E-Cheese came running out through a few tickets in the lobby and left again. Extremely disappointing on top of the fact that they could not get my pizza order correct twice in a row. Seriously, veggie pizza- no black olives or cheese. It came out crust , sauce and black olives.... Take 2- crust, veggies... No sauce or cheese.. Sad times here. #VegasStrong",udBmqxb9jleTwo2s9JHhoA,0,0,1,CbDYbNsOfMIG627af6KadQ

I know that everyone sees this as a kid's place but it doesn't have to be ran this badly.
An honest 30% of the games were out of order...these are the life blood of this place.  Another 30%  would eat the kid's tokens and still not work.  I would assume it's pretty common bc the workers wouldn't even question me when I told them how much I had lost.  They'd just grab a hand full of tokens and refill my coin cup.
There were toddlers crawling up the skee ball lanes with no employees intervening.  Granted the parents should have controlled their kids, but they were no where to be found.  In which case the workers should have tried to restore some sort of order.

Standard ticket reward system.  At different time intervals, chuck-e (the rat) himself comes out and gathers all the children for a dance activity.  After that, they shower them with tickets which all the kids scramble to pick up off the floor.

The process to book a party on their website is extremely simple and I received a 120 token bonus for booking online.  I was pleasantly surprised that they only charged me a $50 deposit instead of charging me for the full cost of my party.  

The party package I picked came with plastic cups with curly straws for the kids and paper cups for the adults.  I would recommend bringing labels and a Sharpie to mark the cups because we had a difficult time keeping track of whose cup was whose and our hostess was unable to help.  We actually didn't see much of her throughout the event, but she was pleasant when she did come over.  She was subtle to mention that tips were appreciated, but I was irritated that you cannot add the tip to your credit card when you pay, you have to give it to the hostess in cash, so keep that in mind.  

I'm glad we chose to bring our cake (the only outside food allowed) because their cakes were pretty dinky looking.  The pizza was edible, but unmemorable, the veggie tray overpriced, but tasted fresh, and the cheesy bread was terrible.  Food took forever to come out and even though I spoke with the manager about one of our guests having a severe allergy to corn prior to the event (there is corn starch in all their bread and breaded products (pizza, wings, etc.), we had an issue ordering the special items we had discussed.   

The big disappointment of the day was that there were so many broken games.  Only one of the skeeball machines worked.  The balls were deflated on the football toss game.  There was no mallet on Whack a Mole. Those were some the games you didn't know sucked until you wasted your tokens, many other games just had Out of Order signs posted on them.  The games are the main reason to go to Chuck E. Cheese, so this was a bit frustrating.  Even with all the broken games, the kids starting with 80 tokens each, plus the 120 bonus, we still spent about an additional $100 in tokens.   

Another issue was that there was no soap or paper towels in the ladies room.  When I told a staff member, she advised that someone would get in there as soon 'as they had a chance', but when another mom in our group went in a half hour later they still had not been replenished.  
Keeping with the unclean theme, the brewed iced tea had a really disgusting dirty taste, and the Diet Pepsi was pretty terrible as well.  I stuck with the bottled water I brought with me.

Overall, I would host another party here if the child Really wanted to go to Chuck E, Cheese, but I'd make sure I had Purell and a beverage.",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,5,6,3,JsQkAGAjbamHCS5Tox49hQ

1) Food - Great food despite the fact it's main business is video game entertainment.  The pizza was delicious as was the salad bar.  Very fresh and just enough to make you say wow.  Seriously I would rate there pizza better than Papa John's or Pizza Hut.  However, the wait time for food is astocious!  Seriously we waited almost an hour to get our food (two separate locations experienced similar wait times both times).  Had to ask at least 3 times where my food was and just waited forever.  Perhaps disclose wait times before you order?!

2) Games - Pretty nice selection of games and good ticketing system for some cool prizes.  Everything actually works that was available to play.  A few games had ""out of order"" signs on them but nothing you'd die to play anyway.  They're also very generous with tokens if you happen to get a deal meal thing.  I would have like to see more of the party dining area utilized for more games, but that's just my opinion.

Overall I gave it a 3 star because of the wait times for food and the fact they let hoodlums loiter in front of there establishment.  I was approached by two different vagrants asking for money and there was a group of teenagers smoking by the front of the door.  Just gives off the wrong image.

most of the tables were filthy, garbage and food was everywhere on the floor. but the bulk of my complaints come from the games.

the games regularly ate our tokens, many of the games failed to dispense tickets and several actually ran out as it was dispensing. we used the ticket counting machines when we were ready to leave, i inserted 10 tickets, it gave me credit for 1!

i was looking for staff out on the floor to assist with the machines, but no one could be found. the people at the counter couldn't be bothered with complaints about the games.

After waiting another half hour, we checked on it again and told Christina, the cashier, that it had now been an hour since we ordered one pizza. She went to the back and came back with a large pepperoni pizza. No apology, no smile, nothing. What she did say, however, ""was your ticket number displayed on your table?""

I'm sorry but this girl should not be a party host...she was short, rude and pushy with the kids and even though we were the only party there with no other party coming in before we were done she rushed the kids through everything.  The kids were still eating pizza and she started bringing out ice cream and before they could even start on the ice cream she brought out the cake with ONE (1) candle on the cake for a 9 year old.  

My Neice had to step outside to take an emergency call and a friend of hers told Alana that we can't do the cake until his mom comes back....nope, she had the rat out there singing happy birthday and lite the candle all with his mom outside.  She got a lot of crap from my Neice's friends for not waiting or having any respect for the kids my Neice.

Now if this was just my opinion ok but it's not...all the adults were pissed and my Neice and her friend both let Maria know how upset they were.  The kids being so young did not realize the disrespect or how pushy and unpleasant Alana was making this party.

As long as Alana is a party host I cannot recommend this place.  You don't talk down to kids and treat them like that.  She cut my Neice short of a gift bag and was very very stingy with everything.  We didn't need or want anything for free, some respect and being thankful someone is actually willing to spend some money in this establishment is something they should be thankful for.  

The food was good and the place was clean but we were also the first party of the day.  Other then that I will not recommend this place.  There are a lot of other places to have a kids party and you will be treated like it is your special day, not like here, hurry up and get out...that's how Alana made us feel.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,9,5,1,tCU8nNDDlJFNJkpIEU0ObQ

The rest of the game area was ok. Yes, just ok. Nothing to brag about. We mainly played deal or no deal, skee ball and basketball. LAME!

5466074,2011-07-24,3,hpv2WZA4_G1qC65QQ26ZjA,"By all accounts, I should love places like this.

I mean, I did as a kid.  I enjoy video games, and while I know I'm nowhere near the age of the intended target audience, when you're invited to a birthday party, these should be some amounts of adult level mirth, right?  I'm fairly open-minded as an adult.  I can still play with the kids if wee hands drag me along (and they did).

Man, things have changed since I was a kid.  And yet, not.

Anyone can have a good time with skee-ball or hoop shots, but where are the arcade games?  If it wasn't some novelty item manufactured by Nickelodeon, it pretty much didn't exist.  Again, I get that it's a kid's place.  I'm not expecting House of the Dead, but where are the Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede fare?  Certainly those games still have some worth in being in one of these places.  They did when I was a kid.

And yet, the ""time warp"" aspect took a weird hold in other ways.  The singing stage animatronic was clearly from the early 1990's at best.  Not one kid seemed interested as Chuck warbled some tune set to a video that was clearly shot no later than 1988.

Not that you could have heard anything.  Kids run batmess crazy in here, while the employees look somewhat shell-shocked.  I was playing a game when an employee just backed into me and stepped on my foot. ""Whoa, excuse me"", I said, trying to put my shoe back on that was removed during said stomping.  The employee just looked at me silently than walked away without saying a word,  At least the four year old that bumped into me earlier could say ""Excuse me"".

Well, at least there's the pizza, right?  I guess I'd be nuts about it if I enjoyed something with the consistency of cardboard mixed with a slight cheese flavor.  I ordered a chicken sausage pizza, which at least has some flavoring to it, but I wasn't going to lose my mind for it.

Again, I am clearly not the audience for this place.  It's not as amazing as I remember from being a kid, and it's not the most adult accommodating place if you're trying to find a little entertainment for yourself alongside the wee folk.
