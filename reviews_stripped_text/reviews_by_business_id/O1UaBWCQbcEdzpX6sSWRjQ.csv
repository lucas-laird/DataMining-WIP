2293653,2018-01-30,0,O1UaBWCQbcEdzpX6sSWRjQ,Love their mini donuts!!! I make sure to stop by every Saturday at Tivoli Village's Farmers Market and get some for myself and my mom. I love how many toppings there are to choose from (even though my favorite is cinnamon/sugar). They even have a little crunch to them. I've tried other mini donuts in California markets and Operation Donuts definitely are the BEST. I look forward to the customer service as well! It's important to me that the person making the food has his/her soul in it and I know that Josh does! I've been able to get to know him over time with seeing him each Saturday and he definitely has a vision and a goal in mind with his business. Looking forward to this Saturday for more cinnamon/sugar mini donuts!,CquL6LpA5sVwYpx8xfrpyQ,0,0,5,WlSjbWQvQaWfuhGuRYcVBg

His friendly demeanor and customer service was the best. He is by far one of the best donut masters in Las Vegas. I will travel near and far to enjoy his donuts!,p2ekKLXItEHE5pCEgkEa0g,0,0,5,1pjhfa78X6rvVsyPNVq5jQ
