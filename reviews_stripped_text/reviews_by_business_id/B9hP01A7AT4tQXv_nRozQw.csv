Told the lady/owner I will be back to pick up my food. So when we came back 15 mins later, I sent my husband to get the food and I stayed in the car with my baby. He was in there a few mins and comes out saying we never ordered. So at this point I was heated for now I am running late for work. I go in there and the lady again denies I was in there 25 mins earlier and that she doesn't remember. Are you frickin' kidding me?? Now at this point I was irate and fuming.

The ""fresh"" spring rolls are not made to order and are left sitting like fast food under a heat lamp! Main dishes arrived with overcooked/bloated noodles and non authentic broth. Beef boullion is not an acceptable substitute in Vietnamese noodle soup broth. Further observation revealed blatant health code violations such as servers going into the kitchen and preparing/handling food without washing their hands and employees using fingers instead of tissue to wipe their nose right before they handle food!

This place was one of most favorite and frequented spots to dine...
Once upon a time that is.
I visited about a month ago and the food seemed to have changed a bit(for the worse) but I thought, hmmm, maybe just a different cook today...?
And the service was lacking as well. I thought, well maybe it's just a bad day for them.
So then I return on Monday and BOOM! The decision maker that made me decide for sure that I will NOT be returning! The chicken wings were not only dry but have shrunken! Really?!?! They looked like pigeon wings. The rice was not fresh, it was reheated. Blah. The shrimp spring rolls were awful! The sauce changed, they use shredded iceberg lettuce and the shrimp was old and mushy. The PHO!!!!! OMG, I've never had bad pho until this very visit. They have gotten very chincey with their noodles and meats. I remember eating and having so much meat in my pho that I'd give it to whomever I'm dining with. Well, not the case anymore. I had 4 little tiny pieces of rare steak which tasted old! The BROTH was flavorless! It tasted like hot water and salt!!!! Yuck yuck yuck!!!!!!! And the ""fresh"" bean sprouts were old, brown and disgusting. Never ever coming back!!!!!!! I guess it's worth the drive to Chinatown....ugh!

When me and partner sat down, we were quickly greeted and was offered ice water or hot tea.  Since we are Pho fanatics, we already knew what we wanted.  BBQ pork and egg rolls rice vermicelli and An order of Sammy Pho (house pho).  To my surprise, everything came out quickly and the food was great.  My pho was not super salty, it actually had flavor, and it turns out, the owner told me he makes his soup as if he was making it for the family.  He filters the beef soup three times, to get the soup,to be as pure with beef broth as possible.  Not only that, the meat that they had was slicked, but they were obviously thicker than the other Pho joints here in Vegas.  In addition to that, the owner here doesn't try to trick you, they order their noodles, so they are not the ones that come dried and boiled down till it is cooked.  The noodles are order fresh,  that's how they have the freshest bowl of noodle.  

As for the BBQ pork and egg rolls, they were great. I actually finished eating their food and I didn't feel like they over sprinkled the meat with msg. It was excellent.

I like the vermicelli rice noodles combo with egg roll.  It comes with a big pile of fresh noodles, which are not supposed to be hot by the way with lots of fresh greens and some thinly sliced bbq pork on top for flavor.  I feel good after eating Sammy's food since it is not bogged down with any grease.  Everything is freshly made as you can look right into the kitchen and see that.

1373271,2013-06-13,6,B9hP01A7AT4tQXv_nRozQw,"I had to add my review here after reading some of the previous ones.

Maybe this is an establishment that started off a little rocky, but figured out their groove and fixed some of the complaints, because I visit no less than a dozen or so pho places in town, mostly in Chinatown, and this place impressed me and my colleague today.  

Firstly, I think the negative comments on the service are laughable.  What pho place in town gives red carpet service anyway?  I'm pretty confident that any regulars' expectations are to be seated and served a glass of ice water, order your food and drink together, have it dropped off, and pay at the counter.  The staff at Sammy far exceeded that expected service level if you ask me.  Two of the staff checked in on us 3 times during our 30 minute lunch visit.  Impressive for a pho restaurant!  In addition, the waiter brought us our check, and acted as cashier.  Again, exceeding standards.  This is not PF Chang's folks...c'mon.

Regarding the food, the spring rolls were okay.  That I agree with.  I guess you could really mess them up if you tried, but noodles, cooked shrimp, and herbs is pretty straight forward.  The pho was awesome though!  The broth was extremely rich and flavorful.  Way more so than many of the perceived ""awesome"" spots in Chinatown, which I feel serve a watered down version of what I hope pho broth to be.  My ""rare steak"" was in fact rare, as described on the menu.  It did cook just fine in the broth, and the ""well done flank"" was, well....done.  See what I did there?  :)  

So, my review is my opinion for whatever it's worth.  Coming from the Caucasian who loves Asian food, and is particularly fond of Vietnamese fare, and speaking on behalf of my Filipino colleague who loves him some pho, I say this place is definitely on my list of regular lunch places.

Hats off to Sammy Pho!",6x3aIb8SLZcOFcHEcWBLog,6,3,4,Ox9n9XE0rTzK_Y7bIVK5eQ

Service sucks. Idk how else to put it. They have no organization to seating arrangements or anything like that. People started walking out! We finally got a table but our server was distracted & was not listening when we were ordering. After waiting 20 minutes, we finally got our waters & drink orders.

Another 30 minutes later, he gives us 4 bowls of Pho when we ordered 1 Pho & 2 Vermicelli Bowls. And listen to this... he was ARGUING with us that those bowls were our orders. We grabbed a menu and physically pointed our orders and he kept saying ""Ok ok ok!"" He reached over my friend to grab the Pho bowls by her & he was seriously way too close for comfort, about to spill the bowls on her.

The place was pretty empty when I came in so finding a seat wasn't a problem, Just walk in and your server goes right up to you with Menus and brings out water. 

After asking our server for a few recommendations, I ended up ordering Fresh Shrimp Spring Rolls (4) served with Fish or Peanut Sauce, and a P4 (Pho Tái Nam, Rare Steak, Well Done Flank). The appetizer came out within 5 minutes, the shrimp didn't taste fresh at all and the peanut sauce was questionable, average at best. The Pho took about 15 minutes to come out, accompanied by the usual lime, bean sprouts, and Basil. I had to ask for another set of Lime and Basil since the ones they gave me were very old, it felt like they had it sitting in their kitchen for weeks just waiting to be used. 

On to their Pho, the meat was surprisingly good, I do have a preference of Rare Steak over the Well done flank, Rare steak was Tender and Juicy where as the Flank was too chewy and fatty, You're better off just ordering their Pho with Only Rare Steak(Pho Tái). Meat portion was low, you get about 5/6 small pieces of meat. The main problem I had with Sammy Pho is how oily and sickeningly sweet their broth is. I'm a fan of sweets but I can only handle so much before I start getting tired of the taste, which led to an unfinished bowl of Oily pho, sorry but sweet broth is NOT for me. 


Service was average, nothing really great or bad about it, Water was refilled when it had to be and the people working there had a nice attitude. 

I probably won't be coming back here, this style of pho is just something I don't enjoy. Feel free to give it a try if you are into a more sweeter broth.",H95BCWxTwwfHYfdTZooXvg,1,1,2,C_4t-MmBrzJCggthwRBcDg

My reason for low rating is based mostly on the taste & time spent waiting. The restaurant is always fairly empty whenever I go (maybe 1 or 2 other tables present at the same time), but it usually takes 20-30 minutes for my food to arrive (a lot longer than other pho spots).",iiMGd03G_RXzXFfRsyPAMg,0,0,2,iqG3E_ZIQ814PH4FhfNzJA

Always good to try new things in life especially when i comes too food. It was my first time here normally for Pho have my to go spots. If first impressions are important Sammy Pho definitely not going get one excited. I thought was walking into employee dining room (not that all of them are bland or lack any type of personality) cause all the walls no decoration. Sure you have widescreen televisions spread out all around. I sat down just odd feeling like am in restaurant or cafeteria setting? Just me. 

The food that trumps anything comes too decor of restaurant. I started with order of springs rolls and then got p1 for my Pho. The spring rolls were ok. I know everyone makes them different from one vietnamese restaurant to another. I prefer one that has little more rice noodles in it. I felt like the springs rolls had more lettuce then noodles. The peanut dipping sauce felt could have been thicker in consistency and could have had more peanut taste in it. 

The Pho the broth was ok. Again just felt like it was missing something maybe lacked the depth then my normal spots. To be fair my Pho put siracha and hoisin, The bean sprouts, lime, jalapeño, and fresh thai basil. Really most of the base broth flavor is gone. Still Pho your only as good as your broth!!!! They do put nice portion of noodles and the meat in the Pho. It was hearty till the bottom of the bowl. =)) 

The service was excellent. The guy was very attentive, friendly, and asked if everything was good. I appreciate when restaurant asks for feedback from the customers. 

Overall just ok nothing that really stood out for me. It location is close to me so could see myself coming back. If looking for great Pho feel like lot of others places that can go get your Pho on.................",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,1,1,3,NY7mChHHDLwFA9zXJ0khtw

We live on the southwest side and always have to drive to Chinatown to go to Pho Kim Long so we were excited to try a place so close to home. We walked in and were seated very quickly. The place was pretty empty when we walked in but it was a little early for dinner. Got some menus and looked it over. It's not as extensive as some of the other places but to me that's not a negative as I have no qualms with quality over quantity. We both ordered the pho with chicken and some egg rolls. I really liked that they had the option to add extra noodles or meat. I added the extra noodles. The food arrived pretty quickly. The egg rolls were pretty tasty. They came 4 on a plate. I had 3 the Mrs. had 1. I can be a piggy. Would I order them again? Definitely. I gotta say I really enjoyed the pho. Our favorite place for pho is Pho Kim Long so I guess I'd compare Sammy's to that. The broth at Sammy's is pretty good. When comparing to Pho Kim Long, it's good but in a different way. A slight edge to Pho Kim Long for the broth. What I really liked though was that the chicken was actually chicken. Some of these other places use this squishy chicken like meat but Sammy's has real shredded chicken. Really really enjoyed that. 

In regards to the negatives about service, like others have said Pho restaurants tend to not be very customer service oriented. Having said that we were pleasantly surprised at the level of service we received at Sammy Pho. The waiters were very attentive and checked on us often. The owner Sammy came over and introduced himself and was super friendly and had a small conversation with us after our meal. My wife was drinking a diet soda and he asked her if she needed a refill. She said she was ok but he brought us a drink to go anyway. Who does that?? That was very nice of him. Overall we really enjoyed our meal and will definitely be going back.

Finally a pho place that I don't have to drive 15-20 min for. 

Verdict....it's definitely a keeper. 

Ordered my pho tai TO GO and egg rolls and the noodles were al dente exactly how I like them. The beef was definitely fresh and sliced by them or wherever they bought it because it was not your normal typical beef that you get at other places. My husband enjoyed the egg rolls more here but I didn't notice a huge difference except there was no lettuce to wrap the egg rolls with. Not sure if they forgot or if that's not their type but in any case it was decent. The broth wasn't bad either, not the best I've had but it works. There wasn't too much broth but it worked out since its so hot I didn't gulp down the broth anyways. There's only one size and I think its about 8 bucks a bowl give or take which is about the same as other places? Noodles are a lil less too but I was full regardless. 

Not sure how long they are giving away the 20% discount for but it's definitely a decent pho joint. The lady working there pointed out the 20% off that we received and service was pretty quick.",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,8,2,4,AdFyW_42XbXFx5V86xqbRA

I tried the spring rolls again.  No overpowering minty aftertaste.  Everything was just right.  Still not the best, but good enough.

I ordered the pho with rare steak, brisket, meatballs & tendon (I think it was the house special pho), and the flavor of the broth was a lot more tasty than the first one.  It had much more flavor, and that sweetness that makes really good Pho was there.  I still prefer driving to Chinatown and savoring the pho of Pho87 or Pho Saigon 8.  But whenever I'm craving for a quick fix, since I live less than a mile from here, this place is good enough.

BUT I went a few days ago & this time I ordered the vegetable soup, & there were a few tiny baby roaches (some type of insect) floating in my soup. The manager or owner apologized & offered me something else to eat, but I lost my appetite. He did not charge us.... & said that they wash their vegetables, but it might have came from inside the broccoli (because they are whole pieces) IDGAF?!

She came and asked if we wanted drinks and as we were ordering a male customer came in, she said ""I'll just get you water"" and proceeded in helping the male customer. She took his order and never came back to get ours.  That was very disrespectful!!! Will not ever try this place.

Hated the two TV's on two different stations, rival stereo effect that made me queasy. Turn off volume, turn on captioning. Bars figured that out decades ago. 

That said, I am giving them 5 stars where I would normally have given them 3 in hopes of offsetting the unfair one-star review left by someone who doesn't even have the balls to use their real name or a photo. 

I think this little place has a lot going it, and I want to see them succeed. 

**Dear Yelp:

I wish there were a way to report bad/abusive reviews. How is ""SF"" allowed to keep their review online when:
A) It is not even about this restaurant
B) They are not a reliable or even known Yelper? 

I've seen you delete good reviews for less, why not the bad ones? 

This person is obviously a rival restaurant owner - the only other reviews are similar restaurants in the area, and all one star. Get on the ball, Yelp! This person is a fraud and it reflects poorly on you!",OueXAik2P-eUcXbd1qGXKw,2,1,5,7w6r7THnneFrX8ANgnfWEw

First of all one review said the had a C rating from the health department... so I checked right when I walked in and the were proudly displaying an A.  I think this may be due to the new management.  But I was pleased to see it. 

I ordered some Pho Tai (rare beef) and an order of shrimp spring rolls. I thought the pho was really good and decently sized... However the amount of meat was lacking. The spring rolls were some what disappointing and just ok. But I loved the peanut dipping sauce that came with.  

Also the service was great. The we're super attentive and very nice. They spoke clear English and my food came out fast.

Great pho, especially their sate pho. The last time I went, about 3 weekends ago it was different and horrible. The service was lacking (none of the people who were working I recognized); got my order wrong, then I waited a while for my sate pho, and they gave us a small quantity of bean sprouts and basil .  The sate pho was very different, not enough spice, the broth had no flavor, the meat was very different than what it usually is (it was a very bad quality cut of meat); I didn't even finish it.
