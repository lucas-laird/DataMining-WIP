90406,2012-11-03,0,_sh6mIBWZis66mAjkjN8Qg,"My coworkers and I were exploring the Summerlin ArtWalk at The Trails Center and was approached by a Rachel's Kitchen employee. She handed each of us a menu and welcomed us to check them out for their grand opening across the street.

While browsing through the art, we read through the menu, looking through all their salads, pasta, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers. Their menu also includes a breakfast menu served all day, a kids menu for the little ones, along with a lighter menu for the calorie-conscious. Dunno about my coworkers, but I was hungry and won over by the sweet potato fries or onion rings. We decided to head over.

Situated right next to Kumon, the restaurant is well-lit and is bigger than it appears from the outside. You can order at the counter and they'll assign you a number so someone can bring your food to your table. The dining area is spacious, although the drink station is a bit hidden at the back. Their service is quite friendly and efficient too.

I had the cheeseburger with the 1/3-pound patty done medium. When I picked the burger up, it was practically dripping its juices onto my plate. Their sweet potato fries were made well, not too thick and still crisp. Yum. I really like that they have clean, healthy dishes that have this fresh vibe to them.

Might have to come by for a smoothie or one of their freshly squeezed juices sometime! It's a nice place to grab a typical breakfast, lunch, or brunch.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,1,1,4,11yvrHB_TpXXaVC1V4SNZg

Walked in, ordered food & sat down- hoping my food would be able to satisfy my tastebuds. 
Not. A. Chance.

The food simply was comparable to cafeteria food I was served in high school. I had gotten the chicken curry wrap, which didn't specify it had raisins in it, or that my plate had literally 10 fries on it. 
My friend had gotten the French toast. His first impression was the thick slabs of ciabatta bread just looked like they were toasted & served with ice cold syrup. Of all things, how can you screw up French toast? I digress.


This place needs a good chef & they will survive.
Because, paying $$$ for shitty food, makes me so disappointed in the people behind the scenes of he kitchen. This isn't the first review that this is said.

I want to believe it is just this location that the food was disappointing. For the price, you would expect high quality food and it was the complete opposite. The $10 burger patty did not taste or look fresh (frozen patty??) and was a bit on the rough side (med.well, but it's ground beef!) and salty. The veggie wrap was more of a lettuce wrap because that is what I can taste the most of, even though it had other roasted veggies. The sweet potato fries were ok and the onion rings were good. The greens for the salad and burger also did not look fresh. Will not be going back to that location and will give Rachel's another chance at a different location.

Hands down one of my favorite places to eat BUT......one of my least favorite places to call and place and order. I have been a patron for years and can honestly say, the service is just plain BAD on the front end. I have walked out on occasion because they forgot to put my order in, or made me wait in a long line only to pick up my cold to-go food. It's like that girlfriend or boyfriend that you keep breaking up with only to go back to.

1913296,2014-05-03,8,_sh6mIBWZis66mAjkjN8Qg,"I love Rachels Kitchen- but I do agree with quite a few reviewers that this might not be their best location (Hualapai4LIFE) in terms of consistency. Let's be honest though- a bad visit to Rachel's kitchen is still substantially better than just about anything else in a few mile radius. I have gotten good meals and bad here, but the good occurs more frequently. 

When some friends came in from out of town and wanted a close place for a good breakfast I told them Rachels. They went and saw the outside, thought it was a hippy place and drove away. This prompted a heated exchange in which I questioned their honor, family lineage, and level of impairment. After a civil discussion they agreed to try it the next day and low and behold they thought it was awesome. Point being get past your skepticism and give Rachel's a try.

I have had a lot of things on the menu (I used to use a delivery service to get it for lunch pretty frequently) - so here are the highlights as I see them

Mac and Cheese- this isn't the Kid Mac at Outback (which coincidentally is also awesome) - its a more sophisticated ""adult"" (not in that way- get your mind out of the gutter this is a family show) dish- i.e. it has onions and mushrooms in it. I have downed probably 25 or more of these in my lifetime.

Signature Pasta- this is pasta in a tomato sauce with chicken and a ton of vegetables in it- great for convincing yourself you are eating healthy when you may or may not be. 

Garden's Pasta- don't be fooled- despite having Garden in the name this is not a vegetarian dish, it has chicken in basically a carbonara esque pasta. 

440 sandwhich- chicken and tasty tasty goat cheese (which is pretty strong)- not for the feint of heart.

Grilled Cheese- pretty good, although I would suggest subtracting all vegetables as an ""ultimate"" grilled cheese should not need them/they aren't a cheese. i know this- I put the ill in grilled cheese

Protein Scramble(again, mind out of the gutter)- this is a pretty good breakfast- recommend a side of bacon... or five

i suppose attempting to go there at noon was not a smart move.
then i remembered christie o. mentioning to me before that a new rachel's had opened near the trails so off i went.

i had no problem finding a spot as the center that they're located in has plenty of parking.
i think this rachel's location is my favorite so far because the dining room is spacious and roomy.
it's the same ordering system as the other 2 locations...order at the counter, get your number, sit down and your food is brought to you.
i always order the same thing, garden pasta, so this time i decided to try something different.
i had the ultimate grilled cheese on sourdough with a mixed green salad.
the gruyere, cheddar and parmesan were perfectly melted between two slices of doughy, grilled sourdough with the roasted tomatoes giving it that smooth sweetness through the sharp, salty zing from the cheese.
they've taken a childhood favorite and given it a little grown up flair.
delicious!

i really wish there was a rachel's closer to home (ahem, northwest part of town please!)
there's a center just down the street from my house that would be perfect!

Acai Bowl: love, wish it had coconut. But I love it
Immune Support Juice
Popeye's Secret Juice (my go to: I have it almost daily anyway)
Sweet Greens Juice (zippy!)
Carrot Juice (orange!)
Wheatgrass 1 or 2oz shooters = grassy 
Tomato Basil Soup = CRAZY good
Cream of Broccoli Soup = not too creamy (in a great way)  and with some texture and carrots, I think
Red Pepper Soup (I think GF brought it over, today. Soothing)
Veggie Burger, held together well, no upcharge for a delicious, colorful side salad and great balsamic. 

Literally this is all I have had since Mon when the Ebola came over me at the gym and my trainer sent me home. Made a quick stop to see the ever sweet and lovely Brenda and once: called in and one of the guys brought my bag to the car so I didn't have to rock the furry Hello Kitty PJs (just call from curb) You can order online, too.

By the time we bring the order back to the office, we have 5 to 10th minutes to eat before we have to go to our next meeting.

So although the kitchen needs help in their productivity, the front counter staff members are great. Prices are a little higher. Salads, sandwiches, wraps are good.

Today, there was no line when i arrived. I ordered the chicken tender wrap with fries. It was good as always but waited almost 20-minutes for my order.

Rachels, I recommend to work on your timing in the kitchen. Once I see the consistency, I will be more than happy to bump up to a 4 star rating.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,3,1,3,uhlP2BEjxyM0jxb71TMa0A

To start, I understand that while people are preparing others foods, when you see two people standing there waiting to order, the least you can say is, I'll be with you shortly, or someone will be with you shortly, or hey, go screw yourself.....something! That kinda put me off, but whatever, I'm hungry, let's eat!

I ordered the grilled veggie salad. I was disappointed it didn't come with more veggies. The ones that were there were delicious! The roasted red peppers were not. I loathe jarred roasted peppers. Take the time and toast them yourself, it's easy and not very time consuming. I will say it was a nice sized bowl of lettuce, I liked that. The dressing was OK, definitely could have used some more, but I wasn't about to go stand there like an idiot again and wait for it.

My friends ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and a wrap. They wrap the wrap in lots and lots of paper. It took her some time to get it off (pervert, I know that you are thinking!). They also ordered 2 smoothies before the meal. One was a peanut butter one and it was tasty but too thick, especially for the straw they provide. The other was a banana kinda smoothie that while I dont dig the banana taste, it was much easier to enjoy.

My company, the absolutely FABULOUS Christina and Arvin, made the meal fantastic. I always have the best time with them and enjoy every minute!

I'd definitely try Rachel's again, I think I'm going for the grilled cheese next time. Sounds good.

I place my order online because it is supposed to be convenient yet I still end up most of the time waiting in my car and having to go inside and get my food only to find out it isn't even ready. I have no issues with going inside and ordering something and waiting for it, but when a place offers online ordering so that you don't have to do those things and cut down on wait time and can't get it right it becomes useless. Then when I finally get my food it is overcooked. This wasn't an issue when they first opened however maybe because they are expanding around town too fast consistency is an issue. This last time my Omelet was yet again crispy and brown (overcooked) and hubbys breakfast burrito tasted awful (we used to eat these a couple times a week) and the tortilla was hard and the pancakes had a burnt flavor.

My go to is the Rachel's chicken salad sandwich  on ciabatta and watermelon water. If you check in with the purchase of an entree you get a glass of wine so that's a bonus. The price is reasonable for the quality of food you're getting.

Yes, it's reasonably priced. While there is table service, per se, you do have servers bring your food, after ordering it from the counter. Tip at time of purchase, or as you leave. 

The bakery stuff looked great --- yogurt parfaits, muffins, cakes, et al. The first day I showed up, there were lemon poppyseed muffins that looked perfect. However, the next day, when I came back, they looked just OK. They were smaller and didn't look as big and vigorous. The server told me that they had a different chef today --- and I was glad to hear that at least there is some human touch to all this. She either took pity on me, or perhaps the smallish muffins themselves, and stuffed a second one in my bag, without me even knowing. Very sweet.

I got the sweet potato fries, which were also good...as normal? They're pretty hard to mess up lol. But maybe I'm a hefty eater, I just thought the portions were small. Oh, I also purchased the Triple Berry Smoothie! (See?? So famished!) And I thought it was refreshing and not overly sweet. I also appreciate that they can omit the yogurt. 

All in all, decent lunch spot. Prices range from about $8 up (my 16oz smoothie was $6), and I thought that the portions could have been larger considering the price tag, but that's just me.  I will probably return as they are in the neighborhood of my usual whereabouts if I tire of the my regular go-to's.",wxDM6hqyW5OPp5cXzn6F0w,3,1,3,zFf8r5KmoUFatWmvWIzQog

5438806,2017-03-31,1,_sh6mIBWZis66mAjkjN8Qg,"I went into Rachel's kitchen and tried to order an omelet without any of the sides associated with the meal - no bread and potatoes. Joe, the cashier, told me this would be no problem. When I started to order toppings, he told me they would be extra. I asked Joe to clarify - what I was ordering then was just scrambled eggs? Joe said that was right: it was scrambled eggs. 

So I ordered scrambled eggs (topped with cheese) and coffee - but was charged the same price ($9.95) as if I ordered the omelet with both sides and 3 toppings. When I protested, Joe look flustered. After a few minutes of fidgeting, Joe reached out to his manager for help - but I was so over it by that point I just walked out. 

This is not cheap food. The customer service here is beneath what one would experience at cheaper places - like Chipotle - and a lot worse than IHOP, where the omelets are cheaper. In a word, it sucks. 

I will not be visiting another Rachel's if I can avoid it. This once fresh and great brand has fallen on hard times because of complacency. Sad.",sWLXpqNLhIBi_4QOPwKPog,3,0,1,MZBMNSeeP89CYcfx3keCQg

Went back to get a salad, service was slow and they still messed up the order by making it to go instead or dine in. The Cobb salad we got had TONS of meat and avocado, huge plus there. If I rated this place on the Cobb salad it would be a solid 4/5, but again, 2/2 orders messed up may inhibit me to come on a day I'm in a hurry vs wanting to sit and relax.

TERRIBLE: 
My husband ordered my food and showed up at the 15-20 minute window. Nothing was ready. His order was never sent to the kitchen, therefore they rushed my order of cheeseburger. The burger was supposed to have no bun and only cheese, nope came with the bun. So they said just scrape it off, well that also takes all the cheese off. Took one bite of my plain burger and it tasted like bad meat.  I called and the manager said it tasted bad because they rushed my food and next time my husband should just allow them to cook it the right way....I'm sorry, 50 minutes should be sufficient to cooking a cheeseburger and he told me they kept giving him the runaround instead of just owning that they hadn't even started the order. Poor taste, poor quality poor communication. The manager said she comped the bill and offered him two free entrees, I think I'll pass on a free bad meat burger.",tbuQQqyB_rBN8kqru5IFUw,2,0,3,sV_lOe3Wt2vhorqdqRVfug

OK, it wasn't that far, but the Trailwood location is now so much more convenient.  It has become a  regular stop for the kids and I after our weekly visits to the Summerlin Library.  

I have yet to try something on their menu that I do not like. You can't go wrong with the Grilled Chicken, Ultimate Grilled Cheese, or Turkey Sandwiches. The sides options of fries, sweet potato fries, mixed green salad, or onion rings round out the meal. But, my absolute fave is the Chinese Chicken Salad.  And just for kicks, I'll switch it up every once in a while with the classic Chopped Salad.  The best part however, is the fact that if I have a napping baby in the backseat, I don't have to risk waking him up by getting him out of the car and back in.  I can simply place my order over the phone and pick it up curbside, and be on my way.  And I have yet to try it, but ordering online looks super easy and convenient too. 

My kids also love the smoothies, as do I, but I have recently become a fan of the Popeye's Secret- thanks to Christie O's frequent pics and cheek ins :)  This fresh juice blend of apples, spinach, carrots, celery, beets and parsley just hits the spot and puts me in a healthier state of mind.
