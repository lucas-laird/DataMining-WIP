12374,2014-05-28,1,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,Just lost a regular customer raising the footling burrito to almost 8 bucks... Bummer,xz8nT6_s7mzjn19YAyI1YQ,5,1,2,Cq4cyuQBnL_hBqvy0NN1lw
94407,2013-01-23,1,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"I had a foot long burrito that starts at $4.99, I opted for carne asada which adds $2 and cheese which added $1. I'm a very athletic 6'1 215lb guy with a voracious appetite. For $8 I got two meals out of that burrito. Great value and flavor was good enough to order again. 

My lady friend had the 2 taco chicken platter which she enjoyed very much. I tasted the chicken and it was tasty.

I'll definately be going back to Baja Taco and I too hope to see them around and wish them good luck with their endeavor.

I must add that I almost walked straight out the door when I walked in because they didn't have the tray of jalapeno's and carrot's like Roberto's and most other taco shops have. I love that stuff so much in fact that the majority of the time the actual reason I go to Roberto's or similar places is because I'm craving the peppers and carrots and just using the food as something to go with them.",Mf4RAiWyGAs7LoMOaVksEw,0,0,4,fMmq3AYwXLCXK03nRNkDtA

My husband and brother got the footlong burritos which they both said they were bland. My brother also got the ranchero sauce to put on top and he was so glad he tasted it before he put it on his burrito because it was awful. It had a really weird taste like tomato sauce and slight enchilada sauce taste but no seasoning whatsoever. My sister and I ordered the carne asada soft tacos and the meat really wasn't that great. It had like a grilled weird flavor to it, my sister said the same thing. We got our son a soft chicken taco and he ate half and said he didn't like it. Overall the staff was nice that's why I gave it 2 stars but unfortunately my family and I agreed we'd never go back.",OK_vkRR2nO1cNWV5NGtoEA,1,0,2,3Qrt8qUG85bgpdCwoIEY5g

A few minutes when it was ready they also included another at no charge for their oversight.  I mean who does anything like that? It was just a few minutes extra I had to wait for my food which was no big deal. And then another plate at no charge. This is a great place.  Food is delicious. The salsas are excellent.

All the mats were hanging on the rails, and the young man was already putting away all the salsas. There were no other customers, other than a couple leaving and a gentleman standing by the register having a long leisurely conversation with the gal behind the counter. Neither staff acknowledged our presence. When the chat partner finally left, the gal leaves the counter and goes to the back while the young was still fiddling with the salsa containers. There was a long awkward silence until he finally, in resignation, (I guess we're just not getting the hint that they want us to leave) shuffled to the register and in a deflated manner, asked my husband if he could take his order. My husband asked for their combo, along with some fries and the gal yells from the back ""were out of fries."" That's when I had enough, and told him to cancel the order and that we'll be going somewhere else-that was the first sign of enthusiasm I got from him. He smiled as if he just won a grand prize. With a huge toothy smile, he kept saying ""have a good evening"" several times while we were walking out.

I like the ""made to order "" concept and the clear explanation on how to order at the drive thru order board.  I went with a grilled chicken burrito with rice, cheese, cilantro and enchilada sauce.  Ordered the gf some grilled chicken nachos.  Total cost for both under $10 - very reasonable !

The burrito tasted great ! decent sized ( they say the burritos are foot-long;  not sure if they are - my guess is, no ) liked the charring on the chicken chunks and just the right amount of cilantro.  slight ding for the enchilada sauce but overall, i liked the burrito.

The nachos were above average.  A little too much bean vs. chicken and more cheese definitely needed.  Still, a decent dollp of guac and sour cream - next time ask for extra cheese.

I'll defintely return

The food is good and the portions are large. You can choose the meat and add pico free but sour cream and guacamole cost more. I don't use that fattening crappie so no big. Since they make their own salsa, hot and mild, it is consistent and the salsa bar has chopped onion, cilantro and then sliced jalapeños so how can you go wrong. It is a small place and no real decor but go there to eat and leave.

I'm not much of a fan of the red or green sauce most places offer.

Upon entering, I was greeted in some foreign language I don't understand and was called out by the lady at the counter for not speaking in her native tongue.  Surely not a warm greeting to this 1st time customer.  I tried to order several items on the menu, but was limited on my selections as they were out of chicken & ground beef.  

I ordered 2 shredded beef enchiladas with verde (green) sauce, 1 bean & cheese burrito and 2 carne asada tacos.  The lady told me they didn't have verde sauce so I went ahead with the red.  After ordering, she questioned me again about why I didn't speak Spanish and asked if it bothered me that I didn't.  After waiting a few short minutes, they had my food boxed up and bagged ready to go.

When I got home, I was not at all shocked to see they fucked up on 2 of the 3 items ordered.  The bean & cheese burrito was rice and hardly any cheese and the shredded beef enchiladas were just cheese with no shredded beef...again, hardly any cheese.  Pretty much rolled tortillas drowning in red sauce.  The carne asada meat was half inedible gristle which I gave to my dogs.  ALL the food was cold...I live less than 3 minutes from this joint.

I should've bolted when the lady at the counter started to comment to her coworker that I didn't speak Spanish.  Also, there were no other customers...another red flag.  Well, she can't use the excuse of the language barrier as the reason they screwed up as I was charged for what I ordered on my receipt.

I had the two item combo with a chile relleno and a tamale, it comes with beans and rice for $4.99, had a drink with it for $1.79.

Let's start with the chile relleno, small for a relleno chile and with very little sauce on it for a chile relleno. It tasted alright, just not much of it. 

On to the tamale, I'm assuming it was chicken, since I saw a few threads of white meat in it,, sticking out of the masa. They might as well just serve masa, no more meat than there was in the tamale. Seriously, I saw no more than 6 threads of meat, maybe an inch long and the thickness dental floss, in the entire tamale. As I said, they might as well just serve masa.

The beans average, the rice surprisingly good, I like the taste of the rice, it was good.

The prices are cheap, but it's not very good. Maybe I should have ordered something else, I was so disappointed in the stick of masa, they called a tamale. If they had taken the few threads of chicken out, they could call it a vegetarian tamale and I would have known to order something else.

It was supposed to be $3.99 but I only got charged $1.39! Score! I already thought the original price was cheap. This came with 2 tacos, beans and rice.

I got the same thing I get at Roberto's, a tamale and shredded beef ""Mucho Nachos."" Yelpers were right again: the order is HUGE and inexpensive, and the shredded beef is really tasty. 


The tamale is...not awful. I mean, I'm still picking at it, but it's disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it. The masa is fluffy and I like mine denser. Plus the chicken is kinda dry and stringy. It was only $1.29 or something like that, but eh. 

Now the nachos are almost great. The container weighed a ton, and inside is a glorious, sloppy heap of nachos. Lots of guac and sour cream and fresh pico and plenty of flavorful shredded beef. BUT here's the thing: the chips don't hold up. I live about a mile away, and my first chip folded in half, soggy and chewy from the toppings. It would have been AWESOME if it were structurally sound, but this unfortunately had no crunch to it at all. I ate it with a fork and it tasted like a nacho casserole or something. I don't know what Baja Taco can do to fix this, but I would recommend ordering an extra thing of chips on the side so you have some crunchy ones.

And, finally, this one thing happened... when I walked in the cashier was emptying the lobby trash can.  I said, ""Take your time, I need to look at the menu anyway."" Someone then pulled up to the drive thru so she had to come back to the register anyway. You know where I'm going with this, don't you? That's right, she didn't wash her hands. She turned to wrap a giant burrito for the drive thru order and I said, ""You should wash your hands after..."" and she immediately did, apologizing and assuring me she normally does. (You're welcome, Guy Who Ordered A Foot long Burrito!) I won't pretend to be TOO shocked, because I work in the service industry too and I've seen it all. NO ONE is washing their hands enough.

I figured this place would be a super-dump cheap taxo-rheeah and I was very impressed with their food. In fact I asked if this was the only location in town since I believe they need to be everywhere like another establishment whose name I shall not mention (Robertos) on this review.

I would pick Baja Taco 3 times a week for dinner if my cholesterol/waistline could handle it... the prices are so good my wallet can handle it 7-21 times a week. For those of you who have challenges with math, that would be one day a week to three times a week.

The enchiladas are fabulous, cheesy, quick fried tortillas ENGORGED with cheese and then SMOTHERED with red sauce that really satisfies your desire for CHEESE and RED SAUCE.

I ordered the carne asada burrito, wet, smothered in sauce, with rice and beans.  Very big, and really good, but a little too much sauce.  

I've tried their nachos too, and that's a bargain for about $6, loaded all the way, plenty of chips, cheese, cream and even guacamole, it must be a couple pounds when they finish putting everything on it.  

Must try, great, inexpensive decent food.",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,1,1,3,So1SeMaWzSJ_xVAmlQuu6g

Definitely recommended.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,1,2,4,1IJ4bGknyJzuVSGhfSi2KQ

5576863,2014-06-07,2,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"I wish I could give this place negative stars as it seriously needs to go out of business the way it treats people's orders and their management talks to customers like they're idiots.

After waiting almost 20 minutes in the drive thru, i was served a custom combo burrito in a half way unwrapped piece of tin foil, falling out into the bag it was presented in.  I noticed that the drive-thru person was touching that lose food prior to putting it into my bag after touching a register to ring someone up behind me, touching the counter area, touching his face and head, then giving me the food.

They initially refused to refund my order, and blamed me for the loose food in the bag.  I spoke with a female manager who didn't provide her name and again, tried to blame me on their error.  She eventually provided the refund but refused to provide a receipt to prove this. 

I guess it was against my better judgement to give this business a second chance, but I will not be returning, ever and advise you, if you value food safety, quality, and cleanliness to avoid this location like the plague.",gvC9vVIQbTSPOpXvtiUbUg,6,1,1,QGLbSeZES4xX6cq5KGFkGQ
5707508,2013-03-22,0,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"Ok this is new to the area, this is where our Popeyes chicken used to be. This was the 2nd time that i tried this place. As i wanted to try something different from Robertos. The first time i tried the burrito, not bad but not the best i have had. However i thought i would give them another try. This time a family meal, the char chicken. Well needless to say with the one star i gave indicates the food was not good at all. So not good that i got sick and threw it all i mean all up. And all the night was sick. NEVER going here again. And then after reading another comment someone made that he saw a worker empty trash and not wash her hands, now have me really questioning the cleanliness of the restaraunt. 

I am so good and will be back to Robertos when i want my Mexican food fix, fast food style that is.

I had to edit this review to add that even at 1:30 pm i am still feeling ill so i thought to at least call them to let them be aware that something that i ate from there made me sick. At first the worker (not manager as one was not there) was shocked and understanding. Asked me to hold on then came back to the phone and tell me that she is sorry but its impossible that i got sick from anything there because they make all their food fresh! REALLY????? 

All i could say is ok thanks and hangup, KNOWING if they are that stupid to think that, then that definitely not a place i would want to eat at ever again.
STILL FEELING SICK THANKS!!!",LSw5J-mDFXr75jmYmRnWow,5,0,1,Y1xxBqWbphzljPB-NQaAgQ
5819958,2014-05-12,0,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"Okay so I made a review for this place back when they first opened, since then they have really gotten their shit together. 

I went in last night for a 3 item plate. I got a plain carne asada taco, chile relleno, and an enchilada. Everything was excellent except for the enchilada. It was like 3 small taco tortillas in one wrapped up to make it long but it didn't have enough meat in it. Does that make sense? Not enough meat/tortilla ratio.

Anyways the taco was perfect! Can easily compare to the one's you'd find on the east side. The meat was very flavorful. The chile relleno was good too, the sauce has great flavor.

My dislikes are simple peeves not enough to take any stars away.

1. I went right before they closed so they ran out of lemon, I got 3 tiny pieces but I feel like that's my fault for going so late.

2. The red sauce still doesn't do it for me. I prefer the home made salsa's and this one tastes like spicy pace :(


That's it! Everything else has so much flavor, especially the rice! I'm sad it took nearly 2 years for me to go back, but I'm glad I did and I'm glad they've improved.",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,1,0,5,rFXyV9hEkuQJQuTs9pg8uA
5911088,2013-02-14,0,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"Went here one night after an evening of debauchery. My friend and were curious of this place. The way we rate Mexican food places, is based on their Carne Asada fries. Man, I was not disappointed. The meat was chopped into small thin bits(which was good), was very lean, and flavorful. But if they want to make it better. A little less guacamole, it overpowered the whole dish. Employees were very nice too. I defiantly recommend this place.",rMwYUSvoDOaGQvGqSj_6gw,1,0,4,t2aS8zjo0L5CSaWmHtU1cA
5915285,2013-04-14,0,HnQVDNGFWOS5zle0dhpOkw,"Put this place on your cheap eats list people!
Portion to Price ratio is awesome!

We came here for lunch because of the advertisement coupon for $5 off a $10+ bill (we aren't cheap we are frugal!) 

We got 4 soft tacos
2carne asana
1 carnitas
1 chicken
Taquitos
Carne asada fries
The bill came out to a little over $12.00 after the coupon!



The carne asada as really dry and kibble-ish in both dishes. The carne asada fries were chocked loaded with cheese and pico. They used a battered type of french fry which kinda threw me off from normal french fries (which I prefer)
The carnitas and shredded chicken tacos were great! Both were moist and full of flavor. The stars of our lunch!

I'd dare to give this place 4 stars but I have to take a star away because the salsa bar was  horrendous and in dire need of attention. The salsa levels were all low and there were plastic cups and lids in every bin. Thank goodness we didn't need any salsa since the carne asada fries and tacos were loaded with pico. 

For the price, taste an portion size this is a  good alternative to those taco chain guys down the road.",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,2,0,3,azARDZLw-4ewD-Sy19_RBg
