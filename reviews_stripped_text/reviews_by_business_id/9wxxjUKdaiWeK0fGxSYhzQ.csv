Last night was my first night away from my two year old in a long time.  After seeing one of the most amazing shows I have ever seen, Michael Jackson Immortal we decided to go to Raffles Cafe for a small bite.  We entered Raffles and was seated pretty quickly.  Then we waited about 15 minutes for the server.  At 9:25 we ordered our food: soup, salad and French toast.  At 10:15, with our server no where in sight and no food to eat we walked out.",8tAEDBGPDI7boehWrTngiw,0,0,2,M9hESjokku7cfu1P9FOFNg

The smoked salmon could have been fresher in my opinion. Plus there's no cheese. I mean you can have cheese if you picked it as one of the two topping choices, but seriously, how plain is that. I really wish cheese wasn't a choice of topping, but instead to just let you have it. The hash browns that came with it was alright. I only ate the crispy pieces because what wasn't was kind of mushy and had a slight weird taste to it. That's what I thought because my sister who tried it said it was fine.

Friendly servers. Don't remember his name but the gentleman we got was very attentive but not overbearing so it made for an enjoyable meal. Not very busy at all on a Tuesday morning. The atmosphere is really pleasant and the whole restaurant looks really upscale.

Raffles Cafe was our final hurrah on this LV trip. In an effort to avoid the heaviest of traffic back to LA, we decided to settle on a non-buffet restaurant. We really wanted to eat at Serendipity, but ultimately elected not to because of wait times.

That said, where did we end up - Mandalay Bay? Again? Weren't we just here for the Muse concert? Yes, yes, and yes! We were all craving breakfast and yelp pointed us to Raffles Cafe. The composite 3.5 rating didn't excite me, but when you're hungry, food tends to be ... well, food.

I ended up ordering the Huevos Rancheros - eggs, fried tortillas, refried beans, chorizo, ranchero sauce, jack cheese, guacamole, and sour cream ($13 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=qDdSjXkLMaEOFLm4RgGAjQ). I was pleased with the portion size and it really hit the spot. It was perhaps a bit heavy, but after a night in LV, something like that helps.

One of my friends ordered their signature item, the Filet Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ?select=Lf1U5jfLnmhzDDYnHTYfhQ). I didn't try it, but it sure looked tasty - she enjoyed it. My other friend ordered pancakes ... and she began devouring them before I could snap a photo!

Raffles is not terrible. In general, I'd say unless you're lazy and are stuck at Mandalay Bay, make the effort to eat elsewhere. There are so many other great options in LV. Take advantage of it!",JTsIuvsmTlVLUxX42BkBIQ,1,1,3,FTiIXfx-8fSKG422DIKMnw
179719,2011-07-08,0,9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ,"For me ambiance is really important so if you go here...I strongly suggest getting a window seat.  We sat at a corner where windows came together and we overlooked Mandalay beach...it was very tropical and totally relaxing!  Just like the hotel that serves as both the inspiration and the namesake for this restaurant.  

YET - Be prepared to have 2 hours on your hands! 

First, let's get some general protocols out of the way.   1. The hostess only writes down your name if you are a large party (my party of 3 didn't qualify) - so go back and stand in line...and then when it is your turn while standing in line - you get seated. 2. Being me, I was friendly with the hostess...but the one that worked the day I visited just stared back at me like a zombie...thus made me felt so sad for her...why can't she smile?  What horrible things must be going on in her life?

Second, as soon as we were seated, we were provided with water - very fast water service.  Thank you! However...our waiter took 10-15 minutes to stop by. The place was not busy...so I have no idea why it took so long. 

Third, be prepared so that as soon as the waiter comes...get all your questions answered while he is standing there and order your food...else...he will go away to give you more time and then before you know it...30 minutes will have passed...and you still haven't ordered your food.

I ordered the Nicoise Salad with the dressing on the side.  It was a nice cold poached piece of salmon on good greens.  My husband ordered coconut pancakes.  The waiter said that given the change in chefs...sometimes 2 pancakes arrive - or maybe 3...he couldn't guarantee it...so we asked him to PLEASE make sure it was 3. Three came out and they were HUGE. My husband liked it for the sheer quantity however he felt the pancakes were pretty good not excellent.  He's a picky pancake eater.

Our friend ordered the chicken salad and he said it was very good.

We had time on our hands so the wait - at first was very irritating then we decided to accept it and it turned out to be really fun.  Our waiter was quite nice...he knew so much about the history of the restaurant.  And he was fun to talk to.  We all liked him and forgave him for being a complete slow-poke.

Truly, the food is okay hence I would give it  3 stars...however we had such a good time so 4 stars it is!  It is really the location of the table that affects the experience at this restaurant.  I really liked it and loved where we sat, I finally appreciated the relaxed service, and I will definitely return again!

I would say this is a casual restaurant (by Vegas standards) that has a slight upscale current...like there's potential to be upscale if...they wanted to improve their service from the way patrons are seated to the pace of getting their order.  

Enjoy it!!!",uN-tjdXAkZZSP7x_sEF8Dw,0,0,4,SSlKu0QSwjzApJJsjRF53A

Reading the reviews of this restaurant, I'm amazed that both times I've eaten there I've very much enjoyed both my meal and the service.  The eggs Benedict were so good that I came back to try the lobster and brie omelet.  I liked that as well.  Yes, it is overpriced, but really no more so than any other hotel-casino restaurant, and at least they do poached eggs (anybody from Planet Hollywood reading this?).

However, what sets Raffles apart is the food was actually very good and presentation is pretty fancy for a cafe.  The portions were also huge so  you can share one main dish and get a side salad and still be very full.

Sunday Night gravy- their version of what is basically spaghetti and meatballs.  It comes with one giant meatball and HUGE plate of pasta and sauce.  Very good, I'd recommend it.

Double-dusted fried chicken- all I have to say is O-M-G.  My friend ordered this and it made me regret ordering my spaghetti....even though I loved my spaghetti dish.  The skin is fried to a perfect, crunchy crisp with the perfect seasoning.  This dish is seriously to die for, you MUST order it.

Stopped by this weekend with a few girls and we had a variety of food.  I thought I should get some greens in me given the weekend of drinking ahead so I ordered one of their signature salads - Chinese Chicken Salad.  I should have known, Chinese Chicken Salad at a hotel cafe?  That was my first mistake.  When the salad arrived, the smell of vinegar in the dressing was overwhelming.  I have never had any dressing for any salad that used so much vinegar.  I literally had to hold my breath with each bite.  To make matters worse, the salad was $14.  Terrible!  I also had a couple bites from my friend's food since I could not eat my salad.  The pancakes my friend ordered was dry and bland.  But drenched in syrup, it was bearable.  The bacon and eggs my other friend ordered was good...but I guess it's difficult to mess up on that.

The hostess did recommend the chicken wings and nachos but we didnt get a chance to try it.

587189,2014-08-04,0,9wxxjUKdaiWeK0fGxSYhzQ,"Hubs and I caught a cab twice to check out  Raffles signature Bloody Mary at Mandalay Bay. We spied an astounding photo of this colossal libation-slash-meal on Facebook and knew we had to check it out.  Our first visit left us disappointed. We has no idea that this former 24-hour diner cut its hours back and is only open until 2:30 pm daily. 

We used to be Raffles regulars back when Mandalay Bay was our LV home. It's been a few years since and the restaurant is showing its age. Aside from the short hours, the restaurant has a worn out aura to it. Even the palm trees outside the window seemed old and in need of a good pruning. The change made me sad as I had many great memories of Raffles breakfasts and late night snacks. 

Back to the reason that brought us here. We each ordered a signature Mary and a Caesar salad (just because there was a nagging need to add something healthy to our meal). The salad was as good as I remembered. Crispy, juicy Romaine, tasty dressing and really good roasted chicken breast slices. 

The signature cocktail was okay but the fun of eating it elevated the experience. It is served in a BIG mason jar with a metal barbecue grill skewer loaded with a cheeseburger slider, slice of bacon, grilled cheese sandwich bite, chicken tender and fries. Hubs liked the burger and I really enjoyed the chicken. 

The gem of the meal was our waitress Yolanda. She was very pleasant, efficient and went out of her way to ensure we enjoyed our targeted outing. 

Overall, Raffles needs a facelift and better hours. I recommend checking out their signature drink if you happen to be there but don't make a special trip.

And I mean that in the nicest way possible, but I really, really, really despise it and everything about it. Sooo, while I didn't think it was fair to review the hotels or the clubs or much of anything else because I would most likely give em 1 star and just rip em apart (because again, I can't stand Vegas), I however thought it was worth telling you about Raffles. I ate at Raffles twice when I was there this weekend. Once because SJ demanded we late night eat at 4am and the second time, the next day, I was there for breakfast just a few hours later. 

The place is CAVERNOUS and during our 4am seating, we got put all the way in the back in a corner behind some palm trees. I have no idea why because let's be honest here. It's not like the classiest clientèle rocks up to a 24 hour diner (in Vegas!) at 4am so not sure who you were hiding us from. But no offense taken because we did start with the nachos - yes, I said ""start"" - which were about the size of, oh, a toddler give or take. To the amazement (horror?) of our waiter, we finished every goddamn chip on that plate. However, I think someone's eyes may have been bigger than their stomachs because we couldn't even touch a french fry, let alone the burgers that came out 20 min later. But it was delicious and massive portions for not a totally obscene price. Which is very refreshing in Vegas.

Next up to bat: breakfast! After noodling a bit on what to get - do I go healthy and get yogurt and berries or do I get what I really want, fried eggs, bacon and hash browns?? I of course opted for the fried option. Once again, big ol portions, tasty fare and a big carafe of unlimited coffee which is much appreciated after a heavy night. 

I am docking one star both for the sheer fact this is a 24 hour diner in Vegas but mainly because you stuck me in a corner. Nobody sticks CK in a corner!",0L6XAQ_wYgR2d4lfX43XTA,4,3,4,qO-oZbNGJ4QnfhcQ3LR92A

I read through many reviews, most of which were bad, yet I still came here because of the deal on www.restaurant.com

Was I disappointed?  NO

This is a diner/cafe and I reviewed it based on what I expect of a diner/cafe.  

FOOD:  3 stars

Spinach and Chicken Egg White Omelet

 The omelet wasn't greasy and salty which is a good thing for me. This was far from the best omelet I've had; it could have used a more diverse array of vegetables and bigger chunks of chicken.  It was definitely hearty and filling.  The hash browns weren't particularly impressive; they seemed like the stuff you get in bulk from the freezer aisle at Costco.  

Stuffed French Toast - Mixed Berries

The french toast was stuffed with a custard that wasn't overly sweet.  The berries on the side were very fresh and flavorful.  I'm not very interested in sweet breakfast foods, but I enjoyed this particular plate.  


SERVICE:  4 stars

Most the negative reviews I read were about the service. I wouldn't say the service was great, but it wasn't horrible.  

Our server wasn't particularly quick or charming, but she was efficient, accommodating, and attentive.  


VALUE:  3 stars

I probably wouldn't eat here without the restaurant.com deal.  Our $30 breakfast came down to $13.   The food is decent, but not proportionate to the prices.

You know, there is a lot I can say about this place. I will keep it down to the important stuff.

Of a table of six, three ordered omelettes with three ingredients each in them. All three omelettes had one of the ingredients missing. Only one omelette eater said anything and sent it back. Her omelette did not have the Jack cheese that she ordered. Ok, the waiter took the omelette back to the kitchen. Waiter then returns with the same omelette with a cold, hard slice of Jack on top of the omelette. You read me right. Instead of making a new omelette with cheese in it, some moron in the kitchen took the omelette, went to the refrigerator, grabbed a slice of Jack cheese, and just slapped it on top of the omelette. No melting. Just a cold slice of cheese slapped on top of an omelette. And then some idiot server thought that this was adequate and served it back to my friend. So, we all look at this omelette that has a slice of cold Jack cheese rocking back and forth over an omelette like a lever over a fulcrum with a look of incredible disbelief. So, with a moment of shock and hesitation, my friend asks, ""Uh, can I have the cheese melted?"" Annoyed waiter disappears with omelette and returns with the omelette. It looked as though they just nuked the plate so that the cheese just melted on top of the omelette. (Apparently this is how cheese omelettes are made in Vegas because all omelettes I have seen in Vegas have cheese melted on top of them instead of within the egg so that the egg is held together with cheese).

Granted this is during February when fruits in general are not the best but berries and melons are normally good.  The fruit was not ripe, the spinach was uncooked, the cheddar cheese not melted and the overall omelette cold.   We sent it back and got back a hot omelette and another bowl of berries but the cheese in the omelette was still un-melted cheese (grated and cheese) and the strawberries now old (tasted like a bowl of strawberries that has been in the fridge - all soggy from the frost).  The waitress was apologetic.   But come on guys Vegas is the food capital now and that is just unacceptable.  Note to chef: if fruit is not good don't serve and learn how to make a simple cheese omelette.    And while I'm on my rant, not having a kids menu in the main cafe of a large hotel that is ""family friendly"" is unacceptable.  And before I get any replies that no hotel in Vegas is kid friendly, Mandalay bay has the Wave Machine in the pool and the Aquarium exhibit and is known as one of the best family hotels.

My friends and I came here late one night because it was the only place open after midnight at Mandalay Bay (the only one we found, anyway). What awaited us was the worst waste of $80 the world has every seen. I'm hoping that it was just because we were there so late (and maybe they have the crap cooks/bartenders working the late-late shift), but I have my doubts.

We started by ordering a few cocktails...and perhaps that was our mistake. Afterall, it's not a bar...but still, you'd think that they couldn't screw them up too badly. Somehow, though, my Tom Collins and my friends' Amaretto Sour and Long Island Iced Tea all ended up tasting exactly the same...how is that possible, you may ask? I have no idea. They're all three very different drinks...and yet they were indistiguishable save by color. 

We were, however, willing to overlook crappy drinks because we were hungry and all we wanted was food. My friend and I split the Spinach & Artichoke dip...and were very sad we did. It was decidedly the worst I've ever had. It kind of tasted like it was from a box, or was leftover and had been warmed up for the occasion. Yikes.

My friends ordered a few other food items, which were better than the dip, but nothing to write home about.

First of all, it took them about 10-15 minutes for any server to even show up at our table to greet us. Other women kept coming up and saying someone would be with us in a minute but then minutes and minutes and minutes kept passing, and we were kind of on a time crunch. Finally, an older woman approached us seeming flustered. She asked us if we would like any drinks and we told her what we wanted, and also asked if we could order food. She said no, and that the women who takes food orders would be with us IN A MINUTE. 

Fives minutes later, the woman who takes food orders showed up. And I could barely understand a word that was coming out of her mouth. I ordered the Raffles Omelette ($16 - one of the cheapest things on the breakfast menu, unless you want an $11 cup of ""Tahitian vanilla-bean-SCENTED greek yogurt with house-made granola""). You get a choice of three ingredients to go inside of the omelette, and i ordered ""Sausage, Pepper Jack Cheese, and Mushrooms"".

15 minutes later, our food arrived. My tiny $16 omelette had to be made out of 2 eggs, tops. And it was FILLED with green bell peppers. I got a hold of the server 5 minutes later and told her ""I ordered Pepper Jack CHEESE, not BELL PEPPERS"". She apologized and said she would take care of it. 5-10 minutes later she brought out a new plate, and told me right off the bat ""They still put green peppers in it. I hope that's okay"". She put the plate down in front of me and the omelette was exactly the same, only with a square slice of cheap looking (probably Kraft) pepper jack cheese slabbed on top of it. I said ""okay"" and let her go. From this moment on I knew I was giving the place a one-star review. For these prices, this is travesty.

Sure enough, the food was all extremely bland. You could get better tasting breakfast food at DENNY'S.

Super nachos: FALSE advertising. When I saw this on the menu, i thought SUPER NACHOS? That must include EVERYTHING! NO, that was not the case. There was no meat in it whatsoever. There were, however, a LOT of toppings: sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and cheese cheese cheese. But none of it matters when all the cheese is burnt into the tortilla chips. We struggled getting one chip at a time. At this point, I used the fork and started playing with the nachos only to discover the inside being COLD and SOGGY.

And now we wait to try to flag down our lovely waitress again. 10 min pass by and this is what i notice:

At a table across the room, a man is trying to use the rest of his food credits and tells our waitress his intentions of doing so. His meal cost more than his credits, they go back and forth so she basically yells at him that he cannot apply his credits to cover his meal. When he explains that he will pay the difference (calmly), she nearly rips the receipt out of his hand and walks to the register. Personally, I would have snapped at a B if this were done to me, but I digress..

The table that just arrives next to us gets their food almost immediately, and what do they order? Super nachos. But their nachos not only look hot and fresh, they were nice and CRISP, not BURNT.



Finally, she gets back to our table and we inform her that our food is burnt. She does not apologize out of courtesy for the restaurant's sake, she only asks, ""Do you still want them?"" (OF COURSE I DON'T WANT THEM, WTF!) So goes on to ask if we want dessert. Since we weren't full, we decided, hey why not? BAD CHOICE. The brownie cake was sticky, a diabetes attack waiting to happen. And the ice cream on top? FROZEN ROCK SOLID. I guess they got the ice part right?

And when we got the bill, of course she charges us for the dessert! UGH! NEVER AGAIN!

[Dinner experience]

Our waiter seemed to be someone taken off the streets and was given a crash course in waitering prior to just serving us -- he wasn't well groomed, didn't seem friendly or did anything to make himself stand out, he just seemed very robotic.

Now, moving on to the food: for appetizers,  we ordered chicken tenders for $12. The food description failed to mention that you only get three chicken strips, and that they're served on a bed of thin cut fries. Should have been listed as an entree instead, those chicken tenders were nothing special at all, and only three chicken pieces on top of that? How insulting!

My friend ordered the Grilled Cheese, and their choice of cheese for the childhood favorite is fontina ... which I thought was very ... interesting. He loves Grilled Cheese sandwiches though, so he loved it, and also loved the fact that it was served with a bowl of Tomato Soup. However, I tried his sandwich, and was not a fan of it at all, haha. The cheese was too tart for me? I don't know, but it definitely wasn't my forte.

I ordered the Prime Rib Sandwich; overall, it was okay. REALLLLY big sandwich though, I had to use a fork to eat some pieces of meat to make it easier to hold. Other than that, and realizing that there was no cheese on my sandwich, it was good. The meat could have been flavored so much better, though. 

Total for all of that came to almost $60, what! Haha, it was a decent meal, but worth almost $60? Hell NO!

[Breakfast experience]

Probably because I never wake up early enough to enjoy a nice breakfast, I'm easily swayed to rate any breakfast experience a good one :)

Friend ordered some Banana-stuffed French Toast with some pecans thrown in there, and I had the ... Eggs Benedict (my favorite breakfast food!) Both were delicious, and the total for the meal was way more reasonable than our dinner from the previous night!

Overall, both experiences at Raffles were okay, but I have to ding a star because my waiter on the second trip there was really shady. He told me that I could use the rest of my $50 meal credit (given to me by Mandalay Bay staff) to tip him out, so I trusted and believed him, and upon checkout at the hotel, realized the guy lied to me and the staff was asking me to pay THEM (the hotel) the money I left in tip, which the waiter had already collected!

1- The manager with the awesome deep radio voice came and got the line moving. 
2- The decor was nice

Poor:
1- Dirty. Dirty place setting (place mats - 2 were dirty). Dirty Glass. Dirty flatware.
2- Messy. Towels / linens / serviceware was just stacked on side tables. It looked like my laundry room after the kids try to pull out the one tshirt from the bottom of the stack they want to wear and leave the rest. Not a major issue, just messy and shows a lack of concern on details.
3- Service. Understaffed or poorly organized. After first pass on drinks when we noticed red sticky stuff on the glass of apple juice we could never get a server to stop until food showed up.
4- Kindness. When seated we walked right by a nice table that was in front of a window with sunlight. We were seated at the next table that was right in the walk way to a private room. When I asked if we could sit at the other table I was told no, we were a party of four and five could sit at that table. I looked around and there were lots of open tables. I was surprised at the lack of concern with a specific request.
5- Food. I can forgive everything if the food rocks. But it was not to be. Surprised how Meh it was for the price. Seriously IHOP would have been way better (and I am not a big fan of IHOP). Nothing was wrong, it was just bland. Coffee was weak. Juice from concentrate. Food was mid level buffet quality. For the same dollars Bouchon would have killed it.

For the last two years we've had a get together in Vegas, and I've never been able to stay out late enough for the end-of-the-night/beginning-of-the-day Raffles breakfast that caps off the evenings activities.  I mean, really, I just CANNOT stay up until 8 a.m....or 2 p.m. for those real serious partyers.

BUT, on the last night we were in Vegas, my friends pooped out early (4:30 a.m.), so I was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for my first late-night/early-morning Raffles experience.  It is an interesting cast of characters there (clearly a number of couples who had recently met...probably just a few hours earlier) and, strangely enough, quite a line that late at night.  Too bad we weren't VIPs - we had to wait (albeit briefly) for a table.

After we waited nearly 20 mintues to place our order, I got the club sandwich and french fries (if I'm going to binge, I might as well go all the way), while the rest of the table ordered tons of other food - french toast, omlettes, corned beef hash, pancakes....all sorts of stuff.  I was quite satisfied with my club sandwich - it was actually way too huge for me to eat.  I am a huge corned beef hash fan, but the looks of that corned beef kind of gave me the heebee-jeebees (good thing I didn't order it).

Hubby had waffles which comes with 3 mini waffles.  I had bacon and eggs (I know, I know it's so boring, but that's what I wanted) and our friend had corned beef hash.  The hash is advertised as being homemade and was a very generous serving.  All in all, it hit the spot. 

However, I will say that there was a service issue.  I did not get the pancakes or cappuccino that I ordered.  I personally don't think it's my responsibility to remind a server of what I ordered (although if it's something I really want, then I will) - rather I think he/she should check the food against the order to make sure he/she has everything when she brings the food to table OR ask if we have everything.  Clearly neither occurred.

Yes the prices are not cheap.  But this is Vegas where everything is more expensive, even coffee at Starbucks.  So if you're gonna complain about how pricey this place is, you should consider going to one of the other casinos where you can eat at the food court.

Another comment or request I would make is: please put up some signage (like many of the other MGM ""cafes"" have) to distinguish the line for M Life Platinum and Noir cardholders.  I hate going to the front of the line and looking like I'm cutting and then have a woman in line who thinks I'm cutting tap me on the shoulder where we engaged in the following conversation:

Her:  excuse me, are you trying to get seated?
Me:  yes.
Her:  this is the line here (pointing to herself and the long line of people)
Me:  I have a platinum card
Her:  does that mean you don't have to stand in this line?
Me:  yes
(at which point hostess proceeds to seat our party)

My friend said he thought they used to have a seperate line so maybe they just didn't put it up today.  Either way, please put something up so we can avoid those awkward moments like the one described above.  Thank you!",jdqEAF7Na0dKRzSDQ0daGA,0,0,3,QLB1YhQmvESv0F_t-q6qSA

When I ate here I was in a big group at around 4am. That being said it was a fun time, drunk people funny stories, and a bit of acting. 

Anyways, I never understand why it takes so long to sit a large group at 4am.  With all the empty tables I guess they just couldn't decide which ones to put together for us. That wasn't a problem, someone in our group pretended to be the host while the host was gone. Some other people asked to be seated and I can't remember what happened next but it was pretty funny.

The food comes out at a decent time. I ordered the Nachos and they were pretty massive. The first few bites tasted good, I was hungry so it would be hard not to fill me/impress me at that point. But, they are definitely a food for sharing because they got cold real fast. 

The price was in line with the overpriced 24 hour cafes of Vegas. Basic economics, supply and demand and a bit of market segragation. I just want something in my stomach at this time of the day, I don't need a fat plate of nachos for a ridic price! Where's my $5 20 piece nuggets? There are cheaper alternatives on the strip, just make sure you go to them before coming back to Mandalay. 

If the price was more reasonable, or the nachos didnt get cold so fast I'd probably give it a 3.  I love Mandalay Bay, I just know better than to eat here at night.",Aj8JQkY0opGp6gTbGrItjg,1,0,2,epNC6LZtTZzKHwSpxaZkhQ

Lt. Frank Drebin: Every time I order out.

        --The Naked Gun 2 1/2

I never gamble when I'm in Vegas.  I can't even remember the last time I did, I was probably like 22 or something.

So, the only real gambles are the risks I take with where I go to eat. I decided I shouldn't only keep returning to Citizens for breakfast, so we opted to come to Raffles one day during our stay at Mandalay.

The server we got was the type that you could tell doesn't like her job at all.  It really detracted from our experience. She was abrupt and when others in the party tried to be personable she showed about as much personality as Ben Stein as the teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off. How she handled a billing issue at the end of our meal was extremely unprofessional. 

The food could've been the saving grace, but aside from decent Canadian Bacon as my side, the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes were underwhelming.  They barely provided any cream cheese frosting on them - you get 3 pancakes and the cream is basically enough for maybe one or one & a half.  It was a waste of carbs.

While in town my friend (she does a fitness blog) told me: you're in Vegas, eat whatever you want.  Next time I doubt that will be Raffles, unless I'm in a drunken stupor or have amnesia.

Service was great. We were seated right away by the hostess. We were asked what we wanted to drink and were served them by another nice woman. Our orders were taken and our food was served by a nice gentleman. Even with some commotion going on in the kitchen (sounded like someone got hit by a door and dropped some dishes), the atmosphere was quiet and romantic. 

The menu was limited (which is fine by me) and printed on a large 2 sided card but the selections available all looked good. My wife ordered the 8 oz Angus ground sirloin burger, medium, with pepper jack cheese. They offered American, Swiss, Provolone or Pepper Jack if I remember right. She ordered fries as her side (included). She said her burger was cooked perfectly and it really was a whopping 8 oz. So big the roll had trouble keeping it all together. She said it was juicy and full of flavor. The fries were crisp and hot, not greasy.

I ordered the Eyecandy club on wheat toast with cole slaw on the side. The club had turkey and roast beef with bacon, lettuce, tomato and 2000 island (thats what they call it) dressing. It was fresh and it was huge. I could only eat half. We ended up splitting the other half later in our room. The cole slaw was fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of sweetness. Each platter also came with a whole pickle.

I found 4 bucks for a Pepsi to be a bit high but yeah I know, it's Vegas.

Food: I got a signature cheeseburger and he got a few sliders.   Both our dishes came with fries and let me tell you, they are not stingy with the fries! We even had leftovers that I was tempted to take back, but knew it wouldn't taste too good since we didn't have a microwave.

We ended up eating at Raffles Café after finding out the hard way that TheCafe at TheHotel was closed for the week that we would be staying there. That sucks for us! We walked from TheHotel through the casino at Mandalay Bay, and ended up at Raffles. It was around 12:30pm on the Monday of Thanksgiving week, and there was no line to be seated. My wife, 2 year old, and I sat down at the table where we were seated, and we decided to say a little prayer before we ordered. The waiter was nowhere in sight at this point, so we figured it wouldn't hurt. As we joined hands and started praying, our waiter interrupted us and, without an introduction, asked to take our drink orders. A little shocked in the moment, but not totally surprised due to the not-so-stellar Yelp reviews, we shook it off and ordered. 
There was a sign out front for coconut pancakes with mango butter as a daily special, so my wife ordered that for my daughter, she ordered a grilled vegetable Panini, and I got a Greek salad. Bear in mind that the menu on their website is different from the menu we were given. It looks like Raffles or the web-design crew needs to pay more attention to detail.  
Anyway, so after our negative first impression, the food comes out and we noticed that something was missing- well, something other than my daughter's silverware or drink, which is one of my pet peeves because it gives the feeling that my kid isn't counted as a person. The pancakes came out with regular butter, as my wife pointed out, and we started doubting ourselves that we read mango butter from the sign in the front. We asked the waiter the next time he came around, and he said that there was no mango butter today, but he could check in the back and see if there was any. Pet peeve #2 is when I, as a consumer, feel like a business is withholding the truth about a product that I'm purchasing. 
Anyway, we got a helping of mango butter after the waiter found some in the back, and I don't think we saw him after that. The manager came by and finished up our service. We finalized the check, which was about $44 after tax, and left. I felt displeased that the waiter left and didn't tell us. We were kind of wondering where he went, as we weren't checked up on for a bit. 
It does stink that TheCafe is closed, because we would have loved to eat there instead. Maybe if we were into corn beef hash, we would give Raffles a fair chance. But, I think that we left there feeling a little sour about our experience.

That night, we were looking for a place to eat and after trying to get across the street numerous times to go to Panda Express, we opted for a restaurant inside Mandalay Bay instead, since the hotel was right at the starting line. After looking at our restaurant options, we decided on Raffles Cafe.

On first glance, Raffles Cafe is an upscale version of a cafe, with more reasonable prices than most of the Mandalay Bay restaurants.

Upon reaching the hostess station, we were told it'd be at least a 20 minute wait for a party of 5. After what felt like a lot less time, we were seated and our waiter came to take drink orders. He gave us a moment then returned with our drinks and took food orders. Three in our party ordered soup and he brought that promptly. The baked potato and roasted tomato soups were very good, I'm told. 

After that, there was no sign of our waiter until he brought the rest of our party's food. At that point, we saw him once at our table to see how we were doing but other than that, he was inattentive and stood at the waiters station gabbing with his fellow waiters instead of paying attention to his customers. 

As for the food, my Black Angus burger was juicy but had a slightly burnt flavor to it. The bottom bun was not toasted enough to keep the juices from making it soggy by the time I got it. The fries were yummy, though, with a nice sweet and salty seasoning on them that reminded me of the seasoning on fries at a place back home in Tulare, California called Wimpy's. 

One of the other adults in my party also had the Black Angus burger, she said hers was good. The third adult had a sandwich with ham, roast beef and turkey. It was huge and he said it was pretty good. My children had the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. Both disliked the sandwiches, saying the cheese, which was fontina, didn't taste good at all. They've had fontina before, though, and both enjoyed it in other places. I don't know whether the fontina at this restaurant was just a different brand, or what the matter was with it, all I know is they didn't enjoy it and the waiter was nowhere to be seen to try to get something different for them until it was too late.

After this experience I'm not sure I'd recommend this restaurant, not without another visit, but being from out of town, I don't know how soon it will be before I return to Las Vegas and especially since I do I know of other restaurants that are a much better value for the money.

Huevos Rancheros with eggs over easy:  Don't wig out if you can't spot the eggs, they're under the giant mound of cheese, sour cream and guacamole.  This was an awesome dish.  I love everything about it.

Coconut Pancakes:  Ask for the mango butter on the side not on the pancake.  The butter had a hint of citrus in it and I didn't like it but after I scrape the butter off it was hands down yummy!  Ask them to give you a little bit of carmel sauce with bananas and the pancakes are irresistable.

I believe they've changed their entire staff (servers, chefs, etc.) because their menu has changed and the food tastes mildly different.  They don't have the Chicken Alfredo anymore, when that was all I was craving for for two days! :(  BOOOOOO!!

The night before, the wait was also an hour.  That has *never* happened at Raffles before.  The hostess claimed there were only 5 sections of the restaurant open for seating, so my guess is they didn't have enough chefs available in the kitchen either 1) it was Christmas or 2) they've been reducing the amount of staff members [the poor Mandalay Bay customer service and shitty economy blows].",3KK7L2Q6NMfJA1Ky4Ntmdg,2,4,3,y9oLxYJoQZz3HsWGf0SiZQ

Came with sourdough toast which was excellent, nice flavor, very fresh.  It also came with bacon, which we requested crispy ... however, they plated it under the soupy grits, so that took all the crispiness away except for the ends that poked out.  

Our other entrée was a breakfast Panini with scrambled eggs, bacon (asked for crispy and got it), pepper jack cheese and avocado spread ... pressed and toasted into a yummy sandwich.  Simple shredded potato home fries on the side, hot and crisp.

Raffles Cafe... located in Mandalay Bay, was the spot that we decided to catch a late one after missing out on dinner buffets.... by the time we were hungry enough to eat, it's already 9:45pm so we had to settle for cafe instead.

Our party ordered 2 dishes since we were too hungry (had a nice buffet at lunch!)  

1) Fried Chicken with Veggies 
2) Strawberry Pancake

The serving was decent... Had 4 pieces of fried chicken (which were fried to perfection with lots of crunch and resistance to it...) Then steam veggies because we were trying to healthy!  LOL!  

Strawberry pancakes were ok, had some (not a lot) of fresh strawberries but not enough for the portion served. 

The theme was suppose to be a replacement of Roscoe's chicken & waffles, but instead, it's Henry's Chicken and strawberry pancakes.  With a combination of pancake, lightly covered butter spread, cruncy chicken on top it's actually pretty good!  

The cost came out to be  around $40 with Tax and Tip.... pretty steep for 2 dishes at a cafe in Vegas!  Oh well, it's Vegas right?  Let's hope those slots will help me out in the near future!

Service was decent.... not the greatest but ok..... The atmosphere was real nice though.

Parting note... the next day we had the Bayside buffet and realized that they served the same chicken...... hmmmm.... hope they were leftovers from the buffet because it's around their closing time.... the chicken sure came out pretty quick being so crunchy and all.......

SERIOUSLY. this is the worst service i've EVER had in my life and i've had some shitty service. 

ok let me start from the beginning, i've been wanting to eat here a handful of times but never got to it and finally on our last morning and i decided to eat here before we checked out. 

we got seated around 10:30 AM..usually i get my drink order within 5 minutes but no...it took almost 20 minutes for our waitress, stacyann (BEWARE IF SHE IS YOUR WAITRESS ASK FOR ANOTHER ONE OR LEAVE) to come for our drink orders i ordered cranberry and my friend ordered coffee..and she was about to leave and i told her we wanted to order and she gave the ""my shit don't stink face"" and said uhm ok. 

i ordered the open face turkey sandwich, something that my mama loved and really hard to find, and my friend go the french toast. 

we got our drinks within 5 minutes and during that time i read the quick tip about stacyann being horrible...great just my luck, but i wanted a good last meal in vegas so i brushed it off. i got my cranberry juice and i was thirsty so i took a BIG gulp and almost spit it out. it was DISGUSTING it was watered down had some sort of carbonation and a slight hint of cranberry. i asked for another one and once again she gave me the ""my shit don't stink face"" UGH she brought it out and this one was good, but i started to feel sick like i drank someones leftover cranberry juice. anyways i drank that down to get that nasty taste out of my mouth and i asked for a refill (ok hint i said REFILL) she said that there was no more cranberry juice but that i can have OJ. i said whatever and she brought it out w/ the food 30 MINUTES LATER

i was REALLY upset and wanted to eat and leave so my BF asked for the check right away and it took her 40 MINUTES TO GET THE CHECK WTF!!!!!!!!!!! ugh and when we got the check she charged me for the cranberry juice and the OJ and when i told her why she said juices aren't refillable. WHY COULDN'T SHE SAY THAT EARLIER? and really w/ that NASTY cranberry shouldn't she have not even charged us? UGH we just paid and left and gave her a big fat 0 tip. honestly she shouldn't be a waitress esp at a las vegas hotel. she put us in such a bad mood for the next couple of hours.

so some one else gets a shrimp pesto pasta.  lets just say pesto is made out of very FEW ingredients.  now this pesto tasted like it consisted of the following ingredients: olive oil, basil and pine nuts.  so is there anything missing from that list... oh yeah..... CHEESE!  how can you forget cheese in pesto.  okay this might have been easily forgiven if the waitress bought out extra cheese on the side.  except she was no where to be found... so my friend was stuck eating tastless pasta.  lets just say if i come here again i am sticking to the breakfast items.  since the other half of my party had that and well they though t it was okay.",nW4POvJR2MqjU90mnNPqvA,1,1,1,6qUg3Abi407zwV3bd1gLLA

This time we went for a late-ish dinner because we had a comp, given to us by the manager the LAST time, due to the horrendous service and the major kitchen screw-ups.  

I decided to order the New Mexico Chicken Salad, but realized before I gave my order to the waiter that THAT was the dish I'd had problems with before.  Still, it was the only thing on the menu that appealed to me.  So I told the waiter to make sure to tell the kitchen that I expected to get fresh, warm chicken that wasn't the dried-out block of ice I had - and returned - and was comped for - the last time.  

The service was definitely better than the non-existent service we experienced on our last visit, so we didn't wait too long for my salad and the Club Sandwich my husband ordered.  But when the bowl was put in front of me, I couldn't believe what I was looking at.  The chicken was shriveled, and so dried out that I couldn't even stab a piece with my fork.  It sat on a mess of soggy iceberg lettuce, mixed with tiny chunks of vegetables and black beans.  I was furious, because I'd gone out of my way to put the kitchen on notice in advance.

When I asked the waiter about the iceberg lettuce, he said ""Oh, the kitchen can make it with romaine.""  As for the chicken, he saw that it was a disaster.  He took the dish back, and when he brought the replacement, it was EXACTLY as it should have been:  warm, moist, FRESH chicken, on fresh romaine, with a beautiful melange of vegetables and black beans.  FYI, the menu specifically states that the salad is made with romaine.  

My question is:  Why, oh, why do they care so little that they can turn out this absolute CRAP and try to pass it off on customers, hoping they won't complain?  And what good is a comp if the same problems keep recurring?  

For the record, my husband's club sandwich was just fine - a huge combination of enough turkey, roast beef and bacon to feed a small army, with a large portion of well-done and tasty fries.  Otherwise, this would have been a one-star rating (because zero isn't an option).

But also for the record, the signature dinner rolls, which had been so delicious that they were the one reason to return to Raffles, didn't get served until I asked for them.  And even then, they didn't taste right:  the crispy top tasted a little sweet, and the roll itself was tasteless.  Someone's been messing with those, too.

Will we go back?  Sure, because we have another comp, from another previous disaster of a meal there.  I didn't have the stomach to try to get one from this last experience.  Enough is enough.

It took awhile to be seated, and the service here was at a decent pace.

I ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice, which came in about a 12 ounce glass for a whopping $5.00. I also ordered the make it yourself omelet which came with hash browns and toast. The orange juice was actually not bad, not like some places where you order fresh squeezed and it tastes like it's straight out of a carton box.

I'm not one of those pretentious Four Seasons guests who needs the best food in the world but I expected better from an on-strip hotel. The food was clearly quickly thrown together and the flavors of a basic club sandwich didn't gel at all.

1st visit:
When I first got here I was seated very quickly so that was a plus. Then when I got to my table that's when the wait started. I waited there for at least 15 minutes before I was asked if I wanted a drink. Normally this would really annoy me and it did at first then I observed this waitress carrying several trays with an impressive amount of food on them. She was running around everywhere.  And the hostess who sat me was running her here and running here there. That's when I realized she was the only one working. She really was doing her best and she was working her ass off. When she finally came to me she apologized and was so sweet. She was stressed but she never took that out on anyone. She took my drink order and bought that out right away. I was going to order the lobster omelet but the waitress asked me if she could recommend the Lobster Benedict. I wasn't sure cause I never had Eggs Benedict before so I did not know what to expect really. Well it turned out to be really good! I really enjoyed it and it had a generous amount of lobster on it. The service was great and my waitress checked up on me often. I also enjoyed the food so 5 stars here. 

2nd visit:
I was looking for a nice meal on my last day. I remembered the food and service of this place so I came on back again. This time I was waited on very quickly and I ordered a traditional 2 egg breakfast and it was very good. My service was good as well. It was not the same server but he was also very attentive and my food and drink came quickly. I enjoyed this experience as well.

The prices here are typical Vegas prices, inflated of course, but for Vegas normal. The serve breakfast and lunch and they offer traditional cafe type foods. I personally think their breakfast menu is better than their lunch menu as far as what they offer but that is just me.

With that said our waitress was in the weeds the entire time with too many tables to handle us but she did her best.  She knew she was in the weeds but bringing us two of every juice or Soda so she wouldn't have to come back.

Food Corn Beef hash was Ok if not dry.  Eggs Benedict was good and hashbrowns tasty.  Balance of the meal was average at best but the real winner was the French Toast that was fresh, fluffy enormous and just dam good.

My boyfriend and I got there around 10am and the restaurant was pretty full and people looked like they were enjoying themselves (definitely a good sign).  We decided to share the Norway Benedict (smoked salmon, potato pancakes, with chives, red onions, capers and a Hollandaise sauce) and the Spinach and Chicken Egg White Omelet (something a little healthier to balance out the other dish).  The Norway Benedict was super yummy but definitely not something you can have a lot of because it is so rich.  The Egg White Omelet, on the other hand, was a little bland but I definitely felt good eating it.

We knew we were getting huge Bloody Mary's so we ordered accordingly. We split the lobster benedict. It was very good. I was concerned with some of the mixed reviews on this site but honestly, this was a great dish. The lobster was tender and prevalent. The hollandaise was lighter which complemented the lobster. The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was crispy. Even the hash browns were cooked nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was perfect.

Our Bloodys were a meal unto themselves. The slider, the chicken finger, the grill cheese, the crispy bacon and the french fries was a great addition. The chicken finger was the best of the bunch. The bacon was super crispy and meaty. Fries and burger pretty good. The burger patty itself was tasty. What made it suffer was the bun. The bread on the grill cheese also made it less than stellar. How can you mess up grill cheese? especially with all the good bread and seasoned griddle you have from all the breakfast cooking? They could make it better and it would be so so worth it. We got the bottomless option for 16 dollars and got a few each making it a great value. The spice mix was really there on the traditional bloodys. my next round I had the one made with clamato and while it was light and refreshing, there was little kick to it. Good for me since I had a lot of spice in my first drink, maybe not to others. My BF got the smoked bloody that was made with makers mark for his second round and he really enjoyed it. I thought it as just OK. If you love bourbon you should try it. I do like bourbon and am adventurous but I guess I just have it too ingrained in my head what a Bloody Mary should be.

We were seated quickly and the waitress took our orders. The price range was pretty high for a Vegas cafe late night menu, but it's the Strip, so whatever.  She delivered our drinks and then our food. It was mediocre at best.  Then, she pulled a David Copperfield and disappeared for the rest of our meal.  We kinda wanted refills on our waters and $4 Pepsi's, but no server and none of the other employees looked twice at us. We waited forever for the check and when it arrived my grilled cheese was rung up as a $13 chicken noodle soup with (grilled cheese $6.50) underneath.  I asked and she said she had to ring it up that way because there was no button for the grilled cheese sandwich. Whaaaa???? I said, ""so it's $6.50?"" ""No, $13""--then she took off again.  We paid our bill, reluctantly gave her a 10% tip and left. And told everyone entering to run away. Quickly.  Oh yeah...and we took all the pens she brought to sign the credit card slips.

This past weekend it was Mandalay Bay, and our food credit was only good for the buffet or Raffles. We never landed at the buffet, mostly because we kept missing breakfast, and that is the only buffet that I am usually game for. 

From Raffles, we had breakfast, smoothies, and club sandwiches. For breakfast, I had the standard eggs, toast, hashbrowns and bacon. The eggs were odd. They somehow managed to be both bricky and runny, which defies the laws of physics. However, the hashbrowns and turkey bacon were great. The berry smoothies were not good in the slightest. The best I can say is that they tasted cold.

Based on those items, you may be wondering where the 3 stars came from. The answer: the club sandwich. This little guy was definitely tasty. So tasty that my husband ordered it 3 times, and I shared it with him once. I especially appreciated the sour dough bread. And, special orders don't upset them, so if you want it without mayo, on wheat, with turkey bacon, Thousand Island on the side, and want to substitute fries with hashbrowns, no problem!

VENUE/SERVICE: Raffles Cafe is located next to Noodle Shop inside Mandalay Bay. It's Mandalay's signature non-buffet casual fare. Depending on what time you go there may be a line but when I was there within 15-20 minutes my party of 3 was seated. When my other cousins who aren't morning people went to take our seats a bit more than an hour later there wasn't a line. Our table was located in a corner. Service was good.

All of us got the Corned Beef Hash ($16.95) as it was one of the breakfast specials. The only difference was that we all got different toasts. I got the white, my cousin got the wheat and my cousin's friend got sourdough. Considering I took a quick glance at this restaurant's overall rating, I was VERY pleasantly surprised at my dish. It was a perfect mixture of potatoes and meat. The hash and some of the pieces of meat were very crunchy. The beef had a lot of flavor. On closer inspection I actually saw pieces of beef fat. As there wasn't as much fat as the meat and contributed to the overall flavor quite nicely, I didn't mind at all that the fat was there.

There are two cons, one of them being entirely my fault. The first con is that for $16.95, the dish IS pricey, but what do you expect from the Mandalay? Mandalay ain't known for being cheap. The second was that when I went to eat here I was suffering from a pretty bad hangover.  The smell and taste of the corned beef hash, while excellent, was a little overpowering and I had to fight back my nausea. I had to take the dish to go and finish it back at the hotel room when I felt a less nauseated. The dish tasted better when fresh as all the oil made the meat and potatoes a little soggy.

The next time I am around the Mandalay Bay/THEhotel area I will recommend this place as a casual dining option. Thanks to my cousin and her friend for bearing with me and for the Advil, I really appreciated it.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,1,1,4,2Z_UzGwLq0DNeMZj2hjG_A

No, this is not a line from Grandmaster Flash but literally, there were shards of glass underneath my table!!!

I was eating with my friends this morning when I felt something wet on my foot.  When I looked down, I was shocked to see my foot covered in blood!  I became nauseated and wanted to faint.  I called the server to ask for a band aid and told him that I had cut myself on a piece of glass.  As I examined the floor I found more broken pieces!   When the server disappeared for more than TEN MINUTES I then asked for the Manager who took another FIVE minutes to attend to me.  WHY WERE THEY TAKING SO LONG!?

When the Manager came, that is when I realized Mandalay Bay will hire just anyone who will work the graveyard shift.  The manager's attitude about the entire situation was disappointing and disrespectful.  There I was, bleeding profusely (cut was pretty deep) and she didn't rush over to me because she said she was waiting for security because that is their policy.  I understand business has policies but I what I don't is why she couldn't come over immediately to assess the situation.  The cafe was empty (it was 6am) and I was flagging down every server to get the Manager.  The demeanor and tone she used made me feel like she really didn't give a crap about her customer.  

All she had to say was, ""I'm sorry this happened I will get security to help you with first aid."" but when I told her that she said with attitude, ""I cannot apologize because then I'm claiming liability.  Also, our business policy states that you cannot be barefoot."" Which got me more upset because I came in wearing heels!  I took them off while eating .  I've seen kids crawling on the floors at these restaurants what if a piece of glass had cut one of them?!  What if someone fell and sliced their wrist on the glass?!  

Mandalay Bay used to be a high-class resort with excellent customer care but they have definitely lost their value.  Maybe that is why their room rates were significantly lower than the others on the strip- no one is staying there anymore.  They have nice rooms but I don't think I will be coming back here anymore.

I hope someone at Mandalay Bay can address this rude Manager at Raffles Cafe and get her fired.   She's a black girl, in her early thirty's with glasses I didn't get her name, right when I started filing a complaint she disappeared.  She should not be allowed to work in any customer service position.

Raffles Cafe serves the typical American type food here in the Mandalay Bay Hotel.  Yes, I've read the many reviews prior to eating here.  Reviews has it's up's and down's.....I was tired......I was hungry.....It was 4am...I had to be at the airport at 7am....most of the restaurants are closed here....Raffles Cafe was open 24 hours and I could have anything on the menu from Breakfast to Lunch to Dinner choices.....and I didn't want to count on eating airport food.

So as I entered the establishment and was seated with a menu.  Being so tired I just asked my waiter for some Orange Juice to start me off.  I couldn't figure out what to eat after reading various reviews.  So, I asked the waiter ""What is the Best Dish He's had here"".  And he recommended the Eyecandy Club Sandwich.

The Eyecandy Sandwich is a Roast Beef, Turkey, Bacon and Cheese Sandwich on a toasted bread.  Comes with Fries.

I was glad......but now I was trying to figure out how to take the first bite.  OMG!!  Let me see if my mouth will open up this big for the first bite.  I'll smash my sandwich as much I could before taking the first bite.  Ahhh....OK....First Bite....The Roast Beef....umm......not bad....the beef is fresh ....the turkey....not bad, not too dry....ok...the sandwich was good.  Next the fries....Nah....McDonalds is better.  One or two sticks of the fries is all I could handle.....Just something about the fries that was a big turn off.  Too crunchy....too oily....felt as if it would upset my stomach....so I stayed away from the fries.  I had my freshly squeezed Orange Juice to keep me happy.

Overall experience was a 3 star.
Eyecandy Sandwich was a 4 star.
Fries was a 2 star.
Orange Juice was 4 star

This place is located in the far corner of the Mandalay's casino floor. 

The lighting and decor of this establishment are very odd. Definitely half staffed late at night or so I thought because of how long it took for us to get drinks along with our food. I ordered a egg white omelette  with veggies (I'm watching my figure) and my brother had the club sandwich. This places gives generous portions and happily refilled our drinks about 4 times.. The sandwich looked ten times better than the eggs but both were better than what I expected....

If you're tight with El Papa and you scored a 7:30 dinner reservation,  what if your ass isn't hungry at 7:30? What if you're hungry at 5:30? What if it's 7:27 and you're on a roll at the craps table? Do you walk away because you have a reservation or stay and risk going hungry? 

Screw you Vegas!! I need to be impromptu with my meals. I'm not a planner! I'm not commital and needing to adhere to an itinerary while on vacation is not my idea of a good time! 

A few years ago we were 20 minutes late for a reservation at China Grill that I had made weeks in advance and we almost lost our table!  Whatever Vegas... ok I get it... ur cool now... don't forget who kept u alive in the 80's when all you had to offer was the Flamingo, Imperial Palace, The Riviera, The Stardust, Tropicana, Bally's and JOAN RIVERS!... Yeah that's right bitchessssssss!!! Your ""brat pack"", ""Elvis"" and ""mobster"" glory days were history! Your legacy fizzled and at your low point, you were right up there with Laughlin....  did u read that? yeah, that's right.... I said it LAUGHLIN!

Now that you're slowly rising up from the ashes how dare you poo poo on your true blue patrons who stood by your side when the going got rough? You think it was easy for us to stand by your side in the 90's when all you gave us was more bullshit in the form of the Mirage, Treasure Island, MGM, and The Rio? uhhhh noooo... you're bearly redeaming yourself nowadays with Wynn's new shit, Rehab at Hard Rock, The Hotel and Mix Lounge at Mandalay Bay, and Toa at The Venetian...so SCREW YOU... I knew you back when fool!!! 

This is where 24 hour RAFFLES comes in....Raffles doesn't require reservations, Raffles doesn't cost too much and Raffles won't disappoint. I've had breakfasts, lunches, dinners, midnight snacks, and early morning snacks here. No matter what time it is you're bound to find something on the menu that is to your liking.  I think the best way for me to describe Raffles would be to say it's a cross between Denny's and Cheesecake Factory. I've had the ribs, the fajitas, a few salads, the baked potato soup, the fried chicken, the grilled shrimp wrap, the club sandwich and yet my favorite has been the side of macaroni and cheese with lots of black pepper. (UPDATE: The menu has changed and they no longer serve macaroni and cheese or tater tots! There you go again messing my beloved shit up Vegas!!! Booooo!) Whatever, the fries and bread are so good I can still carbload with those... I still love this place!",5DgFmyjW6hkBtXtTMKl4tA,2,2,4,zcwKFgScTwwVhG7CPLz5Mg

five of us went down to raffles for breakfast friday morning.  the restaurant was not busy, so tell me... why did breakfast take an hour and 45 minutes?

time it took to get seated (and awkwardly shuffled around to different waiting areas by the hostess): 10 minutes.

time it took for us to get acknowledged by someone: 15 minutes.

time it took for that someone to get our waters: 10 minutes.

time it took for our actual server to come and take our orders after we got our waters: 10 minutes.

time it took for our food - all breakfast... EGGS, for god's sake - to come after we ordered: 45 minutes.  45 f-ing minutes!

time it took for us to eat of our mediocre, lukewarm, barely a step above denny's food:  5 minutes.  we were starving.  yet, that didnt make the food taste any better.

time it took for us to get our bill: 10 minutes.

= 1 hour, 45 minutes.

For lack of a better word, I'd say the pricing was predatory.  No reasonable combos; stingy portions; everything gets treated as an add-on.  The waiter was disinterested in serving us and seemed generally rude.  We were seated way too close to other people despite the place being generally empty.",5j_yYJ8lICnjPrUfjVAyJQ,0,0,2,LPziA13Qt2id5eUvp-1k5g
