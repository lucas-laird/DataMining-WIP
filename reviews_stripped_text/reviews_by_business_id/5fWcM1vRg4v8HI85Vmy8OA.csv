She then brings a stack of bags and places them on the counter and the guy cashier is just staring into space I ended up grabbing the bag and bagging my own sandwich! What a joke!

I told him it's because they use real food.

Service: Outstanding!! Seriously. Couldn't be better.

So, why not 5 stars? One of the reasons I used to drive so far to JJ's was because of the sprouts. I. Love. Sprouts. Please bring back the sprouts. You're still the best sub shop, better with sprouts!",eTT8MdGV91jLp9OyfFvoPQ,0,0,4,oOt2Rl2B2v2g4efZ8XQY5Q

4026927,2016-10-28,0,5fWcM1vRg4v8HI85Vmy8OA,"First time at Jimmy johns, I was wondering why it was empty during lunch? Hmm first clue I made a bad choice. I ordered an Italian night club I think it was called. I asked for double meat and cheese as suggested but I was asked what meat I wanted double? I said the meat it comes with and then I was asked two more times what meat I again said double the meat that comes in it, finally I think they got it but I only got two slices of cheese when I believe they charged me for it since I paid $10 for the $6 dollar sandwich, 2ndly you have to speak what you want on your sndwich as you order as they do not ask you what you want in it the just start making it, lastly to be completely honest with the over all taste, it tasted like a vending machine sandwich, if you're really craving a sandwich head over to port o subs or capriottes their sandwiches are much more worth the cost and they personally do ask you what you want in it and if you ask for double meat which you won't have to as they give you a generous portion and aren't pre made set ups, they will give you exactly double of the meat that goes on that sandwich.",sL860YoTntXh5XvuYsWxVA,0,0,1,HO9KTYLHBExw5wSWzE9jXQ

This location is located on the Hobby Lobby plaza next to AT&T. The shop is small with a few tables, but very clean. The cashier was friendly and was patient with me. The one thing I love about Jimmy John's in general is their bread. I usually hate getting white bread for my sandwiches, but their bread is so soft. The turkey is flavorful and moist. They aren't skimpy on the rest of the sandwich ingredients either. 

Here's to show how fast they are. I paid for my meal and I went to fill up my drink cup. By the time I put the lid on my drink, my sandwich was already waiting for me. That's pretty fast.

I finally decided to come in for lunch and I knew in the first 20 seconds when I asked my first question, that I wasn't going to like this place very much.  I saw the white hoagies behind them on the shelf and I asked if they have wheat and she told me they don't but showed me the deli sliced wheat bread.  I settled for the white hoagie, ordered the #14 and yes it was fast and service was fine.  I get home and it's a very very basic simple deli sandwich, no wow factor, nothing unique about it, and nothing wrong with it.  I just didn't care for it. I felt they are in line with subway being a basic sandwich nothin special. At least subway has a variety of bread options.  I'll stick with my top favorite being Jersey Mikes or even Port of Subs.

We had the Vito Italian sub and the bootlegger club with cheese. Which is a roast beef and turkey sandwich I had it on the seven grain sliced bread which was very good. However I didn't really like the turkey to much. The Vito sandwich was a little better though. We had that on the French bread. It taste really good. Both breads are good. I guess it just depends on what you feel like eating at that moment. The big pickles was ok not very flavorful.
