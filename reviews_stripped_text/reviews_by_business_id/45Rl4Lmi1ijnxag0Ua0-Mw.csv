I wanted the Philly fries and by mistake I order cheese fries, the cook told me he can fix it I just need it to pay the difference, I approached the cashier and the lady told me I need you receipt, I please just charge me for the  meat  and she said I CAN'T.  By then I already waited over 10 mins after I got my order that I just left the place upset and shaky. I didn't want anything for free I wanted to pay, and the cashier would NOT assist me with that.",BZ4J1swL-tFo_-zODjskKg,1,0,1,hIoobyQ598qoUhmdAlvdHA

My husband and I were hungry and considering we had a 4 hour flight ahead of us we decided to go ahead and get a philly cheese steak sandwich. We normally don't not complain about food but this was just sad. Besides being over priced the sandwiches were beyond salty. It was so salty we couldn't finish eating it. Had to go next door and buy ice cream just to get the salty flavor out of ours mouths. Beware!!!! There's a port of subs next door that seems to have better sandwiches than this place.",JdUeYeoGgnVZhhVsSV-ikQ,0,0,1,IHx3IMxRIfh7eGR8m3NxTg

The fries were all brown and had an after taste of the oil. Health department should raid this place to check how frequently these guys change the oil and if how many people have fallen sick eating at this place. For 15 bucks this food was worthless and will probably get me sick. Had to throw away half of it just because I could not even gulp it due to the horrible taste it created in the mouth. McCarran airport authorities should take away the contract from these guys.",SgBAfgCix7hOit3Pw7CpJw,0,0,1,6LOKBe0wihhK21AQ-vyAOw

I was starving and quickly went in thinking of the delicious chicken Philly steaks of my youth from Great Steak.  This was NOTHING like the tasty sliced chicken breast with melted provolone and lettuce and tomato.  Red flag #2 should have been the menu was half @$$ed.  The actually added the lettuce tomato and mayo to the sandwich to make the infamous great chicken. And the wait?  whhhyyyywas it almost 15 minutes with one sandwich before and then an order of fries after me? Wth.
The only saving grace was the friendliness of the cashier and other employees I encountered.

But of course they didn't have any broccoli. Okay, so butter, sour cream baked potato. The baked potato, a water, and a small soda cost $15.00. Wasn't surprised. When the potato came out there was a glob of sour cream the size of the potato on it. Very unappealing. The potato skin was rock hard and the inside flaming hot. The Cheese. Okay the freaking cheese was insane. Way too much. More cheese and sour cream than actual potato. It was crazy. I tried my best, and ended up throwing away what I barely touched. Lesson learned.

It's a small little eatery with fountain drinks and a short menu. I had the original and I've had philly's out of the frozen aisle with more flavor. I didn't like it at all.. You've got meat and cheese sauce, onions.. I added mushrooms and didn't get them..

We're basically talking State Fair quality here; acceptable considering your location, but I wouldn't drive as far as the end of my driveway to go get it. I ordered a standard Philly Cheesesteak combo. Sandwich was A-OK, but what do I know, I've never been to Philly. Fries were boring and could have benefited from some salt. Staff was friendly and efficient but dining area is small and prison-grade. My combo was about $14 bucks.

Thankfully I was able to find this place near my gate and I ordered up a Veggie Delight which is vegan as long as you hold the cheese. I was pretty disappointed by the size of the sandwich relative to the price but the ingredients were decent and I kind of enjoyed it. What more could I possibly expect from airport food? The fries were pretty good though and helped fill me up for my journey back to the east coast.

The staff were polite and cool enough to warn me about the cost of the Stella Artois which is always appreciated but fell on deaf ears because I had a four hour flight ahead of me.",7jVGyd3WP7_F0G2jL1wGTg,2,1,3,dktkXU4J6IeE0_D8IHrDuA

My husband was on the line about to order quick food here and he saw one woman who was working here dropped the bread on the floor. Instead she should throw the bread away to the trash, she put it back on the tray and acted like nothing happened. 

My husband told her and the other worker there about food safety issue. Told them that they MUST throw that bread to the trash due she dropped it on the ground. It is not acceptance to serve the dirty bread to next customer. After that my husband left, he didn't want to order anything from this place. No one really understand or have knowledge about food safety.
