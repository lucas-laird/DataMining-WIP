Nice selection of tacos, fish tacos, burritos, and salads. It was neat to see the wrap for my burrito be freshly made. Decent amount of stuffing inside, could use more chicken(or steak, whichever you order). The size is  decent as well for under 10$

Anywho, in Vegas I'm always craving Mexican food like I always crave in California. So instead of opting for the buffet we decided to get food court meals.

My middle sister informed me that Rubio's was bomb dot com and that convinced me because we both love Mexican food. So their specialty was the fish taco. Which was delicious and crispy.

It was nothing spectacular but it was a good taco. I even got one street taco which had smeared on guacamole...if you know me....I despise avocados in every form and it gave my street taco a weird taste but I ate it and still alive. I would recommend they have in big print street tacos come with guacamole smeared on it for base...yuk.

My fault for assuming ""ordinary"" street tacos. I did like the fact they had onions and cilantro...because if you know me...cilantro all day everyday.

I'm not sure if I would have Rubio's again...but I can mark it off my try list. There's better fresh Mexican food.

Food - good, hot, fresh, as I expect it.
Service - friendly & efficient.
Meets expectations?  NO!

OK, so the worst thing a chain can do is dump consistency.  Rubio's advertises Fish Taco Tuesday ($1/taco) ""at participating locations"" and every one I've ever been into - and that means all over California - honors it.  But NOT Red Rock!  As if I knew that....

So when I plug Rubio's into the GPS on a Tuesday in response to my man's fish taco craving, drive out of my way, leave him in the car waiting while I enter a casino & play hide-&-seek to find Rubios in the back corner in a food court (all the while in cycling gear while I dive amongst rows of slot machines I might add - as in hubby really had a fish taco deal craving), order & then discover I'm being charged full pop because they don't participate?  I'm ANNOYED. Now I'm hungry, and my SO will be profoundly grumpy if I don't return with fish tacos.  

HUNGRY, ANNOYED and GRUMPY!!!

Seriously, folks.  If you've bought a franchise or opened another company store under the Rubio's banner with the Rubio's menu because you want the Rubio's reputation, ya better freakin' offer the Rubio's specials.  

Choked with you. True, I place this same order any day of the week that a craving hits regardless of the price, and loved my non-greasy carnitas street tacos and he had a craving satisfied.  Difference is I'll NEVER repeat a visit to this location because when it's Tuesday I want the discount.  Your brothers-in-arms will win out.",ampa4M7BlHpwQ4OoUwsx2g,0,0,1,kNWr6Ul2nSh63tYa_wmsXQ

Rubios has a great selection of catering packages to choose from; salads, taco bar, burritos, and enchiladas. Everything is fresh and so good. Leaders are always looking for healthier options and Rubios satisfies that criteria. 

This time, we ordered two taco bars and chose the grilled chicken and steak. Wouldn't you know it, the chicken always goes faster than the beef.  The order comes with guacamole, rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, Spanish rice, 3 different salsas, corn and flour tortillas, chopped salad and two large bags of tortilla chips.  Because its a taco bar, everyone can create their tacos or deconstructed tacos however they want to. Sometimes I choose to have a nacho salad but this time I made chicken tacos. So so good.

A few minutes turned into 10 minutes. Here's the thing: It wasn't busy, and there wasn't a line. Eventually, my friend returned to the counter and asked about his order, which he noticed was sitting on one of the back counters (thanks for letting us know the order was ready 5 minutes ago!)

4014341,2013-12-13,2,dJR2vmBlydzsxR5P6BDFlQ,"3 Stars is about right on the money for Rubio's.  Used to be better in my opinion when Fish Taco Tuesday was only $1 per taco.  I could feed my family like kings!  Now that they are $1.50 each we haven't been back really since.  Economy = SUCKS.

Whenever we end up at Red Rock Casino for date night the wifey and I often end up with a snack or a meal here.  It's probably one of the cheaper places in their food court to get a bite.  As much as I love Capriotti's and some Panda Express, sometimes a guy needs to watch his waistline.  Rubio's fits the bill nicely.  Get a healthy meal with some grilled fish, chicken, or steak, colorful veggies, and a wicked salsa bar.

The wifey likes her fish tacos, but sometimes will opt for the Pacific Mahi Mahi Burrito.  Mild fish, grilled with seasonings or blackened with spices, wrapped in a whole grain tortilla with fire-roasted corn, guacamole, Mexican rice, cilantro, onion, red and green cabbage, and creamy chipotle sauce.  Actually pretty good eats, very flavorful and definitely health-conscious.

I stick with the Burrito Especial with either steak or chicken.  Marinated meat, grilled, wrapped with guacamole, salsa fresca, sour cream, black beans, Mexican rice, and creamy chipotle sauce.  I usually add lettuce to mine and opt for a whole grain tortilla.  Not authentic Mexican, I know, but darn tasty!  

Each burrito or meal plate usually comes with a side of tortilla chips, perfect for taking advantage of Rubio's salsa bar!  Their signature salsas are all stellar.  I always take more than the usual amount of little plastic containers!  They usually have four salsas on the bar:

-Mild
-Tomatillo
-Roasted Chipotle
-Picante

Sometimes I guess depending on season one of the salsas will change.  Once they had a mango salsa, and another time they had a pineapple salsa.  My faves to go with are the tomatillo, and the roasted chipotle.  Complements any of their dishes great.  Also on the salsa bar is cilantro/onion mix, pickled jalapenos, limes, and lemons.  If you're a cheapie, just get yourself a serving of beans and rice, and top it off with everything from the salsa bar!  I've seen it done, and NO, it wasn't me.

Beware though, since this Rubio's is in a casino food court, prices can be a tad bit higher than one in your local neighborhood.  But it's still not too bad.  Our burritos came up to around $8-$9 each with chips and salsa bar included.  Not bad for a date night.

Get in, watch a movie, eat, then go ahead and lose the rest of your money to bingo or video poker!  I prefer CRAPS.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,1,0,3,5ga7v3UfdvF1hKdLNLKnMA

Because it is a chain, you don't have the diverse menu choices the more authentic mexican restaurants do but you get good quality.

It then took forever to get my food. At least, when I did get it, it was good. However, it seems as if the prices here are higher than stand alone locations, which is kind of BS, especially considering the bad service and attitude that came with it.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,1,1,3,hDfbbtu_tjgrHa5hcmAblg

There was a decent line yet the cashiers were able to run orders fairly quick. I was told fish tacos was the way to go and saw the 'new' mango fish taco. The price was little higher than I think it was worth, but everything else about it was great! It was a little sweet from the mango, but after adding onions to balance it out, I'm pretty sure I inhaled the tacos they were so good. I also got to sample my friends various tacos and burritos and all were delicious. 
If it wasn't for the price, I would probably be here once a week for tacos!",O-nFhs8UBvWaCkgkOTynDw,0,0,4,l_h2hZK2d2znGLi802uIOQ
